Subject: [Qgis-developer] Convert v1.7 project files to v1.6?
Message-ID: <003c01cc37d3$046e5af0$0d4b10d0$@co.uk>

All,

 

I have now moved back to v1.6 after the many issues faced with v1.7, and I
support Andreas Neumann's e-mail of yesterday.

 

The issue I am now up against is that v1.6 cannot open v1.7 project files,
it simply crashes. Project files which were not opened and saved in v1.7 are
still fine.

 

I have been into v1.7 on another windows computer, but there is no option to
save the project as a backwards compatible file. Perhaps this can be an
option for the future?

 

If anyone has any solutions to this, I would be grateful. Otherwise, I will
have to re-create the projects manually in v1.6.

 

Cheers,

 

Rob

 Not got a full solution, but you might get some joy from editing .qgs
files manually - they are XML and so can be edited using a text editor
(eg emacs on Unix, notepad++ on Windows). I've done some comparisons
by loading 1.6 files into 1.7 and saving, then diffing the results.
Apart from the change of version in the header there's a few tags that
appear in 1.7, and some other differences. If your projects aren't
that complicated you could possibly manually edit a 1.7 file back to
1.6 compatibility.

 Hope that's not too impossible or too obvious. I suspect saving as an
old version from 1.7 might be difficult given new functionality in
1.7. But if people are finding 1.7 broken.... yikes...

Hi Saber,

Yes, in certain projects, printing to any printer, including PDF995 causes the same error.

Barry / Ramon,

Thanks for the advice. 

I have looked into the project files using TextPad. I noticed a few
differences between a different 1.6 file and the 1.7 file, but after
changing these, it still crashes.

With there being over 600 lines of XML in the project, and a large workload
on my desk, I think i'll just have to re-create the projects, it will be
much faster.

Kind regards,

Rob

Hi,

the problem for me is to get the pointer of PropertiesWindows in a plugin.
I don't found in the doc how to get this with the QgsAppInterface.
I would connect the finish signal of Layer Properties dialog or another signal (which get a change in layer properties 
like render change single -> three band) to a method of my python plugin.

Regards

Agreed: AFAICT this is a major task: any idea of how much work would be necessary for
reasonable results? An order of magnitude would be enough for now.

I would second this, but would not be surprised if we end up raising little money
from it. It is true that 1 ? per user per year would be enough for us, but I doubt
that more than a tiny fraction of users will feel like.
If I'm wrong, I'm more than happy. Another possibility is to make a special fund
raising appeal for this. Similar initiatives for other projects had some success,
apparently.
My personal view is that we should expect more from the growing number of larger
institutions and enterprises that are using QGIS as a crucial piece of their
infrastructure. Some of them already realized the benefits of contributing back to
the well-being of the project, but many (most) still uses it and do not contribute.
They have the power to improve this situation easily.
All the best.

I belive a 30k figure might get things going far enough that developers
could have a policy of no functional change and no bugfix w/out a test
accompanying would be allowed.

I have ported the parameter system to traits, but am not sure if I am
taking the right approach. Dynamically generating the module
definitions and instances is problematic using traits. A more elegant
way would be to create a new python type for each module (perhaps
using `type()`), subclassing `HasTraits`.

It seems difficult to advance from this stage of development, the last
few weeks I have been writing and rewriting the same things, as
understanding of the problem and requirements change.

I would very much appreciate comments on how to continue: Do you think
traits is the way to go? If so, can you suggest cleaner ways to
implement the framework?

I have now invested a week trying to reconcile traits & the processing

Would appreciate if someone else can have a look at the code (traits
branch) and comment.

To me, the suggestion by Martin Dobias (using traits as a source of inspiration,
rather than as a library) makes a lot of sense. My suggestion is therefore to keep on
with the original work, but perhaps there is people around who can give a more
authoritative response.
All the best.

I don't know if this is relevant to the crashes you have been getting, but
TraitsUI and most other Enthought Qt-oriented GUI projects use version 2 of
the SIP QString and QVariant APIs:

    https://github.com/enthought/pyface/blob/master/pyface/qt/__init__.py

This is done so they can swap between PyQt4 and PySide without hassle and to
get better unicode and Python 3 support. QGIS uses Version 1 of those APIs
which is fundamentally incompatible. QGIS could upgrade to version 2 but all
Python plugins containing code using QString or QVariant would have to
replace these calls with plain Python strings and objects---definitely a
"2.0" sort of change.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QCheckBox and QDateEdit in custom forms
Message-ID: <20110703162724.GA1916@debianbox.homelinux.org>

Hello,

I am working on a custom form under QGis. I've got a postGIS table
which is linked to this custom form (a .ui file). The data of a
feature are shown in this form and you can use it to write data to the
database.

There is no problem with the (classic) QLineEdit control: once you've
written a value in the control and validate the form, it is written as
well in the database.

But I've got problems with QCheckBox: the box is always unchecked
whatever the value of the field. When you check this control, the
value is changed in the database (true or false). But if you try to
open a form on an existing object, the checkbox is always
unchecked. I've tested with (postGis) boolean and integer fields and
got the same problem.

The QDateEdit control is quite useful to help users to choose the
right date (with calendar popups). But, like QCheckBox, I can't make
them show the right value on form opening. It is always the default
date (01/01/00) even if the date field is not null in the table. If
you use the control to change the date, the value in the database is
changed to the one you chose. I've tested this control with both
(PostGIS) Date and Timestamp fields.

Is there any mean to make QcheckBox and QDateEdit control values be
the right values from the fields like QLineEdit ones ?

I am using Debian Squeeze nightly-build version of QGis but I am not
so sure that the problem is related to this specific version.

Do you think this is the same bug than this one:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3228 ?

Thanks for your advices...

Jurgen, as you seem to be the Windows guy for QGIS, maybe you can test my fork, make sure there are no compilation problems?

When using the identify tool with a 1 band GRASS raster, it works the first time and for all subsequent attempts it shows "error" for the value. The profile plugin has the same problem. For the first profile, it draws the line correctly and any following attempts, it draws a line with 0 elevation. The problem appears to have started between commits 15699 and 15856 in April. This is on OS X with frameworks from KyngChaos and both my builds of QGIS and the latest from KyngChaos. Anybody else having this problem? I did not find an bug report on this.

I have looked at the code and these changes look OK to me.

However would not it be better to add data defined fields to the
simple marker symbol layer instead of creating a new one? The ellipse
symbol layer seem to duplicate a lot of code, the only difference I
see is that ellipse marker supports unequal width and height).
Additionally it will probably make sense to add such data defined
rendering also e.g. for simple line and simple fill.

Regarding the widget for symbol layer properties - I do not really
like the tabbed approach (the second tab with lots of combo boxes
looks scary :-), though I am not sure what would be the most user
friendly approach. I am merely a fan of "Advanced" buttons that show
this functionality (maybe in a separate dialog or by adding further
widgets). I guess this way the regular users do not get overwhelmed
with complexity and power users are happy.

One more technical issue: in the ellipse symbol layer you store
indexes together with the field names. This is suboptimal and the
field indexes should be resolved in startRender() method.

This is going to be another nice addition to the new symbology!

Martin

Yes you are using old symbology. New symbology classes all contain
"V2" in their name: QgsSymbolV2 etc. It is highly recommended to use
new symbology since the old symbology will be removed in 2.x release
series.

I haven't tried the following code yet, but something like this should work:

layer.setRendererV2( renderer )
layer.setUsingRendererV2( True )
layer.setRenderer( None )

First line sets new symbology renderer (any instance of
QgsFeatureRendererV2 subclass), second line tells the vector layer
that new symbology will be used instead of old symbology. Final line
deletes the associated old symbology renderer.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CMake cleanup and OS X frameworks
Message-ID: <70049DC1-9ADA-47EA-BE7A-FB3CB53807CC@kyngchaos.com>

I did some CMake cleanup, along with changing the qgis libraries to frameworks for OS X.  Some notes:

- removed a lot of unnecessary conditionals for target configuration for platform-specific options.  Cmake is designed so that platform-specific options are only used for the platform, so they can all be specified in a single configuration command. ie for an application:

  ADD_EXECUTABLE ([exename] MACOSX_BUNDLE WIN32 [sources...])

- header installation is an automatic part of targets.  Though some headers may still need a separate install command (ui headers don't exist when cmake runs).  I also put all global header installation (qgsconfig.h, qgisplugin.h, qgsrendererplugin.h) in qgis_core, since in the OS X framework setup there is no place for random headers.

- core, gui, analysis, grass and sqlanywhere libs are now frameworks on OS X.  I couldn't make qgispython a framework because it's loaded dynamically and the Qt dyld functions expect standard file extensions, and a framework has none (the binary inside the framework, that is).  Really, grass and sqlanywhere don't need to be frameworks, maybe I got carried away there ;)

There is also an option to install core, gui and analysis as "developer" frameworks.  This gets around the potential problem of the internal relative path linking, and makes the libraries more accessible.  The cmake option is QGIS_MACAPP_INSTALL_DEV (bool).  They are installed by default in /Library/Frameworks, but this can be changed with QGIS_MACAPP_DEV_PREFIX.

Note that the headers are not updated to make "proper" frameworks, so -I flags to each framework's Headers folder are still needed.  (A proper framework header references other framework headers prefixed by the framework name, ie #include <qgis_core/qgis.h>.  Needs some discussion about reorganizing the headers in QGIS, if there is interest.)

Hi Martin

Welcome back :-)

Thank you for reviewing the ellipse renderer changes.

Yes, it is width<->height, outlinewith option and data defined fields which are 
new (whereas it lacks x-/y-shift). The idea of the ellipse renderer was to 
have minimal impact on existing classes. But yes, bringing the additions into 
the simple marker class is also my preferred solution.

I don't have a strong opinion here. A dialog with an "Advanced" extension 
sounds good to me. Do we already have examples of such dialogs in QGIS? Tim, 
what do the HIG say?

I agree, storing only the name would be more robust towards attribute changes 
(e.g. storing projects, inserting fields into the db with external programs, 
then reopen again). 
Is there a way to resolve the indexes from within the symbol layer? Maybe it's 
something obvious that I just don't see. The symbollayer needs to know 
attribute name and index (name to say which attributes it needs, index in 
renderPoint). However, it does not know the vectorlayer to get the relation 
between name and index.

Regards,
Marco

I've played a bit with gis.stackexchange and think it's really a good idea to 
use it.
Instead of forum.qgis.org we could use 
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/qgis
as starting point.

IMHO there is no realistic solution with *one* login. Migrating forum and wiki 
would reduce logins by one or two (depending whether the user has an OpenID 
login). According to the docs, Joomla also supports LDAP logins 
(http://docs.joomla.org/LDAP), so OSGEO logins could used there, too.

to have a decent "mobile" interface on that ..
Or is it to early to say something about that?

If there is something to test - just tell me .. ;) my android is ready

Hi Werner,
this week I'll try to get a standard qgis running on Android, then the plan
is to optimize the GUI. we are first targeting tablets and not phones yet.
Thanks for the testing offer, I'll let you know soon.
ciao
Marco

Hi Marco

thanks for the update.

When trying to compile QGIS on android I think you only need to aim
for compilation of qgis_core library and few providers. I would
suggest completely disabling compilation of qgis_gui, the application
itself, plugins, mapserver, python support and other components. Once
qgis_core library compiles you have everything necessary in order to
start developing a new QML-based GUI optimized for mobile phones /
tablets.

Good luck!

Martin

Maybe something like this could be considered when designing the GUI:

Why not having py plugins?
Seems a major limitation to me.

In the afternoon I'll meet Marco H and Pirmin and I want to discuss that 
as main subject. We already had some discussion and we agreed that first 
I'll try to get a very basic qgis to run and then we'll build on top of 
than. maybe onlz starting with core libs would be an idea as well.
I'll upadate soon.

Is this something that should be decided by the PSC or rather by the
community? I guess only Gary can shut the forum down or turn it read-only.

 Hi,

 I think as a data source it would be very nice to have SpatiaLite 
 support in Android (as others on the list have already pointed out). 
 Having to go through ESRI Shapefiles is very clumsy. Using SpatiaLite 
 one could convert a Postgis based QGIS project to SpatiaLite through the 
 offline editing plugin. One could preserve column names and everything 
 would be in one file.

 For me QGIS Android would be much more compelling and easier to use 
 with SpatiaLite.

 But I understand that qgis-core and a basic GUI would be the first work 
 items during the porting.

+100 for Spatialite.

I am telling the developer of this project -Android Spatialite that
Marco manage to compile GEOS 3.2,2.

Android Spatialite without GEOS

Just FYI:
for sure SpatiaLite has already been successfully ported 
to Android (and to iOS/iPhone/iPad as well).

At least, this is what I guess reading the spatialite's
own ML: several developers claim their successes on
this field, and all them seems to be fully satisfied.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qt Error (1.6)
Message-ID: <003601cc3b1c$8cbb7400$a6325c00$@co.uk>

Dear All,

 

I have uninstalled a few old programs from my PC (can't remember what they
were, as I never really used them), and now I get the error as shown at the
following URL:

 

http://www.danceselection.co.uk/upload/Untitled.png

 

I've had these Qt*.dll issues before, and normally when I copy the dll's
from the QGIS\Bin directory to Windows\System32, it sorts the problem.
However, it has not worked in this case.

 

Obviously I have attempted to uninstall and reinstall QGIS, but this never
sorts the Qt issues.

 

Any advise would be grateful.

 

Cheers,

 

Rob

Hi William,

I encountered the following error using your update:

CMake Error at images/icons/CMakeLists.txt:12 (ADD_SUBDIRECTORY):
   add_subdirectory given source "mac" which is not an existing directory.

It looks like icon files weren't moved from src/mac to images/icons/mac.

I had this issue also, worked around it by copying that directory over. I don't know if this is related, but trying to access the preferences now brings up the shortcut dialog. Settings --> Options gets to preferences, though.

Personally, I'd love to see the menus get cleaned up so that qgis looks/feels/acts more like a mac application on mac platforms. This is a problem that arose sometime after 1.4 or 1.5, but it is now becoming more than a distraction. Multiple, redundant (you like that irony?) menu items, disorganized menu structures, Help menu not last in the menu bar, etc.

I wish I knew how to poke around in the ui files to try and fix this, but I do not. So no solutions provided here, only complaints. Sorry about that.

Cheers,
John

John, probably you can make a mock up on the menu structure for QGIS
Mac OS X and post the URL link so everybody can see. Then, we can
customise QGIS for Mac OS X to our linking.

Tim has good info how to use the qtcreator with qgis which make UI
easier to manupulate.

http://linfiniti.com/2011/06/using-qtcreator-with-qgis/

I for one would like to resurrect my nkids icon set for QGIS and I
think QGIS for Mac OS X needs bit of crystal icons i.e. glossy icon
sets.

Marco thinks that the community members who take care of the forum could 
decide such a change. But it is always possible to send a mail to the PSC list 
and ask for their view. Since Gary didn't step into the discussion and it's 
"his" forum, I would suggest that Anita sends a mail to the PSC list.
The technical tasks would be
-posting an info message to the forum
-make the forum read-only
-Update qgis.org pages to point to gis.stackexchange
-Optional: Changing the DNS entry for forum.qgis.org

Hi All,

 

I am still receiving the following error when trying to open QGIS:

 

"The procedure entry point

?resetHeight@QGraphicsItemPrivate@@UAEXXZ could not be located

In the dynamic link library QtGui4.dll"

 

I have tried all previous workarounds, such as copying the file to
Windows\System32, adding QGIS\bin directory to the %PATH% system variable,
re-installing QGIS, and copying an entire working directory of QGIS from
another PC, but nothing fixes it.

 

Any help would be much appreciated, as I am again stuck without QGIS :( 

 

Cheers,

 

Rob

Did you install your QGIS from OSGeo4W or stand alone installer?

Quick Update,

 

I have now solved the problem by performing the following steps:

 

1.       Renaming all Qt*.dll files in Windows\System32 to Qt*.dll.old

2.       Uninstall QGIS, restart PC

3.       Install QGIS as administrator

 

The last step may not be necessary as it should run with elevated privileges
anyway, but it worked.

 

I guess another program installed the dll's into the System32 directory, as
I had only copied Qtcore are Qtgui4 previously.. I'm just waiting for
another program to stop working now!

 

Cheers,

 

Rob

Hi Saber,

Thanks for the reply.

I have just posted an update, as it now works. However, I did try both the standalone installer and OSGeo4W, both had the same error.

Cheers,

it seems that qgis initialization code is missing, see the cookbok how
to set path to qgis libraries and do the initialization:

Hi all,

if I run the following code from a terminal:

brushtyler@Joe-Notebook:~$ python
>>> from qgis.core import *
>>> QgsApplication.setPrefixPath('/usr/local/qgis/', True)
>>> QgsApplication.initQgis()

I get

/home/brushtyler/projects/sources/qgis/src/core/qgsproviderregistry.cpp: 84:
(QgsProviderRegistry) Checking /usr/local/qgis//lib/qgis/plugins for
provider plugins
/home/brushtyler/projects/sources/qgis/src/core/qgsmessageoutput.cpp: 65:
(showMessage) No Data Providers:
/home/brushtyler/projects/sources/qgis/src/core/qgsmessageoutput.cpp: 69:
(showMessage) No QGIS data provider plugins found in:
/usr/local/qgis//lib/qgis/plugins
No vector layers can be loaded. Check your QGIS installation

As far as you can see, the QgsApplication searches providers in
/usr/local/qgis//lib/qgis/plugins
but in my local installation the qgis providers are in
/usr/local/lib/qgis/plugins

So just changing the code above to

>>> from qgis.core import *
>>> QgsApplication.setPrefixPath('/usr/local/', True)
>>> QgsApplication.initQgis()

and providers are loaded well  :)
I hope this helps.

Cheers.

I think we're almost there. Two info.plist.in files still need to be

Hi,
Followup to recent discussion on pgversion plugin:
For versioning (in the sense of history), there is emaj for postgresql:
http://pgfoundry.org/projects/emaj/
The manual is well written. Version 0.9 works very well even with postgis data and provides full versioning and rollback (including with tied tables). The only issue is that the id type is not supported by qgis; an easy workaround for a reasonable number of changes is to use a view like this:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW emaj.test_points_log_view AS (SELECT emaj_id::int4 as id_int4, * from emaj.public_test_points_log);

>From a philosophical point of view, conflict resolution and history versioning share some ideas: you want to know what the other do.
>From a functionality point of view, there are some related features: you can stop a commit (pgversion) or roll it back (emaj).

As a side note, wikipedia defines versioning in the historical sense (I never encountered the other one), see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning

Would be great somehow to somehow merge the two or make them compatible (I have'nt tried), or share some common tables. It also remind me, I believe, a plugin with a slider for versioned data with time-stamp but I cannot find it (was I dreaming?).

Hi,
I've uploaded a new plugin called VectorStudio, it provides tools for vectors (geometries) transformations in "edit-time".It has an interface that allows the creation of new tools without changing the main code, you can write 'plugins for the plugin'.It's in very early stage and for now is tagged as experimental.
I would appreciate comments and suggestions.

Yes, that is at least part of the problem. I'll continue without
traits ATM, as Paolo and Martin recommended.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Data exchange between QGIS and SAGA [was: QGIS
	Processing Framework]
Message-ID: <CAA5P-m1nJHEL1+gZUp0+PNdNnhePzyJZ+acnbELdYNPufLV94A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello saga developers,

in case you haven't followed the development of the QGIS Processing
Framework and SAGA interface, a short introduction:

I was selected to implement a QGIS to SAGA interface in context of
Google's Summer of Code 2011 program. The last weeks have been spent
designing and implementing basic parts of a more general framework to
processing modules. There is interest in interfacing at least SAGA,
the Orfeo Toolbox and OSSIM to QGIS. A rough design document can be
found at [1]. Note that the implementation[2, 3] differs
substantially, though.

One of the most important and difficult remaining parts is data
exchange (raster & vector). I have been studying SAGA's API [4], but
am not sure how to handle it & would appreciate comment from people
more familiar with it.

Do you think it would be easier (or cleaner) to interface SAGA's
relevant data structures to QGIS' dataproviders or layer structures?
For comparison, see the QGIS API docs.[5]

Hi,
I installed the plugin I tried to play with it but could not do
anything. Maybe you could describe what it does. If you know how to make
a screencast, putting this on, e.g., youtube, is probably the most
efficent way.

Ok, tanks. I'll elaborate a better documentation. For now, here is a simple explanation:
1) VectorStudio works based is two selections: "Selection A" and "Selection B".

2) Select the features you want and press 1 in the keyboard to set "Selection A", press 2 to set "Selection B".

3) Run the tools you want.

Message-ID: <CABqTJk_YJmQ-w34_kb+PRxfcbMxR9=wOiKYLvtkMLZvOgnN4OA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need to create many SVG symbol to use as fill for polygons rendering.

Someone is preatty easy to do because the fill is a simple fill with
diagonal lines.
But some symbol is a more complex regular pattern of little object.
I need to know the right size of the SVG symbol to have the correct reply of
pattern without breaks.

I try with 32x32 but it seem to be no optimal.

An example:

I need to do a fill with this pattern:

 *   *   *   *   *   *
   *   *   *   *   *
 *   *   *   *   *   *
   *   *   *   *   *

I try to create a SVG with this pattern but when apply it the qgis renderize
in this mode:

 *   *   *   *   *   *
   *   *   *   *   *
   *   *   *   *   *
   *   *   *   *   *

I guess this is due to wrong size of my SVG symbol that not is optimal for
the pattern.
Bu I don't know the size that qgis need to have.

thx,

Hi

I also took some time to test your branch. It works very nicely - the
only option I miss is the ability to have a transparent fill :-)

Marco we had quite a long discussion about the symbol editor
functionality in QGIS in Lisbon. The short version is that we would
like to make some generic widgets for representing symbols (and other
common ui patterns like managed lists and so on). For now I think your
tabs are ok (and better than having another popup dialog).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Provider native raster band stats
Message-ID: <CALCNqka-wv9kDwZxbOKzYDoz84FFv9tkeVFWMuLHrJ-9cEiwVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

During the Lisbon hackfest (between all those meetings!) I worked on
updating the raster providers to be able to generate stats themselves.
The raster provider base class has a default (and historically
inefficient as we all know) implementation for collecting stats by
walking over every cell in the raster twice. This method remains, but
the providers can now supply stats themselves (heopfully using more
efficient mechanisms). I have implemented gdal native stats already.
Over the last few weeks I did some further testing and cleanups to
this work. From my testing some of my worst case files opened in
~1minute rather than ~8+ minutes. It would be great if interested
parties could test (details below) before I put it into master.

git remote add timlinux git://github.com/timlinux/Quantum-GIS.git
git fetch timlinux
git branch --track timlinux raster-stats
git checkout raster-stats

I look forward to your feedback.

Regards

Try using /usr/local rather (assuming your install prefix was
/usr/local). It works for me:


>>> from qgis.core import *

Subject: [Qgis-developer] cmake install and includes
Message-ID: <4E14EB6F.9050704@comcast.net>

All,

Just some cmake feedback.  On linux when I do a cmake build on linux with

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local

and do a:

make
make install

The includes go to:

/usr/local/include/qgis

Which is good:

So in my qgis plugin I namespace my includes like:

// QGIS Specific includes
#include <qgis/qgisinterface.h>

All is good, I have a single include path of /usr/local/include.

But on window includes install to:

C:\Program Files\qgis1.7.0\include

Note no qgis sub dir.

So then:
#include <qgis/qgisinterface.h>

Does not work.

So it would be nice if the install went one way or the other on all 
platforms.  I like the namespaced sub directory, i.e. 
install_prefix/include/qgis.

Just some feedback...

Take care,
Dave

Hi Andrea,

There is no "expected size" of your SVG document. I would recommend
using a square size for your document.

Creating seamless patterns in SVG can be hard. The hard part is to make
sure that the tiles can repeat and one cannot see the tile borders.

Here is a small tutorial on how to create SVG patterns in Inkscape:
http://ffaat.pointclark.net/blog/archives/143-Creating-and-Adding-Custom-Patterns-to-Inkscape.html

I will later see at my workplace if I can find a pattern similar to what
you want.

For diagonal patterns I would recommend to create straight horizontal or
vertical lines and then set the pattern rotation. It is easier to create.

Note that in trunk there is now a new feature that allows you to
overwrite colors and other settings to re-use the same patterns for
different colors. See Sourcepole blog: http://www.sourcepole.ch/

Hi all.
This prompts me an old but more and more urgent question: do we want a way for user
to add and share their set of symbols, much in the way we do for python plugins?
There are a number of resources available online (just discovered:
http://thenounproject.com/ ; thanks Giovanni) and the possibility of adding and
removing similar sets would greatly improve the usability of QGIS.
It does not seem an heavy task, essentially we have to mimick the behaviour of the
plugin installer.
Any taker?
All the best.

BTW: in my case the color change is not applied; perhaps I did not understand how it
works. Is an howto available?
The screenshot on the sourcepole page seems broken.
All the best, and thanks.

great idea!

a few remarks from my side:
Just my own opinion - i feel during the 1.7 release (svn->git,
trac->redmin) the pages are a bit split and the users (including me)
are sometimes confused.
It seems that we are in the urgent need of a cleaner to clean out all
redundant and obsolete information on the web (also with the probably
migration of the forum to a new place in mind)
my opinion is that creating more and more (surely cool and useful)
websites is a way that really confuses users..
Could we probably consolidate the things a bit to "shrink" us clean?

just as a note .. (and the idea of prividing svg repositorys is really
a great idea)

regards
Werner

@Paolo

Symbol sharing and svg marker sharing are on the todo list for the new
django infrastructure

@Werner

Sorry if it is still confusing - we are trying to consolidate
everything in one place and under one framework so that it is easier
to manage, maintain, backup etc.

Basically:

OSGEO SVN Hosting -> Github GIT Hosting
OSGEO Trac -> hub.qgis.org

then the new sites:

users.qgis.org
plugins.qgis.org
planet.qgis.org
etc

If you go to any one of the above, you will find links to all the others.

Some code still exists in svn (code examples, documentation etc.) and
will be mitgrated to git in due time.

Regards

To,

Where did you install QGIS to? If you installed from a package, your
prefix is probably /usr . Look for libqgis_core.so on your system - it
will give you an indication of what your application prefix is. e.g.

locate libqgis_core.so

Running *locate libqgis_core.so * returns the following locations:
/usr/lib/libqgis_core.so.1.6.0
/usr/lib/libqgis_core.so.1.7.0

I installed qgis from ubuntgis repo and I'm using ubuntu 11.04
I tried to use */usr* as prefix but also failed.
Could it be something else the problem?
Thanks for your help!

Hi Andreas and others


I wrote a bit of an essay on this a week or two back:
http://linfiniti.com/2011/06/some-thoughts-on-the-future-of-qgis/

Believe me we have tried just about every suggestion including having
a policy of unit tests for new features and bug fixes. The truth is
that until we have undirected funding sufficient for the project to
employ some of us developers to work full time on QGIS, things will
probably never improve - developers need to earn a living which means
they do work on QGIS based on client requirements or do other work and
work on QGIS in their spare time. Most clients don't mandate tests be
written to accompany the work they commission. With so many things
that need working on, testing etc just doesnt attract the attention it
should. So the idea of creating some kind of fund that is aimed at
having a group of developers working full time on stabilising and
professionalising QGIS is where we need to head for. I have already
been having some behind the scenes discussions with potential funding
sources on this, but so far nothing has materialised. I believe in the
future it will come to pass that we can do this. From your side you
can help too - when you contract developers to create new features,
mandate unit tests to be part of the deliverables. If every
organisation who was paying to add functionality to QGIS did this we
would already be in a lot better  shape!

Regards

Tim

Camilo,

I think the only feasible way, definitely on short term, is saving
every needed qgis data-object on disk in saga's native file format
(shp for vector data, sgrd/sdat for raster data(requires gdal 1.7)),
running the saga module (like you would do if you were running the
command line version) and then opening the resulting files in qgis.
You could use the api to find out which objects in qgis may be passed
to saga, eg make sure that only polygon vectors show up as an option
in the dialog, but for actually passing the data, I think you should
write to the disk.
I think the same will be true for many other processing frameworks,
and I even noticed that when I calculate voronoi polygons in qgis I
have to save my files prior to running, so even here it seems to work
like that.
Direct access of the files like they are loaded in qgis would most
likely require non-obvious changes in the saga api, which -imho- go
outside the scope of your project, certainly if you want to have a
general processing framework.
It is also a non-essential feature: it may be added later if the
plugin is successful, with the 'write to disk method' as a safe
fallback option.

Kind Regards,
Johan

 yes - I think it should be the goal that developers can work full time 
 on QGIS. And a policy should be introduced that all newly implemented 
 features should have tests.

 I wouldn't only blame the paying customers for not wanting the unit 
 tests, it is just as much the duty of the developer to educate the 
 customer about the unit tests/testing infrastructure. We do some 
 substantial funding of QGIS, but we were not aware about the problem of 
 the lacking tests until just recently. I don't see a problem to pay an 
 extra amount dedicated to testing the new features.

 Sandro Santilli (strk) is a Postgis developer who did some work for us. 
 He is always doing the testing and documentation as part of the 
 contract. I think this should also be the case for QGIS development.

 But for the existing functionality of QGIS we need to find a different 
 solution. Strk said that he would be available to help in building a 
 test infrastructure if we can find funding. We from our part would be 
 willing to help funding such an effort (of course there would have to be 
 a couple other organizations to help as well).

 Thank you for your thoughts,
 Andreas

We already have such an infrastructure - under tests in the source
tree -  but as Sandro pointed out it is in need of revision and the
coverage of the code base is very poor. Let me try to explain what is
already in place:

We (mainly myself and Martin I think) implemented some basic tests for
core and gui under tests/src/
I also implemented a tool called renderchecker that does an image
comparison between a control image and an image rendered off the code
base
I have documented in quite some detail in CODING the procedure for
writing a test
Martin has written the test_builder.pl to generate test stubs
I have a test suite builder script (which will try to run test_builder
for every source file in core)
I put some example regression tests too e.g. tests/src/core/regression992.cpp
We have scripts that will run the tests tests/src/runtests.sh
There is a test template tests/src/core/test_template.cpp

So there is already a lot of groundwork in place for testing - though
it has not been maintained for some time for reasons stated in my
previous email. As mentioned above, Martin once wrote some perl script
(tests/src/core/test_builder.pl) to automate the generation of test
stubs. I think that some meta programming of this nature could be
useful to create initial test cases covering the whole of core and
gui. Then someone could be funded to populate all the stubs with
tests. Ideally if he was going to revise it, we should accompany the
revision with setting up automated cmake testing on the server so that
it runs the tests nightly. CMake already has all the tools for doing
this, it just needs someone to spend the time to do it.

I think we should focus on testing the libraries - in the future Qt
also provides an infrastructure for creating GUI automation tests.
What I am trying to say really is that we did already put quite some
thought into testing but we are spread too thin to carry it through.
So having someone funded to get the tests really working nicely would
be an awesome addition to the project. From a social side, mandating
tests hasnt really worked till now - I guess we are always a bit
scared of losing peoples interest (which we depend on so much) by
setting too many difficult barriers in place for them to contribute.
At some point I guess we will have to bite the bullet and start
refusing contributions unless accompanied by tests (and that they dont
break existing tests).

Tim

@leonidas:

I have the same problem with my ubuntu 11.04 64bit. i switched back to
ubuntu 10.10 32 bit and the same code is running as expected.
I've tried many prefixes already but neither worked.

Remove all 1.6 packages and try again please - bad things happen when

Did you remove all other 1.6 related libs? Probably you should be
doing it with your package manager....

Use ldd to check that all your libs are correctly pulled in e.g.

ldd /usr/share/qgis/python/qgis/core.so

You should see references to the 1.7 libs there for qgis related stuff....

Ok, I test it on my home PC (ubuntu 10.04-32bit), qgis 1.7.0 and the script
is working perfect. I use /usr as prefix!
But on my job PC I cannot find the problem. Using synaptic package manager,
I search for qgis 1.6 and there is nothing installed.

I agree with Tim. Basic infrastructure for testing is there, it just
needs quite some work to cover at least commonly used routines in the
core library. At the same time we should reintroduce nightly builds
with testing (and alerts to mailing list on broken tests). There was a
BuildBot instance for qgis on osgeo server, but later something went
wrong with the server and it wasn't restored.

But most importantly we need to teach ourselves to really create unit
tests for newly committed functionality - otherwise we will end up
with broken and incomplete tests like now. Perhaps we need to raise
some kind of challenge :-) And maybe to have someone who will start
shouting when new functionality does not receive tests :-)

IIRC you were working on an option to run the test without installing first at
the hackfest.   How did that go?

Hi,

I'm developing a new plugin and I got to put a new QToolButton in a new
QToolBar that I created, but the problem is that I can't connect the
QToolButton to the QGis's default ButtonGroup  and neither connect the
action to QgsMapCanvas.

How do I add a new ToggleButton connected with QgsMapCanvas?????

I want to get the coordinate clicked, ONLY THIS!!!!!

Any example code????

Thanks,

Orn?lio

Hi all

Being in favor of unit tests, we cannot hope to solve with them all the 
stability problems, as some mails here suggest. It is just one small piece. In 
fact, thinking about bugfixes in the past, e.g. for the 1.7 release, most of 
them occured as a complex combination of several factors and user interaction, 
very hard to detect with unit tests.

Another point that needs to be considered is that the unit testing code needs 
to be maintained. Adding a test for every little change, even bugfix, would 
create a huge amount of testing code and sample datasets.

What about alternatively creating a unit test base that is limited in size but 
well maintained, e.g. a good coverage of the core classes? 

Regards,
Marco

I wouldn't call it small. But it surely won't easily test each and every
possible combination of interactions. Not deterministically at least
(there are some testsuites aimed at throwing random inputs to tools, to
catch a wider set of bugs w/out tight control over the premises, postgis
garden test is one, we've used zzuf for gnash).

This may be a limit on the currently available tools for testing GUIs,
but anyway nobody said it'd be an easy task.

The bigger the testsuite, the safer the codebase !

What has to be maintained about testcases ?
The only reason to change a testcase would be a change in the underlying
classes interfaces, which is one of the causes for instability, so having
testcases that break might be an aim to keep APIs stable.

I don't see any testing effort being exclusive. The more testing
means, the better.

Software testing is probably one of those areas that separates the men from
the boys. It is great fun to add new features and functionality, but
requires sustained hard work to ensure that the end result "just works". 

I'm currently writing a tutorial for individuals with no GIS experience to
start using QGIS for real tasks. As part of this I've started adding
warnings about known problems, incomplete features and functionality that
(to me) is non-intuitive... and I'm starting to feel defensive about a
product that I love, but isn't demonstrating its inner qualities. 

Unit testing is very important, but system testing in many environments is
also necessary to get statistical confidence in stability. 

Last month, Julien Malik mentioned about Sikuli ( http://sikuli.org/
http://sikuli.org/ ). I've had a preliminary look at the documentation and
it may have potential. I will not have time to try it for a few weeks, but
the possibility of developing scripts to exercise QGIS without any knowledge
of, or access to, the code looks useful. If I get chance to develop any
tests, I'll give an update.
In the UK, I'm trying to encourage the uptake of QGIS at the community level
and, hopefully with a demonstrably growing user base, to get some government
funding. To me, the two biggest "features" that need development are
software quality and documentation (probability in that order), and that is
where I personally would recommend funding. However, any such money remains
a long-term hope.

Quality is not an add-on, but a fundamental necessity to stay in business.
If anyone doubts this, try asking the ghosts of the British motorcycle and
automotive industries.

I'm happy to do it, though as code manager it might make more sense
for  Marco to do it. We should get in the habit of

fork
branch
work
write tests
request for merge
integrate

or something along those lines. When merges are done and all tests are
passing in theory the code should be release ready...

Hi

Try looking at some code that already does something similar to what
you need e.g.

src/plugins/coordinate_capture/coordinatecapturemaptool.cpp

If you are programming in python, simply open a plug that does
something similar and look at the source.

Regards

Tim

Hello everyone,

the end of GSoC's first term is nearing and while I think we have made
a significant progress, many things are still pending. I have tried to
identify a few and compile a short list[1], to try to keep focused
during the next few weeks.
I'll try to create a proper timeline with (some of) those items &
would appreciate your comments. Anything missing? Some things more
urgent than others?

Of course, most of the work will revolve around the first item: Data
exchange. Still no clarity on how to handle that.

Regards,

Camilo

I can think of several reason why the testcase need changes and the 
maintainance is not 0 (usually there are even more cases in practice):

- The dependencies of QGIS do change (both in API and in behaviour). Most 
tests use Qt classes. The Qt API _and_ behaviour can change. Anybody remembers 
the switch from Qt3 to Qt4? It was a huge effort to port all the classes (the 
bigger the testsuite, the more changes).

- The API of QGIS might indeed change. E.g. say Martin implements a new 
redesigned symbology engine -> he needs to adapt all the symbology related 
test (the more the better?)

- The 'no change without unit test' policy means also test for internal 
classes (not in the public API)

That's a pitty, because the difference in funding is what separates the boys 
business from the mens business.

Message-ID: <CA+biy=8HzrRLFtFu_Zt2Fw55TzT+t2+zaYTqz3fLPwLXe6R1ow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using QGIS 1.7 (Windows Xp).
I've created a layer in QGIS from a SpatiaLite DB  ( qgsvectorlayer)
I've checked with isValid(), every thing is all right.
Now, I want to export this layer to MAPINFO,
but before, I need to specify all fields length...
Is it possible with QGIS API ?  (Until now, i have'nt found any solution)

I was thinking of creating an empty layer with correct length and copy my
layer in...
But I wonder if there is a simpler option ?

Cheers,
Romain,

Hello Camilo,

Some feedback about your todo list :

- constraints and validator is low priority to me : it can be handled  
by the underlying implementation for now
- user level is low priority to me as it will probably be easy to add  
this feature later when the big things will be in shape
- interactive parameters : higher priority to me. Having a way for the  
implementation to tell the GUI "update every widgets". Maybe I already  
have a way to do that (?)

A few things you don't mention :
- running the processing modules programmatically
- progress reporting
- logging
- multiple values parameter type (at least to provide a "multiple  
input layers" parameter type)
- parameter groups (what happen currently with the SAGA "nodes" ?)

I agree with your analysis : being able to access the QGis layers for  
the input/output is now the most important thing to focus on.

What precisely is blocking you on this topic ?
I saw some recent updates adding a combobox with the layers but did  
not test it yet. The implementations could handle the conversion into  
their own internal data structure from the MapLayer objects.
I know at least that on the OTB side, a first step will be getting a  
gdal/ogr compatible dataset name and pass them as input files to the  
implementation.
As I can remember, SAGA has a "gdal/ogr" importer module for inputs,  
and the output should be simple also as the saga file format is  
supported by gdal.

Regards,
Julien

Subject: [Qgis-developer] defined symbols differ between qgis canvas and
	print composer
Message-ID: <20110708082956.2ea3e259@nature.speedport.ip>

Hi,

is this a known "bug" or missing feature, that not all features of the
new symbology engine are supported in the map composer? Attached you see 2
symbols image001 defined in qgis as symbology and image002 as it
appears in the print composer. 

Should I add it to the bugtracker?

Kind regards,
 Otto

A nice recent article about it here :

CMake/CTest integration, and some feedback from the developers about the 
advantages and limitations.

Hi
Just a thought on "branch THEN work THEN write tests".
It could be instead: "branch THEN write tests THEN work".
Agile programming encourages test-driven development: you write the
tests first, then you code new functionalities.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development
While this encourages good practice, I do not know how easy would it be
to implement.
Anyway, thanks again all for your work!

Hi

Sorry I just caught up on this thread now. I share Martin's concern
about dropping C++ support by adopting traits directly. Have you made
a decision on this, is C++ still on the cards?

Hi

Sorry I just caught up on this thread now. I share Martin's concern
about dropping C++ support by adopting traits directly. Have you made
a decision on this, is C++ still on the cards?

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] featureAtId Python
Message-ID: <4E16AEFB.5060906@jena.de>

Dear All,

I am trying to access features from a geometryless PostgreSQL-Table by 
their id, same code works with geometry-containing (PostGIS) layers.
In the Python-console enter:
 >>> l=qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer() #geometryless table
 >>> f=QgsFeature()
 >>> l.featureAtId(571,f) #this id exists in the table
False

I tried on WinXP and Linux with QGIS 1.7.0

Am I missing something or shall I file a ticket?

regards

Bernhard

P.S.
This works:
 >>> l.select(571)
 >>> l.selectedFeatureCount()
1

Since gdal 1.7 saga is indeed supported. And although saga has a
gdal/ogr input module, I think it is a better idea to use qgis to save
to sgrd/sdat or shape rather than letting saga do it: since the file
opened succesfully in qgis, and perhaps some changes were made,
exporting should not cause issues. On the other hand saga might have
problems opening some of these files (I'm not aware of examples - but
at least in theory it makes sense).

agreed, seems the most sensible approach. let's use QGIS functions as much as
possible, as this would make it easier to build workflows also across different tools.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] feature-request: qgis-desktop -> qgis-server
	integration
Message-ID: <4E16B274.2080101@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Geoserver has a so called 'REST'interface: it's possible to push (PUT) a
dataset to the geoserver, and immediately registre it as layer-service

What about bringing something like this (slowly) into qgis:

- given a saved project with mirrored data on client/server: push
'current' qgis-project file to the qgis-server, to immediately have this
project available on the server
- option: for smaller dataset in a qgisproject with relative paths: wrap
up the (selected layer?) data(files only?) in a zip and PUT those next
to the uploaded qgis-project file on the server.

I have a use case for this available :-)
A user with small scanned maps that they want to show in a browser:
- georeference a scan
- view/adjust in qgis
- push to qgis server from within qgis

I would think for a start we can do without full protocol descriptions:
just literally push qgs/data next to server (which has to get adapted to
handle this off course)

I'm aware of a potential security risk here
I know scp, but my users not (and probably on windows-desktops)

Do devs/people see something in this?

How to proceed: write a wikipage for this? Or a feature-request?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Found the solution myself. I indeed missed something (rtfm :) One has to 
set the fetchGeometries flag to False, like this:
 >>> l.featureAtId(571,f,False)
True

Hi Tim

I also like a mandatory workflow for branching, request for merge, integrate 
(and also the unit tests for new features). However, let's discuss the details 
here and let people from the developer team comment if they think to be able 
to work like this. If we achieve a clear consensus, we can write it down and 
then I can do the shouting, no problem.

Because in svn times, we also had a branching / merging policy. But after some 
time, most devs  found it unpractical to develop new features in branches 
only. In the end nobody did it (which I still think is a pitty).

> branch
> write tests
> work
> request for merge
> integrate

For me, this workflow is fine in case of new features. For smaller changes or 
quick bugfixes, it seems unhandy to always write a unit test for it. 
Furthermore we would discourage people from generating small pull requests 
like that.
  
What do other developers think about it?


Regards,
Marco

I think tests for bugfixes are really important as they become a warranty
that the bug you'll be spending time on won't come back in the future.
I don't have a long file of qgis contributions, but the few (single?)
bug I contributed a patch for appeared a few weeks later (the line
orientation detection code). It's been _very_ frustrating.

If providing a test is unhandy it may mean writing a test is too hard 
and should be made simpler. Writing a test for a bug should really be
the first stage of bug handling, it's very like asking the reporter
"can you reproduce the bug?". Only translating that reproducability
in code, which then becomes _the_ test for that bug, linking to ticket.

Not all kind of tests would suffer from this. Core functionality should
not be dependent on GUI stuff, right ? And GUI tests should be on a level
of abstraction that doesn't mess with widget library details.

If it's _new_ functionality you're talking about it would come with _new_
tests and the old you could just drop.

I don't have enough knowledge of the qgis API levels to have a say
about this. Surely the policy should be more specific about at which
level tests for different components should be provided.

Yes, it still is -- I intend to port the processing core to C++ once
it has stabilized. After experimenting with traits it seemed to
complicated to integrate with the rest of the framework, so I dropped
the idea.

There is already a way to do that: Have your module instance signal
"parametersChanged" (for changes in parameter structure/multiple
values or "valueChanged" for changes in single values). Haven't tested
it yet, though.

By interactive I mean stuff like selecting regions in canvas, single
features, etc.

Related to chaining & serialization. (Want to serialize in python commands).

Ok.

Yes that was missing from the list: Nodes are ignored and everything
presented flat. The ParameterList structure was intended to provide
that functionality, but isn't implemented yet.

Thanks for your comments. The I/O thing is more of a saga-specific
issue, I am not sure where & in which format to exchange data.. but
these comments are helping clarify matters.

For me I would consider 'a repository other than the official QGIS
repo' to be a branch. So in the case that Joe decides to clone and
make a small fix in his master branch and issue a pull request, it
should be no problem, In my work pattern when I receive even a small
change that I want to test e.g. Nathans table spacing pull request, I
would add his repo as a remote, make a tracking branch against his
master or branch, and then compile and test. Then I merge it to my
local master and push it in to the main QGIS master. What I am trying
to say I guess is that this is really the natural workflow of Git (and
why we should encorage people to have their own fork). There is always
the GitHub automerge pull request for really trivial changes that
allow you to skip some of the above steps (though Sandro seemed to
think it was the spawn of all evil on IRC :-) ).

In general I agree with your comments - we need to be level headed
about what we write tests for and what we are reasonably able to test.
I don't think your comments  about complex interactions were well
understood by others in this discussion. Particulaly in the
application itelf, a user may go through a complex of steps in order
to cause a bug to take place (e.g. loading a peculiar data set and
then using it for interacting with another data set etc etc). These
things are not easy to write unit tests for, but ultimately many of
them boil down to robustness in the underlying libraries. So in order
to keep sane while we embrace the unit testing, I would suggest that
we need a two pronged approach:

- a methodical writing of tests library by library, starting with
core, gui then analysis
- ad hoc creation of tests for new features that make their way into QGIS

The former is where some funding would be useful to pay a developer
(or several) to sit down and write a simple test for each public
method in each class. Perhaps we can exclude accessors and mutators
from the test coverage.

The latter is where we petition industry who are making use of
contractors, our own developer team and third party contributors to
provide unit tests with new code that will be added to the official
repo.

Message-ID: <CADs9uc9f-V3FykeKhrGFOsuaDNL8mbC1amiB_+NLNsnsfH=vAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to compile libecwj2-3.3-2006-09-06[1] for Mac OS X,  but I
got some errors[2].

You can get the source.

sudo wget http://de-mirror.org/distro/gentoo/distfiles/libecwj2-3.3-2006-09-06.zip

Lee and others managed to compile this ECW library for QGIS 1.7 for Ubuntu.

I think it would to have ECW support as well in Mac OS X.

William, would it be possible to try to compile this library and
package it for Mac OS X users?

Reading from Build.txt, it has support for Mac OS X.

Thanks in advance.

Noli

I'd be willing to take a shot at adding this to the Homebrew package
manager:

    http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew

Is there a homepage for ECW that I could browse for more info?

Here's another source for this library. I think this one is newer
code. It includes the SDK as well.

http://201.22.212.223/ecw/ecw/

However, it is not configure to compile with Mac OS X.

I tried to copy the missing file, NCSGnuSystemDefs.h but it did not help.

Anybody like to have a go with it?

Hope we can compile this for QGIS 1.7 Mac OS X.

You can get all the info and documentation (e.g. SDK) of ECW in this
site (below)

http://201.22.212.223/ecw/ecw/

Yes, it would be nice if you can add this in homebrew.

Thanks.

Hrm, maybe not. From the license file:

Not a lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that is telling me not to add it to
a package manager.

I think we don't really need to do ECW and MrSID support for QGIS  in Mac OS X.

It is already done!

William did this already.

Just remember that I could never get ECW write to work, so my GDAL ECW plugin is read-only.  If someone has time and skills to get writing to work for ECW, that would be cool.

Hi Otto

This might be because the svg symbols are rasterized in the map view, but 
printed as vectors in the composer. Please fill a bug and assign it to me 
(attaching the svg file if it is not already in the qgis svg folder).

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using SVG symbol with modifiable color-widths
Message-ID: <4E1888A3.8020905@gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm try-ing the option to change the color/width of SVG symbol
following instruction in
http://www.sourcepole.ch/


After create the symbol with Inkscape I see the SVG has
this structure:

...
<path
style="fill:none;stroke:#000000;stroke-width:0.1;stroke-linecap:butt; 
stroke-linejoin:miter;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-dasharray:none"
...

so I try to change like this:

<path style="fill:none;stroke:'param(outline) 
#000000';stroke-width:'param(stroke-width) 
0.1';stroke-linecap:butt;stroke-linejoin:miter;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-dasharray:none"
...

Unfortunately it don't seem work.

qgis don't render the symbol.

Because I'm not an SVG expert perhaps I do some odd error.

thx,

Andrea.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bounty hunting procedure
Message-ID: <CALCNqkaf2W2DFYgiWjJ0VGPg-sAoRz4LNzwHe62PTSBH3N4ZRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Further to the thread a while back relating to bounties for bugs, and
some offlist disucssions with Paolo, I have set up a custom 'tracker'
in the QGIS Desktop project on hub.qgis.org. I explain the proposed
procedures below. If the process is acceptible, we wll experimentally
issue a few bounties and see if it works in practice. As always
comments and feedback are welcome. A version of the notes below will
be added to CODING.pdf in the root of the source tree once thy are
finalised.

-------------------- DRAFT START -------------------------------

= Procedures for bounty based bug squashing in QGIS =

== For bounty sponsors ==

If you would like to sponsor the project by donating money to our
bounty pot the process is simple:

- Make a general donation towards the bug fixing effort using the
paypal link on the QGIS web site.
- Notify the project treasurer (Paolo Cavallini) that you donation is
to be used for the 'bounty pool'.
- Sit back and wait for bugs to be closed.
-

Notes:

- The exact bugs that will be fixed using your funding will be at the
discretion of project management.
- You can provide a list of bugs you would like to see included in the
bounty bug pool.
- Factor on between 15 and 50 euros per bug fix as a guideline for how
many bugs can be fixed with your donation.
- The project management will decide bounty values for individual
tickets based on their knowledge of the software and their percieved
complexity of the issue.
- The project management may at their discretion increase or decrease
the bounty value on any given issue over time.
- The bounty donation does not constitute any contract between parties
representing the QGIS project (project management, developers or
independent bug fixers) and yourself.
- The project management reserve the right to alter, reduce, substitue
etc. issues in the bounty programme based on current needs.
- The acceptance of an issue being closed will be made by project management.
- Should a ticket be closed by project management as a result of
efforts of a bounty hunter, a non refundable payment shall be made by
the project to the bounty hunter.
- When a ticket is closed, the obligations of the bug fixer shall be concluded.
- Should a closed ticket later be re-opened, a new bounty shall be
issued and the original payment of bounty shall be considered
irrelevant.
-

== For bounty managers ==

To manage bounties, you need to be approved as an administrator on the
redmine instance at http://hub.qgis.org
Taking into account the number of bounties that can reasonably issued
from the bounty fund, visit each issue to have a bounty and do:

```
Update -> Change Properties -> More
```

Then change the tracker type to 'Bounty' and assign a bounty value.


== For bounty hunters ==

- Ask an administrator to put you into the 'Bounty Hunter' role (you
need to have an existing account on http://hub.qgis.org).
- Go to http://hub.qgis.org and use the bounty query on the right of
the QGIS Desktop project page issues list
(http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=14) to see
open bounties.
- Bounties are listed by monetary value in descending order
- When you see a ticket you would like to work on, change its status
to 'claimed for bounty' and set your name in the 'assigned to' list.
- Do not claim more than one issue at a time.
- When you have fixed the issue (and provided a unit test if it is in
core or gui), mark the ticket as 'Fixed for bounty'
- Wait for a project manager to verify the ticket is resolved.
- Payment will be made to you and the ticket will be closed by marking
it 'Bounty Paid'


----------------- DRAFT END ----------------------------------


I welcome contributions to the above document. Everything should be
set up in redmine for this - we just need to make some tests with real
tickets to see that the workflow goes as expected.

You will notice that I made no allowance for donators to 'contract' a
bounty on a specific bug. I think we will have an administrative
nightmare if we allow this - people who really want a specific bug
fixed should independently contact a developer and contract them to
fix it in my opinion.

Regards

Tim

Hi,

I know that Python plugins is not priority or not part of the SoC QGIS
mobile - Android.

JYFI, PySide for Android is on its way.

http://thp.io/2011/pyside-android/

http://www.mail-archive.com/pyside@lists.pyside.org/msg00473.html

Current version of PySide is API compatible with PyQt.

I doubt PyQt has a plan for embedded / mobile devices (e.g. Android,
Meego, etc.).

Qgis dev will port PyQt for QGIS mobile python plugins?

Any news of PyQt running in Android, Meego, etc?

PySide is compatible with __Version 2__ of the PyQt API. QGIS uses
Version 1 which is incompatible. This could be changed, but would
temporarily break all Python bindings and plugins as all instances of
`QString` and `QVariant` would have to be removed and replaced with
regular Python strings and objects.

It may be a good idea in the long run to make the switch---all
Enthought backed scientific Python projects are moving to PySide and
thus Version 2 of the API along with other modules such as Matplotlib.
It would be great if these PySide/PyQt components were available for
use in QGIS plugins as it would lead to less time spend re-inventing
scientific GUI wheels and more time spent doing awesome stuff with
spatial data.

something happened. after installing a newer 1.8, i can use my

now i have big performance-problems but this sub-forum not the right place
to get help.

Thanks

Qt is much more than a library for widgets. We are using QString, QFile, 
QList, QMap, QHash, etc. all over the place. And also the GUI independant 
rendering is done with Qt in the QGIS core library. Last but not least, the 
GUI independant print composer classes in core are using Qts canvas and canvas 
item classes.

In the case of the symbology, the new one provides the functionality of the 
old one (plus more), but with different classes. I also think it is reasonable 
to drop the old tests, though a very strict testing policy would probably 
forbid that.

Yes, that's very important. 
Outside of core classes, we shouldn't be too strict with requesting tests or 
leave it to the patch authors if they want to add a test (e.g. to avoid a 
bugfix to reoccur, as you described in your other mail).



Regards,
Marco

Just reading your updates - I wonder if it wouldnt be better to have a
different strategy for dialogs on android. In particular they should
rather be simplified and aligned to the user interface norms of the
platform. I don't think the user is going to have a good experience
trying to use the gui dialogs from the desktop, and if you take that
approach you also add a burden on maintainers of the desktop ui to
understand the potential impacts of changes on the mobile platform.
The mobile versions of dialogs could be much much simpler with only
the most basic options.

Just my 2c :-)

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,
we discussed with Marco and we first would like to have the normal QGIS 
running on android (for tablets[say 10"], not thinking mobile phones 
yet) using the normal GUI. Almost all dialogs have vertical scrollbars, 
actually we could find only the layers properties dialog to not have it, 
and we thought that beside being a very simple solution, adding a 
vertical scrollbar to those dialogs would make them more similar to all 
other and users of small notebooks, or netbooks (try opening that dialog 
on an eeepc) would benefit as well.
any thoughts?
for mobile it is another story, there a new app is probably the way to go.

ciao
MArco

Just another comment - I wasnt objecting the vertical scrollbars per
se (we added them to most dialogs in Wroclaw) and I think it is good
to make the layer props consistent with the rest.

Anybody sees anything familiar here? (the QT_QTUITOOLS_INCLUDE_DIR 
problem is due to necessitas not having QTUITOOLS yet), what about the 
others like the openpty one (has o do with CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS(openpty 
NEED_LIBUTIL) )?
any hint is welcome

ciao Marco

I don't think SIP depends on SWIG---it completely replaces the functionality
of SWIG for creating Python bindings.

PyQt depends on SIP.

What is the purpose of SWIG in QGIS? Is for Python bindings? I could
not see any scripting support in QGIS aside from Python.

Again, what is the purpose of SWIG in QGIS if not needed for Python bindings?

Obviously, it is not found :-), we saw that in the error logs.

It is not even needed other platforms aside from MS.

http://osgeo-org.1803224.n2.nabble.com/gsl-bin-swig-redundant-build-requirements-td2047914.html

Swig is needed for ms_export according to TIM.

Hi Marco

Unfortunately, I don't have experience in cross-compiling with cmake.
The following page contains some information about cross compiling for arm. 
Don't know if it can be useful.

Marco

Yes. That'd be 6 man-months. Do you think I'm underestimating it ?

You mean assuming there's at least 20 other people donating as much as
you do ? I can hardly imagine a bugfix (including regress testing)
costing less than 300EUR.

 Hi Richard,

 I can see value in this for certain users, but on the other hand I see 
 a lot of complexity that I do not know how to solve. Servers have 
 different ways to transfer files. My own server only accepts scp/sftp 
 connections, not ftp. In house server are maybe accepting nfs or samba 
 shares, or may even share the same location between desktop and server 
 (in my case) in which no file transfer is necessary. Then there is the 
 security issue with storing login information. In the case of scp/sftp 
 we can do a key exchange, but this also makes the process harder for the 
 user. Also, there are firewall issues. At my employer everything except 
 port 80 and 443 is blocked and we need to go through a proxy. For this 
 reason, my external server listens at port 443 for ssh/scp/sftp 
 connections.

 Next to the .qgs project file and linked data sources, there is also 
 the need to copy symbol or font resources: ttf files and svg symbols.

 And finally: WMS and db resources may be different between internal and 
 external server. I personally use a pg_service definition instead of the 
 hostname. The service name is identical on both servers, but the 
 hostname is different. For WMS servers I do not have a solution. I have 
 to use find/replace for these .qgs files using different WMS.

 Any idea how to manage this complexity? I think it would be worthwile 
 trying to solve the issues, but it is not trivial.

I still have it uncommitted somewhere. Basically what I was trying to
do was to override the path where compiled files are created -- to a
directory structure resembling qgis tree when installed. There is
still an issue with various resources (srs database, svg files etc)
that are outside the build tree. On linux this could be handled by
some symlinks, however on windows we would probably need to copy these
files or use some other tricks.

I believe that many stability problems are caused due to various
unhandled corner cases in the core library. Bugs in GUI are usually
less fatal.

I don't think we need to aim for 100% coverage by unit tests. For me
the most important elements for unit testing are classes which
facilitate data access (map layers, features, geometries, providers
etc) - to make sure that we do not get regressions there.

Right now there is no such possibility since the symbol layers were
originally designed not to know anything about vector layers. Probably
we should optionally pass QgsFieldMap or QgsVectorLayer to startRender
method like we do in QgsFeatureRendererV2.

Hi Camilo

generally I agree with Julien's comments.

I do not fully understand what do you mean with "Module instance serialization".

For me the map layer i/o does not look that hard. In the processing
framework I would directly use the QgsVectorLayer / QgsRasterLayer
instances and pass them to the processing backend. For SAGA backend
the behaviour might be like this:
if the layer data source is directly supported by SAGA, just tell saga
the input file name. If not supported by saga - convert to supported
file type, do the processing and then remove the temporary file(s).
Exporting vector layers can be easily done by QgsVectorFileWriter
class, exporting raster layers may be done using gdal api.

What about allowing specifying different paths for different assets
overriding the default [TREE]/hard_coded_path ?

Could be done with environmental variables.

Those numbers are based on discussions with Paolo at the Lisbon
hackfest - the idea being to clear away all the papercuts / low
hanging fruit first. As the complexity increases, the bounties will no
doubt go up. If I recall, the idea was also to provide a small
incentive for students / new developers to get involved with the
project. Paolo can comment further. So yes 15EUR won't cover bug #9999
'please rewrite all providers in .net' but I don't think that was the
intention.

There is a Fedora package for QGIS 1.7 in the updates-testing repository. The easiest way is to use the spec file of this package and adapt it to your needs.

Nevertheless, Red Hat and EPEL both fail to provide PyQwt and GRASS for version 5. Version 6 should have all necessary dependencies, besides GRASS.

You may also want to take a look at ELGIS. ELGIS will usually adapt Fedora's package, but it will take a couple more weeks for QGIS.

No, no. Just I was not sure if it means that. It is important to know

With all this talk of unit testing and the benefits gained from it,
how would I set up my test environment to run the unit tests I have
developed for my plugin?

For instance, I have a test suite that ensures correct settings are
written and read via QSettings, but naturally QGIS needs to be running

Message-ID: <1310393989.94791.YahooMailNeo@web65613.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello everyone,

I have a problem in QGIS-MapServer 1.7. The result of Identify is blank on QGIS 1.7. 

I found this problem on a clean Ubuntu install of QGIS and QGIS-MapServer 1.7. Since I had another machine with QGIS and QGIS-MapServer 1.6 running smoothly, I did the upgrade to 1.7 on this machine (also Ubuntu) and the same application crashed the Identify feature after the upgrade.
The GetCapabilities continues to show the layers as identifiable (queryable = "1"), however QGIS displays the results in white (see picture). This happens with both point, polyline and polygon features.

Can anyone confirm this?

Thank you!

 Hi Pedro,

 Is the CRS (projection, coordinate reference system) set up correctly 
 in the WMS and in the WMS client? Is the QGIS project set up correctly 
 with the CRS?

Storing "presets" (sets of values for parameters). I think this could be  
either by pickling, generating some XML file, or generating python code  
that reconstructs the instance.

You are right. It seems not too hard. I just wanted to avoid storing files  
(storage space concerns) & was considering ideas like having the possiblity  
of SAGA (or other implementations) tell QGIS which format it prefers or  
understands, so that, say, if one module exports format F and another  
module reads format F, no unnecessary conversion by QGIS is done in between.

But perhaps leave that for later, and now just use the class you mention,  
gdal and ogr.

Thanks for your comments,
Camilo

Hi Marco

AFAIK openpty is used only for grass shell in grass plugin - in case
you are not going to port also grass to android you do not have to
care about that.

Regarding the warnings regarding unknown gcc system - you may try to
compile a simple "hello world" application with cmake first to make
sure you know how to handle cmake-android combination.

I Andreas, thanks for your thoughts.

With this 'feature' I do not want to introduce a solution for all use
cases, but just a (in my eyes) little step in that direction ;-)

In my ideal Qgis-world qgis becomes some kind of round-trip solution:
1) build a nice map in qgis
2) post data + project file to a running qgis-server
3) look/admire at the wms-service using qgis
4) maybe do some adjustments to color/style -> GOTO 2 again

So for example:
- for the transfer of qgs-file and data, I do NOT want to introduce a
new end-point on (or protocol/port to) the server, I want just that
qgis-desktop connects to qgis-server (over normal port 80) and instead
of only GET-ting images and tiles als POST/PUT stuff to the same server.
That is the way Geoserver is working: you just POST/PUT to the same
endpoint, only adding some authentication.

- my use case is smaller scanned historical maps: so no fonts or symbols
needed for that (just a Geotiff in a directory 'myMap' with next to it a
.qgs project file pointing to the ./mytiff.tiff relative to the data)

- off course there will be troubles/details that are harder to handle,
but for example fonts and symbols are/can probably be mirrored on server
and client. Another option would be to put them next to the .qgs-file
and data-file(s) in the 'myMap'-directory

- there are off course troubles with larger dataset which are harder to
PUT/send to a service-endpoint. But 'mirroring' some data-directory on
client and server (/data/qgis/mymap1, /data/qgis/mymap2 etc) would solve
this problem.

- large database keep being a problem (though a ssh-tunnel to a database
and pointing to localhost:54320 in both qgis and server would be a quick
and dirty solution). Your pg_service definition sounds smarter though.

All this will never solve all (my) problems, but it can be a start ;-)

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Andrea

I'm not sure, but it could be the single quotes. Try to change

<path style="fill:none;stroke:'param(outline) #000000'...

to 

<path style="fill:none;stroke:param(outline) #000000...

If it does not help, attach the svg symbol to test. 

And the svg parametrisation works only with new symbology, not with the old 
one.

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SAGA Interface for QGIS - Midterm report
Message-ID: <CAA5P-m1NFdVVcX0SG3h1StAGo4Pe0E050Us4Ls5jRGBBmPW7VQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

This week+, I polished different parts of the module dialog, adding
specific widgets & callbacks (signals) for actions & value changes,
including, e.g. a "FileSelector" widget for paths, and a combobox for
available layers or module specific choices. See screenshot [1].

This will allow the modules to change the available parameters (and
their presentation to the user) in reaction to value changes.

Also, the module instance's state (stopped, running, paused, etc.)
mechanism was implemented on the processing side. This is yet
invisible, because I haven't interfaced it to SAGA (see
`moduleinstance.py`).

This being the last week of the first term, I also tried to look ahead
a little to what expects us during the next few weeks, which are the
most important things that are missing and how to implement them. With
the help from other developers through the mailing list, I compiled a
list thereof [2]. In summary, due during the next term, in my opinion,
are:

  * Data exchange (passing vector & raster data from QGIS to the
implementation, will be done with ogr/gdal), starting now.
  * Multiple value parameters
  * Logging & progress report
  * Module instance serialization (storing "presets" of module
values), also as intermediate step to accessing the moduleinstance
from a cleaner python API.
  * Better code documentation & unit tests.

I hope to also squeeze in some other minor parts (GUI things and such).

In conclusion, I think this has been a productive week and a very fun
first term. I am grateful for all the friendly (and insightful)
comments & criticism I have received. Thanks a lot!

Regards,

Camilo

Hello Andreas,

Yes, I think this aspect is not the problem, everything is in EPSG:20790 (QGIS project, all layers and the project - and wms layers - as client).

In addition, this same configuration worked without problems before upgrading to version 1.7.


Thanks,
Pedro

Hi Pedro,

Is the CRS (projection, coordinate reference system) set up correctly in the WMS and in the WMS client? Is the QGIS project set up correctly with the CRS?

Possible is also a library conflict if you have several qgis libs on your

Hi, I'll just react to this point : the previous vertical scrolling for 
the properties or the general options was screwed (no enough space for 
text leading to an i18n mess)

it is not that hard to prepare QSettings to act as if you were inside
QGIS application. This should be sufficient to pretend that your unit
test is actually QGIS:

from PyQt4.QtCore import QCoreApplication
QCoreApplication.setOrganizationName( "QuantumGIS" )
QCoreApplication.setApplicationName( "QGIS" )

A bit harder may be test code using QgisInterface instance -
preferably the code you are going to test should not use that
interface at all, otherwise you would need to create a mock object
implementing the methods you use.

Hi Marco

thx for response.
it work very well.

Just a little question for fill section.

My symbols was with
fill:none

I try using

fill:param(fill) none

but qgis seem don't recognize it
I guess the 'none' value is not supported right ?

Hovewer thx for this enhancement. It is very useful and save me from 
make many symbols for more colors and more sizes.

Andrea.

Just to be sure, I did the downgrade to 1.6 (ubuntugis-stable repository) and everything is running smoothly again.

So, it appears to be something with the version 1.7.

Nobody can reproduce this behavior?

Thanks again!

Hello Marco,

Sending two shapefiles that I'm using and the project (.qgs) I am trying to publish.

Everything works fine, except Identify tool who does not act as declared in the GetCapabilities (<Layer queryable="1">).


>>Possible is also a library conflict if you have several qgis libs on your system.


I do not know if this could be the problem, because one of the machines I'm running has a Ubuntu clean installation.

Thanks for your support!

Best regards,
Pedro

I can confirm the problem. More in general I have problems to see the
wms layers with the latest trunk versions of qgis(server).

so - maybe it is a library issue? Do you have several versions of
libqgis_core.so ?

This could screw things up with QGIS Mapserver.

In my case, the GetFeaturInfo runs fine - but I only have version 1.8
(trunk)

QGIS already supports overriding of default paths for various assets
by some calls to QgsApplication static methods. Adding the possibility
to override them with environmental variables should be trivial,
however I hoped to avoid an additional step such as passing command
line arguments or setting temporary enviromental variables.

Thanks for your feedback Marco. I guess I'll write some unit tests

there are no other objections. :-)

It could be dangerous to mix up Sandros estimation with the work for a 
complete QGIS test suite. QGIS is heavily GUI based which makes writing tests 
far more complex than writing tests for a pure data processing library like 
PostGIS e.g. My estimation is 2 to 3 man-years for a test coverage of 80%. 
Think of topologocal editing, interactive print composer, image comparison and 
so on.

Hi Pedro

I've tried your example with the packages, the 1.7 branch and the developer 
version. The featureinfo worked for me with the 1.7 branch and the dev 
version, but not with the packages.

I didn't try the 1.7 release sources yet. Maybe it's something that was 
changed and backported to 1.7 (though I don't remember any changes there).

Regards,
Marco

The good thing about using an environment variable is that you could then
also run the real qgis application (rather than just the testcases) from
the build tree. This would help testing fixes that have no associated
testcase (yeah, shouldn't exist, but we're not there yet :)

One thing doesn't exclude the other, so you could have executable testcases
calling the QgsApplication methods but still a QgsApplication allowing env
variables override of that. The override chain should be:

 1. Hard-coded defaults
 2. Env variables
 3. Commandline

Note that my estimation wasn't for full testcases coverage, but just
for setting up the framework(s) and policies allowing coders to _provide_
testcases in an acceptably simple way, and builders to _run_ tests in
an easy way.

Neither GEOS nor PostGIS has 80% of test coverage, but there's all you need
to add yours, and running them all is as simple as 'make check'.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS + CRS:84
Message-ID: <4E1C1DE7.8090100@ign.fr>

Hello all,

We're experiencing a little glitch using QGIS with WMS 1.3.0 layer

The scenario : Open QGIS, Add WMS Layer, Connect to WMS to get 
capabilities, select layer, add layer. Result : No data displayed 
neither in the thumbnail nor in the main map window.

Here is the layer we're trying to display into QGIS :

<Layer>
   <Name>SCANDEP_PNG_IGNF_LAMB93</Name>
   <Title>ScanDEP IGN en PNG</Title>
   <Abstract>ScanDEP</Abstract>
   <KeywordList>
     <Keyword>ScanDEP</Keyword>
   </KeywordList>
   <CRS>IGNF:LAMB93</CRS>
   <CRS>epsg:2154</CRS>
   <CRS>IGNF:LAMBE</CRS>
   <CRS>epsg:4326</CRS>
   <CRS>CRS:84</CRS>
   <EX_GeographicBoundingBox>
     <westBoundLongitude>-7</westBoundLongitude>
      <eastBoundLongitude>12</eastBoundLongitude>
     <southBoundLatitude>40</southBoundLatitude>
     <northBoundLatitude>52</northBoundLatitude>
   </EX_GeographicBoundingBox>
   <BoundingBox CRS="IGNF:LAMB93" minx="57599" miny="5999999" maxx="1289601" maxy="7142400"/>
   <MinScaleDenominator>357.143</MinScaleDenominator>
   <MaxScaleDenominator>4.68114e+08</MaxScaleDenominator>
</Layer>


To try and understand why no data were displayed, I've intercepted the 
QGIS requests with Wireshark and here is what actually happens :

For the thumbnail :

http://domain.com/wms?
SERVICE=WMS
&VERSION=1.3.0
&REQUEST=GetMap
&BBOX=33.000000,-7.000000,52.000000,12.000000
&CRS=CRS:84
&WIDTH=32
&HEIGHT=32
&LAYERS=SCANDEP_PNG_IGNF_LAMB93
&STYLES=
&FORMAT=image/png
&TRANSPARENT=TRUE


For the map :

http://domain.com/wms?
SERVICE=WMS
&VERSION=1.3.0
&REQUEST=GetMap
&BBOX=40.002644,-7.000000,52.000000,12.000000
&CRS=CRS:84
&WIDTH=972
&HEIGHT=614
&LAYERS=SCANDEP_PNG_IGNF_LAMB93
&STYLES=
&FORMAT=image/png
&DPI=96
&TRANSPARENT=TRUE

=> QGIS requests are sent with the advertised CRS:84 but the BBOX are 
actually wrong (the axis order is lat/lon when it should be lon/lat).

However, if we define the SRS using the "Change..." button of the WMS 
layer window everything is working fine.

Is there a bug fix planned for this issue ?

Thanx in advance,

Manu

PS : Yeah i know "epsg" are in lower case ... maybe QGIS doesn't like it 
... but it's been a good way to spot a bug ;)

Hi all,
I've updated my wiki page [1] with the report about the last week.

I've just published the first version of DB Manager (v0.0.1) on the Faunalia

Hello Marco,

I tried on several clean Ubuntu and Debian installations (with ubuntugis packages) and always works with version 1.6 and never with 1.7.

After that I have tested the packages qgis.org/debian (http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download#Ubuntu) and everything works without problems with version 1.7 (both in ubuntu and debian). Anyone confirms?

Therefore, I deduce that it could be a problem in ubuntugis packages or in any of its dependencies.


Best regards,
Pedro


PS: Now I have a small doubt, it is possible to define some of the layers published as not queryable (<Layer queryable="0">)? By default, all layers appear as queryable.

Hi Pedro,
On Ubuntu Natty, I have not been able to use the  ubuntugis packages in
3 machines, but I successfully use a script I posted here to automate
building QGIS 1.7.0 from source:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Talk:Building_QGIS_from_Source

Obviously you would need to change
 local_base_path=/your/path ( a subfolder is created below this)
and
"-DWITH_MAPSERVER=False"
If you try this, I'm interesting in knowing the outcome.
Hope this helps; good luck!

be added in the next release. Meanwhile i ll try to disable it. But what is
it used for in qgis? For Dynamic forms i guess. Anything else?

Hi Marco

Afaik it is used for dynamic forms and also for annotation forms 
(QgsAnnotationItem). Putting ifdefs around things should be fine.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Curved line in QGIS,
 how i can anticipate CIRCULARSTRING SQL-MM3 specification in QGIS?
Message-ID: <CACQya_abHer6qDXVC0HbK0Wbg69+DNXmpp4AOC-N5ezRvcRhhw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello devs,

I'm working on a project to draw simple arc/curves lines to represent (a lot
of ) flow between two points.
I think it's a good idea to use the new geometry type "CIRCULARSTRING"
implemented in Postgis to store/edit the arc/curve, one problem ...
QGIS can't actually draw curved lines...

Actually here my few and poor idea to resolve this problem :

> I use Stefan Ziegler QGIS plugin CADTOOLS to compute and draw any WKT
using the CIRCULARSTRING geometry type, with few point to limit the
complexity of polylines generated

> I'm waiting for the next QGIS dev version, because it seems developper
want to implement this function ( cf QGIS Developer Meeting in Zurich
2011<http://www.qgis.org/wiki/6._QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Zurich_2011>or
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/KCube-developer )

> I'm trying to develop (in python or it's only possible in C++ ?) a new
drawing extension which implement one function to draw pure bezier or simple
arc with CIRCULARSTRING geometry in input ?

So QGIS dev, what's your opinion about that, or your next plan if you have a
roadmap to implement these functionnality ?
If you want to develop this functionnality in this summer, i'm ok to help
and debug the code with you ...

Ps: i have post a question in gis stackexchange,  but no answer actually ...

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/12007/how-i-can-draw-or-edit-curved-lines-in-free-gis

*Thanks a lot GIS community*

I'm using QGIS 1.5 embedded in a Qt application and I currently don't have
Qwt installed on the system. I just download QGIS 1.7 and tried building it
on my system, but it complained about QWT not being found. I read through
the release announcements from 1.6 and 1.7 and neither of them mentioned
that QWT was now required, but was that fact inadvertently left out?
Thanks,

I believe this may be a bug with the 1.7 Windows build. When I do the
following on Windows 7:

    Start Menu -> Quantum GIS Wroclaw -> Quantum GIS (1.7.0)

QGIS starts up fine. If I then pin QGIS to my taskbar and try to start it by
clicking on the icon, I get an error message:

    "The program can't start because qwt5.dll is missing from your
 computer."

So, try starting QGIS through the Start Menu and see if it makes a
difference.

Sorry I forgot to mention this in the original email, but I'm actually
building from source on RHEL 5.5, and I'm running into the issue when trying
to configure the build process with ccmake during the initial setup.

Ahh... I think QWT has always been required---at least since I started
building QGIS from source at version 1.6.

I've built 1.0 and 1.5 without QWT, so I'm guessing that it became required
in 1.6.

In the release announcement of 1.6 ( http://blog.qgis.org/node/146 ), it
states "Replaced raster histogram implementation with one based on Qwt", so
I'm guessing that that might be where the dependence came from. It's kind of
unfortunate that it became a required dependence for such a small addition,
but apparently that's the case and I'll just have to get it installed on all
my machines before upgrading to 1.7.

Thanks,
Dave

I would recommend building and installing PyQwt:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqwt/

It bundles its own copy of Qwt 5.2.1 and is required by some QGIS plugins.
QGIS 1.7.0 will not compile against QWT 6.0.0.

Agreed but there was also a lot of interest for it to be included by
default because a lot of plugin writers are using it. My apologies for
the hassle. If you dont need it we could probably ifdef out the
related bits out and make qgis build without it.

That said are you not using just QGIS core and gui classes in your Qt
app then? I'll need to check but we should not need to link those to
Qwt, just the app.

Tim

Just to follow up on the above:

[gui] ldd /usr/local/lib/libqgis_core.so | grep qwt
[gui] ldd /usr/local/lib/libqgis_gui.so | grep qwt
[gui] ldd /usr/local/bin/qgis | grep qwt
	libqwt-qt4.so.5 => /usr/lib/libqwt-qt4.so.5 (0x00007f568ec32000)

So on my system, only the qgis app itself links to qwt and you should
not need to link to it from your app at all.

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Marking commits with [BACKPORT]
Message-ID: <CALCNqkZHVtDPR3Or7g1782BBgp1vqi5sv5yFwUBMwTs+8NP+MA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Devs

Following on on the 'lets make 1.7 stable' discussions, could we
establish a custom to mark commits with [BACKPORT] if they are
candidates for cherry picking into release-1_7_0 branch? I am happy to
merge them in myself but it will help me to pick out bug fixes and
tweaks that can be pulled into the release branch. I guess [FEATURE]
and [BACKPORT] are mutually exclusive anyway so we shouldnt have any
conflicts there.

If you want to merge your fixes directly into the release branch
yourself that is also fine (but still mark them as BACKPORT).

Thanks

Regards

I didn't realize it was used by so many plugins. I noticed only the single
use of it in the source code and wondered why that warranted it's inclusion,
but the plugin thing makes sense.

I am just using QGIS core, but is there a way to build just the libraries
and not the app itself?

One potential issue with this is that I know that with QGIS 1.0 the
measuring tool didn't work properly in my embedded app unless the QGIS app
had been run on the machine. I'm not sure what caused this or if it has been
resolved, but that could be one reason I would need the app as well.

Thanks,
Dave

Not currently though I guess it wouldnt be too hard to do. If you are
using packages You should be able to install just libqgis and then
your custom app.

You probably need to write the ellipsoid etc options that are normally
written by qgsoptions.cpp or similar. If you look at the measure
maptools you will probably see they use sensible defaults for this. So
just let your app use similar defaults and you should be set.

Ok, right now I think I finished the improvements on the loader. It can now
create overviews, external tables and customized block size.

So I started testing the wktraster loaded with the rt_sql_layer plugin. As
intersection (raster,vector) returns vectors, it's already possible. The
code bellow is an example of how to get a profile from a raster and load in
qgis.

*SELECT foo.rid, foo.gid,
   (foo.geomval).geom As geom, (foo.geomval).val
FROM
    (
SELECT A.rid, g.gid , ST_Intersection(A.rast, g.the_geom) As geomval,
nextval('teste') as mid
 FROM topo2 AS A, "testeL" As g
) As foo
where
(ST_IsEmpty((foo.geomval).geom)=False);*

The result was succesfull, but it's not what I expected. Am I right to think
that it should only give me values on the vertexes? The result was a huge
amount of linestrings, each representing one pixel, I think. It's almost
impossible to view in QGIS.

Well, at least it's working. I think we can split the functions on postgis
raster in two type: geometry and raster returning functions. So there might
be some SQLs that are going to show raster and some that are going to show
vector. I'm still confused as how am I going to make it easier for the users
as this behavior is extremely different from the postgis geometry behavior.

Best regards,
Mauricio de Paulo

Hi

I'm speaking under correction, but last time I read the sqllite docs I
think it was the case that spatialite fields have no type and no
length.

Hi Tim,

you are absolutely right.
SQLite has very loose typing: and the same is
then obviously inherited by SpatiaLite too.

Data-type declarations in CREATE TABLE or
ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN merely are intended
to be "cosmetic", but aren't enforced at all
when performing INSERT / UPDATE

And different "cells" into the same column
can legitimately store any data type at your
will. So, when using SQLite, each single "cell"
surely store some value belonging to a well 
defined data-type, but this doesn't affects 
the column as a whole.

SQLite "cell values" can store the following
'native' data-types:

SQLITE_NULL (self-explanatory)

SQLITE_INTEGER [8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit:
  depending on actual value precision]

SQLITE_FLOAT [f.p. DOUBLE PRECISION]

SQLITE_TEXT [arbitrary length: usually ranging
  from 1 byte to 1MB, but depends on build-opts]

SQLITE_BLOB [arbitrary length: usually ranging
  from 1 byte to 1GB, but depends on build-opts]
 

some useful related SQL functions:
----------------------------------
SELECT DISTINCT typeof(col-name) from tbl-name;
  [useful to identify actual column data-types]

SELECT Max(length(col-name)) FROM tbl-name
WHERE typeof(col-name) = 'text';
  [useful to identify max-length for text columns]

Hi Romain,
the only way I can imagine so to retrieve
field lengths and types is by "sniffing"
them on a first preliminary analysis pass.

You can easily do such a thing using few SQL
queries: and the basic tools to be used are
the ones I already reported on my previous post.

Pass I:
-------
SELECT DISTINCT typeof(col-1), ..., typeof(col-N) 
FROM tbl-name;
  
so you can get the data-type(s) actually stored
into the table/layer.
obviously when mixed-types are found for the same
column, some carefully planned format transposition
is required (i.e. promoting INTEGERs to FLOATs,
transforming numbers into TEXT ...)

Pass II:
--------
SELECT Max(length(col-1)), ..., Max(length(col-N)
FROM tbl-name
WHERE typeof(col-1) = 'text' AND ...
  typeof(col-N) = 'text';

so you can get max-length for any text-type column

----
both them are plain SQL queries, so I suppose
it would be absolutely easy execute them from 
your Python code.

bye Sandro

I am back from 11 days off the grid. I have always viewed the forum as a 
viable support mechanism. My comment about addressing the issue was not 
agreement or disagreement with any proposed solutions, but related 
solely to the need to decommission the current server.

I think shutting down the forum will be a potential shock to many users 
and will no doubt have negative impacts. Forums are a pain because of 
bots and spam, however we have a large number of users that rely on the 
QGIS forum for support and information. Maybe gis.stackexchange.org can 
replace the forum---or maybe not. Either way there are two things that 
are certain:

1 - the current server will be offline prior to August 10, 2011
2 - there will by many unhappy users if the forum goes away

The community and psc need to decide if we are willing to accept #2...

Message-ID: <1310883282562-6591319.post@n2.nabble.com>

I build a custom app with python and qgis bindinds. When I'm opening a big
shapefile (multipolygon) the rendering is very slow and the app freezes. I
also check the same data as spatial layer but the problem still remains.
Zoom and panning are also slow.Opening the same shapefile in qgis is
rendered fast. I'm working with qgis 1.7 What could be the problem?

 no  need to close it. Dynamic is good, people are polite,
questions  aren't  super  precise,  but  valid.  I  should  say I like
answering there much more then on ML :)

I believe that  few power users is not a problem of the number of user support

sure  we will have more people who can and will help as QGIS continues
to  get better and these people will for sure appreciate different media for

I spend more time on the forum than in ML. And there are people more
familiar with the format of the forum.

was painfull as the registration code is extremely difficult to read (I 
took me 10 attempt and the anti bot question hard to reply when you

tooks me while to figure it out)
- let's make it clear that for the dev part, the dev-ML is better suited

On the fr version of the website, I'll add two external links pointing 
to active french-speaking boards.

Will we go with Nextgis' offer to host the forums? Will they also provide an
active moderator?
I think we should first talk to them again before scheduling the data for
turning off the current server.

- let's make it clear that for the dev part, the dev-ML is better suited so

+1. I think this is a really important notion. Let's not continue the dev
part of the forums as long as there is no minimum support from experienced
developers.

Hi 
 
I think that curved line support is not that important to most of the
users. I really would like to see this feature in QGIS. But this is
something that needs some funding and as far as I know some changes deep
in the core. Something for QGIS 2.x I guess.

Sorry, I think i haven't explained well what I want.

I know how to get my fields' lengths from SpatiaLite.

Here is what I've already done:
1/ create QgsvectorLayer from spatiaLite table : vlayer
2/ strore field's length in a python list: lengths

One of my text fields (FIELD1) have 300 characters....


What my problem is when i want to save the layer as mapinfo file with :

QgsVectorFileWritter.writteAsFromat(vlayer,........,mapinfo)

-> The mapinfo File is created but all the fields are truncated at 254
char.... So, I lost informations on FIELD1...

I've tried to set fields lengths for my layer, in order to avoid truncature,
but, it doesn't change anything:

fields=vlayer.dataProvider().fields()
for field in fields:
      fields[field].setLength(301)


Any hints ?

The only thing I need is to pass an option to Qgsvectorfilewritter to change
fields maximum characters...
Does anybody know how to do this directly with OGR ? (within python, of
course)

Um I am confused - it looks like Alex Bruy has already applied that
patch in d750abfa2bfb197cde8e ( http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3866#note-4
) so am I missing something or can we close this?

Hi,
After research, it seems QGIS can draw parametric line with Bezier3D and
parametricLine classes : http://www.qgis.it/api/classBezier3D.html
In your plugin CADTOOL do you use these objects ?
Other question for developer, do you think this bezier3d curve need a
transformation into linearstring for correct rendering ?

Best regards,
SR.

This class is used only for interpolation with curved triangles. It is not 
related to the code that draws line/polygon features.

Hi,

I think this might be useful for creating GUI for Python QGIS plugins.

There is one more way how to use QgsVectorFileWriter:
1. construct QgsVectorFileWriter object
2. call addFeature() for each feature you want add
3. delete the writer object (in order to save changes)

This is essentially what writeAsFormat() function does. But using the
above approach has more flexibility: in the constructor you pass a map
of fields - so instead of using input layer's field definitions you
could change them and set higher (or lower) length, rename some fields
etc.

This will not work because you are changing the length only of the
local object: this change will not get back to the provider.

Another problem could be that the truncation is a limitation of the
format or OGR driver...

Hi

I made a quick test - there are around 11000 references to 'double'
under the src/  tree so I guess it would be quite a major change to
get rid of all double and replace with qreal.

Hi Romain, hi Devs,

My first post on the ML; followed it about 6 months for now... =:0)

Romain, if I've understood you right, I think your problem is not a QGIS but a Mapinfo problem: MapInfo accepts only a max. of 254 character per field [1]. 

So whatever the length is in your DB, a Mapinfo file will never store and display more than the 254 characters. We've got the same problem with Oracle/PostGIS data displayed using MapInfo ODBC connections.

Best regards,
Fran?ois

Sorry, I think i haven't explained well what I want.

I know how to get my fields' lengths from SpatiaLite.

Here is what I've already done:
1/ create QgsvectorLayer from spatiaLite table : vlayer
2/ strore field's length in a python list: lengths

One of my text fields (FIELD1) have 300 characters....


What my problem is when i want to save the layer as mapinfo file with :

QgsVectorFileWritter.writteAsFromat(vlayer,........,mapinfo)

-> The mapinfo File is created but all the fields are truncated at 254
char.... So, I lost informations on FIELD1...

I've tried to set fields lengths for my layer, in order to avoid truncature,
but, it doesn't change anything:

fields=vlayer.dataProvider().fields()
for field in fields:
      fields[field].setLength(301)


Any hints ?

The only thing I need is to pass an option to Qgsvectorfilewritter to change
fields maximum characters...
Does anybody know how to do this directly with OGR ? (within python, of
course)

Hi,

yes I test and then applied Sergey's patch some time ago, because
there are no feedback from other developers. Also I port this bugfix
into release_1_7_0 branch.

Regarding ticket, I think it is already closed (can't check, because
that hub.qgis.org is down now)

I made i too and got scared :) that is why I looked for the other solution.
But using qreal would probably be cleaner. I suppose it is not a big problem
for now.

Hi Martin,

Thank you very much, this is exactly what i needed...
However, you were right...the truncation seems to be a limitation of the OGR
driver/Mapinfo Format.

Thanks again,

Romain,

Hi

Just my 2c:

- +1 for moving wiki into redmin if Otto is agreeable
- Regarding joomla logins - we dont really encourage community logins
/ commenting on posts etc on the joomla site so I would not worry
about spending time on it (for ldap integration I mean). Ultimately I
would like to discard joomla and use our Django infrastructure to do
the content management. Then we would really only be managing two web
infrastructures: redmine and django. But that is something for the
future.
- Regarding the forums I would alos like to get rid of it but have
also come across people in Real Life who have found them (and Anita,
forum Queen :-) ) to be extremely helpful in getting started. I would
suggest to make the forums read only with a big banner asking them to
post to stack exchange rather as an interum solution. Also the fine
folks from the Russian FOSSGIS community (Maxim et al) have offered to
maintain the forums for us if needed.

Regards

Tim

comments on tims post!

> - +1 for moving wiki into redmin if Otto is agreeable

definitely +1 from me .. spreading it all into different pages while the 
infrastructure is already there and could be held on one place is not 
very good (otherwise - single point of failure - but i think thats not 
that important for us).
and of course there will be another move then (svn->git, trac->redmine 
and now wiki->redmine)
I already had some talks with people that do not follow qgis week by 
week that they are a bit confused now where to search for information..
And I should also blame myself having some people asking for a new 
translation language (estonian) and asking if they are correct in using 
SVN ... no wiki page update - or at least there are 3 places to find 
that info ..
So I highly recommend also a consolidation of the Wiki pages and not 
only a move ..

Yeah - allthough I like joomla I feel it's a bit displaced now and I 
myself would have made the suggestion to "redesign" and move the webpage 
to a better place .. and like tim said - as we already have django - why 
not moving it to django (I would like to be a programmer on that place, 
anyone willing to teach? ;) )

As I know that there is always the problem with a lot of forum spam I 
also agree to make it read only and shut it down (within a year or so) 
suggestion with banner +1 - I think people will feel well moving to 
stack exchange .. It's just a pity that we probably will loose all the 
already answered questions in our forum.

I think Anita is the one who will decide as she puts most of her time 
into the forum..

kind regards

Hi,

I agree, we need a simple infrastructure with only a few applications to
maintain. I like the ideas to

- move the wiki to redmin
- make the forums read only and ask users to post to stack exchange
- keep Joomla as it is and migrate to Django in the future. We don't
  need ldap integration here at the moment.

Regards,
 Otto

Sounds reasonable to pass the field map to the startRender method.
I've merged the ellipse renderer branch and will do discussed changes and the 
integration with the simple marker in a second step.

Folks,

with  all  due respect, it cannot fit in my head HOW can you shut down
a  mean of communication that was used for 5000 people and continues to
be used.

Don't  mention  spam, slowness,  login pecularities, hosting  -  these
are all minor technical issues, fixable.

How can you divert all these people to SE which has stunning 131
topics tagged with QGIS? Compare it with 3767 topics on the forum.

If  you think SE is much better - ok, let it outrun forum, so that the
latter will die out gradually.

Maxim

 If SE had existed from before the forum, it would now have 3767 topics :)

 +1 - I'd prefer persuasion to compulsion. Perhaps the forum should
advertise SE for a while, as an alternative, and maybe even suggest
posting to both to see how the response time and quality varies?

 The R statistics project is currently going through this sort of
thing - only instead of a forum the main source of questions is a
1990-s era mailing list :) No images, no proper threading... euurgh!

Could we get a resolution on this:

I've been putting off a Mac dev package for a while, partly while I figure out osgearth build stuff and partly because I don't want to package it without GRASS support.  (I don't want to use the workaround that may only be working by luck.)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Print Composer crashing
Message-ID: <AB701378-2FEE-4656-9CA0-70629A1CCDBA@westnet.com.au>

Hi all,

I'm not sure if this is related to the Print Composer problems being discussed on the user list. Thus far I haven't had the white stripe.

I've been having problems where the Print Composer either
a) causes QGIS to crash out-right, or
b) appears to hang then gives a dialogue saying "bad allocation", which then breaks that composer session, and usually crashes QGIS shortly afterwards.

To replicate, I provide a small .zip file http://www.members.westnet.com.au/ramon_et_al/PrintComposerError.zip
1. Unzip, and open the project. 
2. Using the print manager, open one of the compsers.
3. Export to image. If the geology (filled polygon) layer is in the composer, the the composer will not complete.

I'm having similar problems with printing directly to printer, and to PDF.

I've tried this project out on:
Win7 64-bit using standalone 1.7 install
Win7 64-bit using osgeo 1.7 install (there are debug files from this system provided)
Win7 64-bit using osgeo 1.8 install
WinXP 32-bit using standalone 1.7 install

I'm fairly sure that its related to something specific in certain vector files. For instance the polygon file provided is an excerpt of one that is giving me problems. 

Would it be possible for someone to confirm that I'm not hallucinating?
If there is a problem, is it likely to be that there is something about that file that causes problems? If so, does anyone have any suggestions? I've pointed the f-tools geometry validation tool at it and nothing came up.

Looks like it's feature 0 of BBGeology500k.  QGIS runs out of memory/crashes
when the polygon is drawn in Qt.   I didn't find what's causing this yet, but I
found that switching that layer to symbology-ng helps...

Hi William

I'm not too deep into the topic (but I remember I had to change the wfs 
provider and plugin years ago to avoid direct linking from plugin to provider 
because of the plugin/library difference on OS X ). 

Has there been any change in the GRASS related code such that a direct link is 
necessary? I thought there wasn't any development activity in the  GRASS 
provider and plugin.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Joze,

I'm presuming you wanted this back on the list.

Firstly, I can get this without using ECW or large page sizes or high resolutions.

Secondly, you've got two different problems there.

Large page sizes is a known bug - http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3687 

And ECW support for ubuntu was described quite nicely just a few days back on the user list:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2011-July/012732.html
additionally, try here: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/ECW

Hope some of that's a help.

-ramon.

Thanks J?rgen.

It looks like the symbology-ng work-around will do.

If it helps any, I'm fairly sure that this is another post 1.6 problem.

On a related tangent, what allowed you to identify that particular polygon?

According to the referenced commit in the bug:

"fix windows build by cleaning up (dynamic) linkage and some warnings"

Apparently, the qgisgrass library included a duplicate of the provider source so that it would have the methods needed by the plugin, and it seems Windows didn't like this.

I just ran it in the debugger and it was the very first polygon that didn't
finish.  Filtering it out also solved the problem.

Hi all, I'm trzing to build qgis with no spatialite to simplify the port

-DWITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE=OFF -DWITH_SPATIALITE=OFF but I get this 
error, any idea?

Message-ID: <4E2B494C.4090800@wildintellect.com>

So I've been thinking over the whole SSL thing and based on someone's
email to osgeo I think I've found the best compromise solution.

We can get a free cert from http://cert.startcom.org/
It would be used to secure logins (all logins would be https) on the
various *.qgis.org sites.

Better than a self signed cert and cheaper than a paid cert but works
just as well for something as simple as logins.

I'd be happy to set it up but's its probably better if someone on the
PSC actually signs up for the account on Startcom website.

Thanks,
Alex

Startcom checks domain ownership by sending a mail to postmaster@gis.org or 
webmaster@qgis.org. Who is receiving these mails? I've sent a test mail a few 
days ago and got an error message from google for one of them. MX for qgis.org 
is google.com.

I would guess Gary has control over the emails to the domain and could
setup whatever needs to be done. Maybe emails to those should be
forwarded to the private PSC mailing list?

As of an hour ago, I receive everything sent to @qgis.org. Prior to this there was just some forwarding going on for info@qgis.org to one of my accounts.

Google Apps is handling mail for this domain. I'm not sure I can configure it to forward to the PSC mailing list, however we can add qgis.org email accounts for the PSC/others.

Message-ID: <4876E39E-0CC8-4C4B-87CF-6FE6902D9D12@kyngchaos.com>

I finally worked through OSG and osgEarth compilation on OS X and have the Qgis Globe plugin apparently working.  Now I'm working on bundling of osg/osgEarth in the application for distribution, and I have a couple questions.

Does the globe plugin make use of any osg/osgearth plugins, and if so which?  Or is it transparent to globe and it can use any osg plugins?

How does osg handle alternate paths for osg plugins, and does the globe plugin make use of this?  I guess it would have to something configured for compilation.

Message-ID: <1311567422687-6617101.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hi,

I'd like to allow my plugin's users to be able to create a new SRS ( from a
proj4 string or wkt) within the plugin, and save it to QGIS srs DataBAse.

Is there a possibility to do that using QGIS API... it would better than
modify directly the srs DB.

I've been searching for a while, and no results.

Thanks,

as far as I can recall the plugins are transparent and we have no plugin 
specific code: "The OpenSceneGraph database plugin library osgDB 
automatically loads plugins on demand, using the extension of the file 
being loaded/saved to determine which plugin to load."

You can use the QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem class and its createFrom*
methods.

crs = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem()
valid = crs.createFromProj4( proj4string )

If that CRS doesn't exists yet in the srs database, a new custom CRS will be
created.

Hey Marco,

is it possible that the signals are inverted?

/void QgsComposerView::hideEvent( QHideEvent* e )
{
  emit( composerViewShow( this ) );
  e->ignore();
}
void QgsComposerView::showEvent( QShowEvent* e )
{
  emit( composerViewHide( this ) );
  e->ignore();
}/

The composerViewShow signal is sent with the hideEvent and vice versa.

I think this should be inverse or am I wrong?

regards 

Michael

I am having trouble getting the names of all the bands. When I return

Band 1, Band 2, Band 3 etc... My question is thus is Band 1 always the

But, can an alternate osg plugin searth path be specified from osgEarth, or can this be added.  I can't bundle osg/osgEarth in the QGIS application if not, and must distribute a separate package like my other frameworks (though maybe others would be interested in that).

It depends on the order in which bands was combined into single image.
If red band was first, then Band 1 will be red.

Hi,

I am a complete newbie to QGIS i want to develop C++ plugins in QGIS.
I have integrated Qt to ECLIPSE IDE and i want to use QGIS library in
it.

How can i do it? I installed QGIS on windows using Standalone
Installer. Do i need to build it to use its library in ECLIPSE IDE?

Any help will be greatly appreciated please help me out....

My best advice is forgetting about C++ plugins, especially as a beginning, and start
coding in Python. You can always port your code to C++ later, if really needed.
All the best.

Hi,

Did you read Coding and Compilation Guide [1]? You can find
useful info about creating plugins in it.

Also I suggest you to use Python for plugins.

Hi all.
I have marked several tickets as bounty, so feel free to start grabbing them and
fixing them. The procedure is rather experimental for now, so feedback is much
appreciated, as always.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Running QGIS from build directory
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFfPTg5s2tyrAWuVn7BMxtoHB+reCHfJ6dNLgHj4PfXn-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs

finally I got this done: ability to run QGIS directly from the
directory where you build it. No need to run 'make install' everytime
as it was necessary before. Now it is possible to run/debug QGIS from
your favourite IDE without having to add additional install steps
and/or set custom run command. It's in git master.

Some notes to the solution:
The built executables, libraries and modules are now created in
"output" subdir within your build directory. The rest of the files
(svg, resources etc) are accessed from the source tree. In order to
find out whether qgis is installed or not we look for source_path.txt
file in the path where qgis binary is created. CMake creates this file
with path to source tree. This way QGIS is able to set the paths
properly. There are few new methods in QgsApplication that tell
whether QGIS runs from build directory and what paths are used for
source tree and build output.

I have tested on linux only so far. It should not affect the
functionality when installed. There are few things I am aware of that
do not work right now when run from build directory (though they work
when installed):
- python plugins included in source tree (fTools, installer, gdal
tools, osm) are not visible. Their source files would need to be
copied to some directory so that they see the generated files -
otherwise they would fail to start
- help viewer does not open help files

Comments are welcome.

Hi, I saw that You marked #3771 as bounty, but this one is more
technical problem than lack of money or interest. From my side, no
problem to send 10 EUR. Anybody else interested ?

Neverless, thanks for trying to do something.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Fill and point patterns
Message-ID: <201107260858.14457.marco.hugentobler@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs

Some time ago, I added two new symbol layers for line patterns and point 
patterns. Like this, it is easier and more flexible to create hatches. For 
lines, it is possible to choose color, angle and distance between lines. For 
point patterns, there are options to select a marker type and displacement in 
x- and y- directions.
Technically, those symbol layers are similar to the svg fill in that they 
create an image in the appropriate resolution and set it as a texture to 
QBrush.
The code for it is in the branch 'fill_patterns' in my github clone  
git@github.com:mhugent/Quantum-GIS.git

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Map Navigation Shortcuts ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6+70p4VitGdxjWOQAqpvscs6+xV8Vjd=jZoSm=YOESoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I often use web map client, such as OpenLayers. I really miss key short-cuts
in Qgis helping me to navigate on the map without changing the current tool.
I was wondering if it was feasible in Qgis to set some key + mouse
combinations to handle the map. I am thinking of a new "all-in-one" tool
which will behave this way (or another better approved by the community) :
* drag and drop --> pan the map
* SHIFT + draw rectangle -> zoom into the drawn rectangle
* CTRL + click : identify feature(s)
* ALT + draw rectangle : select feature by drawing a rectangle

I thing this tool would be very handy.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SDA4PP Kernel density troubleshooting
Message-ID: <1311678734524-6621793.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hi,
I use qgis for my thesis at school. The thesis is about a castor fiber and
its presence in some area. My advisor use ArcGIS and, I suppose, a plugin
called Kernel density estimation, which helps analyze the data we have. You
might say, why don't I get ArcGIS? The answer is simple, I am a student and
don't have enough funds for it and also would like to do it on open source
software.
So I came across SDA4PP plugin to qgis and was pretty excited, though
initial excitement faded out after realising quite complex installation
process. Well, after some time I realised there is also a installer taht
contains all dependancies and qgis 1.4.0.
So there's a first question: can I use the plugin not only with 1.4.0 qgis,
but also in 1.6.0 (my current one) or even in 1.7.0?

The second problem, more important:

I have point data in form of .gpx file (points with coords). When I open it
as a vector layer in qgis (waypoints) and try to run "Kernel density" (part
of plugin) or any other like "Uniform density", "Adaptive density" which I
have no idea whate they do, I get the same result. *The error message:*

An error occured:
Error in ogrInfo(dsn = dsn, layer = layer, input_field_name_encoding =
input_field_name_encoding) : 
  Cannot open layer

Though now when I'm trying to solve the problem I'm not getting the same
errors as yesterday (some coding related stuff), still it's not working.
Yesterday there where also some ANSI problem. So I tried to change it
(Mapsource I use to manage .gpx files doesnt have an option to choose coding
of a text in it (ANSI, Unicode,...), notepad has (but opens .csv not .gpx).
But after opening the same stuff, only .csv in notepad I found it's coded in
ANSI. And qgis doesnt open .csv files.
So although I have no experience in using that plugin (and honestly not much
in any way), I cannot even run the plugin properly.

SDA4PP version 0.196

If anyone has an idea to solve this problem and help me out, I would
appreciate it.

yes you can,
the installation of the dependencies for the plugins that rely on R is
tricky under Windows especially, Under Vista/Seven.

You need to use an "old" version of R (2.11, as rpy2 was not yet updated
to cope with the changes in R >= 2.12), add the path to the R binaries
in the Windows "path" environment variable, install the necessary
libraries (see the plugin documentation) and, under Vista/Seven, copy
the folder with the R libraries in another location.

See this wiki page related to another plugin (based on R) that can help
you understand the issues

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/HomeRange_plugin

I also noticed that many times under Windows, when installing R packages
from the R console, it "fail" to install the requested package (but
install its dependencies), so it is needed to re-issue the command.

See here to understand better what I'm saying

after adding your gpx to QGIS save it as a shapefile. Then check if you
have fields (column names) with non ascii letters, if I remember
correctly the plugin do not handle correctly such letters.

I have fallen a bit behind schedule while trying to implement data
exchange. Many issues have arisen, but finally vector output (from
SAGA's perspective) is working. Neither input nor raster work yet.
Next, I'll consider the former, while also fixing some bugs in
parameter selection (especially file & choices).

Having partially implemented data exchange, at least one SAGA module
works: "Pythagoras' tree". At the usual page[1] is a screenshot of

Could you be more specific about the issues you have encountered with
the input/output?

The globe makes use of these osgearth plugins (and maybe more):
osgdb_osgearth_worldwind.so
osgdb_osgearth_tileservice.so
osgdb_earth.so
osgdb_osgearth_tilecache.so

Also a few OSG plugins will be used. But I think there are no optional plugins 
with additional dependencies necessary.

You can set OSG library search paths at runtime with OSG_LIBRARY_PATH or 
OSG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
(http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Support/UserGuides/EnvironmentVariables).
If you want to bundle the libraries together with QGIS, then the cmake 
variables CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and OSG_PLUGINS of OSG/OSGEarth have to be 
changed at least. If you set OSG_PLUGINS to an empty string, the plugins will 
be installed in the same directory as the libraries.
On the QGIS globe side only the OSG*LIBRARY cmake variables have to be 
changed.

Pirmin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] DTclassifier is released
Message-ID: <77239752.20110727140939@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

To follow up on our demonstration in Lisbon.

We  are happy to release our new plugin for streamlined remote sensing
data    classification    in    QGIS    [0].  Initially the plugin was
developed   to   provide   easy  to  use  tool to monitor forest cover
change, but it can be used to classify any type of targets.

Main features:
-  all-in-one, with this plugin only QGIS is needed for all steps of
classification;
-  decision trees,  the  plugin  is  using  computer  vision library OpenCV to
implement  modern  classification algorithm typically not available in
other software packages (both OS and proprietory);
-   performance,   another   nice  feature  of  OpenCV  is  that it is
very fast;
- multiple input rasters and multiple training layers;

Description, examples and sample data:
EN: http://gis-lab.info/qa/dtclassifier-eng.html
RU: http://gis-lab.info/qa/dtclassifier.html

Right now the windows binaries and source code are available.

- OS X apps do not use existing environment variables unless the app is started from a shell, but this is not how apps are started.  An app can still use environment variables if they are defined in the app process.

- when something is bundled in an OS X app, paths need to be relative to the app package because the app package can be moved (OS X apps normally are not locked to a configured path).  osg is configured with an absolute path for plugins.  Same as the library is also not correct since osg is built as frameworks on OS X, so there is no single common library path for the binary framework file (just a common framework path with multiple framework subfolders).


If env vars is the only way to configure the path after compilation, the GDAL Tools plugin has one possibility.  An application configuration option to set the path manually by the user.  This could work in a pinch, but it requires the user to set it post-installation of QGIS.

What's really needed is a compilation method - define OSG_LIBRARY_PATH like QGIS defines its own plugin path and other paths: QGIS application path + one of the *_SUBDIR settings.  this could be done globally without hurting other platforms and would open them to bundling possibilities (I don't know how the standalone Windows QGIS bundles things).  This is simple enough (and there are examples in QGIS already) that I think my minimal C++ skills can try it.

I am just wondering if one could use the following in a spatial index created from the layer provider 

 QgsVectorLayer* cvertexLayer = cVertexLayer(txtStream);
 QgsVectorDataProvider* cvectorProvider = cvertexLayer->dataProvider();
 bool blnSpatialIdx = cvectorProvider->createSpatialIndex();
 
After creating the spatial index file how can I access it in code? 
can I use it in anyway to perform spatial filters for selection purposes?

 QgsSpatialIndex mSpatialIndex = <dynamic_Cast> cvectorProvider; // may be cvectorLayer; 

or may be even directly perform this 

 QgsSpatialIndex mSpatialIndex = cvectorProvider->createSpatialIndex();

 // and then do something like this
 mSpatialIndex.intersects( rect ); 


DO I have to create my own in memory spatial index to perform the above 

what do you think?

Thanks for a support, although I think it'll take me some time to cover and
understand what you're talking about. I honestly was happy, that there is an
installer that contain all needed files (and I didn't need to install all by
myself), because I have no idea, what's going on.

I had installed a R 2.10.1 (or the installer did). So, is it still needed to
install 2.11?

Because I do not understand what this means:
/dd the path to the R binaries in the Windows "path" environment variable,
install the necessary libraries (see the plugin documentation) and, under
Vista/Seven, copy the folder with the R libraries in another location./

Where can I find that path or environment? And by the way, I use Win XP
32-bit.



But, there is at least a small progress. I saved the open .gpx as shapefile,
but there was no ascii in encoding list, so I chose a UTF-8 (just to try
what will happen. And a weird thing is, that in the whole .gpx, there
weren't any non ascii letters. Weird.) and it worked. Now I am able to run
at least a Kernel density, it create an image and also an *error message*:  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Raster file: C:/Documents and Settings/DartVader/Plocha/zk.tif is created.
It seems that the layer is not valid or could not be added to Qgis.
The problem can be related with gdal library or python-gdal binding.
Please check the installation of gdal libraries.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, it seems pretty straightforward, so am I right when I say that it's
needed to replace gdal library with a newer one?



Well, I have no intention to ruin your mood, I'm just not experienced at
all. So, I am sorry, if this whole thing annoys you. 
Thanks for help in advance.

no problem at all


> understand what you're talking about.

not a QGIS problem, installing R under Windows and having it available
system wide is cumbersome. Is easier under Linux.

No, any 2.9 < R < 2.12 should be ok

You can use also R >= 2.12, you'll need a workaround

from 
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/HomeRange_plugin

"R >=2.12: From this version on, the R.dll location has changed, so it
isn't found automagically by rpy2. It raises a Unable to locate R.dll
error. You can fix that by editing or creating the RHOME variable,
pointing to the correct location. See the instructions above, and the
thread on the Animove mailing list"



> the path to the R binaries in the Windows "path" environment variable,

translated:

install R

put the path to R binaries into the "Path" windows environment variable

install the necessary R libraries -> the plugin itself has a tool to
install the R libraries it needs, but I would advice you to install them
with the  R console

if you have Vista or Seven you will have then to copy the entire folder
that contains the R libraries into another folder, otherwise the plugin
will not work (I believe you can blame Windows for this)

from

C:\Users\your_username\Documents\R\win-library\2.12 

to

C:\Users\your_username\R\win-library\2.12

you see clearly how to set it in the screencast I linked in my previous
e-mail.

Unfortunately, I've played the video after I posted a reply. Anyway, now I
know what path have you been talking about. Does the whole process mean,
that after adding it to the path, it will load every time I start windows,
thus it'll run in backround?

And by the way, is the Home Range plugin a competitor to SDA4PP? Does it the
same thing, with same or better results?
Thanks.

no, it means that the (R) binaries will be available system wide -> can
be called from another application

No, it is just another plugin that uses R -> the process to have it
working is the same as SDA4PP.

Today I was trying to view some .5m GeoTIFFs in QGIS 1.7.0 and noticed poor image quality, low contrasts, darker tones, lower resolution than I expected to find. I viewed the same images in QGIS version 1.5.0 and saw the high quality images that I expected to see. Is there a problem with version 1.7 that degrades image quality?

check the (a) raster properties and in "style" look for contrast

can be the source of the problem. If a known bug of 1.7.

Save the option to "no stretch" and it works as workaround when you will

Great, thanks a lot. I know I keep on repeating the same questions, but: do you have
any plan to push it to main source code? Obviously this will allow all QGIS users to
exploit this feature. This applies also to your
http://gis-lab.info/qa/qgis2google-eng.html

Also, why QGIS plugins are not listed here: http://gis-lab.info/programs-eng.html ?

On the other hand, I also encourage interested users to consider sponsoring the
maintenance of this plugin: this will make its inclusion in QGIS faster and more
effective.

All the best.

 Hi Nathan,

 Good to hear that you are working on this.

 I just wonder if it wouldn't make sense to have a general purpose 
 "virtual column" that could be introduced in QGIS. This would be useful 
 for:

 * labeling
 * map tips/QGIS server tooltip display
 * symbology
 * plugins
 * others?

 It would be convenient to use the field calculator, but instead of just 
 writing out to a physically existing column it would create a new 
 virtual column, just like a virtual column in a database view.

 Otherwise one would have to develop the same functionality several 
 times - for labeling, for tooltips, etc.

 Do you think it would be feasible to implement this on a lower level in 
 QGIS so that users could transparently work with virtual columns 
 wherever they want?

 Andreas

Paolo,

we're periodically building new versions of our C++ plugins to keep it
up  to  date  with  trunk  versions of QGIS. This usually happens upon
users request (or client complains :)

We  don't mind having our developments in the core. However, there are issues besides maintaining the
code:
1) specificity, some of the plugins are quite specific
2) dependencies,  recent  development will bring more of them and I'm
not sure if it is ok.

We're  thinking  about building simple installers for Win, but I'm not
sure what would be the best way for Linux.

qgis2google  should  ultimately  be  rewritten in Python, but we don't
have resources for this yet.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Implementing import layer feature
Message-ID: <E0E68500-16F3-4B96-8E66-50329F6E82AC@gmail.com>

Hi devs, 
I'm starting to work on the import layer feature as part of my GSoC. 

The aim would be to add to providers the capability to import a QGis layer into databases. Creating a file is already managed by QgsVectorFileWriter, but I would move that code within the OGR provider. 

This feature would allow users to copy a layer between different databases or to save a layer loaded in canvas into dbs.

I need your opinion about the way I should use to call the provider's import method.

There're at least 2 possible ways to add the import method:
1. adding it as a static method and exporting it, 
2. adding it as a provider instance method.

IMHO the second approach could be better as it could be easily used by plugins too (just add the import method  to QgsVectorDataProvider), instead the first one needs to use QLibrary.

What do you think about it?
I'm abroad until 4 Aug, but I've connection, I can reply to emails.

Would be good start to discuss it now, so when I will come back I can start coding.

Cheers.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python QgsVectorLayer.commitChanges() problem
Message-ID: <20110728084533.313400@gmx.net>

Hi 

I'm trying to add some features with python to an existing postgis layer:

tsplayer.startEditing()     
tspprovider.addFeatures(features)
committed = tsplayer.commitChanges()

The strange thing is that "committed" is "True" even if the features were not added (because of violating a unique constraint) and dialog popped up:

ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "tsp_lv03_nummer_key"

Should "committed" not be "False" in this case?

regards
Stefan

Hi,

+1 for Mayeul Nathan. This "virtual column" would be a very handy tool ! E.G
for labelling

+1 from me too.  A virtual column would be a very handy feature however you
must be able to add one to read only datasets eg MI Tab otherwise their is
no real advantage.  The expression labelling I'm working on works with read
only datasets.   I think the expression based labelling and the virtual
column thing could exist together quite well the former being a short cut in
the labeling gui for the latter.

Check out http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3488 and
https://github.com/NathanW2/Quantum-GIS/tree/expression-labels for the
status of my patch.  I have been away for a couple of weeks but I will be
getting back into over the next couple of weeks.

Anyone else got any other thoughts?

Hi

Since I have not tested your patch yet, it is hard to comment. The
functionnalities I am thinking of for labelling purpose are :
* be able to add uppercase to the first letters of words
* add a line break after the first space after X letters (such as Mapserver
does with WRAP and MAXLENGTH ( http://mapserver.org/mapfile/label.html )
* Concatenate one or more columns with expresssions, such as : colA || '('
|| colB || ')'   (here I am using the postgresql || syntaxe )

Yeah those are possible. Not 100% sure with point 2 but the others can be
done.  QGIS uses || for concatenation too.

createSpatialIndex() method is supported only by memory provider and
by OGR provider for shapefiles. With shapefiles it means that a .qix
file is created with a quadtree structure. Memory provider builds
R-tree (using QgsSpatialIndex class).

No. You cannot access the provider's spatial index. Some providers do
not support spatial indexing, others (optionally) use it, but it is
invisible for the client. When you call provider.select( ... ) and
specify a rectangle, you will get only features that are inside this
rectangle - and if a spatial index is available then it will be used
for faster access.

If you build an application where you need to do lots of spatial
queries it makes sense to load all the features into a spatial index
(QgsSpatialIndex) and do the intersect / nearest neighbor queries
using it.

In your code you are actually mixing two approaches: one possibility
is to use directly data provider to store changes (they are
immediately written). Or you can use vector layer's editing buffer:
call startEditing(), call some methods that modify the layer and
finally call either commitChanges() or rollback(). Until you commit
the changes, they are only in memory. In commitChanges() they are
written to the data store using provider's methods.

Getting back to your code: first you start editing, then directly
write features to providers (that fails) and finally commitChanges
from layer's edit buffer (which is empty). That's why commit returns
True - because it did nothing.

What you probably want to do:
- in case it is an interactive tool you should use the vector layer's
editing buffer (i.e. call QgsVectorLayer's editing methods). Also you
might make your tool available only when the layer is in editing mode
and leave the decision when to start editing / commit / rollback up to
user - the user then may use also undo/redo functionality.
- if you are working on a data processing tool you probably want to
store the features directly without messing with the layer editing
buffer - then you are better off with using vector data provider.

For now I would go with the first option since it is less invasive.
The functionality could be used also by plugins: a simple method could
be added to QgsProviderRegistry that would do the QLibrary magic.

The problem with the second option is that we would need to create
dummy provider instances that do not actually open any layer, they
just make a connection. I know this happens already in WMS provider
for data items, but I am not particularly happy about that because it
creates a mess. For a real solution we would need another interface.
Look at OGR library for an example: there is OGRDataSource interface
that lists layers, opens layers or creates new ones. This is missing
in QGIS. We need an abstract "data source" class that would
encapsulate a connection to database, to a web service or to a
file/directory. These data sources would be implemented by each data
provider and they would also provide new layer and data items
functionality. However such changes need more time to complete, that
is why I would stay with the first option.

I am wondering what other devs think....

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Composer template: autoUpdate field for
	ComposerLegend tags
Message-ID: <4E314410.3090402@bc-consult.com>

Hi Devs,

When Composer loads a template (*.qpt) file it does not honour the
"autoUpdate" flag of the ComposerLegend Model tag.
The autoUpdate is always activated, even when set to 0. The user has
then to redo all the legends present in the template, defeating the
usefulness of having a template at the first place.

But, from inside a Composer tag in the QGIS .qgs file the autoUpdate
value is honoured by the Composer.

Is this behaviour to be expected or is it a bug?

Keep on the good work.
Benoit

Hi Paolo,

1 - please file a ticket
2 - I see three different solutions to this issue:

a - change the field string label from "Author" to "Maintainer" and change
the author from the admin panel to match the current maintainer, this would
of course loose the information about the original author, but you can
always put that name into the description
b - rename existing "author" field to "maintainer" and add an optional
"author" string field (alter DB schema), no need for the author to be an
existing user
c - add a new (mandatory) "maintainer" field (alter DB schema). This option
requires that both author and maintainer are existing users. The maintainer
and the author could be the same user.


solution "a" is a trivial hack/patch.

solution "b" and "c" require much more work: the permission system is
tightly coupled to the plugin's author and changing that code  means that
all the models and the views have to be carefully checked and refactored.

Thank you, Martin for your explanation. I ahve one more followup question.

Can the spatial index be composed of features other than points? I do not see any restriction in the documentation. Can I use features such as lines and polylines in an in-memory spatial index and use these as one uses points? 

Thank you,

Maaza

Yes, you can use lines and polygons. Spatial index only uses bounding
boxes of the geometries to for the queries. Therefore also
intersection query will return features that have bounding box of

I have just tried it (from master) and it adds very useful
functionality to new symbology!

I've been having a lot of problems sending signals from python to C++,
can anyone please just give me some sort of example on how they did
it. The main thing I want to do is send points from a gui to a custom
C++ class...

Please help as I have been struggling for days now.

Thank you in advance.

Thanks again Martin. I was able to use it effectively for my needs. I am delighted to have you guys to help. Many times because of the lack of available documentation, your experiences are invaluable and it may be the one that would make or break a person's patience to do plugging along in QGis. 

I did also benefit greatly from Sergey Yakushev's road graph plugin. I did not realize that one can setup a plugin Gui fairly easily once cmakelist file is modified by disabling the dummy plugin's ".ui" file. That file, while it is meant to help one use the designer, many times it makes it harder to manage all that goes on in the internals. Unless a person is well versed in QT Designer and, I must say, uses QT for compiling, I found it to be a bit awkward to use in Windows. I learned about making a dockable widget, writing defaults and storing variables in the project file, etc.

Sergey's programming ability is very impressive, I wish I could be like him. But I am thankful that he shared his knowledge and work with me. I am glad I was able to glean a lot from him and learned a bit about the internals of QGIS. There are still many things that I do not understand how the program works but it is an excellent work worthy of a QGIS award. Is there something like that? 

One question I would ask Sergey is, why RoadGraph runs out of memory when I include more data. It works if the dataset is relatively small. But as soon as I increase the extent of the data, the program quits. I looked at the code and there is a number of points allocation that seems to be set at twice the size of a certain estimate. But I did not want to attempt to bungle an excellent program. It took me almost two month just to grasp what the program was doing, and yet there are still things that I still do not understand. But it has helped me comprehend many things including interaction with the canvas, and of-course the question I asked about spatial indexing came after looking at the road graph code of creating an in memory index.

I still would like that one should be able to create and access indices to perform spatial analysis fairly easily. For doing GIS work one must perform these actions many times not just from a single geometry, but in groups. So my humble request is to place a function function (perhaps in QgsSpatialIndex that will take a data layer and return a spatial index. Also it would be helpful for those with less memory, and highly memory intensive work, to allow access to the spatial index disk file for similar use in place of memory index. It may be a bit slower than an in memroy version, but it should do just the same as the other.

What do you think,

Maaza

Hi, thanks again for your quick reply and at the same time I appologize for
my late answer.

I went through your video tutorial many times to be sure, that I didnt do
anything wrong and doing so, after start of a home_range plugin and any type
of calculation I bumped to an *error msg*:


R error (please consult its documentation) is:
Error in function (x, method = c("mcp", "href", "lscv", "hadj", "clusthr", 
: 
  This procedure requires adehabitat to be installed


I don't get it, really. After all I upgraded to a gqis 1.7.0 and R 2.11.1
and did everything like shown in the video. And eventhough I have Windows
XP, I copied the R libraries into a different location (also by that time,
replaced the original path to the R in the windows PATH by the new one. It
must be also said, the I tried to run home_range with the original path and
after the change, and still with same results.)

And also the adehabiat, I installed it like for three times, although I
didn't have to. It was succesfully installed the first time. So, the
home_range plugin doesn't work for me now.


But not to be only negative, I thing I managed to find out the center of the
problem from my first post. If you remember, I couldn't run the SDA4PP
without error msg: "blah blah....don't use ascii letters...blah blah ". So I
thing, the problem was not only in a coding of the file (.gpx or .shp), well
it might play its role too, but mainly because those non ascii letter must
not be in the path, where the plugin gets the data from.

So in my case, in the time of the error msg, it was like this: "C:\Documents
and Settings\DartVader\Plocha\EVL Ch_luh\*zkou?ka*\test SDA4PP\gh.shp"

As you can see, there is "zkou?ka" with non ascii letter "?". After renaming
it to anything else without diacriticals, the plugin works correctly.

is not that hard, there are qgis plugins that R based, and this usually
means that you MUST install a number of *R* libraries and their
dependencies. If Windows make things hard is not QGIS fault.

If you have XP then you don't need at all to move the R libraries, only
Vista and Seven.

adehabitat is a dependency for the Home Range plugin, not for SDA4PP.

Well, I know. I just tried to install home_range, because I thought you were
directing me to that plugin. Nevermind, I might try reinstall windows in a
few months and then try it all again. But you know, not a pleasant stuff.

Anyway thanks for all your support, at least you tried, but the working
sda4pp plugin was and is the nuber one of this thread.
Bye.
