Hi Tim, all,
I surely miss something here, but what is the reason for our system? I
have seen an interesting recent attempt by Salvatore:
https://github.com/pigreco/changelog312
which looks much easier to implement and update.
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] changes in QGIS development with git
Message-ID: <DB7E2C85-8B22-4A06-8386-2A359B366377@kyngchaos.com>

It's been a couple years since I made a commit with git, and I find that I can't do that any more.  It appears master (and branches?) are locked so that only travis-ci-validated commits can be pushed.  That means I have to use a github fork and make pull requests, yay.  I just want to make sure I have this correct now.

I figured out how to reset my 8 year old fork to current master.

The PR process from my years-old notes:

1. merge upstream changes to my fork

2. make my changes

3. push my changes to my fork

4. make PR to qgis upstream

5. (new) wait for travis-ci to succeed

6. merge PR

One thing I'm not sure about is backporting.  I've seen [Backport] tagged messages from Github.  And I recall talk about problems with the automated backporting bot/app (fixed?).

How do I handle backporting?  Most of the changes I need to make need to be backported.

Hi Jo,

Glad to hear it is working for you now! I also found the UI testing of this
widget to be quite finicky.

Regards,

Hi

That’s a bit of an odd question Paolo, I’m surprised that you would ask this….and also a bit surprising that Salvatore did this work without collaborating with us. The changelog we have built and operated for many years now allows for collaborative editing of entries in a structured way, properly edited for end users to read nicely and sorted into different categories with a feed that can be ingested into QGIS.org <http://qgis.org/> where it can be translated into multiple languages. And for the next release we will pull in the items automatically too so his work won’t really add anything that we don’t already have.


Regards

Tim

What makes the situation even more troublesome is release of dependencies at yet another schedule. So all too often we find ourselves stuck after a routine system update, with unresolved dependencies and partially or totally unusable software. This has happened with QGIS and the grass plugin, and recently with updates to proj4 and gdal.

Actually, a 2 year cycle will make this far, far more problematic.

An example is the proj library. QGIS 3.4 was developed using the older
proj v4 library, and while it's possible to build it using proj v 6 or
v7, it's not far from recommended. When proj v8 is released then it
will become completely impossible to build QGIS 3.4. If we tried to
squeeze another 12 months out of QGIS 3.4 then we'll bump into all
sorts of linux packaging issues as the underlying linux distros
upgrade to proj v6 or later. And that's completely out of our
control...

the PR must be labeled with "backport _branchname_". If you cannot define
the label (rights) just ask for it to be labeled.

Hi,

I made a fix recently in this widget, I'll take a look in the days to come (maybe today if i
find time).

Goodmorning everyone,
I'm sorry I didn't follow the official mode, but I didn't find any trace of
it in the thread.

I read that there was a need to help and I did it the way you know.

I will have made a mistake, I will have been rushed, but I did not think
that my work could be considered as a "non-collaboration with you".

I thank you for what you do and I will continue to collaborate.

Thanks Paolo for your interest, you are the only one who has considered my
work even if it is useless in the eyes of others.

I made the changelog in three days as it does not seem fair to me that QGIS
3.12 comes out without changelog.
Many friends ask me: what's new with 3.12 ??
what do I answer ??
I preferred to scratch the data and make the changelog.

Thank you all, I respect you very much for all the work you do.
W QGIS.

Hello, Nyall,

thank you very much for the quick reply! I thought that this problem would be very difficult to solve without test data.

We will try to provide appropriate test data to reproduce the problem. However, this may take some time.

Best regards
Josef

It's certainly a challenge! To be honest, it's almost impossible to dig further into this without some example data and workflows which can be used to test with. There's already a decent unit test coverage of this functionality, and the automated tests have not detected any regressions. This leads me to believe it's a corner case you're hitting with your particular dataset and inputs...

Hi Salvetore


Thank you for your email, and I didn’t mean to be rude to you in my reply. But I meant non-collaborative in that you did something different to the normal way of doing things without sharing your plans with anyone else or e.g. talking to others in the community, saying ‘hey I have this idea for a better way of doing the changelog’. What you made looks really nice but the changelog has a whole bunch of other workflows that stem off it for publishing the information to QGIS.org <http://qgis.org/>, making available for translations, cleaning up the text, acknowledging funders, etc. which it doesn’t replace. So now we have flux because people think there are two systems. All we need is for people to simply mark PR’s with the Changelog tag and we would get the same outcome (ok without some of the other nice goodies you have made for stats etc). And then those same entries will appear on the changelog site and others can do the other parts of the work flow.

Best regards

Tim

Hi Again

By the way your filter URL link for the new features (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afeature+merged%3A2019-10-25T00%3A00%3A00Z..2020-02-21T00%3A00%3A00Z <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is:pr+is:closed+label:feature+merged:2019-10-25T00:00:00Z..2020-02-21T00:00:00Z>) was a great help thanks Salvetore - I used it to apply the Changelog tag to all of those features.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Confusion around 2 ways of importing/exporting CAD
	data
Message-ID: <859734a4-b665-5c71-8a3a-a75ea5913d40@carto.net>

Hi,

In QGIS we have 2 ways of importing and exporting CAD data:

1. Through QGIS native, using a modified version of libdxfrw: Menu 
"Project" --> "Import/Export" and "Export Project to DXF" or "Import 
Layers from DWG/DXF"

2. Through OGR: If you right-click and "Save As" for Export or "Load 
Vector Layer" or drag and drop into QGIS

Now, most users aren't aware of these two methods. While the first 
option generally gives better results, people tend to use the second 
method more often, as this is how they treat other data format.

I think this situation is not ideal and Giovanni has to deal a lot with 
such issues, where people try the second option and run into issues or 
are disappointed, because styling/labeling/blocks are not treated well.

Any idea how we can solve this? Can we disable OGR import (the second 
method) and re-route the "Save As" way to our nativ export?

Thanks if you have any ideas how to improve the situation.

Greetings,
Andreas

I agree, duplication is confusing. Is anoyne aware of any case in which
the second option is actually useful?

The second option has mainly the following advantage:

- The import is "live" meaning it is not importing into an intermediate 
Geopackage file

- if you don't care about styling/labeling, but only raw geometry then 
it might work faster

Maybe there are more differences that I am not aware of.

Hi Andreas,

also Processing relies on the OGR way.

Exposing native DXF import/export in Processing is in my TODO.

given the fact that we failed to deliver the changelog in time for the
last two releases I'm asking myself if perhaps we didn't do something
overly complicated, making it difficult for others to contribute.
If you believe we can recover full functionality in a reasonable time
span, please disregard my question. I did not mean to diminish the value
your work, of course.
Cheers.

Thanks.  I can add labels.

First one failed travis-ci.  Which is odd... failed a test completely unrelated to this change.

Hi there,
thanks.

I have seen such type of questions and problems like below a lot,
and specifically in GIS and computing; certainly in (complex) optimizations.
So as a cautionary note, it must be documented very well (Metadata),
and benchmark data should exist and with standard solutions
for a check and with reasoning provided.

Very best
   Falk Huettmann

OK, this is getting annoying.  It appears I have to either:

- wait for each PR to be merged before making another

- do some branching process I read about for each commit to make a PR

Because until the PR is merged, my fork stays ahead of upstream for all commits, and when I try to make a new PR it includes all commits I've done to my fork.

I tried reseting my fork to make another commit + PR, but the reset closed the previous PR that was waiting for tests  and merging.

This is too much of a hassle, maybe I'll just dump all my changes into 1 PR.  They're all Mac packaging fixes, though each stands on its own.  I just wanted to have them discrete.

Message-ID: <D2417C80A342B246BEAF2C90A301E0AF771D10AD@MailNT.vogelwarte.ch>

Hi

I'm migrating a Web Application from QGIS 2.18 to QGIS 3.10. In the old application we used UserLayer-parameter in sld_body in WMS request to add a custom layer (raster) to the request. The syntax is the following:
SLD_BODY : <SLD units="mm"><UserLayer><Name>scans_17273</Name><HostedRDS uri="/home/research/vogelatlas/data/scans/2019/3/inventory_17273.tif" epsg="2056"/><UserStyle><Name>style</Name></UserStyle></UserLayer></SLD>

This was working perfectly with 2.18, with version 3.10 the layer is not displayed. In the error log there is no error but the result of the request is:
<ServiceException code="InvalidCRS">Could not create output CRS</ServiceException>

Does anybody know if UserLayer in sld_body is still supported in QGIS Server 3.10? How is the exactly syntax?

Thanks in advance for your information

Luckly a PR can contain multiple commits, so your changes
can still be discrete, and the PR subject could be
"Mac packaging fixes"...

Add a note to the OGR dialog?  Maybe just appearing if select DXF/DWG - I'd not
block the option.

Message-ID: <D128C0F9-2AF3-477E-84EA-1021C6700AAB@kartoza.com>

Hi Friends

I have finished putting all the candidate entries in the changelog page (https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.12 <https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.12>) and would like to post it on the QGIS feed. Can anyone who is interested to help please take a pass through, in particular to:

* Improve English
* Remove artefacts from PR discussions
* Add screenshots or GIF animations

If you need permissions to help with the above, just let me know. Note you don’t need any development skills to help with this, just a good grasp of QGIS and the English language, so QGIS Users who are feeling an itch to help, here is a good place to scratch! On Friday night we can then pull the changelog through to the web site.

Note also: For people making PR’s and PR reviewers it will be really great if you can spend some time and effort on putting nice descriptive information and screenshots on every PR that provides an interesting feature. If the reviewers could block PR’s from being merged then that would be awesome - come release time we can just pull all the descriptions over and publish the Changelog with minimal fuss. The documentation team will also be grateful when they pull the feature descriptions over so it will be a double win.

Thanks

Regards

Tim

Hi

Ok no problem  Salvatore, thanks. Another useful place to help which does not require English is to make screenshots of features that are missing them (or small animated GIF’s if they help to illustrate the feature better.

ok, I can take care of the missing screenshots and/or animated gifs.

OK, now a backporting problem.  The backport run appears to be failing because it can't find my repository.  But the merge had no problem finding my repository.  huh?

For 2 PRs now.

You should rename your fork. You are still using the old name "Quantum-GIS"
and not QGIS ?

Hmm, yes still old name.  But the original PR succeeds.  Shouldn't the backport bot use what's in the PR that defines the fork?

Dear Toto

Thank you so much for this! Could I ask you to make your improvements directly to the changelog? Just share me your username and I will add you to the editors group. I really appreciate your help, thank you.

Hello.

I was able to build it in Visual Studio 2017 doing some changes at the
scripts.
However, I can't get any oracle support. The button is not present at the
layer browser window and in DB Manager I get this error when try to connect
to any oracle database:

2020-03-03T14:20:48     CRITICAL    Qt : QSqlDatabase: QOCISPATIAL

2020-03-03T14:20:48     CRITICAL    Qt : QSqlDatabase: available
drivers: QSQLITE QMYSQL QMYSQL3 QODBC QODBC3 QPSQL QPSQL7

There is also other erros on startup:

I used these
<http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html>
instructions.
And also looked here
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/ms-windows/osgeo4w/package-nightly.cmd>.
But no luck.

Now I'm trying different oracle parameters when creating the vs solution.

I don't have Oracle Client installed at my machine. But if you go to their
website
<https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/winx64-64-downloads.html>,
you can see they now provide the OCI dlls without any installation at all.

At my last attempt, I download the latest version and tried to generate the
visual studio solution with the following parameters in *msvc-env.bat*:

path %PATH%;D:\Ferramentas\oracle_instant_client\instantclient_19_5
set OCI_INCLUDEDIR=D:\Ferramentas\oracle_instant_client\instantclient_19_5
set OCI_INCDIR=D:\Ferramentas\oracle_instant_client\instantclient_19_5
set OCI_LIBDIR=D:\Ferramentas\oracle_instant_client\instantclient_19_5
set ORACLE_HOME=D:\Ferramentas\oracle_instant_client\instantclient_19_5
set ORACLE_INCLUDEDIR=D:\Ferramentas\oracle_instant_client\instantclient_19_5
set ORACLE_LIBDIR=D:\Ferramentas\oracle_instant_client\instantclient_19_5

Also in *qgis\CMakeList.txt* I did this edit:

IF(WITH_ORACLE)
    SET(HAVE_ORACLE TRUE)
    SET(ORACLE_INCLUDEDIR ${ORACLE_INCLUDEDIR} CACHE STRING "Path to
OCI headers")
    SET(ORACLE_LIBDIR ${ORACLE_LIBDIR} CACHE STRING "Path to OCI libraries")
  ENDIF(WITH_ORACLE)

To be able to compile and run the program in visual studio, I had to copy
all qt5 dlls, proj_7_1.dll and gdal301.dll to the output diretocry.

I also noticed that \OSGeo4W\apps\Qt5\plugins\sqldrivers does not have the
OCI driver.

Anyway, can someone point me exactly what I have to do to build qgis in
windows with oracle support? I need to fix this issue
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/24539>

Thanks

This is very frustrating.

I renamed my fork so it's what the backporting bot expects.  I then removed the backport labels from my PR, then readded the backport labels to trigger the bot.

So, it now runs without the missing repository.  Now it fails with an exit code 128.  And gives me commands to run to manually backport.  I don't need this nonsense.  If it gave me the exact commands I need to run, it can do it, if it's the same as what it does but fails, why tell me to do it?

Then there's the first PR I did - the backport there won't work now anyways, I reset my fork to make the second PR so it doesn't pick up the commit in the first PR, so the first commit doesn't exist any more.

And I still have the rest of my changes (that I figure I'll do in a batch PR to try to avoid more hassle).

If it's just a buggy backport bot, then that's bad timing on my part, after all my dwindling spare time it took me to get caught up on my Mac build, I get this.

... pardon the venting there.  I hope someone can help out.

It is. The bot got seriously crippled by an upstream change, and now
it's a coin toss on the results you'll get.

My advice - just do the backports by hand. That's what I do.

I plan to give another approach a try during the HF.
The idea would be to use a CLI tool (https://github.com/sqren/backport or
https://github.com/chainer/backport) which would be run a cron workflow.
Using a cron will avoid the issues of PR from forks (the workflow user has
rights to create branches).
Hopefully these tools work better than the current bot.
The only drawback I see up to now is that you'll have to wait for the cron
to start (30min?).

It looks like the bot fails on cherry-picking merge commits and would 
(likely) do fine if a `-m` option was provided - at least that's what's 
missing from the commands in the comment.

Maybe it's as easy as adding this?

it still depends on "merges" instead of rebases... and I'm not a fan
of merge commits in general. They really make the git history messy
and difficult to read...

Hi,

It seems you don't have oracle instantclient (oci) installed in a
place where QGIS could find it.

If you take a look in CMakeCache.txt (in your build folder where there
is qgis.sln), you need to have this two lines correctly set

//Path to a file.
OCI_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=C:/OSGeo4W64/include

//Path to a library.
OCI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=C:/OSGeo4W64/lib/oci.lib

I think you need to install the two package oci and oci-devel with
OSGEO4W installer et restart package.cmd (or package-nightly.cmd).

Regards,
Julien

Then it was too good to be true. I miss the old backport bot.

I am generally a fan of merges, mostly because they provide a missing 
link from "a set of commits" to a "consolidated feature" aka pull 
request with discussion. We don't have that with rebase merges I think?

Just tried.

It's not perfect in that it doesn't list the individual original commits 
in the new PR (as mentioned by Nyall).

But it works which I'd say is better than the (frustrating and tedious) 
situation we currently have.

FYI,

I opened a pull request on the action 
https://github.com/Gaurav0/backport/pull/41

Fingers crossed this makes our lifes easier again.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers does not seem
	to use optional parameter
Message-ID: <CAKXEUWMb-DjdffzVirgRj2vhj5eqdKRUH9UMO1YT+YCe8ydGqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I develop a processing algorithm for the toolbox. One of my parameters a
list of vector layers of type line, so in my initAlgorithm function I have
this statement:

        self.addParameter(
            QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers(
                self.INPUT_LINES,
                self.tr("Lines"),
                QgsProcessing.TypeVectorLine,
                optional=False
            )
        )

However, even if the optional parameter is set to False, it seems the user
can still set an empty list: so not setting anything actually. So for me,
this optional parameter doesn't work in this case.

Am I missing something here or is it a bug ? In this last case, I can
report it on github. I'm using QGIS on Windows 3.10.2-A Coruña

Thanks,

Jean-Charles

I guess that an empty list of layers is regarded as acceptable,
as long as the parameter is present in the call.
Perhaps you can use setMinimumNumberInputs to achieve what you
want?

Something like:

           self.addParameter(
               QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers(
                   self.INPUT_LINES, self.tr <http://self.tr>("Lines"),
                   QgsProcessing.TypeVectorLine,
                   optional=False
               ).setMinimumNumberInputs(1)
           )

So I was missing something, thanks Håvard !

The working code is a bit different as setMinimumNumberInputs returns void.
I put it below if other people are running in the same issue:

        parameter = QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers(
                self.INPUT_LINES,
                self.tr("Lines"),
                QgsProcessing.TypeVectorLine,
                optional=False
            )
        parameter.setMinimumNumberInputs(1)
        self.addParameter(parameter)

Hi all,

I would like to know if there is a documentation for contributors for the
resource sharing plugin.
Mainly:
1) How to structure the repo?
2) What are the rules/guidelines to get it listed from scratch?

cheers,
Denis

Message-ID: <CAN6zawXg7jU3441aS4LTYk-1u6vAzO1nu-FYJp1zHbDMpJ0CVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am very new in this group and have a question you may be very familiar
with. I am trying to add 'Clip raster by mask layer' tool to processing
modeler and download DEM data from an online resource but so far there is
no luck.
Does GDAL works in Processing Modeler? If yes what is my problem?

I tried to use 'Download' tool but it does not have clipping option and
downloads the entire data.
The main question is 'how can I download a part of DEM from an online map'.

Regards,
Frank

Hi Tim,

I just checked the changelog, there is one mistake[1]. This feature is not
merged yet[2]. Probably merged for 3.14. Should I delete it?

Best regards.

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_E+ReLtFMSpEbzNVv5ivoEhQR8PQk=eqFKMG67oRA1zuA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there a way to use PyQGIS to open the Feature form in multiedit mode for
the active layer selected features? Or do I have to recreate the form like
it's done in here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/qgisapp.cpp#L9236

Thanks!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Storing topology information in a vector layer
	(format)?
Message-ID: <CAFcOn2-uE---uF_=TDOKsMX4xmVDCzkef6VzrP8mt_ihP_SErw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is about processing either an area mesh (tesselation) layer. Area
meshes are topological structures and issue is that most spatial data
formats - other than TopoJSON and E00 - are non-topological.

This in means, that a data reader has to infer the topology from
geometry (which requires exponential computing time), and even worse,
that potentially there are topological errors (like gaps,
overlaps/slivers). The built-in "Topology Checker Plugin" of QGIS [1]
does the validation preprocessing step.

Are there any ideas to store topology in a polygon vector layer (e.g.
as array of features IDs to reference polygon neighbors), so a reader
(a PyQGIS function/extension) doesn't have to rebuild the topology
every time?

You may try storing your topology in a PostgreSQL database using
PostGIS Topology.

Grass and postgis support topology, you can use qgis a front-end for them.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GSoC project scope discussion
Message-ID: <CAGiKOujY24K2CzOZA1wVs_G-McxsXOUvxP-bJunUEQ3P6om9NA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello QGIS developers,
I am Nedjima Belgacem, a fourth year computer science student at
ESI-Algiers (Ecole supérieure d'informatique), Algeria. I am willing to
contribute to QGIS project by working on QGIS 3D features as a part of GSoC
program and beyond. I am proficient in C++ and python, I have experience
working with Qt and OpenGL. I would like to ask some questions and document
myself about the capabilities of QGIS 3D.
1) Is there a written list of features that QGIS 3D has ? I don't see the
3D map view fully integrated within QGIS especially for scripting.
2) From the proposed project ideas list I saw in the QGIS wiki I feel like
we need to implement a graphics engine for the 3D map view that takes
MDAL data. I would like to know more about the already existing structure
of rendering and whether OpenGL is used currently or not. I read through
the docs but it looks a little confusing to me (lots of classes).
3) I find the navigation of the 3D map view quite hard to use properly (I
understand that's a problematic thing because I already had troubles with
that while making my own OpenGL graphics renderer). Do other people also
find that a problem ? I may try getting into that if you want.
Have a nice day :)
Best regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Update layer styling panel using Python
Message-ID: <CAFFV8FjEveaUDuL5zO+iiYSW3CB680b2VnBu91OQjUhMEA+vyw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

After changing a layer's symbology using Python, how can I update the layer
styling panel to reflect the changes? I'm specifically asking because
data-defined overrides are not displayed after

exp = 'coalesce(scale_exp("pop_max", 0, 10000000, 0, 7, 0.57), 0)'
vlayer.renderer().symbol().symbolLayer(0).setDataDefinedProperty(
    QgsSymbolLayer.PropertySize, QgsProperty.fromExpression(exp) )
vlayer.triggerRepaint()

Regards,
Anita

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GeoPDF not available with GDAL 3.0.4
Message-ID: <92e6dd98-38be-f63a-5821-ba3a8211f29d@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've complied QGIS against GDAL 3.0.4 but when I try to export a geopdf
it is still greyed out saying:

GeoPDF creating requires GDAL version 3.0 or later

this is the output of the terminal:

matteo at debian:~/dev/build-qgis$ gdal-config --version
3.0.4

some suggestions?

Thanks

Matteo

Hi Matteo, 

In the QGIS About dialogue - does it also say that QGIS was built with
GDAL 3.0.4? 

Just to make sure that there aren't multiple GDAL versions on your
system and QGIS could be linked against an older version?

Hi, 

Strange. I also compiled against GDAL/OGR 3.04 - and it is not greyed
out. 

However, I have an older QGIS version and an older qt version (5.9.5)
than you. Not sure if that matters.

Hi Matteo,

My gdalinfo returns:

gdalinfo --formats | grep -i pdf
  PDF -raster,vector- (rw+vs): Geospatial PDF

Can you check your's gdalinfo --formats output?

Did you compile it? I compile gdal myself and I use the option:
--with-pdfium=/usr/local

To compile PDFium, use Even's receipt:

git clone https://github.com/rouault/pdfium_build_gdal_3_1
cd pdfium_build_gdal_3_1/
./build_linux.sh
sudo cp -r install/include /usr/local
sudo cp -r install/lib /usr/local
sudo ldconfig

Then compile GDAL.

See you soon,

Jorge

same for me

matteo at debian:~$ gdalinfo --formats | grep -i pdf
  PDF -raster,vector- (rw+vs): Geospatial PDF

no just updated from debian sid packages, so standard one. I just
compiled QGIS as usual.

GDAL and OGR algorithms seem to work fine, geopdf is not available...

Thanks Jorge, 

Yes, I remember that. You'd have to make sure that the output from 

gdalinfo --formats | grep -i pdf

reads  

  PDF -raster,vector- (rw+vs): Geospatial PDF

Otherwise it Geospatial PDF is not enabled in GDAL. 

I compiled it with poppler 

./configure --with-python=python3 --with-proj=/usr/local --with-pg=yes
--with-poppler

Greetings, 

Andreas

so gdal should be manually compiled to enable geopdf?

Hi Matteo, 

if the output of 

gdalinfo --formats | grep -i pdf

doesn't read like  

 PDF -raster,vector- (rw+vs): Geospatial PDF 

then yes, you'd need to compile GDAL/OGR yourself.

Hi,

that's the strange thing, my output looks exactly like your:

> gdalinfo --formats | grep -i pdf
> 
> doesn't read like 
> 
>  PDF -raster,vector- (rw+vs): Geospatial PDF

matteo at debian:~$ gdalinfo --formats | grep -i pdf
  PDF -raster,vector- (rw+vs): Geospatial PDF

this is becoming really weird...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Creation error for Spatialite layer
Message-ID: <0c6092c1-0c11-d58d-9da6-ee8a51cff1ae@gmail.com>

Hi list -

I've stumbled into a severe - possible regression - error trying to 
crate a Spatialite layer with an  autoincrementing id field.

Steps to recreate error:

 1. Create a spatialite layer in QGIS
 2. Check the "Create a autoincrementing primary key" checkbox (Which
    correctly create a autoincrementing pkid)
 3. create a record by digitizing
 4. Try to save the record

The following error message appears:

The SQL statement is obviously wrong, missing the name of pkid field

I get the error in both QGIS 3.10.3 - 64 bit and 3.12.0 - 64 bit on 
Windows 8.1

I remember doing this working correctly in QGIS ver. 2.x.


Can anyone confirm this error before i report it ?

Hi,

We have the same issue as last year for us.
Is-there a repository for QGIS 3.4?

Similar to:
http://qgis.org/debian-ltr-2.18/
http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-ltr-2.18/

for QGIS 2.18.

Thanks

The open doc issue ticket also relates to the layer styling panel
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/2071

It references an old blog post by Nathan which has meanwhile moved to
https://woostuff.wordpress.com/2016/06/29/qgis-style-dock-part-2-plugin-panels/.
This post illustrates how to add a panel but I couldn't find pointers on
how to update an existing one.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Explicit policy re bug fixing responsibilities
	after new features
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjPy9ngd2nzU9hkUHKnYZL1=+qKweJFEJk_LdzZtfT7xQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I'm after feedback on whether or not others think an explicit
policy/contract regarding bug fixing responsibilities for new features
is a good idea or not.

I would like to see something like this added to the developer guidelines:

"Following any new feature development, it is the original developer's
(or organisations) SOLE responsibility to implement bug fixes relating
to the new feature (or regressions to other parts of QGIS which have
resulted from its development). This extends up to the next major QGIS
release following the feature being merged*. It is NOT acceptable to
use QGIS.org sponsored bug fixing efforts to implement these fixes.
Failure to provide fixes to all reasonable bug reports raised for a
new feature may lead to that feature being reverted prior to release."

*i.e. currently 3.14

Personally, I think having this as part of our developer agreement
would help clear up some ambiguity and source of frustration/conflict
between developers.

Thoughts?

Nyall

Hi Nedjima

Welcome to the qgis-dev mailing list! Please see my comments below.

I am willing to contribute to QGIS project by working on QGIS 3D features as a part of GSoC program and beyond. I am proficient in C++ and python, I have experience working with Qt and OpenGL.

That sounds great!

I have seen on your github profile that you have developed a graphics engine:
https://github.com/NEDJIMAbelgacem/Graphics_Engine
Could you tell us a bit more about it? Maybe add some screenshots with
3D eye candy? :-)

> I would like to ask some questions and document myself about the capabilities of QGIS 3D.
> 1) Is there a written list of features that QGIS 3D has ? I don't see the 3D map view fully integrated within QGIS especially for scripting.

There is some user documentation here:
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html#d-map-view
But it is not really a complete list of features...

Regarding python scripting, there is limited integration: you can
configure 3D symbols for vector layers and mesh layers, but currently
you cannot interact with a live 3D scene in Python. This is mainly
because that would require addition of PyQt3D as a dependency of QGIS
(the "ordinary" PyQt5 does not contain python wrappers for Qt 3D
framework).
https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt3d/intro
So far I did not need that so I skipped the integration for now, but
it would be definitely useful to have.

> 2) From the proposed project ideas list I saw in the QGIS wiki I feel like we need to implement a graphics engine for the 3D map view that takes MDAL data. I would like to know more about the already existing structure of rendering and whether OpenGL is used currently or not. I read through the docs but it looks a little confusing to me (lots of classes).

The proposed project ideas are mostly independent from MDAL data. For
example with vector layer data we tessellate them (if needed) to
create meshes and display them in 3D views. By the way, MDAL data
already can be displayed in the 3D views (in QGIS 3.12) and there are
more improvements coming, e.g. https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/34945

All 3D rendering is done with Qt 3D and yes, it is based on OpenGL. We
use some basic shaders from Qt 3D Extras library (e.g. material for
Phong lighting), but there are several custom shaders we use (e.g.
rendering of lines, instanced rendering of points, rendering of points
as billboards, mesh layer rendering).

I would be happy to discuss with you the list of ideas and what I
think would be the necessary tasks to complete them. I am also open to
any own ideas about things that could be improved in QGIS 3D.

> 3) I find the navigation of the 3D map view quite hard to use properly (I understand that's a problematic thing because I already had troubles with that while making my own OpenGL graphics renderer). Do other people also find that a problem ? I may try getting into that if you want.

I have seen people "fight" with the navigation too... There are surely
some ways how to improve this - but first of all we should make a list
of problems with the navigation and see how we could fix them.

If you would have some free time, it would be good to set up a
teleconference to discuss things in a bit more detail.

Martin

Hi Nyall,
this sounds reasonable indeed, can we have a bit more background or
pointers to real cases?
One issue we faced these past months is that he exponential trafic on the
issues and PR makes it harder to follow issues and just have the
information that we could possibly be at stake somewhere.
Last year I was able to follow +/- 80 % of the discussions. I must admit
that lastly it became nearly impossible unless to work mostly on QGIS bug
triaging or coding.

I really don't know how we could improve our communication channels. Any
hint welcome.

Best regards
Régis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to convert multiple "in memory" layers
 parameters to an actual list of files ?
Message-ID: <CAKXEUWMADJzy4YcQoyHt9d2FQHX9OvbU0aNUnvjWfnV19_0T7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm working on a processing plugin. My input parameters are:

   - one point layer
   - a non empty list of line layers

I've found that some of the layers are stored in memory and are not actual
files. It happens when a layer is created by QGIS plugins. But for my
algorithm I need actual files because the work is done by an external
process.

I've been reading through the GDAL and Grass plugins which have the same
architecture as mine (launch an external process to do the work). And the
function parameterAsCompatibleSourceLayerPath is called to convert an in
memory layer to an actual file. I've used successfully this behavior for
the point layer and it's working perfectly fine.

However, I cannot find any example of doing the same on a
QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers, the parameters for my line layers.
And the function parameterAsCompatibleSourceLayerPath takes the name of the
parameter and returns only one string, so it doesn't seem to work
on QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers.

What would be the right way to convert a potentially "in
memory" QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers to an actual list of files ?

Thanks for your help,

Jean-Charles

PS: I'm using QGIS 3.10.2-A Coruña on windows 10 64 bits

I've always felt it was an implicit agreement, but I totally agree
that making it explicit is a good idea.

Where exactly would you suggest to add that kind of statements?

I think it's a great idea... just to give an example...

I've the responsibility to do some maintenance work or refactoring of the
raster calculator I reintroduced in processing times ago.
Now that I've a complete hackmeeting organised only for me I can (try to)
do it ;)

I'd like it to be official so there's no room for misunderstand.

I'd put it in a new section under
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/  Maybe
something like "development policies"?

We could word it something like:

"While new feature submissions are always highly appreciated, every
feature added to QGIS comes with an associated maintenance burden for
the project. Accordingly, some policies exist to avoid placing this
burden on the existing QGIS development team:
- Following any new feature development, it is the original
developer's (or organisations) SOLE responsibility to proactively
monitor and implement bug fixes relating to the new feature (or
regressions to other parts of QGIS which have resulted from its
development). This extends up to the next major QGIS release following
the feature being merged*. It is NOT acceptable to use QGIS.org
sponsored bug fixing efforts to implement these fixes. Failure to
provide fixes to all reasonable bug reports raised for a
new feature may lead to that feature being reverted prior to release.
- After this major release, the developer is still expected to monitor
the bug tracker for issues relating to their work and implement
reasonable fixes at their own expense.

Personally I think this particular situation is a little more complex
than a purely new feature (since your work was actually fixing bugs in
many other's original work!!) , but the fixes will still be welcome ;)

There's been a lot of "drive by features" over the last 12 months,
where we see work merged and then the original developer disappears. A
decent number of these have been first time QGIS developers. I'd
rather not point to individual cases if that's ok!

Yep, I hear you here! The PR queue is really stacking up again now and
stressing me out...

Unfortunately - an API call to to this automatically just doesn't
exist in current QGIS versions. If you're keen to dig into QGIS core
development I can give some pointers on how this should be added...

Hi,

I agree that we have been following a "drive by features" approach.

Maybe with a more detailed road map of what we want in QGIS core, it
would be easier to tag features provided by some developer/org as
"extra" features or core features.

Core features, according to some kind of road map, should be supported
by any developer and eventually supported by QGIS.org. All PR related to
these should have higher priority.

The policy you are suggesting, Nyall, should be for "extra" features,
the ones that are nice, but maybe not so important for the majority of
users.

You are one of the developers with more features introduced. Even if you
are suggesting this policy, I think you are not responsible to maintain
everything you did. Some are core features that should be backed by any
other developer, if you are busy with something else.

I think DB Manager is also a good example of something that was taken
out of the road map. Developers trying to keep it alive should fix any
upcoming errors.

Maybe we could take more advantage of github "projects" tool to identify
for each upcoming release the core features/priorities. Everybody could
discuss, contribute and see what is scheduled and considered priority.

QEP has been used for this, but it is a flat list, without any kind of
priority and has no distinction between what is core or not. The tool is
not important. Changing the drive from "features" to something more
broader can improve the project management.

Maybe we can work on your early discussion for 4.x to have a clear
vision of what we want for QGIS in the short and medium term.

In summary, as an alternative or complement to this policy, a clear road
map of what we want in QGIS would make this responsibilities more clear.

Regards from the virtual hackfest in Den Bosche,

Jorge

Hi,

I forgot to mention that https://github.com/qgis/qgis4.0_api/issues is
collecting wishes for 4.x and should be considered, when discussion what
is core and what is not.

Jorge

Hello Martin,
Thank you for your positive reply!
I just updated the GitHub repository with some screenshots of the things I
made with my graphics engine. I started learning opengl January last
year and didn't think I will have good results to share (I was just playing
around) and when I heard about google summer of code I figured it will be a
good chance to prove that I know how to code in C++ (despite some bad
practices I did there like the obvious awful cmake file that I only noticed
when I was writing the readme file 😞). sorry for not writing a proper
readme from the start, I will be glad to hear your opinion about my hobby
project.
Link to the readme file: https://github.com/NEDJIMAbelgacem
/Graphics_Engine/blob/master/README.md
I will be happy to discuss with you the list of features requested for
QGIS, I can start developing the features and familiarizing eith the
codebase before GSoC starts (even if I don't get accepted I think I can
learn a lot from QGIS code base).
Best Regards,
Belgacem

Need some clarification on some particulars related to versioning and
releases...

Do you mean minor instead of major releases? You speak of reverting a
feature prior to a *major* release, but features are introduced on master
prior to every 4-month (minor or major) release, as indicated by your
footnote for 3.14.

If you do mean major, then this could be quite some time and possibly
unequal per author, e.g. one feature introduced in 3.0.0 needs supported
until 4.0.0, while another in 3.14.0 has a much shorter support cycle to
reach 4.0.0.

Regardless, I suggest scheduling the expected new feature support relative
to the public release *cadence*, regardless of release version.

Instead of...

This extends up to the next major QGIS release following
> the feature being merged*.


Maybe something like...

"This extends from when the feature is merged into a development branch
until its public QGIS release containing the feature."


Also ...

- After this major release, the developer is still expected to monitor
> the bug tracker for issues relating to their work and implement

> "
>

Like... forever? What about the *value* of their contribution to the
project itself? Something highly variable and relative, even for core
features. And what about later, when the feature is stable, but needs
refactored to meet other changes in the codebase? Does that then constitute
a 'bug'?

Maybe instead:

"After the first public QGIS release containing the feature and until the
next public release (or whatever interval is agreed upon), the developer is
still expected to monitor the bug tracker for issues relating to their work
and implement reasonable fixes at their own expense."

I'd be hard pressed to convince any funding backers that they need to pay
me to develop a feature and financially support it in perpetuity,
especially if the feature also benefits the project/app and its users.
However, it seems reasonable to say to a customer "and you also need to
support the fixing of this feature's bugs found by the public until the
following public release."

I'm all for accountability in code maintenance, but there has to be a
limit. Otherwise, contributions may become viewed as indentured servitude.

Yep, sorry. I meant 3.14 as opposed to 4.0

That sounds ok to me.

Ha. I'm sure the handful of current regular maintainers already feel
like we're slaves to all this abandoned code that other people are
pushing into master... And to be blunt, I'd rather these other
contributors/sponsors feel this pressure than us!

Hi BELGACEM,

1) Is there a written list of features that QGIS 3D has ? I don't see the
> 3D map view fully integrated within QGIS especially for scripting.


This Martin's presentation in FOSS4G perhaps can show the current list of
features also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stKWTOI0dFc&t=4s

Best regards

Hi Nyall,

Thanks for your answer.

If it doesn't take too much time for you, yes please, you can send me these
hints on how to implement this. I'll add it in my backlog and I'll be happy
to do it if I find the time (and manage to sell it to my boss, but he might
be ok as it's an issue for us).

Hi,

Thanks Nyall for this proposal. I agree this rule should be more
explicit. For professional developers, the maintenance cost of their new
features should be included somehow in the price. A more explicit rule
like this could help to support the message.

For what it's worth I personaly feel frustrated to be so slow to address
issues raised by previous works that I've merged in the last months.

Hi,

In general, I agree with Nyalls proposal. As a customer or user of QGIS 
who wants stability, this is a good thing.

But like Larry, I think we should be careful and not ask a dev to be 
responsible for a new feature during his lifetime ;-) ( I know this is 
exaggerating ). Let's limit the responsibility until the release of the 
next LTR version. I think that would be a compromise that protects both 
the customer, the developer and QGIS.ORG.

And, as the treasurer, I think it is totally ok, if the general QGIS.ORG 
funds are also used for bug fixing of features paid by someone else. 
After all, the customer and developer did their contribution which 
benefited all other QGIS users. Now, all the other QGIS users can 
contribute to the maintenance, esp. if they don't pay for feature 
development.

As a consequence of this proposal, devs should raise the hours budgeted 
for a new feature and as a consequence the price for the customer.

Greetings,

Andreas

Most of this argument is also applicable to the documentation of new
features. It is often left to documentation team or users to figure it out.
Obviously, we are guilty of this!
Overall, for a paid development, there should be a whole package to
consider:
- Development cost <<< that is the only cost mostly considered!
- Maintenance
- Documentation
- PR review(s) (esp. for larger features it is worth costing in the reviews)

It will be good to get the funder to either purchase support and
maintenance so you can fix the issues or gently push them towards becoming
a QGIS sustaining member.

I think the focus here should be on stability over a given time span, not
any specific version. I suggest "from the point of merging through the
public release with the feature and until the next 1 or 2 public
release(s)."

The reasoning here is that if a feature causes instability beyond a 4-month
release cycle, then something is VERY wrong with it, or it is so
complicated no one can correctly solve it yet. Either way, action needs to
be taken, i.e. disabling or removing it. The curse of self-inflicted
instability should not be allowed to persist beyond a single release.

Conversely, if the feature is stable after a full 4-month release, with
patch fixes, than it can probably be viewed as a complete contribution, or
not enough users have actually used the feature yet (corner case, I think).

Even a 8-10 month support cycle (two public releases, regardless of
version) makes sense, given most bugs for stability should be worked out
within the first 4 months; although, it *might* take fixes or another
feature in other parts of the codebase to make a broken contribution work,
i.e. needs one more general release. The latter might be a better option
than removal of the broken contribution or disabling it.

And, as the treasurer, I think it is totally ok, if the general QGIS.ORG

I think the point here is that, regardless of funding source, incomplete
contributions, i.e. ones that cause issues/bugs after merging, and there is
not a concerted effort to fix by the author(s), should not rely upon other
devs or the project's bug-fixing funds to get its code (or QGIS) working
prior to public release.

People make mistakes and having such an awesome community to help solve
them is what makes this project a joy to work with and contribute to.
However, it must not be OK to even have the appearance of contributors
abusing that relationship. Stringent guidelines here help everyone involved.

To me it's obvious that you have to take responsiblity for what you did - as
long as you only have to clean up your own mess.  Do we need an explicit rule
for this?

Once others touch the feature or features need updates because of other not
directly related changes, that ends - and moves on to whoever created the new
mess.  Otherwise a feature should have a maintainer and should be off limits
for others - which I'd say we don't want either.

So I'd expect the rule to often end in an grey area where you cannot just point
at whoever initially did it, unless it's broken from the start - in which case
it should not have been merged in the first place.

And IMHO the decision on whether to remove or fix features should not be tied
to whoever contributed it and whether that someone still maintains it, but on
the value of the features in form of it's (apparent) width of adoption.  If
it's used, we won't nuke it even if the initial contributor went away - and
it's in our interest to maintain it.

Stuff that continuously produces headaches without being significantly used
should go - give or take a maintainer.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Minimum version of Python 3?
Message-ID: <bf772eca-c0bc-b70e-2b86-119d7a26fcca@pleiszenburg.de>

Hi folks,

as far as I can tell from the documentation, QGIS compiles with Python
3.X. Maybe I am overlooking something, but I have not seen a restriction
such as e.g. Python 3.5 or greater for QGIS 3.12.

What's the minimum Python version that should assume when writing Python
code for plugins or QGIS itself? Does it align with the currently
supported versions of CPython?

Best regards,
Sebastian

I posted this message to the qgis-user list about a week ago
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2020-March/045005.html

But when following up today it occurred to me the question might be better
suited for the dev list.

I'm trying to use https://github.com/OpenGeoLabs/qgis-safecast-plugin with
the macos distribution of QGIS 3.12.0, but I can't figure out how to
satisfy the PythonQwt dependency.

I see a python3 binary at
/Applications/QGIS3.12.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7
but I can't find a `pip` or `easy_install`

Anyone here know how I could go about installing the dependency?

Thanks in advance and apologies for the mailing list confusion on my part,
Mat

Message-ID: <afc615c9-9624-1ebd-4da0-49c125338499@nsidc.org>

Hello,

We have encountered a problem in attempting to create WMS layers using 
PyQGIS (QGIS version 3.10.1 - installed from conda-forge).

Attempting to create a QgsRasterLayer with the `wms` provider results in 
a segmentation fault.

The following is a reproducible example. Running this code will cause 
the segmentation fault. Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.1, python 3.8.2.


    import qgis.core as qgc

    # Supply path to qgis install location

    qgc.QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/path/to/qgis/installation", True)

    url = "http://www.glims.org/mapservice?VERSION=1.3.0&STYLES="

    print(qgc.QgsRasterLayer(url, 'GLIMS_GLACIERS', 'WMS'))

The only output from running the above code is the following (return 
code 139):

    Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated. If no one has any 
feedback, we will open a bug report.

Thanks,

It's obvious to you, me, and everyone else subscribed to this list and

But it's **not** obvious to a new contributor.

Hey list,

The (very, very) handy azure builds are coming up with a notice:

"This pipeline uses a Microsoft-hosted agent image that will be
removed on March 23, 2020 (vs2015-win2012r2). You must make changes to
your pipeline before that date, or else your pipeline will fail. Learn
more (https://aka.ms/removing-older-images-hosted-pools)."

I'm guessing the only solution here will be to update osgeo4w to
utilise a newer vs version?

Apparently no need - the vs2017 image seems to also have the v140 toolset.  At
least it didn't instantly fail and is building for about an hour now…

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Georeferencer improvements
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFeBpEb630obQvdjKtfzroA9hBnC6Ey8UbpyVQJHqy5YFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

There has been some interest from a client to improve the
georeferencer in QGIS to better suit their needs, mainly to support
their workflow where they commonly georeference multiple raster images
at the same time. So for example you pick a single ground control
point (GCP) with XY(Z) map coordinates and in multiple images you
would visually pick where that point is located in image coordinates.
Ideally you want to see side-by-side the main map canvas and images
you are georeferencing.

With this kind of change, it is maybe a good time to have a look at
what are the other issues with the georeferencer and address them as
well. The budget is limited (as usual), so I cannot promise that
anything mentioned in this thread would get implemented, but I am sure
there are people around who have some ideas what could be improved. At
some point later I would like to prepare a QEP that will be hopefully
in line with the discussion here.

Let me start with a list of current issues I see with georeferencer in
addition to the lack of georeferencing of multiple images at once. The
following is a mixture of UI/UX and technical bits:

1. Georeferencer opens in a new window. In order to see the main map
canvas and the georeferenced layer side by side, it is necessary to do
some resizing of windows which is inconvenient. It would be maybe more
practical to have the georeferenced image in a dock widget in the main
window - and all georeferencer related map tools included in the main
QGIS window as well. (Or maybe the other way around - to keep
georeferencer as a separate window, but allow the main map canvas to
be embedded in it?)

2. Georeferencer is a plugin. Its core/gui functionality cannot be
reused elsewhere. It would be useful to have some Processing
algorithms to load/save GCPs, to extract GCPs to raster images, to
save GCPs to raster images and to warp imagery according to GCPs (and
chosen transformation method).

3. Georeferencer does not allow live preview of how the georeferenced
raster image would end up looking on the map - user is required to
write warped image to disk as a new file and only then see the
results. It should be possible to use the estimated transformation
based on GCPs and show the layer in the main map canvas any time (if
wanted).

4. It uses a combination of GDAL-based transformation methods
(Polynomial of 1st/2nd/3rd order, thin plate spline) and some of its
own (Helmert, Projective), for which it also requires GSL library as a
dependency. In my opinion, QGIS georeferencer should leave all the
math to GDAL which does a great job there. Moreover, I have some
doubts about the methods that do not come from GDAL: the “Helmert”
method is simply 2D affine transform (offset+scale+angle), while true
Helmert transformation is 3D transformation with 7 parameters. Do we
need it if GDAL’s 1st order polynomial transformation should do just
that? And the “Projective” method which is a bit of a mystery to me.
First of all, I am not sure in what situation it is useful and the
documentation only says it is “a linear rotation and translation of
coordinates” - which is a bit vague. It looks like a subset of RPC
method supported by GDAL (although GDAL does not have estimation of
RPC coefficients). Overall I would be for removal of these methods and
stick to what GDAL offers.

I would be keen to hear what you think, if you agree/disagree with the
above or have some ideas how to improve things here.

Regards
Martin

I would personally prefer the second option. I think a significant
amount of users doing regular georeferencing would have dual screen
setups (or large screens) and would appreciate having the a larger
georeferencer window then a dock would allow.

Totally agree! (Also -- add "warp vectors according to GCPs" here --
gdal exposes all the required functionality through the public c api,
so it's nearly a freebie!)

No strong opinions here from a user perspective. I always just choose
"projective" in this list, for absolutely no scientific reasons.
Someone years and years ago told me it was best and I never bothered
to look into it myself :P

Sounds great! Can I make some more suggestions:

1. Add vector georeferencing capabilities. This really isn't as much
work as it sounds, as
    - we already use a canvas to show the layer being referenced, so
it would be trivial to show ungeoreferenced vectors in this window
    - gdal exposes similar api for warping vectors based on gcps as it
does for rasters -- there's no heavy lifting required on the qgis side
So adding vector support is just a matter of considering it in the
code + a few extra choices in the UI. And there's a very strong need
for vector georeferencing (especially in the engineering world. True
story: I once had to georeference a highway design document which was
made in visio using a screenshot of google maps in the backend).

2. It should be possible to move the actual georeferencing operation
to a task. Warping some large images can be slooooow, so it's painful
that it currently blocks QGIS. I did some in-depth research
surrounding this a couple of years ago and there was nothing blocking
it. At the time it would have been just a matter of shuffling around a
bunch of the georeferencing code, but it sounds like you're planning
to do that anyway!

3. The georeferencer has serious UX issues surrounding CRS selection.
At the moment, you open a non-georeferenced image in it and you're
asked immediately for a CRS. That choice is completely redundant and
confusing! Also, it's really easy to make a serious mess of
georeferencing. If you pick points from the canvas the points are
stored in the gcp list in the canvas crs. Then when you perform the
actual reference if you pick a different destination crs for the image
you get messed up results. The two should be totally disconnected --
you should be able to pick points from the canvas and then later save
the result in a different crs without issue (the gcps should be
transformed automatically to the desired destination crs)

Exciting stuff!

I'd suggest ignoring the ci failures for your work at the moment --
the CI infrastructure is going through some pains as we've a number of
simultaneously flaky tests. They'll get solved (or disabled), but in
the meantime you can be confident it's **not** related to your work!

Ah, but I can't proceed with merging the PR until the ci succeeds.  And I don't see a way to bypass the failing test, though others could when another PR failed an unrelated test.

Hi Martin

this was one element in my todo list months ago.
In some automatic processing workflow, sometimes is necessary to give a
straightforward interactive tool to facilitate rectification when
polinomial parameters are not enough to reach precision... fortunately,
struggling with gdal code, I reached enough precision 1.5m (for our
application) on WorldView images.

BTW in case wouldn't be enough, I provided a custom and simplified QGIS to
go straightforward to create GCPs.

A better approach I found, but not ported to 3.x, is the use of "J
Rectifier" [1] plugin. This plugin theoretically reorganise de GUI to allo
live georeferencing that facilitating a lot the work. The main problem to
port to 3.x is that have to be redesigned from scratch, having one big
class doing all!
IMHO from this plugin we can get some interesting ideas how to facilitate
the user interaction.

+1 to all in gdal... btw seems gdal has some hidden or poorly documented
features. e.g geoid and gcp seems (form documentation) mutually exclusive,
but they are not (reading the code) and can be combined to reach better
accuracy.

Hello

  I would like to know opinion of QGIS developer community on the
question of "self-fixing queries" in the context of database layers.

  When you add a new database layer, QGIS queries required data, asks
user for other information and then saves it in the project file.
  Now when you re-open the project, QGIS is re-querying a lot of data
which is already saved in the project: geometry type, srid, attributes
(table columns/types).
  The downsides are:
  * these "re-checking" queries take considerable time on large
databases: with millions of records from 1minute up to several hours,
database is tuned - WMS/WFS queries finish in ~100ms.
  * in QGIS server environment these re-checking queries are executed
each time when apache launches a new QGIS server process
  * QGIS might by itself (without human interaction) decide to  work
differently compared to what it was asked to do when the project was
created if it finds that "something has changed"
  * re-checking during project opening is not 100% correct, as if
changes are possible in principle, then data/schema could change
during the time QGIS (Desktop/Server) is open/running
  * in environments other than development (testing, qa, production),
database schema should never change without some clear procedure which
should also include updating QGIS project files and testing them as
required, therefore such re-checkings should never be required on
testing/production environments.

  I do understand that the current situation/understanding is
different from mine, so in order to satisfy everybody, maybe it would
be feasible to add say an environment variable like QGIS_FAST=TRUE (or
QGIS_PRODUCTION=TRUE) and if this is set - re-checking queries could
be skipped? We've been running modified QGIS without re-checking in
production for months and are very happy with results. This should
also improve the benchmarks of QGIS Server as it is known that initial
opening of the project takes considerable amount of time.

  What is your opinion?

  Thank you

Tomas

Hi Tomas.
Check the project property option named "trust". This is exactly what it is
supposed to do.
I admit the wording is not nice, any better idea is welcome.
Best regards

Hi,

Related: having projects with several WMS or WFS server layers also are
opening very slowly (even when NOT visible). It would be nice to have
'lazy' loading, so only load layer which are visible?

@Tomas: are you sure it is doing full table scans? Most database have
some 'metadata' or cached metadata tables which could be used for that.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

  You mean this one: "Trust project when data source has no metadata"?
  I read the wording that it tries to check metadata and if that is
unsuccessful - trusts project data. My idea is to not even try
re-checking in metadata or anywhere else - always use data from
project and only execute queries for actual job to be done (also do
not try to filter on geometry type etc).

  Practical example: even simple things like re-checking table columns
in metadata (oracle data dictionary) could take 10-15 seconds when we
have ~100 layers. And on very high load these 10-15 seconds are
unwanted (and they will never find anything different than data in
project file).

  For geometry checking in our scenario it is doing very badly because
data comes from a view which is optimised to be used with spatial
filter (spatial queries take ~100ms), but when we try to query
distinct geometry types (even from random 100 rows) usage schema is
different and it takes ages. Haven't checked but I'm pretty sure it
involves full scans because it takes hours and we do not want to tune
the view with hints for geometry type checking as that will decrease
performance of actually useful queries fetching features.

Hi all,

we (Richard, me, Harrissou) are trying to build the QGI doc (3.19) with
the rtd theme (thank to Harrissou and Richard jobs).

All the progress are on branch qgisdoc2020 in the official
QGIS-Documentation repository:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/tree/qgisdoc2020

But we are stuck with Travis:

https://travis-ci.org/github/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/builds/662445827?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification

can some Travis guru have a look and help us fix it?

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Apparently you're not looking for a Travis guru, but a Sphinx guru:
sphinx-build: error: the following arguments are required: outputdir,
filenames
https://travis-ci.org/github/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/builds/662445827#L750

I would recommend you to run the same on your machine, run interactively
the Docker container so you can try what's going wrong with the
sphinx-build command.

Hi,

you don't need a Travis sorcerer, the commands do not even run on a
local installation.

Try this patch: https://termbin.com/mmb7

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Understanding plugin management in QGIS - exposing
 QgsPluginRegistry to Python?
Message-ID: <69942430-c188-89da-effa-ea062d9ccfd0@pleiszenburg.de>

Hi folks,

out of curiosity I have started poking around in QGIS' code related to
plugin management. It's an interesting mix of C++ and Python code. Even
the plugin management GUI itself is partially C++ (the main window,
QgsPluginManager[Interface], and part of its logic) and partially Python
(all further dialogs and their logic). As an experiment for now, I am
looking into how I could port at least the entire GUI to Python and
disentangle some of the knots. The rational is that plugin management is
not performance-critical and could become much more easy to maintain,
among a lot of other interesting benefits that a potentially fully
Python-based solution could offer. But that's a different story. For
now, I think I have hit a roadblock and was wondering whether anyone
could enlighten me. I'd greatly appreciate any help.

I *believe* I have a fairly good understanding of what happens
underneath `/python/pyplugin_installer/`. The class `QgsPluginInstaller`
from `installer.py` appears to be a Python API that is called from the
C++-interface (`QgsPluginManagerInterface`) through `QgsPythonRunner`.
Most of the C++ appears to be located underneath
`/src/app/pluginmanager/` (with a single ui-file elsewhere,
`/src/ui/qgspluginmanagerbase.ui`). Having analyzed the C++ class
`QgsPluginManager` I believe most of the interface can easily ported to
Python.

The tricky bit appears to be `/src/app/qgspluginregistry.cpp`. It offers
a class named `QgsPluginRegistry` (which is being used by
`QgsPluginManager`). I have not found a way to access this class (or
an/the instance of it) from Python. I figure it is required to handle
both Python *and* C++ plugins. `QgsPluginRegistry` makes heavy use of
`mPythonUtils`, which appears to be a C++ wrapper around
`/python/utils.py` (through `/src/python/qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp`). So
this portion of `QgsPluginRegistry` (about 50%) can be rewritten in
Python rather quickly. Methods such as `loadCppPlugin` or
`unloadCppPlugin` are a lot more problematic. As far as I can tell,
those would need to remain in C++ and they would need to be exposed to
Python somehow (if they are not already).

Have I found all relevant components of QGIS responsible for plugin
management? Does my analysis contain any major flaws? Is there a way to
manage C++ plugins (i.e. to call `loadCppPlugin` and `unloadCppPlugin`)
from Python?

Best regards,
Sebastian

Hi Sebastian,

The reason the whole infrastructure is split between Plugin Manager and Python 
Plugin Installer (and Python utils) is Python support is optional in QGIS. 

If QGIS is compiled without Python Support, the Plugin Manager still displays 
all C++ plugins, it just lacks Python ones (and of course install/deinstall 
funcions).

I admit the the infrastructure became a bit complicated ;) However, porting 
the Plugin Manager to Python would require making Python a hard dependency of 
QGIS GUI (or we should drop C++ plugins by porting them all to core, what is 
discussed from time to time and doesn't seem to may happen).

Regards,

Borys

Hi Sebastian, Borys,

What about the opposite way: moving things to C++ and leaving only a 
very thing wrapper for interacting with the plugins in place?

That should get rid of duplicated code and be compatible with everything.

Best regards

Matthias

That would be my preference too -- the overall movement in QGIS code
is to reduce the overall amount of Python code in master, not the
reverse.

> The rational is that plugin management is not performance-critical and could become much more easy to maintain,

Actually, over time we've found that the opposite is true -- the
Python code in QGIS master is the **most** work to maintain, and a
constant source of regressions. That's due to the nature of the Python
language itself, not a reflection of the quality of the code...

Thanks for all the hints. Apparently we were missing something silly
(that's the effect of a remote HackFest :D )

anyway, travis is now happy with both documentation and pyqgis test
(thanks Richard for the fix).

I really think this is the perfect moment to move on to the rtd theme
and release the 3.10 documentation. So what are the blockers? can we
write a todo list and squash all the problems?

That's what comes into my mind:

* verify Transifex pulling/pushing
* apache on the server to publish the docs
* ... what else?

Cheers

Matteo

@Raymond thanks for organising the hackfest! Sorry for not being
there... But the 'doc-team' did some things related to documentations
because there WAS a hackfest \o/

There are 2 things I want to discuss here.

First our main goal: "KISS".
Everybody on windows or linux should be able to build at least the
english docs.

Second: stick to Sphinx and it's tools as much as possible (e.g. instead
of custom scripts: use sphinx-intl to create transifex stuff).

My main 2 questions, I would like to discuss:

-1- CAN we use Travis to build the translated site (daily) (technically:
yes, I know, but...)

-2- WHICH process should be responsible for the pulling of the transifex
translations into the build process

Ad -1-
"Make doctest" will use the qgis/qgis docker container to build and run
the tests. Travis is happy with that [4]

So we could update or base a new image on it containing all language
related stuff, and use travis to build all languages. Current 3.4 builds
pull fresh from transifex (making a language build lasts for half an
hour now sometimes...) If we push the po files into github, it will only
be 10 minutes.
But my main question is: can/should we 'misuse' travis to build all
those (currently 18) languages daily.

Ad -2-
Several options:
- during our main build, the build pulls (tx pull) from transifex. Is
what we do now: Transifex is main repo for translations. IF an
individual wants to build a translated doc, she/he needs to pull the
translations from transifex itself (which is a disadvantage, as pulling
translations from tx is SLOW...)
- we run a daily script which pulls the translations from tx and commits
those po files (for ALL languages to be build) in git-repo.
Main advantage: we keep being boss over the po files ourselves, AND
everybody can build translated docs, because the po files are (well 1
day old...) in git
- use the Transifex Github integration (I played with it one year ago,
and then it could not handle our long resource handles at that time...)

I think I prefer the second or third option, will push nl, it and fr
translations into git later today (by just pulling the 3.4 translations
from build server), so everybody can try to build translated sites too.
Als together with maybe building it on travis, it is probably the best
way..

Want to see current status?

- vanilla Sphinx local ( EVERYBODY can try to build branch qgisdoc2020
NOW on windows and linux, see README [0] )

- vanilla Sphinx remote ('make site' works if you can like me rsync to
qgis2 [1]) (NOTE: a lot has to be done there....)

- everybody should now be able to 'just edit' on github [2]

- 'make doctest' (== building in te qgis/qgis docker image) is also
working, see travis [4] qgisdoc2020 branch there

Hi Richard,

Instead of travis, maybe we can try to use github actions instead?

Well, it would be the cleanest option, if there are resources. The Installer 
code is the first to be rewritten anyway, so it would fix it at one go.

Hi Borys, Nyall, Matthias,

thanks all for your replies! Let me address some of the points/concerns
raised.

> Actually, over time we've found that the opposite is true -- the
> Python code in QGIS master is the **most** work to maintain, and a
> constant source of regressions. That's due to the nature of the Python

Nyall, could you point me to some specific regressions that you are
referring to? Bugs or their IDs (so I can look them up)? When you say
"nature of the Python language", which specific aspects are you
referring to? I know there is a lot that one can legitimately criticize
about the language, but again I'd be highly interested in what
specifically is causing you headaches.

Reading the code of the Python (environment) integration, I can see that
it is prone to all sorts of issues - but I'd be interested in your
experience in what actually causes problems the most.

As for the code quality ... I do not want to offend anyone, seriously.
*PLEASE* take it as constructive criticism. I have been heavily
consulting on Python development for the past couple of years, so I have
reviewed, debugged and refactored a lot of code. One aspect that
immediately struck me when reading QGIS' Python code was the fact that
there were (absolutely unnecessary) relics of an automatic "2to3"
conversion all over the place. This tells a lot about the state of the
code already. Beyond that, I have found a few really bizarre (and
outright dangerous) uses of the "global" keyword. In a few cases for
error handling, I believe ... Yes, there are (few) legitimate usecases
for "global" in Python, but as far as my findings in QGIS go, none of
those make any sense. This can be solved in a much cleaner way by
exploiting name spaces and "mutable variables" (and exceptions). Having
said that, most of the code cares very little about mutable data types.
A few calls to "copy" methods in interesting places tell a story of
running into issues related to mutability without caring too much about
it. Well, I really do not want to insinuate a lack of understanding.
Also, going into the same direction, the code heavily relies on the
garbage collector doing a really good job. If this was performance
critical, it would be very slow. If someone relying on the correct use
of mutability would use some of the Python APIs in QGIS, it would sure
as hell lead to layers of bugs. As far as style goes, it is really hard
to see what internal and what external APIs are (i.e. which methods are
only called from within classes/modules or from the outside). Because
there is no public/private in Python, the typical convention is to use
(single) leading underscores in names. It is a minor detail but one that
leads to all sorts of issues when maintaining code in the longer run. A
somewhat bigger style issue is the fact that there is almost no
exception raising/handling as well as no parameter type, bounds and
consistency checking in functions/methods. Again, as long as you do not
touch this code (and stars are aligned in the right way), that's not an
issue. It is only hitting you on the longer run.

Ok, let's stop here. I really hope I have not trashed this code too much
... I just want to underline that (a lack of) code quality most
definitely adds to your negative experience with Python in QGIS (core)
from my perspective.

> That would be my preference too -- the overall movement in QGIS code

I can understand where you are coming from, however please allow me to
suggest the following: I would like to do what I already hinted on, i.e.
unify most plugin management code into a common, modern Python code base
with tests etc. I would like to show how this could look like. You do
not have to accept it or merge it. After all, I would probably have to
write an enhancement proposal first. So, please take it as a proof of
concept for now. How about that?

Once I have a working proof of concept, I actually have a few ideas on
how to take it forward and add a few interesting features to it - again
as proof of concept. One key idea is the integration of the conda
package manager. Other than pip, it actually has an official, stable
API. And, well, QGIS has recently been packaged for Anaconda for all
relevant platforms (kudos and thanks to everyone involved!). A conda
integration has a hell of a lot of potential.

Ok, so Python has to remain optional. This is just fine. As far as I can
see it, C++ plugins have to be compiled with QGIS anyway. At runtime,
all a user can do is to activate or deactivate them. Borys, am I
understanding this correctly? If a *minimal* C++ GUI would allow exactly
that, you could reduce a lot of the complexity. The rest could
(following my instinct) cleanly be written in Python. I.e. if (and only
if) Python is present, a fully featured plugin manager (for C++ *and*
Python plugins) could drop in and *replace* the simple C++ plugin on/off
manager GUI. How about that?

If you're going in the opposite direction, doing all in C++, you're
getting stuck with yet another hybrid solution, i.e. calling from C++
into Python (not only the other way round). No matter how thin the
remaining Python layer is, some of your current problems are likely not
going to go away. The beauty of going (almost full) Python is that
Python plugins can be managed by a Python manager - no hybrid required.
If done properly, as I said before, only very few calls from Python into
QGIS' C++ API would remain - essentially for activating and deactivating
the C++ plugins. The manager could then, theoretically, even be made to
optionally run stand-alone without QGIS, which leads to significantly
easier testing with a lot less mocking.

If I want to develop my proof of concept (and actually proof that this
could work), I'd ideally need access to at least some methods from
`QgsPluginRegistry`. Back to my original question: Can this class be
accessed from Python? Or could someone help me with exposing the
relevant methods (from one/the relevant instance of this class) to
Python? I have no trouble with building QGIS from source if required.

Best regards,
Sebastian

Hey. Guys. 
Just to let you know. I built the doc in Windows. Looks beautiful. 
I just felt a bit confusing with the windows instructions. 
Because when I cloned the repo I did not get the make.bat ( I could not clone the qgisdoc2020 branch directly- beginner mistake?)
So, I needed to create the branch first before actually compile it. 
Perhaps adding such make.bat in the master branch may help? 
Nice work. 

Cheers, 
Rosa

Hi Rosa,

Till now the qgis2020 branch is just an experiment to build 3.10, that
is. At this moment there was just no make.bat on master yet  :-)

We choose to build 3.10 because all the translation machinery has to be
there and working too.

We will probably change master branch soon so it will get build in the
same way...

If others find errors/issues with instructions, please fix.

Regards,

Richard

Done:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/

Please have a look and fix things.
I've barely looked at old build versions, just copied build machinery
from qgisdoc2020 branch. So if something was kicked into eternity,
please resurrect if from git...

We still need to sort out how to build automaticaly: travis, github
actions, whatever. Please feel free to kick in!

I might have missed something, but if I'm not wrong Travis already
build the docs during the testing process (but in a single language?).

What you are talking about is continuous deployment (CD) right?

You could probably do with both Travis and github workflows, you just
need to make sure that the CD only happens on each commit to master.

In order to be able to push the build to the deployment server you'll
probably need a deployment SSH key stored as a secret on Travis (or GH
workflow) that allow the Travis (or GH workflow) process to transfer
the built files to the production server.

It would work, too.

I don't have any strong opinion about the two opposite directions and don't 
want to take the floor, as I probably won't be able to contribute. I was 
thinking about refactoring the Installer (what I terribly wrote being a 
newbie) as well as rewritting the Manager with QtQuick for years, but never 
found enough time for quite a big task.

Have a look at all the issues on db manager for example. Many of them 
are caused by duck-typing, interfaces not being implemented (properly) 
by subclasses, pieces that have been forgotten during refactoring ...

I'm sure we will find explanations for each of them why they were there 
and how they could have been prevented. Very often the answer will be 
"unit tests missing".

While "unit tests" are also good for C++, it does by design already 
force a good amount of sanity checks onto code at compile time.

You certainly have some valid points here.

Anything that helps to improve the current situation of (python) code 
will be appreciated!

I would like it a lot to get a couple of pull requests that target such 
weaknesses.

Such pull requests are normally accepted quite quickly and much appreciated.

For your information: next to the plugin manager, there is also the 
Python console which in contrast to the Plugin manager is very unlikely 
to be replaced by C++ code. Any fixes in there will be long lasting and 
will help to strengthen the code for the upcoming years.

This would be a very nice addition indeed.

Plans in this direction have been on our wish list for this year. We 
have just had some discussions with Olivier about this this week.

This topic would deserve it's own QEP and I'm very interested in knowing 
a bit more about what you are after here.

No. It is in app, and the app library is not exposed to Python.

I'd issue pull requests if it was an easy repair. I was actually
starting to poke around because I thought I could add a feature. I ended
up thinking about a significant consolidation if not a rewrite (before
even considering adding features) because I think the code really needs
it. So before I begin to send pull requests your way, I decided to
explore what kind of changes you guys would be willing to accept
(short/long term) before I invest more time into it. If a re-write is
the lesser evil, this opens a bunch of interesting options /
opportunities, I'd say, and then it makes a lot of sense to ask for QGIS
developers' opinions.

I have noticed ;) There are a few issues in the console that keep
annoying me, but my current focus is on the plugin system.

Well, the bottom line is more efficiently tapping into pypi and conda
packages. QGIS / OSGeo4W pretty much acts as a rather limited Python
distribution. It's missing a lot of interesting scientific packages that
currently see rapid development. Their distribution as part of QGIS /
OSGeo4W would probably go much beyond the scope and resources of the
QGIS project. If, on the other hand, QGIS was "simply" yet another
C++-heavy Python package within a larger ecosystem, let's say Anaconda,
this would add an interesting new perspective. I have been chasing the
idea that QGIS plugins (more specifically their meta data) are lacking a
lot of features of Python wheels or Conda packages. They really can not
carry dependencies (other than dependencies to other plugins, added in
QGIS 3.6 I believe). It's actually officially recommended to make Python
dependencies part of QGIS plugins' distribution files (c & p), which can
be a no-go for a number of good reasons. If you imagine that QGIS
plugins are instead (or additionally) distributed as conda packages
(with all of conda's package management features) while the entire thing
remains manageable through a simple GUI, the QGIS plugin manager, I can
see some interesting new use-cases and possibilities (especially for
non-technical and Windows users). This is more or less the gist of my
thinking.

How complicated is it to change that, let's say for just
`QgsPluginRegistry`, with a really ugly patch perhaps (that is not meant
to go into master)?

 Cognition for the QGIS Processing Modeler
Message-ID: <CAM+zXj2+NS6NCHZZS48wummoxBm0LhORdWHF4dWrz+GkAK-wtA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear devs,

While I was doing article research and I found this article about
Processing Modeler that was published in February 2020.

I don't know if one of you were aware of this or if this can help to
improve the Processing Modeler. I thought this can be useful that was the
reason to share with you.

This is the abstract:
*This article presents an evaluation of the QGIS Processing Modeler from
the point of view of effective cognition. The QGIS Processing Modeler uses
visual programming language for workflow design. The functionalities of the
visual component and the visual vocabulary (set of symbols and line
connectors) are both important. The form of symbols affects how workflow
diagrams may be understood. The article discusses the results of assessing
the Processing Modeler’s visual vocabulary in QGIS according to the Physics
of Notations theory. The article evaluates visual vocabularies from the
older QGIS 2.x and newer 3.x versions. The paper identifies serious design
flaws in the Processing Modeler. Applying the Physics of Notations theory
resulted in certain practical recommendations, such as changing the fill
colour of symbols, increasing the size and variety of inner icons, removing
functional icons, and using a straight connector line instead of a curved
line. Another recommendation was to provide a supplemental preview window
for the entire model in order to improve user navigation in huge models.
Objective eye-tracking measurements validated some results of the
evaluation using the Physics of Notations. The respondents read workflows
to solve different tasks and their gazes were tracked. Evaluation of the
eye-tracking metrics revealed the respondents’ reading patterns of the
diagram. Evaluation using both Physics of Notation theory and eye-tracking
measurements inspired recommendations for improving visual notation. A set
of recommendations for users is also given, which can be applied easily in
practice using a contemporary visual notation.*

Really cool! (Wonder if we could convince the authors to extend the
study to other parts of QGIS...!)

Will respond properly when I've had a chance to read and digest fully.

The issues we see most often stem not from any particular use of
Python, but (as Matthias has pointed out) through the nature of
Pythons weak typing and lack of compile time checks. A simple example:
if I alter the signature of a virtual method in one of the c++ classes
to add an extra argument or change a return type, I'll know right away
(well, when I next compile) if I've broken some existing code. If I do
the same in Python, I'm basically trusting that my particular IDE can
correctly identify ALL use of that method, because I won't get any
warning if I did break something. Unit tests help, but will never
completely avoid this kind of breakage.

And we see this happen ALL. THE. TIME. in QGIS Python code. Processing
(through NO fault of the maintainers) was a frequent source of
breakage in QGIS 2.x, and it was only by porting the guts of it away
from Python and to c++ that we could finally get things stable. Now
it's happening all the time in dbmanager -- I don't think there's been
a single recent QGIS release which hasn't had some form of regression
in db manager. And again, I blame that on the nature of Python, not on
the existing code or maintainers.

Another HUGE factor with Python+QGIS is that the actual methods of
creating the Python bindings + the PyQt library itself is a mysterious
black box, full of weird inconsistencies, random results, memory
mismanagement and crashy code practices. I shudder to think of the
amount of time I've wasted fighting with SIP and its unpredictable
behavior. You could write the BEST Python code the world has ever
seen, using all the Python best practice coding techniques you want,
and you'll still hit random regressions and issues due to these
libraries. QGIS c++ code is just MUCH more predictable, transparent,
and easier to debug.

My point wasn't a comment of the quality of the Python code either
way. Rather, my point was that **regardless** of the quality of the
Python code, you'll still end up with a difficult to maintain, fragile
result!

This work sounds fantastic, and highly valuable to QGIS. It's GREAT to
hear that you want to investigate this!!

But please please please can I ask you to seriously reconsider your
approach? I've been working on this project for nearly 10 years now,
and my experience time and time again is that large blocks of Python
code in QGIS end up unstable. Modern c++ + qt is really not that much
trickier to write then Python, and if you include good test coverage,
then the code becomes almost self-maintaining*.

Python is a GREAT choice for QGIS scripts and addons, but I just don't
think it's a suitable choice here.

* at least, until a major qt release deprecates stuff you rely on! :P

having a proper way of managing plugin dependencies would be a huge
improvement, as this is one of the weakest points of our plugin management.

I'm with Nyall here. Once we started moving Processing classes in C++
it became much more stable than pure Python solution (even with tests).

As was said previously Python support is optional and from my point of view
it is much better to port remainings of the Plugin Manager to C++ and leave
only tiny wrapper for loading Python plugins.

Hi all,

This function is only for PostGres (Tomas use an Oracle database if I
remember correctly).

And from what I inderstand from the code, It only prevents from checking
for unique colomn in a view or materialized view.

However, it looks the good option to deal with this use case, I mean no
check (geometry type, srid, key column...) as soon as this option is set.

Regards,
Julien

  Actually I use PostgreSQL more, but this particular performance
problem is with Oracle database.
  And if enough people agree with the principle, I think it could be
possible to remove unnecessary queries from all providers (in time).

  That would make my patch much more simpler ;-)
  If I understand correctly, I can change my patch to skip geometry
type and srid check when they are saved in project already and when
option "trust project" is switched on?

Just my 2 cents, not really related to QgsPluginRegistry but with the 
Python/C++ issues you have been describing in this thread.
Please note that I am not familiar with QGIS Python or C++ codebase so 
this might something you are aware of (maybe you are already using it), 
but I have not seen any reference to type hinting in Python (which is 
supported since Python 3.5) in this discussion.
Currently type hints are ignored by the interpreter (Good thing is 
nothing can be broken by annotating types), but there is an additional 
tool mypy that performs static analysis of the code and warns of type 
conflicts, identifying many of those bugs that would only have shown on 
runtime (or unit tests) otherwise.

I do not know how the Python bindings are generated, but if (and I know 
this is a big 'if') we can get type hinting automatically generated from 
the C++ API, and progressively annotate types for the rest of the code 
base, we should be able to catch most if not all of these problems you 
are describing.

Regards,
Javier

agreed. One can significantly reduce the risk with the right tooling, a
lot of discipline, experience and tests. But one can never rule this
sort of thing out entirely. It is the nature of what Python allows you
to do (whether or not some of this stuff can be considered good or bad
practice) vs. what static analysis tools can understand. Most of what I
am interested in doing here does not require pitch-black Python magic,
so a good tool-chain should be able to handle it if the code is written
adequately (at least in my personal experience).

Javier, you alluded on type hints. Yes, they are one of the interesting
options one has in modern Python. And if your code is not too
performance-critical, there are actually ways to make the interpreter
respect then at run-time, i.e. Python with static types in
function/method signatures :) None of this is currently being used in QGIS.

Ok, this sounds like serious issues with SIP. The smaller your SIP
interface is, the smaller your surface of attack becomes. Which makes me
wonder ... even if you shift as much of QGIS' logic from Python to C++,
you'll always be stuck with some SIP due to your Python integration and
the plugin ecosystem. From what I have seen, QGIS (in its current form)
is the ultimate stress-test for SIP as in QGIS does some really wild
stuff with it. Would not it make sense to clean up a lot of those SIP
interfaces and limit them to what actually makes sense?

I have not seen any self-maintaining code in my life ;)

Personally, but that's just a non-technical preference, I am way faster
& better with prototyping / developing in Python than I am in C++. I
usually port code away from Python in a later work step once stuff is
working (and tested). Other than that, while understanding your points,
I can still see how a Python solution / prototype could make sense from
a technical perspective and still address your concerns. Allow me to
elaborate on it.

I want to manage Python plugins, Python packages and Python dependencies
as well as load, unload and inspect Python code while remaining on top
of things by catching and treating all possible exceptions in this
process. Therefore, I want to work closely with some Python modules,
e.g. `ast`, `inspect`, `importlib` and `conda.api`. I am heavily tapping
into the interpreter for that. The closer I remain to my objective, the
more flexibility I have and the more stability I gain. Even if I move as
much as possible over to C++, i.e. the GUI and some logic, the actually
required Python layer (plus C++ interface code) would remain
substantial. It would also lead to a convoluted logic, probably in the
end only little better than the current plugin installer. This is
precisely what I want to get away from. Having said that, the plugin
manager is - from my perspective at least - different from processing or
the db manager. They are significantly different technical problems.
While I agree with you that, due to SIP, it is a good idea to move as
much of processing and db manager over to C++, I am thinking that going
the opposite direction specifically *here* makes more sense. While QGIS
is a hybrid, I'd attempt to limit my exposure to SIP by limiting my
interaction with QGIS (and PyQt) APIs to a bare minimum. After all, I
see a good plugin manager more as an "independent" Python package (with
all of its typical infrastructure) than something that is heavily woven
into QGIS core (while it might actually be distributed / deployed with
QGIS core).

How does this sound?

Best regards,
Sebastian

Hi !

Thanks Sebastian for willing to work on this !

I'd suggest drafting a QEP already, as adding support for pip/conda
dependencies (which would be awesome !!) raises a few important questions
(for example whether we have virtualenvs or similar on all systems, how
plugins would declare their deps, how to deal with incompatible deps, or if
we even go one step further and support distribution qgis plugin as pip
packages, etc...). And there may be some other ideas around worth sharing
at an early stage (such as proper multiple plugin versions support, also
improving the plugin repository API - which by the way is also Python code,
etc).

As for the Python or C++ discussion, I don't have enough experience to help
decide, but what's sure is that either will be better than status quo in
terms of maintenance !

Cheers,

Olivier

yes, I have considered writing a QEP. It is the important questions that
you have raised which make me hesitate to write a QEP just yet. I intend
to first experiment with different approaches and explore and test them
well before I'd even suggest going down any specific path. Having said
that, I am more than happy to hear about ideas on what should be tested
in this context.

Best regards,
Sebastian

Quite a lot of test fixes committed over the last couple of days.
Fingers crossed this will stabilise things!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] On the fly on MapCanvas
Message-ID: <003d01d5fc07$5b2798f0$1176cad0$@gmail.com>

Dear QGIS-Developer,

I am writing a simple program to display raster data using qgis api C++.

When I open raster data that has different coordinate systems, the
on-the-fly feature does not work on my mapCanvas.

Can someone help me?

This is my code:

OpenGisData::OpenGisData(QWidget *parent)

: QMainWindow(parent)

{

    setupUi(this);

    QWidget* centralWidget = OpenGisDataClass::centralWidget;

    mMapCanvas = new QgsMapCanvas(centralWidget);

    QGridLayout* gridLayout = new QGridLayout;

    gridLayout->addWidget(mMapCanvas);

    centralWidget->setLayout(gridLayout);

    connect(actionOpen, &QAction::triggered, this, &OpenGisData::open);

}

void OpenGisData::open()

{

    QString fileName = QFileDialog::getOpenFileName(this, "Open data",
"D:\\Test");

    if (!fileName.isEmpty())

    {

        QgsRasterLayer* rasterLayer = new QgsRasterLayer(fileName);

        if (rasterLayer && rasterLayer->isValid())

        {

            QList<QgsMapLayer*> layers = mMapCanvas->layers();

            layers.append(rasterLayer);

 

            mMapCanvas->setLayers(layers);

            mMapCanvas->zoomToFullExtent();

        }

    }

}

 

Thank You

Message-ID: <CAPK9r68Gg3fH3npBFWMnRAJRVcbKzY+DZU0++ME9SXm7KATYAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

this is my code:

---
id_ = 'my_layer_2bbd2539_97b3_417d_8a2a_97ec4f755a82'

crs = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem()
crs.createFromString('epsg:4326')

crs2 = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem()
crs2.createFromString('epsg:32632')

lay = QgsProject.instance().mapLayers()[id_]

lay.selectByExpression('"fclass" = \'{}\''.format(w))
new = processing.run('native:saveselectedfeatures', {'INPUT': lay,
'OUTPUT': 'memory:'})['OUTPUT']

opts = QgsVectorFileWriter.SaveVectorOptions()
opts.fileEncoding = 'UTF-8'
opts.driverName = 'ESRI Shapefile'
if os.path.exists('/home/rr/test.shp'):
    opts.actionOnExistingFile =
QgsVectorFileWriter.ActionOnExistingFile.AppendToLayerAddFields # important

ctx = QgsCoordinateTransformContext()
ctx.addCoordinateOperation(crs, crs2, '', False)

err = QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormatV2(new, '/home/rr/test.shp',
ctx, opts)

lay.removeSelection()
---

The result still has WGS84-coordinates. What I'm doing wrong?

I can't use native:reprojectlayer because I need the append-feature from
the QgsVectorFileWriter.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsProject.instance() in QGIS docker 3.10 crash
Message-ID: <CAMtDFLLL5PGGOVCdbySRuw9YJcN-8BZk_wgsF_ekf9OXKaNTEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have setup some plugins with unittests using Docker.
I have followed the documentation :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/.docker
to run them locally or/and on Travis.

This tests is working well using the QGIS 3.4 docker image :

class TestEditionDialog(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_atlas_dialog(self):
        """Test atlas dialog."""
        layer = QgsVectorLayer(plugin_test_data_path('lines.geojson'),
'lines', 'ogr')
        QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(layer)
        self.assertTrue(layer.isValid())

But as soon as I start using a QGIS 3.10 docker image, QGIS crash.

test_atlas_dialog (lizmap.test.test_dialog_edition.TestEditionDialog)
Test atlas dialog. ... QGIS died on signal 11Test atlas dialog. ... QGIS
died on signal 11
Finished running test
qgis_plugin_tools.infrastructure.test_runner.test_package (codes: IS_DEAD=0
IS_FAILED=1 IS_PASSED=1).
root at 1c7939c428c6:/tests_directory/lizmap#

By commenting the code, I noticed it's the `QgsProject.instance()` which
trigger the crash.
It tried quickly to replace by:

        layer = QgsVectorLayer(plugin_test_data_path('lines.geojson'),
'lines', 'ogr')
        project = QgsProject()
        project.addMapLayer(layer)
        self.assertTrue(layer.isValid())

It's working, the test is OK. But then, all my tests using a
QgsMapLayerComboBox are failing because the combobox is empty.

Does anyone confirm this kind of behaviour in their tests? Is-it a bug or
is-it another way to do tests using this docker image?

Regards,
Etienne

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] [Processing][Question] Using Data defined
	proprieties
Message-ID: <CAM+zXj36eLkXQn_Rtmsi8_idc-8D9GPL0-aEA5LrD4kwSGx8dw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Devs,
I have a question about using data defined proprieties in algorithms. For
instance,
if I want to do a Buffer using a field with a distance column I can use the
data defined proprieties and choose the field with distance.

But when I want to use more than 1 layer and switch to batch processing
where I want to define the field with distance of each layer I can't use
this option.

I try to use the name of the field in the option Add Values by Expression
and Calculate by Expression but the batch processing always assumes a
default value (10).

In the case of SAGA and buffer algorithm, when you switch for batch
processing is possible to choose the field of distance per layer.

What am I'm doing wrong? Or This is expected behaviour?

Please let me know if you need more details.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] compare failing/succeeding CI builds (how to?)
Message-ID: <20200317183055.GA17782@liz>

My long-standing PR about preventing testsuite run from changing
files in source tree is currently having a Travis failure which
seems to start with:

    ProcessingQgisAlgorithmsTestPt3

Trying to understand what's going wrong with that test I see a lot
of warnings/errors being printed, like:

  GEOS exception: IllegalArgumentException: Points of LinearRing do not form a closed linestring
  ...
  ERROR 6: EPSG PCS/GCS code 7992 not found in EPSG support files.  Is this a valid EPSG coordinate system?

And eventually the actual failure printed in yellow:

	FAIL: test_algorithms:20

	AssertionError: 9 != 8
	----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, as the test name mentions "projection" and one of the earlier errors are
about projections, I wanted to compare the failing run with the successful run
but the successful run is silent so I cannot compare. 

Would it make sense to enable verbosity on Travis for tests or should
I create a fake PR just for the sake of seeing those logs ?

Or more simply, can any other developers successfully running that
test let me know if those messages are printed ?

Thank you !

These warnings are expected -- the tests include a lot of non-valid
data (for testing purposes!)

This one not expected. What gdal/proj version do you use?

I'm reporting what Travis says, so whatever GDAL/PROJ version is

Hi,

I uploaded a qgis plugin some weeks ago that is still awaiting approval

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/DataLoader

I think I messed up the metadata the first time I uploaded it, but after 
I corrected that and defined a new version, I have still not heard 
anything. If there are any problems with the plugin, I would like to 
know about it so I could correct it.

Best regard

Morten Sickel

Thanks, for some reason, I never picked up that I had got an issue in
the plugin's bugtracker. 

I'll fix. 

Sorry for asking stupid questions and thanks for the help!

Hi all

Thanks for raising this issue and for your proposal of patch. I agree with
you that in many cases, completely trusting the project for columns, srid,
and all other things needed by Qgis would improve performances a lot in
project loading, and for Qgis server getcapabilities requests.

I do not use often the trust option for two reasons

# only few requests are avoided as you pointed out so the performance
improves "only" a bit
# sometimes you have some layers with changing data, and there is actually
no way to trust only a subset of layers inside the project

Do you think it would be interesting to have the trust option per layer and
not only per project?

Regards
Michael

  In large databases those few requests take minutes and sometimes
even hours... For servers even 30 seconds are too much when you're
trying to add a new QGIS server process to existing say 10 while on
high load doing 500 requests per second.

> # sometimes you have some layers with changing data, and there is actually no way to trust only a subset of layers inside the project

  1. If geometry types are changing by design, then checking geometry
type upon project loading is not enough. Then you need to ALWAYS
filter your results by requested geometry type. But only if it is the
case of varying geometry types. In my opinion, developer of the
layer/query should know beforehand if it is possible for geometry
types to variate and then create a view filtering on geometry type (or
it could be an option in QGIS ~"filter on geometry type").

  2. If database schemas are changing on-line then I would say
something is very wrong with the IT processes. Changes should start on
dev environment where data changes and QGIS project changes as well.
Then changes to db structure go to other environments up to production
in patches TOGETHER with updated QGIS project. System (in this case
QGIS) should never (in my experience) try to "fix" the problem because
it does not know all required information: maybe the project was
opened in incorrect environment, maybe it is a temporary problem,
maybe the real table is missing and you're accidentally trying to
query incorrect table which was never supposed to be queried -> strict
rules/control. Of course there could be a button "refresh" on a layer
to allow operator to re-query layer information upon manual request.

> Do you think it would be interesting to have the trust option per layer and not only per project?

  Theoretically there could be very different data sources, but in my
opinion if organisation uses strict IT processes then all layers will
be strictly managed (you would rarely/never have direct access to the
database of a different company/institution with different/weaker
processes). And vice versa.

Hm, in that case something you've done has broken (or at least

It's actually just an oversight. I just tested and (with a tiny code
change) it works fine. I'll open a PR.

Hi all,
it seems that the build of the weekly snapshots of qgis-dev from OSGeo4W as
standalone installer for Windows stopped in February: the last one is
QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.11.0-8 25-Feb-2020.

Regards.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgfUSgspmK7fBUumWufR4WsGU3hxKCHqN7hv+B-6uZaMA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Just wondering what everyone's thoughts are about geopackage FID
columns. Personally, I find them an absolute nightmare to deal with,
resulting in annoying (and dangerous) issues when trying to save
geopackage edits, such as
- field type issues: converting certain formats to geopackage fails,
because existing fields with name "fid" are of an incompatible type
with geopackage. Solution: manually uncheck the "fid" field from the
"save as" dialog.
- unique constraint violations: we've mostly fixed this in processing,
but it's still unfortunately really common to get failures when saving
edits to geopackage because some operation has resulted in duplicate
fids. This can be a nightmare to fix, if it's even possible to do so.

I personally HATE HATE HATE these columns, and would rather I never
saw them ever again. Does anyone else feel the same? If so, could we
potentially just permanently hide these columns from QGIS and avoid
all these dangerous issues for users?

Hi Nyall,

Similar thoughts here.

Not sure what a format wins from forcing people into using an integer 
based primary key column.

I think ultimately it is the data producer's responsibility to assign 
unique and sensible identifiers with meaningful names (aka primary keys) 
to data.

All the fid_1, fid_2 etc columns after processing, all the troubles with 
shifted columns because field indexes changed, all the extra effort to 
clean up with these generated clutter ids ... So much wasted time that 
no one will ever give us back.

If it was for me, may it rest in peace.

Matthias

Yes. proj-dev-data is to huge for NSIS.  Best install via OSGeo4W until grids
are downloadable via proj.

I agree.

If there is an ID that is used internally as a unique primary key it should
never be shown to the user. It should not be expected to be edited outside
of the provider's control or be stable between edits.

If you need a stable ID for reference you should make your own {{insert
rant about people wanting to use increating ints as a reference ID}}

There's no plans to use proj 7's built in auto grid download. This
isn't designed for GUI applications like QGIS -- if we did, we'd get
UI hangs all over the place while QGIS is trying to transform
coordinates, and proj blocks and waits for the download to occur.

What we should instead do is just fire up a background task on first
install to download ALL THE GRIDS FOR EVERYWHERE form the proj CDN and
install them locally. Problem solved.... FOREVER! ;)

Hi,

Just for your information, I have noticed that the size of official QGIS
docker images are increasing:

qgis/qgis     release-3_4      4.83GB
qgis/qgis     release-3_10    6.67GB
qgis/qgis     latest                6.95GB

Is-it an issue? A known issue?
Thanks

These images are built using the same base images that are used for testing.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.docker/qgis.dockerfile#L6

I think it would be more appropriate to create a dedicated Dockerfile with
only what is required to run the app and not building/testing/producing the
docs.

We would need to have a parameter to set the download location, as http or
file resource so that remote site with no internet available can still
install QGIS then...

For running desktop I extensively use Dockers derived from jancelin's work.
See my branches here where I upgraded the images to be able to use startup
parameters like profiles_path.

For building and running the lighter possible images, we use this stack,
mainly for server.

+1000. I was so relieved of the fid/oid/mapinfo_id when QGIS arrived and
allowed business logic primary keys.

Do you have some thoughts on how we are going to handle this in QGIS?
(Apart from that plan to download all grids on the first start :-))

My assumption was that QGIS would be shipped with no grids (simply too
much data to ship in installers), and if there would be a
transformation available with a missing grid, QGIS would show a
warning and let user download such a grid file with one click? Or did
you have something else in mind?

Cheers

Message-ID: <CAGiKOuggMJ+SuAe+LjnnmY0dsWtxoaGrqkGVndtkF9eJ_WAs8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,
I am Belgacem Nedjima, a fourth year student at the higher school of
computer science (ESI - ecole supérieure d'informatique), Algiers. I am
very interested in QGIS 3D project and discussed the project with mentor
Martin Dobias and wrote a proposal draft.
I would be very happy to receive feedback and clarify anything about my
proposal before I submit to the GSoC website. If there is anything unclear
or missing please let me know.
The list of features required for the QGIS 3D project is quite extensive,
so if there is any feature you think is more interesting than the features
I mentioned in the proposal please let me know.

Proposal document :
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dyszmpDlMpIV0T6oKEtIfCY5N2nXSp43LqF_h4U9p4A/edit?usp=sharing

I am looking forward to your valuable feedback.

Best regards

I agree, so in my algorithms working with geopackage I always redefined  
FID with

options = QgsVectorFileWriter.SaveVectorOptions()
options.layerOptions = ['FID=id']

For me it is like a primary key in PostGIS, I need to manage it.
Other point, Feature ID in QGIS is still a short integer.

René-Luc

Hi Tomas,

The way trust option works is not enough for big databases and big 
project with more than 100 layers. It is what Michaël and I experiment.

Then the problem with changes data is more about the layer extent. For 
example a natural observations layer is designed to accept data on a 
territory but t the start of the project the layer extent is null and 
will growing with data inserted. The trust option cannot be used at the 
project start unless the user can set the available extent, or can 
defined the trust option for each layer.

It will be great to set trust option at the layer level so QGIS can 
trust the layer information provided by the XML : QLR or QGS content
It will also be great to can set some technical metadata like a layer 
available extent as the geographic area for which a selected CRS is 
valid for use.

Regards,
René-Luc

I agree too - I also dont like that we get an FID column when we import another table that already has an id column….all sorts of chaos ensues….

Hi, can someone explain what is the real logic currently coded for trust
option? It feels like this topic raises again each year for 5 years now,
and we have regressions and what it is supposed to do.

It was funded at start to not check at all any metadata on the datasource
and read only qgs informations
Did it change for some reason ? Why?

It should be adequate even for big databases of QGIS stores all the
required informations.

Regards
Regis

Greetings,

Personnally when splitting layers and when there are FID conflits, I try to
solve it manually. Sometimes it tells me that the fid of feature x cannot
be change, which are not indistinguishable.

And the next time you open the geopackage there is a change that the fid
column will now be the next column over and the initial fid column with bad
fids is still there. If you had critical information in your second column
too bad, its now a fid and you lost that information forever.

Maybe that issue was fixed already since I'm mostly using 3.4.4 on my main
setup as of now (waiting for some PRs to get merged before updating).

Thanks

Alex

Hi PSC and contributors,

Please find the updated 2020 budget proposal at 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pUlUWa7PfgxLn-sX6K2ccPN7ZWXzqrw_QNNFyvw8Sl4/edit#gid=0

Comments:

- as proposed by some (e.g. Régis) for 2021 we will discuss and approve 
the budget in late 2020. Makes more sense.

- I already took into account that the 1st contributor meeting was cancelled

- I added the Python cookbook expenses as discussed recently

- I added VAT reverse charge expense estimates

- In some cells you can find comments - the cells with the yellow 
triangles in the upper-right corner of the cells

I am awaiting your comments. Questions? Did I miss expenses that you see 
upcoming but haven't been taken into account?

Greetings,

Andreas

I wouldn't suggest doing it as part of the install. I'd do it as a
post-install, first launch step (if internet connectivity is
available)

That's basically what we have now. When a grid is desirable (and not
installed) you get a warning in the message bar, which you can click
to open a dialog which explains the situation and provides a download
link, and a button to "install" (copy to the right place) the
downloaded file.

The only extra steps we could do to improve this would be:
- Avoid the "click to download in your browser" link, and instead have
a button which downloads in the background of QGIS itself and
auto-installs after download
- Take it another step further, and just immediately trigger the
download task when we first show that warning
- Avoid all these issues and download EVERYTHING for EVERYWHERE at
first startup ;)

I used to frequently get errors when copying and pasting features across
geopackage files.
So now, before saving the edited file, I select all features and set the
fid to NULL, which avoid errors most of the times.

+1000 from an user perspective the fid is really confusing. The user
seems to be able to delete/edit the column but (of course) touching it
will throw an error when saving.

Moreover, it happens that during format conversion in the attribute
table there are fid/pk/id columns, with same numbers.

Thanks for raining this

Isn't that potentially a quite large amount of data? Most QGIS users 
that I know mainly work in one country or region and only need one 
gridshift file. Of course there are exceptions.

Andreas

Hi Régis,

The trust option is used in QgProject with 
QgsVectorLayer::setReadExtentFromXml
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsproject.cpp#L3304

Then in the case of a postgres layer, the checkUnicityKey is disabled
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsvectorlayer.cpp#L1684

And it's all. The trust option only avoid to calculate layer Extent and 
verify primary key for postgres layers.

The estimatedMetadata layer option is more common in provider. It will 
be great to can check/uncheck this option.

Regards
René-luc

Hi, 

> Hi, can someone explain what is the real logic currently coded for trust
> option? 

It calls the QgsProject::setTrustLayerMetaData(bool) which says

> Sets the trust option allowing to indicate if the extent has to be read from the XML document when data source has no metadata or if the data provider has to determine it.
> Moreover, when this option is activated, primary key unicity is not checked for views and materialized views with Postgres provider.

And from what I see from the code it does what it says, no less, no
more. Only for PostGres.

As a result the variable checkPrimaryKeyUnicity is set to 1 in the uri.

It also add a trust node in project configuration for every layer, but I
don't see where it's used in QGIS code (I maybe miss something)

Julien

Yes. proj-dev-data is >500MB (also containing two extra huge grids with of 80
MB & 73 MB each; the latter for just one state in Germany).

Putting it in the regular proj directory from within QGIS might also not be
possible, when a regular user runs QGIS.  And internet access to download is
also not a given.

In OSGeo4W this isn't a problem.  Downloading from within the standalone
installer could be an option, but that kind of ruins the point of having a
standalone installer.

Hi, Jürgen,

Thanks for explaining the situation. 500MB is definitely too large and 
it would be useless data for most users.

Might it be an option to store grid-shift files alternatively also in 
the QGIS user directory - I mean the folder where the user stores his 
settings, plugins, expressions. I agree that many users wouldn't have 
access to the main install directory.

Alternatively, would it be possible to integrate an additional 
step/choice in the standalone installer that would download grid-shift 
files of interest for the user?

Thanks,

Andreas

Why not ship with the same grids that come with proj-datumgrid (or what
QGIS typically ships in MacOSX and Windows. Then all other full grids need
to be downloaded on request. This way, the user experience is no worse than
it is currently, and there is the added benefit of being able to download
grids when needed quickly.

Cheers
Jeremy

How do we tell which shift files are of interest?

I guess that one reason for it being one big blob is that nobody knows the
extent of interest for all the individual grids (or CRSes).

I don't know which grids you use, you probably don't know which I use - and
we're even on a close longitude. ;)

Picking from 245 grids is probably not desirable either.

Hi Jürgen,

I thought that we could present a list of available grids (e.g. from 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-data ) to the user where all grids are 
deactivated by default and the user could opt-in. Just like other 
software would offer e.g. a list of templates or similar.

Of course we don't know automatically what grids are of interest.

So far so good, but I'd really like to stop having all these
differences among providers, there is too much Postgres specific
implementation in QGIS now.

At least for use estimated metadata, and "trust" options we should
agree on a minimal set of provider-agnostic options that the different
providers can support and expose through capability flags.

The options should be ideally settable per-layer (as part of the data
source URI) and with a per-project default that applies when there is
no such information in the individual layer URI.

My main concern is that we currently have a whole lot of
undocumented/hidden behaviors and slight variations among different
providers and we should really try hard to homogenize them and
eventually converge towards a unified interface with more shared
capabilities.

Kind regards

In PRØJ 7 the grid files were turned to tif and are not packaged individually
anymore, probably because proj can downloaded them individually on demand now
- but we apparently don't use that.

That still means picking from 245 grids - but we could point them to
https://cdn.proj.org/ and just tell them where to put the grids they want from
the installer.

I'd suggest to reavaluate that. proj-datumgrid grew organically, without a 
particular thinking of which grids were essential, and which were not. Maybe 
looking at the countries where most QGIS users live could be a way of taking 
an informed decision. I guess the UK grid could be relevant for example in a 
base package.

They have been converted to TIF, but I thought these new files were still
the same logical separated grids as published by agencies? Can we just
distribute a subset of what's in the new data package which is the same as
proj-datumgrid?

I can imagine it is frustrating for users. It would be better not to have
the system fid at all.

We originally asked for this feature to be implemented in QGIS a few years
back - so we are to blame! Our issue was GeoPackage files were being
created from a data service with the source data primary key set as the
FID, and we couldn’t see this PK data in QGIS. This situation has now
changed, and the fid and source primary keys are both in the GPKG now.
However, the other issue with removing the fid column, is we have python
scripts using GDAL, creating GeoPackages with the layer creation options of
FID=id. This was so we can easily apply change-sets the database using the
GDAL Python API of `layer.GetFeature(fid)` rather than having to use
`layer.SetAttributeFilter(‘ID=XXX’)` (which also requires the creation of a
user index to be efficient). We also support PostGIS, MSSQL, and FileGDB
data sources in this same way. Happy if people have some thoughts on better
ways to do this :-) Maybe we can change QGIS only to display the GPKG FID
if it is not set to ‘fid”? I guess there might be other issues with that
approach in terms of editing...

Cheers

Is this the pretended behaviour? It's because there is another change in
GDAL/PROJ in an ongoing LTR release, and I'm afraid that it can lead to
similar problems occurred in QGIS 3.4 with GDAL/PROJ.

Debugging this on Travis is an hell. Problem is some tests fail on
Travis but succeed on my system. The processing one is too big, but
this simple one succeeds locally:

  [strk at liz:/usr/src/qgis/build/do-not-override-source-files] ctest -R qgis_distanceareatest

While it fails on Travis!

How could that be explained ? Different PROJ version maybe ?

Hi Sebastian,

Are you looking for a function like ST_MaxDistance [1] available in
PostGIS?

I'm not aware of such function in QGIS, but it can be implemented in PyQGIS.

Best regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Hi All

A while ago we had a discussion here on the mailing list about adding Network logging to QGIS, similar to what you can do in your browser[1]. Nyall at the time (maybe others) was concerned about security implications of including a network logging tool in QGIS. We were wondering what specific security impacts could be expected (as opposed to for example installing Richard’s very nice logger plugin)[2]? In other words, is there really a good rationale not to port this to C++ and integrate into QGIS core? I think it is very broadly useful for anyone working with remote layers and trying to figure out why they are not loading...

Tim

+1 to port to C++ (disclosure: we are funding this feature).  This is
valuable functionality for
many users in our organization both from the perspective of developing and
testing our APIs
as well as QGIS users proper.

(cos Qt), so a malicious plugin will always be able to capture the
requests. In fact, having it in c++ will potentially lower the risk,
cos there's less need for 3rd party plugins to cover this use case

that one can be implicitly trusted -- this concern would only extend
to other future network logger style plugins from other sources!).

Also, it's **extremely** useful.

Now, some thoughts:
- it would **definitely** need to be ported to c++. The plugin has an
issue where it slows down after logging and displaying many requests
in the tree. Both Richard and I spent considerable time trying to
avoid this, with minimal results. A c++ version should give us more
flexibility to address the performance issue. (and note: this IS a
serious issue, as it can cause the whole QGIS UI to slow, not just the
network logger dock)
- some nice icons are definitely required :)

Hi Nyall

Great to hear you are now more open to having this kind of logging in QGIS. Our budget and budgeted time for adding logging is pretty small (in the order to 1-2 days work). I suspect Richard has sunk quite a considerable amount of time into making his plugin so beautiful and functional. I think there is a good use case for building something more simple in core - a checkbox in settings to enable logging web requests, and a simple text output in the QgsLogMessage of each URL as it is called, along with the return code for the request. In my little universe, Richard's plugin would then still exist as the ‘Ferrari version, whilst out of the box our users have some basic tooling for debugging their services that are not playing nice. 

Regards

Tim

That's already possible, and it's how the "install grid" buttons work
(they copy to this folder)

My issue is that 99% of modern GIS users (made up number, based on
personal experience alone) have no idea what a "grid shift file" is,
what it's used for, and the consequence of not having it. We'd have to
be very very careful in how we present any option like this, e.g.
don't mention "grid shift" at all, but instead something like
"localised support files".

Not just QGIS. The auto-download behavior is an opt-in switch for
applications, it's not the default behavior.

I can't find any application which use the CDN by default -- searching
github for proj_context_set_enable_network only gets hits in proj
itself. And I'd really like consistent behavior here, so that users
who install QGIS through osgeo4w can get the same transformation
results regardless if they use QGIS application, GDAL command line, or
GRASS tools via processing... (which is why I keep coming back to the
"screw it, this is too complex to solve case-by-case, lets just
install them ALL for EVERYONE" option).

That said, users CAN still enable this for any application by setting
the environment variable PROJ_NETWORK. I'd be interested to hear
results if someone on a proj 7 build wants to test how this actually
impacts QGIS in practice.

I cannot agree more. We can use the news panel as a temporary measure to
help people understanding, but we cannot rely on this.

PROJ 7 has been out for 23 days. Give everyone a chance to catch up, please.
And honestly, I think many developers look at what you guys are doing, so
expect to be the front-runners on this. 

The PROJ conda-forge package defaults to PROJ_NETWORK=ON unless
the proj-data package is installed [0], so this is out in the wild already. The
QGIS package has PROJ pinned at 6.3.1 it is not available for QGIS but
most other packages requiring PROJ will default to auto-downloading grids
from the CDN.

A point to be made here, is that if everyone uses the auto-downloading
mechanism then consistency will be achieved across the board. Obviously
the various projects using PROJ will have differing timelines with regards
to adopting PROJ 7, so even if everyone is setting PROJ_NETWORK=ON
it will take time to achieve that consistent behaviour, so please don’t let that
be your guiding light on how to proceed with this.

I think a cross-project discussion on this is warranted. It would be nice if
everyone is more or less aligned. I think this is a great topic for the OSGeo
code sprint but given current circumstances I doubt that event will be held
as scheduled. 

Would the choice have been obvious if auto-downloading was turned on
by default?

Hi,

I'm ok with pulling it (or a slim version) into c++..

What is the main reason to pull it into QGIS? Because it started of as a
hack using some events from QgsNetworkManager. Nyall then added a lot
more events so more information could be retrieved.
But the plugin itself is actually nothing more then 'catching' those
events and showing them. Most stuff is gui  stuff.

So: what would be the actual benefit (except that everybody will have
it... mmm, also people never working with web-based data....)?

Also note that this started of as a slim/simple tool, just logging the
url's to the QMessageLog, see this version and screenshot:

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/qgisnetworklogger/tree/V0.1.0

I agree with Nyall that current implementation has some limitations,
mainly because of the nice treeview and the lookups that occur to fill
all the details that fill the tree.

Indeed I spend A LOT of time to make this tree not crash anymore
(especially when you delete a part of it, or when you try to filter it).
But having it as a plugin which you can remove/disable is in this way a
good thing I would say.

One thing to note (IF somebody is funding this): it would be great to
have some communication between gdal and it's requests and QGIS too
(Nyall talked about this earlier with Even). Some requests are not
handled by QGIS anymore, but done by GDAL. So these are currently being
missed.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,
Due to ongoing COVID 19 situation , I get unique opportunity for refine my
skills by incorporating best practices into my open source projects.

In this line, I would like to develop test cases  for my QGIS plugin.
Any idea , reference or any mentor who can guide me through this?

My plugin name is QRealTime.

Hi,

I've been advancing a bit on the testing topic. I'll gladly do a
Googe Hangout with you. We can probably learn from each other.

What I found on the internet involves creating a dummy interface, which is
great if you want to do Continuous Integration and such, but this wasn't
the way I wanted to test. I wanted to be able to see what was happening
right there in the live GUI.

It took a while before I discovered that there is a mini editor in the
Python console. Now I'm launching my test code from there and this works
great. QTest allows me to press buttons or enter values and unit testing
allows me to verify it's all as expected.

I can show you in about half an hour, if you're available, or later.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Is pandas package inside QGIS ?
Message-ID: <CAKsx1pn-+x+aVW1M5Zz4ocGPo6mc+tC49JC4NN6Xv54_ZZuetw@mail.gmail.com>

On Windows installation from standalone installer 64bits, pandas
disappeared in QGIS version *3.10.3 LTR*. But pandas was present in 3.10.0
(pandas version 0.25.1) and is present in 3.12.0. (pandas version 1.0.1)

from Python console inside QGIS:

import pandas
pandas.__version__

Is there a reason for this inconsistency ?
Is pandas package inside QGIS standalone installer ?

*to be linked to issue #32212 which is closed but defends the usefulness of
pandas inside QGIS*

The dummy interface was mainly with QGIS 2. You don't need it anymore.

You can read :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/.docker

I will try to make a PR on qgis about Docker this week about some notes I
have.

Hi Etienne,

I partially but respectfully disagree. I agree that other tools are 
better for this use case. But a mock (dummy) interface is still a valid 
tool to check which API's are called how many times and in which way on 
a headless testing server / CI. Also on QGIS 3.

Best regards

Matthias

Hi,

Sorry, I was mainly thinking about this one :
https://github.com/g-sherman/Qgis-Plugin-Builder/blob/master/test/qgis_interface.py
We can find it in many plugins.
Is it still needed ?

I totally agree, the mock iface provided by QGIS core is still useful!

Message-ID: <CAGiKOugdUstf7SMwojp4_S4246rCU-LBSpwKsfEceVnXDH-EsQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I was trying to build QGIS using visual studio 2019 and found that the 2
scripts msvc-env.bat and configonly.bat is using an old visual studio
version (the paths to the compiler are clearly for an old). Is it required
to use an older version or just a bug ?
Link to the scripts :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/ms-windows/osgeo4w/msvc-env.bat
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/ms-windows/osgeo4w/configonly.bat

Have a nice day and stay safe,
Regads

Hi,
It is now clear that mock interface is helpful  in testing plugin.
But now , can we list step by step documentation  for starters like me.

Hi Sebastian,

Here's a little python script that works on a vector layer containing 2 
lines. Just as an example.

Hope it helps,
Raymond




# calculates the maximum distance between 2 lines
# in the active vector layer

line_layer = iface.activeLayer()
nf = line_layer.featureCount()

if not nf == 2:
     print('layer must have 2 features')
else:

     feat1 = line_layer.getFeature(1)
     geom1 = feat1.geometry()
     feat2 = line_layer.getFeature(2)
     geom2 = feat2.geometry()

     max_dist = 0

     vert1 = geom1.vertices()
     for p1 in vert1:
         vert2 = geom2.vertices()
         for p2 in vert2:
             dist = p1.distance(p2)
             if dist > max_dist:
                 max_dist = dist
                 max_p1 = p1
                 max_p2 = p2

     if max_dist > 0:
         print('max distance: {})'.format(max_dist))
         print('LINESTRING({} {}, {} {})'.format(
             max_p1.x(), max_p1.y(), max_p2.x(), max_p2.y() ))

Hi Belgacem

I think is simply based on the version of MSVC that Jürgen (our
windows release guru) uses to build OSGeo4W and QGIS. I am not sure
how is it with support of other versions of MSVC - if that's supported
at all - maybe Jürgen could comment better.

Generally, I would strongly suggest that you use Linux for QGIS
development if you can. I would say it what 90% of QGIS developers use
and the developer experience is the best (and with largest pool of
people able to help if things are not working as expected). On Windows
the compilation sometimes involves furious shouting at the computer
screen :-)

Cheers
Martin

Sorry, wasn't intending that to be criticism. It's just a reflection
of where things are right now.

Honestly, I think QGIS needs to step back for a couple of releases and
let other projects lead the way on relying on newer proj features.
Through no fault of the proj library, we've had a rocky road over the
last couple of releases wrt transformations, and I'd very much like to
get some nice stable releases out before we push things forward again
on this front. My belief is that we should have resolved all the
nasties in 3.10.3 and 3.12.1 and should be finally back providing
stable transformation handling.

On another note, which I raised in either discussion on the proj list
or with Even directly (I can't recall now), but I just don't think
it's possible for us to deliver a good user experience if we use the
proj 7 inbuilt auto download feature. My reasoning being:
- transformations are all blocking operations in qgis -- we can't
process them async
- many transformations occur on the main thread. E.g. during the
preparation steps for a background map render, transformations are
done on the main thread in a blocking way. And when moving the mouse
over the canvas, many transformations are occurring in order to update
the status bar, process the current map tool correctly, etc. These
**can't** be delegated to a background thread, it's just not possible.
- understandably, transformations in the proj library are also
blocking. So when a transform is requested which requires a grid
section download, the calling application (qgis) will be blocked while
this download occurs
- the consequences are that transformations will be happening on the
main thread which may take many seconds (or more, on a bad connection)
to return. This will be unpredictable and will result in very poor UX
-- QGIS will just appear to be hanging and stuttering randomly during
normal operations.
- We can't even give users feedback about what's happening during
these hangs -- the main thread will be blocked, so we can't show
anything in the GUI to let users know that things are downloading in
the background and that QGIS will unfreeze when this is done!

It's a **great** feature for command line applications and scripting
tools, but I just can't see anyway to nicely take advantage of it from
a GUI application like QGIS. (ideas welcome!.. e.g. maybe if proj
offered a background "pre-fetch" grid API then we could trigger that
when a grid is first requested and immediately return a non-grid based
result, giving users feedback via a task report that more accurate
results will be shortly available. That's a lot of complexity on both
proj/qgis side though, vs just forcing every install to have every
grid ever, by default!!)

We've also got to consider users with no internet connection, and no
knowledge in advance of the need for grids... ouch!

> Would the choice have been obvious if auto-downloading was turned on
> by default?

Nope - see above. I'd have hardcoded a call in to automatically switch
it back off until we can deliver a good user experience!

Hey all,

Any ideas what happened to the 3.12.1/3.10.4 releases? They aren't
available for download, despite being tagged last week. Has something
broken/delayed these releases?

I noticed the counter on the main qgis.org website is also missing the
countdown for the next round of patch releases too... is this linked?

Cheers,
Nyall

Message-ID: <c8b23674-87d5-d80a-ec17-8945749c2062@ggr-planung.de>

Hey there,

i am developing a plugin for QGIS heavily relying on the *pandas 
*library. I was quite happy to notice that pandas was put into the 
standalone installation since 3.8. So there was no need to install QGIS 
via the Network-Installer with pandas checked anymore.

In 3.10.3 LTR pandas is gone again (next to lxml that i use too), in 
3.12 it is still included. Is there a reason that the dev-versions are 
delivered with different libraries than the LTR-versions? I think that 
is kind of confusing for plugin developers.

I would love to have pandas in the LTRs again.

best regards,

Christoph

Nyall, don't know the backstory (if any), but 3.12.1 has appeared sometime in
the past 6-7 hours or so, at least through the OSGeo4W installer, which
calls it 3.12.1-2 I believe. Uses proj 6.3.1.

Hurrah!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] UI for enum Processing parameters
Message-ID: <CALuHMPDsi3sKUc0R7ooJ1UwVwAqAEu6F0Bdhh2obsYsx7PMOug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

currently Processing uses pop-up dialog for enum parameters with multiple
selection allowed and combobox for enums with single selection. The good
thing about pop-up dialog is that very large lists are easier to manage, but
at the same time I don't think there are/will be algorithms with many
enum values.
On other hand opening pop-up on top of the algorithm dialog can be considired
as bad UI, also this is a bit not consistent with single-selection enum case.

I'm wondering if we should switch multiple selection enums to use checkable
combobox to unify UI with single selection case? Another option will be to use
inline panel approach added by Nyall today.

Opinions?

Just noticed that pandas and lxml are included again in the 3.10.4 LTR 
released today. Nice! Does it stay this way?

Hi all,

Please let me know if you have any expenses around the cancelled

The idea is that you try to get refunds from hotels / AirBNB or your

see if QGIS.ORG can cover these expenses.

Thanks and greetings,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Splitting Docker utils from core repo ?
Message-ID: <20200324154740.GA12660@liz>

I'm looking at the official qgis/qgis docker images for use
in plugin testing and wondering why such support is part
of the main qgis repository.

Why not, you'd ask ?

Well, I found some issues with the qgis_setup.sh script for
example, and filing an issue against the main qgis repo, which
already has more than 3500 issues pending, sounds like adding
a drop in an ocean.

The issue is that running the qgis_setup.sh script exits with
a success exit code and no text printed to tell me if it did
anything, while it looks to me it didn't do anything...

Other issues are related to the README file in the docker dir,
which seems to be talking about Travis too much, while not
all plugin developers are using Travis to test their plugin.

See also

Two problems :

   - What are the variables to tell where is Grass 7 path installation for
   my cmake3 call ?
   Is not clearly defined in ../cmake/FindGRASS.cmake like others cmake
   files ?


   - Could someone help me to understand what is missing in my system or
   compile parameters :-)

I can post CMakeOutput.log or CMakeError.log, but i don't be sure that this
mailing accept this type of sending...

It would be great if we could all learn from each other, using this
mailing list would help with that (Hangout in pairs would prevent
others from learning and helping).

I'm mentioning this because I'm also trying to plan plugin testing,
currently looking at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/.docker#running-tests-for-a-python-plugin
as a starting point, but finding some fragile support scripts
on my way (the README itself contains instructions to "fix" what
the `qgis_setup.sh` script does...)

Hi Victor,

Have you qtbase5-dev package installed? I think it is missing in you
system. Can you check, please?

Hi Victor,

Maybe yours qt5-qtbase-devel-5.9.7-2.el7.x86_64 is the same as mine
qtbase5-dev. I'm not on CentOS, sorry.

Your compiler is complaining about QIODevice. In my QT, QIODevice is
defined in qtbase5-dev package. I'm using QT 5.12 (not 5.9).

Try to find in your CentOS this QIODevice class.

Regards,

Jorge

The first idea was that everything was in a single place: it forces
original devs to complete the possible new deps in the Dockerfile and ease
CI by having everything grouped.
I agree that the situation is not optimal nowadays, mainly because the size
of the image has grown a lot due to dependencies used only for testing
purposes.

There are quite some people doing an amazing job on triaging and most of
the time the involved devs are quite willing to discuss.
Please give a try.

All this work has been done on a voluntary basis and is really hard to keep
up to date.
Any improvment is more than welcome.
If github is really not your cup of tea, I guess we can also accept patches
by emails (gentle poke, sorry)

More generally, I don't think people in the community is against
progressive changes. It's just way more motivating to turn the sentences in
a positive manner, and to try to drive the changes.

Best wishes,

Denis

Hello Jorge, thanks for your reply :-)
As you guess qtbase5-dev is for debian and equivalent is 
qt5-qtbase-devel-5.9.7-2.el7.x86_64 for Centos

QIDevice is not present in this package but after some search I found is 
present in qtiocompressor-2.3.1-5.el7.nux.x86_64 and 
qtiocompressor-devel-2.3.1-5.el7.nux.x86_64

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] triggerRepaint()
Message-ID: <CAGKduJ1LX0eTegBeWXiiEBURw=9C+=kq-PtZj5AMxRc0NjdjVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I discovered that triggerRepaint() is working on:

  QgsMapCanvas.currentLayer()

but NOT in one of the layers in:

  QgsProject.instance().layers()

I use triggerRepaint to force the update in the mapcanvas, after a Postgis
sql INSERT query.

Is there another way to do this?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problems implementing a plugin to work layers
	offline
Message-ID: <CAGE4Lhd-hKKNYV1KO928FDJqJWg796oWNascfe13-Rad+1pk4A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am new to the plugin programming for Qgis, I am trying to create one
project with offline layers and later update the database in postgis. I was
reviewing some documentation and plugin on the subject, but I am unable to
solve a problem I am having.
I am creating the offline project in  geopackage or spatialite, but when I
delete objects or modify and synchronize, it shows me the same objects that
I downloaded from the database. What am I doing wrong?
This is part of my code:

def download_project(self):
    """Download selected project to convert it offline."""
    proj = QgsProject.instance()

    project_name = proj.title()

    layer_ids_to_download = [
        layer_id
        for layer_id, layer in proj.mapLayers().items()

    ]
    offliner = QgsOfflineEditing()
    offliner.convertToOfflineProject('D:\\temp',project_name+'.sqlite',layer_ids_to_download,onlySelected=False,
                                     containerType=QgsOfflineEditing.SpatiaLite)
def sincronizar(self):
    offliner = QgsOfflineEditing()
    offliner.synchronize()


Regards,
Salas

No - this approach is correct and should work. Can you share a
complete self-contained example?

Message-ID: <CAB900JX5cn=JHLFfxNjh9zm1vARz67zrd4asT_QMu03HtW5UoQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am experiencing errors after installing QGIS  using the Osgeo setup file
on a windows 10 machine.

This happened on a second windows 10  machine (first on a laptop and then
on a desktop.

I  do some development and install almost all the libraries with source
code.  The installation itself brought an error message about a jvm.exe not
being found.  I happen to have a jdk 13 installed and i can't understand
why this error comes in the first place.  And then QGIS never starts at all.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

I'm really sorry to hear this (even though it was fully expected!) ...
we were really looking forward to seeing everyone again and spending
some relaxing time in the woods again!

Hi devs,

Since we don't have the city name for the next QGIS version, can we just
call Pi to version 3.14?

Best regards,

Jorge

Another name we still have not used for a release is the first ever
hackfest in Hannover in 2009 organized by Otto Dassau. That event
started the whole tradition of meetings :-)

Same applies to 's-hertogenbosch :)

Not a common name :D

Hi,

QGIS 2.16 was already called "Nødebo".

We need to come up with something else. "Pi" would be a good one.

Or some sensible name with a reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 
honor of all the people who suffered a lot from it - but that might be a 
negative connotation. But basically the whole world suffered from it in 
one way or the other.

Or we could pick the village/city of some core QGIS developer, 
preferably from a remote place where we haven't had a meeting yet - e.g. 
Alex' place in Ukraine?

Greetings,

Andreas

Yes, Hannover would be a good choice.

given the actual situation there is also the option to call it "world"
or "earth" or something similar.

We already had a QGIS release named to a location (Copiapó) that was
not a place that held a dev meeting, but that was under thee world
eyes because of a very distressful situation. Now the whole planet is
in distress (without mentioning other disasters like global warming,
pollution, Trump, and the alike) so I think that it would deserve our
consideration.

Hi Samweli,

I had the same issue. I was also using PROJ 7, and getting an identical
error. It looks like this issue might be related to this one:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/35195, so this looks unlikely to be an
isolated issue.

I was able to resolve by downgrading to PROJ 6.3.1, but clearly that isn't
a long-term solution. I'm not clear whether this is related to Proj 7
itself or the way that QGIS is using it.

with this in mind 'Gaia' (mother earth goddess) would be a nice choice.

I must say I also like the idea of 3.14 being Pi.
and at some point there should be a version named after Hannover!

Ten +1’s for this idea…and let’s make sure to have at least 15 patch releases so we can have 3.1415 out in the wild :-)

Things I noticed from the above slide:

1. I still had lots of hair :-)
2. The carrying capacity of a small staircase in 2009 was equal to a major part of the QGIS developer community
3. We called hackfests “hackfests” and the world did not end


Also, further back in time, Marco Hugentobler, Jens Oberender and his pal (name since forgotten) and I met up in Karlsruhe for the first unofficial QGIS hackfest in 2004 [1]. That was the first time that any QGIS developers met each other in person I believe.

Another nice name candidate would be Anchorage in honour of our project founder who doesn’t get nearly enough credit other than an early splash screen containing a picture of his dog, Bandit (which would be a cool release name if it didn’t break our naming convention :-P).

I think that "Gaia" would be a brilliant name.

Just to prove that we can do Pi without breaking convention: https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/details.php?osmtype=N&osmid=5046582578&class=place <https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/details.php?osmtype=N&osmid=5046582578&class=place> (there are various other Pi’s around the world it seems).

I'd caution against this. Just like if we named a release "QGIS 3.16
Jesus Christ" or "QGIS 3.18 L Ron Hubbard" or "QGIS 4.0 - Santa
Claus", this naming would raise difficult cultural issues which are
easier to just avoid.

I think we could come up with a name with a similar intention/message
whilst avoiding the tricky spiritual contentions this particular one
raises.

What about

QGIS "Remote"?

Or QGIS "made from homes"

Or "QGIS stayed at home"

QuarantineGIS or QGIS "COVID edition" could be good candidates but are a
bit too much of dark humor I guess.

And I imagine the banner with a nice worldmap background and a subtle image
of children passing behind the webcam?


Sorry ---> me out. Hum in fact I can't. Staying in.
Day 12.

Take care

Nope - it HAS to be this:

It's our ONE chance to use a board game map as a splash screen!

Except for European residents who will see this on their splash:

“Unfortunately, our website is currently unavailable in most European countries. We are engaged on the issue and committed to looking at options that support our full range of digital offerings to the EU market.

Or just use 3.14.1, 3.14.15, 3.14.159, 3.14.1592 for point releases.

TeX is at 3.14159265.

Also, please consider that using special characters in the release name, if
not handled properly, could lead to bugs as for București
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/35453)

or that a different style in numbering releases will change the user-agent
string (now like "QGIS/31003") and could affect the version check mechanism
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/34685#issuecomment-605712536)

Regards.

right,

if Raymond at all are still available to host the meeting in August (virus
permitting), instead waiting for the next year. I suppose it's also a way
to maintain local sponsorship (and logistic) local organisers were able to
activate.

Hi Stephen, 

Thanks a lot for your help, I have downgraded to PROJ 6.3.1 by installing it
from source. Now I get this error

[ 39%] Built target pyqtcompat
make[2]: *** No rule to make target
'/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libspatialite.so', needed by
'output/lib/libqgis_core.so.3.13.0'.  Stop.
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1320: recipe for target
'src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/all' failed
make[1]: *** [src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:162: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2

When I try to install libspatialite, it also installs PROJ 7, causing to
revert to the previous "invalid pointer" error!!

Hi Samweli,

I was able to fix it last night with Proj 7 by doing the following (I have
a custom build of gdal, spatialite, qgis and proj):

- purge all libproj < 19 from /usr/local/lib or wherever your custom files
are kept
- Compile and install proj 7
- Recompile libspatialite against proj 7 (to do that I not only had to
specify the location for proj as above, but also set the
CFLAGS"-DACCEPT_USE_OF_DEPRECATED_PROJ_API_H=1" in configure
- Recompile gdal against new libspatialite and proj7
- Finally recompile QGIS

Sorry, sent too quickly.

I was going to say I'm not sure why I had to set the flag for spatialite,
as https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=PROJ.6 implies
that it is no longer required. But I was definitely getting an error on a
checkout from the fossil build from one of the files in the
gaiageo directory, so it's possible this support is not complete yet.
Spatialite being a bit of a perennial laggard in terms of updates recently.

There is no (pre-)release of spatialite with support for PROJ >= 6 yet,
only the fossil repo has that support.

Since there haven't been any (pre-)releases since July 2018, it's highly
unlikely that any will be made any time soon.

QGIS & GDAL should ensure that they build successfully without
spatialite because the package will be removed from Debian when PROJ 8
is released in March 2021 (which will remove proj_api.h).

Bas

Hey Luigi,

At first I wouldn't even think about this! But maybe it makes sense, if 
the virus has disappeared by then. Dutch weather in August is also 
slightly better than in March by the way. :)

We would not be able to work in the Red Cross building, so we would need 
to find another location. Also a location with some outdoor space would 
be nice in summer.

Let's wait and see how the corona measures evolve. We could also go for 
autumn or even later.

Kind regards,

Raymond

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] "GetMap" URL from WMS layers
Message-ID: <c2c972eb-3ec8-14f8-b85f-0890d6a4d657@jakobmiksch.eu>

Dear list,

I want to extract the "GetMap" URL from WMS layers. For most of the WMS 
layers I can extract it from "layer.source()". However this does not 
work for WMS layers where "GetMap" and "GetCapabilities" is different. 
Like for this layer: 
https://www.geoportal.rlp.de/mapbender/php/wms.php?inspire=1&layer_id=69694&withChilds=1&INSPIRE=1& 


The only place where I can find the "GetMap" URL is inside the 
"layer.htmlMetadata()" document. From there the URL can be extracted 
using REGEX. But every localization of QGIS (e.g. German, French ...) 
have different terms for the surrounding "GetMap" HTML element. This 
makes this approach quite tricky.

Is there any more elegant solution how to retrieve the "GetMap" URL from 
WMS layers?

Thanks in advance and best wishes,
Jakob

Try Richard's great 'QGIS Network Logger' plugin, to see all WMS 
requests.  I've recorded several options here to grab the GetMap url:

Hugo,

sorry for posting so late but i have the following question after this
exchange :

when it come to 'order' the operators why do u advise to write
 
*lie._search_frame_ = tbap.geometry* and not :

/tbap._search_frame_ =lie.geometry/

What is the logic behind this syntax ?

Thanks !

Hi everyone,

I am still trying to wrap my head around plugin management. Looking at
(Python) plugin metadata, I have a few questions.

The meta data contains the fields `experimental` and `deprecated`.
Having written plugins, I believe that certain versions of a plugin (but
not "the entire plugin", i.e. all of its versions of it at once) can be
"experimental". So `experimental` is actually a property of a plugin
version. Am I correctly understanding this?

As far as `deprecated` goes, I have not figured out the dynamics yet. Is
it also tied to a version or does a plugin author mark all (past)
versions of a plugin as deprecated by uploading a deprecated "final"
release?

What's the story behind `trusted`? I'd guess that plugins of this kind
can be published without a review and a plugin manager on the client
should not care about this field.

I understand that `id` is *the* unique identifier for a plugin.
Eventually, it will be the folder name of the plugin module and it
usually equals the name of the plugin distribution zip-file (without the
`.zip` file extension). If this is correct: What's the purpose of
`zip_repository`? Its description reads "the remote repository id".

Reading through the original plugin manager's code, there are actually a
few more meta data fields that appear to be undocumented (or at least
not listed in a central place): `hasProcessingProvider` and `server`,
both of them more or less booleans. Just to be safe here: Is my
understanding correct that there are basically three types of Python
plugins: "regular", server and processing provider?

Best regards,
Sebastian

Hi,

You will find some answers in the QGIS Documentation about "deprecated",
"hasProcessingProvider" ...
https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins/plugins.html#plugin-metadata
I'm going to add the "server" one.

> So `experimental` is actually a property of a plugin version. Am I
correctly understanding this?

Yes. Have a look here with the two columns :
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/DataPlotly/

> As far as `deprecated` goes, I have not figured out the dynamics yet. Is

versions of a plugin as deprecated by uploading a deprecated "final"
release?

A plugin is deprecated, not a single version. Plugins which are in red
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/

For the "trusted", if I'm correct, this does not exist anymore since QGIS
3.0.

A plugin can be designed for desktop or/and for server.
Then a plugin can have or not a processing provider (not related to the
statement before).

I have been thinking about this and what are the pros and cons of
having a separate window for georeferencing vs doing georeferencing in
main map canvas. Actually rather than discussing whether to have one
or two windows, the key bit to decide on is something else - what
would be the coordinate system of the georeferencer canvas:

A. image coordinates - that is what we have in QGIS georeferencer now:
the image gets loaded without any distortion and stays that way all
the time. Picking of map coordinates for GCPs has to be done in a
separate map canvas. (i.e. one click in "georeferencer canvas", and
one click in "reference map canvas")

B. map coordinates - that is what ArcGIS does. The image is placed at
some initial position in the map, picking of image coordinates and map
coordinates for GCPs is done in the same map canvas. (i.e. two clicks
in single map canvas)

The option B has the advantage that it is quite easy/intuitive to have
live preview of the image transformation as GCPs are being added. With
option A the live preview of the transform is not really possible (we
are still in image coordinates) - and the preview would need to be in
a separate map canvas.

So where I am hesitating is whether to stick to option A which is
probably familiar to QGIS users - or with option B that may provide
better UX thanks to the live update of the warped raster (or vector).
I guess we will need to choose one or the other - supporting both
options would be probably too confusing. I am trying to figure out
which way to take, because this will also have great impact on the
workflow on how GCPs would be picked on the map(s) using map tools...

Thanks for your thoughts :-)

Cheers
Martin

Well - kind of. We do some stuff in image coordinates, yet confusingly
require a CRS selection when first loading a raster (which I believe
is used for nothing at all), and then the map coordinates of GCPs have
an innate CRS too (which can be changed when you actually save the
image, causing all sorts of weirdness!)

I think option B makes much more sense. It may act different to what
users are used to, but my experience is that users find the current
approach confusing. I certainly do myself, and that's a bad sign. I've
also wasted a lot of time over the years fixing mine/others
georefencing errors caused by the confusing mix of CRS options in the
current georeferencer.

Reasons I like option B:
- the live updates you've mentioned above
- we know exactly what CRS already recorded GCPs are in, so we can
easily transform them to a different CRS if at time of saving the user
does decide to pick a different CRS vs what they've done the
registration in

My one question: where do you initially place the image? Do you just
throw it in the middle of the current canvas extent as a starting
point?

Just to expand on this -- this tag was added to aid in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/34617 , and expose the metadata
about whether a particular plugin has processing capabilities or not.
The standalone tool will only load plugins which expose processing
capabilities (since the others are of no value to the tool, and just
slow down startup time).

It's completely independent from other options though -- you can have
plugins which add all kinds of things to the QGIS interface and also
expose processing capabilities (e.g. DataPlotly). Likewise you could
potentially have a plugin which exposes server capabilities AND
processing functionality.

Hope that clarifies!

I'm +1 for B as well !

Two window makes it much easier to mix things up. And with live preview, B
will get really intuitive (unless working with very heavy non-linear
deformations, but then it's a mess anyways).

About initial placement, if we have live preview, maybe the image could
just "float" (filling the canvas, not affected by zoom or pan) until
there's a point pair to pin it. That would make it clear that the raster
isn't georeferenced yet, work well with the "add more GCP = get more
precision" feeling, and most importantly avoid annoying high factor zoom
in/out if the initial position/scale didn't match the desired position.

Looking forward for this improvement very much :-)

Cheers,

Olivier

Stephen, thanks again, I was able to compile QGIS successfully after building
libspatialite from source as you indicated.
Many thanks, I truly appreciate your help in this!!

Initially ArcMap places the image wherever it's local coordinate system
(from its source e.g. scanner) places it within the data frame. Usually
this is quite far from the area of interest.  However, ArcMap has a 'Fit to
Display' option on the georeferencing toolbar.
The workflow is 1) add the image, 2) zoom to where it should fall, 3) click
the Fit to Display button which moves it to the ballpark area, 4) begin
adding control points.
I think this would be improved by having it initially land in the middle of
the current map extent. Then its position could be adjusted with a similar
button.

While I like the live preview of option B, I find this option difficult 
to use when georeferencing the raw image against a raster dataset such 
as an aerial photograph. The top raster in the drawing order, e.g. the 
raw image, covers the bottom raster as the live image transformation 
proceeds, requiring the top raster to be toggled on/off when identifying 
GCPs. In this case I find the current dual window approach is better as 
the images can be placed side-by-side for easier identification of GCPs.
