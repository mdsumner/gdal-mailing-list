Hi J?rgen and Tim,

I'm going to look at it next monday when I'm back from holidays.

Yes, this function is in use for polygon splitting. However, I don't remember how important the call for cutEdges function really is. It is possible that this section aborts polygon splits where the splitting line doesn't go through the whole polygon.

Regards,
Marco

I think we would cause a riot if we disable split feature. Marco is
that your tool (split feature) - is there any way we can use a geos
c-api call there? Would be good to do so and get Jefs changes into
trunk then.

For the moment you can find a sample dataset here:

http://www.faunalia.it/animov/scripts/sample.csv

I'll provide a on-board dataset in the near future, together with a little tutorial.

I'm sure that, with present revision, on Windows systems the plugin can't find
the R scripts needed for analysis. I'll solve it next week. Let me know if on
Mac there are similar problems.

many thanks!

Great. I'll fetch it. The svn url you gave seems to for the top level
dir (including hooks etc) - was that intentional? I guess its just the
'prova' dir that needs to go into the plugins folder?

> I'll provide a on-board dataset in the near future, together with a little tutorial.

Great.

> (why, why windows doesn't use slashes as separators? portability is a _headache_!!)

Since you have Qt4 at your fingertips look at QDir::separator() which
will give the correct string for the OS separator. There is also a
call on QDir::nativeSeparators(QString) which will convert a path to
the platform native separator format. Both are static calls so you
dont need an instance first.

 Or in python there's os.path.join:

Linux:
>>> import os
>>> os.path.join("foo","bar")
'foo/bar'

Windows:
>>> os.path.join("foo","bar")
'foo\\bar'

VAX/VMS:
>>> os.path.join("foo","bar")
'foo.bar'

 (I made that last one up, but VAX/VMS paths used to be of the form
device:[dir.dir] if I recall correctly!)

Various other functions under os.path are useful for filename and path
manipulation.

Yes, the url I gave contains also svn stuff. I have to cleanup the repo. I
updated the wiki page with the correct url:
svn://home.prea.net/svn/GSoC/pluginProva/

in fact I answered before examining the bug... there is no backslash problem.
Instead, I have to cope with paths containing whitespaces, because R strictly
rejects them if spaces are not escaped. If the path where to save output files
doesn't contain spaces, all is going very well until now!

I read documentation of os.path, but I didn't find functions that work on
whitespaces. 
Seems that I have to examine the output path and escape whitespaces before
giving it to R. Or, write nothing and discourage the use of whitespaced paths...

 Can you give a simple example of where this happens? If I create a
path with spaces in it I can source a file from it from rpy without
any escaping:

>>> r.source("Foo Bar/test.R")
[1] "hello"

 And also for output:

>>> out="Foo Bar/out.txt"
>>> r.cat("Hello World",file=out)
>>> file(out).read()
'Hello World'

 This is on Linux, so maybe this fails on Windows, or you're doing
something else that fails.

Hi all,

this week I released the beta version of the plugin (revision 73). Please refer
to the wiki page for any information about installation and use. 
Then I enabled more features. Testing in Windows has been successful until now,
except for whitespaces paths (have to test if this problem is cross-platform).

Next week I'll activate last two widgets (use selection and show resulting
layers in project).

No blocks at the moment!

Hi

Great - it would be great if there was an updated geos at the same
time as QGIS 1.0 goes out. Though my doubt is that even in this case
it would take a while for GEOS 3.1 to get into downstream repos. In
the case of ubuntu where we have our own ppa we could in theory add
geos 3.1 in there but that makes more work for us and still leaves
other distros unresolved. So I think in the short term finding a
workaround for cutedges (perhaps only calling it #ifndef GEOS_3_1 or
somthing) would be good.

Regards

Tim

You mean to wrap the new call in GEOS sources?

No I meant to only do the cutedges check in qgis if we have the
correct c-api supported geos version available on the system. We are
awating feedback from Marco to see if this is feasible.

Tim,

I see. If you want to check it in compile time, then you can test
value of GEOS_VERSION_* macros [1]. If you want to test it in run time,
then GEOSversion [2] is handy.

Hi Marco,

If you are curious about the print composer developments, just check out the printing branch:
svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/advanced_printing_branch

I'm trying to bring the branch to a stable state until 15. August so it can be tested by interested folks. 25. August is the feature freeze for 1.0 and the latest date for merge.

To your suggestions:

>2. on mouse over the object may show a tooltip showing the name of the 
>object

That's a good idea, I added it to my todo list. Maybe tooltip could also show the most important properties of the object

>3. users should be able to resize the objects on the page directly with the 
>mouse (such as resizing windows); now resizing is possible only giving the

In printcomposer branch, it is possible to resize the maps in composer and also to move the content of composer map. For the other objects (scale bar, label, legend), resizing changes the size of the frame, but not the size of the content.

>1. when the user press an "add object" button, the object may be

I'm not sure about that. Most graphic programs (and also the main window of QGIS for some tools) work the way that a user picks a tool and nothing happens until mouse click or drag in canvas is done. E.g. in inkscape, if you add a rectangle, you pick the rectangle tool and the rectangle appears once the user drags the mouse on the canvas. I think it is quite natural to work this way.

However, in inkscape, there is a changing mouse cursor depending on the selected tool. I think that would also be helpful in the print composer.

Regards,
Marco

yes, I agree; the topic needs to be expanded...

OT: you (all) can call me as marcopx (my commit username) to not make 
confusion between me and Marco Hugentoblers ;)

> you mean a "tooltip"? - this would be a good idea!

yes, correct; what I recorded from many users (myself too) is that when you 
press a button in the Map Composer nothing actually happens; you need to put 
the mouse over the map an press the left button again to see the object 
placed on the map; what I suggest is:

1. when the user press an "add object" button, the object may be 
automatically placed on the map, with a standard (small) dimension and 
position (left up corner?)
2. on mouse over the object may show a tooltip showing the name of the 
object
3. users should be able to resize the objects on the page directly with the 
mouse (such as resizing windows); now resizing is possible only giving the 
width-height parameters as numbers (that's good for a fine sizing, but not 
for a quick one)
4. (minor) the layout page should be zoomable also using the mouse wheel

That's mainly what I suggest

I'll give you more notes if I'll write down some new :)

Regards,

Marco

Hi all,

Here a bit of explanation about why the call to Polygonizer::getCutEdges is used for polygon splitting. Let's say we have a polygon with a hole inside (donut polygon) and we try to split it with a line that starts outside the polygon and ends inside the hole. This split produces a cut line and thus an invalid polygon according to the OGC simple features specification. In QgsGeometry:: splitPolygonGeometry, this case is queried with the getCutEdges function and the user receives feedback that the split fails. Without this query, the polygonizer will not add the splitting line, but the two vertices at the positions where the splitting line crosses the polygon borders are added.

So in short: Yes, this check is needed. QGIS won't crash if it is not there, but user might be confused when doing a split that creates a cut edge.

It might be best to query GEOSversion to see if getCutEdges is supported. The bug that arises if the call isn't done is not critical and will be outdated after some time.

@J?rgen:
I think it will be good to let the geos c-api patch be tested by other developers for let's say one week before applying it to trunk. I'm going to give you feedback once I did some tests with it.

Regards,
Marco

I think that will generate link errors.  I'd prefer to simply use the
preprocessor symbols.

Ok.  I already ran the geometry tests and intended to extend them to
identify each bug found.

Hi

For the geometry unit tests J?rgen is referring to, I added a bunch
more test cases last week (but not including a split geometry test).
If you run the geometry test like this:

ctest -R geom -V

You should now get a graphical report which illustrates most of the
tests now in the test suite.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Cleaning up stdout for 1.0.0 and qgsmaprender
	renaming.
Message-ID: <d368056f0808041311l58563a8cu556036b6e2c8b728@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks

Over the weekend I made some changes to QGIS to reduce the amount of
console spam (even in debug mode). It would be great to ship 1.0.0
with a lot of the junk removed that currently goes to stdout.  The
results of my efforts so far look like this:

http://rafb.net/p/mxvM3J57.html

There are some more in the above that I'd like to get rid of. IMHO
users running release mode QGIS should just see the plugin and
provider check list and any critical error message we would like to
convey to them via the console. For users with debug build much of the
stuff on qgsdebug is leftover from the development cycle of various
classes (e.g. in ctor now, running method foo now, in dtor now etc).
In most cases I just comment out QgsDebugMsg and similar lines. I'd
like to commit these changes but thought I'd ask if anyone deeply
cares about having a more verbose QGIS.

Secondly, I have renamed the improperly named qgsmaprender (verb) to
qgsmaprenderer (noun) in my sources and would like to commit that. It
may affect merging branches in a little, but I dont think by any means
difficult to resolve.

However in the interests of not interfering with the work of others I
thought I'd annouce my intentions here and if anyone has issue let me
know in the next 24 hours or so. 46k diff attached for the curious.

Regards

Hi All

With apologies for cross posting, please find below a call for
lightning talks, software demos and the code sprint in the upcoming
FOSS4G2008. It would be really great to see lots of you there (and
showing off / hacking on QGIS)!

Regards

Tim


Free and Open Source Geospatial Conference 2008 (FOSS4G2008)

FOSS4G2008 will be taking place this year in September / October in
South Africa. FOSS4G is a an annual gathering place for Free and Open
Source  projects with a geospatial leaning. The conference venue
is the Cape Town International Conference Center (CTICC) in the
Foreshore area of Cape Town - the beautiful 'mother city' of South
Africa.

Demo Sessions:
=======================

We will be holding a demo theatre during tea breaks and lunch times.
Demos are a great way to show off your work to decision makers, GIS
professionals and fellow code crunchers. The demos will be restricted
to 10 minutes
 each (including questions and setup time) so they need to be brief
and to the point. If you would like to demo your project, something
you have achieved with FOSS geospatial, or anything else relevant to a
geospatial
practitioner audience, you can register by following the instructions
provided on the demo wiki page here:

http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G2008_Demos


Lightning Talks:
=======================

During the plenary session on Monday 29 July, there will be eight
lightning talks of 5 minutes each. Time limits will be strictly
adhered to and we are looking for the most entertaining, thought
provoking and informative speeches possible. The speeches will be
presented to the entire conference. If you are interested in making a
lightning speech, or know of any good candidates to give such a
speech, please visit the lightning talks wiki page to register your
interest here:

http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G2008_LightningTalks


Code Sprint:
=======================

We will be holding an all day code sprint on Saturday 4 October - the
day following the end of the main conference activities. Given that
most FOSS projects are conducted as virtual collaborations over the
internet, the code sprint is a rare opportunity for you to get
together in person with other developers in your project.

The code sprint is also a great opportunity for those who are
interested in getting involved in a project to go and meet the
developers face to face and get some help in getting started with
development. If you are not a developer, but interested in other
aspects of project development, (documentation, creating demonstrator
implementations of software etc.) the code sprint is an equally good
opportunity to collaborate.

We will provide a venue, lunch and refreshments, internet connection
and flip charts. If you have other special requirements let us know
and we will see what we can do.

In order to provide the very best experience for you it would be
helpful to get an idea of how many people are likely to attend. We
have created a Wiki page at:

http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G2008_CodeSprint

On this page you can create a section for your project and list the
people planning to attend. The page also provides a space to help you
organise your code sprint day by writing up the goals and preparation
work needed for your sprint.


Contact Info:
=======================

The code sprint, lightning talks & demo session organiser is Tim
Sutton (tim@linfiniti.com) - if you have any questions or special
requirements, please don't hesitate to ask. If you haven't already
registered for the conference, we advise doing so as soon as possible
to secure your place. Visit the conference registration page at:

That's also subject of my cleanup patch.

It turns all iostream output to QgsDebugMsg and thereby makes it debug
only and more controlable.

I'm just waiting for the advanced printing branch to be commited...

Turning QgsDebugMsg to QgsDebugMsgLevel with a higher level (say 3)
might also be an alternative to reduce noise without actually removing
possibly useful debug output - IMHO better than commenting it out.

Ah sorry I missed that - had you posted it somewhere?

In some cases I have some problems with qgsdebugmsg - the file / func
/ line number is half the reason stdout is so verbose. I tried to get
some key parts e.g. plugin loading to summarise in one line e.g.:

Checking  /home/timlinux/apps/lib/qgis/libogrprovider.so : ... loaded
ok (and with 5 file filters)
Checking  /home/timlinux/apps/lib/qgis/libpggeoprocessingplugin.so :
..invalid (no type)

In other cases the debug messages are showing things that may be
potentially useful when actually debugging but once code is tested and
operational I feel that commenting out or removing is better (do we
really need to know every time a signal / slot connection is made to
the maplayer registry for example). However I guess if we can hideaway
at a higher log level that would be good too.

In general though my feeling is that many of the debug statements
currently in our code are actually better removed and debugging done
with a debugger (I'm as guilty of this as anyone else).

Anyway perhaps we can combine our two cleanups if its not too
difficult to cross merge them...

Tim

Sure in [1], meanwhile moved it to [2].  The patch itself is outdated,
but the scripts that produce it should still work.

Sure, debug output that is pure noise, should be removed.  Some should
be throttled using a higher debug level (and not commented out) and
really useful ones should stay, but turned to QgsDebugMsg.

Using QgsDebugMsg just enables debug output in debug builds
(-DQGISDEBUG) - release build wouldn't have no such noise.

I think - except for debugging purposes - there should be no direct
output to cout/cerr at all in a gui application.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Python plugin] handle error conditions
Message-ID: <1217933653.7205.31.camel@galadriel>

Hello all, and especially Python plugin developers,

The plugin for home range analysis is now almost ready, but success of
execution depends on correct parameters given by the user, otherwise it
raises Python errors or gives the false idea that everything is going
fine.
I'm trying to handle some potential errors as soon as possible. 
The worst error source is that there is no (point) layer available. For
the moment I let QGIS print a warning into console and raise a
QMessageBox.
Is it possible from the __init__ method of the interface to abort window
drawing? If I call the interface close() method, the interface gets
drawn anyway.
It will be fine if the user calls the method from menu, gets a message
box about lack of layers, and nothing else after. 

Significant part of the code is here:
http://rafb.net/p/0G3Wiw24.html

lines 23 (call), 55.

thanks in advance for any hint!

Anne Ghisla

Hi

Ok what I'll do is roll back my commenting out changes and wait for
you to do your script based patch to get rid of stdout etc. I will
commit my qgsmaprenderer name change and also some changes that remove
some of the more mundane debug messages.

Regards

the plugin looks for R files in its directory, and for the moment the path
points to the user plugin directory. If the plugin is installed in official
plugin folder, it runs but can't call R.
I don't know which OS you are using, nor if the dependencies are the ones I
wrote on the wiki page [1] and I'm sure they work.
Consider also to get the head revision (I entered testing phase and I update
code often with bugfixes).
If you are using Mac, a full error report will be extremely useful!

Anne

Tom and others,

This appears to have been a Qt issue (as I suspected). I installed Qt  
4.4.1 last night, and labels appear to be back in order. Thanks for  
your help and suggestions.

John

Sorry I should have mentioned that I am testing on Ubuntu i386 8.04.

One suggestion that I would give for your wiki page is to simply list
the packages  ubuntu users need to install e.g.

{{{
sudo apt-get install python-rpy etc.
}}}

I'm poking around anyway trying to get all the correct dependencies
installed but an explicit package requirements list would be great.



Regards

Tim

Solved in revision 106.
Thanks to Barry's hint, the plugin uses "inspect" module to find out the
folder where it is running, and therefore the R scripts.

stay tuned - feature freeze will be set in a few days. 
This month is dedicated to test and bugfix, so feel free to send me
hints and bug reports.
If you're able to run the plugin on your machine, I'll be glad to
receive the installation details, especially if they are different from
the ones proposed on the wiki page.

cheers,

Anne

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Better Menus for QGIS 1.0
In-Reply-To: <48687898.7000407@comcast.net>
References: <48687898.7000407@comcast.net>
Message-ID: <48996637.2000706@comcast.net>

Hello all,

As mentioned last month, here is a proposal for reorganized QGIS menus. Comments appear below after each menu.

For those who would like to try the menus, a patch is available at:
http://telwertowski.home.comcast.net/menu_reorg_r9000.diff

This patch is not the final version; it is only for review of menu placement. All items may not be enabled/disabled as appropriate. Code will be rewritten before submission to svn.

"[Mac]" indicates a Mac-only menu or item; "[X11]" indicates a non-Mac menu or item. All items appear once somewhere. My goal is to place each item where a user of that platform would expect to find it. Since I don't use Windows, someone should let me known if any items need to be relocated for Windows.

The menus:

[Mac] Application menu
[Mac] "About..."
[Mac] "Preferences..."
[Mac] "Custom CRS..."
[Mac] "Quit"

The Application menu is the leftmost menu for all Mac apps. It contains "About", "Preferences" (Options) and "Quit" (Exit) as well as access to other global settings. Access to file-based settings appears on the File menu.

Due to a Qt bug, CRS currently appears first in the menu demo.

File menu
"&New Project"
"&Open Project..."
"Open Recent Projects >"
"-"
"&Save Project"
"Save Project &As..."
"Save as Image..."
[Mac] "-"
[Mac] "Project Properties..."
"-"
[Mac] "Page Setup..."
"&Print Composer..."
[X11] "-"
[X11] "Exit"

Edit menu
"Cut Features"
"Copy Features"
"Paste Features"
"-"
"Capture Point"
"Capture Line"
"Capture Polygon"
"Delete Selected"
"Move Feature"
"Split Features"
"Add Vertex"
"Delete Vertex"
"Move Vertex"
"Add Ring"
"Add Island"

Ideally the Edit menu should begin with "Undo" and "Cut," "Copy" and "Paste" should work for whatever is selected, not just features. Getting this to work probably isn't feasible for QGIS 1.0 however. Qt provides a popup menu with these items on text fields which works now. To get the same info into the menubar Edit menu requires a handler in each dialog to update the menu actions according to which widget which currently has focus.

View menu
"Pan Map"
"Zoom In"
"Zoom Out"
"Select Features"
"Identify Feature"
"Measure Line"
"Measure Area"
-
"Zoom Full"
"Zoom To Selection"
"Zoom To Layer"
"Zoom Last"
-
"Map Tips"
"New Bookmark..."
"Show Bookmarks"
"Refresh"
[X11] "-"
[X11] "Toolbars >"
[X11] "Toggle Full Screen Mode"

The View menu should be limited to commands which modify the appearance of the currently active window (view). The first group is modal; they are together because selecting any one deactivates the others in the group. The second group are non-modal commands related to the first group. The third group contain other unrelated view actions.

The fourth group controls toolbar, panel and menu visibility. On a Mac, these go on the Window menu because they control things outside the view. Since other platforms don't typically have a Window menu and this is where they are today, I left them here. For an example of an app which uses the same menus (including the Window menu) on all platforms, see Qt Designer. My feeling is that the Window menu (which on a Mac is outside the window and at the top of the screen) serves a similar purpose to the taskbar on non-Mac platforms; adding a menu inside a window (on non-Mac platforms) which controls other windows seems odd to me.

The "Toolbars >" submenu is static at present. It will be fixed to update itself whenever plugins are loaded/unloaded.

Layer menu
"New Vector Layer..."
"Add Vector Layer..."
"Add Raster Layer..."
"Add PostGIS Layer..."
"Add WMS Layer..."
-
"Open Attribute Table"
"Toggle Editing"
"Save as Shapefile..."
"Save Selection as Shapefile..."
"Remove Layer"
"Properties...
-
"Show In Overview"
"Add All To Overview"
"Remove All From Overview"
-
"Show All Layers"
"Hide All Layers"

"Add" and "Save" are the interesting items here; they are file commands so they could be on the File menu. But there is also "New" and "Remove" which are not file commands. I put them all here because I like the symmetry of File (project): New, Open, Save and Layer: New, Add, Save and Remove.

I did not add the layer grouping commands. I haven't used them and am not sure I understand them. Perhaps I need to read the manual. :) They look like they might be specific to the Layers panel so perhaps leaving them only on the popup menu is sufficient. OTOH, exposing the functionality on the main menu might encourage more users to learn about these commands.

[X11] Settings menu
[X11] "Project Properties..."
[X11] "Custom CRS..."
[X11] "Options..."

The Settings menu is non-Mac because the Mac places these items on either the Application or File menu.

Plugin menu
"Plugin manager
"-"
(active plugin list)
"-"
"Python console"

Should the Python console be on top or bottom?

[Mac] Window menu
[Mac] "Minimize"
[Mac] "Zoom" (toggle maximized or not)
[Mac] "-"
[Mac] "Bring All to Front"
[Mac] "-"
[Mac] "Toolbars >"
[Mac] "Toggle Full Screen Mode"
[Mac] "-"
[Mac] (open window list)

This is a standard Mac menu. At present, only the Attribute Table is added to the Window menu. When selected, the window is also unminimized or raised to top. As other windows are added, they will also be fixed to unminimize or raise to top when reselected whether by the Window menu or any other action.

Is "Toggle Full Screen" necessary on a Mac? Mac guidelines are that it should be used only for games and video players which typically have a single window which covers the full screen.

Help menu
"Help Contents"
"-"
"Qgis Home Page"
"Check Qgis Version"
[X11] "-"
[X11] "About"

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Create new point with Zoom to Point plugin?
Message-ID: <1218015322.8094.3.camel@vertical>

How about adding having the option to add a new point (in an existing
point vector layer or create a new point vector layer) with the Zoom to
Point plugin?

If I am not wrong, the only way to add a point for given coordinates is
throught the "Add Delimited Text Layer".

Kind regards, Nikos

Hi Tom

I read through your proposal below and I really like it!

+1 from me

I have a few comments which I will top post here since they are more
generic to the email.

- The layer grouping use case is for people who have projects with
e.g. hundreds of small raster images. Putting these into a group
allows them to be reflected on the legend as a single entry.  There
are also several other benefits such as enabling you to hide / show
multiple layers in a single action.

- The plugin menu is something that always didnt feel right for me.
The original idea when we implemented plugins 'way back when' was that
plugins should integrate themselves into the existing menu structure.
There were issues with doing it at the time and it got parked in the
back lot and never revisited. However since you are doing all this
great work, what do you think about revisiting this idea. We could
extend the plugin interface so that the user can ask for any specific
menu getFileMenu() getToolsMenu() etc. The result would be far more
clean integration of plugins. So for example the geoprocessing would
be placed into Tools etc. Accompanying that we could use your document
below as the basis of a guideline for plugin developers to know where
there menu items should go.

Best regards

Tim

Hi all, and apologies for cross-posting, 

today, at revision 111, the project enters feature freeze. All widgets
are enabled and I began to test the plugin on my Ubuntu machine and
other platforms, including Debian, Windows XP and Windows 2000.
Next month is dedicated to bugfixing, writing documentation and extended
testing. 

To obtain and use the plugin, follow instructions on 
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/GSoC2008Rbinding

Message-ID: <BF55718B-B479-4800-80A7-A957E6DE9883@kyngchaos.com>

Talk about cleaning up the menus for 1.0 got me to thinking about the  
application name.  At least for OSX and Windows, if not Linux, 'qgis'  
seems strange.  All lowercase, that is.

Everything on the website and in the docs says either 'QGIS', or it's  
full name 'Quantum GIS'.  So, for the 1.0 release, I suggest  
'QGIS' (all caps).

What about the version in the name?  Currently it's using a *nix  
style, full version, no spaces between the name and the version.  Also  
strange-looking on OSX and Windows.  At least put a space (OK on OSX)  
or hyphen between name and version (and leave out the .revision).   
Leaving off the version would be best - if someone wants multiple  
versions side-by-side they can safely rename the application on OSX (I  
don't know how easy that is on Windows or Linux).

Hi Folks

Since 1.0 will be the start of API stable 1.x.x releases I am fixing
various inconsistencies in the API now while we have the chance. This
in some cases may require adapting existing code (I've been keeping
trunk current to my changes). I created a summary (which I will add to
as needed) of the key areas of change in case you are doing any head
scratching. I put it in the visual changelog for 1.0 (ok I know its
not very visual...) :

Shouldn't "XML" in functions such as "writeXML" be named "writeXml" for 
consistency with Qt 4 naming?

Hi J?rgen,

I did some tests with the geos c-api patch and have the following comments:

- GEOSGeometry seems to be GEOSGeom in geos 2. Maybe version 2 could be supported by a typedef or define ?
- The tool to add rings to a polygon did not work when I tested it
- The same with the tool to add islands to selected polygons

I used geos 3.0.0 for the tests.

Thanks anyway for doing the port to c-api. I know it is a difficult task because many parts in qgis depend on geos functionality.

Regards,
Marco

I posted the proposal[1] including a patch[2]. The QGIS patch is on [3].

QGIS patch summary:
- cmake now looks for the geos_c instead of the geos library
- QgsGeometry ported to GEOS C-API (needs geos patch [1])
- QgsSpatialIndex now catches (and ignores) exceptions
- removed (previously unused?) references to the GEOS geometry factory from
  QgsOgrProvider
- QgsWfsProvider now uses QgsSpatialIndex instead of GEOS spatial index.

Should this go to a separate branch or do I simply commit it to trunk?  I'd say
it's more likely that it gets the testing it needs in trunk...

Message-ID: <489B0B3A.70302@itc.cnr.it>

Hello everyone,
I have recently developed 3 QGIS plugins: 

- Dxf2Shp Converter: Written in C++, it converts a Dxf file into a Shapefile layer, with labels extraction 

- QGIS2pMapper: Based on David Sherman's Mapserver Export written in Python, it converts a QGIS project into a pMapper one, including various functionalities 

- TableJoiner: Written in Python, it is an utility to join two Dbf tables over a selectable database field 


We are currently using them.

I feel thay are of general interest and I wonder if they could be included in QGIS ver. 1.0

Cheers, 

Paolo

Hi Paolo

We could certainly consider including the c++ one into the main
sources - assuming you are happy for it to be published under GPL etc.
What dependencies does it have on other libs?

For your python ones I think the best way to distribute them to a wide
audience at the moment is via the QGIS plugin repository.

Could you forward me the C++ code to evaluate (and some sample data if poss).

Many thanks!

Regards

Tim

Ok I changed some of them today and will try to tackle the rest too.
Any other comments about API inconsistencies would be most welcome!

Hi Paolo,

In my opinion, the dxf2shp plugin is definitely of general interest and I'd 
like to include it into 1.0. Tim, it would be great if you could review it as 
well.

With pMapper, I have not enough experience. Is there any volunteer pMapper 
user that likes to do some tests with the plugin?

Finally, I also like to submit the interpolation plugin for version 1.0 (see 
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2008-July/004247.html). Are 
there any objections about this?


Regards,
Marco

Hi J?rgen,

Thank you for the fixes. I made some more tests with the updated patch and found following things:

- 'Add ring' and 'Add island' tools basically work now. However, there is still an issue with 'Add ring' that occurs when adding several rings into a multipolygon part. In this case, the first ring disappears after adding a second one into the same polygon part. 

- I tried to compile also with geos2. However, I reveive the following compiler error:

/home/marco/src/qgis_geos_c_api/src/core/qgsdistancearea.cpp
In file included from /home/marco/src/qgis_geos_c_api/src/core/qgsdistancearea.cpp:28:

- And I also did some tests with the valgrind memory debugger that revealed two possible memory leaks related to the c_api port:

Hi William (and for general attention)

I have changed the application name in main.cpp here from qgis to
QGIS. One thing to bear in mind though is that this change puts QGIS
into 'eternal sunshine of the spotless mind mode' - it forgets all
settings in QSettings because the application key is different. I'll
commit this because if there was every a good time to be breaking a
few eggs, this is it (before we release 1.0).

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <1218201393.489c4731ef529@mail.studenti.uninsubria.it>

Hello all,

this week I released the plugin with full functionality (revision 111).
It is available for testing. 
Under Debian-alikes it works well, in Windows there are some problems due to
availability of RPy for R 2.7.1, since adehabitat R package doesn't run under R
2.7.0. It is therefore suggested to use R 2.6.2 and corresponding RPy until a
stable RPy2 comes out.

Next week I plan to do further testing, write down documentation and think about
a tutorial. A sample dataset will also be shipped together with the code of the
plugin.

No blocks at the moment!
Happy coding to all of us,

Anne Ghisla

Hi Anne

I updated again your plugin now from svn and it starts without error
now. When I try to run it complains its missing rgdal and adehabitat.
I see on your wiki page[1] you say:

"R packages adehabitat and rgdal and all their dependencies"

But don't offer any instructions on how to do this. Could you update
it so R clueless folks like me can play too? :-)

Many thanks

Tim

Got it working. See http://www.keittlab.org/node/144

In R (as root if you prefer), type: "install.packages(<pkg-name>, dep
= T)" (dropping quotes) to install each package.

In Ubu, you need to "apt-get install libgdal1-dev" to build rgdal.
There are a bunch of qgis python dependencies I had to install as
well. Ubuntu has a mechanism for suggesting packages to install, but
AFAICT it works only with binaries. It would be nice if it could also
resolve python library dependencies and suggest the packages. I
figured out which python packages I needed by looking at the qgis
error messages.

Looks great Anne!

This usually happens when the Ubuntu version of R falls behind the
R-project version of R. There is no organized effort to back port CRAN
packages. Best thing to do is use the CRAN apt repository for R so you
keep in sync with CRAN packages.

My sources.list includes:

deb http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/bin/linux/ubuntu hardy/

Substitute a mirror listed at r-project.org. Then apt upgrade or
apt-get install r-base.

Hmm I think this has take things from bad to worse. I setup the third
party repo as you suggested and installed r-base. Then I installed
adehabitat and I used a US mirror this time instead of a local South
African one. After downloading a heap of stuff (ouch!) it gave this:

** preparing package for lazy loading
Loading required package: tripack
Warning in library(pkg, character.only = TRUE, logical.return = TRUE,
lib.loc = lib.loc) :
  there is no package called 'tripack'
Error: package 'tripack' could not be loaded
Execution halted
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'spdep'
** Removing '/home/timlinux/R/i486-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.7/spdep'

The downloaded packages are in
        /tmp/RtmptmjHUE/downloaded_packages
There were 17 warnings (use warnings() to see them)


Also, now when I start QGIS I get a long warning for the home range plugin:

Couldn't load plugin "pluginProva" from

Generally this only happens when a repository gets out of sync with
the main CRAN repos, and its usually temporary while new versions get
pushed. I have occasionally found flaky CRAN repositories, so hunt
around. Try going directly to CRAN in Austria. Tripack should be there
(its been in R for ages). Also some R packages can be installed via
apt, so be sure to do an apt-get upgrade to sync with the R
repository.

Actually, the other reason this could occur is if the package author
forget to include tripack in the dependencies. See if you can install
it manually ie install.packages('tripack', dep = T).

As a last resort, packages can be downloaded from CRAN (tar.gz format)
and installed with sudo R CMD INSTALL <pkg> or R CMD INSTALL -l
<r-lib-dir> <pkg> if you have a different site-lib dir.

I used this version of rpy:

ii  python-rpy                                 1.0.3-2hardy0
                                   Python interface to the GNU R
language and e

and it appears to work fine.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Fwd: WKT Plugin
Message-ID: <200808092146.50619.mauricio.dev@gmail.com>

Hi list,
Last week I read something about people who wanted to insert geometries by 
giving it's coordinates. I wrote a wkt new geometry plugin. It's still very 
weak as it doesn't check for valid geometry type nor valid wkt expression but 
it worked in my tests. 
I'm uploading it in the repository and would be really glad if anyone is 
willing to bugtest it.
Regards,
Maur?cio de Paulo

That's r.colors, FTR.

Do you maybe mean that QGIS renders GRASS rasters without a colortable
all-black? GRASS assumes the "rainbow" colortable for rasters without a
colortale. QGIS doesn't.

Question to devs:

Should/could QGIS default to some colortable if the raster doesn't have
one? Currently it renders color-less GRASS rasters all-black, and e.g.
ArcInfo ASCII grids all-grey...

Hello Maciek,
it seems that the problem is in the Dxflib library: in dl_writer_ascii.cpp
the function strlen cannot be found, even if it is located in string.h,
included in dl_writer_ascii.h. you can try to include it directly in
dl_writer_ascii.cpp.

For what concerns strcasecmp in dl_writer, I think the problem could be
the three lines in dl_writer.h:

#if defined(__OS2__)||defined(__EMX__)||defined(_WIN32)
#define strcasecmp(s,t) stricmp(s,t)
#endif

because doing so, it doesn't take into account *NIX systems...

I'm currently on vacation, so I could't test the compilation process under
Debian myself... sorry!

Message-ID: <681d07c20808101908i78541b14j70bb396e4af1a156@mail.gmail.com>

I took a peek at trac, and didn't see this particular bug.

Using a scalebar with units like degrees in a sub-degree scale map
proved impossible - the scale bar gets labelled 0--0--0 degrees.  I
used On-The-Fly projection to go from a GCS to PCS and tried the
scalebar again, and yes it works with, say, 1--2--3 km.

Except for, say, segment size = 2500 (meters), number of segments = 2,
mapunits per scalebar unit = 1000 (meters / km), unit label = km.
Then we get the ever-amusing 0--2--5 km.  So, it seems like qgis
should either reject non-integer ( segment size / mapunits per
scalebar ) or display some float-precision (user defined?) labels
rather than asserting that 2+2=5 :)

Hi Christian,

Scalebar labeling with floats is possible in the printing branch, which will 
be merged in prior to version 1.0.

Hi,

In current trunk (r9046) the plugin installer plugin is not present in
the plugins manager menu. What's wrong?

I have Python bindings enabled.

BTW - looking into cmake log I found a warning, repeated few times:

I have finally had time to look into this some more and apparently qgis was 
building against atlas instead of lapack, and atlas not providing all the 
necessary function calls.

I'm building updated packages for my website that includes the architectures 
that previously did not build and will soon be pushing this to Fedora.

I would like to ask if there is any hint at fixing the "file browser"

It is painfully slow waiting for the OSX pinwheel to stop spinning

Hi Mars,

This is a problem of the NASA WMS server and not the QGIS client:

"The WMS vendor also reported:

I think that we should delete the phrase

Subject: [Qgis-developer] vector layer updates heads-up
Message-ID: <20080812131837.GA16149@norbit.de>

Hi there,

I'm currently working on the vector layer.  Originally I only wanted to
add additional widgets to edit attributes.  Additionally to the
traditional line edit I want to have a combobox using the existing
attribute values (using the providers getUniqueValues()), a combobox
that selects from a value map and maybe more (eg. angles with a spin
box, dates, etc).

Doing that I stubbled into some vector layer deficiencies resulting in
following changes:

commitAttributeChanges() is removed and replaced with addAttribute(),
deleteAttribute() and changeAttributeValue().  Thereby the vector layer
can keep handle all updates transparently until they are commited or
rolled back.

featuresInRectangle() can be thereby be used for both rendering and
labeling (currently labeling is done directly on the data provider with
the old attributes) without carring about the updates.

The vector layer now also emits signals when editing starts or ends,
when attributes are added or deleted or attribute values change (to be
used by the attribute table, legend, QgisApp etc.).

It's now also easily possible to add editing attributes elsewhere (like
the identify dialog).

I also moved some code:
- toggleEditing() logic from the legend to QgisApp
- attribute table logic from the legend to the attribute table itself
- remove toggleEditing() logic from the attribute table and use QgisApp
  instead
- tracking and commiting attribute value changes from attribute table to
  vector layer.
- Adding and removing attributes from the attribute table to a new tab
  in the vector layer properties.

Attribute table and legend now connect to the vector layer signals to do
the (visual) updates.

QgisApp also has a static method instance() now, that allows everyone to
connect to QgisApp signals or slots (like the attribute table).

I also changed the vector data providers supportedNativeTypes() to
report individual QVariant::Types (useful when adding attributes).

As I've noticed #1215, I'm uploading my current work to [1] to gain some
feed back, although it's not finished yet...

I updated the patch[1] to do that.

When using the identify tool in edit mode the attribute dialog is
spawned when only on feature is selected.  When more features are
selected the identify dialog starts and has a "edit action" which in
turn starts the attribute dialog.

The attribute widget settings are also now stored to the project file.

Hi Jurgen

Wow these sound like really great improvements. I am only able to make
a brief reply now and will try to chat further on irc tomorrow:

- would it be easy / feasible to add a selectionSize method that
returns how many selected features there are? This will enable among
other things showing progress when iterating features.

- do your changes allow concurrent editing of attribute and digitising
of features - I have some uncommited stuff to provide table in dock
but ran into issues in this kind of mutimode editing.

I'll ask other stuff on IRC

regards

Tim

Exactly.

If you delete features in the map canvas they are instantly removed from
the attribute table (if open).  Attribute updates through the attribute
dialog also update the attribute table.  Adding/removing attributes in
the vector layer properties also add/removed the columns in the
attribute table.  The labels also show the edited state.

But some display updates are not yet rolled back properly in the
attribute table yet, although they are internally handled properly (ie.
removed rows don't reappear and changed attributes values are not
restored; added/removed attribut columns are restored).

And the patch doesn't try to address the attribute table issues with
huge number of features - and probably makes those worse.

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] vector layer updates heads-up
 
Hi there,

I'm currently working on the vector layer.  Originally I only wanted to
add additional widgets to edit attributes.  Additionally to the
traditional line edit I want to have a combobox using the existing
attribute values (using the providers getUniqueValues()), a combobox
that selects from a value map and maybe more (eg. angles with a spin
box, dates, etc).

Doing that I stubbled into some vector layer deficiencies resulting in
following changes:

commitAttributeChanges() is removed and replaced with addAttribute(),
deleteAttribute() and changeAttributeValue().  Thereby the vector layer
can keep handle all updates transparently until they are commited or
rolled back.

featuresInRectangle() can be thereby be used for both rendering and
labeling (currently labeling is done directly on the data provider with
the old attributes) without carring about the updates.

The vector layer now also emits signals when editing starts or ends,
when attributes are added or deleted or attribute values change (to be
used by the attribute table, legend, QgisApp etc.).

It's now also easily possible to add editing attributes elsewhere (like
the identify dialog).

I also moved some code:
- toggleEditing() logic from the legend to QgisApp
- attribute table logic from the legend to the attribute table itself
- remove toggleEditing() logic from the attribute table and use QgisApp
  instead
- tracking and commiting attribute value changes from attribute table to
  vector layer.
- Adding and removing attributes from the attribute table to a new tab
  in the vector layer properties.

Attribute table and legend now connect to the vector layer signals to do
the (visual) updates.

QgisApp also has a static method instance() now, that allows everyone to
connect to QgisApp signals or slots (like the attribute table).

I also changed the vector data providers supportedNativeTypes() to
report individual QVariant::Types (useful when adding attributes).

As I've noticed #1215, I'm uploading my current work to [1] to gain some
feed back, although it's not finished yet...

Hi Douglas

Sounds great. Can you give me the appropriate details to add to
download.qgis.org? Or is it just

http://www.silfreed.net/download/repo/packages/qgis/

And which versions of Fedora should I list?

Many thanks

It now only loads the selected features or all if there aren't any.
Any better ideas?

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0808130435r53e0bcaeif94018370997c968@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

while still on holidays, i've read briefly some topics recently
discussed on qgis-dev.

i'd like to say that in my opinion it would cause pain to switch to
geos c api now before 1.0 release. there are more reasons:
- we shouldn't force users to use some very new version of geos
- may bring new bugs
- this is my biggest concern - we'd like to do many changes in
geometry handling after 1.0 release and geos c api doesn't have
support of many features that we will need so that might result in
going back to geos c++ api. take a look at the rfc:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/GeometryHandlingRfc

i prefer to stay with geos c++ api for 1.0, then post-1.0 implement
the changes with c++ api and then optionally switch to geos c api in
cooperation with geos folks.

if replying please make sure to cc me, i'm not watching qgis-dev list
these days.
also the reply time from me can vary - up to several days

regards
martin

Hi,

On any layer's load, and even on QGIS startup, a message:

"Warning: No valid projection. Unable to set map units."

is printed to the terminal. Despite of that, I don't notice any CRS
support issues. What does this warning indicate then?

After a rebuild from SVN today, I have the Plugin Installer present. I 
have no idea why it was not there the last time - I'm using exactly the 
same build procedure each time I compile QGIS, always including 'make 
distclean'.

It is still the old 0.2 version though. When is the 0.05.4 from
http://bwj.aster.net.pl/qgis/plugins.xml going to be included?

This is the URL to the package description:
https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/packages/name/qgis

The install instructions are just:
yum install qgis

These optional packages are also available:
qgis-grass, qgis-python, qgis-theme-nkids

Fedora 8 and 9 are supported.

This is a problem with the Mac implementation of QFileDialog. A three line Qt program which does nothing but prompt for a file using the non-native dialog also spins the pinwheel for the same amount of time.

The performance penalty is a cost of using a write once, run everywhere development strategy. Qt supports adding extra controls to file dialogs by using its own non-native dialog implementation. To improve performance, a Mac-specific file dialog implementation is needed in place of QFileDialog which could add extra controls (the Encoding popup) directly to a native Mac dialog.

I don't expect the file dialog to be rewritten soon. Although slow, it works and I would rather see additional QGIS features added or bugs fixed.

I agree with fixing bugs.

When navigating a root directory on my 24" iMac 3ghz, 4Gb Ram, it  
stalls out QGIS for close to 2 min. (1.45min exact)
I do not dare navigate to my GIS drive which I have never been able to  
see the end to the pinwheel, thus Force Quiting QGIS and firing up UDIG.
I much prefer using QGIS due to its superior editing functions and UI  
and of course the nice GRASS plugin implimentation

I would prefer a useable file browser over more features however, and  
feel this is more of a "Bug" than a feature.

Just a silly User Point of View...

I have delays of 3 to 6 seconds using non-native dialogs. A native dialog is able to access the same folders instantly.

Qt is caching file dialog data in ~/Library/Preferences/com.trolltech.plist. Try deleting this file; perhaps it contains corrupted data.

Also try the following program. I have identical browsing times with this code and QGIS. If this example is also slow, you should submit a bug to Trolltech.

#include <QApplication>
#include <QFileDialog>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  QApplication app(argc, argv);
  QFileDialog dialog;
  return dialog.exec();
}

I'll try your  tricks,  and if they do not work, submit a bug.

Is that really a big issue?  We need tons of dependencies.  I don't
think using a current GEOS version is going to be a significant extra
effort for now, if someone is willing to go though the hassle of
building QGIS at all.

And in the long run using the C-API will enable us to use more
prepackaged binaries.

That's true for almost every change.

Apparently the C++ API is not the recommended interface (see
http://download.osgeo.org/geos/doxygen/).  Note: on Windows there ure
only DLLs for the C-API.  Unless you use the static library there is no
available C++-API at all.

So I think we should target the C-API and extend it if necessary in
cooperation with the geos folks.

I'm in favor of allowing plugin menus and items to be placed anywhere.

The WFS plugin has one command which probably belongs on the Layer menu after the WMS item. Since menu insertion uses a 'before' argument, the code would look like:

qgisApp->layerMenu()->insert(
  qgisApp->actionLayerSeparator1(), actionAddWfsLayer);

GRASS provides a large set of commands and perhaps should have its own top-level menu. It would look like:

qgisApp->menuBar()->insertMenu( qgisApp->lastMenu()->menuAction(), menuGrass);

If a plugin has one command, the item should be directly in some menu or the Plugin menu by default. If it has a few commands, they should be in a Plugin menu submenu if not inserted elsewhere individually. If it has many commands, they should probably be a top-level menu.

One issue created by menu insertion, however, is that it depends upon the order in which plugins are loaded. For example, if two plugins are loaded which insert an "Add xyz Layer" item in the same place and then the first plugin is unloaded and later reloaded, the order of the two menu items will be reversed.

Perhaps this will be rare or perhaps not. In the future, the demand may arise for the ability to order the loading of plugins or even for users to customization where plugin items go. These issues can be addressed after QGIS 1.0.

Hello all,

Since there has been some positive and no negative reactions to the proposed menu reorganization, I am going to commit it in a few days.

Additional reading (references below) has uncovered the fact that there are some differences between GNOME and KDE regarding preferences and toolbar visibility menu items. QGIS currently follows KDE guidelines for preferences and GNOME guidelines for toolbar visibility.

The guideline differences are as follows:

KDE places toolbar visibility and preferences items on the Settings menu.

GNOME does not use a Settings menu and places file-based properties on the File menu (same as Mac), application-wide options at the bottom of the Edit menu (Mac uses the Application menu) and toolbar visibility items on the View menu (Mac uses the Window menu).

Windows guidelines also puts toolbar visibility items on the View menu. Application-wide options are at the bottom of the Tools menu (which we don't have) and no guidelines are provided for file-based properties.

Do we want to a) continue as is, b) completely follow one of GNOME or KDE, or c) use GNOME menus for GNOME and KDE menus for KDE?

Windows will have the same menu layout as X11. If we customize for GNOME and KDE, option a seems to most closely match Windows.

We are already using the QDialogButtonBox class which provides different button layouts for GNOME and KDE. However, I don't want to overly complicate things. I'm more of an X11 observer than an X11 users so I will let others decide whether we should have a single X11 menu layout or separate GNOME and KDE menu layouts.

If we go with full menu customization, the differences are:

Options (Preferences), Custom Crs
Gnome - bottom of Edit menu
Mac - Application menu (a Mac-only menu)
Kde, Win - Settings menu (Win should use Tools menu but we don't have one)

Project Properties
Gnome, Mac - File menu above print commands
Kde, Win - Settings menu

Toolbar visibility, Toggle full screen
Gnome, Win - View menu
Mac - Windows menu (a Mac-only menu)
Kde - Settings menu

Hello all,

this week I improved documentation, including README, INSTALL, LICENSE files and
a doc folder containing a short tutorial. 
Testing has been successful under Linux. Under Windows the newest R and RPy have
still some problems, therefore I suggest using R 2.6.2 until a stable RPy for R
2.7.1 comes out. See the project's wiki page [1] for details.

Next week I'll mainly expand and polish the tutorial. If required, I'll also
work further on code.

Happy coding!

Anne

Folks,

I encountered an article about QGIS yesterday on linux.com [1]. Although
the author has some points, he is quite wrong in some of his comments. E.g.:

- "newly imported shapefiles need to be exported by QGIS to shapefiles
again and then added to the map again in order for them to be editable"

- "MrSID raster files cannot be imported"

Could a QGIS dev contact him and ask to straighten some claims to make
the article closer to reality?

BTW I learned there are Slackware QGIS packages available at [2]. Maybe
worth mentioning on the download page?

Message-ID: <d8ad40b50808151010o132fdd7bp4b8565c9931df0cf@mail.gmail.com>

I can't get the python plugin installer to punch through our web proxy server.

There's code in Qgis to set a proxy host/port in the Options menu, but
this calls QNetworkProxy.setApplicationProxy(...) which seems to
concern itself with application-level proxying which I think is what
SOCKS is all about. This doesn't do HTTP proxying.

Here's my test python code (actually someone else's test code I modded):

import sys
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtNetwork import QHttp, QNetworkProxy

def process(error):
  if not error:
    content = unicode(QString(page.readAll()))
    print content
  else:
    print "errors occured"
    print str(page.errorString())
  quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":

    proxy = QNetworkProxy()
    proxy.setType(QNetworkProxy.HttpProxy)
    proxy.setHostName("wwwcache.lancs.ac.uk")
    proxy.setPort(8080)

    QNetworkProxy.setApplicationProxy(proxy)

    app = QCoreApplication (sys.argv)
    page = QHttp(None)
    #page.setProxy(proxy)
    QObject.connect(page, SIGNAL("done(bool)"), process);
    page.setHost('trolltech.com')
    gprocId = page.get('/')
    sys.exit (app.exec_ ())

 - as written I get HTTP 403 Forbidden errors (as I do in Qgis). Using
Wireshark I see that the code is trying to connect to the host through
our proxy using HTTP's CONNECT method, which is probably how you set
up an application proxy tunnel. Our web proxy rejects it with a 403
and a short message.

 If you uncomment the page.setProxy(proxy) line and comment out the
QNetworkProxy.setApplicationProxy(proxy) line then it all works for
me. I see a GET to the proxy with the correct URL for the remote host.
This seems to be the only way to do http proxying in Qt. Looks like
you have to set it for each QHttp transfer, which is not nice.

 Digging around on the web finds some other examples of proxies being
set this way, but it's not something you can test unless you are
sitting behind a one. I have also considered it may be a problem in
PyQt4 - if anyone wants to translate my example to C++ so I can try it
here I'd like to see it.

 Or possibly I'm just having a bad Friday..

This option seems to offer the most user-friendly experience on a per- 
OS basis. Users will have to do less searching if they are familiar  
with the OS GUI.

No setApplicationProxy as I have written it in qgisapp is for http
proxying not socks and as far as I know its working for proxy users
using e.g. wms plugin, wfs plugin etc.

http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/html/qnetworkproxy.html
has some examples and further explanation.

Shouldnt you create your app first, and then set the application
proxy? Just a thought....

Ya its not nice which is why I implemented the application wide proxy rather.

I dont have any hard evidence, but perhaps the issue is caused by the
python bindings across the plugin interface rather than the set
applicationproxy per se. It would be interesting if you tried from
within your python plugin to getApplicationProxy and see if it matches
the settings you gave in qgs options....

Great. I guess the rider to this is that if we allow a plugin to e.g.
put an action into the edit menu, the action should also be placed in
the edit toolbar (if the plugin writer wishes it to appear in the
toolbar at all).

Right - I made a dirty kludge in src/app/qgisappinterface.h

 74         QToolBar* addToolBar(QString name);
 75         /** Get the file toolbar - intended for use with plugins which
 76          *   add a new file type handler.
 77          */
 78         QToolBar * fileToolBar(); <--- **kludge**

Which I made to try to allow the plugins like wms, wfs, gps to more
naturally be put into the toolbar for layers. My feeling is that we
should modify the plugin api to do something like:

//access to QGISAPP toolbars
QStringList toolBarList();
QToolBar * toolBar(QString name);
QToolBar * addToolBar(QString name);
//access to QGISAPP menus
QStringList menuList();
QMenu * menu(QString name);
QMenu * addMenu(QString name);

This should give plugin writers leave to put their actions pretty much
anywhere needed and even e.g. remove one action if they are replacing
it with a new and better one. Of course they would need to implement
their plugins to respect the HIG guidelines as you have described
which is something we could not always rely on but should document
somewhere on the coders manual or similar.

Perhaps menu ordering and plugin ordering are things that can to some
extent be addressed by giving plugin writers full access to the menus
as I described above - though I suspect it wont go far enough....

Obviously c) would be first prize, but given finite time and pressed
to choose I would lean towards following KDE HIG guidelines first on
linux and in future adding support for gnome HIG if you / we have
time.

Once again +1 from me for you to commit your menu updates.!

 Ah. What I need is HttpCachingProxy. Sadly my PyQt (4.3.3) doesn't
have it, and what Qgis does is the HttpProxy which, as it explains,
uses the CONNECT call to tunnel out.

 The docs you pointed me to strengthens my argument. HttpProxy types
are for tunnelling all networking out through an open port 80, and
HttpCachingProxy types are for web access only:

"The application's default proxy should not be set to the type
HttpCachingProxy, since normal, outgoing TCP connections will fail,
including those necessary to send the HTTP request in the first
place."

 Those of us behind an http caching proxy (e.g. squid) need any QHttp
requests to have an HttpCachingProxy set on them. Currently I only see
this can be done on each QHttp request individually. Python's urllib
does this, and gets its proxy settings from the system (env variables
in Linux). It does it right.

 In summary, Qt's proxy system isn't quite developed yet...

system with qt4.4.

<CGI617> Now I have another weird problem.  I load a latlon nad27 quad map
of California and a geology map in state plane zone 3 nad27 with otf turned
on.  Saved it in a project and reran qgis.
<CGI617> otf is still on and each layer pointing to the right projection,
but the layers don't over lay each other.  Looking at the metadata of the
geology layer shows that the projection has changed.  In the proj string
x_0=2000000 instead of 609601.2192024384.
<CGI617> I click on the layer properties general tab and click on Change CRS
and I can see that the right projection is selected.  After clicking on OK
and then OK on the layer properties dialog box, I can see the geology
feature move to the correct position.
<CGI617> it seems that qgis assumes that the projection used meters instead
of feet

Hi qgis devs,

The printcomposer branch is ready for testing now. The branch is available with svn:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/advanced_printing_branch

I'm going to compile windows binaries next week so that it is also possible to test for non-developers. The plan is to merge the printing branch to trunk prior to feature freeze for 1.0 (25. August).

I commited a fix for that one, fixed the debian packaging, built
windows binaries with MSVC and uploaded the CPack installer package to

Marco,

I've done some testing of the printing branch. Much improved!
I have a few comments:

- when printing the map, qgis provides no feedback on when it has finished - perhaps a busy cursor is required here?

- the legend for polygons puts the coloured rectangle below the layer name. Having the ability to have the coloured rectangle to the right of the layer name would be useful.

- if I place a few items onto the composer, then click on one of them, press the delete key, and continue doing that, when I click on the last remaining item, qgis will crash (error on console is:

QgsComposerItem::setSelected
Fatal: ASSERT failure in QList<T>::at: "index out of range", file /usr/include/QtCore/qlist.h, line 393
Aborted

- if one resizes the rectangle that surrounds an item and drags it to the left and above the top left-hand corner of the original rectangle, one gets into a situation where the rectangle no longer surrounds the item and one loses the ability to move it back :(

- sometimes the scalebar item is just a short vertical line. I haven't found a way to reliably reproduce this...

Regards

Gavin

(Bump.)

No ideas? I'm concerned about the message - I can't notice any breakage,
but it doesn't mean it's there. The warning sounds serious and it must
have some reason.

Marco,

It built and installed well on OS X 10.5.4 and Qt 4.4.1. The  
attachment shows some layout issues. After I add a map, trying to add  
another map to the composer window seems to fail. Using the print  
function, then sending the print output to OS X's Preview.app to view  
the print output caused a crash. Here is some of the output, possibly  
relevant:

Well, very recent library versions cause problems mostly for linux
users which usually use packages from distros and manual installation
of the libs discourages quite a lot

Yes, so why to do this work just before the release?

You're right. I'm aware of the issues. On windows we have to build
many deps by ourselves so building also geos is not such a problem.
The thing about c++ api not being recommended is really something that
we should avoid in long term. But doing it now just kills the
development effort I (and others) would like to give to enhance qgis.

Indeed. However I would prefer the cooperation in way that first we
list what we need, they make the necessary changes and then we can
switch to C api.

IMHO the change we need isn't that important, it's probably just a
sanity check and AFAIK there are other sanity checks missing.

QGIS compiles fine with current GEOS.

And we need to produce packages for all distributions anyway - is there 
a distribution that carries own qgis packages?  That could include GEOS.

As it's just one more GEOS call, that probably won't break anything.

Not ideal, but just a temporary workaround.

Because I wanted to package for OSGeo4W and use the dependencies there.
They only ship the C-API.   Maybe bad timing, but IMHO a move in the
right direction.

Hm, so we don't switch to the C-API while we still can with just little
effort, but instead plan to introduce more and more dependencies to the
C++-API, which we know we won't use in the long term and which makes the
switch require more effort?

Unless the C-API, which currently hides the different geometry classes
in GEOS, is changed heavily, which I doubt will happen, inheriting from
GEOS classes is IMHO a bad move.

Why not work more closely with the GEOS folks and do the changes
incrementally?

 The wfs plugins and providers use QgsHttpTransaction which does an
explicit setProxy on its QHttp object. Code that uses QHttp directly
(e.g. Borys' plugin installer) needs to call setProxy itself. This
shouldn't be too hard to fix (might have a go myself tomorrow...it's
late now!).

 I still think the Qt proxying is confusing, and that note about "not
setting a caching server as an application proxy server or you break
stuff" is worrying. They need to separate the networking proxying from
web caching proxying.

 There's no python binding for QgsHttpTransaction at the moment...

Hi J?rgen,

The vector layer patch looks very good. I think it is important to incorporate 
the vectorlayer and attribute table changes for 1.0 because of stability of 
1.0 interface.

I could not compile the code with geos2 and had some linker errors with 3.0.0:

/home/marco/src/qgis/build/src/core/libqgis_core.so: undefined reference to 
`GEOSWKTReader_destroy'
/home/marco/src/qgis/build/src/core/libqgis_core.so: undefined reference to 
`GEOSWKTReader_create'
/home/marco/src/qgis/build/src/core/libqgis_core.so: undefined reference to 
`GEOSWKTReader_read'

Also, I saw that you now use featuresInRectangle() for labelling. The drawback 
of featuresInRectangle compared to provider getNextFeature is that it keeps 
all the features in memory (well, in fact that is my fault, because I wrote 
featuresInRectangle() ).
It would be really great to have a method QgsVectorLayer::getNextFeature that 
calls QgsVectorDataProvider::getNextFeature but replaces/adds/deletes the 
changed attributes. Like this, labelling and rendering would always be up to 
date with uncommited changes.

Regards,
Marco

Oh, I linked to libgeos.so instead of libgeos_c.so. 
It works now.

Hi J?rgen and Martin,

There seem to be consensus to change to geos c-api. The question is only when.

I see the pros and cons for both. Personally, I'd prefer to do the change 
before 1.0 (so the risky way). Because we need to live with the public qgis 
interface of 1.0.0 for quite a while. 
Plugins and third party apps may appear that create/modify qgis geometry with 
passing a geos geometry. And those would need to change from geos c++  to c 
api too once the geometry refactoring is done in qgis 2.xx

Regards,
Marco

Hi all.
With the deadline for 1.0 freeze approaching, I think it is worth the
while to consider bugfixing. We currently have a lengthy list (N=46):
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&must_fix=Yes&milestone=Version+1.0.0&order=priority
Do you think it is feasible to squash all of them before release? Or we
should check and lower the priority for some of them?
All the best.

Hi John,

Thanks for your feedback.

>After I add a map, trying to add  
>another map to the composer window seems to fail

After adding one item to the composer, the active tool automatically switches to 'select'. Because usually, people want to move or resize an item after adding it. Does it work if you choose the 'addMap' Tool a second time for the second map?

Right, I'm going to test on Mac too.

Marco,

It built and installed well on OS X 10.5.4 and Qt 4.4.1. The  
attachment shows some layout issues. After I add a map, trying to add  
another map to the composer window seems to fail. Using the print  
function, then sending the print output to OS X's Preview.app to view  
the print output caused a crash. Here is some of the output, possibly  
relevant:

Hi Gavin,

Thanks for the feedback.

I added a busy cursor and fixed the problem with inverted item box.
Also, there is a fix for the crash when removing scalebar after removing the map.

> - sometimes the scalebar item is just a short vertical line. I haven't found a way to reliably reproduce this...
> - the legend for polygons puts the coloured rectangle below the layer name. Having the ability to have the coloured rectangle to the right of the layer name would be useful.

These two items are on my todo list.

Marco

Marco,

I've done some testing of the printing branch. Much improved!
I have a few comments:

- when printing the map, qgis provides no feedback on when it has finished - perhaps a busy cursor is required here?

- the legend for polygons puts the coloured rectangle below the layer name. Having the ability to have the coloured rectangle to the right of the layer name would be useful.

- if I place a few items onto the composer, then click on one of them, press the delete key, and continue doing that, when I click on the last remaining item, qgis will crash (error on console is:

QgsComposerItem::setSelected
Fatal: ASSERT failure in QList<T>::at: "index out of range", file /usr/include/QtCore/qlist.h, line 393
Aborted

- if one resizes the rectangle that surrounds an item and drags it to the left and above the top left-hand corner of the original rectangle, one gets into a situation where the rectangle no longer surrounds the item and one loses the ability to move it back :(

- sometimes the scalebar item is just a short vertical line. I haven't found a way to reliably reproduce this...

Regards

Gavin

from the qgis api side, it would be a good step, that's true, since
the ABI for c api will be the same.

I hope we will be able to cooperate well with geos folks, I'm just
affraid that the number of additions to C api will be quite big -
stuff like geometry editors, maybe also geometry and coordinate
sequence factories etc.

but as I'm far away from all the actions, I'll leave the decisions up to you :-)

Hi Folks (esp Juergen and Marco)

I would like to ask if it is possible to merge in your changes to
trunk before feature freeze deadline as I would like to make a number
of API cleanups and changes after you have merged in. I am doing my
API cleanups mostly by script but some parts are manual and it would
be better to have pending changes in trunk before I do it.

Many thanks,

Hi

My feeling is similar to Marco's - I prefer to make changes now that
ensure that we dont land up with people developing plugins and core
functionality against an api that we later discover we need to change.

My only real concern is that we don't deploy QGIS in a way that
prevents people from using their OS packages for geos etc. I guess we
can work with our packagers for now and ask them to build updated geos
packages but it seems a hassle and therfore potentially unreliable.

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

Thanks for waiting with the api cleanups.
I can merge in the composer changes tomorrow or on Friday.

Regards,
Marco

I actually didn't follow the whole discussion.... BTW: the latest release of 
QGIS for MS-Windows has been built with GEOS 3.0.0
I hope this helps.

Yes, I e-mailed you :)
The URL is 
http://gigamaildownload.rossoalice.alice.it/download/download.aspx?AttachmentID=c65d3959-4562-47f8-9146-0c2c35233241&DeliveryID=8c41515e-13d1-4df3-bcb4-fb461ae36ce6

Please, also, remark (as a note to the installer file) that the new 
installer (QGIS-0.11.0-2-Setup.exe) automatically performs the uninstall + 
new install procedure, thus there is no need to uninstall the previously 
installed version of QGIS before to install the new one. In few words: do 
not uninstall QGIS if previously installed, just launch the installer and 
follow the instructions in it.

Cheers ;)

(Bump.) Feature freeze is near. It could use some testing.

Done.

I've commited several little changes, the large vector patch and the
GEOS C-API migration patch.   I verified that my patches applied
(almost) cleanly to the advanced printing branch beforehand, so there's
hope that my commit won't make Marcos commit troublesome.

The vector changes also replaces QgsVectorLayer::featuresInRectangle
with select/getNextFeature (like Marco suggested) and adds support for
numeric ranges with spinboxes.

No, this happens after selecting the "Add Map Item" tool. When I  
select that tool, then draw a rectangle on the canvas, nothing  
happens. No debug output and the rectangle disappears. There are no  
new items added to the canvas.

I can add labels and legends, just not additional map items.

After grouping a map item with a legend, then moving the grouped item  
(not sure if the latter part made a difference), I was then able to  
add a new map item as expected. If you have a Mac, this might be  
something to try to help work out the issue.

Marco,

Is it possible, or planned, to be able to move map items to the  
forward or backward? In other words, to be able to arrange map items  
to bring them to the front of another item (drawn on top) or to place  
them back in the draw queue. I hope that makes sense.

Yes, this is one thing that I plan to implement before feature freeze.

Hi Marco

One thing I also wanted to ask - some time ago on this list we
discussed the mapcomposer overhaul and one of the ideas was to provide
a separate library component (to go into gui lib) and then a part in
app that makes use of this and handles user interaction. Is this still
possible? I would like to update the quickprint plugin to use your new
composer code but from basic looking through your changes I dont see a
way to do this without refactoring composer stuff. Failing that I will
probably try to repair it or remove it or disable it (since it has
been broken since render context stuff came into trunk I think). I
think there is still a strong usecase for having something like
quickprint where users basically press a button and get a print ready
map, so in an ideal world I'd like to not remove it. Do you have any
thoughts on the matter?

Best regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

I think most of the composer classes are reusable for plugins. Is your idea for the new quickprint plugin that it automatically places the items on the composer and user interacts with composer gui or that it directly prints to a pdf or similar format? I think both would be possible with the new composer code:

A plugin could create an instance of QgsComposition (that is a subclass of QGraphicsScene now). Then the plugin adds items programatically to the scene (e.g. QgsComposerMap, QgsComposerScaleBar, ...). Those items are separated from the configuration widgets now, so can be used also by plugins or even non-gui related code.

Then the plugin configures a paint device and a QPainter and calls QGraphicsScene::render to draw the map.

I think that even QgsComposer and QgsComposerView could be moved to gui such that plugins can use the composer gui.

So I suggest to move the following classes to core/composer:

QgsComposition
QgsComposerMap
QgsComposerPicture
QgsComposerLabel
QgsComposerScaleBar
QgsComposerLegend

and QgsComposer and QgsComposerView would go to gui.
In the QgisInterface class, there could be a method that returns a pointer to the composer of the current instance such that plugins could add their own buttons/item types.


But I must admit that I'm not familiar with the quickprint code and maybe there are some technical problems I didn't consider.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco

One thing I also wanted to ask - some time ago on this list we
discussed the mapcomposer overhaul and one of the ideas was to provide
a separate library component (to go into gui lib) and then a part in
app that makes use of this and handles user interaction. Is this still
possible? I would like to update the quickprint plugin to use your new
composer code but from basic looking through your changes I dont see a
way to do this without refactoring composer stuff. Failing that I will
probably try to repair it or remove it or disable it (since it has
been broken since render context stuff came into trunk I think). I
think there is still a strong usecase for having something like
quickprint where users basically press a button and get a print ready
map, so in an ideal world I'd like to not remove it. Do you have any
thoughts on the matter?

Best regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Brief history of GIS OSS (bit off topic?)
Message-ID: <48ACBB44.2020600@gmail.com>

Hello lists,

As you can i see im mailing this message to some lists around the web 
(im sorry if thats a problem).

At the moment i am writing my BSc thesis (Geography) focusing the 
development of a open source software and database for logging and 
analysing traffic accidents in Uberl?ndia, MG - Brazil.

I am dedicating a chapter in my thesis to explaining Open Source 
Software, and OSS for GIS. i searched the web for some history of OSS in 
general, but i found too many different sources. So i come to you, 
developers of GIS OSS, to see if you can give me references of where to 
search for the history and process regarding this theme.

I am using to build this system PostgreSQL + PostGIS, QGis and PHP. In 
advance i would like to thank David Bitner who helped me alot by letting 
me use his geocoding function for PostGIS.

Im sorry to take up your time like this, and as soon the thesis is ready 
i will translate bits off it and put it on the web for anyone 
interested. (if someone can help me translate portuguese to english i 
can release it completely)

Thanks to you all!

George,

Here is number of "keywords" related to history of FOSS4G
and that you may google for and find details:

- Sol Katz
- Map Overlay and Statistical System (MOSS)
- GRASS History (http://grass.itc.it/devel/grasshist.html)
- UMP MapServer history

Is your idea for the new quickprint plugin that it automatically places the items on the composer and user interacts with composer gui or that it directly prints to a pdf or similar format?

Yes my idea is that the layout is created programmatically based on a

layout templates the user can choose from (for one day in the future).

Right this is exactly what I had in mind with my previous post. In
addition I will try to build some unit tests for the parts that live
in core...

Well I would probably rip out most of it and replace as much as
possible with calls to code in core/composer and or gui/composer. The
key thing for now is to get the non interactive bits into core or gui
(and probably build SIP files for them too so pythonistas can play too
:-).

Hi Tim,

Good. I'm going to move the files into the corresponding dirs before merging 
the branch to trunk.

Hi Tim,

It will take longer for me to do the merge. I have tons of svn conflicts to resolve.
I think it's going to be saturday or sunday until the composer merge is ready.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Folks (esp Juergen and Marco)

I would like to ask if it is possible to merge in your changes to
trunk before feature freeze deadline as I would like to make a number
of API cleanups and changes after you have merged in. I am doing my
API cleanups mostly by script but some parts are manual and it would
be better to have pending changes in trunk before I do it.

Many thanks,

Ok - I may push the feature freeze back a few days to accommodate this.

Hi Tim,

Yes, those changes are really hard to merge as they crossed J?rgens changes in trunk. I therefore left the revisions 9087 - 9115 out in the merge. As you know better about the code changes in those revesions, it would be good if you could merge them.

Marco

Hi,

To allow compilation with Qt 4.3.x, I changed line 219 of 
qgsvectorlayerproperties.cpp

tblAttributes->setCurrentCell(row, idx, QItemSelectionModel::NoUpdate);

tblAttributes->setCurrentCell(row, idx)


I hope this change does not create any side effects.

Hello lists,

I have been away for a large portion of the summer, and as a result
have fallen behind in terms of bug-fixes etc. associated with fTools.
As such, I am asking anyone who has used this plugin to let me know of
any and all problems that you have experienced. I would like to
release a significantly improved version once QGIS 1.0 has been
released, and therefore would like to incorporate as many
suggestions/bug-fixes/improvements as possible. For those of you who
have already sent me emails regarding this, thank you, I will continue
to try to address these problems, though if you were to send me your
problems again, I would probably be able to get to them sooner.

Thanks,

Carson

Carson,

There seem to be multiple problems on the Mac platform (OS X 10.5.4  
with Qt4.4.1). From a recent svn build, I have strange problems with  
truncated file paths when selecting the "Output Path" for many of the  
tools. If I browse to a path called /Users/username/Desktop, the path  
may show as /Users/usern once the browse dialog is closed. This does  
not seem to happen always, so I have no idea as to why this occurs.

I just tried using the Distance Matrix analysis tool. No problem  
browsing to my Desktop folder to create a file called test.csv. When I  
ran the tool, though, a python error window came up with this message:

An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):

Generally speaking, these tools are not working on OS X. At least from  
my experience. If I can assist you in debugging those this coming  
week, feel free to email me on or off list. I will try to be on irc  
also.

Thanks,
John

Marco,

I just built rev 9137 on OS X, and that went fine. I am trying to test  
the composer. Some things I can report:

The 'Export as Image' button does not seem to do anything for me.

Exporting to svg works, but fonts scale much larger than they appear  
in the composer (this might be something you never touched, not sure).

Printing the composer image crashes qgis when I select 'Preview' in  
the OS X print dialog (this basically sends the image to Preview.app,  
OS X's image viewing software, rather than to a physical device).  
Oddly, printing to a physical device worked. Choosing Save as PDF  
under the PDF drop-down in the OS X print dialog also causes a crash.

I still have problems with the add map image tool not doing anything  
in the composer canvas. Just now, I opened print composer, clicked add  
new map, drew my bounding box and nothing happened. No map item, no  
frame on the screen. After adding a legend, the add new map tool worked.

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you troubleshoot  
these issues.

Thanks,
John

Message-ID: <d368056f0808231552yc1b9f5fq46a4ae35f23e6ba@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks

Now that Marcos composer changes are in, Jurgen and I have been
committing some more sweeping changes to svn. If you have uncommitted
work you may encounter issues if you update since the committed
changes include formatting updates. Before you update I suggest you:

* svn status to get a list of locally modified files
* backup modified files
* svn revert all changed files
* svn update
* overwrite files that have been modified from your backup
* run scripts/astyle.sh on the overwritten files e.g.

scripts/astyle.sh src/app/qgisapp.cpp src/app/qgisapp.h

Linux users can install astyle from apt (sudo apt-get install astyle).

As a general practive it would also be good if you can run the
astyle.sh on source code before committing it to ensure it remains
compliant with the QGIS coding guidelines. At some stage in the future
we will probably implement an automated solution for this (script that
checks out QGIS sources nightly, applies astyle to the code and
commits any changes back).

A reminder that tomorrow is slated to be the start of feature freeze -
there are a few more things to go in - Tom's menu updates and I have a
few minor things to add. Ill be trying to not put off the feature
freeze if it can be helped, but if anyone has need of more time please
let me know.

Regards

Hi All

We now have merged into svn trunk all the major new features (thanks
Marco, Jef, Tom!). There are still some outstanding API cleanups I
would like to do, as well as creating missing icons for composer and
adding frequently used CRS's option to the CRS selection dialog. I
would like to extend the feature freeze start for a week to cater for
this. Any objections? I would move other milestones for the release on
a week too.

Tom just for some feedback, I compiled your menu updates on ubuntu
heron, running kde 4 and everything looks great.

Regards

When you add a new bounding box to a map, you have to choose the option
cache in the preview select box. Sometimes it is necessary to click
update preview.

Hope this helps

Marco,

I just built rev 9137 on OS X, and that went fine. I am trying to test  
the composer. Some things I can report:

The 'Export as Image' button does not seem to do anything for me.

Exporting to svg works, but fonts scale much larger than they appear  
in the composer (this might be something you never touched, not sure).

Printing the composer image crashes qgis when I select 'Preview' in  
the OS X print dialog (this basically sends the image to Preview.app,  
OS X's image viewing software, rather than to a physical device).  
Oddly, printing to a physical device worked. Choosing Save as PDF  
under the PDF drop-down in the OS X print dialog also causes a crash.

I still have problems with the add map image tool not doing anything  
in the composer canvas. Just now, I opened print composer, clicked add  
new map, drew my bounding box and nothing happened. No map item, no  
frame on the screen. After adding a legend, the add new map tool worked.

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you troubleshoot  
these issues.

Thanks,
John

Hi Tom,

I've seen your changeset r9160.

The default font setting on my windows box is MS Shell Dlg 2, 8pt. So
with you patch that become 6pt, which is hard to read and the original
Helvetica, 9pt is even a bit larger than the default.

I'd opt for removing the special font setting in the attribute table.

Hi Tim,

The feature freeze extension is ok for me. 
The number of changes is really impressive, having more time to incorporate 
them is certainly a good option.

I have just tried your fTools in recent trunk bulid (r9163) and the

selecting the layer:

getDataProvider() was renamed to dataProvider() - but Carson is already
porting to the QGIS 1.0 API.

For a long time, the point size was set to 11. This was good because the Mac standard sizes are 13 (normal) and 11 (small).

About a week ago, the size was changed to 9 which seemed somewhat small to me. This did not reduce the Mac line height so the result was the same number of lines with greater text margin and less readable text. The line height is probably due to the row header still using standard-small (Mac 11pt) for header text.

I noticed that Gnome was using 11/9 as normal/small while Mac was using 13/11. I don't have Windows and assumed it would be similar to Gnome. I guessed that -2 would be a good way to specify "smaller text" in a cross-platform way.

Also, on a Mac, Lucida Grande is the default font so I removed Helvetica. Qt has keywords such as Serif and SansSerif to specify cross-platform fonts but SansSerif (X11 Helvetica, Mac Lucida Grande) is already the default.

I will change it again specifying 11 for Mac and 9 for X11. What is a good size for Windows?

Message-ID: <48B2BF2C.3020305@o2.pl>

Hi Marco,

Testing the new composer's cool features I discovered the following
problems:

0. Polygon fill is still broken in the output e.g. PDF), as it's been
for the old composer.

1. Label buffering is corrupted in the output (same as it was too).

2. Label offsets in the composer, in the output and on the QGIS map
canvas do not match each other (i.e. the distance between the object and
it's label is different in all of them, for a given label offset setting).

3. "Refresh view" does not redraw the print composer fully. E. g. add an
SVG image, put a path to another one in it's properties, refresh the
view - no change; now move the image - and it refreshes).

Request - could the mouse scroll have the same function it has defined
in QGIS main properties? So that e.g. the zoom on scroll worked?

As you probably noticed by now, the menus have been updated.

Some additional work remains:

For Mac only, the main menu bar still needs to be made visible for all 
windows so that the new (Mac) Window menu can be used for switching 
between windows.

The Plugin menu code needs updating. The list of plugins should be a 
floating block which could start at any position and also allow 
additional unrelated items below. Right now, unrelated items can't 
easily be added either above or below the list. (I tried adding a bottom 
separator for the Python console and it sorted itself to the top next to 
the first separator!)

The new action, menu and toolbar accessors need to be tested with some 
plugins to see if the API is sufficient to actually add menu items to 
arbitrary locations. I will test the WFS and GRASS plugins as mentioned 
  previously in the thread.

Finally, should the toolbars be modified to match the menus or changed 
in some other way? I'm not planning to do anything but I will rearrange 
them if someone make a proposal.

Hello GRASS Users,

I have removed Qt3 classes from all of the GRASS plugin/provider except 
the GRASS shell.

A patch is available for testing from:
http://telwertowski.home.comcast.net/grass_noqt3_r9170.diff

If this works for others, I will submit it to svn.

I have also ported the last remaining Qt3 class, qgsgrassshell, but it 
still has bugs due to a major redesign of QTextEdit. I might get back to 
it in a few weeks or I can make it available for someone else to work on 
now.

Hi Peter

Yes its just a case of missed / havent got there yet. Feel free to
make these kind of updates if you spot anymore over the course of this
week. Once we declare a stable API we are going to have to live with
it for quite a while so it will be good to tidy up any API ugliness
now while we have the wriggle room to do it.

Best regards

I also noticed.  I thought it might be intentional to avoid mixing up
coordinates.

Hi Tom

In the grass tidy up branch, I also worked on porting grass shell
class to qt4. As you said there are a lot of complications with the
port and what I have there works to some extent but isnt bug free
either. Perhaps its useful  for your shell work though - if not or you
have a better approach thats fine too.

I will try to test your patch here on ubuntu over the coming day or two.

QGIS builds but then I don't have python incl. the plugin installer available
with the error message like this on a debian lenny starting qgis

at http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2008-August/003289.html
people said they had to downgrade python-qt4 package to version 4.3.3. to make
it work.This would be really bad for me since I am just preparing the opensuse 
build server to create all QGIS 1.0 opensuse rpms with a current QT4 (4.4.x)
version.

So my question :): Is my plan possible at all to build QGIS with QT4 (4.4.x).
Is there a solution to fix this or which QT versions work at the moment? 

thanks a lot 
 Otto

For Windows I find that the default size is about right. I had noticed on
some computers that the Helvetica font coded into the Attribute Table was
not very good looking for some reason and was considering changing  it to
something else.

With r9160 the font size was too small, so I changed to the default size.  

In main.cpp there is the line myApp.setFont(...) which has been commented
out. I experimented with setting the font for the application. I found that
most text elements used the application font setting, but some have specific
font coding. A quick look through many of of the dialogs showed that there
was only a few text entry boxes that might be too small in width at 14pt or
greater. 

As I do computer user support for my day job I am aware that some users need
larger font sizes for more comfortable reading of the display. An
application-wide font setting would give users the ability to the set the
font to their liking.

I recommend that such a setting would initially be the platform's default as
Qt sets it. In addition all text elements in menus, dialogs and status bars
should use the application font, perhaps up- or down-sizing if appropriate,
unless there is a very good reason not to.

Hi Panan:

Is nice to hear that you are interested in getting qgis working for windows
ce platform.

In my case I found a problem with geos library, for some reason when I
compile the qgis core with geos the application does not run, I have been
looking for an answer to this problem but I didn?t find it yet.

How did you compile qgis core and gui? I think provider needs to be compiled
for windows ce platform in order to be recognized by the application.

Did youfind some problems with geos?

Regards

Godofredo Contreras

Subject: [Qgis-developer] extremely verbose debug info editing GRASS vectors
Message-ID: <48B69C65.2020304@o2.pl>

Opening a huge GRASS vector map in GRASS Edit makes QGIS print tones of
debug info (if built with debug) which ruins performance:

> Debug: /home/shoofi/src/straight/qgis-trunk/src/plugins/grass/qgsgrassedit.cpp: 1814: (displayIcon) entered.
> Debug: /home/shoofi/src/straight/qgis-trunk/src/plugins/grass/qgsgrassedit.cpp: 1789: (displayNode) node = 13685
> Debug: /home/shoofi/src/straight/qgis-trunk/src/plugins/grass/qgsgrassedit.cpp: 1814: (displayIcon) entered.
> Debug: /home/shoofi/src/straight/qgis-trunk/src/plugins/grass/qgsgrassedit.cpp: 1789: (displayNode) node = 13686
> Debug: /home/shoofi/src/straight/qgis-trunk/src/plugins/grass/qgsgrassedit.cpp: 1814: (displayIcon) entered.
> Debug: /home/shoofi/src/straight/qgis-trunk/src/plugins/grass/qgsgrassedit.cpp: 1789: (displayNode) node = 13687

... and so forth.

Could it be fixed so that QGIS built with debug can be still used for
editing GRASS vectors?

Cheers,
Maciek

QGIS and GRASS devs,

Below I'm forwarding you a QGIS-GRASS issue. It seems to be somewhat
related to https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/554#comment:7.

You used the '-v' switch which means: "Use raster values as categories
instead of unique sequence". Thus, it is normal that the output table
has only that many rows, as many unique cell values were there in the
input raster map. Multiple polygons are linked to the same table row (by
having the same category), so there are more polygons than rows in the
table indeed.

QGIS table editor does not present a GRASS vector map table as it really
is, but treats each vector feature separately. This has the pro that you
can access individual polygons from the table editor, no matter that
multiple polygons have the same category. The con is that it's not the
real table as it is, which confuses some users. Best if QGIS could
provide both modes, with the current behaviour as an option and
defaulting to real table layout.

for openSUSE it now builds, although there are still CMake Warnings as I
wrote below. There were just dependency problems - missing packages. If you
like, I can send you the SUSE.spec file with all requirements directly. See
other Mail for more info about SUSE.

For Debian and Ubuntu I still need to find out, what is missing on my PC and
Laptop, but as Tim wrote, it should work. I can write a solution when I know
what happened.

ok, good to know.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 0.11.0 rpm also available for older SUSE
Message-ID: <20080828162724.08616c8a@nature>

Dear QGIS-user,

QGIS 0.11.0 rpm packages are now also available for older SUSE versions. 

a) For "uptodate" openSUSE versions you can install QGIS 0.11.0 (and related
packages) as usuall from the Application:Geo Repository at:
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Application:/Geo/

openSUSE 10.3: it builds with libqt4-4.3.1 and python-qt4-4.3
openSUSE 11.0: it builds with libqt4-4.4.0 and python-qt4-4.4.2
openSUSE Factory (Testing): it builds with libqt4-4.4.1 and python-qt4-4.4.3

b) Then, there is now a new Repository called Application:Geo:QT4. If you
want/have to use QGIS with older openSUSE versions you need to add both
Repositories:

http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Application:/Geo/
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Application:/Geo:/QT4/

to your package installer and then get QGIS 0.11.0 incl. current QT4 and
python-qt4 for:

openSUSE 10.2: it builds with libqt4-4.4.1 and python-qt4-4.4.3
SLE_10: it builds with libqt4-4.4.1 and python-qt4-4.4.3

 regards,
  Otto

Message-ID: <20080829085102.0ae52ff6@intevation.de>

Hello QGISSers,

while using the new RPM-packages for Suse I enconutered a crash (on
SLE10) when hitting the projection-selector on the bottom right of the
qgis-screen.

The message is as follows, perhaps helpful for you:

qgis: /usr/src/packages/BUILD/qgis-0.11.0/src/gui/qgsprojectionselector.cpp:610: 
void QgsProjectionSelector::applyProjList(QSet<QString>*): Zusicherung
?rc == 0? nicht erf?llt.

Does this has something to do with packaging or is this a more deeper
problem (or even solved upstream)?

Best regards and thanks in advance.

	Stephan

answering to myself....

This seems to be a problem with a too-old sqlite3-version. My maschines
runs sqlite3 3.2.8 which apparently does have a problem to read srs.db

What version of SQLite3 is at least required? 3.2.8 seems too old
though.

sqlite3 /usr/share/qgis/resources/srs.db
SQLite version 3.2.8
Enter ".help" for instructions
sqlite> .schema
Error: unsupported file format
sqlite>

Thanks for your help.

Hi Tim,

Regarding this change - pressing Enter in CRS selector usually makes
help window po up as well. Could this maybe be avoided?

Cheers!

Hi, 

I tried to use WITH_INTERNAL_SQLITE3=TRUE in my cmake configuration as listed
below;

cmake -Wno-dev \
      -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%{_prefix} \
      -D GRASS_PREFIX=/opt/grass\
      -D QGIS_LIB_SUBDIR=%{lib} \
      -D QGIS_PLUGIN_SUBDIR=%{lib}/qgis \
      -D QGIS_MANUAL_SUBDIR=share/man \
      -D WITH_INTERNAL_SQLITE3=TRUE .

and get error messages during compilation of QGIS 0.11.0:

maybe someone can help and tell if I used the cmake option
in a wrong way or if it is a bug in QGIS?

thanks a lot

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Requirement for int4 column on PostGIS access
Message-ID: <20080830144242.GA25782@eldorado.topf.org>

Currently QGIS requires a int4 column with unique IDs for accessing data
in a PostGIS database. I routinely work with OpenStreetMap data which
uses int8 for its IDs. Currently the OSM IDs still fit into an int4, but
this will not work forever. At the moment its a bit of a hassle that I
always have to keep this limitation in mind.

Is the limitation on int4 columns something hardcoded deep in the code
or is it something that could be changed reasonably easy? I understand
the need for a unique ID column, but it would be nice if the data type
was more flexible. I think at least int2, int4, and int8 should be
supported.

Just supporting the different type isn't a big problem.  But QGIS is
currently tied to 32bit feature ids (as is OGR btw).  So once you leave
that range you'd run into problems.

Hi

You may need to clean or completely recreate your build dir. Also, can
you run make like this:

make VERBOSE=1

And verify that your sqlite include path is correct for the INTERNAL sqlite?

Thanks

J?rgen already send me a patch and it fixed the problems decribed in this mail.
Now a new error occured, I sent it to J?rgen, too. When it is fixed I write to
the list.

Message-ID: <d368056f0808311216j71a54843l13bc1294437d0686@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All
In making cleanups before 1.0 feature freeze I have made numerous
consistency fixes to the gui api. This will affect all plugins which
will need minor adjustments in order to work again. Please see this
page [1] for a detailed list of changes I have made.  Obviously I
realise these changes will inconvenience many plugin and third party
application writers, but it was important to make them now before we
start the QGIS 1.x  release series. In the 1.x series we will be
guaranteeing backwards API compatibility between 1.x releases -
something we have not offered to this point. This guarantee is a
double edged sword - it will make it much easier to write long lived
QGIS based applications, but it will also drastically reduce the
flexibility we will have to make substantial improvements to the API.


Thank you all for your understanding in this and let me know if you
need any help in porting your application or plugin to the updated
API.

Best regards

At the risk of sounding like a priest / rabbi / clergy of your choice:

If anyone has any reason why we shouldnt proceed with feature freeze
tomorrow  please let me know ASAP or forever hold your peace :-)

Peter are we going to wait for your raster tweaks for 1.1? We could
maybe delay the freeze start till the end of this week if you think it
will help - let me know.

Tom is there anything pending from your side that we need to hang 5 for?


If I dont hear any objections by tomorrow, we will officially be in
feature freeze from tuesday (I will send out a new notice to confirm
that feature freeze is started).

Once feature freeze kicks in could I appeal to everyone to try their
best to do their relevant part to make this release happen before the
end of September - I would love to be able to announce that QGIS 1.0
is available at FOSS4G2008 in Cape Town at the end of Sept.

The community team folks working on the web site it would be great to
get it spruced up in time for that too!

Best regards and many thanks,

New plugin installer is the 1st that comes to my mind. When is it
going to be put into SVN?

Borys any thoughts on that? Is it ready for 'prime time' now?

Hi everyone,
Hum... as usual I've been trying to improve QGIS tools to fit to my needs. And 
as usual the result is some upgrades in the plugins and a new tool.
The new tool is the pypostgis plugin. It's a very rough plugin to pass queries 
to postgis using OGR connection. It creates a primary key for the resulting 
table and loads it to QGis. 
The update in qgis_rgb is that now the plugin creates a virtual raster instead 
of a new huge geotiff. I think it's the best aproach as the plugin goal is to 
be a quick way to visualize satelite data in qgis. It now uses gdal and 
python-xml so i don't know if it's going to work on windows (can someone 
test?). The drawback is that the vrt is slower than the RGB geotif.
The update in qgsAzimuth is the irradiation process. The goal is to be rough 
precision drawing for qgis.
The update in qgsAddWkt is the geometry validation. The approach chosen is 
very ugly as it tests the expression creating a new ogr geometry from wkt. 
And if it works it creates a qgsgeometry from wkt. It's done this way because 
I wasn't able to catch the exception when creating a qgsgeometry from wkt. I 
think it's a QGIS' API bug. If it's not I'd be glad to know.
Well, I hope someone like the plugins as much as I enjoy making them. Any 
sugestions to improve them is welcome.

Freeze away, the mods that needed GUI updates are done. The rest should 
be clean up and continued bug fixes.
