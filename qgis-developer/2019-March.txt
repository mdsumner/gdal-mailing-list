(sorry, resending unencrypted... really don't know why all these mails
get encrypted automagically)

Just installed a crisp 3.4.5-1 QGIS for a Windows user who failed to
run Grass algorithms.

Looking into it, processing was complaining and showing it could not
create a temporary directory:

ERROR: Unable to create directory <grass7-User Name-16676>! Exiting

(note the space!) where 'User Name' was the profile name of this person

So I thought: space in profile name: let's change the temp dir to C:\temp

But even then the exact same error pops up.

So my question is: is either grass OR processing trying to create a temp
dir name based on the profile name? Which in a lot of Windows users is
with a space in it (because people use "Firstname Lastname" at least
here in The Netherlands as profile name).

It is very hard in Windows to 'just remote the space from the profile'
if I understand correctly.

Anybody has this problem also?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <EC0407D2-7099-4DF6-817F-8ADDC520A2EE@3liz.com>

Hi all,

On https://www.qgis.org <https://www.qgis.org/> it is said that the version available on https://qgis.org/debian <https://qgis.org/debian> is the 3.6.x but actually only the 3.4.4 is the latest  available on debian stretch. 

The 3.6.x is available only on 'buster' which is the next debian release.   

Is that on purpose ?

Furthemore, the ltr has been updated to 3.4.5 but the 3.4.5  has not been made available as 'release' (i.e  available on https://qgis.org/debian <https://qgis.org/debian>), is there a reason for that ?

Thx,

David

Ok, to answer this myself :-)

After debugging the grass code, it appears that grass.py was trying to
create this <grass7-User Name-16676> directory in a TMPDIR directory
that was not there anymore.

An old installed (and removed) program created TMPDIR as environment
variable pointing to some long (not excisting) path.
So the code threw a 'WindowsError' not shown in log or output.

Anyway: fixed by removing this TMPDIR variable.

We are already (re)setting all kind of env vars isn't it? Maybe also do
that with TMP TMPDIR and TEMP ?

I'd like to use QgsProcessingParameterMatrix with fixed rows number,

And like in SAGA User defined filter algorithm, the table displayed has 
no rows.

Which part of the QGIS code has to build the displayed table ?

Hi Richard,
in my experience this kind of issue is not a recent thing: it is
pretty common (it was also on QGIS 2.*) in Processing that some tool,
with some provider can fail  if a path contains spaces or special
chars (and recently in QGIS 3 there have been issues with the GRASS
provider an any computer that didn't had a EN locale). There have been
effort and fixes but as far as I remember it was never bullet proof.

cheers!

Yes.  See footnote [4] on

https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu

QGIS 3.6 requires Qt 5.9.  As stretch has 5.7 the latest qgis release is no
longer supported on stretch.

debian/ has 3.6 now.  3.4.5 is in debian-ltr/.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS docs / plugins and use of Constant and
	Enumerations
Message-ID: <c09c7410-2534-0a39-09ba-fe648eefd591@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

a plugin dev was discussing with me the fact he could not find the names
of the different Enumeration values in QGIS to use for python plugins.

As an example: if you want to test if your layers 'type':

iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer().type()
0

is a Vector layer, so you could go to:

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsMapLayer.html#adf3b0b576d7812c4359ece2142170308

Then to the maplayer.h file:
https://qgis.org/api/qgsmaplayer_8h_source.html#l00106

>From where you can count that Vector = 1  etc...
and guess to use:

QgsMapLayer.VectorLayer

Another example: having a 2.x plugin with a test:
geom_type == QGis.WKBPolygon
=> 3

I found:

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsWkbTypes.html#a60e72c2f73cb07fdbcdbc2d5068b5d9c

and then:

https://qgis.org/api/qgswkbtypes_8h_source.html

BUT how can we make this easier for python devs?

Searching in https://qgis.org/pyqgis for example VectorLayer the
constant (as name) does not pop up.

So what would work:
- add comments in the header files? Would these show up in the python
docs then?
- create (automated?) lists of these constants in the pycookbook?
- do a lot of blogging about it :-)

Or: who has an idea (so somebody can maybe pick this up in A Coruna....
:-) )

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/processing/qgsprocessingmatrixparameterdialog.cpp#L111

with unit tests here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/gui/testprocessinggui.cpp#L1760

Let me know if you have any questions about this code -- it's only
new, so is fresh on my mind.

Message-ID: <b7ed631e-610b-5915-8bd7-afa0810e86db@duif.net>

Hi,

I've been asked to see if I can add 'logarithmic' breaks to the
GraduatedSymbolRenderer.
I am right that it is missing, yes?

BUT: looking into current code and testing the available break modes I
happen to look at the Quantile (Equal Count) one with a random dataset I
had around:

https://duif.net/temp/QuantileEqualCount.png

Using more classes makes it even worse:

https://duif.net/temp/QuantileEqualCount2.png

As you see a lot of 'empty' zero classes.
If I google: "The quantile map tries to bin the same count of features
in each of the x classes."

As if the 'breaks'-algorithm cannot handle zero's or floats or negative
values ???

The spread is indeed funny, see:

https://duif.net/temp/EqualInterval.png

What do others think?
Am I misunderstanding things or is my data borked?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps cannot share the data yet... would be cool if there was a processing
algorithm called 'randomize points' or so :-)

Ah, duh. Thanks Thomas, me bad.

I've bookmarked again, but what about putting

I always have to search for it...

we also noticed that for large data sets (tens of thousands records)
`Pretty breaks` classification behaves strangely: when clicking on
Classify repeatedly, classes boundaries change by about 10% all the
time, apparently in a random fashion.
Unsure whether this is the same or a different issue.
All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] random order after open attribute table
Message-ID: <CA+Ei1OcKu5XjmjLVffG6SdQcZKNf3TTP-nDsEb-u_bmYc8NAgw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I found problem with strange row ordering after opening attribute
table in QGIS3. Rows are not ordered correctly (how related features
were written to a layer). In example [1] rows should be ordered
staring with 0. I am getting correct order after pressing 'Reload the
table' [2]. Unfortunately adding code below after loading data in a
plugin

layer.dataProvider().forceReload()

has no effect, rows are still not ordered correctly. I didn't have
such problem with QGIS2, it's seems to be new behaviour. Any idea?

Related question: is it possible to defined for vector layer using
Python API specific field used for default row ordering when opening
attribute table?

Thanks, Martin

Hi Paolo,

I've created a random dataset of 100000 points, but can not reproduce
this behaviour. Can you sent me a dataset or provide more info?

I can't reproduce. Maybe data set dependant?

There was this: https://github.com/SpatialVision/differential_privacy,
but it's QGIS 2.x only (looks trivial to port though). Otherwise run
"Geometry by expression", and set the geometry to
make_point(randf(1,100),randf(1,100))

Do you mean pretty breaks or natural breaks (Jenks)? Jenks has been
that way forever -- by design (for performance) it takes a random
sample of the layer and generates the breaks from that sample only.
The random samples is selected anew with each click of classify, which
results in the different breaks.

Unfortunately not -- they are already there, and appear in the c++
docs. There's a few related parts here:
- sip does not support generation of python docstrings for
enumerations (or member variables, which are effectively what c++
enumerations are converted to in Python)
- Python itself has no standard for member variable docstrings (see
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8820276/docstring-for-variable)
(probably why sip doesn't support these)
- Sphinx does seem to have support for this - see
https://stackoverflow.com/a/8820599/1861260 , but without the sip
support for generating the docstrings we can't take advantage of this

So I think this change would first need to be address in sip, and then
in the QGIS pyqgis doc generation scripts and sphinx templates.

You're right, sorry.
Any way to improve this, perhaps taking a larger sample to reduce variation?
Thanks.

I've created random data in a geopackage and created an issue for it

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/21451

I can reproduce it with memory layer, gpkg and the original shp in both
Master as 2.18...

I've started to use R for all my statistical processing. Natural breaks
is some kind of kmeans-clustering, but R does natural jenks and others,
too.

I'm doing the clustering/binning in R and joining back the results
in QGIS. Maybe that helps for your bigger amout of data.

Mmm, diving into this a little more (googling about Quantiles...), it
appears this has to do with ordering/ranking the data and then set 'breaks'.

So in this dataset there seems to be A LOT of values '0' so if you first
order that dataset, then create the breaks/buckets, it is possible to
have several 'buckets' in the 0 range? So this then is not so much an
error in creating the breaks, but more the visualisation of the numbers
in the classes (IF it is indeed ok, to have several 'classes' all having
0 both as min and as max value....).
Then QGIS should divide the 0-values over the 3 buckets all containing
zero's?

OR am I just misusing a method? And should you not use this method in a
dataset in which the distribution is so uneven?

Anybody more into this statistical theory then I am??

I had a look - as you suspect, it's impossible to divide your data
into 10 equal sized buckets based solely on the distribution of values
contained within it.

That's my thoughts. You'll need to choose a different partitioning method.

Hi Tobias,

I think this approach works in some circumstances, but ideally the
"best practice" binning techniques are available directly for use in
QGIS. It's not exactly a "smooth" workflow to require someone to use
an external tool to achieve this.

I'd be interested to hear which R libraries/functions you think give
better results then QGIS' current algorithms -- it should be trivial
to port these algorithms back to QGIS!

FWIW - this PR was shut down and won't be included in Qt. Basically
the maintainers do not see the point of supporting single-platform
features like this in Qt.

If anyone is still interested in implementing this in QGIS, there's
also https://github.com/msorvig/qt-touchbar for inspiration.

Oops, I didn't want to give the impression that QGIS's algorithms were
bad! I', only using the R  workflow because it gives me the possibility
to save the bins directly in the dataset. In most of my cases, it is
interesting to know in which bin a dataset fell (e.g. if I export
the attribute table and work in Excel or other tools).

Sure, I don't think there was any misunderstanding here. Before you
replied I'd already meant to ask if anyone knew the corresponding R
packages we could check our implementations again.

(This also makes me think - we should expose these graduated renderer
classification techniques via processing)

Most of the time, I'm either using standard classifications like
the ones provides in "classInt", "BAMMtools" or the standard quartile,
kmeans stuff. Hierarchical clustering etc. needs some more thought
anyways (f.e. different similarity matrixes etc.).

But those might not be needed for cartography. By integrating stuff
through processing, this might open a brand new world for some
geostatistical guys of course.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] What to do about incorrect SAGA algorithms?
Message-ID: <CAB28Asi+abQTOLMpodt8moCmjtQeAP_ZMbNXYuTP=ugWKPEe3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Just raising the discussion about what we should do with SAGA
Processing algorithms when the results generated by SAGA are known to
be incorrect (i.e. there's a bug in SAGA itself).

Specifically, the SAGA difference and symmetric difference algorithms
generate incorrect results. See https://issues.qgis.org/issues/21354,
and the results from
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/tests/testdata/saga_algorithm_tests.yaml#L318
. This seems to be a general problem with the algorithms, not isolated
to particular input data.

My gut feeling is: we should "deprecate" these algorithms (which means
they continue to work for existing models, but are hidden from the UI
and cannot be run from the toolbox or added to new models). I don't
see the value in exposing broken algorithms when we have robust
alternatives (the native QGIS difference/symmetric difference
algorithms are very fast, stable, and well tested), and potentially a
lot of harm.

Thoughts?

Nyall

Hi Nyall,

Thanks for the answer.

To work around the issue, I have to provide a default value.

In the case of a QgsProcessingParameterMatrix with fixed rows number has 
a default value have to be provided by the definition or the class ?

R quantile gives the same result of QGIS with this dataset.

thanks for raising this. I fully agree, and will push things a bit
further: IMHO we should hide all algs from other backends when we have a
robust alternative. This means qgis core alg should:
* cover the full range of options available in the alternative command
(often e.g. GRASS has a number of options that can be useful in special
cases)
* be robust even for huge data sets (e.g. GRASS is usually conservative
in the use of memory, and can complete analyses even when other algs fail)

* life is not perfect, so I think a power user should have the
possibility of using other algs, in case we overlooked a special option,
on temporarily if our alg is broken.

I therefore suggest to:
1. have a list of the potentially duplicated algs
2. find one or more volunteers checking thoroughly the above
3. hiding those who correspond to the criteria
4. design a last resort way of using hidden algs.
I'm available for 2.
All the best.

add some kind of warning (for the tools we know can have issue), do not
remove, please. After all we never removed (nor deprecated) the native QGIS
tools when we knew (sometimes since long)  that they were spitting very
wrong results...

just my 2 cents

Hi Nyall,

I think this rises another problem, that is the use of a very old version
of SAGA (2.3.2) in QGIS.

I've just tested Difference algorithm with Lene dataset in native SAGA
2.3.2 and 7.2.0, and 2.3.2 gives the problem described, but 7.2.0 gives the
correct result:

https://cld.pt/dl/download/2dfb0db5-eb74-4396-ad18-7451fd1fe788/test_saga_232.jpg

https://cld.pt/dl/download/92182907-d37a-4441-891c-3c85064b3100/test_saga_720.jpg

So, we are faced again with the question of keep an old version of SAGA in
QGIS core, or make it as an external plugin, with someone keeping an eye in
the changes introduced by SAGA team between versions (as we saw in the
past).

Alexander Bruy had made an effort to keep a parallel SAGA plugin that
support newer SAGA versions: https://plugins.bruy.me/processing-saga.html
But it is not in the official repository. Maybe this is the time to discuss
again the use of SAGA as an external plugin?

Best regards,
Pedro Ven√¢ncio

Message-ID: <59e012b2-1d65-13be-59e5-2d5f9855effc@gis3w.it>

Hi list,

On my laptop I have QGIS-server at version 1:3.4.4+24xenial-ubuntugis-1.

The parameter LAYERFONTCOLOR / ITEMFONTCOLOR¬† it'd be not work, I try 
with hex color mode but also withe clear color name like 'white' or 'red'.

Is a possibile bug or I did in wrong way, following a example url:

SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetLegendGraphic&SLD_VERSION=1.3.0&WIDTH=300&FORMAT=image/png&TRANSPARENT=true&ITEMFONTCOLOR=%23FF0000&LAYERTITLE=true&ITEMFONTSIZE=8&BOXSPACE=10&LAYERSPACE=4&LAYERTITLESPACE=4&ICONLABELSPACE=2&SYMBOLWIDTH=8&SYMBOLHEIGHT=4&&LAYER=Branches,Losses,Valves,Sources,OutLets,InLets,Checkvalves,Controllers,Boundaries

If it's a bug I'll open a issue.

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

I've used the OSGeo4W setup to install PyQt5 and then ran:
import PyQt5.QtCore
from a python shell (OSGeo4W.bat with qt5_env, py3_env inside)
I'm getting the following error:

>>> import PyQt5.QtCore
Traceback (most recent call last):

>>>

Running the same command in a QGIS python shell works fine (same batch file)
Please advise.

Kind regards,

You probably need to run:

py3_env.bat
qt5_env.bat

first. The osgeo4w command line defaults to python2/Qt4 compatibility
if you don't run those commands.

What about just creating an empty table with the required number of
rows in QgsProcessingMatrixParameterDialog::populateTable whenever
mParam has a fixed number of rows set?

Thanks for the report, I'm forwarding to the Ubuntugis list and QGIS
Developers list, the 2 groups that manage these things.

I believe I have this combo working on a machine, will need to check.

Looking at the repos, I see new version of packages went up 10 hours
ago. It is possible the QGIS release on qgis.org ubuntugis repo needs to
be rebuilt against these new packages, which usually happens within 24
hours.

Thanks,
Alex

This is really frustrating -- I wonder if someone with links to the
SAGA project could approach them again and gently ask them to consider
a new LTR release? Unfortunately until they do make a new LTR, users
on our Windows installation and through the larger linux distros are
stuck with the 2.3 release. I don't believe either the windows nor
debian/ubuntu/fedora packaging team have any intention of moving to
non-ltr releases.

So -- my new proposal would be:

1. Leave the inbuilt support at LTR only. Deprecate all known broken
algorithms to avoid user error and frustration.
2. Copy the saga provider to a NEW "saga-next gen" plugin based
provider, which targets the current SAGA v7 .2 release ONLY. This
would be a community-maintained plugin (although, as a once off
goodwill gesture I'm willing to do the initial plugin setup and host
it on a North Road github repo). This plugin could be installed
alongside the inbuilt SAGA LTR provider without issue, but it would
NOT be included in a default QGIS install and users would have to
manually install it via the plugin installer.

I think this approach is the best solution when could get given the
constraints we are working around.

See above for my new proposal. But I'm not convinced by this argument
at all -- it's basically saying "let's accept bugs (and the user data
corruption and frustration which result from them) because we once had
other bugs so it's fair". I understand the background you're coming
from, but we should all move on from the bugginess of 2.18 and just be
happy that 3.x is a MUCH better processing experience all round, and
continue to make it even better by fixing/hiding/removing tools which
give incorrect results.

Here's an (experimental) working version:
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/processing_saga_nextgen/

Seems to be working ok for the couple of algorithms I've run it with,
but definitely experimental only for now ;)

The qgis.org packages in the non-nightly repo are built on release and packages
and are not automatically rebuilt when dependencies changed - see the
note on 

https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu

that also lists a couple of options to deal with this.

And here's a PR hiding algorithms with known issues from the toolbox by default:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9378

>From the PR:
"By default, hide algorithms with known issues from toolbox and add a
Processing setting to allow these to be shown.
When shown, they are highlighted in red with a tooltip explaining that
the algorithm has known issues.
To be used whenever an algorithm has serious known issues which make
it dangerous to use, and where
we CANNOT fix the underlying issues (e.g. due to issues in 3rd party
dependencies)"

This would be the best approach, but thinking about 2.3.2, in fact, it does
not worked as a really LTR, because if I remeber well, it never received
any minor fix. That is, 2.3.2 was the LTR version, and never had any fix in
this two years.

So, I don't know if we have any benifit of wait for a new LTR, over just
choose any newer SAGA version and work with it. 'We' here necessarely
includes Linux packagers and OSGeo4W.

Thoughts?

Best regards,
Pedro

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Error Message When Packaging Application for Win7
Message-ID: <1E73D199D8563A4E867597F990887AF035B1F027@PLYEXM05.customer.edfenergy.net>

Good afternoon all

My apologies but I am unsure which mailing list is the appropriate one to use.

Our support team are trying to package QGIS 3.4.4 'Madeira' for Win7 and Win10 for deployment, however they are facing an issue with the Win7 extraction.

Extraction issues faced on win7:
1.extract:error writing to file gdal203.dll
2. extract:error writing to file vcredist-2013-x64.exe

[cid:image003.png at 01D4CE75.4D1E3DB0]

Would anyone be able to provide any advice on what might be causing this error?

Many thanks

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Any gotchas related to working with QgsVectorLayer
	inside a QgsTask?
Message-ID: <PS1PR03MB360782CF14A9D45C4FA621E2A1720@PS1PR03MB3607.apcprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hello Team,

I know that the UI must not be updated from the QgsTask.run() method. Are there any similar restrictions on loading QgsVectorLayer from a file or creating new layers from QgsTask.run() ?

I find that some operations on a GPKG layer do not work as expected when run from a QgsTask.
These operations work fine when they are done from a foreground thread.

Example:

class MyTask(QgsTask)
...
def run(self):
   self.layer = QgsVectorLayer("geom.gpkg", "test_geom", "ogr")

def finished(self, res):
   if self.layer.isValid():
       QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(self.layer)    # Layer loads, but attribute table is not editable

--------------------------
On the other hand, the following works just as expected. The attribute table is editable.

layer = QgsVectorLayer("geom.gpkg", "test_geom", "ogr")
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(layer)   # Layer loads and attribute table is editable.

What are the best practices for working with a QgsVectorLayer from within a QgsTask?

Regards,
Tej

ummm... no, I really didn't meant that. What I was thinking was that SAGA
served us well (and will still serve) when we could not really rely on some
QGIS native tools (that lead to data corruption/wrong results and user
frustration). Also thinking about moving on to newer (bug free) releases I
didn't liked the idea to see tools disappear from Processing even if we
have very good native tools now. Anyway this is now an already obsolete
consideration, the solution you already implemented is good to me.

I genuinely do not understand what you mean :)

Message-ID: <f94128de-e005-4305-c58a-ad9a3528a9ba@salzburgresearch.at>

Hi all,

I have a question concerning the line_substring and recently updated 
$length expressions. I have a linestring (EPSG:4326) and a relative 
start- and end-offset (in %) and I want to create the sub linestring. 
The start- and end distances at the line_substring expression should be 
set in projection units (e.g. degrees in EPSG:4326). With the previous 
behaviour of $length, I multiplied the relative offset (in %) with the 
(planimetric) length to calculate those distances. See the following 
example:

geom_to_wkt(line_substring( geom_from_wkt('LINESTRING(13 46, 15 46)'),¬† 
0.4* $length, 0.6* $length))¬† // $length => 2.0

results in

LINESTRING(13.8 46, 14.2 46)

With the latest release (3.6.0-1 und 3.4.5-1), the $length expression 
correctly calculates the ellipsoidal length 
(https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19355) and I cannot use the above 
expression. Is there a way to use relative distances in the 
line_substring function? Or is there an alternative to calculate the 
planimetric length (without implementing my own function)?

Thanks for your help

Simon

(Sorry, maybe the wrong list, but QGIS user didn't get an answer, so I try here)



Hello, everybody,



when I use mass text with different markups (font attributes) over HTML text, kerning errors occur especially with small but necessary font sizes, i.e. the spacing becomes incorrect. The screenshot [1] should illustrate this. It is simple HTML (on the right). The errors occur equally in QGIS 2.14 and 3.2. Does anyone have an idea or a workaround?  What other possibilities are there for mass text with different attributes?



Here is my Test-HTML:



<span style='font-size:7pt;font-weight: bold;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'>August-Hermann-Francke</br></span>

<span style='font-size:7pt;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'><b>August-Hermann-Francke</b></br></span>

<span style='font-size:7pt;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'><strong>August-Hermann-Francke</strong></br></span>

<span style='font-size:7pt;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'>August-Hermann-Francke<br></span>



<span style='font-size:14pt;font-weight: bold;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'>August-Hermann-Francke</br></span>

<span style='font-size:14pt;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'>August-Hermann-Francke<br></span>

Message-ID: <aef862ae-59ff-bf52-c1a4-983e2c7dddf3@posteo.de>

Hi,

using QgsPointClusterRenderer() as renderer is working fine, but i can't
style it.

The old renderers are having arguments like "symbol"

symbol = QgsSymbol.defaultSymbol(pgLayer.geometryType())
symbol.setColor(QtGui.QColor.fromRgb(255,0,0))
symbol.setSize(4)

pgRenderer = pgLayer.setRenderer(QgsSingleSymbolRenderer(symbol))

and that is still running.

But the new renderers like PointCluster don't. There must be another way
(methods?) to configure that.

pgRenderer2 = pgLayer.setRenderer(QgsPointClusterRenderer())¬†

pgRenderer2.setClusterSymbol(symbol)¬† # gives errors.

Searched for hours but can't solve that.

regards
walter

Is it that the symbol you set has to be a QgsMarkerSymbol, not just a

Hi Nyall,

Thanks for this new plugin. It would be nice, if we could use this
plugin for SAGA GIS >= 7.2., because some of us use SAGA GIS 7.3.0
(devel version).

Many thanks in advance and best wishes,
Rainer Hurling

Hi QGIS Developers,

I'm  following up on this issue which I posted last month. While it triggered  a lot of discussion I never received a firm answer as to whether my PAT plugin could be hosted and made discoverable as a QGIS plugin on the official plugins site.

About a week ago I uploaded a new version of PAT for some bug fixes, and it remains unapproved. Is this likely to get approved so users can find and install it via the plugin manager?

I was interested to see that PAT v0.1.0 has now had 131 downloads directly from the QGIS repository so there is definitely an interest.  Currently version 0.1.0 is showing on the website as being approved, but when I search for it in using the QGIS plugin manager, I can't find it, even with the experimental option ticked on. Is there a reason for this?
Kind Regards,

Christina

Hey  Christina,

Yeah, it's a bit odd it's not showing up at all in the XML output.  I
wonder if it was the HTML in the changelog as I can't see anything else
that is different.  I have edit the changelog and removed the HTML to see
if that picks it up.

Edited the changelog on this version for now to test that theory:
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/pat/version/0.1.0/

Good point! Can you file a bug ticket on the plugin page and I'll look
into this. Should be a matter of just removing the == part of the
check and replace with a >= part.

Yes -- the "length(...)" function always gives a purely Cartesian
length for a geometry. Using "length($geometry)" should give you what
you want.

Some. For a start, you CAN'T utilise a map layer (or its data
provider) created in the main thread in a background thread safely.
(This applies to all layer methods, not just edits/etc). But if you
create a NEW layer within a thread, you should be fine to utilise that
layer WITHIN that thread.

Now - the complexity comes if you want to "hand back" that layer to
the main thread when you're done with using it in the task (e.g. to
add to the QgsProject, which belongs in the main thread). You need to
first push the layer from the background thread into the main thread,
and then when you're back in the main thread you can take this layer
and add it to your project. Something like:

from background thread:

layer.pushToThread( QCoreApplication.thread() )
# don't do ANYTHING else with this layer in the background thread now!


when back in main thread:
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(layer)
...

Note that this same principal applies to all QObject subclasses, and
that you CANNOT "pull" an object from a different thread to the
current thread (i.e. you can PUSH from the current thread to another
thread, but you MUST be within that thread. You can't just snatch an
object from a different thread and try to push it to the current
thread).

Hi Nathan,

I‚Äôve just checked and still can‚Äôt see it.  I also removed the html for the about tab as well and that hasn‚Äôt worked either.

I have noticed that for other plugins version tab shows External dependencies is None, and Experimental is either Yes or No. ( ie https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/processing_r/version/1.0.5/)

For PAT External dependencies is  Yes and Experimental is blank.

Could this be the issue?

Cheers,
Christina

About a week ago I uploaded a new version of PAT for some bug fixes, and it remains unapproved. Is this likely to get approved so users can find and install it via the plugin manager?

I was interested to see that PAT v0.1.0 has now had 131 downloads directly from the QGIS repository so there is definitely an interest.  Currently version 0.1.0 is showing on the website as being approved, but when I search for it in using the QGIS plugin manager, I can‚Äôt find it, even with the experimental option ticked on. Is there a reason for this?

What I was thinking was that SAGA served us well (and will still serve) when we could not really rely on some QGIS native tools (that lead to data corruption/wrong results and user frustration). Also thinking about moving on to newer (bug free) releases I didn't liked the idea to see tools disappear from Processing even if we have very good native tools now. Anyway this is now an already obsolete consideration, the solution you already implemented is good to me.

Great, I think it's a fair compromise.

What I meant was just that I acknowledge that we've had issues in the
past, and understand that we do have work to do to "regain" trust in
these native algorithms.

Looking for developer to look into a QGIS WFS 2 problem.
I have a question from users In Denmark to get in contact with a developer to look into a problem with QGIS WFS 2.

Several users has encountered delays in QGIS WFS 2 and errors for WFST transactions against Geoserver.
Andrea Aimee from Geosolution has debugged in Geoserver and was able to observe the delays - but not find any errors on the Geoserver side.

Does any of the developers has possibilities to look into this subject from the perspective of a Windows user. If yes please write to me ‚Äì and I¬¥ll forward information.

Alessandro reported multiple issues in the WFS client a few days ago, the
WFS client at this moment seems pretty much half broken on 3.4 and above

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Python Editor locale settings!?
Message-ID: <0bb8c04f-6ad9-72f9-a413-8a495eb32154@gmail.com>

Hi,

while testing a script on 2 different machines we discovered something
very strange. First machine has QGIS in English the second in Italian.

Results of the scripts are different because of decimal separator (. in
English, , in Italian).

The console interprets the stuff correctly, the editor not. Is this
really the expected behavior?

QGIS 3.6

Cheers

Matteo

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-f1D_0HYK2bOd0iKuv1L6z6LPnfmwf7O82PDiMRePwaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

Is there any premade vagrant file I can use for the QGIS-Django project
that already has everything set up?

If not I can make one as I run Windows most of the time and I would like to
have something set up I can just run up and shutdown nicely to match what
we have running on https://plugins.qgis.org without having to install
anything local on my windows machine.

Keen to see if others with more experience have done work in this area
before so I don't have to reinvent it, but happy to do it if other haven't.

Regards,
Nathan

Dear all,

Does anyone have any plans for making a plugin for the LiDAR tools included in FUSION/LDV for QGIS3?

This was available in QGIS2 but has not been migrated to QGIS3.

Hi 


Vagrant is so 2000s :-p Everything runs in docker. We have it in a a private docker hub repo as image contains a working db snapshot too..

Richard is the gate keeper for getting access to the hub repo after which you should be able to do:


docker login
docker run -ti -p 8099:80 \
        -d --restart=unless-stopped \
        --name="plugins" \
        -v ${PWD}/static:/home/plugins/QGIS-Django/qgis-app/static \
        -v ${PWD}/backups:/backups \
        -v ${PWD}/tmp:/tmp \
        -v ${PWD}/logs:/var/log/nginx \
        qgis/plugins:latest \
        supervisord -n

The volume mounts are not strictly necessary - we store teh actual plugin packages in a host directory instead of the container.

Regards

Tim

haha yes I know but for some reason I can't get docker to run well on
Windows at the moment for me, so I will just run it inside a vagrant box
because it's turtles all the way down.

Richard,  could I get some details on how to set this up?

Hi Frederik,
the lidar tools provided in qgis 2.x has been splitted into lastools and fusion/ldv.
If the first has a maintainer, the second unfortunately doesn‚Äôt; one year ago, a core dev told me that it‚Äôs not in the plans. I wrote some of the scripts for the 2.x version but I‚Äôm not a programmer and I have no idea how to migrate the whole thing.
If you know how or you know someone who knows how to do it, I think it‚Äôs just a matter of asking for the access to the repository.

HTH,

Nic

Hi Gents,

Nathan, other then the Github repo and trying to run the available
docker I do not have so much superpowers (other then I could get into
the container for you and get the stuff out).

What we were discussing during this hackfest (after some issues with
availability of plugins.qgis.org) is to actually get a dedicated server
for plugins.qgis.org.
And because (we think) more people could maybe develop/look into the
Django app we think about just deploy it as a wgsi-app working with a
local Postgresql db (so no more docker). Maybe on a cloud server, so
creating snapshots will then give us easy backups.

This would hopefully open the door for other people to dive into the
QGIS-Django app, for example to upgrade it to work with python3 and a
newer version of Django (we now get a 'moderate' security warning on
github [0])

We have to discuss this further.

Regards,

Richard

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Status update of QGIS server OGC certification
Message-ID: <CABgOYCfN1vhVzAgWdtfWLNtnd4Da4HiVMf1+PToEOJssbUWYPA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
This is a short report of the current status of OGC certification renewal.
As you know , OGC is asking to renew certification every year so there is a
bit of administrative burden and we received email from the OGC as we have
60 days now to renew our certification.

I updated the wiki page [0] to reflect the nice process :)

I started the certification process for QGIS LTR 3.4 today during the
hackfest. It currently fails - though it works in our own infrastructure.
Paul is going to have a look at it, it is probably a small with
OnlineResource url issue.  I'll inform you when the process succeeds.

Best regards
r√©gis

For those who jump into the topic,  record, we have now that
infrastructure:

- a test suite tool [1], that should probably be moved to QGIS github
repository
- a continuous testing integration sending reports to [2].
- When necessary, reference servers hosted at qgis4.qgis.org.

@Richard we have a private repo *docker hub* repo that I think you are the owner of in the qgis organisation in docker hub. In that repo we have pushed occasional full image snapshots of everything in the plugins website except the actual plugin packages. Its this that I was asking you to give Nathan access to.

:-( I prefer to properly set it up as a set of docker containers. Then spinning up an instance is a few clicks, we can load balance and other nice things in the future. We have all the tooling to do it with a repeatable workflow.  Anyway I guess it comes down to the person who will actually maintain things. Currently I guess it is me and you doing the sysadmin Richard and Ale maintaining the code. If we get more volunteers who want to maintain things and that want to use a particular implementation approach, using their preferred approach is fine for me.

I think you are conflating two things here: deployment and development. We can already easily run a local non docker version e.g. for development (see notes in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/blob/master/readme.rst - maybe they need a refresh?) so the current deployment approach should not be a blocker for developers to get on board. Maybe we just need to review the manual setup and run process notes to make sure the process is still described properly.

But why not start by just deploying on a cloud server the existing image. I already get backups of the plugin zips and we can just add one small container to make PG backups on a cron. That would be the minimal amount of work to shift it to a new dedicated host.

Yes upgrading would be nice

Message-ID: <CAJEy1xWQ=3+mqpU5UEsJnKh4U8yf+dtudkjEvX3M+EwhOXShsw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello devs,

I know many of you are now on hackfest in A Coru√±a. I hope you have a great
and inspiring time:)

I would need little help from you. One of my student has a problem with
QGIS on Windows. After the last QGIS shutdown Windows got an error message
(see below) and he can not run QGIS from this moment. He attempted to
reinstall it, we also tried to use this tip
<https://anitagraser.com/2016/03/26/how-to-fix-the-windows-config-for-qgs-default-program/>
and this
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/240159/qgis-2-18-the-program-cant-start-because-qgis-app-dll-is-missing-from-your-com/247194>,
but nothing worked. It still does not complete the installation and will
not create icons on the desktop nor in the start menu. He tried to install
different qgis versions (3.6, 3.4, 2.18, 2.18, 2.14). It worked only for
version 1.xx.
PC parameters: Acer Nitro 5, OS Windows 10 Home 64bit, 8 GB RAM, Intel Core
i5-8300H 2.30 GHz, GeForce GTX 1050 4GB.

Thanks in advance for any help!

Best regards
Jana

	plugins details
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=oghU3U9SAseQYZM_d7B_QibstG4VC-REDM4u2YVPMhqA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

While applying a couple of commits to QGIS' plugin manager, I would like to
fix a long-standing UX issue with it, namely that plugins that show a newer
version available do _not_ show the latest changelog but rather the
changelog of the currently installed plugin version.

It'd much nicer, and exciting for users, to show what's new _prior to_
hitting the [ update plugin ] button.

For that to happen, we'd need either: a/ add the changelog information in
the repository XML file fetched (i.e.
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.6), or b/ add a method
to fetch changelog strings from the repository site (for e.g.,
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/changelog.xml?names=plugin1,plugin2,plugin3
).

Unless adding the short changelog to the repository XML adds too many MBs,
I'd vote for option A.

Thoughts?

Mathieu

+1 that would be really great! The current behavior doesn't make much sense.

I like the idea, I'm just worried about the increased size of the XML on
option A: we don't have any control over the changelog size (well, we could
truncate the changelog if it's too long but I don't know if that makes much
sense).

If it's not too much trouble for whomever manages the plugins site, it
might be worth simply adding the changelog bit to plugins.xml and see the
size difference then.

I was initially worried but the more I think about it the more I get a
feeling it should be just fine.

Message-ID: <3a15e87cf1d7d320867910271fcad3dc@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
tickets are being automatically closed as end of life even if already 
veruified against 3.0. I did a big job in testing many of them if not 
all in Madeira HF and mark as 3.0 or (at that time) master.
Please revert the change, as this will make lots of valid tickets 
disappear and will upset reporters.
Thanks.

No trouble at all,
just 7/8 tickets were wrongly closed by mistake (among hundreds closed as
agreed), and by chance they almost all belonged to you and I immediately
reopened them. Next time just ask.

Dear Con,

We are currently looking into porting it to QGIS core.

It would be available in 3.8 if the plan remains.

Best wishes

Hi all,
our way back from the meeting, we realized that once the welcome page is
in place, it would be good to add the possibility for the user to add
RSS feeds, and add in the background the GRIB of the weather forecast,
so we'll effectively have a QGIS News, replacing the old TV.
I find this rather funny, I hope I'm not the only one.
Cheers.

Really looking forward to having a welcome page that enables us to display
official QGIS messages in a way that will reach users.

The other ideas sound like fun, as long as they are optional since it may
not be in the interest of all users to use bandwidth to download weather
data.

Anita

Hi all,
agreed with Anita here. Let's first make a simple opt-out rss feed that
allows us to reach more users when communicating. Why not sometimes put
some fun in the rss feed there, something like a "QGIS project weather
forecast" sometimes?  We can add gif in the rss feed I think. Matthias, do
you confirms the QGIS's rss client would be able to display rss images?

BTW Anita, I created a dedicated tag named "QGIS Homepage" in the wordpress
admin backoffice.
At the meeting, I offered to coordinate the content of this feed, any help
welcome.  So I think this will be more a matter of discussing blog article
content and trying to make it alive and put the tag on article we want to
promote to QGIS homepage.
Best regards!

I am working a project with mask plugin and print composer atlas. It worked
in QGIS 2.18 ltr. But not now when I am using QGIS 3.4 it doesnt work. When
I click to the next feature in print atlas the masking is gone.
 I guess there is a little bit of a problem. I hope it will solve soon.
Since the mask plugin is very important for best visualization of output.

Qgis has just vanished from my machine and I've no idea why? I tried to do
a re-install and I keep getting:

E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Any ideas on what is going on here? I am on ubuntu 18.04

Hi Shane,

Your question is not related with QGIS development. You should post it
to QGIS-user list. On that list you mighty have better support.

QGIS did not vanish. It does not install because you have broken
packages, right? You have to fix that before installing QGIS or any
other application.

Please google: ubuntu broken packages

Usually that can be solved simple by doing: sudo apt install -f

Check the repository you are using. It should be:

deb https://qgis.org/ubuntu bionic main
deb-src https://qgis.org/ubuntu bionic main

Fix the broken packages, check the repository you are using and report back.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Agreed, this is undefined, and people use it in different ways, leading
to uncertainties both on the developer and the user sides.
Any suggestion for the best option?
Thanks.

I think we should add some new metadata with a standard format for each
version. Something like this


[changelog]

1.0.6=something something dark side even more
          some other things
          and other things
1.0.5=something something dark side
1.0=First version of the dark side really

That can be taken and turned into the full changelog or parsed into a
version based one.

The other option is to use some kind of naming convention in the already
there changelog tag but might be hard for multiline notes.

It was not humour; it's a requirement and I think PSC should deliberate on
this (especially a single 'YES' vote makes it approved).

Hi

I was wondering if we could beautify the changelog a bit too.

What I would love to see are titles, sections and maybe images.

Potentially it could be written in markdown and a project like the
following used to render:

Could we take it a step at a time and proceed with adding the changelog bit
to the plugin.xml file first? The fixed UX will probably provide additional
motivation for authors.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS plugin qgisMinimumVersion
Message-ID: <d60a0acb-c948-38df-0849-e214870bb887@nmbu.no>

I just experienced a problem with a plugin.
The plugin uses the optional "is_child_algorithm" parameter of
the processing.run function.  That parameter was introduced in
3.4.5 (LTR).

I therefore set "qgisMinimumVersion=3.4.5" in the plugin's
metadata.txt.
It turned out that this caused the plugin not to be available for
the current LTR, probably because "Parameters" is set to
"?qgis=3.4" in the Plugin manager in 3.4.5.

Changing to "qgisMinimumVersion=3.4", makes the plugin show in
the plugin manager, but that also makes it available in 3.4.4
and earlier 3.4 versions (where it will fail with an unexpected
keyword argument for processing.run...).

Could "micro" version be included in the Plugin manager
"Parameters", or is this something that will have to be handled
in the plugin code?

I've had a request for Lat Lon Tools to support Google Earth with its "Show

the following calls.

os.startfile('path to kml file')
webbrowser.open('path to kml file')

For the Linux and Mac users, do these work and which is preferable? They
both work on Windows.

The reason the plugin manager sends just "?qgis=3.4" was because the point 
releases ("micro" versions) are expected to only provide bugfixes and not new 
features. After some thinking, I guess this approach is wrong and a bug is 
also a reason to prevent the plugin from installing. It's easy to change it in  
master, I'm not sure if it we should do it in a point release of the LTR...

Another place to change would be the repository, as it also cuts off the point 
release part. For example, the OpenLayers Plugin has minimumQgisVersion=3.0.1 
and is visible here:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.1
but not here:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.0.2

Borys

Nyall, thanks for the tip.

Doing a

self.layer.moveToThread(QCoreApplication.instance().thread())

as the last step in QgsTask.run() worked for me.

Regards,
Tej

Some. For a start, you CAN'T utilise a map layer (or its data
provider) created in the main thread in a background thread safely.
(This applies to all layer methods, not just edits/etc). But if you
create a NEW layer within a thread, you should be fine to utilise that
layer WITHIN that thread.

Now - the complexity comes if you want to "hand back" that layer to
the main thread when you're done with using it in the task (e.g. to
add to the QgsProject, which belongs in the main thread). You need to
first push the layer from the background thread into the main thread,
and then when you're back in the main thread you can take this layer
and add it to your project. Something like:

from background thread:

layer.pushToThread( QCoreApplication.thread() )
# don't do ANYTHING else with this layer in the background thread now!


when back in main thread:
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(layer)
...

Note that this same principal applies to all QObject subclasses, and
that you CANNOT "pull" an object from a different thread to the
current thread (i.e. you can PUSH from the current thread to another
thread, but you MUST be within that thread. You can't just snatch an
object from a different thread and try to push it to the current
thread).

Message-ID: <a76732d3-00a5-06c7-2ef2-7020217ec36b@duif.net>

Hi,

In top of my layerlist in my current profile, I have a this red __MACOSX
item (see screenshot). FYI I do not own/run a mac :-)

So I think that this comes with some other plugin when I install it?

Though I also thought: but this only the list based on the xml so had a
look too:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.7

But that one does not show it. So I think that one or more of the
plugins 'install' it?
Do others also have this?

Another solution could be I add a __DEBIAN on top :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I confirm, I also get it sometimes, but I could not track it down, since
I install and uninstall many plugins.
I agree it would be nice to get rid of it.
Thanks for noticing.

Hi C,
not sure how to test this but I (Debian) created a simple kml file in
/tmp/test.kml and then tried your calls:

import os
os.startfile('/tmp/test.kml')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.7/code.py", line 90, in runcode
    exec(code, self.locals)
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: module 'os' has no attribute 'startfile'

import webbrowser
webbrowser.open('/tmp/test.kml')
True

Opens this test.kml but off course trying to open it in browser

HTH & regards

It says (see screenie): "This plugin is broken"

I'll go over my plugins to see if I see it somewhere, I think it is part
of one the zips...

Maybe check for it in our Django app?

Hi,
I have had this __MACOSX folder in the plugin for several times in the
past. It came from plugin zip files which contained this folder.
It seems that this (in MacOS hidden) folder gets included in the zipfile
when you use the MacOS Finder to zip folders:
https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/288568
I always just deleted the folder and restarted qgis.

regards,
Thomas

Richard,

Thanks for testing this. I was afraid there might be some OS dependencies
with this. Do you have Google Earth installed on your Debian machine? Is
there a proper way to send a KML to a Linux Google Earth from python?

Greetings everyone,

Some travis tests tend to timeout quite often for no reasons, I was
wondering if it would be a good idea to ignore timeout (in general or on
those tests) to ensure that there are less false negatives.

Would this be a good idea?

No, GE is a pita to set up in Debian. Maybe on ubuntu? Others?

os.startfile seems indeed Windows only:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html

To start an application on Linux, maybe start it as an command (given de
exe name?) with subprocess?

There was a GEarthView plugin in 2.18:
https://github.com/geodrinx/gearthview/
Not sure if that send info to GE though.

I've found a plugin I install sometimes which indeed has 2 topfolders in
the zip, one is __MACOSX.
As I have access to the directory with all plugin zips on
plugins.qgis.org, I should be able to search through them and find all
zips... (and maybe also the mail address zo we can tell people).
BUT not tonight..

This sounds sensible - those folders are so prevalent amongst mac
users that I think any one-off fixes will be very short term.

Actually it's two tests in particular. They've long been annoying
everyone with their constant failures. So I'm disabling them:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9483

FWIW - I think they are revealing real issues.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Flaky tests and Travis
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgCz5QDiv3OwKLnANOJU6JuOZs5GtxmZdUVkGv7y1JruQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

For a long time now we've been plagued by intermittently failing tests
on Travis, which are making the whole QGIS development experience
quite painful.

I propose that we take an absolute hard line approach from now and
disable all tests which are causing false positive failures. I've
started here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9483

This is obviously not ideal, as the failures may be revealing real
bugs (and in the case of the two disabled above I believe they are
symptoms of the same underlying bug), but I think now we've passed the
point where leaving these tests enabled causes more damage then
skipping them.

Ideally someone would investigate these and fix either the tests or
the underlying bugs... but it hasn't happened in 6+ months, so I don't
expect that to happen shortly**. I did spend some time around a month
ago to see if the fix for these two was trivial, but could not find it
quickly.

Is anyone opposed to a hard-line "disable if flaky" stance?

Nyall

** For full disclosure: next round of QGIS grants I plan on filing for
a grant to investigate all tests disabled on Travis in depth and
either fix underlying bugs or make the tests more stable. But that's
grant dependant, and not a short term solution.

I am also in favor of disabling them but maybe keep them running and have
them as expected failure?
If ones write some code related to the corresponding tests , they might
still provide some valuable info.
Is this possible?

If not I'd still be in favor of disabling them.

Cheers

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Anyone noticed odd network behaviour while QGIS is
	loaded?
Message-ID: <CAB28AshVdzRH6M2mk+zx=RwajCyXUFdfhbAh1t5NLTU4TER9hg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I came across this thread recently
https://www.reddit.com/r/krita/comments/9xea9b/this_is_gonna_sound_crazy_but_is_krita/
, where someone reports that having Krita open was causing their wifi
connection to regularly drop out.

Long story short, it looks like this is caused by default network
scanning behaviour in the Qt library, so in theory QGIS should also be
affected by this. The typical symptom is that network ping latencies
will jump every 10 seconds while a Qt app is running.

I personally couldn't reproduce this, but the issue seems so
widespread (google for "QT_BEARER_POLL_TIMEOUT") that I'd be surprised
if QGIS wasn't affected too.

So my questions are:

1. Has anyone noticed this?
2. Should we just go ahead and apply the workaround which other Qt
applications are doing and set the environment variable
QT_BEARER_POLL_TIMEOUT=-1 by default? The side effect of this change
is that Qt's network polling would be completely disabled, so e.g.
changing from wifi to wireless while a QGIS session is open could
result in that session being unable to connect to the network
(requiring a QGIS restart)

That sounds preferable -- but I'm not (personally) sure if it's
possible. You know the CI setup better than I do, can you see a way to
do this?

> If not I'd still be in favor of disabling them.

I honestly believe the harm in leaving these enabled (short term) is
outweighing the risk of disabling them. We are very likely pushing new
contributors away from our project with the current difficulties just
getting a PR to green.

There's also often API backported to stable releases, which impacts
this. (E.g. when an existing class or method has not been exposed to
the Python bindings, or when a cleaner API for achieving something is
added in a later release it's sometimes backported too)

Hi all, 
this would be welcomed. I check the git repo and ask to delete them when I spot them, but checking every zip manually it's a pain.
Anyone could take this? Better open a ticket and add a note to the how-to page for plugin uploaders.
Thanks.

I will, at least make the issue, but if we/I can get stuff working again
in a development environment I will have a look at it myself.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Raster Calculator troubles in Processing with
	pyqgis
Message-ID: <2fd458b2-8a35-810e-6cba-75e4cf4cbe2a@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm facing a really strange bug (IMHO). Same script, same project, same
data, same QGIS version (3.6), but different platform (linux vs windows).

The EXPRESSION parameter is giving errors when used, ONLY in Windows.

This is the small snippet I'm using without any problem in Linux:

param_calculated = {
	'EXPRESSION':'{}@1 * {}'.format(proximity['OUTPUT'], formula),
	'LAYERS': proximity['OUTPUT'],
	'OUTPUT': os.path.join(output, 'calcolato.tif')
}

calculated = processing.run("qgis:rastercalculator", param_calculated)

The exact same script is giving an error in Windows (not verbose error,
just saying processing.run is not running).

I discovered that, if I load the raster(s) into the TOC and user
my_raster.name() instead of the complete path (proximity['OUTPUT']) then
it seems working.

Is this a known bug/problem?

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Does either of the platforms have OpenCL support enabled?

Hi Paolo,

i wrote a python script to check the qgis 2.18 repository and found 28
plugins which contain a __macosx folder:

AzimuthDistanceCalculator.1.1.2.zip
GeoHealth.1.0.1.zip
irods_qgis.3.2.zip
QgisGeoJSONExportPlugin.0.2.0.zip
vTool.0.2.zip
GridZoneGenerator.1.3.zip
qgis-mongodb-loader.1.4.0.zip
qgis-amigocloud-plugin.0.6.2.zip
pandora.2.0.1.zip
Submission.0.4.zip
mole.0.998k.zip
EmergencyMapper.0.0.1.zip
JapanElevation.1.0.zip
ZebToolbox.0.3.1.zip
PointToPolygon.1.0.zip
pgChainage.1.1.0.zip
geohey_toolbox.0.3.zip
pdokbaggeocoder.0.6.4.zip
pyarchinit.0.1.6.1.zip
geobricks_qgis_plugin_trmm.0.2.zip
geobricks_qgis_plugin_world_bank.0.1.zip
geobricks_qgis_plugin_faostat.0.5.zip
qgisgbifapi.0.2.0.zip
HotspotAnalysis.0.5.zip
SleuthInputs.0.3.zip
PointToPolygon.0.6.zip
EasyTemplatePrint.0.1.zip
envifate.0.1.zip

In order to cause less traffic and have a better performance it would be
much better to run the script on the server where the plugin zipfiles are
located.

regards,
Thomas

I'm not sure this works.

Expected failure "expects" the tests to fail and will error if it
succeeds, since we are dealing with flaky tests here, that will still
lead to unstable behavior.

I agree with the proposal, these tests do more harm than good currently.

Thanks a lot!
Could you please open a ticket in each of them?
Surely running it on the website is far better. Even better would be to
include it in the upload procedure.
Could you please check with Alessandro, who wrote the plugin django app,
how best to do it?
Thanks again.

Hi Thomas,

If you provide me the script I will run it.

With me the OSMDownlader plugin added it. You can see it by going into
the folder on your disk. The folder contains all kind of file data (not
sure if it sensitive or not).

I created an issue:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/62

Maybe you can upload your script there?
ANd maybe a feature request :-)
Also list the email of the author so we can mass mail the current
__MACOSX uploaders :-)

Thanks for idea and work

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I understand we haven't much of a choice: +1 for disabling.

I wonder if there is a way to make it more evident for developers that they
need to run disabled tests locally by hand before making a PR.

It happened to me once or twice that I made a change that I knew was
covered by a test case, let travis run, all green, merge!

And then I discovered that the test I was relying on wasn't running on
Travis and that there was a test failure when running the test locally.

Dear leana

Please provide more information: screenshots, diagram of what you want to achieve, sample dataset and project. I don‚Äôt think anybody can reasonably motivated to answer your question based on the information provided thus far.

Thanks!

Another approach would be to have a tag in the PR such as enable_alltests
and it would run on all the tests. I am not sure we have access to labels
in Travis (we didn't have access to title a year ago), but that would be a
nice hack.

Could this be regarded as a bug in the plugin manager?
In that case it should be OK to fix it in a point release.

I'm afraid IMHO it's more a long-standing behavior consistent with the 
repository: the compatibility range limits are x.y. Moreover, it could be 
considered an API break for private repositories that parse that version 
number - and we're talking about the LTR version :/ 

Although I'm not sure if it's documented anywhere. If not, it could be the 
only argument...

In any case, it won't be effective unless changed in the repository as well, 
what is beyond my scope.

Halloo

Not aware of it, though haven't run with a ping to watch out for it. Is it
OS-dependent? All I wanted to say, though, is that our users do swap on and
off wifi a fair bit, so this could represent an issue in our case (we have
one major site which is wifi-only, while HQ offers wired with associated
higher speeds). I'm not aware of any other application we run which would
need a restart in order to see a change in network connection. Not sure what
others think?

Thanks

Tom

Hi Nic,

I got an estimate from a developer what the cost would be to port FUSION to QGIS3 (Around  1000-1500 Euros). I will now proceed to see if I can get funding for this from my organisation or from QGISSweden. If anyone else want to contribute, do not hesitate to contact me.


thanks,

Fredrik

√Ñmne: R: FUSION/LDV plugin for QGIS3


Hi Frederik,

the lidar tools provided in qgis 2.x has been splitted into lastools and fusion/ldv.

If the first has a maintainer, the second unfortunately doesn‚Äôt; one year ago, a core dev told me that it‚Äôs not in the plans. I wrote some of the scripts for the 2.x version but I‚Äôm not a programmer and I have no idea how to migrate the whole thing.

If you know how or you know someone who knows how to do it, I think it‚Äôs just a matter of asking for the access to the repository.



HTH,



Nic

Dear all,

Does anyone have any plans for making a plugin for the LiDAR tools included in FUSION/LDV for QGIS3?

This was available in QGIS2 but has not been migrated to QGIS3.


best wishes,

Fredrik

Hi Richard,

yes for QGIS3 the OSMDownloader is one of the plugins with macosx folder:

check for QGIS 3.4:
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
MapsPrinter.0.5.zip
AzimuthDistanceCalculator.2.0.zip
OSMDownloader.1.0.zip
MongoConnector.1.2.0.zip
Socrata.2.0.zip
natusferaqgis3.1.0.zip
FS3.1.0.1.zip
geohey_toolbox.0.4.zip
qgisgbifapi.0.3.0.zip
HotspotAnalysis.1.0.2.zip
SleuthInputs.3.0.zip
ecovaluator.2.0.zip
Hqgis.0.4.1.zip
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

I adapted my script so it works for walking through the filesystem instead
of crawling through the parsed repository xml:
It walks recursive through your main repository folder and checks each zip
file for the macosx folder:
https://gist.github.com/rdbath/7f617d4d3b3417fdb50ae9048e2056cc

Listing the emails of the authors is something I can't do at the moment as
they are not part of the repository xml, so I have no access to the email
adresses.

I guess it's better to directly contact the authors instead of opening one
issue for each plugin, especially as a part of the tracker-url's in the
repository is not up to date.
I will write a seperate email about this topic in a second.

regards,
Thomas

Message-ID: <CAD3koGnST9SG2vRr-TnJsRzZ-PvQa=Lo+36DMx27B0gAv4ouEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

In the last weeks I wanted to have a look at the repositories or bug
trackers of some qgis plugins and realised that the url's in the official
qgis-repository were not up to date.

So I wrote a script to check all plugins.

I found 165 errors for the qgis 2.18-plugins:

https://gist.github.com/rdbath/ad908b165f6d1e23e923b49896f4ef5f

This leads me again to the topic how to deal with unmaintained plugins:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/138

What do you think what's the best way to keep the repository up to date?

regards,
Thomas

Thanks a lot Thomas for this analysis.
Since apparently all the errors are for 2.18 plugins, I suggest leaving
everything as it is (most if not all are a known consequence of shutting
down hub.qgis.org). Things will sort themselves out as 2.18 support has
been dropped.
All the best.

In analigy with the other email, I would suggest to forget about 2.18,
and check only 3.*. I will deal with the list of plugins below.
Thanks.

Yes, QgsMarkerSymbol is better - but this does not solve my problem.

This will replace the predefined marker symbol by a new one, but without
any details. e.g the count is missing.

What i need is to *modify* the existing cluster marker symbol (color and
size).

Fortunately the default marker symbol color is Red and the size is
acceptable, but later i would like to add other cluster point layers
using different colors.

current state:

all done with pygis 101 :)

3.7 is the development edition. I don't know whether it builds nightly 
for Windows, but even with the Linux builds sometimes you don't get one 
every day, and it can be several days delay if a release is imminent.

Are you using Ubuntugis repository with Qgis. There can be issues if 
Ubuntugis updates its packages out of sequence with the Qgis release, 
because Ubuntugis is a separate project from Qgis and they don't 
synchronise releases.

I can confirm the same strange annoying behaviour using the latest QGIS ltr
3.4.5-1 (89ee6f6e23) and QGIS master 3.7.0-6 (d890084f63) on Windows 7 64
bit testing vector data-sets in various formats (shapefile, gml, geojson,
gpkg, spatialite).
It doesn't happen with QGIS 2.18.23.

This works for me only for memory layers.

Message-ID: <7cf40d09-53ef-2e27-84f2-155966627a03@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
if I drag6drop this raster:
https://www.faunalia.eu/~paolo/250010.tif
(no projection, it is indeed 3003) into a gpkg, loading it from there
slows down horribly QGIS, even if I reassign the proper projection
afterwards. Any clue? Could somebody confirm?
qgis 3.6, debian sid here.
Thanking in advance.

Hi all,
when a geopackage is opened in QGIS, even if no change is made, the file
is marked as changed. This can cause nightmares when syncing data,
because if two users open a gpkg without editing, it is hard to decide
what to do. Same for backups.
Is there a way to avoid this?
Thanks.

Paolo,

did you try to generate pyramids ? I assume the slowness you see is for zoom 
out views.

Yes this is a known inconvenience (pretty sure there might be bugs open on 
this) due to opening GPKG files in write-ahead mode, so as to avoid issues in 
case of concurrent editing (probably helps also in situations of single 
editing where one thread does writing, and others are reading)

You can set the OGR_SQLITE_JOURNAL = DELETE environment variable, or the qgis/
walForSqlite3 = false setting to avoid that (but run in the possible above 
mentionned issues)

thanks for the detailed and prompt explanation. So, the old shp strikes
back, far more convenient in this situation, unfortunately.

I didn't try, as the problem seems entirely different: even opening the
properties by double clicking on the legend takes several tens of
seconds, and the cpu stays at 100% forever.

That comes from the fact that a GeoPackage is essentially an SQLite DB, and
SQLite 3 uses WAL by default [1]

See Even reply for workarounds. Anyway SQLite is not meant to be used with
multiple writing processes.

Hi Paolo,

the raster you provided is working very well on my setup (QGIS 3.6 on
Fedora 29);
even without pyramids the rendering takes milliseconds, including when
zooming and/or panning.

yes, the raster goes well. Is when you drop it in a gpkg that slows
down, at least here.
thanks.

nothing to do with multiwrite, but with backupping and syncing.
I have a dir of shp that I sync with a couple of servers, and I
incrementally backup the dir. All fine and efficient. With gpkg the
packages will be saved over and over again even if unchanged.
this is a very serious limitation in professional contests, IMHO.
Cheers.

Yes, indeed, I did it: dropped it in a gpkg and loaded from there.
Everything works fine for me, on both my F29 workstations.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] XYZ Tiles base map not working on QGIS Server
Message-ID: <CAPV-QG_VMj8tkpDm9gMyWpCEYo-+bE7J8rT-xZFOK-uKMOVG3g@mail.gmail.com>

I have a project in QGIS desktop with 3 XYZ Tiles base maps. Everything
works fine.

I use the same .qgs project on QGIS server and only one base map works with
GetMap request.

The following are my requests to the server. The first request shows
OpenStreetMap base map:

http://qgs.webmapp.it/cgi-bin/test/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?MAP=/usr/lib/cgi-bin/test/xyz_tiles.qgs&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=1174461,5729736,1175761,5731386&CRS=EPSG:3857&WIDTH=491&HEIGHT=624&LAYERS=OpenStreetMap&FORMAT=image/png

This request should show the "WebMapp_Tiles" base map, but doesn't work
(white background):

Hi Marco,

Which QGIS Server version ?
Are the XYZ services HTTPS ?
Do you have a proxy for the server ?
Can you made some curl request on the server and access a tile ?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Assigning a primary key in QgsDataSourceUri
	doesn't work
Message-ID: <1552575260703-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi devs,

I use qgis 3.4.5 with windows 7 64bit.

I build a qgsvectorlayer like this :
uri = qgis.core.QgsDataSourceUri()
uri.setDatabase('a_sqlite_file')
uri.setDataSource('', 'SELECT * FROM MyTable', 'geom'
,'','the_pk_column_name')
vlayer = qgis.core.QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), tablename, 'spatialite')

When I ask the id of the features in vlayer ([fet.id() for fet in
vlayer.getFeatures()]), it returns the value of the first column of
'MyTable', and not the value of the 'the_pk_column_name' column...

it was working in 2.18. Could you confirm it is a regression and not a
normal behaviour ?

Regards,

Hi,
Yes one of our customers has been struggling with that. Until we convinced
him that there was enough packager teams available on RendHat CentOS..
So we created  these docker recipes dedicated to run qgis server in
production on a very light debian images :

https://github.com/Oslandia/docker-qgis

One image is dedicated to build QGIS and produce deb packages, the other is
dedicated to be called by a webserver (also dockerised or not).

We just tested yesterday to derive those images to make them clean and
light desktop dockers. And it works nicely. You can test them in the branch
https://github.com/Oslandia/docker-qgis/tree/ele_desktop

Best regards
R√©gis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Translation of QGIS ltr and QGIS master
Message-ID: <1552661436826-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Dear all, the experience just ended of the first LTR version of QGIS leads me
to make some considerations regarding the management of translations.
Many QGIS users are users who work in companies and public administrations;
these users cannot freely choose on which version to operate and therefore
they will use the LTR version even beyond its end of life.

So the problem of harmonizing translations between the LTR version and the
master version is a very important aspect.

As you know, the sources of the GUI and documentation relating to the master
version are made available through the transifex platform. When the LTR
version is released, transifex continues to feed only the master version and
therefore untranslated or worse badly translated strings can no longer be
treated with transifex.

I ask how to resolve this situation.
for example, would it be possible to open a transifex instance ONLY for
3.4.x ltr? people translate and, as for the master, at every release of the
ltr, the translation files are automatically taken from transifex "ltr".
I know that it is possible to translate with qtlinguist and then to do a
pull request for .qm language file, but in this way it is not possible to
translate all together with problems for merging different version andd so
on.

what is your opinion?

thank you in advance

s.

Hi S.,

This is a valid issue that also bothers me for a long time (and I think is
not coherent with the LTR status).
And J√ºrgen Fischer recently pushed a PR that gives me some hope: see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9331 (basically, they are commands that
help to backport transifex translations to elder releases). I quickly gave
it a try but the result did not satisfy me and wanted to do more tests
before reporting anything and bothering J√ºrgen with beginner's problem. If
you want to give it a try... And maybe, instead of running that only for
german, we could run it for all the languages.

I also opened https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/issues/592 few weeks
ago, asking for a place where we could explain how LTR can be translated
more than only the few weeks preceeding its .0 release.

Regards,
Harrissou

ciao  Harrissou, thank you for your reply.
my experience with 2.18 ltr translation was terrificant.
the only solution i have found was to create a personal project in transifex
of qgis 2.18

i used english source file and target (italian) file from here [1] and I
imported them in personal transifex project, but many strings already
translated were not recognised :-(
at the end of work i downloaded from transifex the italian file and sent it
to werner.

i have lost a lot of time to harmonise the versions, because when i found
errors on master or ltr, I i corrected both master and ltr.

I don't understand jurgen's explanation because I don't have the skills, but
i'll try to learn :-)

Message-ID: <1989c09d-ba5f-5a4d-cbf9-3ac054b73fb6@duif.net>

Hi,

For those not aware of Arnaud's work during the Hackfest:

His work makes it relatively easy to test the python snippets in the
pyqgisbook. In this way keeping the python snippets up to date with
code/api changes of QGIS itself is much easier.

We use a Sphinx extension:
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html

In short:
- you run the snippets from within the cookbook rst using QGIS(libs)
either from your build/install dir, OR from within a QGIS-Desktop docker
instance (same as is being used for automatic tests)
- so we (have to!) adapt the code in the pycookbook a little to make it
testable (adding testsetup:: and testcode:: directives)
- he slightly changed the way you can build the documentation (on Linux)
using one or two extra make (.mk) files.

See:
https://github.com/qgis/qgis-documentation#testing-python-snippets

I've just tested and this 1 test :-) works flawlessly if you create a
'user.mk' pointing to your QGIS_PREFIX_PATH

So: now we can make all code snippets testable!
If I am correct he was also busy to get the code examples in the
doxygen/pyqgiscook work with this too @arnaud ?)

Please try!

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS this is Sphinx/Python only, but if somebody jumps in to make it work
in a Windows way this would be even nicer. Or we should update the paver
way again?

Message-ID: <517f5c4b-e269-d100-a685-1391289d39af@duif.net>

Porting some Documentation about Mesh layers, written by Rosa during the
Hackfest, I happened to note that there is no 'Add Mesh Layer' icon on
the 'Manage Layers Toolbar' (see screenie).

So now I wonder: do I create a Feature Request to add 'Add Mesh Layer'
to it (so it opens the DataSource Manager window)?

OR

are we planning to get rid of the 'Manage Layers Toolbar' because we
have the new DataSource Manager dialog now?

Hi Richard,

I wouldn't mind removing it - but we could also do it in two steps: 
first disabling it by default for new users and then later remove it 
completely.

Hi Andreas,

IIRC the removal was discussed in the original plan, your proposal looks
good.

I think the data source manager dialog icon should outshine the others but
I have no idea how to do that.

Hi Richard,

I wouldn't like the 'Manage Layers Toolbar' to be removed just yet. I 
use the 'Spreadsheet layers' plugin a lot and this plugin places an icon 
on the Manage Layers toolbar. This is very convenient as it means the 
plugin can be accessed with one click. If the Manage Layers toolbar were 
removed then users would have to access the plugin through the menu bar 
(Layer > Add Layer > Add spreadsheet layer) which is slightly less 
convenient.

Perhaps the authors of the plugin, Camptocamp, need to be involved in 
this discussion?

Regards, Frank.

Hi Frank,

A plugin developers is free to place a button on whatever toolbar he
wants. In your case the author could also place it in the 'Vector layer'
toolbar, if you really like a button to have.
About removing it or not. I'm ok with both options, though I think we
should refrain for becoming an application in which there are 4 ways to
do stuff an in that way clutter the application with buttons, panels and
bars.

I think Andreas option is fine: remove it for some time from the
'default' startup panels (for new users) and then later remove it.

Regard,

Richard Duivenvoorde

For the record, this toolbar is already hidden by default.

Some people like the one-button unified dialog, some prefer the individual
provider buttons. I don't see why we'd want / what we'd gain to remove this
hidden-by-default toolbar.

We'd gain the need to support it: as said, it is missing th 'Add Mesh
Layer' button currently. So I'd be in favour of removing instead of
investing time keeping (even hidden) toolbars up to date with new
functionality.

I'm also aware that adding it is 10 minutes of work, but I think we keep
too much 'history' in all kind of places in the project: we should not
be afraid to do some cleanup once and every while?

This is an old debate, GIS programs usually show a very cluttered
interface. It's matter of muscles: more icons, more tools, more power.
Uncluttering the interface would help noviced and power users. I think that
actions that are performed "per feature" (frequently) may benefit from
getting an icon (and a keyboard shortcut) for one-click actions, but
actions that are performed "per map" (relatively unfrequently) should not
get an icon. I'm very fond of the superposition of Layer and Browser panel
because they are mutually exclusive. You may add a layer than switch to the
layer level and manage it ‚Äì two clicks, but very useful and not in the
front stage. How many times you add a layer to a map?
One thing that should be assured is the complete alignment of Layer -> Add
Layer menu and Browser panel.
I know showing a new icon helps advertising new features, but... let's find
another way, say adding a button to the splash screen...
My two boring cents (sorry!)

Hi all,

I cannot find in the documentation how to run a Processing algorithm in
the iterative mode via pyqgis. Even doing it with the UI and then
looking at the history there seems to me that no additional flags are added.

Some hints?

Thanks!

It's not exposed anywhere. The logic sits here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/gui/AlgorithmExecutor.py#L297
 , but that's not stable API and shouldn't be relied on by plugins.
Best to copy that if you need it in your code.

Message-ID: <b32d9edc-8236-4d03-5c62-5137081b0190@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

A question about technical details of the attribute table:

When having some features on your mapcanvas; does QGIS then still have
(links to) the attributes somewhere? Or do we really have to refetch the
features from the datasource?

Context: when connecting to a WFS behind a rather big db, but zoomed in
to say a bbox seeing just 10 features, opening the attribute table seems
to start to fetch ALL features before showing anything.

While I hope, that maybe the attributes are already available. Then we
could for example go for a 'second attribute'-table button with which
you ask for: show me the attribute table of current viewable features
only. Because that is the use-case I often encounter.

BUT if it is just not possible, maybe because a wfs-fetch ony
retrieves/keeps the geometries and it'a id's then this seems not so easy
to implement.

Hope somebody can tell us more,

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I would like to display a bar diagram in a dock widget which is linked to a loaded layer. The bar diagram itself is a simple one based on a single field in the said layer. The important requirement it to keep the chart in sync with the layer data.

Is there some recommended existing infrastructure that would help me do this?

It was ported from Python -> c++, so is no longer importable like
this. What's your use case for importing direct rather than running
via processing.run?

Hi Nyall, thanks for your answer.

Somewhere in the middle of a calculation process (not an algorithm) I'd 
like to add a polygon feature to a line layer. I'm using the function to 
turn the polygon into a line geometry.



I'm using it like this and don't know I figured this out or decided on it:

from processing.algs.qgis import PolygonsToLines

toLines = PolygonsToLines.PolygonsToLines().convertToLines


then later on many places in my code:

geom = toLines(geom)



I remember it took me a while to figure out that second line, but having 
my own short "alias" function toLines() is very convenient. But maybe I 
can create it in another way, holding the processing.run code.

I will try tomorrow.

One last question, it seems to me like the old code is working again in 
3.7. Can you confirm that?

Kind regards,
Raymond

I'd replace this with:

    def toLines(geom):
        return QgsGeometry(geom.get().boundary())

(Using https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsAbstractGeometry.html#qgis.core.QgsAbstractGeometry.boundary
)

Shouldn't be -- maybe you have a leftover .py file here?

Indeed. I did a clean install and it is not working in my 3.7 anymore.

Great, thanks for the confirmation. And because I've got to do mapping
all day, I'm in a good mood, and you get a free PyQGIS lesson:

geom.get() : gives you the underlying fundamental geometry object
attached to the feature. QgsFeature.geometry() returns a QgsGeometry
object, which is more or less a "container" for geometries. It's got
some convenient methods which apply to ALL geometry types, but
sometimes you need to dig down to the actual geometry primitive. In
that case you use geometry.get(), and you get the fundamental
QgsPoint/QgsLineString/QgsPolygon/etc object. It's actually generally
preferable to call "geometry.constGet()", IF you are doing some
operation which doesn't alter the geometry in place (like you are
here). But that's a complex microoptimisation.

geom.get().boundary() gives you the topological boundary of the
primitive. For polygons this is their exterior + interior rings, for
lines it's their start and end point (unless it's a closed ring, in
which case you get a null geometry). Points have no boundary. Using
boundary() to convert polygons to lines is the most efficient method -
it's very heavily optimised, and works perfectly with curved geometry
types and maintains any Z or M values which may be present.

Lastly, you need to wrap the result back up into a QgsGeometry object
- hence QgsGeometry(....boundary() ). This is because most of QGIS API
works with QgsGeometry objects (remember, they are like "containers"
holding a geometry), and NOT the fundamental geometry objects.

Done! A super-efficient, rock solid approach which will work with all
input geometry types. Win!

(for reference - this is what the polygons to lines algorithm actually
does in the background too)

 "ssl mode require".
Message-ID: <fd76f4d163154dad8fd0ebc5d6a5046f@bd.so.ch>

Did you find any solution for this? I can confirm it on Version 3.4.5 (Standalone Installer, on Windows).

Additionally, I observed the following behaviour:

* When I observe the connections on the DB, I see four connections from QGIS after opening my test project and navigating around in the project. When I stop any activity in QGIS, two of these connections are closed after 60 seconds, and after 60 more seconds, a third connection is closed. When I now start panning around again, new connections are opened, and on this occasion QGIS asks me for the DB credentials again. (It happens even after the first two connections have been closed and then opened again.)

* When QGIS asks for the credentials again and again, if I click on "Cancel", rendering seems to work nonetheless.

* If I disable multi-threaded rendering ("Render layers in parallel using many CPU cores"), this doesn't happen, i.e. I'm asked for the PostGIS credentials only once after opening the project. So I suspect multi-threaded rendering to cause the problem. Maybe it doesn't handle the connection pool correctly?


Just for completeness: It's about a PostGIS connection with no credentials saved, neither in the project nor in the authentication database, with SSL mode set to "prefer", and a DB accepting SSL connections only.


Best regards,
Andy

Hi Andy,

unfortunately, there is no solution at the moment. This is a bug that was caused by a change in the WMS provider handling. This change has resulted in disableling the cache for database logon. This leads to a new request of the credentials after 60 seconds of inactivity. But help is coming: I have contacted J√ºrgen Fischer, who is working on the problem. But we still need a little patience.

Regards
Burghardt

I'd have a look at the DataPlotly plugin -- this offers what you need

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgUMMg7Xs7yv4rrfgg54QOorSuE04+N7a5eR-GErfHpyw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi lists!

This is just a quick announcement for anyone who is unaware: North
Road and Faunalia are currently running a crowdfunding campaign to
extend the QGIS "DataPlotly" plugin to allow beautiful, feature rich
graphs and plots within QGIS print layouts.

You can read the full details of the campaign and see some mockups and
screencasts at https://north-road.com/qgis-data-plotly-campaign/.

If you know of anyone this may be of interest to, please share the
word! The success of QGIS crowdfunding campaigns is directly dependant
on this community spreading the news to local end users, so any local
publicity you can do would be very much appreciated.

Regards,
Nyall Dawson

Hi Jurgen,

GRASS 7.6.1 is now released and available at OSGeo4W, but it's directory is
now just 'grass76'.

So, the paths needs to be updated, before QGIS 3.6.1 and 3.4.6 release.

Thank you very much!

The path is retrieved via

grass76 --config path

on build (but cached - but the the current build directory will be nuked when
the qgis version changes).

Hi All

I am using a value map lookup to let the user select a month on a form. I used the ‚ÄòLoad Data from Layer option and the months are displayed in a somewhat random looking order. Is there any trick to getting the values to display in ascending order of the key? Or is this a bug?

I would like to know if this possiblity of using a setting to set default
format has been implemented?

I'm currently planing to upgrade our 50+ QGIS 2.18 to QGIS 3.4 with a custom
QGIS3.ini and I really want to be able to set default project format to
*.qgs.

Like Andreas, sometimes I need to do some mass projects edits (currently we
have 150+) and it works well with a global `search and replace` with
Notepad++. The workaround proposed by Jorge Gustavo Rocha could be fine to
edit 1 file but not for a mass edit.

Thanks in advance for your answer.

R√©mi

Hi R√©mi,
you can use the global settings ini file to override default option for
QGIS.
There is an option to start QGIS with another default setting file

--globalsettingsfile

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_configuration.html#running-qgis-with-advanced-settings

You can have a look at how the french ministry of ecology handles this
issue here:
http://www.geoinformations.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/qgis-package-3-4-2-pour-test-a3662.html

Best regards,
R√©gis

Salut R√©gis,

Thanks for your answer and link.

I'm already shipping QGIS with custom INI file, what I'm looking for is the
parameter to set the default project format. And then put it in my
QGIS3.ini.

Or did I miss something in your link?

R√©mi

Sorry R√©mi, I was anticipating.
  This is harcoded right now and the option does not exists yet. I'm unsure
if adding an option can be backported to QGIS 3.4 unfortunately.

Hi,

The alternative (workaround) is to put your values in another table and 
link them through a shared key. Then the sorting works fine. Also the 
relation reference widget (which requires a relation) sorts values fine.

Of course this doesn't mean the bug in the value map shouldn't be fixed. 
You can ask a developer familiar with the widgets (e.g. Matthias or 
someone else familiar with the widgets) to fix it, as part of our bug 
fixing program.

Greetings,

Andreas

Yeah I tried that, the problem is I want to reference the lookup list from the same table:

Flowering_month -> months table
Fruiting_month -> months table
Pruning_month -> months table

If I try to use the relation system for that the months table is removed as a relatable table after it has been used once (another bug maybe)?

Yeah it would db great if you could fix that next time you are doing paid bug fixing @mathias - seems like a basic thing that should ‚Äòjust work‚Äô.

Thanks for the replies Giovanni and Andreas.

Hi,

Since QGIS 3, the configuration is already stored as list (ordered) and
no longer as map (unordered) like in QGIS 2. So it should mostly be there.

What's missing apparently is that the "load the values from CSV" button
does not preserve the order.

I can have a look at that in a bugfixing sprint.

Meanwhile you can type the values manually instead of loading them from
CSV as a workaround

Could the issue report #19299 '"Attribute Table" rows open randomly
ordered?' https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19299 be related to this?

Message-ID: <CAOM0XWAjn3UdqVv4NYKZTseMSvCsbC-v9uhmkHmV+CNkbL-1-w@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings Everyone,

I'm simply writing to see if anyone would be able to help unstall PR 8911
(my PR) .

 I am aware that Mr. Dawson and Mr. Khun are highly busy and should review
the PR eventually and that they are the most familiar with this part of the
code. But I am still wondering if any other dev could also take a quick
look to it and provide any sort of feedback to find any oversight or to
help get them in the master so people can use them and test it in the wild.

I am aware that this might seem like a silly feature but for anyone making
a lot of maps, this can be a lifesaver and such a thing was not present in
other GIs that I am aware of.

Thanks again!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Calc default value or Reuse last entered value
	-bug ?
Message-ID: <38497AD9CA059C42AA3451EFEFF0378E01E7699FCE@P2KITMBX04WC02.unicph.domain>

Hi,
Stumbled into two problems ‚Äì not sure how to solve:

Have setup an Attribute form and as a default value for area using ‚Äòround($area,1)‚Äô and ‚ÄòApply default value on update‚Äô
While digitizing and want to reuse all attributes but the area ‚Äì I have changed the Settings- Digitizing to ‚ÄòReuse last entered attribute value‚Äô

Works fine for the first feature‚Ä¶ but the second feature will then get the first features area value. I do know ‚ÄòYou can¬¥t get it all‚Äô ‚Äì but‚Ä¶ I love to be able the reuse the no-calculated attributes AND get calculated values in the attribute form.

Second problem ‚Äì Turning off the ‚ÄòReuse last entered attribute value‚Äô so there will be no conflict ‚Äì I now wants to edit the shape of a feature. Using ‚ÄòSplit feature‚Äô from ‚ÄòAdvanced digitizing tool‚Äô I now have two features. Both have same attribute values except for the calculated value ‚Äì as expected. BUT one of the features has the original area value. I expected to get both features attributes updated.

Any suggestions for my two problems

Should it be updated automatically later?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to update features with WFS-T & QGIS-Server
	3.4?
Message-ID: <1553524275358-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi

I have a problem with WFS-T. I'm creating map using OpenLayers 5.3,
Qgis-server 3.4 and postgis 9.6-2.4. The task is to get layer with WFS and
add possibility to draw new layer records, modify(update) existing or
delete.

Getting layers, insert and delete works but there is problem with
modify(update).

I don't understand error when trying to commit update with modification. Do
you know how to fix it?
I mean "PostGIS error while changing attributes: ERROR:  prepared statement
"updatefeature" already exists" in TransactionResponse on the bottom.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] replacement of QgsMapLayer::LayerType by
	QgsMapLayerType
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+bDkqnA41RY6njSJ8sL+_dDQFFv2DeHE97P5azD-MReuw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

A small warning that I am about to merge PR #9437
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9437

This pull request adds a new scope based enum for map layer types.
In other words, QgsMapLayer::LayerType is now QgsMapLayerType.

This change has been motivated by:
- scope based enums are nicely displayed in the PyQGIS docs (see
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/gui/QgsAdvancedDigitizingDockWidget.html#qgis.gui.QgsAdvancedDigitizingDockWidget.AdditionalConstraint
 )
- taking the enum outside of the QgsMapLayer class:
  * allows to use forward declarations of the enum (and not including the
whole qgsmaplayer.h file)
  * avoid the rather long call: QgsMapLayer::LayerType::VectorLayer
(mandatory with scope based enums)

This means that current "green" pull request **might** actually need a
rebase and retest.

Regarding Python API compatibility, it is kept by using monkey patching. So
no worries on this side.

This follows a former merged PR that introduced a scope based enum, but
this one was kept in class
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9425

So, basically to be nicely displayed in the PyQGIS API docs, all enums
shall be converted to scope based enums. Then, deciding to take them out of
class or not depends a bit if the enum is meant to be mainly used within
the class or not.

Thanks for reading, best wishes
And have a good rebase :)

Denis

Hi Jurgen,

The bat files are now calling:

call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-grass76\etc\env.bat"
path
%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-ltr-dev\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-grass76\lib;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-grass76\bin;%PATH%

which does not seem correct.

grass76 --config path
C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\grass\grass76

So, shouldn't they call:

call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass76\etc\env.bat"
path
%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-rel-dev\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass76\lib;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass76\bin;%PATH%

Can you take a look?

Thank you very much.

Best regards,
Pedro

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Current crowd-funding initiatives
Message-ID: <ac751dcc-f4e6-2315-0c3e-60769150ed18@carto.net>

Hi,

I am trying to do a bit of promotion of the current crowd-funding 
initiatives at blog.qgis.org and the Swiss QGIS user group.

I know about four current initiatives:

- QGIS Print Layouts Graphs and Charts Campaign (North-Road/Faunalia). 
See https://north-road.com/qgis-data-plotly-campaign/

- GeoPDF export support (North-Road on initiative of Land Vorarlberg). 
No public information yet, but already financed about 80%.

- SLYR: the ESRI LYR and MXD to QGIS converter (North-Road). See 
https://north-road.com/slyr/

- Selective Masking Symbol Layers behind Labels and Symbols. See 
http://qgis.oslandia.com/en/offre-qgis/selective-masking/

Do you know any additional initiatives that I should mention?

Thanks,

Andreas

It's not current yet, but in a couple of months we'll be launching a
"pick list" of Processing Model ETL improvements. This won't be a
traditional crowd funding campaign, but rather a set of individually
priced, atomic improvements to Processing/Graphical Modeler which
brings it closer to parity with FME/other ETL tools. Prices for each
individual item will range from 30EU -> 500EU, and we'll be asking
sponsors to entirely fund each item in entirety. Think of it like an
"√† la carte" menu of improvements for models!

Message-ID: <CAAgsrZiavsqWSSAs_RYE9ZhpDxYYSXkCAYdeQLm29Mobu=W5ig@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I'm working on a plugin that has been ported to QGIS 3.x
Everything works fine, even all translations are corrected generated in all
other .py files I'm not able to translate the string in the main .py file
of the plugin.

In the initGui function I have these lines:

self.CreateReceiverPoints_item = QAction(QIcon("
:/plugins/opeNoise/icons/icon_CreateReceiverPoints.png"), self.tr("Create
Receiver Points"), self.iface.mainWindow())
Even if I double checked that the mainfile openoise.py is added in the /
translation.pro such strings are not present inside the corresponding .ts
files

Where I'm wrong?

the code is available here:
https://github.com/pierluigiderosa/openoise/tree/qgis3

Thanks to all
Pierluigi

Message-ID: <BD45EBF3-0112-44E4-BFA3-B160041F12BE@3liz.com>

Hi devs,

We use to build docker images of the latest qgis releases and we have a regression  affecting version 3.6.0 official release on buster

Qgis: 3.6.0 on Debian

If we read a layer with python:

> layer = QgsVectorLayer('./mydata.shp')

Then the layer is invalid (no warning, no errors)

Doing the same thing on stretch + Qgis 3.4.5 (ltr) with same data work flawlessly and lead to a valid layer.

This was not affecting previous build 24 h ago (release end nightly-release)

The tests were based with shapefiles from testdata in qgis sources.

We are not sure it that come from Qgis itself or from a change on the distribution.

David,

The situation seems to be worst: it seems that no layers can be read from python whatever the format.

Hi David,

anything in the logs?

I would check QGIS_PREFIX_PATH env var, and make sure the provider
libraries are found and loaded.

Hi Alessandro

No there is nothing at all in the logs.

I have used the same reduced snippet on qgis 3.4.5 (ltr) on Stretch and qgis 3.6.0 (release) on buster, using the same datasource:

```
import os
from qgis.core import QgsApplication, QgsVectorLayer

# prevent display not found error
os.environ['QT_QPA_PLATFORM'] = 'offscreen'

qgis_application = QgsApplication([], False )
layer = QgsVectorLayer('path/to/data')

layer.isValid() # Return True on 3.4.5/stretch, False on 3.6.0/buster whatever the data
```

If the release package has not been updated in the previous  24 h, I suspect that something has been broken on the buster distro.

Note that I'm able to load shapefile in python with ogr (gdal-python).

Hi,

I'm looking for advice to give to students who use Mac and since I don't
have one, I cannot test it myself :-|

What's a good way to get Qt Designer assuming that they have installed the
Lutra QGIS Mac packages?

I found https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download but wonder if
that will work / be sufficient.

Regards,
Anita

1) I dont think the Lutra packages bundle in QtDesigner (I searched the app folder for it but dont see it)
2) I tested the bundle from the link you provided and it loads / runs fine


Note that the bundle you are pointing students to won‚Äôt have the QGIS designer plugins set up and I am not sure if / how to get the QGIS native widgets to show in designer. Otherwise I guess it is going to work fine.

Tim

Hi Anita,

Qt Designer is not part of the package, since it is a developer tool. Best
is to just download it from the Qt https://www.qt.io/download and install.
Should be straightforward.

Kind regards,
Peter

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsProcessingAlgorithm / add Layer to project
Message-ID: <CADk6Kd9Juzy-2xvT4dzvgAKCrUmmjOJ17FLPVpLPFh2zXNHy0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to add a layer to project in a QgsProcessingAlgorithm.

I run the folowing test code, just to find a way to add a layer to the
project. I don't want to use featureSink because at the end the layer I
want to add is a raster layer :

def processAlgorithm(self, parameters, context, feedback):
        """
        Here is where the processing itself takes place.
        """

        vlayer1 =
QgsVectorLayer('Point?crs=epsg:4326&field=id:integer&field=name:string(20)&index=yes',
'vlayer1', "memory")
        vlayer2 =
QgsVectorLayer('Point?crs=epsg:4326&field=id:integer&field=name:string(20)&index=yes',
'vlayer2', "memory")
        vlayer3 =
QgsVectorLayer('Point?crs=epsg:4326&field=id:integer&field=name:string(20)&index=yes',
'vlayer3', "memory")
        vlayer4 =
QgsVectorLayer('Point?crs=epsg:4326&field=id:integer&field=name:string(20)&index=yes',
'vlayer4', "memory")

        context.addLayerToLoadOnCompletion(vlayer1.id(),context.LayerDetails('toto',
QgsProject.instance(), 'test1'))
        context.addLayerToLoadOnCompletion(vlayer2.id(),context.LayerDetails('toto',
context.project(), 'test2'))
        QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer3, True)
        context.project().addMapLayer(vlayer4, True)


        return {self.OUTPUT: 'toto'}

I read that adding a layer directly from instance() should not be used in a
processing algorithm.
However, none of the created vectorLayer is added to the legend.

I get a warning on processing feedback with no details in message log :

Am i doing wrong or is there something broken in procesing API?

Thanks

Thanks for reconfirming, Peter!

Best is to just download it from the Qt https://www.qt.io/download and

I don't find Qt's download options very straightforward. I'm unsure of
what's included in the installer available from
https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer (only Qt or also dev tools).

But I'll give the previously mentioned 3rd party Qt Designer installer a
try.

Anita

Thanks Denis for your answer.

It helps but I still have some issues with rasterLayers :

------
vlayer2 =
QgsVectorLayer('Point?crs=epsg:4326&field=id:integer&field=name:string(20)&index=yes',
'vlayer2', "memory")

c_insee = '57533'
n_couche = 'test_cadastre'
EPSG_code = '2154'
urlWithParams = "url=http://inspire.cadastre.gouv.fr/scpc/
"+c_insee+".wms?contextualWMSLegend=0&crs=EPSG:"+EPSG_code+"&dpiMode=7&featureCount=10&format=image/png&layers=AMORCES_CAD&layers=LIEUDIT&layers=CP.CadastralParcel&layers=SUBFISCAL&layers=CLOTURE&layers=DETAIL_TOPO&layers=HYDRO&layers=VOIE_COMMUNICATION&layers=BU.Building&layers=BORNE_REPERE&styles=&styles=&styles=&styles=&styles=&styles=&styles=&styles=&styles=&styles=&maxHeight=1024&maxWidth=1280"

rlayer = QgsRasterLayer(urlWithParams, 'Cadastre_'+n_couche+'_'+c_insee,
'wms')

context.temporaryLayerStore().addMapLayer(vlayer2)
context.temporaryLayerStore().addMapLayer(rlayer)

context.addLayerToLoadOnCompletion(vlayer2.id(),context.LayerDetails('test2',
context.project(), 'test2'))
context.addLayerToLoadOnCompletion(rlayer.id(),context.LayerDetails('cadastre',
context.project(), 'cadastre'))
------

vlayer2 is properly added to the project but i still get an error for rlayer

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Strange issue with custom
	QgsLayerTreeViewMenuProvider in python
Message-ID: <CAExk7p0LXNAoBcpOxTorFTUmjqWKST5oom_4KG3QUmgfCOdaHw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I'm currently working on a plugin where I need to disable some actions from
the legend context menu (the one that appears when right-clicking).

I though of doing so by creating a custom QgsLayerTreeViewMenuProvider
class that would get the QMenu from the default menu provider, then do the
alterations, then return the altered QMenu.

I was almost able to get it working like this (stripped down example
below). This works the first time, when enabling the plugin in the plugin
manager. It also works from the Python console. But when the plugin is
loaded at the starting of QGIS, I get a hard crash upon right-clicking in
the legend.

Everything looks like either the layer tree view or the default menu
provider is not correctly initialized when the plugin's initGui is called.

I tried some workarounds, such as retrieving and replacing the provider a
bit later (using iface.projectRead or iface.currentLayerChanged signals),
which mitigates the issue, but I still get random crashes (around 1 out of
5-6 times).

Is there something I'm doing wrong ? Or can you think of another way to
achieve my goal ?

Thanks !!

Olivier

Hi Val√©rian,

It was an issue in processing code, that Nyall finally itdentified and
fixed here:

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QField 1.0 is here
Message-ID: <a5583f0f-2e88-ca62-d2e5-d3ab90c0f7c2@opengis.ch>

Hi all, sorry for cross posting but I think after almost 8 years from
the first QGIS android commit ("added first scripts" [0]) you will all
be happy to know about a commit [1] I did very recently.

It read: "and Matterhorn it is... both a beauty :)"

Yes, we did name QField 1.0 after the most iconic mountain as they are
both, indeed, a beauty!

You can get it while it‚Äôs hot on the Playstore [2] or on GitHub [3]

Here the beginning of the release blog post:

> We are incredibly pleased and proud of just having released such a
jewel and are convinced that, thanks to all its features and conscious
design choices, QField will make your field digitizing work much more
efficient and pleasant.
> Packed with loads of useful features like online and offline features
digitizing, geometry and attributes editing, attribute search, powerful
forms, theme switching, GPS support, camera integration and much more,
QField is the powerful > tool for those who need to edit on the go and
would like to avoid standing in the swamp with a laptop or paper charts.

The whole post with a lot of information about QField can be found at [4]

I'd like to thank the fantastic QGIS and QField community for all the
great translations, documentations, bug reports and general feedback
they gave us. Thanks to all this, we were able to fix plenty of bugs,
address performance issues and even add some super cool new features.

Ciao Marco

Hi Alessandro

I have found the problem, qgis packaging on buster is totally broken: it mixes 3.6.0 and 3.6.1 dependencies

If you try to install  python-qgis you get the following packages installed:

ii  libqgis-3d3.6.0                         1:3.6.0+15buster            amd64        QGIS - shared 3d library
ii  libqgis-analysis3.6.0                   1:3.6.0+15buster            amd64        QGIS - shared analysis library
ii  libqgis-core3.6.0                       1:3.6.0+15buster            amd64        QGIS - shared core library 
ii  libqgis-core3.6.1                       1:3.6.1+15buster            amd64        QGIS - shared core library
ii  libqgis-customwidgets                   1:3.6.1+15buster            amd64        QGIS custom widgets for Qt Designer
ii  libqgis-gui3.6.0                        1:3.6.0+15buster            amd64        QGIS - shared gui library
ii  libqgis-gui3.6.1                        1:3.6.1+15buster            amd64        QGIS - shared gui library
ii  libqgis-native3.6.0                     1:3.6.0+15buster            amd64        QGIS - shared native gui library
ii  libqgis-native3.6.1                     1:3.6.1+15buster            amd64        QGIS - shared native gui library
ii  libqgis-server3.6.0                     1:3.6.0+15buster            amd64        QGIS - shared server library
ii  libqgispython3.6.0                      1:3.6.0+15buster            amd64        QGIS - shared Python library
ii  python-qgis                             1:3.6.0+15buster            amd64        Python bindings to QGIS
ii  python-qgis-common                      1:3.6.0+15buster            all          Python bindings to QGIS - architecture-independent files

Packages are installed twice in both version 3.6.0 and 3.6.1 !!!!!

This lead to very unpredictible behavior when using qgis in python (simply not working or crashing randomly)

I Forgot to mention that they are the packages from the https://qgis.org/debian/ <https://qgis.org/debian/> repository and not the the packages from the debian distro.

But the providers  are missing: you need also to install the 'qgis-providers' package which, fortunately, has dependencies 
only on 3.6.1 package version.

Hi,

You need also to install the qgis-server package because libraires for the services are provided by this package: 

/usr/lib/qgis/server
/usr/lib/qgis/server/libdummy.so
/usr/lib/qgis/server/libwcs.so
/usr/lib/qgis/server/libwfs.so
/usr/lib/qgis/server/libwms.so
/usr/lib/qgis/server/libwmts.so

Without these libraries the server  api is not working as expected, may be these libs should be part of libqgis-serverX.Y.Z ?

So, If I summarize, in order to have a functional server API on buster, one need to install

- python3-qgis
- qgis-server (which depends on qgis-providers)

Is that a transitional scheme ? 

Thanks,

I have mentioned this before and never heard back but "Qt Designer with
QGIS 3.6.1 custom widgets" and "Qt Designer with QGIS 3.4.6 custom widgets"
do not have any of the custom widgets.

I am using the OSGeo4W installer with the latest release for Windows. The
custom widgets need to be added back in.

Thanks,

It would have been better to file a ticket.  Fixed.

Message-ID: <0d501852-ab98-f22e-d2f3-247077c90496@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm very happy to inform you all that this morning the first doc PR with
pyqgs code snippet has been tested in Travis:

https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/builds/513389178#L1729

Thanks to Arnaud Morvan PR [0], python code can now be tested
automatically when a PR is submitted.

The whole process is documented here [1] so that new contributors can
add testable snippet.

This is a great enhancement for the pyqgis cookbook: we will be sure
that the code snippet can be used "as they are" within QGIS.

Kudos to all the QGIS community and contributors!

Cheers

Matteo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Proxy support in Python Plugins
Message-ID: <a098cd75-a55c-bf71-fc06-27a28ef83353@gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to upgrade ORS Tools to not work with requests anymore to fetch 
GET and POST queries. However, I never used QgsNetworkAccessManager and 
have little knowledge about networking in general. I tried mostly 
Boundless Geo's NetworkAccessManager wrapper. Couldn't make it work for 
my plugin. When I set a free online Proxy in QGIS settings, all other 
apps/plugin in QGIS could access the internet, my plugin couldn't, it 
would timeout.

I did smth akin to:

nam = networkaccessmanager.NetworkAccessManager()

base_url = 'https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse'
params = {'lat': point.y(), 'lon': point.x(), 'format': 'json'}
url = base_url + '?' + urlencode(params)

response, content = self.nam.request(url=url, headers={'User-Agent': 
user_agent}, blocking=False)

Figuring it would automatically use the Proxy settings in QGIS. It 
doesn't, it seems. So 3 questions:

1. How do I make my code use the QGIS proxy settings?

2. How do I debug, i.e. how do I check that the request actually used 
the proxy settings? Couldn't find much, even on the native Qt parent.

3. Is there a way to use non-blocking requests in native 
QgsNetworkAccessManager? Actually it's not so important, since batch 
requests are being done within the Processing framework (assuming that 
won't affect the main thread..), it's more informational.

I did some research, but as I don't find a terrible amount of time 
lately to maintain all the open source projects, I was hoping to get 
some quick answer from someone. I'm sure I'm missing smth really 
obvious. Sorry, if it really is obvious and I just can't see it.. Also, 
a reference to an existing plugin would suffice.

Many thanks
Nils

Message-ID: <CAFFV8Fg-3V_60n_eJ3W_Q=s+s0p3kNB4pE9w0W7TFTioR50iUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a CSV with multiple columns including some WKT columns containing
polygon definitions. I've exported the layer as GeoPackage. Later, I wanted
to import the GeoPackage content to PostGIS but the import fails because
the WKT strings are longer than the fields DB Manager creates. The layer
properties state that the WKT columns are text(255) but the strings are
considerably longer.

(If I directly import the CSV to PostGIS, all is well.)

I'm not sure what kind of ticket I should open ...
- Option #1: DB Manager should be more fault tolerant and create less
restrictive columns
- Option #2: QGIS shouldn't create GeoPackages that store long strings in
field defined as text(255)

What do you recommend?

Regards,
Anita

Hi Anita,

I think 2 looks like a bug.

I didn't look at it but from your description seems like DB manager
correctly follows the (wrong) information from the provider.

Hi Nils,

IF you use QgsNetworkAccessManager, you get all proxy and authentication
stuff for free with it.
In my plugins I use the Boundless wrapper made by Luigi and Alessandro:

https://github.com/boundlessgeo/lib-qgis-commons/blob/master/qgiscommons2/network/networkaccessmanager.py

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/pdokservicesplugin/blob/master/pdokgeocoder.py#L30
I just add the Boundless networkaccessmanager to my plugin.

I know Nyall has tried to make it easier for Python devs to create a
thread-save non-synchron requests, but if I am correct that became too
complex/unsafe (Nyall?)
What was added though (QGIS 3.6) was:

QgsNetworkAccessManager.blockingGet

see:
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.6/core/QgsNetworkAccessManager.html#qgis.core.QgsNetworkAccessManager.blockingGet

Or in use:
https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/TimeManager/blob/guess_wmst_timeframes/raster/wmstlayer.py#L89

I think this can be used in your use case.

Off course you can also create your own use of it, but then indeed you
have to make yourself very familiar with how Qt handles network requests
etc.

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Richard

But this discussion reminds me about an extension I'd like to propose:
As a user when searching and browsing for a plugin in QGIS extension
manager and on the website https://plugins.qgis.org/ , I'd like that
users be informed before hand about the dependencies and restrictions.

Actually Richard suggested already this to "add a big note in the
metadata.txt description that this plugin is only usable with vesper
and windows.". There are actually quite some plugins which require an
account to be usable.

So my suggestion is to add an optional field/entry/line in
metadata.txt called "Requirements" where dependencies and restrictions
are to be described. This entry would be mandatory if there exist such
requirements - and some dependencies and restrictions could
potentially even be validated automatically.

Message-ID: <CAFcOn2_OUTZEbLWT=Tw+My6Q6CTDNQRAAXPJrwkVaitf743_6w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

As a user when searching and browsing for a plugin in QGIS extension
manager or on the website https://plugins.qgis.org/ , I think users
should be informed before hand about the requirements, dependencies
and restrictions of a plugin.

These are possible requirements, dependencies and restrictions which
come to my mind: The plugin...
* is running only on one platform
* is depending on some other SW to be installed separately (because
it's not included in the QGIS installation),
* requires some registration or account.

My suggestion is to add an optional field/entry/line in metadata.txt
called "Requirements" where requirements, dependencies and
restrictions are to be described.

This entry would be mandatory if there exist such requirements. Some
dependencies and restrictions could potentially even be potentially
validated automatically.

:Stefan

P.S. I actually also thought about adding a "spatial extends"
attribute in metadata.txt in order to indicate that this plugin only
works for some specific countries or regions. But for now I'd just
prefer that the chapter "Recommendations" on
https://plugins.qgis.org/publish/ is being extended to mention that
spatial limitations to be mentioned in the plugin description!

Good idea. Perhaps listing actual Python requirements or pointing to / assessing a requirements.txt type file is pushing it?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Enhancing recommendations text for metadata.txt
 (Was: QTiles3 with suboptimal name and repo entries)
Message-ID: <CAFcOn2_ygpMDHhAMo=cD__0xUsDQakhS9H9EGoDFV7wtDzFLdw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

QTiles was a useful plugin from NextGIS to generate raster tiles from
a QGIS 2 project. In march 2018 an issue was opened to update it to
QGIS 3 [1]. In january 2019 it was forked and - lucky us users -
updated to QGIS 3 by another developer and released in the plugin repo
[2].

This is all fine, except at least following issues:
1. The plugin was renamed from QTiles to QTiles3
2. In metadata.txt of QTiles3 the 3 entries "homepage, tracker,
repository" all are pointing to the original github repo of NextGIS
[3], but the code for QTiles3 is not there. It's IMHO not yet made
publicly available, except by the fact that Python code is always
included in the zip uploaded to the QGIS repo.

Ad 1: I think renaming a plugin just because it's upgraded to QGIS 3
should be discouraged.

Ad 2: To me QGIS maintainers should somehow be able to check in a
computer-supported way, if the plugin code uploaded is identical with
the code repo indicated in metadata.txt.

I'd like to propose to extend chapter "Recommendations" [4] with
following addendums:

* Don't rename the plugin title just because it's upgraded to a newer
version like QGIS 3.

* Check if source code uploaded to the QGIS plugin repo as zip is
identical to "Code repository" indicated in metadata.txt.

In addition I suggested adding "Requirements" as optional
field/entry/line in metadata.txt" in another thread. But as a short
term action (until a "Requirements" field/entry/line is adopted in
metadata.txt) I'd also suggest this text in chapter "Recommendations"
[4]:

* Mention any requirements, dependencies and restrictions in the
description text section (which can be multi-line). Examples of
requirements, dependencies and restrictions are, if the plugin is
running only on selected platforms, requires SW to be installed
separately or some user account, but also if the plugin is spatially
covering just some countries or regions.

What do you think?

Hi,

I could replicate this behavior (limiting string to 255) using QGIS 3
by exporting a layer to a GeoPackage.
My impression is, that GeoPackage data provider is replacing
String/QString field types which have length 0, by a default length of
255 chars (which is obviously wrong).

Agreed, I routinely do it. I'm not always successful convincing the
authors, unfortunately, and in some cases I publish the new plugin
nonetheless because of its usefulness.

right, currently it is quite unpractical to do it for all 1000+ plugins,
and for the 2-4 new or upgraded versions arriving daily.
could you please open a ticket on this?

Would you be available helping us to implement it?

Ciao Paolo

Thanks for replying.
I've opened this ticket https://issues.qgis.org/issues/21715 .
I'm sorry not being able to promise help. I'm focusing my time on QGIS
Vector Tiles Reader plugin, QGIS bug reporting and providing
educational material for QGIS like OpenSchoolMaps (see English version
of worksheets [1]).

Duh, sent to Nils alone, resending to list ....

@nils: in addition I forgot to tell: please have a look at
https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/qgisnetworklogger a Work in Progress
which will show you all information (url, headers etc) that goes through
QgsNetworkAccessManager and replay it if needed

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde
