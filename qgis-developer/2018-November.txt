Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 2.x and 3.x vertex edtior

Hi,


It was suggested that I forward my feature request from the QGIS issue tracker (https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20250) to the developer mailing list.


Namely: Doubting that I at any point will prefer the 3.x vertex editor, I wonder if it would be possible to reintroduce the 2.x vertex editor. Whether the user prefer the current or previous editor is of course a matter of taste, so not necessarily to replace the 3.x vertex editor, it would be great if there could be an option in the QGIS settings on which vertex editor to use.


Main 2.18 vertex editor pros and cons as I see it:
+ The vertices on the active feature are always visible, which has two important advantages: 1) I can always see the vertex, so I know where I need to point the mouse cursor to grab it. 2) When zooming and panning to other parts of the map to edit other sections, I keep track of which feature it is.
+ The visual appearance of the active feature is calm, with no flashing halo effects as I move the mouse cursor around and across it.
+ There are fewer ("complex") mouse operations (clicks, drawing rectangles) to add, move or delete a vertex.
- It has been replaced :(

And for the 3.4 vertex editor:
- As the active feature is always the one below the mouse cursor, the vertices of the feature I'm editing are only visible when they are directly below the cursor. This has two disadvantages: 1) I have to point the mouse cursor at the feature to see where the vertices are on a feature with few bends, and then relocate the cursor to the vertex I'm after. 2) I might lose track of the feature when I zoom and pan the map to go to other parts of the feature to edit.
- The dynamic highlighting effect applied to the features and vertex below the mouse cursor at any time is in my opinion visually disturbing, both in itself and when moving the mouse cursor across it without the intention to edit it.
- As the highlighting symbol of the vertex below the mouse cursor has a larger diameter than the 2.x vertex symbols, it is more cumbersome and unpredictable in result when adding a vertex on a segment where the vertices are close together.
- There are more ("complex") mouse operations to add, move or delete a vertex.
- There are some operation inconsistencies: 1) Adding a vertex, either single-click the cross appearing on the hovered segment, or double-click anywhere else on the line. 2) To move a two-vertex segment, click the segment and move it. To move a selected multi-vertex segment, click one of the vertices and move it.
- When intending to move a segment, I have to take care that I don't click the cross that appears in the middle of the segment when hovering it, as this will create a new vertex rather than move the segment.

My conclusion: The ease of use and efficiency with the 2.x vertex editor outshines the vertex editors in any other GIS software I know, and the 3.x version is in my opinion a bit strenuous and ergonomically fatiguing in comparison when doing heavy vertex editing work.

Thanks,
Anders Skoglund

2018-11-02 is good for me. I'm working on a fix for
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20312 now which should be ready for

Nyall, thanks for having raised this (and fixed that horrific regression).

Jürgen, thanks for that extra flexibility, much appreciated.

I'm a lurker who has not contributed to qgis, but someday might.  Within
pkgsrc.org, a multi-os multi-arch portable packaging system, I'm one of
the people that most frequently gets asked license questions.  I
maintain the geos/postgis entries in pkgsrc.

I have contributed to a number of open source projects -- but I tend to
find something else to do when I'm asked to sign any kind of CLA or
copyright assignment.

I think there are multiple things going on:

  How do people feel about accomodating Apple's ban on GPL software for
  the iOS app store?  People have talked about qgis having an exception,
  but nobody has brought up talking to Apple to get them to change their
  terms.  I suspect those who really believe in the GPL's purpose don't
  want to make an exception, and there will be enough such people that
  rewriting all their code is not sensible.

  Evolution of the license as the licensing landscape change.  If we are
  talking about changing GPL2 or later to GPL3 or later, that seems
  straightforward, and I think all it takes is for core to accept some
  nontrivial code that is GPL3 or later.  There is the serious question
  about not letting people copy/modify/redistribute under GPL2, but
  that's a group social question, not something that needs every
  contributor to sign off on.

  Change to permissive.  Perhaps because of wanting to accomodate Apple,
  or for other reasons, some may want a permissive license.  This is a
  huge cultural change, and I would expect a significant number of
  people would not be ok with this.

  Copyright assignment.  This opens up the fear of a change in license
  later (to permissive or to accomodate Apple's GPL ban), which leads to
  wanting to have terms in the assignment that constrain the future
  choice.  And it means asking people to sign copyright assignments
  before their code can be merged.  In my view, this alienates potential
  contributors.  So if qgis stays on the GPL "N or later" track, I don't
  see why this helps, and it will definitely hurt.

I'm done now. Not sure if anyone else has any last minute bug fixes planned?

Hi,

Indeed, neither 3.4 nor 3.5 help buttons are redirected to testing manual.
You get a 404 page trying to open a page.

Hi Peter


So I tested your installer and it works nicely! My main comments and questions are:

1) Extended support for GDAL plugins - William’s installer goes to lengths to install lots of nice gal plugins etc. Will you be following suite?
2) Code signing. The experience is somewhat reduced if the user has to create a security exception. There have been long discussions about this (see e.g. https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-psc/2015-October/003315.html). IIRC OSGEO has the cert that we could be signing with, it would be nice to have everything signed and instantly usable.
3) DMG versos PKG - did you bundle in a pkg just for the license / readme step? Otherwise not just share it in a dmg?
4) The package is nice and small - I was quite pleasantly surprised because I think Larry had told me their experiments with creating an application bundle resulted in a ~1gb .dmg
5) Giving the app a versioned name e.g. QGIS3.4.0 would be nicer so we can drop different versions into our /Applications folder and switch between them as needed
6) The readme popup on installation doesn’t look too good in dark mode

I didn’t test lots of things like using the App bundle for python dependencies in my IDE/standalone python stuff, GRASS support etc. etc. but I will say that having an all in one application bundle is something I have long wished for, and if we could have a code signed app bundle it would make the general experience of drag and drop installation so nice and intuitive. That said I also love the application package approach from William with shared frameworks and all the little details he takes care of to make things ‘just work’ on MacOS - it would be great if you and William could work together to take things forward.

On the technical side when you build the pkg did you end up doing it all as a make package step with CMAKE that grabs all the deps out of brew and drops them into the bundle then runs otool on them to fix the library paths or did you manage the process externally from CMAKE using e.g. a bash script?

Regards

Tim

let me second this - I have been watching this relative lack of
cooperation around MacOS packages, and I believe it's a pity. If
QGIS.ORG can do something to make cooperation easier, please let us know.
All the best.

On my list to add as many plugins as possible. Best to add ticket in the
repository if you miss some particular plugins.

Definitely on plan, we have bought Apple certificate for Lutra and ordered
mac on cloud server, so next installer will be signed with our key for
beginning.

It is dmg. I used https://github.com/andreyvit/create-dmg.

I think that it is very likely that you may end up with multiple instances
of the same library on various places (e.g. QT). I tried to remove
duplicates and create symlinks.

Good idea.

Created ticket for it.

It would be great and I am very open to closer cooperation.

I used homebrew for dependancies and build QGIS with it. To add Qt,
libraries, frameworks and python stuff, I used python script that can be
found here: https://github.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-mac-packager
This eventually could be ported back to CMAKE scripts if we decide to go
that way.

Peter

Hi Luigi ,


Thank you for your email on this important topic. Please feel free to make use of any background materials from the  open letter that I send in November 2017 to RGS (UK) requesting to support open principles in Geoeducation and include Open principles in the Geography Ambassador Program .


Details at http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geoforall/2017-November/004296.html



I also send an open letter in June 2015 to AAG  to include Open Education principles and FOSS4G tools firmly in the ConnnectED concept to support the  Advanced Placement course in Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIS&T)


Details at https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/ica-osgeo-labs/2015-June/001742.html


It is important to make use of free and open source tools also in geoeducation, so there is no proprietary vendor lock in and students from economically poor communities worldwide can also benefit from entrepreneurship and innovation opportunities in GIS.


I am happy to volunteer any help that you need for this.


Best wishes,


Suchith

Hi

In Spain, but I suppone in every place of the world, there are many schools, universities or institutions that are dumped with free licences to their users. This happen especially in school and univerisities.

Do we have best practices (e.g letter templates) describing the effect to teach proprietary GIS sw respect open/free solutions?

whould be fine to have a template that could be enriched with national or regional laws.

regards

Luigi Pirelli

Message-ID: <CACfnYnRFAi=CNaN-F0S5SXhnEozN4Dxamgx+qnyJ752eOO3+MQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

are there any known issues with QGIS Server 3.4 (on Ubuntu 18.04 here)?

I'm trying to test it as I would do with a QGIS Server 2.*
installation and it does not work here:

trying a simple GetCapabilities (via Apache2) on a sample project I
always get error 500 ("End of script output before headers:
qgis_mapserv.fcgi" in the Apache log).

Directly from the CLI I noticed that qgis_mapserv.fcgi returns an
error if the project file is specified by using an absolute/relative
path (it works only if calling qgis_mapserv.fcgi from within the
folder where a project file is).

Any hint?

thanks in advance

Hi Giovanni, 

As far as I know, the X-Server is still necessary - also in QGIS Server
3.x 

It is a limitation from the qt library, not from QGIS. 

The other thing to check is the LD_LIBRARY_PATH - if it is correctly
defined. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

is a pity because (at least on 2.18) there was no way to worksaround
this problem on Windows (not that I care personally about Windows
servers, but many people do).
Hopefully is not the same with QGIS 3(?).

I have just completed a test on a completely clean Ubuntu 18.04 Server

So I have probably a messy system, sorry for the noise

Hi Giovanni, 

Glad it works on a new machine. 

But it shows, that to find out what is wrong with QGIS server, is often
a difficult challenge. 

The error message 

error 500 ("End of script output before headers:
qgis_mapserv.fcgi" in the Apache log) 

tells you absolutely nothing what might be wrong with QGIS Server. 

Even experienced QGIS server users struggle with finding problems in
QGIS server. 

If we could improve this situation about more meaningful error messages
from QGIS server, it would be a big, big plus! 

Greetings, 

Andreas

This message does not come from QGIS but from the web server and it usually
means that QGIS crashed, there is no possibility to set an error message
from QGIS in that case.

I guess it should be possible to LD_PRELOAD libsegfault in there or
harness it in some other wrapper to log meaningful debug information
somewhere?

Not much experience though, just a random thought to get someone started
with debugging in case he's left with this situation and no clue how to
solve it.

I would say that QGIS 3 server (we are running 3.4 since it has been
release) is working very well for us, both in development and production
environments, even with projects exposing several GB of data (raster and
vector); we had only some issues with false 'out of memory' errors related
to GetLegend and symbology in map units.

We are using it as a Docker container that exposes both HTTP (for
development) and FastCGI (to be used with a reverse proxy) endpoints. The
container is built starting form Fedora and QGIS RPMs.

Cheers,
Daniele

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Editing topology data
Message-ID: <CALc8-VKDme0FN=67-Zbnft=RJhCfmHSmedub6p=UQ+9faBf41g@mail.gmail.com>

QGIS is based on simple features and handles topological data (e. g. GRASS
layers) as such.
Recently I had to deal with a dataset made with Topobase (now Autodesk) on
Oracle Spatial (topology). I proposed to migrate it to PostgreSQL/PostGIS
as a topological dataset, withoud degrading it to simple features.
Handling it using Sandro Santilli's PostGIS Topology Editor could be a
possibility, but it was not upgraded for a long time and it does not seem
to be a long term solution.
What is the future of topology in QGIS? Handling topological vectors has
been substantially enhanced, but what about the data? How to deal with the
problems that the plugin (partially) tackles? I see a wide area for
enhancement proposals, but they are maybe off topic, maybe GRASS is the way
to go, without bothering QGIS.
What do you think?

It's in my interest since long. Unfortunately it requires a non
negligible investment, and nobody yet has expressed interest in funding
it. Perhaps you can help here?
All the best.

Message-ID: <1dabf733-f29e-348b-c9b3-e896c39eed81@gmail.com>

Hi,

I try to get QGis server to work on a new Windows Server 2016 machine 
using the OSGeo4W64 installer.

When executing the fcgi application using the command line I get an 
error saying:

Couldn't load SIP module. Python support will be disabled.
Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<string>\", line 1, in 
<module> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qgis.PyQt'

This I don't understand. Qt5 and Python 3.7.0 installs as well when you 
select the qgis-server package in the OSGeo installer and you can get 
qgis.core to work in Python setting the correct path in PYTHONPATH but 
pyqt is nowhere to be found (actually there is a pyqt5.dll in 
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Qt5\plugins\designer but setting the path to it 
doesn't seem to help).

Why do one need the PyQt module at all in qgis server? Does it have 
anything to do with the X Server?

best regards

Henrik

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing Plugin - Can a feature sink add
	additional fields afterwords?
Message-ID: <CABPxTTpk5EUqrC+WwfQAQnM7Ew4L+quKZNQ-Vcc4xc0D88nrvQ@mail.gmail.com>

In my KML Tools processing plugin algorithm I create a feature sink as
follows:

(self.sinkPt, self.dest_id_pt) = self.parameterAsSink(self.parameters,
                self.PrmPointOutputLayer, self.context, fields,
                QgsWkbTypes.Point, epsg4326)

'fields' is of type QgsFields which are my predefined field names.As I am
parsing a KML file, I may find that there is extended field data. Is it
possible to add additional fields to my QgsFeatureSink on the fly or do I
need to do a first pass through the data to determine all of the possible
fields?

I am guessing that I will need to preprocess, but that effectively doubles
the time it takes to process the KML and I am trying to make this as fast
as possible.

I could process the entire file to objects in memory and then write them
out, but I don't like doing that in case they are very large files.

Do you have any suggestions?

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi all,

Is this an agreement?
Can we bump to 5.9?

I don't have anything to add - dropping xenial support after 3.4 is fine with
me.

Hi,

There's something weird going on in the Processing script editor. It
mangles the code it displays, as reported in
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20349

It happens on Windows and Mac. Can you reproduce it on Linux?

Regards,
Anita

Sorry to jump in but I have a problem with my QGIS SERVER 3 installation and
I think this might be the right place to post it.

First of all, let me tell you that i already post my problem on 
gis.stackexchange
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/301305/qgis-server-3-service-service-unknown-or-unsupported> 
,  QGIS BUG REPORT 18230 <https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18230#note-13>  
(closed but related), and finally  github QGIS PR 6502
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6502#issuecomment-434884447>   (closed
but related)

The problem I am having> I installed QGIS SERVER 3.4 on a virtual machine
with Ubuntu Server 18.04 bionic.

I followed along the  official training docs
<https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/training_manual/qgis_server/install.html>  
(also for  version 2.18
<https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/training_manual/qgis_server/install.html> 
) and at the end all seemed to be working - doing curl
http://qgis.demo/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi I receive:

<ServiceExceptionReport version="1.3.0" xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/ogc">
 <ServiceException code="Service configuration error">Service unknown or
unsupported</ServiceException>
</ServiceExceptionReport>

However, when I move on to lesson  Serving WMS
<https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/training_manual/qgis_server/wms.html>  ,
download the demo data from  here
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Training-Data/tree/QGIS-Training-Data-v2.0/training_manual_data> 
, unpack the qgis-server-tutorial-data in my /home/ubuntu/qgis/projects/
folder and do curl
http://qgis.demo/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=WMS%26VERSION=1.3.0%26REQUEST=GetCapabilities%26map=/home/ubuntu/qgis/projects/qgis-server-tutorial-data/world3.qgs,
I still receive the same Service unknown or unsupported exception.

I also tried to create a personal project using the same version (3.4) of
QGIS DESKTOP and copy the needed files (only a SHP and the .qgs) to the same
projects folder, but with the same result.

Eventually, I paste both the apache and qgis-server logs in order to give a
possible answerer a possibility to dig in this issue. Any help would be very
much appreciated as I am really interested in trying QGIS SERVER. Otherwose,
do you suggest to move to an older version (like 2.18)?

Sorry, everything was ok with my config and QGIS SERVER.
Thanks to  gis.stackoverflow comment to my question
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/301305/qgis-server-3-service-service-unknown-or-unsupported?noredirect=1#comment485177_301305> 
, I found out the problem was in the way I created my URL request and CURL.
Instead of doing curl
http://qgis.demo/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=WMS%26VERSION=1.3.0%26REQUEST=GetCapabilities%26map=/home/ubuntu/qgis/projects/test_qgis/milano_test.qgs
I had to do curl
"http://qgis.demo/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities&map=/home/ubuntu/qgis/projects/test_qgis/milano_test.qgs"
*no %26 instead of &, and the entire URL within double quotes.*

I had a super-brief look into this one. For anyone's who's
investigating a fix, it's something like this:

https://adminswerk.de/python3-unicodedecodeerror-popen/

(But it's not directly that -- if I do the exact same change then I
get a lockup).

Hope that helps!

Hi Martin,

Do you have libpython3.6 installed? (Which is your OS, by the way?)

I have libpython3.6.so installed from libpython3.6 package.
On my Ubuntu 18.04, it is at:

jgr at zoe:~$ dpkg -L libpython3.6 | grep libpython3.6.so$
/usr/lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.6.so

hm, seems to be problem here. libpython3.6 comes with

Is it possible to add additional fields to my QgsFeatureSink on the fly or do I need to do a first pass through the data to determine all of the possible fields?

It's not possible. It could potentially be added to the QgsFeatureSink
API, but you'd run into problems with some underlying datasources not
having supported for creating attributes anyway. (Not all
providers/file formats allow creation of new fields within existing
layers).

	transformation?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgbD7iMz+FmEVxNv9Vin8qdjaFSMVAYSAZiTPb_1bPzKw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

This is a public callout to QGIS developers/support organisations to
see whether there's currently any work underway, or planned to
commence shortly, regarding any aspect of datum transformation within
QGIS.

Specifically,
- is anyone planning on continuing the work begun in 3.0 for extending
the support for datum transform context handling within QGIS to ensure
that more areas of code correctly respect user-set datum transform
settings?
- is anyone planning on upgrading QGIS to utilise the newer proj v5 api?
- has anyone plans for extending the QGIS GUI for transform settings
to take advantage of the work done during the GDAL barnraising
efforts?

I've been in discussion with a potential backer for work of this
nature and would like to confirm that there is no chance of
duplication of effort here.

Kind regards,
Nyall Dawson

I'd suggest defering any substantial QGIS work on that topic to the PROJ 6 
release (temptative release date February 2019) where my current work will 
land (and it is likely that there will be adaptations needed when integrating 
GDAL 2.4 that will rely on PROJ 6). It will likely obsolete a lot of existing 
concepts regarding CRS transforms, and in particular the notion of a +towgs84 
pivot (it will still be available of course). For example, in the "datum 
transformation", instead of having a Source transform and Destination 
tranform, you could have a single Transform field (actually you can already do 
this with PROJ 5). And you will be able to select more existing 
transformations from the PROJ database, taking into account area of interests.

Hi,

Just a note to anyone who upgraded to 10.14.1 and now it is unable to
compile QGIS because of missing NSAppearanceNameDarkAqua symbol.
What helped me is to (re)install headers

open
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg

as suggested
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51274905/brew-install-on-mojave/51277659#51277659

Cheers,
Peter

Hello Peter,

Did you looked into otb packaging scripts[1]. We are providing standalone
binaries linux, windows and osx using them. It is true that python is not
packaged but I don't see this any blocking issue to include python. Incase
of OTB inclusion of python wasn't a requirement or priority for me. You can
rely on osgeo4mac or whatever rather than otb's superbuild setup. Packaging
scripts are mostly cmake and a small percentage of shell scripts.

Hi Dev's & others,

Please let me know if you are all comfortable with current state of the
changelog:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.4-LTR/

I'm planning to get the source of current items to freeze into the
website, and in this way make it translatable, this week.

So IF you still want to add items (OR add some images to current
items... would be cool!), then please let me know, else I'll probably
move it to the website next friday.

Thanks & Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Martin,

I'm currently (on Debian Testing) building fine.

Did you try to build from an empty build dir? Is it possible there is
some old cruft in it?

One thing that caught my eye (in your first email):

'/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.6.so', needed by
'output/lib/libqgispython.so.3.4.1'.  Stop.

You are nog mixing python 3.6 and 3.4 are you?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Certification approval
Message-ID: <C4308A2D-1289-44F6-8100-290089B5CCB1@kartoza.com>

Hi all

Following the PSC meeting tonight it was agreed to use the following text for defining Certifying Organisation acceptance criteria (see below). The requirement for sharing training course documentation is softened which hopefully removes the main point of contention.

Regards

Tim



Proposed Certification website text


The QGIS Certificate Program is designed to promote both community involvement in the QGIS project and quality education for QGIS software. As such the application process requires applicants to both detail their contributions to the QGIS project and make their training materials available for review. Contributions to the QGIS project include activities such as:

	• Development/commits to QGIS
	• Contributions to the QGIS documentation and training materials
	• Translation of QGIS materials
	• Authoring plugins
	• Filing bug reports
	• Financially supporting new feature development
	• Financial contributions to and sponsorship of QGIS
	• Involvement in your local QGIS User Group
	• Publication of open QGIS course ware
	• Authoring QGIS books

You may be required to provide for review the training material for each of your courses. This includes exercises, lectures and data. This material will be reviewed by the certification programme leads for currentness, accurate representation of the QGIS project and overall quality. If the material is not of adequate quality, this can be cause for refusal.

Following an initial review, the application will be sent to local QGIS groups for their opinion. This portion of the review should take place in less than one month. If there is not a local QGIS user group in your country or region, the QGIS Project Steering Committee (PSC) will make a determination based on material provided and your reputation in the community. In this latter case you are encouraged to establish a local QGIS User Group. If you are not deemed to be a member of the QGIS community in good standing this can be cause for refusal.

The PSC will make the final determination as to whether your organization may issue official QGIS Certificates. If accepted as a QGIS Certified Organization your contributions to the project may be published for transparency.

If approved you are required to make a €20 donation to the QGIS project for each certificate. This creates a mechanism for financial support of the project.

I don't think so, 3.4.1 is a QGIS version, not Python.

I checked

martin at debian:~/src/qgis/build/output/python/qgis$ ldd _core.so
    linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff6ac98000)
    libpython3.6m.so.1.0 =>

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Suitability of backporting browser layer preview
	feature to 3.4?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgTJXqcKgMR7NuFPD9vWUO-5KPf4cPZD_T5Qyd1ogZnzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I'm looking for thoughts on whether it's suitable for backporting
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/17447e4b from 3.6 to 3.4.2.

The rationale here is that the loss of layer preview functionality is
a functional regression from 2.18 (due to us completely dropping the
standalone browser application in 3.0). The changes are quite small
and self-contained (a lot of that commit has already been backported
via other bugfixes).

I've had one customer already question how they can preview layers in
3.x as a result.

Is this suitable for a backport?

Absolutely. It was the right move to not add that as part of backported
browser panel fixes for emergency 3.4.1, but it should ultimately be in the
LTR to fix a feature gone missing regression.

That will verify that the build dependencies are there and also have a cmake
call with the parameters used for the regular build, which you can compare
to what you use.

Message-ID: <96cd4849-7e2b-4ceb-b467-744cf44c2506@faunalia.eu>

Hi all,

sorry to raise this topic again. I had a look at other threads in the
mailing list but those solutions are not working with mu current
installation.

The problem is simple: I cannot see qgis custom widgets in Qt5 Designer.

I compiled current QGIS master (3.5) with the flag WITH CUSTOMWIDGETS
sets to on, but still the widgets are not available in Designer.

If I do some locate and greps in the shell these are the results:

matteo at debian:~$ locate libqgis_customwidgets
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer/libqgis_customwidgets.so
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer/libqgis_customwidgets.so.3.1.0


matteo at debian:~$ locate customwidgets | grep py
/home/matteo/lavori/QGIS/QGIS/python/custom_widgets/qgis_customwidgets.py

SO I think that qgis_customwidgets.py are not copied in the correct
location. Even if I put it manually in the directory, Designer still
does not show them:

matteo at debian:/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyQt5/uic/widget-plugins$ ls
__pycache__      qgis_customwidgets.py  qtcharts.py
qtquickwidgets.py      qtwebkit.py
qaxcontainer.py  qscintilla.py          qtprintsupport.py
qtwebenginewidgets.py


Is anything I can do to have them back?

Thanks for all the hints

Cheers

Matteo

Thanks Calvin for checking.

The workaround (Linux debian) I found is copying the files of the
output/lib directory (libqgis_customwidgets.so and
libqgis_customwidgets.so.3.5.0) manually in
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer and removing the old
files within this directory.

After this manual copy I can see them in Designer.

Cheers

Matteo

OK, a compromise: I simplified the installer.

- python still uses an external download and install.

- QGIS and GDAL combined into one installer.  But, GDAL is still installed globally, not bundled in QGIS.

If you downloaded it today but it didn't work, try again, I fixed a problem just now.

Thanks WIlliam!

BTW from your package I downloaded two days ago, the MacOS theme option is completely missing, I get only “Windows" and “Fusion” in the them combo box. Do you still have wierd theme issues on your system?

I did not see any macOS option at all when I compiled 3.4 for the first time.  Maybe that's why there was a problem - it remembered the macOS option from the previous run of 3.0 and 3.2 that did have that option.

Probably something to do with switch to Qt 5.11 from previous 5.9.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Vertex Tool for current layer don't work
Message-ID: <CAGvsbY5RRLb1f9GCSmsmTJRwZS26zNfEpzaCm2FSEkcu6r3i_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
The new tool for select vertex in current layer doesn't work for me,
Both tool select all vertex from all layers.

Computer 1
SO: Linux Mint 19 & QGIS: 3.4.1
Select all vertex always, although you choose "Select vertex from current
layers"

Computer 2:
SO Win10 & QGIS 3.5.0
Select vertex from current Layer always, although you choose "Select vertex
from all layers"

Is this a known bug??

Hi Carlos,

I suspect this is the issue with QVariant and meta enums that affect Qt <
5.6.2, although I don't see clearly in the code where would be the issue.
To confirm, what Qt version do you have on Mint?

Could you do following steps:

1. In console, do: QgsSettings().enumValue( "UI/defaultVertexTool" )
2. Select vertex tool with all layers
3. print in console again
4. Select vertex tool with current layer
5. print in console again

Then can you try also this:
1. QgsSettings().setEnumValue( "UI/defaultVertexTool", "AllLayers" )
2. close QGIS and see which tool is selected by default when you restart
3. QgsSettings().setEnumValue( "UI/defaultVertexTool", "ActiveLayer" )
4. close QGIS and see which tool is selected by default when you restart

Sorry for the inconvenience, but this is hard for me test as I don't have
the issue.

Cheers,
Denis

Probably
QgsSettings().value( "UI/defaultVertexTool" )

Isn't it?

yes, replace all enumValue by value and all setEnumValue by setValue.

Hi devs,

 

After update from Qgis 3.3.x to Qgis 3.4.1, the browser panel became too slow. I had to close it to use QGis.

 

Does someone realized this issue?

 

Sorry if it is not the right place for this,

 

Regards,

 

Jorge Almerio

Message-ID: <7A8620E1-00A2-42BD-9E63-8ED87560AD51@kartoza.com>

Hi All./ Martin


I’m trying to get some mesh data for a presentation to a bunch of climate geeks later today. I tried grabbing a sample dataset from ECMWF/Copernicus like this:

#!/usr/local/bin/python
import cdsapi
c = cdsapi.Client()
c.retrieve(
    "reanalysis-era5-complete",
{
    "class": "ea",
    "dataset": "era5",
    "date": "2018-08-01",
    "domain": "g",
    "expver": "1",
    "number": "0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9",
    "param": "238.140",
    "step": "0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18",
    "stream": "ewda",
    "time": "06:00:00/18:00:00",
    "type": "fc",
    "target": "output",
}, "global-waves-2018-08-01-0600-1800.grib")                                                                          
~                                                                                                                     


When trying to add it as a mesh in Data Source Manager it gives a ‘file not supported’ error. So two questions:

1) anything obvious I am doing wrong?
2) where is the best place to get some demo .grib or NetCDF data that I can use to show off the cool new mesh stuff in 3.4 (with vector arrows etc).

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

I tried your dataset and got the same error in QGIS. Then when I tried to
download the netcdf version (which sometimes works better with mesh in
QGIS):

#!/usr/local/bin/python
import cdsapi
c = cdsapi.Client()
c.retrieve(
    "reanalysis-era5-complete",
{
    "class": "ea",
    "dataset": "era5",
    "date": "2018-08-01",
    "domain": "g",
    "expver": "1",
    "number": "0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9",
    "param": "238.140",
    "step": "0",
    "stream": "ewda",
    "time": "06:00:00/18:00:00",
    "type": "fc",
    "format": "netcdf",
    "target": "output.nc",
}, "global-waves-2018-08-01-0600-1800.nc")


I got he following error:
First GRIB is not on a regular lat/lon grid or on a regular Gaussian grid.
Exiting

For your example, you can use probably one of these datasets (I have tried
aerosols and they seem to open fine in QGIS):
https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/catalogue#/

Let me know if you have any problems.

Cheers
Saber

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] get visibility from layout items with python
Message-ID: <79a8b7e7-76d9-2d25-b64b-dbef1c38a46e@terglobo.nl>

In the python api, QgsLayoutItems have a setter for the visibility, but 
i cannot find a way to retrieve the visibility setting.

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/Layout/QgsLayoutItem.html


I would like to do this:

item = QgsLayoutItemLabel() # I get this from my layout
checkbox.setChecked(item.visibility()) # this fails

and later:

item.setVisibility(checkbox.checked()) # this works


Is this possible in another way? Or is it just missing and can it be added?

Thanks,
Raymond

item.isVisible()

It's from the base QGraphicsItem class.

Thanks Nyall, works!

I'm also using setVisible() now, instead of setVisibility(). But now I 
wonder why the latter exists.

Check the API dox -- there's a specific note there that you need to
call setVisibility instead of setVisible, or visiblity won't work
correctly for some items (like groups).

(Unfortunately QGraphicsItem::setVisible is not virtual, so we can't
override that... hence the ugly api here).

Thanks. I read that but I didn't get it. So I should use setVisibility() 
instead of setVisible(), right? (They both work on QgsLayoutItemLabel btw.)

Hi Tim/Peter,

I have updated the ticket. I think at the moment only grib/netcdf supported
in gdal can be read as mesh layer.

Here is an example I have prepared for mesh layer, feel free to use this
QGIS project:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/az6l00c67qq5pzl/mesh_layer_weather.zip?dl=0

There are some bugs (-180, 180 coverage, projection) with mesh, which we
will be working on.

Feel free to file bugs or feature requests. Will be keen to hear your
feedback.

Regards
Saber

Hi there  
  
After there has been some field-tests of the QML Widget, we recognized that the qt5-qml library used on runtime is not  installed per default.  
This is no problem doing it manually, but it would be more comfortable for users to have it per default?  
Would that be possible?  
Thanks and regards

Assunto: Browser Panel too slow Issue

 

Hi devs,

 

After update from Qgis 3.3.x to Qgis 3.4.1, the browser panel became too slow. I had to close it to use QGis.

 

Does someone realized this issue?

 

Sorry if it is not the right place for this,

 

Regards,

 

Jorge Almerio

Hello,
in the user list, no-one could help me, can you?
sorry if I'm badly using this developer list




In QGIS 2.18.23, I´m using the model "Execute SQL" from the Tollbox to run the statment:

"SELECT * FROM input1 ORDER BY TALHAO ASC;"

​where "TALHAO" is the name of a colum with integer values.



My issue is:

I made a Model with several steps, and I need to put this SQL statment in the middle of it,

but this process never accept a output as input.

For example: if the "Execute SQL" is the first step, it will execute normally,

but if it is not the first one, I got this error:



Error executing algorithm Execute SQL

virtual: Cannot find layer OUTPUTALGQGISDISSOLVE1_shp20181015165259558

Searching in the %temp% folder, this output file do exist!



I made another attempt,

with the SQL as first step,

if the input shape is named starting with letter, it will run

if the input name´s starts with number, a got this error:



Error executing algorithm Execute SQL

virtual: Query execution error on DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "input1"; CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE "input1" USING QgsVLayer(81121_463_DE20181015165152041);: 1 - unrecognized token: "81121_463_DE20181015165152041"





I can´t understand why sometimes this algoritm run, and sometimes not

I would appreciate some help



Thanks for the Attention

Yes - it's safest just to use setVisibility everywhere.

Thanks for the feedback here -- it's much appreciated.

I feel there's been substantial misunderstanding of the original
intent of my email. It wasn't designed to address any *specific*
licensing issues such as the issue with Apple's app store. (And, on a
practical level, this is a VERY REAL issue, limiting some value of
QGIS). That's all secondary to the discussion I was hoping to raise
and should be deferred to a future discussion if/when needed/possible.

(Gosh, I can't think of how to word this well... I'll just plough
ahead and hope my intention gets through)

Up front, know that I'm a staunch open source supporter, both from a
practical and idealistic view. I'm not interested in closed source
software and likely never will be.

I strongly believe that the QGIS project has a fantastic governance
structure, and one which is a role model for other
projects/communities. This is all thanks to the hard work and tireless
efforts of the PSC and other members of the community. It's something
we should be intensely proud of. I know I am! In fact, I've seen time
and time again how good project governance and community in open
source projects is often worth FAR more than the code itself.

I personally feel that the project governance structure is so strong
that I'm willing to trust it with complete ownership of YEARS of my
development work*. I've complete confidence in the project governance
that they have (and will remain to have) the best interests of the
QGIS project at heart. And in order for them to continue doing what's
necessary to ensure survival (and dominance! ;) ) of the software, I
think it's important that the organisation has some avenue in future
to be able to relicense the codebase IF there's a compelling reason
why they think it's required.

Putting it another way: if, for whatever reason, the current license
becomes a roadblock in future which threatens the future of the
software, what do we do? I'd hate to see something like this occur and
result in the project, and all the years of effort which has been put
into it, being abandoned because we have no course of action to
address this.

I 100% realise this is a tricky conversation... but that shouldn't
prevent us from discussing it openly and with a spirit of
collaboration. I don't think avoiding tricky discussions just because
they are tricky is ever a good approach.

And hey, my trust in the project governance goes both ways. If they
discuss this topic and decide it's not something they want to pursue,
then I'm fine with that too. Like I said -- I trust them to run the
project and continue to do outstanding efforts on the jobs we've
elected them to do.

Nyall

*  Heck, take this email as a legally binding agreement if you want --
I'm granting the QGIS organisation legal entity any rights they want
to code I've written for QGIS over the years to do with whatever they
want. That's how strongly I trust them.

Perfect -- thanks for the heads up, this is exactly the kind of
feedback I was looking for.

Hi Nyall

Thanks so much for articulating what I couldn’t in your email below. This is 100% what I am after too: A sensible, open discussion with an eye to maintaining the long term survival and success of the QGIS project in a changing world. I agree with everything you said down to the donation of any previous work I have made in the code base to the QGIS.org project.

Regards

Tim

Hi,

There is a bug in QGIS 3.4 which prevents from browsing virtual layers 
in DB Manager.

Changing line 196 in \QGIS 
3.4\apps\qgis\python\plugins\db_manager\db_plugins\vlayers\connectors.py 
from :

for _, l in QgsProject.instance().mapLayers():

to (what it was in QGIS 3.2) :

for _, l in list(QgsProject.instance().mapLayers().items()):

seems to solve the problem.

Tested on W7 and W10.

Hi all,
I'm following this from a distant eye, not being sure to understand clearly
what is propose and what is at stake.

Could someone do a brief synthesis for a broader audience?

Concerning the iOS, a word a the french context. Apple hardware costs are
so expensive that I almost never see any professional GIS application asked
on those platforms. It might be different in the US for sure.
We have more questions about linking QGIS proprietary software in closed
source solutions. And at the cultural moment we see, I see the GPL licence
more as a protection and a way to trigger discussions and cultural changes
than a real break.
We already succeded to change some customers mind to open source their
product. I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't have been possible with a
permissive licence.

Debate welcome :)

Hi Régis!

Your concerns are very valid, but could we defer this to a different
discussion? I really want to avoid this becoming an us-vs-apple/debate
about the merit of specific licenses, and instead allow it to focus
solely on the question: "should the qgis org, with all the checks and
balances it has in place, have the power to relicense the QGIS
codebase (or not)"?.

I'm -1 on this proposal, it's not that I don't trust the PSC (that have
always done an amazing job!),  but perhaps because I'm Italian, I never
fully trust the "government", to me the GPL license is like the
constitution and it's there to protect from the possible abuses from the
"government".

Also, I particularly didn't like the "(8. Replace existing code from any
non-signing contributors)", it sounds like "you don't like that? We don't
need you".

No worries to not talks about Apple stuff here. Still, before discussiing
this:

"should the qgis org, with all the checks and

Can someone explain clearly "Why" ?

Hi,

We talked about this very, very briefly on the PSC - and I can already 
say that the topic is quite controversial within the PSC.

I really don't see consensus here at the moment. And even if the PSC 
wants to move in this direction, it is the voting members who need to 
agree to it - and I personally doubt that a majority of them would 
agree. The PSC (or any voting or community member) can suggest such 
changes, but it is the voting members who decide/vote on it.

@Nyall - if you want to raise such a voting, you are welcome to do so. 
But it needs a proper listing of pros and cons of such a move - and need 
to be prepared to give both sides (the proponents and the opponents of 
such a change) a fair chance to raise their arguments.

There are other open source projects that did such changes - so it seems 
to be possible. But there is a fair chance that it will create a lot of 
harm along the process (e.g. split the community into two parts).

Andreas

However, if we just talk about moving from GPL v2 to v3 - I think this 
would definitely be possible.

A change to a more permissive license is a different thing. There you 
need really, really good arguments to convince the majority of the 
voting members, I think.

Please don't see this as a PSC opinion - it is my own, personal opinion, 
and as I said, the PSC doesn't have an official "opinion" yet on this topic.

Greetings,

Andreas

Perhaps we could ask the OpenStreetMap mailing list for their advice on
licensing?

That was a joke. Let's not ask the OpenStreetMap mailing list for their
advice on licensing.

Message-ID: <CABPxTTqAYDShfEcKV0LR13ciWTWfr5vqkF1wrEv8tS=9tF-YGQ@mail.gmail.com>

I installed the stand alone QGIS 3.4.1 for Windows 64. If I go into the
options and click on the OK button I get the following error:

Wrong value for parameter "GRASS7 folder":
Specified path does not exist:
C:\PROGRA~1\QGIS3~1.0\apps\grass\grass-7.4.0

The version of GRASS that is installed is 7.4.2 so the variables were not
updated correctly.  In the Advanced options under Processing->Configuration
the variables GRASS7_FOLDER and GRASS_HELP_PATH are incorrect. I fixed
those, but I still get this error message. This appears to not be a part of
processing so what other variable is incorrect and how do I fix it?

Thanks,

Calvin

Is there documentation on this or guidance on how to make it work?

On mingw, cygwin and ubuntu this gives the message
qgisstyle / astyle not found - please install astyle >=3 or enable 
WITH_ASTYLE in cmake and build

The latest version of astyle on cygwin and ubuntu is 2.05.

I modified astyle.sh on my ubuntu system to allow a minimum version of 2 
which allows it to do something but it gives the messages
flip not found
autopep8 not found

The astyle diff output includes the source code that was copied directly 
from the mssql provider.

Numerous new files are created with long names.

Did you try this? If you enable this cmake option, an updated custom
astyle executable will be built alongside qgis.

Sometimes you have to restart QGIS to get changes to the GRASS
provider settings to "stick".

This is really messy -- i'd love to see a PR which fixes this issue.

Hi all,

thanks for this discussion. I'm also pretty sure getting a property
transfer from all developers will be difficult if not impossible (quite
a few devs even disappeared from the radar, not easy to find them again).

A possible intermediate step would be to:

* get the transfer of code property to QGIS.ORG only from those
developers who are happy to do it

* ask a more specific question to others (e.g. are you willing to move
from GPL2 to GPL3?).

I think this is more feasible, will help building trust, will help
moving forward, and will make it easier (less people to contact) to do
further changes in the future.

All the best.

That makes sense, but wrapped up in that question is:

  what is the reciprocal covenant about future licensing that goes with
  the copyright assignment?

or perhaps you really mean "assignment with no reciprocal covenant at
all, from those who are happy to do it".

The FSF assignment form that my company executed long ago (for
contributions to GNU Radio) had a covenant to make the code available
under Free licenses (and I can't remember the exact details), plus a
grant back to the contributor of a license under copyright law.

This text is old, but is an example

  The Foundation promises that all distribution of the Work, or of any
  work "based on the Work," that takes place under the control of the
  Foundation or its assignees, shall be on terms that explicitly and
  perpetually permit anyone possessing a copy of the work to which the
  terms apply, and possessing accurate notice of these terms, to
  redistribute copies of the work to anyone on the same terms. These
  terms shall not restrict which members of the public copies may be
  distributed to. These terms shall not require a member of the public
  to pay any royalty to the Foundation or to anyone else for any
  permitted use of the work they apply to, or to communicate with the
  Foundation or its agents in any way either when redistribution is
  performed or on any other occasion.

Hi all,

where do I find how to enable OpenCL support? I have not found anything
on INSTALL.

I have installed:

beignet-opencl-icd/testing,now 1.3.2-4 amd64 [installato]
ocl-icd-libopencl1/testing,now 2.2.12-1 amd64 [installato]

[installato, automatico]
opencl-headers/testing,now 2.2~2018.05.14-gde26592-1 all [installato]

but cmake gives:

-- Could NOT find OpenCL (missing: OpenCL_LIBRARY) (found version "2.2")
-- Couldn't find OpenCL: support DISABLED

Thanks for any hint.

All the best.

I'm not a Debian/Ubuntu user, but I guess you are missing
the *ocl-icd-opencl-dev* package.

Hi Paolo,

this is enough for building with OpenCL support on Ubuntu (debian should be
the same):
apt-get install -y opencl-headers ocl-icd-libopencl1 ocl-icd-opencl-dev

To actually run OpenCL applications  you'll need also the runtime for your
graphic card or for your CPU (or for both), there are packages for Nvidia,
ATI/AMD and Intel.

Thanks a lot. Confirmed:

Hi,

thank you for all suggestions and feedback.

I think we managed to finish my small prototyping exercise for packaging.
We got Apple certificate for Lutra and Mac server on cloud that compiles
and pushes nighty QGIS builds to Dropbox. All code/server setup that is
used on the server is in the github repository. On top of that, we build
LTR (ltr-3.4 tag) and PR(final-3.4.1) tag occasionally (more precisely when
https://github.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-mac-packager is changed or tag is
moved).

Please see https://lutraconsulting.github.io/qgis-mac-packager/ and if you
have time to test and get back to me with issues or feedback.

Once the package is properly tested and I am confident it works solidly,
the next steps are probably open QEP and discuss how to do packaging as a
community. If anyone is interested in meeting or discussion please let me
know.

Cheers,
Peter

Hello,
in the user list, no-one could help me, can you?
sorry if I'm badly using this developer list




In QGIS 2.18.23, I´m using the model "Execute SQL" from the Tollbox to run the statment:

"SELECT * FROM input1 ORDER BY TALHAO ASC;"

​where "TALHAO" is the name of a colum with integer values.



My issue is:

I made a Model with several steps, and I need to put this SQL statment in the middle of it,

but this process never accept a output as input.

For example: if the "Execute SQL" is the first step, it will execute normally,

but if it is not the first one, I got this error:



Error executing algorithm Execute SQL

virtual: Cannot find layer OUTPUTALGQGISDISSOLVE1_shp20181015165259558

Searching in the %temp% folder, this output file do exist!



I made another attempt,

with the SQL as first step,

if the input shape is named starting with letter, it will run

if the input name´s starts with number, a got this error:



Error executing algorithm Execute SQL

virtual: Query execution error on DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "input1"; CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE "input1" USING QgsVLayer(81121_463_DE20181015165152041);: 1 - unrecognized token: "81121_463_DE20181015165152041"





I can´t understand why sometimes this algoritm run, and sometimes not

I would appreciate some help



Thanks for the Attention

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Get the Canvas CRS in Expression
Message-ID: <0aca4280-621c-d5bc-d244-9cc358e47afb@gmail.com>

Hi Dev,

I need to get the canvas CRS in an expression.

It's possible to get the layer CRS with the method layer_property

It's possible to get some data of the map like map_center, 
map_extent_height, map_scale but I didn't find how to get the map_crs.

It will be useful for exemple to only display the labels of features 
nearest the center point. If the layer and the map are not in the same 
CRS, the distance between features can't be used.

Do I have to update QGIS sources or a way to get the canvas CRS allready 
exists ?

Regards,

René-Luc

I can see map_crs under Variables in the Expression editor.

Hi Larissou,

Thanks!

Do you think map_crs, map_crs_definition and map_units could be backported ?

I am not using any services that use the Auth db and I don’t get the error on my own build packages. Have you encountered this before?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Server WFS 2.18 unreliable?
Message-ID: <38048cd635d3f06aee8bb75dd4643241@carto.net>

Hi, 

I am trying to publish a WFS Service through QGIS Server 2.18. 

However, the result I get back from GetFeature errors out. 

The XML stream starts correctly and after a while there is an HTML error
snipped and as a result a non-wellformed XML response. 

this is my URL: 

https://services.geo.zg.ch/ows/Gewaessernetz?SERVICE=WFS&REQUEST=GetFeature&VERSION=1.0.0&TYPENAME=zg.gewaessernetz&SRSNAME=EPSG:2056&OUTPUTFORMAT=GML3


Sometimes it works, but most of the time it fails. 

Any ideas of what might be wrong? 

Is QGIS Server 3.x more reliable regarding serving WFS? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi,

Looking at the response, I would say that the response output is streamed and there is an exception raised during the streaming of the response. What the logs says ?

Hi Andreas,

QGIS Server segfaults when it try to build the GML for a Feature

The request works for GeoJSON format

Hi Denis,
Sorry for my delay.

I've updated my QGIS to new package and now in my Linux Mint work fine.
I'll continue testing tomorrow using some projects and using another
computer or SO..
Thanks for your time.

Hi,

in QGIS 2 I made a startup script that adds default configuration for new
users in a networked environments, that are launching qgis for the first
time (the script is setting the values on windows registry, i.e. the
proxy).

In QGIS 3 what is the best way to achieve this? I see that there's now
%APPDATA%\QGIS folder.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Cannot load QGIS source code in QTCreator
Message-ID: <CA+nxMTtfkZVh+pCn58XwqBi=kPxp7-i1B9FBnOR6PfAdyh2R0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to load the master branch of QGIS into QTCreator following the
instructions at
https://www.qgis.org/it/site/getinvolved/development/qgisdevelopersguide/qtcreator.html
Trying to load the CMakeLists.txt file fails immediately, and I get this in
the console:

Running "/usr/bin/cmake -E server --pipe=/tmp/cmake-TWdPXn/socket
--experimental" in /home/aaime/tmp/qgis-build.

CMake Project parsing failed.

Parsing of CMake project failed: Connection to CMake server lost.


I've only found this ticket searching the internet, unfortunately, it
contains no workaround:

https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-20972


My environment is a Linux Mint 19, which should be based on Ubuntu Bionic
(I've setup the dependencies as per docs on bionic distros).


Does anyone know of workarounds to use QTCreator?

Or, should I look at setting up using a different IDE?


Cheers

Andrea

Hi,

I am testing the new provider notification system (using Postgres NOTIFY).
But I noitced this strange thing: when I am editing, I see the layer
modifications from another user, but QGIS still remembers the old ones (I
cannot move the modifications, for example...)

it's a known issue?

Hi,
On Debian stretch here, I'm rarely using the QTCreator but I had no problems setting it up.Alessandro has done a nice walk-through on setting up the dev evinronment on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaUVjWnm3KAMaybe that's enough for you until someone with more experience here steps up.

 Hi,I'm trying to load the master branch of QGIS into QTCreator following the instructions at https://www.qgis.org/it/site/getinvolved/development/qgisdevelopersguide/qtcreator.htmlTrying to load the CMakeLists.txt file fails immediately, and I get this in the console:

Running "/usr/bin/cmake -E server --pipe=/tmp/cmake-TWdPXn/socket --experimental" in /home/aaime/tmp/qgis-build.

CMake Project parsing failed.

Parsing of CMake project failed: Connection to CMake server lost.




I've only found this ticket searching the internet, unfortunately, it contains no workaround:

https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-20972





My environment is a Linux Mint 19, which should be based on Ubuntu Bionic (I've setup the dependencies as per docs on bionic distros).




Does anyone know of workarounds to use QTCreator?

Or, should I look at setting up using a different IDE?




Cheers

Andrea

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to get my styling widget back into screen space
Message-ID: <800A1C4B99390947B3BAA86C02CBDB2615C02FA0@S000014.PROD.SITAD.DK>

I have a laptop with two monitors attached. When undocking my laptop, moving to a meeting room with a single projector, presenting something involving QGIS, moving back to my monitors and docking my laptop, Windows 10 resizes my applications and some of them are even returned to the primary monitor. This also happens for QGIS but my undocked styling panel doesn't - its floating somewhere where I cannot see it.

Is it possible somehow to move/return the styling panel (or any other undocked panel) to visible screen space where I can fetch it?

Regards, Casper

Just to follow up on the Saber - I have tried downloading the stable build a few times but it will not open the dmg for me.

E.g. qgis_pr_final-3_4_1_20181112_062000.dmp is not opening for me

Regards

Tim

Hi Lucas,
I suspect you are facing postgres transaction inception. you are trying to
refresh data from the database when you have an edit session opened? Are
you using transaction modes? Are the users modifications done on the same
features you are working on?

I'm not sure this is your issue, but we know that there are still issues
concerning snapping cache when a provider refreshes data in transaction
mode, and that locks are just silent in QGIS. A good addition would be to
raise locks verbosely through the QgsMessageBar.

Cheers
Régis

Hi René and David, 

Thank you for your replies. Interesting to see that GeoJSON works, but
GMLv3 fails. 

In my Apache webserver log I find the following error: 

[Wed Nov 14 14:32:54.580958 2018] [fcgid:error] [pid 13453] mod_fcgid:
process /var/www/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi(22829) exit(communication
error), get unexpected signal 11 

I also checked the geometries of the concenred table in Postgis for
validity. All geometries seem to be valid. 

Do you have any idea what I could do? Or do you think the issue will be
solved in QGIS 3.x master? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Just my two cents:
* try to understand if there are issues with charsets, sometimes you focus
on geometries and don't remember to check for lesser things;
* try to use ogr2ogr to try the conversion. What happens converting your
datasource directly to GML3?

 Two users are edting in QGIS simultaneously from the same postgis layer.
I've tried to refresh, but the data remains in the "old" version (before
editing), so I cannot move points that are in the new position (the other
user has edited those points meanwhile)... I am not sure that you have
understood.

Luca, are you using classical edit mode or transaction group option?
Are users working on the same features ?
QGIS has a local edit buffer and I doubt it is refreshed for features you
modified and did not commit yet, even if you trigger a layer refresh from
the postgreSQL side.
If the other user modified the data in the meantime, there is a postgresql
lock, that you can check looking at pg_stats or pgadmin monitoring tools.
Concurrent editing is a particularly nasty area, especially when cache is
involved :)

Hi, 

Just tried exporting the Postgis table with ogr2ogr to GML. It works
fine without any issue. All characters and geom seem fine. 

Any ideas? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

I would suggest to test with QGIS 3, if the issue remains, please file a
ticket attaching a sample of the failing data, if that's a crash (as I
think it is) it should be easy to debug.

Hi Andreas, you seems to have hit the same issue I found a few months ago:

Yes, this sounds like the very same bug.

Hi all,

Sorry for my previous message, which (I just realize) can appear rude if
you have not received the first one. In fact I sent a "normal" first
message with my Gmail account, and attached some files. Wich obviously was
not allowed by the mailing list. So I decided to create a issue in the QGIS
hub instead. I should have done that first.
Let continue the talk in the hub.

Sorry for this.

Hi all,

the Import alg in Processing is called Export in 3.4, whereas it is
correct in 3.2 and earlier. Could someone confirm?

Hi Paolo,

Not sure, but is this what you mean?


algorithm name:

'Export to PostgreSQL'

description:

Export to PostgreSQL
This algorithm imports a vector layer into a PostGIS database, creating 
a new table.
Prior to this a connection between QGIS and the PostGIS database has to 
be created (for example with the DB Manager).

in the dialog:
"layer to import"


It looks a bit confusing, though it depends on the view point wetter it 
is an import or an export.

Oh, I see, you're right. Not sure it's the right semantic though, I'll have to check similar commands. 
Thanks.

Message-ID: <CABPxTTqqG2-BxN0swRMB1mW4wbQJBwvUSr49Ge71H3wDwMtr_w@mail.gmail.com>

I have added a geodesic transformation function that resizes, rotates, and
moves/translates vector features to the Shape Tools Processing toolbox.
This works independent of the layer CRS or project CRS. The transformed
shapes retain their relative geometry and area even if the source
projection is in degrees.

Eventually, I would like to create interactive geodesic editing tools, but
I haven't had the time to figure out how to do it.

Enjoy!!!

Hi Andrea,

Mmm, I'm running & debugging QGIS in
Qt Creator 4.7.2
Based on Qt 5.11.2 (GCC 8.2.0, 64 bit)
On Debian Testing

And for what I know most people who use an ide to compile QGIS use
QtCreator. Never seen your error message.

Are you sure you have all dependecies? Are you able to just compile it
just using cmake or ninja?

If it helps, this is current configure for me:

 ccmake -GNinja -DBUILD_TESTING=FALSE -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF
-DWITH_SERVER=TRUE -DWITH_3D=TRUE
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/richard/bin/qgis/master/debug
-DWITH_QWTPOLAR=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
-DGDAL_CONFIG=/home/richard/bin/gdal/bin/gdal-config
-DQT5_3DEXTRA_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt53DExtras.so
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/richard/git/qgis/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake
-DQT5_3DEXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/richard/git/qgis/external/qt3dextra-headers
..

Anybody else here seen this msg's, or can help Andrea?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Andrea,

I've never seen that particular error, I'd look into cmake installation
and/or version.

The vast majority of QGIS C++ developers uses Qt Creator on a daily basis
on different platforms, what work for me here is:

Ubuntu xenial

QtCreator: 4.7.2 installed from https://www.qt.io/download
cmake version 3.10.2 self-built from sources
Qt 10.0.1 self-built from sources

Notice that none of the above was installed with apt, the main reason is
that xenial is a little bit old, but IIRC that was also to avoid some
problems in the integration of the different components.

I hope this helps.


Cheers

I see... on my machine I have everything installed from apt instead,
versions are:

   - QT Creator 4.5.2
   - cmake 3.10.2
   - QT is 5.9.5 (you have QT 10 instead??)

 In other comments I've been invited to build from sources using cmake,
which I did, worked, but then trying to start qgis as built results in this:

I'm starting to think I'd be better of using a virtual machine where one
can do any custom setup required.
Someone was hinting at a video showing how to do that, using a vagrant
setup. Is the same also documented anywhere, like,
in text form?

Hello all,

 



I am developping a plugin for QGIS 3.4. In my module irip_dockwidget.py when I try to import PCRaster 4.2. I get this error :

Another point : I developed a command-line version of my application which works well.

My envir : Windows 8, QGIS 3.4 (QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.4.1-1-Setup-x86_64.exe), Python 3.6, PCRaster 4.2

Thanks for your help,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Limitations of the search locator "af" option?
Message-ID: <CAECJsSrgzDuerB6n3pMiDZ3kXjEoSQzbZuKrmHdx4iJUbOEvfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I was about to write an issue report but given that I get a kind of
consistent result, I wonder if it's by design or a bug. so better ask here
before.

I'm exploring the locator feature that searches in all layers , aka "af"
and because it almost never returns something usable to me (I often search
text), i tried to understand its logic and arrived to the following: It
does not search in ALL fields of all layers; it searches ONLY in the field
set as preview field for each layer.

What is a preview field? It's that field in the Display tab of the layer
properties that you choose to show map tips.
By default, map tips option use the first field of the layer; actually
looks like it uses the first field if it's a numeric field (maybe
integer?). Having a string field as first in the layer does not populate
the map tip option: you get a [Please define preview text], also shown in
the locator bar. A bug I should report?

The limitation about the "af" feature not using all fields, if ever that's
true, is mentioned nowhere. Should be, given that the "active layer" option
does browse all the fields and people would expect the same. And the
relation between map tip fields and the locator should be more clearly
visible. I don't know where but...

I could open issue reports for these but would like to know if I'm not
missing something.

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi Harrissou,

It's the "display name" configured in layer properties -> display.
What's shown in the form view of the attribute table.

This way it's highly configurable, what's actually searched for in all
the layers. Especially with numbers it would often be impossible to find
something useful without somehow limiting the attributes which are being
searched.

Regards

Matthias

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Processing "R" Provider -- 3.x beta available
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash4t1B=RxB9-arTzOFsdKRHvxRABYjZx1ikj_L4b6C_XQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi lists,

Just a quick announcement that the Processing provider for R scripts
in QGIS, which was dropped for QGIS 3.0, is now available as a beta
for QGIS 3.4. It's now published as a standalone plugin which must be
manually installed (together with manual installation of the
underlying R software!).

This is a pre-release beta version only -- the script syntax may
change in the final release, so be warned that you may need to update
scripts as a result. But the good news is that this should be 100%
compatible with Processing R scripts from 2.x, with no change required
to the scripts!

To reflect its beta status, the plugin is currently only available via
manual download from GitHub, and isn't (yet) available via the
standard QGIS plugin repository. To install, download the zip release
from https://github.com/north-road/qgis-processing-r/releases/tag/v0.0.2,
and then install via the Plugins -> Manage and Install Plugins >
Install from ZIP tab. After the plugin is installed you'll need to
enable the provider via the Settings > Options > Processing >
Providers > R > Activate checkbox.

Testing feedback is sought and very welcome -- just file issues on
https://github.com/north-road/qgis-processing-r/issues with a detailed
description of any issues you encounter.

This release was made possible thanks to a funding grant by QGIS.org.

Regards,
Nyall

Nyall,

I can confirm the plugin loads without error on QGIS 3.4.1, Ubuntu 16.04
I'll need to find an R script or two to test with.

Thanks this is very appreciated,
Alex

IIRC this was a conscious change, because we're not "importing" from
QGIS into postgres, we're exporting some layer FROM qgis INTO
postgres. Importing would be correct only if the operation was being
triggered from the postgres side (e.g. pgadmin importing qgis data).

It's the same in 3.x.

My 2c: I don't actually believe there's an issue here. QGIS scale bars
*ALWAYS* use ellipsoidal distances, regardless of the projection (and
have for longer than I've been involved in the project, so since some
version earlier than 1.7).
This means you'll see differences between a 1km size grid created in a
some local projection vs the scale bar's size, because the grid size
is a cartesian size measurement based on a projected CRS, vs distances
measured on the ellipsoid. The differences will be more extreme for
CRSes which are bad for distance/area preservation, especially 3857.

I think the solution here is really just education -- we need to make
sure users know that 3857 is unsuitable for anything but web maps, and
that it's THEIR responsibility to make an informed decision what the
correct CRS is for their project.**

uninformed, untrained users pushing out junk results out based on 3857
calculations.

Hi all/Jürgen,

Since the introduction of the exiv2 dependency last week I'm having
trouble loading the nightly Windows releases via osgeo4w. On startup I
just get the error:

Could not load qgis_app.dll.
The specified module could not be found.

(This is despite the qgis_app.dll file being present and correctly in the path).

Is this a known issue?

Eiv2 does not appear to be picked up automatically by the installer as the
mandatory lib. I had to select it manually and all working fine for me.

Thanks for explaining.

Hi

Tested here on macOS QGIS 3.4.1 (Williams build) here:

I installed R.app into /Applications

I unpacked the plugin and in settings for processing providers set my R folder like this:

/usr/local/bin/

To test I ran the R-> test processing module but couldn’t actually figure out how to provide it the inputs it needs to run. Can someone share a ‘hello’ world R processing module that I can use to test more completely?

It might be good to add my notes about paths above  to your README for the plugin because I first tried to use the R executable in /Applications/R.app/Contents/MacOS but that one won’t work.


Regards

Tim

Hi Nyall,

Great work!!!

I tried to install it on Windows 10, but I'm always getting this, when
running the test script:

This algorithm cannot be run :-(
This algorithm requires R to be run. Unfortunately, it seems that R is not
installed in your system, or it is not correctly configured to be used from
QGIS
Click here to know more about how to install and configure R to be used
with QGIS

I've R 3.5.1 (64bits) installed in my users folder
(C:\Users\username\Documents\R\R-3.5.1), I put this path in R folder
setting, without success. I've already tried to add the R path to
environment variables, but again without success.

R works well with RStudio in same machine.

I'm with QGIS 3.4.1 from OSGeo4W 64bits.

Do you have any hint?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Hi Nyall, 
the installation of the exiv2 package helped me as well. There are four exiv2 packages in OSGeo4w setup, maybe you still need the dev package?

Nyall,

Running this on Python Console

import os
from processing.core.ProcessingConfig import ProcessingConfig

R_FOLDER = 'R_FOLDER'

folder = ProcessingConfig.getSetting(R_FOLDER)
os.path.abspath(folder) if folder else ''

bin_folder = folder
executable = 'Rscript'
exec_dir = 'x64'

os.path.join(bin_folder, 'bin', exec_dir, '{}.exe'.format(executable))

I get the correct path to Rscript:

'C:\\Users\\pedro.venancio\\Documents\\R\\R-3.5.1\\bin\\x64\\Rscript.exe'

Have you got "use 64" checked in the provider options?

Yes, this is the conclusion I got after some more thinking, as described in
my last comment in the hub issue.
I have one last question about the *numerical* scale "bar", I guess it is
calculated always in meter, and use the spheroid too ?

We could probably add some warnings in QGIS composer when using meter | map
units such as "Be aware the scale bar length will be calculated "based on
the projection ellipsoid" | "based on the projection planimetric coordinate
system" )

Am I too late for the party? Probably.

Anyway...

>From what I can see there are different sides to this discussion:

* Is a (potential) license change feasible

This question is very hard to answer since there are a lot of
stakeholders and uncertainties attached to it.

I don't know, apparently it has successfully been done before on other
projects (see VLC). I'm not gonna go into much more detail here, as I
don't think I'll be able to help much in finding a final answer here.
The only way to find this answer will be to actually try.

* Is a (potential) license change something we want

This is a question to be answered from each developer's individual
standpoint.

There are so many things in QGIS, where the project structures (with
PSC, voting members and community involved) play a huge rule in what I
do and what happens to the code I wrote. As you all know, I'm still
around, so you can interpret that I am in general happy with what's
happening. All in all, I have a huge trust in these structures. In fact,
I think I tell people similarly often how proud I am of our projects
structures as I tell them about how proud I am of the product itself. I
truly believe, that these structures are sustainable enough to withstand
an unfriendly takeover.

The past has also shown, that forks kept in private (n.b. in a GPL
compliant way) could not stop the main and completely open QGIS to be
the thing that people actually want. The most important part license
wise for me is, that QGIS is freely available for anyone on whatever
platform wherever he may be and that he is able to use its functionality
and adjust it to his needs if he wishes to do so.

Given that, I would seriously consider to give the PSC the power to
adjust the license for good reasons. Ask me and you'll have good chances
to get that. At least I know that in the "worst case" and (totally
unexpected) abuse of those rights we're still be able to fork under the
GPL terms.

Last but not least, a license has been chosen by a person or a group of
people at a given point in time. Knowledge at this point in time by the
people in charge is what is taken into account when choosing a license.
The outside world can move on and change and new requirements to
licenses can come up which are not covered by the original license.

An example: it should be possible to provide QGIS as a service via a
remote desktop like cloud platform and change whatever you want without
being forced to publish the source code with the current license (Note:
I'm not a lawyer). At the same time it's really hard to distribute QGIS
based public code to Apple tablets with the current license (Note: I'm
not a lawyer). Personally I'd prefer things to be vice versa.

Best regards

Matthias

I'm not a lawyer either, but the GPL does not prevent SAAS, AGPL does.

Hi,

Fixed it again manually - I already updated it once (Burghardt reported it
first), but the then running "nightly" build overwroted it - and the current
that should know isn't finished yet…

Thanks Alessandro, that's exactly the point I wanted to make (without
mentioning an alternative).

With the GPL which is in place right now to my knowledge it's possible
to provide QAAS without sharing the code. Sorry that it was possible to
misread the sentence in the complete opposite way.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] MSSQL driver not found & Can't open lib 'SQL
 Server' - QGIS 2.18 LTR on Debian
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO4kxZKpQywXxSn35=ka7QpTZc0OdDwVdeURVTWvk3FU4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to connect to a MSSQL server from a QGIS installed in a Linux
Debian Jessie computer.
I have checked that the credentials are ok with the mssql-client from
Microsoft:

mssql-cli -S myserver -U carto -P ******* -d MyBase

I installed the following packages from debian and Microsoft repos :

curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add -
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/debian/8/prod.list  >
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list
apt-get update
ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install -y mssql-cli unixodbc-dev mssql-tools
msodbcsql17 msodbcsql odbcinst libqt4-sql-tds libqt4-sql-odbc

When I open QGIS and try to set up a connection, I use not DSN, and I put
my server "myserver" as the host. I add the user and password.
Then try to list the databases, but I get this error

[unixODBC][Driver Manager]Can't open lib 'SQL Server' : file not found

I tested with

root at carto:~# odbcinst -j
unixODBC 2.3.1

FILE DATA SOURCES..: /etc/ODBCDataSources
USER DATA SOURCES..: /root/.odbc.ini

SQLLEN Size........: 8

So I checked /etc/odbcinst.ini which seems ok

root at carto:~# cat /etc/odbcinst.ini
[ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server]
Description=Microsoft ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server

Should I install more packages ?  Any help appreciated.

Hi dev,

is it possible to add a custom parameter to Processing scripts UI and
grab its value?

e.g. a custom QDate (or QDateTime) and grab the values as date/datetime?

Thanks for any suggestions

Ok, I have progressed a little bit.
You have to rename the section in the odbcinst.ini file. QGIS and ogr2ogr
expects the section [SQL Server] and not [ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server] as
written by Microsoft package.

Then I can use ogr2ogr to connect to my database and convert some table
with this:
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" "/tmp/Carto.vPole"
"MSSQL:server=myserver;database=MyBase;uid=carto;pwd=*******;" -overwrite
-sql "SELECT id, position FROM Carto.vPole"

Now I need to understand the SQL Server syntax, and understand why I have
hieroglyphs in my text fields (encoding I presume...)

We want to make a function that send all items (mainly labels) to browser and let user set the cotent, then send it back to server and export as pdf.
I can only find itemById<https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/Layout/QgsLayout.html#qgis.core.QgsLayout.itemById>and itemByUuid<https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/Layout/QgsLayout.html#qgis.core.QgsLayout.itemByUuid>, but there are all kinds of layouts.
Is there a way to get all items and their ids?

You should be good with 5.9, I have several kits with different QT versions
in release or debug mode, this is the script I use to build them:

You might need some more env vars, here is an example of a run script of
mines: http://termbin.com/us9x note that I never run make/ninja install but
I run everything directly from the output dir under the build dir.

Not that I'm aware of, but depending on your needs, you might find it
useful a docker recipe to build qgis from sources:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.docker/qgis.dockerfile

Btw, a Vagrant recipe to build a QGIS development environment ready to go
would be IMO very welcome and would low barriers for new developers.

Hi Song,

It is simply: layout.items()

For example, you can do this:


p = QgsProject.instance()
lom = p.layoutManager()
lo = lom.layoutByName(u'a4')
print(lo.items())


And then this to get all the labels:


for item in lo.items():
     if isinstance(item, QgsLayoutItemLabel):
         print(item)


There was a bug in the item classes recently but it has been fixed in v3.4

Good luck!
Raymond

Hi Michaël,

My first guest is that you need to update your GDAL. I was able to
import MSSQL tables with GDAL 2.3.2. With previous versions, I was
getting those hieroglyphs too.

I've imported a MSSQL Server database to Postgresql that was written by
Geomedia.

To recover the geometry, I had to use the MSSQL function:
geometry_spa.STAsBinary()

Example of the script:

	(...)
	#Export using ogr2ogr
	ogr2ogr -overwrite -skipfailures -preserve_fid -f "PostgreSQL"
PG:"host=$pghost user=$pguser dbname=$pgdb password=$pgpwd
active_schema=$pgschema" -nln $table_name /vsistdin/ <<EOF
		<OGRVRTDataSource>
				<OGRVRTLayer name="$table_name">
					<GeometryField encoding="WKB" field="the_geom" />
					<SrcDataSource>MSSQL:driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL
Server};server=$msserver,59228;database=$mssqlschema;tables=$table_name;UID=$msuser;PWD=$mspassword</SrcDataSource>
					<LayerSRS>EPSG:3763</LayerSRS>
					<SrcSQL>SELECT *, geometry_spa.STAsBinary() as the_geom FROM
$table_name</SrcSQL>
				</OGRVRTLayer>
		</OGRVRTDataSource>
EOF

I hope it helps.

Regards,

Jorge

This is all super-fragile. (Just another symptom of SQL Server's
inferiority IMO).

Have a look at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.ci/travis/linux/docker-build-test.sh#L128
for how the Travis testing environment sets up a connection, there may
be some clues there.

Yep -- see e.g.

Hi Andrea,


sorry, I totally forgot about this:

I did not use it after I created it, so YMMV.

Thanks for your great inputs Matthias. Yes we (Nyall and myself)  probably used some alarming words at the start of the thread like ‘MIT’….but to all reading don’t get sidetracked by that on focus rather on the idea that QGIS as a project should be able to meet future challenges and adapt to them. While some people made dismissive comments about one platform or another, don’t let your personal bias towards or against a platform cloud the issue. If our goal is to make QGIS available only on a platform that we like we miss the point of making a mass appeal GIS that everyone can run on their preferred device. I would far prefer a situation where QGIS.org holds the ability to change licence (think micro-tweaks rather than all out change to MIT or some other license) to meet with changing times. If we want to achieve that, we need to start sooner or later getting past and present contributors to assign their work to QGIS.org. In my mind this is exactly the kind of reason we went to all the trouble of creating QGIS.org and we should use the organisation to our combined benefit. Even if we cannot get every developer to sign over their code to QGIS.org, over time the delta between signed over code and non signed over code will get small enough that we can replace code that isn’t signed over if needed …..


Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] docker, PyQGIS, Travis failing on PR
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+ZP6NPcmLVQY986szGWv3x8-8oRna-iD1=+NqYeHV2f2w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have been working on small improvements on our CI lately. There have been
some nice things coming, but also a few things failing this monday morning.

* New docker images
Since building the PyQGIS API docs requires very recent versions of libs,
two docker images are now built. One based on Ubuntu Bionic where the tests
run fine, and one on Ubuntu Cosmic where we can properly build the API docs.
Added to this, Alessandro also modified the image built (master only for
now) which now integrate QGIS itself. The idea behind this is to test
plugin with a full QGIS running (and not only core libs as before).

* Travis changes
To achieve this, some builds were duplicated. I have reformatted a bit the
files and this is hopefully a tiny bit clearer now (Docker images builds
are explicitly declared in .travis.yml)
The Docker credentials were saved in the Travis online config which
apparently got overwritten by the new "env: global:" in the Travis file. I
have now integrated the credentials in the file. PR were not supposed to
push the base dependencies image to Docker hub this has been fixed.

* PR failing
You should now be able to retrigger the builds on your PR, this should not
require a rebase.

* PyQGIS
The good part is that PyQGIS 3.4 is out https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.4/ and
that the build of the API is now fully working on Travis/Docker.

Sorry for the mess this morning. I'll try to followup if there is any issue

And as a side-note, Travis just replied that our build time was increased
to 150 minutes, this should allow us to build QGIS images even if cache is
not available.

Thank you for your great work Denis!

Would you please tell me when I can rebase and merge the backport for
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8500 ?

Hi Denis,

can you point me to the scripts that build the Python API documentation?

Hi,

I was looking over QGIS server OGC testing site and saw that WMS failed,
for some week or so. Here:

http://test.qgis.org/ogc_cite/wms_130/2018_11_19_06_00/report.html

Is someone looking at this?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS MSsql Provider
Message-ID: <dcf83726-b713-887e-9844-90c4b2a71e17@kommunaldialog.at>

Dear QGIS-Developers

We are  very interessted QGIS Project as we are currently providing 
local authorities in Austira with a Time Based GIS Solution GeoTime 
(http://kommunaldialog.at/index.php?id=45). At the moment we are 
supporting GeoMedia and ArcMap (Oracle and SQL Server). We are planing 
to shift our developement focus from these two GIS-Solutions to QGIS. 
For our costumers it is a must have that the GIS-Software is supporting 
ARCs. Our developement team has reviewed the code of the MSsql provider 
and thinks that the latest version does not support MSsql Server 2012 
(Geometry Version 2) with ARCs. Is there further developement going on 
at the moment to implement ARCs? If not we will have to make the 
necessary developement by ourselves. And of course share it with the 
community. We have a wide experience in developing drivers for various 
GIS solutions (ArcGis PlugInDatasource, GeoMedia Data Server, etc.). It 
would not be a problem for us to develop extentions for QGIS. However if 
there is currently developement in this direction we do not want to do 
work again which has already been done. We would be happy to share our 
expertise with the communtiy.

Best regards from Austria,

Georg Aufhauser

Hi all,

the function seems not to be working in QGIS 3.4.1 on Debian.

Does anyone confirm?

I don't believe anyone else is actively working on this feature, but
it sounds like a very valuable contribution.

FYI - oddly enough, the SQL server provider currently supports ADDING
and CHANGING feature geometries with curves, you just can't READ
these! That's because the write support uses geometry::STGeomFromWKB
and geometry::STGeomFromText to create SQL Server geometries, but read
support is done directly using the raw SQL Server geometries.

Georg,

I'm not aware on any ongoing work related to this addition.
Basically the SqlGeometry parser (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/mssql/qgsmssqlgeometryparser.cpp)
should be extended to accept the curve geometries, but at this point, it
would also be reasonable to modify the parser to build QgsGeometry directly
instead of a wkb, The internal representation of  QgsGeometry has been
changed in the meantime, so creating a QgsGeometry directly would be more
efficient by avoiding the double conversion.

Best regards,

Tamas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Mac OS packages ...again!
Message-ID: <CAH=WbRBEPcQjDMmqAMMt6magNRDewCCv1YkW5JyRfno-NM-EXA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

We managed finally to set up an integrated infrastructure to automatically
create the following packages for QGIS:
https://lutraconsulting.github.io/qgis-mac-packager/

1- QGIS current release (3.4.1): you will get the new packages (e.g. 3.4.2)
on the same day as point release
2- QGIS nightly: generates a new package every day from the master branch
with all the latest features (and bugs!). This is not currently available
from the official QGIS download page.

The packages are all signed and you don't need to circumvent any security
to be able to install them. Everything should work for 10.13 and 10.14 but
with older versions of Mac OS, you may have some issues with Python and
plugins (see: https://github.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-mac-packager/issues).

We will appreciate if you test and report back any problem.
Kind regards
Saber

Hi Tim,

Yes, it should work with 10.13 and 10.14. But for older versions there is
an upstream blocker which we will look into later:
https://github.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-mac-packager/issues/22

I didn’t want to put it int /Applications because that is where my 2.18 LTR lives /Applications/QGIS.app

Are you building Python from source?  I use the python.org binary distribution and have no problems running QGIS 3 on Sierra.  That means they are probably building with an older SDK so those new symbols are not used.

Python is taken directly from homebrew bottle. Worth try with the python.org
package.

Message-ID: <b1eebcb9-16d3-476a-8704-6fba02fbe05e@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
in QGIS 3, the new (non gdal tools) build virtual raster command is
apparently missing an important param:

-srcnodata /value [value...]/

Without this, eventual white collars surrounding a raster will mask
other ones. In these frequent cases, the command is essentially useless.
Could anyone confirm?

Thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Memory utilisation by Qgis
Message-ID: <1fdccbf3-a796-1cad-a5a7-fe63840fa8f8@gmail.com>

Hi

I have some questions about how Qgis engages with the memory management 
system, specifically Linux.

I have had a few crashes on my computer where the software crashes where 
it looks like some sort of memory limit has been reached.

On each time I have seen the software unexpectedly crash the computer's 
physical memory was approximately three quarters used and there was no 
swap being used.

This computer has 32 GB of RAM and 50 GB of swap. The disk that holds 
the swap is an SSD with a / partition and a swap partition, whereas 
/home is on a separate set of disks.

I see the swap being used all the time by other applications but I have 
never seen a swap file being engaged when I am using Qgis, because it 
always would crash or show some other apparent resource-limitation 
behaviour before the physical memory was all used up and no swap was 
being used.

Swap is used regularly by other apps on this computer, notably Gimp.

Hi Paolo,
i can confirm this in 3.4.1 and Master (QGIS code revision 383851c597) under Win7 (64bit).
Furthermore, there is no possibility to edit the command directly in the “GDAL/OGR console call”. Both was still possible in 2.x.

Thanks, ticket opened: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20586

As for the editing of commands, this has been missed during the
migration from GDAL Tools to Processing, a conscious choice.

I also miss it.

All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Running QGIS Python tests inside a real QGIS
	application in Travis CI
Message-ID: <CAL5Q6731wS6BGKAngy5_5t7p-PYbQq5riq+oZ=ZgR7qOks8ozQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

since all the pieces are now in place, I made a little experiment for
running Python tests inside QGIS on Travis and it seem to work well [1]

I don't think that we need to run **all** tests this way, but I believe
that for some tests that require the real iface and a real QGIS
application, this could be very useful.

I'm still waiting to hear from Boundless if they are willing to fund the
additional work required to fully integrate this new possibility in the
current testing workflow but I'd like to know your thoughts on this topic
before proceeding further.

I'm not sure what is the best way to integrate this in the current CMake
configuration, for example: should we create a CMake macro to add these
tests?

many times crash are related to code bugs, can you be more precise?
what qgis version? a reproducible sequence of steps that generate teh crash
(if possible)

btw, the best method is to report this as issue in the issue tracker adding
all info necessary to try to replicate.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Geometry no showing on 3.4.1 on Windows 10,
 but working fine on linux or 2.18
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_HLT3rFFMw_R_UNX2Fus2fFX=rSL0MLjXuR89Nf=aNx4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am having this strange error on Windows, where a layer(shapefile) will
not show specific geometry in QGIS 3.4. Nevertheless, the same layer works
fine on QGIS 3.4 on Linux.

It also opens fine on windows if one uses QGIS 2.18. Saving the file in
2.18 (or on Linux) fixes it for QGIS 3.4 on Windows. Using the geometry
checker, no errors were found on the geometry.

Can this be a possble bug on Windows? Or some option that I might have
activated?

Here's a link for the data.

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

I can see now that GDAL version is different on each OS. Windows is using
2.3.2, while Linux is still at 2.2.3.

Trying to convert the file using the OGR/GDAL algorithm shows the folloing
error:

ERROR 1: Error in fread() reading object of size 232 at offset 100 from

I have just observed the same with QGIS 2.18.25.
Actually, I have seen this with both GeoTIFF
and Shapefile data sources. The extent is
correctly read from the data, the attributes and
feature counts are also ok, but no geometries are
visible. This does not happen with QGIS 2.18.24.
And it also does not happen on macOS. It affects
only some Shapefiles, but so far I fail to see
a pattern. What I can say, is that the problem
is not random: If a Shapefile does not display
on a Windows machine with 2.18.25, then it will
be the same with any other Windows machine
running that version of QGIS.

I can also confirm that exporting a Shapefile
(using "Layer->Save As") from 2.18.24 (Windows)
will make it work with 2.18.25. I suspect a
problem with the  GDAL/OGR libs shipped with the
latest Windows binaries.

Best,

Ben

Since this seems related to GDAL, I am forwarding to their mailing list.

Looking at its
content, I see the file size indicated in the .shp header is not correct.

Has this shapefile been generated by an older GvSIG version ? It pretty
much looks like the issue reported in
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2018-October/049218.html
I've fixed a few weeks ago per
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/commit/5ed09343b361b78ca5dc2fb55ec882be926e515e#diff-3bc1a345a345b6c9b580b2e412464641

This is queued for GDAL 2.3.3

The file was generated in a WEBSIG application, not sure what it uses
behind. I am pretty sure it's not GvSIG, but I will try to find what it can
be.

Thanks.

Hi all,

I have qgis 3.4.1, self compiled on Debian sid. I also have OTB [0]
installed, but I don't have the OTB provider among those available for
Processing.

Anything I should do to enable it?

Thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Error in Processing modeller
Message-ID: <8021640e-4716-f7bb-977e-3264ab155856@faunalia.it>

Hi all,

when creating a model in Processing (QGIS 3.4.1), if one param is
missing (band number in gdal contour, BTW this should default at 1), an
error is thrown [0] before showing the proper error message.

Does anybody confirm?

All the best.

[0]

An error has occurred while executing Python code:

As planned, amongst others, the OTB provider has been removed QGIS core. I
think the OTB folks were preparing a plugin for it.

Best regards,

Hi Alex,

as far as I know, this is what

otb-qgis/testing,now 6.6.0+dfsg-5 amd64 [installato]

should do. The only thing I can imagine is that the package adds otb
support only to the qgis installed from package (in my case, 2.18), not
to the self compiled one. Onyone knows how to add it to both?

All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Change plugin name
Message-ID: <29d913fe-353b-f96c-4bb4-ddaceccf6a36@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm the author of OSM Tools plugin. As several people (rightfully) 
pointed out, the name is way too generic (in my defense, when I set out 
I wanted it to be way more generic).

Now, I'm a few versions in and I think a few people are using it and 
became sorta dependent on it. But I'd like to rename it to ORS Tools, 
since that's much more to the point.

Is there a graceful way to rename a plugin without re-releasing under a 
new name? If not, any recommendations on how to propagate the info?

Thanks

Nils

Hi,

since all the pieces are now in place, I made a little experiment for
running Python tests inside QGIS on Travis and it seem to work well [1]

I don't think that we need to run **all** tests this way, but I believe
that for some tests that require the real iface and a real QGIS
application, this could be very useful.

I'm still waiting to hear from Boundless if they are willing to fund the
additional work required to fully integrate this new possibility in the
current testing workflow but I'd like to know your thoughts on this topic
before proceeding further.

I'm not sure what is the best way to integrate this in the current CMake
configuration, for example: should we create a CMake macro to add these
tests?

Hi list,

Since the minimum QT requirement for QGIS was bumped to 5.9, I have had
trouble building using the system packages.

I downloaded a separate QT 5.9 package, and have been attempting to build
with it it, partly using
https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/blog/2017/08/06/qgis3d-build/.

I am still getting a lot of errors, for example;

/home/stephen/dev/qt_5_9/5.9.1/gcc_64/include/QtCore/QtCore:87:14: error:
missing binary operator before token "("
 #if QT_CONFIG(library)

and
/home/stephen/dev/qt_5_9/5.9.1/gcc_64/include/QtCore/qhashfunctions.h:85:52:
error: redefinition of ‘constexpr uint qHash(long int, uint)’
 Q_DECL_CONST_FUNCTION Q_DECL_CONSTEXPR inline uint qHash(long key, uint
seed = 0) Q_DECL_NOTHROW { return qHash(ulong(key), seed); }

amongst others.

I assume this is a conflict between the QT 5.5 installed as a package, and
the new 5.9 installation. But not sure how to fix it as I have specified
all the new locations in ccmake.

Is there a guide anywhere, or something obvious I am doing wrong, or should
I just cut my losses and move to bionic?

Thanks for any advice

Stephen

Honestly, go this way. If there's nothing holding you back you'll
probably save a bunch of time by just upgrading and moving on. Those
compilation errors look like the sort of thing which could easily
consume a LOT of time and extreme frustration.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QEP 133: An interface and registry for custom
	validity checks
Message-ID: <CAB28Asjk7=XnrzqZ9W4eFnCjcM7F9ZNhHP0DCSu_38Ci_1X4fQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just a quick notification of a recently filed QEP, "An interface and
registry for custom validity checks".

This proposal concerns an interface for custom "validity checks",
along with a corresponding registry of custom checks and GUI widgets
for summarising check results. (THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT RELATED TO
GEOMETRY VALIDITY!)

Initially the proposal is focused toward print layout validity checks,
but the interface has been designed to be generic enough to allow
alternative types of validity checks (e.g. project save validity
checks, processing model validity checks, etc. More details later).

The API is designed to be used both by internal validity checks and
also to be extended by custom, organisation-specific validity checks.
E.g., for print layout validity checks we could have:

In built checks:

- Warn on layout scalebars not connected to layout map items
- Warn on layout map items using known misleading CRSes -- e.g. web mercator.
- Warn on layout map items which include layers with broken data
sources (following earlier 3.6 work on allowing layers with broken
data sources to remain in projects)

Possible organisation specific checks, implemented via Python

- Check for missing items required by internal organisation policy,
e.g. layouts with no scalebar, north arrow.
- Check for layout maps which include layers deemed "bad" by
organisation policy -- e.g. block exports when a layout map item
includes a Google TMS layer.
- Check whether a label item exists with a "copyright ####" string
- Layer attribution checkers
- Spell checker

Please read full details at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/133.
Comments, suggestions and feedback are welcomed!

Hi,

is there a way to configure qgis-server to use an http_proxy when
requesting a remote WMS, e.g. as print layer for background layers? Or
is https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16096 correct and there is no support?

If not, any hints how to implement this?

Incidentally, nothing will launch. I tried going back to previous versions,

BEWARE of this release. Since it is not critical that I get it working
today I will wait to see what the community says. I may need to reinstall
from scratch.

Hey all,

I have put up a new QEP related to making processing scripts a lot easier
to write.  This is a result of running a workshop at foss4g in Australia
last week with Nyall and the feeling that it was just a little too hard for
what should be an easier process.  We had a brainstorming after the session
and have come up with some ideas to make this process a lot easier on
Python devs.

Would really love any feedback anyone has.

This is a result of running a workshop at foss4g in Australia last week with Nyall and the feeling that it was just a little too hard for what should be an easier process.  We had a brainstorming after the session and have come up with some ideas to make this process a lot easier on Python devs.

You say "we", but really, credit goes entirely to you here. You were
the one with the original inspiration and I don't think anyone else on
the team has the Python skills to actually get this wired up and
working!

Anyway, suffice to say that I approve wholeheartedly and am very much
looking forward to see this land!

I see two ways of propagating the info:
easy way: on qgis user mailing list
elegant way: release a new version of your plugin which opens a dialog
after install (or at each startup, but it's a bit aggressive) which tells
your user that the plugin has been renamed.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Curated list of available OSGeo4W Python packages
Message-ID: <ce05d897-3e44-f318-db34-9244faa7c8c6@gmail.com>

Hi again,

I couldn't find a list of packages bundled with a OSGeo4W Python distro.

As that is the most limiting Python API of all OS's and I'd usually like 
to avoid 3rd party dependencies: Is there a list of packages which are 
shipped per QGIS version? If not, I think that'd be a great addition.

Thanks

Nils

I started to write exactly the same :-)  You can also call the plugin 
installer 
API in order to install ORSTools:

import pyplugin_installer
pyplugin_installer.instance().installPlugin('ORSTools', quiet=False)

Uninstalling OSMTools from within itself may be more tricky, but should be 
possible as well. You may need to call the plugin's unload() method 
prior to uninstalling:

self.unload()
pyplugin_installer.instance().uninstallPlugin('opl_bazaprojektow', 
quiet=False)

Also the uninstalling should be the very last line in the function (just don't 
try 
to do anything after it's removed).

Best regards, 

Borys

Why not call the uninstall from the newly installed plugin.
So old plugin says, here get the new plugin at new name.
Then new plugin offers to remove old plugin.

Alex

Hi developers,
I would like to use time animation on server side. I mean I can animate a temporal layer in QGIS desktop application by using TimeManager plugin, but I want to do this in QGIS Server to be seen in a browser.
I have decided to use leaflet TimeDimension plugin to manage time requests in client side, but all WMS in those examples I have found return a full filled <dimension> tag when you do a GetCapabilities HTTP request, and so you can do an HTTP request with TIME=YYYY-MM-DD parameter on url.
How can I generate a QGIS WMS with this time dimension capability?
Any suggestion will be very appreciate.
Thanks in advance.

On Qgis-user an issue was reported with loading HDF5 files in QGIS 3.4
no Windows 10.

I was able to confirm that HDF5 files fail in QGIS 3.4.1, on Linux also.
Not just the user's file but file I also have. In both cases the files
work fine in QGIS 2.18.

This appears to be a regression related to subdatasets (sublayers). No
dialog comes up asking the user which subdataset to load, and hence the
load fails with a Provider is not Valid message.

Only bug info I can find was an old patch that solved this 7 years ago:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/5041

Here's a MODIS image in HDF5 for people to test with.
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hQEi3cRdVRlxih06nbo0gygAvJE08ft7

A secondary, minor issue, the Browser doesn't see the file if it has an
extension beyond .hdf, in this the case .h5 was what the user supplied.

Thanks,
Alex

Workaround, assuming you know which subdataset you want to load (by
using gdalinfo on the commandline). Put the full path in to the dataset.

In a terminal or osgeo4w shell
$ gdalinfo MOD09A1.A2016313.h21v09.006.2016322094441.hdf | grep SUBDATA

copy the line for the layer you want to load
SUBDATASET_1_NAME=HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:"MOD09A1.A2016313.h21v09.006.2016322094441.hdf":MOD_Grid_500m_Surface_Reflectance:sur_refl_b01

Append the full path to the file, example here is /home/user/, like
C:/user/username on Windows.

HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:"/home/user/MOD09A1.A2016313.h21v09.006.2016322094441.hdf":MOD_Grid_500m_Surface_Reflectance:sur_refl_b01

Paste this into the load Raster dialog in QGIS 3.4.1

Not ideal but highlights that the driver is fine, it's just the
detection and selection of subdata layers that's not working.

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Python slots don't get called when they're
	instance methods
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=z5SBTSxCi0wRgEuSffRJZhvmFnU0xtq_W8Y0-YjetKHA@mail.gmail.com>

During the porting of a plugin to QGIS 3.x I'm facing the following when
using Qgs* objects' signals (it doesn't happen with Qt widgets, etc.).
I'm using QGIS 3.4 on Window 10.

If I have a Python class like the following:

>class Foo():
>  def __init__(self):
>    QgsProject.instance().writeProject.connect(self.written)
>
>  def written(self, dom):
>    (do something)

self.written is never called. The signal can only connected to unbound
methods, e.g. to a top level def function or a class method. If I write:

>class Foo():
>  def __init__(self):
>    QgsProject.instance().writeProject.connect(Foo.written)
>
>  def written(dom):
>    (do something)

it works, but in general I cannot make make all my methods class methods of
course!

I've also tried making Foo derive from QObject. I've also tried decorating
"def writter" as a pyQtSlot, but nothing worked.

Is it only me, is it expected or is it a (known) bug?
In case it's the expected behaviour I wonder I the old classe signals like
I  used to write:

>QObject.connect(QgsProject.instance(),SIGNAL('writeProject (QDomDocument
&)'),self.written)

could be ported to QGIS 3

Cheers,
Giovanni

Hmm - this code works fine for me!

class Foo():
  def __init__(self):
    QgsProject.instance().writeProject.connect(self.written)

  def written(self, dom):
    print('bah')

f=Foo()

This is on Linux (Fedora).

So it seems something related to an old issue
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/6573

In effect I've always used old style signals and slots because new style
ones always gave me some problems (on Windows).

I will have to dig into others' plugins to verify.
Anyway it's curious to see that also Processing seems to use a workaround
in its PointTool: it emits its own signal instead of using the
QgsMapToolEmitPoint.canvasClicked signal. I've done the same to circumvent
the issue... But it doesn't apply to all the situations
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/gui/PointMapTool.py

I don't know what happened but now everything works fine. I didn't change
anything, the same example run in console now works. Maybe something
strange within the QGIS session yesterday...
Anyway I confirm the signals connect corectly also on Windows :)

Jorge,

Thanks for testing, after your note I tried on another machine 3.4.2 and
it works. However my original test machine did get the 3.4.2 update and
is still broken.

Both machines are Ubuntu 16.04, QGIS 3.2.4, GDAL 2.2.2
qgis.org + ubuntugis unstable repos

The only difference is the broken one is a chroot env, and not a full
system install. But to me that should be cleaner.

I'm going to try and find additional systems, maybe even windows and
test some more. If others on list can try that would be helpful too.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Tim and all,

We have managed to package QGIS with version number. So, you can have all
versions of QGIS installed side-by-side:
https://lutraconsulting.github.io/qgis-mac-packager/
(master build is in progress and should be ready in an hour or so).

Feel free to test and file tickets.

Regards
Saber
