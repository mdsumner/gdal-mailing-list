Subject: [Qgis-developer] Build error for QGIS release-2_8 under Ubuntu 15.10
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7nernYuyTvHu4CeKHXm9mwpcvVVe35jMPD3noqkrQb-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I got an error concerning
/src/analysis/interpolation/ParametricLine.cc:17:

while building QGIS 2.8, see:
https://paste.sh/w7PBMh0a#-yAkO-sBdT3ZMTiwKf-q9lX4

Has anyone already seen this and find a way around ?

Thanks in advance
Michaël

Yes it is intended. The tools which are not frequently used were
removed from the toolbar to keep UI clean.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Simplify provider side

Hello,

I have made some tests at work on an Oracle 11g database on a layer with 
indexes...
It seems that Oracle simplification is worse than direct data access:

* time for rendering without provider simplification: 10 seconds.
* time for rendering the same layer with provider simplification: 28 
seconds.

I've tried to change the simplification threshold but it doesn't really 
change anything.

Is there a way to go faster than this ?

Ok thanks.

 I will update the documentation then. Because right in the beginning shows
all the icons. I can remove them, right?

Thanks again,

The actions are still in the menu. I would suggest to keep them and
change the text "...provided with the toolbar menu" to "...provided
with the menu" and add something like "Open GRASS Tools and Display
Current GRASS Region actions are also available in the toolbar menu".

Thanks

Hello,

I have made some tests at work on an Oracle 11g database on a layer with 
indexes...
It seems that Oracle simplification is worse than direct data access:

* time for rendering without provider simplification: 10 seconds.
* time for rendering the same layer with provider simplification: 28 
seconds.

I've tried to change the simplification threshold but it doesn't really 
change anything.

Is there a way to go faster than this ?

Hi all,

I would like to apologize : I could not find enough time to finish the
tests regarding this issue, and since I did not have a real-world Oracle
database (and only in Oracle Locator and not Spatial), I did not go
further.
I also seen some poor performance with server-side simplification, but
could not determine why :

* Oracle Locator has native poor perfs ? Would it be better with Oracle
Spatial ?
* I did not configure the right indexes ? At that time, not support was
available for Oracle databases in DBManager, so I could not test it

Alvaro, thanks for taking this in charge !

Cheers
Michaël

I've made my tests with Oracle Spatial 11g. So I think it will not be 
better with Spatial than with Locator.
My layers have indexes (no complain from QGIS Oracle provider).

Well, we are in feature freeze, so it is not a good time to test some 
new methods of simplification.
I am not sure if we should remove the feature before release because it 
can degrades performances for people that have checked 'Simplify on 
provider side if possible' ?

Cheers,

Point taken. The decision is in the hands of the release manager.
However, this change should not have impact outside its context, so it
would seem reasonably safe to implement.
All the best, and thanks a lot.

Hello devs,

Myself Sarthak currently working under Dr. KS Rajan as a research student
in Spatial Informatics Lab, IIIT hyderabad . I am currently working in
spatial databases by optimizing the performance of mongoDb for spatial
databases. Previously i have worked on Billboard placement optimization
problem(using QGIS) and with pgRouting as a part of my previous GSOC
project. I regularly use QGIS for my research work as well.

I am an open source enthusiast and likes to contribute to our osego
community. I am interested in working with QGIS as a part of GSOC project.

Lately I was trying work on processing toolbox to reclassify some of the
fields in a vector shapefile and found a bug in the existing platform.
v.reclass either uses cols or rules to reclassify the shapefile but in QGIS
PT there is no option to deselect the coltab and it gives error when you
provide rules file as well. I think the implementation can also be improved.
While I going through the code after forking it from github, I couldn’t
figure out where to look for the exact code of `processing toolbox` to make
the changes.

Can someone please guide me in the same direction.

Regards,
Sarthak Agarwal

Point taken. The decision is in the hands of the release manager.
However, this change should not have impact outside its context, so it
would seem reasonably safe to implement.
All the best, and thanks a lot.

	C++?
Message-ID: <CAL5Q673kkxNtdhpfOXE6cKv=wNze6CaoDbQ3WdRYn4nfRJzU_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

to allow for drill-down forms, a few months ago, I've created a modified
value relation widget with a companion form function that allow to
implement dynamic filtering (or altering) of fields in a form.

It can be easily ported in the core (it's basically a clone of the
existing  value relation widget).

The widget is available as a python plugin.
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/FormAwareValueRelationWidget/
More information here:
http://www.itopen.it/a-new-qgis-plugin-allows-dynamic-filtering-of-values-in-forms

The main question is if there is any interest in porting this widget into
the core, then if this should be
1. a replacement of the existing value relation widget
2. an optional feature of the existing value relation widget
3. a new widget


I would like to hear your thoughts about this.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] bugs status
Message-ID: <20160202085408.GA4558@localhost>

I'm looking at the bug tracker to see what's left before release
and found that among 27 issues tagged as "blockers", 9 have
a target version of "Future Release - High Proprity" and 9
have no target version.

I would say a priority cannot be "blocker" if a target version isn't
set, do you agree ? If so, is there a way to batch-update all the
tickets with no "target version" or target version = "Future Release"
and priority = "blocker" to lower priority to "normal" ?

The remaining 9 are "blockers" and have target version 2.14.
Of these 9, 5 are still unassigned.
Only one is marked as causeing "crash or corruption".

It's also interesting to note that there are a total of 7 issues
targetted at "2.14" that are "causing crash or corruption"  but
only 1 of them is marked as "blocker" (others go from normal to high).

Shouldn't all crashers _also_ be blocker ?

Finally, I'd love to give pointers to all the queries above, but
hadn't found a way to obtain an url representing them, is there any
way to do that ?

Hi Alessandro, 

Yesterday I had a meeting with Matthias regarding widget improvements.
We also have a wishlist of widget improvements. I agree that it would
make sense to port your dynamic values list filtering Python plugin to
C++. 

In your proposal I would prefer option 1) or try to marry the "Value
Relation" widget with the "Relation Reference" widget and introduce your
new filtering mechanism. Note that the "relation reference" and the
"value relation" widgets both have filter options, but only with in the
widget itself, not in relation with other widgets, like your plugin. 

----------------------------------------- 

Over the years, quite some overlap appeared in the widgets. In my
opinion, with QGIS 3.0, we should do an effort to clean up the
overlapping widgets. But we'd need an "update strategy" for old obsolete
widgets and make sure that the new widget variants really do all that
the old widgets could do. 

As an example: 

The "Value Relation" and the "Relation Reference" Widgets have a lot of
overlaps. Ideally they should be combined into one widget. 

The newly introduced "External Resource" widget makes the "Photo",
"Filename" and potentially also the "Web View" more or less obsolete. 

I think the QGIS users would prefer a smaller list of widgets with
options, and not many overlapping widgets that do very similar things.

Hi all,

I also think merging things is the way to go, but we should keep the
feature provided by the "value relation" widget : it is not used to add
children referring the current object edited, but instead it is used to
create a combo box containing labels helping to fill the field data which
is a foreign key. For me, the logic is reversed. The data structure is the
same, but the with a different point of view ( child or parent).

Regards,
Michaël

Hi,

I don't see such a difference: the main difference with the current
implementation of value relation widget is that the (optional) filtering of
the items in the combo is dynamic: every time a value changes in the other
fields of the form, the values in the related combo are filtered again
against the expression, that in turn has access to the current values of
the other fields.

This means that the cache for the values in the combo is built against
unfiltered values (and can be optionally disabled).

If you don't set an expression that uses the new function to access to the
other fields in the form, this widget behaves exactly as the current value
relation widget.

I would find this useful it the widget could be enhanced to support dynamically fetching data from the underlying source based on input auto-complete filtering. A particular use case for me is using a large PostgreSQL table of millions of unique text code values.

Is there a qgis wiki page describing point-by-point what's
limited in the current code hosting setup ?
I guess it would help evaluating alternatives.

Note that the current OSGeo trac version does support GIT as a repository,
see for example https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/browser/php

We are working on the DB2 expression compiler and testing it with a

For an expression like NAME IS NULL
What should be the node type of NULL?  It appears to be 
QgsExpression::ntLiteral but it doesn't seem to have a valid value and 
fails the call to quotedValue().

For now we are using a hack to check if n->dump() == NULL and treating 
it as a special case.

Also, I assume that ILIKE is a case insensitive LIKE.

Hi David,

Have you had a look at the class QgsSqlExpressionCompiler? Other SQL
dialects inherit from this class and fine tune it. Most work should
already be done in there so you just have to take care of the failing tests.

Hi Alessandro,

I have no particular opinion about how this is included in the fields and forms stuff best.
Just wanted to say thank you for this! It is really a great enhancement! 

Cheers
Stefan

Hello,

I have made tests with SDO_UTIL.RECTIFY_GEOMETRY. I have used the 
following queries:

* SDO_UTIL.SIMPLIFY: SELECT SDO_UTIL.SIMPLIFY("GEOM", 1, 0.05) FROM 
"TABLE" WHERE ROWNUM < 10000
* SDO_UTIL.RECTIFY: SELECT SDO_UTIL.RECTIFY("GEOM", 0.05) FROM "TABLE" 
WHERE ROWNUM < 10000
* Direct geometry: SELECT "GEOM" FROM "TABLE" WHERE ROWNUM < 10000

And this is what I've found so far for performances:
* SDO_UTIL.SIMPLIFY: 12.3 seconds and 3.47 MBytes of traffic.
* SDO_UTIL.RECTIFY: 8.5 seconds and 3.37 MBytes of traffic.
* Direct geometry: 6.37 seconds and 5.09 MBytes of traffic.

It seems that SDO_UTIL.RECTIFY will also be a problem for provider 
simplification performances with Oracle.
Furthermore, in a vast majority, this function doesn't really simplify 
the geometry (same number of vertices produced).
"TABLE" has spatial indexes enabled and no geometry validation problem.

Perhaps there is nothing directly available in Oracle Database Spatial 
to handle simplification with a benefit on the final rendering speed in 
QGIS.
But, SDO_UTIL.SIMPLIFY actually do simplification on the provider side 
so why not implement it ?

The workaround could be a (conditional) warning somewhere on the dialog 
box for layer rendering (in Settings and in individual layer rendering 
tab) stating that Oracle simplification on the provider side is likely 
to degrade rendering performances...

Cheers !

Merci Médéric for these tests. I would expect the results were more
clearcut for much larger samples - could you please try again with a
million geometries?
All the best.

What's the advantage of this approach?
Isn't the whole point of server side simplification to increase
performance and if there's no performance boost expected, why should we
implement it at all?

Hi

I totally agree with Matthias. If Oracle (Spatial or Locator) has bad
performance relative to simplification, we simply should not use it, even
it is a shame.
One other argument to convince users to migrate to PostgreSQL ;)  which
also has a much better support for layers statistics ( extent, features
count, etc.)

Message-ID: <56B20B20.8070206@gmail.com>

Hi dev,

French users has an issue with processing's AddModelFromFileAction 
because of a localization. The string used by QFileDialog to filter 
files by extension is localized and a coma has been inserted between 
file extension. This comma causes that no files are displayed.

I'd like to know, how to fix it and how to prevent it ?
Update localization directly in the source code ? Update localization on 
transifex ?
Update the string to exclude extension files ?

Regards,
René-Luc

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Interactive raster editing mode
Message-ID: <CANwy9RR8YQfokprEdwKvr=K7mmQWhKnnJoE=jS6oTQ0SvfpfLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings

Does QGIS have any sort of interactive raster editing support?
Ideally this would be something  integrated in the map display panel
(not a separate task like d.rast.edit), in order to natively support
the typical pan/zoom and co-display of contextual data.

For this application assume that the raster handle provided by GDAL
supports edits, so persisting the updated values is not an issue.  The
feature set I would like to have is something like a simple 'paint'
program:
- select the layer to edit
- select the value to apply (select from legend, or eyedropper tool to
select from raster)
- select the brush shape
- use the mouse to 'paint' the changes.

If this type of feature doesn't exist, then roughly what would be
involved to implement it?

Cheers,

Tom

Subject: [Qgis-developer] FOSS4G 2016 Code Sprint Bonn August
Message-ID: <7374be83648feaec12535b4586fa5c5e@foss4g2016.org>

Dear developers,

this year, once again, we are following the old tradition of hosting a 
codesprint on the FOSS4G. More precisely, we offer a setting so that  
individual projects can meet for their codesprint. Since projects 
benefit from each other as well, the codesprint will naturally be held 
conjointly at one place.
Unfortunately, circumstances have forced us to divide the codesprint 
timetable-wise.

The first part is scheduled to take place directly before the 
conference, the second immediately after. The first two and a half days 
start on Sunday, August 21, 2016 at around noon and are scheduled to end 
on Tuesday, August 23, 2016 (open end). The 2nd part starts in the 
morning of Saturday, August 27, 2016 and ends on Sunday at 12 pm.

We are happy to have found a really awesome location for you. Codesprint 
and accommodations are combined in one hall. Check out  
http://www.basecamp-bonn.com/ for details about the venue.
Working zones will be created for you in the breakfast area and 
hallways. There’s the option of finding relatively inexpensive sleeping 
accommodations in train sleeping cars, camping buses, classic cars and 
more. Additionally, an outdoor area is available for you to enjoy Bonn’s 
summer weather in August, while working. Healthy and not-so-healthy 
catering of drinks and snacks will be provided by us. Participation in 
codesprint is free of charge. However, overnight stays will have to be 
reserved and paid for by you.

Another hint: the BaseCamp is within walking distance from the 
conference venue (WCCB) and has good access to public transportation –  
the Icebreaker takes place here, too.
You see, it’s worthwhile booking here!

As the accommodations are available to all FOSS4G participants, we will 
make an effort to make advance booking possible for you a few days 
ahead, to ensure you have the opportunity to sleep on-site and wrap up 
the evenings jointly. For that, it’s necessary for you to sign up 
(https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2016_Code_Sprint) and leave your 
email address so that we can contact you immediately accomodation 
booking is available. We need your sign-up for the planning of snacks 
and drinks, too!

This is open to all who wish to participate in one or more projects. 
There’s always plenty to do – it’s not all about programming. 
Translation, documentation, feedback, discussions, testing – all this is 
also important for  project so everyone is cordially invited to attend 
the codesprints! Registration with the conference is not a prerequisite 
for participation in codesprint.

One thing we’d like to ask you: with an approx. 120 participants 
anticipated, the WLAN capacity will naturally be exhausted at some 
point. Please be sure to avoid huge on-site downloads of data, as this 
could impact the work of others. Thank you!

The Codesprint Organizing Team is looking forward to your coming!

Summarily:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Updates to tests
Message-ID: <56B47947.9030500@opengis.ch>

The processing plugin received a test suite which runs algorithms as
part of the CI process.

With this a number of changes have been introduced.


qgis.testing module
*******************

This is a new python module which should be shipped with QGIS. It
already contains some small bits of code interesting for every plugin
developer who wants to build his own unittests.

E.g.

    from qgis.testing.mocked import get_iface
    self.iface = get_iface()

The iface created this way contains all methods that the current QGIS'
iface defines (automagically). It also returns a valid mapCanvas().
Other methods do nothing, but you can e.g. check if a method has been
called and make it do some other things (see
https://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.mock.html )

If there is a change you think is valuable for everyone. e.g. You make
it return a real messageBar, please provide this code upstream, so we
can maintain one single copy of the mock iface code!

You can also provide more utils which are interesting for any QGIS
related python tests there.

Please keep methods which are only interesting for core QGIS python
tests in tests/src/python/utilities.py like before. These do not need to
be made public.

Dependencies
**************

nose2 has been introduced as testing dependency. It was the only library
I found which allos inheriting unittest.TestCase and writing test
generators at the same time. Along with pyyaml and mock modules.

processing
***********

Please participate in increasing the coverage of the processing test
suite. I wrote a blog post about it.

Message-ID: <56B4B404.20900@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I kind of remember an option to increase the number of features loaded
before doing a redraw, that in some situations increased the general
speed for layers with lots of features. Now in master I cannot see it
back (just the interval for refresh): was I dreaming, or was it removed
sometimes? In case, could someone remind me why?
All the best, and thanks.

Message-ID: <CAEATQXCc_uOJL4HToCCP6ZFP7MFdeF1TGGc9xcOV6nd4a_h=+A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

My name is Matthew Winchester and I spend most of my time developing
software. I would like to create my own closed source software that I can
package and sell using python. This software would be using the QGIS python
package that I can import into a script and run to create layers on mapped
data.

I was wondering from a programmer what this QGIS license means. I have had
several of my friends tell me that I will not be able to sell this software
as closed source because of the license agreement to use the software. I
have also had someone tell me that it isn't a big deal and I can use QGIS's
library in Python to create my own code and sell it.

Thank you for your time

Hi Matthew,

if you use QGIS libaries in your code than you code should be licensed
under same license as QGIS, GNU GPL v2+

Since you seem to be unfamiliar with the GPL, here a very short summary
(from someone who is not a lawyer):

You can develop your own software by using the QGIS library. You can
sell this software, it does not require you to give something away for
free as in beer. However, you are required that whenever someone
receives your software he may also receive the source code for it. Hence
yes, you are required to make it open source. But this does not mean
publicly for everyone (although this is very much appreciated).

Just to make the point clear, that it is about "free as in speech", not
"free as in beer".

Best

As far as I can see, this should be fine.
You are only required to share the code if you share the application. So
if the only thing that is deployed is a report/map, that should be no
problem.

And there is already work going on:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/2.14.0/

Mmm, only working if you are logged in first (so you have to have a
login first). Plz let me or Tim (or ??) know if you need a login (I just
checked.... you have)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems building QGIS 2.8.6 on Win 7 32bit
Message-ID: <F8E350E9-580F-43CF-AD0A-90B092D5C6D4@uni-trier.de>

Hi!

I'm trying to build QGIS 2.8.6 on Windows 7 32 bit using MSVC Express 10. The build process completes without errors, but with a bunch of warnings. When I run the qgis.exe after installation, it only shows the splash screen for a few seconds until "Starting python" appears. Then it vanishes and nothing happens.

When building python_module_qgis__gui in MSVC Express I get the following warnings. I get similar ones when building python_module_qgis_core and python_module_gis_analysis.

Generating gui/sip_guipart0.cpp, gui/sip_guipart1.cpp, gui/sip_guipart2.cpp, gui/sip_guipart3.cpp sip_guipart0.cpp c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include\math.h(162): warning C4211: Nonstandard extension used : redefined extern to static sip_guipart1.cpp c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include\math.h(162): warning C4211: Nonstandard extension used : redefined extern to static

My cmake configuration is this:

Found SIP version: 4.16.5

Found PyQt4 version: 4.11.3

Found QScintilla2 PyQt4 module: 2.8.4

Does anyone have an idea what might be wrong? Maybe the Python and SIP versions?

Thank you for any advice! :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Why is ellipsoidal calculation tied to project OTF
	setting?
Message-ID: <CAB28Asjd1tXKtoLkKmR79Lh9ohSEbA8gLZSNAEQ3jzLLgcpZww@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

While looking into the outstanding area/distance calculations issues
there's something I'm struggling to understand.

In QGIS ellipsoidal distance/area calculations are ONLY enabled when the
project has OTF crs transformation enabled. It could be because I've spent
too long staring at this code and lost sight of the bigger picture, but why
is this a requirement??

I can't see any reason why an ellipsoid can't be used even when layers
aren't being reprojected on the fly. To me, it's a totally different
setting without any relation to distance/area measurement.

If you don't want ellipsoidal calculation you could still set the ellipsoid
to none. But you *could* potentially want ellipsoidal calculation even when
OTF is off.

Am I missing something here?

Hi Nyall,

Just as a note: The ellipsoidal measure is quite uncommon in other GIS packages.
PostGIS, SAGA, GRASS and the mayor proprietary GIS are all using a Cartesian measure. Deep down in the history of the several related tickets, you can see that users are often surprised if measures in QGIS differ from measures they got from other sources (including official statistics).

I am no geodesist, so I do not have the expertise to judge which type of measure should be favored / the default. But I would expect the other packages have their reasons for using Cartesian measurements... Given that the code for the ellipsoidal measurement is actually copied from GRASS, which mostly does not use it, I – as a lay person in this matter – would be a bit concerned to have an ellipsoidal area/distance measure as the default...

But that probably does not answer your question...

Cheers
Stefan

I'm not an actual geodesist either, just someone who has read too many
books.

I do not understand the notion of tying ellipsoidal distance
("geodesic", presumably) to whether reproject is going on.  If the data
is in a datum, then an ellipsoid is known and the points can be reduced
to the ellipsoid (to remove the effects of longer distance from
elevation) and then the distance along the ellipsoid computed.  In
geodetic survyeing, this seems to be the standard approach.

I'm unclear on what "cartesian" means.  Presumably that's an
approximation to ellipsoidal distance assuming small distances from some
point.   That's an ok thing to show but it is an approximation.  Another
value to show is the distance computed in some projected coordinate
system, like UTM.  But that's different than an actual distance.

For computing ellipsoidal distance, the best open source code these days
seems to be from geographiclib, which is now in proj.

It seems to me that if coordinates are in some lat/long system,
ellipsoidal distnace/area is the right default.  If in UTM, then in UTM
space seems right.  But it should be clear which is which, and the user
should be able to get the other, or at least to get ellipsoidal when in
UTM or some other projected coordinates.

Dear all,

I've been using the geodesic functionalities of ESRI ArcGIS within my academic work: http://www.gispla.net/docs/Oosthoek_Arriazu_MarcoFiguera_GeodesicGIS_Human_LandingSite_Mars.pdf and http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/explorationzone2015/pdf/1049.pdf 

But within my freelance work I use QGIS. It would be great if QGIS also had similar functionalities.

@Greg. As far as I would imagine, cartesian would mean measuring on a 2D projection while geodesic measures on the sphere/ellipse.

Cheers, Jelmer Oosthoek

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mozillas release schedule
Message-ID: <56B5D934.5020706@carto.net>

Hi,

Mozilla had a six-week fixed release schedule for the past couple 
months/years.

They now change to a "variably scheduled six-to-eight week release 
cycle" - so with two weeks of buffer - should there be any serious bugs 
or holiday season clashes.

See 
https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2016/02/04/update-on-2016-firefox-release-schedule/

Thought that this interesting to share - and probably quite similar to 
what we do - we have our fixed release schedule, but should there be a 
serious bug that is discovered close to the planned release date, there 
is some flexibility. The main problem, however remains - that bugs are 
often discovered shortly after the release, because most users don't 
test before the release ...

Andreas

Message-ID: <567A393F-CC7B-47F2-AD16-2D309797856C@uni-trier.de>

Hi, 

I compiled QGIS 2.8.6 using MSVC Express 2010 on Windows 7 32bit. The built completes without any errors and after installation QGIS starts fine. However, there are some icons missing in the toolbar. Specifically, all SVG icons are missing while the PNG icons are there. 

I added the OSGeo4W/include/qt4/QtSvg folder to the Include directories in MSVC Express. "qsvg4.dll" is in OSGeo4W/apps/qt4/plugins/imageformats and "qsvgicon4.dll" and "qsvgicond4.dll" are in OSGeo4W/apps/qt4/plugins/imageformats. Do I have to add them as well to some VC++ directory? Are there any other dependencies missing?  

Has anybody experienced this problem before or knows what might be wrong?


Cheers,
Christina

looks like ntv2 provider hasn't updated its algorithms to the latest
changes in GDAL provider?

Hi Paolo,

this is not a Processing issue, but bug in 3rd party plugin.
The bug is caused by fact that plugin uses internal Processing
classes (which was changed) instead of subclassing public
GeoAlgorithm class.

Right, deactivating it generates another error, and QGIS hangs.
All the best, and thanks.

confirmed, I deactivated all extra Processing plugins, the problem
disappears.
Better letting plugin devs to upgrade their classes. If you do not have
time for it I can do it, just let me have a good suggestion to quickly
fix the plugins.
Thanks.

Hi all,
saving a line layer results in a crash with:

Warning: Object::disconnect: Unexpected null parameter
LAYER CHANGE: <qgis._core.QgsVectorLayer object at 0x7f25fb668218>

anyone confirms? Should I open a ticket? Seems a pretty bad thing.

Started with a clean --configpath, issue confirmed, with any layer I
tried, both lines and polygons.
Last debs from master.

Most likely, yes. Possibly next rebuild will wix it?

Hi,

I noticed a strange behavior using snap feature with qis 2.12.

I try to describe it:
- Edit a layer with active snap on a second layer.
- move polygon vertex.
- sometimes new points are added to another polygon in the editing layer,
sometimes where I move the vertex (as you can see in [0], sometimes far
away from it, but in any case snapped with the second layer.

I haven't yet find the complete sequence to reproduce the error, so I
attach a video [0] to describe the problem.

Do you know if it's a known issue or can anyone confirm it ?
If confirmed it could be a very insidious issue, because it can damage the
layer.

I tested it on 2.12 and 2.13 (and with less accuracy on 2.8) 64bit on linux
mint 17.3.

Thanks
Luca

Hi all,
when changing a symbol to SVG, or in other instances where SVG preview
should be created in vector properties, QGIS takes 100% of CPU, and the
system lags for ages, even on a modern machine.
Current debs from master.
Does anyone confirm?
All the best.

Only for those unable or unwilling to build qgis themselves (or use the
qgis.org packages). The python-qt4 package hasn't been updated to drop
the WebKit support yet, until that happen you can still build qgis.

Hi,

How about this:

* Release 2.14 as an LTR (on schedule), but with the option of having new,
heavily unit-tested and vetted features still available for pushing
* Skip a 2.16 release
* Release 3.0 version 8 months after 2.14

This would allow cleaning up of the PRs and QEPs that apply to the 2.x
branch, but not tie up the overall dev community with another full 2.x
point release. There will be 2.14.x releases, but possibly with an
understanding of when new features were introduced, e.g. tags >= 2.14.x
have new features.

It would also offer a full 8 months of work on porting everything to 2.x to
3.0, and allow the community to be well informed ahead of the impending
change.

Please keep in mind, for the Mac user community, the sooner a 3.0 beta
release is available the better, as Qt4 has very fragile support for
building on the current OS version and may not build at all on future ones.

To be exact: there is/was a draft plan there, which will be spread wider
very soon. But have a look if you are curious :-)

I had the same idea, for similar reasons (also on Debian we've the same
issue), but from a global perspective I believe the choice made is the
best compromise between all different needs.
Of course the crucial point is having people investing heavily in qgis3,
so we'll have it released soon, minimising all side effect of several
versions in parallel.
All the best.

Looks like missing Breaks/Replaces: qgis-plugin-grass (<< VERSION) on 
the qgis package.

When moving files between packages the new package needs Breaks/Replaces 
control fields to inform dpkg about files moved from old packages in new 
packages.

The version to use is the package revision the move was made in, all 
preceding versions will still have the files in the old package.

This is documented in Debian Policy chapter 7:

https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-replaces

Bas

thanks for explanation. I hope someone fix it soon. I am trying to
bypass this error, but none of my attempts was successful, I tried:

sudo apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-overwrite" install qgis
sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite
/var/cache/apt/archives/qgis_1%3a2.13.0+git20160208+b712f3c+23wily_amd64.deb

All these commands ends with:

Remove the old packages first, then install the new packages again. 
There won't be any old packags install to conflict with during the 
upgrade.

I already tried that:

sudo apt-get remove `dpkg --get-selections | grep qgis | cut -d' ' -f1
| awk '{printf $1" "}'`
sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis

It fails with:

If you've verified that no qgis packages are left installed after 
removal, there is not much you can do to deal with the broken packaging.

`apt-get -f install qgis pyton-qgis` may work.

5f310a hopefully fixes it.

apt-get remove "*qgis*" ? 

> sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis

List the diversions:

dpkg-divert --list /usr/bin/qgis

And then probably:

dpkg-divert --remove /usr/bin/qgis
dpkg-divert --remove /usr/bin/qbrowser

After that installation should work.  Not really sure why removal of
qgis-plugin-grass didn't also remove the diversion.

This was done loong time ago, and if I understand it correctly, it was
based on this assumption: if OTF reprojection is disabled, we cannot
tell anything about the input coordinates - whether they were measured
on top of a lat/lon CRS or projected CRS - so we play it "safe" and do
not try to do calculation based on ellipsoid.

I think that logic is a result of some ad-hoc improvements. IIRC first
QGIS used only planimetric distances. Then I rewrote the measuring to
be completely based on ellipsoid distances. That was around 10 years
ago and I was coming from world of GPS where everything was in WGS84
and planimetric distances did not feel right for lat/lon coords :-) I
was completely new to GIS, so I did not even think that people would
ever want distances that are not calculated on ellipsoid... Eventually
planimetric distances returned at some point later - with all sorts of
logic when/how to do planimetric/ellipsoid calculations. So I take my
part of blame for the current situation :-)

Indeed - I totally agree. The fact that measurements are done in
different ways based on whether OTF reprojection is enabled is really
confusing.

Exactly.

Hi Paolo, 

I just compiled on Ubuntu 15.10 the latest master and changing to SVG
symbols works totally fine - no issues. 

Did you perhaps install a huge amount of SVG symbols?

then I don't know. Does SVG work at all? E.g. can you place an SVG file
from Inkscape in a print composer layout? Does it work in markers? 

Maybe a missing dependency? Is the libqt4-svg package installed?

Hi David,

see in top right of http://qgis.org

we are currently in 2.13 feature freeze going to release 2.14 the end of
this month. Including a new provider, as you do, I think will be counted
as 'feature' :-) so will have to wait for the next version 2.16 in 4
months after that.

See
http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html#release-schedule

(which is a little in flux because of the 3.0 discussion going one
currently)

Regards,

Richard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Why QDialogProgress used in
	QgsVectorLayer::countSymbolFeatures ?
Message-ID: <56BA08F8.5090203@gmail.com>

Hi Dev,

A new QGIS Server feature : showFeatureCount, uses the method 
QgsVectorLayer::countSymbolFeatures to display feature count in legend. 
But this feature doesn't work if a fake X server is not used.

I discovered that the method QgsVectorLayer::countSymbolFeatures 
initialized a QDialogProgress. I wondered if this was the right place to 
initialize a dialog ?

Regards,
René-Luc D'Hont

Hi,

No it would not be the correct place. No gui stuff like that should live in
core.

Consider it a bug for 2.14 and should be fixed

Haven't we also talked about moving this to the data provider, so that we
can take advantage of calculating the count using compiled expressions,
etc? That'd be another (good) alternative to this method.

Maybe a bad SVG? Or a bad path in the SVG search paths?

I'm starting --configpath on a fresh dir, so this seems quite unlikely.

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FiVwk3PKxfw7Lk=2sdGse2PCXVZcRBRhjBMqaciH4fRzQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Currently, it seems possible to select different output file format when a
tool is run directly from the toolbox.

Is there a way to also specify which file format should be used for model
intermediate results? As far as I can tell, it  always produces Shapefiles.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Anita, 

That's because Processing works with software that only supports
Shapefiles as vector data, such as SAGA. Maybe other external software
as well. 

But I am sure that Victor can say more about it. It would be great if
e.g. Geopackage could replace Shapefiles as the standard intermediate
format.

​Thanks! I guess that might be the main reason. There might be a way though
to allow for more options if a model only uses tools which are not limited
to Shapefiles.​

​Best wishes,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems upgrading nightly in Ubuntu 14.04
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_EFWzeO+EnLY03fPYHV=aj4fUoGAc5em2-cQgPNsK-RqQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm getting this while upgrading QGIS master in ubuntu 14.04.

Errors were encountered while processing:
 /var/cache/apt/archives/qgis_1%3a2.13.0+git20160209+964ae1f+20trusty-ubuntugis_amd64.deb
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

Is this something I should worry about in my instalation, or it will be a
question of waiting for next nightly to came out?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

The instructions at 
http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/qgisdevelopersguide/qtcreator.html
have a link for "detailed instructions" but the link doesn't work.

I'm up to the CMake error "Could not find GEOS".
sudo apt-get install GEOS
sudo apt-get install geos
don't succeed.

I haven't previously used QtCreator or CMake on Ubuntu.

Hi,
I do get the same error so it should not be your installation.

Hi,
I think the detailed instructions page should be this one :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL

As in develop while on public transit. :)

Anyone using/developing Qgis on the bus? I've previously used a 13" 
laptop (many years ago), and looking to buy something similar. I want to 
be able to use it on the bus (if possible). Need a decent keyboard and a 
good mouse replacement(e.g. trackpad). Usability more important than 
performance. Budget around 1000 euro. Not sure what size is a good fit.

Or is it not advisable at all?

Hi!

There are lots of "old" lenovo X220 being sold on ebay for far below
300€. Intel i5, 4GB RAM and a 12.5" Screen. Robust (maybe a bit heavy)
but I am travelling with these things since 6 years and can only
recommend them. (keyboard of x220 is the best I ever had - and I
usually switch of the pad and use the red trackpoint to exactly place
the cursor - thats far better than a touchpad). And even more - this
is useable on a airplan - with less space than a bus ;)

regards
Werner

Hello,

be sure to have a minimum of performances to be able to build QGIS in a 
reasonable amount of time.
I tried to do it on my light Lenovo E145 on the train and it takes more 
than 1 hour to build QGIS from scratch (perhaps 2 hours with all the 
cores). On my desktop computer, the amount of time to do the same thing 
is 9 minutes (core i7-something with 8GB of RAM) !

Screen size is also important. I am able to use QGIS on a 11" wide 
screen for dev but I can only deal with basic use cases where there are 
not too much to do (try to use Processing with the attribute table 
opened and the expression dialog box at the same time). Besides, working 
on a small screen leads to fix the too large dialog boxes bugs ! A 13" 
would definitely be better than 11".

Cheers !

Thank you for the quick response.

Unfortunately, section 3.3 with the build dependencies is cut off on the 
right side. Is there another link for the entire document?

The build process at this link are quite different, using 'ccmake' while 
the directions at
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/qgisdevelopersguide/qtcreator.html
use QtCreator.

Any help with the most current and complete build process would be 
appreciated.

Hi - I've gotten further but this seems like a fundamental problem if 
I'm using QtCreator and it can't find QtCore.

CMake Warning at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindQt4.cmake:659 (message):
   /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/qmake reported QT_INSTALL_LIBS as
   "/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu" but QtCore could not be found there. Qt is NOT
   installed correctly for the target build environment.

You can view the raw file via the link in GitHub, or just select the 
line a drag it to right to reveal the rest of the line.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/INSTALL

You can also easily install the qgis build dependencies with apt:

  sudo apt-get build-dep qgis

Kind Regards,

Python plugins are available on QGIS server, but since the server has its
own plugin interface, you must use a plugin that was specifically written
to use the QGIS server interface.

There is a watermark example plugin for the server available:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/HelloServer/
The code of the watermark filter is here:
https://github.com/elpaso/qgis-helloserver/blob/master/filters/WatermarkFilter.py

Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <EC55579E-1634-46BC-8FA3-6590358CD88F@qgis.org>

Hi All

Just a fresh call for those who have written new features in 2.14: Please help us to describe your hard work! We need:

* details of the features
* screenshots of the features
* short video screencasts of the features (new version of the changelog site supports video embeds)
* notes on authors for new features (new version of the changelog site has special fields for these)
* notes on sponsors for new features (new version of the changelog site has special fields for these)

The work in progress changelog is here [1]. If you don’t have write access to the site, either write to me and I will sort it out, or just send me an email with your entry details. Don’t worry if your english is not the best - I will go through the entries and edit them all to be neat & tidy. Any native english speakers with good writing skills who would like to help me with the editorial work, please contact me and I will set you up with needed access rights.

Please don’t publicise the changelog until we have finished it so that users coming to read it can get current and up to date information!

Lastly, I am running a ‘changelog’ sprint day to get the changelog ready - please sign up on the doodle[2] if you are interested so that we can pick the day where the most people can participate. Of course you can work on it independently but on the sprint day I will be hanging around on IRC & Gitter to coordinate the effort (as well as of course working on the changelog). This is a great place for non coders to contribute too - just grab a nightly build and start making screenshots and improving feature descriptions!

Hi Paolo

This option was indeed superseded in 2.4 with introduction of
multi-threaded rendering by interval-based refresh rate. The
interval-based refresh is a better way of controlling refresh rate: it
has consistent behavior (few complex features do not block refresh),
it is not limited to just vector layers, and the number is easier to
understand/tweak. The old option did not really do any extra
performance tricks - simply increasing the number did fewer refreshes
(less extra work), so the overall rendering time shrunk. The default
of 250 ms for refresh is quite a conservative value already - so I do
not expect it would make a difference to make it higher (but lowering
it to something like 1 ms would make things slow).

Cheers
Martin

Hi,
Any solution or tip for this issue? I tried again today and got _same
error_ with another nightly build

Errors were encountered while processing:
/var/cache/apt/archives/qgis_1%3a2.13.0+git20160212+bcc8e2a+20trusty_i386.deb
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

Thanks

That doesn't have any information about what is going wrong.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PostGIS provider does not recognize Interval type
Message-ID: <56BE121A.8090104@gmail.com>

Hi Dev,

I'm testing a PostGIS table with an INTERVAL type field and this one is 
not recognize by QGIS.

Did someone know why INTERVAL type is not recognized by PostGIS provider 
? And how to add a new supported type to PostGIS provider ?

Thanks,

René-Luc D'Hont

I did this to resolve the issue:

sudo dpkg-divert --remove /usr/bin/qgis
sudo dpkg-divert --remove /usr/bin/qbrowser

I think it was related to this change:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/8b054e6661c672b10f14afc661bc16ad83c6e064

Intervals don't exist outside of expressions (at the moment). You'd need to:

1. Move QgsExpression::Interval out of QgsExpression into it's own
class (QgsInterval), updating the API and adding unit tests as
required
2. Make the new class available for use in QVariants by calling
Q_DECLARE_METATYPE( QgsInterval ) (usually placed at the end of the
header for the corresponding class)
3. Make similar changes to qgspostgresprovider.cpp:182, :348, :879, :3250
4. Add a test for pg interval types, like the changes made to
test_provider_postgres.py as part of 7dc5eac

I didn't mention it again as I wanted to verify that the fix works this time -
which 5f310a didn't.

Declaring the conflict as in 5f310a was supposed to remove the diversions.
Unfortunately the diversions were only removed when the package was removed,
but not on upgrade.  So the diversion would stay.  And the upgraded version
didn't know about diversions anymore and hence would not even remove it on
removal of the package anymore.

7489af8 hopefully does fix it - it does here when upgrading from 2.12 - but
once the diversion is removed manually that can't be checked...

Message-ID: <152dbcfcfa3.alugli1977@alice.it>

Hi,
I have to programmatically load a qlr file in a PyQGIS script.
Now my code is:xxx = QgsMapLayer.fromLayerDefinitionFile("C:\\xxx.qlr")
but in this way it doesn't manage groups inside qlr file and layers are reported in alphabetical order along the tree view.
How is it possible to manage both groups and layers stored in a qlr file?
Thank you in advance for your attention

Hi Alexander and Victor,

Actually the problem seems related with the new shortHelp function,
introduced in commit 62302377db1990485f7821f1ccef4ff6ef4d07d9.

Removing

    def shortHelp(self):
        return self._formatHelp('''This algorithm is based on the GDAL %s
module.

                For more info, see the <a href = '
http://www.gdal.org/%s.html'> module help</a>
                ''' %  (self.commandName(), self.commandName()))

from GdalAlgorithm.py prevents this error and these 3rd party plugins works
ok.

Any hint to update them?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Algorithms are expected to have that method, so providers that extend
GDALAlgorithm should have a commandName() function or  override the
implementation of shortHelp()

Sounds to me like an easy update

Hi Pedro,

GdalAlgorithm is an internal Processing class and should not
be used in 3rd party plugins.

The error happens because GdalAlgorithm class was refactored
and new mandatory methods were introduced. Personally I think
that all 3rd party plugins should use only public Processing API,
e.g. GeoAlgorithm class.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WMS provider: Cannot calculate extent
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A280570D00C74@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

I have a strange situation. I host two different WMS layers on an internal GeoServer 2.8.2 (type is ImagePyramid) and both layers look fine when previewing them in the GeoServer Layer Preview. I use QGIS Master x64 (latest nightly build from OSGeo4w) to access the layers.
One of them gets added to the map the other one doesn't and give me the following message:

WMS provider: Cannot calculate extent
(..\..\..\..\..\..\src\providers\wms\qgswmsprovider.cpp : 148 : QgsWmsProvider::QgsWmsProvider)
Raster layer: Provider is not valid (provider: wms, URI: contextualWMSLegend=0&crs=EPSG:25832&dpiMode=7&featureCount=10&format=image/png&layers=myns:layer_not_working&styles=&url=http://myserver:8080/geoserver/wms
(..\..\..\..\..\src\core\raster\qgsrasterlayer.cpp : 668 : QgsRasterLayer::setDataProvider)

By sniffing the GetCapabilities request sent by QGIS using Fiddler, I get the following two layer definitions in return:

I have anonymized the messages above (since the error doesn't point in the direction of naming) and I can of course provide more information if needed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] broken OSX test on master
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiEbrheerBo8HuEV1vUiAu73qWowTp05NNu92onJ9ndBw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just letting you all know - the OSX Travis build is failing currently
due to an issue I'm having trouble tracking down. For some reason on
OSX QgsDistanceArea is reporting incorrect area calculations. I'm not
sure if this is an issue just with the test or revealing a deeper
issue with the OSX build.

I'll look into it tomorrow, but in the meantime please disregard this
test failure!

Are these changes so low-level that this version cannot be shipped with
both? Can they not be catched with an if on
qgis.utils.QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT or a small try-except-block?

I think this is a broader topic of what is the policy for core plugins,
do they receive updates throughout the maintenance period of a given
release? Are bugfixes to processing for 2.8 shipped at the moment and
how (plugin repository or with the binary)?

Hi Casper,

Just clean the WMS cache on QGIS: Settings -> Options -> Network -> Cache
settings -> clear

Best regards,

Hi Pedro,

Thanks for the answer, it worked.

I guess my question now is, why do we have a cache on the GetCapabilities request? I guess some WMS servers provide a rather large response and the fast lookup in a (how old?) cache is preferred in many situations – at least when you know the capabilities haven’t changed.

But I don’t think this is user friendly at all. If I clear the cache, I get a new capabilities response which works. But I have to know, that it is the Settings/Options/Network/Cache Settings I have to clear (which doesn’t specify that it will clear the WMS capabilities and the user don’t know that it is cached). Wouldn’t it be better with a clear cache option for the given WMS server selection? This way the user can clear the cache if something doesn’t work or a newly published layer is missing, and the user can do it where the problem is occurred.

Regards, Casper

Hi Casper,
Just clean the WMS cache on QGIS: Settings -> Options -> Network -> Cache settings -> clear

2016-02-15 9:14 GMT+00:00 Casper Børgesen (CABO) <CABO at niras.dk<mailto:CABO at niras.dk>>:
I have a strange situation. I host two different WMS layers on an internal GeoServer 2.8.2 (type is ImagePyramid) and both layers look fine when previewing them in the GeoServer Layer Preview. I use QGIS Master x64 (latest nightly build from OSGeo4w) to access the layers.
One of them gets added to the map the other one doesn’t and give me the following message:

WMS provider: Cannot calculate extent
(..\..\..\..\..\..\src\providers\wms\qgswmsprovider.cpp : 148 : QgsWmsProvider::QgsWmsProvider)
Raster layer: Provider is not valid (provider: wms, URI: contextualWMSLegend=0&crs=EPSG:25832&dpiMode=7&featureCount=10&format=image/png&layers=myns:layer_not_working&styles=&url=http://myserver:8080/geoserver/wms
(..\..\..\..\..\src\core\raster\qgsrasterlayer.cpp : 668 : QgsRasterLayer::setDataProvider)

By sniffing the GetCapabilities request sent by QGIS using Fiddler, I get the following two layer definitions in return:

The changes are minimal, and it will be easy to make a version that
runs in both 2.14 and 2.12. I can add it easily

About plugin releases, we do that since sometimes there are important
changes and it was better to release instead of waiting for the next
QGIS release. AFAIK, no other core plugin does that, and there are no
guidelines for it. I will be happy to discuss about it, eventually
help writing those guidelines, and making Processing comply with them.

Hi all,
using current debs from master, browsing GRASS dirs, right click on a
GRASS location crashes QGIS, without notices from the console.
Do not know whether this is related, running v.generalize from
Processing also result in GRASS segfault.
I'm available for further tests.
All the best.

Thank you Victor.

I think 2.12 is just a nice to have. Once 2.14 is released, 2.12 will
reach EOL.

The question is mainly how to provide the current LTR with bugfixes in a
reasonable time during its lifetime (i.e. an updated 2.14 version until
Feb 2017).

Cheers

I have to correct myself: this happens with qgis 2.8.6, probably
compiled against a different version of grass from mainstream Debian.

This is an upstream issue, forwarded.

The same alg, from menu Vector, works smoothly.
BTW, he Vector menu version includes the full extent of the source
layer, whereas the Processing version excludes the northernmost row.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 14 hours of broken travis build in master
Message-ID: <20160215173749.GA15385@localhost>

I've some pulls to merge but current master does not pass travis
since 14 hours: https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/builds

The first failure was after Nyall commit:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/dfdcec89223d4167850c7ebbb0af1d65c21135f8
and is currently still failing in that area ("area" computation):

http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/testDetails.php?test=37439889&build=218090

Is anyone on the task of fixing current master build already ? 

As a travis build takes about 1 hour, it may be advisable not to
push a change later than 1.5 hours before the end of the workday,
so to eventually revert a change that could be breaking.

I posted an earlier email to the list regarding this. For now I've
taken the brute force approach and just disabled that test on the
Travis OSX builds.

Note that it's not a regression, it's a newly added unit test covering
previously untested parts of code which have revealed this issue.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsjeWRkJ8xeHKL+2e3B0ULdy1GAB8RhsH3VWPp4bY99w0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just putting out a call for extensive testing of length and area
measurements in the current master version. Over the past week I've
done a bunch of work trying to simplify the situation regarding
length/area calculation and unit handling, with the intention of
closing http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13209 and the other outstanding
area calculation issues (plus locking all this down with unit tests!).

I'd really appreciate thorough testing being done by users to ensure
that this bug is now indeed fixed prior to the 2.14 release.

Things to check:

- measured length/area is consistent across the identify tool results,
field calculator, and measure tool. (note that there's still an open
bug regarding virtual fields - there's a PR open to fix this but it's
not merged yet). Testing with different combinations of geographic/non
geographic CRS, OTF projection on/off and various
ellipsoid/planimetric calculations would be perfect.
- test the new project properties settings for project distance/area
units and coordinate formats
- test the reworked options for QGIS angle units and measurement of
angles using the measure tool

Thanks in advance!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] notifying developers on hub (and new credentials
	support)
Message-ID: <20160215210558.GA5016@localhost>

I'm chasing a bug in the only testcase we have for the PostgreSQL
provider and could not figure out how to "ping" other developers
on an issue.

The OSGeo trac instances have a "Cc" field for that, and github
has the @mention trick. Is there an equivalent thing for redmine ?

Nyall: taking the chance to notify here, the issue is that the test
hangs when not being able to reach the database, and I suspect this
has to do with credentials checking, due to this message being printed
right before entering a select loop and never coming out of it:

 195: credentials for dbname='qgis_test' sslmode=disable
 195: message: could not connect to server: No such file or directory

The printout comes from QgsCredentialsConsole::request, so I guess
the test is not using an appropriate-for-test QgsCredential subclass
(which should just never prompt the user).

The ticket is here, if you want to give an hint about how tests
should be dealing with this problem. I guess we'd want a
QgsCredentialsAuto or something ?

It's pretty obnoxious, but you could assign them and then un-assign
them? ;) I'm not aware of any other way...

I'm not sure - it's not really my area of expertise. Jürgen, Matthias

Hi Nyall,

Thanks for your work on this issue(s) and esp. the unit tests.

I did a swift test with a 100km vector grid using master version 5d989ab (which probably does not contain all your changes?).

Area measurements are consistent across field calculator and identify tool. However, the field calculator (using an 8 digits numeric field) shows some minor and probably neglectable imprecisions (e.g. compared to GRASS). GRASS reports exacly 10000000000.00000000 m2, while the field calculator gives something like 10000000000 +/- 0.0005 (OTF off).

With OTF on measurements differ significantly compared to GRASS and OTF off, due to ellipsoidal metric used with OTF on I guess. Personally, I find this difference confusing, but I trust the difference in behavior btw. OTF on and off is a deliberate choice of the more accurate area measure?!

Choosing no measurement ellipsoid in the project settings gives the same behavior as OTF off.

Kind regards,
Stefan

Yes, that version is missing some of the changes (specifically the
area related changes).

That sounds reasonable to me.

It *is* a little confusing here, but I'm reluctant to change this
behaviour so close to a release. For 2.16 I'll break the link between
OTF and ellipsoid, so that regardless of the OTF status you can set a
specific ellipsoid or force planar calculations.

One more way is to add them to the list of watchers for the ticket, so
they will receive notifications about subsequent updates - watchers
are listed on the right side of the page.

I hadn't found the "watchers lits" on right-side of page (maybe it
is only available to hub admins ?) -- I assigned to Larry as I get
he's the one in charge of QgsCredentials.

Hi all,
while checking the training manual for Processing, I'm spotting several
smaller and bigger issues, that make its use somewhat unpredictable.
Apparently not many users report these things, probably because analysis
is still a specialised field. I noticed that there are over 180 open
tickets on Processing, many of which seem rather easy. May I ask
developers familiar with it some pre-release effort to fix at least the
easiest or more serious of it?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi all,
why not make it easier for people to contribute tests, by removing
unnecessary steps (git may be a blocker for many).
Maybe we can:
* point the user to sample data with a simple zipfile
* ask the user to send the file from Create test and the result to an
email address
* integrate them ourselves into git.
I'm sure this will increase the number of testers, with a reasonable
effort from our side. I'm available to do it if no one else is available.

BTW, Create test throws an error here:

An error has occurred while executing Python code:

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'ReadAsArray'

Hi Paolo

I will be glad to receive more tests! I would appreciate if you could
make aware of this in you classes.

We can give the "send tests as zip" way a try, if this is really a
blocker for people.

Creating tests is not always as trivial, sometimes it may be required to
fine tune some parameters for fuzzy comparison (e.g. precision of
coordinates) or disable that certain fields are compared (e.g.
additional duplicate id's depending on ogr version). These steps can
only be done after having the result of travis tests, so somebody may
still need to take care of that.

That's interesting. I tried to integrate a gdal raster test on travis
(see here https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2761) it passes on my system
and on travis/osx but not on travis/linux. It seems that the output
raster cannot be opened by gdal (we do this to calculate a checksum).
Can you give me some information about your system, gdal version and
output raster format?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing: SAGA Raster statistics for polygons
	returns wrong values
Message-ID: <56C30663.9070000@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Running example from:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/source/docs/training_manual/processing/geomorpho.rst

Raster statistics for polygons:
processing.runalg("saga:gridstatisticsforpolygons","/tmp/processing543c8fb958c34d0a8b161fc7f40b98d0/62593922b4bf47c186075beae8a72e8f/RESULT.sdat","/home/paolo/Scrivania/corso_analisi/QGIS_data/processing/more_backends/municipalities.shp",True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,0,None)

returns wrong values. Zonal statistics from QGIS backend, on the same
data, returns correct ones.
Unclear whether it's a saga or processing bug. Previous versions worked
smoothly.

Thanks for any feedback.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS plugin broke only for me?
Message-ID: <1455622589.3461.7.camel@pierluigi-Aspire-6930G>

Dear All,

After the upgrading to the GRASS 7.03 I'm not able to have the GRASS
plugin working properly.

I'm using ubuntu with all software from repo; in particular I'm using: 
repo 1 for qgis http://qgis.org/ubuntugis/
repo 2 for grass:
http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu

I noticed that under Plugin -> Grass -> GRASS Option I still have grass
7.0.1 (the last installation) while I'm running GRASS 7.0.3

If I run:
GRASS --version I have:
grass --version
GRASS GIS 7.0.3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/grass", line 1363, in <module>
    parse_cmdline()
  File "/usr/bin/grass", line 1275, in parse_cmdline
    message('\n' + readfile(gfile("etc", "license")))
  File "/usr/bin/grass", line 139, in readfile
    f = open(path, 'r')
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'/usr/lib/grass70/etc/license'


Could be that it miss the licence file in the package and this cause the
plugin GRASS does not recognize GRASS data?
In fact if I browse into the GRASS directory I'm not able to add any
GRASS layer.
If I ask to create e new mapset the QGIS crash

Thank to all
Pierluigi

Subject: [Qgis-developer] how to run coverage tests ?
Message-ID: <20160216122235.GA6741@localhost>

Travis found a problem i n master while running the coverage test:
https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/109576392#L1468

but my attempt to run the test locally failed:

 [strk at cdb:/usr/src/qgis/build/master] ctest -R coverage
 Test project /usr/src/qgis/build/master
 No tests were found!!!

I rebuilt making sure ENABLE_COVERAGE was set, but I get the
same exact result. What am I missing ?

It would be useful if the cmake call could end with a summary
of what's enabled and what not, and ideally with WARNINGs
when ENABLE_TESTS was set but not all tests were really enabled.

Dear All,


we would like to inform you all that we have applied on behalf of
OSGeo, as a mentor organization for Google Summer of Code 2016. The
application can be found at [1]. We ask your cooperation to set up the
ideas page within few days. It is extremely important that the ideas
page looks in good shape as it is the key page Google will be looking
at when evaluating OSGeo. As usual, each community will set up its
ideas page on its own wiki and will send us the link, that will be
added by us to the main page [2]. Please forward this email to your
communities.

As past years, OSGeo welcomes like minded projects that wish to
participate under the org’s umbrella, not being official OSGeo
projects. Please contact us to discuss it further.

I manage to find a issue for this problem. You have to compile your UI (even
if it is your main UI) and change your call.
Here are details :

The GRASS provider/plugin only works  if it is run with exactly the same
version of GRASS libs it was built with (GRASS init function in GRASS lib
is checking svn revision).

If you run QGIS with a different GRASS version you should get soft message
like
"GRASS init error: Problem in GRASS initialization, GRASS provider and
plugin will not work : Module built against version $Revision: 64732 $ but
trying to use version $Revision: 64007 $. You need to rebuild GRASS GIS or
untangle multiple installations."

The provider will load as invalid so you see just a directory structure not
GRASS location structure in the browser.

The plugin loads but all actions/tools are disabled except Options, where
you can manually select different GRASS installation (but not libraries the
provider/plugin is started with).

The "New mapset" action is left enabled because of bug, fixed in 8353698.

Hi Devs and Community,

As requested here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/826#issuecomment-184109531

There is a new version of the QGIS commit webhook (script here [0])
installed.

Besides firing on [feature] (or [FEATURE], script is now
case-insensitive) the new version also 'listens' to the label
[needs-docs], giving the developers a way to instruct doc writers to
please add some extra documentation after a fix or addition to an
already excisting functionality.

Please devs use these labels so doc writers have issues to work on and
have an overview of things to do. BUT please also take time to add some
text: either in the commit OR in the docs itself.

Regards,

Richard

Hi Mathieu,

See

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Sysadmin/blob/master/webhooks/github_feature_tracker.cgi#L424

it tests for either [feature] or [needs-docs] somewhere in the commit
message, so go wild and place it wherever you think is best :-)

R,

Thanks Richard

To have a complete list of issues for documentation (especially for
needs_docs tag), does it mean that developers should amend their previous
commits message (don't know if it's doable)  so that a grep can retrieve
these commits? Or do we consider that they are "lost" improvements reports?

Well, not sure if that is technically possible: it means changing the
commit message by adding a label AND writing some prose about the
addition. But dev's feel free to add the label if possible, or else:
sent an email to the documentation team describing what you fixed/added
to excisting features :-)

Harrissou,

Note that this is only true for 2.14 release as I copy pasted the commit 
message into each issue for 2.10 and 2.12. Batch script was up for 2.14.

But if I remembered correctly, Otto did a check for 2.14.

Hi all,
a long standing issue in QGIS is the fact that several commands and core
plugins (not to speak about external plugins) do not honour the "last
used directory rule" for saving files. As a result, the behaviour is
unpredictable and confusing.
I would suggest:
* do a thorough revision of the default destination dir for all commands
(I hope this can be done programmatically)
* maybe adding an option "Always save in the default output directory",
just like the Download dir in Firefox
* making this the default also for external plugins.
Thoughts?
All the best.

Nathan did a huge amount of work on that front during this cycle. Do you
have specifics of any which don't behave correctly now?

Also worth noting that Denis did some work implementing a reusable file
picked widget with correct handling for all this. We just need to switch
across all the various custom file pickers to this standard widget
(hopefully in 2.16?)

I added this handy method to our library of common utils

https://github.com/qgis/pyqgis_wrappers/blob/master/parfait/gui.py#L24

It basically stores the path entered by the user, along with the
caller method, so the next time the user is prompted for files from
that same method, it remembers the last folder. That way, plugin users
just need to use this method instead of doing it the normal qt way,
and they do not have to worry about storing last paths.

The function to find out the caller method name uses introspection and is here:

https://github.com/qgis/pyqgis_wrappers/blob/master/parfait/utils.py#L7

Might need some improvements and testing, but the idea is there, in
case it might be useful

Cheers

this would be good; having different file dialogs is confusing,
sometimes cumbersome.

BTW: can we think of removing the old Open vector, Open raster buttons?

All the best, and thanks.

Hi All

Just another appeal to all of you out there who are doing cool stuff with
QGIS - we need your help! In May this year we are holding the 2nd QGIS user
conference in Girona, Spain [1] - kindly hosted by the Spanish SIG Libre
organisation.

We would really like to have a good mix of 'deep technical' talks and 'use
cases'. Many users may come to the conference looking to see what can be
done with QGIS and FOSSGIS in general and it would be really wonderful if
those of you out there using QGIS for your daily work could come along and
show off all your hard work! If you are interested in presenting, please
visit this page [2] and apply!

with a recent master, the coordinates shown in the status bar are not

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Some issues from GRASS plugin
Message-ID: <56C5B95E.8040003@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
thanks to a course, we now have some more testing on the plugin (master
of a few days ago). Generally it's a huge improvement, and D&D import
and copy is pretty exciting. A few issues:
* if I create of a new location without a project open, obviously the
button to set up the extent based on QGIS canvas is greyed out; if I
close the dialog, open a project, and go back to the New mapset, it is
impossible to set up the extent from canvas
* the panel is far too wide for old 1024px screens, and cannot be shrunk
* if a location is added to favourites, its content is no longer usable
as GRASS data (the GRASS database has to be added instead)
* while deleting a raster from the browser I got a crash, but I'm
struggling reproducing it.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Strange behaviour of regexp_match expression
	functions
Message-ID: <843d026650770d9d53e5e7f0e03c0d9d@carto.net>

Hi, 

In QGIS 2.12 and master I have very strange behavior of the regexp_match
function (probably also regexp_replace and regexp_substr). 

I have to double-escape special regexp-signs. 

Taking the example from the help-text: 

regexp_match('QGIS ROCKS','\sROCKS') --> doesn't work 

but 

regexp_match('QGIS ROCKS','\\sROCKS') 

works. 

Isn't this a bug? If it isn't, then it is at least a very strange
behaviour of QGIS and the help text would then be wrong. 

Thank you for having a look at this, 

Andreas

Message-ID: <56C5D6D7.1020902@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
in Processing, saga raster calculator does not use layers honouring the
order set up in the selection (I select one layer as b, and another one
from the list is used instead).
It's an old bug that resurfaced. Feedback welcome before reopening the
old bug.
All the best.

The custom folder is not for temp files

it is for files without a full path, so if you enter "myfile.shp", it
will put it in [custom_folder]/myfile.shp

that way you dont have to write the full path in case you want all
your final (not temp) outputs in the same folder

It is described in the manual :-P

Hope this helps

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS server renders tiled map annotations on every
	tile
Message-ID: <1455811632727-5251467.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I'm having some map annotation on some project, not pinned to a location. I
use it to let user see some informations about the map he is using (metadata
are to deeply hidden in project properties for that). 
When asking qgis server to render tiles on any layer, every tile show the
annotation. 
Is there an option to avoid that ? If not, should annotation been rendered
in Qgis server context? 

Cheers
Régis

Hello,

from QGIS Server point of view, a tile is just a small map, it doesn't have
any information about the fact that the tile will be patched to build a
bigger map.

You should disable annotations from the project configuration if you are
planning to serve the map as tiles.

If you want to keep that configurable, you might want to move annotations
to a particular layer and selectively show/hide that layer depending on the
requested image size, a simple Server plugin could be helpful in that case.

Or maybe you could use something like MapProxy - which allows to fetch a
bigger chunk of the data in a single request and chops it up into the
tiles and caches them. Then the tiles wouldn't be served by QGIS server
directly, but from the MapRroxy. 

MapProxy has a concept of "MetaTiles" to help solve this label issue -
see http://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/labeling.html 

I am not really experienced with it - my guess is that the "MetaTiles"
only partially solves the issue, but doesn't fully fix it.

Hi Even,

I'm currently exploring this approach (in memory file), but I'm stuck
on how to actually write the string contents to a memory file prior to
opening to it with GDAL. I gather for the python bindings I could
utilise FileFromMemBuffer, but I can't find any similar replacement in
the c api.

What's the correct approach to use here?

Perfect - works great!!

Coming in QGIS 2.16... paste copied geojson text directly into a layer
as features :)

No, we havent' moved to the main repo. However, not much work has been done
lately, and we haven't discussed about how to continue or when to move all
this to the main repo.

Looks like the project is not being very succesful...

Hi all,

recently GitHub introduced templates support for issues and
pul-request, see [0, 1].
Maybe we can utilize this functionality in our repos. For example,
issue template
can be used for the QEP repository and PR templates for main QGIS repo as
well as for QGIS-Processing and maybe some other.

Opinions?

still, it seems to me quite important. Perhaps developing in a separate
repo brings away the attention of many.
Maybe we should just advertise it more aggressively, also among the
hiundreds of plugin developers? Please remember that many of them are
not on this list, so may be completely unaware of your project.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi,

I think for me it was mainly about timing.  It was over the christmas
period so I tend to avoid doing too much around then, and with 3.0 planned
I think we can have some direction now.

I dont think it wil hurt to add it to the main repo. While we develop,
and the methods are not used yet, it will be just a bunch of files
with dead code, so it is not risky, and maybe it is easier to engage
people that way

Let me know if there is something i can do

Cheers

It certainly is. How can we make this more prominent for plugin
developers? Can we add it to the Plugin builder, or suggest there to use
it? Or add a suggestion on http://plugins.qgis.org/ HP?
All the best, and thanks.

I'm discovering that 'old' topic.
Yes, I really like the idea, but I wasn't aware about that.
I think the UI should be more uniform between plugins and QGIS, for
instance to have :
- the same combobox about layers (using the symbol for the geometry type
and the EPSG if the checkbox is checked in the Processing settings)
- the same combobox for table fields (symbol with the kind of field :
integer, char ...)
- the same output field with the menu (save to temp file, save to vector
file, save to ...) like in processing.
- ...
So I will try to use that and contribute to these wrappers if I can.

By the way, is it possible to recommend on the pyqgis cookbook (or the qgis
documentation) to use the processing framework more often ? A lot of
plugins are useful but we can't use them in batch mode or in complex
workflow. Moreover, they often produce only shapefile.
There are some very nice settings in Processing like "use selected
features", default output format for vector and raster ... I think plugins
should try to more compliant with these settings.

Message-ID: <6b00806c932147a292c5ded08dd1ca42@Exchange1.fugro.de>

Hello,

we have an issue with our new plugin "GeODinQGIS". Unfortunately it is impossible for me to change the plugin title in the repository from "GeODin QGIS" to "GeODinQGIS", without white spaces. The version title with white spaces causes an error in the QGIS plugin manager as the plugin title does not equal the official plugin name. Any suggestions?

Here's the link tot he plugin:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/GeODinQGIS/

Given that we have 3.0 on the cards and that has a planned API break and
refactor I think this stuff is better planned for that so we can all focus
effort on making that good.

Thoughts?

I try to convince people of that. If you are writing an analysis
plugin, don't do it without Processing, since it will be harder and
you dont get all those advantages. However, I dont want to sound too
strong on that, since i dont want it to sound like i want impose that
on developers, but it might be worth at least mentioning that to
plugin authors when they upload their plugins and we accept them...

I will be happy to provide guidance to any plugin authors that want to
convert their plugins into Processing providers

Just a little advice - we need to push people toward the standard widgets
for these, eg QgsFieldComboBox, QgsMapLayerComboBox. Reimplementing then
with new Python versions isn't a good idea, since it breaks consistency
with core (and is also a lot of extra work!)

I would say, we even need to advertise the custom widgets.
All these widgets are availble in Qt Designer, it's quite easy to use 
them from there.

Hi, 

The upcoming user conference in Girona may be a good opportunity to
present and advertise about both the common set of Python functions, but
also about the standard and custom widgets. 

The CfP is still running and they are looking for more submissions.
Maybe someone could do a presentation for Python plugin authors to make
them aware?

+1 to promote the custom widgets. I dont think that many plugin
developers are aware of them, since there is no documentation about
them AFAIK

Yes, exactly. I've heard of them one time.
Maybe we could add them into the plugin builder as an example. Developers
will see them in the code.

Is there a list of the public API of Processing ?
For plugins developpers, there are many classes in Processing but a lot of
them shouldn’t be used outside of Processing I guess, right ?
I can see : tools/vector, tools/raster, core/GeoAlgorithm, core/parameters
...

Message-ID: <4f596801cd4249929ff468ba88bbe9c8@Exchange1.fugro.de>

Hello,

still having problems with the plugin "GeODinQGIS". I've deleted the current version from the repo and uploaded another one [937] with proper compression rate fort he zip. Hope, this will work, please approve it. Actually we don't know, why the plugin manager failed do download all plugin files properly. Especially _init_.py, resources and metadata were missing, and others, but were uploaded to the repository. Do you have any ideas and suggestions?

Kind regards

Christian

Hi,

I support Etienne's proposal regarding UI guidelines.
I'm sproradically collecting these here [1],
like the "File open..." dialog which remembers the directory,
or preferring GeoPackage over Shapefiles for storing.
There are quite some more things which to my mind when thingking of UI.
Eventually it could also help to point to "good" plugins?

Hi all,
I think giving guidelines and coding standards is of crucial importnace 
to keep the plugin ecosystem thriving, especially in view of the 
upcoming migration to Py3 and Qt5.
IMHO the best ways of doing this should be:
* improving Plugin builder, adding all we think is necessary
* writing a Plugin dev howto, pointing to specific cases, recommended 
styles, etc.
Any taker?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Why does python-qgis depend on liblwgeom?
Message-ID: <56C87493.6000202@xs4all.nl>

The python-qgis package now includes a dependency on liblwgeom for the
Debian distributions, but not Ubuntu. A build dependency on
liblwgeom-dev was not added along with the dependency in the commit. [0]

Why does python-qgis depend on the liblwgeom library package?

liblwgeom is not used in the build process, so ${shlibs:Depends} doesn't
include the dependency automatically.

I suspect the dependency was added to have the liblwgeom package
installed already when users choose to install the Processing LWGEOM
Provider plugin.

The plugin source show that it searches for liblwgeom.so which is
provided by the liblwgeom-dev package. Because the plugin doesn't try
the Multi-Arch paths, so when the postgis package changes to Multi-Arch
paths the plugin will stop working.

Because the python-qgis package doesn't seem to require liblwgeom
itself, including it in its Depends is not appropriate, Recommends
should be used instead.

It's also better to not depend on the library package directly, and
instead depend on liblwgeom-dev which will pull in the appropriate
library package removing the need to change the dependency every time
the liblwgeom SONAME changes.

Hi Alexander,

I recently started to write a CONTRIBUTING.md [1] file which is also
shown when opening a PR. But it's always one click away and I think
moving this to a PR template would be much better.
It will probably reduce the roundtrip if when creating a PR every
contributor is reminded of

 * Did you run prepare-commit.sh?
 * Have you written a unit test where applicable?
 * Did you create .sip bindings?
 * Did you write API documentation?
 * Is your commit message meaningful?
 * Did you add [needs-docs] or [feature] tags to the commit message and
include enough information for documentors in the commit message?

Is there more information that should be included?
Would you mind setting up a draft for it?

Matthias

Hi,

As an beginner, I have successfully build QGIS from qgis source code 2.8.3
using MSVS 2010. May developers had helped me in building this. Thanks to
all.

Now I want to create an EXE using this build.

Please tell me the the procedure for creating qgis installer using MSVS
2010.

Thanks

Regards

sorry, decripted message :)

Hi all,
I'm testing the new External Resource widget. I read that the aim is
also to replace the Photo widget, right?

In my project, with the Photo widget I can display the picture of the
feature, while with the External Editor it does not appear in the Form
window.

Am I missing something?

I'm working with the compiled dev version on debian.

Thanks!

Matteo

Hello,

if you are using an auto-generate form, you need to be sure that the 
window size of the form is large or long enough to display the image.
I've made some tests with this nightly build on MS-Windows and I've seen 
this problem. But once the form size has been changed, the picture is 
always displayed.

Try to change form window size and tell us if you have something 
displayed...

Cheers,

That's pretty weird..
With the exact same window size, the photo widget shows the picture
while the external resource not..	

Thanks for the help!

The "Set current QGIS extent" button was disabled if canvas extent was
not valid but it was not re-enabled when it became valid again. I have
fixed that in 81a1f6.

The "New mapset" dialog? Here it is resizable and the first time it is
started with 528x523, the geometry is saved/restored then. Can you
resize it? Which tab cannot be shrunken?

Confirmed, fixed in847f1c0.

Deleting a GRASS map itself should not harm, it launches g.remove.
More probably it crashes when browser content is refreshed which is
done in threads. However, the functions should be locked where race
condition can happen and that would be probably happening in other
situations. What about deleting raster layer which is added in canvas?
Trace back would be helpful.

If there are no modules open, I can resize that to about 467x362. Is
it a particular module or shell which makes it big?

Hi Matteo,

Indeed external resource widget aims at replacing both photo widget and 
file widget.

I can't reproduce the bug you describe.
You can provide a small demo project?

Cheers,

Denis

Hi Radim,
467 on a 1024 screen is already quite big. I know it's old hardware, but
still in use.

In the properties of the field, check "Integrated document viewer" and 
choose "Image".

Should be it ;)

According to https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/qgisdevelopersguide/hig.html
"No dialog should exceed 580 pixels in height and 1000 pixels in width."

yes, but is this a dialog? In my system, it gets stuck to the main GUI
as a panel, by default.
I acknowledge however that the usability of QGIS on small screens is
challenging since long. Perhaps we just have to leave with it.
All the best.

It is dockable, if it is to big to be used docked, it has to be run undocked.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing tests
Message-ID: <56CC4965.9010601@opengis.ch>

You have probably noticed that recently some tests for processing have
been included.

They run geo-algorithms and check if their result matches with what is
expected.

It is very easy to expand this suite. Test definitions are written in
the form of yaml. Templates for this definitions can be created from the
processing history. There are some possibilities to fine-tune the
comparison (e.g. skip fields, allow values to be compared with an
epsilon, match a result file with a series of regular expressions...)
which have been added more recently. At the moment it runs tests for
some qgis algorithms and gdal algorithms.

If you have 5 minutes to spare today, please help and add a test!

More information can be found in our blog [1] and the readme [2].

Thanks a lot,
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Begging for some fixes before LTR release
Message-ID: <CAECJsSr_2qEE1hGbC5+6CMcx6z1tDFEyzRdAHQeVkJMG+zLBLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi developers,

At less than a week for the release of the second LTR version (QGIS 2.14),
I'd like to draw your attention on two main issues that are not set as
blockers but I'd beg you to solve them:

#13575 (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13575): adds all the available layers to
the legend in print composer instead of just adding those that are visible
in the map canvas. Not set as blocker (it should imho) but AFAICT this
behaviour was introduced in LTR 2.8 and it's not optimal at all when you
have a very big project.

#13418 (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13418): it makes preset visibility
pretty unusable with print composers in (large) project with multiple print
composers. For any change you do to a preset, you need to manually echo it
in the map composer properties if you want your maps to be up to date. It's
just unmanageable in, once again, big project (since 2.10 if I'm not wrong).

I know that there are currently some blocking issues, maybe more sensitive
but these ones just block me (and surely many other people) in my daily
work. I'd be grateful to you if someone can give a look to these issues.

Thanks for the fixes :) and thanks for the great work you're doing with
QGIS.

Hi all,
I remember a lengthy discussion about having somehow better OSX
packages. I think we decided to buy a signature from Apple to have
"official" packages. I see that our download page is still the one by
kingchaos: any plan to finalise this before the release of 2.14?
Thanks.

Sorry, I'm completely ignorant when it comes to OSX, what is precisely the
advantage of having "signed" packages over the current situation?

Hope they are cheap though.

Hi,

I guess that activating the contectual legend in the canvas, also in
the composer the not visible layers should disapperaing.

Is this ok for your usage ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Server] performance questions
Message-ID: <1456237257701-5252233.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
we are working on using qgis server here and we face some performance issues
on big data sets. Cache is not an option for those layers that will be
edited by users. Currently performances are not acceptable for production
uses.  Here is a couple of questions that I could not answer by myself on
the net:

1- Clarifying multithread on server side vs multithread on desktop:

We use qgis 2.12 server from qgis repository for debian on a 4 core Xeon
(2.1Ghz) + 16Go RAM. 

We configured apache2 with MPM worker and we have a pool of 10
qgis_mapserv.fcgi waiting for client request. 
The behaviour here is that one client will only consume one fcgid process,
when desktop can use several processes to make some parallel rendering of
project layers. 
When having QGIS desktop  using only one thread, I have similar rendering
time. The difference is purely proportionnal to CPU speed difference. 
Did we miss something in configuration process or is that the intended
behavior? I did try to use QGIS_OPTION_PATH on a QGIS2.ini but I really
can't be sure it is really being used.
Do QGIS packages miss the multithread option on compile cmake options? 
If this is expected, does the web architecture would allow to have fcgid do
parallel rendering like desktop? Would that be a big work (I could partly
fund that)?


2- Overhead on first request with postgres complex view compared to
shapefiles

We have almost only postgis views being used as QGIS layers. Qgis server
builds get capabilities and requests views to get extent and primary keys.
There is a severe overhead for the first wms request by a client session.
When generating the image takes about 7s, the first request can take from 24
to 30s. Desktop multihreaded will get the image in about 3s (same postgres
server, same network). 
That overhead starts to become annoying on desktop side too, but it's only
qgs loading time, once in a work session. Does someone have any idea that
one day postgis could collect such metadata on views so that QGIS do not
have to scan all rows when data are in views? Direct access to tables, or
same project with shp datasources do not show that overhead on server nor in
desktop.


Thanks for your hints, 
Cheers

Régis

I Guess the time difference between the qgis desktop and qgis-server
when using a postgres,

is due to the protocol.
Infact the http is a connection-less session-less protocoll,
so after every map the qgis-server disconnect from postgres.

Instead when you work on a qgis desktop as a user on its own pc you
are connectin with a postgres and sray connected for all the time.

So the postgres don't waste time to open and staryup your connection.

Also don't forget that if you stay about 18-20 minutes without do
nothing on qgis in a postgres connection.
The postgres kill your connection and your qgis go in crazy state.

Hi,

For your point 2, is this bug related to your issue
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13232 ?

Hi Andrea, 
You are right for the overhead part. This would not big a big issue if we
did not have the overhead on postgres side for extent querying on SQL views.
The same dataset in shape is open fast even at first connection. 
We use pgpool here so we do not have such trouble with idle connections
being killed. 
Cheers
Régis

Hi Régis, 

QGIS server is single-threaded. You can't simply turn on multi-threaded
rendering in QGIS server. The other issue is that each Apache FCGI
process has it's own set of cache. So if you have 5-10 parallel Apache
threads or processes each thread/process has it's own cache. If your
client hits a thread that has the cache unititialized you will have wait
longer until this cache is fillled. 

I once asked Marco whether one could 

a) have a shared cache for all Apache threads or processes 

b) support multi-threaded rendering 

But he said it would be very complicated to implement a) and b), if not
impossible. Maybe other devs have other views. Note that was about 2
years ago, when I last discussed this with Marco. 

--------------------- 

Nevertheless I believe there would be room for performance improvements
in QGIS server - if interested parties share their efforts (be it dev
time or financial resources). 

BTW: 

did you switch of QGIS server python plugins? If you don't need them, I
recommend you switch them off - both for security reasons, but also
there was a huge performance problem with QGIS server Python plugins
just recently. See http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13919 - luckily this was
fixed just recently. Depending on the version you use, this may have a
negative impact on your installation.

Hi Alessandro, 
probably not, we do not have inherited tables and we have autovacuum
activated. St_estimated_extent is correctly called when loading postgis
tables. The matter is that we use very few table, but mainly views and
materialized views. Postgres does not collect metadatas on views: 
 See https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/ticket/510 
Having that would be a great improvement. I would be avalaible for funding.
I already asked to postgres community and had no feedback.. maybe I asked
the wrong place. 

Any idea concerning multithreading configuration?

The answer from strk  makes sense to me, I might be wrong but calculating
estimated metadata on a query doesn't make much sense to me.

Sorry, don't, but I'll have a look.

Hi Regis,

The shapefile is obviously more fast in opne than a postgres connection.
Is due to the different need of resources.
The postgres need to assign a lot of resources for every connection that 
it is opening.

I do't know quite well the pgpool solution, but I guess it cannot 
helpyou because AFAIK it is only for dirct connection.
You should set is with a fastcgis but you have heowever the problem that 
postgres interrupt brutally the connection after some ten of minutes 
without any byte exchanging with the clinet.

These mean that alsoif you use a fastcgi protocol but have a service not 
used for more than 30 minutes it will break connection from postgres 
side and so it need to restart the connection (and so take some time to 
do it) when the user ask for a new map.

To avoid also all these questions we use the spatialite db that is fast 
like a shapefile toopen and have no the problem of connection and break 
of connection like the postgres.

Oh, I read too fast Strk's comment. Sorry for that. I won't explore that
dead end no more.
Another idea, maybe autodiscovering extent on data is a good thing for
desktop, less for server. Mapserver takes extent from mapfile, not from
data. Could we imagine adding options to force extents from project
properties and prevent qgis server from asking that to postgis? Such queries
are BTW  very consuming thing on big datasets and I can't imagine big
servers with many sessions keeping on querying postgis geometries just to
get such extent.

Good to know, thanks. unfortunately, my current use case is not compatible
with data replication in spatialite. For some others, I will test that.

Yes, that sounds a nice idea.

We could create a new config option for that and cache the extents.
I'm not sure about how deep into the providers this would lead us, or if it
can be better done into the server itself, but worth exploring.

You should definitely add a feature request.

We did not activate explicitly server plugins yet. we have no
QGIS_PLUGINPATH variable set, is that enough to deactivate server plugins?

Yes, but Andreas probably meant that plugin support is still compiled into
the server.

Still, we never measured any noticeable performance issue with plugins
enabled (as long as thre aren't any of course, otherwise it will obviously
depend on what the plugins do).

There was indeed a performance issue with the new access control
implementation (now hopefullt fixed) but IIRC it's still only in master, to
be release soon.

Also, we aren't aware of any security issue, if you (Andreas) know about
any security issue I would definitely like to know more about that.

Ok then, I will try compiling server qgis somewhere else.

I was saying that unless you are using master  (and you don't since you're
on 2.12), you probably don't need to, but if you find any measurable
performance difference, please let me know.

Not set as blocker (it should imho) but AFAICT this behaviour was introduced in LTR 2.8 and it's not optimal at all when you have a very big project.

For any change you do to a preset, you need to manually echo it in the map composer properties if you want your maps to be up to date. It's just unmanageable in, once again, big project (since 2.10 if I'm not wrong).

+1 this is indeed very painful.

that's not really true, it depends if extent exist in mapfile or not and data 
format in input. If it doesn't exist in mapfile, mapserver will look at the 
data but such things are really to avoid.

yes - if you compile yourself, you can disable it in the CMAKE settings.

yes - only master versions between 2.12 and 2.14 were affected. It has

I am not aware of any security issues around QGIS server Python plugins. 
It is just good to disable stuff if you don't need it and opt-in if you 
need it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How can I use QgsRasterDataProvider.write from
	Python in QGIS?
Message-ID: <CAG-h0-_z3a-Ko+W7ZHw0TW5o096rOwC6ArJ9i=GZHAtLVe=ANw@mail.gmail.com>

Sorry for cross-posting. I have asked that question before on StackExchange
[1] without much success. I would be very thankful if you can point me in
the right direction.

I would like to change a raster cell value from Python in QGIS using
QgsRasterDataProvider.write method. It takes the following arguments (from
QGIS API)
<http://qgis.org/api/classQgsRasterDataProvider.html#af15b6038b5c59276a4ef87598b919482>
:

virtual bool QgsRasterDataProvider::write   (
    void *      data,
    int     band,
    int     width,
    int     height,
    int     xOffset,
    int     yOffset
)

How can I construct the pointer (data) with a new cell value?

I am working on a plugin modifying single raster cell value [2] and the
QgsRasterDataProvider.write method would let me write a raster without
using GDAL.

FYI - to try to address this in future I've added a new entry to the
changelog detailing all the new PyQGIS classes added in 2.14 with a
bit of description for each (and link to API docs). Hopefully this
gives some more exposure to any newly added widgets/classes/etc.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] deactivate automatic rotation of labels
Message-ID: <56CD6227.1090508@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Is there any mean of deactivating the rotation of labels ?

We do complex manual edition of labels (position and orientation).
Sometimes, we leave the label at 0° orientation (i.e. the correspoding 
orientation field is null).
Then, when we print a rotated map, labels are kept horizontal, while I 
would expect them to turn along with the map.

Is there any mean to achieve this?
Is the only way to do a COALESCE(rotation_field, 0) when printing 
(although that would make the label rotation map unusable).


Cheers,

Denis

Message-ID: <CABfWMAVgtebodnwgBbLeeTgqowRWhcjTDHGWxa=s5RVWbbxzuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,

I need to learn how to insert new python modules inside the Osgeo4W
installer.

Where is the documentation that I need to read and who can allow me to
insert inside the repo the new modules?

I need to add

- reportlab (pdf)
- pygraphviz (graph generator through graphviz - only 32bit)
- sqlalchemy (Database ORM)

Thanks for the help,

Best regards.

Packaging instructions are at
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/PackagingInstructions

https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/ExternalPythonPackages has some information
about installing external plugins (that could be repackaged afterwards).

Why only 32bit?

Because graphviz is distribuited as .exe installer only in 32bit...and I
have not enough skills to compile at 64 bit.

I will the a look to yours links, and I'll try to understand If I am enough
expert to add new python modules.

Hi

It was an omission on my part - will fix it for 2.14 (and back add the missing 2.12 one).

Thanks for heads up!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QtWebKit 2.3
Message-ID: <1456398609757-5252791.post@n6.nabble.com>

OpenLayers is moving away from the Closure library. This is A Good Thing, as
abandoning Closure will decrease OpenLayers' filesize considerably.

However, it means that OpenLayers now doesn't work on older browsers. While
not a big deal for end-users' desktop browsers, as very few are affected,
it's a problem for QGIS plugin developers.

Qt4.8 uses QtWebKit 2.2 (I believe), and this *is* affected. It can be fixed
by adding two polyfills (likely to increase in number in the future).

qgis2web uses QtWebKit for its preview, so I've had to add the polyfills. I
don't like doing this, as it adds bloat, and at the moment (unless I
redesign the code), the polyfills are added to exported maps as well, which
really don't need them.

QtWebKit 2.3 was developed and released as a community project, outwith the
Qt project. 2.3 includes an up-to-date WebKit version, so it would fix these
problems. Can anyone give an opinion on whether it would be possible to
package QtWebKit 2.3 with qgis2web?

I obviously realize that QGIS3 will remove this issue, with Qt5. However,
QGIS3 is a while off yet - there will be several OL3 releases until then -
and QGIS2 is likely to remain in use for a long time.

Does anyone have an opinion, or any expertise in this area?

I Agree with Tom. I have several plugins not released due to QWebKit
issues. It would be wonderful to have an up to date Qgis LTR supporting
QwebKit 2.3, before Qgis 3.0.

Message-ID: <1456419239722-5252891.post@n6.nabble.com>

Tried the 2.5d renderer for the first time - terrific work.

I have one suggestion, and one question. Suggestion: allow users to specify
the sun position, so that the walls shaded according to aspect are
consistent with eg aerial photography layers.

Question: I created the simple 2.5d style with different roof colour, and
then apply a categorized renderer. The roof colour is then lost, as far as I
can make out. Is there a way to preserve it?

If I am not wrong, Pirmin worked on that and it is already available
in Plugin Builder... I remember he showed it to me att FOSS4G last
year, and I guess it will be already in the latest version...

You can transform the renderer to a default style. Then have a look at
the expression defining the wall color, it defines the lightness of the
wall based on the aspect of the wall. If you provide me with a good
variable to introduce there, I'll happily add it as a configuration option.

First transform it to a standard renderer, lock the roof color and then
transform it to a categorized one in a second step. I think that should
work.

Yes, that works - apologies for the noise.

Some other questions/observations on the 2.5d renderer (let me know if this
is an inappropriate place to discuss this):

1. There is an "Angle" field. I misinterpreted what this did. It seems to
alter the angle of verticals. Is this useful? I thought it would change the
angle by which the camera is raised above ground level.

2. Rotating the map rotates the 2.5d render. To me, that's not expected, and
the render should be reapplied after the map rotation has taken place.

3. OTF reprojection seems to break the renderer, to my eyes.

Thanks again - it's a great addition

Tom

Subject: [Qgis-developer] A perfect day to write a new test!
Message-ID: <56D0398E.8020304@opengis.ch>

Hi all, today is a great day to add a new test to QGIS.

This is the start of an almost 4 year old email [1]. But despite its age, its headline is more valid than ever.

It's Friday again, so in the spirit of "Test Friday", it's a great day to write a test. If you don't have much time or if you don't feel comfortable with programming, there is a new infrastructure for processing tests in place which requires GIS experts and not programmers to write tests [2]. Go check it out!

I have already spent some time today and created a pull request to improve the behavior of epected failures [3].

Happy Test Friday!

Regards
Matthias

Same for the height attribute. If you improve your trigonometry skills
when checking for the sun-position variable you can also add have a look
at this ;)

That would require the map rotation to be available as expression
variable (not sure if it is). Compensating for it with this variable
shouldn't be hard.

Message-ID: <DB3PR08MB025222CC8CEC90956584D3CEA7A70@DB3PR08MB0252.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

i'm learning to compile QGIS in Ubuntu 14.04,
managed to compile QGIS 2.14 and installed
in a custom dir with make install,

with:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

QGIS starts (by the way the 2.14 splash screen image is HUGE :))

with some warnings and one error:

ERROR 4: `/initrd.img' not recognised as a supported file format.

but it seems to work, anyway i cannot find the GRASS Plugin, is there
some other variable to set so that QGIS can see it ?
libgrass*7.so are present in the lib/qgis/plugins/ directory so i do not
think there is a compile issue (?)


thanks ! Roy.

hi,

I was trying to implement dynamic setting of Expression Variables when handling server requests (Example use case: I want to render another logo in a composition map depending on a project-variable), as I got stuck testing the behaviour of expression variables in server-requests.
I have a print composition map, where a label text is set to a project scope expression variable. When I execute the server request the label is not printed (or printed empty).

Does QGIS server not use expression variables defined at project level?

thanks,

Hi Tom, 

The project variables should work fine in server context. 

Are you sure that the QGIS server you use is really up-to-date? 

The variable support in QGIS is relatively recent and if your server is
an older version it probably doesn't support them.

Ciao Marco,

is it mandatory to use ccmake? because i compiled with "regular"

cmake, make, make install ...

ERROR 4: `/initrd.img' not recognised as a supported file format.

but it seems to work, anyway i cannot find the GRASS Plugin, is there
some other variable to set so that QGIS can see it ?
libgrass*7.so<http://7.so> are present in the lib/qgis/plugins/ directory so i do not
think there is a compile issue (?)


thanks ! Roy.

Nope just pass -DWITH_GRASS=ON to cmake. 
Ccmake is a great way to see what switches you can use.

Sirs:

The /initrd.img probably should be specifically excluded from any scan 
list.  It is a "ln -s" link to the real file on my Ubuntu system 
"/boot/initrd.img-4.2.0-30-generic" which as I recall, is the temporary 
file system that is loaded when the kernel first boots. Parts of the 
file are released (freed) when they are no longer needed.

If you copy this file "initrd.img-4.2.0-30-generic" to a temp location 
and add the .gz suffix, it can be gunzip into the equivalent of an 
.iso.  Use a file manager to temporarily mount it. The iso contents look 
like a Linux file system.

Regards,

J.O. Williams

hi andreas,

thanks but I tried with 2.12.3 and master.
I also can confirm now that no project variables are added to the expression-scope (qgsexpressioncontext.cpp:592) when executing a server request. I added this line:

fprintf(stderr,"var: %s val: %s\n",variableName.toAscii().data(),varValueString.toAscii().data()); 

after 
592: scope->setVariable( variableName, varValueString );

and I get the correct output when I load the project in QGIS desktop, but nothing when executing qgis_mapserv.fcgi with a working QUERY_STRING from the command line. The output is correct, but all expressions are missing.

Can anybody confirm that those project-variables work in server?

thanks,
Tom

It is, from memory it's @map_rotation.

I recompiled QGIS using ccmake but the problem remains,
QGIS starts but fails to recognize GRASS Plugin which is
not available in the installed plugins list ...

any other idea?

I had compiled Qgis 2.8.4 successfully. Can any body tell me how to make
installer exe of it to install on Windows. I had used msvs2010 for build.

I have made some comparison on requests done when QGIS Server is called for
a simple GetMap, on the first initialization and aftewards when the cache
is found.

Here are the logs

When QGIS builds the maplayer object, ie when there is no cache for this
layer yet (first call, for example with a getcapabilities). This is only
done if no cache is found for this layer in QGIS Server

1/ Log when estimated metadata is used (and stats are available in PostGIS)
https://paste.sh/yguqyRWL#EPcHHVH3uuijGgEtzH0pAlHb

2/ Log when QGIS does not use the metadata for a layer . Which means this
is done for any view at present, since no estimated metadata is available,
or also for a table if the user forgot to check the option "use metadata"
when he first created the Postgis connection (which can be often the case
because this option is not checked by default in PostgreSQL connection
dialog )
https://paste.sh/frCglZ9A#A1nQ6BXtdBeEiZWQmTJP8v9l

3/ Log when a layer is already in QGIS Server cache, for example for a
GetMap request. This means for table and views, since it does not depend on
metadata existence or not, but only on cache
https://paste.sh/Rkvqf757#K1MCRitovIxMblBVils1VF7r

My conclusions here :

In the first example 1/, we see all the queries QGIS does to get all the
needed information for building the maplayer object
* postgis information : postgis_version() ,  postgis_geos_version()
* search for topology features -> not really usefull server side I think (
? )
* feature count . In 1, estimated metadata is used, so this query is fast
* layer extent calculation . In 1/ QGIS uses st_estimatedextent, so it also
should be fast


In the second example 2/, without available stats (no use of estimated
metadata for views or when the option is not checked in layer ), we can see
the performance killing queries (for complex or big datasets) done by QGIS
to get the needed information :

* check if the field used as primary key is unique :
SELECT count(distinct ""nb"")=count(""nb"") FROM (SELECT row_number()
OVER() AS nb, * FROM ""2013"".v_geo_parcelle) AS ""subQuery_0"""

* Get the extent :
SELECT st_extent(""geom"") FROM (SELECT row_number() OVER() AS nb, * FROM
""2013"".v_geo_parcelle) AS ""subQuery_0""


In 3/, QGIS has already built the cache for the maplayer, and only fetches
the features, which is very fast.


My thoughts on how to improve QGIS server performance with PostgreSQL
provider (and possibly for other providers as well )

* check that layer cache in QGIS server is well used.
- I do not know for example if the 100 default number is for the whole
server (which is then reached very fast and will become useless if there
are many projects served by QGIS), or for each projects.
- there was a bug in QGIS Server which did not use cache whenever a GetMap
request was called with an empty STYLE parameter. It has been fixed but
check your version is not older to this commit :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/a5450a78ffcbba9a75afa8be43460ad741fea050

* Add an option in QGIS ( in OWS server properties ) to tell QGIS Server to
not get some information if the user who publish the project knows what he
does, meaning
  - use the extent stored in <maplayer> and do not ask for it server side
  - do NOT check that the primary key is unique -> the person who built the
project and publish it does know that his layer has a unique primary key.
Note that there is a limit in the number of layers QGIS Server will cache (
100 by default).

* Add a even more hard way of telling QGIS Server "Never delete the cache
for this layer, as the extent and the other properties wont change (even if
I allow editing inside my known layer extent )" . This means the cache will
be store permanently for this layer and would be lost only if the apache /
nginx server is reloaded . I do not know if it is feasible

* Store layers metadata "the QGIS way" in the database, as we do for
styles. This means the users building the project has enough rights on the
postgreSQL database, but could be a handy QGIS solution for production
ready projects. This way we could store the metadata for tables AND views,
in a format close to what QGIS needs to build the maplayer object. The user
would define some options, such as cache duration in seconds ( for example,
overwrite the cache if the stored information has more than 1 week, or keep
it as long as I do not manually remove it, via a -1 value for cache
duration ).

As a conclusion, I think we really need a "QGIS Server context true/false"
when using some of the core classes, such as maplayer, to be able to do
some performance improvements.

Régis, René-Luc and myself can have a look at it, if you need some work
done toward this goal.

Cheers,
Michaël

Sorry for the question.
I follow the video on vimeo, but the extrusion doesn't work properly. It's
extruded only a vertex of the whole polygon.

It's a temporary bug, I must to open a ticket?

I'm working on windows 7, Osgeo setup.

Hi,

In a Python plugin [1] we implemented HTTP "Basic Authentication" and
"NTLM authentication".

Now I'm still looking for a solution using OAuth 2.0 for build-in WxS
(WMS/WMTS, WFS) as well as for Python plugins.
This seems to be also of some interest for other QGIS users [2].


The only code related to OAuth2 I found is in the CartoDB plugin [3].
But this does not help WxS nor my Python plugin.

Also Paolo's pointer to LizMap relates not to QGIS Python plugin but
to restricted access to lizmap online AFAIK.

I heard about the authentication configuration system with master password [4].
But we still need more information when the API is available.

Any news on this, and on OAuth implementations for WxS and Python plugins?

Hi All


Over the last weeks we have been working hard on getting the visual changelog ready for 2.14. A huge thanks to those that have been contributing to it, most appreciated! Soon it will be published live on http://qgis.org and I want to ask if you could all help with some peer review. There are still a few entries without detailed descriptions, credits to authors and funders, images etc. I will be making a last few tweaks to the reporting layout (e.g. to sort sponsors by sponsorship level). Could I ask you all to take a look here:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/2.14.0/


and give me any feedback, improvements etc. Or feel free to edit directly if you have the needed access. Please don’t tweet or otherwise publicise the above link until the official release announcements are out (from Jürgen).

Regards

Tim

Thanks for your hard work with this Tim!

Just wondering, is there any facility at the moment for setting the display

Soon it will be published live on http://qgis.org <http://qgis.org/> and I want to ask if you could all help with some peer review. There are still a few entries without detailed descriptions, credits to authors and funders, images etc. I will be making a last few tweaks to the reporting layout (e.g. to sort sponsors by sponsorship level). Could I ask you all to take a look here:

Its on our roadmap but sorry we don’t have it in place yet. I will have it done for the next release.

​Hi,

Where can I find a description of the currently implemented behavior? I've
experimented a bit (with 2.14) but I'm more confused than ever ..

Best wishes,

Yves,

Integer64 attribute support was added to GDAL with version 2.0 and QGIS
only uses it with GDAL >= 2.0. It seems you were using a (development)
version that pretends to be >=2.0 but does not yet include Integer64
attribute support.
Solution: downgrade or upgrade to a stable GDAL release.

Matthias

Hi all

This is not a server specific problem. It is that QGIS may need a long 
time to get metadata for some layers. So the best solution is (as it has 
been proposed already in this thread) to enhance QGIS to store the 
metadata (in the project file) and not read it from the db the first 
time. This will also speed up loading of large projects, it is not only 
usefull for the server. We should avoid to make any server specific 
things in core for that.

 >- there was a bug in QGIS Server which did not use cache whenever a 
GetMap request was called with an empty STYLE parameter

No, the opposite. It did not use cache with a non-empty style parameter.

If the lib, provider and plugin are really compiled
(lib/libqgisgrass7.so, lib/qgis/plugins/libgrassprovider7.so,
libgrassrasterprovider7.so, libgrassplugin7.so) try to add path to
GRASS libs dir (containing libgrass_gis.so etc.) to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
If it is already there or it does not help, find why it fails in "Log
Messages Panel > Plugins". It should print something like:

"Failed to load libgrassprovider7.so (Reason: Cannot load library
libgrassprovider7.so: (libgrass_vector.so: cannot open shared object
file: No such file or directory))"

I agree. We also need some behaviour to let the user decide how these
metadata are refreshed when needed : manually, or if it is older than X
seconds/minutes/hours/days.

I agree with you, this "server specific thing" was not necessary, as
improvements in this area will be great for both desktop and server.

You are right, I wrote my email too fast.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 2.14 'Essen'
Message-ID: <20160229192747.GA6836@norbit.de>

QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System that runs on
Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.

We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 2.14 'Essen'.  Essen was
the host city to our developer meet ups in October 2012 and 2014.

Long Term Release

This is a special release since it is designated an 'LTR' (Long Term Release).
LTR releases will be supported with backported bug fixes for one year, and will
be in permanent feature freeze (i.e. no new features will be added, only bug
fixes and trivial updates). Note that we are in discussion to extend the term
of our LTR releases to two years, but for technical reasons we will not do this
until QGIS 3.2.

The purpose of LTR releases is to provide a stable and less frequently changing
platform for enterprises and organizations that do not want to deal with
updating user skills, training materials etc. more than once per year. The
success of the LTR is very much down to you, our beloved users - we need your
support to help funding bug fixes and making sure in your support contracts
with support providers specify that any bug fixes done on your behalf are
applied to the LTR branch as well as our normal development branch.

If an LTR is important to you, please consider also directly supporting the
QGIS project, or encourage your commercial provider to use LTR as a basis for
your enterprise solution so that everyone may benefit from a stable platform
that is being continuously improved and refined. Note that for users and
organizations that like to live on the frontier, our regular four monthly
releases will continue unabated.

New Features in QGIS 2.14 'Essen'

If you are upgrading from QGIS 2.8 (our previous LTR version) you will find a
great many new features in this release.
(http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog214/)

We encourage you to peruse the changelogs for the intermediate non LTR 2.10 and
2.12 releases as this QGIS 2.14 includes all features published in those
releases too.
(http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog212/)
(http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog210/)

Note that 2.14 first enters the regular package repositories and will not
immediately replace 2.8 in the LTR package repositories. That will happen when
2.16 is released.

Whenever new features are added to software they introduce the possibility of
new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a
ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker.
(http://hub.qgis.org)

The source code and binaries for Windows, Debian and Ubuntu are already
available via the large download link on our home page: http://qgis.org.  More
packages will follow as soon as the package maintainers finish their work.
Please revisit the page if your platform is not available yet.


Thanks

We would like to thank the developers, documenters, testers and all the many
folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so).
From the QGIS community we hope you enjoy this release! If you wish to donate
time, money or otherwise get involved in making QGIS more awesome, please
wander along to qgis.org and lend a hand!

QGIS is supported by donors and sponsors. A current list of donors who have
made financial contributions large and small to the project can be seen on our

-----Oprindelig meddelelse-----
Fra: Qgis-developer [mailto:qgis-developer-bounces at lists.osgeo.org] På vegne af Jürgen E. Fischer

Emne: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 2.14 'Essen'



QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.



We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 2.14 'Essen'.  Essen was the host city to our developer meet ups in October 2012 and 2014.



Long Term Release



This is a special release since it is designated an 'LTR' (Long Term Release).

LTR releases will be supported with backported bug fixes for one year, and will be in permanent feature freeze (i.e. no new features will be added, only bug fixes and trivial updates). Note that we are in discussion to extend the term of our LTR releases to two years, but for technical reasons we will not do this until QGIS 3.2.



The purpose of LTR releases is to provide a stable and less frequently changing platform for enterprises and organizations that do not want to deal with updating user skills, training materials etc. more than once per year. The success of the LTR is very much down to you, our beloved users - we need your support to help funding bug fixes and making sure in your support contracts with support providers specify that any bug fixes done on your behalf are applied to the LTR branch as well as our normal development branch.



If an LTR is important to you, please consider also directly supporting the QGIS project, or encourage your commercial provider to use LTR as a basis for your enterprise solution so that everyone may benefit from a stable platform that is being continuously improved and refined. Note that for users and organizations that like to live on the frontier, our regular four monthly releases will continue unabated.



New Features in QGIS 2.14 'Essen'



If you are upgrading from QGIS 2.8 (our previous LTR version) you will find a great many new features in this release.

(http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog214/)



We encourage you to peruse the changelogs for the intermediate non LTR 2.10 and

2.12 releases as this QGIS 2.14 includes all features published in those releases too.

(http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog212/)

(http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog210/)



Note that 2.14 first enters the regular package repositories and will not immediately replace 2.8 in the LTR package repositories. That will happen when

2.16 is released.



Whenever new features are added to software they introduce the possibility of new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker.

(http://hub.qgis.org)



The source code and binaries for Windows, Debian and Ubuntu are already available via the large download link on our home page: http://qgis.org.  More packages will follow as soon as the package maintainers finish their work.

Please revisit the page if your platform is not available yet.





Thanks



We would like to thank the developers, documenters, testers and all the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so).

>From the QGIS community we hope you enjoy this release! If you wish to donate time, money or otherwise get involved in making QGIS more awesome, please wander along to qgis.org and lend a hand!
