Thanks Jeff, I'll ask on the GEOS mailing list for their validity check. However, what about the QGIS specific validity check? Any hint on what is done differently?

Hi JF,

Regarding GEOS, please consider asking for more details through the project's vibrant forum (subscribe at
https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/geos-devel ), I know there was a big release made yesterday and some chatter (project home:
https://libgeos.org/ )  GEOS is one of those core libraries, who would greatly appreciate your direct feedback.

PS. hello from the east coast

Thanks,

-jeff

Message-ID: <CAMtDFLLW3VxHUreUokVYtbNdGDv2yTgVeZP=T8pLjjmkR+=5ZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

The current Python minimum version for QGIS 3.33 is currently Python 3.7
(2018)

Do you think it's possible to update it for QGIS 3.34 (the next LTR) or
would it be possible only later ?

Debian Bullseye is providing Python 3.9 (2020).

There are possibilities for QGIS to accept orienteering mapping files using

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Looking for a QGIS core developer available to
 work on CMYK support in QGIS
Message-ID: <CAB2Z92BPb+N46E7RWqiHoiUvxHkVQ20d58-QwdD_R9f5FUUB=g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS core C++ developer on this list,

The QGIS PSC and some interested funders are in talks with company KDAB to
introduce CMYK support in the qt library.

Adding support in qt is a very important prerequisite for CMYK support in
QGIS, however, there will have to be follow-up development work in QGIS.

So we (PSC) are looking for potential QGIS core developers familiar with
PDF output and the QGIS layout module, as well as enhancing the color
handling in QGIS in order to allow users to specify CMYK colors next to the
RGB colors and give the CMYK colors precedence in the PDF output if they
are specified and CMYK is chosen for the PDF output.

If you are able to work on this topic (or know a QGIS core developer
interested in working on it), please get in touch with us. I will then
forward the information from KDAB we have (how they plan to introduce CMYK
support in qt) - it would be good to find an appropriate QGIS dev soon, so
that there could be a collaboration with KDAB during their development - in
order to provide feedback and test things out.

Thank you for your replies,
Andreas

Message-ID: <CALarpe7JUj=vTqrjadx0EuDfdC4p4N8VOy2U11eOFFcDTO6gSw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

PR's for this week:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8421
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8422

In this week's report I don't have many PRs, as I was focused on the
Training Manual as a self-learning process.
Today I finished the Training manual and there were a lot of things that I
didn't have a chance to try and learn before (GRASS GIS for example), so it
was quite useful for me. I believe my knowledge is now more relevant for
QGIS documentation open issues.

Plan for the next week is to create PR's for things that I noticed in the
User Manual, also complete reading and doing examples from the User Manual,
so the next report probably will have more content and information.

Have a nice weekend,
Selma.

So after getting very frustrated with QGIS taking literally hours to simply
delete vertices, I made a bug report

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/53973




When doing anything with vertices, QGIS makes the following set of exactly
the same (except or the cursor id) SQL queries 1 or more times for each
vertex being worked on:

Jul 27 16:54:17 postgresql-3 postgres[97809]: [2219-1] ::>[2023-07-27
16:54:17.743 EDT][64c2d4bf.17e11][97809/] <maps%Alternate History>
LOG:  duration: 0.323 ms  statement: BEGIN READ ONLY;DECLARE qgis_571

FROM "bop"."timeline_level_0" WHERE "id"=143

Jul 27 16:54:17 postgresql-3 postgres[97809]: [2220-1] ::>[2023-07-27
16:54:17.744 EDT][64c2d4bf.17e11][97809/] <maps%Alternate History>
LOG:  duration: 0.059 ms  statement: FETCH FORWARD 2000 FROM qgis_571

Jul 27 16:54:17 postgresql-3 postgres[97809]: [2221-1] ::>[2023-07-27
16:54:17.744 EDT][64c2d4bf.17e11][97809/] <maps%Alternate History>
LOG:  duration: 0.049 ms  statement: CLOSE qgis_571;COMMIT

To remove 600 vertices selected with the vertex tool from a feature, that
set of calls was made more than 800 times.

With a second deletion of 514 vertices, there was a pause of ~34 seconds
before QGIS started making these repeated queries. It started off of pretty

Here is the PostgreSQL for doing the delete, plus the canvas redraw when
finished

queries.log <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/files/12188596/queries.log>

Since the vertices are being removed from the in-memory copy of the feature
and and nothing is being written, it would seem the query (for whatever
reason it is being used), only needs to be done once since the result from
the database will never change.

What is the point of these excessive, seemingly needless queries?

in a later comment, I talk about how QGIS took about 28 hours to delete
roughly 2,400 vertices from a roughly 23,200 vertex feature and how the
ever increasing delay between the repetitive calls was 90 seconds, making
these unnecessary database calls the likely culprit for making it take so
long.

Hi Paul,
the SAGA-GIS provider has been dropped from QGIS install since QGIS 
3.30: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/50834

Best regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Draco package in build dependencies
Message-ID: <CA+uFzhhwyJxjKAFZ3vNma4ikPK=QOn9ZEmxMQ7ku7JhTSzsWqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I found that a dependency for the draco package had been included recently.
Building in Ubuntu 22 gave me the following error.

CMake Error at
/usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:230
(message):
  Could NOT find Draco (missing: DRACO_LIBRARY DRACO_INCLUDE_DIR)
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:594
(_FPHSA_FAILURE_MESSAGE)
  cmake/FindDraco.cmake:73 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  CMakeLists.txt:449 (find_package)

Installing libdraco-dev seems to do the job. I think this should be added
to each distribution in INSTALL.md? Now the dependency is listed just for
the Fedora distributions.

Best regards,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Loading layer from specific table/view after
 running algorithm
Message-ID: <56a5433b-87b7-ec0f-e8ff-e0e73153905b@terglobo.nl>

Hi developers,

I have created a processing algorithm in python that creates a new gpkg 
database with a bunch of tables and views. One of the views can be 
loaded as a polygon layer, which works fine when loaded manually.

How can I tell QGIS to load that view as a polygon layer when the 
algorithm has finished? (I think it must be the same as telling the 
layername to load from the geopackage)

So far, I have tried both QgsProcessingParameterFileDestination and 
QgsProcessingParameterVectorDestination as output parameters without 
much luck.

Hope anyone can help. Kind regards,
Raymond

Found the answer to my own question in old posts here. (Thank you Matteo!)

I have added this code to the processAlgorithm() function:

```
         context.addLayerToLoadOnCompletion(
             f'{gpkg_fn}|layername=my_view',
             context.LayerDetails(
                     name='my_view',
                     project=context.project()
                 )
         )
```

Seems to work at least.

Raymond

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Split feature after dissolve
Message-ID: <e0e08da9-adb4-91de-3c28-44f9fc88bbcc@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

maybe a silly question, but after a dissolve of a line layer, when using 
the split feature function to split the layer, instead of splitting in 2 
parts, the tool is splitting in n parts (where n = 113). Apparently the 
parts are randomly located.

It doesn't matter if the layer is shapefile, geopackage, temporary 
layer, postgis, etc.

Any idea why this is happening?

Cheers and thanks for any suggestion!

Matteo

Hi Julien,

Thank you for confirming that you are interested in working on it. I wasn't
really sure if you joined the meeting back then because you have a client
that wants it and can help finance. But now it is clear that you are also
interested in doing the development work inside QGIS.

Meanwhile I heard back from other devs who have an interest (Nyall and devs
from OPENGIS). I will let the PSC come up with some good procedure to
decide who will get the contract - or if it would be split in parts.

Thanks,
Andreas

Yes I have a client interested in funding partially CMYK support in
QGIS, so I contacted Kdab few weeks ago to know what was possible, and
so they organized the meeting with all the interested parts.

You can work around the lack of the SAGA processing provider by 
installing a plugin.

To install it, you need to enable the 'Show experimental plugins too' 
option in the 'Plugin settings'. After activation you will also find a 
plugin 'Processing SAGA NextGen Provider' in the installation area.

Of course, you also need to install SAGA GIS itself. When you restart 
QGIS after installing SAGA GIS, go to the 'Processing Toolbox' under 
'Providers', 'SAGANG'. There you should enable 'Enable SAGA 
Import/Export optimizations' and add the path to your 'SAGA folder' (= 
executable file).

After these steps the SAGA GIS modules should be displayed in the main 
window of the 'Processing Toolbox -> SAGA Next Gen'.


The plugin 'Processing SAGA NextGen Provider' itself is only delivered 
with interface description files for SAGA GIS v7.2. You can overwrite 
these using the following procedure.

Modern SAGA GIS versions have a tool for generating SAGA interface 
description files via the 'QGIS Tool Interface Generator'. You can 
generate these description files using the following SAGA command:

saga_cmd dev_tools 7 -DIRECTORY='path to the new description files'.

In this directory you will also find a (generated) README with further 
instructions on how to install these files in the QGIS plugin directory 
... ;)

HTH,
Rainer

Hello all,

I just wanted to return to my problem and show my solution. Like I already said, I tried back and forth, to no avail. Like I already described, zoom to layer never worked, and I still believe my earlier observation is true, that loading multiple layers at once changes the map extent everytime a layer gets loaded/added.

What helped in the end was this single line of code, between the layer loading code and the final zoom to layer code ...

        # wait for application to process pending tasks
        QCoreApplication.processEvents()

Maybe this is helpful for others as well.

Have a nice day,
Frank

Mmm, that should work:

Settings / CRS and Transforms/ CRS for projects / Use a default CRS AND I would maybe also set the CRS for layer to epsg:2169

Another option is to create a 'Default Project' (empty, BUT crs set to epsg:2169) Settings / General / Set Current Project As Default and Checkbox 'Create new project from default project'

fiddling with those I'm pretty sure it should be possible to start QGIS in the right crs..

Hi Ismo,

Thank you for proposing this Pull request and yes, this is the
appropriate way to proceed.

Like I said in the PR, your work is overlapping another one I already proposed and which
considerably modify the way topo points are managed in vertextool.

I'll try to integrate your work in mine and test if everything works
smoothly.

Thanks for your contribution,

Regards,
Julien

Ouch! If it's causing issues then it's fine to revert, it won't harm anything.

I just double checked. Without commit 1dca9b9 I am able to build latest 
version (atm commit 1a44f7b) on FreeBSD.

If it would be okay with you, the commit would be best withdrawn. On the 
other hand, if there are no problems with your patch for other systems, 
I can also use an appropriate (revert) patch for the port in FreeBSD.

Message-ID: <CALG-VUQyQC6LKDpkubo4U1_j6cosUGSkP_VO5idqLwMbX0w2_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to create a client and server process with Qt websocket,
sending text message do work well. Unfortunately, when I tried sending
binary data with sendBinaryMessage(binary_data) on the receiving end, I
don't receive the original data per say. Reading through and testing, since
the data is transfer as QArrays(), I wonder if someone have an example for
binary transfer encoding or tips to advise?
Thanks

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Build QGIS with PDAL on Debian bookworm: missing
 libpdalcpp.so
Message-ID: <460910F9-6580-4260-80D1-79DDF9D40CFF@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to build QGIS with PDAL on Debian bookworm and I'm failing.
As far as I can tell, Bookworm dropped support of libpdal-dev [0] so I tried to build PDAL locally following instructions in their documentation [1].
Everything seems to work nicely. I have the bin/pdal and tests are OK with it, but still no lib/libpdalcpp* on my machine.

Trying to build QGIS logically ends with:
ninja: error: '/lib/libpdalcpp.so', needed by 'output/lib/libqgis_core.so.3.33.0', missing and no known rule to make it

Anyone knows how I can fix this?

Thanks in advance,
Harrissou

Hi Harrissou,

I have self compiled PDAL and QGIS running on debian bookworm.
It worked without any problems.
First I compiled and installed PDAL
Everything (including libpdalcpp.so) gets installed under /usr/local/lib
and afterwards I used
-DWITH_PDAL=ON
to include PDAL.
 Everything worked smoothly.
What is your workflow?

regards
Werner

Can't you PDAL users on Debian team up and co-maintain the pdal package 
in Debian?

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi Bas,
As I am a very long time debian user I would have no problem with that, but
I guess there is still a difference between compiling a package and
maintaining a debian package :)
Honestly I have never built a debian package yet.
regards
Werner

I was a longtime Debian user too before I got involved in Debian itself.

> Honestly I have never built a debian package yet.

Fortunately you don't have to start from scratch, you can start with the 
packaging that already exists:

  https://salsa.debian.org/debian-gis-team/pdal

You'll need to change the Maintainer and the Vcs-* fields in 
debian/control. The Debian Science team seems like a good alternative to 
GIS team, so set the Maintainer field to:

  Debian Science Maintainers 
<debian-science-maintainers at lists.alioth.debian.org>

Set the Uploaders field to your email address, and the other co-maintainers.

Join the Debian Science team as documented:

  https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience

Follow their team policy:

  https://science-team.pages.debian.net/policy/

Update the package to the latest upstream release, the Debian GIS team 
policy can help with its documented workflow:

 
https://debian-gis-team.pages.debian.net/policy/packaging.html#git-packaging

Push the packaging repo to the science-team namespace on Salsa.

Find a sponsor for uploads of the package to the Debian archive in the 
Science team, on debian-mentors, or Sponsoring of Blends:

  https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience/Sponsoring
  https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/
  https://wiki.debian.org/DebianPureBlends/SoB

Learn from your peers in the team and wider Debian community to improve 
your knowledge of packaging and its best practices. Use this to host 
custom packages in your local network that are unsuitable for Debian but 
better built once installed on multiple hosts in your network.

Since PDAL builts shared libraries, learn about transitions and the need 
to coordinate them with the Release Team when the SONAME gets bumped and 
the library package(s) renamed:

  https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/ReleaseTeam/Transitions

When you get the hang of things consider becoming a Debian Maintainer so 
that you can upload the pdal package yourself (as long as it doesn't 
introduce new binary packages like when the SONAME gets bumped):

  https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer

Or apply to become a Debian Developer to upload any package yourself:

  https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi Werner,

I'm not on the machine I did the build earlier so I'll get back to you probably tonight.
As for the process, I just did what is in the docs, aka:
- clone the repo
- create a build folder
- cd build
- run cmake -G Ninja ..
- run ninja
And I got no errors reported.
Is this different from your process?

I was expecting to have the files in the build/lib folder within the pdal repository (what I understood from the docs). I also checked /usr/lib. I confess I didn't check that /usr/local/lib folder. Will do later today.

Thanks,
Harrissou

Hi,

SHAME ON ME and sorry for the noise. I indeed skipped the last command to build PDAL, thinking somehow that installing it was optional and for people that actually need to run pdal commands directly.
After a sudo ninja install and adjusting path to pdal library options, building QGIS with PDAL works just fine.

Thanks Werner and Richard for showing the missing step.

Kind regards,
Harrissou

Hi PSC,

I'd like to propose that core committer rights are granted to Andrea
Giudiceandrea (@agiudiceandrea, https://github.com/agiudiceandrea ).

Andrea has been active in QGIS c++ development for the last 5 years,
and has a fantastic track record of contributions. Their contributions
demonstrate all the qualities we need for core contributors --
attention to detail, careful consideration of the ramifications of
changes, and a very clear dedication to making QGIS a better
experience for end users. Time and time again, they've shown a
willingness to just jump in and fix things directly, and QGIS would
not be the application it is today without their contributions.

Thanks for your consideration!
Nyall

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] strange files in bin when building qgis server
Message-ID: <rmisf88dkiu.fsf@s1.lexort.com>

I maintain the gpksrc entry for qgis, currently at 3.28.7.  Generally it
works pretty well.

I am reviewing a patch to add qgis server to the package.  While there
are questions as to whether it should be a split package, I'm not
worrying about that yet, and it doesn't seem like the server files are
that big.

The patch basically does:

+CMAKE_ARGS+=           -DWITH_SERVER:BOOL=TRUE

which as you'd expect adds that to the cmake invocation.  The qgis
package already had a dependency on fcgi, for reasons that are unclear
(and unimportant!).

Things are mostly ok; now new files appear in $prefix/bin, in lib and in
share and reviewing the list most seem obviously sensible.

However, two files get installed in bin: admin.sld and wms_metadata.xml.

I have appended a snippet of our manifest of installed files;
bin/qgis_mapserver and bin/qgis_mapserver.fcgi seem correct, as do the
libraries, and the things beyond that which I have omitted.

But admin.sld and wms_metadata.xml are not executables and do not have a
qgis_ prefix.  They seems like examples, not something that should be
installed.

Do other people building qgis from source see these two files?  Others
maintaining packages?

This seems like a bug in the build system to me, but this is my first
interaction with anything qgis_server.

My build host is NetBSD 10 amd64.


Thanks, Greg

Hi Greg,

No inner knowledge, others know probably better, but a part of qgis_server is a 'landing page'-web-application.

Could it be those files belong to those?

Richard Duivenvoorde

I have read the docs at:

  INSTALL.md in the 3.28 sources
  https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/server_manual/index.html

and none of them say anything about qgis server installation, other than
'go find binary packages and add them'.   I am of course trying to
create a binary package by building from source :-)

Reading the sources, it seems there is a default to overlay cgibin into bin:

      set (DEFAULT_BIN_SUBDIR     bin)
      set (DEFAULT_CGIBIN_SUBDIR  bin)

which is puzzling, because normal webserver practice is to limit cgi to
a separate directory, so that only programs intended for cgi can be run.

Further, it seems that admin.sld and wms_metadata.xml are installed in
cgibin, which also seems wrong because they belong in a webroot, not the
directory with the cgi executables.  So really we another definition for
that, and I don't see any variables that fit.

It seems obvious (dangerous I know) that cgibin should default to
libexec/cgi-bin instead.  This is where php installs things, by default
if I read our package correctly as not forcing it.

It's not entirely clear to me if these two files are examples, that the
user will have to modify for their particular use, or if they are meant
to be used as is and never modified.  Packaging treats those two cases
separately; one going in share/examles/qgis/server and the other
requiring a share/qgis/server/webroot.

issue for docs not explanining the big picture:
