Message-ID: <CAJy=Xtcpg+9QbEg-qOV+9kAGtqXARDDGXWM9HAxrc4y41mD__g@mail.gmail.com>

I am migrating a plugin to QGIS3 and under Windows with the latest qgis-dev
release(build 1182816) I get an error connecting to well know
QgsVectorLayer signals:

vectorlayer.committedAttributesAdded.connect(self.attributes_added)
or
vectorlayer.committedFeaturesAdded.connect(self.attributes_added)

give:

TypeError: C++ type 'QList' is not supported as a signal argument type

I give a look to PyQT5 signal/slot model and I haven't found something
different from PyQT4 so don't understand if this is a bug or a new QGIS3
signal behaviour...

Is there somewhere a raw class/methods changes list from QGIS2 to QGIS3?

Best Regards and thanks to all for the wonderful work!

Hi Alexander,

Good news I guess. Thanks to Boundless.
I never tried the QGIS Lessons plugin but I heard about during Bonn FOSS4G
and it sounded promising. I couldn't find it in QGIS repo when I wanted to
test (I should have checked Boundless repo). Anyway, while I can't tell
about technical considerations I think it'll be a good move, one step
(more!) to link QGIS with its documentation and learning.
And maybe, at some point, it'll give some motivation to update and revive
the Training Manual, linking it directly to the application.
FWIW, it's a +1 from me.

my 2cts,
Harrissou

Hi,

+1 for explicitly defining connections and slots

While I like the ease of having Qt Creator's Designer auto-create the slot
in the class's header for me, I find auto-connected slots are often
problematic when doing complicated set up of a GUI widget, leading to extra
usage of obj::blockSignals(), as opposed to explicitly setting up a
connection at the right time in program flow.

I also think it blurs the separation of declaration and definition, putting
actionable code in a header file that is not just a simple assignment, etc.

Denis wrote:
> I also wonder about direct connections in UI files.
> I've come across one lately and hesitated a bit. Any thoughts?

I also prefer to not leave connections in UI files, unless they are vey
simple cross-widget communication that would usually never be manually
fussed with, like wiring standard default button actions to a dialog
closure, etc. Because, it is so very easy to set up those types of
connections in Designer/Creator.

That said, I'm OK with a policy of no connections in UI files.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin interacting with layer features, example?
Message-ID: <e51da1d6-0704-7523-8191-2aefd6cf0e49@homann.se>

Hello, I'm working on a forestry plugin in python. Right now the goal is to show the contents
of the layer in a user-friendly way. Example:
* Have drop-down menu that selects which layer that contains the dataset to show.
* Sorting features according to a specific field, and then scroll through them with press of buttons. Changes the selection also.
* If many features are selected, scroll through the features without changing selection

So scrolling through features, and showing values with help text in a docked widget.

To make this work I have to set up signals when the layer and features shown is removed, and signals for adding
layers and features.

It's starting to get a bit complicated, connecting and disconnecting signals. Looking for an example plugin that
I can steal the structure, a plugin that has already debugged the layer/feature changes.

Or is this not a good fit for for a docked plugin?

Hi, 

Sorry for joining the discussion late - was on holidays until yesterday
evening. 

I am a +1 for removing the "render" checkbox - but first fix the case
Denis has with labeling. If there are other issues besides that, I would
also consider them a bug. Imagine if you had to freeze/unfreeze display
in MS Office, Inkscape or Adobe Software - users would ask the devs to
fix the rendering behaviour ... 

We have the second round of QGIS grants proposals. Would be a good
project to submit to fix this issue. See
http://blog.qgis.org/2017/02/19/qgis-grants-2-call-for-grant-proposals-2017/
- proposals should be submitted until March 19. 

I would assume that mapCanvas().setRenderFlag( False ) would still be
possible for Python plugins to use, if the render checkbox would be
removed.

Hi Paolo, 

We (Kanton Zug) paid for the Action buttons in the attribute table, as
it was a requirement of one of our internal clients. It wasn't a
requirements to have action buttons in the forms. I can see value for
that as well. Probably easiest done in the drag and drop form mode. 

Alternative (already possible): Note that in forms view, that there is
an action menu in the top left where you can access the actions through
the menu. 

Matthias is most knowledgeable with the forms - so if you want to
improve that part, I would consult with him. 

Simply opening an issue, won't get it implemented - you know that ;-)
there is this useful and famous blog post from Nyall - which actually
should be published on our official website:

not be named for a couple of ministries and government agencies in
Indonesia. I then started working on InaSAFE in 2013 that made me familiar
with QGIS.

Last year I developed QGIS Resource Sharing plugin as GSoC 2016 with Anita
and Ale as the mentors. Since then, there has been some discussions about
the development of this plugin. As I recall:

   - Replacing entirely processing scripts sharing from Processing plugin
   given the requirement that the plugin is already in core and works smoothly.
   - Making a unified sharing platform joining the plugin with Plugin
   Manager *taking a deep breath*. This quite scares me as the plugin manager
   has been running smoothly for years that probably no one has complained
   about it.

If this plugin is useful and you would like to see it developed, I would be
happy to apply again for GSoC 2017 and perhaps we can start the discussion
here so that I can make a clear proposal (the proposal can still change
shape too in the duration of Community Bonding Period - the whole May). But
if not (say the plugin is sufficient enough for users needs), I am also
happy to just maintain it and getting it into core.

I am looking forward for your feedback.

Cheers

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=z+A7Uwnyu1gDN2DWgRa8vmzLhmOmGp2=-h-zKN35+y1g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using QgsMapRenderer to print a set of layers with a rotation.
This is an excerpt from my code:

(...)

i = QImage(QSize(600,600), QImage.Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied)
r = QgsMapRenderer()
rect = QgsRectangle(iface.mapCanvas().extent())
r.setExtent(rect)
r.setRotation(iface.mapCanvas().rotation())
r.setOutputSize(i.size(), i.logicalDpiX())
r.render(p)

(...)

I'm obtaining the rotation from the one set by the user to the map canvas
(which is rotated indeed) but the output image has no rotation applied.
How should rotation be defined for a renderer?

Message-ID: <b85d95a2-a756-3ec1-d6f4-6b6636de161e@gmail.com>

Hi all,
recently the Processing Result Viewer has changes into a Dock Tab.
I think this kind of change is great and makes Processing even more
flexible and accessible to users.

However, just playing with it I noticed that the results are not loaded
in the Viewer anymore where it is displayed the link to the file.

Is there a way to keep showing the results (raw tables, plots....)
directly in the Viewer? Could be quite tricky for new users to
understand why they have to open manually a file after algorithms were run.

Thanks!

Cheers

AFAIK it should still be valid info, even though I'm not sure someone is
still working on this.
All the best.

Looking into QgsMapRenderer it looks like rotation is never used during
rendering. It's not passed in any way to the layers during the rendering
phase.

I guess it's used (in other ways) only for canvas rendering...

How should a renderer rotate contents during image rendering? Should I
apply the rotation directly on the QPainter (painter.rotate())?

My 2c is that I think we should let the resource sharing plugin get a little more used and established before extending its reach into other parts of the code base. This will probably only really start happening when 3.0 gets out in the wild....

You did do such a great job on last year's GSOC - why not look at some other areas of the codebase. I am sure there are plenty of ideas flying around but some you might consider:

* Building on the work form Matthias Kuhn and Sandro Mani to improve and mainstream the QGIS Globe 3D plugin
* Adding support for mixed geometry layers to QGIS
* Get QGIS to work in one of the VR / AR platforms (Cardboard / Microsoft Hololens / Oculus Rift / HTC Vive) etc.
* Making QGIS work with Tangible Landscape (as a replacement for Grass) - see https://tangible-landscape.github.io <https://tangible-landscape.github.io/> - doubly cool if you take advantage of the nice new stuff Nyall has been showing off at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jsYRxmnWkI <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jsYRxmnWkI> so that we can do spatial animations over the landscape
* Getting the automatic digitizing tool to work against images (by doing edge detection or using some image processing smarts to predict where the user is wanting to digitizing)

Thats my 5 minute brain dump, and probably not as cool a list as others will come up with :-)

Regards

Tim

I'd change this to: "Investigate porting globe to the new Qt3D
framework and integrating with core QGIS as a 3D geometry viewer". I
think that's the path forward here!

QgsMapRenderer is very old and was removed in QGIS 3.0. Its
replacement is QgsMapRendererJob with use of QgsMapSettings for the
map parameters.

If you use QgsMapSettings with setRotation this should work without issue.

Thx Nyall, I was just trying QgsMapRendererSequentialJob and it works fine.
I was taking the code from an old plugin from mine...

Hi Ruoyun!

Sounds like a great project. Getting stuck into geo algorithms is a
fantastic way to push both your coding & geoprocessing skills.

Just a quick heads up that I'll be doing some major work on processing
and algorithms shortly (porting parts of this code to c++). I expect
this to start landing over the next couple of weeks, but in the
meantime I'd caution against writing large amounts of code against the
current API.

It's more or less a consequence of composer never being written for
plugins to hook into. So while it's possible, you'll hit lots of
anomalies like this.

Fixing this is on my lengthy TO-DO list.

No worries - and now you'll have one less thing to change when you

It would be great to have some coding efforts for 3D stuff in QGIS. It's a
deep and wide topic but it would bring QGIS to the next level ;)

Recently I've been working with Blender 3D (and OSM data), and I was
reflecting how would be great to have a 3D canvas with
front/left/rigth/etc. views to manage vertex coordinates... and one day,
maybe, meshes and volumes, etc.

I'd change this to: "Investigate porting globe to the new Qt3D
framework and integrating with core QGIS as a 3D geometry viewer". I
think that's the path forward here!

This is probably the most suitable item from the list that I can pick up
right away (I had image and speech recognition course last semester and
still 'hot' in my brain). Has there been any discussion about this?

See... I don't think it would be *that* difficult now that we've got
Qt3D available.

One really nice thing we'd gain is that (with very recent qt versions)
you can use qpainter to create materials for the 3d surfaces. This
should mean we could re-use existing symbology between 2d and 3d
views. And *hopefully* tileable styles like line pattern fills/marker
fills/etc would work fine.

My wishlist:
- multi 3d views inside the main canvas window
- embed a 3d view inside a composer

For what it's worth, it's apparently Adobe Illustrator's 30th
anniversary, and the Ai team put together a summary of toolbar changes
to the program over the years, in graphical form:

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C57NqY7VMAA2tWF.jpg:large
linked from
https://twitter.com/Adobe/status/837332712234987521

Personally, I remember several of these icon style changes as particularly
disruptive and annoying to my use of Illustrator.

But it also cuts both ways -- with 16 toolbar/icon sets over 30 years,
clearly you can have a successful product with changes every few years
or so. (Although, most of the changes didn't actually change
individual icons; rather, many add icons or reorganize the pallette.)

Hopefully that's useful to think about.

I'm not aware about any discussion on this topic. Probably you can start one, if
this item is interesting for you and you want to work on it during GSoC.

--> Just guessing blindly. I guess that the "'geometry" column name in ST_Buffer(geometry,

default for OGR sources that have no explicit geometry column (like shapefiles). But when 
the source is a database, "geometry" must be replaced by the actual geometry column name 
from the database. Typically the one you get with OGR_L_GetGeometryColumn().

Pseudo code :

src_geometry_column =  OGR_L_GetGeometryColumn(layer)
if src_geometry_column is null or empty :
     sqlite_geometry_column = 'geometry'
else
     sqlite_geometry_column = src_geometry_column

Note: in the above case, the processing is a bit suboptimal as the source is PostGIS. Removing 
-dialect sqlite would speed up things and allow the buffering to be done by PostGIS itself.

the geometry column name is not hardcoded, is left to the user to
choose what is the name. At the time I created this ogr based tools
there was no way to retrieve the geometry name column, but may I'm
wrong or maybe now is possible.

those tool were made to work with any datasource, and as I'm
frequently asked why I created them (as they have counterparts in
QGIS) is because I wanted provide something (especially the dissolve
tool) that worked reasonably fast for large dataset, something that
the qgis does not.

To run geoprocessing operations on postgis layers, done directly by
postgis, and with outputs directly in postgis I created a proof of
concept Processing plugin that is actually having quite a success
(over 25k downloads)

OK, wrong guess then ;-)

OGR_L_GetGeometryColumn() has always existed. That said, your point about having user 
choice is valid. Now OGR layers can expose several geometry columns depending on the 
datasource capabilities (can be the case for all database-based datasources), so 
OGR_L_GetGeometryColumn() would return only the first one. One could image a combobox 
with valid names (perhaps there's one already, just guessing again ;-) )

With GDAL >= 2 (now a requirement for master), you can get all the geometry columns with

OGR_FD_GetGeomFieldCount / feature_defn.GetGeomFieldCount()
OGR_FD_GetGeomFieldDefn / feature_defn.GetGeomFieldDefn()
OGR_GFld_GetNameRef / geom_field_defn.GetNameRef()

If there's a single geometry field and its name is NULL or empty, then 'geometry' must be 
used when SQLite dialect is used.

Understood, was just a casual remark.

Message-ID: <CAMtsY+aXr7qQvaeRK2tO0UowrARNMkKUAz279qTsON4ENKFE_g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I just merged a new version of Artistic Style (aka astyle) which brings
c++11 support and various fixes.

This will cause troubles to merge PR with work being done on top of files
prior to this merge.

I would like to propose an approach for easier merges:


1. Build last astyle:
- checkout master and pull
- build with astyle

2. Run astyle on your branch
  2a If your PR is relatively small:
    - rebase and squash into a single commit
    - reset to HEAD^
    - run prepare-commit.sh
    - re-commit

  2b Your has many commits you would like to keep
    - do an interactive rebase with editing of all commits
    - reset and run prepare-commit
    - commit and continue


I *think* this is the best approach and will lead to the easiest merge
possible.
I am not the best expert of git around, if someone has a better idea,
you're welcome :)


Cheers and sorry for the troubles,
Denis

Is it possible to get the map scale as a variabele in the map composer? 
I guess not, according to no replies on this:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/133045/integrating-numeric-scales-into-a-text-or-html-box-in-qgis-print-composer

Could it be added if it is not there yet? I'm afraid it is not too easy 
because there can be multiple maps in a composer.

Tnx!

Hi all,
while using the latest version of Lizmap plugin, I get an error on some
machines;
===
2017-03-01T16:50:09	1	Traceback (most recent call last):

So apparently sip bindings have a problem here.

All the best, and thanks.

Hi,

here on fedora it works


def test(layer, features):
    print(layer, features)

l.committedFeaturesAdded.connect(test)


So it seems to be a build issue, not a change in QGIS itself.

Although I believe you'll choose the automatic digitizing tool, as it's 
incomparable more interesting, I hope you'll find some time later this Spring 
to sit down together and make a small brainstorming how to join them in the 
future. The plugin manager is waiting for my holiday to get some refactoring

I have some MultiCurve geometries in PostGIS. When I split a curve in
QGIS, both of the new geometries are converted to linestrings. I
couldn't find anything from googling, so I'm not sure if this is a

Hi all,

Sorry to come back to this thread. But, although it seems that we will have
a 2.18 documentation release, we are still blocking the documentation of
new features arriving to the QGIS 3.0 Branch. And there are tons of it.

So, could we adopt some strategy about this? Maybe two master branches if
necessary (as done for QGIS code). Or branch 2.18 documentation, work
normally in master and backport all functionalities that were missing?

Any opinions or ideas?

Thanks!

There is only one master branch at the moment (master_2 was sent to the
happy hunting grounds a couple of months ago).

So if the decision is to work on two branches in parallel, better work
on release-2_18 and master.

If you have an eye on the qgis/release-2_18 branch and compare it to the
commits on documentation/master, I think backporting might indeed be
worth a try.

But remember, that I've got no idea about your workflows ;)

Are there core developers that I can poke around (and willing to be poked
:)) that already envision this topic?


 Hi Borys,

I am not entirely sure yet. I am a pragmatic and would rather do something
that we know for sure will work.

Not sure about spring (I told my supervisor that I want to graduate one
semester faster. Gotta work hard this spring :)), but we can hack together
for sure in summer with some beach scenery in Gdańsk? :)

Hi all,
I'm trying to use the Warp algorithm with several different file (tif,
hdf, ecc..) but I get always an error and I'm not able to reproject any
layer in any SR.

This is the error:

Message-ID: <2d5b561f-c074-dd6c-5604-88316fc1de05@gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm running Assign and Extract Projection on some default layers but
actually it seems that the 2 algorithms are not working (nothing happens
even with the "create also .prj file" activated) but no errors appear.

Only in the Processing Log, wit the Assign Projection I get:

2017-03-03T13:31:02	0	gdal_edit.py -a_srs EPSG:3003
/home/matteo/lavori/gis/corso/Dati_corso_QGIS/dtm
2017-03-03T13:31:02	0	GDAL execution console output
			ERROR 6: The AIG driver does not support update access to existing
datasets.


so it seems that the algorithm cannot overwrite the original file.

BTW, with 2.18 the prj file is created.

Should I open a ticket?

Thanks

Sure, you're invited! We'll grab a sun umbrella, folding chairs and a small 
electric generator and we can even organize a mini hackfest... I mean a

The splitting algorithm currently uses the GEOS library, which has no
support for curved geometries.

It's not so much a known issue as a missing feature. Possibly with
increased availability and demand for curved geometry types someone
may step and sponsor a solution to this.

Following the conversation from
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/89d4998 , this is an announcement
to notify that the PyQgsServerTest :: test_wms_getprint_srs  has been
disabled.

Work has been underway to remove "noisy" tests from Travis which cause
false alarms and these tests regularly fail for unrelated changes.
False alarms are bad as they undermine confidence in the CI results
and encourage contributors to ignore the test results.

If you're interested in seeing this test continue as part of the CI
infrastructure here's an example of the test failing on an unrelated
commit:

Hi Paul,

can you please have a look?

I'm afraid this failure is not a problem in the test itself but a symptom
of more serious issue: the map is completely missing from the generated
print.

The test was introduced by this commit.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f3a5c98178103afc5da3d7d5d3bc2df6930cb9bc#diff-260b51384025856fac2dc9682481a865R569

Check it with:

Thanks!

FYI, the same test also fails on 2.14 as discussed on the following commit:

Hmm are you sure we don't do this already?

I suspect we do. Each provider can handle the sorting, giving to it by
QgsFeatureRequest, and hand the results back to the caller.  I thought the
attribute table was already implemented this way.

Nathan

Hi,

IIRC the last time I looked into it (way more than 1 year ago) the
sorting/filtering on PostGIS was not yet implemented on the back-end,
that's why the provider (invoked from the attribute table) was fetching all
the records.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that the sorting/filtering is
now implemented in the backend (at least for PostGIS, not sure about the
status of every provider) but the attribute table will still fetch all
records unless you limit the view to the map/project extent.

Hi Mathias,

I am aware that there's no longer two master branches for QGIS. If I
recall, this approach was used while there was some indefinition about the
next releases. And master_2 was put to sleep as soon as possible, because
it was a burden to maintain.

For that reason I would prefer branching 2.18 documentation with backport
fixes. But I think there might be some implications with the transitions.

Anyway, I would just like to have a way to contribute to QGIS 3.0
documentation.

Paolo,

Could you open a ticket and add a milestone to it (2.16 probably)?

Thanks,

Hi devs:

How can I get a link added to the wiki? I'd like to add a link to the MetaSearch
wiki docs [1] on the homepage [2].

I am logged in with my OSGeo ID but doesn't look like I have edit privs on
that page.

Cheers

Hello,

First, sorry to be so quiet from so much time. Too much trip and tasks in my 
flat. Let' me write a resume of the discussion. 

There is two strategies in this thread:

* Release Documentation for each QGIS release
* Release Documentation for each LTR QGIS release

About the first strategy: we can't manage this one as it needs a big 
documentation team that can work on new features when they come to QGIS doc 
repository and we need to finalize the previous missing releases. This is 
probably a long term target.

About the second strategy: this is the easiest way to manage the 
documentation. But even here it's hard to document the previous feature except 
if we can find time and work hard to finalize it.

Currently, we have the 2.14 LTR QGIS release and documentation. and we are 
working mainly on 2.16/2.18 features.

Some developpers contribute to QGIS 3.0 documentation which means that we need 
to either:
* switch to 3.0  for the documentation
* create a 2.x branch and ask someone to backport from master to this branch

The second possibility let's us release a 2.x documentation for the next QGIS 
LTR (2.18) but we need someone to take care backport.

My proposition is to create this 2.x branch, work on master, add a label in 
our PR/commit to let's the bakccport manager which one he should work on. We 
can release a 2.18 release as soon as we finish to work on and focus on 3.x 
release.

I would like to nominate Harrissou for this task ;) as he already manage such 
backport on 2.14 release, of course if he accept it! 

If this sounds good to everyone we can go ahead. Sorry if you already find a 
consensus, but reading the thread today, I can't find a clear one but I get 
some of your point of view and add it to my proposition. Harrissou, let's me 
know if my proposition give too much work!

Thanks,

Y.

Hi Yves,

Thanks for your input.

Would we really need a backport manager? I mean, each one of us can handle
the PR on master and the backporting PR to the 2.8 branch (with the review
of others ofc).

If we follow this strategy, are there any implications with the translation
work?

Hi Tom

Which wiki are you referring to? I assume by the fact that you are using an
osgeo-id that you mean the one at  http://hub.qgis.org/. This wiki is being
end-of-lifed and IMHO you should not add any new content there.

The wiki at https://github.com/qgis/qgis/wiki is being used but only for
specific uses.

One option would be a small patch to the docs page on QGIS.org itself - but
check first with Yves or Richard if that would work well for them....

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blob/master/themes/qgis-theme/docs_index.html


Regards

Tim

Hi all,

Are there any specific plans how to handle translations?

I don't think transifex can handle multiple branches (please proof me
wrong!). So I guess a decision needs to be made from which branch
updates should be pushed to transifex. Possibly the translated files can
then be pulled into the other branch as well, but that sounds like
advanced magic and a good portion of luck ;)

Hi Mathias,

We only need to translate finished documentation. So I guess the next
candidate for translation would be 2.18 Documentation once it was released.

Richard is the guy that have it all wired up, I would like to hear from him
if there are any nasty implications of having two branches receiving
changes.

Filtering yes, sorting no.

Every provider has *some* functionality for filtering on the provider
side, but with different levels of compatibility. Most providers
(exception of oracle and mssql) we've pushed this about as far as we
can, and the remaining expression functions just can't be mapped
across.

A change I just pushed to master also prevents this full table load if
you use the "show selected features" mode. So that helps a bit.

Hi all,

I'm not sure https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blob/master/themes/
qgis-theme/docs_index.html (actually docs.qgis.org) is a good place to show
Metasearch plugin information; AFAICT, this page lists all the docs
released by QGIS Teams and aimed to be of *wide interest*.
Furthermore, the User manual provides a chapter on Metasearch:
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins_metasearch.html
so if particular information are worth mentionning/linking, i think this
page suits better.
Also, given that the wiki at hub.qgis.org is being closed, maybe instead of
linking to that page, improving the chapter in user manual with valuable
contents from the wiki should be the way to go...

my 50 cts,
Harrissou

Message-ID: <49901e4e-29af-d605-0cae-443739a9bf72@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
when analyses are done on degrees CRS, often parameters are difficult to
use (e.g. buffer width in degrees is not easy to calculate). The usual
strategy is to convert layers first to a metric CRS.
Would it make sense to always input params as meters, and reproject the
parameters as appropriate? This would be far easier for the user.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I've been thinking of this as well and I would love it! I hate ending up 
with a huge circle on my screen after performing a quick "look how easy 
qgis processing is!" 500 degrees buffer on my data. :)

The problem is that you cannot convert degrees to meters so easily since 
they depend on the location on earth. I'm sure you know.

So even for smaller areas, for example my house in the Netherlands, 
there would already be a 1 : 1.5  difference between lat:lon. Pretty 
hard to tell the buffer function.

On smaller scales, for example a country map of Chile, there would also 
be big differences in the distances on the north and south sides of the 
country.

So I would say, don't do it! I'm afraid this is the reason for being 
stuck with all these map projections in geography.

Still, qgis could improve on this I think:

1. Automatically reproject the data to the appropriate CRS (?), perform 
the analysis, and reproject back. UTM could be used for it, hoping all 
data is in a single zone.

2. Showing the CRS units in the analysis dialog, maybe even in 
red/italic/bold when these are degrees.

I'd vote for option 2 here, since I like to know what happened to my 
data. Buffers performed in different (overlapping) CRS's won't be exact 
the same.

Regards,
Raymond

Btw, here is a nice example story about this:

Hi,

As we all know and, to paraphrase Nyall, opening a ticket is not enough to
fix an issue.
Regarding the advanced digitizing panel, I'd have expanded this description
when I updated the Editing chapter few months ago if I had ended up finding
a smooth workflow of this tool. Most of the time, documenting precisely a
tool or an option is more than copy-paste and, requires the writer to spend
time on testing/understanding the feature. Personally, when I fail to
understand the process, I often prefer to tackle another ticket to writing
wrong description.

So, if someone who knows better this feature aims to improve its
documentation, as always, his help is welcome. Another related issue at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/1016

Regards,
Harrissou

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing params always n meters?
Message-ID: <CAEEbjBjFZTJu6w6+42HDs7S909kkK8npvuDyrdGj4GTgsbmBxw@mail.gmail.com>

Yes, this is a problem I noticed when experimenting with styles for the
version of the georeferencer I am working on.

The goal was to to show a circle of 1 meter around a point
- thus 2 Map-Units

Changing the MapCanvas to a non-metric Unit showed that these was no
dynamic 'switching' being done based on the srid being used.

 I worked out a Spatialite specific solution for this
- retrieving the srid being used by the MapCanvas and extracting the needed
information:

SELECT SridIsGeographic(%1), SridGetUnit(%1)
- found return if degrees and what type (meters,degrees, foot, yard,
chain,link and fathom [international, us, indian])

In the case of degrees, extra work must be done (as mentioned in the
previous post)
- using the center of the MapCanvas extent, calculate the length of a line
for a given meter value [using 1]:

SELECT  ST_Length
(
 MakeLine
 (
  MakePoint(13.3934162138589,52.51751576264239,4326),
  ST_Project
  (
   MakePoint(13.3934162138589,52.51751576264239,4326),1,PI()/2
  )
 )
):

Returns 0.000015 for the above point (in Berlin)
or 0.000009 for Greenwich/Equator.

This value would (for degrees) have to be recalculated each time the
extent/center of MapCanvas has changed.

The when a gui using a MapUnit be being rendered
- it would retrieved this value, multiply by the meter value set and use
the result when rendering.

----
For QGIS 3.0, I believe, implementing such a solution would be a good idea.

Inside a MapCavas, when the srid is set (or changed)
- which srid as number (different deggres type bring different results)
- what type of Unit is it
-- here srs.db could contain the basic values of 1 meter for
--> foot, yard, chain,link and fathom [international, us, indian]
- when degrees, recalculating the value upon extent change

When rendering using MapUnit
- retrieve the 1 meter value
- multiply by the meter value set in the MapUnit property and use that
result

This would be an API break that should be done now.

Yeah, exactly my case :)

Wouldn't it make sense to treat the distance as a segment, and reproject
that? As for the XY difference you mention, we could take the best
approximation by assuming that the distance segment is diagonal, and
warn the user about lack of precision.

This can be quite costly.

Thanks for the feedback.

Of course. Not opening it however is a good way of forgetting about it.
So IMHO better having an open ticket without a fix than an undocumented
issue.

I'll do something about this. Who is the maintainer of this piece of
code I can ask for clarification in case of doubt?

Thanks.

To add to the last note:

If API break is not desired, a 'MetersUnit' could be used
- that would implement the the 'transformation' to MapUnits

That might even be better to avoid any breaks and be clear for everyone.

Hi all,
cleaning up the whole build dir solves the issue. Sorry for the noise.
BTW0: why make clean is not enough?
BTW1: clang throws lots of errors of the type

[  3%] Building CXX object
src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/symbology-ng/qgs25drenderer.cpp.o

#include <stddef.h>
         ^

Anything to worry about?
All the best.

IMHO would be fantastic... a huge amount of literature is available on that.

IMHO would be fine a direct integration in Processing and heavy use of
QgsTask for parallel feature extraction... or explore external
modules/programs to be integrated in processing.
Would make sense to add features to Semi Automatic Calssification plugin by
Luca Congedo?

Hi all: here's a dump of the relevant pages [1]; as you can see developer
oriented content / brainstorming / ideas.  I don't think this is valuable
user documentation.

Any reason not to expand our use of QGIS' GitHub Wiki?

Cheer

Hello,

For me it is not worth it to add it in documentation but this is rather 
development's informations for developper.

The wiki is a good place imho but I have no idea if github wiki should not be 
used and if you can improve it.

Hello,

As soon as we release the 2.18 we can start translation until the QGIS 3.0 
release. So that's let some time for translator to work on this.

Mathias is right: we can't handle two release atthe same time.

About backport manager, yes it is not worth to have one if every documenter do 
its backport.

+10 I don't understand this: " opening a ticket is not enough to fix an issue". 
It looks obvious to me but we need to not forget it. As I will work on 
documentation in the dev meeting, Paolo, you can assign it to me as I know how 
it works.

Message-ID: <12475cc6-a2a6-37a0-41ef-72b74266e585@gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm trying to convert a plugin for QGIS 3, The plugin for QGIS 2 uses
some custom widgets of Qt Designer (e.g. mMapLayerComboBox).

But when I load an UI in QGIS with any of these widgets I get:

 File
"/home/matteo/.qgis3/python/plugins/DataPlotly/plots/bar_dialog.py",
line 59, in __init__
    self.LayerCombo.setFilters(QgsMapLayerProxyModel.VectorLayer)
AttributeError: 'BarPlotDialog' object has no attribute 'LayerCombo'

where LayerCombo is a mMapLayerComboBox

Are there any suggestions to use/don't use widgets for plugins for the 3
or am I missing something?

Thanks to all

Matteo

Yep, I agree. As soon as we have 2.18 LTR (or near LTR, I personally do
not care). We push 2.18 sources to transifex (in the same workspace as
we now do 2.16) and as long as we did not change the resource-uri's too
much, we keep most of translations.

Note that in transifex every sentence/paragraph actually has a 'key'
which is:
1) the resource key (name of the rst file)
2) the english source text

> Mathias is right: we can't handle two release atthe same time.

Theoretically we could create a second QGIS-Desktop project in
transifex, pull all translation from current project and push them to
the new branch. BUT that would mean parallel translation..
I think we do not have wo/man/power to translate two releases in parallel.

Transifex does just not have (for what we know) the tools to reuse
translations.

> About backport manager, yes it is not worth to have one if every documenter do 
> its backport.

So do I understand correct that people want to write docs for 3.0 in a
'fake'-3.0 branch, and the plan is then when master becomes really 3.0
all these changes will be cherry picked from that branch?
Because I think that will be hard to do.... given those branches will
divert from each other, and it is already pretty hard to have a good
overview as of where to place pieces of info.

But given that every new feature (which is commited with a 'FEATURE'
tag) has it's issue in the documentation issue tracker [0], why not add
information there? You can write full RST there, you can attache
images/screendumps etc etc.

If people (be it dev's or doc writers who are eager to dive into a new
feature) write there stuff there, it can be copied from there into the
rst of the docs as soon as we open up for 3.0 features.

Regards,

Richard

Hi,

Technically the description of how to add GRASS modules to the GRASS plugin seems correct.

However, the whole thing would benefit from some updating as with the plugin upgrade a lot of new stuff was added and e.g. the 3 options max concept did not really work for e.g. the temporal modules.

With GRASS 7.2 more modules might be useful to add. Other modules might need updates (I did not check yet)… So, this info is IMHO relevant to keep, esp. cause this is a nice opportunity for non-developer to contribute…

It is naturally not “used” like e.g. Composer documentation, but one of the important things with documentation is that information is there when you need it…
I guess you would not trash your grandmothers recipe for apple-pie, just because you did not bake one the last two years…

Cheers
Stefan

-1 . This is too risky... I don't think we'll ever get a reliable way
to detect an appropriate CRS, and I would much prefer to leave this in
the hands of users to weigh up the various options and make an
informed choice of CRS.

+1. This would be a great usability improvement!

Are you referring to symbology here? Ie adding a new "map length
(metres)" (yuck... not sure what a good name for this is! Metres would
be confused with the current mm setting which refers to rendered size,
not map size) option alongside mm/points/inches/pixels/mapunits?

I can see how that would be a handy option to have available.

Not sure if I followed your idea when you mention a "fake" 3.0 branch.

My idea would be to have a 2.18 branch and a master branch (effectively
aiming at 2.99 development).

When a documenter work in a new feature description, he would do it
directly on master and, if that feature was already available on qgis 2.18,
backport that description to the 2.18 branch. If it's a feature that will
only available on 3.0, there is no backporting to do.

This (or having a waiting PR) is precisely what I would like to avoid,
because if we wait for 2.18 documentation to be finished before starting
document 3.0, those hanging contributions can be difficult to integrate
later. Besides, it will be easy for other documenters to miss those
contributions and do some overlapping.

IMHO, the master branch version of documentation should (almost) always
match the master branch version of QGIS.

Hi Matteo,

Are you using a compiled UI file or the UI directly?
Can you point to the source online?

Olivier Dalang did the initial development of the plugin and I just did the

I  should come to Essen, we can discuss the documentation there.

Agreed, better keep it, with the updates suggested. I'm not sure about
the best location, it's meant to be something for the power user, rather
than for newbies or developers.

thanks for the info, and many thanks to Yves for starting the page:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/1727
Olivier, may I ask you to quickly give us a hint about how to:
* how to draw parallel lines
* how to place points at a given distance from a chosen one.
Thanks a lot.

But... I do not understand. Currently we are writing 2.18 in master
isn't it? 2.16 is currently being translated. Next release of
documentation master will be 2.18 (as that is the next LTR according to
current QGIS release plans).
So both (undocumented) 2.16 and (new) 2.18 features can go in
documentation master now (by working away the 2.16 and 2.18 milestone
features)
3.0 has to wait or be documented in the issue tracker. BUT.. but if it
is back-ported to 2.18 as you say... then it isn't a 3.0 feature anymore
is it? So can go in master now.

What I mend with a '3.0 fake branch' is that if people really really do
want to write 3.0 documentation, we could do a 3.0 branch in which then
only new features available in 3.0 could come (while master hopefully
still grows and maybe splits pages with 2.18 features). When we have to
create the branch 2.18 then to start translating, and master will become
3.0 that 'fake 3.0 branch' should be merged back in 3.0, OR 'fake 3.0'
becomes master and we have to merge all changes from old master in that
one... both a considerable amount of work I think.

Agreed... and normally this is the case.. we should not hold back adding
features for newer versions in between LTR's. But we are in a strange
situation currently: 2 LTR's pretty soon next to each other and a lot of
work going into a future LTR while next LTR is already being developed
while not yet to be released.

Or do I just miss your point?

Who or what makes us so eager to document the 3.0 features? Going into
the issue tracker I see devs are using that (more or less) to write down
some lines or images. So do you think if they can do it somewhere else
in Github that it will be better?

And I agree, a feature should be documented as soon as possible when a
dev still has the details about an implementation... but both devs and
doc writers are free to write down as much as details in the
issue-tracker of those features:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22QGIS+3.0%22

Isn't working your way trough the QGIS 3.0 Features issues there easier
then trying to merge/back-port two git documentation branches?

And maybe I just miss info or your point. It is all about taking
responsibility for a decision, I personally do not dare to promise that
I would/could do the merging (and I have the feeling both Yves and
Harrisou have the same). But if you or somebody else has the feeling
he/she can handle it and promises to do so... we can do a 3.0 branch
(which I call 3.0 fake branch)

But then make it a 3.0 branch and do not mess up master with this info.
So IF merging appears to be too much hassle we at least have current
master then to continue?

Or else... I just do not understand :-~

Regards,

Richard

Hi Matteo,

I ran into this last week. The solution, or workaround, is here:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2016-August/044138.html

You need to manually change the output of QtDesigner.

Good luck!
Raymond

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [GSoC 2017] Call for mentors
Message-ID: <CALuHMPAVcr+pqTe62nyyoti=VxvjmJ5+i2pv9DJ5+NebzEanFg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

as you may know, OSGeo has been accepted as mentoring organization this year.
As QGIS is an OSGeo project we are also will take part in GSoC this year.

QGIS project already has three students (random order):
 - Eurico Nicacio with the idea "Integrating PySAL tools into Processing" [0]
 - Akbar Gumbira with the idea "Resource sharing plugin improvements" [1]
 - Ruoyun Jing with the idea "Improve vector geoprocessing tools" [2]

If you want to be a mentor this year, please add yourself to the mentors
list at [3]. Also note that according to the program rules each student should
have two mentors otherwise application won't be accepted.

Program timeline can be found at

Hi Raymond

in Qt (AFAIR) you can specify the include of the custom UI, so the
overwrite will be avoided.

Sorry for raising this again.

I've added plugin package to the QEP (will work with QGIS 2.14.x/2.18.x).
Two sample (and very basic) lessons already included in the package, so
you can test it and get the idea.

Will be glad to hear any comments about this QEP and plugin itself.

Thanks

Hmm cool idea. Is there benefit to including it as core vs outside plugin?

If it is included as core plugin, users will be able to run lessons
(for example,
shipped with QGIS or with 3rd party plugin) immediately without need to install
additional plugins.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Housekeeping in the (Qgs)Settings
Message-ID: <CAL5Q673pz+CgD2u0wghMmD+gOcgtWMd6HUBYhzhTdfwQVkqtqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

the current keys naming for the settings is not very consistent, what do
you guys think about cleaning it a bit?

I was thinking at:

1. adding an 'app' section to QgsSettings::Section enum, to store
namespaced settings for the application
2. remove the '/' at the beginning of the keys (it's completely unuseful)
3. enforce namespacing with the use of Sections on all keys used in the
'/src/*' folders

This is a quick grep|sort|uniq of the setting keys:

There should be no need to manual editing of the file.

In the described example, one issue could be the 3.0 API change:
QgsColorButtonV2 doesn't exist anymore  in 3.0. So one needs to use the
proper library of custom widgets (Qt5) to be compatible.

If you compile the UI, it is import to add QGIS to the python path so it
can find the custom widgets while compiling.

Hello all,

This will be my last arguments in this thread. After these arguments, if I
fail to make myself clear, or you guys simply disagree with my point of
view, let's just carry on with our lives. I don't want to waste people's
time (at least not documenting time :-P)

Right now, master is being used to write documentation both for 2.16 and
2.18 feaures. 2.14 is the version being translated in transifex. Right?

So far so good. It's true. This is our current situation.

This is where, IMHO, it starts to fail. Having to wait for 2.18 to be
released (we have no estimate for that documentation release), or writting
it down in the bug tracker with no sure that the work will be mergeble in
the future may refrain people to documenting 3.0 new features now (and
probably won't do it later).

This would only be the case if we would have a 2.18 branch and 3.0 branch
(which I was calling master).

My proposal would be to do this backporting continuasly, keeping the two
branches in sync as much as possible (except for 3.X features ofc). That
is, any 2.16 or 2.18 feature added to documentation, would be added also,
at the same time, to the 3.X documentation.

If you recall, I started this thread after a contribution to Processing
Documentation by Victor Olaya, who was under the impression that QGIS and
QGIS Documentation master branches were matching (as this was the agreement
we had). Harrissou warn him that the documentation would not fit the 2.18
release (thank you for that), because it was describing 3.0
functionalities. This lead me to think that we were facing the following
problems:

1 - master branches of QGIS and QGIS-Documentation won't match for too long
(because of the indefinition about having a 2.18LTR release), leading to
some confusion;
2 - There is no place for people to document features that are now landing
in QGIS master (3.0).

I know that it's not very common to have developers fully documenting their
own features, but can we agree that that would be the best practice? Why
should we (documentation team) have the burden of revisiting the developer
notes in the far future, if he is willing to write full documentation for
it right now?

Like I said before, I'm talking about the cases where the developer (or
someone in his team/company) wants to contribute with the full
documentation of the new features, already in sphinx syntax, and ready to
be merged.

The next best thing is of course adding as much details to the new feature
issue in the tracker, and hope that any of us find the time to digest that
information and transform it in documentation.

I think it would be managable if we do it continuously. Each documenter,
after merging one of his contribution, would do the backporting or
"forwardporting"to the other branch. But you are right, I can't force
others to do it if they don't want to. And if you guys don't share my
opinion that we have a problem, then it's a no go.

We could go with Yves ideas of having a backporting/forwardporting manager,
but that would consume that persons time to much.

Although I would prefer the other way around, I would be ok with this (and
I agree that it's probably safer), it would not solve the "master branches
not matching (1) problem, but would solve the part of having a place to put
the 3.0 Documentation.

If we are willing to try it, I can try to assume the "forward-porting" role
for PR's that the documenters don't have time to do it.

I recall that this is a temporary situation until we release 2.18
documentation. For that reason, can we identify and focus in blockers and
missing features, and leave any enhancements for 3.0?

Kind regards,

Alexandre Neto

Hello Alexandre,

If I interpret your message correctly, you propose to

1. Match the branch names on QGIS-Documentation with the branch names
   of the QGIS repository

2. Only create branches for "documentation target" (read LTR) releases

3. Define one of the branches as "current translation target"

For now we would therefore have

 release-2_14 (translation target)
 release-2_18
 master (will become release-3.0 or release-3.2)

Main work will be on master but backporting should be done whenever
possible.
Branches can be end-of-lifed as soon as LTR-period ends and branched off
of master in parallel to the main QGIS repo.

The advantage of this is, that new features can immediately be
documented in rst (and not only md as in the issue tracker) as soon as
someone wants.

If we run into major merge troubles in the worst case, text can still be
copy-pasted. That's actually the same amount than it is copying text
from issues.

Did I forget something?

I think this sounds like a very good approach, I actually can't see any
downsides.

Bests
Matthias

Hi all,

Hummm Alexandre.. By replying to Richard points, you made me rewrite the
message I was about to send :'(

So in short: I'm ok with the double branches and had already suggested it
in january (
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-psc/2017-January/005047.html) for
many reasons you already exposed.
If we do not begin to fix 3.0 issues (currently 180) in parallel to 2.x
last branch, we'll NEVER have 3.2 doc released in 2018. I'm pretty sure!
For the recall, since 2.14 release in july (august?), we have closed around
105 issues for 2.16 and 2.18 (remains 49 issues open i.e 1/3). I let you do
the calculation even though I know it's not linear.

Another advantage is that there are new writers knocking at the door and
the remaining issues for 2.x are imho not enough sexy and easy to begin
contributing. And these people are energy we should not let go.

Btw, Alexandre, thank you to remind me that I need to revert Victor's
commit (for compliance with 2.x) :)

A quick, sweeping, unhelpful but important opinion from me (non-dev,
non-doc-writer).

Please don't think that retrospective documentation, and lack of docs for
current release (not master, but current non-LTR release) is good, just
because that's how it is now. This is the *biggest* failing of the QGIS
project when stacked up against commercial alternatives. Can you imagine a
professional software package being released without full docs?

I know that we just don't have the resources to improve this to where it
should be, but perhaps this would be an argument to slow down the release
cycle.

To make it absolutely clear: that fact that current latest release of QGIS
doesn't have docs is a huge failure.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 3.0: Plans to support librttopo?
Message-ID: <CAEEbjBjn_NqWQRaJ=GEWuOcT=4Qm+4yYmA+P5YX5AKAHZ_cjxA@mail.gmail.com>

The spatialite function 'ST_Project' is based on the librttopo functionality
(formally LWGEOM)
- and is only available when compiled with '--enable-rttopo'

https://git.osgeo.org/gogs/rttopo/librttopo

So if a support for 'Meters as Map units' was desired, in the case of
degrees
- the use the librttopo functionality as a part of the 'QgsGeos' would be
the most effective way to deal with this

This would be a new dependency, but would also offer many other
functionalities (such as Topology).

has this been addressed somehow? Better note it down somewhere,

And I prefer the term of forwardporting from 2.18 to master than
backporting to avoid misunderstanding about the direction of the port.

Tom, I agree with you that not having a documentation uptodate is a big
fail of the project. But I think it would not be that big if users were
aware of any strategy about documentation.
I think that:
- if we can release a doc concurrently with the application release (and
that's a huge target!)
- AND if users are aware that only LTR releases will be documented
- AND that there's a testing doc for non-LTR release
we would cover some gaps.

I'm not sure that the release cycle is a big problem. QGIS has gained
maturity and many features with this system. However I recall few years ago
discussion about integrating documentation as a part of any new features
from sponsors. Was that rejected? Is it followed?

Anyway, would be nice if a grant proposal could come on this side of the
project... _Harrissou dreaming..._

Please do disagree!

Totally no preference from my side, commits can be ported whatever way
you prefer.

Sorry, I explained badly. Pull requests are perfectly fine and desirable
and should be the standard way to contribute for everyone (including
devs). What I wanted to say is that commits (and therefore pull
requests) are preferable over issues because they are written in rst and
not md, unlike issues.

Good documentation processes encourage documentation to land when
features land. If the process doesn't do that, QGIS will always be
falling behind.

Hi Paolo,

As you tested, this is not related to Lizmap plugin, because you told me
you tested the following python code inside your Python console and got the
same error

p = QgsProject.instance()
if p.isDirty():
    p.write()


Can anyone else test and report there is no pbm ? Paolo, could you give
more information on QGIS Version / Platform and status of project file (
new not saved, saved, etc.)

Cheers
Michaël

Thanks Michaël for following this up.
QGIS both 2.14 and 2.18, latest version
OS both Debian Testing and Windows 10 (on other PC with Win it did not
happen)
It seems to happen (only?) when there are unsaved changes to the project.
All the best.

Hi Denis,

this the code that loads the UI:

FORM_CLASS, _ = uic.loadUiType(os.path.join(
    os.path.dirname(__file__), '../ui/Bar.ui'))

class BarPlotDialog(QtWidgets.QDialog, FORM_CLASS):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        """Constructor."""
        super(BarPlotDialog, self).__init__(parent)


should be the standard one to load them right?

Thanks!

Matteo

the error depend on the content of ui file not how it is loaded,

you can check what is loaded compiling Bar.ui with:

> pyuic4 -o Bar.py Bar.ui

there you'll find what are the include used and than what whould be
the elements you need to configure in you custom widget in QtCreator

Well,

just use qgis.PyQt.uic, it will use automatically the proper version.
It would be a good test to see if your path is set up properly.

on my computer (fedora), I have
/usr/lib64/qt5/plugins/designer/libqgis_customwidgets.so

then just make sure it finds the proper core + gui libs (run
ldd /usr/lib64/qt5/plugins/designer/libqgis_customwidgets.so and see if no
error is raised)

The test also only failed one out of 30 times on travis, so I guess it's
a tricky one to get a lead.

I'd recommend to run it in a loop locally and see if you can reproduce
it this way.

If you really don't find a way to reproduce this locally but have some
suspicion, you can also introduce some additional tests or debug output
that might help to assess the problem and re-enable the test on travis.

This way at least we have more information on travis the next time it fails.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Change numbers in Processing algorithms
Message-ID: <31114e43-15c2-ef87-efb1-89155f5fb800@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I noticed a strange behavior in Processing algorithms (all of them seem
affected).

When one parameter is a number and the algorithm provides some default
values, if I change the number hitting TAB or even by clicking with the
mouse on another field, the number is reseted to the default value.

The only way to add the number seems to click on the ... and write the
number in the Expression Box

Someone else can confirm?

Thanks

Matteo

Message-ID: <CAB28Asg+aqenuKphLdW0zC1R9otPQGxq_J6QvUnPZcA+-Feg4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I read on phoronix this morning that c++17 is nearly ready. I think
it's time we made this the minimum build dependency for QGIS (3.0 and
2.18.5, and maybe 2.14 (but not sure about 2.14 since it's the LTS -
can someone file a QEP?)).

Advantages:
- has some neat stuff like parallel algorithms
- can use std::variant instead of qvariant and std::optional instead
of QgsOptional
- 17 is bigger than 11

Disadvantages:
- I think we lose the Windows builds. That's a shame, but we need to
move forward.
- OSX users will need to build their own version of clang/llvm from
git. That's ok - they are used to things that "just work" so I think
they'll quickly adapt to this process.
- Linux users will need to update to the next beta version of their
distro. This is just a short-term inconvenience and I'm pretty sure
no-one will lose productivity because of it.

I'm certain this is the way forward, so I'll push a change later today
requiring this.

Hi Nyall,
it's not the 1st of April right?
In all seriousness are you really going to push such a strong requirement?
What do you mean with "we lose the Windows builds"?!

Hi,
Nyall, +1 from me fwiw.
Actually, I've never understood why QGIS was made available on Windows. If
Windows users want to use QGIS, they just need to move away from that OS.
So easy.
Your plan is hence a good move imho.

Isn't it possible that g++ will also run on Windows with c++17 support 
or that MSVC will have the features too, or shortly will?  Why eliminate 
anyone?

Like Harrissou said - I'm pretty sure none of our users are on Windows
in any case.

As a Mircosoft shill, I'm a super -1 on this.  How will I make my money
from Microsoft for making QGIS on Windows better?

I dunno. But some guy blocked me on twitter a couple of weeks ago
because QGIS is available on Windows. That hurt my feelings.

I have customers who use Windows and QGIS. They will not be changing their OS as QGIS is not their major task. 
I have others who would be QGIS users if we could convince them to try it.  But they too have other tasks which are limited to Windows. 
Unfortunately not all users have the option to change.

I guessed that but it was too worrying!

The advantages didn't sound well balanced against disadvantages, but I'm
not a C++ pro dev so I wasn't sure if they were true, great, benefits :)

My heartbeat is slowing down again...

It builds fine with Qt 5.5, but I get tons of errors when building with Qt
Creator's Qt 5.8 bundle (same cmake configuration except Qt's).

Is it a problem of mine or isn't QGIS ready for Qt 5.8?

Hi Mark,

This shouldn't be implemented using an external dependency -- instead
you'll need to use the existing QGIS classes like
QgsCoordinateTransform. You'd just need to modify:

QgsRenderContext::convertToPainterUnits
QgsRenderContext::convertToMapUnits
QgsRenderContext::convertFromMapUnits

Everything you need should already be encapsulated in QgsRenderContext
(and the QgsMapToPixel member).

Hi Nyall,
Ubuntu 16.04 + Qt Creator 5.8.0 (deb package).
Qt 5.8 come from Qt Creator (under /opt path).
Qt 5.5 from apt. Generating and building against these is ok.

I'm not sure. I'm not aware of any platforms where QGIS is currently
built against 5.8 (since 5.8 on homebrew is broken, and all stable
distros are 5.7. Windows is 5.7 too), so there's possibly things we'll
need to change.

But last time I tried to build against any non-repo packages on Ubuntu
I just couldn't get it to succeed either.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Changing behaviour of "show selected features"
	mode for attribute table
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash2boJ=f8KAmdtmHBQp5RsjaV2w7BkW2+oadjNTjzAaLw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to raise discussion about changing the behaviour of the "show
selected features" mode in the attribute table.

Over the last couple of weeks I've pushed fixes to both 3.0 and
(shortly) 2.18 to improve the performance of the attribute table when
this mode is selected (Thanks to Faunalia and ENEL for sponsoring
this!). With these changes *only* the selected features are fetched
from providers to show in the attribute table, vs the current
behaviour of fetching *everything* and then filtering out to the
selection. It makes a huge difference for working with large layers.

Now - there's one last piece of this I'd like to land, but it changes
the behaviour of this mode. Currently if you have the table set to
"show selected features", but there's nothing selected, then ALL
features are shown.

This kills the benefit of setting the table to show in this mode. If
you accidentally open the table for a large layer with no selection,
it'll force every feature to be fetched again.

I'd like to change this, so that no selection = nothing shows in the
table. This means that users can safely set the attribute table to
always show in "selected features" mode and be confident that they'll
never hit the situation where every feature is fetched (unless of
course they have selected *every* feature!).

Does anyone object to this change landing for 3.0 and 2.18?

Been thinking about this issue.... Here's what I'm thinking now:

For a while I've pondered whether we should require that all
developers who push a feature also push documentation for that
feature. But after careful thought, I don't think this is a good move.
Here's some reasons why:

- good developers arent necessarily good writers, nor have good English skells
- there's a time investment in learning the documentation setup. This
may detract developers.

I think a better solution is to hook into the current
[FEATURE]/[NEEDS-DOCS] hooks which auto-open issues on the
documentation repo. We could *require* that all developers who push a
new feature commit have to post on the corresponding documentation
auto-opened issue with at least very rough notes about how the feature
is supposed to work. The documentation team could then polish these
up, add screenshots, etc (and merge when the timing is right for the
team). This would also keep things as easy as possible for devs so
that they (*cough*... i mean me *cough*) have no excuse not to do it!

For everything but degrees it is.
But in the case of degrees is is not
- there the (incorrect) assumption is being made that the world is flat
The value being used for DEGREE_TO_METER 111319.49079327358
- is only valid on the Equator
In my area a degree is around 66666,666666667 meters
- and this is the value needed

>> This shouldn't be implemented using an external dependency
I understand the reluctance to adding a further dependency, but GEOS is
also used
- and librttopo is an extension of GEOS

Unfortunately there are not many degree based functions that allows the
combination with a distance as meters.

---
Looking at the code yesterday, the following could be a realistic
possiblity to implement this:

QgsMapRenderer:
- add double mMeterAsMapUnit [default 1.0 for meters distance unit]
QgsMapRenderer::setDestinationCrs
// before setExtent is called:
 mMeterAsMapUnit=QgsUnitTypes::fromUnitToUnitFactor(QGis::Meters,crs.mapUnits());
mRenderContext.setMeterAsMapUnit( mMeterAsMapUnit ) ;

QgsMapRenderer::setExtent

  if ( mSettings.destinationCrs().isGeographic() )
  { // Retrieve realistic MapUnits for a meter based on result of
QgsMapCanvas::center()
   // meterAsMapUnit=
  }

QgsRenderContext
add:
    /** 1 meter in Map-Unit*/
    double mMeterAsMapUnit;
    void setMeterAsMapUnit( double meterAsMapUnit ) {mMeterAsMapUnit =
meterAsMapUnit;}
    double meterAsMapUnit() const {return mMeterAsMapUnit;}

QgsSymbolLayerV2Utils::convertToMapUnits:

  switch ( unit )
  {
    case QgsSymbolV2::MetersUnit:
    { // Note: must fall through to QgsSymbolV2::MapUnit
     size=size*c.meterAsMapUnit();
    }
    case QgsSymbolV2::MapUnit:

I will try this out and see if it brings a reasonable result.

I'm confused - what is missing? You have the extent, map scale, and
source and destination crs with their corresponding map units. What
more is needed?

>> I'm confused - what is missing?

The topic here is that when using MapUnits
- where the MapUnits are degrees
that a constant value (valid around the world) is not possible.

If you set this to 5 (intended as meters on the map)
- the further you zoom in, the circle will get bigger always showing an
area of 5 meters

If the Map is switched to WSG84
- then you will get 5 degrees and not the desired area of 5 meters
--> which for my area would be 0.000075, at the equator 0,000045 and in you
area something different

Since the source and destination crs are unknown when this attribute value
is being set
- one cannot assume that one or the other use meters and therefore cannot
be used

It might be unknown at the time of setting that value - but it's
certainly known at the time that
QgsRenderContext::convertToPainterUnits or similar is called!

So you add a new QgsUnitTypes::RenderUnit enum value for
MapUnitMeters, and then if that unit is encountered by
QgsRenderContext::convertToPainterUnits you could do the calculation
from metres -> real map units -> painter units then. (The conversion
value could be cached in the render context to avoid multiple
coordinate transforms)

Hello all,

I've proposed a refactoring of the modeler algorithm dialog :

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/84

This would come with code simplification, more modularity and port all 
the functionnalities from the algorithm dialog to the modeler algorithm 
dialog.

But as this also has a side effect on the UI, I'd like to have more 
opinion before going deeper on this.

Best regards.

Arnaud Morvan

Of course it's a +1 from me.
I wonder if it would be good to also:
* set "show selected features" on by default
* add a warning "no elemenent selected, please do a selection" or
similar, to avoid the user to think the table is empty.
All the best.

Paul,

Thanks for looking into this, I'll do some local testing shortly, do you
have clue if the multi-threading rendering could be the root cause of this
issue?

A s a side note, I would recommend to refactor the server test and split it
in smaller dedicated tests for the different services.

Hi Nyall, 

I am fine with your proposal. 

In fact, the current behaviour as you described it, can be regarded as a
bug. I agree with you.

Big +1 too. I always found the current behavior (show all of nothing is
selected) slightly counter-intuitive.

Hi Paolo, 

I am a -1 on having "show only selected features" on by default. I think
that huge/gigantic tables with performance issues are more an exception
than the rule. Of course in such cases the "show selected only" makes
sense and the project should probably retain this state. But in the
majority of other cases the tables are small enough that this is not an
issue and it would be annoying that one has to select features first for
seeing all the features. 

I also don't think we need any warnings. The top window bars clearly
shows the status of total / filtered / selected features. No need for
extra warnings.

I'm a bit confused here.

At the moment, there is a global option for attribute table widget "show
only selected".
If you choose this option and have a selection, you won't have any mean to
show all the layer unless you deselect and reopen the attribute table
(hence showing all). In other words, switching between show all and show
selected only has no effect and shows only selected features.

Does your work will fix this i.e. really show all features?

In such case, I'm fine with Paolo's proposal (and yours!)
Otherwise I'm -1: opening the table will show nothing (i.e. no selection)
and you won't be able to show the features.

Please enlighten me!

Cheers,
Denis

I'm in favour of this too, just because untill now, the behaviour worked
on small data, but as soon as you work with larger datasets it was bad...

BUT, it should be intuitive for users... people are used to see always a
filled table behaviour...

What about adding a msg+button after opening an empty table:
"Nothing selected so nothing shown" and a dropdown or button: "select
ALL" and "select ALL in current extent"

Setting 'show selected features' on by default...mmm as as it warns me
or is easily stoppable when I load the table for my 12,000,000
postgistable.
I would say: not on by default, but the state saved in the project
configuration, so as soon as user A has selected it for his project with
small tables... keep it like this for a project. For User R which works
with larger datasets, it just works :-)

Regards,

Richard

In current master and 2.18 branch if you set the attribute table to
show only selected, and then open the table and change the filter in
the bottom left to "show all", then ALL features will be loaded
(regardless of the current/original selection)

Thanks for the precision.

Then
+1 for showing nothing when no selection
+0 for "show only selected" as default mode.

Yeah I'm not really ok with a empty table as the default.  I understand the
point but users are going freak at that.

One option might be to ask users what they want when a table is first
opened for the first time.  E.g what default mode would you like with some
notes on each.  This is only asked once and never again but gives the user
the choice.

Alessandro,


> do you have clue if the multi-threading rendering could be the root
cause of this issue?

The test is failing on travis for 2.14 too. However, PR about the
replacement of the QgsMapRenderer and the parallel rendering activation
are not backported in 2.14. So, as it happens both on master and 2.14,
it seems to be independent from the rendering step.


Only unit tests on the getprint service has been backported and before
that, there was none. So I think that the failing test is just
underlying an old issue which was there even before we started to
refactor the server.


What do you think?


Paul

It seems we find a consensus here? Richard are you ok with this:* create release-2_18 branch* adapt features tracker if needed* made release-2_18 branch the default one* forward porting by contributor or by alexandre
I can't do this before the end of the week as I am on trip for QGIS training. Could someone create the branch?
Sorry if I am too fast to conclude. Feel free to give your opinion if necessary.
Thanks.

Sorry, I explained badly. Pull requests are perfectly fine and desirable

and should be the standard way to contribute for everyone (including

devs). What I wanted to say is that commits (and therefore pull

requests) are preferable over issues because they are written in rst and

not md, unlike issues.


I can't disagree this time!

I'm afraid you are right ...

It will be difficult to spot it out, by the way I think that the test did a
good work to discover this issue.

It sounds strange to me that it was never observed in production, but I did
not search the hub for an existing ticket, it might have been reported.

What about dropping that option and just use the mode last used in the
table display?

Yeah I'm not really ok with a empty table as the default.  I understand the
point but users are going freak at that.

One option might be to ask users what they want when a table is first
opened for the first time.  E.g what default mode would you like with some
notes on each.  This is only asked once and never again but gives the user
the choice.

Then
+1 for showing nothing when no selection
+0 for "show only selected" as default mode.

In current master and 2.18 branch if you set the attribute table to
show only selected, and then open the table and change the filter in
the bottom left to "show all", then ALL features will be loaded
(regardless of the current/original selection)

Hi I agree with Nathan, empty table by default will freak out users.
Could we imagine some heuristics that will let the whole table being seen
for reasonable sized tables, and only a subset for huge tables, advertised
by a warning bar ?

I think of displaying visible items in mapcanvas if their number is not too
high, and if still too high, remember to show only selected items?
We need an exception of course for non geometric tables on that.

I would not be shocked by such messages, huge tables should not be entirely
fetched, raising a security fence to the user sounds reasonable to me.

The test seems to fail in very specific conditions (that I have not yet
found). As Mathias suggested, I made a loop on the test. And even with
1000 iterations, it's still not failing whatever the branch (master or
2.14)... Maybe it has never been observed.

Hi all,
the visibility widgets are different for layer general properties and
label rendering properties. IMHO it would be appropriate to make them
uniform. Anything preventing this I can be missing?
All the best.

Hi Ale,

yep agreed! And now (while most users do not have real 3.0 
configs/settings) is the only time to do this...
as people will loose all connections etc etc

I would even be ok, to use python style names, so no capitals and use of 
underscores:

/BetterAttributeTable/geometry
becomes
better_attribute_table/geometry

etc etc

Let's clean up :-)

Regards,

Richard

Hi Richard,

thanks for the feed-back, the original plan was to have all setting keys
case-insensitive  (lowercase) but that was reverted yesterday, because some
setting keys have been used to store values (i.e. strings) as a part of the
key, like for example the name of a WMS/WFS or plugin site description.

I'm afraid we are forced to live with that.

BTW, the new QgsSettings class supports namespaced settings, we have "gui",
"core", "server", "plugins", "misc", so we should be able to organize the
setting keys in a more logical manner.

However, I do not think that they later need to add information in the
auto-opened issue in Doc repository. By default the generated issue is
populated with all the information in the commit. So a really descriptive
commit to QGIS repository with those tags should be enough. There are some
very good (from a doc writer pov of course) commits where you only need to
find the right place in the doc and copy paste the description with minor
adjustments. Unfortunately, they are currently far from being the majority.
On the other side, there still are many with simply the title (which
sometimes can be helpful) or do use a dev language (too much cryptic?).

Also note that a verbose commit benefits to the Changelog team, when time
comes....

Totally agree with Harrissou. A good description in the commit with the
rigth tags  should be enough.

Agreed, note that you can also use the visual changelog as reference when it already released and you are working on the documentation.

I think a better solution is to hook into the current

[FEATURE]/[NEEDS-DOCS] hooks which auto-open issues on the

documentation repo. We could *require* that all developers who push a

new feature commit have to post on the corresponding documentation

auto-opened issue with at least very rough notes about how the feature

is supposed to work. The documentation team could then polish these

up, add screenshots, etc (and merge when the timing is right for the

team). This would also keep things as easy as possible for devs so

that they (*cough*... i mean me *cough*) have no excuse not to do it!

I would say -1 for having an empty table as the default behavior if no
features are selected. It will rain complaints and bug reports saying that
the table is not showing any their lovely features.

Wow, you sure jerked my chain! :-)

I often cannot use new features of various programs due to productions 
servers being behind the curve. So you can see how I'd feel about losing 
QGIS!

Keep up the good work!

Agreed fully.

Hi guys, this is my first thread here in the DiscussionList.

Ever since 2.10.x version I've been noticing slowness when It comes to
MSSQL data provider. Things came to impossible usage in 2.18.4.

Using the same map in QGIS 2.8.9, 2.14.12 and 2.18.4 on a Dell Precision
T3610:

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_HCHNquYit1-f3XxgvTkpEmzA9S1gLpjav8NTbMw-_TwA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

As a result of a long discussion around how to contribute with
documentation for 3.x new features [0]
<https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2017-March/047346.html>,
we decided to create a master_3x branch [1]
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/tree/master_3x>.

>From now on, all new features landing on QGIS 2.99 should be documented in
the "master_3x" branch.

All new documentation and improvements as we go through the latest releases
issues (2.16 [2]
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22QGIS+2.16%22>
and 2.18 [3]) should still be worked on the master branch. When it makes
sense, the documentation team will do his best to "forward port" them to
master_3x branch.

After 2.18 release as LTR (June?) and consequent release of 2.18
documentation, "master_3x" will be merged into "master" and all should go
back to normal. That is, all contributions can be done in the "master"
branch.

To help us document the all the new features, we kindly ask all developers
to add the [FEATURE] and [NEED-DOCS] tags in their commits and provide some
simple guidance on how to use the new features in the commit message.

Thanks

Hi all,

Nice move!

I have a minor note on the setup.

"master_3x" will be merged into "master"* sounds like a plan, but I
guess in reality someone will spend days trying to figure out how to
solve those damned conflicts. I would strongly suggest against merging
production branches as this leads to a single "big bang" with
interleaved effects of documentation commits that have already been
forward ported and missing ones.

Instead I would propose to follow the branching schema of QGIS. On
github you can define the "default branch" in the repository settings to
release-2_18, so pull requests will be opened against this branch by
default at the moment.

Just my 2c, maybe it helps to avoid some sleepless nights if this
adjusted right now ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS documentation (and SIP files)
Message-ID: <CAL5Q671hF2zsyOdfmHUgK0G8n1mpTqxUGmr88D9QAyg6EYC3Dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I think we still lack a up-to-date comprehensive documentation targeted to
Python QGIS developers and I would like to discuss the options that we have
to improve the current situation.

As a Python QGIS developer, what I probably need is:
1. Python API docs, possibly with examples
2. Developer documentation about how to write PyQGIS plugins and standalone
applications
3. Tutorials and examples
4. Scaffolding


2 and 3. the cookbook is doing a very good job, but it could probably be
improved and kept in sync with the API changes
4. is perfectly covered by plugin builders
1. this is were IMO we should do better: for most experienced QGIS
developers it's perfectly fine to look at the C++ API docs, but I think
that for Python developers that is not ideal

There have been some efforts to build PyQGIS API documentation:
http://geoapis.sourcepole.com/qgispyapi/qgisinterface , maybe Sourcepole
colleagues could share their experience in building that pages.

My main concern here is that we are slowly moving away from documenting SIP
files, I don't know if we can still build PyQGIS documentation without
documenting the SIP files but we should think carefully before taking a
move that will block us from using SIP files as a source for building the
docs.


What do you think about this?

I'm not sure we need the headers in the sip files to make a python docs API
do we. That is the first thing to work out.

I don't know, all I know is that you can build API docs with doxygen using
sip files as a source: this is an ancient try that I did a few years ago
http://www.itopen.it/qgis/serverplugins/api/classQgsServerInterface.html

The result is far from ideal though, but maybe it could be refined.
There might be other ways to build the Python API docs, like using
introspection, but I'm not sure about how can we grab the documentation
from the C++ headers if we go that route.

Hi Mathias,
Having two babies in the house, I'm all for avoiding sleepless nights!

Not sure I followed your suggestion. AFAIK, The "master" branch (future
release-2_18) is already the default branch. And our plan was to keep a
close eye on that branch and continuously forward port everything from
master to master_3x, to avoid that single "big bang".

Maybe I'm not understanding your suggestion. If you don't mind, I will ping
you on gitter.

I tried to reproduce the issue locally without success.

I suggest for now to either split the printing tests into a separate file
or better (if there is single test failing) just decorate the test as
allowed to fail so that the whole suite does not fail.

When done, we can re-enable the server test in travis.

Just an amend. The correct tag to inform that documentation is needed is
[NEEDS-DOCS] (mind the S's).

Thanks Harrisou for spotting the error

There is no `AllowFailure` available IIRC. There is only an
`ExpectedFailure` which will fail if the test succeeds.

Adding an infrastructure for something like this would be much
appreciated (similar to how ExpectedFailure is handled).
But splitting into a different file will be easier.

Hi all,

Following Mathias Kuhn suggestions we change strategy a bit:

1) "release_2.18" branch is now the default working branch;
2) all commits landing on "release_2.18" branch will be "immediately"
cherry-picked to "master";
2) 3.x features will documented directly on "master" branch.

If everything goes according to plan, by the time we release 2.18
documentation, the "master" branch will be fully updated and ready to
became the default branch again.

Thank you all for your help and input.

Alexandre Neto

Hi Lists,

As of today there is still no mentor for any QGIS related project
entered on the according webpage [1].

Please read the forwarded mail.

Dear All,

at today, we have only 9 registered mentors, which I believe is not
the final number. If you are willing to mentor a student for Google
Summer of Code, here's what to do: add yourself here [1], clearly
indicating the *title* of the idea you are willing to mentor (no link
to ideas page, please). I will then send you an invite to join the
OSGeo organization on the GSoC website.
The Google Summer of Code program is a great way to attract new
developers and expand our software communities. Moreover, I would
really much like to see more of our former GSoC students engaging in
mentoring this year's fellows students.
Please, forward this email to your software communities!

Kind regards,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Port Password Helper plugin into core
Message-ID: <CAL5Q673WHnx3=FKfe=KEwQ727gZDeDoT5CVTtsDjaVPATQFJWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Boundless has developed a C++ plugin [1] to allow storage and
synchronization of the QGIS master password with the OS password manager.
The plugin has been tested on Windows, Mac and Linux.

The plugin is based on qtkeychain library [2], that would become a new
dependency, the library is available on major linux distributions, it is in
homebrew and can be easily build on Windows.

Any objection if I start the integration into core? It will not be a C++
plugin but part of the authentication manager.

The reasons for having it in core is that  the current implementation uses
a pure hack to capture the password from the credentials dialog (and it's
not completely secure), there are plans to tighten security of the
authentication manager and the password helper code will need to access to
the internals of the password manager in order to interact with the
credentials storage.

I just got QGIS 3 compiling against Qt 5.8, using some custom Homebrew
formulae on macOS 10.11.6. However, Homebrew is still a day or two off from
fully supporting Qt 5.8 in all the packages that QGIS uses.

I have not noticed any major runtime errors beyond this one, specific to
macOS:
https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-57706
That causes QGIS to stall upon loading the splash screen, requiring the
user to hit Return twice to proceed. Definite regression in Qt 5.7.x -->
5.8.0.

On the plus side, for macOS, all the icons now show up properly for actions
in the menus.

Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C582A8C9@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hi all

I am looking for information regarding the issue: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/16087

According to Giovanni Manghi, the issue has been fixed but I am looking for information about which versions has been fixed. It might be just in front of me, but I cannot find a patch in the repository that directly fixes this problem - and I really don't know in which source file the issue actually occurred. My guess would be the QgsGeometryRubberBand.cpp, but besides moving a '*' from the variable type to the variable itself, I don't see changes.


Regards, Casper

Can you please create a C# version of QGIS?
I heard that C# is much more modern and stable and faster than C++.
I can help you this Saturday afternoon if you are still not finished by
then.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 3 / CRS change
Message-ID: <a782b4f5-813a-675d-2eea-61ad98c0ac62@opengis.ch>

Hi,

I just noticed a strange behavior concerning map canvas CRS.

When the first added layer is not in the same CRS as the project, the
canvas CRS is apparently changed (based on observed distortion) but not
the indicator to the bottom right of the screen. After that, I need to
change the project CRS multiple times before I get the indicator properly.

Did I get something wrong there or is this a bug? Should I open a ticket?

Thanks
Matthias

I just found a neat shortcut in QtCreator.
Just click on any string and under the refactor menu you get a "Enclose
in QStringLiteral(...)". This gets even more handy by using the
Alt+Enter key combination and makes QStringLiteral-izing things much
more straight forward.

Sounds like a great idea to me! Anything which encourages greater
take-up of the auth system and makes this easier for end users to
utilise is a good move.

Sorry to threadjack, but a related question: Larry I think mentioned maybe
removing the Python bindings for the auth system. Is that still the
intention? Nyall has implemented FTP upload in qgis2web (other connection
types such as SCP, SFTP can be developed using this framework). However,
securely saving the password would be a real benefit. The auth system would
be the most secure way to achieve this, obviously. If the Python bindings
are to be removed, there's no point in using them to allow password saving.

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=wgY9tXcUveDKdNw2m+wBX8cO_+xXbsiAyt2PsJEHKb5A@mail.gmail.com>

Recently I was studying SFCGAL [1], which most of you probably know, surely
Oslandia's people :)
I have done some tests with PostGIS and its option to swtich between GEOS
and SFCGAL as its internal geometry engine (for 3D operations).

I wondered if the current QGIS architecture could adapt to do something
similar. I lost the thread about the geometry internals refactoring but I
thought it was in the right fashion to support it with the
QgsGeometryEngine interface (abstract class). However I see that the main
entry point to the geometrical side of data, QgsGeometry, relies on the
specific and unique current engine, QgsGeos.

I'm not as expert as most of you on complex software achitectures but I
wondered why QgsGeometry refers to QgsGeos in its methods rather then using
the QgsGeometryEngine interface? If the interface was used it would
theoretically possible to "easily" switch between different engine (read a
futurist QgsSFCGALEngine).

I know this is a simplicistic view of the big picture, I imagine that there
will be a lot of intricacies to decouple the geometry management from the
geometrical engine. Anyway do you think that making the QgsGeometry (and
its related friends) rely on an abstract engine would help?

Let's rephrase it: how much work would it require to implement (complete?)
the engine decoupling?

Cheers,
Giovanni

Subject: [Qgis-developer] bug tracker cleanup
Message-ID: <CACfnYnTZ8WZVR3MhPDjT5dJGym8xFU7xt7znf0EODAOMatCeuA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Over the past few days I was tasked with the periodical triage and
cleanup the the QGIS bug tracker. As usual I focused on the issues
that supposed to be more serious, specifically (known) regressions
(priority = “severe”) and the ones that are known to cause crashes or
data corruption (priority = “high”):


causing crashes:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=116


regressions:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=115


The regressions list grouped by affected version is useful to
understand that I tagged as “affected version = master” the ones that
are really only affecting the QGIS 3 master branch.


There may be more regressions or “causing crashes” issues hidden in
the very large list (1300+) of issues tagged as “normal”: I have done
my best to spot as many as possible
but is not a quick task. Many issues are very poorly reported, needing
quite an effort to test them. The good news is that now there are a
good number of issues awaiting feedback because I was not able to
replicate them locally (usually on multiple platforms).

Anyway… if you are aware of any regression or causing crash issue now
tagged as “normal” please let me know or just change the priority
accordingly.

Speaking about the severe list you may have noticed that there are
issues that are known since a long ago, but there are also others that
are *pretty recent*, in fact there are a few regressions that have
slip into 2.18 since 2.14. Releasing now 2.18 as new LTR would mean
effectively releasing a worse QGIS compared to 2.14.

I would like to understand if before the release of the next LTR there
will be scheduled bug fixing effort, as has been done for other
releases; and, if in this is the case, it will be a targeted one, in
order to give the priority to regressions that have appeared between
2.14 and 2.18.


With regards

Note: we should really do something to ask people to be more
disciplined when posting issues, making for example the category
mandatory and  somehow help choosing the correct priority > ex: if is
a regression then “severe”, if causes a crash then “high”, use normal
for all the other cases. We should also state/force the users to try
in a clean environment, with no 3rd party plugins before reporting.


Note2: I would really like to do a major cleanup of the tracker in Essen.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Processing option menu troubles
Message-ID: <d097cdc9-9f87-d3ef-7b82-2ee38b289864@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just compiled QGIS and I found that the Processing options are in the
Settings -> Options menu

That's great, it avoid confusions for the users.

Anyway I'm experiencing some trouble when using the filtering boxes to
search the options (another super cool feature!):

* using the general filter box, it does not filter the Processing options
* very oftern the Processing options filter freezes QGIS when trying to
filter some strings and I have to kill QGIS (it happens not always, but
very often)

Wouldn't be more coherent to have just one filter (the general one) that
looks also the Processing options and get rid of the Processing one?


Just my 2cents

Cheers

Matteo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Extra 2.14 LTR lifespan by two months?
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-Rie-vFHmbBAx=+jPcXw9RWfDwt0RvZcLJ87Y8h7NQyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

After reviewing the release schedule recently put forward [0], I notice a
discrepancy between what the project has advertised (1 year LTRs for 2.x)
and when the upcoming LTRs are to released/packaged. Here is the schedule,
pruned of non-relevant dates (with one proposed new packaging date for
2.14):

LTR  2.14.0  Mar 01, 2016

LR   2.16.0  Jul 22, 2016 (2.14 LTR packaged)

LR   2.18.0  Nov 08, 2016

LTR  2.18.7  May 19, 2017

*PR   2.18.9  Jul 21, 2017 (2.18 LTR packaged - proposed)

FF   (2.99)  Aug 18, 2017

LR   3.0.0   Sep 29, 2017 (2.18 LTR packaged - current)

FF   (3.1)   May 18, 2018

LTR  3.2.0   Jun 29, 2018

LR   3.4.0   Oct 26, 2018 (3.2 LTR packaged)

What this shows is that the lifespan of 2.14 was extended by just over two
months. While two months may not seem that long, is there a reason for not
packaging the 2.18 LTR twelve months after 2.14 LTR packaging?

Besides sticking with the advertised 1 year for 2.x LTRs, changing the
*packaging-only* release date for 2.18 to Jul 21, 2017 offers these
advantages:

* Project management of the 2.x branches can be closed out a month prior to
the FF on 2.99. This keeps focus of release on the move forward to 3.0.0,
instead of mixing 2.x and 3.x releases, i.e. a clean break from 2.x
releases, making 3.0.0 the only focus when it is released.

* Regressions and bugs for 2.18 LTR, as reported by Giovanni [1], may not
get fixed if project focus is split between the 3.0.0 FF/release and 2.18
release. Keeping the community focused on finishing up problems with 2.x
and then 100% focus on 3.0.0, prior to the FF, avoids any split in limited
dev resources.

I do see the balance provided by the Sep 29, 2017 packaging date for 2.18
LTR: 14 months since 2.14 packaging and 13 months until 3.2 packaging.
However, the 2.x releases really do not need 'tied' to the 3.x releases in
any way. Having 15 months between 2.18 and 3.2 is more reasonable than
extending the time current LTR users have to wait for 2.18 LTR packages.

Opinions on proposed change of 2.18 packaging-only date? Please note: this
suggests no change whatsoever with the 3.x release schedule.

I remember discussing this in the past with someone, but can't
remember who now! I originally thought that this would be a good
option - allowing users to select the geometry backend with choices of
GEOS/CGAL. But after discussing at length (again, I can't remember
where!) I'm got convinced that this would be a really bad thing. By
allowing users to select this we'd inevitably end up with users
changing this option just because it exists, because they "tried it
and found that rendering seemed a bit smoother", or because "someone
on stackexchange said they should change it", etc. End result is that
the results from geometry operations would no longer be predictable
when using the affected API functions.

Instead, a better approach is if we selectively change certain
operations to use a different backend only after we carefully evaluate
the results for each individual operation concerned. E.g. if we found
that SFCGAL resulted in intersections which are equally reliable as
GEOS, and faster in the majority of geometries, then we'd change
QgsGeometry::intersection to ALWAYS use SFCGAL.

In other words, it'd be nice to have this choice from a development
perspective, but the choice should not be exposed to users. (After
all, it's common knowledge that we know better then them in 100% of
situations ever, including in general life stuff like choosing a
mobile phone or what to eat for breakfast).

Given the above, I don't think there's a strong argument in favour of
the QgsGeometryEngine interface and we could potentially just have
QgsGeos/QgsSfcgal classes without the common interface.

On a related note - I once nearly did the work of allowing calling
SFCGAL methods on QgsGeometry, but stopped only after I realised I'd
mis-read the CGAL docs and that the particular method I was looking
for wasn't available. I was looking for a way to obtain the
approximate medial axis of a geometry (in order to generalise dual
carriageway roads to a single line geometry), but it turns out whilst
CGAL can generate skeletons it can't do the medial axis. There's still
a few interesting algorithms available through CGAL such as alpha
shapes, but I'd lean toward just reimplementing these in QGIS directly
and avoid the expense of going through multiple geometry engines. Of
course, it's entirely possible that we could benchtest and find that
CGAL geometry operations are faster than GEOS, in which case there's a
good justification for pulling in a SCGAL dependancy... but I'd
suggest testing this thoroughly before going to any effort!

LTR 2.14.0 26.02.2016 
LTR 2.18.0 19.05.2016

More than a year.

LTR 2.18.0 19.05.2016
LTR 3.2.0  29.06.2018

Also more than a year.  So I seem to miss your point.  And there is the extra
overlap while the new LTR is already available as LR, while the old LTR is
still available.

We also didn't advertise that there was going to be another 2.x LTR.  I think
we left open everything after the release of 2.18 - except that we maintain the
old branches until there are replacements.

At any given point we maintain only two release branches and master.

Hello, currently I tag my plugin code in git, and extract and build a zip-file which is uploaded to plugin repo.
The Makefile that plugin_builder is supplyng, also have an option to zip locally deployed files for later upload.

I prefer to packaged directly from tag in git, but then every file that is in git will be packaged!

Have anyone made a mixed approach, packaging directly from a git tag, but only a sub-set of the files?

SFCGAL is not very actively developed, in its current shape is not the
best choice to build upon. It either needs more active participation
from the community, or better funding. Since the initial funding dried
up, the activity in the project slowed to a crawl.

I'm considering removing the SFCGAL support in the PostGIS Debian
package if the situation doesn't improve. For the same reasons I'd be
reluctant to enable its support in QGIS if that were to arrive.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Thanks Sebastiaan for raising this point. It's clear that if (SF)CGAL was
somehow introduced inside the core it would need maintanance.

Nyall, I agree with you. CGAL shouldn't overlap GEOS, even if its
robustness (infinite precision) can make the difference.
The real benefits would arise if/when QGIS will want to widen its SQL/MM
geometries. TINs, polyhedral surfaces, or simply 3D predicates considering
the z coordinate in 2.5D geoms.
I fear GEOS will hardly expand to 3D, therefore CGAL could be the right
candidate to fill the missing parts.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] R in Processing: errors not shown
Message-ID: <fbf2eaeb-be2a-b1e6-f18d-41c6dec1636e@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
when installing R scripts from online repo for Processing, no error is
visible to users when necessary R modules are missing, but models are
not shown. Errors are in the log:
===
2017-03-12T23:39:03	0	Comandi di esecuzione R
			options("repos"="http://cran.at.r-project.org/")
			tryCatch(find.package("rgdal"), error=function(e)
install.packages("rgdal", dependencies=TRUE))
			tryCatch(find.package("raster"), error=function(e)
install.packages("raster", dependencies=TRUE))
			library("raster")
===
IMHO this is difficult to grasp for the user, and an explicit error
should be given, together with the suggestion to install the missing libs.
Am I missing something?
Thanks.

Thanks for the heads up - this is very valuable to know before anyone

Good point.

Something I forgot to add in my original reply - instead of investing
time into utilising CGAL instead of GEOS, I'd rather see us
investigate swapping out GEOS calls to Boost::geometry calls. The
boost geometry algorithms are really nicely implemented, and their
interface avoids the need to convert between different object types
(ie QgsGeometry->GEOS). This could potentially be a big
performance/memory usage win.

Hi Magnus,

In InaSAFE plugin, we also use git-archive, but since we use git submodule,
we use git archive-all (available in brew or pip) [1]. We create script to
do the release of the plugin to make it easier [2]. We add more
functionalities like removing test related files (to make the size smaller)
and create windows installer for it.

Best Regards

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Future of spatialite provider?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjjVximMWpBQKG=5uFBgMCjNqNP1CqVEsQXAMfGX-uOkw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Time for another "can we gut this from the codebase" thread....

I'm wondering what the future of the spatialite provider should be. I
find it odd that spatialite layers utilise the dedicated spatialite
provider, but geopackage layers use the OGR provider.

I think there's potential value in removing the spatialite provider
and always reading these layers via OGR.

Can anyone see any potential issues here?

Andrea,

What was the outcome here? Is there missing functionality?

I'd like to know either way - it's a very bad situation for the
project's reputation if funded features are broken like this*.

Nyall,

I'm -1 if it means removing the add spatialite layer UI; otherwise, if UI
isn't impacted, there's definitively a rational to go ahead and use OGR
(and fix any discovered issue within the OGR library, benefiting the wider
ecosystem).

Hi Nyal,
Unfortunatelly no.
No news on this.
I have no the skill to understand what is the code interested.
I know it should on one the the committed link due a report send us at
that time.

Now I try to install the qgis 2.2 or qgis 2.4, and try to test it again.
Maybe I could do a video.

>(* insert the usual disclaimer about "no one should ever sponsor a

But for some enhancement like this, "the wms parameter scale" s quite
difficult to do a unit test.
Please pay attention that the enhancement funded from us was only in
the provider wms (the client).
The qgis-server almost at that time don't support this feature (the
abiity to have distinct scale rendering for the same layer).
This was a feature enhancement forward the other wms-server like
geoserver or mapserver.
So I guess will be quite difficult to do a UNIT-TEST.
Even if we want to do a unit-test, it need a wms service always
available and under the control of the qgis team, and obviously it
should be a qgis-server. So there was not more chance to be able to
test this enhancement that is specifically for the wms client
interface.

When is developed an enhancement for a WMS in a GIS client the test
should be done on more than the own wms service (qgis-server).
So need a mapserver, a geoserver and a qgis-server always availables.
I know this is quite impossible so also is quite impossible to do a
well formed unit-test in the wms section.

A video would be good - I'm not really sure what this change is supposed to do.

I'/m just trying to clarify... is it something which is broken, or
something which has been totally removed?

Something I forgot to add in my original reply - instead of investing

time into utilising CGAL instead of GEOS, I'd rather see us
investigate swapping out GEOS calls to Boost::geometry calls. The
boost geometry algorithms are really nicely implemented, and their
interface avoids the need to convert between different object types
(ie QgsGeometry->GEOS). This could potentially be a big
performance/memory usage win.


I think that keeping GEOS for all the Simple Features stuff (geoms,
predicates and ops) is important to remain aligned and keep comparability
with most of the other GFOSS sw based on GEOS/JTS.

The only relevant exception is GRASS GIS, but it's different in so many
ways that it is barely comparable to anyone else...

Hi Magnus,

we use a release script in QFieldSync, where we directly release from
travis when a new tag pushed and tests run successfully (and some other
conditions like tag name matches the version in metadata etc. are met).

https://github.com/opengisch/qfieldsync/blob/master/.travis.yml#L27

It also only packages a sub-folder with the plugin, so scripts for ci
etc that live outside this folder are not packaged.

Hope that helps :)

Matthias

Yeah if you are using git-archive it is going to make a zip containing everything in the tag so you need to extract that afterwards and clean out non-distributable stuff. Some folks are also using paver to do package preparation - check at some of the Boundless plugins for examples...

One thing that might actually be nice is for us to introduce some kind of Manifest file for plugins (we could just copy the system from pip) so that plugin authors can specify which files and resources get packaged.

Yeah or that :-) I think we did discuss it before and it would be pretty cool - only thing we lose really if the curated repository approach we have now (which might make some people happy I guess)...

maybe we could have a pip repo as backend. just talking out loud and

Thanks for checking. At first I also had no issue, but after some usage
the error popped up, and now I cannot get rid of it.
All the best.

less complexity = more efficiency = stronger standardization

I personally advocated to adopt such an approach one or two
years ago; maintaining an ad hoc QGIS provider simply adds
more unrequired complexity with no obvious benefits.

thanks to the magnificent work of Even Rouault the OGR
sqlite/spatialite/gpkg provider is very stable and affordable,
it's frequently updated and it's very quick in supporting the
most recent cool features introduced by subsequent updated
versions.
Even more important: many other GFOSS components (e.g.
MapServer) are based on the OGR provider, so switching
from the QGIS provider to the standard OGR provider
will obviously facilitate a smoother and more consistent
integration between different tools/apps.

In MetaSearch we have a release workflow for 'out-of-band' releases
from QGIS core which was inherited from when MetaSearch was not a core
QGIS plugin.

MetaSearch uses Paver to generate a zipfile for upload to plugins.qgis.org [1].
You can see the core machinery to generate the zipfile at [2].

Hope this helps.

Since point releases are not announced on the list any more, I often miss them for packaging.  I usually see a reference to them on the list in a question.  Also, I've been a bit occupied lately with other things.  I'll work on packaging the latest updates soon.

that sounds weird. Unless I'm wrong (and except the packages rgdal and
raster) I thought that Processing would automatically download and
install the additional packages if missing.

Are you sure that the error is related to the missing packages?

ok, not sure if this is related to this mandatory R packages

> after installing them, the error is gone, and the entries appear on the list

ok, do you have ggplot2 installed? If not, try to import the attached
script (copy and paste the content in the editor) and try to use it

if it works and you did not had ggplot2 installed then Processing is
able to install additional packages, if not, then I'm totally wrong :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS remote control API
Message-ID: <CANVKczMg+hERdzAQqmMiksGv52gfUrub9xO_-SLXPmYLsUAxzw@mail.gmail.com>

My first job was in integrating spatial statistics and GIS. In those
days (1990) that meant Arc/Info version 4 and FORTRAN, until we
discovered S-Plus and ditched Arc/Info for real statistics software.

Twenty six years on and still thinking about integration. Some of you
may have seen my very sketchy R package that starts up a map canvas
and layer list and then lets R users add map data to the canvas. It
works via a libpython interpreter loaded into R and then making PyQGIS
API calls. My GSoC 2017 proposal is basically improving and extending
that.

But I've leant towards a slightly different idea - remote control of a
QGIS instance. There exists already a QgsRemoteControl plugin which is
intended to keep two QGIS instances in sync with respect to projection
and extent etc. But what I'd like to do is have an HTTP API that could
also add and modify data layers to a running QGIS, potentially from
any client.

So once set up, you could do:

 wget http://localhost:17919/zoom?extent=...

 wget --post-file=map.json http://localhost:17919/addlayer

and so on. Then any "mapping deficient" programming language or system
could then have a client written for that API and use whatever
functionality is exposed by it.

 I've already got a basic HTTP server that runs in Qgis and accepts
requests, and it uses the Qt event system so is totally non-blocking
(except when actually processing a request).

 Is this a good idea/useful idea/dumb idea? I can rewrite my GSoC to
more reflect this idea if its thought useful. I have been contacted by
a possible student with an interest.

Here is just a reminder from a user/plugin maintainer, please ignore if not
relevant.

If the spatialite data provider is to be removed then we will have to
update some plugins to reflect that which is ok, not a big deal. But it is
important that the current features of the spatialite data provider are
included into the OGR provider before changing.

E.g. we are using the spatalite data provider in plugins to add non-spatial
spatialite tables. I could not achieve this by using the OGR provider
(although it was a couple of years ago I was looking into this and it may
have changed by now).

regards
Josef

Hi Josef,

 From http://www.gdal.org/drv_geopackage.html

"The core GeoPackage specification does not currently support 
non-spatial tables, but starting with GDAL 2.0, the driver allows 
creating and reading such tables via the Aspatial Support 
(gdal_aspatial) extension. Note: starting with GDAL 2.2, the driver will 
also, by default, list non spatial tables that are not registered 
through the gdal_aspatial extension."

So with newer GDAL versions it is possible to create and read 
non-spatial tables.

Andreas

Andreas,

This thread was about the spatialite driver ;-) Support for spatial and non-spatial layers has 
always existed in OGR core, but what is available for a given format is driver specific.

Regarding GeoPackage the doc was a bit out of date. I've just updated it :

"""
Non-spatial tables

The core GeoPackage specification of GeoPackage 1.0 and 1.1 did not support non-spatial 
tables. This was added in GeoPackage 1.2 as the "attributes" data type.

Starting with GDAL 2.0, the driver allows creating and reading non-spatial tables with the 
Aspatial Support (gdal_aspatial) extension.

Starting with GDAL 2.2, the driver will also, by default, list non spatial tables that are not 
registered through the gdal_aspatial extension, and support the GeoPackage 1.2 "attributes" 
data type as well. Starting with GDAL 2.2, non spatial tables are by default created following 
the GeoPackage 1.2 "attributes" data type (can be controlled with the ASPATIAL_VARIANT 
layer creation option)
"""

Regarding the SQLite/Spatialite driver, there is an opening option, LIST_ALL_TABLES=YES, 
that can be set so as to list all tables, and not only those registered in the geometry_columns 
table.

Even - I'm interested to hear your thoughts here. Do you think there's
any good reason for a dedicated spatialite provider?

The *only* reason I can see (would need to be tested) is that
potentially there's a cost to the spatialite -> OGR -> QgsFeature
translation, vs just spatialite -> QgsFeature. But my hunch is that
this would be offset by optimisations present in the OGR driver which
aren't in the QGIS provider.

I've not necessarily all the functionalities of the spatialite provider in mind. I think some 
specialized logic in the spatialite case (there's already some for GPKG) might be needed to be 
ported into the OGR provider, so as to get feature parity. For example things like 
QgsSpatiaLiteProvider::pkAttributeIndexes() or QgsSpatiaLiteProvider::discoverRelations() 
(non exhaustive list)

There's the question of the provider UI and connection strings.

In practice waiting for I/O to be completed is probably the major bottleneck.

Hi,

Thanks for the discussion.

SFCGAL is interesting for algorithms that are not yet present in other
geometry backends. Especially when dealing with 3D geometries.

We understand very well concerns that have been raised here.
For information, we are aware of some issues with SFCGAL that we
would like to tackle in the future:

- geometry conversion. We designed SFCGAL as yet another geometry
backend, with its own data structure to handle geometry primitives.
Converting back and forth between, say postgis internal format, and ours
takes some time.
The approach taken by boost::geometry where you can provide "adaptors"
for a specific internal geometry representation is a very good one. We
could imagine here SFCGAL as a set of algorithms (rather than a library
with its own data structure) that have adaptors to postgis geometries,
qgis geometries, etc.

- use of "exact" computations. It is interesting when you can store and
keep construction information in geometries (like "this point has been
constructed by the intersection of these two lines") because lots of
computations can afterward be avoided / simplified.
But as it is used now in postgis (and would be in qgis), all the
geometries are coming from raw floating point numbers without any
additional information. Which leads to slow conversion from doubles to
rational numbers, slow validity verification and slow algorithms. The
point about validity has been tackled and we should introduce a validity
flag on geometries in postgis hopefully soon.

For the more general case, a better approach would be to avoid using
exact computations for geometric constructions by using exact predicates
and inexact constructions and detecting validity issues. From last talks
with people from GeometryFactory that seems doable for algorithms that
work on 2D/3D meshes.

- python. Having a Python API would be very handy to play with the
library. This could probably be the way it gets used in qgis as a first
step.

So, next moves on SFCGAL would be to refactor it a bit so that it
gets faster and easier to integrate into existing libs / apps. If you
are interested in funding such new developments, feel free to contact us.

Just for information, Sandro Santilli implemented approximate medial

well... I did that functionality for Faunalia, and during dev I
checked if there where a suitable test environment. At that time there
where fifty tests and almost 30% of them failing (asking about this on
the dev list). Btw, I strongly agree with you nyall "no one should
ever sponsor a feature without an explicit requirement for unit tests
in the contract"
now the situation is really and positively different :)

I'm doing some spatial analysis with R. I've read in a shapefile:

 > data = shapefile("input.shp")

then I've done some analysis:

 > data$stats = something(data)

Now I want to map it. I can use R's plot function, but that's not
interactive, hard to add background layers and style, no labelling,
cartography etc. I could use leaflet, but that requires JS code to get
anything custom. So I write a shapefile:

 > shapefile(data, "output.shp")

Start QGIS, load the shapefile, realise all my column names have been
mashed to 12 characters (or whatever), style it. Go "huh" and think.
Back to R. Repeat.

With a QGIS remote control API I could do something like:

 > addQgisLayer(data)

and *bang* there it is in Qgis. With data flow in that direction, Qgis
is a cartographic display for R's spatial data. But data flow could go
the other way - so that Qgis layers could be easily read back into R
spatial data.

 In theory you could wrap the entire Python API to the remote control
API. At that point the use cases are almost like any Python QGIS use
cases, except expanded to any language or system that can send a web
request. R, Matlab,  JS, perl, ruby.. even Python if you want to be
slightly perverse and can't run from the python interpreter.

We had a QGIS plugin developed for the planning system we use.You start to
add a planning application into it, then you press the plot button, and QGIS
starts with certain layers open. You plot the app, then press a plugin
button, and you are sent back to the planning software, with the polygon
associated with the new planning record. I don't know how it does all that,
but the process can certainly start outside QGIS.

As I say, I don't know how it does all this, but it does beg the question of
how much of this can already be done.

I never tested, but I see there is https://github.com/3liz/qgis-wps4server
a server-plugin to perform remote geoprocessing jobs.
Anyway I think this could be very handy for remote qgis-server
administration.

Note: master password saving/restoring (as noted in this thread) is
different than the connection credentials stored/retrieved in the auth
system.

What Python bindings will be removed is still open for discussion. I will
soon be submitting a QEP for Qt5 updates/refactoring of the QGIS auth
system, as well as security hardening.

However, there always needs to exist within the auth system GUI bindings a
simple means for plugins to offer their users a way of selecting and
utilizing auth system configurations. This is already supported with the
QgsAuthConfigSelect widget [0]. In this way, a plugin author just needs to
include the auth system widgets in their plugin's layout (if defining
connections are key to the plugin's functionality). Then, all that the
plugin needs to store/retrieve is the 'authcfg' token that represents an
auth system configuration.

The problem comes in when a plugin *prefers* to utilize a different HTTP
(or other connection) library instead of interacting with
QgsNetworkAccessManager. In these cases, the plugin needs access to not
only the auth configuration, but also its actual saved credentials, to pass
to the Python library/package. This could be allowed, if the user
specifically authorizes a plugin to do so (API for this does not yet exist).

Another approach, instead of (or in addition to) creating an "authorized
plugins cache," is to harden the auth system to always disallow access to
credentials from plugins, then offer drop in wrappers for common Python
connection libs, supporting QgsNetworkAccessManager and the QGIS auth
system. Indeed, Alessandro Pasotti has already done this for 'httplib2'
[0]; and, it could be done for 'requests'.

Note: this latter approach also allows the plugin to inherit the QGIS app's
proxy settings associated with QgsNetworkAccessManager, as well as any auth
system enhancements applied to the QgsNetworkAccessManager class (some are
planned).

In summary, right now, with QGIS >= 2.14, you can easily use
QgsAuthConfigSelect widget in your plugins, then pass the authcfg into the
httplib2 wrapper, getting support for QgsNetworkAccessManager and the QGIS
auth system without then need to expose credentials to Python. Then, the
core auth system classes manage the master password, auth configuration
setup and credential expansion. This type of plugin auth configuration
integration will likely never be removed from the bindings.

Thread definitely hijacked :^) Any further discussion should be in the
upcoming auth system QEP.

you can already open a project from command line, so what you need is
only to create project template, use it and start qgis on this
project.... btw if you want a more sophisticated bridge to have
control on qgis, you can simply run a plugin that start a python
simple http server (as in RemoteControl plugin) at which to send your
commands. The plugin listener will dispatch the correct execution to
qgis (it would make sense to have a plugin with commands as plugins ;)

expanding your idea the plugin can setup a webrtc client that receive
pushed stream data from a relay server => e.g. IoT devices sending
data streams.... I did a proof of concept just to test and works, it's
just few line of code... most of the code would be what to do with
these commands or data stream.

IMHO it's not necessary to have it as a core feature

cheers

Nice! That's exactly what makes boost::geometry so attractive in my
opinion. Fingers crossed someone steps up and funds this work.

Hmm... this changes *everything*! I'm going to see if I can use this
as an argument to get some time from one of my existing contracts to
work on this. They have a strong need for the previously described
road generalisation algorithm, so maybe I can use this as a push to
get some time for this.

Message-ID: <6a9ac4a3-735f-e9f5-1546-6e34aaba808b@gmx.de>

Hi all,
my name is Julia Wagemann and I saw the call of OSGeo for Mentors for 
GSoC. I had a look to the proposed projects and I would be interested to 
be a mentor. I further have two ideas for projects and Helmut advised me 
to discuss these within the QGIS developers mailing list

My background is in Environmental Informatics and I am currently working 
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in a project 
where we explore the opportunity to provide a more standardised and 
easier access to our data with the help of a OGC Web Coverage Service. I 
have experience with QGIS and lately, I am working a lot with Jupyter 
Notebooks.
I have two ideas for projects for students to work on during GSoC:

- Plugin for WCS2.0 in QGIS
QGIS supports by default Web Coverage Service 1.0. A project could be to 
develop a plugin for supporting Web Coverage Service 2.0 in QGIS.

- Examples of geospatial workflows in Jupyter Notebooks
I am a strong advocate of Jupyter Notebooks and one project could be, in 
alignment with the project proposed for GRASS GIS (adding functionality 
for running GRASS GIS modules in Jupyter Notebooks), to develop a set of 
used-cases to show how Jupyter Notebooks are beneficial for the 
generation of entire geospatial data analysis workflows, from data 
access to data manipulation and data visualisation. Examples could 
harness QGIS, and in the best case, open data.

What is you opinion about the suggestions and would you be interested in 
co-mentoring one of those?
Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.
Best regards,
Julia

Tested: it runs, but fails because it does not find the function
scale_y_continuous, so I suppose it does not install ggplot2.

Yes, it wouldn't be a good idea for every plugin that wanted to do
some sort of remote control to implement its own server. Perhaps there
should be a server plugin that plugins can hook into at a given URL,
so they can attach a handler function to http://host:port/wherever

 I'd be interested to see those few lines since I've not played with webrtc.

Totally agree. It would get minority usage and is implementable in
plugins, so no need to have core dev involvement and support. They've
enough to do!

but you can design your plugin to be used by other plugins and with a
"plugin" structure...
e.g. a lot o people use Processings algs thanks of ther interface
offered by the processing  plugin.

btw these are my 2c

IMHO wouold be fantastic if feasible! I did a research and it's almost
impossible to have a real deep interaction with a notebook. My ideas
was to integrate notebook with IPython console plugin. BTW the IPYthon
console is based on QtConsole that does not allow a shared kernel =>
Notebook and internal IPYthon console wouldn't share the same data
space. Obviously there can be other solutions and I hope you can find
a way to have a good user experience.
IMHO this integration could be key feature for some data oriented user profiles.

ok, that's weird, I was sure that Processing was able to donwload and

Hi Vincenzo,
not many people here speack italian, and it is also not the idea to
write in languages other than english here.

For that I sure the mailing list on gfoss.it is a better place. on the
other hand, if you write here in english you get exposure to the core
developers and people that develop a lot with/in QGIS.

this also means doing your homeworks before writng. in your specific
case a simple google search "count points in layer pyQGIS " would have
given you the answer [1]. even faster would be to go have a look at the
QGIS API documentation [2]. probably also the qgis python cookbook would
have some hints [3]

So, enjoy counting your points and learning the QGIS docs

ciao
Marco

Hi all,
following the previous long discussion about qgis documentation policy on
branches, qgis server refactor work gives us a good opportunity to complete
in qgis server documentation. (yes! )

Let's take this as an opportunity to summarize the previous thread in one
question:

Can we  safely start making pull requests against master branch of doc
repository
directly?

Thanks for your lights!

Hi Régis,

To summarize the answer: Yes, you can!

Feel free to send pull requests to the master branch in QGIS-Documentation
repository for 3.0 features.

Thanks!

Hi Luigi,
thanks for your prompt reply and your opinion to the ideas.
So I would go ahead in proposing the two projects as part of GSoC and we 
will see. Even the outcome of a list of requirments for QGIS / Jupyter 
integration would be a step forward, I guess. What is the best way to 
propose the project on the QGIS wiki? Can everyone subscribe?
Best regards,
Julia

Hi Julia,
agreed, if possible, that would be really a great step forward !

Wiki here is opened, yes: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki

To the community: there is not yet a page dedicated to GsoC Project, did we
create something elsewhere?

Hi Julia,

- Plugin for WCS2.0 in QGIS
> QGIS supports by default Web Coverage Service 1.0. A project could be to

I am not sure since I just reinstalled my machine and I can't try it now (I
am building QGIS 2.18 now), but it seems that someone already builds the
plugin (?) (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QgsWcsClient2/)

Cheers

Hi Akbar,
thanks for pointing it out. I am aware of this plugin, however I never 
managed to have it working and it strongly relates to the Earth 
Observation Application Profile of the WCS 2.0 standard. Part of the 
project could be also to extend this plugin to a more general solution 
and a working one.
Cheers,
Julia

P.S. Please let me know if you manage to work with the plugin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Creating crop marks / fold marks in print composer
 - drawing exact lines in print composer
Message-ID: <8e0a518b8d0521a09673dd5434059da5@carto.net>

Hi, 

We are trying to exactly (numerically) place lines (arrows or polylines)
in print composer - but it seems almost impossible: 

The two main problem are: 

 	* one cannot numerically edit vertices of an arrow or polyline element
 	* the lines box is larger than the actual line, which means the line
doesn't really end where the box ends. This makes it impossible to
numerically place and scale arrows lines. Also snapping doesn't work,
because of this.

Some other related problems: 

 	* neither arrows nor polyline snap to guide lines
 	* while arrows can be constrained to exact angles by pressing the
"shift" key, this doesn't seem to work with polylines.
 	* My crop marks could be points with the usual QGIS simple markers,
but I can't place a point in my print composer

My questions are: 

 	* is there an alternative that works now (in QGIS 2.18)? E.g. a plugin
that draws crop marks and fold marks?
 	* Are there any improvements planned for QGIS 3.0 in this respect?
 	* Can the issue that the selection box doesn't match the dimensions of
the arrows be fixed in QGIS 3.0?

Thanks, 

Andr

Hi All

Does anyone else have issues with digitizing in master? On MacOS here built with Qt 5.8:

I can reliably get it to crash by using the node tool and trying to insert a new node. Generally moving nodes around on QGIS dev with the node tool will raise an exception at some point. Can anyone else replicate this or is it only me and my Mac that experience this?

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

is there any chance that you could upload a stacktrace from the crash
somewhere?

Message-ID: <CAEEbjBga-11FSteGhy=+r-CV2URxjA7faEC1M46oiOaZV43VSw@mail.gmail.com>

For the last 10 days I have been attempting to build QGIS 3.0 master from
scratch.
For this QT 5 also had to be build, which is not an easy task.

In the past I had used the 'run' scripts, which installed the source
- qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.7.1.run
but after the first installment I noticed that QGIS needed a modal that had
not been included: QtWebKit

The there is QScintilla,PyQt5 (with sip) and Qwt
- Qwt: did not install the libs where PyQt5 could not find it
- QScintilla  did not accept the –-pyqt=PyQt5 parameter, so
the configure.py had to be adapted

And then there is the cmake of QGIS3 itself, which in itself is a horror
dream come true
- instead of asking *once* for the 'Qt5 cmake' directory
-- it asks it about 12 times for the 17 modals needed
--> I assume ccmake determines for each module the dependencies, but for
the user this is a horrible -  time consuming experience

---
For this reason I think it would be a good idea to add an area in the QGIS
wiki with tip how this should be done,

Based on a specific QGIS version
- which other versions (QT5, python3 [python 3.5.3rc1 does not work, python
3.4.6 does] etc.) should be used
- basic howto's to
-- build QT5 from scratch (like using git that contains QtWebKit, as
apposed to the 'run' that does not)
-- known irregularities
---> copy the Qwt/libs to the Qt5/libs so that PyQt5 can find them
---> QScintilla how to adapt the configure.py script to create the needed
PyQt5 version

The goal would be to offer a guideline for those doing this for the first
time
- avoiding known traps

---
Something in the form of (based on the present wiki):

Organize an event
...
Collaborative documents
...
Building QGIS 3.0 from scratch
 Building QT 5 from scratch
   Building and correctly installing Qwt
   Building QScintilla for PyQt5
   Building PyQt5
 QGIS3 ccmake

I would be willing to start this with my experiences.

Hi Mark,

Are the dependencies not available for your distribution?

Except for some very special systems (Android, very old ubuntu versions
on travis...) I never ever build these dependencies manually and just
install them.

Hi all, my name is André, this is my first email on this list.

I've also struggled with building QGIS before, and besides the problems
mentioned by Mark, the default installed libraries are often incompatible
with QGIS or some of its dependencies.
I'd be willing to help with documenting my steps or possibly contributing
code to the scripts as I attempt to build on a clean OS.

André

Hi André and Mark,

Can you clarify on which systems you are working and which dependencies
cause headaches?

In many situations, a build of Qt is not required and doing this
requires deep understanding of all the involved libraries. I would
strongly advice anyone to first explore other alternatives before
starting the walk on this tricky road.

For reference, here is a set of script that is able to build many of the
dependencies (into a custom root path) for those who still want to do it:
https://github.com/opengisch/osgeo4travis/tree/master/docker/qt5/scripts

Best regards
Matthias

In my case I am working on an old machine, where many things have been
installed in the past and cause conflicts. So until a new machine can be
bought I am attempting to get this done in a custom application directory,
where QGIS is then called from a script where the needed environment vars
are set so that everything needed is found first.
In my case it is since there are QT3, QT4 and older QT5 installed.
So a separate, clean,  QT5 is needed.

At present I have everything compiled, but QGIS3 fails due to something,
some complaining about different libpng's being found:

# libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.6.10
# libpng warning: Application  is  running with png.c from libpng-1.2.56
# libpng error: Incompatible libpng version in application and library

Here I assume the default libcairo loads libpng-1.2.56, which QT5 used
libpng-1.6.10,
which is installed in /usr/local/lib for librasterlite2.

So at the moment I have installed libcairo using libpng-1.6.10 in
/usr/local/lib, and recompiling QT5 using the internal PNG/JPEG libs.

>>In many situations, a build of Qt is not required and doing this

Yes and the idea a Wiki page/area for 'Building QGIS from scratch' could
assist in making that easier.

Thanks for the input, Matthias.

It's been some time since I built it from scratch, so I wouldn't be able to
provide specifics. But it was on Ubuntu 16, and Mark's comments about Qt5,
QScintylla and libpng did ring a bell for me, since the email.
I'll try again on the next couple of days and if there's interest I can
report on how it went.

What would be interesting for such situations would be something like
AppImage. I tried that some time ago but stopped because I got
sidetracked. It would still be very interesting for a wider purpose.

Some discussion can be found here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3784

If you manage to get this running, we will be able to offer
cross-distribution downloads.
I'll buy you some coffees or beers for that.

I suspect these kind of conflicts differ from system to system and
documenting them on a page could end up in a collection of red herrings.
(I might be wrong here).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ShapeTools XY to Line
Message-ID: <CABPxTTpNC6ELn0dVxxuobFhsekCcWfrvJ7C-CMSj095PYewEsQ@mail.gmail.com>

Recently I implemented an 'XY to Line' function in the ShapeTools plugin.
This has been requested several times and I needed it so I implemented it.
See

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/shapetools/

XY to Line is similar to the ArcGIS tool with the same name.

http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/xy-to-line.htm

In my plugin I have only implemented "Great Circle" lines as well as a
simple line between the two points. How important would it be to implement
other geodetic line types ie GEODESIC , RHUMB_LINE, and NORMAL_SECTION. I
had the code for Great Circle so it was easy to implement, but I don't know
how to implement the others. I have seen some of the suggestions with
drawing these lines by using custom azimuthal equidistant (aeqd) projection
or a gnomonic (gnom) projection centered on the starting point, creating a
simple line, densifying it, then projecting it back to the projection being
used. See

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/133026/great-circles-in-qgis-and-export-in-3857-webmap

Would this technique work to create the other types of geodetic lines and
if so what would the proper proj4 projections be? Is there a better way to
do this? Do you think that Great Circle is sufficient?

Another question I have is whether there are other ArcGIS functions that
are missing in QGIS that would be good to implement.

Thanks,

C. Hamilton

I can implement Vincenty as I have some of that code as well - at least for
WGS84. I am not an expert on projections so I am not sure how to change the
code to make it work for any ellipsoid.

I look into that code next week and see about replacing my algorithms with
it.

I suppose that what one really wants is the most accurate algorithm so
perhaps it doesn't make sense to use support multiple algorithms.

Thanks for your suggestion!!!

Hi Mark!

That's great news - I'm sure many people will be happy to see the
build process documented and will appreciate your work doing this.

Before you get started on doing this work, please be aware that the
wiki is no longer used actively and will likely be removed in the
future.

You should instead make your contributions to the "developers guide" -
source is at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/tree/release_2.18/source/docs/developers_guide.

I assume you mean the wiki area, which is nice since I have experience in
that type of wiki
--> https://github.com/geopaparazzi/libjsqlite-spatialite-android/wiki

I have started an area prepairing the topics
--> https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/wiki/Building-QGIS-3#topics

No, I mean in the .rst files. Send the changes via a PR. Then it'll be
added to the developers guide at
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/

Bonus points if it looks like:

Well, I have no idea what :
* .rst files are
* how to make then or
* how to view them

The wiki pages I can do on the fly while working this out.
Can you live with a wiki version ?
- if not I will stop it

I'm new here, so I'll ask the obvious question:

Wikis are great because they lower the bar to collaboration. It's really
easy to make edits and you don't have to worry about them getting approved
and that's awesome. Really easy workflow, more so than github pull requests.
New and potential contributors don't get discouraged.

What's the reason for putting up barriers to documentation like this?

Problems with spam or low quality edits? Can I find a robust discussion
of the tradeoffs in the list archives?

The wiki information got outdated very fast, and was also not translatable
easily.
A decision was made a while ago for official documentation should be done
int the same workflow
as the website in order to streamline that process and make sure everyone
is using the same tools.

Hello,

I would like to relaunch my question below.
More info: I installed packages like mentionned in the install doc :

apt-get install bison ca-certificates cmake dh-python doxygen flex gdal-bin
libgdal-dev python3-gdal etc

But then it told me I needed gdal 2.0, so I remove all above mentionned gdal
packages and installed again after adding
https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntugis-unstable to my
repositories.

Thank you
Pierre

Hi All,
I am Sai Harsh from India. I am using QGIS from past 8 months.
I want to know is the new QGIS supports both Python 3 and Python 2?
Can I install plugin after building it without restarting qgis?.(the new
plugin is stored in ../python/plugin)
If I install QGIS do I need to install plugin builder separately?

Thanks & Regards,
Sai Harsh

And can I add the constant hard fight against fake user accounts adding
wiki spam? (see osgeo wiki).

The workflow we have now is translatable, can be build to pdf's, is
versioned and is continuously tested/rebuild.

I "discovered" that ubuntu is promoting an universal package manage,

"ubuntu snap", that seems to have some advantages like isolation

and parallel installation of different versions of the program,

could it be interesting for QGIS to have snap packages?

What is the status of the proper QgsOgrProvider implementaion of GDAL 2.0,
as described at this offered solution:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3697

And was first reported on the 31.03.2015:
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/12479

One way or another this matter needs to be resolved before an initial
release of QGIS 3.

The present master version does not read tables that have more than one
geometry correctly.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis-2.18.4 denies using QGIS_PLUGINPATH?
Message-ID: <4b01e0f4-508e-1a1f-fac4-2cdfb3894193@mwerk.net>

Hi all,

I need some help setting up a separate path to the qgis plugin libs.
I think the environment variable QGIS_PLUGINPATH or the --configpath
setting is not respected during the run of qgis_mapserv.fcgi?


Background:
I try to setup multiple versions of qgis on our server in parallel.
We need this on our server to run multiple qgis configurations (round
about 30 card configs) on our server. To ease the upgrade testing we
decided to provide an individual qgis version setting for each card.

This should work as follows:
1) Copy all libraries needed to a separate directory.
2) Run the binary with hints to use the new directory path
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/qgis-2.18.4/lib
QGIS_PLUGINPATH=/usr/local/lib/qgis-2.18.4/lib
QT_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/qgis-2.18.4/lib
/usr/local/lib/qgis-2.18.4/bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi


The error:
If I call the fcgi program with LD_DEBUG=files LD_LIBRARY_PATH=...
I get the following message:
calling init: /usr/lib/qgis/plugins/libarcgisfeatureserverprovider.so
But this is the wrong directory.

Even though I provided the QGIS plugin path with
QGIS_PLUGINPATH=/usr/local/lib/qgis-2.18.4/lib, --configpath
/usr/local/lib/qgis-2.18.4/lib or
--configpath=/usr/local/lib/qgis-2.18.4/lib
the lib gets loaded from /usr/lib/qgis/plugins instead of
/usr/local/lib/qgis-2.18.4/lib

Is this a bug or do I need to use a different variable?


Using qgis-2.18.4 on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS

QGIS_PLUGINPATH allows to specify a Python plugins path (yes, bad naming,
totally my fault), what you are looking for is probably QGIS_PREFIX_PATH.

Mark,

Most of my comments in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3697#issuecomment-257366410 and
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3697#issuecomment-257571410 still hold true and I'd 
really like see them taken into account.

What has changed since them is that we only support GDAL >= 2.0 in master now, so that can 
simplify things.

Are you willing to rework your PR ? Actually I think it should be completely revisited since 
looking at the diff of the current PR, I see no use of OGR_F_GetGeomFieldRef() so it seems 
that you select among the various different geometry fields by relying on the 
"layer_name(geometry_field_name)" syntax that is implemented in the SQLite driver, but just 
as a backward compatible way. But this will not work with other drivers.

But perhaps I didn't understand the PR. There are so many things in it that it is too hard to 
review. I think you should target at something that minimizes the number of changes (for 
example switching from the OGR_DS_ to GDALDataset API doesn't directly seem related to 
supporting layers with multiple geometries, so that should be left aside).

Hi,

Call for presentations ends today (or tomorrow?) for FOSS4G 2017 in Boston.

Is someone from the QGIS project already giving, or submitted a proposal
for, a 'State of QGIS' type of presentation?

If not I will be going and am willing to put in a proposal for such a talk,
highlighting QGIS 3 development and upcoming release (if the community is
OK with that). If so, I would prefer to co-present with someone from the
project who will also be attending.

+1 on adding this to 2.18.

Would it be possible to include a dropdown arrow on the "Open Attribute
Table" icon, similar to the behavior of the Feature Selection tool? This
way a user can trigger the default option (show all features) by clicking
on the icon, but can also choose "Show selected features" by clicking the
dropdown.

In the provider we could decide to allocate layer ids diffently than OGR .

Example if you have a dataset with
- layer1 (geom1, geom2)
- layer2 (geom)

Then you would map that to :
- qgis_ogr_provider_layer_id = 1: layer1, geom1
- qgis_ogr_provider_layer_id = 2: layer1, geom2
- qgis_ogr_provider_layer_id = 3: layer2, geom

Yes. And that's perfectly fine. That's only an issue that can happen for us developers playing 
with different versions, and we know how to solve those issues. Real world users that receive 
software through binary distributions will never have to deal with such version mismatch, so 
no need to clutter the code for those situations.

Dear all,
I am Sai Harsh from India, from past 8 months, I am using QGIS.
These are the things I am thinking to add in qgis.
1. Without restarting qgis, it will display the newly added plugin. best of
my knowledge this feature is not present in qgis.
2.Let us suppose if in a .csv file we have lat, long column, when it's
uploaded to qgis it will mark all the places which this lat & long is
representing.(If user needs it), it's useful because lat & long are used
quite often.
3. While uploading the .csv file (in which duplicate names exist) to merge
with attribute table in qgis, the duplicates can be merge depending on the
formula applied, this feature is not present in qgis.
4. Qgis to support Python 3 without breaking python 2.

Please suggest whether it's a good project to work on.

Awaiting for a positive response.

Thanks & Regards,
Harsh

I am not sure who else is going along, but it will be great if you can present on behalf of the project! Big +1 from me!

Hi Larry,

I would also welcome, if you could present on behalf of the project.

I won't be there - I'd love to come. I like Boston / Cambridge. But I 
can't join FOSS4G this time.

Thanks a lot,

Andreas

Which gdal function would then called for this construction
- the function that needs an id cannot use qgis_ogr_provider_layer_id

Some value must also be stored in the project, that must be valid days or
weeks later.

Is there a function that can use the original id
and OGR_F_GetGeomFieldRef()?

 The proposed solution for this constellation for-sees
- at application start: read and store the version numbers
- QgsOgrProvider returns null when version < 2
-- avoiding a crash with a Lookup error [in Linux at least occurs at the
first use of an unknown function. Windows??]

Hi Mark!

Please keep in mind that's there's some non-negotiables here:

1. No extra code will be allowed in master to handle GDAL < 2.0. QGIS
3.0 has a hard GDAL >= 2.0 requirement, and no code will be accepted
to work around this requirement.

2. 2.18 is a stable branch and only bug fixes which do not affect the
stability of the release will be accepted. As it stands PR #3697
(opened against 2.18) is far too intrusive for inclusion in the stable
release branch.

As Even stated, you'll need to open a series of smaller,
self-contained PRs against the master branch only (keeping in mind the
requirement that all master code is GDAL >= 2.0 only). When these are
accepted it's possible that certain PRs from this series will be
applicable for backporting to 2.x, but that will need to be determined
only after the PRs have been fully reviewed and accepted in to master.

Good point.

There are different issues you've raised and that we might want handle or not:
1) make sure that a URI points to the same layer if the datasource evolves (new layer)
2) be able to deal with the corner cases of layers with same name

1) involves that we cannot always rely on the index of the layer in the layer list returned by 
OGR
2) involves that we cannot always rely on the layer name to identify uniquely a layer (can 
happen in some drivers like KML)

Fun situation...

So if we want to address both we need the layer_id and layer_name. I'd say when you build a 
OGR URI (mostly in QgisApp::askUserForOGRSublayers()), then look at the uniqueness of the 
layer names. If there's layer name unicity, then use only the layer name. Otherwise fallback to 
uniquely the layer_id (and well in that case if the datasource changes at some point, we 
might have an issue indeed)

On opening in the povider, if you have both the layer_name and layer_id, then prefer the 
layer_name as currently : 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L186

On top of that, we need to add an extra argument to store the geometry column name in the 
URI and in the output of subLayers().
With OGR_FD_GetGeomFieldIndex(feat_defn, geom_field_name) you get the index that 
OGR_F_GetGeomFieldRef(feature, geom_field_index) wil use.

All this would impact mainly AnalyzeURI in qgsogrprovider.cpp, QgsOgrProvider::subLayers() 
and QgisApp::askUserForOGRSublayers()

Hi Sai!

Thanks for raising interested in this - we'd love to have more GSOC
candidates for the project!

Some specific comments inline below:

That's already present if plugins are installed using the plugin
installer. The master version of the installer also allows
installation of offline plugin zips, which will immediately be loaded
without restart.

> 2.Let us suppose if in a .csv file we have lat, long column, when it's uploaded to qgis it will mark all the places which this lat & long is representing.(If user needs it), it's useful because lat & long are used quite often.

That's also already present, using either the delimited text provider
or the OGR provider.

> 4. Qgis to support Python 3 without breaking python 2.

We've made the decision that QGIS 3.0 is when we break API and move to
Python 3 only. We won't accept backward compatibility here as it gets
very tricky with our various dependencies, especially PyQt. So the
master branch is now fully Python 3 and does not support Python 2.

> 3. While uploading the .csv file (in which duplicate names exist) to merge with attribute table in qgis, the duplicates can be merge depending on the formula applied, this feature is not present in qgis.

This sounds interesting! We could certainly benefit a lot from both
greater power available through joins and relations, and also
duplicate management is quite poor in QGIS. I'd suggest the second
half of this (duplicate management) could be a great project to
explore.

Isn't this about PR #3697 - which is opened against 2.18? If #3697 is
abandoned, can I close to clean up the PR queue?

The proposed solution deals with problem in QgsOgrProvider::subLayers()
- searches for duplicate names
-- an extra parameter tells QgsOgrProvider if the given id or layername
should be used
- default layername, otherwise id

All of this is stored in the URI for the project.

This was tested with the KML where the problem was reported
- it was then that the layername was removed (i.e. is no longer sent to
QgsOgrProvider by subLayers()) last June

On top of that, we need to add an extra argument to store the geometry
> column name in the URI and in the output of subLayers().

The layername is also needed for the display in QGIS

Since the problem is not resolved, no.

The present QGIS 3.0 cannot table with more than geometry.
- at that time there was no QGIS 3
I changed that to 3.0 this morning.

Perhaps we can avoid that extra parameter, and have the layer name prioritary over the layer 
id when both are found ?

Not sure to what you are refering too, since I can see the layerName returned here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L700

The layer name can be stored in subLayers() for conveniency, since it has usually a short life. 
And for subLayers() / askUserForOGRSublayers() make the layer id what is used.

The original code did many tasks being coded multiple times
- these common tasks are written once in a extra function that is used when
needed.

The gdal portions where depreciated gdal 1* functions where used
- are also in extra functions with a switch statement for the different
versions

This was done in preparation for when gdal 1* should expire (i. E. QGIS 3).

All that needs to be done is to remove the gdal 1 portion of the switch
where the gdal 1 code is used.

Great - looking forward to seeing you push this to the PR! It'll make

Yet I still see lots of code in that PR like:

if defined(GDAL_VERSION_NUM) && GDAL_VERSION_NUM >= GDAL_COMPUTE_VERSION(2,0,0)

That's what I'm referring to. All this conditional code needs removal
(unless it's testing for something in GDAL > 2.0 ).

Mosty in the static functions
- QgsOgrProviderUtils, mostly with a switch

and a few elsewhere.

There are also few for much older versions
#if defined(GDAL_VERSION_NUM) && GDAL_VERSION_NUM >= 1400

They are easy to remove.

There is one (at least) that must remain

#if defined(GDAL_COMPUTE_VERSION) && GDAL_VERSION_NUM >=
GDAL_COMPUTE_VERSION(2,1,2)

I count 20, beforehand there were many more.

There also other classes sped around the project that uses OGR
- some of which also have these

Ok - I find this thread very confusing. Does this acknowledgement mean
that you WILL remove these ifdefs from the PR?

Here's the thing: I *want* your work to land in QGIS. It's important
stuff, and needs to be addressed. But in its current form it won't be
merged - it's been independently reviewed by two core developers who
have both requested changes. I hate to see all this effort you've put
in wasted, but you need to rework your approach before this can be
merged.

Yesterday I got QGIS 3 working on my machine.
So now I can work on this version.

In the last 3 months on a new version of the Georefencer:

https://github.com/mj10777/QGIS/wiki/QGIS-Enhancement:-Georeferencer

for which I have applied a grant for.

This needs a working gdal 2, so before I can start the port of the
Georeferencer to QGIS 3 (where I assume that there will be API changes to
deal with), this matter needs to be resolve - so I will attempt to merge
the 2.

Any idea of any api changes in QgsOgrProvider?

A pity that the needed changes were not done in 2015 when first reported,
during the gdal 2 beta phase.

This is already being done in my version.

Setting the id to -1 could tell the QgsOgrProvider that the layername is
unique
- and remove the need of the extra parameter

id >= 0 would tell QgsOgrProvider that the id MUST be used, because there
are duplicate layernames.

The id and layername will be stored (as it was before) in the URI/Project.

Since at this point it is known that the values are valid
- no further checks are needed and can be opened directly

Can we agree on this?
Anything else still open?

Hi Nyall,
Thanks for your valuable reply.
I will try to complete the project write-up(1-2 pages and with some
additional features) within 2 days.

Thanks & Regards,

>From a robustness point of view, I think we should be robust to layerid being absent from the 
URI (and I'd prefer that when we generate URI, we don't set layerId = -1 but just remove it) 
since URIs can also been built by users and not only through the UI. We shoud also be robust 
to layername from being absent as well, as done currently.

So if both a layerid and layername, you would prever layerid over layername ? So the reverse 
of
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L3494 ?

Deciding which one is prioritary will always been a matter of arbitrary taste, but as there's 
currently a logic, I'd prefer we keep it as much as possible.

> The id and layername will be stored (as it was before) in the URI/Project.

subLayers() should return both layerid (potentially set to -1 if there's no issue of unicity) and 
layername as it does currently, but when generating a URI, it should only set one of them :
* if subLayers() returned layerId >=0 , use it in the URI
* otherwise use layerName.

To solve the issue of several geometry fields we also need a (optional) parameter with the 
geometry column name.

Hello,

Could you work like we do for QEP? i.e Write the text in a ticket, ask for 
comment and label it as finished (or to be integrated in the documentation).

I will be happy to do it (assign the ticket to me) if everybody agree with 
this process!

Pros:
* lower the barrier
* easy to comment for a (small) chapter even if this is better and easier in a 
PR for bigger chapter though
* easy also to improve some part of an existing chapter (typos, missing 
informations)

Cons:
* make sure to finalized it :)

Sorry for the noise, reading again the thread, my previous email is not 
relevant for such issue. I don't think we will add a chapter how to build QGIS 
from scratch.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Broken sip composer item subclassing in 2.18
Message-ID: <CAB28Asg7=y0Ri9ADQP+0NhAvbDOwfpRWbWffyLGcDpMT4Ar97Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I noticed today that composer item subclassing seems broken in 2.18.4 (on
linux, untested on other platforms). If I enter something like:

iface.activeComposers()[0].items()

I see mostly QgsComposerItem items, rather then the correct subclasses.
It's random though, and sometimes the correct item type is returned.

Is anyone else experiencing this? I'm stumped with this - I can't see any
related changes in the code, and the generated cpp looks fine to me.

no, the other way around

Default: layername, only when a duplicate layername exists, should the id
be used
Checking for duplicate names is done in subLayers()
- if layername is unique, id will be set to -1 and sent to QgsOgrProvider

QgsOgrProvider would
- use GDALDatasetGetLayer if id >= 0
otherwise
- use GDALDatasetGetLayerByName

To solve the issue of several geometry fields we also need a (optional)
> parameter with the geometry column name.


subLayers() will send the layer name in the 'table_name(field_name)' format

It was only with gdal 1 that GDALDatasetGetLayerByName could not use that
format.
That means the 'table_name(field_name)' format can always be used.

Since it is not a mandatory parameter inside QgsOgrProvider where the
string is being parsed, the default value of -1 will be used.
- so there is no need to store a -1 value in the project.

> We shoud also be robust
> to layername from being absent as well, as done currently.

Yes, also not a mandatory parameter
- at the moment QgisApp::askUserForOGRSublayers removes the layername sent
by, so everything also works without a layername  being sent.

I have started a manual merge into the QGIS 3 version, making sure that the
many changes are not disturbed.

Also all gdal 1 switches and the '>= GDAL_COMPUTE_VERSION(2,0,0)' will be
removed.

So I hope to offer a QGIS 3 pull request in the next few days.

---
I would also like to adapt QgsOgrProvider::ogrWkbGeometryTypeName
- to use QgsWkbTypes::displayString first
and only when not found to check for geometry types not supported by qgis
when needed.

ogrWkbGeometryTypeFromName must remain, since there is no corresponding
function in QgsWkbTypes.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding default OSM backround maps
Message-ID: <31b81df0-3712-c9c4-c09f-82e11d3b74bd@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
we have been exploring the possibility of adding default XYZ maps to
QGIS, so to make life far easier for users.
The good news is that the OSM board is quite positive about this.
The not-so-good news is that their (I believe reasonable) requirements
imply some more development from our side.
Is anyone interested in taking this?
Requirements below.
All the best.
===

1. You seem to be using an user agent of "Mozilla/5.0 QGIS/2.18.3". We
strongly recommend that you don't pretend to be a browser by adding the
"Mozilla" bit. OpenStreetMap sees increasing traffic from "fake" user
agents, and it is likely that we will penalise user agents like that at
some point in the future - meaning tiles will still be served, but
slower than to "honest" user agents that don't pretend to be a browser
when they are not. We understand that this is difficult terrain and that
other data sources might actually *require* that you pretend to be a
browser - perhaps per-datasource overrides of the user agent are a
possibility.

2. As you know, OpenStreetMap thrives on contributions by mappers, and
one of the main reasons we make our tiles freely available is the hope
of attracting new contributors. It would be nice if QGIS could do its
part to help us here, by making their users aware that OSM is open for
everyone to contribute. Perhaps a link to
http://www.openstreetmap.org/fixthemap can be placed somewhere in the
layer description or something.

3. Our data is licensed under ODbL 1.0, and our map tiles are CC-BY-SA
2.0. The latter could change at any time; the former is
relatively constant.

The legal consequences of this situation for your users are:

* If they publish an image in which our tiles are visible, they must
attribute OpenStreetMap as the source, and specify that the map image is
CC-BY-SA 2.0, and specify that the data behind it is ODbL 1.0. All these
requirements can be fulfilled in one go by linking to
www.openstreetmap.org/copyright but there is no legal requirement to
link to that page.

* Everyone is allowed to create derivatives of OpenStreetMap data - for
example by tracing features on the OSM tiles - and freely distribute
them. Such derived datasets, unless they are "insubstantial"
(https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence/Community_Guidelines/Substantial_-_Guideline)
inherit the ODbL license and must, when publicly used, on request be
made available under ODbL.

4. If the load coming from QGIS should be unexpectedly high and impact
our service performance, there might come a time where we'd have to
throttle or even switch off this access. You should have some mechanism
or plan that deals with that to avoid frustration among your user base -
maybe a mechanism where QGIS installations request updated tile sources
from a central service so you could notify them of the OSM tiles not
being available (or being available elsewhere) should the need arise.

table_name(field_name) is only valid as a OGR layer name for the SQLite driver and this is a 
legacy behaviour of the GDAL 1 era. That will *not* work for other formats that can have 
multiple geometry fields, like GML.

We could potentially use it as a QGIS layername, but it would probably be cleaner to have a 
dedicated URI parameter for the geometry column name. Anyway at the OGR API level, I 
reiterate that we must have a separate OGR layer name (for GetLayerByname()) and OGR 
geometry field name (for GetGeomFieldIndex())

Could you send me such a GML to test this?
Have you ever seen or have a GML with a duplicate layer-name?

Sure you'll find attached such a .gml and the corresponding .xsd

No, that's not possible given how the GML format&driver work.

Hi all,


Another query, I have recently shifted to QGIS from ArcGIS and am looking for some help/pointers with the following:

Does QGIS have a method by which I can specify a lat-lon coordinate (or a utm x,y coordinates, coordinate system not imp), and get all features that lie within a certain radius of this point?

I have used the measure tool to draw a line and expand my radius out to the end of the line but looking a more accurate, efficient way of doing it.

Regards,

Finbar

hi Finbar,
you could use select by expression and use geometry functions available in the Expresions dialog to create the readius (e.g. buffering the point, created ba geometry_from_text). If you need thisvery often, you could create a simple model with the preocessing plugin doing what i described.

hi Finbar,
you could use select by expression and use geometry functions available in the Expresions dialog to create the readius (e.g. buffering the point, created ba geometry_from_text). If you need thisvery often, you could create a simple model with the preocessing plugin doing what i described.

Hi all,


Another query, I have recently shifted to QGIS from ArcGIS and am looking for some help/pointers with the following:

Does QGIS have a method by which I can specify a lat-lon coordinate (or a utm x,y coordinates, coordinate system not imp), and get all features that lie within a certain radius of this point?

I have used the measure tool to draw a line and expand my radius out to the end of the line but looking a more accurate, efficient way of doing it.

Regards,

Finbar

amazingly in processing we don't have an easy/obvious (at least for me) way to

Hi Finbar,

Expresions are using SQL (and usually are the part after the "WHERE". If you have a point layer (in a metric KBS) you could use "Select by Expression" from Menu -> View -> Select and put in

intersects( $geometry, buffer( geom_from_wkt( 'POINT(410611 5315209)'), 3000))

This selects all onjects of the active layer that are within a 3000m Buffer (=circle) around the point 410611 5315209

No python programming needed!

Marco

And by the way: QGIS has a really great documentation:

Marco,

I actually noticed that, I made a mistake with how I done this analysis before.

I have set the ‘CRS of the Project from Layer’ and this seems to have given the correct answer.

Hi Finbar,

Expresions are using SQL (and usually are the part after the "WHERE". If you have a point layer (in a metric KBS) you could use "Select by Expression" from Menu -> View -> Select and put in

intersects( $geometry, buffer( geom_from_wkt( 'POINT(410611 5315209)'), 3000))

This selects all onjects of the active layer that are within a 3000m Buffer (=circle) around the point 410611 5315209

No python programming needed!

And by the way: QGIS has a really great documentation:

Hi Marco,

Thanks for the quick response! Would you have an example of python code I would put in the expression?

This is an area I will need to upskill on.

Subject: Re: [Qgis-developer] Select by Radius

hi Finbar,
you could use select by expression and use geometry functions available in the Expresions dialog to create the readius (e.g. buffering the point, created ba geometry_from_text). If you need thisvery often, you could create a simple model with the preocessing plugin doing what i described.

Hi all,


Another query, I have recently shifted to QGIS from ArcGIS and am looking for some help/pointers with the following:

Does QGIS have a method by which I can specify a lat-lon coordinate (or a utm x,y coordinates, coordinate system not imp), and get all features that lie within a certain radius of this point?

I have used the measure tool to draw a line and expand my radius out to the end of the line but looking a more accurate, efficient way of doing it.

Regards,

Finbar

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding default OSM backround maps

Hi Paolo,

I can help on this.

1. The UserAgent is already a configurable feature in QGIS (under
Options/Network). Any user can change it, but we can propose another
default value.

2. The QGIS community is very much aware of OpenStreetMap. If we really
need to make our users more aware, does it make sense to add a new
button to QGIS to report map errors? (context dependent, when the
OpenStreetMap layer is shown) It would have the same functionality of
the notes in OpenStreetMap web interface.

3.1 On the "add layer" dialog, we can show the OpenStreetMap url (which
might change over time) and licenses (for data and tiles) taken from
settings or an (external) resource. We can make this not hard coded, to
be modified easily, without upgrading QGIS. We can also check if the
service is enabled for us, before allow users to add that layer (related
with 4.).

3.2 When the tiles are used in the composer or on the web client, we can
not enforce an attribution string. We might add or suggest it, but users
should be free the create and edit the attributions. It the
responsibility of the user, not a QGIS responsibility.

4. We have to handle when tiles are not loading, either because there
are network problems, server busy, etc. We can customize the user's
feedback regarding the load of the default OpenStreetMap tiles. But we
definitely need to know formally when they shut our access down. This is
related with 3.1 issue. If the access is disabled, we can also disable
adding default OpenStreetMap tiles option.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Hi Tim, Andreas, et al.,

Thank you for the quick replies and support. I will submit a "State of
QGIS" talk today. Regardless of whether it is accepted, I will probably be
in attendance at FOSS4G Boston.

Note that I intend this talk to be completely vetted by the community. I
will be posting to the dev list with requests for comments, opinions and
suggestions on content. While I will be working on this talk at work
(assuming it is accepted), it will purely be about and for the community's
efforts, with absolutely no content related to my employer, excepting to
thank them for supporting my attendance to the event.

I could get someone from work to help with the talk, or be a backup;
though, I would definitely prefer someone from the QGIS dev community to
help in this regard, ideally someone who does not also work for my employer.

Anyone attending FOSS4G Boston and willing to help out? If so, I need to
know today. Thanks.

Regards,

I'd be happy to help compiling your slides / reviewing them etc. I guess Kurt Menke might be going along - you might want to touch base with him to hear if he is going - he isn't a developer but he is very up to speed with QGIS and the QGIS community activities. Hopefully anyone else on the dev list who is going will pipe up and pitch in if they can.

Hi

Its really great to see this Paolo. I think the OSM requests all sound reasonable and if we do start representing a high load on their servers we could consider adding a caching proxy between QGIS clients and OSM tile server so that we don't hit their servers too hard.

One thing that I would suggest is that we do not use the default tile renders for OSM - it would be much nicer to provide something 'consumer' orientated rather than the OSM renders which are great for visualizing a broad range of OSM feature types but not IMHO very nice looking cartography. Reaching out to the folks at http://giscience.uni-hd.de <http://giscience.uni-hd.de/> to see if we can use their tile renders might provide a nicer out of the box experience for our users. Of course we would still acknowledge OSM as the source of the data and giscience as source of the renders. Here is an example of their render:

http://korona.geog.uni-heidelberg.de <http://korona.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/>

Regards

Tim

Good  - I think it will get outdated quickly and history shows that such content does not get well maintained. If we had to do anything along these lines, it could be to have a small chapter which lists all the QGIS dependencies along with a pointer to the upstream build instructions for each dependency. At least that should be more easily maintained and does not duplicate effort from upstream projects.

John have you considered just running QGIS in docker - its probably a much easier approach than the method you have embarked upon...

Yes I have - I was trying to propose that it is boiled down to a simple table on a single page with just:

Dependency | Notes
----------------- | ----------
[Qt5](https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_5_from_Git) | Qt5 is a graphical toolkit and collection of utility classes.
etc. | etc.

repository links back to itself and the Tracker goes to the home page for
documentation. As far as I can tell there is no contact information or the
ability to report bugs or give suggestions. I thought that both of these
were to be a part of the information the plugin provides. At any rate it
would be useful if it were available. I would like to contact the developer.

Thanks,

Calvin

I think your question was directed to Mark Johnson, not to me? But since
you asked, I found the rational raised in this thread to be...stunningly
unconvincing!:

The reason documentation gets outdated is typically because of a lack
of maintainers (possibly related to lack of visibility), and also an
overly high bar to editing it. A wiki is generally the lowest bar
possible. If the problem is information getting outdated quickly,
moving away from a wiki seems a step in the wrong direction, not the
right one.

I'm not very familiar with translation issues, but my understanding is
they aren't usually strictly format-dependent. (But I should
acknowledge my deep biases as an English speaker.)

I'm not sure why a streamlined website process ought to have
any bearing on the quality or accessibility of documentation. This
seems a second-class issue.

I'm also not sure I understand this or why it is important for
documentation; or more important than good documentatoin.

Yes, this I understand; and this is the constant tension between
lowering the barrier of entry far enough to make it easy for casual
contributors to crowdsource information, and lowering it too far to
make it too easy for spammers. Except it seems like the osgeo wiki
has finally evolved a fairly effective solution (modulo the fact that
it's awful hard to get a mantra and credentials!).

Continuous testing is super-helpful for code. It's nice for
documentation, but not really in the same way. I'd much rather have
good documentation than continuously-tested documentation.

Maybe that's an artificial tradeoff and we can have both.
But I'm not convinced (not that I need to be; again, I'm new here and
so far mostly send long emails.)

It sounds great, does it work?  I can suggest a reason for building from 
scratch - one can compile to take advantage of multiple cores rather 
than assume everyone likes slow.

I looked at these notes and the first thing I noticed was PyQt5 Version 
5.8.1.  Qt5.8.1 requires a change in Unicode version on Ubuntu 17.04 - 
as I discovered - and it didn't appear that simple to implement.

I don't believe that QGIS built using Qt5.7.1 works with PyQt5 Version 
5.8.1 - see output below, what am I missing?

Also, I question further development using WebKit when Qt has moved to 
WebEngine.  Wouldn't adopting WebEngine make sense or at least present 
why it isn't.

On Ubuntu 17.04, which is based on Qt5.7.1, output from 
`./output/bin/qgis`

`Couldn't load PyQt.
Python support will be disabled. (a really big deal)

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "", line 1, in
ImportError: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt5Core.so.5: version `Qt_5.8'

There's been quite a lot of discussion on the WebKit/WebEngine issue already
on the list. Bottom line - from memory WebEngine does not yet compare to
WebKit in functionality. I stand to be corrected.

While I agree with the principal that OSM's default stylesheet is not
suitable as a basemap, there are several issues your proposal raises:

1. Using OSM's tileservers is more likely to be resilient and unchanging
than another provider

2. OSM itself has authority and kudos, which could be good to associate
ourselves with

3. The style is more familiar, and is more likely to meet users'
expectations

4. Using another provider of course means starting new negotiations

5. Using OSM themselves carries the lowest risk (in my opinion) of a
licensing change like the MapQuest one which quite recently affected many,
many published webmaps

In other words, I think we need OSM first and foremost, and can then look to
ask other providers whose styles are likely to prove more useful
cartographically.

As Tom has said, WebEngine isn't a suitable replacement. It's a very,
*very* cut down version of QWebKit which lacks many of the methods we
require.

Until the Qt WebEngine backend is brought up to feature parity with
QWebKit we won't be porting -- it's just not possible to do.

Tim,

-1 to use OSM-based XYZ tile server that doesn't update its dataset on a
regular basis (+/- weekly). While there are nicer styles that OSM's default
one, one of the fundamental dynamic of OSM is the ability to update / add
spatial data and see those updates reflected on tiles immediately. We
should both respect and benefit from that :)

For e.g., the beautiful style on the link you provided uses a 10-month old
OSM dataset. It's a significant data gap.

Agreed, thanks to all for the suggestion.
IMHO OSM could be a first, then it should be easy to add new ones.
All the best.

Thanks Calvin for pointing this out. We made code repo and bugtracker a
requirement rather recently, so old plugin have still to be updated.
I'm contacting the author to ask him to fix this.
All the best.

Yep - that's it. What a horrible bug. At least it's not our fault...
but still, glad the Qt5 builds are usable!


Hi Nyall,
I'm not sure I understand your last sentence. Does it work fine with QGIS
Master (Qt5 and the rest)?

Hi John,

Documentation really is the way to go when it comes down to the build
software. Work in this area is very much appreciated!

The basic requirement for documentation is, that it's kept up-to-date,
maintained and concise.

Documenting the build process needs to take care of

* an update on any of the dependencies might trigger problems on
  other dependencies. updates on dependencies land all the time.

* different systems already ship different dependencies which require
  different measures when building other dependencies. this leads to a
  complex mix of system and self-compiled dependencies.

So we have two variables in here (variety of systems, changing library
versions) that lead to a huge matrix of possible combinations. Combine
that with the fact that both change over time. In my humble opinion,
this makes it a humongous task to properly maintain.

Normally, the way is that every project maintains the build steps for
their own software and provides a list of dependencies. That's what we
try to do here:
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.html


I think it's best to provide information through inofficial channels

 * Set of scripts (for some preconditions)
 * Blog post written for one specific system at one point in time
   (documentation of what worked for someone)
 * External community wiki
   (that might be made official if it proves to be good enough)


What I see as the main risk for the project itself by starting an
official wiki for this purpose is that the information outdates quickly
and people blame "us" for inappropriate information. Unless there is
evidence that a wiki (for this or other purposes) can be maintained
better now than some years ago, I think this information can be very
well kept outside of the official sources.

Just my 2 cents
Matthias

INSTALL.html (which is generated from txt2tags markup) is also versioned so you are more or less guaranteed to have a working configuration based on the code you have checked out.

John the points you raised about wikis being easy to edit etc. are all good points. Speaking from hard earned experience here though, the 'old' QGIS wiki over 12 or so years became such a hodge podge of useful and unusable information that it because a large pain point in trying to find trustworthy information. Having formally curated documents, while making it harder to edit (which we would like to fix) emphasizes quality over quantity. Richard has been researching ways to use Markdown for the docs in sphinx so that content can be edited directly in GitHub but that is not something usable ye, and I am not sure if he is still actively working on it.

Regards

Tim

(Answering for Nyall :-P) I believe the issue only affects Qt4 based builds.

I have added a new page called 'Starting QGIS3 as seen from lddtree.sh'

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/wiki/QGIS3-lddtree-sh

As is often the case, complex Applications often fail for many different
reasons.
This page show what steps where undertaken to resolve these problems.

lddtree.sh is a forked version of the original lddtree that, for me, brings
better result. (source and download link are supplied on that page).

Here, in this case, it is important to check if both QGIS3 and
PyQt5/QtCore.so use the same libQt5Core.so.5
- I believe it is save to assume that both MUST use the same QT5 Version,
since QtCore.so is a (I believe) a function interface between python3 and
libQt5Core

The page shows the result of both QGIS3 and PyQt5/QtCore.so (both of which
work correctly) as an comparison.

In this case, I think, the cause of the problem is more likly to be that:
-> /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt5Core.so.5
--> does not exsit on your system

For QGIS-3 docs I want to move to python3/latest sphinx, which can also
build *.md pages. Drawback is that you cannot do any 'real' referencing
to other pages in those, but we can add/build them, and I'm not sure how
the latexpdf builder is affected.
Another wish here, is to make the building easier (no Make magic,
vanilla sphinx as much as possible). It is easier nowadays, because the
sphinx translation tools even have scripts to update transifex etc

But... still wanting this. But have to change the build proces... in Essen?

Regards,

Richard

ps I agree with Matthias, that it is pretty hard to create documentation
for ALL different configuration/version. Just ask on
mailinglist/irc/gitter if you have problems building. And IF you
succeeded(!), do a blogpost on your personal page. Eg, I had to build on
CentOS7 with Oracle some time ago:

Hi Mark,

if you insist ( and I see you do :-) ):

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/wiki/Building-QT-5-from-scratch

Then PLEASE create a system in which you make it clear
WHICH version of QGIS you are trying to build on
WHAT version of Linux/Ubuntu
on WHICH Qt version (and other lib versions)

(so others can provide instructions for other versions/distro-version)

I'm with Matthias
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2017-March/047756.html

Unless you are sure you will keep this uptodate I'm not sure it has any
value for other developers to have it on the our QGIS-Documentation
wiki. Your hard work now, will be outdated within 6 months, I'm afraid.
It will only be 'historical' knowledge then...

Sorry to be harsh, but it is much easier to build QGIS with the lib
versions of your own distro.

What about forking QGIS-Documentation to your own repo, and put this in
your Wiki there? We can even blog about it and point to the instructions?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

/me thinking we should never had opened the wiki on the repo :-(

And if your blog supports RSS, and you can tag the post appropriately, get
your description syndicated via the QGIS planet blog. That's the best of
both worlds - you'll get to a much wider audience of QGIS users than you can
with just your own site, but it is still clear that it is third-party
content, not written/maintained by QGIS (ie PSC).

Just before your note came I had just finished adding an extra heading on
each page with the library name and version.

In the case of Qgis an extra 'Qgis 2.99 master (as of 2017-03-20)'
- which is the first thing that will be outdated

The original tenor of this thread was were one could place such experiences
in building the project, and the first place they will look for this is the
project site itself.

Being very version dependent, placing it slightly outside the development
documentation (which I assume has more to do with the project API), seems
to me wiser.

Most of the pages were written during this process, that is now completed.
That is why, before continuing, went though the pages, cleaning this up and
adding a more descriptive heading.

Your hard work now, will be outdated within 6 months, I'm afraid.
> It will only be 'historical' knowledge then...

the methods described how to resolve problems that occurred, in many cases,
will not be historical.
The last page added today, resolving specific problems, will defiantly be
valid for many years to come.

As you have quoted, if it is not desired, I'll stop.

Mark

For context, I've only been lurking and intend to use QGIS when I get
time.  I have been an OSM mapper for 8 years.

OSM data is freely usable, but there is a tile usage policy for the OSM
Foundation's servers:

  https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/

According to the policy, QGIS would probably need permission to offer
tiles from OSM servers.  The server admins might well be ok with this --
generally cooperation among Open Data and Free Software is great -- but
they are trying to serve tiles to the world without a big budget.

One of the guidelines is about user agent, which is aimed at less
configurable programs, to be able to identify and/or block things that
use too much server capacity.  So the notion of easily user-configure
UserAgent string sent to OSM tileservers should probably be discussed
with the OSM server admins.  I find configuration here strange; I would
expect the UserAgent string to be something that just looks like "QGIS
2.18".   But probably I have misunderstood.

Note that bulk downloading of tiles is not allowed.  If they are loaded
only when the user pans/zooms, that's ok.  But you can't prefetch a
large area to make that work faster or offline.  (See local rendering
commenta at the end.)

Another part of the usage policy is caching.  Clients must cache tiles
for at least 7 days by default.

I'm unclear if this discussion is only about using OSM as a base layer
within QGIS, or also extends to publishing created maps on the web such
that web users would load tiles.  Generally, OSM tileservers are
intended to support OSM itself, and for low-usage applications.  So it
might be that for publishing it would be good to ask people to check
that they've read the tile usage policy.

Yes, but as a mapper I would really like to see people sign up for an
account and have non-anonymous notes.  It's not that I need to know
their True Name, but two other things:

  An anonymous note cannot be used as the basis for editing, only to go
  check yourself, because the anonymous note writer has not necessarily
  agreed to the contributor terms and we don't know where the info came
  from (could be copied from another map).

  You can't ask for clarification.

Still, anonymous notes are useful, if one is local enough to be going by
or make a small detour at some point, or if the issue can be confirmed
by acceptably-licensed sources.

I am guessing you have some new-layer database which is kept fresh, and
enabling QGIS as a project to disable/change the OSM layer if there are
issues sounds good.  (I realize nothing stops anyone from doing
anything, but the point is to be able to protect OSM servers from large
numbers of users of a program who did not actually evaluate the
decision.)

Legally, you may well be right.

Socially, if you have a facility to add OSM, then by default, adequate
attribution should be added, so that someone who does not understand how
to set up attribution or does not understand that they must will end up
doing thte right thing.

It's fairly frequent for OSM people to come across unattributed use and
ask for correction.  So I think the OSM community would appreciate it if
by default this came out right.  Not adding attribution by default is
sort of like offering to download a copy of QGIS'S source code with all
the copyright statements removed :-)

The fact that someone can remove it intentionally is not your
fault/problem.

Another thing to consider is including a renderer and having the user
download an extract.  viking (a less-than-GIS GPX/map viewer) has
support for this as well as using OSM tiles:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/viking/

But compared to QGIS, almost no one uses viking.

-1 to load any background map by default. Think about offline users
and users with limited internet connections. Loading background map
may be not acceptable for them

Also why load map? We can just add some default servers to the
"Add XYZ layer" dialog like we already have in WMS/WFS dialogs.
This will be consistent with other parts of QGIS. Otherwise someone
may complain that they want to load not OSM but something else,
e.g. data from other OGC service.

If we decide to go that way (allow loading background map) this map
should be configurable and not limited to XYZ services.

Just my 2c.

Well I think we can have the best of both worlds:

- make a default background map optional
- let the user choose their own XYZ map in favour of the default OSM XYZ we provide

That is what Paolo has been discussing with OSM.

It would be a fully-featured layer within QGIS, which users could publish.

Yes, we would add the approved attribution by default.

Tobias,

Thank you for that suggestion. I am now using the geographiclib routines in
Shape Tools' XY to Line routine that was released today. I am still
including Great Circle as an option and if you zoom in you can see the
differences.

All the best,

Calvin

I assume that these errors came from QGIS3-Dialog: correct?
That would mean that QGIS3 has found all of the libQt5* it needs
- and thus all paths are correct
The used python3 calls
- /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/PyQt5/QtCore.so

so the pythonpath should also be correctly set.

So the question is why python3 cannot find them.

What does

ldd /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/PyQt5/QtCore.so | grep libQt5

return?

The result should look similer to the result shown here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/wiki/QGIS3-lddtree-sh#pyqt5_fails

and there should be no 'not found' messages.

Printing out the PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PYTHONPATH,  and PYTHONHOME, might
also be helpful.

echo $PATH;
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH;
echo $PYTHONPATH;
echo $PYTHONHOME;

Hi all,
sorry I was unclear: we are not talking of adding a background map by
default (I agree with Alex that this would cause trouble), but to add it
in the Tiled server (XYZ) as a default entry, to make it easy for users
to add it.
Thanks for helping me clarifying.
All the best.

Message-ID: <25fa958b-46a0-1020-36e3-c79cc4125b56@opengis.ch>

Dear devs,

Travis introduced a new feature called "auto cancellation" which will
automatically cancel any unstarted jobs on new builds. This saves
resources if someone is faster with pushing updates on a branch than
travis is with starting its tests.

I just enabled this feature for pull requests. For master I left it
turned off, given that this situation does not happen that often there
and on the other hand it's interesting to see which commit introduced a
problem.

The following blog post outlines the feature in more detail:

https://blog.travis-ci.com/2017-03-22-introducing-auto-cancellation

Cheers
Matthias

Message-ID: <a852a3e5-3c69-d32c-3f44-3df76126db37@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I would like to have the manuals for the testing version. PDFs are
available, html apparently not. Is this confirmed? Wouldn't it be good
to add these too?
Then I resolved to compiling it myself, and I discovered that they do
not compile under Python 3:

RuntimeError: Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was
configured to use ASCII as encoding for the environment.  Either run
this under Python 2 or consult http://click.pocoo.org/python3/ for
mitigation steps.

I assume this should be ported to Py3, and only the usual lack of time
prevents this, correct? Or there are other stumbling blocks?

Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] API: how to get URL of WMS layer if different to
	layer.source()
Message-ID: <1490266966721-5313836.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

I've not come across this before, but a user has connected to a WMS and
added a layer. layer.source() returns the URL used *in the WMS connection*:

http://geomap.reteunitaria.piemonte.it/WEBCAT/CAPABILITIES/wms_coto_ortofoto_1979.xml

However, to get that WMS layer to appear in a webmap, I have to use the URL
which WMS GetCapabilities returns for that layer, which is different:

http://geomap.reteunitaria.piemonte.it/mapproxy/service?

So my question is, can I retrieve that second URL via the QGIS API? How does
QGIS do it itself?

Alternatively, is is possible that the user is in error in having used the
address he did to connect to the WMS?

Hoping I'm not facing the same issue I've had before: no Python bindings for
the WMS provider (or for any provider), but still thought I'd ask.

Thanks

Tom

Hey Larry,

I have some slides from my talk just recently in New Zealand if you want to
use some of it.  The slide deck uses the new logo and style guide which
looks pretty good.

You can find the slides here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/85jxstidntb8e8t/QGIS%20NZ%20-%202017.pptx?dl=0


Regards,
Nathan

Hi all,

I have generated an Atlas Map within QGIS. I am wondering if there is any way this can be exported so that an end user can navigate between the different pages, rather than just exporting as separate pdf pages.

Hi all,
I'm consistently getting a crash when zooming in, both with qgis 2.14.11
and with 2.18.4, with a particular project. It does not happen with
others. When loading layers individually, it also does not crash.
Apparently therefore the issue is related to styling.
The same project was working well prieviously.
Anyone has similar issues?
Thanks.

Yesterday, there was somebody too on the userlist:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2017-March/039520.html

I asked him to sent a project+data to be able to reproduce, he responded
to me privately, that the same project on other machines worked, and
recreating the project also did.

Which makes yours a valid conclusion: something in the project crashes...
But only to be tested by either providing project+data+steps I think.
Or maybe providing a gdb stacktrace?

Richard

Thanks Richard for confirming.
My data are big, so it will be difficult to send them. I'll try to
reduce the project to the bare minimum to reproduce the crash.
I also tried gdb, but it does not find the symbols:
"/usr/bin/qgis": not in executable format: File format not recognized
all the best.

Hey Paolo,

Any chance to get a backtrace?
This is always the number one resource for pointers to solutions with
crashes.

Cheers

OK, so I found that the crash depends on a single PostGIS point layer in
EPSG:4326. When the project is reprojected to EPSG:3857, QGIS reliably
crashes when zoomed deeper than 1:50.000.
When OTF is off, no issue. Same layer, saved as shp in the same
situation does not crash. I suspect this has to do to the incorrect
extent of the geom:
Extent:
-inf, -inf - -10.56548, 9.94114
I understand why QGIS has trouble in reprojecting it, but a crash is
always bad.
BTW: how do I fix the extent of the PostGIS table?
All the best.

have you *removed* all 3rd party plugins and tested? there are plugins
that are (more or less) known to have very bad influence on QGIS
usability even if only disabled.

cheers!

Hi Paolo,

a backtrace would still help a LOT more. Can you provide one?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] overload closeEvent in AlgorithmDialog.py
Message-ID: <1c9d634b-f21d-7832-6b45-08a94b08eaca@yahoo.it>

Dear (processing) developers,

for my plugin (IO Geopaparazzi), I need to stop the execution of an 
external thread when the user presses the X button of the form.

I though to overload the closeEvent in this way:

from processing.gui.AlgorithmDialog import AlgorithmDialog

[omitted]

class ExportTilesAlgorithm(GeoAlgorithm):

     [omitted]

     # get the AlgorithmDialog dialog object and overload the closeEvent
     AlgorithmDialog.closeEvent = self.closeEvent

     [omitted]

     def closeEvent(self, evt):
        # necessary to close the thread before it is finished
        self.workThread.stop()

it works perfectly but I'm not sure that it will not induce anomalous 
behaviours in other geoalgorithms as the original function is (from 
AlgorithmDialog.py) :

def closeEvent(self, evt):
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().layerWasAdded.disconnect(self.mainWidget.layerAdded)
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().layersWillBeRemoved.disconnect(self.mainWidget.layersWillBeRemoved)
         super(AlgorithmDialog, self).closeEvent(evt)

Any suggestions?

Thank you

enrico

Message-ID: <F44CA5E4-838C-4E36-918B-DA1B3260EF70@kartoza.com>

Hi All

I am getting a crash on master on MacOS every time I press OK in the layer properties dialog for any vector layer. Seems like the destructor of QgsCodeEditor - can anyone replicate this or suggest a possible fix? Traceback below:

Regards

Tim

Dear List,

Does anybody here have some experience with making QGIS work with
(Geo)Django ?

I would love to be able to make them communicate, as QGIS is the interface
of choice to do complex work on geometries and Django is perfect to quickly
setup a complete endpoint with user management, model logic and web
administration interface.

I see two approches :
- Using Django REST framework to create a REST endpoint - but is there a
way to consume REST endpoints in QGIS ?
- Developing a WFST module for Django, for which there seem to be some work
done [1] for the non-transactionnal part.

I just wanted to ask before reinventing the wheel !

Bests,

Olivier

Hi,

It really depends on what you want to achieve, but the server component of
QGIS has Python bindings, so you might want to explore the opportunity to
route the calls from Django to a Python-wrapped QGIS Server to generate an
OGC response.


 A very old example can be found here:

Hi Olivier
Kartoza has been working on having geonode server running smoothly using
a qgis server in the background.

have a look at

I'm not seeing that here (latest everything). Looks like the editor is only
used for tool tip labels? I tried adding content there and still have not
seen a crash.

Btw, map tips don't seem to be working very well on macOS.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] overload closeEvent in AlgorithmDialog.py [CLOSED]
Message-ID: <f5af6a5c-ca26-35a5-8064-ffa83fc0cdfc@yahoo.it>

I found that the most convenient way is to create a custom 
"AlgorithmDialog" class where reimplement the closeEvent function. 
Custom dialog must be loaded implementing the getCustomParametersDialog 
in the custom geoalgorithm.

here the class:

class CustomAlgorithmDialog(AlgorithmDialog):
   def __init__(self, alg):
     AlgorithmDialog.__init__(self, alg)

   def closeEvent(self, evnt):
     # do something of 'extraordinary'
     print 'something'

     # call original function
     super(CustomAlgorithmDialog, self).closeEvent(evnt)

here the function to implement in the custom geoalgorithm:

def getCustomParametersDialog(self):
       return CustomAlgorithmDialog(self)

Nothing extraordinary, just to close the question.

Yeah it seems map tips are broken here too....can anyone confirm if it is a mac only issue? Looks like it is a general issue - the expression for the tip is just being displayed literally instead of being interpreted. e.g.:

Done:

I cannot distribute the original data in public, but can make it
available for testing.
The crash is very consistent.
Thanks for the help.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing UI looks strange
Message-ID: <2788fa47-c4a7-eedb-edc6-510fdd30eb56@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I noticed since a couple of days that the UI of Processing look like it
is not gridded (see attachment).

Is this something of my local machine?

Cheers

Matteo

I've seen similar crashes lately too. I thought it was limited to the
categoried renderer (hence https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4300),
but seems not from your backtrace.

Problem is that I can't reliably reproduce this. Sometimes things are
fine, sometimes crashes happen frequently. If you have a project you
can reliably reproduce this with can you send it through?

Hi Jonathan,

The problem you mentioned related to "style by category" in a specific
project [1] maybe related with this thread.

As far as I know, you didn't submit the bug report yet. Maybe the
problem was fixed with Nyall's PR [2], but it might help if you submit
the bug report along with your project file. If you can't share your
data publicly, add the bug report and then make the data available just
for the developers for testing upon request.

Regards,

Jorge

Message-ID: <b8953057-8411-07f2-8df3-2bf4454fd587@opengis.ch>

Hi all,

I uploaded a new plugin to the 3.0 repository some days ago and it
wouldn't show up in the plugin list. I first suspected something related
to min/max version but it turned out, that I had to add (at least one
of) the keys experimental and deprecated to make it be listed.

I remember that I was first asked to fill in some required fields at
some point (tracker, repository...) I wonder if these fields should also
go in there - or if they should really be made optional.

Thanks
Matthias

Hi Matthias

I'm not sure what you mean by
3.0 repo, but if it is the official repo both fields are optional according
to
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_
cookbook/plugins.html#plugin-metadata

Keep in mind that the xmls are cached and regenerated every 30 minutes.

If you still find an issue with that metadata please file a ticket and
attach the plugin.

Cheers

Hi Alessandro,

It didn't appear for more than 48 hours in the repository (for QGIS
master) with this file here:

https://github.com/opengisch/projectgenerator/blob/c23b3764704bcd0a73bf44f6a46c5d256f251dd9/projectgenerator/metadata.txt

It works now with this file here:

https://github.com/opengisch/projectgenerator/blob/b2e7f92a4dd6f21c12bceaafea36d496c9e3bbe4/projectgenerator/metadata.txt

The line-endings where also changed at some point (dos-endings with CRLF
to unix endings).

Matthias

I June last year a "work in progress" raster2pgsql gui plugin for QGIS was
discussed.

I managed to get it working a couple of times (but that involved a lot of
hacking!)

Has anyone looked at this further?  Anyone willing to have a stab at this
in the future?

Hi Pieter,
I'd warmly welcome this addition. IMHO it should be incorporated in DB
Manager however.
All the best, and thanks.

in my case this is not related to a project, but to a layer.
please let me know whether I should clarify better the description in
the ticket, and if you prefer to have access to data.

Hi Mark,

I've opened a few issues on the Wiki.  Some I've sorted but others are 
not so straight forward - but there might be a simple way I am unaware 
of.  The main issues are that not all of the instructions, when used on 
Ubuntu 17.04 and I would think Ubuntu xx.x, result in `make install` 
installing locally without further pre-make modifications.

It would help me if you could look at SIP because I had that working 
previously to the system folders but would like to use the proper local 
installation and there is no `share` folder or error.

`site-packages` folder for both python 3.4 and python 3.5 contain:
`sipconfig.py sipdistutils.py  sip.pyi  sip.so`

Python 3.5.3 is installed, perhaps that is the problem.

Also, Qt5.7.1 is in the system folders but obviously building from 
source ensures Qt5.8.1 isn't used as I built Qt5.7.1 from source.  It 
took about 1 hour.  It is in the local install folders.

Thanks for any help.

Please - the documentation team has requested that this work NOT be
done in the wiki. Their decision should be respected and you should
follow their guidelines.

You are of course free to create your own repo containing the wiki
with this information, but it DOES NOT belong on the QGIS
Documentation wiki.

Sorry, I didn't understand.  The instructions seemed very useful and a normal part of any application documentation.

The specific issue here isn't with the instructions themselves, but
with the wiki format. All official QGIS documentation needs to be
written in the .rst format and submitted via PRs to the documentation
repo. That's the process that the hard working documentation team has
developed over time to meet the complex needs of the project.

If you disagree and think that the wiki format is suitable, you need to:

1. Get involved in the team, learn the current process, and why it's
done like it is
2. Build influence with the documentation team by working with them
(yep - QGIS works on karma. Build your karma by contributing and
you'll get influence over the project.)
3. Discuss with the team and work with them to resolve the issues with
a wiki format.

Discussing in this current mailing list thread won't get anywhere. It
won't suddenly change the underlying issues which led the team to make
this decision.

I think another issue is that, while this wiki article is undoubtedly
extremely useful, it relates to a rather specific task - building in a
somewhat specific set of circumstances. Without similar instructions for
other, more common,  build scenarios, the article runs the risk of making
users think that this process is more broadly required. 

As everyone keeps saying, the content would be invaluable on a third-party
site, ie a blog post.

Hi Andreas,
I do not know much. You can probably have a look to the work of Minoru
Akagi, who started some early development on this.
However, I think some core devs may be interested in joining the discussion.
All the best.

Hello Enrico,

Do not change the common dialog closeEvent Method, you should subclass it.

class MyCustomDialog(AlgorithmDialog):

     ...

You can give a custom dialog to you algorithm using 
GeoAlgorithm.getCustomParametersDialog method.

class MyAlgorithm(GeoAlgorithm):

     ...

     def getCustomParametersDialog(self):

         return MyCustomDialog()


Do not forget to call the base AlgorithmDialog.closeEvent method in yours :

class MyCustomDialog(AlgorithmDialog):

     def closeEvent(self):

         super(MyCustomDialog, self).closeEvent()


This is the way to execute custom tasks in the closeEvent, I do not say 
that this the better way for your job.

I have been playing with Qt 3D module recently and submitted a grant
proposal for native 3D support in QGIS. Here is my repo with a simple

Dear All,

I am working on "implementation of algorithmic graph theory" from past 2
years +.

The following feature is not present in qgis and this features will
encourage many researchers to use qgis for experimental results.

1. Generating graph data-structure from OSM data for a selected polygon.
The data-structure can be

   - Edge stream representation
   - CSR(Compressed Sparse Row)(Popular one)
   - Adjacency list and matrix

If this kind of representation is available many graph algorithms will be
tested like A*, Dijkstra's, Ear decomposition etc

There can be variable components on each edge value like for some
algorithms each edge will have only one value like distance. for some
algorithms, each edge will have more than one value like [time, distance].

2. Finding k landmarks in input map is also a good problem.


Please let me know whether it's a good idea to work on.

Awaiting for a positive response.

Best Regards,
Harsh

Hi All,


this thread didn't get the traction I was hooping for, is this a
indication that is a general opinion that all the fixing effort should
be focused on qgis3 and not also on the next LTR?

during my cleanup a couple of weeks ago I clearly separated the
regressions affecting only master/qgis3 and the ones only affecting
2.18.*. In the second case I tried to my best to also try clearly
separate the ones we know since more or less long time and the ones
that have appeared after 2.14.

The following list is a sample of important things (to me) that have
regressed in 2.18 since 2.14:

16242 QGIS 2.18.4 saves always with absolute paths
15961 Escaping out of Dialog causes QGIS to crash
15803 2.18: Move Selection to Top not working in attribute table
15976 Attribute table: rows are switching when adding attributes
16302 Quick calculation bar causes QGIS crash when updating fields with aliases
16186 Broken Processing/GRASS tools under Windows > this is a
packaging issue and not a Processing one
15868 Frequent errors in DB Manager: `pyqtSignal must be bound to a
QObject, not 'PGVectorTable'`
16295 DB Manager: error importing data into GPKG connections
16296 Cannot use anymore d&d to import a layer from Spatialite in PostGIS
16297 (macOS) layers imported into a Spatialite Database with DB
manager are not recognized as spatial tables
15741 PostGIS issue when using 'Merge selected features' tool
(Geometry type does not match column type) > this is very bad as
causes data loss
15974 Rows of the attribute table seem to be duplicated when saving
edits in a shapefile

The developer meeting is in 1 month time. I would like to discuss
*now* a few cleanups so we don't have to do it in Essen and there I
can use my time to put them in action.

I assume that we are sticking with Redmine, correct? Here a list of
suggestions open for disccusion:

* the platform version is very old (2010), can we try upgrade it? If
someome provides me with a copy of the db I would give it a go on a
testbench
* remove all the projects others than "QGIS Application" from
http://hub.qgis.org/projects
* close all tickets that were last updated/commented more than... 2/3/4 years?


cheers!

Correct.  And the default is what Qt would use by default.  There might be
servers expecting a browser signature as well - so changing this default
is probably not good for everyone either.

It parses the capabilities and uses the url advertices for GetMap requests -
and we don't have an API to retrieve provider internals.

There also is an option to ignore that url and form the GetMap request using
the original URL and ignore what GetCapabilities reports.  Not useful in this
case - but something to consider for others.

Hi Giovanni

just a little correction that you can find in the same issue #15803

I'm working on that and I found that the error affects also master (qgis3)

if I'm not wrong the fix isn't complex and I'm preparing PR... this
fix has the same nature of the https://hub.qgis.org/issues/15976, the
reason that sortColumn() normally was set to it's initial value -1 in:
QSortFilterProxyModel but, somewere in qgis code (probaly in the init
of QgsMapLayerProxyModel)  already set a sortColumn => the normal flow
skip default call to sort(0) during first open.

I'll investigate 15976 too

the web using the geospatial component of the standardized X3D format. Code
and examples are on GitHub:

https://github.com/andreasplesch/QGIS-X3D-Processing

This effort is similar to QGIS2Threejs but is just starting out and
will use quite a different approach.

On the user list Paolo mentioned plans to use native qt5 3d facilities for
qgis3 as well (see below). Is there a repository or documentation to learn
more about this ? For example, it may be beneficial to use webGL enabled
webkit (perhaps in the processing results viewer).

Any pointer or other feedback is very welcome,

Andreas

Hi Andreas,
I do not know much. You can probably have a look to the work of Minoru
Akagi, who started some early development on this.
However, I think some core devs may be interested in joining the discussion.

Hi, 

My knowledge is a bit limited - but from what I know the three
approaches are completely different: 

* QGIS2threejs: uses WebGL. Goal is to publish a small scene to the web,
independent from QGIS. QGIS is only used to prepare the scene.
WebGLS/ThreeJS is quite a low-level technology compared to X3D 

* X3D approach: more descriptive, human readable files. Similar to VRML
or SVG. Goal ist also publication of smaller scenes to the web. X3D
viewer may render either natively or through WebGL. X3D, compared to
WebGL/Threejs lowers the barrier for script or XML people to further
process the file after an export. The X3D concepts are easier to
understand than raw WebGL. 

* qt53D: Based on OpenGL. could lead to a good integration into QGIS
core. Not meant to be published to the web.

Hi Andreas,

I completely agree with your characterisation of the various 3d
technologies. There is also webGL based Cesium which is higher level, still
performant for somewhat larger scenes but tied to a specific, single,
controlled implementation.

I am most familiar with X3D (having implemented most of the x3dom.js
geospatial nodes) and want to focus on that since it promises longevity of
content, even archival quality, including meta data capability.

This is probably what my question was aiming for. If there was a Qt53D
based X3D browser then it would be possible to  reuse that for QGIS3
integrated display. But I do not think there is. The closest would be
probably Qt5 webkit with webgl and x3dom.js (or cobweb.js).

Hi all,

In QGIS Master the "Control rendering order" in the "Layer Order Panel" is now always ticked by default when I start QGIS. Is there any way to disable this so that it is off by default? I've looked in settings and can't see how to do this.

I'm running QGIS Master on Ubuntu 16.10.

Hi G,

thanks for this update and your work in this!

in Bonn, I assisted Juergen when we tried to handle a backup of the old
db to read into a new Hetzner server (we actually already have one since
then...). Point at that moment was that we were waiting for people to
cleanup the wiki and plugin pages....

I think (Juergen?) that we actually were confident enough that with some
hours of work (and Juergens Perl-magic) we were able to move the old db
to a new RedMine instance.

I cannot do this alone, but if Juergen is in Essen and free for half a
day I think we should bite the bullet.

Regards,

Richard

Dear OSGeo community, students,

     April 3 16:00 UTC  Student application deadline

there will be only 7 days left for student applications.


* @Students:

Browse the ideas page at [2] and carefully read the recommendation for
students, particularly the application instructions at [3].


* Quoting verbatim from Google Admins:

"Historically, the students with the best proposals reach out to the
orgs early to receive
feedback before submitting their final proposal."

So don't wait until it is to late to give you feedback, but instead
join the communication
channels of your chosen software community and discuss over the proposal.


*Please forward this email to your software communities*

Happy coding!

Thanks Andreas for sharing your scripts. We will give it a try asap. x3ddom
is a great tool to create rapid, yet effective, 3d scenes and it's very
welcome in the GIS arena ;)

Hi Andreas,

I completely agree with your characterisation of the various 3d
technologies. There is also webGL based Cesium which is higher level, still
performant for somewhat larger scenes but tied to a specific, single,
controlled implementation.

I am most familiar with X3D (having implemented most of the x3dom.js
geospatial nodes) and want to focus on that since it promises longevity of
content, even archival quality, including meta data capability.

This is probably what my question was aiming for. If there was a Qt53D
based X3D browser then it would be possible to  reuse that for QGIS3
integrated display. But I do not think there is. The closest would be
probably Qt5 webkit with webgl and x3dom.js (or cobweb.js).

agreed, I'm also surprised (the list seems less reactive on several
subjects lately), and thanks for your perseverance in tracking this
important issue.

bad stuff indeed. so the above does not hit Q3, right?
a bit of a pity investing on a dead branch rather than on main trunk,
but I think it is a necessity, now that we want 2.18 as LTR.

it makes sense, but in spipte of our efforts, many plugins still rely on
this, and I do not think it's a good move just to shut them down

not sure about this: if they still make sense, I'd prefer to keep them.
e.g. the second oldest is still valid, and helps us remembering about a
real issue:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/167
I understand keeping the list short is a major advantage, but removing
issues like this is not an advantage for the project IMHO.

All the best.

Hi everyone,

I think, i found a memory leak in qgis branch release-2_18. The 2.14.x is not 
affected.

It doesn't matter what kind of layer i load, raster or vector, qgis starting 
to eat more more memory (ex. more than 8 GB ) , with just a single layer 
loaded.

Can anybody help me, how to debug and make a bugreport?

Dear Manish,

As you posted also in the qgis mailing lists, I assume you want to work on
your idea within the QGIS Project, but unfortunately your mail does not
tell exactly whithin which project you'd like to code.

In [1] you can find basic and important informations for proactive students
who are interested in this year's OSGeo-GSoC activities.
Please screen the ideas page at [2], read the GSoC recommendations for
students listed in [3] and then join the OSGeo's project communities of
your interest, introduce yourself and discuss your GSoC ideas, skills etc
with the communities. Explain your idea as briefly as possible and try to
find a mentor within the project.

Kind regards
Werner (on behalf of the OSGeo-GSoC admin team)

Would there be resources around to sponsor regular bugfixes instead of
only the ones before normal releases?
I think we should call on larger organizations to provide resources so
this can be taken care of. After all it's for organizations that LTR exists.

Do we have a plan for the signup process for redmine?
I think the decision to stick to redmine was made under the assumption
that one no longer needs to obtain a shared secret during this process.

What about all that have been in "feedback" state for more than 1 year?
That should filter out issues like 167.

Hi Frank,

Sorry I cannot reproduce this behavior.

When I start QGIS it's unchecked and also when actively checking it and
then creating a new project it's unchecked.

This should always be turned off by default, so there is no option that
you didn't find, but possibly an issue. We just need to find out what
triggers it for you that is different here.

Matthias

Which revision? This was a bug present from builds around 1-2 weeks
ago, but should be fixed now.

This isn't normal behaviour. Try disabling all installed plugins and
see if it's still reproducible.

Dear Paolo,
did you find a solution to this problem? I have exactly the same problem and
error messages. I am a fairly new user but it worked fine to begin with but
after a forced interruption I am not able to load any toolbox. All the best!

Hi Mats,
unfortunately I have access to an OSX only rarely, so I could not test
again. Thanks therefore for confirming. Does anybody else have the same?
Worth a ticket?
All the best.

Starting qgis with --noplugins option, not helping, the problem persists . 

My system is a Debian testing,
the qgis 2.18 is builded on my machine from branch release-2_18, and the 2.14 
it is from the official debian repo.

Hi All,

I apologize that I would not participate on this year's GSoC. I simply
don't have time to do a bit of research to make a good proposal on the
ideas above. And GSoC takes quite a lot of time even before the summer to
discuss and mock the proposal later to the community before coding period,
which I can't commit to, not until summer holiday. I hope QGIS will get
many interesting proposals from other students.

Cheers

Hi,

I'm on Debian testing, and build 2.14, 2.18 and master here.

Happy to test your setup, but never seen it before.

Can you provide me the steps/data to reproduce?
And the info/command based on what you conclude it to use 8Gb?

Just tried a run of 2.18 with a geopackage of the world, and using

valgrind --tool=massif /pathto/qgis218
ms_print massif.out.12503

it shows me max 100 mb (though not fully clear to me how to interpret
this wealth of info ...)

I wonder if someone has advice on how to have

QGIS and GRASS GIS installed on Ubuntu, the

QGIS packages with "ubuntugis" dependencies are now broken:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/16386

"Yesterday, UbuntuGIS got a GDAL 2.1.3 update, so QGIS need to be rebuilt
against that version."

Is it possible for QGIS to be rebuilt with the updated libraries?

I know QGIS is rebuild every month but will it be now?

You guys want to force me to use windows, you have to admit that! :-)

given that I (of course) appreciate the effort of maintainers,

thanks, Roy.

Hi Rchard,

I have two Debian testing machine, with the same problem.


This is a fresh, qgis 2.18 build, without any flag (i use to used -
march=native), just changing the install path

So, after starting qgis, i loaded a 2.8 GB tiff image, and started to zoom in 
and out and pan, then i closed qgis:

Interesting - are you running a debug build? Can you post the full log
(to pastebin or similar) using the "--leak-check=full
--show-leak-kinds=all" flags?

This error in Processing has been fixed in the 2.18 branch but after the
2.18.2 tag.

While we are waiting for the 2.18.5 release on mac, you can apply this
patch manually in the
file :

I realize this forum is for developers and I am just a simple user. I do not
quite understand how to "apply this patch manually in the 
file : 
/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/Resources/python/plugins/processing/algs/saga/SagaUtils.py".
Do I paste something in the Python console or in the Terminal or what.
Apologies for my ignorance and thanks for your efforts! If it is too
complicated I guess I'll have to wait for the next release. /Mats

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing GUI integration
Message-ID: <990c5d7b-c15e-d0ce-fa93-af50566e0026@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
now that Processing has appropriately moved its options to the Options
menu, I wonder if it wouldn't it be better to move also other entries,
and get rid of the Processing menu altogether:
* the Processing panel can be (de)activated from the Panels menu
* Results as well
* the graphical modeller can be started from inside the Processing panel

Menus to be moved are therefore:
* History
* Command line (unsure about this one, it could be a panel as well).
This would clean up the interface, and make Processing more integrated;
opinions?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <ead5e198-e91d-6b19-4946-9ee7c4d59834@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
in Processing, the interface prefills the dropdowns for the choice of
input layers with the active layer. When >1 layer has to be chosen (e.g.
for Difference) the same layer is selected twice. Of course Processing
cannot know which other layer to select, but it's almost certain that
nobody wants the same layer twice. I'd suggest therefore to put as a
default the topmost layer, excluding the active one.
Thanks.

Hi Paolo, 

While I agree with you that in most cases the same layer wouldn't be
chosen twice as input layers, I am not sure if your proposal is worth
the effort. 

In >90% of the cases the user will have to change the input layer anyway
- so what is the gain? 

Better to let the user consciously choose the correct parameters than
doing any wild guesses of what may be, by chance, the right choice in
some cases. 

I think we have other, more pressing issues to fix besides this minor
issue.

Hi Mats,

You can open the file with a text editor :
/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/Resources/python/
plugins/processing/algs/saga/SagaUtils.py

on line 75, instead of:
if not os.path.isdir(folder):

replace with:
if folder and not os.path.isdir(folder):

In some other words, just add "folder and" between the "if" and "os.path"

William, do you think you will provide a release?

I think that if the only way to show the toolbox is going to be
enabling it in the "Panel" menu, that is going to be very confusing...

The history can be integrated with the QGIS log maybe

The commander, we should get rid of it...

Hi all,
I noticed in qgis 3 the icons from georeferencer are much bigger than
the ones in the main menus: do they have to be replaced with new ones?
Another very minor issue, I'm afraid ;)
All the best.

To: "Hillers Heather" <Heather.Hillers at erftverband.de>

Hello Heather,

thank you for your interest and offer to participate in the development of
3d capabilities in QGis. You may have looked up my proof of concept github
project https://github.com/andreasplesch/QGIS-X3D-Processing which will
give you a good sense of where my interest is. Please feel free to submit
issues (or PRs!) there.

I encourage you to give the processing scripts and models a try, and then
perhaps fork the project and see if you can modify some of the python
scripts or just create a new processing model. For example it would be
straightforward to add automatic reprojection of the DEM to WGS84
geographic coordinates in a model. That could be good first mini-project.

I plan on slow, deliberate development emphasizing robustness and doing one
thing well before adding features. Any help is of course very welcome.
Would you be able to contribute under an open source license ?

The processing framework allows for very modular development which may be
helpful for adding or customizing functionality.

I took the liberty to extract your list of requirements here and offer some
responses:

1) Load 3d shapefiles  or database stored shapes (we use Oracle)  and DEMs
and have a very easy to use and navigate 3d viewer

Here the idea would be to use qgis as an abstraction layer and just use the
qgis vector and raster layer API. I did this for DEMs. How large in terms
of data size are the DEMs you need to view and navigate ? For large scenes
it will be necessary to use a LOD or tile based concept which is also
possible.
What kind of 3d vector data do you have ? The QGIS2Threejs plugin has some
good ideas for representing points and polylines. TINs have a direct
equivalent in X3D and would be also very doable.
Currently, the idea is to use a web browser as viewer and interface which
has a lot of advantages. With QT5 and Qgis3 it may be possible to couple a
html/js webkit viewer more tightly with Qgis3.

2) Get x, y, z from clicked points and nearest neighbor vertices to the
clicked points.

x3dom has built in picking. Nearest neighbor (snapping) should also be
possible but probably outside of QGis using js on the web client.

3) Allow editing of z coordinate of vertices in a 3d shapefile or other
vector

Editing is another category altogether which I am not targeting at this
point. The way I can see editing Z values is by using the 2d map Qgis
interface and attribute editing capabilities and have an automatically
updating 3d display of the adjustments. Editing directly in 3d will require
a lot more development. The GEarthview plugin allows for digitizing in
Google Earth.

4) Get 3d distance along a line or polygon boundary between 2 vertices.

Following and measuring a line in 3d should be pretty easy outside of the
3d display just as a regular plugin. There may well be existing
functionality.

5) Pin coordinates, feature ids, vertex ids of selected feature vertices in
order to query distances between them or for editing.

Not sure but does this collapse to labelling individual vertices so they
are easy to find/identify with other tools?

Hope this helps,

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] automatic sip files generation
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+a-kuhX_WZemBgDsVTKAxUp98xZNe2wkK1JHR77x8CAgw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'd like to raise the attention on a new workflow I just merged to
automatically generate SIP files using the header as source only.

A PR is pending for the documentation, but you can read it here
https://github.com/3nids/QGIS-Documentation/blob/6e3a9fb6f98a2869aef27c01b7ab70eb0a4c7556/source/docs/developers_guide/codingstandards.rst#sip-bindings
(waiting to be merged).

For the moment, only 3 files are generated (qgsattributes, qgsfeature and
qgsvectorlayer). One can starts adding new files to the process by adapting
their header and removing them from python/auto_sip.blacklist.

Best wishes,

Denis

Hello,

I am trying to read a raster using gdal's ReadAsArray() method in python
3.6. I am using the gdal library provided in Qgis' 2.99 weekly release
(QGIS-OSGeo4W-2.99.0-9-Setup-x86_64.exe).

this sample script:

import gdal
x = gdal.Open(r'D:/Map Samples/1/DTM/n29w098d5dtm.tif')  #valid tif
y = x.ReadAsArray()
print(y)


produces this error:

This is really great! A couple of questions:

1) the blacklist implies that any new .h files added to the source tree will automatically have sip bindings generated unless you explicitly blacklist them?
2) are you thinking to maintain the sip files in Git still or remove the from revision in favour of having them as build time artifacts only? I ask this because I often direct people to use the sip files as a reference guide for the python API if they want to dig under the hood a bit more.

Regards

Tim

As soon as you add the include in python/core/core.sip (or gui, analysis),
the SIP is considered as automatically generated from header except if you
blacklist it.

The goal is to remove the SIP files and have them created on build time.
But:
1) I except a few errors in the script to arise (so better to have an easy
access to the SIP files)
2) it needs to reach a significant point of ported headers.

So, in a somehow close or far future, yes they'll be removed from source
(hence no blacklist anymore only manual files such as core/conversions.sip).

Hi Denis,

Thanks a lot for finishing this.

I am really excited and expect less troubles on the sip front in the
long-term.

Tim, actually the generated python code now includes python DocStrings,
so it should be much easier to inspect an appropriate python
documentation directly with `help(QgsVectorLayer)` etc.

And to automatically generate an up-to-date python documentation.

Cheers
Matthias

Oh, now I see the docs:

https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/1788.diff

Smart solution indeed!

Thanks!

HI devs,

I just compiled QGIS and I still have these problems with Processing.

Besides Tim and Frank, nobody else have strange and not usable
Processing UIs?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <94b8153a-6213-070c-af6f-c77d1aaf2110@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I was looking for a convex polygon tool, and to my surprise I did not
found one that behaves as I (and I presume many others) expect: to me
the parameter to choose is the max length of the segment, whereas the
existing tools seem to allow the choice of the proportion of convex
polygon covered.
Am I missing something, or is this a real limitation of our tools?
All the best.

This is really great! I guess the next step would be to see if we can use autodoc to generate python documentation on the python libs. If that works it will go a long way towards bump starting the Python API work that Wes and Francisco were going to work on under a small QGIS funded project. The project never got out the starting gates because we could not come up with an elegant build system.

Might I suggest that we do our python documentation in a sphinx friendly way? So for example where you did:

@versionadded 3.0 in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4318/files#diff-356d7cb762f7b9dfa4526f102450a9aaR41

it would become

..versionadded:: 3.0

See http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/para.html

Since we are in green fields with python docstrings here it would be nice to have everything clean and neat and pythonic out the gate. Or are there some restrictions in the sippy annotations that require you to use a certain docstring style?

Regards

Tim

My name is Sven from South Africa. I finished my masters' degree last year
and developed a QGIS plugin for uncertainty visualization and accuracy
assessment of continuous raster datasets such as DEMs. It is function but
has some bugs still and there are also some functions I would like to add
to it. I am currently busy with my PhD proposal and am wondering if this
would be a good project to propose to the summer of code.

Having more people improve on this system will be very welcome, there
are plenty of nice little bells and whistles to add!

These doc strings are generated from the C++ doc strings. But since they
are a pretty simple syntax, it shouldn't be hard to improve sipify.pl to
also convert a set of doxygen tags to their pythonic equivalent. We
might want to unify the doxygen style as well within this process.

Do you mean like a monthly effort to dedicate some funds for bug fixing? I'd certainly like to see us heading that way, and even better where QGIS.org hires full time bug fixers / developers to work only for the good of the general project and not to serve a specific client. Andreas can speak better to the ability to do anything right now - but I suspect we might need to wait till next year if we want to budget for more substantial (e.g. monthly) paid bug fixing rounds.

Tim

Hi Paolo,

For reference, which ones did you try? I think this is something
useful that we need to investigate getting into master, either via
importing one of the existing plugins and adapting to processing or
via a c++ implementation exposed via processing.

> get rid of the Processing menu altogether:

I'm a -1 on this. I like the idea of integrating processing more
strongly in the ui, but I think there's a strong need for a processing
menu. There just isn't anywhere else that this stuff belongs in
naturally, unless we add an "analysis" menu, and then it's effectively
just a menu rename...

Agreed. I'm hoping to get a chance in the near future to port
QtCreator's locator bar to QGIS. It's a really nice implementation,
where 3rd party plugins can hook in search providers and everything
happens in background threads. If we added something like this we
could integrate some native search providers like a layer search (am I
the only one who often struggles to find layers in the layer tree in a
complex project??) and processing algorithm search.

Then plugins can take over and add address searching facilities using
the various online facilities, native db searches, layer catalog
searches, etc...

I have tried:
* PostGIS ST_ConcaveHull
* QGIS Concave Hull in Processing
* Concave hull (k-nearest-neighbors) from plugin Concave Hull (this
works differently, and has the useful option of creating multiple hulls
based on a field)
Thanks.

agreed in principle; currently however the menu is pretty useless,
replicating things available elsewhere, and adding history that as
Victor said could be better integrated in the panel.
what more flesh could we add here?

in this case it would be more of a Task menu, according to the vision of
Victor as exposed in his enlightening talk in Girona last year.

Hi Nyall,

that was something I had in mind when writing

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/64

Feel free to edit this one..

Do you have a locator bar example by hand?
I've been fiddling a little with widgets to create something like the
firefox search bar, but did not succeed yet...

Regards,

Richard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bridging Matrix QGIS channel to IRC
Message-ID: <20170331102002.GA9592@localhost>

I was happy to find a Matrix room for QGIS (#qgis:matrix.org)
which is bridged to the Gitter chat room and wondering why such
Matrix room isn't also bridged to the IRC channel on Freenode
(irc://irc.freenode.net/#qgis). Was it a choice or was it just
not done yet ?

As I've done Matrix rooms plumbing for a few channels this morning
(#osgeo:matrix.org, #osgeo-sac:matrix.org, #postgis:matrix.org,
#geos:matrix.org) I've understood it takes a Matrix room admin
and an IRC operator to complete the bridging. For QGIS these
are Tim on the matrix side and Jurgen on the IRC side. Also,
it takes a real-time synchronization because the request for
authorization expires in 3 minutes or so, which might be the
reason why the bridging was not completed yet.

So this mail is to request bridging of IRC to matrix (which would
automatically also mean bridging IRC and Gitter) and to suggest
granting privileges to more people from the QGIS community to
both the Freenode and Matrix channels, which would help doing
these kind of things.

Consider me available for help on both networks (strk on freenode;
@strk:matrix.org on matrix), or find me on IRC if you need help
with the bridge completion.

May the QGIS chat community be merged again ! :)

Hi all,

I am trying to get the web2gis plugin to respect my map rules within QGIS


1.       I am displaying a boundary layer as the top most layers. I want to make this layer 'unselectable' in my web map. Is there a way to do this. I have already disabled the layer in Project Properties > Identify Layers but it is not working.

2.       How do I get qgis2web to respect the symbol levels  I have created within a layers symbology?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Regards
Finbar Gillen

I can't agree more,  gitter added some more dispersion in channels, and
having a merge opportunity will help filling the communications gaps we
have now.

Hi Finbar

To make a layer unselectable, in QGIS try setting every one of its fields'
edit widget to "Hidden". I'm not sure how well that will work, though. It
might work OK in Leaflet if the polygon has no fill.

As for layered symbology, that is definitely not supported in Leaflet
exports. It is supposedly supported in OpenLayers exports, but it's not
something I've used or tested. The functionality remains from the plugin on
which qgis2web was based - Victor Olaya's qgis-ol3. Victor might recall how
well multiple symbol layers work.

Thanks

Tom

PS  You are probably better off posting qgis2web queries at
https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/issues, rather than on this mailing
list.

Hi all,

sorry to insist, but I still have this problem on my machine. Besides
the problem with the gdal and core algorithms, SAGA ones are not
displayed at all (UI opens but is empty at all).

I don't now if this could be related to my desktop environment
(cinnamon) but other people have the same problem with other desktops.

Can I give a trace to catch the problem?

Thanks

Matteo

Hi,

I came across reading QGIS release schedule at
http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.
html#release-schedule and wonder if that really reflects the decision that
was taken. The online roadmap exposed that:

#. 3.0 will be a LTR (actually from 3.0.9 - nine months after first
release?)
#. 3.0 will be LTR for *4 months*, replaced by 3.2
#. 3.2 will be released 9 months after 3.0 (not a multiple of 4 months but
I guess it was about rescaling release dates....)

My thoughts/questions:
- I wasn't aware that 3.0 was ever supposed to be LTR. Is that the plan?
- I fail to understand the reason why once 3.0 is released, we continue to
break our "four-months release" policy. Any reason to not release 3.2 four
months after 3.0.0 and push it as LTR four months later (as usual)? This is
what I understood from this discussion but maybe i missed some points... Or
are there mistakes in the online doc ?

Btw, great idea to make distinct columns for LTR and regular releases in
the table. It really eases the reading (and remark mistakes?)...

Regards,
Harrissou

Message-ID: <CAB28AsiAPgda8XeNW31hWdjdmFU_Uz=oxk05UNk7bUGa9hLN0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Jürgen, all

I'm wondering if there's any chance of an immediate follow up to the
2.18.5 release with a quick bug fix release.

Totally my fault, but when I backported
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/90f381 I missed some changes which
had occurred between master and 2.18, with the result that there's a
huge memory leak in 2.18.5. Basically every layer rendered on canvas
it retained for every canvas redraw. You can easily reproduce this by
loading any map and zooming in out a few times - the memory use
explodes and is never released.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/9838a8f fixes this, but the
severity of this leak makes 2.18.5 unusable.

Given I'm totally at fault here, I'm willing to get sponsor an
immediate 2.18.6 release through North Road if that helps speed this
up.

Hi, witch version of QGIS are you using,
I don't see this problems in 2.14 Ubuntu


I noticed since a couple of days that the UI of Processing look like it
is not gridded (see attachment).

Is this something of my local machine?

Cheers

Matteo
