Hello,

I just wanted to share my thoughts from the users-perspective:

Whenever there is a LTR-Version of a software I use that for production 
environments. For QGIS however, I always have both the LTR and the 
current version installed. The reason for this is my personal experience 
with bug reporting in QGIS. In the past I submitted a few bug reports, 
one of them was patched within a couple of days, but it took two months 
until it was released in the LTR, while it was released within the 
current branch within one month. Afaik changes have to be approved for 
the LTR-release, so it may take more time. Another bug I reported three 
weeks ago was also fixed within days, but the backport release went 
stale and the backport was closed by the qgis-bot. I don't know if 
things will improve if qgis-devs who don't seem to have time to review 
backport-changes, need to spent even more time they don't have on manual 
testing.

Right now I use LTR for daily work and the current version if I 
encounter errors, if LTR is being released only every few months I'm 
gonna start using the current version and only switch to the LTR version 
if I encounter errors, because it most certainly has less bugs in the 
functions that exists in both versions and for production environments I 
prefer less bugs.

Cheers

Where is that quarantine rule?  Is it tied into the backport bot?

In the good old days I'd apply my fixes to master also to the release branches,
once the showed to work in master and didn't produce additional complains from
users of the nightlies.  And that ideally not shortly before the release so
people could still try the release nightlies.

Hi,

Like that other decision - that was a bit hard to find (you helped me 
find it in QEP 239) - I don't know exactly where the quarantine rule 
originated. I am pretty sure there was discussion.

Nyall: can you please share some background when and why it was 
introduced and if this decision can be found in some QEP or PSC 
decision?

Note that I am not questioning the quarantine rule - I think it makes 
sense - but I want to discuss the combination of the quarantine rule 
with the thinned out release cycle - and how we can improve things in 
this respect.

Thank you all for the discussion,

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

Thanks for raising this issue.

>From our experience with various large organizations, they generally skip
most of the minor releases. But for those who fund a specific bug fix, they
will immediately upgrade to the latest LTR as soon as the fix appears in
the release.
So, having the current regular releases of LTR suits both sets of users.
The LTR releases can be skipped for most organisations but also crucial for
those who pay to fix a bug in QGIS master and get backported to LTR.

Kind regards
Saber

We only update our LTR at most every 6 months and for some they are still
using quite old versions. The only reason we might want something updated
sooner would be if there were a bug that someone had encountered.

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS reading zipped fgdb
Message-ID: <CAOrcXHEySMb3QEvww9DW3uVA2m-LE+dWg+Gckm7HQZ1dnxhBXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just wanted to ask whether we would expect qgis 3.22 to read a zipped file
geodatabase normally.

>From a brief look, the data is read fine, but QGIS fails to successfully
read the layer names and imports the datasets with names taken from the
files in the fgdb.

from the layer properties information tab

name:

CIP_FY22_FY23.gdb ? CIP_FY22_FY23.gdb/a00000009.gdbtable

source:

/vsizip/H:/50000/50793_P_Anne Arundel County Bicycle and Pedestrian Master
Plan
Update/PRODUCTION/GIS/SHP/CIP_FY22_FY23.gdb.zip/CIP_FY22_FY23.gdb/a00000009.gdbtable|layername=CIP_Proposed_Point

I don't really have time to investigate further, and given that it's fgdb I
don't think this is a big priority to support esri's file types perfectly,
but I saw it mentioned recently that fgdb edit capabilities are coming to
QGIS via the openfilegdb driver, so thought I'd share in case that's
indicative of a larger problem of some sort. I've used the osgeo4w optional
driver install in the past and appreciated that so I"m excited for this
improvement.

Hope everyone's week is going well.

Hugh

Hi,

the apostrophe in the new release name was a little issue, but there's
another issue with transifex: for some reason the spanish translation
dropped below 35% and would be removed?

I'm currently trying to sort that out with transifex support?

I have pending commits for release-3_28, master (and a local release-3_30
branch).  Please don't push for the time beeing.

We can always use "Den Bosch" - if that other name causes too many

"was" is past tense - so that's sorted out (not pushed yet though).  And I
doubt that changing the release name would help with transifex ;)

The problem is that the spanish translation should be above 80%, but shows at
19% and is therefore automatically removed when pulling in the transifex update
into the new branch.

On the transifex side there are tons of translations that have a 101%
suggestion - which means that they match a previous translation that transifex
still has in memory - it apparently "just" lost, that that' the current
translation.

Not sure what happened and why it only affects the spanish translation - the
others seem ok.

Sandy from transifex support just replied, that she's going to take this to the
engineers for a closer look and keep me posted.  hm.

Ups, if I can to do something to review the Spanish translation, don't

Are some problems with translation??
I hope You resolve early...
I want to star to use the new 3.28 LTR early.

Well, didn't hear back yet - but I pushed the qgis_es.ts fetched from transifex
yesterday back there and now it looks ok.

Hi Nicolas,

Since there have been no answers so far, it seems like nobody has tried
this before.

In the footer of https://plugins.qgis.org/models it reads that Alessandro
Pasotti and Kartoza have developed the hub web app. Maybe they can point us
at the relevant source code sections or answer directly.

Regards,
Anita

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problem with default "identify" action in python
Message-ID: <CAEvoHPe+tosoBX5M0Rb8k_YUhrp7vivQQTDMrU6T+6X1-CySnw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
I have got problem with QgsMapToolIdentifyFeature in LayerSelection mode.
I create my own class called myFeature which inherits
QgsMapToolIdentifyFeature.
This class has got variable "menu" which is identifyMenu from
QgsMapToolIdentifyFeature class.
In myFeature class I create my custom action object "act" and I added it to
identifyMenu as custom action.

My "act" is a object of MyMapLayerAction class inherits from
QgsMapLayerAction.

Is it any way to override the default "identify" ("identyfikacja" on
screen) action or remove it from identify menu?

My code:

class myFeature(QgsMapToolIdentifyFeature):
    def __init__(self, iface):
        self.iface = iface
        self.canvas = self.iface.mapCanvas()
        self.layer = self.iface.activeLayer()
        super().__init__(self.canvas, self.layer)
        menu = self.identifyMenu()
        act = MyMapLayerAction("Do sth",
                               menu,
                               QgsMapLayerType.VectorLayer,
                               QgsMapLayerAction.SingleFeature)
        menu.addCustomAction(act)

class MyMapLayerAction(QgsMapLayerAction):
    def __init__(self, name, menu, vector, single):
        super().__init__(name, menu, vector, single)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Timestep for (Temporal) Mesh/netcdf layers?
Message-ID: <bdf33908aa5721a1f016226b0f33e5e3@duif.net>

Hi,

When loading (temporal) Netcdf files (as MeshLayers), the 'timestep' 
that you see in the Temporal Controller does not change.

I had a look at the api, but could not find any indication of knowledge 
by the QgsMeshLayer of the size of the timesteps of the data.

Within netcdf's it is common to define the timesteps as something like:
"minutes since 2022-11-27 16:00:00.0Z"
then the first set has 0, and then the next one for example 60 for 
hourly data or 10 for 10-minute data.

Question: IS a temporal mesh layer aware of the timesteps used?

Or if not: I seem not to be able to inspect the data array of the 'time' 
dimension. Should/can I?

IF so, we could we could deduct from the first 2 or 3 timesteps, the 
size of the timestep.

Anybody a hint or idea?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Can somebody confirm that the changelog (input site) is finished/frozen?
https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.30/

I do see the notable fixes tables are already added by Andreas...
So: freeze and pull in site?

Regards,

Richard

Hi Richard,

I have nothing to add. But I can't say for everyone.

I think you can freeze and pull.

Thank you very much for your work - Richard! (and J?rgen for the
packaging). And everyone who worked on the visual change log!

Andreas

I watched the video yesterday and read through the changelog. Whether it is
complete or not I just want to say you are all amazing and thank you for
all your hard work.

Dear All,

I am writing to you to request for some help.
My name is Berit Mohr and I am a consultant within the Digital Innovation Unit at GFA Consulting Group GmbH. We are a development cooperation company and our clients are mostly development banks or government agencies.
We have a new tender that we want to apply to which has the objective to develop a QGIS Plugin that is able to implement their climate positive land use strategy.

Although I have a strong background in GIS myself, the tender is too big for one person alone.

If you are interested in knowing more, please let me know and I am looking forward to your mail

Mit freundlichen Gr??en ? Kind regards

Hi Berit,

Have a look at this list of companies that provide commercial QGIS support:

https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/commercial_support.html

Many of them will be able to help you with plugin development.

Kind regards,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Timestep for (Temporal) Mesh/netcdf layers?
In-Reply-To: <bdf33908aa5721a1f016226b0f33e5e3@duif.net>
References: <bdf33908aa5721a1f016226b0f33e5e3@duif.net>
Message-ID: <1122aeb4-432a-5726-1a22-0b02b62a3e4b@duif.net>

Ok, found it. It is in the temporalCapabilities...

So given a loaded netcdf/mesh with time.
Easiest is the firstTimeStepDuration(i) of QgsMeshDataProviderTemporalCapabilities:

  >>> p = iface.activeLayer().dataProvider().temporalCapabilities()
  >>> p
  <qgis._core.QgsMeshDataProviderTemporalCapabilities object at 0x7fa958267e20>
  >>> p.timeExtent()
  <QgsDateTimeRange:[2022-11-07T07:00:00Z, 2022-11-08T06:00:00Z]>
  >>> p.temporalUnit()
  <TemporalUnit.Hours: 3>   <<< ?????
  # datasetTime() Returns the relative time in milliseconds of the dataset
  >>> p.datasetTime(QgsMeshDatasetIndex(0,0))
  3600000
  >>> p.datasetTime(QgsMeshDatasetIndex(0,1))
  7200000
  >>> p.datasetTime(QgsMeshDatasetIndex(0,2))
  10800000
  # firstTimeStepDuration() Returns the duration of the first time step of the dataset group with index \a group
  # in milliseconds
  p.firstTimeStepDuration(0)
  3600000  == 3600 s = 1 hours
  p.firstTimeStepDuration(0)
  21600000  == 21600 s == 360 minute == 6 hours

Only strange thing is that the temporalUnit() always returns 'hours', while the actual data time is relative in minutes...

Hello Richard,
I decided to continue working with the old installation for the last two 
weeks but I really need a fresh installation. Starting a new system 
installation from scratch, I've tried the Github branch and the v3.30 
release (from 5 days ago) but the compilation is still generating the same 
error. The suggested dependencies are up-to-date.
$ sudo apt install libqt5multimedia5 python3-pyqt5.qtmultimedia
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
libqt5multimedia5 is already the newest version (5.15.3-1).
libqt5multimedia5 set to manually installed.
python3-pyqt5.qtmultimedia is already the newest version 
(5.15.6+dfsg-1ubuntu3).
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 32 not upgraded.
Thanks.

Hi,
Maybe this issue:

You are missing some (new) python dependecies:

Hi,

As most of you are probably aware, a lot of work has been recently
done in order to support QT6 QGIS builds.

During the last PSC meeting we discussed the QGIS QT6 support status
because we would like to start a discussion in order to set up a
roadmap and move forward.

We decided to organize a meeting with all the interested QGIS
contributors to discuss:

- current QT6 build status
- blockers (webkit etc.)
- how to move forward

If you are willing to participate please choose a time that works for
you here  https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/enRwEz5e

Here are a few links to the previous discussions:

Hi all,

how can I get the active map theme (or None) with Python? Until now, I 
can only read all themes and apply one using QgsMapThemeCollection.

Thanks, Simon

Hi Allessandro,

Very interested! Please let us know what the outcome of the doodle is,
so I/others can try to be there/lurk if possible (my input will not be enough to influence the date/time,
but I would be really happy to try to make the build work on Debian :-) , I failed last time I tried ).

Am I right to conclude this is (for europe) an afternoon/evening session (11AM-12PM)?

All: Thanks for this work and good luck with all tough hurdles/decisions!

Hey Michel,

you could launch the other Python interpreter/environment as a 
subprocess. Anything more sophisticated would probably be very hard and 
finicky.

Hi,

I played a bit with the site.  There is indeed an icon for deleting models and uploading new models which is what I did.  My new models are waiting approval.  I noticed at the end a ? modify ? button next to the delete button.  You first need to select the model first before seeing those options.  ? Modify ? would probably have been easier, would have probably skipped the approval part and would have probably kept the download count.  

When all else fails? read the instructions I guess!

Thanks Anita,
Nicolas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS icons cheatsheet
Message-ID: <cb912c3c-ee7e-ab21-fda1-503064c45c5d@oslandia.com>

Hello,

Just to publicize a side-project that I've been working on recently: 
https://pyqgis-icons-cheatsheet.geotribu.fr/.

A website to list and preview icons shipped with QGIS. The idea and the 
first realisation are already two years old (see this blog post 
<https://static.geotribu.fr/articles/2021/2021-01-19_pyqgis_utiliser_icones_integrees/> 
and this one 
<https://static.geotribu.fr/articles/2021/2021-02-02_pyqgis_previsualiser_images_integrees/>) 
but it was entirely manual and therefore not up to date at all.

Recently, I worked on complete automation using GitHub Workflow: 
scheduled to run monthly, it parses the QGIS resources file 
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/images/images.qrc> and rebuild 
and publish the website.

Hope it can help some plugins developers!

Best regards,
Julien

Message-ID: <CAL5Q671kBLmvHHq-fKN5gOMky_Pr+62Nc9Czsv_11Nhj2=e16w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Here is some feedback about the QGIS QT6 status meeting we had yesterday.

First I'd like to thank all the attendees, it was great to see the
excitement and the interest in moving forward with this project.

If I may summarize the outcome, we decided that the best way to move
forward is to create a working group with all the interested
developers and allocate a budget (20K is the proposed budget) in order
to find a solution to the main blockers, it is very hard to estimate
the effort in advance but we thought that with that budget we will be
able to move forward.

Any QGIS core developer with experience in the main areas involved and
willing to dedicate some time to this effort is eligible and warmly
invited to participate in the working group.

Here is the link to the minutes:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Un4Jyz9PO8t2vmEBkUKa187SytM2gsQn-jB6mSqXcvU/

This proposal will be discussed at the next PSC meeting.

Hi,

Thank you for the meeting minutes!

I'm already planning to continue the effort in
porting/fixing code for Qt6 in the next months using Oslandia own

Is there a reason why we are switching from ubuntu for Qt5 builds to
fedora for Qt6 builds ? Because there is already PyQt6 packages in ubuntu:22.10.

Hi Michel,

thank you and welcome!

The next step is to get this plan approved by the PSC (with the
associated budget), the next PSC meeting is in about three weeks.

If the plan is approved I'll set up monthly meetings to coordinate the efforts.

Kind regards.

Hi Julien,

that's great news and you are welcome!

I'll leave the answer to your question to others, IIRC at the time
fedora was the only distro packaging pyQt6 and SIP.

Sandro Mani certainly knows more about this topic.

Debian has PyQT6 too:

Hi Ale and colleagues,

Thank you all for your efforts to make QGIS qt6 build a reality - and work
on overcoming the blockers.

Perhaps we can speed up the PSC decision and give this a go through our
approval on the QGIS PSC mailing list, rather than having to wait for the
next meeting in 3 weeks.

Budget wise we can cover the approximate estimated expenses of 20k ?. The
funding drive had good results - more sustaining members on the upper
levels (large and platinum) are in the pipeline.

>From me it is a +1.

Andreas

And that is completely irrelevant here I think, sorry.

I use Archlinux btw! ;)

Initially Fedora was the *only* platform offering qt6 binaries, so all
the CI setup was done using that. But now that Ubuntu/etc have caught
up I still think it's a good idea to leave the CI with Fedora so that
we get a better spread of testing environments. (Fedora generally has
much more recent gdal/geos/proj/etc so by running CI on this
environment we're more likely to catch issues/test differences across
a wider range of library versions)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Search and Rescue Package
Message-ID: <55609930-D6EC-4320-BA9B-39888B228101@charter.net>

Many thanks to Richard Dulvenvoorde for helping me connect with the Developer community.


Greetings from Michigan!
I work on a search and rescue team that wishes to move to QGIS for use in printing maps, deploying teams to search segments of the search area, and tracking clues / search assets. I have already used the system (3.2) as it is today and find it to be far superior to what we have used in the past. In preparation for this, we have obtained sat maps and topos of the lower peninsula of Michigan (our coverage area) and will shortly obtain street maps covering the same area to develop the appropriate layers for our maps.  

After a short search of the available packages for the system, I don?t see any that match our needs, though I?ve just been using the search terms I am familiar with, and being a newbie, could have easily missed something. I don?t expect what we need will have much application or be of interest to others, so I won?t be surprised if we need to start from scratch.  What I would like is some ideas of existing packages I can steal shamelessly from to build what we need.  Or if it already exists, a push to the right package(s) or the right user group that may already cover this turf.  

I see you have all the tools we will need for our maps (except perhaps grid convergence), which should make this relatively easy. I don?t see any packages that are scripted to walk through the process we currently use to define search areas using R. Koester?s behavioral category rings. And so I am committed to developing a script todo this in our first phase of development.

Our plan is to develop a script that will:
 Define the IPP (initial Planning Point) for the search and mark the map accordingly
 Mark other search assets (Staging / Incident Command / Net Control, etc)
 Constrain the visible / map area to the 95th percentile of Probability of Area (or Containment).
 Place Koester rings on the map for the 25 / 50 / 75 / 95 POAs and for our 300m initial search area.
 Index all maps with magnetic declination and grid convergence for our navigator's easy reference
 Save PDF versions of the SAT/TOPO/Street maps to a remote folder for retrieval as the search progresses.
At various scales and indexed for retrieval by area / scale

If this works as I hope, we will begin planning work on a second phase to use automation to segment the search area into acceptable chunks a ground team or canine team can tackle in a given working period.  

Any help is appreciated.  

Have fun,
John Hutcheson

Hi. I have developed a plugin for SAR operations for Police of the Czech
Republic.

You can check it at http://patrac.eu
Here is the User manual (only in czech language, but with some images that
may show how it works): http://sarops.info/patrac/qgis3/user/index.html
or here is the presentation from 2021 done for Slovenia Mountain Rescue
Service (http://sarops.info/patrac/qgis3/prezentace/Patrac202104_EN.pdf).

Now I am in the process of making it more generic to be working anywhere in
the world.

If you are interested, you can contact me.

And ?
And of course, the only one unix : FreeBSD, and also Alpine, Mageia, 
OpenMandriva, Pisi, Solus : 
https://repology.org/project/python:qt6/versions
And xxx as well : https://repology.org/project/pyqt6/versions ; 
https://repology.org/project/pyqt6-python3/versions ; etc

Thank you all for this proposal and participation in this effort. I'm 
just kidding by listing all the existing distributions, just to refocus 
the discussion.

If it is undoubtedly that it is easier for us, developers, to work on 
our unix-like systems <insert here your OS>. But, please keep in mind 
the main thing: the majority of our users are not on the mentioned systems.

I didn't find the exact statistics, but I bet on something like 90% 
windows, 9% mac and the rest between unix like with more than 0.000x for 
Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/CentOS.

Just my 2 cts.

Yeah, I had simply missed the context of the thread and thought I could 
contribute "here is another distro where one could use qt6 already" ;). 
Didn't mean that it would be a viable distro to put any development 
focus on in any way(!).

Of course, why not?
But I'm not sure it's worth it, as there's not much original text, as 
it's mostly technical notes.

Or are you talking about blog posts?

Kind regards,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Create layer, start edit session,
 commit and end edit session does not get me completely out of edit
 session and get my pan cursor back
Message-ID: <a3b9d978d8ef44ce84baf8d19e487dfd@erdc.dren.mil>

I have written code that automatically creates an empty QgsVectorLayer, adds it to the layer panel; I add a call to vlayer.featureAdded.connect(self.check_size) on the created layer that starts an edit session as well as checks that my polygon is within a min and max size.  The user can then use QGIS edit tools to add the feature.  After one feature is added it commits the changes.  This tool is to just draw an AOI so I want to auto close the edit session.  Though the layer is no longer in edit mode, the edit bullseye cursor is still showing.  It seems the edit mode is still in play.  I can still draw on the canvas and the shaded polygon shows up as if I am in edit mode.  I don't get an error.  Why does not running  commitChanges() completely get me out of edit mode.  My fix sine I cannot figure this out is to run iface.actionPan().trigger() to get myself back in pan mode, but why does this not get done automatically.

If I use QGIS to create an empty layer, toggle editing on by selecting that option on the layer in the layer panel, add a feature, and then toggle editing off and select save when prompted, I get the pan cursor back and I am completely out of edit mode.  What code do I need to run to accomplish this in python? I basically just use startEditing and commitChanges to start and end an edit session.

Thanks,
Luke

Hi,
Does anyone know who approves the models?  I have 3 models waiting to be approved and I was hoping we could get them online asap as my presentation video at the last QGIS day is working well on YouTube.

Hard to tell where the issue is without a minimal reproducible code 
example...

Best always use the "with edit():" context instead of manually fiddling 
around with startEditing/commitChanges.

And if you use functions that return success codes, make sure you check 
them.

Hallo, 

 

I have a larger application, just this small test, I'm trying pyinstaller.

I am testing a simple PyQgis application. When I add the line "from
qgis.core import QgsApplication" and make an exe via pyinstaller, the
application crashes with an error:

When I comment out the line "from qgis.core import QgsApplication" the
application window starts normally after creating the EXE.

 

See Code: 

 

import sys

 

from qgis.PyQt.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QWidget,
QHBoxLayout, QLabel

from qgis.core import QgsApplication

 

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):

    def __init__(self, parent=None):

        super(MainWindow, self).__init__(parent)

        self.setWindowTitle("Mapov? prezera?ka ---  Pebieha na??tanie d?t
...")

        self.init_gui()

        self.show()

 

    def init_gui(self):

        self.formular = QWidget()

        layoutFormulara.addLayout(boxLayout2)

        layoutFormulara.addStretch()

 

        self.label1 = QLabel("Hello")

        boxLayout1.addWidget(self.label1)

        self.setCentralWidget(self.formular)

    mainWin.show()

 

    # Run aplik?ciu

    try:

        retval = app.exec_()

        # Exit aplication

        sys.exit(retval)  # this will always trigger SystemExit

    except SystemExit:

        print("sys.exit() it worked as expected ")

    except:

        print("Something has gone terribly wrong ")  # another exception was
raised

 

 

if __name__ == "__main__":

    app = QApplication(sys.argv)

    main()

 

 

I looked for many answers on the Internet but I couldn't find anything.
I've read the pyinstaller manual, I'm just new to this. I am sending a

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS webserver size vs publishing old docs
Message-ID: <CAECJsSrJO3Lrppdjyvt1=X=eSqWqbYrmLk3_C=9jVaj+5QKaQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all (and sorry for the cross-post)

Richard has raised the issue a couple of times with no specific
feedback/decision but I think now we NEED to go forward : there is not
enough space on our servers to store everything we want to share.
Yesterday, I updated the docs infrastructure to serve translated versions
of the 3.28 documentation but they are not published this morning, probably
because of lack of space to get them pasted.

# du -hs *
255M    doc-test
579M    QGIS-Documentation
7.2G    QGIS-Documentation-2.14
6.3G    QGIS-Documentation-2.18
7.7G    QGIS-Documentation-2.8
12G     QGIS-Documentation-3.10
11G     QGIS-Documentation-3.16
9.4G    QGIS-Documentation-3.22
579M    QGIS-Documentation-3.28
8.0G    QGIS-Documentation-3.4
31G     QGIS-tests
16G     QGIS-Website

An option could be to rent a bigger  webserver but a few
questions/suggestions so far (I'm only speaking for the docs as I don't
know what is behind other folders):
- Do we need to serve all these versions? FYI we recently silently removed
and redirected <2.8 docs (and nobody complained) so we could probably be
more "aggressive"
- It could be nice to define some strategy on this area: e.g. we keep
publishing master, current LTR, previous LTR and any older URL is
redirected to current LTR --> meaning that today we would be serving only
testing in English, 3.28 and 3.22 in English + translations. OR one more
older LTR (ie 3.16)?

PS: this issue somehow also affects the PyQGIS documentation repo [0], due
to github-pages size limits

Regards,
Harrissou

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Tool to create Mesh from raster layer?
Message-ID: <ed59755b7330baa584f427dc2b3d26d9@carto.net>

Hi QGIS devs,

Is there a tool available to create a Mesh (or TIN as a special mesh 
variation) from a source raster layer containing terrain values?

I did not find one - but maybe I didn't look everywhere.

If not in QGIS - do you know an external Open Source tool that could do 
that, while keeping real world coordinates?

Thanks,

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

There should be a tool to convert vector to mesh (under Processing > Mesh >
TIN Mesh Creation). There will also be some new Processing tools for
handling point clouds. But I am not aware of any Raster > Mesh tools.

Hi all,

I think it is not nessasary to go through Blender, just use theese two 
algorithm:

  * pixeltopoints
  * tinmeshcreation

Best regards

Hi,

Yes - exporting the raster to xyz points or to contour lines are both 
workarounds.

It would be nice, if QGIS would gain a direct algorithm of creating a 
mesh from a DEM - as many DTMs are provided as raster. It seems like 
SAGA has a raster DTM to TIN algorithm ( 
https://saga-gis.sourceforge.io/saga_tool_doc/8.5.1/tin_tools_0.html ) - 
but SAGA is a bit complicated to use within QGIS and SAGA support within 
QGIS processing may disappear in the future. Perhaps we could port the 
SAGA algorithm to QGIS - or maybe an alternative algorithm?

My goal is to replace the raster DTM with a MESH for 3D display - with 
the ability to edit the MESH at important points. The builtin 
triangulation of the QGIS 3D viewer (where you can have a raster DTM as 
a terrain source) is sometimes doing weird things - I'd like to control 
that better - e.g. by introducing additional break lines or manually 
editing the Mesh.

Andreas

Hi Andrea,

I faced the same issue recently and found these two tools to convert DEM into TIN:

- dem2mesh: https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/dem2mesh
- tin-terrain https://github.com/heremaps/tin-terrain

dem2mesh worked in my use case to convert a large DEM for 3d visualization. It produces nice triangular faces of uniform size. Tin-terrain creates large triangles in flat parts of the mesh.

It would be great to have an algorithm like dem2mesh directly in QGIS!

Best,

Hi all (and sorry for the cross-post)

Richard has raised the issue a couple of times with no specific feedback/decision but I think now we NEED to go forward : there is not enough space on our servers to store everything we want to share.
Yesterday, I updated the docs infrastructure to serve translated versions of the 3.28 documentation but they are not published this morning, probably because of lack of space to get them pasted.

# du -hs *
255M    doc-test
579M    QGIS-Documentation
7.2G    QGIS-Documentation-2.14
6.3G    QGIS-Documentation-2.18
7.7G    QGIS-Documentation-2.8
12G     QGIS-Documentation-3.10
11G     QGIS-Documentation-3.16
9.4G    QGIS-Documentation-3.22
579M    QGIS-Documentation-3.28
8.0G    QGIS-Documentation-3.4
31G     QGIS-tests
16G     QGIS-Website

An option could be to rent a bigger  webserver but a few questions/suggestions so far (I'm only speaking for the docs as I don't know what is behind other folders):
- Do we need to serve all these versions? FYI we recently silently removed and redirected <2.8 docs (and nobody complained) so we could probably be more "aggressive"
- It could be nice to define some strategy on this area: e.g. we keep publishing master, current LTR, previous LTR and any older URL is redirected to current LTR --> meaning that today we would be serving only testing in English, 3.28 and 3.22 in English + translations. OR one more older LTR (ie 3.16)?

PS: this issue somehow also affects the PyQGIS documentation repo [0], due to github-pages size limits

Harrissou

Hi QGIS devs,

Is there a tool available to create a Mesh (or TIN as a special mesh
variation) from a source raster layer containing terrain values?

I did not find one - but maybe I didn't look everywhere.

If not in QGIS - do you know an external Open Source tool that could do that, while keeping real world coordinates?

Thanks,

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

There should be a tool to convert vector to mesh (under Processing > Mesh > TIN Mesh Creation). There will also be some new Processing tools for handling point clouds. But I am not aware of any Raster > Mesh tools.

Kind regards
Saber

The ridiculous work around I use is to go through Blender using the BlenderGIS plugin. Import the raster into Blender as a new mesh > Decimate the mesh > Export as a shapefile > Run TIN Mesh Creation in QGIS.

Hi all,

I think it is not nessasary to go through Blender, just use theese two
algorithm:

  * pixeltopoints
  * tinmeshcreation

Best regards

Stefan

I would say keeping 3 LTRs documentations would be more than enough, if needed we can leave just keep the PDFs for historic.

Howdy!

What makes them so big? It really surprises me that 3.22 is smaller than 
3.10.

Nerdy idea: If it is lots of HTML files, would pre-compressing them on 
the file system and letting the server serve them from that be an 
option? Or maybe using a compressed filesystem? I had lots of fun 
serving gigantic text archives using FUSE in the past.

Considering how cheap hosting static files is, why is there even a need 
to care? Afaik the docs.qgis.org server is fronted by CloudFlare caching 
so performance is no issue. OVH offers 1TB servers for 6?/month. I'd 
gladly sponsor this for all eternity.

As a user, as long as documentation is not stored locally but help 
buttons open a *webbrowser for remotely-hosted pages*, I would expect 
*any* released version to have its documentation available forever. 
Otherwise part of my QGIS is remotely broken by this.

Cheers, Hannes

Hi all,

I agree with Johannes - that old docs - at least of LTR versions should
ideally be kept around for more years.

I wonder what is the content of "QGIS-tests" (the largest share storage
wise)? Is this the "latest" documentation version in the works - or is it
the test results of the performance tests? Does it contain old stuff that
could be cleaned?

Hi all,

before we all spend too much energy and time on this, would simply buying
more space for that also be a (probably not even that expensive) option?

Hi Matthias,

Sure - buying more space is an option. I would like to get an idea - 
however - what the monthly expected costs are. Is this a "virtual" 
server at Hetzner? How much disk space does it have currently, how much 
do we want? What is the price difference?

But is also good to get rid of stuff that is hardly ever used and 
accumulates over time.

At some point - cleanup of old stuff just makes sense. Getting rid of 
version 2.14 and 3.8 (it probable should mean 3.8 and not 2.8 - right) 
would make sense. Documentation always focuses on LTR versions, so all 
the "in-between" versions that are older than 3-4 years could be 
deleted.

Building is done on a real Hetzner server: qgis6.org a Hetzner EX42 Root server  about 50euro/month
Serving the site + docs is done on www2.qgis.org a Hetzner Cloud cpx31  160GB disk 14euro/ month (as cloud would be cheaper etc etc)

We can upgrade the www2 to a newer bigger CLOUD server, but that is about 35 euro/month for just 80Gb more..
Probably then it is better to leave the cloud, and just add an extra root server on which you have a couple of terrabytes... for 50 euro/month

Can we sit together in Den Bosch and do decide something on this? I really feel unhappy if people telling us "why is there even a need to care": we/I am not a sysadmin, so everybody with great knowledge and idea's: please help out!

We still have version 2 (TWO) .8 .14 and .18 around :-) so it NOT a typo...
So: can I delete those?
And also 3.10 (as this is a 2018 release)

The QGIS-tests dir, contains the info available at:
http://test.qgis.org
BUT!!! that url/dns actually still points to the old server (qgis2)
That site hosts the ogcapif / wfs / wms tests (untill 26th of januari)???

Anybody feeling need or responsible for this?
We are not serving (yet) test.qgis.org from www2 ...

Regards,

Richard

Hi,

Thank you for checking, Richard - yes an additional 35 ? per month for just
80gb more is not nothing ... compared to a root server.

Ok - let's delete the 2.8 and 2.14 releases. I think it would be good to
keep the latest 2.x (2.18) around. This should give us some initial room to
serve the current documentation. If we need additional space. we could also
remove the 3.10 documentation.

And yes, it is a good idea to discuss infrastructure tasks and
responsibilities in Den Bosch!

I hope that Kartoza can soon find a good sysadmin person - now that the
idea to employ a Sysadmin and the funds had been approved.

Andreas

I am trying to read raster values by hover over mouse to read raster value,
but option not visible in identifying tool setting. It only shows three
option already exists in qgis 3.28.3. Mouse hower option not visible in
3.30.0 .

Hi Andreas,

Indeed, there is no native tool at the moment to convert raster directly to
mesh. I filed a ticket with a link to this discussion so we can add it to
QGIS later:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/52313

But, in general, I would first try to find the source of the DEM raster
(e.g. point cloud or spot survey) and use the raw data to create the mesh.
This will avoid double interpolation :)

Kind regards
Saber

Hi Saber,

It is a good point  - to use the source.

I think the source was a point cloud data set.

So, ideally, it could be a point cloud to mesh tool (or TIN).

I see that Alex Bruy just committed a point cloud to raster tool (going
through TIN is an option), but not as a final TIN result.

Hi,
Thanks all for the feedback

I second the (somewhat reformulated by myself) opinion that we shouldn't
just buy space or disk because we would be financially able to do so. Not
sure it is a sustainable behavior and we'd just be postponing the issue
(remember, pyqgis repo is also concerned). We rather should identify what
we do really want/need to provide to our community. So I'm glad you'll
discuss this at Den Bosch.* (and I keep updating my list of todo for the
sys admin)*
I also second the suggestion to delete 2.8 and 2.14. It'd release enough
space to serve 3.28.

About the questions:
Hannes, the folders are so big because they serve (in about 15 to 20
languages):
- the HTML files (the ones we all know)
- the PDF files (e.g. https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/pdf/)
- and the zipped HTML files (https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/zip/) for local use
for people that do not have full access to WEB but not sure if anyone is
using them. It could be interesting to know stats of downloads (if any).

About why 3.10 is bigger than 3.22, it had two languages we no longer
publish, and looks like we managed somehow to provide smaller files
(plugins and third-party providers chapters that were removed on the road?
?)

Bernd, sorry for the old docs popping up during search. Unfortunately, not
something new [0], and we still are looking for people with knowledge in
this area to help us improve the situation. What I usually do is to replace
the version number in the URL and most of the times, it work well unless
the file has been restructured.
The line that shows the top message is at [1]. If someone knows how we can
add the section anchor to that URL, suggestions are more than welcome.

[0] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/6449 and there might
be older discussion in ML

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] install plugin from github
Message-ID: <CAOrcXHH2JaMiQmfMxEbUPq=TcF6HRC6mkTszZnF97y7Lc0OsBg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

could anyone share instructions for installing a plugin from the source
code on github instead of the plugin manager and subsequently making
changes and running the plugin to see the difference?

I've tried cloning the repo to:
C:\Users\hkelley\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\project-packager_dev\python\plugins\qgis-project-packager-plugin
and moved some things around to copy the set up of other installed plugins.

The plugin appears in the "installed" list but doesn't work.

Maybe I need to compile it? but I would have thought for a python only
plugin that wouldn't be necessary.

I've also separately followed the instructions for building a plugin from
scratch using plug in builder and plugin reloader. It's not clear to me how
I would apply those steps to working with an existing plugin.

thanks for any guidance.

Hugh

Hi,

I recommend that you clone the repository somewhere else on your 
computer, and add the path in QGIS settings, in the System > Environment 
variable section, in QGIS_PLUGINPATH (see capture below).

This way you will always be able to put the correct path to the plugin.

Because here for instance with this plugin 
<https://github.com/tarot231/qgis-project-packager-plugin>, if you want 
your method to work, you should put "ProjectPackager" directory in 
C:\...AppData...\python\plugins\, which is one level inside the cloned repo.
(i.e. the plugin directory is the directory where the metadata.txt file 
is, and not the whole directory from the repo).

I also recommend the use of the plugin "Plugin Reloader", so that you 
can reload your python files without quiting/lauching QGIS each time (or 
deactivating/reactivating the plugin).




Regards,

Jacky Volpes

Thank you!

I am also in Den Bosch and so I would love to join the discussion there, 
hopefully with valuable contributions and solutions :))

Awesome that worked perfectly thank you!

I had actually pulled the .py files up into the top level directory to
solve that problem you identify while I was trying to get things running
but obviously that is not the right solution long term.

Dear communitiy,
it is with great pleasure tha I can officially announce that we reached the
goal [1] of bringing the total member contributions up to ?200k per year.
We hope this is only the beginning and the PSC is working hard to get more
large organisation into the sustaining members programm.
We know QGIS is a staple software in many [very] large organisations, we
"just" need to find our way to those.

A first step in that direction has been in the making since some weeks and
we're really pleased to announce our first flagship sustaining member: Felt
You can read all about what Felt does on the announcement blogpost [2]

I'd like to thank Felt and the over 30 other new sustaining members [3] for
their support and trust in QGIS.
I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank all previous and current
supporting members for your help in making QGIS such a successful project
and all community members for all the work and passion you put into QGIS.
It is such an honour to be the chair of such an amazing community.

The crowd-funding call is still open until end of March 2023, so if you
know someone or an institution that would like to join, please forward them
to the crowd-funding page [1]

Have a great day,
cheers
Marco

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Attribute feature widget moves down side when
 placing point layer one by one.
Message-ID: <CAGy7cY=QSky9gp9W6a9TUa1kF8iUMzFabsn5XB48sr7RaJQAjw@mail.gmail.com>

I am placing point feature  one by one and filling attribute, i am facing
problem that attribute filling widget moves slowing towards taskbar
windows. After placing 6 to 8 points it reaches at the end of taskbar.
Again i am placing it at top. Developer please check?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Upcoming Open Standards and Open Software Code
 Sprint
Message-ID: <52f1e7f9-d366-73d6-9ea6-60c51f9e13ae@doublebyte.net>

Good morning,

The Open Standards and Open Software Code Sprint, hosted by OGC, OSGeo 
and ASF? will run from 25 to 27 of April, near Lausanne, Switzerland 
(right after the QGIS Contributor Meeting).

A Code Sprint is a three day hybrid event, where dozens of developers 
from around the world come together to code and share their ideas 
regarding sharing geospatial information. Even if you are not a 
developer, there are lots of ways to be involved in the code sprint, 
without actually writing code; e.g.: testing, documentation, issues. 
This code sprint will include a mentor stream targeted at newcomers, 
which includes an onboarding day with lots of introductory tutorials.

You can find more information, including a registration link in the code 
sprint website: https://developer.ogc.org/sprints/20/

Hope to see you at the code sprint,

All the Best,

Joana

Hi,

It would be great if a QGIS developer with an interest in OGC standards,
esp OGC API features, could participate.

If someone is interested in attending the meeting but would prefer
financial support from QGIS.ORG, please let the PSC know.

Andreas

Hi,

I have 3 models waiting to be reviewed since March the 10th 
(https://plugins.qgis.org/models/unapproved/).? Is anyone responsible 
for reviewing the models? These are updates from 3 previous models but 
since the original had been deleted, the 3 models are no longer 
available to the public. I added the site developers to the email in 
case they have information also.

Thanks

Hi all,

Instead of deleting, would you consider putting the old documentation to a
repository, e.g. Zenodo, so that they are archived for long term? Zenodo
allows up to 50GB for each record and it is free. You can also create a
community page, so that all records are accessible from a single point:
https://zenodo.org/communities/

Best,

Serkan

But with what purpose? These are sites >7GB each of which most information should either be still available in newer doc versions, or only if you would want to use 2.x versions of QGIS...

I fail to want to put extra time into this.

But if you want: I have archived both versions in a zip on  qgis6, and can make them available for you if you want to set this up.
Feel free to contact me directly (richard at qgis is still working if I am correct...).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] access virtual field from virtual layer
Message-ID: <CAOrcXHHB=WAGnPaYo6vQACCotfbKe77O9zFP2uWtjeT4Vt=4Jg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

is it expected that a virtual layer cannot reference a virtual field from
an imported layer?

Using 3.28 if I create a virtual field on a shp sourced layer and then
import that layer into the virtual layer creator dialogue and set the query
to "select * from vfield_layer". the virtual field in the original layer is
not included in the new virtual layer's attribute table.

thanks!

Hugh

Dear All,
  Sorry to interrupt, I'm newer to QGIS, whe I use QIGS, I find that it is so quick for QGIS to parse shapefile even it is a very big file, I try to decode the file by my own with shapelib library, but the result is disappointed, I try to learn it by myself with QGIS source code but failed, so anyone can help point the entry of  decoding process?

Hi,

QGIS is using the GDAL/OGR library to read the shapefiles.

Trying to show the selected tab in another color.  The way it works now, there is no indication the tab is selected other than that different text shows up.  I found one site that mentions using QTabBar::tab:selected, but have not been ale to get it to work.

I can't say why QGIS handles Shapefiles so quickly but I do have experience of reading and writing them for myself. 
I didn't want to use Shapelib - too big and cumbersome so I just added read/write functions to my application and used the ESRI document for reference. It is quite easy to follow but you have to be careful with the endian-ness of the different fields.
Just search for 'ESRI Shapefile format' and you should find their document.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] pandas not included in 3.30.0 RC Windows installer
Message-ID: <AM0PR09MB26282BC07DE12F46A490151888889@AM0PR09MB2628.eurprd09.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

We're developing and maintaining a plugin heavily relying on the Python package 'pandas'.
About ~98% of our users are using Windows.
Pandas was included in the Windows RC and LTR installers versions at least from versions 3.18 to 3.28,
(and probably even before that https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/32212 ).

With the OSGeo4W installer, users had to make sure to python3-pandas was installed by checking the right box themselves,
but this was no issue for us, since we saw this as an installation procedure for more advanced users.

It seems that pandas has been dropped in the 3.30 RC installer.
https://github.com/Deltares/imod-qgis/issues/30#issuecomment-1485262436
Which creates a hurdle for our new users, who are new to QGIS
(more complex installation procedure with the OSGeo4W installer).

My questions therefore are:


  *   Was it a conscious decision to drop the pandas package from the RC installer? Or an accident?
  *   If conscious, what were the reasons to do this? (just out of interest)

Cheers,

Joeri van Engelen

Hi Joeri,

I just checked the OSGeo4W Network installer 
(https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#osgeo4w-installer) 
where pandas it still available:


Grertings,

Hi Benjamin,

Thanks for looking. I also checked today with the RC 3.30.0-2 installation, only to figure out it DID have pandas installed.
I must have overlooked something before. Sorry for the sloppiness on my behalf!

Thanks,

Joeri

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QtCreator QGIS debugging not showing values
Message-ID: <213f96c2-55ef-bae8-3582-5327835c93e7@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Trying to look into one of my own issues (wrong timestep count for mesh layers #48942), I fail to see the values of variables in QtCreator see screendump.
I tried to fiddle with Debuggers (gdb -> lldb), helpers, gdb properties (Load system GDB pretty printers) etc etc. But I fail to see anything. Or getting frequent qgis crashes from withing qtcreator...

Does this 'just work' with others? Or is everybody on Fedora now, or should I learn to debug from terminal :-)?
Any clue for me?

My environment:
Debian testing
Qt 5.15.8
Qt Creator 9.0.2 (based on Qt 6.4.2)
GNU gdb (Debian 13.1-2) 13.1

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

It's a bug in qt creator with newer python versions. See
https://bugreports.qt.io/plugins/servlet/mobile#issue/QTCREATORBUG-28659

There's a patch in that ticket which you can apply (doesn't require
compiling) which resolves it.

Thanks Nyall!

Works!
(after fiddling with patch...)
