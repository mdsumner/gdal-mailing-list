	Report
Message-ID: <CAN-PxszS-qTxEJqVKcGoVKPZO599LkSut9iuiBjiG-LSVwgYug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

This is my report for Week 7 (June 25 - July 1):

What did you get done this week?

   - I continued with bug fixing in parser library (1)
   - I did research on how parameters are divided at this moment and also
   check terminology.

What do you plan on doing next week?

   - Fix bugs in parsing library
   - Resolve terminology differences

Are you blocked on anything?

   - No, at the moment I’m not blocked.

For more see wiki (2)

I'm working on this in the spare time... btw I'm not sure if this is a good
work to do.
I face the problems described by Rudi, because gdal_calc has some
limitations working with not homogeneous rasters... this doe not not affect
the native raster calculalator. BTW raster calculator has a "old" and "not
standard" syntax whilst gdal_calc can use all the numpy power (that's a
really big difference)

adding operators in raster calculator need c++ coding, doing in gdal_calc
is not necessary (numpy is enough)

I know that some power users are stuk to 2.18 for the lack r.calc in grass7
integration in qgis (that seems will be solved soon)

My question (poll) is... does it make sense to patch native raster calc
instead of override gdal_calc limitation?
Make sense to solve raster calculator bug only if these bugs are generic
and does not depend of the specific organization of the raster calculator
GUI.

This is indeed very tricky. Regular QGIS expressions are fine here,
because we can use expression contexts, variables and the like to
expose model parameters to the expression engine and support this
requirement. The raster expression engine however is very limited and
doesn't have any existing way to support this use case.

I personally think this may be the best available approach, which
doesn't require complex changes to the raster expression engine.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS black startup?
Message-ID: <a05db8be-dd63-2506-1c3b-29c37e475867@duif.net>

Hi,

Last days, I experience some strange startup behaviour:

- after starting up, the window of QGIS starts black and stays (at this
moment for 13 seconds) that way. And then starts up fine.
I've also experienced longer times.

I'm not connected at this moment (is QGIS/plugins/locators trying to do
network requests?)...

Ok, it seems network related, turning on wifi (or proxy), QGIS is fine...

Disabling all plugins, still black.
Removing plugins, still black.
Removing all connections and 'recent projects' from Browser/Connection
manager: OK..

It's not fully clear to me what is the problem, but I'm curious if
others experience such behaviour (with current master only)?
Even without network, QGIS should startup fine isn't it, even when
something is requesting network resources?

Sorry for not being more reproducible.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Is there a way to access the list of selected reference layers from within
the `ExpressionWidgetWrapper`? I haven't found any way to do this yet, and
if the list of layers in the widget is different from the layers that gets
passed to `QgsRasterCalculator` (like if new parameters or algorithms get
added to the model) it could lead to strange errors and user confusion. It
might then be best to return `QLineEdit` for the modeler view, like it
already is for `DIALOG_BATCH`?

I've also encountered the issues using gdal_calc with non-homogenous
layers (which is why I started looking at the raster calculator).
Another reason I would like to see the native calc working is because
it runs much faster than having to wrap third-party tools. I've found
gdal is generally not too bad, but my use-case is still to build a
model and loop through it hundreds of times, so every second counts.

My feeling is that it wouldn't take much work to get the raster
calculator at least usable in the modeler at its current level of
functionality. Improving gdal_calc or implementing more powerful
operators in native raster calculator can then be a secondary, more
involved process.

hmmm... working on your test data, btw IMHO raster calculator should be
dropped in favor of a numpy based expressions... we should also consider
the maintenance aspect for the future! raster calculator is not hard to
maintain (harder is the interface to integrate in modeler that the
calculator itself) but it's syntax is really poor.

I didn't investigate how we can import gdal code (that's a python code)
into qgis... or better create a gdal/ogr interface directly to qgis data
(kind of R dataframe access)

Hi Luigi,

> I know that some power users are stuk to 2.18 for the lack r.calc in grass7
> integration in qgis (that seems will be solved soon)

what is greatly missing (in GRASS7) is r.mapcalculator.py, a script
made on top of r.mapcalc that among the other things allowed us to
have in Processing a nice way to use r.mapcalc (because it worked via
normal description files while r.mpalcalc does not, and any attempt to
make it work in Processing was not very succesful).

Are you saying that this script is being ported in GRASS7?

cheers

wrong.

The fix is a pull request that appeared in a later email in this thread, and that has been merged and should be in the latest release.

Is it the same error for what the pull request fixes?

"/Applications/QGIS3.app/Contents/MacOS/grass/etc/colors/grass: Permission denied"

That should be fixed, but GRASS7 still has unresolved problems in the macOS package.  I haven't had time to look at it.

So this does not appear a plugin issue, but a compiliation one; trom the
py console:

from qgis.gui import QgsCodeEditorHTML

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: cannot import name QgsCodeEditorHTML

Any hint?

I fetched and pulled the latest source code for Qgis and it does not

have such a package.

Hi Donald,

you must install libqt5serialport5-dev first (this dependency was
introduces here
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/212cffcab1c93f899b1acd81bda71f7d0fcd8ef8
)

Cheers,
Daniele

There are packages for bionic if that is what you are building on.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS enhancement: export to GeoPDF
Message-ID: <5097db772cdd95a1931132c8545c3ea9@carto.net>

Dear QGIS developers, 

One of our sponsors is asking if there are any ways/plans/upcoming
improvements regarding export to GeoPDFs. 

Specifically of interest are: 

 	* export of georeferenced data (query coordinates)
 	* proper export of the exact same styling from QGIS (the existing OGR
feature styling would be too limited)
 	* ability to toggle layers
 	* ability to query attributes from vector layers
 	* Offer an export similar to the export of DXF (exporting multiple
selected layers or the whole map at once).

Now I know that GDAL/OGR supports generation of PDF, but the styling
options are limited - see also http://www.gdal.org/frmt_pdf.html 

On the other hand, QGIS supports a lot of styling options which wouldn't
be exported correctly when writing to GeoPDF through gdal. 

So here are my questions: 

 	* Is there a dev out there who would be interested in working on it
and who could make a proposal how to properly support GeoPDF for export
from QGIS?
 	* Do you know of any similar QGIS users/clients who would be
interested in co-financing?
 	* Do you have any ideas how to technically solve the issue of
retaining style while also allow the querying of vector features?
Perhaps export as raster to retain style with invisible (transparent)
vector overlays?

Thanks for the discussion! 

Andreas

My initial thoughts:

This would all predominantly need to be done upstream in Qt itself -
adding support for layers etc to the Qt PDF writer. We'll never get an
exact match between QGIS styles and OGR styles, so the ONLY way we can
create PDFs with exact style matches is by extending the Qt
functionality.

Hi Nyall, 

Thanks for your thoughts. 

And how about going through GDAL/OGR and exporting vector layers twice?
One time as raster with styling preserved, and a second time as
invisible vector overlays (e.g. fully transparent but still queryable
(attributes preserved))? 

My fear with upstream qt is, that: 

 	* qt is not geo-aware, but GeoPDFs need to preserve
georeferencing/coordinate system information. Upstream qt may or may not
accept "geo"-improvements to their PDF support. There is a risk they
deny such improvements.
 	* it may be expensive to implement, if we would have to improve qt
 	* it may be slow to get it into qt

Hi Andreas,

I always thought geopdf was a proprietary format? I googled:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPDF
vs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_PDF
Latter an iso spec implemented by several different companies.

I tend to agree that a Qt-path will be cumbersome.
But I think (even a limited) form of generating Geospatial PDF's would
be a very 'nice to have' in QGIS.

The ideas off course would be that styling would stay the same, but
agreeing with Nyall: mapping those styling from our world to pdf world
is a (too) big task I think.

Not sure if is possible to integrate the gdal-frmt_pdf more into QGIS?
Or: put money/energy in the gdal driver so it can handle for example
sld-styling rules per layer?
In that way the driver could be usefull for other GFOSS projects (like
mapserver etc) too?
Mmm, from http://www.gdal.org/frmt_pdf.html
You need gdal build with special (pdf)libs, gdal is not build by default
with those...

@nyall: would it be possible to create a (transparent) raster per layer
and use those for (Qt) pdf's? In that way a QGIS user would be able to
create multiple 'layers' in a pdf?


Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

If you do exactly as you mention, that would be confusing for the users as in 
the layer tree they would see 2 layers, one rasterized, and the other one with 
the vector. But technically in PDF you can mix raster and vector in the same 
layer, so, in theory, you could add the invisible vector overlays in the same 
layer as the raster info.
I believe the GDAL PDF writer could be extended to do that. You would need to 
provide it with some configuration with a description of a layer hierarchy, 
and for each layer its raster (or rasterized vector) and vector components.

If you have many vector layers, the size of the PDF and the drawing time could 
become quite big with that approach though

There could be some difficulties with ponctual symbols. QGIS would have to 
describe them as polygons with some extent so that they can be clicked on.

Can QGIS generate rasterized vector with proper alpha component ? Testing 
quickly the export of a vector layer to PDF with rasterization, the generated 
image doesn't contain an alpha mask.

GeoPDF is a trademark of TerraGo for the OGC GeoPDF Encoding Best Practice 
Version 2.2 (08-139r3):
http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=40537
GDAL can read and generate that encoding. One downside though is that I 
remember that some versions of the TerraGo toolbar refused to recognize the 
geospatial info from GDAL generated PDF because they were not signed by 
TerraGo key (technical measure to create a monopoly). Maybe this has changed.

Another implementation is Adobe Supplement to ISO 32000:
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/adobe_supplement_iso32000.pdf

Debian and Ubuntu GDAL builds link against Poppler so you have everything what 
is needed from a GDAL point of view. Actually for creation-only of PDF, GDAL 
does it 'at hand', so doesn't even require those libraries. It needs them for 
reading or for in place editing, like adding georeferencing to an existing 
file.

Hi!

I'm using QGIS Version 2.18 and I try to change the classification mode via python from "Continuous" to "Equal interval".
I found out there is "setClassificationMode" for version 3. Is there anyhow a possibility to change this in version 2.18 ?

Sorry I was unclear if you were referring to the Qt package being 
unable, or complete packages for bionic full install of Qgis.

The qgis2web code could be adapted, though of course it doesn't handle every
possible style.

I like this idea of "hybrid" vector/raster layers (both types in one
layer). I am aware that the file-size would be bloated. But on the other
hand for some layer styles compression would work very well. 

In an ideal world, QGIS could examine layer styles and decide what could
be exported as vectors only, because the style, e.g. is only simple
fills and strokes and what layer styles would have to be rasterized. 

The other open question is what would happen with labels - would they be
rasterized as well? What about layer hierarchy? QGIS always draws labels
on top of any other layer, but PDF does not ...

agreed this is yet another issue we would come across. I wonder what
ArcGIS/Geomedia is doing in such cases? 

Even - would you be interested in working on this - perhaps together
with another QGIS dev who knows QGIS rendering internals very well? 

Thanks and greetings,

Could be an option indeed

Text rendering is rather difficult in PDF, and the GDAL PDF driver only 
supports super minimalistic rendering of it (Latin1 characters only), so yes, 
labels would have to be rasterized

> What about layer hierarchy? QGIS always draws labels
> on top of any other layer, but PDF does not ...

You could create a separate PDF layer hiearchy with (rasterized) labels only 
that would be drawn in last.

Actually you don't need to create separate PDF layers. In PDF, there is a main 
drawing stream, that is followed sequentially, and in that stream, you can tag 
objects as belonging to some layer, so you could possibly have a drawing 
stream like the following where text are drawn in last (that's more or less 
what the GDAL PDF writer currently does when it is rendering text itself)

always drawn background raster
<raster_layer>
	raster image
</raster_layer>
<vector_layer_1>
	vector content of layer 1 (rasterized with transparency)
</vector_layer_1>
<vector_layer_2>
	vector content of layer 2 (rasterized with transparency)
</vector_layer_2>
<vector_layer_1>
	labels of layer 1 (rasterized with transparency)
</vector_layer_1>
<vector_layer_2>
	labels of layer 2 (rasterized with transparency)
</vector_layer_2>

> agreed this is yet another issue we would come across. I wonder what

I have seen a number of ESRI generated geospatial PDFs, that have PDF layers, 
part of them raster only, others vectors only, but the vector content was just 
drawing not using the 'structured vector' capabilities.

I have one sample though where the vector objects are using structured vector. 
Interestigly when identifying a punctual symbol, the 'ghost' that is drawn to 
mark the selection is a square approximately located at the drawing, so it is 
likely that they use the approach you suggested: they don't necessarily 
rasterize the vector, but the vector drawings aren't necessarily the same as 
the vector identifiable objects. As on attached screenshot, where you can see 
the red ghost square that reprents the selection made by the 'Object data 
tool' and on the left the corresponding attributes, but it is roughly 
positionned with respect to the actual black symbol of the cemetery.

Possibly yes. There is a clear boundary between the GDAL side and the QGIS 
side.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] outdated cookbook
Message-ID: <8d9c820b-1acc-6623-6546-1f595f0ff0bc@terglobo.nl>

Hi all,

I'm working on a qgis3 plugin, and want it to export my map as a png 
image. According to the cookbook it should go like this:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/composer.html#simple-rendering

But QgsMapRenderer has been removed in v3, so I will need other code for 
this. I have been trying all kinds of stuff, using QgsMapRendererJob and 
QgsMapRendererSequentialJob but I cannot get it to work.
Even worse, qgis crashes all the time while I'm trial-and-erroring this.

Can anyone provide a working example for exporting maps to png files?

I'd be happy to work on updating the cookbook, for example during the 
Foss4g Europe code sprint in 2 weeks. But I will need some input from 
the people knowing the new object model.

Kind regards,
Raymond

Probably not a nice example for the cookbook, but this does the job and even
works alike on 2 and 3 (essentially what QgisApp::saveAsImage does):

c = iface.mapCanvas()
pm = QPixmap(c.width(), c.height())
c.saveAsImage("/tmp/foo.png", pm)

Hello everyone,

I need your help.

I have generated an image from a wms, i did it with this code, is a transparent
background image and generates the pgw at the same time. The
background of the image is transparent, because I need to place it on
another layer, the problem is that when making the assembly it looks
choppy and can not be seen clearly

I have also tried this even with the composer of impressions and the
same thing happens.

The loaded layer is a wms.

I'd appreciate your help,

Hi,

There is a problem only in GeoPackage layers.

I have realized that when you put any expression in Provider feature filter
(like "id" > 1), Layer is loaded successfully according to filter.

On the other hand, identifying any feature on this layer, gives wrong
results. There is a sequence shift.

Without filter on the layer, identifying results are OK.

In Girona version there is no problem.  This problem is occuring after Bonn
version.

Olcay Ebcin

Hi Olcay,

Maybe you can add a small test dataset and project to the issue?

So it is easier for dev's to (re)test?
It also adds 'weight' to an issue if others also have this problem (aka
it can be reproducibly confirmed).

Thanks

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,
I just encountered the same issue trying to build QGIS 3.2 using gcc 4.8.5
on RHEL 7. Has there been any progress on solving this? I really need to get
QGIS 3 running on RHEL7...

Regards,
David

Message-ID: <CABPxTTpJm+3D3-enLmv-gK1M8x_r8+ijd5LoC-74qzveaS5VRg@mail.gmail.com>

In the "GPS Information" panel for QGIS 2 there are two tabs. One of Signal
strength and the other for "Satellite." The QGIS 3 implementation drops the
"Satellite" tab and the "Signal" tab shows nothing. Are there plans to
properly implement these two functions?

I am using QGIS 3.2.0 on Windows.

Message-ID: <CABPxTTqL0nOxr7zD79HkdyQwhoa1_Mta0JBkmWbv+=Mhs5caEg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to convert one of my Shape Tools algorithms to a processing
algorithm. My existing input layer either accepts a point vector layer or a
NoGeometry table. I was guessing that the proper way to implement this is:

self.addParameter(
    QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource(
        self.PrmInputLayer,
        'Input layer',
        [QgsProcessing.TypeFile, QgsProcessing.TypeVectorPoint])
)

TypeFile seems to do nothing. It certainly does not show the CSV file I
have loaded that has no geometry. It filters the files so that only point
layers are available. Interestingly if I use just TypeFile it seems to
select all vector layer types.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <A87E66F06E86F14B857F2EB047CDF9322E8A514F@prdassexch01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi all

I am looking for guidance on documentation.

The help for the delimited text provider has largely got lost between versions 2 and 3.  In version 3 is defined in

QgsHelp::openHelp( QStringLiteral( "managing_data_source/opening_data.html#importing-a-delimited-text-file" ) );

This links to the QGIS documentation now (after I fixed the url) but that is very brief.

In version 2 this served as reference documentation for the provider, including documentation on the url for constructing programmatically as well as the GUI information.  While this is too much information for many users I would like it to go somewhere
This could certainly be broken up into a number of cross referenced items.

So I am wondering where this should go now!  And what I need to do to get it there.

Thanks
Chris

TypeFile is not correct here - from the docs, TypeFile = "Files (i.e.
non map layer sources, such as text files)". There's actually no way
to show only Point layers OR Geometry-less tables. The closest is
TypeVector, which will show all vector sources, including
points/line/polygons AND no geometry tables.

But -- I'd question why you'd want to restrict your algorithm inputs
to Point/NoGeometry only in the first place. If your algorithm can
work with NoGeometry tables, it should also work with inputs with
Lines and Polygon geometries, and just ignore those. Otherwise you're
putting an artificial limitation on the inputs which can be used,
which is sure to annoy users somewhere down the line!

Not currently. This was a big blocker during the early transition to
Qt5 in the beginning of QGIS 3.0 development. The graph widget used to
show the satellite tab (QwtPolar) is no longer developed and doesn't
work with Qt5. In the end (after much deliberation) the satellite page
was temporarily removed from QGIS 3.0 so that we could move on with
development. And then it turned out that no-one complained and no-one
was interested in actually doing the work implementing a replacement
OR funding a developer to do this, so the feature was completely
dropped.

If someone wants to fund/develop a replacement it will gladly be resurrected!

Following the conversation from
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/89d4998 , this is an announcement
to notify that the PyQgsOfflineEditingWFS and the WFS Provider test
are on final notice and about to be blacklisted from the Travis CI
infrastructure.

Work has been underway to remove "noisy" tests from Travis which cause
false alarms and these tests regularly fail for unrelated changes.
False alarms are bad as they undermine confidence in the CI results
and encourage contributors to ignore the test results.

These tests are consistently failing (about 30% of the time) for
unrelated changes.

If you're interested in seeing these tests continue as part of the CI
infrastructure here are some examples of typical random failures these
tests encounter:

Those tests have been warned...

In other words what stage of development is Qgis 3.0 expected to be at

As a related question how many bugs do you expect to fix for each

Hi Patrick,

QGIS 3.x has major changes under the hood:

- Change from qt4 to qt5

- QGIS internal API changes

- Change from Python 2 to Python 3

- Completely rewritten: QGIS server, Print composer/layouts, Processing

- All Python plugins have to be changed and adopted to the above listed 
changes

With so many changes it is only expected that new issues and problems 
arise with the introduction of QGIS 3. That's why QGIS 3 is named "early 
adopter release". On the other hand the devs, and also co-funded by 
QGIS.ORG, invested a lot of time in fixing issues. And maybe you have 
noticed that QGIS 3.2 doesn't have this label any more.

Version 3.4 is planned as an LT release. 3.4 is scheduled for end of 
October. See 
https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html#release-schedule

So with 3.4 we expect to be on  a stable, at least as good (but most 
likely much better) than 2.18, which is our previous LT release. If you 
are cautious and need to rely on stable versions, I recommend rolling 
out 3.4 after one or two bug fix releases, so maybe at the end of year 2018.

However, I personally used version 3.x for quite a long time and I am 
quite happy with it. Also note, that you can always install and use QGIS 
2.x and 3.x in parallel.

---------------

As to your other question: "when do you expect to have made major 
inroads into the bugs backlog":

This is a hard question. The bug queue will never be empty and always 
contain open issues. On the other hand, there are also issues in the 
queue that are hard or impossible to reproduce and the bug reporter did 
not provide enough information to fix the issues.

The QGIS.ORG project is investing a five-figure Euro investment (usually 
15-40k €) for each release to pay a few core developers to fix the most 
pressing issues. We do realize that this is not enough, but it is the 
best we can do with the limited funds. To help improve the situation, we 
encourage users of QGIS to do either of the following:

- help improve the quality of bug reports (really, it can help a lot if 
bug reporters do an effort to describe the issues well enough to 
reproduce, including data and a project file

- become a sponsor (see 
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/sponsorship/sponsorship.html#qgis-sponsorship-program 
and 
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/about/sponsorship.html#sponsors-and-donors 
for our list of current sponsors, ideally with an annual renewal commitment

- become a one-time donor

- establish a support contract with a company, preferable with a company 
that has core QGIS commiters. See 
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/commercial_support.html#core-contributors 
- with such a contract you can prioritize

- hire a developers to specifically fix the issues you have (or if you 
have the skills, you can fix issues yourself)

Or any combination of the above. If a large enough number of users 
supports us in one or more of the above ways, I am sure we can keep QGIS 
in a good shape for many years to come.

It is the users who decide about the fate of QGIS. If the users stop to 
support QGIS, QGIS will die. If enough users will support QGIS, it will 
thrive, as I think it did in the past couple years.

Hope this information helps,

Greetings from Andreas
(QGIS PSC member)

Hi again, Patrick,

Some other thoughts:

I recently visited the SWISS PGDAY (organized by Swiss PostgreSQL user 
group). The very interesting keynote was by Bruce Momjian - a long time 
core contributor of PostgreSQL.

The title of the keynote was "Will PostgreSQL live forever?"

Some answers to this hard to answer question are:

- Forever, is a long time ;-)

- It is up to the users and developers to decide whether PostgreSQL 
stays relevant or will be made irrelevant by other

- there is no management that decides it. It is the users who decide it.

- the good news is: as Open Source organizations we are not at the mercy 
of financial investors or have to react to quarterly statements. This 
makes us, much much more likely to live longer than commercial alternatives.

- commercial companies: if the owners/investors got enough money out of 
the product they may loose interest or decide that a new feature a 
customer demands costs only money and not bring enough profit. So, it is 
the owners and the management of the product who decide what gets into 
the product, whereas with OpenSource the users and developers have more 
power over such decisions.

- the other good news is: neither PostgreSQL nor QGIS can be bought by 
another company (only the companies of the core contributors can be 
bought). Luckily, in neither project a single company has too much power 
over development of the projects. If one company ceases or is bought and 
shut-down, there are plenty of other devs and companies who can take 
over - if the users want that.

- in worst case scenarios, projects can still be forked

Greetings,

Andreas

Basically, docs sources are in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation
repository and clicking the "Fix Me" link at the bottom of any online doc
page should bring you to the page source.
we have also set some guidelines at
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/documentation_guidelines/index.html
if you want more details but the docs team remains available if you need
some particular help.

-
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/supported_data.html#delimited-text-files
- and somewhere in the PyQGIS cookbook but I don't know the logic of
structuring this document and it does not really get updates for 3, yet.
Maybe somewhere around

Hope that helps, otherwise feel free to ask.

Hi thanks for your comment

Whilst aware of issues with 3.x I have migrated most of my projects to 
it as it seems to be stable enough for everyday work. I am considering 
installing the development build onto one of my computers.

I also migrated all the shapefiles to geopackage as this appears to be 
stable enough for production work as well. Since there have been 
problems lately using shapefiles over a SMB network we hope the 
Geopackage database works more stably over a network.

So far so good - just aware we don't seem to be having much conversation 
on the redmine site lately :):):)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Touch screen button: what determins it's
	availability?
Message-ID: <c251df91-1ea3-9459-873a-fb6824fd3eab@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

I've been working on windows machines without touch screens where I had
the little 'touch'-button next to the 'pan'-button.
I (think) I never had that button on my Linux builds earlier on.

BUT... now I have a laptop with a touch screen :-) AND I wanted to try
that button/touch-pan (in combi with super full screen :-) ).

But I cannot find a cmake prop to enable/disable it.

So question: what determines the availability of the touch tool?
I'm happy to test/fix stuff if I'm the first one who has this urge...
Any hint appreciated.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi, I tried your lines here on Debian 9.4/testing/ in a python3 console:

>>> import subprocess
>>> subprocess.call(['python','-m','install','pyxform','--user'])
/usr/bin/python: No module named install
1
>>> subprocess.call(['python','-m','pip','install','pyxform','--user'])
/usr/bin/python: No module named pip
1

Ah, but with Debian we have python and python 3, so I tried:
subprocess.call(['python3','-m','pip','install','pyxform','--user'])
...
Installing collected packages: argparse, linecache2, traceback2, six,
unittest2, formencode, unicodecsv, xlrd, pyxform
Successfully installed argparse-1.4.0 formencode-1.3.1 linecache2-1.0.0
pyxform-0.11.3 six-1.11.0 traceback2-1.4.0 unicodecsv-0.14.1
unittest2-1.1.0 xlrd-1.1.0
0
Works! \o/
Not sure if (from within python) you can find out what the name of the
python executable is...

For QGIS2 we earlier recommended to just add the full module into your
plugin package. (if possible, aka python-only module).

There has also been discussion about using pip for python modules, by
adding the 'pip install line' as a separate metadata.txt line.
In that way we could either let users install it (in their global or
user env), or maybe later do this programatically.

There are questions/discussions/options:
- how to handle clashing specific versions of the same module between
different plugins
- where to install modules: installation system wide, in one QGIS
virtual environment (venv) or in a venv per plugin
- security questions (mostly a Linux discussion: should a distribution
rely on venv's or only install distribution modules)... etc

Your idea is (to me) new :-)
If working platform independently and full proof, I think it is an
interesting option!

Now with QGIS3 we have true separated profiles, we an idea would be to
add a virtual environment PER profile, so all plugins can install
modules in that environment (using your trick?), and in case of a clash
can then create 2 profiles for those plugins/modules.
Not sure though this is feasible for all OS's. I think it will be
easiest on Linux...

Others?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

thanks for raining this issue and to provide this beautiful solution.

Actually having plugin with external python lib dependencies was/is
tricky especially for windows system (in my experience)

Thanks,
In OS X following works:
subprocess.call(['pip3','install','pyxform'])

Does same works  works for Ubuntu/linux also?


for windows, I am assuming 'python' refers to python 3 inside QGIS3.

Yep:

import subprocess
subprocess.call(['pip3','install','pyxform','--user'])

works too.

But as said, not sure if all distro's call the python3 pip: pip3 (and/or
python3). I still would be afraid to force a specific version of a
module, as I would be afraid to override some excisting one.
I do like your solution though, the libs end up in my user site-packages
dir:
/home/richard/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages


Ah: http://zetcode.com/lang/python/introspection/
>>> import sys
>>> sys.executable
'/usr/bin/python3'

gives you your actual python exe...

I wonder if you can create an venv from within QGIS in the subprocess way.
Mmm, this works (from within QGIS):

>>> import sys
>>> py_exe = sys.executable
>>> venv_path =
'/home/richard/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/venv'
>>> subprocess.call([py_exe,'-m','venv', venv_path])

Had to install python3-venv though:
sudo apt-get install python3-venv

sourcing it does not work with me:

>>> subprocess.call(['source', venv_path+'/bin/activate'])
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'source'

Now somebody with more knowledge of the different python-path/lib-dir's
should come in, to tell us if this is usable after activating that venv...

Not sure if this would work with the already running python interpreter
in QGIS...

Idea's?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

I added this to my code just 3 days ago :)

import sys

try:
    import matplotlib
except:
    import subprocess
    print('installing matplotlib')
    subprocess.call([sys.exec_prefix + '/python', "-m", 'pip',
'install', 'matplotlib'])
    import matplotlib
    print('installation completed')


I dont know if it is a better or worse solution, I've only tested it on a
Windows machine with the standalone version and the osgeo4w installation.

I tried calling sys.executable first, instead of sys.exec_prefix +
'/python', which resulted in a new qgis window started :)

Rather than using a subprocess and needing to figure out which pip/python
etc., have you tried importing and using the pip module directly? Something
like:

import sys

try:
    import matplotlib
except:
    import pip    pip.main(['install', 'matplotlib'])    import matplotlib

It does not work in python console of QGIS.
pip have __main__() methot that too for internal use.

Message-ID: <38497AD9CA059C42AA3451EFEFF0378E014A561C02@P2KITMBX04WC02.unicph.domain>

Hi,
Using QGIS 3.2 I suddenly get a lot of crashes  - and I´m trying to figure out what might cause the problem.
Is it the plugin or is it my data or ...
Now I would like to send a bug report, but I have forgot my username and password - silly me.

I don´t get any help at the login page and I can´t find help anywhere else - so the simplest thing would be just forgetting to make a report. I´m sure most people would think so.

If we want bug reporting from ordinary users - then me have to use another user friendly platform eg GitLab.

I do know it´s not a simple thing to change system - but this is an issue that need to be taken serious!

Regards

Password recovery was not enabled - because it doesn't work with OSGeo IDs.

As we now also have local/internal accounts I now enabled it and also added a
pointer where to manage OSGeo IDs.

My mistake. Importing pip is not supported and this functionality has been
removed in pip>=10

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Improve GRASS GIS integration in QGIS 3 - Week 8
	Report
Message-ID: <CAN-PxsxQmx94Do9zRGz2JWN0uG+G8s0sYwVKK-8c-p7maLTjVw@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi All,

This is my report for Week 8 (July 2 - July 8):

What did you get done this week?

   - Unfortunately, I was all week on camp with my sports team, there was
   no electricity and the internet. So I was not able to work on the project,
   I hope I will be able to catch up with the delay next week.

What do you plan on doing next week?

   - Fix bugs in parsing library
   - Resolve terminology differences

Are you blocked on anything?

   - No, at the moment I’m not blocked.

For more see wiki (1)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problems running 3.2/3.3
Message-ID: <bd647fd3-3c0e-4465-f033-097e834b7b2c@gmail.com>

Good day all

I have Qgis 3.3 latest master installed on a desktop and a virtual 
machine. The desktop is running Debian 9.3 and the virtual machine is 
running Debian 9.4

The VM runs 3.3 as a new install and has no problems running it, 
everything seems to work normally.

The desktop has a lot of problems running 3.3 or 3.2 with the same 
issues in both. It was upgraded from 3.0 which it had no difficulties with.

The main issues seen are:

* only a few layers can be displayed at a time. It will not display all 
the layers at once.

* attempting to save a geopackage produces error messages like the ones 
below

2018-07-09T02:16:08     CRITICAL    Layer wmwtWL : OGR error changing 
geometry: feature 12 not found
2018-07-09T02:16:08     CRITICAL    Layer wmwtWL : OGR error changing 
geometry: feature 13 not found
2018-07-09T02:16:08     CRITICAL    Layer wmwtWL : OGR error changing 
geometry: feature 84 not found
2018-07-09T02:16:08     CRITICAL    Layer wmwtWL : OGR error committing 
transaction: COMMIT transaction failed: cannot commit - no transaction 
is active

and it undoes all the changes in the map canvas so they are all lost. 
there are no permissions issue as project files can be saved fine.

The desktop has very little other software on it except Gimp 2.9 
(AppImage) and Gimp 2.10 (Flatpak) on it and it's a complete mystery to 
me how there could be any other software on this computer that might 
conflict with Qgis.

Any ideas?

Hi Dev's,

somebody added the 'dependabot' on our repo's?

https://github.com/dependabot

It is asking for updated permissions:
	Read-only access to Checks

And I'm wondering if somebody is looking into it,
or it is corporate spam (dependabot.COM)..

Happy to update permissions, if a dev asks though...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Look like yet another weird and wonderful problem that goes away if you 
dump your config settings and start again. Which messes my head up.

Hi @Rudi von Staden <rudivs at gmail.com> , @Nyall Dawson
<nyall.dawson at gmail.com> and @Matthias Kuhn <matthias at opengis.ch>

in the meantime I had to resolve compilation problems and OS update I'll
show you what I'm doing to resurrect rastercalculator in modeler trying to
evaluate if I'm doing well.

the principal problem (but not the only one) to run raster calculator in a
modeler is to map input value to the formula. This is a generic problem
that can be applied to any algorithm that need to map input in something
internal to the algorithm.

The main problems is that the algorithm context scope hadn't information to
allow this mapping. I added:

context.setExpressionContext(expContext);
here
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/processing/models/qgsprocessingmodelalgorithm.cpp#L276
and naming the createExpressionContextScopeForChildAlgorithm scope
"algorithm_inputs" (actually the added scope does not have name, because
was not necessary)

and add this mapping in ::variablesForChildAlgorithm
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/processing/models/qgsprocessingmodelalgorithm.cpp#L431
with value:
<var name>: <maplayer instance>
In this moment only <var name>_[extent] variable are added in this context
scope

the idea, in the processAlgorithm python part, is to get the expression
context from ProcessingContext and substitude <var name> with <maplayer
source> in the formula that will be executed by QgsRasterCalculator

conceptually it works, but many other problems in context and parameter
settings are present that seems they are more generic modeler problems I'm
still trying to solve and reproduce them)

What I'm not sure is to use the expressionContext to store this information
instead of a different or new contextScope. the advantages is that the new
input parameters are available in the expression editor because available
in the context.

as soon as I can I'll give you a PR where to talk about real code... in
this moment I doing tests if my approach is (almost) correct and finding
all limitation using these pathces in simple test models

Thanks Jurgen!

That kind of works for my current problem (though it seems hard to loop 
this function and export different maps after updating the mapcanvas).

Still I would like to fix this in the cookbook using the 
QgsMapRenderer(Sequential)Job in the right way. So if anyone could post 
a working example??

Thanks!
Raymond

As a general observation with my experiences so far with 3.2 and the 
current master it looks they can have a lot of problems with 3.0 
configs. Another issue observed on a different computer is completely 
random and frequent crashes for no obvious reason.

Hi,
Finally I found following solution, which works in both windows and mac:


import subprocess
try:
        subprocess.call(['python3', '-m', 'pip', 'install','pyxform'])
        from pyxform.builder import create_survey_element_from_dict
        print('package is installed after python3')
    except:
        subprocess.call(['python3', '-m', 'pip',
'install','pyxform','--user'])
        print ("after python3 --user call")
        try:
            from pyxform.builder import create_survey_element_from_dict
        except:
            print('not able to install pyxform, install mannually')

   - First 'subprocess.call' works in Mac without permission issue.
   - Second 'subprocess.call' works in windows without permission issue.

Can anybody tries this code in ubuntu/linux and verify.


Thanks


If somebody can test this in other platform, I would be very glad.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Server 3: change on queryable groups?
Message-ID: <99b22993-8491-4773-6153-e6c42071729a@servus.at>

Hi devs,

I recently migrated from QGIS Server 2 to 3 (a big thanks to all the
devs!) and I noticed one change with queryable parameters which means
quite a lot of work to migrate my projects:

In QGIS Server 2 layer groups had the "queryable" parameter showing up
on GetCapabilities request. That makes it easy to apply GetFeatureInfo
to the group without iterating over all its layers.

In QGIS Server 3 layer groups don't have the "queryable" parameter. So I
need to call GetFeatureInfo on all its layers but not on the layer group.

Is there any reason for this change or any configuration I missed?

I think the queryable parameter makes sense and is compatible with the
OCG WMS sepecification, which states:

"7.2.4.7.2 Queryable layers:
The Boolean attribute queryable indicates whether the server supports
the GetFeatureInfo operation on that Layer. A server may support
GetFeatureInfo on some of its layers, but need not support it on all
layers."

Thanks for everything
Gerald

 Thanks for that explanation. I guess the satellite tab is more for
curiosity than actual value.

The "Signal" tab is there but apparently does not work. That one is useful.
Are there any comments about it?

Thanks!!!

The function I am working with is the XY to Line utility which expects each
record in the data to have two location points. This could be in the form
of just a NoGeometry table with two coordinates as part of the fields or it
could be a point layer with one of the points represented by the layer
geometry and the other within the table data. I guess I will need to open
it up to include Lines and Polygons, but I don't think the source of this
data would ever be a line or polygon, but who knows what users may do.

When I launch the original Qt Designer it has the QGIS custom widgets in

3.0.0 custom widgets" there are not any QGIS custom widgets displayed. How
do I fix this? I am still using the QGIS 2.x Qt Designer link for my 3.0

Just taking a step back here -- is this something we actually want to
support/allow in plugins?

Seems to me like it opens the door for all sorts of security issues.

Not sure what's happening with this one -- I don't have a receiver
which reports the information required for this graph, so can't
diagnose what's happening here or if it's working as expected.

I don't think so. Since all plugins goes through approval mechanism, I
think  it is not unsafe. Rather increase the plugin user base.
Even if we want to not allow this .In that case, We should have mechanism
by which QGIS itself does installation of external dependencies based on
approved plugin's metadata.
 It will ease the life of plugin developers for sure.

@shiva: the 'approval mechanism' is done by humans, and a lot of work,
as there are a lot of dev releasing small changes of their plugins...
So I would not count on that for security.
We have been talking about running some (security) rules over the plugin
sources before approval, but... nobody implemented it yet.

@nyall: as I said earlier in this thread, we have been talking about
adding the pip-command in the metadata.txt. That is better, yes?

I agree with you, Shiva's way has some security issues, but I was
thinking that we could do a grep on the sources of a plugin
automatically, to search for the subprocess line, and check if something
else then pip is called?
It IS a friendly way of installing (well, as we keep it in user space...).
If we could make it being installed in a QGIS Virtual Env or even in a
venv per plugin that would be safer?

Others?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Nyall,

if you want to have a receiver "without having a receiver" you could use
this recipe: https://www.itopen.it/use-your-android-phones-gps-in-qgis/

And when we do I think we will probably be chasing our tails a lot….

Doesn’t that just move the issue to a different place. The fact is you can put anything you like in PyPi including some nefarious module that does rm -rf on your file system, then just pull it in from the metadata.txt requirements list and run it. So I dont think we gain anything.

There are many other valid uses of using subprocess (e.g. running some gdal command) so I don’t think that gains us much either.

The venv thing we discussed in the past there are issues (Martin can fill in blanks here too as he was part of the discussion):

* For a true ’sandbox for plugins’ solution, the QGIS python interpreter and the one used by the plugin need to be the same otherwise you cannot use the API.

* Plugins should be able to use code from each other and build on each other (e.g. processing plugins) so they should be able to import each other’s modules. Or maybe we should make a rule that we dont support this.

* Env’s should be per-plugin so that two plugins could have different listed dependency versions which goes against the above point

I think the whole thing is too messy other than perhaps having one global (or one per profile) based venv with has system modules included from QGIS python lib.

My preferred solution is till to in time to refine the plugins to ‘official’ and ‘unofficial’ plugins. Official plugins would undergo some formal (paid? Manual?) detailed code review and are accepted as safe. Apple does this in their walled garden (no doubt with lots of automation) and though many FOSS people complain about walled gardens, there are valid, good reasons for their existence. We could also provide the ‘Wild West’ garden for unofficial / unreviewed plugins so that nobody loses out…

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3.2 Connection Oracle very slow
Message-ID: <CAGvsbY7UNadyFS=yVdaCSUBzqN=2aHbGhESOb=aHsu1r_jatTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi developers,
We are testing QGIS 3.2 and we see that the connection to Oracle is very
slow and the connection did not end ...
Is this a known error?

if we use QGIS 2.18 the connection is good and fast.
OS: Windows

Hi Raymond!

Try the following snippet in the console - it will render the
currently selected layer and save it as a PNG file:

layer = iface.activeLayer()

settings = QgsMapSettings()
settings.setOutputSize(QSize(512,512))
settings.setExtent(layer.extent())
settings.setLayers([layer])

job = QgsMapRendererSequentialJob(settings)
job.start()
job.waitForFinished()
img = job.renderedImage()
img.save("/tmp/rendered.png")

When you call job.start(), it will start rendering in background and
immediately return. That's why you need to call job.waitForFinished()
to block your code until the final image is ready. This approach has a
downside that it blocks the main thread and therefore the GUI will be
blocked until rendering has finished. If you would like to avoid this
blocking, after job.start() you could have a slot that would listen to
finished() signal coming from "job" - and save the image there. This
approach makes the code a bit more complex, but the GUI does not get
blocked and you can even start multiple jobs at a time in parallel.

Cheers
Martin

Message-ID: <7ca5310c-276b-8679-419f-098b92bf78ef@satelligence.com>

Hi all,

since https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7383 and 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7384 were merged, qgis crashes with a 
segfault when rendering a 2-band byte raster. A sample tif is attached. 
When opening and enabling this raster, qgis immediately crashes.

If you need more info, please let me know. I'm more than happy to debug 
or test things.

Best,
Vincent.

Message-ID: <1728059.JWhYYTJfAc@debian>

Hi All,

There is a conflict between the "Refresh" action and Plugin Reloader - both 
wants to use the F5 shortcut. 

I'm going to set the Plugin Reloader to use Ctrl-F5 and leave F5 for 
"Refresh", as it's a built-in function, known for years and designed for 
everyone, not just plugin devs. However... Maybe there is a common agreement 
that the plugin reloading is more important? ;) I don't know anybody 
refreshing the view frequently, while reloading plugins is a key action for 
all plugin devs. Actually I'll immediately swap those shortcuts in all my 
installations, and probably many plugin devs will do the same. 

Anyway, I suppose F5 should stay for map reloading (unfortunately), but if 
anybody thinks otherwise, please let me know.

Regards,

Borys

Hi Borys,

Good decision to let the preference to builtin functions for all the
users out there. Devs will soon enough get used to Ctrl+F5.

If you feel like doing something fancy, open up a MessageBox at the
first launch of the plugin and inform devs about the shortcut and maybe
even offer a button to quickly toggle for your friends and you ;) Or if
you don't like message boxes, put the same onto the config page,
everybody goes there once in a while ;)

Regards

Matthias

A couple months ago the GeoServer PSC received a donation ... to put
towards SLD + QGIS Interoperability.

Here is a thought how to proceed:

1) Issue a "RFP" with attached dollar amount, we can ask for additional
funds as part of the blog post if any sponsors are interested
2) Literally expect proposals on our wiki page 
3) Select a proposal in one of our PSC meetings, the result of which
would be a small contract much how OSGeo SAC operates. 

Thoughts?

Hi all,

I've just filed a new QEP, intended to be a "gathering point" for
discussion relating to unified approaches to temporal/animation
handling within QGIS:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/128

This is a very early prototype only, so please, if you have any

QGIS, then please comment on the proposal!

work for you with the 2-band byte tif I attached?

cheers,

Hi Nyall,

A QEP for Server is probably linked to your QEP:

Add WMS Time support in QGIS server

Perfect, thanks. I've updated #128 to reflect that server is also a

Hi Vincent

I have tried on master branch again and I do not get crash with the
2-band tif file you have attached anymore. Which code revision is
shown in the about box of QGIS in your build?

Cheers
Martin

There is another issue relative to F5 button. In database manager, it is
supposed to run the Query, but I have never seen it work, neither on Ubuntu
or Windows. Has anyone been confonted to the same issue ?

Hi Martin,

You're right, it's working correctly now. Sorry for the noise.
(I'm using both qgis2 and 3 side by side, by having a different install 
prefix for qgis3. However, in my hurry to recompile from scratch I 
deleted all my ccmake files and forgot to set the alternative install 
prefix when configuring again, so qgis3 was picking up my old libs.)

thanks again!
Vincent.

Message-ID: <fbf5c08d-aae3-c257-7f10-fbd1b45011df@gmail.com>

Good day

As we all know, Qgis 3 has this new capability to cache raster layers. 
This seems to work quite well except if you have a lot of rasters, it 
seems to run out of steam after a while. When that happens, it causes 
all sorts of interesting outcomes with other layers randomly appearing 
and disappearing.

Is there any documentation or descriptions online somewhere of the 
intentions to be achieved with this capability that can allow for 
consideration of possible ways of addressing issues.

	backports
Message-ID: <CAB28Asg-oG6kNjEt94Sm1jYCpLr0ba4pz_gxsv=VR7V_ggCsVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

This is a gentle request to please please pay very special attention
when backporting fixes to 2.18, and assess carefully whether those
fixes are REALLY necessary in the stable LTR branch. Unfortunately the
last couple of 2.18 patch releases have seen some serious regressions
introduced as a result of backported fixes, which really harms the
reputation of QGIS' stability.

It's no-ones fault, because we ALL make mistakes and create
regressions... but I think at this stage we should tighten up 2.18 now
to only mission critical, very clearly safe bug fixes, and leave all
"minor" fixes for 3.x only.

(Possibly we should consider switching on github branch protection
here, blocking direct commits and requiring a minimum of 2 or 3
'acceptable' reviews from core devs on PRs?)

this proposal makes sense to me - do you think it is realistically
feasible with our forces?
All the best.

Agreed with Nyall, commit's should only go into 2.18 if 100% safe and
reviewed by a couple of core devs. If we don't have the forces for it,
we should not port back.

Eg. not being able to add a column to a shapefile (currently in
2.18.21), this is not something you want to have failing in an LTR :-(

I think for an LTR it is better to have 'known' issues, then introduce
unknowns.

Richard Duivenvoorde

I think so. There's enough core developers who are active on a near
daily basis to mean that this should not be a major inconvenience. And
I for one am willing to trade some minor inconvenience for a stabler
LTR.

Dear colleagues,

As you probably know, a week ago we have launched www.geocloud.work which
is an Amazon cloud-based platform for the 3rd party geospatial desktop
software.

Today, we have introduced a new feature on the landing page  - SW
"Features".

As I am personally a not so experienced user of QGIS, I would kindly ask if
somebody from you could specify the main features of QGIS in the attached
file.

The attached file comprises mainly photogrammetric SW features.

Thank you in advance!

Best regards,

Yuri

As a side note, I believe we should try to involve more community members
(I mean users: not developers) in regularly testing development builds
between feature freeze and release.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Error while editing Oracle View without ROWID
Message-ID: <CAA-ca88zCpbGseU+SA0SdPh8VVWNWzhoXdrnOxgpdcLnhaDfEw@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi,
(crossposted from qgis-users, perhaps this is the better place)

i have a problem here with editing an Oracle View:
QGIS 3.2.0-Bonn

The view is defined between a table with geodata and an alphanumeric:

CREATE OR REPLACE FORCE EDITIONABLE VIEW "C ## GIS". "VW_GEO_TEST" ("GID",
"PNAME", "GEOM",
CONSTRAINT "VW_TEST_PK" PRIMARY KEY ("GID") DISABLE) AS
  (select b.gid, a.name pname, a.geom
from GEO_QGIS_TEST a, geo_alpha_test b
where to_char (id) = b.gid);


To edit the view I defined an instead of triggers, for insert:

CREATE OR REPLACE EDITIONABLE TRIGGER "C ## GIS". "IOFT_INSERT_VW_GEO_TEST"
INSTEAD OF INSERT ON VW_GEO_TEST
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
BEGIN
insert into GEO_QGIS_TEST (id, name, geom) values ​​(to_number (: NEW.gid)
,: NEW.pname,: NEW.geom);
insert into geo_alpha_test (gid, at1) values ​​(: NEW.gid,: NEW.pname);
END ioft_insert_vw_all_abs;
/
ALTER TRIGGER "C ## GIS". "IOFT_INSERT_VW_GEO_TEST" ENABLE;


In the view I can easily insert objects via SQL, they appear correctly in
both tables.

If I digitize a new object via QGIS and then save the changes, the data is
also saved in both tables, but then QGIS issues an error message:

==================================
Konnte Änderungen am Layer VW_GEO_TEST nicht festschreiben

Fehler: FEHLER: Ein Objekt nicht hinzugefügt.

Datenanbieterfehler:
      Oracle-Fehler beim Attributhinzufügen: Oracle-Fehler: Konnte
Objektkennung -4 nicht laden
    SQL: ORA-01445: Kann keine ROWID aus einer Join-View ohne Basistabelle
(der View) auswählen oder erfassen
    Konnte Anweisung nicht ausführen
    Fehler: SELECT "GID" FROM "C##GIS"."VW_GEO_TEST" WHERE ROWID=:a

==================================


The error message is somewhat misleading here, the objects were actually
saved in the database, but then QGIS probably tries to read the object
again via a ROWID and fails.
Unfortunately, this view has no ROWID:

> select a.rowid, a. * from VW_GEO_TEST a;
results
ORA-01445: Can not select or capture a ROWID from a join view without a
base table (the view)
01445. 00000 - "can not select ROWID from, or sample, a join view without a
key-preserved table"
* Cause:
* Action:
Error in line: 59 Column: 25

Is this so intentional or a mistake of QGIS? Mistake of me?

Looking at the sourcecode at src/providers/oracle/qgsoracleprovider.cpp it
seems to that this is done intentionally but perhaps changeable.
My poor C++-Skills are not good enough to estimate the effort

I read a similar question on https://gis.stackexchange.com/
questions/188339/edits-in-oracle-spatial-layers but not a solution for me.

Regards
Thomas

I've just enabled this. Let's give it a trial run and see how it works out.

Could release manager(s) be given special powers to circumvent the

Good day all

I share my projects over a local network to multiple computers and 
virtual machines in my working space for using and testing Qgis. Lately 
I have had quite a few errors over SMB shares using the Samba file 
server and clients.

The error messages vary. I forgot what the messages were for shapefiles, 
for geopackage the messages are a bit obscure but it essentially fails 
to commit changes and then undoes all the changes in that layer back to 
where it was before you put it into edit mode. Project files save so it 
doesn't seem likely to be a permissions issue. These issues seem to be 
intermittent rather than being present all of the time.

I am seeing Samba issues with some other stuff so I am starting to think 
Samba has some problems in current releases.

Currently I am testing with NFS to see if it is more reliable, so far it 
looks good.

Not specifically - but you can exclude admins - which is what I've done.

Hi devs,

is there a way to update a widget (e.g. setting a ComboBox as not
enabled) depending on another widget within a Processing script?

Something like:

if val == 'whatever':
  self.processingComboBox.setEnabled(False)


Thanks for all the hints

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Create Grid (Grid.py) Crash and Exception
Message-ID: <1532149704445-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, I'm attempting to report an exception when using the Create Grid tool in
QGIS 3.2.

I hope I am in the right place - the crash report instructed me to report
the incident to OSgeo.org and after getting register, confirmed and
subscribed, this forum looked like the best place to go.

I used the Create Grid tool several times successfully under QGIS Version:
3.0.3-Girona and then, unexpectedly got the Crash Report provided below. I
decided to upgrade to 3.2-Bonn as a way the "fix" it. Now instead of the
crash, I get an (unknown) exception in the Grid.py  processAlgorithm
function at line 161:

        (sink, dest_id) = self.parameterAsSink(parameters, self.OUTPUT,
context,
                                               fields, outputWkb, crs)

I did some typical "exploritory debugging" by commenting a few lines out,
substituting the 3.0.3 Grid.py in the 3.2 directory, etc. but did not have
any blind luck and did not get anywhere.

Is this the right place to report problems of this sort?

I can help with figuring this out if you want me to run some experiments,
send acual values, put in the printf's (I'm a C programmer, so that's what I
call trace output.)

Any help or advice will be appreciated!

Can you share the log contents from the processing algorithm dialog?

Not really - Processing doesn't currently have any support for
dependencies amongst parameters. You could maybe hack around this by
directly accessing widgets, but that wouldn't be version safe and
would be quite fragile.

The "canonical" way to handle this currently is to throw an error when
the algorithm is executed if the combination of parameters does not
make sense.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Wrong Output GetRasterband
Message-ID: <980ddeb7ac6543a89a5ff6bba5d91105@josephinum.at>

Hello!

I want to output the min and max of my layer properties via a python script. If I check it manually they are "Min 0.250754" and "Max 0.726268".
[cid:image001.png at 01D42279.12D3E1D0]

But my output via the python console is something completely different. With the GetMinimum method I receive 0.0837957039475 and with GetMaximum I receive 0.788260400295.

Script:
testlayer = iface.activeLayer()
dataset = gdal.Open(testlayer.source(), gdal.GA_ReadOnly)
band = dataset.GetRasterBand(1)

print "GDAL Min"
print band.GetMinimum()
print "GDAL Max"
print band.GetMaximum()

Output:
GDAL Min
0.0837957039475
GDAL Max
0.788260400295

Yes, Following, and some further information. I've narrowed the problem 
down to using a value for 'OUTPUT', rather than leaving it blank (memory 
/ Create temporary layer). Note the second attempt where OUTPUT is 
'memory:' rather than 'test'. I also noted a ':' appended to 'memory'. 
Hummm. Wonder if 'test' should have a ':' ?
Processing algorithm…

Algorithm 'Create grid' starting…

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Reading OSM data from .osm file
Message-ID: <886ce5e6-f627-988d-090e-640d8e52585d@gmail.com>

Hi all,

downloading an osm file from https://www.openstreetmap.org and loading
it in QGIS results in perfect spatial positions but the attribute data
are read wrong.

Wrong means that there are only 2 columns: "osm_id" with correct numbers
of feature ids and another nameless column that contains all the other
information like: "crossing"=>"traffic_signals","highway"=>"crossing"

Seems that the parser is not working correctly?

To reproduce the problem:

1. https://www.openstreetmap.org
2. Click on Export in the top left corner
3. click on Export in the new tab
4. open the osm file in QGIS

Someone confirms? Should I open a ticket?

Thanks to all

Matteo

Hi Matteo,

I guess you are missing an understanding for OSMs data model. OSM is
very flexible in adding attributes to a feature by adding key/value
pairs. If this is to be represented in a GIS data away (table) you have
to convert the data importing just relevant keys (each becoming a
column), which results in loss of some attributes, or you can use
something like hstore in postgresql [1] meaning you store the set of
key/value pairs (or dictionary in python-terms) in one column. This is
lossless and seems to be what is used here.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GRASS processing modules in QGIS3
Message-ID: <CACJcZHu5CU6vZP6TA9Gk4OnXimBjwezTA6UdOqWxq1zA5o4HPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have observed that some of the GRASS processing modules do not work (they
run, but produce no result or error) in QGIS3. In particular, I am
interested in using v.net.steiner, for which I was advised by Markus
Neteler to open a bug report, which I did here:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19186. However, I don't know if anybody is
taking care of this. I found that  Radek Novotný  is working on improving
the GRASS integration in QGIS3 for a Google Summer of Code:
https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/GSoC/2018/IntegrationInQGIS3

It is unclear to me, if this also aims to make the GRASS processing modules
work in QGIS3. If yes, I would like to know, when the modules are intended
to be usable in QGIS. If no, I would like to know, if there is any other
development in this context currently in progress or planned. Maybe there
is also a better way to solve such questions than scanning through the
mailing list or writing to it?

Thank you in advance,

Sophie

well I think that even if lossless the information are pretty much
useless also.

What I'm saying is that the old OSM core provider of QGIS 2 (download
osm and convert osm to SpatiaLite) and the current QuickOSM plugin (both
QGIS 2 and QGIS 3) stores all the information as well, having maybe a
lot of columns empty, but still usable.

Cheers

Matteo

It's the purpose of the QuickOSM default parser. It will not lose any
key/value, so you will have one column for each keys.

But if you load your file without plugins and not with the OSM core
provider in QGIS 2, I'm surprise that you got the "highway" key on the
"other_tags" field. I suspect you modified your own osmconf.ini.
According to the default file, "highway" must have its own field:
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/gdal/data/osmconf.ini#L48

You can still use the default parser and use the whitelist field in
QuickOSM QGIS 2. It will parse only these OSM keys (separated by a comma).
If you have your own OSM file on your computer, when you open it with
QuickOSM (2 and 3), you can provide your custom OSMConf.ini file which
specify which OSM keys you want to parse.

Hi Etienne,

wait maybe we are confusing providers ;)

QuickOSM parser works great. So far I never had a problem when
downloading data with your plugin.

But if the .osm file is downloaded outside QGIS (e.g. directly on
openstreetmap.com) the parser (GDAL?!) makes columns collapsing.

I attached a screenshot of the only 2 columns I have from the point
layer loaded from the osm file (center of Rome city). So except for
"osm_id" **all** the other tags are concatenated in the nameless second
column.

I really don't know is I'm missing something, but I thought that the
workflow was pretty straightforward.

Thanks!

Matteo

When you have your .osm file on your computer (eg downloaded from outside
QGIS), you can open it with:
* QuickOSM with the default parser, each keys will have their own fields.
* QuickOSM with your custom osmconf.ini file. The attribute table is
defined according to your osmconf file.
* OSM core importer in QGIS 2, not sure about the final attribute table.
* QGIS, loading a normal vector file. The osmconf file on your computer
will be used to define the attribute table.

So it seems you are using the last option, right? So maybe you modified the
default osmconf file?

it seems so. Never touched the osmconf file (almost a fresh Debian Sid
OS). It just seems strange to me that the "default" parser (the last one
of the list) is lossy (meaning that many columns can collapse into a
single not usable one).

Anyway: QuickOSM parser works like a charm ;)

Thanks to all

Hi,

Etienne, where does the osmconf file come from? Is it a default file in
QGIS (v3) installation or something added when installing the QuickOSM
plugin?
I mean should the aforementioned option 4 have returned the data in a
""flat"" shape (a key <-> a field), as does QuickOSM by default?

Thanks,
Harrissou

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Unable to understand the "Default CRS for new
	projects" setting
Message-ID: <CAECJsSp13sONkFbSikEnpdjexPjZqhVB8AdG=FMjK8f2Xa+Vag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
In the Settings --> Options --> CRS menu, user can choose a CRS which is
used as default whenever he opens a new blank project.
Then if he adds a layer:
- if the layer CRS is different from the one I set for the project, the
project CRS is changed and aligned with the first loaded layer CRS;
- if it's a geometryless layer, then the project CRS is set to epsg:4326

Then, my question is what's the interest of setting a default CRS for all
projects, if each time I open a new project it's the first loaded layer
that dictates the rule and applies its CRS?
>From my understanding, the project CRS is the environment in which I'd like
to work and with the auto-OTF, layers I add would be reprojected in that
environment, not the inverse.

Am I missing something or, if it's by design, could someone explain me the
reasons, please? Or are those behaviors bugs I should file?

Thanks,
Harrissou

For me, I have it in /usr/share/gdal/2.2/osmconf.ini
It's by default with gdal. Only a few columns should be created by default:

<https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/gdal/data/osmconf.ini#L48>
http://www.gdal.org/drv_osm.html how to use this file.

thanks for your note and your interest. It is true that this area of
code is currently not actively managed by one of the main developers.
Our best advice is to have a look (modules are rather simple, you'll
find them here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/description
) and try to fix them yourself, or with the help of someone if needed.
Otherwise, a good idea would be to help us raising the relevant
resources to fix these issues.
All the best.

I'd love to, unfortunately I'll not attend FOSS4G2018.
It would be good if the panel would be reachable also remotely.
Thanks Tim - you'll be there?

I could replicate your issue too on QGIS 3.2 Matteo.
Not always, maybe depending on the geometry or how many layer you load at
the same time:
Maybe linked to https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19477 (I got some different
behaviors according to the number of layer loaded) and
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19461

I was looking at the QGIS manual page

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorcreation.html#qgiscreategrid

It says that Create Grid is under Vector -> Analysis Tools. In the main
menu it is really under Vector->Research Tools and under Processing it is
under "Vector creation".

Is it easy to get set up to make changes to the manual if I find errors
like this?

will directly bring you to the concerned page (it will also create the docs

Oh pity :-(

How do you mean by this? If you mean via zoom / Skype etc. I think it unlikely - the panel will be in an auditorium and I think it is going to be hard to manage remote participation too.

> Thanks Tim - you'll be there?

Yes I will be there - I am in the organising team for FOSS4G2018.

Tim

Great thanks Régis. I have added you, Andreas and Marco as panelists for now. I will add Marco Bernasocchi too if he confirms. Any other volunteers feel free to give me your names.

That's not true - the recent grant funding for processing gui also
covers fixes to providers such as this.

I've found the issue here, a fix is incoming.

Message-ID: <CAMtsY+aaoxza_cKZpywdiKJe1x6if8f-SAeeto-m10pkO0pHGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have troubles at using a custom external plugin repository in QGIS 3.
The plugin installed and the plugin on the repo don't match in the plugin
manager. In other words, I cannot upgrade my plugin since it is listed once
in installed and once in not installed.
I wonder if anything changed in QGIS 3 that might have affected this.

There used to be some details listed in the manager in QGIS 2.x that are
not in 3:
installed version: (the local path)
available version: the plugin repo name (either QGIS or custom)

If anyone has a hint :)

Cheers,
Denis

Well, I know that both the 'Installed version' and the 'Available
version' numbers have a tooltip showing the local path and repo

It is a little 'hidden' and Borys promissed to make it more prominent in
the dialog :)

Hmmm I don't remember any change than could cause this. Does the zip file 
basename matches the directory name or do you use any suffixes?

Yes, and it's approaching fast on my TODO queue :)

The zip file has a suffix with the version: pluginname-x.x.x.zip
Could it be the issue?

IIRC, the suffix should be separated by a dot (pluginname.x.x.x.zip). 
Everything before the first dot must match the directory name. But it wouldn't 
work in QGIS 2 too...

Hi devs,

 

I need to get the current version (in metadata.txt) of my plugin from python. I saw that there is a Class <https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/gui/other/QgsPluginManagerInterface.html> to access Metadata, but I did not found any example how to use it.

I tried with the code below without success. Does anyone can help me?

 

from qgis.gui import QgsPluginManagerInterface

meta = QgsPluginManagerInterface.pluginMetadata('myPluginName')

print(meta)

 

Thanks is advance!

Hi,

QgsPluginManagerInterface is quite limited. Try this instead:

from qgis.utils import pluginMetadata
pluginMetadata('myPluginName', 'version')

For more info see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/utils.py#L290

In particular, I am interested in using v.net.steiner, for which I was advised by Markus Neteler to open a bug report, which I did here: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19186.

This is now fixed in master and backported to 3.2, so will be fixed in
the 3.2.2 release. You can grab a "nightly" release if you need the
fix urgently.

Very much so! Just keep filing bug reports like you've done, and
they'll eventually get fixed.

This one is definitely a bug!

> Then, my question is what's the interest of setting a default CRS for all projects, if each time I open a new project it's the first loaded layer that dictates the rule and applies its CRS?

I'm not sure :) It does have some impact, e.g. because creating a new
layer will use this crs (if it's done before any other layers are
added). I suspect this is one of those settings which has been around
for so long that it just no longer has any real meaning. Maybe it's a
relic from before OTF was introduced?

The options I can see are:

1. Remove the setting, always start new projects in EPSG:4326, and
then switch to match the crs of the first loaded layer
2. Remove the "set project crs to match first loaded layer crs"
feature, and always start new projects in the crs defined by that
setting. Loading layers doesn't change the crs.

We need to proceed with caution here. For reference, I'd be a hesitant
+1 to option 2.

Looking at this, the value for output is a bit odd: 'test'.  This
should usually be a full path, e.g. "c:\users\nd\Desktop\all my
important stuff which i need\grid_final_rev2_revised.shp". I suspect
this is where the issue comes from, it's trying to create a file named
"test" in an unspecified directory which is likely somewhere you don't
have permission to write to.

Was this done through the processing toolbox? How did you obtain the
"test" value here?

Which QGIS version? Check under the "load min/max values" group box to
double check that you're using "min/max", and not "standard deviation"
or some other method.

This is GDAL api, not QGIS. If you want to try the QGIS way you should use:

testlayer=iface.activeLayer()
stats = testlayer.dataProvider().bandStatistics(1)
print(stats.minimumValue)
print(stats.maximumValue)

Just to expand on that - if you use pure PyQGIS API instead of mixing
in the gdal API here, then your code will work correctly regardless of
the layer source (e.g. it will work for wms/mapserver/etc, not just
gdal file based layers)

Thanks! That worked!

I put in a fully qualified file name in the "Grid" dialog box and it 
worked - I left the "Open output file after running algorithm" checked 
and it adds the vector layer to my project. It uses a default layer name 
of "Grid" rather than my file name, but I can rename it.

Exploring a bit, I opened the [...] button for the input field and 
selected File. I got the standard Save file dialog defaulted to 
C:\Users\me\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\processing\outputs. 
My bet is that this directory requires special permission to write to, 
and I would not want to put my files there anyway.

RE: Was this done through the processing toolbox? How did you obtain the
"test" value here?

Yes, I used the processing toolbox: Processing->Toolbox->Vector 
creation->Create grid. The dialog that opens has a "Grid" section at the 
bottom with an input field. By default it contains the advisory [Create 
temporary layer]. I used this the first time I tried Create Grid, and it 
worked. I then renamed the layer in the layer panel and saved it. Given 
my experience, I assumed that I could type in the name of a layer here 
and it would put the layer in the layer panel, from which I could save 
it. I now understand how it works. Thanks!

For reference, I have attached a screen shot of the dialog box - hope it 
makes it through the list server!


Since this is a developer list, I have two suggestions - First update 
the Create Grid documentation, second, create an "invalid file name" 
trace in the log or some such message so the cause of the problem would 
be better understood by those who might run into it.

I'm sure I can update the documentation, and I might be able to update 
the code also. What should I do to get involved with helping out?

Hi,

seems QGIS does not recognize relative paths for the GeoPackage and
Rasterlite raster layers, e.g. GPKG:./some/path/file.gpkg:layer. But
same path works fine from the command line with gdal utilities like
gdalinfo

Anyone confirms?

Looks like this is a regression. In older versions you can type just
filename and
Processing will create output file in the default output directory.
Location of this
directory is configured in the Processing settings.

Hi All

Just another request: If you are coming to the hackfest in Zanzibar, please add your details to the wiki page including your arrival and departure dates. If you are not listed on that page you may not be given food!

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/DeveloperMeetingZanzibar2018

From the wiki page it seems most will only actively participate from the 23rd. Unless there is a massive increase in the number of attendees, we plan to organise the logistics as follows:

22nd - those that are already in Zanzibar we will hang out in the lounge at Beyt-al-salaam hotel
23rd, 24th - we will meet in the conference room at Maru Maru hotel
25th - we will meet at the university campus - and the day will include a talk open to students about the QGIS project.
26th - we will meet again at the Maru Maru hotel. Those taking the ferry to Dar will need to be at the ferry station by max 2.30pm (a bit earlier is advised). Make sure you are already checked out of your hotel in the morning.

If you need need any help while you are in Zanzibar , please contact Yves Barthelemy  (cell no +255 778 364437 or yvesbarthelemy at gmail.com). Yves will be on site from 21st August.

Whether or not you are attending the event, we are looking for sponsors for the event to cover meals etc. If you are able to sponsor it please contact Lene Fischer at lfi at ign.ku.dk.

Looking forward to seeing you in Zanzibar!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS builds
Message-ID: <CAOJAE5pKki7a=e4OJ556ZrreaeVDE2S=rFRaLxhtDhd7a5tbfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to build qgis from source, but I'm getting a linking error in
`mdalprovider`:

C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\hdf5.dll : fatal error LNK1107: invalid or corrupt file:
cannot read at 0x2F0


I have successfully built qgis before, so any idea why this would be
causing a problem now?

As background, I'm trying to build a particular pull request to help with
testing. The steps I took were:

1. git fetch origin pull/7396/head:rastercalc
2. git checkout rastercalc
3. delete directory build-qgis-test-x86_64 (in QGIS/ms-windows/osgeo4w)
4. run configonly.bat
5. run OSGeo4W-dev.bat (which executes `call
C:\Users\rudi_000\Source\Repos\QGIS\ms-windows\osgeo4w\msvc-env.bat x86_64`)
6. run devenv from command prompt
7. open qgis.sln
8. build

I have tried cleaning and rebuilding mdalprovider, but get the same result.
It could be that just repeating the process described above would resolve
the issue (from point 3.), but since it takes several hours to build (I'm
building on a pretty old laptop) I thought I'd ask in case I'm doing
something wrong in the process.

Thanks,
Rudi

Hi Alex,

I realized a couple of weeks ago that when the file is added with the
add layer dialog paths are non-relative, while it works fine using drag
and drop from the system's file explorer. At least on the Windows
systems we had in a course there.

Hi Matthias,

I tried to edit layer source in the project file and layers with
relative paths became "missed" when loading
project. I'm testing on Linux, will try on Windows too.

Hi,

resource files (resources_rc.py) will need to be regenerated using
pyrcc5, see here http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/resources.html.

Best regards

Hi devs,
For do the plugin translations I use
1) Linguist from QT52) The command line: 
    Pylupdate4 -noobsolete PluginName.pro (Is there a new version 5??)
3) and the classical code:
        # initialize locale
        locale = QSettings().value('locale/userLocale')[0:2]
        locale_path = os.path.join(
            self.plugin_dir,
            'i18n',
            'PluginName_{}.qm'.format(locale))

        if os.path.exists(locale_path):
            self.translator = QTranslator()
            self.translator.load(locale_path)

            if qVersion() > '4.3.3':
                QCoreApplication.installTranslator(self.translator)
        def tr(self, message):
            return QCoreApplication.translate(QWaterPlugin.SETTINGS, message)

The problem is that the option to use self.tr('message string') is not working. It only works when I use QCoreApplication.translate('Escope', 'message string') even if a tr function defined.

It used to work if linguist from QT4.

What  Am I doing wrong? BTW Is there a new better way to translate plugins?
Thanks,
Jorge Almerio

Message-ID: <CAB28Asj81U37qxYcfetyFVB34AdgkSTw44t6kg+c_uRPK7Cm-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all (especially Martin),

I was chatting with Mathieu trying to work out if there was a bug in
3d map views, but it turns out that it was just a misunderstanding on
my part. I thought that if I had e.g. a pointz dataset (with z value
set to dem spot height) and a dem, the points should always be placed
exactly on the dem when altitude clamping = absolute.

It turns out that this is only the case if the dem vertical scale is
set to 1.0. If I increase the scale, then the point z values aren't
scaled to match and end up sitting below the dem.

To me this is a bug, because vertical scale is a view dependent "data
visualisation" setting only, and shouldn't require modification of the
original data itself (i.e. manually scaling the point z values to
match the vertical scale*).

Is this intended behavior? (and if so, can it be rethought?)

Nyall



* this is non-trivial - there's NO easy way in qgis to scale z values
(you'd need custom python code to do this)

It is possible that there are some inconsistencies with the vertical
scale terrain and how it applies (or does not apply to other
entities). One thing that comes up every now and then is whether all
vertical distance values should be affected by the vertical scale - or
just some - or maybe to have that configurable. For example, as you
say, for PointZ data, it probably makes more sense to apply vertical
scale to Z coordinates. How about other properties like polygon
elevation or extrusion - should those be affected as well? Any
thoughts on how this should work are welcome :-)

Cheers
Martin

I'd say vertical scale should be universal and apply to all z coordinates.

To me the scale is a viewport dependent setting, which is highly
dependent on the map extent and angle to get a "good" scale. So I
think it should be that tweaking just that single setting should
universally change the vertical exaggeration, with no extra data work
required.

Yeah that would be the simple solution, at the same time, if someone
chooses 2x vertical terrain scale, this would also mean that:
- 3D buildings appear with double height, looking unnatural
- points rendered as spheres (or other models) would get weird shape
- lines rendered as 3D pipes (not supported currently) would get
ellipsoidal if they are not vertical

My initial thoughts were that the vertical scale is merely a feature
to exaggerate terrain features if the terrain is relatively flat,
keeping other data in the scale intact...

Hi all,

I think the problem described in these tickets can be more serious than
just a visualization question:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/11974
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/14853

Please try the following workflow.

1) Download this sample raster:

    STATISTICS_MINIMUM=2
    STATISTICS_STDDEV=71.52569727799


4) gdalinfo creates a XML file with statistics info in the file folder:

<PAMDataset>
  <PAMRasterBand band="1">
    <Metadata>
      <MDI key="STATISTICS_MAXIMUM">835</MDI>
      <MDI key="STATISTICS_MEAN">37.024768992184</MDI>
      <MDI key="STATISTICS_MINIMUM">2</MDI>
      <MDI key="STATISTICS_STDDEV">71.52569727799</MDI>
    </Metadata>
  </PAMRasterBand>
</PAMDataset>


5) Then, delete that XML file.

6) Load the perigosidade_int.tif file in QGIS.

7) Don't do anything, just remove the raster from QGIS TOC.

8) If you go to the folder where the raster is stored, QGIS created a new
XML file with:

<PAMDataset>
  <PAMRasterBand band="1">
    <Histograms>
      <HistItem>
        <HistMin>1.500685871056241</HistMin>
        <HistMax>730.4993141289438</HistMax>
        <BucketCount>729</BucketCount>
        <IncludeOutOfRange>0</IncludeOutOfRange>
        <Approximate>1</Approximate>
        <HistCounts>(...)</HistCounts>
      </HistItem>
    </Histograms>
    <Metadata>
      <MDI key="STATISTICS_MAXIMUM">730</MDI>
      <MDI key="STATISTICS_MEAN">34.375557670573</MDI>
      <MDI key="STATISTICS_MINIMUM">2</MDI>
      <MDI key="STATISTICS_STDDEV">67.853826109685</MDI>
    </Metadata>
  </PAMRasterBand>
</PAMDataset>


9) So, QGIS marks the STATISTICS_MAXIMUM as 730.

10) Even defining in Settings -> Options -> Rendering -> Rasters -> Limits
(minimum/maximum): Minimum/Maximum

QGIS always uses 730, because the Accuracy is, by default, "Estimate
(faster)", and this option is not configurable at Options, as said in these
tickets.


But what is really serious here, is that as soon as the XML file is
created, Processing tools uses these statistics for the calculations.

11) For instance, if run r.quantile with "generate recode rules" flag, the
output is:

2.000000:6.000000:1
6.000000:8.000000:2
8.000000:12.000000:3
12.000000:20.000000:4
20.000000:730.000000:5

12) Classifying the raster based on these rules with r.recode leaves pixels
with value 835 as NULL.

And every subsequent process gives errors.


The question is.. how I never had realized this problem? The fact is that
QGIS only generates the XML file when the raster layer is removed from QGIS
project. And so, if Processing modules are run using the layers loaded in
TOC, there are no problems.

If these modules are runned from the python console (processing.runalg) or
using raster layers that are not loaded in QGIS, the problem show up.

I'm with QGIS 2.18.22 (OSGeo4W64 bits).

Thank you very much!

Pedro Venâncio

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Question on FGDB support for "Save As" / "Export"
Message-ID: <32ecab2a5134210d11f0137dc9326831@carto.net>

Hi, 

A Swiss QGIS user asked me if/how FGDB for export/Save as can be
supported in QGIS - question specifically about the Windows distribution
of QGIS 3.x. Sometimes, QGIS users have to deliver results in fgdb
format, because their clients require it. 

A quick e-mail exchange with Even Roualt revealed the following: 

1. it is already supported if the proper "gdal-filegdb" packages are
installed. 

2. Currently, it can only be enabled in the OSGeo4W version by selecting
the "gdal-filegdb" package. The standalone installer does not include
this package. 

3. There are issues when wanting to "Save As" an additional layer into
an already existing FGDB. The problem is that fgdb files are actually
directories. And the current "Save As" dialog does not support selecting
"directories" to save into, only files. As a workaround, it works if one
copy/pastes the full path from the Windows file explorer into the "Save
As" dialog, but not when selecting a directory interactively. 

Here is some info on the third issue from Even: 

"I don't have the solution on top of my mind. According to
http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfiledialog.html#FileMode-enum it seems that you
can
setup the selector to select file or directories, but not both.
We actually use the QFileDialog::getSaveFileName() API that probably
internally resolves to QFileDialog::AnyFile
Perhaps a more experience QT dev than me would have an idea.
Or an hack (but not sure we can really do better) would be to allow the
user
to select any file in the .gdb directory, and then automatically strips
out
the filename to just keep the directory name when we see this a file in
in a
.gdb directory" 

--------------- 

So here are my two questions: 

About issue 2: 

@Jürgen: can you include the necessary gdal-filegdb package also in the
standalone installer - or are there license problems? 

About issue 3: 

Does some dev have an idea or solution on how to more easily select a
folder instead of a file, for the case of writing an additional layer
into an already existing .fgdb folder? 

Thank you all for your ideas and the discussion, 

Andreas

Hi,

Just a quick question about the file vs. directory problem. Do we need
to be able to select an existing directory or a new one?
If it's the latter (new .gdb-folder), we can just use the existing file
dialog, which will return a path to a file name (but not yet create a
new file) and we can then have the fgdb driver create a new folder
instead of a file at this position.
I might be missing something though.

Hi Matthias, 

We need to be able to select an existing fgdb-folder (as seen by the OS
it is just a regular folder). 

Currently, QGIS just opens the folder and then expects the user to pick
a file, but currently we can't select a folder without traversing deeper
into it.

-1 to packaging the gdal-filegdb package by default. My rationale:

- I've experienced lots of issues with this driver. For one, it's much
slower to open gdbs, especially over networks. I've also hit bugs in
the past where the driver doesn't handle certain subset queries in the
same way as other ogr drivers (I can't recall the exact details, but I
think the particular issue I hit was fixed.)

- The driver has known issues. From
https://www.gdal.org/drv_filegdb.html, there's e.g. this important
one: "The SDK is known to be unable to open layers with particular
spatial reference systems.". And then on
https://www.gdal.org/drv_openfilegdb.html there's a list of features
that we'd lose by changing to the filegdb driver:

"Advantages of the OpenFileGDB driver:

Can read ArcGIS 9.X Geodatabases, and not only 10 or above.
Can open layers with any spatial reference system.
Thread-safe (i.e. datasources can be processed in parallel).
Uses the VSI Virtual File API, enabling the user to read a Geodatabase
in a ZIP file or stored on a HTTP server.
Faster on databases with a big number of fields.
Does not depend on a third-party library.
Robust against corrupted Geodatabase files.

Drawbacks of the OpenFileGDB driver:

Read-only.
Cannot use spatial indexes.
Cannot read data from compressed data in CDF format (Compressed Data Format)."

That's a pretty significant loss in my opinion - especially the point
about the closed source driver being non thread-safe.

- The OpenFileGDB driver is very heavily tested for robustness and
security issues with the ongoing fuzz testing of GDAL drivers.

- Last, but not least, we'd lose the ability to actually fix issues.
We'd be dependent on bug fixes in the ESRI SDK, and be powerless to
get fixes we need implemented.


These are all significant issues, and the moment we make the switch to
the closed source driver and give users write support, there's no way
we can revert this decision and remove the ability to edit GDB files.
It's not a decision we can make lightly.

I'd rather leave this decision up to individual users (and those who
make in-house software packages for deployment in their organisation)
to make. I.e. leave it as is, where it's effectively an "opt-in"
change. And push people to helping make the open driver better, as
it's a more sustainable solution in the long term.

(Lastly, a rant: I hate file geodatabases. They are the WORST format
for spatial data that I've seen. It's like ESRI took everything which
people disliked about shapefiles and magnified those. Instead of a
handful of files, we get hundreds. Instead of minor user confusion
about how they need to package all the dependent files, we get this
super-confusing folder/file mix, which causes all sorts of issues for
non-ArcGIS software because it just breaks fundamental file management
assumptions. And they are SLOW. So SLOOOOOOW. Even in ArcGIS they are
slow to open and manage. GIve me shapefiles over this monstrosity any
day.)
