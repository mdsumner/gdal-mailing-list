Hi,

I got back yesterday from my only week of vacation of this year, I have 
no problem with people contributing directly to this while I'm not here 
but it seems that a few hundred translations I did in my previous commit 
(http://goo.gl/VsCYhL, all the processing/sextante were done) are now 
empty. The count was 8978 done, it is now 8717.

Is there a way to solve this without redoing them one by one ? Which 
given the time before release and my availability will not be possible.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] About a 'directed' LINESTRING (e.g. for oneway
	streets)?
Message-ID: <CAFcOn29yOkdhRGH--xUW_2KKT1y29g0TxScu8F46m6seviN-Qw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm designing a spatial database and like to introduce a LINESTRING where
the direction is important, e.g. to describe a oneway street or a water
pipe. I indicate this by another attribute, e.g. "direction: BOOLEAN", or
"direction: ENUM(both, as_is, reverse)

A "directed line" means that the order of the coordinates of a linestring
value is important - like in a directed graph - and needs to remain the
same whatever happens to it e.g. when importing, storing, retrieving,
analysing or rendering...

Does anybody have had any issues to manage "directed lines" in QGIS (OGR,
extensions, etc.)?

Yours, Stefan

Hi,

This has now been committed [0], but now uses a more flexible workflow (API
unchanged):

* Remove deprecated labeling properties tab for new projects or older ones
that don't use them

* Deprecated tab remains active for older projects, if any layer uses them

* Deprecated tab can be disabled/enabled via console commands for project
entry, e.g.:
  QgsProject.instance().writeEntry('DeprecatedLabels', '/Enabled', bool)
  or
  QgsProject.instance().removeEntry('DeprecatedLabels', '/')

Larry

Here are 14 font families I found on Google fonts that may work [0]. I
think almost all fonts there are under the SIL Open Font License. Some are
similar to the font already used (Ubuntu?), but have a stronger Q.

I set the preview text to QGIS and the Show popup to Header. I'm partial to
Rambla, Source Sans Pro, and Merriweather Sans

Btw, I've done quite a bit of testing with the Source Sans Pro (open) font
from Adobe. It works very well for the base GUI font in the app and PyQGIS
console (Source Code Pro), even across platforms. It has similar
characteristics to Ubuntu Mono. I know some people might not like the fonts
strictly on the grounds that they come from Adobe, but both the Source Sans
and Code Pro are very well crafted, and free and open-licensed.

That's great that you like Source Sans Pro, because it's the font I used
in all designs.

Best wishes,

Touch?!  I see that now. :^)

I really like it for interfaces, but in that layout its Q does look a
little weak, so maybe one of the other fonts with a wider Q would look
nicer.

Hi,

It probably seems strange to me (and Marco), as this is my everyday map 
and I have a totally different association than QGIS to this.
But as there is not much response to this, I guess there are not many 
concerns around.

As a reminder concerning the swisstopo map, we are also not allowed to 
use this at a resolution exceeding 500'000 pixels.
The picture with the Hotel Schwarzsee which Marco cited is also 
available at a higher resolution (to some extent at the expense of some 
blurryness) [1]

Regards,
Matthias

Maybe stay with Source Sans Pro. It's very professional-looking. I think it
might be just fine if the Q is slightly wider, say at 110%.

Based on the feedback on flickr and here, I went with the version which  
does not include the logo (so there are no conflicting Qs) and cleaned it  
up to avoid any overlapping texts. I'm very happy with the results:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42637169/qgis20_draft7.png

If there are no major objections, I'll move on to the website redesign  
now. Thanks everyone for your feedback!

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi All

After chatting to Larry Shaffer I have postponed the date for creating the
release branch to Tuesday evening in order to let him make some final
improvements to labelling consistency on QGIS Server.

So consider master still open for bug fixes that you wish to see in QGIS
2.0 until that date.

Best regards

Tim

+1 from me. I think the map looks fine, though I don't have an opinion on
the map's origin, etc.

Btw, I think the background map could be produced with QGIS (unless, the
comment I read somewhere about that is referring to the panoramic view).

Hi,

While updating the Mac icons I needed to update the one for QGIS Browser as
well. So, I put one together [0][1].

Please let me know if this can be used for 2.0 release. If so, I'll commit
it.

Hi

Jean Roc is that not maybe a side effect of the Sextante -> Processing
rename?

Thank you very much - Larry!

I have a QGIS course on Thursday (with QGIS master) and now new QGIS
users won't be bothered with the deprecated stuff anymore.

Hi,

Anita - thank you for working on the splash-screen.

@Matthias and @Marco: you can blame me for suggesting the "modern"
Swisstopo map rather than the Dufour or Siegfriedmap. I personally think
we can be proud of the current Swisstopo map - and as Larry said -
besides the cliff drawing I believe it can be made in QGIS.

I believe the modern map looks better than the original Dufour map - or
would you prefer to use theses older map designs when you go
mountaineering? This is not about belittling the work of Dufour - he was
great at his time and laid the foundation of todays modern Swisstopo
maps. Another advantage of using the modern map is that the map actually
shows the name "Dufourspitze", while the old Dufour map does not (he
couldn't name the highest point of Switzerland after himself) - others
did that for him later when he got famous.

For some background on the modern map: the shaded relief was made
manually with an airbrush and the cliff drawing was made manually years
ago by scribing on coated glass. Both the shaded reliefs and the cliff
drawing were scanned and are now updated in Photoshop whenever there are
updates (e.g. at retreating glaciers or when rockfalls happen).

All the other layers are made with GIS. It happens to be ESRI these days
but it could be QGIS in coming years, esp. if we continue to improve our
cartographic rules and toolboxes at the same rate we do today.

Anyway - I asked for permission and as long as we give credits in the
QGIS about screen (not on the splash screen) and do not surpass the size
of 500'000 pixels we are good to go. BTW: even with the older maps we
would have to cite the data source.

If people still prefer the older maps, please make a variation of
Anita's design by using the Dufour map - see
http://map.geo.admin.ch/?selectedNode=LT1_1&Y=633234&X=87325.5&zoom=6&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&layers=ch.swisstopo.hiks-dufour&layers_opacity=1&layers_visibility=true&time_current=latest&lang=de

We could than vote which map should be used as a background.

I am quite happy with using the map we have.  In the past we have used an

IMO we should stick to the design that Anita has done up as it looks really
modern and will good for the product.

I was trying to run the tests but am missing the test-projects - where
can I get them or where are they located?

I changes $HOME/.qgis2/qgis_local_server.cfg but don't know where I
should point the "projdir" variable to.

Thanks,

Second trouble, the url shows a error message, and it seems the right url

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Infrastructure for plugin settings
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zpC-j6Etm54bqKcawAkntxBnS7R4ks8QfqoT=AG2iQ5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am thinking about changing the Processing config dialog a bit (not
now, it will be after 2.0 is released) and making it a bit more
generic, and I think that it would be good to have a unified platform
for settings/options that can be used by all plugins. I believe this
has been mentioned sometimes, but AFAIK there is nothing ready and no
work has been done on this.

My idea is to have some core functionality that plugins can use to
register their config parameters, so plugin developers do not have to
worry about creating a UI for that, but just read the parameter values
when needed. All settings for all available plugins would be handled
from a single dialog, similar to the "options" one that is used for
core QGIS settings.

Any thoughts on this? Does something like this exists, or do you think
it is a good idea to work on it?

thanks in advance

Victor

Hi all.
Am I wrong, or several Processing (AKA Sextante) strings are untranslatable?
I think we have completed the Italian translation of that section, but we still have

R?gis,

you are right, this has been already for some time. It is a little 
hickup in the javascript do termine the language in the page, to be able 
to switch.

I can try to fix in the docs (which I should), it, but using [1] is also 
a fix, so maybe devs can use that url

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard, 
yes, there is a bit of javascript needed to autodetect client language, for
all people coming from internet. 
For those coming from QGIS help menu, maybe we could use qgis langage to set
langage url, without having to let web client try to do the laguage
detection?
Anyway, this is not a big issue, but you've all been doing so much
documentation work, that it would be very nice to have it well advertised.
R?gis

I added a feature request on the new website issue list [1], which by 
the way is heavily in flux at the moment, so please wait for a more 
stable version before really starting to issue bugs...

Please just don't force people to the documentation version of their  
operating system language settings. I hate it if I have to jump through  
loops to get to English material just because my OS is in German.

No, it was just a wrong commit. The situation is solved but it shows 
that a transifex option would be a good addition.

Thank you for trying to setup the labeling server test.

When the tests for the server are run, the projects are generated
on-the-fly and written to somewhere the server can read (see below). Also
copied into that directory are the layer source data (small spatialite db)
and predefined styles [0].

Right now it is a bit cumbersome because it relies upon configuring access
to an existing, compatible QGIS Server setup.

This is from the error message for an unconfigured setup [1]:
  projdir = path WRITEABLE by this user and READABLE by www server

Once that's set up, you can test compatibility by manually populating the
projdir with contents of [0] and editing under __main__ and running the
following script directly (see recent commit [2]):
  python qgis_local_server.py

A successful test of connection to configured test server should produce
the following PNG [3]. This particular manual connection test is not (will
not be) part of the QGIS ctest suite.

With this setup, you should ideally be testing against the
qgis_mapserv.fcgi binary produced as part of building the desktop, though
you can of course test against any existing fcgi process over a bound
TCP/IP address. While there are good reasons to test against a production
server, there are reasons definitely not to:

* Recent changes to the qgis_mapserv.fgi code will not be reflected.

* The test suite may move to spawning/restarting the fcgi binary often (to
keep server's cache from affecting test output).

* Some settings (labeling engine debug settings, e.g. candidate rectangles)
may persist on a long running fcgi process. Since restarting many servers
involves root access and affects up-time, such automated tests should be
relegated to a sandboxed, configured test server setup.

So, you can probably see why an automated, embedded and isolated spawn-fcgi
utility, running under the user id of the test runner, greatly facilitates
automated tests. (Should be committed in coming weeks.) I'll also look at
posting my successful configurations for setting up QGIS Server under
Nginx, which makes a nice sandbox setup (even alongside Apache), for
testing qgisweb-client and wsgi as well.

Lastly, your server tests against the control images I made on my Mac will
no doubt fail. Currently, multi-platform control images, to account for
font handing differences, are not supported. You will probably want to set
the env var PAL_CONTROL_IMAGE=1 and run:
  ctest -R PyQgsPalLabelingCanvas -V && unset PAL_CONTROL_IMAGE

This will overwrite the canvas test output control images, so that you have
a realistic comparison against the TestServerVsCanvas* classes' output,
similar to loading your test server as a WMS layer in the desktop app. Just
please do not commit your control images yet (unless as anomalies).

Alternatively, you can set the env var PAL_REPORT=1 and run `ctest -R
PyQgsPalLabelingCanvas -V`. This should open any failed tests in your
browser where you can choose to save your rendered images to the
appropriate canvas control images directories, naming them as anomalies.

If you have even read this far  :^)  and are going through this setup,
thank you very much. While it will be good to use an automated spawn-fcgi
setup, there are definite benefits for testing against real-world web
server setups, especially those managed by experienced users.


IMHO, until a test framework and a suite of many tests are finished,
complex changes to labeling code should be ill-advised, and probably be
postponed.

While it would be good to get funding from the community to complete this
type of work, I understand how unglamorous this is compared with new
features.

Larry,

+1 for working out some visual distinction between QGIS and QGIS Browser.
That said, the proposed canvas-below-icon might be confusing. If I was a
first time user, I'd bet on the canvas icon being the main application to
make maps, versus it being a browser-only supporting application.

What about having a couple of canvases below the QGIS icon instead of one
to suggest browsing through many items?

Anita,

Nice, very nice.

Only one suggestion: I'd synchronize the yellow of "Dufour" to be the same
as the primary yellow used in the QGIS logo.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] No fix for 2.0 for #8068,
	wrong font display in qgis server
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR9BZ2KFKXM14X-Jth4d61K3qp-3DAyNTAvjo5Xio5jVRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

After many hours of visual testing, monkeying with the code and generally
banging my head against a wall, I've come to the conclusion I can not
commit the partial fix I have for this issue [0] without possibly causing
issues in other types of output: canvas, composer, PDF, etc. Part of this
is due to the way I coded the new label components and now it looks like
there is definitely something screwy with the way server handles fonts.
There are too many variables and no really useful unit test suite yet.

I suggest the following course of action:

1) Release the desktop version with this as a known blocker, albeit mostly
related to server output.

2) Have an experienced dev review the label painting code who is familiar
with both labeling and server, e.g. Marco H., etc.

3) While the code is being reviewed, I can work towards finishing the
initial unit test suite for labeling (with crosschecks between canvas and
composer, server outputs). Absolutely no labeling features are added or bug
fixes committed until there is a functioning test suite for the most common
labeling uses and outputs.

4) When this issue is appropriately fixed and tested, look at possibly
releasing an updated server component/pkg, if needed.

So to be clear:

Coming from QGIS you want to go the the language QGIS is used at that 
moment:

http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/html/{LANGUAGE}/docs/user_manual/

while for the browser we can hopefully in the future just detect and 
remember the current locale (and be remembered via the browser).

Has anything changed on C++ plugin installs in the 1.9 dev version?
? 

In the past I copied the plugin into the appropriate (plugins) directory to install it on the OSGeo versions. 

What should I do? I am using MSVC on windows XP .

Thank you,

Hi Anita,
I think the opposite problem is even worse: do not force people from non-English
speaking countries to jump to EN man, and find their way to other languages.
For newbies this may be difficult or confusing, and many will get the impression that
the man is in EN only.
All the best.

why not just using user-agent and apache rewrite?
something like:

    RewriteEngine on

    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-Language} ^it [NC]
    RewriteRule ^/$ https://www2.faunalia.eu/it/ [L,R=301]

Exactly. I think that makes most sense because application and manual
will fit together nicely.

I'm interested looking into the labeling painting code. However it will 
probably not happen before the hackfest.

Sounds interesting, but I'm not sure if this applicable for all plugins.
I agree that some settings, that changed infrequently, can be edited from
single dialog. But many settings edited often, especially  ones that affects
output, so hiding them in another dialog than plugin itself is not good and
user-friendly. For example, plugin has settings called "Tolerance", if we put
it under another dialog, user should open this dialog and change setting each
time when different tolerance needed. But when this setting available directly
from plugin it is much easier to change it, compare result and find correct
tolerance value. Same with many other settings.

Hi,

  Following up on this, I have created a new issue 
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8567 and added a patch to the issue tracker 
to correct the problem. I have tested it locally and It gives the 
expected result.  The fix is trivial. if someone has time and commit 
rights, It would be nice to get it fixed.

Thanks

regards,

Y. Assefa

Unfortunately anything past the cut off date is going to have to stay in a
'known issues' list to be addressed in the next release.

I have postponed the branching of the release yet another day for  Nathan
and Salvatore to fix another last minute crash they found on IRC so if
anyone has the ability to resolve these over the course of tomorrow, now is
your chance!

Is there anything else that changed between 1.7 and 1.9 on installing C++ plugins?


In the past, I used to be able to copy the dll to the plugins folder and then it does install on its own. What should I do? I am using MSVC on windows XP .

Thank you,

Maaza

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Python] loadNamedStyle
Message-ID: <52272EDC.4060003@jena.de>

Hi,

I am fiddling around with saving layer styles to the database 
(PostgreSQL) in QGIS 1.9.
I succeeded in saving styles for a layer and applying them. The default 
style is applied if I load the layer via Python, too.
My aim is to save several styles for one layer, load the layer via 
Python and apply a certain one of the saved styles to it.

I do not know,
- how to use layer.listStylesInDatabase() as it returns only the amount 
of styles available for layer but neither their ids nor their names or 
description,
- how to use layer.loadNamedStyle() with a style from the database, 
especially how to specify theUri (name or id of the style do not work as 
theUri)

any help or working examples highly appreciated

Bernhard

The qgis user folder has the name changed from qgis to qgis 2.

Are you copying to what folder?

Hi,

Is anyone working on including Anita's splash-screen?

Also, we need to mention in the QGIS about screen that the map extent in
the splash-screen is from Swisstopo - something like:

Map background in Splashscreen: ? Swisstopo 2013

Would there be any way to mention in the about screen from which date
the github checkin is that the compiled version is based on? I know
there is this very cryptic code from Github (like 7120b1c) - but this
provides no idea on what day this version was checked into the repository.

sorry for sending the message too early.

I have installed python-qscintilla2 and qgis loads without error.

It seems to me it would be better to detect for Qsci ?

cheers
Etienne

I tried to implement this some time ago, and have code that works fine under
Linux. But unfortunately seems it doesn't work under Windows.

Hi,

if I'm not wrong, QScintilla is required dependency when
QGIS compiled with Python support. So from my point
of view it is ok that core plugins use it.

I created another version of the image with the swisstopo reference
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42637169/qgis20_draft7_withCredits.png

I think Tim will include the splash into the final branch.

Best wishes,

Hi Anita, the reference there is really not nice. the rest of the design 
is super, but I really dont like that. also, all the startup messages 
appear there.

IIRC, Andi got prtmission to just include the copyright in the about box.

so for me -1 for this and +1 for the one you made without the reference.

thanks a lot

I know that it will probably not change anything anymore ..
But I still think we should either use a map produced with QGIS or an old map ..

For me using a "foreign" map feels bad ..

just my 2c

 Anita, guys, you misunderstood me.

 This should go into the QGIS?about screen - not in the splash screen 
 itself.

I see. So we just put the swisstopo credits text in about but not the
splash image with text. Get it.

The splash which is shown on startup is without credits of course.

Hi All

Tonight we have branched QGIS 2.0 and so master is open for general
commits, feature requests etc again. As incoming release manager Juergen
Fischer will give further announcements relating to freeze etc activities
on master, while as outgoing release manager I will focus only on 2.0
branch for now.

Please note that this is not a call for packaging yet - I have not yet
tagged the release as there are a few housekeeping additions that need to
be made (updated changelog and SWISSTOPO credits in about box etc.)

I expect to do the actual tagging of the release later in this week at
which point we will issue a call for packaging.

Just to emphasise, the release-2_0 is:

* not yet ready to have packages pushed into official repos
* ready for packagers to update their scripts / packaging rules etc if they
live in the release tree
* is frozen except for approved commits - any commits going into the
release should please go via Juergen or myself
* not ready for general announcements, publicity etc. - give us a chance to
get the publicity materials together before you do this.

Thanks

I've recently spent a good amount of time trying to implement a similar

I'd love to see something like this!

Sorry only now I could check the link to use on the metadata example.

I'm not being able to do it. For the Ren?-Luc examples from bretagne I'm
being able to get the data it self (it's password protected)

For INSPIRE data, I'm not being able to get the metadata link.

Also, After intordution of both data and metadata url, what is supposed to
appear in the metadata menu?

Thanks again for the help.

Sorry I got a few typos in the last email.


Sorry only now I could check the links to use on the metadata example for
qgis user manual.

I'm not being able to do it. For the Ren?-Luc examples from bretagne I'm
not being able to download the data it self (it's password protected)

For INSPIRE data, I'm not being able to get the metadata link.

Also, after introdution of both data and metadata url, what is supposed to
appear in the metadata menu?

Thanks again for the help.

If you have translation fixes, there is a small window to get them in to
the release branch before I tag it. Again please ask Juergen or myself to
make the commits to the release branch so that we can manage what goes into
it carefully.

Hi Alexandre,

Here is the WMS MetadataURL element definition :
A server should use one or more <MetadataURL> elements to offer 
detailed, standardized metadata about the
data corresponding to a particular layer. The "type" attribute indicates 
the standard to which the metadata
complies. Two "type" attribute values are defined by this International 
Standard: the value "ISO 19115:2003"
refers to ISO 19115:2003; the value "FGDC:1998" refers to 
FGDC-STD-001-1998 [1]. An information community
may define meanings for other "type" attribute values. The enclosed 
<Format> element indicates the file format
MIME type of the metadata record.

MetadataURL has to be link to the Metadata file.

Regards,
Ren?-Luc D'Hont

I added the PSC list yesterday:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/commit/09e2716e21a2cce95db6876f2cdda3d7d6df6375

There is still too much duplication of info, IMHO. We shoudl concentrate on rst for
most things, leaving the wiki for more dynamic stuff, open to a wider public.

All the best.

Hi,

Other applications have unified setting centers like firefox when you 
enter about:config in the URL bar. But this is in addition to the 
settings dialog(s) which is/are still offered. Are you thinking about 
something like this? A simple config value editor, like regedit?

Or is the aim of this project a unified config dialog, where plugins 
register their own tab (or list entry or whatsoever)? In this case, 
would it be a new dialog "Plugin Options" which would act as container 
for all options? Or opening up the "Options" dialog for registering 
additional tabs? IMO the first one has the drawback of brandmarking 
plugins as 3rd-party, not fully integrated, while the second one has 
the drawback/risk of cluttering this dialog.

Talking about this, I recently did a similar thing for the vector layer 
properties (add the possibility to add a new tab for plugins. POC 
implemented in form of layer specific globe settings, not yet merged)

Cheers
Matthias

The idea is to have that common place for all settings. The bad thing
that I see (and some people have told me), is that it might be
difficult to find for a user that searches for a configuration panel
for a given plugin, since he might look for it in the menu of that
plugin. A solution to that would be to make it easy to call the
settigns dialog, but open in the tab (or panel, or whatever),
corresponding to a given plugin. So there would be a "plugin options"
menu, with all options, but a plugin author could add a shortcut to
that and add a "setting of my plugin" menu entry which would go
straight to those settings.

The thing is to avoid developers creating their own panels and dialogs
for settings, which is time consuming and each one looks differently.

I would suggest a design similar to the eclipse one, with a tree in
the left hand side where you have all plugins, and once you select
one, you see all its parameters in the right-hand side panel.

If anyone is interested, we can discuss this in the HF. It looks to me
like a nice thing to work on, and we can also adapt some existing
plugins to use it, once it is done.

cheers
V?ctor

Hi all,

Congratulations for the 2.0 branch :)
Now that pull requests can be considered again, one of mine have been
asked to be merged soon :
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/658

Unfortunately there is a small conflict against the last master.
This is almost nothing (an init in Qgscomposition's ctor and a
declaration in .sip), but I won't have time to test it soon.

Could someone have a look a it ?
(Marco ? you said you want to review)
Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Master doesn't compile
Message-ID: <201309051420.08065.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

JEF, after your commit [1] QGIS doesn't compile anymore. The make stops saying:

CMakeFiles/qgis_app.dir/main.cpp.o: In function `dumpBacktrace':
/home/borys/sources/qgis/src/app/main.cpp:229: undefined reference to `QgsLogger::debug(QString const&, int, char const*, char const*, int)'
/home/borys/sources/qgis/src/app/main.cpp:244: undefined reference to `QgsLogger::debug(QString const&, int, char const*, char const*, int)'
/home/borys/sources/qgis/src/app/main.cpp:258: undefined reference to `QgsLogger::debug(QString const&, int, char const*, char const*, int)'
(...)

Seems it's because in main.cpp you introduced some calls to QgsDebugMsg
(what is defined as QgsLogger::debug() in the qgslogger.h). But the same 
syntax is used in other classes (e.g. QgsAbout) and compiles ok. I have no idea
what's going on.

Of course I did make clean and even removed whole build/src directory.

I have implemented something like this some time ago, based on a gui from
QT - Settings Editor.

I am not sure if I never commited it or if someone removed it.

I will try to find the code and submit a pull request.

I have made some publicity before for a library which handles plugin 
settings.
http://3nids.github.io/qgissettingmanager/

Basically, the idea is that it you create once the settings somewhere in 
your plugin and then it handles type validation, defaut values, etc. The 
most interesting part is that you have a SettingDialog class, which 
automatically read/write widgets if you name them accordingly to the 
settings (it handles several widgets for all the different types of 
settings).

This small lib is very time saving for the few plugins I have.

Maybe an idea would be to translate this to a QgsPluginSetting class 
which would then list all the settings to be edited in the main plugin 
setting window.

Cheers,

Denis

So it seems that at least two people had worked on this previously...
I am glad that I asked :-)

Let's see if we can put all that together and make it more visible, so
people can use it easily

the work I have is a dialog in core, in src/gui folder. It is opened via a
new menu item in the Settings menu. Preliminary support for custom settings
and description. Perhaps both could be merged into a single gui class which
would be available to core and plugins?

Message-ID: <52289ABD.80306@gmx.ch>

Hi,

The last couple of months, (almost?) every pull request has a core
developer assigned. I personally think, the idea is good to make
somebody responsible for the pull request (who can pass it on if
required of course) so they don't get forgotten.

However, I just found a pull request which is assigned to me and I
didn't realize before. Same happened already several times, when asking
an assigned developer about the status, he normally didn't know about
his assignment. At the same time, others will hesitate from taking care
of a pull request assigned to somebody else.

Now, I guess somebody is assigning these? Is this done by any criteria?
And has somebody found a solution to get notifications about assignments
or have a list of one's assigned pull requests? Is there a plan for the
process of pull requests, so they don't just pile up until we totally
loose the overview?

Matthias

Hi Matthias

I'm assigning the pull requests normally.

>And has somebody found a solution to get notifications about assignments

Hm, I thought github sends out notifications whenever something changes 
in a pull request. But maybe it is only for new requests, comments and 
closes?

Marco

I've been also sometimes assigning my own pull requests to Jurgen,
now I'm not sure he ever got notified about them. I took the chance
to merge those requests myself:

 https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/805
 https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/777

There are still 36 open pull requests, some of which fix real bugs.
I hope assigners can find the time to review them as there might be
good stuff to put in 2.0.0.

There's no way to get the list of assigned tickets from the UI,
which sucks :( -- would it be possible to automatically file a
ticket on hub when a pull request is made on github ?

Very important to get those notifications. To this end, I added a pull
request and assigned it to you (feel free to close or commit it). Please
verify you are receiving the notification that I assigned it to you.

I already verified with Marco, and he got no verification, and I didn't 
either.

Marco is looking for an option to enable these notifications. In case 
there's nothing I think we should open a ticket on github's github page 
(I just guess there is one :-) )
I shortly checked, the information would be present in the github API, 
but honestly, we got enough issues to solve in our software.

Matthias

Remember github is not free software...

How about disabling pull requests from github as a whole and rely on
the existing bug tracker for that ? It's just a matter of including
someone's repository url and branch name to make a pull request,
and there's even a convenience `git request-pull` command to generate
the text for you.

Hi all,
not sure if is something that should worry, but I noticed that in the
nigtly windows standalone installer there is no grass plugin and grass
itself (installed by same installer) is not working ("The procedure
entry point libintl_setlocale could not be located in the dynamic link
library libintl-8.dll"). Should I file a ticket?

Hi (Victor),

it seems that the check for saga in sextante is not working anymore
also on Windows (it wasn't working on Linux), not sure if also the
code tagged for the 2.0 release is affected.

cheers

Giovanni,

I have made a commit a few minutes ago, which hopefully fixes all
those problems with saga

the tagged 2.0 version is affected by these problem, but let's see if
we can add this change, since it is an important one and will nto
break anything, so i guess it is safe (and much needed) to add it

Thanks!

Same here. The worst of all is that there is no way how to actually
find out which pull requests are assigned to me unless I go through
them one by one. Some time ago I have asked GitHub guys about that -
they told me that it is possible to see what is assigned to you, but
we would need to turn on GitHub issue tracking system where this
feature is integrated...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] MapAction QGIS plugin development: data management
	and metadata harvesting
Message-ID: <CACY0gT7+OExSKyQ3HZ2Xcw1iVsRZhz760StYycRBepQ4QD89Uw@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Assuming this is the appropriate place to post, this to let anyone who
might be interested know that MapAction has put together some requirements
for QGIS plugin(s) which come from its RAMP project (Resilient Action for
Mapping Preparedness), whose aim is to help build capacity in information
management and GIS amongst agencies dealing with humanitarian disaster
response.

The requirements (which are still being added to), plus a prototype QGIS
plugin which implements some of them, have been published as a GitHub
repository (RAMP-QGIS) at https://github.com/mapaction/RAMP-QGIS. The aim
is to extend QGIS to support users in file and data management, and in
metadata harvesting and exploitation, building on work done at an
AGI/MapAction hackathon earlier in the year, and on internal MapAction
development work.

We are hoping that developers and others will want to get involved either
by contributing directly, or by helping us develop and manage the process ?
this model of development is new to MapAction, so any support we can get in
making it productive both for us and others who might find the outputs
useful will be really welcome.

If there's anywhere else people think it might be useful to post (QGIS
Users?), let us know, but in the meantime please pass this on to anyone who
you think might be interested, and post any questions or comments either
here or on the GitHub site.

Many thanks

Ant Scott, MapAction

Is it ok if we take a pic in Brighton?
It could be something generic until then. If you want, I  can whip something up.

Right now, any users checking out the latest nightly are presented with a
splash that denotes 1.9 (assuming they have the splash turned on) instead
of 2.1. Not a big deal, but could confuse some users.

Maybe replace that with a new layout that will basically be the same as
when the Brighton photo is included? May be good to have the layout's style
be similar to the new stable version's splash, e.g. square corners and
choice of font; but, not too similar, so it is easy to see at a glance
which version you have launched.

Regards,

Larry

Thank you for the answer Daniel!

I still do not understand what I must do to have the plugin detected. Is
that folder the one I have to create? There does not appear a folder with
QGIS 2 in any of the existing folder structure created 1.8 and 1.9. I have
not tried 2.0.

Hey Anita,

I would just remove the 2.1 number as people might thing it's a released
version. Maybe replace it with Dev

Maybe some kind of map done in QGIS as background...? A suggestion for 
an easy solution - Anita, you have some maps from your tutorials/blog, 
for example, like this one from here...

http://anitagraser.com/2013/07/29/vintage-map-design-using-qgis/

or from the flickr group...

Thanks a lot for your efforts!

all the best,
Albin

Hi Swapan,

You can have a look at the QGIS source code on github [1]
It is hard to tell, if it suits your needs. For rendering, creating and 
editing shape files you would not need to adjust the software at all 
and could just use it as is, without messing with the source code at 
all.
There would also highly customize it to your needs by using the 
customization menu. [2] Or you could even build an own application 
using these libraries if you see a reason for doing so. [3]

FYI: It is not using OpenGL at all (apart from the globe plugin)

Regards,
Matthias

	different size?
Message-ID: <CAFO80_q8vThnTXp5TDypv1Lv3UQMsKG8LZzmXsFuiPH-oj5H+A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I'm working/investigating hwo to add WMS legend (GetLegendGraphics) in the
legend tree (QgsLegend : QTreeWidget)

**the context:
I've a WMS legend that is a pixmap because of is obtained usiging
GetLegendGraphic WMS call.
I want to show this legend as in the attached image:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12837459/WMSLegend.png

**problems:
as you can see in the image I'm able to display the legend pixmap, doing
setIcon for the Item (Aka QgsLegendSymbolgyItem) and setSize in QTreeWidget
(AKA QgsLegend)
In this way all the icons are set to the same Size (WRONG!)

**the QT way?:
in QT literature the solution is adding a QStyleItemDelegate or
QItemDelegate to the QTreeWidget (QgsLegend). In this delegate I can choose
how to display and size all I want overloading paint and sizeHint methods.

**The architectural problem:
The problem I found is that adding an ItemDelegate it works for all
elements displayed in the Tree, but the actual architecture of the Legend
draw it's element in different code sites... (QgsLegend has different
architecture form the Legend in Composer)

**Solutions?
There is someone that solved or approached this problem?

Thank you and see you in Brighton, Luigi Pirelli (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it)

I like the layout and color selection. Not sure I understand the leaf (?)
background, though QGIS is used quite a bit for forestry and bio-sciences.

Just a thought: maybe instead try a bunch of translucent icons (new icons
for add layers?) floating/swirling around. I realize this is just an
interim splash, but could be something like that might make a good graphic
for the web site as well. That really is one of QGIS strongest core
features: its ability to work with so many providers, both open and
proprietary. Plus those new layer icons look good.

If the new group photo is similar to the last two (a row or two of faces),
then the use of both dev and master words in the layout means dev may cover
some faces. 'Master' is really from git nomenclature, while dev is probably
more commonly understood. So, I suggest just removing master and lowering
dev to make more room for the photo. Maybe try dev in the master's yellow,
then.


Regards,

Larry

Hi Saber

Thanks for getting the room - can you confirm what the room availability
hours will be on that page? Normal expectation is that the room should be
open until the last man drops - though maybe there are transport or other
limiting factors to how late we can use the venue?

Also It would be nice if we can eat most of our evening meals in-situ (and
definately lunches) so that those who want to burn their eyeballs with QGIS
code can get a proper chance to do so.

Regards

Tim

I just like the colors. It will only be used for a couple of days, and  
there are a lot of other things that still requrire attention before the  
Hackfest and FOSS4G, so I think I'll leave it.

Sorry, I don't think I can pull that off.

Once we have some photos to chose from, I'm sure we'll find a way to make  
a decent splash. I'm not emotionally invested in either "master" or "dev"  
use. If we need the space, I'll happily get rid of "master".

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Tim,

The official hours are between 9 am to 6 pm. Outside those hours, if
someone leaves the building they need to be let. I will confirm the
latest time possible to be at the venue with Pedram tomorrow. The trains
run until mid-night.

Lunches and catering will be at the venue. As per Paolo's suggestion, we
are arranging pizza delivery for most of the nights. On that note, any
one with dietary requirements please let me know.


Cheers,
Saber

Think the issue is dragged for no reason. We have a dev / master branch
splash screen that says 1.9 alpha while we debate on leaf ...

its important to have a splash screen that's relevant. So, high time that
we change that.

The debate can go on after that.

My 2 cents


Ted

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.0.0 Final Tagged - call for packaging
Message-ID: <CALCNqkaS9oge6CSAQNxWDRO-phOpoq-+1Gpu_2fwVbb+dOV8KQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

--- Note to casual readers ---

Please do not pre-announce this release - give the packagers and release
team a chance to do their thing so that people hearing about the release
have a fair chance of finding a package, reading all our press material
etc.

Especially for this release, I would like to coincide the release
announcement with the launch of our new web site which the community team
and opengeo have been working really hard at. So please wait until we are
ready to announce before blogging, tweeting, etc, about the new release.

--- End note ---

I have tagged QGIS 2.0.0 for release. The branch can be checked out
like this (as a tracking branch)

git clone git://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git
git branch --track release-2_0 origin/release-2_0
git checkout release-2_0

Or (to check out the final tagged version made a few hours ago):

git fetch
git checkout final-2_0_0

The tag is signed with my GPG key:

user: "Tim Sutton (QGIS Key) <tim at linfiniti.com>"
1024-bit DSA key, ID 97626237, created 2007-07-19

Source tarballs can be obtained from here:

http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2.0.0.tar.bz2
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2.0.0.tar.bz2.md5

Packagers:

Please hold your packages until you hear more from me so that we can
coordinate the release announcement with the new web site announcement. I
expect that will be at the end of this week or over the weekend coming.

Some notes:

- Please do not commit anything to the 2_0_0 branch except packaging
related tweaks pending further notification from myself or Juergen.
- If you make a package please be so kind as to update the download wiki
page at http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download with the details of your package
(taking into account the hold-until-the-site-is-ready note above).
- If you are able to make packages for unlisted platforms / distros
please discuss your plans on this thread so that we can avoid duplication
of effort.
- I would like to make the release announcement next week, so it will be
great to have as many packages as possible ready by then.
- GIT master is open again for general commits - please seek guidance
from Marco Hugentobler (PSC Code Manager) if you are planning any major
code changes.
- Juergen Fischer (incoming PSC Release Manager) will be managing the
release process for future releases, so please follow his lead in terms of
code freeze etc in master.

Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS 2.0.0 a
reality!

Lastly can I call on the release team (or any interested people) to help to
put together visual changelog (link below), press announcements etc. ready
for the release date? I will send you an email when the packages are ready
and you can start broadcasting announcements.

Visual Changelog Page: http://changelog.linfiniti.com/version/1/ (this is
the site for drafting the release, the final release content will be on the
official QGIS web site). Please contact me if you would like to contribute
to the changelog and I will give you the needed permissions.


Best regards

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-u1RdL00=YGUVDPCcn4ROX=dt9vK8eHjs8y734GkOySA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

With the release of 2.0 not far away I have created a new Flickr page
dedicated to collecting screenshots of QGIS.  Some of these will be used on
the new website to show off the UI.

Screenshots can be of anything in the program just as long as it's the
latest 2.0 version. Please tag any images with qgis-2.0 so images can be
added in later versions without overlap.

The group is at http://www.flickr.com/groups/qgis-screenshots/

Regards,
Nathan

Tim, the visual changelog draft is excellent, excellent resource for QGIS
evangelists out there. I'd re-think the new labeling engine screenshot,
maybe a map screenshot featuring shield and drop shadow instead of the
configuration dialog (which is shown in the data-defined labeling section
anyways)?

Good job,

M

Re labels, I meant something like this:
http://imgur.com/jUndyYK,JHgeT39#0http://imgur.com/jUndyYK,JHgeT39#0

Could also be worth showing a more radical example of layer blending, such
as:
http://imgur.com/jUndyYK,JHgeT39#1http://imgur.com/jUndyYK,JHgeT39#1

I'm not suggesting the above two images should be used, merely referring to
those as alternatives to relying on a user interface as screenshot to
showcase feature X,Y,Z

isn't it better to go straight to https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website ?
it will be painful to merge these chnages back into
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blob/master/source/website/forusers/alldownloads.rst

Thanks Tim for the effort.

All the best.

We just did a test and didn't find a solution for getting a list of 
assigned pull requests (or assignment notifications) even with issue 
tracking turned on. It seems you only get this list for issues assigned 
to you, but still not for pull requests. So we would still need to open 
an issue for every pull request. We can do that on our own issue 
tracker also I guess.

Marco, did your "assigned to @developer" test work?

in a project I work (using github) each pull request gets an automatic 
issue as well [0]

I don't know maybe there is a setting?

Hello Tim,

WMTS support is not listed in the changelog. Does it mean that there is no 
WMTS support?

WMTS suport has been added after QGIS 1.8 by J?rgen, one year ago I think and 
has never been in an official released but I am be wrong.

Maybe we could use issue tracking on github for pull requests only?

Ah, that's the way it's supposed to work.

I'm sure people will start to file issues there as well. I would say we 
use either github issue tracking or redmine issue tracking, but not 
both.

Can I suggest to the windows packagers (especially OSGeo4w admins) that QGIS is linked to gdal 1.10 so Esri FileGDB support works. I see only the testing 64bit OsGeo4w distribution has built gdal 1.10, so the gdal OSGeo4w maintainers might need a nudge to build it in the 32bit release version :)

Thanks
Jeremy

Agreed. Unfortunately, work on osgeo4w is uncoordinated, and efforts seem done on a
personal basis. Volunteers to improve the situation?
All the best.

Well the idea of the app I have written is to provide a curated, community
edited platform that makes it quick and easy to build a changelog. My
experience with doing it on the blog or in sphinx does not meet those
requirements. For example with my tool you can simply use shutter to grab
an image and drag and drop it onto the changelog entry and it will resize
it etc as needed depending on the report view. It also provides a more
rigorous structure for changelog entries so that the actual changelog comes
out looking neat and visually consistent. I am busy writing an outputer for
the app that will generate a sphinx doc - which I will put into the QGIS
doc tree. When I have time I will deploy it into the qgis.org django app
(my app is written in django too).

We windows qgis packagers (me, myself and I) are going to use what currently is
in osgeo4w.

As far as I know there will be a GDAL 1.10.1.1 release soon.  I'm going to
update the 64bit gdal with that and Frank Warmerdam will update OSGeo4W 32bit
(but there's no known timeframe for that - maybe he finds time on FOSS4G).

I wrote down some ideas I have for discussing there on the wiki page.

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/10_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Brighton_2013#Topics

Feel free to add your own or add notes to mine.

Maybe we should add a schedule, so remote participants can join and we 
can also plan our time-slots accordingly there.
I will start a doodle tomorrow morning with the topics present by this 
time. The topics with most votes will then be scheduled.

Regards,
Matthias

Hi Tim,

I discussed with Werner about running a small session about the
architecture of the Processing plugin and how to easily develop new
algorithms for it. If anyone else finds this interesting, let me know
and we can organize it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Ticket cleanup after 2.0 release
Message-ID: <2701158.lVe8roQyU2@robbe2>

Hi,

With currently ~1700 open bug and feature request tickets, keeping track of 
open tickets gets harder and harder. Since many tickets are quite old, maybe 
solved or not appropriate anymore, I propose a cut following the 2.0 release. 
Means we close all tickets with a comment asking to reopen, if the ticket 
still applies to 2.0.

Cheers
Pirmin

I will surely attend!

Already have a few suggestions to extend the current existing algorithms ..

And of course - the more people know howto create and extend sextante
- the more algorithms will be available ..

looking forward to talk with you all!

Seems to be a very good idea to me

for the reporter it should not be hard to reopen the ticket ..
but (not only for the developers) for new reporters searching if the
bug already exists is sometimes impossible

even though, now IMHO the lack of documentation is a limiting factor, more than lack
of algs
we'll do something on that too

+1, I also like this idea.

I would also like to reintroduce the idea of auto-closing tickets which 
are in "Feedback" state for more than 2 weeks to keep the count low in 
the future. Issues in "Feedback" state should be treated as "cannot be 
solved with the current amount of information" and therefore shouldn't 
be crowding the overview of active tickets until somebody provides the 
missing bits.

Regards
Matthias

Ah sorry I didnt read carefully enough. Yes the ultimate download page
should be in the new website. I'll send out a separate message asking
packagers to submit a pull request on the download page. Richard do you
have a page ready for this?

Thanks - Alex mentioned this already - I will be sure to add it. Borys how
about a nice entry describing the locale support work you did for vector
layers? Can you provide a screenshot of QGIS data in some exotic language?

Thanks!

Yes, there already has been an 'advanced/all downloads page' for a while 
available (besides the one on hub). Currently that is:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blob/master/source/website/forusers/alldownloads.rst

on the site:
http://new.qgis.org/html/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html

We decided to also have an 'simple' download page: one with not so much 
options, or maybe hiding all the options which are not for your current 
Operating System, or are not for the average user.

The beginning is here:

http://new.qgis.org/html/en/site/forusers/download.html

It is a full html page for which Opengeo wants to do the further magic.

Regards,

Richard

ps sorry for all broken links in the html pages of the website, the 
website content is moved to a subdir 'site', and while we are still 
discussing if we should or should not incorporate the docs in the 
website, I do not want to update those paths yet

Hi Pirming,
thanks for raising the issue. I'd be a bit careful about autoclosing. Tickets are a
huge source of knowledge about the program, often are opened as placeholder not to
forget missing function that we'll deal with, sooner or later, etc.
Besides that, users will sometimes take this as impolite, or think that we are trying
to hide problems, and refrain from getting involved with the project.
Me and Giovanni Manghi have dealt with (and opened[0]) many hundreds of tickets, and
I think nothing can replace careful consideration.
Having said that, I agree that if a ticket has no feedback for weeks, and is probably
a local issue, is better be closed.
Please do some careful simulation, checking the likely results, before acting.
This is by no means a secondary issue, as it involves our public image, and the
relations with our community.

All the best.

if it's in rst, we can add it to the normal translation workflow (which would be very

Hi,

Can you please leave us some time to modify the QGIS version of some 
issues, in order to keep the important ones to 2.1.
For example, I think some important issues shall not be closed yet for 
QGIS Server, but moved to 2.1 version.

Regards,
Ren?-Luc D'Hont

I agree with Paolo,

please do not close tickets automatically... yet.


Let me work on the queue during the HF, I'm sure that many features
requests tickets can be closed.

I know well the bug queue and I'm not so sure that there are many
tickets that can be closed, most of them are real issue. Eventually I
can make a report and we can discuss what to do.

cheers

Hi all,

this is a follow up of the other day message where I was noticing
issues with grass in the standalone/nightly packages of qgis.

Today I can confim this

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8588

On qgis 64bit osgeo4w GRASS itself works, while modules are crashing
when used under QGIS, both in the grass plugin and the processing
framework.

I added the possibility to copy vector features from WMS layers, it appeared in
Unapproved Entries, can you approve?

Should I make a screenshot/entry for multicolumn legend in composer?

Sure I can, but publishing strings I can't understand is a bit risky ;-) So it 
would be great if Minoru Akagi* or anyone from non-latin world could find a 
time to do it meaningfully.

* Sorry for my bad manners, just spent half an hour with google and still 
don't really know how should I address you in emails: by the full name or 
rather Akagi3 or Akagi-kun? :)

Do you mean the identify WMS results format entry? If yes I approved it,
thanks very much!

Sure that would be great thanks! I have made you staff so you can self

-1

Do you really think there is a large number of open tickets which are
no longer applicable?  It seems unlikely to me.

Also, I'd note that biggest difficulty when searching existing tickets
before filing a new one is that it is impossible to _search_ only open
tickets.  (Last time I checked this was an open ticket for redmine - I
haven't checked whether there is a new version which implements it).

BTW, looking at a couple of my closed tickets, it looks like users do
now actually have the power to reopen their closed tickets, which was
a problem in the past.  Do we know if this is working reliably
everywhere now?

Alister

-1 to this too.

When a ticket is marked as "Feedback", even if the user provides the
feedback requested, they do not have the power to change the status
from "Feedback" to anything except "Closed", so currently this would
result in closing a lot of tickets which shouldn't be closed.
If that is fixed then this idea might be OK, but it might not be
necessary, because the list of tickets marked as "Feedback" should
reduce a lot if tickets don't stay marked as "Feedback" even after the
feedback has been provided...
Also, how about allowing more than 2 weeks; perhaps 1 or 2 months?

Alister

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Spatial Index Destructor - Python
Message-ID: <CA+bfmPt_a+hcnzhbWa+=Uci2qDa66xYwb4bSY04JBho4OuozrQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am running QGIS 1.9 and developing a plugin that uses a spatial index to
improve intersection performance.  I am struggling to properly destroy the
spatial index and unload it.

The workflow that I am using is:

1. Load a point layer.
2. Create temporary, in-memory polylines and a spatial index on them.
3. Draw a line (rubberband) and split an in memory polyline.
4. Update the point layer attributes that tag a point to be a member of a
temporary line.
5. Remove the in memory layer and recreate it, plus spatial index, using
the new membership criteria.

The first time the temporary layer is created the spatial index works as
expected.  When I recreate the temporary layer, I create another instance
of QgsSpatialIndex.  The old spatial index appears to still be stored.  I
say this because the id() of the spatial index are doubled the send time.

For example, the first time I have ids -1 to -4 in the spatial index.  Then
I split and I have ids -1 to -9.  Re-instantiating the class should be
resetting the spatial index counter, but it isn't.

Is the ~QgsSpatialIndex method accessible via python?  This appears to be
the destructor of choice?  Any other ideas?

class slicer:

    def init(self):
        '''standard stuff here'''
    def activated(self):
        '''standard stuff here'''
        create_temp_polylines()

    def create_temp_polylines(self):
        self.line_layer = QgsVectorLayer('Make the layer')
        self.spat_index = QgsSpatialIndex()
        self.point_layer = point_layer #Grabbed by iterating over layer list
        pt_prov = self.point_layer.dataProvider()
        polylines = {}
        for feat in self.point_layer.dataProvider():
            '''build the line geometries based on a membership attribute'''
        for key, value in polyline.iteritems():
            temp_polyline = QgsFeature()
            temp_polyline.setGeometry(value)
            temp_polyline.setAttributes([attr1, attr2, ...])
            line_layer.startEditing()
            line_layer.addFeature(temp_polyline, True)
            self.spat_index.insertFeature(temp_polyline)
        line_layer.commitChanges()

    def split_line(self, cut_line):
        '''logic to split a polyline'''
        '''logic to update the attribute table'''
        '''commit the changes to the DB'''
        QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayer(self.line_layer.id())
        self.create_temp_polylines()

Agreed, a real problem.

You can decide during the HF, whether I should run a script once for closing 
tickets. It's possible to limit the affected tickets e.g. by version or 
assignement.
I also recommend setting the target version of open 2.0 tickets to "Version X 
- Unplanned" unless you know, that someone will work on it.

Hi Swapan,

The code should compile for ARM, as it's does for the QGIS for Android 
project.

Regarding Open GL, there is probably not much experience around in this 
project, but maybe someone will chime in.

And you will probably have more response, if you CC the mailing list :)

Matthias

We should clearly state in the Changelog as well that Quantum GIS officially 
changed its name to "QGIS" !

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all.
I'll be giving a workshop soon:
http://2013.foss4g.org/conf/programme/workshops/10/
I would like to focus it on new QGIS 2.0 functions, so my idea is to take the
changelog and prepare an example for each of the new features (excluding those
unsuitable for a workshop, of course). Maybe this could be useful to show around also
after FOSS4G, therefore it may make sense to expand Tim's visual changelog, add
sample data, and perhaps add it to docs.
The main issue is, of course, time, so I'd appreciate some help.
Is anybody willing to join the effort?
All the best.

I will certainly be putting in more entries into the changelog over the
next day or two.

For sample data, lets just use an established dataset e.g. QGIS Alaska,
Natural Earth or one of the others kicking around instead of inventing
something new.

Am I still co-presenting the workshop with you?

Regards

Tim

Hi All

Because of the ommission of copyright / acknowledgment to Swisstopo for the
splash screen, I will be putting out a 2.0.1 bugfix release. So 2.0.0 will
be a purely conceptual release. I will make the source archives available
later tonight. My apologies to all packagers for any invoncenience caused.

Despite the .1 designation, we should still continue marketing this release
as QGIS 2.0.

Regards

Tim

Hi happy HF-ers,

Is it possible to record and publish this sessions (by Victor) and the 
other?
I'm ready to participate online (IRC, ...), but recorded one will give 
much stronger feedback and attract more developers.
regards,
Robert

Hi !

Thanks for this and sorry for the late reaction.

I've just added a topic in the wiki about support for 3D in QGIS.
We would like to discuss the state of Globe and other projects and
possibles steps to make QGIS aware of a third dimension and able to
display it.

Could you please Matthias add another column ?

Hi Robert,

We are arranging the webcasting and people should be able to see the talks
live. The main thing is to sort out the time table so people from different
time zones can re schedule their sleeping times!

Mathias K, would you be able to schedule a (loose) programme of the talks
after the votes?

Cheers,
Saber

Hi Saber,

I will do so tomorrow.
I expect the sessions to be more of an informal "round table" and not a 
"presentation talk" as such. Although I hope we get somebody to give 
some initial input in most of the sessions.

Nathan asked me for being able to participate in some and I think these 
will have to be scheduled rather in the morning, he is GMT+10 afaik.

Let's see if Larry or somebody else of the other end of the big lake 
would like to participate in some talks as well.

I also noticed, that there are two different kind of people. The 
technical ones vs. the web and documentation interested ones. So we 
could also run some sessions in parallel.

Fantastic. The reason I proposed to have a loose programme was to keep Nathan happy :>

I like the idea of the informal round tables, but I will try to set up
my system so I can record the screen and the voice and have that
session recorded. It won't be a formal lesson/workshop, but i think it
might be interesting for some people, and it should not be difficult
to do.

Hi

Can I suggest we divide the sessions into two: round table discussions (any
time of day, not recorded) and presentations (scheduled times, recorded).
The round tables can follow presentations where needed. So the format would
work e.g. Victor presents his Next Big Idea as a presentation and then the
discussions related to it break away for a round table discussion.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.0.1 Final Tagged - call for packaging
Message-ID: <CALCNqkZ-=8_-S3R5vBXanZR6VGWEuzeA9umKeFUxcfNh_ekDAw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

This is a copy and paste of my previous email for the 2.0 release, but with
details added for the 2.0.1 bugfix. The bugfix addresses concerns about the
missing swisstopo acknowledgement for the splash screen map and in the
process introduces a few small cleanups and bug fixes, plus an update for
spanish translations.

Note that I will be travelling to Brighton now so any further point
releases will need to be made when I arrive (of course they won't be needed
right?).

Packagers, please discard packaging effors on 2.0.0 and focus rather on
2.0.1. Updated content follows:

--- Note to casual readers ---

Please do not pre-announce this release - give the packagers and release
team a chance to do their thing so that people hearing about the release
have a fair chance of finding a package, reading all our press material
etc.

Especially for this release, I would like to coincide the release
announcement with the launch of our new web site which the community team
and opengeo have been working really hard at. So please wait until we are
ready to announce before blogging, tweeting, etc, about the new release.

--- End note ---

I have tagged QGIS 2.0.1 for release. The branch can be checked out
like this (as a tracking branch)

git clone git://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git
git branch --track release-2_0 origin/release-2_0
git checkout release-2_0

Or (to check out the final tagged version made a few hours ago):

git fetch
git checkout final-2_0_1

The tag is signed with my GPG key:

user: "Tim Sutton (QGIS Key) <tim at linfiniti.com>"
1024-bit DSA key, ID 97626237, created 2007-07-19

Source tarballs can be obtained from here:

http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2.0.1.tar.bz2
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2.0.1.tar.bz2.md5

Packagers:

Please hold your packages until you hear more from me so that we can
coordinate the release announcement with the new web site announcement. I
expect that will be at the end of this week or over the weekend coming.

Some notes:

- Please do not commit anything to the 2_0 branch except packaging
related tweaks pending further notification from myself or Juergen.
- If you make a package please be so kind as to update the download wiki
page at http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download with the details of your package
(taking into account the hold-until-the-site-is-ready note above).
- If you are able to make packages for unlisted platforms / distros
please discuss your plans on this thread so that we can avoid duplication
of effort.
- I would like to make the release announcement next week, so it will be
great to have as many packages as possible ready by then.
- GIT master is open again for general commits - please seek guidance
from Marco Hugentobler (PSC Code Manager) if you are planning any major
code changes.
- Juergen Fischer (incoming PSC Release Manager) will be managing the
release process for future releases, so please follow his lead in terms of
code freeze etc in master.

Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS 2.0 a
reality!

Lastly can I call on the release team (or any interested people) to help to
put together visual changelog (link below), press announcements etc. ready
for the release date? I will send you an email when the packages are ready
and you can start broadcasting announcements.

Visual Changelog Page: http://changelog.linfiniti.com/version/1/ (this is
the site for drafting the release, the final release content will be on the
official QGIS web site). Please contact me if you would like to contribute
to the changelog and I will give you the needed permissions.


Best regards

I added the point in the Wiki. This (round table session) will take
place Friday afternoon. I hope we'll get a QML professional there :)

the format would work e.g. Victor presents his Next Big Idea as a
presentation and then the discussions related to it break away for a
round table discussion.

I like the idea. Wherever we have somebody who is willing to give a
presentation we should do it this way.

Anybody who wants to act as a speaker, please let me know or write your
name next to the topic on the Wiki page [1].

Hi,

I added a topic about Python Plugins Repository (and installer).

We (mainly me and Borys) have some problems to solve about QGIS versioning
scheme and the qgisMaximumVersion metadata tag.

We can extend the discussion about new features or plugin repository
enhancements.

Ideally, somebody who know the details about QGIS versioning scheme should
participate.

Hi,

I'll be at Heathrow's airport tomorrow (more or less 17:30).. I think I'll
get the bus to Brighton (york place). From T3 I'll get this one:
http://www.nationalexpress.com/home.aspx

and then to Ibis hothel netar railway station

I can see there are other arriving at the same time... how do they reach
Brighton?

see you tomorrow, Luigi Pirelli

I am arriving at Gatwick instead, around 11am. I see other people
arriving around the same time (Matteo, Larissa...and maybe some others
who did not enter arrival time in the wiki). Shall we coordinate to
take the train?

Let me know if you all arrive at Brighton station at the same time, so I can
ask a colleague to come and pick you up from there!

When you buy your train ticket from Gatwick Airport, make sure you get
ticket (off-peak same day return: ?9.70) to Falmer! Saves you a quid and
time for queuing in Brighton station!

Cheers,
Saber

I was thinking about leaving my stuff in the hotel before going to
Falmer. Does the ticket Gatwick-Falmer allow to stop at Brighton,
check in at the hotel, and then go back to the train for going to
Falmer? Or you were suggesting going straight from the airport to the
venue?

Thanks!

Victor,

The ticket will be fine. You can get out of the station 3 minutes walk to
the hotel and drop your bags and get back inside the station. Just to be
safe...don't put it through the barriers and ask the person to open the gate
for you.

See you tomorrow.
Saber

Hi Victor,
yes i should arrive at 11 am. It will be great if we can take the train 
all together. So where/when should we meet?
BTW: I'm never been in Gatwick airport...

Hi Marco,

That was the plan but we managed to move everything to Sussex Uni.
I am only aware of Brighton Coach station. Not sure if it has a stop closer
to Brighton Train station. It is worth asking the driver. Gino mentioned
York Place, but I guess it is for coaches leaving Brighton.
Finding the train station should be straight forward.

The coach might also have wifi!


See you tomorrow.
Saber

Saber, I bought a ticket to Coach Station, (near Pier) because back then the
wiki stated that we would meet at little bay. do I better get of that bus
somewhere else?

ciao see you tomorrow

I hope to arrive to Ibis hotel at 20:30... do you think I'm in time to reach

I'll be by bicycle from Ibis!

Or do you think to wait in the Hotel?

When you buy your train ticket from Gatwick Airport, make sure you get

Hi (again) Marco!

Giffgaff is fine. The coverage is good as well. I ordered it a couple of
times online. Not sure if you can get it from shop. Otherwise T-mobile (no
EE I think) are offering good data only sims as well.

Cheers,
Saber

Generally, since the name changed officially, we should do a "Quantum" Hunting 
party, so that the transition is made faster and users do not get confused.

I can't recall how long mine took. But from the website, if you order before
2pm it will arrive next day.
You can just pop into the shop on your way to the station and get the sim
card:

It looks great! Especially with setValueOnWidgetUpdate=True, as I understand, 
I'm able to make interactive settings (reading values in the runtime, setting 
one widget depending on other widget value), without any need of direct access 
to widgets, I mean staying purely within this layer of abstraction. It's 
really nice.

Of course, I understand graying out widgets and changing list of combobox' 
items still needs direct access.

Similarly to Alex, I prefer interactive and aesthetically hand-polished gui ;) 
So for my plugins I only can imagine the common settings tree as something 
additional, an 'advanced' mode. Anyway, let's talk about it on the HF!

So do I. But you could use this library to create the settings, and it 
would automatically add them to the infrastructure. Then, fell free to 
set your own UI or not.

in qgis dev, i see that clicking "help" in Project-->Project properties
window it recalls a help popup that refers qgis 1.8 version.

don't you think it could be better eliminate it and fix the link to on-line
documentation?

Hi all,

I created a schedule based on the preferences from the doodle. [1]

I planned 2 sessions every morning (Fri, Sat and Sun) at 9 and 11 and 
some in the afternoons (so our special guest Larry can join)

It should be possible for most people to attend what they preferred.

We are still looking for people who could give a talk at the beginning 
of these sessions, so whoever feels like doing so, please raise your 
hand!

Feedback is welcome.

See you all soon
Matthias

PS: I did not add the sessions which where not present in the doodle, 
the responsible persons for these sessions, please find an appropriate 
time and add yourself to the schedule if you want to have the publicity 
:)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Suppress rendering of small features
Message-ID: <CAB28AshAosXuBFHH4DNVM8c1Bu1Cq=LcbZ22R+CgLbG9bqd7mA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been chatting with Nathan about adding a feature to QGIS which would
allow suppression of rendering features smaller than a set threshold for
vector layers. (There's already a similar function in the labelling engine
"Suppress labeling of features smaller than"). This feature would come in
handy for me for several tables which contain a wide range of very small ->
very large features, which cause slow rendering at small scales.

I'm just checking that if I code this up it's not going to be duplicated
effort - Nathan is under the impression that someone else has been talking
about adding something similar. Is there currently any plans for a feature
like this, or should I get started?

Not always is preferrable to suppress the small features.
Often in our rendering we prefere to substitute a small rendering of 
kind polygon with a point rendering at lowest scales.

This is possible using the Rule-Rendering
also is possible to use the rule-rendering to define a rule that in a 
scale interval and with a dimension interval the feature is render using 
a point rendering and change in a polygon rendering when the scale grow.

Hi,

As I understand, the feature to suppress small/large features would be
optional.

Another interesting thing would be to simplify features when you zoom
out. Maybe simplifying would be quicker than rendering thousands of
unnecessary vertices. Optionally this could also be "outsourced" to the
database - many databases support simplification on the db level. I
don't know if it would really speed up things. One would have to test.

"Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying
about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts
at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and
maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say
about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet
we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%."

Hi,

How would you define small? I guess something can already be done with 
scale based visibility, but that needs preprocessing of the data and 
assigning some kind of "size class".

I did a preliminary analysis for this.
I created a view on a postgis DB containing ~17000 line features with 
the geometry column simplified to 10m in the view.

*Non Simplified*
./output/bin/qgis_bench --iterations 20 --width 1024 --height 768 
bench-full.qgs
iterations: 20
total_avg: 0.4246
total_max: 0.657
total_maxdev: 0.2324
total_min: 0.407
total_stdev: 0.0535176606364665

*Simplified*
./output/bin/qgis_bench --iterations 20 --width 1024 --height 768 
bench-simplified.qgs
iterations: 20
total_avg: 0.09615
total_max: 0.098
total_maxdev: 0.00184999999999998
total_min: 0.095
total_stdev: 0.000792148975887722

0.42 / 0.09 is more than 400% performance improvement for this simple 
case.

The results of course depend heavily on the particular setting, but I 
think this looks indeed like a road we should have a look into.

(Setup: PostGIS 2.0.3 in a kvm virtual machine on the same physical 
machine. No styling at all took place on the layer)

Sometimes tile request fails and leave an hole in composer or canvas... in
this way they are scheduled again to a maximum maximum number of fails.
Code can be found in the my qgis fork. Sorry I forgot to create a branch
for this feature.
here:
https://github.com/luipir/Quantum-GIS/commit/a563f2a650b13db9a1d7d58983ac2a2f5b87f1bb
and here:
https://github.com/luipir/Quantum-GIS/commit/3e278110f298bdf9363a936dd296b75b84858e6c

2) WMS getLegendGraphic in QgsLegend and QgsComposer:
This is an incomplete feature I was working this days and I need help to
solve some technical problems related to pixmap visualization and
resolution in QgsLegend and QgsComposerLedend
These features have much more patch complexity and they need explication.
You can find preliminary code in the branches:
1) WMS Legend in: WMS_QgsLegend
2) WMS Composer legend in: WMS_QgsComposerLegend

Problems I encountered:
1) has the main problem to solve pixmap size in QTreeView without affecting
the other legends.
2) has the main problem in the Pixmap resolution
1) and 2) introduce a virtual method in QgsRasterData implemented in
QgsWmsDtaProvider... I don't like this solution but I didn't find other. I
would appreciate hints to do better.
1) and 2) in QgsLegend breack the Model-View pattern. I would ask a better
way to implement this features.

the name of the session could be:

WMS features: tiles and legends

thanks, Luigi Pirelli (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it)

Could this be done using a rule-based expression through the creation of a
variable that returns the pixel-size area of a polygon / pixel-size length
of a line?

Hi Matthias,

Thank you for your preliminary results. I think they are encouraging to
further look into this issue.

Hi Luigi,

Would you like to do this parallel to 3D or WebServer/WebClient (both 
on Saturday)
Of course anything else works as well. Just put your session onto the 
schedule.

Hi Mathias,

please also add a short session about python plugin repository website and
plugins installer, I've already put it in the wiki.

We have some small problems about versioning to discuss and solve.

Thanks!

While it is possible to set up rules to achieve a similar result, it's
quite a lot of work. It's also important to note that the feature I
propose would mean it's still possible to use graduated or categorized
renderers on a layer - again, the end result (scale/sized based
filtering together with categorized rendering) would be achievable by
creating a bunch of rules, but it would be a lot of work and the end
result would be much more rigid....

Yes - definitely optional and off by default!

I'm thinking of using the same method as the "Suppress labelling of
features smaller than" feature from the labelling engine. This gives
you a choice of feature size in mm to use as a threshold, and in my
experience works quite well.

I think it's important to note that hiding small features isn't just
about a performance win - it's also useful from a cartographic
perspective. My main use case involves a large water body dataset I
frequently use, which contains everything from large lakes and inlets
to very small dams and reservoirs. I need to have the large features
show up at all scales, but I don't want all these smaller features
cluttering up my map at small scales. This feature would mean I could
easily hide the little lakes from my map at small scales, but they'd
show up as I zoom in.
Sure, this could all be done by assigning a hierarchy to the features
and setting up a bunch of rules in a rule based renderer - but it
would be so much quicker and easier to just tick a box and tweak the
threshold size to suit.

Wasn't there a summer of code project with this goal a few years back?
Does anyone know what the outcome of that project was?

Message-ID: <201309121221.41180.vincent.ml@oslandia.com>

Hi all,

I know you are heading to Brighton for the codesprint, but it's not a reason 
not to think about future gathering of C/C++ OSGeo developers :-)

The annual "C-tribe" OSGeo codesprint will take place in Europe in 2014 !
I think it is the first time it is held outside of the American continent.

The meeting will take place in Vienna, March 24-28 2014. It will probably last 
the full week.

It is a really good opportunity for the QGIS developers to meet and work 
closely with other OSGeo projects developers, so as to better integrate our 
tools.

If you are interested to come, please add yourself to the list on the 
dedicated wiki page :

http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Vienna_Code_Sprint_2014#Participants

Stephan Mei?l is in charge of the organization, and you can subscribe to (and 
read the archives to know more) the mailing list : tosprint at lists.osgeo.org

The original message :
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/tosprint/2013-August/000454.html

The mailing list page : 
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/tosprint/

The codesprint is also looking for sponsors, so do not hesitate to give a hand 
and contact Stephan ( stephan at meissl.name )

I hope to see a lot of you there, leading OpenSource GIS stacks to new 
horizons :-)

Hi,

I raised similar question about year ago, but instead hiding small features
I propose to do simplification. I also implemented some test code and
results were pretty good ? redraw is quicker in several times. But my code
still hacky and not optimal.

Also there were GSoC project, but it was not completed. If you interested,
I can try to find code.

I've done this for mapnik and it worked pretty nicely:

Hi,

I did something somewhat similar to solve #4819 in Jully ("Identify Features"
tool is slow with complex/big features) and Matthias asked me to do the
same thing for the rubber-band.

In polygon contours, points that are less than a pixel apart from the
previous point are not drawn.

That improved (dramatically) the rendering speed.

Message-ID: <5231ACDD.3070808@carto.net>

Hi,

I noticed that basically all well-known small-scale projections for
world views are missing in QGIS, e.g. Robinson, Mollweide, Wagner,
Winkel, Eckert, etc

Can we add these for QGIS 2.1 or 2.0x?

For most of them the proj4 parameters are available. It is just a matter
of adding them.

We might even want to include a preview (in a web view widget, something
like in http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/3711245) - d3.js of course ...

+1. I was surprised to see they were missing, but then I don't do much at
those scales.

BTW, thank you very much for sharing that link. One of the best
illustrations on world projections I have ever seen. Would look beautiful
in a web view inside QGIS.

In fact, such a projection preview would be an excellent addition for the
CRS selection dialog, maybe as a preview of current data using the canvas,
layer or all-layers extent.

Larry

Hi Andreas,

I remember a friend of mine reporting that Winkel Tripel is not (or not 
properly) implemented in proj4. So we should carefully examine the proj4 
support of each of these.
apart from that +1

But i notice that the gdal version is still : 1.9.2

Could you throw light for me?

Thanks.

QGIS isn't developed with or for a specific GDAL version.  It will just use the
GDAL version in your particular environment (maybe you're using OSGeo4W 32bit -
which still has 1.9.2).

Hi all

I also think dynamic scale-dependent simplification would be very nice but
for me ONLY if we can preserve topology when simplifying. If not, it would
lead to very uggly results
cf http://strk.keybit.net/blog/  for example

+1 for optionnaly remove small feature though, this will be good too !

Hi,

We just discussed this and concluded, that the safest solution would be 
to only simplify for rendering and only when the resolution is small 
enough, that only points which will be painted on top of each other 
will be simplified away. (And then we should make some tests and see if 
it's actually worth it...)

Hi, 
I have been following Vincent's solution since I funded #4819 resolution.
Pruning all vertexes under screen resolution is really a nice idea. I wasn't
sure that pruning vertex was less cpu consuming than rendering them, and now
it's proved. just use a very large object, and do a identify on it to see.. 

I think that on the fly vertex pruning is a better definition than
simplification process, since the rendering must be the same when viewed on
screen or on a paper output. 

That bug #4819 occured to be a blocker to us in since new hydro-geological
datasets have a crazy vertex density , and anticipates even more precise
resolutions. All datasets will be derived from high resolution data, but we
always need to render them with small scales.  

I'm wondering if we could something close to raster resampling, with
zoom-out/zoom-in factor and resampling methods (nearest neighbour, bicubic,
average). User could choose the rendering fuzziness factor when zoomed out.
Zoom in is probably something user do not wish (this could lead to bad
interpretations.)

Another possible direction I'm thinking of, is having the possibility to
have scale dependent, or better rule based, geometry field. Ie, use full
geometry field when zoomed in, and let user calibrate if other geometry
fields could be used when zoomed out. This is far less generic and elegant
than vertex pruning, but could be usefull with spatialDB, and particular
datasets...

Let us know what strategic direction you choose, and we can be there to
support you then.

Have good times you all in Brighton. 

Cheers, 
R?gis

Hi all,

in the processing framework there is a tool that allows ot import in
PostGIS vector layers, and that now supports schemas and can be run in
batch mode.

Time to let SPIT go?

Message-ID: <CAFcNcQbYYeM4nn+T5GxfTBRs8H=z7TUBPWKpRKL_Y71JZvu8Sw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

I am building a plugin for Processing (former Sextante). Besides the
GeoAlgorithms,  I'd like to include some ready-made models along with the
plugin.

Is this feasible? How to do it?

I am currently using a 'models' subdir under my plugin's code with the
models.

It seems I should be able to register the models with processing's own
ModelerAlgorithmProvider, but I am missing something

# python code
alg = ModelerAlgorithm()
alg.openModel('path_to_model_file')
modeler_provider = Processing.modeler
modeler_provider.algs.append(alg)
Processing.updateProviders()

When running the above from the Python console I get no errors. But the
Processing Toolbox does not show my models.

What am I missing?

Is there another way to do this? Is including models in plugins a nice way
of distributing them? In this case it seems like a good thing, beacuse I
want to provide some examples on how the plugin can be used.

Best regards

Sorry for the noise, but this message's title should say 'how to distribute
Processing models' instead of modules...

Ricardo

There is a project going on now for creating a platform for sharing
resources. in QGIS. Models are clearly a good item to share in there.

I am lookng for example models to add to Processing so if you can send
them to me I can add them in the "[example models] category. They will
be useful for other people to study them and run them. I think this is
the best way of distributing them. If the number of example models is
high I might even classify them differently.

Thanks!

Victor

Haven't had to go back to SPIT for a long time now.

+1
unsure whether we should still keep dxf2shp, as dxf files *should* be
readable as normal vectors: anybody knows more about this?
All the best.

+1 from me

Just to let you know, bulk import can be done also through Processing
now, and I added Giovanni suggestion of adding the "schema"option to
the corresponding algorithm

Also, the OpenGeo explorer that I am working on has a nice
functionality of allowing multiple files to be imported by dragging
and dropping from the QGIS browser onto a PostGIS DB. I plan to add
that to the DB manager as well (now if you dop several files it will
open one import dialog for each of them...)

Hi Victor

In this case I don't think it is useful if you add the models to the
default install because they are all meant use this plugin's GeoAlgorithms
to do some composite analysis.

For this reason I'd like to bundle them together with the plugin.

I guess I can post them in the plugin's page and let users download them as
needed.

In the future I'd like to make them available in this new platform for
sharing QGIS related stuff.

Sounds reasonable?

Best regards

I would still keep dxf2shp. There is no real alternative to this
plugin so far.

+1 for a processing scripts and models repository similar to that of the
QGIS Plugins Repository.

Currently I simply have them available on GitHub

here is how our repo list stands now:

QGIS-Django
QGIS-Plugin-Repo
QGIS Plugins
QGIS-Documentation
QGIS-Website
QGIS-Web-Client
QGIS-Training-Manual
QGIS-Android
QGIS-Promotion

redmine_qgis_hub

Some of the afore mentioned repos have already been renamed, if you are
using one on the affected repos, simply edit your .git/config file and
update the remote spelling.

As you can see the last 3 are inconsistently named. Can I go ahead and do:

Quantum-GIS -> QGIS
osgeo-live-qgis-tutorials -> OSGEO-Live-QGIS-Tutorials
redmine_qgis_hub -> QGIS-Redmine-Hub


Any objections?

Hi all

Please note that the repository is renamed. To update your local repo to
the new name, simply run this command:

git remote set-url origin git at github.com:qgis/QGIS.git

Thanks

Tim,

I remember Sandro saying something about github having repo redirect so it
doesn't break everyone's local repos.

Might be worth looking into.

Hi

Yes to quote github [1]:

"We're happy to announce that starting today, we'll automatically redirect
all requests for previous repository locations to their new home in these
circumstances. There's nothing special you have to do. Just rename away and
we'll take care of the rest."

https://github.com/blog/1508-repository-redirects-are-here

So as far as I can see there is nothing to do...

Regards

Tim

I can confirm this bug, forwarding to the developer list. Temporary
workaround, is to press the pencil button and edit the -of part of the
command to the correct format as listed on http://gdal.org/formats_list.html

In this case it should say "-of AAIGrid"

Behavior in 1.8
Select Output, type test.asc (defaults to -of GTiff)
Select Output, Select ASC from the dropdown and type test.asc, results
in -of AAIGrid

Behavior in Master
Select Output, type test.asc (defaults to -of GTiff)
Select Output, Select ASC from the dropdown and type test.asc, results
in -of GTiff

PS: This to me highlights why we should always have the command output
at the bottom of tools (or in an advanced tab), where a user can
troubleshoot and modify a command that a dialog messes up on.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi all.
It looks easy to fix: would it be worth a 2.0.2 release?
All the best.

Hi List,

I've been asked by one of the organisers of the Maps and Metadata BOF if 
I could gather some people from the QGIS community to the Maps and 
Metadata BOF on friday [0]

I will probably go myself, but if you are around: please joint. If not 
email me questions or wisdom that you want me to share with them.

One of my question would be to define some standard way of defining 
layernames in the metadata of wms layers. In a way client apps can just 
view or preview that layer.

Any other ideas?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi All,

It seems a similar problem happens when while converting to idrisi format
too. While the .rst extension get written, the .rdc does not get created
and thus in the later stages it becomes difficult to work with idrisi
format of files. Is there a way to take care of this issue and do you think
this would be taken care of in the final version?


Regards

Partha

As far as I can tell, it affects all formats. You have to manually
change the -of parameter of gdal_translate in the bottom box. At this
point, no it will likely not be fixed in 2.0 as that's already gone to
packaging. GDAL_tools is a python plugin though, so I'm wondering if we
might just be able to push a fix via the python plugin manager and then
users will be able to pick up the update.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Richard?

maybe also ask about defining standard names for CSW entries for
WMS, WFS, downloadable data etc?

Hello Alex,

Thank you for suggestion. I tried the suggestion you had offered. It has
worked fine. May be we just need to work this way for the time being it
seems.

I certainly hope to be? there.

I (or my employer) have contracted Sourcepole to develop a CSW harvester of WxS services for QGIS, and have also funded improvements to Geonetwork to capture better metadata when harvesting from WxS url's. We desire a better integration of self documenting WxS services being harvested into CSW catalogues which provide a resource describing available layers/data which is directly accessible from QGIS. Sort of in line with the QGIS web client approach, but not quite :-)


I'll be discussing some of this in my presentation on NIWA's use of FOSS.

Cheers,

? Brent Wood

Just wondering what the procedure is to change the maintainer of a plugin in the QGIS plugin repository?  Any suggestions...

Thanks

too bad it has not been applied before: is this because of the quality 
of code, or just lack of time?

Hi all.
Here at FOSS4G, presenting QGIS 2.0 is going well. Unfortunately we are 
hitting once again the problem with saga not being found by Processing. 
This is on Windows: could it be a packaging problem? Of course we cannot 
do much testing here: does anybody confirm?

Hi,

I just noticed that on qgis 2.0 standalone installers grass does not
work in the processing framework, as it says that grass installatoin
is not found. I tried to see if it was a paces problem in the
installation path installing qgis in a custom folder but at no avail.

The fix for that problem was introduced just after the release branch
was made, but I think the package should contain the fix (that's what
was mentioned on IRC when I told about adding that last minute
change)....but not sure it does. Can you find the git commit it
correspond to, so I can check it? For the Processing workshop, the
latest version of the plugin could be installed separately, but that
might be too much hassle...

Are you aware that the 64bit has SAGA 2.1.0 while 32bit has SAGA 2.0.x?
Might that be related?

agreed. would it be possible to have new packages then? this might also 
allow to fix the raster conversion issue.

good remark.

Paolo, if that's the case, just make sure you have the correct
compatibility enabled (you should see the expected version in the
toolbox entry)

Hi Paolo,

I have this problem when I run QGIS with an account without administrative privileges. If I run QGIS "as administrator", it works. 

This is very strange, I've uninstalled everything and went back to install, and the same happens, both with OSGeo4W QGIS master and QGIS 2.0.1 standalone.

I think that in Windows only saga 2.1 should be packaged, since there
is no point on using 2.0.8, and have 2.1 compatibility as the default
option

Hi all.
During the FOSS4G workshop, we noticed that on fresh installs, cpt-city 
seems unable to display the list of colour ramps: is this a real issue 
(coding or packaging)?
Thanks.

yes it happens to me too.
first i have updated the cpt version to 2.09 but the problem was still
there.
it seems that firstly the path of installation directory has not been
written in dialogue window.

now it works...

While we are at it, is it possible to update the content. It looks completely out of date in terms of Plugin descriptions at least!
I tried to do so, but no permission I suppose.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] storing and reading WKT geom in non spatial
	Datasource
Message-ID: <1379431012865-5078296.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
a good question has been raised on Stackexchange [0]

"How do I import WKT text data back into QGIS, and how useful could Base or
Access be in storing the data using WKT rather than spatially enabling it
within a proper GIS database, like Spatialite?"

The good point beyond that, is that adding a WKT field to a database is
often more simple than converting it to spatial DB, since a complete
workflow often exists (forms to create datas, macros.. ). For simple
mapping, without special performance required (no metadata, no spatial
index, no spatial function embeded), that would save me lots of days.  More
precisely, I often have to downgrade to basic shp exports just to map simple
things, when reading directly the datasource could keep it all dynamic.
Thoughts? 
R?gis

I have access/know how to edit the menu's on osgeo.org. I can also grant
permissions to other osgeo users to edit content. Normally these
requests are handled via trac.osgeo.org/osgeo tickets tagged for the Sys
Admin Committee (SAC).

As for the landing page there are a couple of choices:
1. You can edit and maintain the in place page.
2. We can point it to http://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/qgis_overview.html

3. The link can go to qgis.org, though I can't recall if the
Marketing/Outreach committee and Board preferred the above 2 options
over this one.

Thanks,
Alex

I vote for #3: quite unlikely we'll remember to keep these info synced 
with the main ones.

Saber I just wanted to thank you and Claudia so much for your hospitality.
I know it must have been a hectic few weeks for you organising the hackfest
and very busy having your home invaded by people. You really did a great
job organising everything and the whole event went very smoothly so well
done!

Also a great thanks to Pete for all the organising work you did and a very
special thanks to Siobhain for slaving away in the background keeping us
all fed and ferrying people around - you guys all rock!

Regards

Tim

I use it often with SQLite and an OGR Virtual format file:

<OGRVRTDataSource>
    <OGRVRTLayer name="test">
        <SrcDataSource>path/testwkt.sqlite</SrcDataSource> 
        <SrcLayer>geom</SrcLayer> 
        <GeometryType>wkbPolygon</GeometryType>
            <LayerSRS>EPSG:31370</LayerSRS>
        <GeometryField encoding="WKT" field="geom"/> 
    </OGRVRTLayer>	
</OGRVRTDataSource>

So, this should be possible with an ODBC connection (Microsoft Access or
Base)

Yes VRT is a good point, 
but it behaves like another datasource, so geomatic guys will know it, but
common user won't. 
I think having a transparent provider, detecting, reading and writing WKT
could not be a solution. 

Real life example: 

 - an external enterprise has developped a whole Access DB + VBA macors +
forms for my administration. They come to see my at the end of the project,
"we would like to map querys results, but we would like to change the data
on the fly with the macros... and regenerate the maps.. ". 
      Mapinfo answer... "possible but dangerous, and we're dropping MI, just
forget"
      QGIS answer.. "ouch... export all in shp, ah no, your field names will
be truncated, use excel.. ah, clean it up well, no encoding nowhere, .xls
2003, then import, join to your layer, export again in shp (1.8
limitations)... and... CSV could be nice in fact.. NO, access can't export
correctly carriage returns, damn! , so ODBC .. Oh non, my sys admin have cut
it off for security reasons, $^*??!! ".. So I say, "Why didn't you come at
start, we would have been working in spatialite environnement..." and no map
If I'm not free for the work. BAD.
     I dream I could answer: "OK, let's add just a new attribute layer with
WKT field, and makes queries, the open those table in QGIS, check "detect
spatial WKT column", and I have very slow but dynamic maps. 
I Know spatial index in extremely important, but that would always be better
than actual workflow.

On a technical point of view, maybe we could lay on VRT GDAL format.. but my
concern is to let common user have a simple and clear tool, with no XML
input needed. 
Thoughts?

could be a solution. 

Real life example: 

 - an external enterprise has developped a whole Access DB + VBA macors +
forms for my administration. They come to see my at the end of the project,
"we would like to map querys results, but we would like to change the data
on the fly with the macros... and regenerate the maps.. ". 
      > Mapinfo answer... "possible but dangerous, and we're dropping MI,
just forget"
      > QGIS answer.. "ouch... export all in shp, ah no, your field names
will be truncated, use excel.. ah, clean it up well, no encoding nowhere,
.xls 2003, then import, join to your layer, export again in shp (1.8
limitations)... and... CSV could be nice in fact.. NO, access can't export
correctly carriage returns, damn! , so ODBC .. Oh no, my sys admin have cut
it off for security reasons, $^*??!! ".. So I say, "Why didn't you come at
start, we would have been working in spatialite environnement..." and no map
If I'm not free for the work or a good old FME day..  BAD.
     I dream I could answer: "OK, let's add just a new attribute layer with
WKT field, and makes queries, the open those table in QGIS, check "detect
spatial WKT column", and I have very slow but dynamic maps. 
I Know spatial index in extremely important, but that would always be better
than actual workflow.

On a technical point of view, maybe we could lay on VRT GDAL format.. but my
concern is to let common user have a simple and clear tool, with no XML
input needed. 
Thoughts?

About Spatial indexes, why not creating them on the fly in memory? 
The more I think of it, the more I like the idea. Am I alone?

Hello,

Compliments for qgis 2.0 release.

I would like load postgis raster data with qgis. But i can't find the
usefull extension. Before with qgis 1.8 there was an extension called gdal
postgis raster loader.

Could you throw light for me.

Regards.

Laurent Celati.

> About Spatial indexes, why not creating them on the fly in memory?

If you have large dynamic tables you could instead have a datamodel where min_x, min_y, max_x & max_y indexed columns are added along side the WKT/WKB in the table. Then the QGIS provider could do bbox queries to quickly return the rows within view. Does however have requirement that the application updates these bbox columns.

Question: if you can't use ODBC because of security problems (?) then how are you going to read the MS Access data into QGIS?

BTW: QGIS 2.0 has much improved CSV reading support via Text Delimiter reader, including better handling of CR/LF and quotes. Also supports WKT very well and has indexing options. The workflow of MS Access -> query -> export to csv -> QGIS via Add Text Delimited File could still be manageable for users...

Hi Tim,

 

I have to say it was the others (including Kamran) who deserve the credit as
I took a very back-seat role.  I think we're all very proud to help
facilitate the first QGIS HF in the UK.  

 

With his new footing in events organising I'm sure Saber is considering a
career as a wedding planner :>

 

 

Kind regards,

 

Pete

Hi Saber and Claudia, Peter and Siobhain

 

Saber I just wanted to thank you and Claudia so much for your hospitality. I
know it must have been a hectic few weeks for you organising the hackfest
and very busy having your home invaded by people. You really did a great job
organising everything and the whole event went very smoothly so well done!

 

Also a great thanks to Pete for all the organising work you did and a very
special thanks to Siobhain for slaving away in the background keeping us all
fed and ferrying people around - you guys all rock!

First, I will try to convince my sys admin ;-), and second, I will keep on
looking if funding direct gdal access / xlsx is expensive. That would be
nicer, since declaring a odbc connection is not very.. user friendly.

I'm aware of csv improvements, in fact, I asked a lot to Chris Crook.. But I
realize this is still deconnected to source data.

Hi

My apologies, I meant to include Kamran in my original message. Kamran was
a huge help to hackfest, and an extremely likeable and cheerful fellow who
played a huge part in my personal enjoyment of the event and I am sure to
the experience of others too. Thanks Kamran!

Regards

Tim

Hi All

On Friday I will be filling in for Nathan to give a keynote speech about
QGIS here at FOSS4G2013. I would love to show a map of contributors around
the world. If you have ever contributed a patch, written documentation,
 have commit rights or have otherwise been a part of forming the QGIS
software project we all know and love, please consider adding yourself to
our map. I have made a simple json document (attached link below [1]).
Please note you do not need to add your precise address, even to the
nearest country is ok. Please test your changes by pasting the resulting
updated json document here[1] into the json  tab to see that you didnt
break it.

Thanks in advance everyone!

Hi!

I agree with all others .. It has been a great hackfest. Thanks a lot
for organizing it and a special thanks for hosting me in your living
room.
It's been interesting and also great fun talking to you.

Hope to see you soon (on the next hackfest?)

Message-ID: <20130919131132.7b331697@gbd1.fritz.box>

Hello all,

I'm looking for someone who works with raster files in QGIS.
For documentational purposes we'd like to know how the band rendering
in the Layer Properties works.
Does QGIS always create a palette for any kind of raster file?
Or does QGIS depending on the file format use either Multiband color
or Paletted or Singleband grey?
Does the user have to switch to Singleband pseudocolor manually, because
there is no automatic use of Singleband pseudocolor?

Any hints welcome.

Kind regards,
Larissa

Please everybody check your first commit date. By setting JEF's first 
contribution to 2013 we seriously mess the Earth history :) Gino's date looks 
suspicious too. I haven't check others.

I can change to Unknow... that date was related to my repo. I presented
code in Brighton but I can't do pull request until some burocratic problems
are resolved.

But it's ok leaving with unknow (as pcav)... but I prefer to "stay" in this
list because my last tree month of work in the communtiy.... it it's not a
problem, obviously.

thanks, Luigi Pirelli (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it)

It is simple, considering number of bands, DataType and
ColorInterpretation we decide LayerType,  for LayerType we set
DrawingStyle and each DrawingStyle has assigned default renderer.
Shortly:

multi band => MultiBandColor

single band and color interpratation PaletteIndex => PalettedColor

single band and color interpratation ContinuousPalette => ContinuousPalette

single band and data type ARGB32 => SingleBandColorDataStyle

all others => SingleBandGray

Could we use a csv format? Writing json is a pain. Also csv is easier to
fix when broken.

Best wishes.

I fixed the parsing by the way - dont worry if you break it, I will fix it
again. Or just paste the snippet like Brent has done.

I just see some commits from early July. I'm too lazy to investigate whether 
they went to QGIS repo or another repos, so I just mentioned the August 22 is 
"suspicious". Just to attract your attention. I also don't remember if you did 
some commits past years or not. It's all :-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] new bug in spatialite data provider?
Message-ID: <CAJg9Up54YKwt4K9oe4Qfna+KG8_KFy-LZHqrEQUrTysbo-G0qw@mail.gmail.com>

I recently tested version 2.0 and found that I can not add features to a
spatialite layer where the primary key is defined by two fields: text and
integer. Error message:

"Errors: ERROR: 1 feature(s) not added.

Provider errors:

SQLite error: t2.col_2 may not be NULL

SQL: INSERT INTO "t2"("col_1","col_2") VALUES (?,?)"


In addition, in QGIS-master (version 2.1) there is also a problem to add
features to a spatialite layer where the primary key is text (only one
field).

I have been using 1.9.90 for several months and not had these problems
before, at least not after bug #4569 was fixed [1]. A sample project and
data base may be downloaded from here [2] for testing, just start editing
the layers and try to add some features. Updating layer t2 fails in version
2.0 while there is problems with both layer t1 and t2 in version 2.1.

Could someone please verify before I send a bug report? (I am using Ubuntu
12.04, qgis built from source with spatialite 4.1.1)

regards
Josef

Yes that would be a good idea though obviously we have no way to enforce
that.

I have tried both local install and install from ubuntugis-unstable (2.0.1
in Linux Mint 15-raring) and the color ramps seem ok.

Perhaps the problem is that no ramps appear, until you click on one of the
categories?

Can someone confirm that this is the issue (not that ramps are not
available).

regards,
Etienne

we spotted this on Windows machines. UNfortuynately this was during a

Hi all.
I am told grass support is broken on the above platform: as it seems a 
packaging problem, could this be solved soon, before too many broken 
packages are around? Victor, are you aware of the problem?
Thanks.

Message-ID: <1379663577522-5078810.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
When trying to install statist plugin, I have a Error "could not find the
matplotlib module". 

very similar problem was found in MacOsX [0], and on my OSG4W install, 64
bit. 32 bit install is fine. 
I compared 32 bits and 64
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27\Lib\site-packages\matplotlib directories. 
64 bit is missing some files (55), including pyparsing stuff. 

Should I raise a Osgeo4w ticket? 
R?gis

Hi, 
I reinstalled OSGEO4W 64 bits, and found that pyparsing was not installed.
Installing it solved the problem. 
Anyway, I did the same with OSGEO4W 32 bit setup, and pyparsing is not
appearing in lib's list.. but is installed. 
Is my package manager corrupted or could this be a bug?

I have reported this issue several days ago: in the standalone
packages grass/processing does not work, it does work on osgeo4w.

it (should) work on osgeo4w, it does not on the standalone installers
(see the other message about the same issue with grass).

you need to add a PPA with saga 2.10.

mmm.. I work with Ubuntu (13.04), but if I add the repository for the 
2.1 version of saga, there is a conflict between gdal libraries.
So it seems that it's not possible to install saga and the new qgis 
version at the same time (without compiling)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Fwd: Q-Rap plugin
Message-ID: <523C3161020000560002DB18@gwise.up.ac.za>

Hi,

I am currently th only active developer on Q-Rap, a Radio Planning plugin for QGis (source code at http://sourceforge.net/projects/qrap/). I recently updated it to work with Qgis version 2 (the upgrade on the Ubuntu repositories catch me a bit surprised as the Web-site still only talks about version 1.80). 

None the less, my main problem is that I am having trouble to have Q-Rap "stick": 
It loads successfully, however when I close Q-Gis down and open it up again the tool bar is not there.<BR>Q-Rap is still selected, but it would seem like the constructor and initGui is not run again when I open up QGis. so now I have to un select the Q-Rap plugin and selects it again ... and then it loads.
I had another look at the plugin-template and some other plugin implementations in the source code, but I <BR>really don't get it. Q-Rap creates its own new ToolBar on the QGis-interface.
(I had this problem in 1.8 as well ... in version 1.7 it worked fine)

Is this a bug in QGis or am I blind to what I am doing wrong?

On another topic;
On the Q-Rap mailing list I got the following message for Giovanni:

">> http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html ( http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html )
> ( http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html ) I doubt anyway that you will be able to make qrap works with the

> QGIS C++ plugins should be added upstream and maintained updated
> there, otherwise they are going the become quickly obsolete and of
> course stop to work
>
>> cheers>> -- Giovanni --"

I also got a similar suggestion from Paolo Cavallini of the LinkedIn QuantumGIS group that I should be doing the same. The fact of the matter is that I would really like to do just that.

How does one go about it? Is there any-one that can help me with this? As I am currently the only active developer and should actually be spending my time on research and teaching.
(I have not yet try to compile it under windows.)

Kind Regards
Magdaleen Ballot.

Hi all.
Apparently this kind of problems are rather common - why not adding a 
"Troubleshooting" section to the Download page?
All the best.

-------- Original Message --------
I downloaded and
installed the 64 bit version as i'm on a sony vio running on windows 64
- and get the following error when I try to run it. Once I hit ok it
opens but then crashed when I tried to install a plugin.

Message-ID: <CALCNqkZ32ZhkNFcfzaReesJkBgXKCEitwXOdLEvZRO1j41f_iA@mail.gmail.com>

Can someone (Paolo?) update the sponsors list? It seems out of date - It
look slike e.g. geosynergy is expired and perhaps others need adding. We
have two places where sponsors are listed:

QGIS-Website/source/site/getinvolved/governance/sponsorship/sponsor-list.rst

and

QGIS-Website/source/site/about/sponsorship.rst

Tim

This looks like a manifest issue. If you compile with MSVC2005/MSVC2008 the
CRT manifest file should probably be embedded as a resource in the
executables / dlls.

We are announcing the release of 2.0 shortly - first we have been pushing

Someone would need to build it and check it in order to be able to tell you

Great that you plan to update your plugin to 2.0. I don't think the QRAP
plugin is a good candidate for inclusion of the QGIS upstream project
directly as its scope is limited to a very niche group of users. Also
anything going into core should have a dedicated maintainer, so it should
not be seen as a vehicle to offload the maintainance to other developers.
It would be better to make an appeal here on the list (and perhaps the
users list) for other developers to join you on the project.

In terms of hosting, we can certainly look at hosting QGIS in the github
QGIS repository (or you could upload it to your own repo and make it public
for others to fork).

Tim

Do we have the videos online somewhere already?

Thank you.
 
Q-Rap seems to work now with QGis version 2
 
And the web-site is updated ;-)

Hi

On Fri, Sep 20, 2013 at 11:28 AM, Magdaleen Ballot <Magdaleen.Ballot at up.ac.za> wrote:


Hi,

I am currently th only active developer on Q-Rap, a Radio Planning plugin for QGis (source code at http://sourceforge.net/projects/qrap/). I recently updated it to work with Qgis version 2 (the upgrade on the Ubuntu repositories catch me a bit surprised as the Web-site still only talks about version 1.80). 



We are announcing the release of 2.0 shortly - first we have been pushing packages out to the repositories.


None the less, my main problem is that I am having trouble to have Q-Rap "stick": 
It loads successfully, however when I close Q-Gis down and open it up again the tool bar is not there.<BR>Q-Rap is still selected, but it would seem like the constructor and initGui is not run again when I open up QGis. so now I have to un select the Q-Rap plugin and selects it again ... and then it loads.
I had another look at the plugin-template and some other plugin implementations in the source code, but I <BR>really don't get it. Q-Rap creates its own new ToolBar on the QGis-interface.
(I had this problem in 1.8 as well ... in version 1.7 it worked fine)

Is this a bug in QGis or am I blind to what I am doing wrong?



Someone would need to build it and check it in order to be able to tell you that.


On another topic;
On the Q-Rap mailing list I got the following message for Giovanni:

">> http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html
> ( http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html%3E%3E ) I doubt anyway that you will be able to make qrap works with the

> QGIS C++ plugins should be added upstream and maintained updated
> there, otherwise they are going the become quickly obsolete and of
> course stop to work
>
>> cheers>> -- Giovanni --"

I also got a similar suggestion from Paolo Cavallini of the LinkedIn QuantumGIS group that I should be doing the same. The fact of the matter is that I would really like to do just that.



How does one go about it? Is there any-one that can help me with this? As I am currently the only active developer and should actually be spending my time on research and teaching.
(I have not yet try to compile it under windows.)



Great that you plan to update your plugin to 2.0. I don't think the QRAP plugin is a good candidate for inclusion of the QGIS upstream project directly as its scope is limited to a very niche group of users. Also anything going into core should have a dedicated maintainer, so it should not be seen as a vehicle to offload the maintainance to other developers. It would be better to make an appeal here on the list (and perhaps the users list) for other developers to join you on the project.

In terms of hosting, we can certainly look at hosting QGIS in the github QGIS repository (or you could upload it to your own repo and make it public for others to fork).


Regards

Tim



Kind Regards
Magdaleen Ballot.

I discovered the psycopg2 requirement, and I should have bundled it in QGIS, but it looks like I missed it.  I'll do that next time.

The Interrupted system call error seems to be a one-time Python error when running on Mt Lion.  I got it once but have not seen it again.

I would also like you all very much for the organisation of this great event. I enjoyed it very much. Especially the lunch in the end was amazing.

Do we have the videos online somewhere already?

Hope to see you again.

Great work. But can someone fix the broken Umlaute in the German version 
of the new homepage?

I'm not sure if this should be reported to hub.qgis.org as well.

Is that 2.0.1 that you were using in those win machines. The
standalone installer was working perfectly here in 10 computer with
win 7... Hopefully we will be able to prepare a new version of
Processing, to release it independently quite soon. I hope the problem
i there and easy to fix, but it might be in the SAGA installation, so
it might require a new QGIS version :-(

Hey all,

Anyone know why the build includes this plugin still.  It's not even in the
source tree anymore but when you install 2.0 you get it.  This also causes
a crash.

I already opened a ticket for that:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8635

Besides, I wonder why (on OSGEO4W) mapserver_export, osm and 
plugin_installer are pre-installed, but not valid for QGIS 2.

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg9WRedU3w0CmjV3JS-RQocDxmUSQ9aU5q7a79=KpQmtDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

It seems that the Windows 2.0 standalone installer is packaged wrong.  It
seems to include outdated and removed plugins.  plugin_installer,
osm_export, mapserver_export.  None of these work with 2.0 and have been
removed from the source not sure why they are showing up in in the final
build, or even how.

Can someone please look into this as having all these broken windows builds
going out isn't very good.

I have just found out that it does not contain SAGA... I think it was
supposed to be included so it could be called from Processing... Can
anyone confirm this?

Jurgen has just fixed this in the osgeo4w scripts in both master and
release_2_0 branches - thanks.

I have also commited to master a fix to show all ramps by default when
opening cpt-city dialog, instead of an empty screen.

cheers

Thanks for confirming, and thanks Juergen for fixing - one more reason 
to release 2.0.2, I see.
All the best.

This is also my interpretation. I think providing saga in the 
standalone package is the only realistic way of having people fully 
using Processing.

It's not only the standalone version affected, the OSGEO4W version as well.

Just tried here with a fresh 64bit installer for win. It works fine
and it autodetect the path to GRASS in
"C:/PROGRA~1/QGISDU~1/apps\grass\grass-6.4.3"

Question for Giovanni: maybe it might be that in your system it has
something like "c:/Program files/..." (including white spaces)?. That
should explain the issue.

Can you check in the setttings/providers/grass, the value of the grass
folder parameter, and tell me what it looks like?

Let's see if we can fix this quickly

Thanks!

Added the dependency in OSGeo4W (which means it will also appear automatically
in the next standalone).

Hi Victor,

The OTB and Grass plugins are not working in Windows 7 and Mac OS X.
Previously in QGIS 1.9.0, the Unsupervised KMeans image classification
in OTB, was working, however, GRASS is not working as well. I am
trying to use raster.reclass in GRASS.

In OTB, the problem is output.tiff and in the GRASS the input raster
is not found.

How do we fix these problem.

Anybody using OTB and GRASS in Linux (Ubuntu)? Does OTB and GRASS
works in QGIS 2.0.1?

Thanks.

Regards, Noli

No surprising.  The standalne installer is based on OSGEO4W.

I have run a set of tests on Windows, and here following my notes. It
seems to me that there are not only issue with the processing
framework, but also with the installers itselfs.


I used using a *clean* Windows 7 machine and after testing each
installer I carefully cleaned any trace of qgis by removing registry
keys, installation leftovers anthe .qgis2 folder and cleaning again
with ccleaner.




*) standolone installer 32bit: both grass and saga are not found by
processing regardless the installation path (with spaces or no spaces,
I tested also install in c:\qgis).

When trying to open a GRASS module the error is (in the qgis log)

OGR[3] error 4: Unable to open
C:/PROGRA~1/QGISDU~1/apps/qgis/./python/plugins\processing\tests\data\points.shp
or C:/PROGRA~1/QGISDU~1/apps/qgis/./python/plugins\processing\tests\data\points.SHP.



I noticed also that:

this installer install the software in "program file" and not in
"program files(x86)" as expected for a 32bit program in a 64bit
Windows.


When configuring processing the qgis log shows this

"edit: editing failed"

I tried to manually set/escape the GRASS paths in processing at no avail.





*) standalone installer 64bit: saga is not found by processing. GRASS
is found, modules run but at the end they return errors.

The error (in the qgis log) is

OGR[3] error 4: Unable to open
C:/PROGRA~1/QGISDU~1/apps/qgis/./python/plugins\processing\tests\data\points.shp
or C:/PROGRA~1/QGISDU~1/apps/qgis/./python/plugins\processing\tests\data\points.SHP.

and this "points.shp" has nothing to do with the module being run.


Please note that the same GRASS modules with the same inputs works ok
with qgis installed with osgeo4w (see below).


QGIS installed with this installer now gives an error when launching.
See this image

https://www.dropbox.com/s/h0pitcgcxpzg3mb/Capture.JPG


It does NOT give the "edit: editing failed" error when configuring processing.





*) osgeo4w 64bit installer:

on start qgis gives the same error given by the 64 bit standalone
installer (see above).

Saga works. GRASS modules run but they return an error (see above).

I noticed also that this osgeo4w installer does not automatically
selects the dependencies and that it is not possible to install from a
local folder as it enters in a loop and does not allow to see the last
dialog, the one with the install/finish button.



*) osgeo4w installer:

I see the

"edit: editing failed"

message when configuring processing, but overall it seems that
everything is ok, saga and grass do run as expected.grass modules are
running and returning results (with the same modules and inputs, the
standalone installers and the osgeo4w64 don't).





*) osgeo4w 32bit experimental installer


same as osgeo4w installer.

Hi tried to install qgis also in a path with no spaces, but the result
is the same. I tries also to escape the path with spaces with "", and
again no joy.

Se also my previous e-mail for details.

That is a layer that is used to run a test, to check that GRASS and
SAGA are installed. Maybe when the data is in a path with blank spaces
(as this case, since that data is in the Processing folder), GRASS
doesn't like it?

I had a closer look at the problem with GRASS and the 64 bit installer
(which I guess ight be the same in other installers that do not work
correctly). It passes the test fine (the test that uses the points.shp
file), so it lets you get to the dialog. Vector operations (like the
test one) work fine, but rasters do not. Processing calls GRASS
correctly and detects the path without problems, but then GRASS
complains that "It was not possible to load GDAL library".

Giovanni, your problems are with raster layers as well, i guess, since
you can open the dialogs (meaning that vector modules run fine)

Is this a packaging problem? I have no idea about how to fix this...
Any GRASS (or packaging) expert can tell us why GRASS cannot load GDAL

Thanks!

where can we see the actual, updated map? The source is in the master tree,
but I have not seen in in the QGIS about dialogs.

I tested again installing qgis standalone 64 bit in c:\qgis, the path
to data does not have spaces and the result is the same. I tested
raster and vector modules, and the very same operations with the same
outputs o work in qgis 2.0 installed with osgeo4w (32 bit).

I confirm that with rasters the message

"It was not possible to load GDAL library"

shows in the log.


On the other hand vector operations do not always run ok. For example
I can't get a dissolve done, and the same operation with the same
input is ok in qgis installed with osgeo4w.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python renderer problem with 2.0.1 in OSGEO
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E1309C497E9@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All

I'm having problems with getting a python plugin (Vector Field Renderer) running on 2.0.1 in the standalone windows version (installed onto windows 7).

The plugin implements a custom vector layer renderer to draw arrows based on object attributes.  It is used by selecting the renderer in the vector properties style tab.  It then should display the configuration widget.  This all works fine on Ubuntu 12.04, but under windows it just comes up with the message "This renderer does not implement a graphical user interface", or words to that effect.

I'm looking for ideas on how to debug this.  I've tried creating the configuration widget from the python console, and it appears to do this successfully (I did have to make relative module imports explicit to do this - ie change from

from VectorFieldRenderer import VectorFieldRenderer

to

from .VectorFieldRenderer import VectorFieldRenderer

But once I'd done that I could create the widget in the console. However it still isn't appearing in the layer properties dialog.

I can't see any significant version differences between the libraries on windows and ubuntu installations - only differences are in minor versions where windows is ahead of my ubuntu installation.

So I'm looking for any insights as to what could be different and why this might not be working ...

Thanks
Chris

also the "Add Delimited Text" tool still shows in the plugins (with
the old icon) and when activated crashes qgis.

See

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8635


Considering also the issues with processing in the standalone
installers, and the error message that shows in 64 bit installers

https://www.dropbox.com/s/h0pitcgcxpzg3mb/Capture.JPG


I really hope there is room for new updated installers.

Denis,

I like the idea of having a dictionnary for the values a settings can have.

Do you think that my work on a tree view for all settings [1] can be merged
with yours into core c++?

There could be 2 ways to open a settings dialog, one for all settings like
I have done, and one for just a particular plugin (by limiting which
settings are shown in the tree).

[1] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/878

cheers
Etienne

and found another issue that affects only the standalone installer

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ogrinfo can rename shapefiles columns
Message-ID: <CACfnYnRN-s7oo6An5LBUOQSRTNkRqG-uVgc4JYrTzDycxphQ-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was somehow surprised that ogrinfo can rename shapefiles columns, ex:

ogrinfo shapename.shp -sql "ALTER TABLE shapename RENAME COLUMN foo TO bar"

As this functionality is a "must" for common users, it would be
possible to use ogrinfo from within qgis to allow do this operation?
What would be the best place where to implement such tool?


cheers

The table manager plugin already does this. Just learned about it this
week. Works really well. I see how eventually it might be nice to wrap
it so when in edit mode you can drag and drop columns into a different
order. Perhaps an enhancement ticket.

Thanks,
Alex

If you go here
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/contributors.json you will see
it on a map. I used the map in the keynote speech at foss4g2013. In future
versions of QGIS, sure we could include it somewhere in a dialog of you
thought that would be a useful thing to do.

Hi all,

Here are the videos from the HF on Ustream:
http://www.ustream.tv/channel/qgis-hackfest

The slides are not visible, worth uploading them somewhere and link them
in the comment sections.

Cheers,
Saber

I would also like you all very much for the organisation of this great event. I enjoyed it very much. Especially the lunch in the end was amazing.

Do we have the videos online somewhere already?

Hope to see you again.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] More packaging issues. Turning off Processing
	simplified mode
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zEWjJ=-68FX2NF2o5oxe4SJ-1Pr7FT2rZNbvVT_tpsVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have tried to install 2.0.1 from OSGeo4W and I have seen that it
doesn't have GRASS, SAGA or OTB as dependencies. I guess this lack of
dependencies propagates to the standalone installer (although it
installs GRASS, AFAICT)

Don't know if this is a packaging issue or is intentional, but
Processing assumes that at least SAGA and OTB are installed, and the
idea was to give less advanced users soething that works out of the
box, without having to install anything else (at least in the windows
version).

Since this might not be true (I don't know if there was some
misunderstanding when we discussed this), I am going to turn off the
"Simplified interface", which hides the complexity of the algorithm
providers. I prefer to have something that actually looks more
complex, than something that looks simple, but then it is not working
if you do not do some more advanced configuration and installing.

Do you think this is a good idea? I am seeing that most users
complaining about Processing do it because of installation problems
(lack of 3rd party apps in this case), and I prefer to target more
advanced users that can solve those problems themselves, than target
basic users when we cannot provide a one-step installation and they
are going to find a malfunctioning plugin.

cheers
Victor

For me (back in NL) both qgis.org and the plugin repo are not available...

Though my url "qgis.org" is replaced by "www.qgis.org/en/site/" in my

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to use intersects and difference using API c++?
Message-ID: <DB24807D00689D48B45B012CCABDF1E744045A@mx.edisoft.pt>

Hi,

 

I am using the code below to test for geometry intersection and in case
of success remove the intersection part from another geometry, but it is
not working.

 

The polygonCoverageAreasLayer is a memory polygon layer, and feature is
circle built using rubberBand and the final result is still a circle and
not the difference with my base map costalLineLayer.

 

                           polygonCoverageAreasLayer->startEditing();

                           attrListCL =
costalLineLayer->dataProvider()->attributeIndexes();

 
costalLineLayer->dataProvider()->select(attrListCL);

 
while(costalLineLayer->dataProvider()->nextFeature(featureCL))

                           {

                                  if
(feature.geometry()->intersects(featureCL.geometry()))

                                  {

                                        QgsGeometry *geom =
feature.geometry()->difference(featureCL.geometry());

                                        feature.setGeometry(geom);
//applying new geometry

 
polygonCoverageAreasLayer->updateFeature(feature);


                                  }

                           }

                           polygonCoverageAreasLayer->commitChanges();

 

 

Any clue, for what I am doing wrong?

 

Thanks

Hi,

Currently we have another website which looks like a second "main"
QGIS website. I think we should take it down fast to avoid confusion

http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/html/en/

Who can do that?

That is the (old) documentation website. We also have:

http://docs.qgis.org/1.8/html/en/index.html

They both have to be taken down and changed to use the same layout and 
toolchain of the QGIS-Website project. But at least the 1.8 version 
should be kept up.

Finally I think we should keep building the documenation versions:

1.8 (standalone)
     http://docs.qgis.org/1.8/en
2.0 (pointing to docs in Website:
     http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/
     http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/* should be pointed to that also
master (standalone)
     http://docs.qgis.org/master/en (only english)

Richard

Just got a phone from G.A.I.A. mbH, which are silver sponsors since 6.2013.
Seems like we lost them with the Website translation.

Hi Pirmin,

there is already an issue for the sponsorship pages problems:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/issues/70

I added a not to that one (Paolo is going to fix this).

The page you show from google webcache will be up on old.qgis.org 
(within a couple of minutes):

http://www.qgis.org/en/sponsorship/sponsors.html

Subject: [Qgis-developer] installation directory of qgis dev
Message-ID: <1379938922732-5079246.post@n6.nabble.com>

i see that the installation directory of development version of qgis 2.0 is
still, so for example i still see the sextante plugin link in the plugin
manager window as Installed version: 1.1 (in
C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-dev\.\python\plugins\sextante).

is it possible to define a new path or can you tell me how can remove all
traces of qgis 1.8 dev?

than you

Hi,

How do I compile OTB-3.18.1 in Mac OS X?

Any Mac OS X binary that works with the OTB QGIS 2.0.1 Plugin?

I think we still need the OTB binary for OTB plugin in QGIS 2.0.1.

Thanks,

Noli

Hi Noli,

The homebrew package manager has an orfeo formula. I just installed it, and it seems to work for me, although I'm not a user of OTB so I didn't do much testing. It is currently version 3.18.0, but I'm not sure if that matters or not.

Cheers,
John

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.0 and GRASS integration on OSX and Windows
Message-ID: <5240AAD7.3050205@carto.net>

Hi all,

I know that this is probably a known-issue.

We downloaded and installed the latest QGIS and GDAL packages from
Kyngchaos. The package includes GRASS, but the processing integration
does not work. Is there something that needs to be configured in
addition to get it working?

I checked the /Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS folder and GRASS
seems to be present. Processing finds the GRASS modules - they are
listed in the toolbox. However, if we open a module, e.g. v.surf.rst we
 get the error message that GRASS is missing or not configured properly.
 See http://webgis.uster.ch/temp/grass_missing_dependency.png

In the configuration panel, the settings to the GRASS folder is correct
 and it exists, however there is no MSYS available in QGIS on OSX. See
http://webgis.uster.ch/temp/grass_processing_settings.png - so the given
path /Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/msys is in fact not existing.

Most of our Windows users seem to get a very similar behavior.

Juliana has a course on Thursday and we would appreciate it very much if
we could find a solution until then.

Thank you for your help to get this working.

Andreas and Juliana

For the Mac side, I found a library link error.  I'll fix this for an update soon.

The msys setting is ignored on OS X (and Linux).  Maybe this should be shown only to Windows users so everyone else is not confused.

Hi John,

Thanks for pointing for Homebrew OTB-3.18.0 formula.

I will install it. I hope this would be compatible with OTB-3.18.1
that QGIS 2.0.1 OTB plugin is using.

I hope William will have OTB-3.18.1 binary soon so everything works in
the box, just like Windows and Ubuntu Linux counterparts.

Although, Windows QGIS OTB and GRASS plugins in Windows QGIS 2.0.1
does not work as well.

Thanks.

Regards, Noli

Hi Victor,

I hope OTB, GRASS and SAGA plugins in QGIS 2.0.1 work in Windows and
Mac OS X. I don't know what is the status of these plugins in Linux
(i.e. Ubuntu).

Anybody knows if these plugins working in Ubuntu properly?

It is not so clear in the instruction, if OTB, GRASS and SAGA binaries
are necessary to make these QGIS 2.0.1 plugins works in Processing.

Thanks, Noli

both 1.8 and 1.9. I'm using Windows 7 64 in this machine. I will try in a
linux machine latter

Should I post a ticket for this? Or just wait a bit more for the packaging
fixes.

Hi,

I don't know if anyone encountered this issue, or if it is a local problem. When I run QGIS with an account without administrative privileges, processing does not find SAGA or GRASS. If I run QGIS "as administrator", it works.

I've uninstalled everything and went back to install, and the same happens, both with OSGeo4W QGIS master and QGIS 2.0.1 standalone.

Does anyone have any idea about what could be? This happens in Windows 7.

Best regards,
Pedro

Hi Andreas,

as pointed in the past days in another thread it seems that in the
qgis 2.0 standalone installers for Windows GRASS/processing is not
working. SAGA/processing it is also not working but in this case SAGA
does not seems included at all.

They both work if QGIS is installed with osgeo4w.

cheers

Hello,

Cannot reproduce the error in here. I'm using windows 7 64bit, and I tried
in QGIS 2.0.1, 2.1.0 and 2.0.1 (64bit). In all cases, I can use SAGA.

Best Regards (Cumprimentos),

Hi Alexandre and others

Sorry for the noise. For some reason, the user in question has lost access to system32 in the environment variables, and so it could not open the command prompt (cmd.exe). Is now solved.

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro

Hi Giovanni,

I've been doing a set of tests on Windows, with the binaries that are today on QGIS website (I think they are new).

As you found, everything works with OSGeo4W version.

With standalone versions, SAGA is already included (although with different versions, which in my view is not good) and it works, but GRASS doesn't. In addition, the drivers included in one and another version are slightly different:

--> QGIS 64 (QGIS-OSGeo4W-2.0.1-2-Setup-x86_64.exe)
License overview:
1. QGIS
2. MrSID Raster Plugin for GDAL
3. OGR FileGDB Driver
4. ECW Raster Plugin for GDAL
5. Oracle Instant Client

--> QGIS 32 (QGIS-OSGeo4W-2.0.1-2-Setup-x86.exe)
License overview:
1. QGIS
2. MrSID Raster Plugin for GDAL
3. Oracle Instant Client



I leave the logs of execution of GRASS r.shaded.relief in the 3 versions, may help in diagnosing the problem. As I mentioned, with OSGeo4W GRASS works, and with both standalone versions it fails.

Hi Andreas,

as pointed in the past days in another thread it seems that in the
qgis 2.0 standalone installers for Windows GRASS/processing is not
working. SAGA/processing it is also not working but in this case SAGA
does not seems included at all.

They both work if QGIS is installed with osgeo4w.

cheers

Hi,

I've started a new Flickr group to collect pictures from developer and  
user meetings:

Please add pictures you took in Brighton. It's always great to have some  
pictures to look at and remember the good times :)

Best wishes,

Hi

Is it just for me or are symbol levels broken in master? It works fine in

Please check the existing tickets. Now that you mention it, I remember some
discussion about old plugins which made it into the installer by mistake.
Delimited text seems to be one of those.
Thanks for the feedback and best wishes

I did a link hunt and fixed up all the link errors I could find, and took care of some other packaging problems.

Also, Snow Leopard package is now ready.

Had the same problem with Linux Mint 14.
Your .qgis2 folder is owned by root after installation, so you have to  
give ownership back to your user for the folder/subfolders and files.

 Hi William,

 Thank you for your continuous support on this issue.

 Unfortunately, GRASS still does not work in my processing environment. 
 It still complains about missing dependencies.

 -------

 In parallel to Processing I am also testing the GRASS plugin.

 I can successfully create new MAPSETs and open them. The modules are 
 found, but when loading one, e.g. v.surf.rst, I get this error message:

 ----------------

 Kann Modul v.surf.rst nicht starten
 DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=
 QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=
 Befehl: /Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/grass/bin/v.surf.rst 
 --interface-description

 dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libfftw3.3.dylib Referenced 
 from: 
 /Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/grass/lib/libgrass_gmath.6.4.3.dylib 
 Reason: image not found

 -------------------

 so it seems to complain about "libfftw3.3.dylib"

 Andreas

Hi 

With today's master I get some errors when starting QGIS:

    from processing.lidar.lastools.LAStoolsAlgorithm import LAStoolsAlgorithm
  File "/home/stefan/Apps/qgis_master/share/qgis/python/qgis/utils.py", line 453, in _import

ImportError: No module named LAStoolsAlgorithm

QGIS-Version:

Same with "LAStoolsUtils".   

I'm on Ubuntu 13.04.

Hi,

I did more testing and it seems that on Windows, both 32bit and 64bit
versions are fine if I install from OSGeo4W. However, both fail if I
install from the standalone installer. This is in line with what other
people discovered.

Running, QGIS as administrator does not help in my case.

According to J?rgen both come from the same sources, so it is really a
myth why the standalone installer does not support GRASS in processing,
and OSGeo4W does support it.

Maybe there is some missing dependency in the standalone installer? The
standalone installer probably does not include all packages that can be
selected in the OSGeo4W installer?

Yes.  if you didn't do a clean install of OSGeo4W just with the qgis-full
package (like qgis-dev), you might have more stuff than the standalone
installer - maybe including dependencies that are otherwise missing.

Very odd, the package has this library link correct.  Try deleting QGIS.app and reinstalling.

Hi William,

The OTB plugin is still not working in this update.

I will send you a screenshot of the error.

Again, very odd, it's correct in the installer package.  Try deleting QGIS.app and reinstalling.

I deleted QGIS.app before installing.

I deleted QGIS.app again and reinstalled. Yet I got the same problem,
OTB is not working as showed in the screenshot that I sent you.

I had the wrong package on the disk image, it should be working now.

Also note: I didn't realize that matplotlib is now a requirement also (for graphs in Processing plugin).  Make sure to install pyparsing per the matplotlib readme.

Felt bad about it, I was in a big rush :< 
But managed to find a patch for kernel which fixes it:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60812

And to update your BIOS, you can do it from within the BIOS:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AsusZenbook#BIOS

You can open a ticket in QGIS :>
Cheers,
Saber

Subject: [Qgis-developer] connecting new style CUSTOM signal to existing
	Qgis object in Qgis2.0
Message-ID: <CAEDzf3RL7gS0vifurspXaEaj6NT7BF_GVXHh-OJVkYczPkruCw@mail.gmail.com>

For Python plugin development how do you connect a custom signal using the
new style of signals and slots to a PyQgis object, specifically to
QgsProject.instance()?  Having a hard time with this given the pyqtSignal
is defined as a python Class static variable, and then bound using
self.###.connect etc.  Is there a way to create custom signals in the new
style for objects that you don't necessarily have access to their
constructor, like for existing Qgis objects?

Additionally I noticed that from the python console in Qgis 2.0, the old
style of signals still work (connected to QgsProject) I compiled 2.0 from
source for Ubuntu, and am running both 1.8 and 2.0.  But 2.0 doesn't seem
to complain about old style signals at the python console, was wondering if
it is sharing the 1.8 version of PyQt with v.1 sip, and that is what is
causing it not to complain.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Jeff,

just an idea: how about subclassing the QGIS object in question?

Hey Jeff,

What signal are you trying to connect to?

Message-ID: <CAAwbmYi6x5DFqFvms8Fcu+5CL-pMFM++6aX3VUUf-mLKi=vRew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I saw that it is not possible to access to all downloaded QGIS plugins from
the Sextante Modeler (QGIS 2.0.1).
It would be great, in defining the model in the Graphical Modeler, if the
user can add also Algoritms from all QGIS plugins actually installed.

Is there a way to do this aclually?

For example, I am interested in the use of the following plugins:
- Add delimited text layer
- Point Sampling Tool
- Spatial Query
- ...

Thanks.
Michele

Hi all,

Been using qgis 2 for two weeks now and didn't thought this little change
would make such a huge diference in my daily work when digitizing, and I
think for qgis veterans this is just a big change.

Although I agreed with the change, I think it's way better and more logical
for new users, but it should possible to configure this in the digitizing
options.

Best,
Hugo

We debated this for a while however we feel that having options that change
the behavior of tools like this worse then just forcing a single way.  I
don't think having a option makes this better as you have to teach people
both ways because of a possible option set.  This is the same reason why
the zoom in and out is not configurable.  IMO we have to many options that
change the core behavior already which makes it hard to train users how
things work.

Yep, get it and agree!

But it's been a pain adapting to this, is like having a word processor where
the space key doesn't work as space key.

A part from this...awesome job till now, congrats to all devs!

Hi Benoit,

in your proj4 definition you have a nadgrids parameter 
(+nadgrids=ntf_r93.gsb). The error message states that the datum shift 
file (i.e. ntf_r93.gsb) could not be loaded.

Message-ID: <4592100.7202281380201644439.JavaMail.root@wmail80>

Hi to everyone!I have a big problem with a proxy web on my personal PC at work.QGIS 2.0.1 seems to ignore every setting about proxy in the settings panel (network); I have defined an environment variable called "http_proxy" according the following format:http://[username]:[password]@[ip_address]:8080but nothing happens.
I can't access the plugin repository, for example, and I can't use any WMS services external to my organization.I understood it is a bug of new QGIS version, as I can see in http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5212, but I haven't already found a good workaround.

Is something so kind to help me? I use windows 7 on my PC.

Thanks to everyone.

Giuseppe

Message-ID: <CALuHMPBbPMGT=+3HJD8vr_7UWza+ACz5fpE7Xe_ESN=3UrM9wQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

and sorry for raising this again.

Seems now we have two independent trackers for Processing. One is
original with lots of tickets in it, and another is QGIS one, where Procressing
is just one of the categories. This is confusing and makes difficult to track
tickets.

For we already have 4 tickets submitted to QGIS bugtracker and not visible
in Processing one. And I'm afraid that this count will grow in future.

Is it possible to move all Processing tickets under QGIS bugtracker or
remove "Processing (SEXTANTE)" category from QGIS redmine?

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SVG parameters
Message-ID: <5244585C.2080200@jena.de>

Hi all,

following the instructions in [1] I have parametrized my svg files. This 
works basically fine, but there are IMHO two drawbacks:
1) all elements provide defaults for stroke, fill and stroke-width but 
they cannot be displayed any more. IMHO there should be at least one 
check box saying "use defaults from file".
2) more serious: if I have fill="none" the svg is not displayed at all 
if other values have parameters; fill="param(fill) none" does not help 
either.

any help appreciated if I am missing something

this is QGIS 2.*

Hi all.
I have been submitted an interesting question: is it possible to group symbols in a

I found no easy and clean solution: is a current limitation, or am I missing something?

Hi,

Maybe I missed the memo, but there is now a 2.0.2 release designation for
tagging issues in the hub.qgis.org tracker. Is there some timeline
concerning a 2.0.2 release? If so, where?

I have been scheduling my work sessions around the expectation of a 2.1
release and have not anticipated a sooner one. Likewise, do we currently
have any timeline goals for a 2.1 release?

Regards,

2.1 and 2.0.2 are two very different beasts.

2.0.2 will be a bugfix only release, could come out any time if a bad
bad bug is found and is painless to upgrade to.

2.1.0 will be a new feature release, will only come out when enough
features are included.

PS: these are actually only my expectations, sent in hope to be 
    considered by the new release manager :)

I don't know if there is really a 2.0.2 release programmed, what I
know is that there are couple of nasty regressions (like the field
calculator that gives wrong results with otfr on, that have been
noticed just before the 2.0 release) that would certainly deserve a
2.0.2 release.

just my opinion.

IIRC 2.1.0 should be the dev branch, 2.2 will be the next release. At
least this is what timlinux and jef were discussing in Brighton.

Hi all.
I noticed the new "photo" type of editing widget for the table. It allows the
selection of a path to a photo; it is unclear to me what is therefore the meaning of
the two parameters width and length.
Thanks for clarifying.

Hi Paolo,

I'm not sure I understand correctly. Here, when I have a D'n'D form, it 
shows up with the identify feature tool and in the attribute table, 
feature view mode without any further settings.

As a user I'm very fond of the GeoServer model. I believe they have a
master branch which releases 2.x version every 6 months or so and includes
big features. Once a month they release a point release (2.3.x) which
contains bug fixes backported from the master branch as well as some lesser
"features" that have been in the master branch for a month or two.

This means there are regular releases and as I user I know what to expect
when. Much as I like both QGIS and GeoServer, both have a considerable
number of bugs and regular bug-fix releases help ameliorate this. Users
shouldn't be hitting the same bug in their stable release that was fixed in
master 12 months ago, that's something Open Source can do better than
"E$RI" (Hi Tim :-) ) and their commercial ilk.

Just my 2p,

Jonathan

If I'm not wrong, this is width and height of display area, so
all images will be scaled to fit this size

Maybe I miss something, but some time ago we decided that
we can't maintain bugfix branches for the lack of resources.

Is situation changed?

No, not as far as I know.

There has been talk about companies that maintaining own stable branch
contributing back to a stable branch.  But IIRC nothing definitive yet.

I know that you decided that there will be no dot releases. But as
Giovanni already said there are some nasty problems like GRASS and SAGA
broken for most people.

This makes release 2.0 unusable for a number of people.

I would recommend to make another release when the GRASS and SAGA
integration is fixed on Windows and OSX.

I realize developers and packagers are stretched thin but I think we should
get the release right. Not fixing errors in the packaging is not what I
would think of when it was decided to not have bug fixing releases.
Best wishes

IMHO fixing packaging issues doesn't require a new release.

I agree with Giovanni. QGIS 2.0 introduced a huge amount of new features
and it is not reasonable to expect the first version that comes out is
without major issues. For example in the weeks before the release there
were a number of problems with the nightly builds which prevented many
users from testing the new features.

As an end user I'd rather have more consolidated version of QGIS 2.0 (which
is, by any standards, awesome and way superior to ArcGIS and other freen
and commercial softwares) than see the project rushing to 2.1 without
addressing the issues have and will continue surfacing in the next weeks.

Regards

Hi,

It does or otherwise most users will never notice that a newer and 
different package is available

Hi all.
Using the validator plugin, incorrect shapes are overlayed with red, and I did not
find a way to remove that, besides closing and reopening the project: is this a bug,
or am I missing something?
All the best.

Hi all.
While the default of not showing overlapping elements makes sense for labels, it is
less reasonable for diagrams, where a partial overlap is better than missing some.
Furthermore, the option to show them all is hidden in obscure (for average user) options.
My suggestions:
* enable "show all" by default
* put the option to remove the overlapping ones in the main dialog, easy to find.
Should I open a ticket?
Thanks.

I agree releasing a fixed package with GRASS and SAGA is quite important, even if for
a minority of users.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

If I remember correctly, diagrams currently use a global setting and 
not a per layer setting for PAL settings. It will therefore be a bit 
more work than just moving the option.

My understanding of the discussion was that bugfix releases were tabled
(put on hold) until after the 2.0 release in order to let everyone work
on the 2.0 release. As others have mentioned on other threads a bugfix
release in the 2.0.x series would make a lot of sense to tackle all of
the regressions that people are finding.

We could set a deadline though, maybe a cutoff of one month since
release for bugs to tackle for bugfix and then a set time of several
months to try and fix them? Though with the packaging issue maybe it's
better to tackle the bugs in groups since that needs to get fixed soon.
I'm on the fence if purely packing fixes should get a number bump. It
might not be a bad idea to make it clear to end users that it's newer.

So Idea:
2.0.2 packaging fixes
2.0.3 in a couple months bugfix release


Thanks,
Alex

Deciding that you can't maintain a bugfix branch doesn't mean
that nobody else can. All it takes to keep the door open is
to have a 2.0 branch sit there, and require anyone willing to
push to it to carefully keep note of what gets into it.

Then, whenever someone asks for "next stable release" you
can request her to do the work, starting from the 2.0 branch.

Meanwhile, the "master" branch should be set to target next
minor release (2.1.0 in this case, right?).

There's already been 10 commits in the stable branch since
2.0.1. You can obtain the list with:

 git log final-2_0_1..release-2_0 

High level summary of what was committed:

 - win packaging fixes
 - pt_BR translation update
 - wrong .qgis2 permissions in ubuntu 13.04 (#8613)
 - fix qml file for directed edge layer in topoviewer plugin

So it does look like people are already maintaining a stable
branch, as that's what it is. Now why not keeping this info
updated on the go (like adding a NEWS item togheter with commits
that go in the branch) to reduce the cost of closing that branch
up as a release 2.0.2 ?

Hi all.
I'm trying to import OSM data with the new importer, but I get a series of problems:
1. the bounding box has to be specified in 4326. In the normal case, an user loads an
OSM background in 3857, or his data in the respective SRS. In these case, we get an
error:

Errore di download.
Error downloading
http://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter?data=(node(5.41294e+06,1.18302e+06,5.41358e+06,1.18428e+06);%3C;);out;
- - server replied: Bad Request
so the bounding box should be reprojected

2. the data are not loaded straight away, as expected

3. the xml is saved without the .osm extension, so it is not recognized by the
subsequent importer

4. the importer produces a sqlite db, but data are not recognized inside it.

Am I missing something, or should I fill tickets?

All the best.

My problem is that I do not know how to change the path in Qgis. In the "On the fly projection" dialog box, the string specifying how to reproject is read only. There must be a file where this string is specified but I don't know where.

Am I the only one facing this "on the fly" projection problem ?

Hi Benoit,

as far as I understand from your original post you want to add a raster 
layer to QGIS whose projection information is +proj=lcc +lat_1=49.5 
+lat_0=49.5 +lon_0=0 +k_0=0.99987734
+x_0=600000 +y_0=200000 +a=6378249.2 +b=6356514.999978254
+nadgrids=ntf_r93.gsb,null +pm=2.337229167 +units=m +no_defs +to
+proj=lcc +lat_1=44 +lat_2=49 +lat_0=46.5 +lon_0=3 +x_0=700000
+y_0=6600000 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs

so you have to edit this information in the file (gdal_edit or gdal_warp 
will probably do) adding the path to the gsb file. Alternativly it 
_might_ work to copy the gsb file at the same location as the raster 
file (never tried, though).

Hi all,

I have the intention to add the possibility of importing features from a 
CSV into an existing layer.
My idea is to use the existing dialog "Create a layer from a delimited 
text file" and to add the choice "create a layer" or "append to an 
existing layer".

First of all, is anyone already doing something similar?

Second, if anyone already thought about this and has some ideas to 
share, they're welcome!

Cheers,

I think a general higher level Append Features to Layer feature would be
much better.  This way it would work with any layer opened in QGIS.

Being able to supply a layer to layer mapping would be even better in case
the fields don't match.

Hi Nathan,

I understand your point.

But this would require more steps: add the layer to the project, copy 
the features (with field mapping) and remove the layer.
I see a main usage of appending to an existing layer in the import of 
GPS points for example. So mainly csv files.
It's true that there could be a great interest for shape files.

The point is that I can use the existing header of the table in the 
demilited text UI to do the field mapping. So, it should not be a great 
effort to do so.

It's clear that there is no a great cohesion with all these add layers 
dialogs and I don't want to add more confusion to this.
But is there any plan to improve this?

Denis

I don't think having three steps is a bad thing per se.  To me the workflow
is a lot clearer, expandable, and fixable.  This function doesn't belong in
the add layer dialogs because it's not their purpose.  What happens if I
wanted to append a shape file to a MS SQL layer?   This is why I think it
should be a higher level function that just take two layers and a field
mapping and runs though layer1 and appends to layer2

All-or-nothing doesn't seem effective to me.
I don't say that the work _ends_ there.
Some users will be looking for packages, others won't.
I think it's still worth to have a source tarball even if no packages exist.
It's even worth having a tag with no tarball release,  IMHO.
Every step forward is worth it.

I think you (or whoever else packages) should only package _tags_,
not branches. That way the work can be shared more easily.

That whole discussion is actually only relevant for Windows, as I 
perceive it. If you're using whatever repository with GNU/Linux or the 
likes, packagers will bump package release numbers on packaging issues 
(and other issues) and you'd get an updated package without doing a lot. 
As J?rgen said, there is no point in having a new _QGIS release_ because 
of packaging issues.

Right, but not even on Windows.  There already is a 2.0.1-2 in OSGeo4W (and
standalone installers from the same version).   And there will be a 2.0.1-3
once I've updated GDAL in OSGeo4W 32bit to 1.10.1.

Great! In this case, we only have to communicate to users of the  
stand-alone installer that there is a new, fixed installer version which  
they should try in case they had problems.

Thanks for the clarifications!

Hi all.
In Print composer, it is apparently impossible to choose icons from any directory but
fo the first one on the list.
Furthermore, the interface is quite different from the icon selector from the
Symbology, and this is confusing for the user.
Finally, I could not find anywhere the nice set of north arrows we had (justa couple
of poor wind roses.
Am I missing something?
All the best.

I also miss the "old north arrows". If I remember correctly they were
removed, along with many other symbols, because they were considered "too
ugly". I remember someone on the list mentioning an external repository of
SVG symbols though.

I've just upgraded to Linux Mint 15 and had some trouble installing
QGIS. I followed the instructions on the shiny new web pages for
Raring Ringtail.

The instructions seem to imply adding both qgis.org and the ubuntugis
PPA to sources.

The qgis.org repo seems to have 2.0.1-2, and ubuntugis had 2.0.1-1 - I
got into a weird state where the conflicts list of python-qgis
included python-qgis.... Removing the qgis repo from sources and
chanting various apt spells eventually got me a clean qgis from
ubuntugis-unstable with version 2.0.1-1~raring and python support
working.

I thought ubuntugis-unstable would be more recent (and hence less
stable) than qgis.org, so why does it have a lower version number?
What was causing the odd conflict? What did I do wrong?

The install instructions aren't very beginner friendly for Linux.

But it does look lovely.... Now time to play with the toolbox.... And
maybe start porting my plugins!

That should be a really huge OR
It's qgis.org OR ubuntugis
If you do both you end up with potential conflicts.

The version of QGIS is actually the same, -# is actuall just an
increment that gets raised every time someone reuploads the same package
with a minor packagin fix.

What differs is the versions of underlying libraries: gdal, geos, and proj

For many people having a newer gdal (1.10.x) and a newer goes fix a good
deal of bugs in support certain format reading/writing and certain
spatial analysis operations.

Sounds like it needs a little more clean up.

I had similar problems installing on raring, like you I had both listed, but
now use these instructions disable any other source you may have added:

sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass

This installs but you may get an error when starting QGIS on Ubuntu which is
normally because the owner of the .QGIS2 folder is Root rather than your
logon user. You may need to change this.

Once QGIS successfully opens you are likely to still have problems with the
Processing Toolbox (formerly SEXTANTE) if you want to use its GRASS commands
or GDAL. I have been trying for several weeks now to get the GRASS commands
in Processing to work on either Windows or Ubuntu (raring or precis) without
any success, most recently GDAL isn't configured correctly for the
processing Toolbox. I have tried various releases from 1.80, 1.9, 2.0.1 and
2.1.0-master. If you don't need the Processing Toolbox you should find most
other things are a great improvement over 1.8.

I experienced the same problem (.qgis2 folder created by root).  Is that
folder created by qgis installation? Probably, but very odd.

This is a BIG bug and should be fixed, is there a bug report on this?

Not sure what you mean exactly. Please see issue #7764 [0] for an
explanation of how that combobox works (i.e. not as a filter).

When looking to add a non-embedded widget for selecting SVG backgrounds for
labels, I opted to extract Arun's GSoC project embedded symbology selector
code to a standalone class, QgsSvgSelectorWidget [1]. There is an issue [2]
for using this to replace the one in Composer; however, there are several
design decisions to be made/coded before that can happen:

* Refactor the class to be a more generic image selector, maybe
QgsGraphicSelector or QgsImageSelector, with its construction defining a
'filter' for what type of images are to be browsed, e.g. all, .svg,
.png|.jpg, etc. This is important for replacing the Composer selector, as
it is for selecting both pixel- and vector-based images.

* Add functionality to selector to allow editing of the image search paths.
This should allow editing of app- and project-level search paths, which
should be adjusted to allow for both pixel- and vector-based images, not
just SVGs as it is now.

* Optionally, if the set selector filter allows for multiple image types,
add a filter combobox to the widget that allows for sub-filtering by
allowable image types.

* Optionally, once something like Arun's Resource Sharing tools/repository
exists [3], the selector can be integrated to pull new symbols down, or
possibly browse on-line ones.

* Optionally allow the widget to dynamically have two basic aspect ratio
layouts, horizontal and vertical, for when embedding in a wider variety of
parent layouts.

Once the class is fixed up, it can replace the embedded code in symbology
and the selector in Composer, and offer a consistent selector to be used
across the app and by plugin developers.

Any opinions on this would be greatly appreciated. While I can code this, I
do not currently have time to do so. Anyone looking for a straightforward
and very useful project, this is a good one.

Hi Denis

I'm not sure if you are suggesting adding this to the existing delimited text layer function (bad idea!), or adding a new function using components of the existing delimited text layer.  I say bad idea for a couple of reasons.  FIrstly the UI is already cluttered enough, and adding some additional controls to offer appending to an existing layer would I think make it even more confusing.  Secondly I think an "import data" function is very different from a "create layer" function, so they don't belong in the same place in the menu - it would be too hard to find.

On the other hand I can see that there is a very valid case for an import data type of function (and as Nathan points out, it isn't specific to CSV files).  In your case that is what you want, but I can easily imagine users wanting to import data from other data sources (eg databases, web services, etc).  But obviously that makes it a much bigger task :-)

You were asking if anyone is working on this.  I don't know for sure (!).  But things that may impact on it that I do know about:

1) R?gis Haubourg was suggesting that we should merge the delimited text layer with the OGR CSV provider, so that in effect the UI just becomes a front end for setting up the OGR driver.  This would mean updating the OGR driver to support the functions in the delimited text driver first (such a regular expression - messy because there are many different implementations and currently we are using the Qt version).

2) The dialog (and provider) needs to be improved to support explicitly selecting field types (slightly messy because the field types can come from a CSVT file).  Automatically inferring field types is generally useful, but has created issues with linking data (eg when text field is interpreted as numeric)

3) There is a suggestion that it could have a capability to support importing multiple files at once.

Anyway just thought this could be useful background if you are working in this area...

Cheers
Chris

Hi Nathan,

I understand your point.

But this would require more steps: add the layer to the project, copy the features (with field mapping) and remove the layer.
I see a main usage of appending to an existing layer in the import of GPS points for example. So mainly csv files.
It's true that there could be a great interest for shape files.

The point is that I can use the existing header of the table in the demilited text UI to do the field mapping. So, it should not be a great effort to do so.

It's clear that there is no a great cohesion with all these add layers dialogs and I don't want to add more confusion to this.
But is there any plan to improve this?

Denis

I think a general higher level Append Features to Layer feature would be much better.  This way it would work with any layer opened in QGIS.

Being able to supply a layer to layer mapping would be even better in case the fields don't match.

Hi all,

I have the intention to add the possibility of importing features from a CSV into an existing layer.
My idea is to use the existing dialog "Create a layer from a delimited text file" and to add the choice "create a layer" or "append to an existing layer".

First of all, is anyone already doing something similar?

Second, if anyone already thought about this and has some ideas to share, they're welcome!

Cheers,

Denis

Hi William,

In the last screenshot on the OTB Plugin for QGIS 2.0.1-2 Mac OS X
error that I sent you, it seems that there is dynamic library that is
not loading.

"dylb: Library not loaded" (in the screenshot error)

 In compiling OTB Plugin for QGIS 2.0.1-2 Mac OS X, does OTB-Plugin
requires OTB binary installed in your system?

What might be this dynamic library not loading, (i.e. what is this library)?

I hope we can make OTB plugin working in Mac OS X.

Thanks,

Regards, Noli

Sounds a good programme. Hopefully somebody will have time to, IMHO the current
situation is suboptimal.

shouldn't this be a blocker? wouldn't this require to release a fixed installer for w64?
thanks.

I don't really understand the term blocker once a release is out.  critical
would be a better level.

Hi,

apparently the all-downloads pages as currently available is not ok (see
issue below).

We made a separation on that page in;

Recommended installers
Development version
Older versions

And all of these have an 'windows', 'ubuntu, 'debian' etc section

I think it would be better do group per OS:
So
Windows
	stable
	dev
Ubunut
	stable
	dev
	..

etc. More like:

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Download

Is there somebody available with enough insight in all those builds, to
fix this?
Or should we just copy the old hub-Download page into the all-downloads?

Regards,

Richard

http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#ubuntu is wrong.
It merges 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 in
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Download#26-Ubuntu, which it shouldn't.

2.6.1 describes how to get qgis from our repository for ubuntu (i.e. w/o
anything from ubuntugis) and 2.6.2 describes how to get qgis from
ubuntugis (i.e. w/o anything from our repository) - mixing the two will
create a mess.

For the ubuntugis nightlies it'S different. We have newer qgis versions
in our repository, so mixing will fetch the nightly qgis from our
repository and dependencies from ubuntugis.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] The case for bugfix releases
Message-ID: <CAA-xNcX4AM9S-Eydq1EMBDJHfKsUf6fq94NjqQ3fPDm698=QHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Oops, this was meant to go to the dev list.


Hi List,
    Following on from the other thread, I wanted to put forward the case
for bugfix releases. I missed the previous conversation and apologise for
rekindling it, but feel strongly on the subject so wanted to put forth my
reasoning.
    The reason given for why QGIS doesn't as I understand it is lack of
resources.


    I think by not using some developer resources on bugfixes, the cost of
not releasing regularly is passed on to the users and becomes considerably
inflated. There's also a hidden cost to developers who spend their time
interacting with users.

    All of the following are consequences of irregular releases (there are
probably more):

    - Users spend a considerable amount of time reporting a bug in stable
only to discover it's "fixed in master". This has happened multiple times
to me.

    - Users are often asked to "please test this in master" when they
report a bug, forcing them to spend potentially much more time reporting
the same issue.

    - There are countless threads in the user list where the final
conclusion is - "this is already implemented/fixed in master".

    - All the time lost by users on stable as they hit bugs that are
already fixed in master.

    ---

    Furthermore, regular releases are also part of the iterative cycle of
OpenSource development. With 2.x, a ton of new bugs have no doubt appeared
in the new features (I know you've all done lots to minimise this, but it's
inevitable). By releasing regularly the cycle of Bug Reporting ->
Development -> Release, can stay tight and efficient. As shown above that's
not the case currently.

    The current cycle discourages users (well, at least it does me) from
reporting bugs except immediately after a release.

    ---

    I do appreciate QGIS has finite developer resources, and while I don't
pretend to know/understand how the GeoServer/QGIS projects are structured,
it does seem that QGIS has considerably more developers (both core and
contributory) than GeoServer which does manage regular bugfix releases.

    Maybe there's scope for optimising the release process, or issuing
patches rather than full releases, or something else, but that isn't my
area.

    See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early_release_often

    Just a thought from a bug-reporting non-developer,
    Jonathan

I understand.  And I'm saying that that link error (and many others) is fixed in the current build.  You don't need anything else installed for OTB to work, OTB and the libraries/frameworks linked are included in QGIS.app.

Note that when I re-fixed the installer I didn't bump the version number (because the broken package was still the old package), so make sure to download it again.

Same error here on 2.1 from ubuntu-unstable.

But it's not only throwing an error, but Processing is also marked as  
invalid and therefore unusable.

Hi William,

Yes, OTB plugin is working now. I read the QGIS user ML archive ( Re:
OS X 2.0 packages - Try) update and found out there is a new version
of the installer, so download it and installed it before your email
below.

Now, I am trying to figure out why my GRASS plugin is still now not
working in Processing. It seems "Processing" could not still find the
right things to run GRASS. Any suggestion how to fix this issue?

BTW, I also installed GRASS standalone in my system. I understand this
might not be needed to run the GRASS Plugin in "Processing".

Thanks again.

Regards, Noli

Hi all, 
I just kept silent seing how 2.0 release went out, and I must say I totally
agree with Jonathan. I have been funding bugfixing for 2.0 release, and
found that this is completly inadapted to commercial contracts, all goes to
fast in last months before the release. By contract, I mean "fix bug#235,
and 789 and so on". 
I would love to be able to donate blindly, but this is forbidden by public
market rules.  
Having a bug fix release every 3 or 6 months is necessary to me. And having
a release candidate for major versions changes is also absolutly needed. 

PSC says there is no bugfix by lack of ressources. Please consider I have
not been able to spend all my budget because of the very fast developpement
speed and the lack of visibility for contributors in last release. All my
time was burned in testing- bug tracking, not passing contracts. When I
finally launch a contract, 2/3 of the bugs were already solved when the work
started. 
I'm also aware of commercial support offered by some corps on QGIS, but they
are not affordable to us with the current diplayed prices. 
I also tried to contribute to clarify 2.1 roadmap a few months ago. We had
really interesting discussions on this. I would really have liked to see a
public roadmap indicating wih features or bugfix were accepted or consider
high or low priority in future versions. Even if this roadmap is often
modified, that is a need for funders and contributors. 

So.. any hope for us to see this happen? All the great stuff in 2.0 deserve
that we put some quality in that process. If funding or sponsoring can solve
this, please tell. At the moment, I don't think money is the first thing
needed. 

R?gis

Just an hour ago I discovered a problem with the bundled GRASS.

Quick fix, in a Terminal:

sudo chmod +x /Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/grass/grass.sh

I'll package an update later.

QGIS has its own bundled GRASS, and should find it automatically.  It should be possible to use an installed GRASS, but you have to know what to enter for the path (not the .app, but the MacOS folder inside the app).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] libqscintilla2 as build dependency
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR969iFAwo7pFwvNEfRNL+HATHS995wjVQARH=D9gGAZHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

There has been some discussion on having QScintilla2 [0] code editors for
Project Macros and for Expression Builder text areas, i.e. in core C++ code.

Currently the Qsci.so (QScintilla2) Python module is a runtime dependency
for the new console and its editor, and for an editor in Processing. In
order to embed similar code editors in C++ classes, the libqscintilla2
library will need to be found and linked during the build process. Since
the C++ lib is a dependency for installs of the Python module, most users
should already have it.

I think it would be prudent to then establish a base class, e.g.
QgsCodeEditor, with python bindings. I believe Salvatore may have started
on this, and there may be some C++ libs or projects out there already to
investigate. Once that's done, we can port the console's 'code editor' font
and color styles settings to C++ and add a new tab in Options.

This will allow the editors in Console and Processing to have parity with
user-chosen styles, so all editors look, and generally work, the same
across the app, regardless of underlying code language. It is unclear to me
whether the C++ subclass of QScintilla2 can just be passed as a PyQt
object, via PyQGIS bindings, and only the Qsci.so module is still required.
I would assume so, but will ask on the PyQt list.

If there is a concern about adding this libqscintilla2 dependency in the
CMake setup, please share your opinion so we can discuss it, before I
commit the change.

Yes, its not very friendly for Linux beginners who may never have
edited apt sources files before. It may be a better idea to suggest
putting the deb lines into /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.list (assuming
the various distros apt versions support a directory of source lists).
I'm also not sure the Linux installation should talk about
'installers' since that to me means a runnable executable that does
the installation (as in Windows) and not a package-based system, but
thats a minor quibble.

 So I'm still a bit unclear what the text should say. Is it:

 """
EITHER:

Get the latest stable version via packages from qgis.org by creating
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.list with the correct lines for your
Ubuntu version:

deb     http://qgis.org/debian raring main
deb-src http://qgis.org/debian raring main

[etc]

and then run sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install qgis [etc etc].

OR

 Get the latest unstable/bugfix version from the ubuntugis project via
the ubuntugis-unstable PPA:

[apt-add-repository instructions etc]

 and then run sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install qgis [etc etc]

"""

I don't know why the current instructions mention "the ubuntugis
project" at the start of the text telling you to add qgis.org to
sources.list. Are these packages the same/previous versions of
packages that appeared on the ubuntugis PPA?

Also, typo on http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html
"Recommendend", should be "Recommended".

While I'm being picky :) the FreeBSD instructions simply say:

"""
To compile QGIS from binary packages type:

pkg_add -r qgis
"""

Surely you only compile from source packages? Does this do an
*install* from binary packages?

Hi,

well, the instructions were streamlined too much.  The original ubuntu
instructions on http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Download are still correct
(give or take some added or removed distributions).

I opened a ticket on https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/issues/104 yesterday.

Um, we bugfix.  We just don't do do stable/bugfix releases and master is
released too infrequent.

In the past we have set high targets for coming releases without knowing when
we'll actually achieve them in our volunteer effort - because most of us don't
knows in advance how much time they will be able to spend on qgis.  That led to
long release cycles and changes when we realized that a set feature wouldn't
make it.

And also to the problem that the last release and master diverge more and more,
making it hard to track, if bugs in the release still apply to master.

My approach to solve this would be fixed release schedules instead of releases
tied to a set of features.  At the hackfest, we discussed a release every 4
month.  If we follow that route new features and bugfixes would get into a
regular release every four months.   That window is probably large enough to
get new features done, while being not too large for users to wait for releases
of bugfixes and/or new features.

And everyone knows in advance, when the next release will be.  Developer can
estimate if they can get a new feature ready for the next release or if they
have to wait for the next one.  Testers, translators, documenters and packages
can also know in advance, when they'll need some time to do their thing.

And this IMHO also reduces the need for bugfix/stable releases, which I still
don't think, we have the resources for.  Because this also involves packaging
each time.

Maybe there's some difference to the geoserver project - being java they might
get away with "package once, run anywhere" - while for us, packaging a release
is more work (and testing and bugtracking...).

Anyway, this this is not yet set in stone as I'm currently still sorting out
stuff related to the 2.0 release (e.g. in OSGeo4W) - and therefore didn't have
time to come with draft for this.  So when this actually starts is still TBD.

Hi,

I/m rewriting download page.

There you are pointed to http://qgis.gotslack.org/ for Slackware.

But that one is 1.8.0

Is that 'just the latest on the latest slack'?

Or is it just an old link, to be updated (with??????).

Could you add a line or two for archlinux? Several archlinux users are
currently working on getting QGIS 2.0 working from AUR. We do have some
python issues, but when they are solved, it will become visible in the AUR
comments and versions available.

Something like:

Archlinux users are encouraged to use the Arch User Repository (AUR).
Information about available versions, bugs and archlinux specific
instructions can be found at: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=qgis


Thanks!

Milo

Hi William,

This did the track. I can confirm that GRASS within Processing now works
fine on OSX once I manually set these executable permission for the
grass.sh file.

Thanks a lot for finding this out.

I had actually been wondering if we should make a small deb that users
can double click that does the setup of the repos for them (creates the
source.list.d/qgis.list). Would even be awesome to make it detect the
version of the OS and put in the right repos for that version. Then we
could move the how to do it by hand to an Advanced section.

I've seen some other projects do this (Trying to find a good example).

Barry - To clarify again, the Ubuntugis version is the same version of
QGIS, what differs is GDAL, PROJ and GEOS - by significant version, ie
gdal 1.8 vs 1.10

This is critical because 1.10.x supports more of the formats people
having been asking for like HDF, etc...

To be honest I always recommend Ubuntugis/Stable or /Unstable to
everyone I work with over the qgis.org packages. Partly because of
serious things fixed in GDAL but also because its the best way to get
Postgis2, which is becoming common with QGIS users, and newer Spatialite
(outside QGIS).

The qgis.org sweet spot seems to be the nightly builds which are for the
more technically inclined anyways and should know how to manipulate apt.

Thanks,
Alex

Wholeheartedly agree,

but, at the risk of being the one that turns it into a discussion, I'm curious. What do QGIS as installed by OSGeo4W packages and QGIS installed by ubuntugis-unstable ppa packages classify as?

If I understand correctly, the QGIS package itself uses the stable code, but the dependencies are updated as new versions become available. Over time they are recompiled to fit these dependencies and diverge further from the original QGIS release. As shown on this list, both of these versions are may not stable at these times of updating.

Would a note warning of such a possibility be enough? 
I know there's a note to this effect on to the ubuntu-gis repository website. I don't recall one on the OSGeo4W website. 
I'm also not sure how you'd go about explaining it to (new) OSGeo4W users, however in both cases the QGIS downloads page tells you how to download directly without mentioning this possibility or pointing at the website note.

-ramon.
(Apologies if I set the discussion off).

QGIS Stable with dependency updates?

OR:
"Stable"
QGIS Stable standalone <- If you're new to qgis and want full control
when you upgrade (Normal User), don't plan to use many plugins.

QGIS Stable updatable+extendable (Even if we rarely push bug fixes
releases now) <- If you want bugfixes and updates to underlying
libraries (GDAL updates often add formats over time - ie HDF, jpg2000,
ecw, mrsid) (Power User)
This version is also easier to install additional libraries for various
plugins you may want. Plugins with Stable may require lots of extra
work. [This is OSGeo4w and Ubuntugis (Line between stable/unstable isn't
clear right now)]

--
"Development"
QGIS development (Developers and Power Users who don't mind occasional
non-working versions) [OSGeo4w dev and Nightlies]


The first 2 will work except when you hit an occasional bug or briefly
during upgrade if you try to upgrade too soon. <- hard to explain

Development version assumes you understand instability and are willing
to put up with it or help.



Not sure if any of that helps simplify the discussion. Guess we can
repack the Standalone occasionally with newer osgeo4w stacks if major
upgrades occur. 2.0.1-1 -2 -3 etc...

- From the log I get:
Cannot verify coverage full extent:
Impossibile verificare la completa estensione della coverage:
no data received.
The request seem to get a timeout, but it does not wait more than a couple of
seconds, whereas in my settings the timeout is 60000.
Any hint?

Hi all.
IMHO the new approach from Juergen should solve most of our problem. I understand
people may need even more frequent (monthly) backporting of fixes. The only way I see
this may become possible is to fund a small team of dedicated backporters, that can
also take care of the prodction of binaries. For Windows, we are discussing about
improving osgeo4w to make this easier.
This could be a reasonable investment, if shared among a group of power users, and
would not interfere with mainstream development.
All the best.

Hi

The package suffix -dev or -devel are often used to mark packages 
containing development files such as headers.
Therefore I would stick to another term for this purpose ( nightly, 
master, alpha, beta, preview, testing, unstable, no strong opinion from 
my side ), so we can use the same term throughout the homepage and 
packages.

Regards
Matthias

I think frequent releases mixing features and bugfixes are not going to
help those whose need is stability. Stability needs bugfix _only_ releases
as _any_ new feature mines the stability of the software.

Also, insisting in the production of binary makes the release process more
complex than it could be. Binary packaging and source releases should be
separate processes, IMHO. Some distributors already make binary packages
directly from develompent snapshots, if their policy needs frequent fixes,
core developers shouldn't care about binary packages because there are so
many different possible packages to make and all of them can be generated
by others from official source-level releases.

But developers should pay attention about keeping "stable" and "development"
branches separated and well-defined, and learn (over time, by trial and error)
to distinguish "safe" fixes for deny or accept in the stable branch(es).

Asking package interest groups to invest in the production of those
packages is a good idea. A precedent I know of has been Regina who
run a pledgebank-based successful campaign for a PostGIS win64
package: http://www.pledgebank.com/postgis64windows

As for "backporters", stability isn't something newcomers
can take care of alone. I mean it'll still take review of patches
by core team members in order to reduce the possibility of
introducing new bugs while trying to fix more. 
A "team of dedicated backporters" formed by core committers should
avoid that problem.

good point - IMHO alpha, preview, testing, unstable are acceptable, the others are
less appropriate and understandable.

Ok, I agree too, I did not think about that.

QGIS stable
QGIS testing

Ok?

I would prefer "Preview" or "Testing" - as "unstable" implies that it
is less stable than the official releases, which is not necessarily
the case. It can be less stable, but in between there could be
releases that are more stable than the official release. So unstable
is not a very good term in my opinion. Personally I like "Preview".

Hi Crhis,

Thanks a lot for your comments.

I say bad idea for a couple of reasons.  FIrstly the UI is already cluttered enough, and adding some additional controls to offer appending to an existing layer would I think make it even more confusing.  Secondly I think an "import data" function is very different from a "create layer" function, so they don't belong in the same place in the menu - it would be too hard to find.
Indeed, my first intention was to use the same dialog. I agree it's not 
the right place.

In your case that is what you want, but I can easily imagine users wanting to import data from other data sources (eg databases, web services, etc).  But obviously that makes it a much bigger task :-)
Then, there is two ways to achieve import:

- as Nathan suggested, copy features from a layer to antoher
- unify the add layer dialogs and add an option in them that specify 
"append to a layer". And this could possibly open the "copy features 
dialog" from the first option.

We could use an attribute table with editable header to do the field 
mapping.

Then, would you consider this a good solution:
- add a "copy features to another layer" option
- add an option in the "add layer" dialogs for appending instead of 
creating a new layer

Thanks for the info. Although, I am not sure it would change something 
to the workflow.

I'm not really sure it is any different.  This is almost all the code you
would need (minus the field mapping stuff and error checking)

for feature in sourcelayer.getFeatures():
    destlayer.dataProvider().addFeatures([feature])

By making it high level like this means you don't need to care what the
provider is only that you can write to it. That means I can append MS SQL
-> MS SQL, MS SQL -> PostGIS, Shape -> PostGIS, KML -> PostGIS, all without
caring.

This is a append/import/merge dialog that I have used in another
application while working in local gov and I found it pretty good
http://www.assetic.com/files/myData-software-interfaces.jpg.  Ignore the
Primary Key bit at the top as that doesn't really matter in our case.  The
important part is the ability to say Field A == Field C.

Any only else share the opinion that we should stop making packages and trust
that others will pick up?

I have seen activity on Debian, do not know about the rest.
Certainly we'll have to deal with Windows at the very least.
All the best.

Probably not for the most popular platforms (Windows, OSX,
Ubuntu/Debian). I hope that one day we will have enough donations to pay
for the release and packaging work. Or maybe a commercial QGIS support
company will have enough contract work that allows it to subsidize work
and be responsible for the packaging of at least one of the major
platforms. This way the packaging work could be better distributed.

Interesting discussion.
Packaging isn't something I know much of anything about, but from a Windows
perspective, if there are bugfix releases, might it be worth releasing them
as patches/service packs rather than complete new releases? In a corporate
environment where software installation is scripted an entirely new release
needs to be scripted which can be a lot of effort and potentially can wipe
out a users preferences. Patches/service packs are a lot easier for the
user.
No idea how feasible that is.

Sorry, I meant "bugfix releases". I know you (and the others) bugfix and a
lot of my reported bugs are closed, reflecting that! :-)   - Despite
proofreading it a couple of times I still missed that.

I'm not sure how feasible a service pack type release is. It might be
possible to ship only the binaries that have changed in a self extracting
zip but I'm not sure.

New installs of QGIS with the same major version don't wipe or remove any
settings as far as I know.  I have always been able to install over the top
of my 2.0 install with the recent builds and it keeps my plugins and
settings.

Hi Richard,

there is a SlackBuild script at Slackbuilds.org (which is preferred
way to install packages in Slackware). It is also for 1.8 but can be
easily adopted for 2.0

I'm not suggesting anyone to _stop_ doing something, only to allow
for releases to exist before they are binary packaged by anyone.

Message-ID: <5249665C.2030309@gmail.com>

Hi,

I have two questions regarding the print composer:

- is there anyway of using some fields to determine the printed bounding 
box instead of using the feature's geometry?
if no, do you think it could be an interesting feature?

- While trying to use overview map, it did not print the correct 
location (it used a previous area).
  Is this normal?
Does this depend on the mode of rendering (render vs rectangle)?

Thanks a lot,

Denis

I would also appreciate a one-click solution. But I would make a shell 
script instead of a .deb, so it will work across different 
distributions.

-1. I don't think that's a good idea. We've now seen that packaging is
not trivial enough to be done by just anyone. It needs dedicated
people and experience to produce working packages.

I think this would cause a lot of confusions ... even more versions
floating around. Which group of users would profit from this solution?

Those who build qgis from source (includes packagers).
I shall notice that this group includes _all_ developers
(current and potential).

 Another annoyance: I can't get SAGA geoprocessing working. I think
this is because the saga version on ubuntugis-unstable is 2.0.8, but
QGIS requires 2.1 according to:

http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/html/en/docs/user_manual/processing/3rdParty.html

 Also, those docs mention an option I can't find: the "SAGA Folder"
setting in the SAGA configuration. Is this supposed to be in the
Processing/Options and Configuration dialog in QGIS 2.0? - Maybe that
will either magically appear when I do get SAGA 2.1 installed or its a
hangover from an earlier QGIS....

 Sorry to bring these up post-release, but I had to upgrade my machine

Hi Richard,

SlackBuilds.org is an one of the "official repositories" for Slackware.
It provides scripts with build/install rules (so called SlackBuilds) that
used to create packages from sources. This is correct way to install
packages in Slackware.

Slackbuilds are bash scripts that contain all necessary information for
creating package including compiler flags, configure options etc. So
user always can look at this script, adjust it and create package with
all desired functionality and without unused options.

I contacted QGIS SlackBuild maintainer. Now at SlackBuilds.org there
is a SlackBuild for QGIS 1.8. SlackBuild for QGIS 2.0 already uploaded
(to be precise, it uploaded at 20-Sep-2013 19:33) and now waits for
approval. When it will be approved, it automatically will replace old one
for QGIS 1.8.

So I hope we can add to downloads page link

http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.0/academic/qgis/

Currently this is for version 1.8, I'll track it and when it will be updated
I'll let you know

Isn't it lovely how the slackware packager is independent from
the core team ? Can you ask if he got the code from a source
tarball or from git ? It's a pity if Slackware users can only
get a 2.0 version with broken symbology for directed edge layer
of topologies, maybe he'd happily upload a 2.0.2 if it was tagged ?

Message-ID: <CAAwbmYjQ3-tpfNPf8YeSCtMrfGGVgnZymg7dmV9LJ5XAe4jGNw@mail.gmail.com>

I am new to QGIS 2.0.1 Modeler (Sextante) and not very able in Python
programming.

My question regard the use of field calculator (or advanced python field
calculator) inside the modeler. Is it possible to refer in the field
calculator formula to an input variable of the sextante model?

Example for Buffer: In the graphical modeler I define 2 model inputs: 1) *
layer* = the point layer to be buffered (type: vector layer) 2) *buff_dist*
= the buffer radius (type: number)

I use the "Fixed distance buffer" algorithm, setting "Imput Layer" =
*layer* and
"Distance" = *buff_dist*. It creates a temporary output shapefile. I want
to add a new numeric field in the output of the "buffer" algorithm, with
value equal to the buffer distance previously defined (*buff_dist*). How
can I refer to the variable *buff_dist* in the Formula (or Global
Expression) of the "Field Calculator" (or "Advanced Pyculator") algorithm??

Thanks.

Michele

I think if we have a dedicated Ubuntu and Windows build team and our 
core developers could just add a tag and then get back to implementing 
new cool features and solve nasty bugs, hesitation would be less.
I already hear the users of these two systems scream when there's a 
release tagged but not available in their repo.
I think we would happily accept you as maintainer of either of these. 
Which one do you prefer? :-)

I see there has been much activity on packaging qgis for Debian in the last few days.
Of course, we also need backports, etc.
all the best.

I never learnt packaging. As a lazy person the weight of learning
packaging is more than the weight of building things myself
(even if cmake is kind of changing the balance, lately, not letting
me just type ./configure && make).

That said, I think you should ask the screamers about maintaining
the package, not me (I don't scream for qgis package :)

Helping users to help themselves may grow the community even more!

That's a known packaging issue previous discussed with Johan.
SAGA 2.1 requires newer wxwidgets than 12.04 has (which could also
effect GRASS). He was hesitant to put wxwidgets in Ubuntugis. I think he
was going to ask Victor to make it possible to still use 2.0.8 with
Processing/Sextante, which we do have.

Or you can get it from https://launchpad.net/~johanvdw/+archive/saga-gis
Not sure if it will break GRASS or not.

Last discussion on the topic was on in August.

Tried adding that PPA, now saga conflicts with itself in synaptic.

And if I install with apt-get it removes Qgis. If I try and install
Qgis, it removes Saga.

$ sudo apt-get install saga

currently says

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies.
 saga : Depends: libgdal1 (>= 1.8.0) but it is not going to be installed
        Depends: liblas1 but it is not going to be installed

trying to install libgdal1 results in qgis and a bunch of other
packages being REMOVED (in capitals) - I guess because they use
libgdal1h? Whatever that is.

I'm a bit disappointed that I've started from a clean, modern Ubuntu
install (ok, Mint) and am instantly in some kind of dependency hell. I
was hoping it would be "add a source, get qgis, get other goodies,
play".

 Does this all work off OSGeo Live 7?

FYI, there's a recently new ppa purge command which is awesome for
cleaning out ppas and stuff they installed back to base system.

As for this issue, I reread some stuff and saw a hint from Victor that
there's a checkbox in the plugin config to enable SAGA 2.0.8 to work
with QGIS 2+

I think SAGA 2.1 will have to wait for newer than Ubuntu 12.04

Agreed, important in this discussion.

We all know that, I think, just nobody has time to maintain bugfix
branch. As Paolo pointed out above, backporters have to be paid. I am
sure that for most sponsors the stability is of high importance, so
let some part of sponsorship is regularly used to pay maintenance of
bugfix branch and releases.

BTW, the reason it took so long to get out 2.0 was API change, we
don't want to break API too frequently but takes long time to get
larger API changes stable. This will happen with 3.0 again.

And very important to the reputation of the whole project. We are now
seeing the effects of telling users/reporters they need to wait until the
next release for bug fixes. I propose a compromise, of sorts, which offers
the advantages of the approach noted by Juergen and a focus on backporting
to a stable branch.

The problem is that while feature, API, GUI and string freezes are mandated
leading up to a release (towards the obvious goal of stability), once 2.0
was tagged for released, for example, the flood gates were again opened on
master branch and new features came pouring in. This makes quick
backporting of fixes to a stable branch much more difficult, and
exponentially so as time goes on. I think this is the root cause of discord
between users/reporters and developers: it gives the appearance that the
release branch is now abandoned and/or that the developers are not
concerned with stability.

A possible solution is to have a 'release freeze' period that extends the
freezes reasonably beyond the package releases, with devs strictly focusing
on addressing immediate issues with the current release, committing the
fixes to master branch. Any timely fixes can quickly be ported (maybe just
easily cherry-picked) between branches. For 2.0, this would have markedly
slowed feature improvements to master branch for many weeks, but greatly
helped towards stability. After a period of time (depends upon issues), a
bug-fix release is tagged for packaging, the freezes are lifted, and a
backporting team, hopefully funded, continues work on maintaining the
release branch, while devs go back to focusing on making QGIS better.

For future releases, with quicker release frequencies, the freeze period
after a release may not be that long at all. A worthy trade-off IMHO,
towards stable releases and not causing a backporting hell scenario.

Essentially, I think we, as developers, need to take more step towards the
stability of releases, after they are released, which equates to
maintaining the reputation of the project.

Larry
