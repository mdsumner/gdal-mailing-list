Message-ID: <48BB8230.7070401@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
We are interested in setting up a test suite for QGIS (open a grass
layer, set up a new grass location, etc.), in order to regularly check
new versions. I know close to nothing to the "make test" mechanism, so I
have no idea of how feasible it would be to include the test in it.
Alternatively, we can set up the paces to replicate by hand, along with
sample test files etc.
1. what do you think about it?
2. would it be useful to set up a wiki page describing the useful steps?
All the best.

Hi all.
Some time ago I'm post question about updating map after inserting new

need call iface.getMapCanvas().refresh(). So I'm fix my python plugin, but
it don't work. 
I write two simple plugins for testing insert and both of them don't work
correctly on different PC's (Windows XP Pro SP1 and Windows XP Pro SP2, Qgis

I prepared a ms-windows installer based on the current development branch.
As usual, there's a problem with the mapserver export and plugin installer, 
that are missing in the plugin menu (even if present in qgis\python\plugins)
The test installer is available here:

Hi!
Thanks for correcting the metadata in RGB plugin, but two of new 
ones, "AddWkt" and "Azimuth and Distance" are described as 0.1 in their 
__init__.py and and as 0.2 in the repo. It informs the installer about 
available update again and again. I tend to reduce the number of workarounds 
for broken metadata, so If you could correct also this two plugins... ;)

Hi! Sorry I was so quiet last weeks, but I hope I'm just coming back to life 
these days. The Installer is ready for a long time! And I hope it's tested 
enough. 

However I see two related issues, which have to be solved before 1.0 release 
(but not necessarily before putting to trunk). I didn't work on it yet, but 
now I'm ready to get down to that,

1. Due to the new menu layout, it's necessary to finally place the installer 
item (now it's hardcoded, so may come to wrong menu in some OSes). I see two 
solutions: 
a) keep it in the Plugins menu, next to the Plugin Manager and prior to the 
separator, by creating a method for QgisApp (similar to the 
QgisApp.addPluginMenu)
b) take it completely from the menu and launch by a button in the Plugin 
Manager. 
I hesitate which one will be more usable. I think the latter, but The Manager 
window may become a a bit crowded. What do you think? I can code it 
tonight-tomorrow.

2. Due to the API changes, I suggest to create new repositories ("Official" as 
well as the author's ones), containing plugins rewritten to the new API. 

It's also good time for dividing the official repo into two: moderated and 
testing one, as we found some time ago. At least we should delegate someone 
to take care on plugn metadata, because correcting the repository entries is 
much more reasonable than upgrading the Installer's workarounds after every 
release of plugin with broken metadata.

Hello All,
Sorry I'm answering so late, but I think it may be still important.

I have no clear idea what to do, but I think for most users introducing 
language names to the interface may even decrease the clearnes. From the 
user's point of view, the difference is rather between "permanently installed" 
and "installable". So maybe the simplest and clear way is to leave it as is 
now and to add a context help explaining the matter.

I think it would be only a mess...

It's done a few weeks ago with the new Installer and my patch for qgisapp.cpp 
(never appllied in the svn), but after changing the menu layout it needs a 
different way (see the "The Installer / Re: Ready for feature freeze?" topic 
on the qgis-developer). I'm waiting for any suggestions and then will 
implement that.

I see no way to simplify the C++ plugins installation. We can't expect that 
authors will provide their plugins for every platform and every QGIS release. 
We aren't fascists ;) For that reason I think more complicated installation 
is safer, because the user/admin usually will know, what he has installed 
manually and what to do after QGIS upgrade. One click install may bring a 
number of plugins installed and "uncontrolled" by user's mind. So once again, 
the present state + explanation in the help system is sufficient in my 
opinion.

> By the way, how does one "uninstall" plugins?

Python plugins are now easily uninstallable by the new Installer.

Borys

Borys,

Just my 5 low-level eurocents to this issue.
I think that plugins developers writing in C++ language should provide

1. At least two compile-time tests (preprocessor directive #ifdef):

a) Supported platform - on what platforms a plugin can be built.
IOW, a plugin is neither built nor installed on unsupported platforms.

b) Minimal QGIS version required to use a plugin

2. One run-time check to confirm minimal required version of QGIS.
IMO, it would be nice to add a small reflection to plugin base class - 
QgsPlugin:

class QgsPlugin
{
    // Returns min. required version of QGIS supported by plugin
    virtual unsigned int qgisVersion() const = 0;
};


// somewhere in plugins loader (pseudo-code)

ver = currentQgisVersion

for plugin in plugins:
    if ver >= plugin.qgisVersion():
       load plugin

This way, plugins for which minimal requirements are not satisfied
won't get loaded.


I'm a newbie regarding qgis plugins development, so perhaps I'm 
suggestion what has been implemented already. If I am, please forget.

In general, we should proceed with a freeze on additional new features. 
However there may be a few recently added features that still need some 
refinement.

> Tom is there anything pending from your side that we need to hang 5 for?

I'd like to apply the GRASS Qt4 upgrade. (Code change but no new features.)

As Borys noted, the Plugin menu code still needs to be rewritten so 
arbitrary items can be inserted. This will add a few more public 
accessors like those for all the other menus.

Hi Mateusz, 
Your improvements are helpful, of course, but they aren't sufficient to 
implement the automatic installation. The main problem remains: some plugins 
stop working after QGIS upgrade. It's the reason for my opinion, that 
simplifying of the installation without providing stable and up-to-date 
plugin repositories may cause many troubles in the future and isn't good for 
QGIS reputation ;)

We have a lot of work on another features, so for me the best choice is to 
polish "python plugin distribution system" ;) and tend to include more 
important of C++ plugins to the QGIS package. For other ones, authors can 
provide installers (also with possibility to determine QGIS version)

Regards!

QGIS core plugins should run on all platforms. 3rd party plugins run
on platforms defined by their developer and the development of those
plugins will happen out of QGIS source tree so no need for use to
worry about compile time tests I think.

Agreed we should have this. Even if the plugin loads on older versions
subtle changes / bug fixes may prevent it producing results as
expected.

This should be a thing of the past with QGIS and its stable api.QGIS
should be backwards compatible for all 1.x plugins but newer plugins
may specify requiring e.g. QGIS 1.1 if it has had things added to its
API.

Not providing a stable API till this point, allthough inconvenient for
plugin writers, was a conscious decision on our part so that we did
not need to be held accountable for an API that was not sustainable
for a reasonable length of time. In the long run I believe this was a
good decision.

Tim

Hi Mauricio

Its always good to give explicit directions on how to get your plugins
otherwise many folks wont know what to do to test your latest goodies!

If we wait till sunday coming will that give you and Borys sufficient
time to get your changes in? Otherwise I suggest we call a feature
freeze with exception of plugin installer and Grass stuff? Personally
I prefer the formwer option as the community team will have less
confusion about which parts of the ui are now documentable which
arent.

I fixed the bug. In the 0.11.0 package I needed to rename libqgispython.dll 
to qgispython.dll to let the plugins work... so I did the same thing this 
morning... but this time it was different :-(
So I left the dll with its original name, and now I have both the plugins in 
the menu. Good... but there's another problem: the mapserver export plugin 
seems to work fine, while the plugin installer gives me an error (reported 
also on an ubuntu machine, same error):

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:/Users/Marco/Documents/Quantum GIS/Binary 
Package/QGIS-Dev-Package/./python/plugins\plugin_installer\installer_plugin.py", 
line 46, in run

Previously i was getting the error

No module named PyQt4.QtCore and PyQt4.QtGui

But after installing the PyQt inside the site package it is not
showing any error now.


Now i have started getting the error,
qgis. core module not found.
qgis.gui module not found.

I have done whatever way possible from my side.

My system environment is as follows:

OS -- Windows 2000
Python 2.5
PyQt 4.4.3.1
QGIS 0.11.0.2

I dont know in which step i should be installing these one after other.
and also where to install and how to compile

It will be very kind of you if you can help me out.

Bye

AFAIK, at the moment nobody is working on it. It would be great to implement 
SVG line styles before 1.0 release, but I don't think it's feasible...

The only one thing I need is a few methods for the menu and the manager. 
Am I get down to this today or is somebody working on it already? Tom? 

I also would like to discuss if we open the new repository for rewritten 
plugins with partial moderation (not more then an administrator delegated to 
correct mistaken metadata). Or even two repositories as we spoke some time 
ago.

The arrow is good, but it's really hard to tell that's a plug. What 
about using the icon from the plugin manager, maybe rotated with the 
green arrow over it?

OK. I'll try, even if I don't really like that icon very much (the plugin 
manager, I mean).

I do have the following scenario:

Within a data capturing project I want to reduce the number of visible
objects for a single digitizing person. This person only should see the
objects digitized by himself in a defined area. At the beginning of the
digitizing work, of course, no objects are belonging to this person. As
the result I'm not able to define an according query due to the
limitation "QGIS needs in minimum 1 Object to work". 

Is this limitation mandatory?

Hi Marco,
I'm still hesitating, where to put the Installer. If in the Plugin menu, next 
to the Manager, then both icons should be harmonised. The second option is to 
take it from the menu and launch only from the Manager Window (with a 
button). In this case your big arrow is good ;) 

Certainly the Installer will disapear from the toolboxes (unless anybody find 
it useful there).

I think there is no such limitation as you can add empty table just
fine.  The message only appears if you try to filter, therefore I
removed it in r9253.  Please let me know if this causes any problems.

Hi, I'm attepmtping to apply your suggestion but I'm not familiar with proxy 
matter and can't find any server available for me and working with QGIS. 

Some time ago I found one and the Installer worked fine, but maybe it wasn't a 
caching proxy. Could somebody recommend me any?

too... (though still with nice icons in the menu).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin Menu  Reorganization
Message-ID: <48BF0AF8.1090400@comcast.net>

I propose renaming the Python Plugin Installer menu item to "Fetch 
Plugins..." The work it does is primarily to download plugins and an 
extra activation step is still necessary to complete the installation. I 
think 'Fetch' and 'Manage' are clearer than 'Install' and 'Manage.'

I propose ordering the Plugin menu as follows:

Python Console (only if python is available)
Fetch Plugins... (only if this plugin is loaded)
Manage Plugins...
-separator- (only if plugin list has at least one item)
sorted plugin list

An alternate layout which more closely matches what we have today is:

Fetch Plugins... (only if this plugin is loaded)
Manage Plugins...
-separator- (only if plugin list has at least one item)
sorted plugin list
-separator- (only if python is available)
Python Console (only if python is available)

Putting the Python Console first calls attention to it. Is it frequently 
used or do most users just run plugins and not use Python?

I also propose that "Fetch Plugins..." be enabled on the first run of 
QGIS so that a new user is immediately aware that remote plugins are 
available and can be easily fetched.

Previously i was getting the error

No module named PyQt4.QtCore and PyQt4.QtGui

But after installing the PyQt inside the site package it is not
showing any error now.


Now i have started getting the error,
qgis. core module not found.
qgis.gui module not found.

I have done whatever way possible from my side.

My system environment is as follows:

OS -- Windows 2000
Python 2.5
PyQt 4.4.3.1
QGIS 0.11.0.2

I dont know in which step i should be installing these one after other.
and also where to install and how to compile

It will be very kind of you if you can help me out.

Bye
Sonai

Try adding the path to the python directory within your QGIS install to your
PYTHONPATH environment variable.  Something like:

 

PYTHONPATH=C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages;C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS
0_11_0\python

 

The other option is to copy the qgis dir from the python folder in your QGIS
install into site-packages manually. but I prefer setting the PYTHONPATH.

 

Once you think you have things set up you can just try to launch a cmd shell
and test the import:

 

C:\Users\Xxxx>python

Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Feb 21 2008, 13:11:45) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)]
on win32

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> from qgis.core import *

 

Hope that helps.

Previously i was getting the error 

No module named PyQt4.QtCore and PyQt4.QtGui 

But after installing the PyQt inside the site package it is not 
showing any error now. 


Now i have started getting the error, 
qgis. core module not found. 
qgis.gui module not found. 

I have done whatever way possible from my side. 

My system environment is as follows: 

OS -- Windows 2000 
Python 2.5 
PyQt 4.4.3.1 
QGIS 0.11.0.2 

I dont know in which step i should be installing these one after other. 
and also where to install and how to compile 

It will be very kind of you if you can help me out. 

Bye 
Sonai

The Quantum GIS package for windows comes with all the files (QT and Python) 
needed to execute the python plugins, but if you want to develop new python 
applications within QGIS you probablly would need more libraries than the 
ones bundled in the current distributed package. This said, if you installed 
Python on your windows machine you should not need anything else, because 
python itself set its python environmental variable during the install 
procedure. If you're encountering some errors with Python, that may be 
generated by different problems that would need to be more accurately 
investigated. You'r referring to a "Tim's tutorial", what exactly?

Regards,

Marco Pasetti

It's getting more complicated :) The new Installer is able to install, update 
and uninstall the python plugins. I'm also trying to drop the extra step you 
mention, so plugins will be enabled during the installation.

So we will have the situation that the "Installer" manages the repositories 
and allows to instal/upgrade/downgrade/uninstall all python plugins 
(installed and not) and the Manager allows to enable/disable all (python and 
C++) installed plugins. It's getting a bit messy.

For that reason I prefer to take the Installer out of the menu and launch with 
button inside the Managger window. I'm trying to implement it before monday.

I prefer the second layout. Python console is used rather only by plugin 
developers occasionally to test the API or so. For users that don't write 
plugins, it's completely useless I think. So the last position is less messy.

Will be done!

Just add the QGIS install dir to your system path to get rid of the DLL
errors.

This layout has been implemented. The menu can now have any number of 
items above and below the separators.

The plugin insertion rule used by QgisApp::addPluginToMenu is to look 
for the bottom separator. If it exists, the sorted plugin list is placed 
above it. If it doesn't exist, the list is placed at the bottom of the menu.

Accessors for all menus, toolbars and actions have been added to 
QgisInterface so plugins can add actions anywhere.

In C++, this will add an action above the "Manage Plugins..." action:

QgisApp::instance()->pluginMenu()->insertAction(
   QgisApp::instance()->actionManagePlugins(), newAction );

Message-ID: <1220617673.48c125c989d37@mail.studenti.uninsubria.it>


Hello all,

Summer of Code has finished, and I still not figure it. It has been a great
experience, my first job as programmer that made this summer a very special one.

The plugin I' ve developed makes available inside QGIS [0] some home range
estimators, just like Animal Movement extension does in ESRI ArcView [1]. But it
does not conceal algorithms and their implementation: all code is available to
users. The core of the plugin is a script that calls R [2] and executes analysis
with given parameters. The functions are contained in R additional package
adehabitat. The user doesn't interact directly with R, except for package
installation and update. Analysis is run completely via QGIS GUI.

This was my first GSoC. It started as a bet, I didn't expect to be accepted, as
I'm a student in natural sciences who likes playing with the code.
When I read that my application had been accepted, I couldn't believe it!
Soon I began working on the project, and the beginning has been tough. When I
got used of the tools, things went considerably better. I found weekly reports
very useful, as I learnt to set small objectives that I could reach in few days.

All summer has been hard work to get the plugin walk on its own legs
(translitterated from Italian...), and it's not finished: the project is open to
improvements.
Keep an eye on the wiki page of the plugin [3] for updates, and also AniMove
site [4] for other open source solutions for animal movement analysis.

I want to thank first my mentor, Timothy H. Keitt; then, Damiano Preatoni, that
gave me precious advices and hosted the code on his SVN server; all QGIS
developers for their help, especially Barry Rowlingson and Carson Farmer; Google
staff for efficiency (we were more than 1120 this year! and they gave us a gift
book!); many, many thanks.

Hope to participate again to SoC next year!

best regards,

Anne

Message-ID: <48C13B36.1010802@gmx.de>

Hello!

I had some problems to find instructions for this qgis-developer list, 
since it has moved to osgeo and
http://lists.qgis.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/
is the outdated one.

Anyway, I just followed the instructions on
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingFromSource#head-8e1e1ff25b5e9f587393e0592c0ff34891ec07cc
and found, that cmake is not installed. Maybe there are some other 
necessary packages I already have installed, which could be mentioned 
(e.g. build-essential)? FYI, I am on debian 'lenny'.

I have attached two little additions/corrections for the wiki 
('BuildingFromSource', 'DevelopersManual').

Where is your python script? I suggest you to put it into F:\Quantum 
GIS\python\plugins

The Python and PyQt libraries bundled within qgis 0.11.0-x are: Python 2.5.2 
and PyQt 4.4.2
Different Python and PyQt version installed libraries may cause errors if 
the python script is launched outside the qgis tree (dir and subdirs)

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] My introduction and 1st question
Message-ID: <48C18A64.5000203@gmx.de>

Hello,

I'm Stefan. I recently downloaded qgis to see if I could use it for my 
needs. I think it is, but there's still something missing that I need. 
Ok, I just might not have found it yet, but anyway I considered it a 
good idea to have a look at the source code to see if I should spend 
some time to make this or that modification. Until then I worked on my 
own Java application for importing and exporting tracks, waypoints and 
routes to and from my eTrex (in fact it does a lot more, I'd feel little 
sad to give it all up).

I checked out qgis with "svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgis 
qgis" and configured it successfully. "Making" the current state is yet 
not possible, because of an error:

/home/stefan/cprg/workspace/qgis/src/core/qgsgeometry.cpp: In member 
function ?int QgsGeometry::splitLinearGeometry(GEOSGeom_t*, 
QList<QgsGeometry*>&)?:

make[1]: *** [src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/all] Fehler 2
make: *** [all] Fehler 2

For those of you who can't read the german error messages: It says that 
GEOSLength and GEOSArea aren't defined in the scope.

I tried to grep those symbols in the *.h files of the qgis directory but 
couldn't find it. Maybe you can help me with that one. Or does it happen 
that the current trunk is not compilable?

By the way, I try to do the development in an eclipse ganymede 
environment. Perhaps the one or other has an idea about that.


Best regards

Stefan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster-Properties colormap-bug
Message-ID: <200809061007.21264.stephan.holl@intevation.de>

Dear devs,

while updating the manual I tried all the new raster-features and I found some 
quirks.

You can reproduce by doing the following steps:
1) load landcover.tif from alaska samledataset
2) open properties
3) select single band gray rendering on symbology tab
4) select colormap
5) go to colormap-tab
6) press add-entry
7) double-click on the value-column and enter (any) value, press return when
    ready
8) double-cklick on the color-column (color-chooser comes up), select any
    color and click OK
9) you can write text in the color-column, which seems to be a bug.

Thanks for fixing.

	Stephan

Is this the first line? Or are there some before, e.g. could not find
somefile.h?

Have you installed (recent version of) libgeos-dev? On my debian there are:

ii  libgeos-3.0.0                        3.0.0-5
Geometry engine for Geographic Information Systems - C+
ii  libgeos-c1                           3.0.0-5
Geometry engine for Geographic Information Systems - C
ii  libgeos-dev                          3.0.0-5
Geometry engine for GIS - Development files

To get english messages you can use
LANG=C make

You can also have a look, if the ccmake found the correct
GEOS_INCLUDE_DIR etc., try geos-config --cflags

Good luck,

Hi,

I'd like to access large part of the raster dataset to build scattergram 
from two raster layers.

Is there any mean to access raster data from python plugins more 
efficiently than with the QgsRasterLayer::identify method ?

A version of identify that return a single band would be interesting too.

Finally what do you thing of a public access to mGDALDataset ?

Cheers,
Ghislain
P.S. new on the list. Aims at enhancing qgis for the analysis of remote 
sensing images.

It's the geos version. I used a 2.2.1 (the version on a gentoo system by 
default for amd64 cpus). I upgraded to 3.0.0, now it works.

Thank you very much.

Meanwhile I don't have much hope to use eclipse, it crashes reproducably.

Ok I will delay feature freeze till tuesday morning (9 Sept) at which
point I think it would be good to commit such functionality as you
have. We can always improve on it in future releases and time is
getting really tight for an end of sept release deadling.

Hi,

Following the idea in my last email. I propose a function getValue in 
QgsRatserLayer before API freezing. More efficient than identify to 
retrieve value (return double instead of string) in a single band.

The same kind of function to return a piece of raster would be 
interesting too.

Regards,
Ghislain






double QgsRasterLayer::getValue(const QgsPoint& point, int iband)
{
   double x = point.x();
   double y = point.y();

   QgsDebugMsg( QString::number( x ) + ", " + QString::number( y ) );

   if ( x < mLayerExtent.xMin() || x > mLayerExtent.xMax() || y < 
mLayerExtent.yMin() || y > mLayerExtent.yMax() )
   {
     return nan();
   }
   else
   {
     /* Calculate the row / column where the point falls */
     double xres = ( mLayerExtent.xMax() - mLayerExtent.xMin() ) / 
mRasterXDim;
     double yres = ( mLayerExtent.yMax() - mLayerExtent.yMin() ) / 
mRasterYDim;

     // Offset, not the cell index -> flor
     int col = ( int ) floor(( x - mLayerExtent.xMin() ) / xres );
     int row = ( int ) floor(( mLayerExtent.yMax() - y ) / yres );

     QgsDebugMsg( "row = " + QString::number( row ) + " col = " + 
QString::number( col ) );

     GDALRasterBandH gdalBand = GDALGetRasterBand( mGdalDataset, iband );
     GDALDataType type = GDALGetRasterDataType( gdalBand );
     int size = GDALGetDataTypeSize( type ) / 8;
     void *data = CPLMalloc( size );

     CPLErr err = GDALRasterIO( gdalBand, GF_Read, col, row, 1, 1,
			       data, 1, 1, type, 0, 0 );

     if ( err != CPLE_None )
       {
         QgsLogger::warning( "RaterIO error: " + QString( 
CPLGetLastErrorMsg() ) );
       }

     double value = readValue( data, type, 0 );
#ifdef QGISDEBUG
     QgsLogger::debug( "value", value, 1, __FILE__, __FUNCTION__, 
__LINE__ );
#endif
     if ( mValidNoDataValue && ( mNoDataValue == value || value != value ) )
       {
	return nan();
       }
     free( data );
     return value;
   }



} // void QgsRasterLayer::getValue

Hi all.
After a lazy period, relying on debian.gfoss.it to install qgis, I
recompiled from trunk. Tim, thanks for the instructions in INSTALL,
clear and easy! Just a suggestion: why not moving the linux section to
the top? I suspect it is the most used, and now it gets lost in all the
windows instructions.
It went much more smoothly than I was used to, but I encountered a few
issues:

- the grass plugin starts, but when opening the toolbox, I get:
The config file (/grass/config/default.qgc) not found.
the file is both in the src dir, in the original
/usr/share/qgis/grass/config/default.qgc (I still have 0.11 installed as
root), and where I installed the app:
/home/paolo/Desktop/qgis/share/qgis/grass/config, so what?

- Python plugins are missing, yet it starts with
./qgis
Python support ENABLED :-)
Loading python plugins
Plugin loading completed

- Error reading database file from:
 /resources/srs.db
Because of this the projection selector will not work...

- North arrow image not found

Any hints?
Thanks a lot, and all the best.

The error still remains, I tried withthe possible ways but same error.

Marco one thing do i need to get PyQT and python installed if i am having
recent Quantum GIS installer.

If yes then in which order i need to get them installed.
If no, then how to run the python script.
Do i need to do any change in the configuration files.

Thanks in advance.

Thanks Tim for getting me corrected.

I found the tutorial on your blog, so i thought so. Anyway Thanks to all the
members for creating a software.

Bye and take care

Are you working with the trunk or a precompiled binary version (0.11 or 
< )? Now paletted images, like the alaska tif, should open as 
SingleBandGray  with Colormap on initial load.

This should be all taken care of now ( r9284 ) Additionally, it will 
sort the table and reload on apply so that any invalid value entries 
(characters) will be cleared and set to 0.0 and float to the top of the 
table.

Do you have the -dev packages installed?  If so, you need to remove them
first, otherwise the fresh build will pickup the old header files.

BTW you can also build debian packages by running 

	dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b

OK, thanks for the info.
I am trying to compile r9284, but it fails with the following error:

Howdy Ghislain,
Welcome to the list and thanks for posting your questions.

At this time QGIS solely relies on GDAL but there has been some 
discussion about looking into the possibility to have other raster 
providers later on down the road (long way down the road). One major 
consideration is minimizing dependencies in the core. As for providing a 
public access to the GDAL dataset itself, it has been collectively 
decided that that would not be a good idea. You can in theory, access it 
(outside of QGIS) by getting calling QgsMapLayer::source() and opening 
the dataset yourself, but that is not an appropriate solution for QGIS 
and I am not promoting that idea.

QgsRasterLayer::identify() is the only method available at this time for 
getting pixel values. Your proposed method of getting a value from one 
band is possible, but still has too much overhead to make it useful for 
things like building scattergrams.

The more appropriate approach would be to ask for "stats" in a QgsRect 
or NxM window centered on a QgsPoint, which could include a scatterplot 
or compress maxtrix of frequency values as a return option. This would 
also pave the way for convolution filters and other functions. But these 
methods would need to be smart about asking for data and not just asking 
for a single pixel or small (3x3) window at a time. Rather these methods 
would/should load whole rows of data (below and possible above the 
window requested) and keep them in memory with the assumption that 
another request for neighboring data will be requested, in addition to 
being smart about preloading rows if it seems that a process is 
systematically asking for subsequent data. This, however, will not make 
it into v1.0 before the feature freeze but could (and should be) added 
somewhere in v1.x.

Additionally,
void QgsRasterLayer::idenitify(const QgsPoint&, QMap<Qstirng, QString>&)
and the Proposed
void double QgsRasterLayer::getValue(const QgsPoint&, int)

Should really be something more like
bool QgsRasterLayer::getValueAtCoordinates(const QgsPoint&, 
QMap<Qstirng, QString>&)
bool QgsRasterLayer::getValueAtCoordinates(const QgsPoint&, int&)
Which would open up other possibilities like (just to name a few),
bool QgsRasterLayer::getValueAtCoordinates(const QList<QgsPoint>&, 
QMap<QgsPoint, int>&)
bool QgsRasterLayer::getValueAtCoordinates(const QgsRect&, int, 
QMap<double, int>&)
Get pixel frequencies in QgsRect for band X and return a list or map 
<pixelvalue, frequency>
which would be great because it would also allow contrast enhancements 
to be defined based on the current data being displayed in the view 
port, but just all the data in the band.

So given the limited utility in the getValue function, I am hesitant to 
just drop it in, unless the other devs agree with move to 
getValueAtCoordinates() approach, then (as their current names are) 
getValue() can be added and identify() could simply call getValue() for 
each band. -- To make life easier identify() can can say in the API 
(marked as depreciated and slated for removal in 2.x ) and just be a 
wrapper for the getValueAtCoordinte().

Keep the ideas and sample code coming!

Cheers
-pete

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Installer update - more repositories needed! ;)
Message-ID: <200809090233.56427.borys@wolf.most.org.pl>

Hi lists,
I've just updated the Installer in my repo. There are major changes below.

1. It's compatible with both 0.x and 1.x QGIS now.

2. By default, it uses the main repository. User can click the "add 3rd party 
repositories" button and after accepting warning message, he gets more 
repositories.

3. The Installer uses DIFFERENT repositories for QGIS 0.x and 1.x. The 
alternative solution was to mix old and new plugins in one repository and 
determine the min/max qgis version in metadata. I've chosen the former, as 
it's much more reliable and clear I think. 

4. Only repositories compatible with currently used QGIS version are used. If 
one repository has two "instances" (containing old-api plugins and new-api 
plugins), always the matching one is choosen by correcting the QSettings. If 
one repository (saved in QSettings) is mismatching and has no 
proper "analog", it's disabled (but automatically enabled after publishing 
the analog). So upgrading from 0.11 to 1.0 will automatically change the used 
repository list.

5. At the moment, our "official" repository is enabled in both QGIS 0.x and 
1.x, my repository has two instances [1][2], while Barry's, Carson's and 
Paolo's repositories are enabled in QGIS 0.x and disabled in 1.x 
It will be great if every repository would be provided in two instances.

I hope I'm undestandable and Installer's behaviour is clear.

Regards,
B.

PS. I've renamed menu item and window titles from "QGIS Plugin Installer" 
to "QGIS Python Plugin Installer". It's related to the earlier 
discussion "Python plugins and C++ plugins: using different terms".

Thanks a lot Jurgen! Installing as root (with debs) solved all.
Perhaps this should be documented in the INSTALL file?
All the best.

We should probably also consider making these template functions so
that we can cater for the different gdal data types (float grids, int
grids etc) without implementing them multiple times for each type.

I'm inclined to agree that it would be worth waiting for a subsequent
release so we can think it out properly rather than squeezing it into
this release (I'm about to send out a code freeze announcement tonight
anyway). Also it would be good to think about providing some basic
interpolator options so that we can e.g. get the mean of the local 3x3
window at the given point, or weight the return value if it is not at
the centroid of the cell based on neighbouring cell values.

Regards

Tim

Hi Borys

I installed your plugin installer - I discovered that I needed to
restart QGIS before it appeared, after which it is working great! Are
you happy for us to replace the one in QGIS source tree now with it?
As soon as we get your plugin into the source tree we can start
feature freeze. Are you able to provide a patch for QGIS that
incorporates your plugin? If not could a pythonista out there help
with this?

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,
The Installer is waiting for you. Could you put it to the svn please? 
I've just uploaded few cosmetic changes, so use the latest version:
http://www.bwj.aster.net.pl/qgis/plugin_installer.zip 

> Are you able to provide a patch for QGIS that

The last pending issue is the necessity for enabling plugins in Manager after 
install and also necessity for restarting QGIS after plugin upgrade. I hope 
there are only two small python bindings to make but I'll get down to them 
tomorrow afternoon. And you know, it may take me one hour or many more.
If someone more fluent in C++ and SIP would like to help me, it should take 
less time. 

So can we put the new installer now and call for the freeze with this one 
exception? In the worst case, the patch is not necessary, it's just for user 
comfort.

Regards,
B.

PS. I've decided to keep the menu item and don't merge it with the Manager. 
Finally, it looks more clearly for me. So no Manager UI changes are planned.

Hi all,

I am newbie in this open source environment.
I am facing problem while importing qgis.core and qgis.gui.
I think the step by step process i am following is wrong. Please guide me if
i am wrong.

Step 1.  I am installing python 2.5.
step2.   i am installing PyQT 4.4.3
Step 3. i am installing qgis installer "QGIS-0.11.0-2-Setup.exe"

that is all and no other step.
Do i need to do anything else apart from this.

I want to develop a customized application with the help of Quantum GIS and
python.

Please help me out.

as I told you in the previous e-mails, you should carefully read the 
tutorial!
summarizing:

1. download the tutorial package: 
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/tutorials.tar.gz
2. untar it to a temporary directory c:\temp (or wherever you want)
3. open a windows terminal (cmd)
4. change to the directory where you placed the tutorial files (cd c:\temp)
5. set the environmental variables as explained in the tutorial;

if you installed qgis into C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS, as suggested by the 
installer, type

set PATH=C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS;%PATH%
set PYTHONPATH=C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS\python

6. launch the desired tutorial file:

python mainwindow.py

That's all,

Marco

Hi Marco,

Thank you very much for your reply. But it is not working.
I followed the exact steps that you suggested.

In the cmd screen i get following error
The error i get is    "    'python' is not recognized as an internal or
external command, operable program or batch file."

I tried to set the path through mycomputer->properties->advance option.
It is being displayed in the variable but after setting the pythonpath
variable when i try to start python idle i get the error that the python dll
not found and all the values in the path variables are displayed, and python
is not getting started.

And when i cleared all the values needed for python and quantum GIS from the
environment variable and used the command set as suggested by you from cmd,
then again the same error "python is not recognised ........". and when i
checked through mycomputer->properties->advance option, i found no values
are set.

What should i do?
Please suggest me.


the screen shots of the cmd prompt is as follows:



*C:\Documents and Settings\Bishwarup>d:*

*D:\>cd BTC*

*D:\BTC>cd Test_qgis*

*D:\BTC\Test_Qgis>cd tutorial*

*D:\BTC\Test_Qgis\Tutorial>cd tutorials*

*D:\BTC\Test_Qgis\Tutorial\tutorials>cd 2_basic_main_window*

*D:\BTC\Test_Qgis\Tutorial\tutorials\2_basic_main_window>set path=C:\Program
Files\Quantum Gis;%PATH%*

*D:\BTC\Test_Qgis\Tutorial\tutorials\2_basic_main_window>set
pythonpath=C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS\python*

*D:\BTC\Test_Qgis\Tutorial\tutorials\2_basic_main_window>python
mainwindow.py
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.*
What should i do now?


Thank you in advance.

Bishwarup,

>In the cmd screen i get following error

>external command, operable program or batch file."

this is because the python directory has not been set in the path variable

>I tried to set the path through mycomputer->properties->advance option.

NO! I didn't say to edit that variable using mycomputer->properties->advance 
option,!
I said, instead, to open a cmd session ad set the path var typing set 
path=...
if you edited the path variable through the advanced options window, 
overwriting the existing values instead of adding new values, you could have 
lost the previous settings, and that's probably why the python commands are 
now not found.

>And when i cleared all the values needed for python and quantum GIS from

Thtat's normal (and right, too).
when you type set PATH=..., the settings are stored only for the currently 
opened cmd session; if you close that session the new sets are not saved
that's a a safe way to edit temporary environmental variables without 
"touching" the general ones stored by the system (and permanently edited by 
the advanced options window)

>What should i do?

restore the values previously set in the PATH environmental variable using 
the mycomputer->properties->advance option window (do not set the pythonpath 
var there; if present delete it)
check that the PATH var in "mycomputer->properties->advance options" 
contains the python path (the installation path, not the qgis/python path)
"exactly" (!!) follow the instructions detailed in the previous e-mail

Message-ID: <d368056f0809101346s45f307e6u1fe2bf15cebd3f83@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Many thanks to all who have contributed new features for the 1.0
release. I have merged in the new plugin installer from Borys now and
would like to start with feature freeze. Chances of getting version
1.0 out in time for FOSS4G2008 are looking slim , especially if we
want to get much polishing & translation etc done. I am in favour of
pushing the schedule to get it out for end of Sept anyway and then
following up with a 1.0.1 bugfix release shortly after (e.g. end Oct /
Mid nov). Could I ask you please to top post your votes:

+1 - lets push to get QGIS 1.0 out for 25 Sept
0 - dont care either way
-1 - slow down tonto, lets rather take our time


I will be working my way down the checklist at
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist1.0 and encourage those
who have tasks assigned there to refresh your memories. If there is a
general concensus to +1 above I will adjust the checklist dates to
account for the short release  - and if there isnt I will put more
conservative dates into the checklist tomorrow evening.

Release team, now is a good time to start assembling a super duper set
of publicity material for QGIS!

Community team the user interface should now be stable and I would not
expect to see any further changes unless it is absolutely needed to
fix a show stopper bug (unlikely I hope).

Best regards to all,

+1

Work as much as possible to wrap things up.
Revisit the release decision in two weeks.
Have demos and publicity material at FOSS4G2008.
Take advantage of those not attending to do some more work.
If things look good immediately before the conference,
announce it will be available for download by time attendees get home.

FOSS4G2008 is a nice, but artificial, target. I would personally rather 
see a stable app with a good initial API, even it it takes a tad bit 
little longer than desired. QGIS won't have any better rep if is 
released for FOSS4G2008 but limps along, rather than being strong and 
released after the conference.

Nonetheless, I would also like to extend a thanks everyone who has 
submitted bugs and ideas and would like to encourage more people to get 
involved - we need more coders!

Hi all.
I admit is more psychology than code, but I think letting out a
seriously buggy QGIS calling it 1.0 will not leave a good impression on
users. I think critical bugs should be addressed first.
On the other hand, missing the FOSS4G target would also not be a good thing.
How about releasing anyway for FOSS4G, calling it 1.0beta? Sounds pretty
googlish.
All the best, and many thanks to all!

Hi!

The same for me here - 1.0 should be pretty stable. But presenting it at  
FOSSG4 is also very important
So I't vote for a 1.0b1 or an 1.0rc1 so that everyone sees it's near 1.0  
but not finished already.

regards
Werner

Hi all,

-1

I also like the idea of having a beta or rc that we may recommend to power 
users. For the 'normal' users, it may be better to fix some more bugs and 
therefore I think it will be good to release 1.0 a bit later.

Regards,
Marco

Hi, 

-1 

I would also prefer to have a release candidate at foss4g. With all the new
features, we should take a little more time to get a stable 1.0 released.

Hi all,

as non-developer, if developers prefer take time for a stable 1.0:

I agree with Paolo about a beta/rc release at FOSS4G, rather than a 1.0 carrying
too much bugs for working purposes.

Dear QGIS gui translators, 

now that feature freeze has begun, we would like to encourage all of you, who
are involved in qgis gui translation to update and send your *.ts files to
Werner Macho <werner.macho at gmail.com> or me <otto.dassau at gmx.de>.

There will be a time slot for about one week from today to commit your
translations and it will end definitely, when Tim creates a 1.0 branch in
svn. So, if you would like to have and use a completely translated QGIS 1.0
GUI, you should do it within the next days :-).

If you have questions about the procedure or need help, please write a mail to
us or the qgis-community-team list:

User perspective, so take with a grain of salt.

I think the rc or beta approach for FOSS4G2008 is the right approach.  
Not really different than the 1.0 to 1.0.1 release schedule, but saves  
the hit that the qgis dev team will take for putting out a 1.0 that is  
quite buggy. A rc or beta can be buggy without tarnishing the quality  
of project.

Regards,
John

Hi All

It looks like waiting is the general preference. Personally I think if
we are going to wait for 1.0 final and do an interim release, that we
should release it as 1.0alpha so that we dont imply the API is final.
There may still be parts of the API that can be cleaned up and I would
also appreciate the chance to give it another revision before we hold
ourselves to it for a long time into the future.

If folks are happy to have the release as alpha rather than beta, I
would propose that the gui freeze remain in effect to give the doc
folks a chance to get the manual updated.

In order to have an alpha or beta ready for end of this month, I may
skip some steps in the release checklist - in particular I propose we
dont advertise the alpha / beta release widely.

We could set a new proposed release date for QGIS 1.0 for end Oct?

Regards

Tim

Hi all,

Is it possible to access the classes derived from QgsMapTool 
(QgsMeasureTool, QgsIndentifyTool, ...) from python plugins ?
I guess no since there is no .sip files for these classes.
Is it the right way to re-develop our own maptool children ?

Sounds very good to me, even though having 1.0 clean and
critical-bugs-free by the end of October seems an ambitious task, but
time will tell.
All the best.

I would prefer 1.0RC1. 1.0alpha sounds that QGIS is in a very early
stage of developement. But this is not the reality. Wide parts of QGIS
are matured and there are a lots of bugs which are identified and will
be fixed in the next weeks.

It's a pitty, that most of the plugin installer strings weren't included to 
the translation files. Only the .ui files was included, whereas 80 strings 
are located in the the rest of .py files and won't be translated.

Do we really need that hurry? I understand that we want to release the 1.x in 
the end, but can't we do it a bit more carefully?

Can I please get a copy of the Quantum GIS installer script (NSIS) for
review? I really like that way it handles and would love to learn from
it. I love that way it downloads the sample data.

Hi,

I have posted the first version of Scattergram plugin (requires QGis 1.0 
and Qwt5).
The calculation is reasonably fast although it uses 
QpsRasterLayer::identify to retrieve the values. Retrieving 1 million 
values takes about 5-10 seconds. The interface is not frozen because the 
retrieval is done step by step using a QTimer based threading-like approach.

See also ValueTool posted about one week ago.

 Everything should be in the SVN repo... Have a look here:

https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgis/win_build/

 - there be nsis files!

Hi Ghislain,

The plugin causes a lot of errors (I think in every step). I've catch two 
kinds of them. If there is no layer present:

in scattergramwidget.py, line 196, in getLayerAndBand: 
ilayer,iband=self.comboArray[index]
indexError: list index out of range

And if there is a layer opened:

in scattergramplot.py, line 98, in serData
self.zoomer.setZoomBase(True)
TypeError: argument1 of QwtPlotZoomer.setZoomBase() has an invalid type

My Qwt5-qt4 version is 5.0.1-2, QGIS is fresh from trunk.

Hi

Even better we should probably just go with Preview 1 which doesnt
imply too much about  the alpha / beta / api frozen state and is
consistent with previous releases. I agree with your sentiment about
not calling it alpha.

Hi Barry

Marco has committed his locally modified nsis files yet - if you look
at https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/qgis/win_build you will
see its still there original NSIS stuff I did in there.

Marco can you put your current win build stuff into SVN when you have a moment?

Thanks!

Thanks Borys for your help. I have fixed the bugs and updated the file 
name and version number (for valuetool and scattergram) to fit the new 
requirement of the installer.

Yes, sure. I'm extremely busy in these days, so I'll probably commit only 
the files without the related documentation (that will be committed sometime 
later).
It's a very bad period for me, I'm finishing my thesis and I'm very strict 
in times.....
On late November I'll start my PhD, so I'll hopefully have more time to 
spend on OpenSource projects.
I'll do my best ;-)

Job Done!
I uploaded all the needed files (included the documentation) into a new 
ms-windows folder in trunk.
I also going to remove the old win_build folder, no more useful.
If someone does not agree with that remove action let me know. I'll give you 
some minutes more.

If someone does not agree with that remove action let me know. I'll give you

Then, just a few note: I didn't modified the previous nsis files, but I 
actually re-designed and wrote all the packaging stuff, including the 
procedure, scripts and resources needed to create (simply and in few steps) 
a self-contained QGIS package along with its automated installer. That's not 
usual, actually; in fact, it's usually better to modify the existing files, 
thus continuing the work done by previous developers, but, in this specific 
case, it was necessary, due to a completely new packaging procedure, that 
wanted completely new files; specially the NSIS installer script, that has 
been redisigned, manually edited (no wizards), and commented as best as 
possible.

Cheers,

Marco

I would prefer the last option, mainly because it wouldn't take effects 
neither on the windows installer, nor on the other possible ones.

I did following change now at http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/data/

- qgis_sample_data.tar.gz -> 20080329_qgis_sample_data.tar.gz 
  (according to the last modified date on the server)
- qgis_data_2008_09_15.tar.gz -> latest_qgis_sample_data.tar.gz

If we update the dataset again, I would propose to rename the
latest_qgis_sample_data.tar.gz to 20080915_qgis_sample_data.tar.gz (again
according to the last modified date on the server) and name the updated dataset
always latest_qgis_sample_data.tar.gz. 

This would need once a small change in the windows and probably mac installer,
but then it would be clear, which version people should download. Hope this

that's fine for me. But there's a small problem though. To avoid continuos 
changes in the installer script, every time the data set is updated, it 
would be better for me if the unpacked name of the folder would be the same 
of the tar.gz file . Could you do that change?

ok, I renamed the unpacked folder to latest_qgis_sample_data for now. But I
think we should wait and see what Tara thinks about it, before we make the
change fix, because she created and manages the new dataset, so she should
decide.

I added the Spearfish and NorthCarolina data sets because QGIS for Windows 
includes GRASS as standard, and they may be useful for QGIS/GRASS users.
This said, since they are GRASS specific, I would not care about them if not 
included in the user guide... there's the GRASS guide for that :)

I'm in stand-by for the job. Just let me know what to do ;)

OK, I guess we will hear about it if there are any side-effects of this 
change.
The new sample dataset does have GRASS data in it, as well as a number 
of formats that were not represented in the old dataset.
The idea is to have all the data share a common location (Alaska) so we 
can combine them for examples such as demonstrating on-the-fly 
projection and such.

Documentation writers- if you need a kind of data for user guide 
examples that is not present in the dataset, please let us know. Now 
that we have a procedure, it is easy to  add additional files into the 
archive.

fixed in trunk at rev 9340 (http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/9340)
I needed to modify the size properties of the new dataset, because the 
script (unfortunately) cannot read by itself neither the size of the tar.gz 
file nor the size of the unpacked folder.

Message-ID: <20080917120103.352e6ab1@nature>

Hi, 

I have 2 problems with a current svn QGIS build on ubuntu/debian:  

a) when I start the GRASS toolbox it says: 
the config file /grass/config/default.qgs not found, although it is there at
/usr/local/share/qgis/grass/config/default.qgs

b) when I want to search for a projection in the CRS Dialog it says:
Error reading database file from /resources/srs.db, but is there at
/usr/local/share/qgis/resources/srs.db

Do I have to define another path somewhere during configuration? For my
configuration I use alomost the same CMAKE options as written in debian/rules:

-Wno-dev \
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
-D CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=TRUE \
-D GRASS_PREFIX=/usr/local/grass-6.3.1svn \
-D BINDINGS_GLOBAL_INSTALL=TRUE \
-D PEDANTIC=TRUE

thanks a lot

Hi Otto,

I had the same problem recently and it turned out that, besides the current 
version,  there was a 0.11 version of libqgis_core.so on my system. So it 
seemed that the linker sometimes took the wrong one. Removing the old library 
version and recompiling solved the issue for me.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python-Plugin-Installer doesn't work
Message-ID: <48D0DE91.9050104@online.de>

Hi,
I'm using a recent QGIS version from svn (trunk). No problems with
compiling but the activation of python plugin installer fails with message:


Couldn't load plugin plugin_installer due to an error ...
...
File
"/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/plugin_installer/installer_data.py",
line 172, in load settings.setValue(self.knownRepos[0][0]+"/url",
QVariant(self.knownRepos[0][self.QGISver+1]))
AttributeError: knownRepos


It seems that self.knownRepos doesn't exist, but there is a global
variable "knownRepos" in this file. So I renamed self.knownRepos to
knownRepos and everything works fine.

Maybe somebody can fix this in svn?

Thanks! The updated version (0.06.2) is available in my repository.
Could anybody (Tim?) put it to the svn? 
http://www.bwj.aster.net.pl/qgis/plugin_installer.zip

Btw. there are some old files in svn, so I suggest to remove all files from 
python/plugins/plugin_installer directory and unpack only the zip file above.

Thanks a lot Marco. After cleaning up everything works fine!

Message-ID: <48D2520C.9000106@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
The availability of the promising osm plugin by Martin Dobias through
our repo faunalia.it/qgis/plugins.xml prompted more testing and error
reports:
An error has occured while executing Python code:

Any suggestion?
All the best.

Hi Folks

For QGIS 1.0 preview 1 we will not do a full release cycle.  On Monday
22 September I will :

- create a branch for QGIS 1.0 preview 1
- update the splash and version no to reflect its a preview 1
- call for packaging

I would suggest not to put packages into mainstream repos, but rather
offer them via our download site for manual installation so that folks
who prefer to use the current official release dont get upgraded
automatically.

>From then we will plan a new timeline for getting 1.0 final out.

Regards

Tim

The current "packaging procedure" I developed already provides a development 
package/installer, that does not take effects on the eventually installed 
stable version of QGIS.
That means that the setup file installs QGIS in a separate folder, with 
separate desktop and start launch incons (marked by the "dev" suffix), with 
independent registry keys and with an independent uninstall procedure. The 
installer provides the same features of its "stable brother", that means 
that it can provide upgrade, downgrade and repair installations, so that, 
when a new dev/preview release is done (such as a weekly snapshot), the 
installer performs an upgrade over the previously installed development 
version.
The only common resources used by both are the .qgis directory in the user's 
folder and the registry keys that manage the toolbar and window size 
parameters (I cannot separate them, because they are directly managed by the 
application).

For more information read here: 
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/qgis/ms-windows/QGIS-Installer.nsi

Tara has already tested a "development" installer. She could comment and 
give her judge on that.

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Crash Loading Python Plugins Using Qt 4.4.2
Message-ID: <48D3D159.1090108@comcast.net>

QGIS Python Developers,

After upgrading to Qt 4.4.2, I crash when loading a Python plugin.

The message is:
QPixmap: Must construct a QApplication before a QPaintDevice

An abbreviated version (details below) of the crash path is:

QgisApp::loadPythonPlugin >
QgsPythonUtilsImpl::runStringUnsafe >
PyQt > QPixmap constructor

I don't know if a change is required in all QGIS Python plugins or 
whether there is an incompatibility between Qt 4.4.2 and PyQt.

Tom

The fix for this is to relink PyQt. After doing so, PyQt works with Qt 
4.4.2 but now crashes with Qt 4.4.1!

In the past, I don't recall relinking PyQt when I upgraded Qt.

Hi Folks

I have tagged QGIS Kore preview 1 which you can get by doing:

svn export https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/tags/Release-1_0_0-preview1

The purpose of the tag is to make preview packages against a known
version of QGIS. If you are a packager please do not replace QGIS
0.11.0 in any repositories you manage, but rather create a separate
standalone package. You can send me the URL of any packages you create
and I will put a them onto the QGIS download site. Please do not
commit anything against the tag, its just a marker and not intended to
become  a branch.

We will give out the URLS to kore preview1 at FOSS4G2008 next week for
the adventurous who might like to give it a whirl.

Best regards

Thanks Tim!
I noticed that after branching a few useful commits have been made,
including important bugfixing. I think it is important to apply them to
both trunk and preview, to have proper testing. Of course this does not
apply to new features.
All the best.

For those who may be as confused as I was:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kore_(moon)

While it's certainly not the most critical item to address for the
grand 1.0 release, Kore sure doesn't sound like a very "grand" moon!
It's one of Jupiter's smallest; in fact, I can't even find a photo of
it online!

Has Quantum GIS already used up all the good moons?

Hi Paolo

I prefer not to do that since packagers wont be building against a
fixed target then (which is the whole point of tagging). We can make
additional preview builds (e.g. at monthly intervals) as and when
needed if the general feeling is more bug fixing is required before
releasing.

Tim

Yup

Well its the last moon (with an intelligible name anyway) as you
depart from Jupiter. For the next release series we will use moons
from a different planet. Also kore is punny in that 1.0 presents a
core, stable api that will be with us through the 1.x release series.

Yup - hence the lack of a splash screen piccie of it....

Lastly its probably better being a small moon with a strong sense of
self identity than a big moon that is overly influenced by your
neighbouring planet. So there is no need to use MacDonalds 'bigger is
better' type assesment when if comes to moon quality...ok I'm waffling
now :-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] finally, libecw with qgis in windows
Message-ID: <BAY110-W1006911FAEC5195117DC6BB24A0@phx.gbl>

Hi:

After a few time trying different options to get libecwj library working
in mingw, I decided to start a port of the library. There are good news
about the port, actually the library compiles correctly using pthreads
and dev-cpp as ide for debugging. I have succesfully compiled in debug
mode and release mode I have also compiled gdal with the library and
used it in qgis to load ecw images.

The port is an early stage and still have some problems, the one more
visible is that it takes to qgis like 2 minutes to load an ecw image of about
100 mb but once it is loaded it works ok.

Please tell me if someone is interested in debuging the library to get it
working with qgis.

the source patched and the binaries could be downloaded from:

http://sprat.sytes.net/libecwandbinaries.zip

To use it uncompress the zip file.

If you want to check it with qgis copy the content of gdal,
dependencies and debug to qgis root directory.

If you want to build the library and debug it, download
dev-cpp from here http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html

uncompress libecw.zip into c:/msys/src/

there is a dev-cpp project in C:\msys\src\libecwj\Source\C\NCSEcw\NCSEcw
its name is ecewj2.dev just open it and build it.

Pthreads libraries and includes must be in /local/include and /local/lib of your msys.

There are to make files to be used with the project :

Makefilelibecwj2_mingw32win_debug
Makefilelibecwj2_mingw32win

To change them you have to go to project menu - project options - files
and choose the appropiate makefile in use custom makefile option.

Hope this can help, and also that we can have ecw support for windows
version of qgis  shortly.

Regards

Godofredo Contreras

OK. I'm building it right now. Where can I put the file? As usual, I can put 
it temporary into the web and give you the related URL, but you'll need to 
download it and then put it somewhere else.
How can we do with that problem? is there a way to let me access "stable" 
qgis server spaces?

Marco

I think it would be very good to have a repo of packages; also
experimental ones could be useful.

Hi All,

I was wondering whether a vector file or more specifically an
individual feature can be rotated according to a specified angle in Quantum
GIS.
I tried searching for an answer but found nothing.
If it is possible then how?
Thanks in advance.

Bye and take care

Just a reminder that there is functionality in place to upgrade old

serialization of internal data, should take a quick look in 
qgsprojectfiletransform.cpp. It is easy to install new transformations.

Paolo, 
I notice this problem from time to time and I'm nearly sure it's caused by one 
of the python plugins. Unfortunately I didn't find which one yet.

Also, I can change the colour of the frame, but not that of the

The background is there, and it is shown on the svg or png output: it's

Borys and Paolo,

I also just updated  QgsRasterLayer::identify() to return a boolean. If 
the provider key is wms then it should do nothing and will return false, 
otherwise it will build the result string(s) and return true. It would 
be good if you could try again with revision 9414 and see if it still 
crashes -- the plugin may indeed still need to be updated.

There are several other methods that should first check to make sure the 
provider is not wms.

thanks for this. Will do ASAP, probably on Monday.
All the best.

Paolo,
Actually just deactivating is not enough to get the plugin to stop until 
you restart QIS. So I am sure it is still that plugin that is causing 
the problem.

However, with my recent changes to QgsRasterLayer::identify(), plugin 
does need to be updated.
my hack looked something like this (note it is just four lines at the 
beginning that are actually different...

Starting on line 114 of valuewidget.py
        for layer in rasterlayers:
            identifyResults = layer.identify(mapPos)
            isValid = identifyResults[0]
            ident = identifyResults[1]
            if isValid:
                layername=str(layer.name())
                iband=1
                for j in ident:  # loop over the bands
                    layernamewithband=layername
                    if len(ident)>1:
                        layernamewithband+=' '+j

                    self.values.append((layernamewithband,ident[j]))

                    cstr=layer.getContrastEnhancement(iband)
                    self.ymin=min(self.ymin,cstr.getMinimumValue())
                    self.ymax=max(self.ymax,cstr.getMaximumValue())
                    iband+=1

        self.printInTable()
        self.plot()

A bit of a minor problem with Qt 4.4 on OSX, that I haven't seen with  
previous versions of Qt: when embedding the Qt frameworks, I reset the  
install_names of the interlinked Qt frameworks to relative paths (Tom  
does this with his also).

Now with Qt 4.4, this finds the Qt plugins in /Developer/Applications/ 
Qt/plugins, if they are installed (I don't include the Qt plugins in  
my package).  These plugins still have their install_names set to find  
the installed Qt frameworks, which then causes confusion in the linker  
and Qgis crashes on startup with (the first few lines of the trace):

Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGBUS)
Exception Codes: KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE at 0x0000000000000010

Thread 0 Crashed:
0   libqtaccessiblewidgets.dylib  	0x157be6f7  
QAccessibleScrollBar::childCount() const + 17
1   QtGui                         	0x00eadbca  
QAccessible::updateAccessibility(QObject*, int, QAccessible::Event) +

2   QtGui                         	0x00a13054  
QWidgetPrivate::show_helper() + 420
...
...

This does not happen when the Qt frameworks are not embedded.   
Embedding the Qt plugins doesn't help, if they are still also in / 
Developer.


Is there some way for Qgis to force Qt to NOT load plugins from / 
Developer?  Otherwise I must put a warning in the readme about this,  
with a recommendation to move/delete the /Developer Qt plugins.

I put an empty qt.conf file in the bundle's Resources folder. This file 
can contain paths which override the compiled-in Qt paths. If this file 
is present, standard search paths are relative to this file rather than 
the Qt installation location.

Since I use the same tree as Qt for plugins (only 
imageformats/libqjpeg.dylib is needed), I don't need to put anything in 
the file but the file itself lets Qt know not to use installation locations.

This is documented at: http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qt-conf.html

Ah, that works.

I just copied libqjpeg.dylib to Contents/plugins/imageformats, and  
touched Contents/Resources/qt.conf.  Qgis now ignores /Developer Qt  
plugins (at least, it's not crashing now).

Hi,
I have now a corrected version of valuetool. Every plugins that use 
identify needs upgrade.

However, I have not uploaded the new version on the repository because 
the preview 1.0.0 version uses the former identify method...

How to deal with these different versions ?
Do we really need a repository for the HEAD, one for the last stable, 
and one for the to be released soon... Any idea ?

valuetool.zip for the HEAD is attached.

A new version of scattergram for the HEAD version.
It also includes a new feature: an area can be selected on the image and 
it is plotted with a distinct color on the scattergram.
Thanks in advance for testing.

Thanks for this.
For our repo, after consulting with Borys, we ended up having two repos,
one for 0.x and one for 1.x, see:
www.faunalia.it/qgis
I think this approach makes sense, and it's easy.
All the best.

Message-ID: <48E07E93.9010002@cnam.fr>

Dear all,
I compiled QGIS from trunck and got a problem with Grass tools.
When I launch the Grass Tools dialog and choose a command, say v.in.ogr 
for example, I got a small box on the upper left corner of the tab and 
I'm unable to access the different options needed by the command.
How to fix that ?
Regards

Hi

Thanks to all who have posted packages / package urls. I have put them
all on http://download.qgis.org

Gary could you take a look at the sorting? It would be nice to group
1.0preview 1 into its own section.

Many thanks

Regards

Tim

For the 0.11.0 release you can just put the instructions as 'yum install qgis' 
as the packages are in Fedora proper (support for Fedora 8, 9, 10 as well).

Hi Tim.
Does it make sense to keep also all the old version, starting from
0.9.1? Some of the instructions seem also outdated.
Why not leaving only:
- testing-> 1.0 preview1
- stable-> 0.11
- oldstable-> 0.10
?
Also, not being a mac user I find the duplication of osx packages
confusing: better warn the users on why they should choose one over the
other?
All the best.

Hello list,

Does anyone have a quick way of accessing z or m values 
(programatically) from vector layers in QGIS? I don't appear to be able 
to use them?

While I keep my OSX binaries on my site (mainly I'm just too lazy to  
clean up), I don't keep the links (old direct links will still work,  
unless I've 'cleaned up').  I generally have links to "stable" and any  
current development version.

I thought Tom was going to switch to using frameworks at some point,  
but maybe that was just the build instructions (which are framework  
based now).

I think the idea is that if the only thing you install is Qgis, use  
the all-in-one.  Otherwise if you install GRASS, Mapserver, and/or  
PostGIS (very likely my binaries, or built from source using my  
frameworks) you will have the frameworks anyways.

But yes, it's a bit unclear.
