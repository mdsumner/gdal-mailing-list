If it wasn't, QGIS would be GPL-2 only.

If you talk about auto-updateable views, you can track back the original table 
and check it for PK, as the PostgreSQL doc says :
"The view must have exactly one entry in its FROM list, which must be a table 
or another updatable view."
There could still be a problem though if the PK from the original table is not 
selected in the view. This could be checked too.

More generally, it would be great to be able to override this behaviour if the 
user provides a unique and not null column name.
There are cases when triggers, rules and other mechanisms would require this 
and are not easily automatically detectable.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 2.8 'Wien'
Message-ID: <20150302125450.GA11598@norbit.de>

QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System
that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.

We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 2.8 'Wien'.
Wien is German for 'Vienna' - host city to our developer meet up in November
2009 and again in March 2014.


Long Term Release

This is a special release since it is designated an 'LTR' (Long Term Release).
LTR releases will be supported with backported bug fixes for one year, and will
be in permanent feature freeze (i.e. no new features will be added, only bug
fixes and trivial updates).

The purpose of LTR releases is to provide a stable and less frequently changing
platform for enterprises and organisations that do not want to deal with
updating user skills, training materials etc. more than once per year. The
success of the LTR is very much down to you, our beloved users - we need your
support to help funding bug fixes and making sure in your support contracts
with support providers specify that any bug fixes done on your behalf are
applied to the LTR branch as well as our normal development branch.

If an LTR is important to you, please consider also directly supporting the
QGIS project, or encourage your commercial provider to use LTR as a basis for
your enterprise solution so that everyone may benefit from a stable platform
that is being continuously improved and refined. Note that for users and
organisations that like to live on the frontier, our regular four monthly
releases will continue unabated.


New Features

QGIS 2.8 is also a special release because it includes so many great new
features, tweaks and enhancements to make the most popular Free desktop GIS
even more feature filled and useful.  Visit the visual changelog that
highlights some of the new additions
(http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog28/index.html).

Whenever new features are added to software they introduce the possibility of
new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a
ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker (http://hub.qgis.org/).  Please consult the
existing and closed issues there before filing any new ones.

The source code and binaries for Windows, Debian and Ubuntu are already
available via the large download link on our home page (http://qgis.org/).
More packages will follow as soon as the package maintainers finish their work.
Please revisit the page if your platform is not available yet.


Thanks

We would like to thank the developers, documenters, testers and all the many
folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so).

From the QGIS community we hope you enjoy this release! If you wish to donate
time, money or otherwise get involved in making QGIS more awesome, please
wander along to http://qgis.org and lend a hand!

Finally we would like to thank our official sponsors for the invaluable
financial support they provide to this project:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] LTR
Message-ID: <20150302130039.GB20301@norbit.de>

Hi, 

I started to including the LTR release in the packaging/nightly builds.  I'm
going to change the plan/procedure a bit.   Both regular release and ltr will
be branched of master and continue to be called release-$major_$minor.  The LTR
additionally gets a ltr-$major_$minor tag.  release.pl is already changed that
way any release-2_8 has such a tag.

A cronjob will monitor release branches for changes and intiate a new point
release whenever there are two week silence after a new commit (or manually
when there was a very important fix).

The nightly builds will monitor master, latest release and ltr branch and
create nightly packages if there are changes (1+2+4), unless there was a
version change (ie. a point release) in which case regular packages will be
made (3+5).

For Windows there will be five different packages (1-5: qgis-dev, qgis-rel-dev,
qgis, qgis-ltr-dev, qgis-ltr) in OSGeo4W, for debian/ubuntu there will be five
different repositories (1-5: debian-nightly, debian-nightly-release, debian,
debian-lts-nightly, debian-lts).

4+5 are only made if the latest release and ltr branch are different.  Until
then latest release and ltr are identical anyway.  That also means ltr packages
only start four months after a ltr release happened and we maintain the ltr
branch four months as our regular and nine specifically as separate ltr
release.  That also implies that installing ltr packages means that you install
something that already has seen four months of maintainance.

An open question is what to do in the four month a new ltr is out.  While there
is no new regular release only regular packages are created and there are no
new ltr packages.  This might be negligible as the ltr branch will have been
maintained for a year as promised, but if you only install ltr packages there
will be a gap of four months without updates.  But I guess that can be left
open until we get there.

Thoughts?


J?rgen

is possible change the editwidget with pyqgis?

I have made an extension that loads a postgis layer and I want to edit the
date fields with the date widget by default without any change in the

 PyQGIS 2.4/2.6 on CentOS 6.6
Message-ID: <62DE033FEF5A8740AD4021902F26D3522E67B561@ICTSC-W-S204.soliscom.uu.nl>

Hi all,

I'm trying to use the Layer Tree API introduced in QGIS 2.4 in standalone scripts on CentOS 6.6. Unfortunately there don't seem to be any QGIS 2.4 or 2.6 packages for CentOS, so I attempted to build QGIS myself. I'm using the qt47* packages [2] from the ATRPM repository and built my own PyQt (4.9.1), SIP (4.16.6), and QScintilla (2.8.4). Making QGis 2.4 and 2.6 with GCC (4.4.7) gave errors about "no matching function call for ...", but this was fixed with a patch that someone posted [3]. Python version is 2.6.6.

So, now I have a fresh QGIS 2.6 running which seems to work fine. However, when I try to use a script to open a project file, add a layer, and save it again, a segmentation fault occurs when I call:

    QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layer,True)

This is even before trying to do anything with the Layer Tree API. Please refer to http://pastebin.com/5ksyDk4S for the test script so as to keep this message a bit brief. Using gdb python and then running the test script shows a little more info:

    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    0x00007ffff07d8eed in QMetaObject::cast(QObject*) const () from /usr/lib64/qt47/libQtCore.so.4

But grasping what's going on at this point is a bit beyond my understanding. The same happens with my QGIS 2.4 build. Anyone have any idea what could be causing this, or any other tips for getting QGIS up and running on CentOS 6?

Thanks so much for any help.

regards,
Koko

Hi,
on page http://www2.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#opensuse
there is mentioned versions for openSUSE 12.3 which is not true.
There is no support for 12.3. version anymore (not at all, which I 
suffer too ;) ). E.g. there is no such directory.

So I hope this could be corrected asap.

Thanks of this fine release again.

Message-ID: <CAJvUf_vy5S1jKYby31T-BP-DF_Yx9GigOevGvqWjjpnBTWCJZw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey dear Qgis list,

my question is related to network and plugin.

>From within our plugin <http://remi-c.github.io/interactive_map_tracking/>
we would like to display a User Guide
<https://github.com/Remi-C/interactive_map_tracking/wiki/%5BUser%5D-User-Guide-%28simplified%29>
.
This guide already exists on GitHub, and it would be good to directly
display the html fo the github page in the plugin.


Of course internet is not always accessible, so we have a local version of
html pages in the plugin directory.

SO there is 2 questions :
- Are we sure that using the `QWebView` to connect to internet will include
the QGIS proxy settings? (what is the best practice here?)
- How to check if it is possible to access an internet page, so that if it
is not possible to get the online version, we could fall back on the local
version?

Thanks for your time ,
Cheers,
R?mi-C

Hey Jurgen,

That sounds really good to me.  The auto release based on silence in the
branch sounds like a good idea.  Given that this is the first time we have
done this I think we will just need to iron out any issues as we find them,
hard to get things right on the first run.

Hi all.
Would someone be interested in porting (coding or financing it) PKTools
http://pktools.nongnu.org as a part of Processing? Some tools seem quite
interesting:

Hi,

I started to including the LTR release in the packaging/nightly builds.  I'm
going to change the plan/procedure a bit.   Both regular release and ltr will
be branched of master and continue to be called release-$major_$minor.  The LTR
additionally gets a ltr-$major_$minor tag.  release.pl<http://release.pl> is already changed that
way any release-2_8 has such a tag.

A cronjob will monitor release branches for changes and intiate a new point
release whenever there are two week silence after a new commit (or manually
when there was a very important fix).

The nightly builds will monitor master, latest release and ltr branch and
create nightly packages if there are changes (1+2+4), unless there was a
version change (ie. a point release) in which case regular packages will be
made (3+5).

For Windows there will be five different packages (1-5: qgis-dev, qgis-rel-dev,
qgis, qgis-ltr-dev, qgis-ltr) in OSGeo4W, for debian/ubuntu there will be five
different repositories (1-5: debian-nightly, debian-nightly-release, debian,
debian-lts-nightly, debian-lts).

4+5 are only made if the latest release and ltr branch are different.  Until
then latest release and ltr are identical anyway.  That also means ltr packages
only start four months after a ltr release happened and we maintain the ltr
branch four months as our regular and nine specifically as separate ltr
release.  That also implies that installing ltr packages means that you install
something that already has seen four months of maintainance.

An open question is what to do in the four month a new ltr is out.  While there
is no new regular release only regular packages are created and there are no
new ltr packages.  This might be negligible as the ltr branch will have been
maintained for a year as promised, but if you only install ltr packages there
will be a gap of four months without updates.  But I guess that can be left
open until we get there.

Thoughts?

Hi,

I've got the same error once, and the reason was that the DB wasn't
spatially enabled, that said I believe that a better message should
point the user to the right direction.

Otto: can you please file a ticket for this issue?

Message-ID: <CANeXY1F1W=z51zxo738SYp349CVq5sYoNUCw464dYV1cduRdHg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to have your opinion in order to simplify as much as possible
our current workflow.

We have a table parcel and a table operation. The table operation include a
foreign key to the table parcel. We have 2 parcels (A and B) but only
parcel A has operations link on it. I would like to merge the 2 parcels by
keeping the attributes of the parcel A. The merge is doing properly but
impossible to save the edit (Provider errors: PostGIS error while deleting
feature: ERROR: update or delete table "parcel" violates foreign key
constraint"fk_parcel" on table "operation"). I guess this is due to the
fact the Qgis first delete the 2 parcels (A and B) before creating a new
one (merged one).
This behaviour oblige us to export the table parcel into a shapefile and
make the modifications on it. Once done, we import the shapefile into
PostGIS and update the parcel geometry base on it.

Is there any chance to find an easier workflow, without developing a
plug-in ?

Thank for your help.

Best regards,
Thibaut.

How do you merge exactly?

You could use PostGIS trick, like droping the foreign key constraint, and
trusting QGIS, but it would be a poor idea.

Another option would be to create triggers to clean the merging done by
qgis, so no foreign key constraint is violated, but it would depend on what
is this merge exactly.

Are you talking about the
vector/geoprocessing tools/Dissolve ?

Hi,

the question is how you define your foreign key [1], namely what you put 
for "ON DELETE" (you have either NO ACTION or RESTRICT, which throw the 
error you receive) If you set ON DELETE CASCADE the operation would be 
deleted, too, probably not what you want. Maybe you should set ON DELETE 
SET NULL (make sure that the field can be NULL!). Afterwards you 
reconnect the operation and the new parcel.

Hi,

thanks for your help. 

the database was spatially enabled, but it was necessary to grant some
rights (create/usage) to the public schema. 

I believe that a better message should point the user to the right
direction. A added a ticket for that.

Thank you very much.
It seems that strangely enough,
using  `QWebView` automatically takes into account the qgis proxy settings.

For the check of connection, it was actually a lot more complicated that we
thought.
The complexity comes from the fact that all QT web querry are asynchronous.

We put a state machine to switch between local and online version when
there is/there is no connexion.

Many thanks for your help.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Custom Featur Form without Borders
Message-ID: <1425397572716-5191227.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello

I am working on a Plugin that still runs on QGIS 2.2 and now I am trying to
port it to QGIS 2.8. The Plugin has a touch optimized style and I remove
Dialog Borders of Custom Feature Forms. Currently I am using the following
Code to achieve that:

--------------------------------------------
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from PyQt4.Qt import Qt

def formOpen(dialog, layer, feature):
    return MyDialog(dialog, layer, feature)

class MyDialog(QDialog):
    def __init__(self, dialog, layer, feature):
        QDialog.__init__(self)
        dialog.setWindowFlags(Qt.Dialog | Qt.FramelessWindowHint)
        ...
--------------------------------------------

In QGIS 2.8 however this doesn't work anymore. This QDialog seems to get
embedded in another Window. Is there any possibility to set those Windows
Flags on the outer Window? Or is it possible to open a MyDialog Window in
Python myself when a Feature is clicked on the map?

Thank you very much.

Josh

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsVectorJoinInfo doesn't work in PyQGIS
Message-ID: <1425409603157-5191267.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
I think that QgsVectorJoinInfo doesn't work in PyQGIS,
I found a similar bug report http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11893 but it is in
status closed ,
thus before to open a ticket , 
I ask for help if is there something wrong here...

Tested in QGIS 2.6 - 2.8, Platform: Windows 7 , Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

I want to join programmatically a vector layer with a table.
I tried both with postgis layers that with shp/dbf and they works fine if
the join is made manually.
But from python the results is unsuccesfully.

Code snippet:

geomLayer = iface.mapCanvas().layers()[0]
geomLayer.id()
tableLayer = iface.activeLayer()
tableLayer.id()
geomFieldName = u'comune_ist'
tableFieldName = u'codice_ist'
joinInfo = QgsVectorJoinInfo()
joinInfo.joinLayerID = tableLayer.id()
joinInfo.joinFieldName = tableFieldName
joinInfo.targetFieldName = geomFieldName
joinInfo.memoryCache = True
joinOperator=geomLayer.addJoin(joinInfo)

>From Python Console it seems ok, the result of addJoin operator is "True",
but in the qgis project there is no join...
I'm sure that the id layers are corrects.

If I open the QGS Project in a texteditor, i can see that it doesn't store
joinLayerId:
<vectorjoins>
  <join joinFieldName="codice_ist" targetFieldName="comune_ist"
memoryCache="1" joinLayerId=""/>
</vectorjoins>


What is wrong?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
TIA

Hi all.
Shouldn't we adopt this change upstream?
All the best.

for feedback from Etienne, who was asked about this.

And the dxf2shp plugin is already fixed.

joinInfo.joinLayerID = tableLayer.id() 

must be

joinInfo.joinLayerId = tableLayer.id() 

Not sure why QGIS doesn't complain...

Hi all,
thanks Giovanni, Victor and Alex for the prompt fix, and the backport.
This kind of errors should be easy to spot with the automatic check
Victor developed some months ago. Would it be possible to include the
script in the suite of automatic tests? IMHO this would greatly improve
the predictability of Processing, that without it is always at risk.
Thanks.

Hi,

I do the merge interactively by selecting the 2 parcels and clicking on the
button "merge selected features" from the advanced digitizing toolbar. On
the "merge features attributes" window, I select the attributes of the
parcel A as attributes of the new/merged parcel. Like that the new/merged
parcel as the same primary key than the past parcel A.

Regarding the possibility to create triggers to clean the merge, I have to
think about it but seems a little bit complex given the number of tables
linked to parcel table (not only operation one) and also the fact that
during an editing session we can make multiple merge on the same time.

Regarding the type of foreign key, I have well "ON DELETE NO ACTION".
Defining the foreign key to "ON DELETE CASCADE" or "ON DELETE SET NULL" is
unfortunately not possible.

Best regards,
Thibaut.

Message-ID: <CAMMN2u0k7wYOe-kaB89Enwhdd23US0HZbF5J16Jb=C6W5nDEdA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
it seems that SAGA is not recognized by QGIS (2.8.1 and compiled master).
In the Processing options all the checkboxes are there, but nothing changes
in the toolbox.

I'm on a debian testing machine and SAGA version is 2.1.2 and I can
correctly use it as standalone.

It sounds weird, but I'm out of ideas..

Cheers

Matteo

Could it be the same issue encountered in OSGeo-Live?

"
For the SAGA issue: in Options->Providers, the user has to deselect the
2.0.8 compatibility check box.

Hi,

well, I tested and it is as you assumed: QGIS deletes both datasets and 
then issues an INSERT containing the new dataset. Therefore your foreign 
key constraint throws the error. I see two workarounds:
1) as proposed before: change the foreign key behaviour. If that is not 
possible
2) triggers might help you; possible outline:
a) preparation: add a field to operations and name it e.g. "was_parcel"
b) trigger 1, before delete:
  update operations set was_parcel = parcel_id, set parcel_id = NULL 
WHERE parcel_id = OLD.id (assuming parcel_id is the field with the 
foreign key constraint)
c) trigger 2, after insert:
  update operations set parcel_id = was_parcel, set parcel = NULL WHERE 
parcel = NEW.id

Subject: [Qgis-developer] git Web hooks. Was [Qgis-community-team] new
 procedures when working on the user manual
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_Ee7_pG20KhiNjQcfVCDQptPLOG705PcyChkqjxVqgStA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Developers,

At the community mailing list we were talking about using git hub issues to
manage the Documentation tasks.

One thing that would help alot was the posibility to use Git WebHooks to
auto create issues in the qgis/documentation repository when a commit
message has some especific text. The best example is the [FEATURE] "tag"
but other could be added, like changes to the interface [GUI].

Is there anyone with experience in using GitHub Webhooks?
https://developer.github.com/webhooks/

And of course with admin access to create this webhooks.

This would help alot to identify what needs to be updated in the
documentation.

Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

You can set it through the QgsMapCanvas.setRotation method:
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsMapCanvas.html#aede658d1a978b99cfeb05eef3d392caa
(which will set it through the QgsMapSettings class:

Message-ID: <2115265135.1077093.1425476127560.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,
I noticed that in QGIS server, if a layer has at least two joined layers, then QGIS server does not render properly (or not at all) that layer if filtering is done using one of the joined layers columns.
Everything works as it should in Desktop and with just one joined layer.Does anyone has a clue?
Thanks,Tudor

Message-ID: <20150304150653.1dde36ca@nature.speedport.ip>

Hi,

when I load a tif with worldfile and the 2nd and 3rd row (rotation terms) is
not 0, QGIS is not able to put the layer to the right position. Is this a
know behavior? How can it be fixed?

With this tfw file the layer is not shown at the correct position:

0.317133539233554
-0.012952088380440
-0.012952088380440
-0.317133539233554
386370.45256274
5674529.73223443

With this tfw file the layer is shown at the correct position but the
rotation is missing.

0.317136839634324
0.000000000000000
0.000000000000000

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bug with floating point gains
Message-ID: <CA+BxjXK5=VKBGsRFDMCTgHvOompgr3Cmb1bR=us7jriPv=WhDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I filed a bug report on this some weeks ago:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11573

But it hasn't gotten the required attention.    It's a rather egregious
bug, which currently is restricting us to QGIS v2.2, which is becoming more
of a problem the more outdated it gets.

In short, when using a floating point gain with integer images the datatype
is not promoted, so you end up with an image that is rounded to the nearest
integer.  It's fairly common practice to store indices, like NDVI, as an
Int16 with a gain of 0.0001 as it is half the space. But in QGIS, these
images end up being rounded to mostly 0.

The feature of auto-applying the gain is nice in practice, but without
promoting the data type of the output it is counter-productive.   It would
be good to either revert this feature or properly promote the datatype.

I'd be happy to do more digging and try fixing this and issue a PR if
someone could get me started by pointing me in the general direction of the
code responsible for this.

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS server (broken?) logging
Message-ID: <CAL5Q671Dt+To+bFUR6AqyDBkz_bqPy1RAPF=T5HC90upSvOF6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I feel I'm not the only one having an hard time to get proper logging
from QGIS server.

Maybe I've completely misunderstood how it's supposed to work but I've
spent quite a lot of time in different occasions trying log something
from the main FCGI loop without success. It seems that the only way it
works correctly is when the binary is invoked from the command line.

I cannot understand the reasons for some parts of the current
implementation, for example: can someone shed some light about the
purpose of the (unused) QgsServerLogger class? Why QgsMessageLog
doesn't work inside the FCGI loop (but works from the command line)?

I see that QgsServerLogger it's pretty recent but it's not used
anywhere (except to get the message level before entering the CGI
loop), I also don't get why despite having a similar interface (but
not identical: most methods are not static) it does not inherit from
QgsMessageLog.

I think that proper logging is mandatory for every server side
application and the standard behaviour would be to print messages in
the server error logs (maybe FCGI doesn't support that?), having a
configurable separate file it's a nice addition but a standard logging
mechanism is much more important.

Before I file a ticket, I would like some feedback: is it just me
using a wrong configuration (I believe I've tested all possible
combinations of env vars) or is it really broken?

Same problem if I export the layer to shp from DB Manager.
Did someone ever experienced this problem ?

I work on Windows 7 64 bits, with QGis 2.6.1 64 bits.

QgsMessageLog is a QgsDebugMsg wrapper emitting signal (most of them
intercepted by QGIS log message panel)

QgsDebugMsg (is a define on QgsLogger) write messages only if compiled in Debug

regards, Luigi Pirelli

p.s. avoiding debugging, you can create a new QGIS server plugin that
intercept QgsMessageLog signal to log them ;)

QgsMessageLog needs listeners to its signal.   This can be QgsMessageLogViewer
(like in desktop) or QgsMessageLogConsole.

It was changed in a3452a5 - before it didn't use signals (which broke when
threads were used) and would automatically log to the console when no logger
was registered.

Now you need to explicitly instantiate a QgsMessageLogConsole object and it'll
automatically connect to the signal and log to the console.

QgsDebugMsg is something else.  It's only included in debug builds (using
-DQGISDEBUG), in release builds it's a noop.

Hi,

I just tested with QGIS 2.6.1 and there it is working :(. If nobody has an
idea, I will file a ticket.

Hi Juergen,

Thank you  for the clarification, I've found the problem: there are
two different env vars:

QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE

and

QGIS_LOG_FILE

I probably messed up my configuration: sorry for the noise.

Hi Gino!

I can also use standard python logging appending to the qgis log file
and it works fine, anyway the problem is partially solved, you have to
use QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE env var instead of QGIS_LOG_FILE.

I'm still convinced that logging should be enabled by default and
should write to stderr and hence go into the web server error log but
I can live with a custom configurable file.

Hi QGIS team
I have been using QGIS for about 8 months now and I am loving it. Being a
regular user of QGIS, I wish to contribute to the development process. I
also wish to take part in GSOC '15 and do a kickass project for QGIS.

I am in my 3rd year of study, majoring in computer science from IIIT
Hyderabad. I am a research student of the Lab for Spatial Informatics. I am
familiar with C/C++, python, javascript and HTML/CSS  (Github
<https://github.com/ayk115>). I am well acquainted with the concepts of
spatial data, CRS, map generalization, spatial databases, querying etc.

I am done with the setup of QGIS. Any tips on how to start off?

Ayush, it would be great if you could start by enhancing the QGIS
testsuite, which is currently lacking coverage of many crucial aspects.

A good way into that would be to run "make check" and ensure it
succeeds on your system, then move on to picking one bugfix (ideally
among the ones recetnly fixed in the 2.8 branch) and ensure it has
a corresponding testcase, adding it if missing.

Speaking of spatial databases (for example) there's no automated testcase
involving interaction between QGIS and PostGIS. It would be a big step
forward to build a framework for that.

Hi all,

during migration and cleanup documentation-related tickets I found
that API documentation for QgsRasterLayer class contains misleading
information.

Description of the setDrawingStyle(theDrawingStyleQString) [0] method
contains note "May be deprecated in the future! Use
setDrawingStyle(DrawingStyle) instead." But there is no method with
such signature.

The problematic ElevenSword gradients needed to be excluded from the
Debian package, FTP master accepted QGIS 2.8.1 after the second
repacking that also excluded the gradients.

Next up, the very probable build failures on arm*.

Try master or the ltr-dev version. This should already be fixed.

Doesn't this approach mean that potentially there's never an automated
build (eg, if we get a commit to the LTR branch every < 14 days)?
Would a better approach be to also have a maximum time between
releases, eg after 2 weeks if no activity or after 3/4 weeks since
last LTR release (only if there's been changes, obviously)?

This should be fixed in master now - can you please test and confirm?
If so, I'll backport to 2.8.

No, that cronjob doesn't build anything anyway - it just initiates a point
release after some time of silence.  But of course it means that there is no
new point release, when there is continuous activity on the release branch.

But there is another job that does a nightly build of the release branch that
runs if there are changes on the release branch anyway.  The idea is that the
two weeks window is used by testers, who create bugreports if anything is
wrong, which causes developers to fix them and in turn commit something.  In
that scenario continuous activity means that there is still something wrong -
and that shouldn't be released.

Of course it implies that the nightly builds of the release branch are actually
tested by users, bugs are immediately reported and quickly fixed by the
developers.

Well, there might be parallel activity on multiple issues and ongoing activity
on one, might block the point release although the others might already be
fixed.  Not sure how likely that is.

But ideally the release branches should cool off after some time after it was
branched and only occasionally need fixes.

Hi,

Interesting.

The idea of fuzzing is to add random noise to inputs of a program in
order to make it crash and exhibit hard-to-test branches of code.
It is very well suited for programs that parse complex inputs.

For QGIS, the "inputs" are either project files or external data
sources, where it relies on third party libraries and where the inputs
are not always easy to represent as files (how to fuzz a postgis database ?)

So this may be interesting for testing project file parsing.
But I think it would be better suited for external libraries like GDAL.

Anyway, automatic tools are always good to try if they can improve the
overall quality.

Speaking about tests for external sources, it would be good to add (or
complete) unit tests for "direct" providers (spatialite, postgis, etc.),
probably as an option, since the setup is platform-dependent.

Inputs would also be user interactions.
It would be great to have a fuzzer playing the monkey role.
I bet a monkey would be able to find tens of crashers a day :)

For XML, you need dedicated fuzzing tool. afl (as far as I know) is more 
dedicated to binary fuzzing, which make 99.99999% of what it produces invalid 
XML that will be rejected by the XML decoding library before it reaches the 
application level.

> But I think it would be better suited for external libraries like GDAL.

Indeed, I've used it a bit recently in GDAL, mainly on the GTiff driver and it 
did finds things. Note that afl needs generally to run for several minutes/hours 
to be able to find things (unless the code is particularly not robust in which 
case a few seconds will be enough to trigger bugs)

You would have to park the monkey in a chroot/VM cage, because you don't
want it to open and corrupt your real files :)

Anyway, we already know there are still lots of tests to add :

	patch to test
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO44RrRC8tys4ngK+oYD115RAN4YWCM4shs-ma66MJJHRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I have opened an issue concerning pre-rendering server-side simplification
for Oracle provider:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12298

Please read and review the proposed patch. Please test it with Oracle data
in different environments.

This is really a first step and will need more work to be considerd as
usefull.

Here is on extracts of my last comment on the issue :


-------------------------8<-----------------------------

A patch attached with a first code runnning.

   - I copy/paste what has been done in PostGreSQL provider, but since
   there is no equivalent for the functions used there, I used instead :

   - SDO_UTIL.RECTIFY_GEOMETRY instead of ST_SnapToGrid , with the
   "tolerance" parameters used to snap to grid :
   http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/appdev.102/b14255/sdo_util.htm#BJEICGGA
   - SDO_UTIL.SIMPLIFY instead of ST_SimplifyPreserverTopology


   - I have tested it with only one POLYON layer, and got awkward results,
   which seems to be caused by simplification leading to POINT or LINSTRING
   instead of original geometry type. Perhaps the problems lies also in
   incorrect geometries in my dataset. If you have experience using Oracle
   spatial or locator, please help debug this issue


   - I kept the tolerance used for PostGIS :
   mRequest.simplifyMethod().tolerance() * 0.8 There is surely a room for
   improvement here


   - I do not know if the patch is suitable for both Oracle Locator and
   Oracle spatial

Please test the attached diff file and give feedback or advice

NB: This is the first time I work with Oracle. I invite Oracle
Locator/Spatial gurus to participate, since I am a complete newbie here

NB2: You can use the docker/oracle here to set up a test environment :
https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/alexeiled/docker-oracle-xe-11g/

In the new simplified dialo for snapping options, the Avoid

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to store a QIcon in QGIS project file?
Message-ID: <CANaz7mw4B3+HqL45JJp0bm+z5OE92suGJFAqHnA-u+F7PfgnLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'd like to add a "Set Group Icon..." action to the context menu for groups
in the layer tree. I'm preparing a pull request for that.

Everything is working fine, but I have a doubt on how to make the QGIS
project to store the QIcon (location), so that when the project is open
again, the QIcon can be constructed properly.

My first attempt was to store the QIcon path in the project, which works
fine when the icon is set through QGIS GUI. However, it wouldn't work for
PyQGIS users, who pass a QIcon object to the setIcon() method of
QgsLayerTreeGroup. Since QIcon does not store its image file path, it would
not be possible to access the path and store it in the project file. I
would have to force PyQGIS users to set the image file path via get/set
functions iconPath()-setIconPath(), which is not very elegant, but it's the
only solution I see.

Do you know any other solution for this problem? Perhaps something about
storing the QIcon somehow serialized?

Regards,

Germ?n Carrillo

Hello,

Maybe you can use a derived class, in python this would look like:

QIconWithPath(QIcon):
     def __init__(self,iconPath):
         super(QIconWithPath,self).__init__(iconPath)
         self.setIconPath(iconPath)

I'm not sure this is considered elegant...

Thanks Alain, that would imply creating a new class in the QGIS source
code, and, unless other parts of the code needed it, I think it woudn't be
welcomed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems while including .h files in QGIS code
Message-ID: <CANaz7myzcVi2LQLQX7bUiHC-9mF6LFiauppggFKweqHT7rkawA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'd like to let (PyQGIS) users choose between Table and Form View when
calling showAttributeTable() via QgisInterface. I'm preparing a pull
request for that.

However, I'm having a hard time with includes, since once I add #include
"qgsdualview.h" in my qgisInterface.h file, I get the following error:


*    .../QGIS/src/providers/delimitedtext/../../gui/qgisinterface.h:49:25:
fatal error: qgsdualview.h: No such file or directory #include
"qgsdualview.h"*
Of course, if I don't add such include, I get a "qgisinterface.h:296:57:
error: 'QgsDualView' has not been declared" error.

On the other hand, if I add the (../gui/attributetable) path to
CMakeLists.txt I start getting problems with the Interpolation plugin,
namely:

*
QGIS/src/plugins/interpolation/../../gui/attributetable/qgsdualview.h:21:32:
fatal error: ui_qgsdualviewbase.h: No such file or directory #include
"ui_qgsdualviewbase.h"*

Which I couldn't resolve.

I would avoid this problem by using a boolean value (bool formViewMode =
False)  as parameter of showAttributeTable() but I guess it's better and
clearer to use the QgsDualView::ViewMode enum, even if it's more complex to
implement.

The code I'm working on can be accessed in this branch [1].

What would be the correct way of dealing with such include?

Regards,

Germ?n

It's a visual guidance to navigate your layer tree. It could help you
differentiate, for example, between data authorities (see an example at
[1]). Additionally, as some user stated in GIS.SE, plugin authors would be
able to differentiate groups created by their plugins from other groups.

I by no means think it's indispensable, but would consider it nice to have.

Regards,

Germ?n

You can use Spatialite_gui,

P.S. you wrote directly to me not to the mailing list...


Thank you Roy for the bug report. Hope it will be corrected soon...
In the mean time, I am trying to find a workaround using ogr2ogr.
I had a look at the doc but didn't find a way to force column format 
conversion.
Can anybody ont me in the right direction ?

Lene,

I jsut filled one form here [1] but it seems too many location to register and 
other official website so I am not sure to get right:

* QGIS wiki: done
* https://www.etouches.com/ereg/index.php?eventid=117583&& and 
http://ign.ku.dk/english/outreach-publications/conferences-seminars/international-qgis-user-and-developer-conference/ : nothing done for 
me
* https://qgis2015.wordpress.com/ and [1] 
https://qgis2015.wordpress.com/87-2/: done

Do I need to register elsewhere?

Thanks,

Y.

Hi Yves,
All the roads leads to N?debo :-)
First we started to use the HUB,  (you have registered at HUB)  - "old" developers know that page - but for newcomers we have made a second entry at https://qgis2015.wordpress.com/87-2/ 

But, you can also register at the official page https://www.etouches.com/ereg/index.php?eventid=117583&& and at that page it is possible to donate a small amount to the accommodation/food.

Please update your arrival and departure information. There are still accommodation at the Forestry College.

Regards
Lene

Hi Roy,

Sorry for posting to your mail, I clicked the wrong button.

Thank you for the suggestion. It works.
However, I wonder why exporting through QSpatialite doesn't do the same 
job...

I am still looking for a straight forward solution I could integrate in 
au QGis python plugin.

Hi,

Is it possible to have multiple maintainers for a plugin on plugins.qgis.org?
I'd like to add a second developer to give her the possibility to release
without having to wait for me to make time for new versions.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Anita,


you should have access to the control panel and you can add owners from there..

But if you are the plugin maintainer you should also be able to add
owners from the front-end through the EDIT form (click on EDIT
button).

I started afrsh with --configpath, so this should not be the case.
Am I the only one to have this issue?
Thanks.

I haven't seen any other reports like this. Can you provide some more
details? Is this only on a certain project? Do you see it with a new,
blank project?

Message-ID: <CAJmGCaSR+r_8CjVK2A_PGOZ9Hmbc-6RKDYRva5usgMaEbEM=wQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
My name is Karolina and would like to work on issue
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5606
We deal with long numbers at work that are in fact 64 bits, and the default
behaviour casts them to floats when working with csvs, losing some
precision. I am motivated to add an option to force the data type of fields
when loading a layer as delimited text, but I am not sure how I can claim
the issue on hub.qgis.org.

Thanks

Hi Karolina,

for what I know, you first have to create a OSGEO account, to be able to
login in at various QGIS sites:

http://www2.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#bugs-features-and-issues

with that login you should be able to login at hub.qgis.org, edit the
issue, and then your name should be available in the dropdown (I think).

if not, please report back

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Karolina,

Do you already have an osgeo account?
If no, you need one.
When logged in, you can click "Update" at the bottom of the issue page
and there's an option "Assigned To".
If this does not appear for you (not sure, may be due to permissions),
just drop a message here and somebody can do it for you. Or write an
answer on the issue, that is probably enough already.

Thank you very much for tackling this anyway. If you have further
questions, don't hesitate to ask.

All the best
Matthias

Hi all.
I'm opening an old project, which takes a long time; from the console I
get several:

ERROR 6: EPSG PCS/GCS code 102091 not found in EPSG support files.  Is
this a valid EPSG coordinate system?

Howevere, I canot see that code in the project, and I started from a
clean config (--configpath pointing to an empty dir).
All layers appear in EPSG:3003.
So, where does the code come from?

All the best.

It's the list of user from the user table.

To be there, a user must log in at least once using his/her osgeo credentials.

try to rename your    .qgis2   folder (for example to ".qgis2_" ).

It seems there is a problem with files saved with old versions of QGIS,
inside that folder.

Message-ID: <96EAE7D042AAC14486D68EC70207B0C14AAD76D0@srsofaioi16255.verw.rootso.org>

Hi

I have a VRT with approx. 8000 raster files (each 2000 x 2000 pixel). The very first loading into QGIS takes "rather long" (perhaps 1 minute) on a fast machine (SSD, 3.4 GHz). Saving the project file and reopening again is fast. In debug mode I saw that some statistics/histogram is calculated the first time. 

But the main problem is when trying to access the layer properties. Even with a calculated histogram opening the layer properties dialog takes 1 minute again.

Did I miss some magic settings/options? Or does QGIS really needs to calculate some statistics on the first load and on opening the layer properties dialog every time?

I'm on master and Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit. "Create raster icon" is NOT checked :-)

Best regards
Stefan

Message-ID: <CAL5Q671_pE7FfjH1uzWM-1HwmVzmFOTQMAX6Vw-UjMdg6uTeag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm currently using an hidpi screen (about 280 dpi) and the GUI scales
quite well, I just have some problem with tiny cursor pointer when
identifying a vector layer.

Does anybody know if is there any setting for the cursor size or if it
isn't scalable at all.

I feel that with the incresing DPI of the upcoming monitors we have to
make sure that all the parts of the GUI scale well.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Simple sample code for function editor
Message-ID: <20150309151949.631f84eb@gbd1>

Hello all,
I'm writing a new chapter about the new function editor for the user
manual 2.8. I'm not confirmed with PYthon programmming.
See
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/field_calculator.html#function-editor-tab

Is there somebody who can give a short example of code for beginners?
I look for a code that shows the new possibilities of the function
editor in comparison to the Python console. On Nathan Woodrows blog
it is mentioned that it's a possibility to use full Python Code.

It would be great if the description includes an explanation of the
elements of the code.

Thanks!

Kind regards,
Larissa

Someone recently asked on gis.stackexchange.com how to put the Project
Title into a field in a Map Composer text label. So I wrote an answer:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/137933/how-to-insert-qgis-project-properties-project-title-as-field-or-token-using-an

 That's a fairly minimal example, it just uses one QGIS Python API
call to get the project title. I don't think you can get it into a
label in any other way.

 I'm sure someone can improve it to get rid of the dummy argument. I
should read the documentation...

Do the datasources have .qpj files with EPSG codes?

102091 is an ESRI definition (which is now in QGIS 2.8.1, but has no 
+towgs84 parameters), while 3003 is the same in EPSG notation with the 
correct datum shift.

I have written this blog post about using user defined functions. But it
might be a very specific case, and It's a kind of workaround.

Communicated policy was that any new patch-level release is cut
(automatically, I've understood) after 2 weeks of silence in the
stable branch:

REF:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2015-March/037043.html

Latest change was today:
https://github.com/qgis/qgis/commits/release-2_8

BTW, looking at the lits of commits in the 2.8 branch, there's one
that sounds suspicious: "TauDEM provider overhaul" [1]; does that
really belong in a stable branch ?

IMHO it is quite likely that in the first weeks there will be continuous
activity fixing the newly discovered bugs. The 2 weeks delay is fine on
the long term, but in the first period I would suggest a release based
on important fixes.

The provider was essentially broken, this has 0 chance of impacting
other stuff, so for me it's OK.
All the best.

If I add a scale to the Options, this is not sorted according to the

Is there an updated human-readable list of bugs fixed in the branch ?
It would be helpful to have such list always updated for each commit
so we can look at it quickly and judge the if any item warrants an
urgent release. A GET-encoded query to the bug tracker could also do,
if that's supported by HUB.

PS: commits are still coming in the stable branch, latest one 5 hours ago.

Message-ID: <CAMMN2u20MN=cspSkuoeFAprr4zUt+C25tV_y=fUgY1Sk_vwVbg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I have a filed made up by numeric values but recognized as text (should be
a WFS issue and not a QGIS problem).
I've used the 'toreal' function of the field calculator in order to update
the field but nothing changed (numbers are still read as text).
Strange is that if I create a new field using the 'toreal' function, values
are correctly read as numbers and not as text.

Am I missing something or can be a bug?

BTW: debian testing and QGIS 2.8.1

Cheers

hi,

If your field is recognized by QGIS as a string one, trying to overwrite
its values type will fail as they are intended to be string in THIS field.
This is why when you create a new numeric field and make conversion, it's
ok (this new field expect numeric values, so it'll recognize your
conversion).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] wrong feature count when subsetting a SL layer
Message-ID: <CAMMN2u22AuqwQ+rV-oYgaVuum=E22FtkowFfEQrC8MktUuEpCw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I've made a subset a SL layer not with DB Manager but with the default icon.
But when I check the `feature count` option of the layer the count refers
to the whole number of features and not of the subset.

Weird is that, when I use a symbology (graduated for example) the single
class count is correct while the general feature count is still wrong.

Am I missing something?

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Matteo,

Check if is this your case: https://hub.qgis.org/issues/12252

You must get a SAGA version >= 2.1.2:

supportedVersions = {
"2.1.2": ("2.1.2", SagaAlgorithm212),
"2.1.3": ("2.1.3", SagaAlgorithm213),
"2.1.4": ("2.1.3", SagaAlgorithm214),
# to allow testing upcoming release
"2.2.0": ("2.1.3", SagaAlgorithm214)
}


Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Destination field matters. While the destination field has numeric type, and values can of course be converted to numbers then conversion will succeed and values will be numerically typed.

Hi Junior,
thanks, get it. So numeric conversion are sinful only between numeric fields right?

Cheers

2015-03-10 18:25 GMT+01:00 Junior Delaz <delazj at gmail.com>:
hi,

If your field is recognized by QGIS as a string one, trying to overwrite its values type will fail as they are intended to be string in THIS field. This is why when you create a new numeric field and make conversion, it's ok (this new field expect numeric values, so it'll recognize your conversion).

2015-03-10 18:08 GMT+01:00 Matteo Ghetta <matteo.ghetta at gmail.com>:

Hi all,
I have a filed made up by numeric values but recognized as text (should be a WFS issue and not a QGIS problem).
I've used the 'toreal' function of the field calculator in order to update the field but nothing changed (numbers are still read as text).
Strange is that if I create a new field using the 'toreal' function, values are correctly read as numbers and not as text.

Am I missing something or can be a bug?

BTW: debian testing and QGIS 2.8.1

Cheers


Matteo

Yes. Now I tried again, and I'm no longer getting it.
I'll report it again if I find a way to replicate it.
Sorry for the noise.

Hi List,

we would like to display selected items in composer and pdf from a Python 
plug-in. In the QgsComposerMap.render() method the next line

jobMapSettings.setFlag( QgsMapSettings::DrawSelection, false );

disables to do that.

In bug report #11588 there was similar issue reported, closed and 
reopened.

Any idea, workaround?

Thanks,

Hi Zoltan,

Have a look at the answer here.
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12028

The composer does not render transient features. The Expressions+ plugin
with the isselected( layer ) method is the way to go.

Matthias

Hi,

 

I used QGIS 2.6.1

I have a crush when I used "QgisAppInterface::openFeatureForm(...) " that
called the function " QgsFeatureAction::editFeature(...)"

In this function: 

 

dialog->setAttribute( Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose );

int rv = dialog->exec();

mFeature.setAttributes( dialog->feature()->attributes() );  // here there is
a bug  because dialog is deleted  when I close the dialog

 

 

is there another alternative of QgisAppInterface::openFeatureForm(...) ?

 

 

Best regards,

Sarra  Sahbani

Hi Sarra,

You could use QgsAttributeDialog directly without using the iface. Does
that work for you?

	upgrade of Qgis standalone ?
Message-ID: <00ab01d05be6$f9c86550$ed592ff0$@asconit.com>

Hello,

 

I have 50 users with Qgis standalone from 1.8 to 2.6 ?  Windows XP to 7 - 32
/ 64 bits versions.

 

Tomorrow, I need to install for those 50 users + 50 new users the latest
version.  They don?t have the rights for install or uninstall the standalone
version of Qgis.

 

My first idea was for looking for the .MSI installer but  www.qgis.org
doesn?t have it. I didn?t view in the mailinglist anything related.

 

I know I can use the standalone with the argument /S but it?s not as clean
as a MSI.

 

Can you describe the best way to uninstall / install the latest version /
and upgrade easily ?

 

Should I use OSGEO with batch files ? How ? 

 

Thanks in advance J

Have a look at this article: 
http://www.qgis.nl/2014/04/22/qgis-in-de-klas-onder-windows/?lang=en

It describes how to use the --configpath qualifier to change the 
location of initialisation parameters from the registry to a specific 
directory and the location of plugins.

In short:

 1. Make a standard installation of the new qgis

 2. Make a directory alongside the "bin", "apps" and so on in the
    c:\"program files"\"qgis wien" directory. Call it "inidir"

 3. Edit the c:\"program files"\"qgis wien" \bin\qgis.bat to use the
    --configpath parameter like this:*/
    /
    //*//start "QGIS" /B
    "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\qgis-bin.exe//*//--configpath %~dp0..\inidir
    //*//%*//**

    (Second last line in the bat file)*/

    /*
 4. Save the edited qgis.bat as qgis2.bat in same directory as qgis.bat

 5. Start QGIS by doubleclicking on the qgis2.bat file. First time
    around QGIS wil blow up. Next time it will run fine.

You can then "install" the new QGIS by copying the  edited "QGIS wien" 
directory from the original pc to the root of the c-drive on a new pc,  
make a short-cut to qgis2.bat and place it on the desktop

I can't help you with the deinstall of the old qgis.

I forgot to write: If there is a non-core plugin, that every user must 
have installed, then install the plugin(s) before you distribute the 
qgis wien directory to the new pc's, and when qgis is started on the 
original pc with the qgis2.bat command. The plugin will then be 
installed in the ..indir directory and thus distributed with the rest of 
qgis.

There already is a nightly build of the release branch in OSGeo4W now (package
qgis-rel-dev since march 5th).

Thanks Juergen. I think a standalone installer would be important now,
however.
All the best.

Hi all.
Thanks for comments. Installing is not an issue for me (I'm on Debian),
but it's a PITA for Windozzers. Anyone willing to help adding the
package to osgeo4w? Why this was not necessary for previous versions?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

Not necessary for previous versions? :) Easy explained - because
previous versions did not use the python- exifread module?
I also see some changes between exifread 1.0 and 2.0 - so probably now
you need 2.0 and only 1.0 is included.

That's development.. always progress (luckily) ;)

regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python: how to call showItemOptions() in
	QgsComposer?
Message-ID: <CAMB2qw0VgptJ6TOkUQBuUA-se6qw8Z__ezr-tb0vx89JAaQyCw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I wrote a plugin that makes a custom Print Layout and then adds the
map element (QgsComposerMap object) with the pushAddRemoveCommand().

I would like to show the properties of the map element in the dock
automatically, but I see the "properties" of the <empty> layout
element, althrough the new element on history is selected.

The method  showItemOptions() cannot be used because it's not in the API.

I tried to emit the signal by hand in python:

  cMap = QgsComposerMap( ... )
  ...
  composerView.selectedItemChanged.emit ( cMap )
     (or)
  composition.selectedItemChanged.emit ( cMap )

the script doesn't give any error, but it has no effect.

It would be possible to add it, however it seems to me that such option
does not really belong to snapping options, because this option is only
used by few of the digitizing tools. (The same actually applies for
"topological editing" option that also just modifies behavior of some
digitizing tools.)

Maybe it would be better to find a better place for configuration of
editing tools? Maybe more "modes" will be added later. And it would be
useful to have some extra help with such options (especially to list which
tools actually support them).

Agreed. BTW, I still miss the meaning of the related Enable snapping on
intersection (I did several test, and could not spot any difference in
behaviour).
Maybe just renaming the dialog as "Editing options" and dividing the
dialog in two sections (snapping and other)?
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAFF9Zhv8pc5xoxVDo_WK8kZ8j==J=kVy7yqp5LzwKunSSYqd=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I noticed that   qgsAffine   plugin   appears under  "Layer"  menu, instead
of  "Vector".

I have an italian version of   2.8.1-Wien,  but I tested also setting in
English US language, and nothing changes.    Plugin version is 1.0.1

Moreover, switching off and on the plugin, it appears duplicated (or more)
in (Layer) menu.

Hi,

Why would you want to do that?

I guess the easiest thing is to remove it from src/providers/CMakeLists.txt

 and draw polygon in Composer?
Message-ID: <38497AD9CA059C42AA3451EFEFF0378ED7223E83@P2KITMBX04WC02.unicph.domain>

Hi

I have got questions from users - which I can?t answer :-O



Hopefully some of you can...



?        Is it possible to: Print/copy the canvas without Composer. Users need to insert the canvas in a mail or a document.



?        In the PrintComposer you can draw square, ellipse, ect - but can I draw a polygon?



Regards

If it's only a deployment thing: you can just remove all the
lib[xxx]provider.so files on the server (after compiling).

If it is current canvas state that you want to copy, you can use
"Project/Save as Image" to save the current canvas-view to a png/gif
whatever, which can then be copied into your email.

Myself use external tools to just grab a screenshot, which then can be
put on imgur, email whatever.

Use my favourite plugin from Boris:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/NewMemoryLayer/

activating this one, gives you a 'create new memory layer' in your Layer
menu, where you can then choose point/line/polygon and it will appear as
a layer into your map, and edit with the normal tools.
You can style it as every other layer.

There is another plugin to save the memory layer into the project file.

Hope this helps,

Regards,

Richard

Just to remind that that since 2.8, this feature is now core and was called
"add new scratch layer", and it's available in the Create
Shapefile/Spatialite Button.


There is another plugin to save the memory layer into the project file.

This one is not a core feature, but works fine with scratch Layers

Hi all,
I'm running QGIS 2.8.1 in Italian.
The Processing help files tabs are empty, no help is available:


Not Found
The requested URL
/2.8/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vector_general_tools/reprojectlayer.html

That's a pity after the job that has been done..

Hi
I just got a mail from a GIS administrator. She is a bit confused when I talk about 2.8 Wien. When she looks at QGIS.org and the download page ? it shows 2.6.
Can we change the Recache, so when a new version is launched the users get the new page too?

Just checked again.
There's also a dependency on spatialite from qgis_core. More particular,
offline editing makes use of it.

So you will need to introduce some CMake magic to skip this part when
compiling without spatialite.

Hi Richard and Alexandre,
Thanks ?
The scratch layer is wonderful ? but deleted when I close the project (that?s ?OK) so I can?t save drawings in the printcomposer.
And Save as Image ? forgot that ? I like the Clipping tool from windows ? and woul prefer a ?Copy to Clipboard?
Regards

Hi Lene,

we already did some work on that. Actually the download page:

http://www2.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html

has already 'special headers' telling it expires within one day:

Accept-Ranges	bytes
Cache-Control	max-age=86400
Connection	Keep-Alive
Content-Encoding	gzip
Content-Length	7782

Last-Modified	Mon, 02 Mar 2015 12:46:32 GMT

Are they maybe caching the pages theirselves?

Is there something else we can do? Caching guru's please chime in...

That means that the help files have dissapeared when moving to 2.8??
or that the URL is not correct (maybe some issue after the
internacionalization work that was done?)?

In qgisapp.cpp:

extern "C"
{
   #include <spatialite.h>
}

so, I think that sources should be modified, too...

Hi Victor/Matteo,

there is no /2.8/en/docs yet....

so latest stable/translated version is 2.6

I added a redirect, so now

http://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vector_general_tools/reprojectlayer.html

will bring you to

http://docs.qgis.org/2.6/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vector_general_tools/reprojectlayer.html

which is at least translated...

we can also link to testing/dev version...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Use the save memory layer plugin for that. It will save all your memory
layers in a file next to the qgis project

Hi Lene,

It 'costs' nothing as we do this for free :-)
But we do not have real sysadmins around, so we google and it just takes
time to sort/search/test...

I now added a line in the apache conf which for the frontpage now also
creates this Expires header:

Accept-Ranges	bytes
Cache-Control	max-age=86400

So I hope this is now better for your machines.

Thanks a lot Richard!
IFAICT, also grass help is taken from the web, right?
Wouldn't it be better to take it from local, since the file should be
installed in most or all systems?
Also, for gdal, why not pointing to its help, either online or local,
instead of (non) duplicating it?
All the best, and again thanks.

 meters, please help
Message-ID: <20150313225020.15587htgpkvjsfbw@webmail.uni-koeln.de>

Hello,

I am trying to develop a plugin for QGIS with C++, but my skills are  
that of a beginner.
So far I have managed to let the user select a point and make a buffer  
around this point, depending what value (in meters) the user chose, to  
select other points within this radius. Now I realised, the distance  
is false. With the measure tool I measured the distance between the  
points, but there are some points missing that should lie in this  
radius.
My guess is that I messed up the Crs? I am confused. Could someone help me?
The projects map units are meters. On the fly projection is enabled.  
The layer on which the plugin operates has the WGS 48 crs.

Sincerely,

Julia P.

Hi all,

My name is Nancy. I am a dual degree Computer Science student at IIIT-H and pursuing Masters in the field of Spatial Informatics.

I have been an avid user of QGIS for the past year as my interests lies in it.I would like to introduce to you this project idea for GSoC 2015, in which I am interested. 

The idea of the project is Pan Sharpening in QGIS.The main idea of pan sharpening is to combine registered high spatial resolution panchromatic (pan) and lower spatial resolution multispectral imagery to synthesize higher resolution multispectral imagery.The degree of misregistration between bands and the correlation of intensity values are key factors in generating radiometrically accurate and visually crisp output images. 

There are many algorithm for Pan Sharpening :- 
1>Projective
2>Multiplicative
3>High Pass Filter
4>Hue, Saturation, Intensity

But I would like to work on Projective method as it provides better results in terms of preserving the color of the multispectral image. The other algorithms all cause a color shift of one type or another from the original multispectral image. 

There are two components to the projective pan sharpening algorithm. The first component determines the linear radiometric relationship between the pan and multispectral bands and the second processes pixels to produce the sharpened product.

Benefit of this project will be that by increasing the spatial resolution of the high spectral resolution multispectral image,many other image processing tasks which are performed on the multispectral image are enhanced.We will be able get clear boundaries for clear extraction of features from the image and better vectorisation.

We have this functionality in GRASS and other softwares so we are trying to implement it in QGIS.

Hi all,
i have a problem with beginEditCommand and endEditCommand wrapping.
In my plugin i capture the layer.featureAdded signal :
self.layer.featureAdded.connect(self.myfunction)
 The scope of my function is to change attribute of the feature added according with some rules.
I wrap self.layer.changeAttributevalue between self.layer.beginEditCommand('My custom value') and self.layer.endEditCommand() but when i added a feature i can't see in Undo/redo window the label My custom value but my value is changed.
This cause a Qgis 2.8.2 crash when i try to rollback my changes.

P.S If i comment my change values function and i write the code in a python console i can see  my beginEditCommand label and no crash happend.

Anyone can help me?

Thanks

Francesco

Nancy,

We did see your 1st email message, I suspect the slow response is due to
the weekend and many people not having an opinion on the topic.

Looking around a little I would say the focus of the project should be
to get existing pansharpen tools into QGIS. Looking in the toolbox Orfeo
methods are already available. However i.pansharpen from GRASS does not
appear to be there. Also there's this great set of gdal scripts from
https://github.com/gina-alaska/dans-gdal-scripts that includes a
pansharpen (not sure which algorithms). Having all of these in the
Processing toolbox in QGIS would be really nice.

If you really want to work on additional algorithms not already in those
tools I would suggest you work with either the GDAL or GRASS projects
directly. Implementing in those tools leads to them being available in
QGIS and likely being more maintainable and useful as they can be then
also be scripted, which makes sense when you have huge amounts of images
to fix.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Francesco

Currently it is not safe to do calls that modify vector layer data in slots
connected to signals notifying about data change (such as featureAdded).
The issue is that at the point when those signals are emitted, their
underlying undo commands were not yet pushed onto the stack, so doing
further editing calls causes corruption of undo stack (undo command for
follow up operation is placed before the first operation).

As a workaround you could defer the change attribute operations - e.g. with
a QTimer. Not an elegant solution though...

Regards
Martin

IMHO it is better not duplicating existing functionalities: AFAIK the
OTB pan sharpening is working well, so better invest your time e.g.
improving Processing itself.

Hi Martin,
i try to implement a solution without QTimer patch.
Can you tell me if it could be work properly:

1- layer.undoStack().indexChanged.connect(self.undoStackChanged) -- get the signal from undo stack 
2-  layer.featureAdded.connect(self.setFeatureId) --get signal of feature added
3- def setFeatureId(self,feat_id):
       ##get the feature id added
        self.feat_id = feat_id
 4-  def undoStackChanged(self,id): ### check the command from undo stack (if it is a add feature command) . If it is a dd feature command run my added_Feature function (that i bound in my previous code with featureAdded signal) passing the feature id already added
        command = self.activeLayer.undoStack().command(id-1)
        if command and command.actionText() == 'add feature':

            self.handlelayerobject.added_Feature(self.feat_id)


I checked that feature added event is trigger before addind new command to undo stack. Is it true?
Do you think that is is a solution?


Thanks


Francesco

The logic is, start editing, do modification, stop editing is
intercepted to save EditingBuffer and then roolback all modification.
Then process editing buffer to create values basing on a rule and them
I can add/change the modified records with a new editing session
without user interaction.

I don't know if this can ba applied to your use case.

It would be so nice to be able to be able to register a trigger that is
executed to do this kind of things and data validation directly before
it enters the edit buffer.

Message-ID: <CAB28AshsNnepGbhdrWNCTiUDrkVf-myosX+638PJ_6byq6vaaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hoping someone can point me in the right direction - when using the
"offset curve" tool a little floating spin box shows the current
offset. It's handy to have this displayed, but there doesn't seem to
be any way to interact with this spin box (eg, to enter a specific
offset amount).

Why is this a spin box and not just a label? Or should it be
interactive and I'm hitting a bug which is preventing me from entering
values in this widget?

+1 for this

I was unaware of the reason for the crashes on Undo I was seeing until this thread. Our approach in Telemetry Layer was to simply end the edit session and commit the changes programmatically denying the possibility of a user undo.  A more elegant approach would be welcomed.

Just tried that - in my case the spin box gets keyboard focus, so I was
able to enter offset value (which must be followed by Enter). It seems that
all the time you need to keep the mouse at the same location (with left
button pressed) otherwise your value gets overwritten. So it's best to take
a deep breath beforehand :)

Hi Nyall

The spinbox should be interactive, the idea is to be able to enter 
numerical values. If it does not work anymore, it is a bug (a blocker).

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Open a project file programmatically
Message-ID: <CAExk7p3MZDJgK0wkTrLm2adNjGm2MRAK2xHBs83W7ACY_pgR0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

I'm trying to load a project file using python in a plugin, but am
encountering some problems.

I simply want to have exactly the same behavior as if the user was choosing
"open" from the project menu, and selecting one particular file.

The C++ QgisApp class has an void openProject(const QString &fileName)
method which I suspect to do what I want, but if I'm not mistaken, there's
no access to QgisApp through python.
The python QgisInterface class has no such method. It only has a reference
to the QAction triggering the open file dialog, but that's not helping.

So I'm using these lines :

        QgsProject.instance().clear()
        QgsProject.instance().setFileName('C:\mypath\myfile.qgs')
        QgsProject.instance().read()

It seems to work more or less.

But the behavior is not exactly the same :

- postgres layers for which I have a stored user/password in the browser
(not in the project file) are simply ignored (there's not even an
user/password prompt, nor the handle bad layers dialog).
- there's no save prompt if the current project was modified
- I seem to have some crashes every now and then

Is there a way to simply open a file using python given it's path ? Am I
just missing it ?

Thanks for your help !!

Olivier

Hi,

Does

iface.addProject( path ) work?

Hi Matthias,

Yes it seems to work !
I guess I didn't find it because I was looking for load/open rather an
add...

I don't get the save prompt if the current project what modified though,
but in my case it's good enough.

Thanks a lot for the quick answer !

Hi,

The parallel line tool works fine at my local installation (master, 
kubuntu).

I agree that the numeric input is not yet ideal (because it can be 
easily overwritten, as Martin discovered). If you have a better idea how 
to allow numeric inputs you are welcome to propose a better approach.

We originally wanted the spinbox to follow the mouse cursor in the map 
canvas (like in Autocad) - but for some reasons this did not work with 
qt across all operating systems. That's why the spinbox is now at the 
bottom left. Maybe this would be easier to implement now with qt5?

It would also be nice to have a keyboard modifier (e.g. ctrl) which 
would make a copy of an existing line, rather than moving the existing line.

I haven't tested on Linux, but on Windows there's no way of interacting
with this widget. Martin's method doesn't work for me...

Oddly on Windows this spin box DOES follow the mouse cursor...

We made an ifdef because it did not work on Linux. But that was the 
story with the background buffering and it probably works now on Linux 
too. So you might just remove the ifdef (if you think that the following 
spinbox is better).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python: How to call snapToCurrentLayer in
 QgsMapCanvasSnapper for QGis2.8
Message-ID: <1426596406757-5193879.post@n6.nabble.com>

I have a polygon vector layer and I want to snap the vertex.

def canvasMoveEvent(self,event):
  x = event.pos().x()
  y = event.pos().y()
  startingPoint = QPoint(x,y)
  snapper = QgsMapCanvasSnapper(self.iface.mapCanvas())
 
(retval,result)=snapper.snapToCurrentLayer(startingPoint,QgsSnapper.SnapToVertex,
-1)
  point = result[0].snappedVertex
  pointnr = result[0].snappedVertexNr

It work's fine for QGis2.0.
But in Qgis2.8 the result is always empty. Can anyone help me?

Message-ID: <CAL1Jat9bXVv3fsEgcJETyycfa04OGaS=Ka4g31f4QACKMNV06w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list!

QgsRubberBand items sometimes not refreshing properly when another map
canvas item (QgsVertexMarker) intersects them. This happens with 2.8,
in 2.6.1 works as expected.

See: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4egl61juue9ewop/rubberband.png?dl=0 as
illustration

How to reproduce:
1. Open empty project (epsg:4326)

2. Execute this script in python console:
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from qgis.gui import *
from qgis.core import *

mCursor = QgsVertexMarker(iface.mapCanvas())
mCursor.setIconType(QgsVertexMarker.ICON_BOX)
mCursor.setIconSize(20)
mCursor.setZValue(5)

points = [[QgsPoint(0, 0), QgsPoint(20, 30), QgsPoint(0, 60)]]

rb = QgsRubberBand(iface.mapCanvas(), True)
rb.setToGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolygon(points), None)
rb.setColor(QColor(125, 125, 0))
rb.show()

def changeCursorPos(p):
    mCursor.setCenter(p)

iface.mapCanvas().xyCoordinates.connect(changeCursorPos)

3. Move mouse cursor over rubber band.
You can erase rubber band from bottom to some upper point.

Tested on win7 32bit

Anyone confirms?

Hi,

I can confirm that. The widget follows nicely the mouse, but there is no 
way to edit the values, even if has focus.

So, definitely a bug on the Windows platform.

Thanks Nyall,

Sorry for the delay, I was at FOSS4G last week.   I tested this out and
confirms it is working now as intended.   Any clue on when it might be
available in a 2.8 update?

Thanks again!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Post-processing queries on postgis layers (after
	insert/delete/update)
Message-ID: <CAExk7p10tu5NXjK28Ss19CN=POd8LYx2XN0e+MO=+nkSTJDDLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

I have a database where I need to be able to run post-processing queries
after inserts/updates/deletes.

Up to now, I was doing this using postgres triggers, but I need to do it in
a more flexible way (I must be able to enable/disable the postprocessing
depending on user and clients preferences, and even be able to trigger it
on demand).


I'm able to run SQL queries after inserts using this signal :
QgsVectorLayer.committedFeaturesAdded(layerId, addedFeatures)

The problem is that the addedFeatures array contains the features in their
state BEFORE they were committed.
This means they have no ID assigned yet (since the ID is assigned by
postgres), and thus I'm not able to do my postprocessing specificaly on
those features.

Is there a way to achieve this ?
Things like lastInsertId() probably won't work since in most case several
features are commited at once.
I can only think of some ugly methods, like having a column with a
"postprocessing_todo" flag.

Actually, a great thing would be to have the committedFeaturesAdded
signal return
an array of database generated ids, which is easy to get (at least in
postgres) using this syntax :
INSERT INTO <table> (<fields>) VALUES (<values>) RETURNING <id field>

Any help would be much appreciated ;)

Bests,

Olivier

Are you sure it is?  I didn't try, but the postgres provider already updates
the feature ids of the features passed to QgsPostgresProvider::addFeatures and
and emits those in committedFeaturesAdded afterwards when the commit is run.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] graph and plots improvements?
Message-ID: <CAMMN2u0jDtjaKxCnxcncgyCXvfQotDd6C2MQRwM4drf+fLMQ1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
working with QGIS on a big project I have the need to make some plot and
graphs of some attributes.
I used the plugin Statist, I tried to use the Diagram tab and the Graphics
tab in Processing.
Just a few notes and possible ideas:
* I think that the plots made with Processing are very very useful and easy
to use, but they need some enhancement (title, some axes customization,
maybe add some trend line and so on)
* does anyone think that it could be useful to add a "core plugin" where
one can easily make, customize and export the plots? Maybe impove Statist
and include it in the core
* one last thing. It'd be also very useful to have the chance to export the
plots within the print layout (e.g. add an image that in fact is a plot..).


Sorry for the idea flow but maybe someone is interested to improve that..

Thanks guys

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Mattheo, 
I totally agree with that feature request and am volunteer to work on that
if needed.

I have been doing experiments with processing scripts using library such as
pandas (relying on matplotlib), seaborn and plot.ly.  
See "Summarize_numeric_columns_using_Pandas" script in  my github
https://github.com/aeag/QGIS-Processing/tree/master/scripts ) for a first
example. We also have unpublished scripts making graphs if needed.

I expect to have a student working on that this year: exploring what libs
are worth being shipped with qgis, and developping some processing tools
using that. 


The tries I have made up to now seems to conclude that the "must have" lib
is Pandas. Many QGIS processing tools working on non geographic data are
limited when datasets grow up. Pandas let it be extrmely fast and concise,
in a syntax very close from "R". That may be worth shipping it.. 
It weights nothing in comparison of Numpy (already required).. 

Once pandas shipped, we could probably make great improvements to Statist
and its friends. 

Cheers
R?gis

Pandas is really great. I used it a lot for my master thesis and was
excited, especially in combination with ipython notebook it's great to
process, combine and visualize data.
Just a minior sidenote: it makes use of numpy IIRC, so it's not an
alternative to it but something on top of it.

All the best

Thanks Regis and Matthias for your reply.
Shouln't we write a small work flow somewhere or, I don't now what it's
better, in order to start working on that?

I mean, if there are a few people interested on this topic it'd be great to
have an idea on how to organize the work.. :)

Thanks!

Agreed, would be a great addition - thanks Matteo for raising the issue.
Perhaps worth a QEP?
All the best.

Hi !

Thanks for your answer. I tested in more details, and it works indeed on a
normal table.

But in my scenario, I am editing a view, using some triggers to make the
view editable.

Here's a simplified case, it consists of one table, one view, and triggers
to insert/update/delete the view.:

https://gist.github.com/olivierdalang/cad70df2d463d0b87566

When I insert something using this query manually :

INSERT INTO test_view (name) VALUES ('abc'),('def') RETURNING id


I get

id
> ---
> 7
> 8


So it seems my triggers are working correctly (note that one mustn't
forget RETURNING
id INTO NEW.id in the insert trigger, without it we can't get the id back),
and I was hoping that it would be transparent to QGIS.

But when testing in QGIS, I get no id for the view.

Here's how I test (in the python console) :

def test(layerID, addedFeatures):

    print( 'committedFeaturesAdded was triggered on layerID'+layerID )

    for feat in addedFeatures:

        print( 'testing id: %s' % str(feat.id()) )

        print( 'testing attributes: %s' % str(feat.attributes()) )


Then this to display output when news features are commited  (run this once
with the normal table selected, once with the view selected)

 iface.activeLayer().committedFeaturesAdded.connect( test )


Then, add some features on the *table*, when you commit, you get :

committedFeaturesAdded was triggered on layerIDtest20150318181848185
> testing id: 9
> testing attributes: [9, u'abc']
> testing id: 10

testing attributes: [10, u'def']


Then, add some features on the *view*, when you commit, you get :

committedFeaturesAdded was triggered on layerIDtest_view20150318181847398
> testing id: 0
> testing attributes: [NULL, u'abc']
> testing id: 0
> testing attributes: [NULL, u'def']


So the ID isn't set...

Am I doing something wrong ?
Or is QGIS using some other way to get back the ID of a new feature ? Any
idea of what that could be ?
I thought updatable views were more or less transparent to QGIS, and had
very good results with views up to now.


Best regards,

Olivier

Maybe someone could dig into this plugin again:

https://github.com/Sharpie/qgis-ipython

It would be awesome to be able to use pandas with matplotlib from in there.

Not really - just something that isn't expected.

It retrieves the default values for all attributes (which might be a call to
nextval), executes them and uses the result for the insert.  So it knows
the id before the insert and can update the feature with it.

I wan't aware of that plugin. For QGIS, I forsee something like that for
users:

 - embed pandas and make some teasing of what is possible with that with
some processing scripts for power users

 - find a way to embed updatable graphs outputs in qgis console (ipython or
even more: bridge to ipython notebook ?) and composer. 
BTW I'm really interested in testing Plotly collaborative platform.. Could
we find a way to embed plotly graphs in QGIS just like other graphs? For
those who don't know plotly, just give it a try at plot.ly . You can
generate graphs from many API's (python, javascripts), inline app, or excel
tools, publish them and share them on the web.. fork them.. It's a github
thing for graphs..
 
 - upgrade statist to make use of it, to speed up things, and have a more
concise code, add ouptut options  (bars, plots, boxplots), add some
dedicated options to times series ( resample on time frame)


All I want is to find a way to explore data, and give tools to my end users
for which QGIS has become the best data exploring tool we have (thanks to
its wonderfull data connectivity capacities, and also the geospatial thing..
)

Opinions?

I would love to be able to have a linked ipython qtconsole or notebook for
just this sort of use.  I have long regretted that the ipython plugin isnt
maintained any more.  I have taken a few stabs at trying to update it but
it was beyond my minimal skills.

J?rgen,

I've been able to solve my problem by adding a default value on my view
(and by also forwarding the ID in the insert trigger) :

> ALTER VIEW test_view ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('test_id_seq');


I updated the gist just in case :

Thank you very much for your help :)

Now I've got another problem, the committedAttributeValuesChanges and
committedGeometriesChanges
signals of QgsVectorLayer don't seem to fire when I change attributes or
geometries...
I'm not sure if I'm hitting a bug or if there's something else I don't
understand, but this time the problem doesnt come from views (it appears
also on normal tables).

Here's my test case (to be run in the python console, with a vector layer
selected) :


> def testFeaturesAdded(a, b):
> 	QgsMessageLog.logMessage( 'committedFeaturesAdded was triggered' )
>
> def testFeaturesRemoved(a, b):
> 	QgsMessageLog.logMessage( 'committedFeaturesRemoved was triggered' )
>
> def testAttributeValuesChanges(a, b):
> 	QgsMessageLog.logMessage( 'committedAttributeValuesChanges was triggered' )
>
> def testGeometriesChanges(a, b):
> 	QgsMessageLog.logMessage( 'committedGeometriesChanges was triggered' )
>
> iface.activeLayer().committedFeaturesAdded.connect( testFeaturesAdded )
> iface.activeLayer().committedFeaturesRemoved.connect( testFeaturesRemoved )
> iface.activeLayer().committedAttributeValuesChanges.connect( testAttributeValuesChanges )
> iface.activeLayer().committedGeometriesChanges.connect( testGeometriesChanges )





I get messages on committed creation and deletion of features, but not
on modifications...

Is it a bug ? If someone confirms, I'll file a ticket... (I tested
under master and 2.8.1)


Best regards,


Olivier

Hello,
I updated http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5606 with a pull request that allows
the delimited text provider to also infer long and longlong as a type
(instead of treating those as doubles). I also did a couple more pull
requests on github (under name: carolinux). Would be nice if somebody
looked at them.

Message-ID: <1543308860.2300429.1426789356956.JavaMail.zimbra@research.iiit.ac.in>

Respected Sir,

I wanted to know if we can have multiple labeling in print composer.After digitization i made the id's as the label now i want to have one more attribute as a label on the same digitized layer along with the id's as the label.

1.png and 2.png shows the 2 label's of the same vector file.Now is there any way to put these 2 label's one over the other with different properties( e.g 1 label id should come in middle of layer and then 2 label shape comes somewhere inside the layer).

Can we do this?

Regards,
Nancy

Respected Sir,

This is with respect to your previous mail.This is what i figured out from your mail please correct me if i am wrong.
1> Rather than writing a code for pan sharpening we should try to import the already existing tools from GDAl/GRASS for pan sharpening into QGIS as a complete tool set under raster processing tab in QGIS.

So this is what i understood so here our requirement is :-
1>To have a display option of Pan sharpening under Raster->Miscellaneous->Pan sharpening-> Methods (Method 1 would be Bayes,Method 2 would be lmvm etc.)
2>We should import the pan sharpening tools from GDAL/GRASS. (I would like you to explain me to how exactly to go about with it in just a vague manner would be enough)

I also understood that we can install OrFeo toolbox and directly use the pan sharpening algorithm from there.

Instead it would be better if we had it as a separate option as a Raster process in QGIS.

Regards,
Nancy

Nancy,

We did see your 1st email message, I suspect the slow response is due to
the weekend and many people not having an opinion on the topic.

Looking around a little I would say the focus of the project should be
to get existing pansharpen tools into QGIS. Looking in the toolbox Orfeo
methods are already available. However i.pansharpen from GRASS does not
appear to be there. Also there's this great set of gdal scripts from
https://github.com/gina-alaska/dans-gdal-scripts that includes a
pansharpen (not sure which algorithms). Having all of these in the
Processing toolbox in QGIS would be really nice.

If you really want to work on additional algorithms not already in those
tools I would suggest you work with either the GDAL or GRASS projects
directly. Implementing in those tools leads to them being available in
QGIS and likely being more maintainable and useful as they can be then
also be scripted, which makes sense when you have huge amounts of images
to fix.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Nancy,

Instead of labelling the polygons with the values of a single field you 
can use multiple fields by building an expression using the expression 
builder. In the Layer Label Settings dialogue you'll see the button for 
the expression builder next to the box where you choose the field.

If you have two fields, one called ID and the other NAME, then you can 
build an expression like:
  "ID"  || ' ' ||  "NAME"

If you would like these to appear on different lines then you can set 
the label to wrap on a character, e.g. an asterisk *, and then write 
your expression as:

  "ID"  || '*' ||  "NAME"

You can also insert your own text into the labels like this:

'ID: ' || "ID"  || '*Name: ' ||  "NAME"


Hope that helps.

Frank.

Message-ID: <1426846555838-5194606.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
users found a nasty bug I couldn't find in redmine. When having 2.4 qgs
projects with user legend text and Auto Update OFF in composer's legend,
that text is not reused when opening it in QGIS  2.6 or QGIS 2.8.1. 

That leads to complete manual rebuild of legends in all composers.  That
will give severe headeachs to users here. 
Anyone confirms?

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS plugin : connect to polygonselect Maptool
	signals
Message-ID: <550BF761.30301@gmail.com>

Hello to all !

Working on a new QGIS plugin I am trying to connect a custom function to 
the mouse right-clic signal, while using the polygon select maptool.

I have activated the maptool through :

|def  run(self):
     self.iface.actionSelectPolygon().trigger()|

And would now like to connect my selectSite function to a 
canvasReleaseEvent or similar signal. From an interesting tutorial here 
<http://www.qgisworkshop.org/html/workshop/plugins_tutorial.html> I 
adapted the code and tried the line below which failed :

|def  run(self):
     self.iface.actionSelectPolygon().trigger()
     result=  QObject.connect(self.canvas.mapTool(),  SIGNAL("canvasReleaseEvent()"),  self.selectSite)

def  selectSite(self):
     QMessageBox.information(  self.iface.mainWindow(),"Info",  "in selectSite function"  )|

Any ideas or hints on how I can achieve my goal ?

I understand I could reimplement my own polygon selecting tool and 
customize it, but it seems like an overkill and am looking for something 
simpler - if possible.
Is there another way around by connecting to a more generic Qt mouse 
click signal sent by canvas or Qt ?

Thanks for help.

Cev.

What kind of parallel processing do you need?

For example, rendering in QGIS is done in parallel.

Do you need to do parallel processing for topological testing?

Without more information, I can't say much more.

Hi all.
I try hard to keep the unapproved plugins queue clean and tidy. I just
published as deprecated a few plugin for which I had no feedback from
developers for a long time. I hope this will help interested developers
to adopt them. Of course in this case the deprecated tag can be removed
any time.
This should not be a problem for users, as they would have to explicitly
choose a deprecated plugin, so they are warned.
All the best.

hi Patricia - links to a couple of articles that might spur your thinking.

http://dimensionaledge.com/intro-vector-tiling-map-reduce-postgis/

http://dimensionaledge.com/from-days-to-minutes-geoprocessing-of-alberta-land-use-data/

As George mentioned, Qgis is brilliant for multithreaded rendering - particularly when installed on your multi core processing servers and accessed by Remote Desktop (RDP) which minimizes the amount of data that has to traverse your broadband link in order to visualize it.

But when it comes to the multi core geoprocessing itself, there's a wide range of tools equipped for the job. The code patterns I've shared above are on github and are PostGIS focussed - but they can be easily adapted to incorporate R, GRASS, GDAL commands and more into a single parallel pipeline job. Scripting skills are a must.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not very clear how to set variables with ccmake in the QGIS project 
2.8.1, but now I learn that library paths need to be complete, i.e. :

Not : -DSPATIALITE_LIBRARY:string=/usr/local/lib

But : -DSPATIALITE_LIBRARY:string=/usr/local/lib/libspatialite.so

Then, my new command line for ccmake is :

     cmake .. 
-DGEOS_CONFIG:string=/opt/intel/geos-3.4.2/bin/geos-config \
-DGDAL_CONFIG:string=/opt/intel/gdal-1.10_base/bin/gdal-config \

-DQWTPOLAR_LIBRARY:string=/usr/local/qwtpolar-1.0.0/lib/libqwtpolar.so

And now, several errors previously reported at the compiling stage are 
resolved (not detailled here).

ERROR due to a "wrong" version of Qscientilla was also resolved 
(related to my OS, centOS 6.5, the version of Qscintilla was not 
specified in INSTALL notes) :

Building CXX object 
src/gui/CMakeFiles/qgis_gui.dir/qgscodeeditor.cpp.o

error: 'replaceSelectedText' was not declared in this scope
make[2]: *** [src/gui/CMakeFiles/qgis_gui.dir/qgscodeeditor.cpp.o]

The solution is described here : 
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2014-November/035370.html 
Where you can read that QGIS 2.8 needs Qscintilla >> 2.5 !! 
(apparently, replaceSelectedText() was added since this version) So, 
in my case I get QScintilla-gpl-2.8.tar.gz and compile it from source 
(because there is no package for centos6.5)

ERROR due to the support of GRASS 7 in QGIS 2.8.1

error: 'G__setenv' was not declared in this scope

The solution is described here 
:http://osdir.com/ml/qgis-user-gis/2015-03/msg00151.html and follow 
the link inside that post.You need to apply patches on 
src/providers/grass/qgsgrass.cpp and src/providers/grass/qgsgrass.h in 
the QGIS src trre ion order to compile GGIS against GRASS 7) Note that 
the post aboves say that QGIS 2.8.1 do not support Grass vectors map 
previously created with the grass 6 topology [May be a conversion from 
the old grass 6 to grass 7 topology should be applied (see 
Convert_all_GRASS_6_vector_maps_to_GRASS_7, from grasswiki.osgeo.org 
for further reading), not tested and not the subject here]

The last ERROR, at step :

[ 84%] Generating gui/sip_guipart0.cpp, gui/sip_guipart1.cpp, 
gui/sip_guipart2.cpp, gui/sip_guipart3.cpp
sip: Unable to find file "Qsci/qscimod4.sip"
make[2]: *** [python/gui/sip_guipart0.cpp] Error 1

EDIT : When I installed QScintilla-gpl-2.8 from source, I forgot to 
build the (Python binding for QScintilla2 (no extension Qsci for pyQT4 
in /usr/share/sip/PyQt4). To fix that :

cd QScintilla-gpl-2.8/Python ; python configure.py ; make make install
check out by trying to import PyQt4.Qsci from python (it works)

Now QGIS compile like a charm without any error from a clean build 
tree

Hi Jerome
You will need to compile Qgis against Python 2.7 - which you need to install from source. Not yum.

You then need to make sure you have the latest bindings installed.

add the KDE repo - it has many of the required libs in there.

But when it comes to the multi core geoprocessing itself, there's a wide range of tools equipped for the job. The code patterns I've shared above are on github and are PostGIS focussed - but they can be easily adapted to incorporate R, GRASS, GDAL commands and more into a single parallel pipeline job. Scripting skills are a must.

I would note that there are currently 11 tickets having "2.8.2" as their
target, 6 of which are marked as "Blocker". I dunno how to provide an URL
to quickly point to that list of 6-11.

I don't think blocker has much meaning in this context. They aren't
new issues which don't exist in 2.8.1, and if no-one is actively
working on fixing them then they can wait to >= 2.8.3.

In the meantime we've got a stackload of nice bug fixes waiting in 2.8
branch for a release...

I suggest creating a new 2.8.3 target in hub then, and start moving issues
there (those that are not regressions introduced by 2.8.1, if any).

Then, by *requiring* that any commit in 2.8 *must* reference a ticket
in hub, release management can happen from there (hub), allowing for
a per-ticket discussion (if needed).

It would help to have a way to make hub queries accessible via a simple
link. Does any such thing exist in redmine ? Similar to "reports" for trac...

What's the benefit compared to inspecting the git log with optional
references to tickets where available?
Discussions may as well be attached to a commit or pull request.

Discussion in commit/PR are both under full control by github,
HUB is in the hands of QGIS developers. Ticketting system allows
to attach a milestone to the issue, postponing if agreed. It also
allows to query for "all issues fixed in version X" which is easier
to answer than associating a (usually higher) number of commits to
the corresponding issue.

This weekend we moved back to the osgeo server, so please do not include

Hi Lene,

I have a question on the upcoming QGIS user conf and developer meeting 
in Denmark 
(http://ign.ku.dk/english/outreach-publications/conferences-seminars/international-qgis-user-and-developer-conference/ 
and 
https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/13_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Copenhagen_2015). 
Are both events at the same location ( N?debo) or is the user conference 
prior to the dev meeting at a different location? The conference web 
page is not very clear about the location (at least I can't find it).

Thanks,
Andreas

Respected Sir,

This is with respect to your previous mail.This is what i figured out from your mail please correct me if i am wrong.
1> Rather than writing a code for pan sharpening we should try to import the already existing tools from GDAl/GRASS for pan sharpening into QGIS as a complete tool set under raster processing tab in QGIS.

So this is what i understood so here our requirement is :-
1>To have a display option of Pan sharpening under Raster->Miscellaneous->Pan sharpening-> Methods (Method 1 would be Bayes,Method 2 would be lmvm etc.)

I also understood that we can install OrFeo toolbox and directly use the pan sharpening algorithm from there.

Instead it would be better if we had it as a separate option as a Raster process in QGIS.

Nancy,

We did see your 1st email message, I suspect the slow response is due to
the weekend and many people not having an opinion on the topic.

Looking around a little I would say the focus of the project should be
to get existing pansharpen tools into QGIS. Looking in the toolbox Orfeo
methods are already available. However i.pansharpen from GRASS does not
appear to be there. Also there's this great set of gdal scripts from
https://github.com/gina-alaska/dans-gdal-scripts that includes a
pansharpen (not sure which algorithms). Having all of these in the
Processing toolbox in QGIS would be really nice.

If you really want to work on additional algorithms not already in those
tools I would suggest you work with either the GDAL or GRASS projects
directly. Implementing in those tools leads to them being available in
QGIS and likely being more maintainable and useful as they can be then
also be scripted, which makes sense when you have huge amounts of images
to fix.

Thanks,
Alex

I also wonder when the actual hackfest is.  As believe it starts on wednesday
and ends on friday.   If we use the first and last day partly for travelling
there's only one full day - which seems a bit short to me.

Apparently we could also use the weekend, but I don't how that would fit into
the already made travel plans of everyone and who would be there.

For me there are direct return flights on friday evening and sunday morning -
so both would be an option.

Hi,

Some of us have already booked the flight (I arrive on monday and
leave on saturday), I understood that the HF was from monday to
friday, I hope I wasn't mistaken and we can still run the HF in
parallel with the conference.

It may just be me, but I don't think any of this brings a huge benefit.
The rule also brings some overhead. When I find a bug that's not in the
tracker I prefer to just fix it and describe what has been done in the
commit message. Creating an issue for that is a bit cumbersome.

It is, but that's part of augmenting stability value of the branch.
If it's not worth the trouble of burocracy, then it's not so important
to be fixed ..

Hi
The conference and the Hackfest/developers meeting are at the same location. University of Copenhagen- Forestry College, N?debovej 77a, DK-3480 Fredensborg. https://goo.gl/maps/oOiPZ


The conference is from Monday 18. May ? Tuesday 19. May.
The Meeting is from Monday 18. May ? Friday 22. May. Developers can attend both ? it is possible to arrive from Saturday 16. May and departure Sunday 24. May. (So tourist activity is possible too ?)

The conference is planned to be parallel so Users and Developers have a chance to meet.

And questions about accommodation transport for developers ? please write direct to me. And please fill in the informations on https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/13_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Copenhagen_2015 so we have a chance to plan ?

Emne: Question on user conference

Hi Lene,

I have a question on the upcoming QGIS user conf and developer meeting in Denmark (http://ign.ku.dk/english/outreach-publications/conferences-seminars/international-qgis-user-and-developer-conference/ and https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/13_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Copenhagen_2015). Are both events at the same location ( N?debo) or is the user conference prior to the dev meeting at a different location? The conference web page is not very clear about the location (at least I can't find it).

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi all,

I have finally launched the crowdfunding campaign to support the GRASS
plugin upgrade. Briefly, it covers upgrade to GRASS 7, browser
integration, drag-and-drop import and new vector editing. All the
details are available here:

Hi Radim,
this is a beautiful idea and i hope you will get plenty of funds.

I have some questions regarding the implementation, since this is not
mentioned in the project description:

Do you plan to implement the plugin in C++ only, or will you try to
combine C++ (data provider) and Python (all the rest)? The reason i am
asking is, that using Python for the user interaction, module calling,
vector editing and mapset/location handling would allow us GRASS
developer to provide possible improvements and bugfixes for the plugin
more easily. For example, the time series handling [1] in GRASS GIS is
mainly implemented in Python and provides a Python API that could be
used in the QGIS GRASS Plugin to implement time series analysis
support.
Using the QGIS Python plugin approach will reduce the need for
compilation, which allows much faster development of modifications and
bugfix testing.
The data provider and vector editing helper classes must be of course
implemented in C++ and should stay in the QGIS source tree.

Best regards
Soeren

I completely agree that Python would be better, the advantages of
Python are obvious and that would be definitely my choice if I had to
start from scratch. Un(fortunately) the GRASS plugin + qgsgrassgislib
have already 22500 lines of C++ so porting to Python is not an option
and mixing C++ in single plugin either (as far to my knowledge).

Are there functions in time series implementation which need to be
called directly from the plugin or everything may be done just calling
t.rast.* modules?

Indeed, porting the C++ code to Python is a large effort. However,
maybe you can define a stretch-goal in the crowd funding campaign? If
this goal is met, then you have enough funds to port the C++ code to
Python and you can add more features?

I think that using C++ and Python in a Plugin shouldn't be a big
problem in my humble opinion. The main issue would be that the C++
code of the data provide will be part of QGIS and the Python code that
makes use of the GRASS data provider will be a separate GRASS Python
QGIS plugin. Maybe this approach will allow to implement several
independent Python plugins that make use of the GRASS data provider to
implement specific algorithms?

Most of the temporal functionality is available through the temporal
modules. However some important algorithms (temporal re-sampling) are
available only in the Python framework. This is needed for time series
animation creation. Using the framework directly will speed things up,
because the module calls, the parsing and interpretation of the module
outputs can be avoided.

Many thanks for the QGIS GRASS Plugin

I don't have any serious estimation how much porting from C++ to
Python costs, but new line of code costs 10-50euro (according to quick
internet search). To be really very modest, say that porting would
cost 2 euro per line, i.e. 22500*2 = 45000 euro for somethings which
brings no new features to users. That is not something I would ever
propose.

The plugin and the provider are sharing some C++ code (qgsgrass and
qgsgrasslib). To port the plugin to Python you also have to write and
maintain Python bindings for that shared classes which is just extra
work.

That should not depend on the GRASS plugin in C++. If you write Python
bindings for the provider, you can use it (non standard)  in your
Python plugin. I believe however that plugins implementing algorithms
should be preferably provider independent.

If it should be used for dynamic animation in QGIS canvas you could
consider the possibility to subclass raster renderer in Python and
insert it into raster layer pipe from Python plugin.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS rasters in Processing?
Message-ID: <551148BA.8030806@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I noticed that GRASS rasters are not usable directly in Processing: is
there a technical reason for this, or they are just filtered out from
the list of available layers?
On the other hand, vectors are available for analysis, but QGIS gets
stuck at 100% CPU forever for a command (Split lines with lines, and an
error[0] for gdalogr:gridinvdist.

GDAL execution console output
Unable to open input datasource
"/home/paolo/Documents/Didattica/Corsi_Formazione_Faunalia/QGIS/QGIS_data/grass/Toscana_corso/PERMANENT/dtm_points/1_point".

To me this seems both a bug (do not show layers for which an analysis
cannot be run) and a feature request (support GRASS raster and vectors
as Processing input).
Am I wrong? If confirmed, I'm going to open the relevant tickets.

All the best.

Speaking about animations, some things from GRASS GIS GUI could be perhaps
used directly in the same was as Tcl/Tk NVIZ is used in processing for
GRASS 6. Animation tool is one of them. This would be great since we would
get al least some functionality/code sharing between GRASS and QGIS GUIs
which is otherwise not possible due to Python/wxPython and C++/Qt (and
would be only possible if both things would be at least in the same
language).

This is of course not fulfilling the requirement to be general, i.e. work
with other data providers in QGIS, but surely some things just have to be
like that if they are using GRASS-specific formats (temporal data) or
algorithms (e.g. algorithms to work with temporal data, their topology,
...).

this sounds good. Are you speaking about QGIS GUI (in Python) generated
from --interface-description? Do you think it would be possible to write it
in a way which would be GUI framework independent so that it is usable in
both GRASS and QGIS? The GUIs for modules in GRASS are quite good now but
the code should be rewritten and this would be a great way how to get this
new implementation.

The GUI for GRASS module in the plugin is also generated based on
--interface-description, qgm files are only used to define a subset of
module's options or to override option attributes (like label) if
necessary. So it is already implemented, but always combined with qgm,
skipping qgm, it maybe used to generate generic UI for any module.
Using qgm gives more power, for example table field combo options
based on current layer selected as input, setting input type from
input layer, selecting feature categories in map canvas and so on.

Do you see a possibility how we could join the effort?

Both QGIS and GRASS are adding different extra features like setting region
according to a selected raster or dependent fields for vector GRASS layers
and attributes. That's why it gets complicated at the end. And of course
then there is the extra information which is not stored in XML such as
"GRASS standard options".

Anyway, skipping qgm is quite important feature for QGIS since it is
necessary for GRASS addons as you say.

Hi,
       I am currently working with some large geographic files (~130Gb
divided in thousands of files) and I need to output the result of the
analysis in some sort of data format, which cannot be a relational database
(because of the people that will be using this processing framework in the

       Right now I am reading and writing to text files, which is EXTREMELY
slow.  DBF is not really a good option because its many legacy issues, so I
was thinking about hdf5 or something of that sort.

    Is there anything in QGIS that would me allow to work with that?

   I am on a Windows environment, so using my pytables installation is a
pain in the neck.  Any suggestions?

   BTW any advancements on how to install Python packages to QGIS own
python installation?

Thanks,

Hi Pedro!

I think I cannot help you with large data.. (unwritten law of IT that
it is pushed to its limits everytime).
But regarding a python modules probably take a look here:

Did you have a look at spatialite?

It is a portable database format like dbf, has good support by qgis,
supports indexing...

Message-ID: <5512673E.3050606@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
we now have a good CSW client in core (MetaSearch), and a couple of
metadata editors as an additional plugins [0][1].
I think adding also a CSW server configurator would complete the
toolchain. This could be done integrating PyCSW in QGIS, and possibly in
its web clients (QGIS web client and LizMap). Anyone interested?
What are the missing pieces and stumbling blocks, in your view?
Thanks.

Including PyCSW in QGIS will make it non-free in the opinion of the
Debian FTP masters. They have not accepted the pycsw package into main
because it contains the OGC XSDs, the OGC Document & Software Notice
license terms used for the XSDs are problematic.

This issue was discussed on the standards lists recently, see the
threading started at:

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/standards/2015-February/000834.html

In Debian the PyCSW code will need to be stripped from QGIS to keep it
out of non-free, it will have to move to contrib because of the non-free
pycsw dependency.

I'm not in favor of including PyCSW in QGIS until OGC license situation
is resolved.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] A plea for plugin authors
Message-ID: <551270E0.2030705@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I would like to ask our plugin authors to take special care and
attention to the following:

Metadata
========

* avoid using a name too similar to existing plugins
* if your plugin has a similar functionality to an existing plugin,
please explain the differences in the About field, so the user will know
which one to use without the need to install and test it
* avoid repeating "plugin" in the name of the plugin itself
* use the description field in metadata for a 1 line description, the
About field for more detailed instructions
* include a code repository, a bug tracker, and a home page; this will
greatly enhance the possibility of collaboration, and can be done very
easily with one of the available web infrastructures (GitHub, GitLab,
Bitbucket, etc.)
* choose tags with care: avoid the uninformative ones (e.g. vector) and
prefer the ones already used by others (see [1])
* add a proper icon, do not leave the default one; see QGIS interface
for a suggestion of the style to be used

Code and help
=============

* do not include generated file (ui_*.py, resources_rc.py, generated
help files?) and useless stuff (e.g. .gitignore) in repository
* add the plugin to the appropriate menu (Vector, Raster, Web, Database)
* when appropriate (plugins performing analyses), consider adding the
plugin as a subplugin of Processing framework: this will allow users to
run it in batch, to integrate it in more complex workflows, and will
free you from the burden of designing an interface; a good example of
this move is LecoS[0]
* has at least minimal documentation and, if useful for testing and
understanding, sample data.

Further info at [2].

Please write if you need further help.
All the best.

And you might get your end users to reconsider the decision not to use a 
database solution:

PostgreSQL/PostGIS is free to download and use in any configuration you 
choose, very easy to install compared with other database installation 
procedures and works very well with QGIS.

IMHO, It's the best solution for handling large amounts of GIS vector-data.

I was thinking mainly to use QGIS as a graphical configurator of PyCSW,
not really merging the code, so this could be a non problem.

All the best.

Even when the PyCSW code is not included in QGIS, having QGIS depend on
PyCSW will require it to move to contrib, because packages in main cannot
depend on packages in non-free.

If there is no dependency on PyCSW and QGIS only generates a config file
or something will allow QGIS to stay in main.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi Bas,

This would not require QGIS to depend on pycsw.
Configuration of pycsw is done through a config file, which could be 
edited independently.
Also, publishing to pycsw can take place through CSW-T, plain CSW API ;)

Best,
Angelos

Hi Paolo,

This idea is excellent: we discussed something similar some time ago, 
when we were thinking about future features for MetaSearch.
Among those features were a metadata editor and direct configuration for 
pycsw publishing.
I strongly believe that these features should reach core QGIS in the future.

Best,
Angelos

Hi Angelos,
glad you are interested. Could you please give us an outline of what is
necessary? Even better, publish a QEP for this?
All the best, and thanks.

This looks like a bug.

Even thought I'm programming with the raster calculator, there are strong
tells that this is a bug. I tested this programming and using the inteface:
same results.

In the attachment there is the file I'm working with. I tried this simple
math:

* radiance.tif

(raster * 0.03705882) + 3.2

It's output is all NODATA.

I've tried:

raster + 1

It's output is NODATA.

raster * 0.5

It's output is NODATA.

If that's not a bug I'm not sure what it is. It looks like on 2.6 it was
fine. I'm working on this for two days, and unless I'm doing something
really really wrong, it think it's a bug.

Please, see the TIF imagery attached (zip).

All the formulae is simple and should work without issues.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] snapping marker and other digitizing doubts
Message-ID: <CACfnYnQ7zAd2JH6_YREaU+oKmsuxR7t-ya-=_NA69fCJBNbiVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I usually don't do much digitizing but recently I have done a little
and I have a few doubts:

*) the pink/purple marker that shows when snapping comes into action
appear only when using the "add features" tool, and not the node tool,
is this on purpose?

*) the marker used when snapping with the measure tools is different,
is this also on purpose? Would not be better be the same as the
digitizing one?

*) consider the case of two adjacent polygons and snapping enabled: if
I move (with the "move features" tool) one  polygon then I cannot snap
it again in tis original place using the same "move features" tool.
But with the node tool it can be snapped back in its original
position... the user must select all the vertexes and then drag the
mouse after carefully clicking on one node (otherwise it will be moved
just one segment). it would not be better to allow the "move features"
tool to snap?

along the way I also possibly found issues with the "enable
topological editing" option, see:

https://hub.qgis.org/issues/12441

anyone can confirm?


 cheers

When I use the Feature info tool with the "Auto open form" option

Here's a screenshot:

I am using QGIS Testing (just updated) on Ubuntu using a PostGIS layer.

Is anyone familiar with this? Or should I file a new bug?

Hi, I have seen such troubles when the choosen primary key from qgis side is
not unique . 

Symptoms: selecting one feature select severals unrelated features of the
same layer. relation with attributes is broken also. 
 
Can you check in your layer's definition (general tab of layer properties)
if you choose gid field as key, and check if it is really unique in postgis?

Cheers
R?gis

Sounds like there are possibly two core workflows / use cases:

1./ publish an existing layer's metadata to a existing CSW

This could be realized by adding CSW publishing functionality to relevant
plugins (Metatools, QSphere, etc.).  Having said this, I think the silver
bullet here would be giving the Metadata section of the Layer Properties
window an update to support vanilla ISO 19115/19139 (this is worthy of a QEP
all by itself), and then have plugins build upon that for profiles, etc.
This would enhance metadata management deeper in QGIS.

In either case, as Angelos says the publishing machinery would be
pure CSW-T which is straightforward and implementation agnostic.  As CSW
does not dictate security, some additional logic would be required to handle
various authentication mechanisms of popular CSW implementations
(i.e. pycsw: IP-based restrictions, GeoNetwork: HTTP Basic Auth and
others, etc.)

One would then accomplish this (preferable) via MetaSearch, i.e.:
- add a 'publish' tab which provides layer list
- metadata would/could be generated dynamically or based on where it was
   saved from a plugin (i.e. look in same dir as data path for .xml
   file, etc.).  Dublin Core would be by far the easiest to implement,
   but I suspect ISO would be preferred
- 'publish' button would insert or update the record to the CSW
- 'delete' button would delete the record from the CSW

2./ publish an actual CSW service via QGIS Server

I'm not sure about the QGIS server innards, but pycsw can be easily integrated
(in Python) as a library to advertising a .qgs file's layer metadata against a
single endpoint supporting numerous search APIs like CSW, SRU, OAI-PMH,
OpenSearch/Atom, etc.  An SQLite3 DB would be the backend and pycsw
configuration (.ini / ConfigParser driven) would be handled by a dialog during
the publishing/export workflow.  The workflow would write the configuration
and import the metadata into the SQLite3 backend for metadata publishing.

Thanks Regis, that was exactly the issue. The (boolean!) field 
'inonderzoek' was used as a key. When I change that to 'gid' in the Add 
PostGIS Table dialog, everything works correctly.

Can anyone tell me why QGIS picks that boolean field for most of my 
tables? Can I change that behaviour by changing my database structure?

http://terglobo.nl/downloads/qgis_add_postgis_table_wrong_key.png

And how can the identify results be correct anyway?

Tnx,
Raymond

Good thing, as well.

Tom, would you mind opening QEPs for these issues?

Maybe I can, but I would need the table definition statement for it. Can 
you post it here.
Generally speaking you should define an integer field (use bigint if you 
expect _many_ datasets) as primary key for the table like:

CREATE TABLE my_points
(
   gid integer NOT NULL,
   the_geom geometry(Point,my_srid),
   other_fields,
   CONSTRAINT my_points_pkey PRIMARY KEY (gid)
);

Thanks Bernhard. I just figured that. But my layer is not a table, it is 
a view. And it seems that PostgreSQL cannot have constraints on views.

So, I think I just need to carefully select the right key field when 
loading it.

(And maybe QGIS could be slightly smarter by not suggesting a boolean 
field by default?)

Hi Raymond,

I thought it might be views because I never had any problems with 
tables. When defining views you should include a field
1) that is a primary key in the table it comes from and
2) whose values are unique in the view.

example: view with _one_ owner per parcel (parcels may be included 
several times if they have more than one owner)
a) use parcel-id => not unique, won't work
b) use owner-id => will work if no owner has more than one parcel (which 
would make the owner-id unique)
c) use id of the parcel-owner-relation table => should work

you still might need to carefully choose the id field when loading it 
into QGIS

Hi,
Raymond, you can use the row_number function to add a primary key to your
view.
Something like :
CREATE OR REPLACE view myview as
SELECT row_number () over ()::integer as id, fieldA, Field ...
from mytable .....
will add an unique integer field _id_ to your view. And this one can be
used in QGIS as primary key

To add my 2 cents worth,  I now habitually add a default INTEGER field to my PostGIS views to provide QGIS with a unique identifier.   I label this field ?qid? so as not to confuse it with potentially other unique keys that may already exist in the underlying data.

For example:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW myview AS
(WITH s AS (SELECT poly_id, (ST_Dump(wkb_geometry)).geom::geometry(Polygon, 4326) as the_geom FROM mytable ORDER BY 1)
SELECT row_number() over() as qid, s.* FROM s);

Hi Raymond,

The feature shown in the identify result is the one queried with the
geographic location.

For some reason the feature shown in the feature form is not a copy of
the identified data (feature) but queried again with its feature id.

For the views on pg databases I have here, the primary key of the main
source table is shown (which is the first field of the query that
defines the view), so it is fine by default. Not sure about the
heuristics used to get the default PK field.

I don't know enough about QGIS server to issue a QEP at this point,
so any help is appreciated.

Hi Tom,

If you want to stay with python, you might consider extending your
existing python plugin with a server interface, no need for a QEP, a
standard Python plugin will do.

Thanks all for pointing things out!

My view did have a unique id, it is just a sub set of another table. So 
by selecting it everything is solved.

Dear QGIS Development Team,

Our Team of software developers at Fugro Consult are currently developing an extension for QGIS. One function of our plugin is to load MS Access Databases into QGIS, both .mdb and .accdb. When working with a 64-bit version of QGIS the MS Access Databases are not regognized. Does it depend on the current ODBC Driver on the system? Is there another reason?

Kind regards

Hi,
you probably read the question from Peter on qgis-user [1].
Five years ago Marco said that this behaviour should have been changed
(first fetch based on current view extent) but AFAICS the WFS provider
still behaves the old way.
Was this proposal discarded for some reason?

Hi Giovanni

Unchecking the option 'cache features' did exactly that (first fetch 
based on current view extent and refetching of new parts when panning). 
This seems broken now (maybe since the multithreaded rendering?).

Another (not so convenient) method is to create an ogc filter by double 
clicking on the 'filter' column (enter ogc filter xml as a string in the 
expression editor).

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to set up QgsPointLocator.MatchFilter in
	python?
Message-ID: <1427454016611-5195736.post@n6.nabble.com>

I'm working with QGis 2.8 and python.
I replaced my QgsMapCanvasSnapper to QgsSnappingUtils. The following code
works fine for me.

    def canvasPressEvent(self,event):
    x = event.pos().x()
    y = event.pos().y()
    startingPoint = QPoint(x,y)
    utils = self.canvas.snappingUtils()
    SegmentLocator = utils.snapToCurrentLayer(startingPoint, 2)
    if SegmentLocator.isValid():
    edge = SegmentLocator.edgePoints()
    pt1 = edge[1]
    pt2 = edge[0]

Now I try to set up the MatchFilter to get matches only from a particular
feature ID. But I don't know how to begin. The following code dosen't work.

    fid = self.layer.selectedFeaturesIds()[0]
    filter = QgsPointLocator.MatchFilter
    match = QgsPointLocator.Match()
    filter.acceptMatch(match.featureId() == fid)
    SegmentLocator = utils.snapToCurrentLayer(startingPoint, 2, filter)

It would be nice if somebody can help me.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Have custom functions available in the console
Message-ID: <CAJmGCaQq50HKqbPOpgUMa3rFNi6=12qnSbLjJnf6kWYV3Z-g1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I want to have some helper functions available in the Python console within
qgis, for instance this:
def a():
    return iface.activeLayer()
so that I type less things. I tried to start qgis with the --code argument
but this didn't work. I also tried to put this function in the
.qgis2/python/startup.py but when I am in the console a() is not
recognized. I can create

@qgsfunction(0, "Python")
   def a(v,f,p):
       return iface.activeLayer()

in startup.py but then I'm not sure how I'd use it from within the console.
Also, I know I can use scriptrunner to get the function to work, but I am
looking to do this on startup, ie I start qgis, go to the console and a()
is available. Is this possible within Qgis core or should I look into maybe
adapting script runner for my purposes?

Bests,
Karolina Alexiou

Message-ID: <1033996294.8168001427473461896.JavaMail.httpd@webmail-39.iol.local>

Hi all, 
i would like in some situation switch off / on snapping options programmatically.
In try with below steps:
1 - get QgsProject.instance() --> proj
2 - get active layer --> activeLayer
3 - disable snapping options proj.setSnapSettingsForLayer(activeLayer.id(),False,2,1,10,True)

Nothing happend.

i can disable TopologicalEditing:

proj.setTopologicalEditing(False) -- it works

Any suggestions?


Thanks


Francesco

Hello,
Thanks, but this doesn't work in the console - it's invalid syntax.
Incidentally, I looked into the C++ code that initializes Python  for QGIS
(as I was looking for a solution to the issue above) and I made a pull
request to remove some duplicate code.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Print Composer] Attribute table item. Relation
	option is missing
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GtW2seaHr0pDVGQ3xKVHLDXD+ZxVrm+u2MWmU9rRTZjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

While doing screenshots for the User Manual, I have noticed (actually it
was Larissa) that In Print Composer I can't see the relation option of the
attribute table item.

I'm using QGIS 2.8.1 in ubuntu 14.04.

Please see the first images of this commit to see what I mean:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/commit/cacb92d13de8adda26709ff1dbff48494600f31c

Can anyone confirm this? Is there any condition in a project so that the
relation option show up?

Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

You'll need:

- a project with relations
- an atlas with the coverage layer set to the parent layer from a relation

Thanks Nyall.

I have also noticed that the appearance menu is not showing for older
projects already with a table item in a composer.

I will try to make a few more tests.

Yes, that's expected. When the attribute table was upgraded to handle
frames it required an API break. To avoid issues with scripts which
relied on composer templates I had to make the call that the old style
tables would not be upgraded automatically to the newer tables. That's
why older projects won't see the newer table features.

Just delete and re add the tables and you'll see all the new options.

I am getting convinced that the temporal data visualization support
should be added to QGIS core. A single time navigation toolbar
(from/to, start/stop, previous/next) and temporal support in data
providers (QgsVectorDataProvider::getFeatures,
QgsRasterDataProvider::block). That would allow simultaneous animation
of temporal data from various sources in different formats (time frame
defined by band, layer or attribute).

There are already 3 plugins for temporal data management [1][2][3],
writing another one seems misconception and wasting of resources.

Hi Radim, 
I follow your point here. 
I think plugins still  are in the very interesting and productive "natural
selection" phase, where plugin authors tests features and ergonomic options.
We still miss here some temporal interpolation / blurring / fading features
to render smooth videos. (see [0]) 

Comparing all existing tools to define specifications and UX would be a
great hackfest workshop. Once this done, +1 fo a core feature ! 

Anita probably has a better overview of that. 

Cheers
R?gis

+1 from me. I've also given this a lot of thought, and think that the
best solution would be in QGIS core.

I think porting the functionality from Time Manager would be a good
start, but what I would really like to see would be for QgsDataDefined
to be extended to handle animation support. This is already possible
by a combination of scale_linear and Time Manager's current time
expressions, but a better solution would be for
QgsDataDefined/QgsDataDefinedButton to allow for properties of
symbols/labels/composer items to be animated. For instance, smoothly
vary the symbol size between 2 and 4 mm between these two datetime
values.

I'd be willing to assist in coding this, but can't take the lead due
to time constraints.

Hi

I think the very first step in this should be to add proper date (time)
support.
I don't know the state and requirements for raster layers, but for
vector layers I think right now time is converted with the edit types
just for visualization but internally it is passed around as string. It
would be nice to handle them as QDate(Time) internally.

For time-aware databases (postgres...) this should be straightforward.
For others (like shapefile?) we probably need to manage the datatype on
the project level but conversion should IMHO happen low-level directly
in the provider code so things like timezone handling and whatever else
needs to be done can happen exactly once when the data is read from the
datasource or saved to the datasource.

Filtering (from date ... to date ) should best be done on the
QgsFeatureRequest level (setFilterExpression should already be ready I
guess)

Best,
Matthias

Message-ID: <CALuHMPD54-BwOE80TmQw5M1asfB2FkxPMXV+3nRed8mbRy7wUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

the students application period for GSoC 2015  is over and selection and
ranking proposals period starts. Deadline for reviews is a 6th of April. More
information can be found in the admins email [0].

This year we have two proposals:
  1. Multithread support on QGIS Processing toolbox by Marcus Santos
      Possible mentors: Victor Olaya and me
      Was one of the possible ideas in GSoC 2013 and 2014

  2. Pan Sharpening Plug-in for QGIS by Nancy Kapri
      Possible mentors: ???
      New idea

Both students seems are first-time participants and new to our community.

According to the new rules [0] this year we need two mentors for project to
be accepted. So I want to encourage potential mentors to register on Melange
and review proposals. Registration instructions available at the OSGeo GSoC
page [0].

Also I want to stress that proposals discussion and ranking should be done in
a private way using Melange site, private emails or any other comfortable and
private way.

Hi all.
Having other backends doting this within QGIS, I frankly doubt about the
usefulness of this project.
Sorry Nancy!
All the best.

Hey Sir,

This project is about easy accessibility for the user.This would allow the user for easy access as well as a variety of algorithms for pan-sharpening to chose from.Along with visual analysis of the results obtained from all the algorithms available for pan-sharpening.

Regards
Nancy

Hi all,

If the long term aspiration of having support for temporal data is to
support NetCDF, HDF, GRIB, etc similar to:
http://blogs.esri.com/esri/apl/2015/03/11/dimension-explorer/
then probably we need to have more to it.

Martin has done a major update of the crayfish plugin which now supports
xdmf (a variation of HDF5) and soon we are looking to add animation feature
and more file support:

Cheers,
Saber

Hi

I think the very first step in this should be to add proper date (time)
support.
I don't know the state and requirements for raster layers, but for vector
layers I think right now time is converted with the edit types just for
visualization but internally it is passed around as string. It would be nice
to handle them as QDate(Time) internally.

For time-aware databases (postgres...) this should be straightforward.
For others (like shapefile?) we probably need to manage the datatype on the
project level but conversion should IMHO happen low-level directly in the
provider code so things like timezone handling and whatever else needs to be
done can happen exactly once when the data is read from the datasource or
saved to the datasource.

Filtering (from date ... to date ) should best be done on the
QgsFeatureRequest level (setFilterExpression should already be ready I
guess)

Best,
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Pyqt4 : which signal is sent when dialog comes to

Message-ID: <CAECJsSqO7NhK9EQc9oVNXne54GYa=_=wQuVn+Y7bXwyXUjENVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm working on a Python plugin for QGIS and need your help to do something.
I'm a beginner in Python and C++ and just used plugin-builder for the
architecture.

My main dialog is a non modal one and does list print composers in the
project. It means that while it's opened, user can delete or create
composer. What I'd like is, when user calls back the dialog to foreground,
it automatically updates the list of composers. I already have the function
to update but don't find which signal to use. I can add a button to do this
but better if it can be done transparently...

I've read about defining a custom showEvent function but can't understand
where to put it and what inside.
If somebody can give some tips...

Thanks in advance,

DelazJ

Hi

not strictly related with timeseries visualization, but...
I was thinking to the time management abilities (and more) of the
Pandas python library as an abstracted data provider.
The main advantage are that on a pandas data frame, missing data can
be coded managed in a simply way.

Other than the complexity to match a data frame flexibility (m?pandas
or numpy)  with a reduce set of interactions of a data provider, there
would be also the problem to have pandas installed on osgeo4w that is
not simple at all!

Hi all, Luca
Thanks for answering. But i already have an update function that I linked to an update list button. I even linked it to the icon on the toolbar so that when user calls foreground the dialog it's already updated.
The case I'd like to manage: user can open plugin dialog and composer manager. The two dialogs are visible (to the eyes) even though composer manager is the one at foreground. He makes changes and directly clicked on the plugin dialog. He should update list but if he forgets and executes, this may lead to bug I don't want to / can't yet manage.
Reason why I want to ensure that list is always up to date when he interacts with the dialog

QgisInterface (iface) has a composerAdded and composerWillBeRemoved signal.

Did you try to connect to these?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Update datumTransformEntries on layerCrsChanged ?
Message-ID: <551A607A.3050706@gmail.com>

Hi Dev,

One of our customer discovered a bug in the couple QGIS / QGIS-Server. 
He discovered that the element layer_coordinate_transform_info, child of 
mapcanvas element, was not updated after a layer CRS changed and project 
saved. This causes some troubles in QGIS-Server, because it uses this 
element to defined CRS transformation.

I proposed a Pull-Request https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1971
If my proposed patch is accepted, I propose to backport it to 2.8 for a 
2.8.2 version.

Thanks for review.

Ren?-Luc

I am not sure if QgsDataDefined is the right place. Isn't it too high level?

There are at least 3 possibilities how to store temporal vector data:
  1. single layer with timestamp (and possibly non unique id) field
(record per timestamp)
  2. single layer with multiple fields (field per timestamp)
  3. multiple sublayers (sublayer per timestamp)
These differences should be hidden in provider, I believe.

The timestamp is just another dimension and it should be added to
QgsFeatureRequest as a new member beside mFilterRect. If the format
allows to do geometry or value interpolation (i.e. 1. with id field or
2.), it should be done in provider.

The timestamp member would be added to QgsMapSettings and set by time
navigation toolbar.

This way, everything (e.g. table, feature info) may easily use current
timestamp (table updated on QgsMapSettings.timestampChanged signal,
feature info passing current timestamp to getFeatures()).

I wasn't proposing storing this data in QgsDataDefined - what I'm
thinking is that QgsDataDefined could be extended to allow for users
to control animations. I think this would fit well into
QgsDataDefined, as it's basically just another method for overriding
symbol/label/composer properties.

So the request/provider changes would be a prerequisite, but
QgsDataDefined/QgsDataDefinedButton would then be extended to allow
users to specify how the property will react to the time variable.
Think keyframes, tweening, etc...

Matthias,
Thanks. I just give it a try it and all goes well with composerAdded.
But not really well with composerWillBeRemoved signal. The first deletion
in the composer manager does nothing and deleting a second composer does
remove the first one in my list. and so on...
My update function should be rewritten I think.  I'll try to see how
improving it and may (surely) ask again for help (if needed).

While seeking information about composerWillBeRemoved, I found a
composerRemoved [1] [2] signal (that doesn't appear in the API doc) and
without being able to use it. :(
[1]
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/composer/qgscomposermanager.cpp
(line 48
[2] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/qgisapp.cpp (line 5601)

Another thing that may not be related : what the deletePrintComposers
function (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/qgisapp.cpp line
5698) is for?

Thanks again for the clue.

You should get a parameter containing the composer that is being deleted
with composerWillBeRemoved signal. Try to use that to infer which
composer has been removed. As the signal name indicates, at the time it
is emitted, the composer is not deleted yet.
As an alternative you may make the connection with Qt.QueuedConnection.
It is possible that with this connection style you will receive the
signal after deletion and are able to continue using your current update
method.

Hi,

I've configuret QGIS Server to read the QGIS2.ini file (with
QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH envrionment variable).

In the QGIS2.ini I've put the [proxy] section with the variables filled in.

But it seems that QGIS Servers ignores these settings, is it the
normal behaviour?

You need to implement your own MatchFilter subclass and pass it to one of
the functions that use it. For example, this is how to limit search to
feature id 5:

class FidFilter(QgsPointLocator.MatchFilter):
  def __init__(self, fid):
    QgsPointLocator.MatchFilter.__init__(self)
    self.fid = fid
  def acceptMatch(self, m):
    return m.featureId() == self.fid

m = locator.nearestVertex(QgsPoint(100,200), 10, FidFilter(5))
