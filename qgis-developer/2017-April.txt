Hum Nyall,
double checking here.. (since I have a huge work load for a training course
on monday with freshly installed 2.18.5).
Is there any chance this is an easter egg?

If so, please tell us soon

No, 3.2.0 will be the LTR.

There's a four month overlap where a LTR is also the current LR.  For that time
it doesn't replace the old release in the LTR repositories.

3.0 in the LTR column is indeed wrong - that should have been more 2.18 point
releases - fixed.

I also switched the LTR and LR columns as the event refers primarily to the LR
column (maybe a source of confusion).

That's what we discussed - more time to stablize 3.x before it goes LTR.

Oh no.  Took me until wednesday to cleanup the mess - and now there's even
more.

> Totally my fault

Get in line ;)

- download.osgeo.org ran out of disc space again (had to move the symbol store
  to make room)
- I missed to dependency updated after the removal of some python ext-libs 
  after metasearch was updated in the release branches - producing uninstable
  trusty/jessie packages and broken NSIS installers.
- ubuntugis updated GDAL right after the release, breaking the fresh
  packages.
- processing saga support was broken just before the release.

On the positive side a 2.18.6 now could just take the scripts/release.pl -point
run 2.18.5 should have been.

But should we wait a while to see if there's even more?

Just want to say to both Juergen and Nyall that the amount of work you put
into QGIS is unbelievable. I'm sorry this means you have more work to do,
but for the rest of us, we get to have an even bigger version number. And
that's *better*.

Tom

Hi Etienne,

yes it's QGIS3 as you said.

I'm on a Linux Mint system and I tried with bot Cinnamon and Mate desktop.

Any other clues I can give?

Etienne, do you have a temporary workaround for this problem?

Thanks!

Matteo

Message-ID: <CAKT-DUKc-qB9An86OOgoqyUOfO2O_C8ZmnD-5U6cfoT3CMvSLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am reaching the end of my second year of university studying Computer
Science and GIS. Over the last few months, I have been switching over from
ArcGIS software to QGIS for relevant class work and projects. I have been
learning about algorithms a lot over the last few months (analyzing run
time, modifying algorithms for specific purposes, improving run time,
techniques/strategies like dynamic programming) and I am looking to
applying some of this knowledge to more practical purposes by working on
software that other people and myself use.

My actual proposal:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FVkEMk5HCy7jBCd4lgYM2pG7IjmNvml26dEkE-eyI9A/edit?usp=sharing

I would appreciate any feedback if anyone has time.

Also, as someone new around the QGIS and open source community I have some
questions.
1) For a project like the one I am proposing, do QGIS developers usually
work/communicate together on the same particular projects or is it more
individual based?
2) Are there any recommended resources for learning specific information
about working on GIS-related software?

Thanks,

Mitchell Luhm

Shouldn't it say PR in the following line?
LTR 2.18.7 2.14.15 19.05.2017 20 4

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Possibility of 2.18.6 release shortly?

Hi,

Was this bug fixed on 2.18.5-2 ? Would it be present on 2.14.13-2 as well?
If this is a major bug maybe 2.18.4 should be the default on the download
page till it fixed ?

No, starting with 2.18.7 2.18 will be tagged LTR.  Not changing much otherwise
as 2.18 will continue to be the LR.

Message-ID: <CAECJsSq7CaO+ruszLP6hTQkf7pP=qj=TV3i3itRNsjJHWEhQOw@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi devs,

In the documentation team, we plan to rewrite the "Supported data formats"
chapter (http://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_
vector/supported_data.html) which actually explores many of the different
ways to add (vector) layers to QGIS. It's full of redundant information,
not easy to maintain and doesn't expose tools like the browser panel.
Discussion at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/1088
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/1088.> if you want to
help.
Before we engage any time on this restructuring and to avoid doing things
twice and because I read some related assertions in the past, I'd like to
ask if there's any plan to merge some of these tools for 3.0... And if
ever, what's the state of the work ?

Thanks for any information,
Harrissou

I was wondering why the CMakeLists.txt file made no use of this CMake feature, doesn’t it work or is there some other reason?

 

Rather than `make -j4` or `make -j8` this might make it automatic.

 

>From Cmake documentation on ProcessorCount valid for AIX, cygwin, FreeBSD, HPUX, IRIX, Linux, Mac OS X, QNX, Sun and Windows:

ProcessorCount(N)

if(NOT N EQUAL 0)

  set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS -j${N})

  set(ctest_test_args ${ctest_test_args} PARALLEL_LEVEL ${N})

endif()

Using all CPUs by default is not very nice. Only on dedicated build
machines is using all cores a good default, on other systems at least
one core needs to remain available for the systems other tasks.

Hi Gordon,

As an alternative, you can use the -GNinja argument which will cause
CMake to generate a project that uses ninja instead of make. Ninja does
some smart things by default, like for example using multiple cores in
parallel.
Many of the QGIS devs started to appreciate this.

Thanks.  I will try it.  

Without hard coding, how does one propagate to sub-folders?  
I would like to use it also in building PyQt5 and that has about 10 sub-folders with Makefiles.

That only works for CMake based projects.

I don't know if there's a possibility to use ninja with PyQt5, it's best
to resort to -jN there afaik.

This has been discussed a number of times, and Nathan made some initial mockups once. But as far as I know, nobody is actively working on this so I don't know if anything will land in 3.0. 

One suggestion would be to focus the bulk of the documentation on showing how to use the browser panel and then save the dialogs for special cases (e.g. using OGR::Protocol etc.). My rationale for this is that I suspect that any unified add vector dialog in the future would use the browser widget as its basis. Also in my experience many users miss the fact that the browser panel exists so it would be good to make it more 'front and center'.

Thank you and the rest of the docs team for all the hard work you are doing!

Regards

Tim

​I've been working with my "unified add layer button" modification for a
few months now:
https://anitagraser.com/2016/07/20/one-add-button-to-rule-them-all/​

Wouldn't want to go back. I still sometimes use the Add PostGIS layer
dialog from the menus though.

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Core Plugin Policies QEP
Message-ID: <4C66D607-B84B-4DF6-B112-9BE2258F2557@kartoza.com>

Hi All

At our last PSC meeting we discussed the situation about core plugin policy, touching on things like:

* where plugins in core should actually be plugins
* which plugins should be in core
* what the policy should be for including new plugins in core

I have drafted a short QEP: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/93 <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/93> that goes into a little more detail. It would be great to have your feedback in the QEP comments that we can incorporate into the QEP and eventually put into our up and coming developers guide docs (http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/ <http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/>).

Tim

Thanks Tim, I have read it and I found it very good.
All the best.

Hi all

I must say that Anita's hack seems quite handy and straight forward from a
user's perspective. Would it be heavy to "just" integrate into the Master
QGIS? I would be happy to help with testing. More, I unfortunately cannot
do :-)

Cheers

Stéphane

Hi,
Thanks Anita for this work. I wasn't aware of your tool. Any reason to not
make it available in the Plugins repo? It might get more audience, unless I
overestimate our repo... Btw: I like the title of the blog post. :-)

So other than Anita's plugin, there's currently no ongoing work to unify
the tools.
>From a doc writer's perspective, it's ok; we'll see how we structure the
chapter.
>From a user's one, would be nice to have things moved in the way of a
unified tool in the next releases. Landing in 3.0 could even sound like a
big change between 2.x series and 3.0. Maybe, taking Anita's work as a
first step and ....

Regards,
Harrissou

Next on the list are
 * processing
 * the browser to give it a bigger exposure (see also discussion about
unified add layer)
 * the attribute table (F6 shortcut should be in the toolbar icon tooltip)
 * More?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Spatialite KyngChaos packaging on OSX not loading
	spatialite extension
Message-ID: <0BACCE40-8364-4F89-A0D7-81DD4297254B@3liz.com>

Hi,


For some times some people are reporting that plugins using pyspatialite are not working anymore  with the KyngChaos packaging for OSX (2.14 or 2.18)

The error is usually:

OperationalError('no such module: VirtualSpatialIndex',)

when trying to référence SpatialIndex in spatial requests.
After investigation it appears that errors occurs when trying to use spatialite functions…

The fact is, when using pyspatialite directly from python: the spatialite extension is not loaded.

cur.execute('SELECT spatialite_version()')
> OperationalError: no such function: spatialite_version

and so on for any SELECT involving spatialite functions.

This can be explained easily has the pyspatialite python package is only a link to the pysqlite2 python package, and thus, do not load the the spatialite module. 

Furthemore loading extension is disabled in the KyngChaos sqlite3 package, so we are stuck in that the pyspatialite provided by KyngChaos is useless as standalone library and do not enable plugins to make direct calls to  spatialite.


Is there any reason for this situation or this should be considered as a bug ?? 

Actually, the native OSX sqlite3 python binding do not enable leading extensions, this was preventing using spatialite from python. This constraint has been removed recently in Macport, which now enables to use spatialite with python without relying on pyspatialite.



David.

	Azimuth/Bearing - API Documentation
Message-ID: <CABPxTTp3KwYQCMMeTaqnYwXQWWKiewf0r5ovnvC97PHiuKbnkQ@mail.gmail.com>

I had been wondering what algorithm is being used for the methods azimuth,
distance, and  project in the QgsPoint class, but in looking at the code it
is simply cartesian plane math. It looks like the qgsdistancearea class is
using vincinty math if I am examining the code correctly.

Vincinty is more accurate than the great circle, but fails in some cases
and there are more accurate methods. I apologize if I have failed to find
the right classes and methods in the API, but why doesn't the API provide
the more accurate geodesic calculations that are in geographiclib. It also
seems like it would be good to also provide great circle math as an option.
Am I missing it in the API or is it simply not there? If it is not there is
anyone working on adding it?

Are there any efforts going on to flesh out the QGIS API a little more.
Generally, the methods and parameters are not well documented if it is not
obvious from the name.

Thanks,

Calvin

As we have to(?) stick with Redmine (rather then moving to github) and
try update/upgrade
the platform I strongly believe that we should do a deep cleanup of
our Redmine instance *before* upgrading. This would include close all
subprojects (asking kindly to plugin authors to move on to github, as
many have already done)

and -in my opinion-

all the tickets (at least the bug ones) that are years that are
untouched/not updated: I really can't see any advantage in keeping
open tickets that is clear now that no one will ever look at, and no
one (even the users) seems to be bothered by. If some of them is
really important this will naturally be reopened. If they are not they
can serve as reference, but closed, eventually with a specific text
stating the reason why it was closed.

sounds like a plan? not sure if I can help with the above process, but
I could certainly with the cleaning before the update/upgrade.

looking for some consensus here, hopefully before Essen.

thanks

since this email two more important regressions (in 2.18 since 2.14)
have been found and reported:

* "hidden" widget is broken
* maptips with expression to show local images is broken

"just" shut them down no, we can send a mail and say that they will be
shut down. Moving is something that many have already done (for
instance I was forced because someone had deleted a repo of mine on
Redmine, but I dind't made any fuss about it). Making the
platform/redmine update/upgrade and leaving the mess that there is now
it would be really a pity.

see my previous email. If no one cares (not even the users), why keep
them open? they can serve well as reference even closed, and if they
are really important bugs they will be naturally reopened.

One way or the other a decision must be taken.

I already use the "feedback" label to close tickets that do not
receive an update in more than 15 days. As any others my time is
scarce, so those 15 days frequently become weeks, and my focus is on
high priority tickets and regressions because the "normal" bug queue
is too large to be able to be managed only in spare time (this is the
main reason to close all the tickets that didn't received *any*
attention in years).

Hi Tim,


> Do you mean like a monthly effort to dedicate some funds for bug fixing? I'd certainly like to see us heading that way, and even better where QGIS.org hires full time bug fixers / developers to work only for the good of the general project and not to serve a specific client. Andreas can speak better to the ability to do anything right now - but I suspect we might need to wait till next year if we want to budget for more substantial (e.g. monthly) paid bug fixing rounds.

regressions in 2.18 (since 2.14) are piling up. I'm sure that working
3/4 days on testing tracker triage in Essen I will find more.

cheers!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plans for Processing algorithms documentation
Message-ID: <CAECJsSon4v_JmoX4LiAEqwFoX2uho6hub+4QiOencuC2dwX7pg@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi Devs,
(me looking again for plans...)

Currently, if you are looking for help for a Processing Tool, most of of
the tools will only display their description in QGIS application except if
they are from GRASS, GDAL/OGR (or any other provider I do not check).
Native QGIS tools show only their description, when it's filled, and this
is done only in english (see http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.
nabble.com/Are-Processing-algorithms-helps-not-translatable-td5309621.html).
The way to have a more complete decription (tool and parameters) is to look
into the Processing algorithms chapter (http://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/
docs/user_manual/processing_algs/index.html) in User manual. But given that
this is a handmade update, it's far from completion, not all the tools are
available (focusing only QGIS native tools) and not all the parameters are
filled.

So, given QEP51 (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/5
1) and https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/issues/62 which made some great
improvements on linking user manual and application context help, are there
some improvements planned on processing? What I'd need to know is:
- whether algorithms documentation will be done in application repo or doc
repo?
- What would algorithms documentation look like? i.e do we keep the same
structure/template?
- what's the status of the external resources (I'm not sure they are kept
updated) as discussed in the qep? Do we keep their help file in
application? in doc repo? (seems there's a mix currently)

Why these questions?:
- Doc repo is full of Processing tagged issues (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues?utf8=%E2%
9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20processing - not exhaustive) and we need
to know what are the plans to avoid wasting our energy
- From QGIS2.16 we have moved many C++ Core plugins (fTools, GdalTools,
Heatmap, geometry snapper, interpolation...) to Processing so description
of these plugins (http://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/
docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins_index.html) must somehow be removed from
the plugins chapter in user manual (a pending PR at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/1806 which actually made me
write this message) and reorganized in processing section. Some plugins
were briefly described while others were really detailed:
  *  What are the information to keep for Processing?
  *  In which form, given that the way their description is written doesn't
match processing algorithms doc template?
- last but not least, I recently read a thread  in which someone was
looking for ways to help documenting algorithms (very precise offer but why
not, any help is welcome!!) and I fail to find a proper answer to give him
other than his help is welcome.

So, if some of you have any idea/plan on what processing algorithms
documentation is supposed to evolve to, please share your knowledge...

Regards,
Harrissou

​Thanks Harrissou! No good reason why it's not in the rep really. Mostly,
because it's just 10 lines of code added to a plugin tempalte and requires
manual GUI customization to remove all the redundant add layer icons.

I'll put it on Github and publish it.

Best wishes,
Anita

agreed, this it a point of great importance, one of most common

once closed, nobody will see them. It is a reality that long standing
issues are sometimes picked up by someone and fixed, even after years.
To me closing a valid issue just because nobody is working on it is like
hiding the dust under the carpet.
IMHO thickets should be closed on their merit, i.e. if they are not
valid, or not reproducible.
All the best.

​+1 Just because no user has added to an existing ticket for a while does
not mean that nobody cares or encounters it. It just means that they had
nothing new to add.

	vector layers
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=zFmOSMtPPudxKd8+LLAWCZnhN73vUCEdwt6pdv8Qx_Mg@mail.gmail.com>

I've noticed that when a (OGR) layer has a filter expression applied on it,
processing algorithms perform worse.
I have tested several polygon layers with some thousands of features. If I
do, e.g., an intersection, it takes a lot more if I apply a filter that
reduces the number of features to some dozens, then without filtering.

I guess it can be caused by the extra work that the feature irerator has to
do with the filter (request with expression) but it's an unexpected
behaviour, at least for many of my courses partecipants.

Tested on QGIS 2.14.10 and 2.18.4.

There are some old enhancement tickets I still keep in mind. As long as they 
are there, not everything is lost :)

Dear QGIS Developers,

I think QGIS would benefit adding the following features;
if you find them interesting they may be added to QGIS 3.0:

1 - Better support for Spatialite tables:

it is now impossible to remove columns from a spatialite
table, i know it's not supported by SQLite but there is a
simple work around that consists in creating a new table
without the removed column/s

2 - Save project data into SQLite/Spatialite db:

this would grant users the choice to save all the work
in one unique file ( data, layer style ), very handy for
backups and sharing/shipping

i'm not a c++ developer but i can help with docs
and testing.
best regards,

Roy.

Hi Anita

To go one step further :-) Any reason why it couldn't be polished and
directly integrated in the core? As a non-developer, I maybe underestimate
the workload here? Isn't it something that could "easily" be done by one of
the core developers without requiring substantial additional funding?

I think such unified button would be very helpful, especially for beginners
(who don't intuitively understand yet the difference between vector,
raster, etc.) and I would hate to start a GIS introduction by saying
"First, you'll have to download and install a plugin" :-)

It also would be a good way to catch former ArcGIS users, who grew up used
to such a unified approach.

All the best

Stéphane

Hi Roy,

These are both addressed for geopackage already.

Number one is a core feature (thanks to Even Rouault), number two is a
plugin called "qgpkg" (thanks to Sourcepole) and would IMO really be a
good candidate for core functionality.

I think there is a ticket on Redmine or Github on this issue. Maybe you can
locate and revive it.

Thanks a lot Anita for the info!

I re-located the issue: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9451

Not sure though if this will make it alive again. Let's see if this seems
to be a priority for enough users...

All the best

I'd say a good plan to move this forward would be to:

1. conduct a thorough survey of what's available via the individual
add vector layer dialogs vs what's currently available in the browser
2. rank each of the missing settings vs whether or not they are still required
3. file issues for these missing settings
4. ...and get these fixed/implemented

a. While this is underway I'd also suggest the UX team could test and
evaluate Anita's plugin to identify whether the browser alone is a
sufficient replacement or whether some tweaks would be required to
make it a suitable replacement without any loss of "user friendliness"

1,2,3 and (a) don't require any development experience, so would be a
great project for any interested user to undertake. I suspect 4
wouldn't be much work for a developer either after all this groundwork
is done.

Message-ID: <1491293773293-5315610.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

I'm looking at writing a Processing plugin, but I have some incredibly basic
questions, as I've never really used Processing myself:

1. Can a Processing plugin only take a single layer as input, or can it take
more?

2. Can a Processing plugin take *any* layer, rather than having to choose
between raster and vector?

3. Must a Processing plugin output a layer?

I'm sure I'll have more, so apologies in advance.

Thanks

Tom

Hi All

Thanks for your patience waiting for the grant proposals to be announced. I am pleased to say we have 13 really great proposals this round. You can read all about it here:

It can take several one-layer parameters (so, in the end, there is a
fixed number of them), or take a multiple-layer parameter, which is a
single parameter but the user can select a list with an undetermined
number of layers (even an empty list, if allowed)

No, not at the moment. The multiple input can have several layer types
at once, but single layers can't

No. It can output layers, tables, numbers, string...in any combination
you want, just like input parameters

Hope this helps

Great to see the new logo prominently featured on the 1st page.

BTW, you might want to update your signature to make use of the new logo
too.

How about outputting nothing at all (in a Processing context, I mean)? I
presume that is also acceptable? Or is the best approach in such a case to
output the inputs, as it were?

just for my understanding, can you shortly explain the use-case?

Depends on the algorithm. If the algorithm modifies a layer, it is a
good idea to output that same layer, so then it can be linked to a new
algorithm in the modeler. If your algorithm does something that doesn
not "produce" anything at all (for instance, the GeoServer pluin has
Processing algs to deploy a layer to a GeoServer instance), then it's
ok to not have any output

Both options are accepted by the Processing syntax

OSGeo4W has 2.18.5-2 and a -2 for LTR. Don't know if those caught all the
major issues.

I don't know Lizmap, but I wouldn't say it's a bug. JSONP can be loaded in
from anywhere, without having to configure CORS. It's therefore arguably the
best export format for geo vector data, if you don't know where it is going
to be hosted. It's what qgis2web exports, too.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Update on the work we are doing for an overhauled
 metadata system in QGIS 3.0
Message-ID: <7106D6C3-CFC7-4E33-825A-090C2762A5E1@kartoza.com>

Hi devs and users (with apologies for cross posting)

I just wanted to raise a bit of awareness for the work we are doing to build a new metadata system for the upcoming QGIS 3.0 release. We are planning to work in phases, with the current work addressing the first 5 'work packages', namely:

1) Defining a well thought out but simple QGIS specific schema for internal representation of metadata (led by Angelos Tzotsos)
2) Implementing a QgsMetadata utility class that will be a property of every map layer in QGIS (led by Nyall Dawson)
3) Implementing a data store for storing metadata (led by Joana Simoes)
4) Implementing a metadata viewer for layer metadata (see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4316 for the first work landing already on this) (led by myself and Etienne Trimaille)
8) Implement a metadata editor for layer metadata (led by myself and Etienne Trimaille)

You can find out more about these work packages at our QEP (QGIS Enhancement Proposal) here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/91

There are a number of other work packages (5-7, 9-12) that we plan to implement in a follow up round which deal with project ('service') level metadata, along with some other great things we have in mind for metadata down the line. Items 1,2,4 and 8 above are currently funded (thanks to our friends at WorldBank/GFDRR (https://www.gfdrr.org) and NINA(http://www.nina.no/english)). Item 3 above is still in need of funding (8,500 USD) so if your organisation can help, please contact me! If you can't help with funding, we would still love to get your feedback - particularly on the metadata schema that has been developed by Angelos Tzotsos and Joana Simoes. You can find their proposed schema here: 

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4330/files

We encourage you to make inline comments in the pull request or contact us offlist to discuss if needed.

Best regards

Tim

What can i do to use gdal's readAsArray method in my code?
Thank you.

Thanks Mattias for the info,

I do not have a predetermined preference
between geopackage and spatialite

if you don't mind,

i do not know very well the gpkg format but
I understand that it's not spatialite.

I'd like to understand the pros or cons
between the two formats

does geopackage support:

-SQLite SQL language with triggers
joins aggregate etc..

-SQL spatial query

-coordinate tranformation

-SQL VIEWS

-non spatial tables

-i mean is it a fully featured database
or does it uses another language ?

-High level difference beetween geopackage
and spatialite?

I can grasp spatialite in 5 min knowing
that i'ts a fully featured SQL relational database
but cannot wrap my head around geopackage:

"GeoPackage Encoding Standard governs the rules and requirements of content
stored in a GeoPackage container" ...so is geopackage a set of rules on 
how data
should be store into an SQLite database?

in the end (for now) i find spatialite much more
intuitive and i think QGIS would benefit
supporting at least point 1 (drop column from spatialite)

thanks for any insight, Roy.

Hi Dev,

I'd like to test a way to update layer variables like edited_feature_id 
when the QgsAttributeDialog will be displayed.

So I'd like to know if there is a signal to connect to it to know when a 
QgsAttributeDialog will be displayed.

Thanks,

Hi all

there have been a few additions in the Gdoc already (not sure from whom)
but I don't know if this is already sufficient for developers to take this
up?

Also, I am not sure how to reach out to the UX team. Through a separate
mailing list? Or is it sufficient to have it here
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3_UIX_discussion/issues/1 ?

Cheer

Stéphane

Hi Stéphane,
actually there's no more UX team (list). UX mailing list has been shut down
months ago because it used to refer to dev list for most of
decisions/advices so UX matters are now discussed either in the dev mailing
list (we maybe can keep this thread) or, I guess until QGIS3 release, in
the qgis3_UIX_discussion repository.


Regards,
Harrissou

Hi,

though not fully into the technical details, I know that gpkg is a
sqlite db too; see [0] and [1], AND it is an open standard.

Here: [2] you can read about descisions made why a new standard format
is created and not took the already excisting spatialite.

Using the 'spatialite_gui' I can open a gpkg package too.

Using sqlitebrowser [3] also...

I think it is good if as GIS / FOSS community we focus on one good
standard package, so please give it a try :-)
And please let us/me know what you miss (well one thing I would have to
had in the standard is a standardized way of setting layer order and
styling, independent on styling language or GIS used... :-) )...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

	QGIS
Message-ID: <1f24c445ded44051bf5170bb07b24b83@hsr.ch>

Hi,

I am Simran, an intern at the Institute for Software in HSR Rapperswil. I have come up with some Custom Python Expression functions for QGIS. They are:


1. hstore_get_value(), hstore_exist(), hstore_contains_key_value() and hstore_contains_hstore() :

These functions can search for keys and values in hstore strings. They are useful for selecting features based on their tags, which are of hstore type.



2. maxofallvaluesplusone('fieldName')

Given a field name, this function returns 1 + the maximum of all values in that field. It is useful for automatically generating a unique id (for example fid) every time the user adds a new feature to a layer.


You can find the functions on Github: https://github.com/simran001/custom-expression-functions


Please let me know if I should publish these functions as part of the QGIS Resource Sharing Plugin, or if it would be a better idea to make a pull request at https://github.com/NathanW2/qgsexpressionsplus.


Thanks!


Best regards,

Simran

Thanks for the fix, when would I see the next weekly?
I prefer a standalone installer which only available for weekly.

but we agree that we need some clean up is needed? if yes then we
could ask issuers (of tickets that are not updated since a long) to
confirm or dismiss the issue in a reasonable amount of time, if no
answer is given then close the ticket.

I have also not received any feedback other than Paolo's about the
projects hosted on Redmine that are not QGIS. I see also that Redmine
is hosting yet a whole lot of wiki pages, I was under the assumption
that those were going to be migrated to docs and/or moved to GH and
removed from Redmine.

Trying to get some feedback here in time for Essen...

Hi Jürgen,

Thanks for the fix, bit it seems that something is still wrong with
2.99.0-14 that was just built.
The size of x86 version is 396MB similar to build 8, but the size of the
x64 build is just 29MB.
Both match their md5sum.

I took the liberty to do some changes to the doc (especially add a new
table with more detailed features on the existing tools + comments). It's
supposed to replace the table already drafted but I didn't go so far
without a review.

I see 6 bug reports assigned to me and I'm going to sort them out for QGIS 3. 

It would be great if everybody could review all tickets assigned to her/him 
and close or release those you're not going to fix. Then we can review those 
unassigned and probably close as won'tfix.

Can it? If I add a multiple input, the dropdown only contains my project's
point (vector) layers. If I explicitly set the datatype for the
ParameterMultipleInput to -1 (see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/tools/dataobjects.py#L53),
the dropdown correctly contains all my vector layers (point, line, and
poly).

What I was hoping for is to able to take *any* layer - vector or raster.
However, datatype ALL_TYPES (defined as [-1] at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/tools/dataobjects.py#L51)
fails, as it won't accept a list:

File "C:/OSGEO4~1/apps/qgis/./python/plugins\processing\core\parameters.py",
line 362, in __init__
			    self.datatype = int(float(datatype))
			TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number

I'm clearly not quite understanding this yet. Can anyone help?

Thanks

Tom

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Merge by directory
Message-ID: <CAABe9fb64pwd=v+KLSB4FntTHLeuKy9pyeUtdW4Yead-5jQkpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Just now I noticed that the functionality to merge all shapefiles from a
directory is gone. I have directories with tons of shapefiles and I want to
simply merge them all together, if I have to select all of them sometimes
the explorer GUI gets unresponsive for a while due to the amount of data
and the same happens when I add them all to the merging tool.

Why did this option went away? Can't it get back as previously?

Thanks,
Caio.

Hi Matteo,

Indeed, it was worth the wait. This is more than what I expected when
opening this thread. Nice plan you have, Alexander and you: it will
certainly push QGIS help system to a new level...
In the case your offer is accepted, will there be a qep to discuss how the
new help tab will be structured?

Regards,
Harrissou

Who is the liaison officer for QGIS' GSoC proposals? There was an
email from Margherita Di Leo on the OSGeo-GSoC list about the liaison
officer having to review submitted proposals, but I didn't see anyone
claiming to be the QGIS liaison officer.

There are currently five QGIS proposals in the system, and only one of
them has any mentors signed up at the moment. Projects without two
mentors will automatically fail on April 11th.

I think all projects will fail on April 11th if a QGIS Liaison Officer
hasn't reviewed the proposals.

Sorry if the qgis-dev list isn't the right place to ask this, I
imagined the Liaison Officer would be someone on the developer team.

Thanks for bringing this up Barry!
It really seems that QGIS has got enough proposals to work on, but we
are in heavy need of mentors.

It might be the students "fault" to just expect that "somebody" will
take mentorship anyway while in reality they should actively _search
and ask_ for mentors.

I still hope QGIS will make it and can only say I hope that there will
be some developers willing to take mentorship.

There is still a week left to take brief look at the proposals.

We could do something like an internal ranking and survey about the
proposals but still - we have to few mentors.

So please any developers willing step up and give new developers a
chance to get deeper into QGIS.

As a member of the QGIS community and currently helping osgeo-gsoc
admin team I would really like to see QGIS in the GsoC projects.

regards
Werner

Quick summary for anyone interested:

There's five projects:

 * My remote-control API project which has a strong student and two
signed-up mentors, me as main mentor.

 * A QGIS-PySAL (spatial analysis library) integration project which
also looks like a good student. I'll co-mentor that but it needs a
main mentor to do most of the work with the student.

 * Two projects that seem to be about improving vector geoprocessing
algorithms, which I would have thought were libGEOS's business, but
the students don't mention libGEOS which worries me.  No mentors
signed up.

 * A project on raster uncertainty visualisation that is working on
improving and extending the students' existing plugin. No mentors
signed up.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Geometry validation consistency issues
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=w+LR-vSoXx3Pdcd0O9creffnui0e8+9w5AKQPGjz9-Dg@mail.gmail.com>

One of the most discussed topics during my workshops is geometry validation.

As you know not all softwares agree on geometry validity, but we have an
OGC specification that most FOSS softwares adopt which define validity with
good detail. We can agree on it or not, but I think we cannot accept having
different tools behaving differently.

Topology validator and QgsGeometryValidator (which is use by Processing
Check Geometry algorithm) give different results in case of a
"self-intersecting polygon which defines a (false) hole".
I use this definition as a translation of
the GEOSVALID_ALLOW_SELFTOUCHING_RING_FORMING_HOLE GEOS flag which is used
by the QgsGeometryValidator. This flag make GEOS validator stick with
Esri's point of view, so the following polygon is ok for it but not for OGC:

POLYGON ((200 400, 400 400, 400 200, 300 200, 350 250, 250 250, 300 200,
200 200, 200 400))

If you test its validity in Spatialite or PostGIS with ST_IsValid, or if
you test it with the Topology Validation tool, you will obtain that it's
not valid.
If you test it with Check Geometry algorithm it will result as valid.

Here the source lines of the two validations:

Topology validator:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/plugins/topology/topolTest.cpp#L871
QgsGeometryValidator:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsgeometryvalidator.cpp#L231

If we want to mantain the opportunity to set that flag, we should manage it
as an option.
>From the user point of view maybe it should be an additional parameter to
set/unset. Something like "OGC strict validity" or maybe something more
meaningful for the layman.

	QThread
Message-ID: <f8faf686-603b-4735-2c81-52292df11e52@nmbu.no>

Trying to make a plugin work in QGIS 3, I am facing problems
when using the QgsGeometryAnalyzer buffer function in a QThread.
In QGIS 2 (with Qt4) there were no such issues.

If I try to use the QgsGeometryAnalyzer buffer function in a
thread, I get Qt error messages:

"QObject::killTimer: Timers cannot be stopped from another thread"
"QObject::~QObject: Timers cannot be stopped from another thread"

and after a while (about a minute) QGIS crashes.

Are there known threading issues with the QgsGeometryAnalyzer
functions in QGIS 3 / Qt5?

OK, I've got a rough version running. Another question: any guidelines on
appropriate values for:

- provider name (myProvider.getName())
- provider description (myProvider.getDescription())
- algorithm name (myAlgorithm.name)
- algorithm group (myAlgorithm.group)

Given that this algorithm exports a webmap, is there an appropriate group
already in existence? Or should I just make my own decisions? There might be
multiple algorithms in my provider in the future.

Thanks

Tom

PS  Thanks to Nyall for suggesting this as an interesting project. We'll see
if users actually find it useful or not...

I looked and it the QgsProcessingAlgorithm class in (now?) directly as
C++ in core.. is the issue related to this?


someone can help?!


Thanks!

Nyall is in the process of porting the core Processing algorithms to C++. I
guess that's the root cause, but I don't know anything more specific.

Hey Simran,

Nice work on making some custom expressions.   I'm happy to take a pull
request for my expressions plus plugin to allow other people to use them.

Send me a PR with the changes and I can merge them for you.

Regards,
Nathan

Yes... but those bindings should exist if you're building master. I'd
try a totally clean build by wiping away your whole build folder (you
can leave the CMakeCache.txt file to avoid having to resetup your
cmake parameters).

It's possible this may relate to your processing layout issue too...

yep, no more importing complaining.. :)


> It's possible this may relate to your processing layout issue too...

for the layouts.......
I made some other workarounds... and that's the situation:

I have the qgis_customwidgets.py file here:

/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyQt5/uic/widget-plugins/qgis_customwidgets.py

I put it there manually because I wanted to see the QGIS Custom Widgets
in Qt Designer (see old discussion here [0])..

if I **remove** this file from there, boom, Processing and all other UI
are fine, even if I have this error at the start:


  File
"/home/matteo/lavori/QGIS/build-qgis3/output/python/qgis/utils.py", line
647, in _import
    mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)
ImportError: No module named 'qgscollapsiblegroupbox'


but I don't have the QGIS widgets in Qt anymore..

this thing is driving me crazy....


Cheers

Matteo

Hi QGIS team could you please approve Lat Lon Tools 0.7.1? I found that
some QGIS installations do not support 'import builtins'. I am not sure why
it works on some, but not on others. I have a user trying to install it
from the plugin repo and I updated 0.7.1 to not use builtins. I have told
him how to install it manually, but I think he is waiting for it to be
updated in the plugin repo.

Thanks,

C. Hamilton

maybe max_incremented('fieldName') as a candidate for a less verbose name?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] (python) access to QgsHillshadeRenderer of raster
	layer ?
Message-ID: <CAKdk67tCE1xw7U2sxdDAo8pg3Wm7wMqUm4fg5oCve7OMoV3mzQ@mail.gmail.com>

I cannot figure how I can access the .altitude() and .azimuth() functions
of the QgsHillshadeRenderer implementing the QgsRasterRenderer of
a QgsRasterLayer.

I can get the QgsRasterRenderer via the .renderer() function of the
QgsRasterLayer and it return the correct 'hillshade' type via .type() but I
cannot get further.

Any hints ? Do i need to use .writeXML into a Document to get these values ?

Responding to myself.

It turns out it is possible to use renderer.writeXML to access altitude and
azimuth values:

#r = rasterlayer.renderer()
import PyQt4.QtXml as qx
doc = qx.QDomDocument()
lElement=doc.createElement('rasterlayer') #some required parent tag
r.writeXML(doc, lElement)
rElement=lElement.firstChild().toElement()
azimuth_string=rElement.attribute('azimuth')

Pretty involved but doable. Looks like I get better used to QtXml. It seems
better than python ElementTree anyways.
Or is there another way ?

How 'heavy' is importing QtXml from a Python perspective ? Something to be
avoided ?

Thanks, Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] logic in processing models
Message-ID: <CAKdk67sqP3zVANLGhSsyMqKWzGJasfpJ7jffu1728-fE=tUy=Q@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking for a way to let a user choose in a model between different,
alternative algorithms (or other models). An example would be a simple
model which reprojects a vector layer either to WGS84 or NAD27 based on a
boolean input field.
I know I can use runscript in a custom processing scripts and add the logic
with python. But is there a way to do this with a model as well ?
Essentially, I am thinking of algorithm which has two inputs of type
algorithm (and bool and the actual data layer) which probably need to have
the same output types.
Or perhaps there is a better way to think about introducing logic in models.
Thanks, Andreas

Thanks. Yes, they are there. The problem is I cannot find a way to get to
the QgisHillshadeRenderer itself, from the QgsRasterLayer.
QgsRasterLayer.renderer() only provides QgsRasterRenderer. Anyways, the
.writeXML approach works well enough. [ It is a bit strange that the
altitude is named angle as an xml attribute. ]

Ideally, I would want to get the lightAzimuth and lightAltitude values from
the hillshaderendererwidget used in the layer properties gui . Is there a
way to get that from a processing python script (or plugin)? The idea is to
use existing values provided in the nice existing GUIs as much as possible.

There was a missing sip cast for QgsHillshadeRenderer - without this
in place you only get access to the common QgsRasterRenderer methods.

It's fixed in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/8cf5860d72e6c7d4c7345b3a880020263549a93c

Hi Mr. Sutton and Prof Keller,


Thanks for the suggestion. I've renamed the function to max_incremented('fieldName').

Hi,
I am Simran, an intern at the Institute for Software in HSR Rapperswil. I have come up with some Custom Python Expression functions for QGIS. They are:

1. hstore_get_value(), hstore_exist(), hstore_contains_key_value() and hstore_contains_hstore() :

These functions can search for keys and values in hstore strings. They are useful for selecting features based on their tags, which are of hstore type.



2. maxofallvaluesplusone('fieldName')

maybe max_incremented('fieldName') as a candidate for a less verbose name?

Margherita Di Leo just sent out a reminder on the osgeo-gsoc-mentors
list that reviews need doing by tomorrow or the projects automatically
fail.

Alex appears to have gone very quiet - are you there? Can you do the
GSoC reviews? Do you need help? Can someone else do them? I'd do it
but as a proposed mentor I might be somewhat biased...

I think it might look bad if QGIS fails to engage with the OSgeo GSoC process.

Hey Simran,

Nice work on making some custom expressions.   I'm happy to take a pull request for my expressions plus plugin to allow other people to use them.

Send me a PR with the changes and I can merge them for you.

Regards,
Nathan

Hi,

I am Simran, an intern at the Institute for Software in HSR Rapperswil. I have come up with some Custom Python Expression functions for QGIS. They are:


1. hstore_get_value(), hstore_exist(), hstore_contains_key_value() and hstore_contains_hstore() :

These functions can search for keys and values in hstore strings. They are useful for selecting features based on their tags, which are of hstore type.



2. maxofallvaluesplusone('fieldName')

Given a field name, this function returns 1 + the maximum of all values in that field. It is useful for automatically generating a unique id (for example fid) every time the user adds a new feature to a layer.


You can find the functions on Github: https://github.com/simran001/custom-expression-functions


Please let me know if I should publish these functions as part of the QGIS Resource Sharing Plugin, or if it would be a better idea to make a pull request at https://github.com/NathanW2/qgsexpressionsplus.


Thanks!


Best regards,

Simran

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Grant Proposals Round #2

Hi all,
Reviewing the excellent proposals for Grant applications #2, I realized
that I had to advertize some on going work:

1- Proposal ​11 SHARING QGIS PROJECTS AND RESOURCES WITHIN GEOPACKAGES.

This was discussed a number of times before. We (Oslandia) have funding to
realize the auxiliary storage QEP and this should land in QGIS 3.2.  ( see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/27)
This work has been discussed in details before into the QEP. May I ask
Joana Simoes to participate into the QEP page so that we could merge the
two approaches and merge efforts ? That would be awesome!


2- Feature vs. Quality tasks

I remember well the poll we made to ask users if they wanted more feature
or more stability and the results largely in favor of new features.
I really think all low level refactoring, test, build and documentation
should be taken well into consideration by voting members. Features are
appealing and fun, and they probably will find their way to funding more
easily than the not fun ones. I see Grant Application as great to
opportunity to rebalance those natural tendancies a bit.
 Oh, and I have no interest in saying that, having pushed a "Feature"
proposal. :o)

Cheers and thanks for the huge work made here,
Régis

Hi devs,
QGIS Server code continues to be updated and enhanced.

After refactoring the code like proposed in the 
QGIS-Enhancement-Proposal 74 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/74 with QGIS 
Server Services as plugins like providers.

The work on enhancing the code and removing QgsWxsProjectParser is in 
progress:
* WCS refactoring is done https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4157
* WFS refactoring is proposed https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4344
* WMS refactoring has started with the GetMap request 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4313

Hello all,

At Boundless we are planning to put some development time in this "unified
add layer" button/feature. As others already did, our idea was to use the
browser panel as a base for replacing most of the buttons and add any
capabilities that are still missing.

So, let's work together to find what are those missing pieces, and how it
would be the best way to implement it. We will put our thoughts in the
Google document. As soon we have it stabilized we can start creating a QEP
for it.

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

I took the liberty to remove the first table (that I created) and to leave
only yours. It is more complete anyway

Hi Stéphane,
actually there's no more UX team (list). UX mailing list has been shut down
months ago because it used to refer to dev list for most of
decisions/advices so UX matters are now discussed either in the dev mailing
list (we maybe can keep this thread) or, I guess until QGIS3 release, in
the qgis3_UIX_discussion repository.

Hi all

there have been a few additions in the Gdoc already (not sure from whom)
but I don't know if this is already sufficient for developers to take this
up?

Also, I am not sure how to reach out to the UX team. Through a separate
mailing list? Or is it sufficient to have it here
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3_UIX_discussion/issues/1 ?

Cheer

Stéphane

I'd say a good plan to move this forward would be to:

1. conduct a thorough survey of what's available via the individual
add vector layer dialogs vs what's currently available in the browser
2. rank each of the missing settings vs whether or not they are still
required
3. file issues for these missing settings
4. ...and get these fixed/implemented

a. While this is underway I'd also suggest the UX team could test and
evaluate Anita's plugin to identify whether the browser alone is a
sufficient replacement or whether some tweaks would be required to
make it a suitable replacement without any loss of "user friendliness"

1,2,3 and (a) don't require any development experience, so would be a
great project for any interested user to undertake. I suspect 4
wouldn't be much work for a developer either after all this groundwork
is done.

Just because I recently found it ..
Mapwindow (which seem to have the same icon set as QGIS and GRASS) has
introduced such a "Add Data" Layer right from the beginning.
Maybe it is a good point to start (just because I see that there are
still Database buttons too)

http://www.mapwindow.org

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Aspiring new developer and bug issue
Message-ID: <CADu=4Fzc8Q0G3RJtzWTmOxCqOGgzX0kuMQxFfF+=LLdWibQVjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello people,

as an exercise for my MSc we are required to contribute somehow in an open
source GIS project. Recently, I was experimenting with modelbuilder in QGIS
and I think I found a bug (which I reported it in
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/16431 ) and I would like to fix it as part of
my assignment.

I would like to ask you, if there are some introductory guidelines that I
should read, and if you think that the particular bug is something that a
newby could handle. Or if you have some other bug suggestion for newcomers.
My skills with python are just above average :)

Thanks in advance,

Kind Regards,

Evangelos Vafeiadis

Hi,

Are there plans to build a plugin for PostGIS rasters similar to the vector
plugin. I know how to add the rasters from the DB manager but the
experience/workflow is much different and the connections go 'stale'.

I am willing to help code it.

Regards,

Rob

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster to Vector shape layer conversion
Message-ID: <CABRmCTt8fLFQYigW-graUHy9cDte=zf-k3LEHSGL1hw4JXQe8w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
I am Sai Harsh, an UG student in IIIT-Chittoor, India.

I want to convert raster image to vector shape layer. I knew that in
qgis this feature already exists but it's limited.

Let us suppose If one google roadmap image is given as an input, after
converting it into vector shape layer(using the existing conversion), I
would like to highlight one road line(manually using attribute table) but
it's not working. correct me if I am wrong.

Can anyone suggest me how I need to proceed?

I know there should be some image processing algorithm need to be applied,
then followed by converting it into vector layer format.

Which image processing algorithm I need to apply to get good accuracy?

Awaiting for a positive response.

Best Regards,
Harsh
IIIT-Chittoor

Hi Pieter,

The GUI tools looks interesting. I have used the command line version to
tile, create overviews and load the rasters into the database.

What I am looking for is on the QGIS side something similar to the Oracle
Geo-raster tool but for PostGIS.

Rob

Message-ID: <7088A26751CB34409B159B4237D510A87C959CEF@W2K8-EXDB02.VERBAND.LOCAL>

Hi list,

I'd like to edit my data with QGIS on WFS datasource (QGIS-Server WFS-T) - which generally works well! ;-)

Now I'd like to add the lastchange-date and lastchange-user automatically to the attributes. Lastchange-date could be solved with DB-Trigger so far, but does anyone know how to "automagically" add the lastchange-user?
The WFS-Server-Middleware is QGIS-Server, the WFS-service itself is secured via Apache-LDAP-Auth, so the Web-Server knows, who sent the Edit-Request (HTTP-Header-Information within WFS-POST-Request injected from Apache LDAP-Module). Is there any way to pass the user from the Web-Server via QGIS-Server to the DB? Maybe a QGIS-Server-Plugin or anything else? Or any total different approach? Every idea is welcome, thanks a lot,

Benjamin

Hi all,
I'd very much welcome this addition to PostGIS manager and/or Browser.
I'm available for help if necessary.
All the best.

Hi, 

If there will be a new Postgis raster provider for QGIS, it should also
support the pyramid tables (separate tables) - which as far as I know -
is not yet supported. If you add a layer from DB-manager you load a
fixed resolution and the other pyramid tables won't be used. Thats one
of the reasons, rasters in Postgis display quite slow in QGIS.

I have a small processing model where one of the algorithms is Rasterize 
from GDAL. I needed to set the target resolution to be the same as the 
one in one of the input rasters to the model.

The problem was thus the same as yours. My solution was to write a very 
simple processor, which takes raster as input and outputs its 
resolution. I could then hook its input to the raster in the model input 
and hook its output to the resolution input of the rasterize algorithm.

My answer is thus that you need to make a model and find or make an 
algorithm, which outputs the layer property you need.

Cheers,

Ari

Hi Ari

What a great idea. Thank you. I guess the one downside is that it means the
main algorithm will not function on its own, so you have to rely on
documentation to inform the user not to try to use it without your
preprocessor?

Thanks again

Tom

By main algorithm you mean what? For the user the model appears similar 
to any algorithm, although it is made of many algorithms (that's the 
case for all QGIS processing models). Each work on their own with 
correct input. You can study the model here

Hi Andreas,

The QGIS performance reading rasters from Postgis is not so bad, if
pyramids are available on the database. QGIS takes advantage of the
pyramids, if they exist. Check [1].

Jorge

Yes, I mean that all models are made up of discrete algorithms, and those
algorithms will only really work as intended if chained together as in the
model. Nevertheless, the algorithms will appear in the Processing toolbox,
so users could try to use them in isolation, and have difficulty forming the
required inputs. Or do you prevent the individual algorithms appearing in
the Processing toolbox?

Thanks for the link - really useful.

Tom

Hi Alexandre

this is indeed great!

Is the gdoc as it is now helpful enough for you to design a possible
implementation? Or, if not, what other inputs / comments would be necessary?

No. In my case the "compute the cell size of a raster" is just not very 
useful to use separately.

Hi,

I am using 2.18.5. and the performance seems okay to good.

The ortho data in the DB are tiled and have overviews built.

When working with the data within QGIS it seems that the overviews are 'in
play'.

I will see if I can write some SQL to prove one way or the other.

The test vm on the back-end: CentOS 7, Postgres 9.6 with PostGIS 2.3.2 (all
repo based).

The front-end will move to 2.18.6 later today.

Rob

Hi Rob, 

Thanks for testing. Good to know that pyramids now work fine with
postgis raster. It was a while back since I last tested. 

If you can log the SQL queries on the server by increasing the logging
level, than it you can prove which tables QGIS is querying.

Hi,

Quick test results. Attached are the statistics reports exported from pg
admin 3.

Loaded an ortho table (PostGIS raster) called bcit_otho that has several
overview tables.

After panning and zooming the o_2_bcit_ortho seems to be 'hit' a few times.

Hi Robert

Just a little of topic question.  Your centos install for Postgres etc, is
that only using Postgres Yum repo?

Your QGIS frontend, is that also Centos?

I believe there is always the option to turn a model into an algorithm
using the Export as Python script functionality of the model editor.

The underlying algorithms still need to be available but could be in their
own group ('advanced', 'atomic', 'dangerzone :)') and the integrated
algorithm could be named accordingly as well ('runme :)').

But in the end it comes down to making more universally (perhaps within the
problem domain) useful algorithms and providing good documentation ( which
is pretty easy using the built-in help system ). For example, I came to the
conclusion that is useful to have a very basic algorithm 'write string to
file' as a basic building block of models using algorithms which output
strings and digest files.

I had similar concerns and started to think that it should be possible to
'compile' a script (recursively) which uses processing.runalg down to a
script which only uses 'native' api functionality and 'native' algorithms.
Effectively, patching in the called script source (perhaps as a function?).
The 'compiler' could perhaps be an algorithm itself. This way it would be
easy to provide just a single algorithm which is not depending on other
custom algorithms.

Hi all,
a friend is trying to install qgis on an ubuntu xenial machine, and
obtains errors. I tried to help, but cannot find a solution, and after
several attempts I ran out of ideas. I'd be grateful if someone with
xenial experience could point me out to something to check again.
All the best.

ubuntugis-unstable has GDAL 2.1.3, but the qgis.org packages have not 
been (re)built with that version yet.

Disable the qgis.org repo and install qgis from ubuntugis-unstable, or 
vice versa.

Hm, should work fine.  Just checked with updates and security in place.

Is gdal-abi-2-1-3 alone installable?

QGIS 2.18.6 was built with GDAL 2.1.3 right away.

GDAL 2.1.3 was introduced shortly after QGIS 2.18.5 (same weekend and one of
the reasons 2.18.5*-1 packages where issued in close succession).

Hi Jürgen, Bas,
thanks for the prompt reply. So, in short, it should be installable, but
apparently it isn't. Should I then ask to try the install of libgdal20?
gdal-abi should be a virtual package, right?
Sorry, I do not have direct access to the machine, so I cannot test myself.
All the best.

Hi,

I have at least two use cases for QGIS Python plugins where I see the
need for "Templating in Python".
Do you devs have any preferences (there are so many in Python..[1])?
Jinja2?

Hi Stéphane,

I believe it's a great starting point, very complete (I would not
remember/consider some types of data).

We still need to fill the second page and discuss the possible UI/UX
implementation. Then, we will need some developers (I'm not a developer) to
consider the requests and filter what would be hard or impossible to tackle.

Our best chance to have this implemented is by doing baby steps. I would
not consider more data format/providers than the ones we have in the manage
layers toolbar in this first phase.

Thanks!

Jinja is already packaged in QGIS so you wouldn't need to package it in
your plugin if you use it.

Message-ID: <CABRmCTsZpZtu+tC8XbiNX7sFDrNV5O-wx+w3Oz2A2titmyUuDg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
I am Sai Harsh, an UG student in IIIT-Chittoor, India.

I want to convert raster image to vector shape layer. I knew that in
qgis this feature already exists but it's limited.

Let us suppose If one google roadmap image is given as an input, after
converting it into vector shape layer(using the existing conversion), I
would like to highlight one road line(manually using attribute table) but
it's not working. correct me if I am wrong.

Can anyone suggest me how I need to proceed?

I know there should be some image processing algorithm need to be applied,
then followed by converting it into vector layer format.

Which image processing algorithm I need to apply to get good accuracy?

Awaiting for a positive response.

Best Regards,
Harsh
IIIT-Chittoor

Hi Sai Harsh,

I would start by learning OpenCV [1]. OpenCV is a sophisticated image
processing library with Python bindings you can use with QGIS. You can
write your own algorithm to isolate the roads. Search the web for object
detection and classification examples.
Machine learning is probably the best approach. You have already images
with roads, so you have many examples for machine learning (positive
cases). So, after playing with OpenCV, look for machine learning (with
OpenCV).

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

QgsDistanceArea is currently the only class in QGIS for doing
measurements - either euclidean or using Vincenty's formulae. I have
not heard about anyone currently working on adding more methods for
calculation of distances or areas. I am no expert in geodesic
calculations - what other methods would you like to have in QGIS and
how are their results different from Vincenty's formulae?

Nowadays there is quite a lot of effort being done to improve QGIS API
for the upcoming release of 3.0. Please feel free to join the effort
and submit pull requests on this topic - that would be very
appreciated!

Thanks for answering. Geographiclib has a good summary of the benefits over
vincinty.

https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/html/python/geodesics.html

The algorithms implemented by this package are given in Karney (2013) and
are based on Bessel (1825) and Helmert (1880); the algorithm for areas is
based on Danielsen (1989). These improve on the work of Vincenty (1975) in
the following respects:

   - The results are accurate to round-off for terrestrial ellipsoids (the
   error in the distance is less then 15 nanometers, compared to 0.1 mm for
   Vincenty).
   - The solution of the inverse problem is always found. (Vincenty’s
   method fails to converge for nearly antipodal points.)
   - The routines calculate differential and integral properties of a
   geodesic. This allows, for example, the area of a geodesic polygon to be
   computed.

Here are my questions.

1. Sorry for my lack of knowledge here. I have gotten into the plugin
development and I have been thinking that I could possibly contribute to
the actual QGIS code, but I am not sure what you want done when you say to
do a "pull request on the topic".

2. geographiclib already has done the work for the more accurate geodesic
algorithms. They use the MIT/X11 license. Is that compatible with the QGIS
GNU2 license? It would certainly be easiest to use that code rather than
trying to reinvent it.

3. What is the best way to learn the steps necessary to contribute to the
core QGIS project?


Thanks!

I just finished presenting a QGIS training with my employer and it seems to
have been very successful. There were a lot of oohs and aahs. We are slowly
moving away from our proprietary GIS and toward broader adoption of QGIS.
This has become easy in recent years because the software speaks for
itself! (Ultimately I'd like to be able to make the case for financial
contributions to the project but we're not there yet--baby steps.)

Just wanted to give a big thank you to all of you developers for delivering
a great application. Keep up the good work and I'm looking forward to 3.0.

Hi all,

I am working for a client of mine with the great QGEP model and plugin. I
have some issues, questions, and I would like to contribute with possible
translation, documentation and development.

My first reflex would be to open issues and PR in QGEP github repository,
but since this project is led by a community of users, with an official
steering committee, I was wondering if I can use it.

I have already contacted Matthias Kuhn privately to discuss some points,
but I really think this would be better for him and for QGEP if I do not go
on sending him direct emails ;)

Does anyone know why this works with some QGIS installs and not others? Is
there a way to use 'builtins' and avoid it failing on some QGIS installs?

Thanks,

Hi All

I made a first pass hack to build python docs from the sip bindings for QGIS.

See the README & code here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGISPythonAPIDocumentation

There are a few things not yet documented like setting up sphinx etc....

Regards

Tim

Hi Michaël,
nice to see more people join the water application fest :).

good question, and we could ask the same for similar projects like QWAT and
the others ready to launch.

Your point is that we miss mailing list / IRC or other channels dedicated
to those projects ?

My guess is that it is up to each Steering comitee to decide if they want
to open those channels.

My personal opinion is a big yes, still we need to avoid opening *yet
another list of channels* when current cluttering is quite high (mails,
irc, gitter, matrix, git pr and issues, wikis) It's a real challenge for us
to avoid communication gaps.

Maybe we could discuss that at Essen, will you join?

Matthias, Denis, any opinion ?

Régis

Hi Nyall,

I got the nightly 2.18.6 32bit release installed (after dealing with the
osgeo4w installer not finding the libmysql package to download) and
rasterlayer.renderer() now returns the the qgshillshaderenderer with the
corresponding azimuth et al. methods. Thanks again !

sure, it is possible. With 2.x version the below example should be working:

>>> vl = iface.activeLayer()
>>> actions = vl.actions()
>>>
>>> actionName = 'Show feature id'
>>> actionContent = 'from qgis.utils import iface; iface.messageBar().pushMessage("Feature ID: [% $id %]", 0)'
>>>
>>> actions.addAction(QgsAction.GenericPython, actionName, actionContent)

Since QGIS 3 the code for actions was revamped, please see
https://goo.gl/rGgYHC.

There's also https://github.com/mapbox/cheap-ruler - potentially this

Message-ID: <CAK6pVBXPT7c59G3pU71a2a-sE=skUV5p-=WZNMYzuWwxvb3r9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

while updating the doc to describe a future unique "Add data" button
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aMX9jOfl10q8oETRzOHSHnRpHCc7UJ1dDnCCq3VyTAY/edit?usp=sharing
I stumbled upon the *Project / DWG/DXF Import*.

2 questions here:

   - Is there a reason why this import tool is stored under "Project"?
   Doesn't seem consistent to me but maybe I am missing a point
   - It's quite confusing that the menu is called "DWG/DXF" while it is
   actually here to import Geopackage layers

Also, when trying to import this sample dataset
http://www.geopackage.org/data/gdal_sample_v1.2_no_extensions.gpkg I get an
error "Could not open layer list", although all goes well if I
drag-and-drop from the browser.

Not sure if I should open a bug report or if this is all being taken care
of already?

Cheers

Stéphane

Hi Stephane,
That button is for importing DWG/DXF. It does the import into a Geopackage.
Don't know why it's stored under "Project"
All the best,Tudor

Yes (same caveats apply about it being a rough first pass).

When it is more tidy I will put it on a QGIS.ORG domain - I plan to split the docs into logical subgroups  and perhaps merge it into the cookbook so that we can cross reference the API from the examples. For now I am just playing around to see what is feasible - I will hopefully put some work into it a the QGIS hackfest in Essen.

I'd also try to work up some guideline so that we can require incoming code generates nice docs. In InaSAFE we have a 'tidy everything you touch' policy - it would be nice to institute the same in QGIS so that as well as unit tests, peer reviews also require decent API docs in order for code to be merged.

Ok, thanks for the clarification!

Then I guess that the window should be re-designed a bit. To me at least it
was not intuitive that "Geopackage" has to do with the output of the tool.

And yes, maybe both "DXF Export" and "DWG/DXF import" could be moved
somewhere else?

Cheers

I’m pretty sure it’s there because if you export to DXF you either export the view or the entire project - but either way it’s not just a single layer that’s affected.

-ramon.

That would indeed make sense for the "DXF export"

But maybe less for the "DWF/DXF import", which is, basically, a format
transformation (so, for the "Vector" menu) and / or a way to add data to
the canvas.

Or, again, maybe I am missing a point :-)

Hi all

Harrissou has quite intensively re-organised the doc, which is now, IMO,
much clearer. Thanks for that!

But lots of changes are in "suggestion mode". I'd like to accept all those
changes to increase the clarity and readability. Any objection on this?

Thanks and cheers

Stéphane

Hi Paolo,

commit from today? because yesterday it worked.
I assume you have already tried it in a clean build directory ..

Hi Werner,
thanks for your reply. I have this issue since a few days. I have
removed everything from the build dir.
All the best.

	Data
Message-ID: <CAGpiUSi2hAesf3W8a3czhb_UF+1AtEzwQeCv1TNjVsMYytBpxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have an out-db raster on PostGIS which I tried to load in QGIS (v
2.14.12-Essen) utilizing the DB Manager to establish a connection. I could
view the raster table, but when I try to "Add to canvas" it displays a
black (blank) image instead of the raster image.

I would be glad if someone could help me to resolve this.

I was wrong: 2.18 compiles fine; apparently a package is missing for
2.99 though.
Thanks.

In fact, it was, quite predictably:

I meant to basically:
1. clone the QGIS source code repository from https://github.com/qgis/QGIS
2. build QGIS yourself - see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL
3. create a branch and implement your changes in the branch
4. create a pull request in QGIS repository on GitHub

It is possible that they are compatible, but I don't know - better to
research that first...

I think my reply above partially answers this question. Have a look also here:
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/qgisdevelopersguide/index.html

If you have further questions on how to get started, feel free to ask
here on qgis-dev list.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] NSIS installer size
Message-ID: <7e70424dcb7d448d8bdd6f45a999217c@NINSRV23.nina.no>

Dear all,

With QGIS 2.18.6 I again have troubles to create a installer exe using creatensis.pl on Ubuntu.
The issue is likely that the installer gets to big when I include all possible Processing Providers (OTB,SAGA,GRASS) in one installer.
I tried all recommendations from NSIS here:
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Failure_when_compiling_a_big_installer
But nothing had effect.
The resulting installer was earlier around 400MB and the unpacked-x86_64 dir has 2.2G.

Injecting a custom qgis.bat in the nsis-installer worked nicely for us, as the installer could be included in the Windows Software center. But maybe we have to move over to using OSGeo4W?

Any hint is very much appreciated.

Kind regards,
Stefan

	Raster Data
Message-ID: <CAGpiUSiwKhbXuM7471GZmcNP1v=JsHZN93uOHHG7PUKwPWte9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have an out-db raster on PostGIS which I tried to load in QGIS (v
2.14.12-Essen) utilizing the DB Manager to establish a connection. I could
view the raster table, but when I try to "Add to canvas" it displays a
black (blank) image instead of the raster image.

This raster file exist on the filesystem and when it is loaded directly
into QGIS it displays the image (aerial photo). Also, when the same file is
stored in PostGIS as a raster (IN-DB), it can be viewed in QGIS (using the
DB Manager tool). However, when I reference the same file as an OUT-DB
raster in PostGIS (in this case only the metadata of the raster and the
filepath to the raster file is stored), an attempt to view it in QGIS
(using the DB Manager tool) results in a black image being displayed
instead of the aerial photo.

I would be glad if someone could help me to resolve this.

Too good to be true :)

Hi Régis,

Thanks for your answer !

2017-04-14 16:16 GMT+02:00 Régis Haubourg <regis.haubourg at gmail.com>:

I had 2 questions in mind ;
* ask for permission to report issues in the QGEP github repository.
* ask if there is a dedicated and open mailing list for QGEP, or if I
should instead use QGIS-dev mailing list to discuss some subject.

I do not want to pollute the github issues with "newbie" questions or
discussions, so I was asking QGEP maintainers their opinion about it.

Yep !

I think we could use QGIS dev mailing list to discuss some matter related
to QGEP, but only if there is an impact on QGIS (feature missing, etc.), as
Matthias and other QGEP devs do sometimes.



>

I won't attend this meeting, but I will be available for any online
interaction ( irc, emails, wiki, webconf, etc.)


>

Same question ;)


Cheers,
Michaël

Thanks for your input. I will do some research on the GNU vs MIT license as
well as prepare a QGIS development environment and then see where I can go
from there.

All the best!!!

 stopped working on Windows
Message-ID: <254f3936-f531-cca4-9a29-837f6105fc20@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

A customer has an issue in Processing when using gdal_calc on Windows.
He has a error dialog with "Python.exe has stopped working".

It seems that this issue is an old one, 2 years ago, coming from Osgeo4W
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/466
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/101921/gdal-calc-works-but-i-get-a-python-error-at-the-end-of-each-process-that-prevent

It seems that the issue is the same for other GDAL scripts and is due to 
the way GDAL has been compiled. The issue does not exist with other 
Windows GDAL package.

Does someone else has encountered this issue ?
Do you know if Osgeo4W is maintained ?

Regards,
René-Luc

Hi,

> - Shape: do not export Shapelib symbols for builds
> --with-hide-internal-symbols (#6860) 

It turns out that the above change breaks QGIS 2.18 build, in particular the DXF2SHP 
converter native plugin, since it does a nasty trick: the QGIS build tree has the shapelib 2.10 
includes files, but relies on linking against shapelib symbols exported by libgdal. The plugin 
apparently no longer exists in QGIS master, which builds fine against GDAL 2.2beta2.

So I'm not sure what to do:
1) revert #6860 and export again shapelib symbols from GDAL. But this apparently breaks 
some other workflows
2) let distributions apply a patch to do this revert, while they use QGIS 2.18 or other code 
that depend on GDAL exporting shapelib symbols
3) Change DXF2SHP plugin to use OGR API instead of shapelib, but I'm not feeling like I 
would do that myself.

My opinion would be to favor 2)

Opinions ?

Hi Even,

In the end, isn't solution 2) the same as solution 1) for the user? In
which case it sounds like it mainly puts additional load on
distributions for no added value. Am I missing something?

Especially because "some other workflows" is a quite loose definition.

In the end it sounds like the proper solutions would be to fix dxf2shp -
but since that has already been sent to the graveyard it's questionable
if someone wants to do the effort.

More options

4) ship shapelib with qgis itself (as part of the dxf2shp plugin)

5) require GDAL < 2.2 for building QGIS 2.18

Fixing dxf2shp is in my opinion the best solution too. That's the part
that's broken, the change in GDAL just brought it to the forefront.

Please don't. Embedded code copies are a PITA. QGIS has too many of
those already (although they're generally not required).

> 5) require GDAL < 2.2 for building QGIS 2.18

That doesn't sound good either. QGIS 2.18 should work with any
reasonable GDAL version.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Somehow, except that I'd wish official GDAL no longer export shapelib symbols to avoid the 
issue of #6860

For distributions that would ship both GDAL 2.2 and QGIS 2.18, yes that's an (hopefully small) 
burden to apply the revert patch of
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/37997

>

The details are in
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/6860

Agreed that investing time in modifying dxf2shp isn't really something appealing.

Well, it is more or less partly shipped in dxf2shp except than the .c files aren't compiled, and 
there are at least the one doing the I/O interface missing.

Not really an option for distributions that track latest versions of their components


Hum, there might be an intermediate option: revert the change in GDAL 2.2 branch, and keep 
it in 2.3dev which will probably be released in one year, at a time where QGIS 3 should have 
been released to.

What about

6) #ifdef the offending plugin out in 2.18 for GDAL >= 2.2?

Given that the plugin is removed in QGIS 3.0 anyway, I think early
retirement is a perfectly valid option. It's also the best option for
GDAL, and avoids any wasted effort temporarily fixing code which only
has a short time left to live anyway...

There's been no objections at all to the removal in 3.0 (although
admittedly only a small sample of users would be using the 3.0
development builds). I just suspect that this is almost never used and
most of our users won't notice its loss.

I agree in general. I think this case here is a bit different, given
that this is already partially present (in a particularly cumbersome and
incomplete way) and is going to be phased out soon.

If that's going to be done I would update that to error out in CMake
with an incompatiblity error and force the packager to make a decision
(actively disable dxf2shp or pin GDAL to the older version).

Which decision would you propose for the packages provided upstream
(like OSGeo4W)?

I was thinking the same, but breaking peoples workflows in patch
releases is a good way to undermine the trust in LTR.

Yeah don't change anything like this in a LTR. It's not a good idea for
trust.

Hi Jürgen,

Thanks for your answer.

I wonder if other QGIS user on Windows has already tested the GDAL 
calculator and have the same issue as the reporter and my customer.

About Osgeo4W, we have opened a tickets 4 years ago about PHP to help 
users tested Lizmap and QGIS Server on windows, but we nerver have any 
reaction https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/343

I know that QGIS is build with some packages coming from OSgeo4W, I 
suppose that some part of the project are maintained and I thank you 
those who do it.

Regards,

René-Luc

The webstuff is not maintained in OSGeo4W (32bit, doesn't exists at all for
64bit - as qgis doesn't strictly need it).  qgis server is there - but for
64bit you need to add apache (probably the best bet for 32bit too - it's apache
is really old).

GRASS is maintained by Martin Landa, the rest essentially by me (there are some
people on and off contributing something).

But not everything is actively kept uptodate - dependencies just when QGIS or
some of it's direct dependencies require it.

I've taken another road finally. Build the internal copy of shapelib of QGIS with some 
modifications :
* prefix all the SHP* and DBF* symbols of it with qgis_ to avoid symbol name clashes
* and use GDAL VSI Large file I/O instead of standard lib FILE API so that UTF-8 names are 
properly handled on Windows.

Hi René-Luc,

I have also seen this issue several times, and for me it also happen
not only wth gdal_calc but also with other Python-based GDAL tools.

I did not reported it because I was unable to produce stable test case.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing crowd funding campaign for composer
	rewrite and reporting framework
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash5bYStW13GfmQck3srCLk7JQt+EExswP5758Znz8ZGGw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm proud to announce the launch of North Road's latest QGIS crowd
funding campaign: the "QGIS Layout and Reporting Engine Campaign".

This campaign covers stage 1 of a large, ongoing project to modernise
and expand on QGIS’ print composer and layout facilities. Over time
QGIS’ composer functionality has grown extensively and now is capable
of creating flexible, high quality cartographic outputs. However,
we’ve now hit a limit where the current code architecture is
prohibiting further improvements and important fixes. In order to add
a reporting framework to QGIS, it is necessary for us to refactor and
improve large sections of the composer code.

You can read more about the campaign and what we're planning at

https://north-road.com/2017/04/26/qgis-composer-rewrite-and-layout-engine-crowdfund-launched/

Please reshare this link via social media, your local user groups, etc
- the more exposure we get the more likely this is to be successful!

Thanks,

Nyall

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bugs on mapinfo tab files editing
Message-ID: <CAP=p+YtUSszC2M8zvZ-+1FWxoKG1ruQ1i30Y_Be-ofFUTONRPw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
     I little while ago I reported two bugs (16451 and 16449) regarding the
corruption of Mapinfo tab files when they are edited in QGIS (it happens
very single time and for every single file).

   We used to do all our work using Mapinfo, so all our data is maintained
in that format.We are currently trying hard to move everything to QGIS, but
this bug with mapinfo files has been an important deterrent for us. This
brings me to a few questions:

- Fixing bugs like that are a priority in the QGIS development?
- How can we (as a company) assist in resolving those bugs?

Cheers,
Pedro

 everyone, I'm Eduardo
Message-ID: <1493257690592-5318549.post@n6.nabble.com>

Greetings to all

I want to send this mail to properly introduce myself to this mailing list
My name is Eduardo Rojas Rodríguez and I am from Costa Rica recently
admitted to work for SOLTIG (current sponsor and Commercial support for QGIS
in Costa Rica) and I want to introduce myself to the community. We have made
great strides to promote the adoption of the use of QGIS in Costa Rica and
part is that we would like to get closer to the entire community of users
and developers to be more in contact with each other.

Within SOLTIG I am currently in charge of promoting and strengthening the
link with the QGIS community in general so you all are likely to be seeing
me posted on this mailing list and in the user list. Our goal is to
contribute and help the community and to promote the use of QGIS and Free
and open-source software in our region.

As a personal note, I want to express my happiness to work from SOLTIG with
you on this project, I declare myself a fan of all of you developers, I have
been a follower and supporter of the project since I studied Geography at
the University of Costa Rica, personally  I tried to contribute to the
project with donations and in any crowd funding I see.

Thank you all and I hope we will be in touch.

PS: any information you require from me I am available to help

Hi Pedro,

Welcome to QGIS and thanks for reporting these bugs. As a first step, it
is very important to be even aware of them. As a second step, someone
will need to actually look into and take care of it. This normally
happens by either the one who opened the issue having the capacity and
know-how to fix it, by hoping that someone else will jump in and do it
or by contacting one of the many companies that offer commercial support
and will guide you through the bugfixing process.

A list for companies providing professional support can be found here:
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/commercial_support.html

If you are interested in reading more about how the get things changed,
have a look at the following blog post which covers more details:
http://nyalldawson.net/2016/08/how-to-effectively-get-things-changed-in-qgis-a-follow-up/

Thanks for following up on this
Matthias

Hi all

I would be more than happy to help push this new feature forward but I am
not really sure what is needed now?

Alexandre, I think you mentioned that your company might be interested to
implement this unique "Add layer" button. Does the Gdoc now contain
sufficient information for you to move on and identify what can
realistically be done? Or is there a need for more polishing?

Thanks in advance!

Stéphane

Hi,

I have chosen to use the Github repository. Any feedback appreciated ;)
I will probably add more issues, and ad PR. Please tell me if I need to
stop !

Subject: [Qgis-developer] release file after processing.runalg
Message-ID: <caf9ce38-c5f9-a12c-7c17-86fc5077f5ba@yahoo.it>

Dear List,

I'd like to remove an existing file (see [tempOutput]) after it was used 
by a geoalgorithm. The geoalgorithm works perfectly but after its 
execution, the file [tempOutput] is locked.

Here a simple test script that returns "[Error 32] The process cannot 
access the file because it is being used by another process: 
'D:/test_alg/map_to_clip.tif'":

import processing
import os

tempOutput = 'D:/test_alg/map_to_clip.tif'
maskFN = 'D:/test_alg/mask.shp'
output = 'D:/test_alg/clipped_map.tif'

algRes = processing.runalg("gdalogr:cliprasterbymasklayer",
                                         tempOutput,
                                         maskFN,
"-9999",False,False,False,5,4,75,6,1,False,0,False,"",
                                         output)

try:
     os.remove(tempOutput)
except Exception as e:
     print e

I also found a solution on the web [1] but it doesn't work for me :( If 
I understand correctly, the trick is to load the file as layer and then 
release it. Here its implementation:

import processing
import os

tempOutput = 'D:/test_alg/map_to_clip.tif'
maskFN = 'D:/test_alg/mask.shp'
output = 'D:/test_alg/clipped_map.tif'

algRes = processing.runalg("gdalogr:cliprasterbymasklayer",
                                         tempOutput,
                                         maskFN,
"-9999",False,False,False,5,4,75,6,1,False,0,False,"",
                                         output)

try:
     # add to the map
     tempLay = QgsRasterLayer(tempOutput, "tempLay")
     if not tempLay.isValid(): raise Exception("Failed to load tempLay")
     QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(tempLay) #!!!!

     layermap = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers()
     for i, layer in layermap.iteritems():
       print 'layername',layer.source()
       if layer.source() == tempOutput:
         # Remove layer references
         QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayer(layer.id()) #!!!!
         # Delete the file
         os.remove(tempOutput)

except Exception as e:
     print e

I didn't find any other solution for the moment. Any suggestion is 
really very appreciate!

Thanks

enrico

Subject: [Qgis-developer] processing modeler: join attributes table
Message-ID: <CA+Ei1OeNgpngNCeZNhPaR7KELpJvSS49ETwV=YObPGfzMXw2Xw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

we are trying to join attribute table with another table in processing
modeler (using "Join attributes table" algorithm), but it fails:

"""
Running Join attributes table [2/2]

Parameters: INPUT_LAYER
=/tmp/processingb49e46d91a8d4997a4d2c2b0a2e31e7c/94a754a43e4a4074bcbd79714a0eebcf/OUTPUTALGQGISUNION1.shp,
INPUT_LAYER_2 =/home/landa/Documents/YFSG/hydrologie/hydrologie/vzorek1/hpj.shp,
TABLE_FIELD =HPJ, TABLE_FIELD_2 =HPJ

Failed

Error executing algorithm Join attributes table
QgsFeature.setGeometry(QgsGeometry): argument 1 has unexpected type
'NoneType' See log for more details
"""

The parameters should be fine - the both tables (attribute table and
CSV table contain column 'HPJ'). It's possible to join CSV table file
with attribute table manually in QGIS without any problems. It seems
to be a bug in processing modeler, can you confirm it?

Thanks, Martin

Hi enrico,
as far as I see from the reference you added the solution would be to add the result (resp. output) to a Layer instead "tempOutput". Then you remove that Layer, I suppose while removing the layer a reference on "tempOutput" ist released.

cheers

Stefan

Hi Stefan and many thanks for your answer! but it seems not working :(
Here the new code. I replaced "tempOutput" with "output". Layer is 
correctly loaded and removed but "tempOutput" cannot be deleted.

import processing
import os

tempOutput = 'D:/test_alg/map_to_clip.tif'
maskFN = 'D:/test_alg/mask.shp'
output = 'D:/test_alg/clipped_map.tif'

algRes = processing.runalg("gdalogr:cliprasterbymasklayer",
                                         tempOutput,
                                         maskFN,
"-9999",False,False,False,5,4,75,6,1,False,0,False,"",
                                         output)

try:

I think that github is the right place indeed. I like the possibility to
keep discussins threaded, mark them as resolved, label them, search and
browse them. Are there some things for which you would prefer a mailing
list?

For anything that's not wastewater specific business logic (so api,
performance, forms ...), the list is of course perfectly fine like for
any other plugin.

Hi,

Some of my colleagues will be in Essen for QGIS Developers meeting. They
will bring this up, and try to get the opinion of other developers. I'm
sure everyone there will be interested in contributing with ideas for it.

So, let's wait for now.

Thanks for your work.

In-Reply-To: <CAB4g1=ysMywsw7qF6+TwNxETJ7sRvosF_oO2QQbiZR-=zA-2OA@mail.gmail.com>
References: <CAB4g1=ysMywsw7qF6+TwNxETJ7sRvosF_oO2QQbiZR-=zA-2OA@mail.gmail.com>

This requirement stems from the concept of "metabuffer" in tile caching, a
mechanism commonly user to mitigate label artifacts around tiles' margins.

I suppose that adding such opton would be as simple as reducing the bbox
set inside QgsLabelingEngine::run by the required amount, and obviously
adding the setting to the layers' labeling settings UI.

What's your opinion?

Hi Enrico,
how is that file map_to_clip.tif created? There still could be a reference on that file, maybe because of the generation process (I assume that because you call it tempOutput, so there could be still a reference from another process). For example, if that file is visualized somewhere there definitly is a referene on that file.

cheers

Stefan

Hi Devs,

What do you think about set the Form-Aware Value Relation Widget plugin 
as a core plugin ?
https://github.com/elpaso/qgis-formawarevaluerelationwidget

I think it has to be a core feature! Thank Alessandro Pasotti to have 
done it!

Regards,
René-Luc

Hi René-Luc,

It is amazing indeed and the functionality it provides should be in core.

Recently there has been a trend away from core plugins and lots of them
have been removed.

What should be done in my opinion is trying to modularize it as much as
possible (I discussed some ideas with Alessandro in Girona but cannot
recall it right now) and integrate this functionality as core fully
featured core functionality.

Regards
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS-GDAL OUT-DB RASTER SUPPORT
Message-ID: <CAGpiUShdWZA_a4d685ug0Wo9OLROB075xDFsmzFVo-xyijZCkA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am getting a black image when I try to display PostGIS out-db rasters. I
discovered that it has to do with GDAL support for out-db rasters as stated
in the link below for a similar issue (over 1 year back):
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/12133

The last comment by Jürgen Fischer states "... only black images. So it's a
dependency issue (GDAL complains ERROR 1: This raster has outdb storage.
This feature isn't still available)."

I would like to know if out-db rasters remain unsupported by GDAL. If yes,
how do one solve this issue of displaying out-db rasters?

Hi Stefan, thanks again!
the file "map_to_clip.tif" is saved on the HD and it is not submitted to 
any process before executing the script (I know that because I can 
delete it before running the script).
At the same time, I noticed that the file "map_to_clip.tif.aux.xml" was 
created after running the script and closing qgis (absolutely, I did no 
other things!).
Can that suggest the process that locks the file?

There still could be a reference on that file, maybe because of the generation process (I assume that because you call it tempOutput, so there could be still a reference from another process). For example, if that file is visualized somewhere there definitly is a referene on that file.

I had a similar issue (I think). I never solved it myself, but Luca did. The
issue is here:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/issues/148

The commit is here:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/pull/297

The code used in current master is here:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/master/utils.py#L257

So, this might help you, but it might not.

Tom

Hi Tom and thank you for your contribution.

It's hard to me to understand your issue but I will study it!

In the meantime, I made some tests again and I can replicate my problem 
both using the geoalgorithm directly from the processing framework and 
using a similar geoprocessing from SAGA (again from the processing 
framework).

In both the cases the result is the same and the input file is locked!!!

I can reproduce it on QGIS 2.14.5-Essen/WIN7 and QGIS 2.18.4/WIN10.

Instead, it seems to work under QGIS 2.14.10-Essen on UBUNTU 16.04. In 
this case the "map_to_clip.tif.aux.xml" file is created after the 
algorithm terminates.

Can someone confirm this issue?

I upload some test file here: 
https://github.com/eachiaradia/doc/tree/master/test_alg

Hi all,
currently in the train to Essen :) Here is a roadmap for Oslandia (and
thanks for starting the thread Luigi)

# QGIS server refactoring: We have some work to share
    - performance improvements on WMS rendering using multithreaded
rendering
    - performance improvements on GetCapabilities loading for large layers
without metadata (views, materialized views..)
    - OGC CITE compliance continuous integration platform (uses docker to
run OGC CITE TeamEngine and Geoserver reference and produces html report of
compliance and failures). See
https://git.oslandia.net/Oslandia/qgis-server-testsuite and a html report
example here  http://37.187.164.233/ogc/latest_wms_1_3_0.html

# OSGEO4W infrastructure talk
Hugo Mercier started a talk here
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/osgeo4w-dev/2017-April/003338.html
This is a critical point for QGIS and all osgeo tools. We lack mirroring
and space for this service, and all of us rely on Jurgen's shoulders
(thanks for that again). We have invested some time to be able to help in
that area.

By myself, I'd also like to take some time to upgrade some plugins to QGIS
3 and help in bug triage.


Cheers
Régis

Hi,
one point in my todo list for Essen is to build and share specifications to
homogenize and improve relation widgets. Matthias, would you be available
for that work?

Hi,

Hi all,
let's see if we can implement this during the HF.
I recap here the requests by OSM PSC:

1. You seem to be using an user agent of "Mozilla/5.0 QGIS/2.18.3". We
strongly recommend that you don't pretend to be a browser by adding the
"Mozilla" bit. OpenStreetMap sees increasing traffic from "fake" user
agents, and it is likely that we will penalise user agents like that at
some point in the future - meaning tiles will still be served, but
slower than to "honest" user agents that don't pretend to be a browser
when they are not. We understand that this is difficult terrain and that
other data sources might actually *require* that you pretend to be a
browser - perhaps per-datasource overrides of the user agent are a
possibility.

2. As you know, OpenStreetMap thrives on contributions by mappers, and
one of the main reasons we make our tiles freely available is the hope
of attracting new contributors. It would be nice if QGIS could do its
part to help us here, by making their users aware that OSM is open for
everyone to contribute. Perhaps a link to
http://www.openstreetmap.org/fixthemap can be placed somewhere in the
layer description or something.

a proposal by Jorge Gustavo Rocha:
> 2. The QGIS community is very much aware of OpenStreetMap. If we really
> need to make our users more aware, does it make sense to add a new
> button to QGIS to report map errors? (context dependent, when the
> OpenStreetMap layer is shown) It would have the same functionality of
> the notes in OpenStreetMap web interface.

3. Our data is licensed under ODbL 1.0, and our map tiles are CC-BY-SA
2.0. The latter could change at any time; the former is
relatively constant.

The legal consequences of this situation for your users are:

* If they publish an image in which our tiles are visible, they must
attribute OpenStreetMap as the source, and specify that the map image is
CC-BY-SA 2.0, and specify that the data behind it is ODbL 1.0. All these
requirements can be fulfilled in one go by linking to
www.openstreetmap.org/copyright but there is no legal requirement to
link to that page.

a proposal:
> 3.1 On the "add layer" dialog, we can show the OpenStreetMap url (which
> might change over time) and licenses (for data and tiles) taken from
> settings or an (external) resource. We can make this not hard coded, to
> be modified easily, without upgrading QGIS. We can also check if the
> service is enabled for us, before allow users to add that layer (related
> with 4.).

* Everyone is allowed to create derivatives of OpenStreetMap data - for
example by tracing features on the OSM tiles - and freely distribute
them. Such derived datasets, unless they are "insubstantial"
(https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence/Community_Guidelines/Substantial_-_Guideline)
inherit the ODbL license and must, when publicly used, on request be
made available under ODbL.

a proposal:
> 3.2 When the tiles are used in the composer or on the web client, we can
> not enforce an attribution string. We might add or suggest it, but users
> should be free the create and edit the attributions. It the
> responsibility of the user, not a QGIS responsibility.

4. If the load coming from QGIS should be unexpectedly high and impact
our service performance, there might come a time where we'd have to
throttle or even switch off this access. You should have some mechanism
or plan that deals with that to avoid frustration among your user base -
maybe a mechanism where QGIS installations request updated tile sources
from a central service so you could notify them of the OSM tiles not
being available (or being available elsewhere) should the need arise.

Anyone interested?
All the best.

Just a followup to this, I filed an issue here [0]

It seems something is wrong in @geometry_point_num array when zooming at a
level where the geometry is cropped by the canvas extent. 

This is the expression doing the work in a line geometry generator on a
marker line symbol: 

z(point_n($geometry, at geometry_point_num))

I'm with Matthias: the Form Aware plugin has some limitations, for example
it does not work in the attribute table but it only works in the form view.

BTW, I agree that the functionality should be in core.

Unfortunately it is not an easy task and requires a deep understanding of
the attribute table and form widgets implementation and might require a
refactoring of the whole system, I'm afraid I'm not the right person to
address this issue.

I really hope that eventually somebody will find the time and funds to make
this enhancement.

Hi all,
during a meeting with Etienne and Alessnadro we put up this proposal:
* add an entry in settings with an URL where we store details about XYZ
servers
* add a button on the Add XYZ dialog "Get default servers"
* QGIS connects to the URL above and get the list with:
  * URL of the service
  * user agent required for it
  * notes and explanations (where all details about participation and
licencing requested by OSM foundation will be stored and displayed).
Does this make sense? Any comments?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I did a PR [1], very simple. This discussion is now about the best
approach to handle all settings, in all platforms. I'm working on that.

Best regards,

Hi,

We just finished our discussion on the unified add layer dialog and we are
optimistic that it will make its way into 3.0. You can find a short summary
of the planned steps at the end of the doc:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aMX9jOfl10q8oETRzOHSHnRpHCc7UJ1dDnCCq3VyTAY/edit?usp=sharing

Please feel free to ask if there are any questions.

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 2017 QGIS Grant Proposals final results
Message-ID: <CADwz+dWYTX=Xn1FMM_zYxxjNhjb=K-S0=0r1M-4kQuptUnjxeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Thanks for your patience while you waited for us to prepare the final
results for the grant proposals. I hope it was worth the wait since we
managed to make some more funds available to support more than the planned
EUR 20,000 of proposals.  Read all about the successful proposals here:
