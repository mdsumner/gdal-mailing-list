Can you specify a vector from some public data set?
Large file with attributes? There is a bug in pipe implementation
on windows <= 5.1 (xp workstation) but I am not sure if
it is causing crash.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding delimited text file as layer...
Message-ID: <1159773026.8297.0.camel@localhost>

Hello,

I have written a program to approximate the location of GSM cellphone
users. At this moment all I really need QGIS for is to display the
approximated points as well as the GPS points on a map (added as
shapefile layer) - which pop-up after the calculations.

I would like to use a comma-delimited text file X,Y to add the points as
a layer. (It's OK if the points are in separate text files)
I thought this would be relatively easy as this is already done rather
easily in the QGIS 0.8 gui. However I struggle to keep my head together
with all the gui slots and Qtishness (I'm new to Qt as well).

I'm using Tim Sutton's "Tutorial 2: Using MapTools with the QGIS Canvas
API" as a base point. How can I extend this code (with simple includes
and of course on the same map canvas) to add a points layer from a
delimited text file?

Best Regards to fellow Developers!

Message-ID: <200610011037.41226.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Dear qgis developers and users,

I commited a --with-wfs switch to the autobuild system to compile the wfs 
client. So if I use ./autogen.sh ..... --with-wfs, the wfs provider and 
plugin are built on my system. However, I suppose that this may not hold true 
for all other systems (especially as I am not used to the auto* tools). Write 
to the list if you have troubles because of this commit and I'll try to 
resolve it asap.
Also note that the wfs provider/plugin will not be included in 0.8 binary 
release because of its unstable state.

cheers,
Marco

Hi,

the usage should be the same, you just need to load the layer with
other provider and with different URI. Here's how it's done in
delimited text plugin:

QString uri = QString("%1?delimiter=%2&xField=%3&yField=%4")
  .arg(filePath)
  .arg(delimiter)
  .arg(xField)
  .arg(yField);

// use "delimitedtext" provider instead of "ogr"
QgsVectorLayer* layer = new QgsVectorLayer(uri, name, "delimitedtext");

Where:
- filePath = complete path to the file
- delimiter = delimiter of the fields
- xField = name of the column with x values
- yField = name of the column with y values
- name = base name of the file (e.g. for path "/tmp/test.txt" it's "test")

I haven't tried that, it's just what I've looked up in the code (take
look at the plugin / provider to find out more).

Hi,
I am just curious, are you running the application on a smart phone?
How do you read the information about BS, distance and signal strength?
Once I was thinking about it but then I found that it is not possible
to get such info in a phone, at least in java it was not.

Hi Radim,

No, sorry the localisation software is network-based (though it can be
used with a cellphone with some adaptions). 

I have done some drive tests with a TEMS drive test hardware and
software (which provide the measurement reports) and Garmin GPS. The
measurement reports contains the signal strength of the serving and
neighbouring cells, the timing advance (TA=1 is distance of approx.
554m) and other measurements. The cellphone was set to engineering mode
and if I understand correctly this is possible with any cellphone. 

The PlaceLabs (placelab.org) localisation software, which is
mobile-based, I think, was written in Java and full source code is
available at their site. It also provides localisation functionality for
different comm's protocols (802.11, GSM, Bluetooth). The method uses
normal cellID (location is position of serving cell) and a very crude
projection so don't expect very good accuracy.

An IEEE paper that might interest you is "GSM-based Mobile Positioning
using WAP" by Chris, LC Wong, M.C. Lee and Raymond, KW Chan, 2000. More
about locating and implementation than setup, though.

Hope that answers the question (at least partially).

Schalk

P.S. I'm doing this as part of my final year project at varsity so I'm
not exactly an expert:-)

Hi Radim,

 if the phone modem supports it, then
AT+CREG=2
for the base station info, and
AT+CSQ, or AT@HTCCSQ on some HTC phones
for the signal strength.

 Oleg.

Hi Martin,

Sorry for late reply.

Thanks for the tip. It works perfectly! 

I had the same idea, but couldn't quite fit it all together. The
explanation for each parameter helped a lot.

Hi Marco

The addition of `$GEOS_CONFIG --cflags`/geos to GEOS_CFLAGS in 
acinclude.m4 prevents the compilation of the GRASS plugin on a Mac and 
probably NetBSD as well. The failure occurs even when --with-wfs is not 
specified.

qgsgrassshell.cpp uses openpty which is defined in pty.h for most *nix 
but in util.h for NetBSD and Mac OS X (a BSD derivative). Since the geos 
directory contains a different util.h, globally adding the geos path to 
GEOS_CFLAGS prevents other qgis directories from finding the system 
util.h on BSD systems.

By reverting to the previous acinclude.m4, I was able to compile again 
without --with-wfs. If I add --with-wfs, I get an indexStrtree.h not 
found error. The fix may be to add the geos path only in the wfs 
makefiles so that it doesn't affect other modules.

Hi everyone,

1. I want to change the symbols displayed on my map. e.g. to the car
symbol. My current code looks like this:

// Change symbol
QString strSymbolName = "car"; ////
QgsSymbol * syCar = new QgsSymbol; ////
syCar->setNamedPointSymbol(strSymbolName); ////
syCar->setPointSize(6);
//............................................
QgsVectorLayer * mypLayerPoints = new QgsVectorLayer(uri, "results",
"delimitedtext");
QgsSingleSymbolRenderer *mypRendererPoints = new
QgsSingleSymbolRenderer(mypLayerPoints->vectorType());
mypRendererPoints->addSymbol(syCar); ////

Unfortunately the symbols are not displayed then :-( 
Should I specify the path to the svg folder?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Also: is it possible to display a jpeg file as a map in QGIS? If
possible will the projection def's be similar to those for shape files?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How can I change the projection used for the delimited text file
layer?

P.S. Placelabs uses location fingerprinting for their estimations. Much
more accurate than CellID (see previous post)

You have to use a class derived from QgsSymbol - in your case it's
QgsMarkerSymbol. To specify the picture to be displayed use
setPicture(QString) function and pass the full path of the SVG as an
argument.

Yes it's possible, it depends on whether you have jpeg support
compiled in GDAL library. QGIS currently doesn't support projections
for raster layers.

Changing projection of the vector layer can be done with:
layer->coordinateTransform()->sourceSRS().createFromSrsId(srsid);
layer->coordinateTransform()->initialise();

For creating SRS you can use some other functions, e.g.:
createFromWkt, createFromEpsg, ...
(see QgsSpatialRefSys header for more information)


I haven't tried the code I've written here so maybe they won't work...
it's just how I think they should work :-)

And does the wfs plugin work? My expectation is that connect (GetCapabilities) 
will fail.

Is this a limitation inherent to the Mac platform? If yes, I have to change 
the plugin and provider a bit.
The WFS plugin is linked to the WFS provider. This is because of the 
GetCapabilities request which is implemented as static method 
QgsWFSProvider::GetCapabilities.
I think i will just move the GetCapabilities method from the provider to the 
plugin. I would then also move QgsHttpTransaction to the qgis core library 
because it is used from wms provider, wfs provider and wfs plugin.

I don't see any use for jpeg as a map if you cannot set the
projection :-( Guess I'll have to use the shapefiles (perhaps simplified
to save on loading time)

Message-ID: <39f4276e0610050119l25bb6338n3d2ab2757caff8c3@mail.gmail.com>

greetings developers,
i am currently coding a plugin which will make use of map tools but it
is giving me seg fault.
Operation is such : plugin has a pointer to qgsmaptoolzoom, on
activating action for this plugin it do

PointTool::PointTool(QgisApp * theQGisApp,
				       QgisIface * theQgisInterface):
                 QgisPlugin(sName,sDescription,sPluginVersion,sPluginType),
                 mQGisApp(theQGisApp),
                 mQGisIface(theQgisInterface)
{
	zoomTool=new QgsMapToolZoom(mQGisIface->getMapCanvas(),false);
}

void PointTool::okReceived()
{
	mQGisIface->getMapCanvas()->setMapTool(zoomTool);
	
}
this will make zoomTool current map tool.
Aftert this if i select tool identifyfeature, and again select
zoomTool from plugin menu it results in segmentation fault. I couldn't
find solution for this problem. please help me get out of it. The code
which i put up is i think only relevant here, rest is std generated by
plugin builder or i can put whole code.

Hi,

if I recall correctly, you shouldn't store map tool because the tool
is owned by map canvas and the old tool gets always deleted in
QgsMapCanvas::setMapTool. So your code should look like

void PointTool::okReceived()
{
        QgsMapCanvas* canvas = mQGisIface->getMapCanvas();
        canvas->setMapTool(new QgsMapToolZoom(canvas,false));
}

Hope that helps,
Martin

I think you might have misinterpreted Martin's comment. Qgis knows about
projections for raster layers, but it is currently unable to reproject
raster layers. Hence if you have images in a known single projection, you
can display then, and also display vectors layers on top of them,
reprojected as necessary.

Gavin

thanks martin , it did help and solved my issue.

segmentation fault was happening at qgsmapcanvas.cpp :818
818:            if(tool && too->isZoomTool())

 but i still have some doubt. This issue is arising with tools
available at ATTRIBUTE TOOLBAR. There are no issue with the ones
available at navigation tool bar but we use same code for both.

thanks one again
regards
quickNitin.

Note that I added also
QgsMapCanvas::unsetMapTool(QgsMapTool* mapTool)
to delete current tool if it matches the passed one
(or the last non zoom) e.g. when tool has to be stopped from plugin.
Maybe a better solution exists?  Note that the current tool
(last non-zoom) can only be deleted if it is that set previously
by plugin.

Oh? So my tutorial is wrong?

http://blog.qgis.org/?q=node/14

I created the tools in the ctor and store them as class members. My
tutorial app works - is this just because by luck the memory used by
the pointer hasnt been overwritten? I thought delete will clear the
memory used too?

Tim

Hi Tim,

now I took another look on your tutorial and the map canvas sources
and - yes, that tutorial doesn't fit exactly into my original thoughts
of how should it work. Why does it work? I've found out that it's
because of a bug in QgsMapCanvas::setMapTool that prevents deletion of
old tool when changing from zoom tool to another zoom tool (since also
tool for panning is considered as zoom tool). This also means that a
memory leak is happening in QGIS when switching between memory tools.

So, the question is - how to solve this. I would say that the way how
you use map tools in the tutorial is more straightforward. I guess the
best way is to modify the setMapTool function (and some others calling
it) not to take ownership and not to delete the map tools. I'll
investigate it and will alter that if I won't find any great problems.
This will result in policy that caller will create the map tool and
will have to delete it afterwards - and the tutorial can be left
unmodified :-)

What do you think about that?

Martin

Hi Radim,

well, probably the way how does it work currently is not really ideal.
In my previous post (reply to Tim) I've suggested another possibility,
hopefully easier to comprehend. However now I'm not sure if that won't
bring any drawbacks.

I see one problem: e.g. GRASS edit has its own set of map tools. The
question is what to do when grass edit ends - what tool to activate:
Leave map canvas without any tool? Set panning tool as active? If so,
how to get the pointer to panning tool to make sure that button
associated with the tool will be activated?

Hi,

The link to "Windows and OSX releases" on main WGIS dowload site leads
to
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55820&package_id=123955
where only 0.7.4 is available.

Those listed in http://gisalaska.com/torrents/ are dead: connection
rejected.

Luckily I found a Windows 0.8 prev2 binary in the news section. Please
add it to dowload where it belongs.

Thanks,

Hi

The 0.8rc2 will not go into the downloads section since we would
prefer visitors to the site to get the latest stable version (0.7.4).
If the link for the torrent is broken thats a different issue and I
will take a look and remove / fix /replace the link.

But you do provide the 0.8 preview there already (via torrent), only
that the link is not working. And it is 3 months older (RC1?) than the
newest 0.8 RC2 you could provide instead.

It crashes when the connect is done. Some of the other plugins fail to 
load if needed routines cannot be found so I incorrectly assumed that if 
it loaded, it must have resolved all symbols.

It appears to be a limitation for straight-forward cross-platform code 
and makefiles. It might be possible to do something using 
platform-specific link flags. I don't know.

When I looked at this a year ago for grass, partitioning the grass 
provider into two pieces was an understandable and finite task whereas 
learning the link flags was open-ended with no guarantee for success. 
(The grass provider now contains only the provider API, provider.cpp. 
The other provider files moved to libqgisgrass which is shared by both 
provider and plugin.)

It looks like a Linux plugin has the same capabilities as a library 
while a Mac plugin is a lightweight leaf module that cannot function as 
a library.

Since libtool says using a plugin as a library is non-portable, I am 
trusting the libtool developers who know far more about link flags than 
I do.

sir,
what i think developers like me will be intrested in some tutorial
which will let mark on map.

For example currently for adding anything over a map i had create a
new shapefile later which i had to delete since i intended only to
mark some positions on map for some time. which later i may want to
save as a overlay over map .Also this new shape layer creation donot
allow me to delete any element. There is no such tool available.
This will be very helpful for people which are monitoring something
over a region and want to  make some decision over them. For example i
am monitoring a region and want to mark position of tiger noticed in
that area.
And also ,just  a passing thougght , how different symbols can be
added for them.

Currently i am in process of making a plugin which will do so but as i
can see it is unefficient since i had to copy a lot of data( because
tool gets deleted everytime.).

i am eagerly waiting now for such tutorial

regards
quickNitin

Hi Tom,

Thanks for explaining this. After my holydays I will have time to move 
GetCapabilities to the plugin to make it portable.

Yes, plus you must check somehow if another tool was not selected
already, for example:
1) grass - select new point tool
2) qgis - select identify feature tool
3) grass - exit editing

In this situation we dont want to disable 'identify feature tool'
we only have to delete 'grass new point tool' from last non-zoom.
That is the reason I pass pointer to original tool to unsetMapTool
so that current tool is only deleted if it matches the tool previously
set by plugin.

Hi everyone,

1. Can someone tell me what this output means (and perhaps how to fix
it :-) ? 

I'm trying to display a shapefile (11.4MB) as a map and two
delimited-text file layers on top of it. The delimited text layers add
fine, but the shapefile is not displaying. I change the projection
before I add it, to one of the srsids.

Here's my settings: (works for the polys.shp: shapefile of the world
example)

QString myLayerPath         = "layers";	//relative to execution dir
QString myLayerBaseName     = "long_name";
QString myProviderName      = "ogr";

and the output:
----------------------------------------------
(fileVectorFilters), Driver count: : 0

Unable to invoke fileVectorFilters()

qgsmaprender.cpp: 154: (adjustExtentToSize) Current extent is
0.0000000000000000,0.0000000000000000 :
0.0000000000000000,0.0000000000000000
----------------------------------------------

2. How to add a jpeg image to a mapcanvas, if possible?

I have this code from qgsrasterlayer.h
------------------------------------------------------------
 QString myFileNameQString = "layers/final2.jpg";
 QFileInfo myFileInfo(myFileNameQString);
 QString myBaseNameQString = myFileInfo.baseName();
 QgsRasterLayer *myRasterLayer = new QgsRasterLayer(myFileNameQString,
myBaseNameQString);

 connect( myRasterLayer, SIGNAL(repaintRequested()), mapCanvas,
SLOT(refresh()) ); // necessary?
 -----------------------------------------------------------

Dazed and confused...

Hello Tim,

First, thanks again for a great tutorial! (Tutorial 4: Adding a raster
to the map canvas) These tutorials are really insightful to newbies like
me who learn best by example.

The caveat is in the same place though:
I used the exact code from Tutorial 4 (with the adaptions to .pro file)
with my jpeg file as raster. The program runs without clear errors but
no image is displayed on map.

i.e. only changed
  QFileInfo myRasterFileInfo("data/final2.jpg");

This error is still present:
empty extent... not rendering

Does this mean I do not have jpg compiled with gdal? I've recompiled
QGIS and everything seemed fine.

Best Regards
Schalk

Hi

You need ideally to have a .wld file accompanying your jpg file. In  
general .jpg is not in my opinion a good format to use for gis  
because a) its lossy and b) the decompression overhead removes much  
of the benifit of the smaller file size. Some changes were made to  
qgis svn a month or two back to allow non georeferenced images to at  
least display at coords 0,0. Can you try to open the file in QGIS and  
see what happens. Best choice is to create a .wld file to accompany  
it with the registration data needed for your jpg to appear in the  
right place. Im attaching a wld file from one of my datasets  as an  
example.

Regards

Tim

I have added the first of two tutorials that will address this at:

http://blog.qgis.org/?q=node/28
Tutorial 5: Creating temporary features on the map canvas

I will do a follow up tutorial that covers using point markers  
transiently as soon as I have time.

Really? Qt is GPL and AFAIK there are no restrictions for compiler
in GPL. We plan (I believe) to use Visual C++ in future because it is
more native - Martin?

> could somebody

I think that you can follow instructions for crosscompilation on Linux
because it is also using MinGW:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingWindowsBinaryOnLinux

Definitely we need more (well at least one) developers working
on Windows with possibility to debug (impossible with crosscompiler).
If you manage to compile with MinGW on windows, it would be very
appretiated if you put a zip package with all precompiled/installed
dependencies so that others can start easily.

Right, good point. I think the best would be to call unsetMapTool
automatically in destructor of map tool, thus map tool users won't
need to think about cases like this.

Radim is right, GPL-ed Qt4 for windows doesn't have any compiler
restrictions, but only MinGW is supported by Trolltech. Qt-win project
provides a set of patches to enable compilation with MSVC and Borland
compilators. See wiki page:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Building_QT_4_with_Visual_C%2B%2B_2005

Mateusz Loskot managed to compile also QGIS with MSVC and provided his notes:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Building_Quantum_GIS_with_Visual_C%2B%2B_2005
Beware, the project files on the page are not being actively
maintained since then and you'll probably need to tweak them.

I think Tim has been playing with MinGW on windows recently, but I
don't know about the status of his effort.

I've also tried to compile QGIS on windows - both with MinGW and
Visual C++ - and both with success. But only the Lib-Refactoring SVN
branch and by using CMake system. That eliminates the need of automake
& friends, therefore my experience doesn't include building current
version of QGIS. However I plan to provide precompiled environment for
building once I get it to a more final status.

Dear all,

I want to use GRASS plug-in for digitizing and managing vector layers. I But
I do not know where I should start. (Of course I had import GRASS plug-in
using QGIS plug-in manager) How can I start GRASS? Should I, install GRASS
extra than QGIS? Just my platform is Windows XP. 

I guess that my following question isn't suited for QGIS developers but
please inform and suggest to me.
	- GRASS vs. Proprietary GIS systems like ArcGIS, ENVI and etc...
	- Can GRASS do common GIS functionality?

Excuse me please; I am not a GIS user,

greetings,
I have some peculiar pbm.
In a plugin, i am receiving some data through Qthread and storing in a
struct. I am showing these as customised qgsmapcanvasitem over map on
qgsmapcanvas but i couldn;'t do . This code is part of a plugin for
qgis0.7.9  .here is what i have done:

void Plot::drawShape(QPainter & p)
{

// 	if(p.isActive())
// 		cout<<"\nPainter is not active cpp=271";
// 	else
// 		cout<<"\n Painter is aCtive";
	 p.setPen(Qt::SolidLine);
	 p.setBrush(Qt::SolidPattern);
	 int flag=0;
	int temp1=0,temp2=0;
	//-------------------------doing a code for displaying
objects-------------------------
	
	for(int i=0 ;i <4; i++)
	{	MyMapCanvasItem *tempItem;
		if(mth.mData.id[i]>0)

MyMapCanvasItem((int)mth.mData.id[i],pt.x(),pt.y(),mQGisIface->getMapCanvas());
		
		tempItem->setBrush(Qt::red);
		QListIterator<MyMapCanvasItem*> itr(myItemList);
		while(itr.hasNext())                      //comparing whether it
already exists
		{	
			temp1=(itr.next())->myId();
			temp2=tempItem->myId();
			if(temp1==temp2)
				flag==1;
			cout<<temp1<<temp2<<" ";
		}
		cout<<"\n";
		
		 if(flag==1)      //if yes then just set new position of it
		 {	 QgsPoint qpt(mth.mData.x[i]/10,mth.mData.y[i]/10);
		 	QPoint pt=toCanvasCoords(qpt);
			tempItem->setX(	pt.x());	
			tempItem->setY(pt.y());
			tempItem->canvas()->update();
			update();
			flag=0;
			//tempItem->show();
		 }
		 else   //else add it to master list of objects
		 {
		  myItemList.append(tempItem);
			tempItem->setBrush(Qt::red);
			tempItem->canvas()->update();// so that update is called.
			update();
		}
		
		
		cout<<"\n";
	}
	update();
....

here i am creating object adding to list, but everytime i am creating
new. hat ican take acre of. But nohig is getting visible despite i
have put code for update(). I am not calling drawShape(qpainter &P) of
mymapcanvasitem since it is protected , if i make it public, item do
appear but is it propr way. Also this way i am not able to move them.

I also have query about function QgsMapCanvasItem::setRect(). why it
is required.Do this has got anything to do with visibility of this
objet. I have set complete map extent as visible in updateExtent()
because i couldn't got reason for this.


Earlier  i was drawing pixmap there in position of MyMapCanvasItem
object handling drawing. This way i want to let user hav right click
option menu ( sort of context menu ) over these canvasItem and do some
operations realtive to these objects like changing their color,
displaying dome lable with it.( i will go through  new tool for right
click. Will plugin tool  affect such functionality in some way).
I have tried this context menu type operation on simple qt application
over canvas item recognising them through rtti().
Please help me in this regards, i am stuck with it for quite some time now.

Not that I know of. I'll let you know when I get the mingw version.
I'm going off to a conference for a week so it may take a couple of
weeks to have it ready....unless the conference is very boring in
which case itll be sooner :-P

Hi,

first of all, I don't like the way you use drawShape function... it
should be used just for painting the canvas item, not for creating
other map canvas items. Why not to send a signal from the worker
thread and create a slot which will add new canvas item and update
canvas?

One more thought: do you call setVisible() or show() function in
canvas item construction to make your canvas item visible? It's hidden
by default.

You have to specify canvas item position and size to let Q3Canas know
what portion of canvas you'll use for drawing. Normally you use move()
and setSize() functions from Q3CanvasItem. As map canvas items usually
work with map coordinates and not canvas coordinates, setRect() is a
convenience function to make setting this rectangle easier. There's
also function updatePosition() which is called from map canvas when
extent has changed or canvas is being panned. The default
implementation sets item's position and size regarding to rectangle
set by setRect(). This is how e.g. QgsRubberBand works.

If you don't like this approach, you can override this behaviour by
using your custom updatePosition() function. This is used in
QgsVertexMarker.

Probably a tutorial on creating own map canvas items and map tools
would be good ... probably an inspiration for Tim? ;-)

I had managed to show points by making drawShape() (if show() do not
help much) a public function in custonItem class . And yes
custom-qgsCanvasItem::drawShape() do not get called on update().
Also Whatever elements i am drawing, i have set rtti() value 1234 but
in mouse press event collision list, it donot appear. Only rtti it
shows id 5, 11111.
Is there any issue in implementation of custom-qgscanvasitem class? as
i see it is pretty straight also i had tried this as dummy it is
working well.

Actually I am software engineer and we are developing some plug-ins in QGIS
for our local needs. My team includes "content provider" team. They are
masters and experts in GIS and Remote Sensing field. They are now using some
expert systems like an ENVI, ArcGIS, ArcMap and etc... You know that all
above systems are proprietary, they are license cost is so expensive for
developing country like a Mongolia. Therefore we are looking alternative
variant for affordable expert GIS software like a GRASS. But we can not
compare and benchmark between our two variants (ENVI vs. GRASS etc...).

Just we are using QGIS for ordinary users, not for professional one, and we
are interesting GRASS for our professional users. 

Please, advice to me and compare ENVI vs. GRASS.

Best regards,
	Byambaa Mendbayar

Hello Mendbayar,
 A good place to start is to simply install Qgis for windows:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/qgis-0.8.0_Preview-2.zip

 If you are just getting started using/learning GIS, that is a good
 place to start. QGIS has basic capabilities like digitizing and
 managing vector layers. GRASS is more sophisticated and difficult to
 learn. But, the best way to use it is as a plug-in.

 You might also try the mapwindow GIS software. It is very good and
 easier to learn. It also has many plugins. It requires two installs,
 the microsoft windows install and the .NET framework:

http://www.mapwindow.org/download.php?show_details=1

Hi,

here are recent results from KDE guys and their generic widget for
displaying geographical maps:

http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/2429

The app looks nice, also with some basic automatic label placement.
What about using that widget instead of current map canvas? ;-)

You have made drawShape() a public function and call it directly? This
is not good since it violates the principles of canvas items. If
drawShape() is not called on update(), there must be another problem.
If you're using custom canvas item for drawing a point on the map, why
not to use directly QgsVertexMarker or use that code and customize it?

Basically a custom map canvas item should work like this:

1. creation: constructed with pointer to map canvas
  MyItem::MyItem(QgsMapCanvas* canvas)
  : QgsMapCanvasItem(canvas) // call constructor of the base class
  { /* some construction */ }

2. set position, visibility and update:
 - option A: using default updatePosition()
    when you want to redraw item:
    1. if item's position or shape changed, call setRect(...)
    2. to change visibility (hidden by default!): show() or hide() or
setVisibility(bool)
    3. to update both item and canvas: updateCanvas()
 - option B: using custom updatePosition()
    override updatePosition() which calls move() and setSize() with
appropriate values
    when you want to redraw item: the same as with option A, just use
    updatePosition() to update position and size instead of setRect()

3. drawing - in drawShape() - this function is called when canvas gets
updated, the item is visible and is scheduled for update
   use toCanvasCoords convenience function to convert from map coordinates
   to canvas coordinates which are used by QPainter

That could mean that your canvas item is not bound to map canvas if
you can't find the item in the list of all items.

Please check whether your code follows the rules I've mentioned above.
If you still can't get it to work, try to post your plugin (or at
least implementation of your custom canvas item) so I can take a look.

Try browsing GRASS lists first:
http://grass.itc.it/community/support.php (the nabbles archive seems
easiest in use IMHO). Then ask directly on the GRASS lists, maybe some
GRASS folks have experierence with ENVI.

Cool! The automatic label placement is one of the top missing features
in current qgis now IMHO.
How feasible would it be to join forces? I think qgis team is a bit
short of resources now.
Are we sure they know about qgis?
All the best.

I think the screencasts idea is one that users would love:

http://lists.qgis.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2006-August/000364.html

I know it requires much time to prepare good casts, but I also
believe non-programmers could find it as a great way to support
QGIS project.

As an example of cool screencasts, here are Inkscape workshops for
polish users, with voice instructions:

http://www.inf.sgsp.edu.pl/lab/filmiki/filmiki.php

The website is in polish, sorry.
You can click *.mpeg links from the pink table and watch
them, as an example.

These screencasts were recorded using xvidcap program:

IMHO joining forces is very unlikely - mainly because of different
goals. While they would like to create a simple widget with limited
functionality for KDE4 applications, we want create a comlete GIS
software. You can see their main goals in an earlier post:

http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/2412

Yes, it is - and killing bugs is quite time consuming task...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] API change: map tools
Message-ID: <e8e7199c0610121703t5599ba91t387b5d020ae9c3e7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

according to recent debate on qgis-developer list (in thread
"segmentation fault in plugin using zoom tool"), I've modified the way
how to work with map tools (in revision 5940).

Till now, after setting QgsMapCanvas::setMapTool() map canvas took
ownership of the tool and when it was replaced with another tool, it
got deleted. This showed to be a bit problematic.

New way of using map tools is that caller must save the pointer to the
map tool. When you call setMapTool(), the old tool gets deactivated
and new tool gets activated and set as current. Later, tool has to be
deleted by the owner. There's no problem to delete a tool while it's
being still used as QgsMapTool constructor calls
QgsMapCanvas::unsetMapTool which stops to use that tool if it's active
(or saved as last non-zoom tool).

I hope that it won't introduce any new problems, but if so, let me know.

Martin

thanks martin,

step 1 i am dong fine.
step 2 is fishy in my code.
step 3 is what i expect from code but was not working. i Will try to
improve on that.
If things donot happen i will certaily post my code.

GRASS plugin and georeferencer have been updated to reflect this
change - it's in revision 5940.

Could you be more specific about the compilation errors? Do you have
yacc/bison and lex/flex installed and in path?

I know about a problem with unistd.h: generated file wanted to include
this file but it doesn't exist in MSVC. Workaround is to create empty
unistd.h in MSVC's include directory.

Yes, I have flex and bison installed and in path. I added unistd.h from flex 
and bison installation directory.

this is the error I get:

I also tried "byacc" instead of "bison -y" with no success, I also update  
qgssearchstringlexer.ll and qgssearchstringlexer.yy from svn today.

This looks like qmake uses some special flags to generate these files
- instead of "yyparse" the parser function is called
"qgssearchstringparserparse", also lexer function "yylval" seems to be
called differently. I would suggest copying these generated files from
auto-maked sources:
- qgssearchstringparser.cc
- qgssearchstringparser.h
- qgssearchstringlexer.cc
to if it will compile correctly. Or you can try to override qmake
settings, but I don't know how.

I found the error and is caused by bison incorrect creation of 
qgssearchstringparser.h

this line is generated :

extern YYSTYPE qgssearchstringparserlval;

instead of:

extern YYSTYPE yylval;

I made the change manually and I was able to continue with compilation.

+1 for me.
Preview 2 was released one month ago, preview 3 could be a good "stay
tuned" message for users...

Also I would suggest to add at least a note to the download page that
states that 0.8 preview versions are available since one would expect
that download page contains the most recent version. It's possible to
see it in forum that users download "last" version (0.7.4) and ask
about missing features which are already in 0.8.

Hi,

currently QGIS doesn't install include file to the PREFIX/include/qgis
directory. I guess this is happening since the refactoring to
libraries. Is that intended?

Hi

Id be happy to put out the preview 3 release that but I cant do it
until I get back from my trip to the US (around the 22nd or so). How
about we target it for the end of the month?

Regards

Guys,

I don't know how actuall Radim's comment is currently, but I want to
let all QGISers know that the main (if not the only) reason for the
slowdown I suffered from were Ubuntu Dapper's *default* XORG settings
for ATI cards. You can find a solution to the problem in my last post
in the https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/295.

In short, if using the Dapper's default settings for ATI graphics,
which are driver 'radeon' and XAA accel mode, and suffering from
slow-downs in 2D graphics, you should add:

Option "XaaNoOffscreenPixmaps"

to your xorg.conf.

Without this tweak the performance of my X700 (and X600 on another
machine) ATI board was sluggish in 2D, but somehow bearable until I
noticed it in QGIS. That's why I blamed it on QGIS at first. Sorry for
the fuss. It seems QGIS has nothing to do with it.

Cheers,
Maciek

Subject: [Qgis-developer] buffer feature, problem...
Message-ID: <20061016075717.5EA271B71A@qgis.org>

Dear developers,

I was testing buffer feature in my workstation. But I didn't successes. I
got "Unable to add geometry column to the output table ..." message.

My project projection is WGS-84, therefore give a "Buffer distance in map
units:" value by 0.0001 (it means geographic degree to meter). But it isn't
solving this problem. 

After that I was changing my projection from WGS-84 to NAD27 (UTM). Also it
isn't solving this problem.

Please advice to me, what's wrong in my buffering task? What should I do for
buffer features? 

P.S please see enclosed 2 screenshot.

Thanks and best regards,
	Byambaa Mendbayar

Dear list, 

I try to compile qgis from svn today on debian sarge with qt4.1.0 with following

Hi Otto,

this is weird. It looks like files generated by flex/bison don't exist
or have not been compiled. Could you check whether there are files
qgssearchstringlexer.cpp and qgssearchstringparser.cpp in src/core
directory?

Hi Martin,

they don't exist in src/core

ls ./debian/qgis-0.8.0cvs/src/core/qgssearchstring*
 
qgssearchstring.cpp 
qgssearchstringlexer.ll
qgssearchstringparser.yy
qgssearchstring.h
qgssearchstringparser.cc

My bad, their extension should be .cc. Can you take a look in
src/core/.libs directory whether files
libqgis_core_la-qgssearchstringlexer.o and
libqgis_core_la-qgssearchstringparser.o exist? If so, could post to
some place those two generated .cc files so I can take a look if
they're ok?

Have you tried to do make distclean and then start building again?
Is this first time you compile 0.8 from sources or you managed to
build it earlier?

no they don't exist

ls ./debian/qgis-0.8.0cvs/src/core/.libs/
libqgis_core.a   libqgis_core.lai  libqgis_core.so.0
libqgis_core.la  libqgis_core.so   libqgis_core.so.0.0.1

- yes, I used make distclean several times before. 
- no, I haven't build a current svn source in this environment (debian sarge)
before, it is a new chroot installation. But I just tried to compile it under
debian etch and there is is no problem, so there is probably something missing
in my sarge installation, I guess.

Hi,

this is a problem :-/
I don't know how to cope with this issue, BUT if you really want to
compile QGIS with MSVC, you can try Lib_Refactoring-branch from SVN
which I'm working on. You can find some information about it on wiki
page:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Splitting_Into_Libraries
In that branch there are many resolved dependencies and more - see the
list on the wiki page. Moreover CMake is used in favour of autotools
and I've managed to build it successfully on windows using both mingw
and msvc. But this branch is still relatively unstable and some things
might not work correctly.

Other possibility is to use Mateusz's howto for building with MSVC here:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Building_Quantum_GIS_with_Visual_C%2B%2B_2005
but probably you will need to tweak the attached project files.

Martin is right.
The procedure is correct and still up to date, but the attached
solution with project files have not been updated for a few months.
Although, I'm sure it shouldn't be hassle to update it and make it
usable with latest QGIS.

Unfortunately, I can't help you with it before November.

Cheers

Hi Martin, 

I guess I have to bother again, because I am still not able to compile a current
QGIS SVN Rev 5967 from today (same error) but I was just able to compile and
test the released Preview2 sources on the same debian sarge machine.

Do you have another idea, what might be the problem? 

thanks a lot
  Otto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qt4 on 64bit
Message-ID: <cd3583a82aee5.4536b7c4@shaw.ca>

Hi all,
I'm trying to build qgis_unstable on fedora core 5, 64bit.  I got stuck for a while trying to get past Qt configure checks - and have finally got it.

My libs are stored in /usr/lib64 and this is the 'standard' used in the latest qt4-devel rpm for my 64bit environment.  This seems to be the root my trouble.

Two observations:
1) I got confused by needing to use --with-qtdir since qt4 doesn't install in the same way as qt3 in this environment.  It just puts everything in /usr/lib64 and /usr/include.  So I was forced to set --with-qtdir=/usr.  Can we change it so that it automatically checks there?

2) The configure check for lib vs lib64 is failing for some reason.  It is around line 19374 in configure or in the top of acinclude.m4:

 if test "`echo ${libdir} | sed -e  's#.*lib64.*#64#'`" = "64" ; then 
   _lib="lib64"
 else
   _lib="lib"
 fi

I don't know how to fix the test (or even test the test!) but when I forced it to use lib64, my configure actually worked:
 ...
 else
   _lib="lib64"
 fi
 
Hope we can find a better way to handle this - any suggestions?  I'm glad to help out testing this.  Let me know if I forgot some vital information.

Take care,
Tyler

On a similar note, now when I request GRASS support --with-grass=/my/path - QGIS configure fails because it looks for /my/path/lib64 - but grass created its folder /my/path/lib :)

I don't know how you handle these things in the make process, but for now I'll just symlink it :)

Thanks all,

Ok, let's give it another try :-) although I don't really understand
why preview compiles and SVN doesn't.

- Can you compare those 2 generated files (*.cc) if there are
differences between preview and svn version?
- If you copy 2 object files in src/core/.libs/ from preview to svn,
does it help?
 (libqgis_core_la-qgssearchstringlexer.o and
libqgis_core_la-qgssearchstringparser.o)

I think we will stay primarily with MinGW, first of all because also
Qt library (GPL) is supported only with MinGW.

Definitely we will create an environment with compiled dependencies,
but you know, it takes some time ;-)

Hi Martin,

and I am a little confused, too :-), because when I tried to isolate the
problem, yesterday after succesfully compiling the preview2 I also compiled svn
revision 5879. I tried this special rev because I need the 2.5D support - and it
also worked without any problems... hhmmm

so I thought there must have been a change between rev5879 and rev5967... 
but this morning I tested the current rev5975 and it also compiled well. This is
strange, because I didn't change anything just used make distclean and svn up
a couple of times :-).

maybe it was the r5967 by tim "sort out yy flax..." and I missed to clean the
sources, yesterday? 

anyway - I'm happy now,

thanks a lot 
 Otto

Glad that's finally working for you :-)

btw. Tim's changes in 5967 are related only to building with qmake and
don't affect building with autotools...

Martin,

Nice job. I started to playing with a python scripting a month ago
(using SIP). I can see that you accomplished quite a bit!

Anyway I can help? I could try to tackel a more advanced python console.
I was thinking of using QScintilla as an editor. Let me know.

Hi Christoph,

sure you can help. Python console can be improved greatly, some things
I have in mind currently:
- ability to load a python script and execute it
- multiple line commands (e.g. cycles)
- support for other commands than evalution (assignment doesn't work now)
- command history
- auto-completion

But I'm not sure if using QScintilla is a good idea - it's yet another
dependency and I guess we can live well without it. Console is meant
to be a simple interface to python, not an interface with editor -
it's easier to use an external editor for editing a script and then
just import it in QGIS.

Or did you mean some other use with QScintilla?

Martin

Martin,

do you want to discuss this on IRQ? I'm currently on the qgis channel.
Otherwise, we can agree on some other time on IRQ (seems to be easier
than email :) ).

Comment (by gsherman):

 There is/was such a utility that converted from !ArcView 3.x to QGIS and
 other formats but for the life of me I can't remeber the name.

 Converting ArcGIS project files would require an !ArcObjects tool since
 the mxd format is binary and can't be parsed.

Yes we can have a discussion, however now I'm leaving for a few days
and will be back next week.

I (with help from others especially what_nick from irc) am doing
exactly this for windows. We will supply win developers with a msys
environment containing all dependencies and headers. Ill put an
announcement to the list but at the moment I only get some of the libs
to compile with qmake since I am struggling a lot with cyclical
dependencies in qmake.

Hi

At the moment I have core, composer, projectionselectorwidget and
almost gui compiling. Im checking the pro files in as I progress so
you are most welcome to send patches...though it may be better to wait
a few days and then help with testing and debuggin once I have the
initial qmake build in place...

Did you get teh msys environment what_nick made? Or what are you using
for the deps?

Regards

Tim

Hello,

I've recently entered the area of GIS and I've been building most of  
my tools through the MacPorts/DarwinPorts system.

I thought I'd contribute a qgis portfile for version 0.7.4 but I'm  
running into a build problem on qgisapp.cpp where I get an "error:  
expected unqualified-id before string constant" error.

I'm building on an intel mac, and I suspect this error may be related  
to a documented issue in the cmath header (specifically a problem  
with the isnan macro).

I'm curious if anyone else has seen this issue and if so, what they  
have done to fix it or workaround.

I'll also look into the libraries provided by macports. For example,  
the qt-aqua bindings are at version 3 for macports, while I see most  
people are using v4 for qgis.

Thanks in advance,
-Mark

Makefile.win does not work on windows?
I believe that compilation with MinGW on Windows should
be almost identical to cross-compilation.

Hi

Im using qmake to build as its much simpler and I actually understand
the qmake system.

see

http://blog.qgis.org/?q=node/30

I resolved the cyclic deps by makeing gui include composer, gui and
raster in one lib. What_nick from irc tried to build under windows
with your Makefile.win setup but ran into problems (cant rememebr what
teh specific issue was).

Regards

Tim

Hi all.
What are the perspective (time and resources necessary) to have fully
functional python bindings? I have a customer who would like to develop
a few plugins, and we're evaluating the advantages and problems of going
down the hard (C++) or the easy (python) way.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

it will take just few evenings for me to wrap remaining classes and
enable support for plugins in python. But the decision between C++ and
Python should also depend on the timeline of your project. Currently
the branch with bindings uses bleeding edge stuff: Qt4.2 together with
SIP and PyQt4 which are not yet released - just snapshots. Moreover
with the many changes that happened in the branch there is some stuff
currently less stable.

To summarize it - the problem is not the status of the bindings since
they can be finished quickly. A bigger problem is stability of API and
stability of application. But, if you don't mind some minor problems
that might occur I would encourage you to start developing with
python.

Yeah, hard decision :-)

Martin

Not sure about PyQt4, but Qt4.2 was release a week or two back. Its  
going to be in Ubuntu Edgy Eft and it probably in debian testing  
already. For winodws I will be packaging woth Qt4.2 libs. Probably  
for Mac the same (Tom? / William?). SO its probably more the 'other'  
distros that will require some contemplation in this regard... Of  
course this is besides the stuff that Martins superduper python stuff  
is not in head yet....

Hi F?lix

Whe you say 'mplement' do you mean in terms of submitting a code  
patch? There are currently only two pseudocolour pallettes available  
in current version of QGIS, though you should be able to add more  
easily if you know a bit of C++. If you need some help let me know.  
If you are thinking about having additional pallettes in a non  
programming way, this is not et supported.

Regards
Tim

You could try Matthew Perry's color-relief tool for GDAL [1] or GRASS's
r.colors [2] and then use QGIS for display. QGIS will display any
format your GDAL instalation supports, including GRASS if GDAL-GRASS
plugin is present (see [3] for help).

It just is not implemented and the implementation should not be difficult:
1) Find neares node: Vect_find_node()
2) Get the lines in the node: Vect_get_node_n_lines(),
     Vect_get_node_line
3) Modify the coordinates and rewrite lines: Vect_rewrite_line()

The only problem I can see is that currently we have only one
dynamic linear rubber band so it would be necessary to
either dynamicly allocate more or to draw dynamicly just one linear
segment (when moving mouse) from the old to the new location.

If you want this feature please fill a new ticket in the bugtracker.

Hi qgis-devs,

Does anyone know which qt version was used to compile the preview2 for 
windows?
I try to compile the code for the university project for windows and getting 
linker errors (most probably due to different qt versions).


thanks,

Hi Gavin, Otto and Tim,

Thanks for your help, I'll try it with 4.1 then.
Tim: what is the status of a native mingw build? Sooner or later I will need 
to debug on windows too so I could install XP on my computer and give it a 
try.

cheers,

Hi Marco

Have a look at my last couple of blog entries. Basically I have core  
and gui building and some providers and plugins. The rest of the  
plugins I hope to complete this week. Then the main task will be  
getting grass support and postgres support completed. I will post  
compete instructions for building and debugging under windows shortly  
so hopefully others can pitch in.

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0610260554u4f7b4db5t1563507674c7edf2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

QGIS code uses a mixture of containers (e.g. map, vector, list, set)
from standard C++ library and Qt. I'd like to hear your opinions about
moving completely to Qt containers (QMap, QVector, ...). Benefit of
this would be a "smoother" and more Qt-ish API, possibility to use
java-style iterators and more.

Overview of the containers:
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/qt4-tulip.html

If noone objects against it, I would change it in the refactoring
branch. This will allow making the python bindings easier.

I'm trying to get qgis to work together with grass and have some
questions.  It seems that to import grass layers into qgis, gdal must
have been compiled with grass support.  However, at the same time, it
seems that grass must be compiled with gdal support.  To me, this
implies a circular dependency.

What am I missing about how to compile grass and gdal so that
everything works both with qgis and with grass alone?

Thanks for your help.

Hi

gdal has a separate module for grass raster support. So I believe the  
process it:

Compile gdal
Compile grass
Compile gdal-grass

I haven't tried it yet, but it should work (right Markus?).

Hi Martin,

I'm more in favour of the STL classes because they are available wherever a 
C++ compiler is. There are parts of QGIS which could be used without qt, e.g. 
the vector data providers and other non-gui classes. I think it would be a 
pitty to create a dependency on qt for those classes.

cheers,
Marco

Hi,

I prefer the STL containers. I find them to have a more consistent
interface than the Qt ones, although with Qt4 most, if not all, of the
containers work with STL algorithms and have STL-like functions.

I think this has changed.

In Qt3 docs they say (http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qt-template-lib.html):
"If a suitable STL implementation is not available on all your target
platforms, the QTL can be used instead."

But on the page about Qt4 containters (called Tulip), they state:
"Qt 4 introduces a new set of containers that supersede both the old
QCollection pointer-based containers and the newer QTL value-based
containers."

For these new containers there's no such note that it's good only for
platforms without STL. I've tried to search for some pages that would
compare Qt4 containers and STL, but with no success.

Hi Marco,

first I have also thought that it would be nice that some core
routines would not depend on Qt. Later I've found out that this is not
possible.

Core parts use like data providers use Qt signals/slots mechanism that
makes impossible to port them easily to a non-Qt code. But second,
more important - why to do that? QGIS is based on Qt. Once we have
such dependency why not to use it extensively? My opinion is that
converting some code to be Qt-independent wouldn't bring any benefits
- Qt also works as compatibility layer between the platforms. Why to
loose it?

This might be a matter of taste. What do you think is more consistent in STL?
When I compare the usage of containers between Qt and STL, Qt ones can
have much nicer syntax.

-- STL --

std::list<int> lst;
...
std::list<int>::iterator it;
for (it = lst.begin(); it != lst.end(); it++)
{
  std:: cout << *it << std::endl;
}

-- Qt --

QList<int> lst;
...
QListIterator<int> it( lst );
while ( it.hasNext() )
{
  std::cout << it.next() << std::endl;
}


But my primary idea is to decide which type of containers to adapt (or
at least which type for public API), because now we use both STL and
Qt containers and this mixture makes the QGIS API quite inconsistent.

Ok, that's right. We probably use QString in all classes.

Hi,

Yea, it's a matter of taste. I like the 'sparseness' and well thought
through nature of STL over the somewhat haphazard nature of the Qt classes
methods, but in the end Qgis uses Qt, with real benefits (i18n with
QString and the file handling classes being two good examples).

It's oh so tempting to get into a discussion over the finer details of
where Qt or STL is better, etc, but as you note that's not really the
point of your original question :)

Hi again,

it seems that there are different opinions on which containers to
prefer, thus I would like to do a poll about this.

Please vote as follows what containers should be used in QGIS code:
+2 ... use only Qt containers
+1 ... use Qt containers for public API, allowing STL containers elsewhere
 0 ... don't know / indifferent
-1 ... use STL containers for public API, allowing Qt containers elsewhere
-2 ... use only STL containers

(as public API I mean classes in core and gui libraries)

>From this poll I hope we will be able to create a coding standard for QGIS.

+1 for me.

Martin

Don't do much coding yet with Qt or QGis, but +1 makes most sense to me.
After all, Qt is one of the major building blocks. So, it makes sense to
take advantage of its built in features.

If I may share my opinion, I agree with Marco's arguments.
Particularly, I can't see real advantages of using QT
than C++ standard containers.

I can see the benefit of having a consistent public API, but don't have a
strong feeling on whether STL or Qt would be best.

I see advantage in having the code more consistend and Qt-ish. Qt
containers also have java-like iterators which are simpler to use.
Besides this, they have generally the same functionality.

It's a bad idea to use post-increment with iterators!

First, in this particular example following should be preferred
for best performance and optimization:

std::list<int>::const_iterator end = lst.end();
for (std::list<int>::const_iterator it = lst.begin(); it != end; ++it)


Finally, what's simpler and less error prone comparing to this?

std::copy(lst.begin(), lst.end(),
          std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, "\n"));

Unfortunately, after I've read Trolltech's doc about their containers, I
have to say there is quite much of FUD.
Second, even they point that Java iterators are expected to be slower:

"They are more convenient to use than the STL-style iterators, at the
price of being slightly less efficient"

For me, the FUD are statements like "more convenient to use".
Why Trolls compare their containers with STL containers only?
It's a wrong approach from the basis.

STL, a part of C++ Standard Library, is *not* only a set of containers!
It's very *incorrect* to talk only about STL containers and how they
are cool or not.
STL is the _whole_system_ of types and operations:
container + iterators + algorithms + allocators.
STL design, concepts, interface and performance should be analyzed
including all these 4 types of STL elements.

Why STL iterators interface is defined as it is?
Because iterators are indirection layer that makes it possible to
operate on containers using common algorithms definition.
The main idea here is to provide deep interface consistency with
very good performance.

Second, using STL you can easily "plug & play" with Boost libraries.
For example, latest TR1 [1] include many of features from Boost,
with new containers like fixed-size array, unordered associative
containers and tuples, and - thanks to STL interface design
principles - coders can just take and use these new elements,
without changing their habits or learning it again.

If Trolls are going to support Java-like and STL-like interface together
with all Java-like utils (algorithms, etc.) and STL-like (explained
above), I only can wish them luck, but IMHO this will make their
containers API bloated, so easily misused.

One controversial question comes to my mind, why not to switch to Java
completely if STL interface is considered as hard and error prone?
I'm sorry, but it's hard to understand for me.

I'd like also to suggest to measure performance of QT and STL containers
with basic algorithms.

What QT is supposed to be used, 4.1 or 4.2?

For example, in QT 4.1 there is no QSet::find algorithm,
so iterator-based searching is
- 16 times slower in searching for present value (100000)
- 56 times slower in searching for not present value in a set (600000)

// myqset contains values from 0 to 399999
int n = 0;
int idle = 100000;
QSet<int>::const_iterator end = myqset.end();
for (QSet<int>::const_iterator it = myqset.begin(); it != end; ++it)
{
   if (idle == *it)
      n = *it;
}

than dedicated find algorithm for tree structures (std::set and
std::map) in STL:

// myset contains values from 0 to 399999
int n = 0;
int idle = 100000;
set<int>::const_iterator pos = myset.find(idle);
if (myset.end() != pos)
   n = *pos;



If QGIS is supposed to work with all QT 4.x versions, then it's
required to use old API, compatible with all versions and it's not
possible to use ie. QSet::find algorithm.
That may increase performance significantly and 4.2 users won't be able
to use new and robust versions because QGIS needs to work with QT 4.1, etc.
Such problems does not exist if STL is used.

I'm just trying to point as much issues as possible, that I believe
should be considered before making decision to move to QT containers
completely.
I think, simple voting is a bad idea :-) because it's about engineering,
so measurements are the only way to select one solution over another.

Martin,
Can you point a platform with C++ compiler that does not support
C++ standard library?

STL *is* a part of C++ standard library and most major C++
compilers that are considered as C++ compliant provide STL elements.
There are some issues for example GCC has known portability problems,
but these are not critical for applications like QGIS.

Here is a list of supported compilers by Boost, a modern C++ library
that also uses C++ Standard Library quite much:

http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html#Tools

I can't see there any compiler missing that's used for QGIS.
I'm inclined to assume there is no compiler which does not
support C++SL/STL and is used by QGIS community.
If one uses a very old compiler that do not support STL
components well (like old VC++ 6.0), there is always STLport
(http://stlport.sourceforge.net)

Because may be potential performance decrease?
If QT containers are so great why I can't find any benchmarks?
OK, there are some on QT lists, but these benchmarks are very poor.

Martin,

Even if Trolls are warning you these iterators are slower than any other
way to access container elements, are you going to use them?
Just because of difference between (*it) and it.next() ?

Second, I've pointed it in my previous point, iterators are not a lonely
feature but they are part of whole system of types and algorithms
that *is supposed* to be used together to provide best performance
and simplified usage.

Honestly, Java-like iterators are not so easy.
What about the side effect in it.next(), is this still clear for you?
This operation results in 2:
- move iterator to next element
- return current element

Here are two examples:

QListIterator<QString> i(list);
while (i.hasNext())
    qDebug() << i.next();

std::list<std::string>::const_iterator it = mylist.begin();
while (it != mylist.end())
     qDebug() << *it++;
-----------------^^^^^^

here you can observe explicitly two these operations which
are hidden in i.next() above.
In C++, concept of iterators is strictly based on concept of pointers,
together with pointers arithmetic and dereferencing:
- increase or decrease pointer
- dereference pointer

Now, Java iterator dereferencing does 2 things together and I strongly
believe that C++ users may have problems with understanding it well.
For example C++ coders may try to do something like this:

int res = 0;
QListIterator<int> i(list);
while (i.hasNext())
{
     res = i.next() / (2 * i.next()) ...
}

where in C++ it's

res = (*i) / (2 * (*i));

without any temp values etc.

Next, construction of Java-like iterators is error prone.
Consider this:

QList<QString> list;

...

// 100 lines of code later
QListIterator<int> i(list);


Where with STL, you *can not* do this bug because well-designed
container API. Container iterator is closely tight with container type,
and this type is not std::list but std::list<T>.
This obvious rule in C++ is broken with QT Java-like iterators.

That's why I call Troll's talk as a FUD in this case.

Dear QGIS Developers

Some of you may have noticed Gary's notice to the user's list  
announcing our sponsorship programme:

http://qgis.org/content/view/131/105/

We would like to hire someone to work on QGIS to help get 0.8 'out  
the door'.  As stated in the announcement here:

http://qgis.org/content/view/132/106/

any current developer with SVN access or that has submitted patches  
to QGIS may apply, including PSC members. In the case that a PSC  
member applies for the work, they will need to recuse themselves from  
the developer selection process. All non-applicant PSC members will  
vote on which developer will win the contract.

The deadline for submissions is Sunday 5 November 2006, 23h59 GMT.

We really look forward to receiving your applications and hope that  
this modest beginning will form the basis of a sustainable way to  
keep momentum and quality in the QGIS project.

Best regards

Tim Sutton (on behalf of the Project Steering Committee)

Hi All

We've made some updates to the web site this weekend:

   - urls are now short search engine friendly format e.g. :  http:// 
qgis.org/content/view/130/
  - menus are now much reduced and hopefully easier to navigate
  - removed other clutter like pdf icons, mail story icons etc

As a by product of this some of the existing content such as flash  
screen movies, user reviews etc is not available from the menus. Is  
this a problem for anyone? Our idea is to move all ethereal user  
content into http://blog.qgis.org and keep the qgis.org content  
limited to official announcements etc. Does this cause a problem for  
anyone? Is there any content that you found useful that is now  
unavailable? It would be good to get  any feedback you may wish to  
offer.

Hi Mateusz,

thanks for your mails. I'll try to address them all here.

To note first, I'm not much an enthusiast of standard C++ library and
I know just a small part of it. Therefore please excuse my claims
about STL if they are wrong :-)

I've found an interesting (and very similar) debate on kdevelop
mailing list where two sides argue about the usage of STL:
http://lists.kde.org/?t=114531790700001&r=1&w=2
(starting at about 5th mail or so)

Another thread (on Qt4-preview-feedback) mailing list there are
reasons of creating / using Qt containers by some Trolltech
developers:

Well, lst.end() is a constant operation, isn't it?

Honestly, what time savings can we get with the optimization shown
above for e.g. one milion items? 1 milisecond - or more?

With time and some programming experience I tend to use these rules:
1. Don't optimize
2. If it's slow, profile it and optimize it at high-level

Sorry but for me this is nearly unreadable without an explanation what
does it do. I know that's just my ignorance of learning the C++
library, but consider that great amount of people don't know from it
much more than just basic usage of iostreams, strings, lists and
vectors.

Yes, I've read that also. It might be interesting to see how much goes
the performance down with them... But IMHO it's quite a problem to do
a good benchmark that would test all important things. Also it may
give different results for different OSes.

Maybe I haven't understood your note, but to which containers other

You're right. But all this great stuff is useless when people don't
tend to use it extensively.

I'm not saying that STL is hard and error prone, I just say that Qt
stuff is simpler and easier to learn and use. And that's just "IMHO",
a matter of taste.

So what's your opinion on how to achieve API consistency?

Qt 4.1 for 0.8 release, Qt 4.2 or higher for next releases (because of
QGraphicsView).
Maybe Qt 4.2 could be set as minimal version also for 0.8 as it fixes
some bugs from the 4.1.x series.

Ok, let's say that in Qt4.1 there's no find() function. But is it
really that necessary? You can always use contains() to see whether
the object is in the set. You just don't get the iterator.

However, do you see any places in QGIS code that would benefit from
using QSet::find() function?

That's right - it's good to hear all pros and cons.

I think it's more about the preferences as both libraries provide set
of classes (templates) good enough to use in QGIS. If Qt containers
were not performing well, why would they use it in whole Qt?

No I can't. But there must have been some compilers with poor C++
standard library, otherwise Trolls wouldn't create own classes. But my
comment was intended to be a comparison between Qt3 and Qt4.

Of course it has no importancy for us as platforms we support all have
at least GCC with its c++ library.

Once more, I trust the guys at Trolltech that they wouldn't ship
poorly performing classes. At least not for Qt4 which had long time to
evolve from earlier versions.

I mention java-style operators as an alternativePersonally, I'm not
much in favour of them, but some people might like them more. Another
alternative is the "foreach" keyword. With STL you don't have such
alternatives, do you?

Yes it's clear to me.

It's all about understanding that java-style iterators work as if they
were always between the values. So if someone doesn't understand well
the principle, he doesn't have to use it.

Are you sure with it? I've made a simple example file:

#include <QString>
#include <QList>

int main()
{
  QList<QString> list;
  list.append("x");
  QListIterator<int> i(list);
  return i.hasNext();
}


When trying to compile it, gcc gives me errors:

x.cpp: In function `int main(int, char**)':
x.cpp:11: error: no matching function for call to
`QListIterator<int>::QListIterator(QList<QString>&)'
/usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qlist.h:637: note: candidates are:
QListIterator<int>::QListIterator(const QListIterator<int>&)
/usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qlist.h:637: note:
QListIterator<T>::QListIterator(const QList<T>&) [with T = int]

So I would say they care about the types in iterators. Or did you mean
something different?


Hopefully I've answered all your questions, it's your turn ;-)

It's not guaranteed by the Standard.

Very significant.
it++ makes a temp copy and next increment.
++it does not make any copy.
This is a principle of STL usage.

Martin, I even have no idea how to address it :-)
The only answer I can form is that if you don't want to learn C++,
why do you use it. It's like "People might not know what Red light on a
crossing does mean." or "Please, don't use pointers because not everyone
knows what dereferencing operator means."

As you know, I'm not a very active developer of QGIS, so I just
wanted to present facts into discussion which I believe are worth to
consider, and to belie wrong statements, but I'd not want to discuss if
people should know feature X of programming language they use or not.

Please, let me finish this thread on my side.

Cheers

+1 For me - we should strive to make our api as consistent with Qt as  
possible - it will make it easy for users with Qt knowledge to get to  
grips with our code base.

What abut deque etc that you currently use for canvas layers?

QStringList myList;
myList << "Hello" << "World";
QString myString = myList.join(" ");

Personally I find the QT containers and iterators very easy and the  
stl ones always requiring me to look in some book / google to remind  
myself how they work.

Hi

My suggestion - for timing critical things, use stl containers inside  
methods, but dont pass them accross the method interface.

For this case QStringList I think is best suited.
In the refactoring branch I've dumped the usage of QgsMapLayerSet and
there's already overriden member QgsMapRender::setLayerSet(QStringList
layers) for convenience (added because I haven't managed yet to
convert between deque and python lists).

These are good improvements to the site, Tim.  Great.  I was just  
looking at the menu last week and thought it was quite long :)   I  
also suggest reducing the number of news items in the centre frame to  
2-3 so items like the newsletter tidbits aren't 4 pages down.  Minor  
issue though.

Glad to see QGIS gets such tender loving care!

William,

I can not agree.
I've been working on PGeo driver for OGR for and it works with unixODBC.
The problem is with mdbtools which behave very instable from
version to version.

For example release newer mdbtools-0.6pre1 doesn't work but older onw
mdbtools-0.5.99.0.6pre1.0.20050409 does.

I've been investigating these issues and found solution, but MDB Tools
project seems to be orphaned because I've not got any response to my
e-mails with my offers with fixes since 5 months.

You can find details in following thread:

http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2006-May/008898.html

and here

http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2006-May/008953.html

Non-ESRI PGeo mdb files can be accessed through OGR ODBC driver.
Here you can also see that it's possible to use OGR ODBC driver on
Windows to connect to MDB file. I don't have any Microsoft Office
installed.

http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=471

This things are supposed to work, so in case you have any problems,
please post them on the gdal-dev list or submit appropriate bug report
http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/

That will help us to keep GDAL reliability.

Cheers

Also OpenOffice can read mdb "files". It can solve the problem in some
situations.
All the best.

It's good to have a consistent API and internally, each developer may use what

The problem is not GDAL+UnixODBC - I realize that GDAL was written  
with that in mind.  The problem is that the only Access ODBC for  
_OSX_ that I was able to find that operated directly on files is made  
for OSX's built-in iODBC.

Nice to know about mdbtools (I might have seen it before but had no  
luck with it, don't remember).

William,

I understand.
I'm not an experienced OSX user. I'm a newbie owner of small powerbook,
so I'll try to test it (GDAL + ODBC/MDB, etc.) when
I have more time during next 2-3 weeks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QT 4.3 vectors rendering benchmarks
Message-ID: <45474DC1.8020701@loskot.net>

Hi,

Here I'm forwarding interesting article [1] from Zack Rusin's blog.
He benchmarked QT 4.3 - highly optimized version of QT for graphics
rendering with other available renderers like Cairo.
Generally, the conclusion is that rendering polygons is going to be
bloody fast, what sounds cool for GIS applications as Quantum GIS is.
Despite of the huge number of comments and long discussion [2] on Zack's
blog, I believe it's interesting for QGIS development.
