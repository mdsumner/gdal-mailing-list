Hi Nicolas, 

Yes, I understand that it will need a relatively powerful server. But it
will be mainly for editing and viewing tasks (all 2d, no 3d) with
normally no complex analysis tasks. 

Most of our Windows clients are virtualized through Citrix anyway - so
there won't be too much difference in this respect, I guess. 

We will test it and see. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, 

Andreas

If you want to run QGIS in a virtual machine (I imagine this is the case), you may be able to do this with small project.  For anything big, I believe the requirements of huge dataset and the computational power needed to processes them will find multiple bottle necks in virtual environments.  For an effective GIS, you need lots of memory, multiple cpu cores, ssd speed data access and direct access to a real, unvirtualised GPU.  If you have all that in the virtual environments, It could probably work.

Hi,

Thanks Nyall for your answer.

I guess I’ll go on with QGIS3.14 then.

Another thing I noticed while testing and that doesn’t seem to work as expected is putting the qgis_global_settings.ini file in « QGIS_installation_path/resources/qgis_global_settings.ini » :

  - (For macOS, it should read « QGIS_installation_path/Resources/qgis_global_settings.ini ») ;
  - It does not work with QGIS 3.10 (but according to https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_configuration.html#deploying-qgis-within-an-organization, it should, starting from QGIS 3.4) ;
  - It does work with QGIS 3.14.

So I think it might be a good idea to either backport the fixes or edit the 3.4 and 3.10 documentation. It could save some people a few hours of hair-pulling :o)

Thanks again,

Hi,
I have a Qt/C++-plugin, formally developed in QGIS 2, now updated to QGIS 3. The plugin is compiled to a DLL file. When I start qgis_ltr_dev.exe  my plugin is loaded and works well. Unfortunately, no other version can load the plugin. I need to get it to work in a "normal" - not developmental version of QGIS.

Any hint where problems could be? My suggestion was that different GDAL version in QGIS-Dev and QGIS might cause a problem.

Thanks in advance for any hint,

Only the API is stable - the ABI is not.  You have to build a version for each
QGIS version (or even each build).

Hi,

 

The triangular mesh of mesh layer is not accessible from the python API, only from the C++ API.

 

So for now, not possible to access directly to the triangular mesh from Python. It is possible to acces ro the native from  the provider, but it will not be in the map coordinates if different from the data : 

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsMeshDataSourceInterface.html#module-QgsMeshDataSourceInterface

Hi devs,

 

I still can not get the triangular mesh from a Mesh Layer using Qgis version 3.14.0-Pi.

The triangularMesh() attribute is present in the API documentation

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsMeshLayer.html#ae5d4ae367cfbd2abf6920d26701f0143. 

But I get an Error:

AttributeError: 'QgsMeshLayer' object has no attribute 'triangularMesh'

 

 

Is it possible to return the triangular mesh? I would like to use the triangular mesh for make an exact profile/cross section from the mesh using a polyline. The others plugins, like Crayfish and Profile tools does this profile using a defined interval offset, so it's accuracy depends on this interval.

 

My code below returns

AttributeError: 'QgsMeshLayer' object has no attribute 'triangularMesh'

:

proj = QgsProject.instance()

mdtLyr = proj.mapLayersByName("RA04_Surface")[0]

mdtLyr.updateTriangularMesh()

triang = mdtLyr.triangularMesh()

 

Best regards,

Hi,

We have developed a QGIS data provider<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/34988> for SAP HANA database.
Our provider passes all python tests locally, but there are multiple failed tests  when the python tests are run in Travis CI.
Unfortunately, we were not able to find the cause of these failures, as they occur sporadically .
The only explanation we have is that the server resources are exhausted and the system might run out of memory.
With HANA plugin enabled, Travis CI installs and runs 3 databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle and HANA.
The clean database installations require a significant amount of memory, namely PostgreSQL ~245 MB, Oracle ~3.7GB, HANA ~2.5GB.
A more detailed information about the server resources can be found in this Travis build<https://travis-ci.org/github/mrylov/QGIS/builds/703846786>, where a memory information is printed  before the database installations and after each test.
As it can be seen from the logs, the memory consumption during the tests starts from 81% and reaches 97% when- the tests start failing.
It is important to note that normally neither HANA nor Oracle tests fail. The tests start failing from Test #600 and higher.
During our experiments, there was also a build<https://travis-ci.org/github/mrylov/QGIS/builds/703276812> the did not have any issues.

We would be very grateful if you could take a look at the issue and assist us in resolving it.

Thank you and kind regards,
Maxim
on behalf of the HANA Spatial Team

Hi Charles,

THANKS! 

See: https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog314/index.html
Note: only english build for now, next full build this evening.

This went very smoothly, only hickups was about some codeblock which ended up in one line.

@All: please have a look and fix stuff (via github/rst) now or let me know.
If there are no objections, I will push the texts to Transifex later, so people can translate.

One other remark: though VERY nice, the animated gifs become bigger and bigger every time:

It's now 67Mb for 3.14 ( which is indeed packed with features :-) )

Oh I found two small little things:

Rendering principle <https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog314/index.html#rendering-principle>
Static dataset <https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog314/index.html#static-dataset>
@Charles can you look at the mesh entry and change the markdown for those so they dont appear as heading 1 and thus category entries in the rendered HTML?

This is one of the longest changelings we every had, and as more people participate by adding screencasts I guess this is going to be a natural side effect….we can think on how to reduce it in future  - maybe generate thumbs always and require a click to see the animated GIF’s

Thanks so much Richard, Charles and all others who contributed to the changelog (and of course the devs who made the actual features :-P and the poor translators who will spend their time translating this).

Regards

Tim

I have changed those tags Tim identified from h2 to h3... apologies for the
miss.

Regarding the misrendering of code blocks, I found that the content site
and the published page have significant differences in the way they handle
the CSS etc so it's hard to know how it'll turn out in the end. I'll chat
to Tim about making some changes and maybe we can make a plan to prevent
these issues cropping up in the future.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Plan for a next Spatialite release ? Should the
	community fork it ?
Message-ID: <1610692.am3vAUgIcu@even-i700>

Hi Sandro,

I hope this emails finds you, and you are doing well. We had a few exchanges in private over 
past months about a next Spatialite release, but I'm still unclear on when a next release will 
materialize, hence this public call, with the Spatialite list, and GDAL and QGIS communities 
CC'ed. The intend of this email is to be constructive hopefully.

Downstream projects of Spatialite will have soon a critical need for a new release of 
Spatialite, as there is no released version of Spatialite that uses the PROJ >= 6 API. Spatialite 
4.3.0a, the latest stable release, dating from almost 5 years now, and uses the deprecated 
proj_api.h.
proj_api.h should normally have been removed in March this year, for PROJ 7.0, as announced 
2.5 years ago, but this was defered, mostly because Spatialite wasn't ready yet. PROJ 8, 
planned for March 2021, will certainly remove proj_api.h, so we will have an issue if no 
Spatialite release has been done in the meantime.

If no new Spatialite release is to happen soon, I can see 2 potential solutions:

a) drop Spatialite support from GDAL and QGIS. That would be a fair amount of work, and a 
functional regression for both projects. Besides support for the Spatialite format itself, both 
GDAL and QGIS benefit from its SQL spatial function to do analysis on GeoPackage files for 
example. There are also hidden dependencies to Spatialite, like the QGIS WFS client using 
Spatialite internally to do local caching of downloaded features.

b) or do a community fork of the current state of the Spatialite fossil repository, which 
implements the needed PROJ >= 6 support. This is certainly not an ideal solution, as that 
could create confusion on users on where the "official" Spatialite is. I would not call this a 
"hostile" fork, but more a "pragmatic" fork... If I were to do it, this would probably be a github 
repo, to make contributions from the community easier. But beyond the question of forking 
or not, I do think using github (or gitlab) for the official project would make it easier to foster 
collaboration.

Can you tell us about your plan and a realistic schedule for a Spatialite (would that be 5.0 or 
6.0 ?) release ? Can the community help somehow ? Is there anything preventing from 
releasing current fossil repo now ? If that may related to new features not yet implemented 
you've in mind and that you would like to land in a release, can't they wait after a release has 
been done with what exists already in Fossil ?

I'd say that if things don't seem to be moving, I'd probably go myself to implement solution b) 
this fall, hopefully with support of others devs reading this email as I'm already more than 
busy on other OSS projects.

Cheers,

Even

I don't know BBB (never used it before) and the instructions are in french.

Because I don't know if the "room" lasts long I will create the room
about half an hour before the meeting and post the link here.

Talk to you later!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Symbology: multiple simple marker symbols are not
 correctly aligned on top of each other
Message-ID: <f8a2a2951e791e686e01559bd0181c4f@carto.net>

Hi, 

Here is something that bothered me already for many years in QGIS and I
think it might be a long standing issue in QGIS symbology: 

When you place two simple markers on top of each other (without any
offset), f.e. two circle symbols on top of each other, they are not
correctly aligned/centered on top of each other: The alignment is a tiny
bit off, but it looks ugly and it annoys me a lot. 

The misalignment is not only in the preview dialogue but also visible in
the map rendering. 

In the symbol preview dialog there is a second annoying thing: strokes
in the preview are often clipped away, as you can see in the dialog
above 

Can we do something about it these two annoying issues? 

Thanks for helping me solve this issue! 

Andreas

The situation of the two concentric simple markers is even a bit
weirder: if you pan/zoom in the map canvas multiple times, the
misalignment changes constantly, the misalignment is off by maybe 1
pixel in random directions. Really strange ... 

It almost looks there is a "precision issue" by 1-2 Pixels ...

Here is another example: 

square on top of a circle - you can clearly see that the rectangle would
have be shifted one pixel to the left and one pixel up to align better:

Message-ID: <CACfnYnRmOQEQbgkL6xptkh6K2UGuda9gV75mEoYqRtPW=sLV=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

we have quite a serious bug in metasearch

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/35560

that has slipped under the radar during the bug fixes efforts.
Basically it is not possible anymore to create WMS/WFS connections
from within the tool once a service has been discovered with a search.

Who is the maintainer of this part of the code?

Cheers!

Hi,

The python cookbook tests are failing. The error is similar to a complaint
I have seen in a facebook forum:

Hi Ian, hi all,

There are people trying to run an OSGeo "Interest group" on
"Terminology", to be transversal to all OSGeo projects.

They created a proof of concept, called "geolexica", available at:

https://osgeo.geolexica.org/concepts/

Sources on: https://github.com/geolexica/osgeo.geolexica.org

It would be awesome if we were able to fill the translation for the
different languages associated with the English concept, right on the
origin.

As far I as know (I'm cc to lexica group), this project needs some
additional "love" to go on.

Maybe Cameron (in cc) or someone else can make an update on the lexicon
activities/plans.

Regards,

Jorge

Hi all,
I've stepped back from most of my OSGeo involvement to create free time to
work on https://thegooddocsproject.dev
(I've also changed employers, my official title is now Technical Writer).

On this front, we've been documenting tech writing patterns and
anti-patterns
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uo3Rcc-rRaN4kmJpqwtUaVRJmDbYI4TkwjuNWNuBu9A/edit#heading=h.cx6ehb42zhw0>,
of which I believe the work that Ron and others have been doing with
GeoLexicon is at the cutting edge. This is a community which I predict will
move forward quickly, once someone steps up and volunteers to coordinate
it. Feel free to speak up if you think that might be you.

Hi Ron,

Thank you for the update.

I've looked in the current https://osgeodev.geolexica.org and on yours
Glossarist desktop tool. Looks like very promising.

OSGeo and QGIS in particular would benefit from such a well defined
glossary.

I'll be watching the project. I'll try to contribute with build
instructions for Linux :-)

Best regards,

Jorge

See:

And:

 https://salsa.debian.org/debian-gis-team/qgis/-/commit/74ca2b0dad13d139ad0d0c245cbb7635411ceeb4

TL;DR qt3extras headers are provided by the system packages again.

Kind Regards,

Ah, Thanks Bas,

Indeed after REMOVING the pointers to the extra headers:

-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/richard/git/qgis/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake -DQT5_3DEXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/richard/git/qgis/external/qt3dextra-headers 

my build is OK again!

Thanks & Regards,

Message-ID: <CAGiKOujfCyTY9tssuFVUPvtQ9PGDeRYfmL32sjoAdGyaPZcTsQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
During the fifth week of the summer of code I made a lot of progress
implementing the 3D scenes export feature. Here is my report for the week:


   -
   - Tasks done:
      - Got exporting the vector layer data working.
      - Saw how the flat terrain is generated and how the level of details
      system works.
      - Exported visible terrain tiles by taking the Qt3DRender::QAttribute
      objects directly and parsing the data.
      - Exported invisible terrain tiles by generating geometries manually.
      - Exported DEM terrain tiles (I had some troubles with non square
      height maps giving me wrong values but I eventually fixed the problem).
      - Discovered smooth edges parameter in the wavefront .obj standard
      and implemented it (I'm following this very useful spec obj-spec
      <http://fegemo.github.io/cefet-cg/attachments/obj-spec.pdf>)
      - Gave the user the ability to choose at which level of details he
      wants to export.
      - Made initial UI and classes for the scene export settings.
      - Switched from the user specifying the level of details to
      specifying the resolution of the terrain (more predictable in terms of
      loading speed and vertex count).
      - Made a separate class named Qgs3DExportObject that will handle the
      object name and various 3D data (to handle absence of texture coordinates
      data in a better way in the future).
      - Gave each object in the scene it's own object name in the .obj file
      so that blender users can edit the scene in a better way.
      - Documented the code and made a draft pull request that you can find
      here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/37588
      - Discussed what I implemented with mentors.
   - Screenshots:
      - DEM terrain inside QGIS: https://imgur.com/aZl0E03
      - Exported DEM terrain (smoothing option to the left):
      https://imgur.com/Jkl9kfu
      - Exported vector layer with a flat terrain: https://imgur.com/LWBtHqf
   - Tasks to be done:
      - Export other types of layers (mesh layers, 3D symbol layers...).
      - Handle exporting of normals.
      - Handle exporting of texture coordinates.
      - Export textures as displayed in the scene to an image file.
      - Manage material file (.mtl) construction.
   - Blocking issues: Not really a blocking issue but I wanted to do export
      scene hierarchy in the .obj file but that didn't seem to work in
blender :(.

Any suggestion or feedback is always welcome.
Best wishes,

Hi

Yes this has bothered me for years too - I always thought it was my fault for not choosing diameter’s that properly ’nest inside each other. e.g. here is my favourite ’Tim Red Dot’ symbol where they aliign nicely:



Inner size 4

Outer size 6

Here is the same symbol:



With Inner 3, outer 6. It looks dodgy in preview (above) but renders ok on the map (below):



Regards

Timi

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS and Qt 6: A proposal
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiHPfz1Lp6n14VwaQVdRucKdaJ6AdrY7CSwNS-iq6Y+4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi lists,

I'd like to raise a proposal which has been percolating away in the
back of my mind for the last month:

Background:
1. Qt 6 is coming, and it's coming relatively soon (before end of year).
2. Qt 5.15 is the final Qt 5 release. It's officially an LTR release,
but in reality -- it's not, due to Qt upstream changes which mean that
as soon as Qt 6.0 is released they will stop providing public updates
to Qt 5.15. At this point (and in the absence of any community fork),
Qt 5 is effectively EOL.
3. We have some big hurdles approaching on which we'll be completely
dependent on upstream Qt. Probably the most important of these being
Apple's move to their own CPU architecture. If we don't move to Qt
6.0, then QGIS is DOA when the new Apple hardware starts selling.
4. Last time we had to tackle this situation (Qt5) we bumped QGIS to a
major release (3.0) and broke API for plugins. This caused a lot of
**COMPLETELY NECESSARY AND 100% JUSTIFIED**  pain for both users and
plugin developers. We should try and avoid repeating this unless we
have absolutely no other choice.
5. We waited far too long to move to Qt 5. (it was around the ~Qt
5.7/5.8 release before we jumped). We risked being kicked out of
debian because of our much delayed transition. We also had a period of
many many years before we could take advantage of upstream Qt
improvements and bug fixes as a result, which has directly lead to a
culture of ignoring Qt upstream in QGIS development and implementing
fixes/improvements as downstream "hacks".
6. The QGIS 2.x -> 3.x transition was extra complicated, in that it
also involved the Python 2->3 transition. Thankfully, there's no sign
of Python 4.0 on the horizon ;)
7. Qt upstream have repeatedly pledged that Qt 5 -> 6 will be a "soft
break", where they are minimising the changes required by applications
to transition. In fact, they've pledged that any code which builds
without deprecation warnings in Qt 5.15 WILL build and run without
issue in Qt 6.

-------
Proposal:
-------

1) Following the release of Qt 6.0, we then require QGIS 3.18 and
above to be usable under both the Qt 5 and Qt 6 versions.
2) We classify this as a "soft break" for plugins -- we do NOT permit
and breakage of the existing QGIS 3.x stable api, so the only work
required for plugins is to ensure that the are not using the API
declared as deprecated in Qt 5.15 and can run correctly under either a
Qt 5 or Qt 6 build of QGIS. Based on what it's required so far to
remove the deprecation warnings from QGIS itself, this should be
minimal work for plugin authors.
3) We make a concentrated effort prior to the release of Qt 6.0 later
this year to clear all the remaining deprecation warnings from QGIS,
so that we're ready to switch as soon as possible
4) We provide a summary guide for plugin authors to advise them of the
steps required to upgrade the deprecated Qt 5 API calls

This proposal should minimize harm to plugin authors, while still
permitting us to stay current with upstream Qt releases. We'll be able
to continue the current focus of upstreaming fixes and features to Qt
itself, and also will be fully prepared to start building QGIS for the
new Apple architecture (as soon as Qt 6.x and all our other
dependancies are available for the Apple CPU, that is!)

Thoughts?

QGIS isn't actually doing anything wrong here -- it's to do with how
Qt is antialiasing the symbol rendering. For some sizes it's able to
snap the rendered shape to nice pixel boundaries, but for other
in-between sizes it isn't, and you get these small shifts. If you use
a hidpi display, or export the map to a vector format like PDF or SVG,
you won't see it anymore. Same if you use the magnifier tool to zoom
into the map.

I'm not sure there's anything we can do here. That said, one
experiment I played with about a year ago was to upgrade the symbol
preview picture to use a QgsMapCanvas widget. The symbol is then
rendered using a geometry of suitable shape, and you can nicely
interact with the preview including being able to zoom in and out of
the preview (which makes it easy to verify that the multiple layers
are indeed correctly centered). It also means that we can synchronize
the scale and center of the symbol preview canvas widget with the main
map canvas' scale and center, so that symbol sizes set to map units
show exactly as they'll appear on the map.

If anyone's interested in playing, heres' the WIP commit:
https://github.com/nyalldawson/QGIS/commit/db8364d989e8092c6db4ebc88deeb62cad4743d1
. There's a good couple of hours left to go to get that over the
finish line though.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS and PROJ Version
Message-ID: <CAA5WJY=ky1Du7rWWrhoeoqqkgkd3OSSHvbQ2VP__cu2zkdKaZw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGIS-Devs,

We have started using versions of QGIS 3.10+ in production and have noticed
that it ships with PROJ 6.3.X on Windows. This version of PROJ
unfortunately has some nasty issues for our organisation which have not
been fixed until PROJ 7.01 and 7.1.0 e.g:

https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/2256 (Wrong axis order of display
for RSRGD2000 / RSPS2000 Antarctic projection)
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/2059 (NZTM Projection showing up as
"Unknown CRS")

Is there a plan to upgrade the Windows version of QGIS to use PROJ 7.1.0
anytime soon? Also, is there any other short term solution for now (e.g
overwrite with newer PROJ 7.1.0 DLL)? I see OSGEO4W does not currently have
7.X versions of PROJ. I would like to avoid custom builds of QGIS, if at
all possible.

Note for our Mac and Ubuntu users this is not an issue as they are running
versions of QGIS 3.10+ which use Proj 4.9.3 or 5.2.0.

Many thanks,
Jeremy

Hi Nyall,

your proposal sounds reasonable to me.

Do we have any information about the Qt6 adoption timeline from
distributions like debian or ubuntu?

 From a plugin developer's viewpoint:

 1. It's basically a good idea to keep supporting libraries (like qt)
    up-to-date version wise. Not bleeding edge..
 2. Pease make it a relatively smooth transition for plugin developers.
    I still got scars on my back from the QGIS 2--> 3 transition
 3. I like the idea, that you can build QGIS with both the QT ver 5.x
    and QT ver 6.x in a (limited) time period. That gives the plugin
    developer some peace of mind, having both the "old" and the "new"
    QGIS as a testing ground before plugin release

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Server visibility and documentation
Message-ID: <CAL5Q671AZhS+zBY66ZX5uWjyDZgxse8dxyLX6QESdNGP_MZqMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

During our recent meeting about QGIS Server it was pointed out that
QGIS Server does not have all the visibility that it deserves.

One of the possible actions is to move the server documentation to its
own independent chapter.

The server documentation is now mainly mainly buried deep under
https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/index.html

A few other resources are in:
the training manual:
https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/training_manual/qgis_server/index.html
and
https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/server.html

I was wondering this activity a could be performed as a part of the
paid/funded activity
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/184

Kind regards

Hi all,

I cannot find related GDAL documentation for the "Custom Options" in the
"Save Vector As.." dialog.

Our documentation points to the main page of gdal.org, if somebody
(Even? :) ) has some hints I'll update the upstream doc with a more
specific link.

Cheers and thanks

Hi Nyall,

Having a clear plan in time for Qt6 is important. Thanks.

Some questions:

  - Is there any plan regarding the todos for QGIS 4?

  - Do we also remove/cleanup our own deprecated methods, and if yes, when?

Thanks

Matthias

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Updates to the way changelog entries are managed
Message-ID: <21F0AE6A-BF1B-4AA9-AC18-E518A21ED966@kartoza.com>

Hi QGIS Devs and PSC

I just wanted to update you on some improvements we are making to the way the changelog is managed. As you know each release it is a bit of a chore getting the changelog into shape and out in a timely fashion. Most of the delays come in the post-editing of content, trying to make the PR text clear and understandable and consistent. Kartoza recently hired Charles (in CC) as a resident GIS geek and I have tasked him to maintain the Changelog as part of his open source contribution. What I have set up is this:


1) I have Charles (GitHub user: zacharlie) to the ‘Community’ GitHub group which has triage rights

2) Tasked Charles to read each PR that has a ‘Feature’ label as it comes in and in the comments section, nudge the author if the description is not clear / well described. Would be grateful if the PR gatekeepers could hold back on merging Feature PR’s that have issues, do not have a Changelog tag applied. Note that the English doesn’t need to be perfect (we are understanding  that English may not be your mother toungue), the important thing is that the functionality is well described - we will tidy up the English in step 6 below.

3) Once the PR description is good, Charles will add the ‘Changelog’ tag to it.

4) Once the PR is merged, we will regularly Harvest the ‘Changelog tagged entries to the Changelog site.

5)  We have added an additional tag on GitHub called ‘ChangelogHarvested’ which will be applied after and entry is harvested, and the Changelog tag then removed (and should bot be readied to avoid duplicates being pulled in).

6) The entry will then be tidied up on the changelog site ready for the release. Additional volunteers (e.g. Toto, Frank) who have helped in the past are warmly invited to help improve the clarity and consistency of the entries on the changelog site.

7) When the release comes near we just need the paid bug fixing entries added (usually managed by Andreas Neumann) and then Richard can pull the changelog to the QGIS web site.


I have started the Changelog for 3.16 here: https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.16/


I hope that works for everyone, and that we get smoother changelog production in the future!

Regards

Tim

Hi Everyone,

As Tim has mentioned I will be maintaining the changelog content going
forward and we have made some modifications to the workflow.

If anybody has any further questions, if you are not entirely sure how
these changes have been implemented or would like me to step through the
process with you, feel free to reach out and I will be happy to assist
wherever I can.

Additional help from volunteers would be appreciated and I would love to
discuss the development of some sort of QA procedure to ensure that we
produce the best quality content possible.

Regards

Hi Matteo,

That is not 1 link because those options depend on the driver used...
(so I think the link should stay the same, but maybe the docs should state that these custom options are very driver specific?)

For example for geojson that would be

https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/geojson.html#vector-geojson

I think?

make perfectly sense. I can add a specific link for a specific provider
as an example so users have a "where to start"

Does this addition make sense?

I like this too, but given many packaging systems and many reasons, I
see "limited" as being like a year and maybe more.  Basically it would
be nice if qgis worked on both until very few people had a reason to use
qt5, and I think that just means  sticking to the non-deprecated API in
5.15.

A really big question is how packaging systems are going to deal with
qt6.  With qt4->qt5, pkgsrc had qt4 and qt5 packages.   qt4 remains,
although less and less uses it.   I am pretty sure some useful code that
uses qt5 is going to take a really long time to build against qt6, and
thus qt5 is likely to remain for several years.  This leads to needing
to have qt6 packages, rather than updating qt5 to "qt5-6.0.0".

I epxect Debian and Fedora are going to add qt6 that can be installed
alongside qt5, rather than just updating the qt5 packages to qt6,
because replacing qt5 with qt6 would lead to removing all qt5-using
packages  that don't have a release that works with qt6.  Certainly I
expect pkgsrc to head that way, and it would be interesting to hear from
Debian, FC, FreeBSD ports, the various mac-oly packaging systems, etc.

Yes, I think so.
We could even try to create the right link? At least for the vector drivers it is often:
https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/<DRIVER>.html
But maybe that is a little too much magic...

Another thought is the spectre of "long term stable" OS releases.

In various projects, I run into people who choose to run old software
(otherwise known as "using a LTS distribution"), but at the same time
insist on compiling the most recent release of X, and they expect X to
build against old things.   I'm not a fan of this, but it seems to be a
signficant part of Linux culture.

So qgis will have to think about how long qgis will build:

  against older qt5 stable branches (5.12?)
  against qt5 5.15

because stopping that will more or less mean people that choose old
software can't easily run recent qgis (unless they use a secondary
packaging system like pkgsrc that builds it all).   I think this is
fine; if you want old, therefore the older qgis is fine.  But many
people want it both ways.

We could also think about a dedicated QGIS Server logo. What do you think?

Hi,

Thanks for the reply. And thanks for confirming that you also noticed 
this issue and have an explanation for what's the cause. Glad that I'm 
not the only one who got annoyed by this ...

In that case - can we do something about the second issue - that larger 
symbols always appears as squares, no matter what shape you choose?

See this screenshot here:

That triangle appears as a square if you enlarge the size of the symbol.

Ideally, QGIS should "auto-scale" symbols down here so that they can be 
represented in that tree widget and still correctly represent the symbol 
shape.

Thanks,

Andreas

Hi all,

I agree the QGIS server deserves its own "document" in QGIS docs.

I Wouldn't mind assisting with that. Always a good opportunity to learn
more about it.

Best regards,

Alexandre

For the macOS side of this, I wonder if things are quite so urgent. I think the first ARM (‘Apple Silicon’) based machines are going to be out this year, but it will be a two years before their product line is fully transitioned. macOS 11, as I understood things, will ship with Rosetta which will do a direct binary translation to ARM byte code, even if the binary does not ship with ARM binaries (e.g. as a Universal Binary). In the last episode of the ubuntu podcast (https://ubuntupodcast.org/2020/07/02/s13e15-vertical-chopsticks/ <https://ubuntupodcast.org/2020/07/02/s13e15-vertical-chopsticks/>) they discussed it a bit - probably worth a listen… I heard that the Rosetta overhead is around 25% on current development environments - probably the overhead will be reduced as the release approaches. Anyway, its good you are planning for the future, but I don’t think that macIS users are going to be left high and dry with upcoming changes…..hope I am note wrong :-)

Hi all,

A dedicated logo and a dedicated landing page would be great (we could
use server.qgis.org for example). Part of QGIS Server "identity" problem
is because people think it as some QGIS additional feature. Not as
something that can be deployed in a headless server, independently of
QGIS. In fact, QGIS and QGIS Server share the same code base, but from a
functional point of view, they are different applications, for different
purposes. As developers, we put all the code in the same repo, but as
marketeers, we should sell two different products :-)

People looking for "map servers" should go there. Developers/sysops
should be able to deploy new QGIS Server instances from there.

Thank you Alexandre for volunteer. Julien, as far as I understood, will
lead this QEP implementation. Thank you both.

Regards,

Jorge

We would leave these until QGIS 4.0, maybe in 2-3 years.

No, this is strictly forbidden, just as it is with any other 3.x release.

Basically **we** don't break any API. We just expose the API breaks
which Qt upstream have made with Qt6, and require plugin/script
authors to handle these.

Actually I'd be perfectly fine if we start adding new features which
rely on functionality added in Qt 6, so long as these are
automatically disabled on the Qt 5 builds. We have precedent for this
in the past -- when QGIS 3D was introduced it was only available if
the Qt library version was sufficiently recent, and also when GeoPDF
export was added we only enabled it for GDAL 3 builds.

I think any kind of hard rule to say "no new functionality in qgis
unless it also works in Qt 5" is a bit dangerous, because it's
encouraging us to do downstream work when we should be working closely
with upstream projects (Qt, GDAL, etc). We've been grossly negligent
about this in the past, and only in recent times are starting to
reverse this mentality. If we delay and stick to Qt 5 for the next 2-3
years then we'll slide right back into ignoring upstream again.

I also struggle with this mentality!

Unless there's a pressing reason to bump the qt dependency for 3.16,
I'd say we leave it unchanged for 3.16. That means we have a Qt 5.9
min requirement for the 5.16 LTR, which is extremely conservative.

>   against qt5 5.15

We would require all future QGIS 3.x versions to build on Qt 5.15 (and
probably earlier releases, say 5.11, unless there's a pressing need to
bump this after 3.16). And we drop this requirement in 2-3 years, when
it's time to start thinking about a new QGIS 4.0 major version where
we are allowed to break QGIS API.

That's fair enough. I still think we should permit Qt 6 builds as soon
as possible, for all the other reasons I listed :)

I'd also like to point out that 25% is quite a drop in performance (I
get pissed off whenever I see my system performance drop a few percent
due to the latest Intel incompetence!!). I can only imagine that our
mac users will be quite...  ummm... "demanding" that we get native
support available for their platform as soon as this hardware retails!

Hi Tim,

Thanks for your hard work here!

> 2) Tasked Charles to read each PR that has a ‘Feature’ label as it comes in and in the comments section, nudge the author if the description is not clear / well described. Would be grateful if the PR gatekeepers could hold back on merging Feature PR’s that have issues, do not have a Changelog tag applied. Note that the English doesn’t need to be perfect (we are understanding  that English may not be your mother toungue), the important thing is that the functionality is well described - we will tidy up the English in step 6 below.
> 3) Once the PR description is good, Charles will add the ‘Changelog’ tag to it.

To clarify -- we DON'T manually add the changelog tag to anything?
Just the feature tag is sufficient?

One potential reservation I have with this process is that it means
that PR descriptions need to be user-focused, rather then developer
focused. I think this is a bit backwards -- for review purposes it's
better to focus the PR comment on the technical details rather than
just using the "glossy overview" that we want for the changelog.

Could we do something fancy like add a section in the PR template for
"changelog entry" and only harvest this part for the changelog?

I think that due to this thing and the various Linux distributions, it's
time to think to provide an official snap/flatpak/appimage qgis package.

Thank you! I've read a note:

"We should also have the desktop UI more easy to configure for "fast mode "
(trust option + estimated metadata + various performance options)"

How can I enable these options now in QGIS Server?

Hi,

they are not server-specific: you enable them in the project
properties->data sources->Trust ...  and "Use estimated metadata" in the
layer data source connection properties for providers that support it.

Correct - Charles will add the tag when we want to ingest it so we will have 3 states basically:

1) Feature tag - not ready for ingestion in Changelog
2) Feature tag + Changelog tag + PR Merged - ready for ingestion
3) Feature tag + ChangelogHarvested tag + PR merged - entry has been ingested

I think it is fine gif it is developer focussed but would be great if there was enough substance that Charles / changlog writers could convert the info there into something user facing - screenshot would also be nice

Yes indeed - if we could mirror the fields for a changelog entry record that would be awesome - we could put the nerdy stuff outside of the user facing part. Can you help with that?

Thanks!

Thanks Charles and Tim,

I this kind of semi-automated process with clear rules is a very good 
balance for increasing changelog quality and decreasing the load on 
developers to write changelog entries last minute.

If we want some tech-fancy stuff in the backend, a github workflow could 
be written that checks for the "Feature" label. If that tag is present 
it will require either a `# Changelog` title or a "No Changelog" label. 
As long as this is missing it will not be possible to merge. Happy to 
lend a hand if you want to follow this road.

Matthias

Hi Nyall -

I totally agree with you on the subject of exposing *new* QT6-only 
functionality in QGIS. Just that the existing *common* features doesn't 
change with different qt versions. And the QT6-only features is marked 
as such in the documentation.

Great - I was thinking we should put the notes from this thread somewhere so that people can discover it…..maybe in the PR template like we have for bug reports?

> If we want some tech-fancy stuff in the backend, a github workflow could be written that checks for the "Feature" label. If that tag is present it will require either a `# Changelog` title or a "No Changelog" label. As long as this is missing it will not be possible to merge. Happy to lend a hand if you want to follow this road.

Yes that would be super if Nyall and friends agree, thanks! It will go a long way to making sure that things dont get merged if they are features and are not clear enough for the changelog writers.

If you or Nyall are up for adding Changelog fields in the PR template for ‘Feature’ designated PR's here are the data items we include for each entry:

Category one of:

3D Features
Analysis Tools
Application and Project Options
Browser
Data Management
Data Providers
Diagrams
Digitising
Documentation
Expressions
Forms and Widgets
General
Labelling
Layer Legend
Map Tools
Mesh
Notable Fixes
Plugins
Print Layouts
Processing
Programmability
QGIS Server
Rendering
Symbology
Temporal
User Interface

Feature Title: (probably same as PR title)

Description: Maybe we can have a section in the PR called "Changelog End User Description:”

Would be grateful if the PR gatekeepers could hold back on merging Feature PR’s that have issues, do not have a Changelog tag applied. Note that the English doesn’t need to be perfect (we are understanding  that English may not be your mother toungue), the important thing is that the functionality is well described - we will tidy up the English in step 6 below.

Hi Lucie, 

Thank you for updating the blog post. 

However, when you do a "plain save" to tiff in QGIS without any creation
options you will get a very suboptimal Geotiff without any compresssion.
An uncompressed Geotiff takes a long time to read and create huge file
sizes. You can see it in your table that the uncompressed geotiff
creates the largest file (no wonder). 

I would recommend the following creation option, assuming that your WMS
contains orthoimage data: 

COMPRESS=JPEG 

JPEG_QUALITY=75 (it is the default, you can either skip this option or
set it to some other quality value) 

TILED=YES

PHOTOMETRIC=YCBCR

I am 99% sure that if you use the above creation options, that the
Geotiff file shows very similar performance (or better) than Geopackage
and the file size would be also reduced drastically.

If your data contains not Orthoimages, but a small number of homogeneous
colors, you should use COMPRESS=DEFLATE or COMPRESS=LZW 

--------- 

So something like:

gdal_translate -of GTIFF -co COMPRESS=JPEG -co JPEG_QUALITY=85 -co
PHOTOMETRIC=YCBCR -co TILED=YES file.xml file.tif

BTW, in QGIS you need to do this (use the "JPEG compression" profile)
and use the green "Plus" to add the options for PHOTOMETRIC and TILED: 

I would appreciate if you could use my recommendation above and compare
the numbers again and inform us about the differences. And then I would
be surprised if Geopackage is still the fastest or GTIFF - and if gpgk,
then it would be interesting to see how much the difference really is? 

Thanks a lot, 

Andreas

I think the first ARM (‘Apple Silicon’) based machines are going to be out this year, but it will be a two years before their product line is fully transitioned. macOS 11, as I understood things, will ship with Rosetta which will do a direct binary translation to ARM byte code, even if the binary does not ship with ARM binaries (e.g. as a Universal Binary). In the last episode of the ubuntu podcast (https://ubuntupodcast.org/2020/07/02/s13e15-vertical-chopsticks/) they discussed it a bit - probably worth a listen… I heard that the Rosetta overhead is around 25% on current development environments - probably the overhead will be reduced as the release approaches. Anyway, its good you are planning for the future, but I don’t think that macIS users are going to be left high and dry with upcoming changes…..hope I am note wrong :-)

Yup, 100% agreed

Yeah I think the final performance hit should be much less given that those numbers are very early development tooling releases. I also predict that  William and Peter will save us from a situation where we have to worry about it :-P Then the other worry will be how big Universal Binaries will be - the macOS DMG is already weighing in at 750mb+ and I hope the UniversalBinary doesn’t push it north of 1gb….

Indeed, marketing it as "one of the QGIS products' could be a good plan.

Now, our website says:
QGIS - The Leading Open Source Desktop GIS

Also, the download buttons at the landing page point to QGIS Desktop only.

Not sure about the need for a new logo though. New logos can take 
forever! :) What about writing "desktop" and "server" next to or below 
the existing logo?
(similar to this:
  https://qgis.org/en/_static/images/trademark.png?t=23feb2018
)

Raymond

That's fine with me from the packager perspective.  I wasn't thinking
about new features that are "#ifdef QT6".  I indeed meant not moving
existing things to require qt6.

Basically packaging systems get forced into choices by various things
and end up not being able to satisfy all of them.  So as long as qgis
still builds with 5.15 and that remains at least a mostly reasonable
choice for a while, that's fine.

I'm also not convinced about the need for a new logo. 

Like Raymond suggested I think we should use the existing logo and add
some text to it. 

But the website, docs, examples, etc. should be improved as envisaged by
the QEPs/Grant proposals. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Dear QGIS users. 

We will be carrying out scheduled maintenance on https://plugins.qgis.org on Friday 10 July starting at around 9 am GMT. We expect the maintenance to be completed within an hour or two. During this time the plugin repository (as accessed from the plugins menu in QGIS) and aforementioned web site may be offline, slow to respond, or sporadically unavailable. 


Thank you for your patience while we carry out this work.

Regards

Tim

Hi again,
on the same server I'm getting frequent:

[Wed Jul 08 10:15:21.847370 2020] [fcgid:warn] [pid 23438] [client
127.0.0.1:37450] mod_fcgid: error reading data, FastCGI server closed
connection
[Wed Jul 08 10:15:21.847989 2020] [core:error] [pid 23438] [client
127.0.0.1:37450] End of script output before headers: qgis_mapserv.fcgi

could this simply due to lack of resources (only 4Gb RAM) or there are
other explanations?
Cheers.

Message-ID: <44f2ab58-1476-1589-0d66-37248af27bdb@gmail.com>

Hi all,

before to file a ticker I'd like to have a small feedback. Maybe I'm
missing something but what is actually the difference between
$currentfeature and @current_feature?

Because I was expecting to use @current_feature together with attribute
like:

attribute(@current_feature, 'my_field')

within the Default Value of a Field in the Attributes Form, but it
didn't work while

attribute($currentfeature, 'my_field')

works nice

If someone has a small explanation I will gladly add it to the documentation

Cheers and thanks for any hint

Matteo

@Regis,

For xdg open and docker, just map your X11 running session inside docker
container and export DISPLAY like this :

-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY

It works with docker mundialis qgis 2. If not sufficient, you could map
xdg-open to container :

-v /usr/bin/xdg-open:/usr/bin/xdg-open:ro


Why is it declared on the server version ?

Hi Matteo, 

The "$" prefix marks a function without arguments, "@" are variables.
Sometimes both variants exist, as you have discovered. Mainly due to
historic reasons and the fact that the "$"-stuff is around for a lont
time already, but the variables where added quite a bit later. 

Are you sure that "@current_feature" really exists? I can't find it in
my expression builder (in layer scope). 

You are probably aware that variables have different scopes (global,
project, layer, layout, etc.) - some variables are only available in
some scopes, because they wouldn't work in other scopes or it wouldn't
make sense there. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Hi,
The @current_feature is, according to the doc[0], available when editing in
attribute table and form contexts which are not actually the one you have,
Matteo.

Thanks Andreas and Harrissou for the clarification.

Actually what is confusing me is that the variable @current_feature is
suggested in bold directly in the Expression Builder within the
Attribute Forms.

I know that variable depends on the scope (e.g. @symbol_color) but I
thought that IF a variable is suggested then it should be available in
that context.

I prepared a super small project

faunalia.eu/~matteo/bug.zip

if you try to add a feature to the point layer you will see that one
filed is working and the other not.

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Also,

Don't forget that high hierarchy/context @variables can be overwritten
variables defined by the user or lower contexts.

You can't do that with a function.

yep, I'm a big fan of overwriting variables in different contexts :)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] db manager SQL console very slow
Message-ID: <CACfnYnRSgko8o9k2q__JPJhVFotmNvA6b1xm2yhnBM-5juyy-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Has anyone noticed how slow the DB Manager SQL console is?

It is not just a matter of slowness when returning (on screen) a lot
of results, it is very slow even when issuing a query like:

SELECT count(*) FROM mytable;

I did a few quick tests and compared to other consoles (i.e. pgadmin,
dbeaver, psql) and it is about 15/20 times slower.

Any idea about the possible cause?

cheers

Message-ID: <CAO9K6eqe+LUJg8YJCXzxn=EL6uMqpoSevQDBriE9TwCGih=K9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm looking for a function to resample a raster from 300m to 1km by
considering the mean value of pixels that are not "No Data", as GDAL Warp
does.
But, in case the majority of values within the 3x3 kernel of the 300m
raster are "No data", "No data" will be assigned to the resampled pixel,
which is not included in the above mentioned GDAL tool.
I tried to explain the request here:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/366978/how-to-resample-a-raster-considering-a-minimum-number-of-valid-pixels].
Apparently, neither QGIS nor Gdal have the possibility to make this control
on the values during the resampling. Do you know if there is an automatic
way to do this?
In order to solve this problem, I have done this script
https://gist.github.com/fgianoli/46a45c5fe042a952580947a282feedc1 to create
a mask to check my results. But I'm experiencing this error at the end of
the process, and I don't understand if my code is wrong or is a qgis
setting:  (I'm running version 3.14 under Win10):

NameError: free variable 'self' referenced before assignment in enclosing
scope
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"C:/OSGEO4~1/apps/qgis/./python/plugins\processing\gui\AlgorithmDialog.py",
line 201, in on_complete
    self.feedback.reportError(
NameError: free variable 'self' referenced before assignment in enclosing
scope



Any suggestions?
Many thanks and kind regards,

Federico

Have you tried the saga -> resampling inside qgis ?

Hi Andrea,

It seems to me that SAGA doesn't have this option to check the values
inside a kernel.
I think the only way to do this is in more steps with an huge amount of
computation time.

Basically, my steps now are:

reclassify the input raster in 1 (where my pixels have a valid value) and 0.
resampling the reclassified raster with my kernel 3x3 using the mode to
obtain a mask
resampling the input raster with my 3x3 kernel using the average
multiply the mask 0-1 with my resampled raster average

I did these steps manually and I got a result, but if I run my script I'm
obtaining the error "NameError: free variable 'self' referenced before
assignment in enclosing scope" and I don't understand why.

Really thanks

Federico

I had run into a similar issue. In my case, adding "LIMIT 500000" to my
query fixed the speed issue (I had fewer than 500k rows). Looked like a bug
in my opinion, but I didn't have time to investigate further (I think it
was a gpkg).

	fills
Message-ID: <381164a5924823a07b92f41a432e893f@carto.net>

Hi, 

Working recently extensively with point and line pattern fills, I
noticed that with each pan, the point and line pattern fills in QGIS
kind of "jump" around relatively to their geometry, as if the offset of
the pattern was kind of "random". 

You can see it in this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4ytwM59_jY 

Is there any setting so I can avoid this behavior? Or could a QGIS dev
with experience in symbology help fix this issue? I would assume if
someone creates tiles from this, they would also run into issues at tile
borders, because of this. 

Thanks if you have any ideas. 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

Try disabling Clip Features to canvas extent on the advanced combobox (next
to symbol levels)

I think it fix what you are seeing.

Hi Alexandre, 

Thank you for this idea. I tried it. It sounded promising, but
unfortunately, it did not help.

There is a checkbox to fix that in Project Properties > General tab >
General Settings section > Avoid artifacts when project is rendered as
map tiles

I think by default the patterns start at [0,0] screen coordinates,
while this checkbox will anchor patterns at some map coordinate,
making the pattern consistent at one map scale. As the checkbox label
says, there is supposedly some performance degradation, but not sure
by how much. Maybe if the impact is low, it would make sense to have
it enabled by default...?

Martin

Hi Martin, 

This is it. It fixes the issue. Thanks for the hint! 

I have no idea about the performance degradation: if we make this
setting the default we could just as well get rid of it this setting, in
my opinion, and always enable this option. Probably not a lot of people
know what this setting means ... 

Thanks a lot - Martin!

Hi Paolo,

see https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2020-July/061707.html

you are probably also building using 

-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/richard/git/qgis/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake -DQT5_3DEXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/richard/git/qgis/external/qt3dextra-headers

which you should not use anymore now

I got this error when trying to build QGIS 3.10.6 against the 5.15
version of the Qt libs/toolchain on Gentoo, and like Debian Sid, it
also has sip version 4.19.23.

Perhaps you have some schemas with many (thousands) tables? I've seen
this slowness when connecting to a database in which one of the
schemas had 40000+ tables, and another database with a partitioned
table with 7000+ partitions. I've also seen the slowness on the object
browser, when first connecting to the database; after QGIS gets its
information, which may take minutes, everything works normally.

Looks like https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/37072 and that should already be
fixed with the merge of https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/37116.

Sure you are on current master?

There's definitely a cost to this setting. But I think it can be
avoided... let me look!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing Raster Calculator in Processing Modeler
Message-ID: <25754d4f-08a8-3a0a-85a9-2bc22f948ac9@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I made a search around issues, old PR and emails, but I didn't find any
discussion about that, if the topic has already been discussed, please
address me to the source :)

Very very simple issue: the expression parameter of the Processing
Raster Calculator cannot be set to a Model Input Parameter, so the
expression within a model is always "hardcoded".

E.g. the GDAL Raster Caculator Formula Parameter is a String and can be
set to a Model Input Parameter.

The syntax of the native Processing Calculator cannot be easy to embed
in a string ("dtm at 1"......), but if I'm not wrong, the Processing Raster
Calculator can be used in "just" a simple way within a model even if it
is super powerful!

Cheers

Matteo

Hi all,

I think that the changes should be considered in the light of another fact:
the updating of the documentation. I don't know where/when to integrate it
but keep in mind that the docs team is also interested in a clear,
detailed, non-developer oriented description generated issue reports.

On a related note, I would like feedback on where we stand with the use of
the "needs documentation" label for new features.
My feeling is that while it gets adopted in earlier stages, it's now almost
unused [0]. It would be interesting to know "why?". I still see a lot of
[feature] tag use in commits which does not provide the potentially fancy
things in the PR. For information, the feature_tracker current system will
be deprecated by github this autumn [1] and in order to keep all our
machinery at a single place, the feature_tracker system won't be updated
(Denis, Richard?) so these tags will not work in a few months.

[0] recent features:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3AFeature+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed
[1]
https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-password-auth/

Regards,
Harrissou

Message-ID: <c0564a17a9bb4a578fafb829d7d188c1@gvc.gu.se>

I am not able to upload a new version of one of my plugins [1364]. There seem to be a new size restriction:

"There were errors reading plugin package (please check also your plugin's metadata).
File is too big. Max size is 1048576 Bytes"


Can you please confirm if this is true or if it just something else since the update on the repo was made?


Furthermore, another one of my plugins [2079] (UMEP for Processing) cannot be found when I search for them on the repo webpage. Where did it go?


best wishes,

Fredrik

Hi Tim, I noticed that the Login page is happily staying in http
(no SSL) rather than redirecting to SSL. I'm not sure if it was
different before, but I'd recommend always redirecting to SSL
before asking for a password.

Thank you for your efforts !

Hi Markus I just got report from 2 colleagues (Mario and David) that they
got unsubscribed:
in the last two days I received two emails from
qgis-developer-bounces at lists.osgeo.org and qgis-user-bounces at lists.osgeo.org
with "You have been unsubscribed from the ... mailing list" subject.

I also dont receive qgiss-developers mails since two weeks or so.

where the scripts you proposed run?

cheers
Marco

Hi Marco,

As a list maintainer I also see these (strange) unsubscriptions.

The scripts were not run in lack of feedback, at least not by me.

Best,
Markus (traveling this week)

Message-ID: <91c1e577-0953-bf44-cb68-0548f16d59e3@gmail.com>

Hi,

I just realized that the processing algo PostGISExecuteSQL.py was 
removed for the 3.14 release. Some time after processing.tools.postgis 
module was removed (as the only module using it was PostGISExecuteSQL, 
but still, it's a public API protected by backwards compatibility right?)

Was that a mistake?

Cheers
Nils

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Old(ish) plugins not using QgsNetworkAccessManager
	crashing regularly
Message-ID: <207df85c-c70a-0844-d87a-8f65563fe5f6@gmail.com>

Hi,

just wanted to know if anyone experiences problems with QMS maps (and 
other plugins using deprecated network access managers, e.g. the new 
MapTiler plugin)?

Whenever I zoom in/out too fast (with mouse wheel) with e.g. CartoDB's 
Positron map or MapTiler's Basic map, QGIS gets stuck in the rendering 
loop and I have to force quit eventually. I skipped a few QGIS versions 
from 3.4 to 3.12 and <= 3.4 I never experienced anything like that.

If it's indeed an issue with network access methods, I wonder if there 
should be a broader notification to all plugin maintainers using 
deprecated ways to make network requests.

Cheers
Nils

The algorithm has been ported to C++, so yes the python version has been
removed.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/analysis/processing/qgsalgorithmexecutepostgisquery.cpp
Even calling it from Python will work using the old previous Python
processing provider because the compatibility is maintained.

Code in plugins (such as Processing or DB Manager) is not considered stable.
You should use the public API, when it's starting with "from qgis." core,
gui, analysis, processing etc
You should use the new database API.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Do you have any QGIS plugin feature requests?
Message-ID: <CABPxTTodwGwVLBph9XdARnJ9hAhR_M=rEH9FMgUkqavDoiviZg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I find that I have extra time on my hands so I would like to know if anyone
has any feature requests for any of my plugins.

Lat Lon Tools
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/latlontools/

Shape Tools
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/shapetools/

KML Tools
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/kmltools/

Lock Zoom to Tile Scale
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/lockzoom/

My criteria for picking up a new effort would be that it benefits a large
number of QGIS users, is somewhat related to my existing plugins, minimal
to moderate development, and sounds like a fun project. I would also
consider something not related to one of the plugins if I think it would be
worthwhile and looks like it would be fun to work on.

Do you have any suggestions or requests?

Thanks,

Calvin

Message-ID: <12436825-9e93-5e6f-77a5-115232823ed7@carto.net>

Hi,

In an animation (QGIS 3.14) - how do I get the current time of an animation?

In https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R0TQlhdc1U&feature=youtu.be at 
minute 6:26, it shows a formula involving the "animation_datetime()" 
function.

But my expression editor complains, that this function is not available.

Thanks for your hints,

Andreas

By "current time of an animation" I mean the current time represented in 
the time slider control as a function or variable.

Thanks,

Still not clear. Do you mean the timer running in the lower right?
If so, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgDg5cRwPRw starting at 54:40
for the formula

I think I found it out.

I have to use

second(@frame_duration) * @frame_number

to get the nr of seconds from the start of the animation.

animation_datetime() seems to be something from the old time manager plugin.

Correct -- the new temporal framework works on the concept of a map
having a time range, not a single time instant.

The equivalent variables are:
- @animation_start_time
- @animation_end_time

Just to add to Etienne's answer: if you don't have the time to port
the plugin to the new database connector API, you can grab a copy of
the old (internal) processing class from the 3.12 source and just add
that file to your plugin. It's totally self-contained:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/release-3_12/python/plugins/processing/tools/postgis.py

Hi Nyall,

hm - but @animation_start_time and @animation_end_time seems not to be 
moving along with the time slider. That remains "static" during the 
animation.

Based on your feedback I was expecting @animation_start_time and 
@animation_end_time to move along with the time slider - this doesn't 
seem the case.

Anyway - with second(@frame_duration) * @frame_number

and this is also a single point in time, relative to the beginning of 
the animation, not a "range" slice.

I get what I want (the current time representation value of the time 
slider). I just thought there might be something "easier".

I might not get the full concept of the new temporal framework - I have 
also to admit, that I didn't really use the TimeManager plugin a lot - 
maybe with this background, things would have been clearer to me.

Thanks,

Andreas

ARgh - sorry, it's @map_start_time and @map_end_time. The @animation
ones refer to the overall animation start and end times.

Hi Nyall,

Thanks for clarifying - I confirm that @map_start_time and @map_end_time 
where the values I was looking for!

I think we need a blog post or general introduction (preferably in the 
QGIS manual) to decribe all the concepts of the temporal framework.

Something for 3.16 documentation ...

Thanks again,

Andreas

While the Lock Zoom plugin is already a help, sometimes I need to
calculate the x and y position of a tile or a row of tiles and see the
tile borders. That is useful for debugging map services with EPSG:3857
I remember an earlier plugin which rendered a grid with tile
coordinates. But I can't find it anymore.

Thank you for the suggestion. One question I have is how would this differ
from the advanced digitizing toolbar. Ideally this would be a core
capability. The one flaw with the Advanced Digitizing Toolbar is that it
cannot do geodesic rotations and movements. It doesn't do well with
rotations when the CRS is 4326. ShapeTools provides some basic geodesic
transformations, but I haven't done any dynamic ones which I would agree
would be very useful. This is a more complex effort, but it fits nicely
with the existing plugin.

Thank you for these suggestions and I think some are workable, but if
anyone else has any ideas please let me know.

Thanks!!!

Yes I think we can make a workflow where it goes from PR -> Changelog -> Docs. I’d like to give Charles a little time to get used to the workflows (we have been documenting it at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Changelog-Workflows <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Changelog-Workflows>) and then we can figure out how to incorporate that additional step.

I still see a lot of [feature] tag use in commits which does not provide the potentially fancy things in the PR. For information, the feature_tracker current system will be deprecated by github this autumn [1] and in order to keep all our machinery at a single place, the feature_tracker system won't be updated (Denis, Richard?) so these tags will not work in a few months.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Python's "optimized mode" and type checks
Message-ID: <129f4ffc-fa22-49ef-3a24-a2022bf949e0@pleiszenburg.de>

Hi all,

have there ever been considerations with respect to QGIS' Python
integration and Python's "optimized" mode [see 1, 2, 3]?

In a nutshell, the only real-world implication of this mode is the fact
the Python begins to ignore "assert" statements completely. They are not
anymore executed. Unfortunately, it has become a bit of a bad practice
to rely on "assert" statements - at least in certain projects (not QGIS).

Would it hurt anyone to run QGIS with Python's interpreter in "optimized
mode" by default? As far as the QGIS code base goes, I did not find
anything critical that could break. However, I am not entirely sure
about plugins and custom proprietary code in the QGIS ecosystem. From
experience, a lot of developers have never heard about this feature, so
it usually causes some surprises when tampered with for the first time.

Why? QGIS's Python code could become statically typed via Typeguard [4].
Typeguard offers full & in-depth type checks at run-time, which is
pretty amazing. The only downside is that it makes Python code run slow
like hell. On the upside, Typeguard deactivates itself if Python is
running in "optimized mode" - then, the execution speed is back to
normal. It could therefore become a debugging feature of QGIS that is by
default deactivated for normal "end users".

Best regards,
Sebastian

Hi Hamilton,
These are default settings for generating/pagination of those pages. You can add a parameter per_page to Change the view. For example use this link for 20 plugins per page.

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/fresh?per_page=20

You can use the same approach for other features e.g. stable, popular, featured and etc.

Hope this helps.

Regards
FS

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] qt and antialiasing - line pattern fills
Message-ID: <ece4e9c86e53e9565c422566b6196823@carto.net>

Hi, 

In our efforts to improve cartographic quality, I'd also like to
discuss, if we could somehow improve the quality of the line-pattern
fills, and/or the antialiasing quality of the qt renderer. A very small
change in angle can change the quality of a line-pattern fill in QGIS
pretty or very ugly. 

Also: even if all buildings in the following rendering have the same
distance between lines, some look much "denser" than others. Have a look
at the attached file where I labeled some line fills as ugly and pretty.


Is there something that QGIS could do to improve the "prettyness" of
line pattern fills, or would this have to change in the qt library? 

Thanks if you have any thoughts on this topic, 

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 3.14.1 and 3.10.8 release postponed?
Message-ID: <1595110834803-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,
has the release of 3.14.1 and 3.10.8 versions been postponed?

I cannot find neither the corresponding tags or releases on GitHub.

Wasn't it expected for July 17th, according to the roadmap, or am I missing
something?

Regards.

Hi all,
Here is my report of this week:


Tasks done:


   - Export rule based renderer entities with different materials for each
   rule.
   - Code refactoring.
   - Export mesh layer position data to .obj file (with no material).
   - Export line geometries.
   - Export billboard entities as point materials.



Screenshots:


   - A model of buildings with different materials generated with rule
   based renderer: mesh lab screenshot <https://imgur.com/uUDCgcg>.



Tasks to be done:


   - Export vector layer textured materials.
   - Review the implementation and merge it if possible.
   - Start working on next features.

Blocking issues:


   - Not really a blocking issue but I noticed that lines and points are
   not displayed correctly in a uniform way by different 3D software, for
   example MeshLab doesn't show lines or points if faces exist within the 3D
   model.

Any suggestion or feedback is always welcome.
Best wishes,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Compiling QGIS with 3D failing
Message-ID: <ecfecf43-61f4-5826-8360-67bbfd96ace3@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I got an error when compiling QGIS with 3D support on Debian SID:

......a bunch of similar lines......

/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/python_module_qgis__3d.dir/3d/sip_3dpart5.cpp.o:

if the 3D support is deactivated then all is working fine.

not sure which commit introduced this problem.

Cheers and thanks

I had a similar issue, what I did:
- Wiped my build folder
- Recompiled using an extra cmake option (as per Martin's suggestion):
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/{path to QGIS
Git repo}/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake/Qt53DExtras
-DQT5_3DEXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR=/{path to QGIS Git
repo}/external/qt3dextra-headers
-DQT5_3DEXTRA_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt53DExtras.so
-DWITH_3D=True -DQt53DExtras_DIR=/{path to QGIS Git
repo}/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake/Qt53DExtras ..

Note the extra option: -DQt53DExtras_DIR=/{path to QGIS Git
repo}/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake/Qt53DExtras which is not in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL.md#3-building-on-gnulinux

Kind regards

Hi devs,

I cannot find a way to get raster pixel size as a variable within a
Processing Model. We have the chance to get the extent by not the
resolution information. Is that right?

Should I open a feature request (if somebody else is interested)?

Hi Luca,

Tim has set a new plugins.qgis.org server for us, now with a newer codebase (done by Alessendro), but the 'feed'-aggregation (Django)-plugin we used in the 'old' (python2) version of the site is not compatible/working with this one. If I am right??

So we either have to use/create something else.
OR we have to remove the 'Latest Blog Posts (planet.qgis.org)' from the website frontpage.

Richard Duivenvoorde

Had some deeper look into it. Apparently the (old) planet is still running on the old server https://plugins.qgis.org/planet/ while the real plugins app has moved to a new machine. So the planet is still there, but the machinery to create the feeds (atom and rss) apparently not?

Um, could I put a vote in to retain the RSS feed on the new server ?

Apparently the (old) planet is still running on the old server https://plugins.qgis.org/planet/ <https://plugins.qgis.org/planet/> while the real plugins app has moved to a new machine.

Thanks Etienne. Seems working now. I was 100% sure that I took Richard's
suggestions in this build :)

Sorry for the delayed reply!

This is a long-standing issue in QGIS' polygon fill support. See
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/16100 (filed 2013). Basically, the
line pattern symbol type uses a trick to speed up the rendering of
features by first making a small tiled raster image of the line
pattern, and then painting the polygons using this raster brush. It's
nice and fast, and works well for canvas/server renders, but is far
from ideal for high quality exports. It's also an issue if you try to
use data defined settings on the line sub symbol -- because the
pattern is generated using the tiled image, you won't see the expected
results if you try to make the appearance of individual lines in the
pattern vary.

For reference, up until 3.14 the point pattern fill had the same
limitation. For 3.14 point pattern fills were improved to now export
the fill as vector markers (the same raster brush approach is still
used for canvas renders, where speed is more important vs quality).

What we need to do is implement a similar fix as was done for the
point pattern fill, and render each individual line in a line pattern
fill as a proper vector line (during layout exports, or when we detect
that the line subsymbol has data defined properties set).  Hopefully
something we can do for 3.16...

Hi Nyall, 

Thanks for your reply. 

Thanks for explaining the issue about the enforced rasterization of the
line pattern fills. Any rough estimate how much the speed penalty would
be when one would implement the line pattern fill purely as vector? 

Also - would it be possible to "enforce" vector only rendering of line
and point pattern fills - not only for export, but also for server or
canvas rendering? As an example, when generating raster tiles, it would
be nice to get a higher quality (even on server output) at the expense
of speed. When a Mapproxy is harvesting tiles from a QGIS server, it
would be nice if there could be a parameter in the GetMap request that
enforces higher quality vector rendering at the expense of a lower
performance. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hard to say upfront -- it's going to depend on the size (pixels) of
the features, and the number of lines in the fill pattern. Gut feeling
is that it's unlikely to be noticeable for individual users, but
costly enough to be an issue for server. Somewhere in the middle
there!

Hm -- maybe we should add a project level setting for "rendering
quality". There's actually quite a few more shortcuts we could
potentially take if someone just cares about fast rendering vs high
quality rendering (e.g. rendering shapeburst fills at a lower
resolution). So potentially we could add a setting "rendering quality"
with options like "Prioritise speed over
quality"/"Balanced"/"Prioritize quality over speed". (I think layout
exports should ALWAYS use the highest quality render though, so they'd
ignore this setting)

I'm also very interested in any information regarding getting GDAL 3.1 into
stable builds and/or what is possibly blocking it.

Made https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/37384 some time ago which is
perhaps not the place to ask/track it.

I’m imagining a checkbox in the status bar here next to the enable / disable render one that toggles ‘draft’ mode versus ‘awesome mode’….I love that QGIS has advanced so far that we are even having this discussion :-)

	feature?
Message-ID: <5eff4ccc-7629-0b5c-b2f4-d4129b0e7d63@rasterra.nl>

Hi list,

I am parsing a larger (about 200k characters) GeoJSON FeatureCollection 
string via QgsJsonUtils.stringToFields().
It contains polygon features, each with many coordinate pairs.
Despite the string being valid GeoJSON, no fields are returned.

However, if I save the string to a .geojson file and open it as vector 
layer, it opens with the attribute fields.

I am working with both QGIS 3.10.8 and 3.14.1 on Ubuntu.
Here is a simplified example of the GeoJSON structure:

{
     "features": [
         {
             "geometry": {
                 "coordinates": [
                     [
                         [
                             0.0,
                             1.0
                         ],
                      .
                      .
                      .
                         [
                             0.0,
                             1.0
                         ]
                     ]
                 ],

             },
             "id": "abcd",
             "type": "Feature",
             "properties": {
                 "attrib_a": "a text",
                 "attrib_b": 1
             }
         }
     ],
"type": "FeatureCollection"
}


I found that if I do either of the below steps before calling 
QgsJsonUtils.stringToFields(), it does return the fields:

  *   significantly reduce the number of coordinate pairs
  *   Change the order of objects so that "type"  is ahead of "geometry"
    in the features.

I looked at the unit tests of QgsJsonUtils but only short geojson 
strings are tested there..

So it looks like large geometry objects in the GeoJSON feature would 
prevent reading its fields... unless "type" is parsed before them?

Is this buggy behavior? Or am I missing something?

Should I open an issue on GitHub?



Best regards,
Aron

Quite possibly you're hitting this recently fixed GDAL bug:
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/2787

Does that sound possible to you?

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_Er0zJahG=y=22d_HWEppyDfKe31nwVSddABEhj6jezAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Sorry for the cross-posting.

Because we only release documentation for the LTR versions (3.10 now) and
testing (which represents master), in the past, we have been adding the
version of QGIS where each function was added. That way, someone looking at
the testing documentation, would know that some functions were only
available, for example, after QGIS 3.12. Once the new Documentation release
for 3.16 is out, all these tags are removed and only used again for 3.18
functions.

Meanwhile, at the QGIS-Documentation, we are now fetching the Expressions
Function list (and its description, arguments and other
information) directly from QGIS Code using a python script, more precisely
from the JSON help files available in this folder:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/resources/function_help/json

Would it be ok for us to add a new key with the "implementation version" in
the JSON files for some of the functions?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Thanks Nyall, I reproduced that GDAL issue.
It seems to be the culprit in my case as well!

Message-ID: <60eb76c1-8e11-2035-ec85-77fe40d3b73c@gmail.com>

Gidday

I am currently experiencing startup crash running Qgis 3.10.8 LTR from 
Debian packages on two of my computers that have Debian 10.4 with the 
KDE desktop environment installed, but it runs fine on one of my 
computers with Debian 10.4 with the LXQAt desktop environment installed.

The issue seems to be occurring in a Qt library.

One of the theories possibly worth exploring is that either the Debian 
LXQt install itself, or a software package installed on the LXQt system 
I have, installs different versions of the Qt libraries than the Debian 
KDE package installs.

Is there some kind of script I could run that would print out a list of 
all the Qgis library dependencies and their version numbers.

This oneliner should help:

 for pkg_version in $(dpkg -l | grep qgis | grep ^ii | awk '{print
$2"="$3}'); do apt-cache show $pkg_version | egrep
"Package|Depends|Recommends" && echo; done

Kind Regards,

Bas

HI Alexandre,

that's a great improvement, thanks!

Having a key to catch the QGIS release related to the expression would
be also super useful. Anybody willingly to help on this?

Cheers and thanks again

Hi,

I think we are talking about the same thing. We want to have a way to
inform the users of QGIS release version where the function was introduced.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Breaking default profile
Message-ID: <49d1086e-0f94-4804-a9b1-7b84ddf6dda1@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

I've had this week 2 times that my profile 'breaks', as in: QGIS (all versions I have master, 314 and 310) crash, I think during startup of the default profile.

The first time the profile was very old and had A LOT of plugins in it.
But the one of this week was rather small with just 3 small plugins.

Starting up another profile then is fine.
Normally I do a lot of switching between profiles, versions and language (switching using "--lang nl" because of my work for a dutch client). But not this week.

I was wondering if other encountered this? If not, forget about it :-)
But if others also have seen this, I think it is good to investigate further.

Regards,
Richard Duivenvoorde

Ok, checking my QGIS3.ini I see that the CityJSON Loader plugin I tested yesterday has some settings with 'PyQt_PyObject' in it...
See below. I think that was the problem

Removing the part below from my QGIS3.ini makes QGIS startup again.

Code for that plugin is here:

https://github.com/cityjson/cityjson-qgis-plugin

The object written to Settings is:

https://github.com/cityjson/cityjson-qgis-plugin/blob/main/core/settings.py#L6-L32

semantic_colors = {
    "RoofSurface": {
        "diffuse": QColor(255, 0, 0),
        "ambient": QColor(255, 0, 0),
        "specular": None
    },
...

So either QGIS or Qt cannot handle nested Qt objects as Settings values?

Besides asking the plugin authors to fix this, is there something QGIS can do?
As I reading settings of a plugin should not be able to crash QGIS I think?

Richard Duivenvoorde

OK I am not sure that is exactly what I want, the output looks like the
package list in the qgis web site where the packages are stored. What I
need is the version of each dependency which is actually on my computer now.

So example
Package: libqgisgrass7-3.10.7
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14), libexpat1 (>= 2.0.1), libgcc1 (>= 1:3.0),
libgdal20 (>= 1.11), libgeos-c1v5 (>= 3.4.2), libproj13 (>= 4.8.0),
libqca-qt5-2 (>= 2.0.2), libqgis-core3.10.7, libqgis-gui3.10.7,
libqgis-native3.10.7, libqscintilla2-qt5-13 (>= 2.8.4), libqt5concurrent5
(>= 5.0.2), libqt5core5a (>= 5.11.0~rc1), libqt5dbus5 (>= 5.0.2),
libqt5gui5 (>= 5.2.0), libqt5keychain1 (>= 0.7.0), libqt5network5 (>=
5.0.2), libqt5positioning5 (>= 5.6.0), libqt5printsupport5 (>= 5.0.2),
libqt5qml5 (>= 5.0.2), libqt5quick5 (>= 5.0.2), libqt5quickwidgets5 (>=
5.3.0), libqt5serialport5 (>= 5.4.1), libqt5sql5 (>= 5.0.2), libqt5svg5 (>=
5.6.0~beta), libqt5webkit5 (>= 5.6.0~rc), libqt5widgets5 (>= 5.2.0~alpha1),
libqt5xml5 (>= 5.0.2), libqwt-qt5-6 (>= 6.1.2), libspatialindex5 (>=
1.8.1), libspatialite7 (>= 2.4.0), libsqlite3-0 (>= 3.5.9), libstdc++6 (>=
5), libzip4 (>= 0.10), ocl-icd-libopencl1 | libopencl1

Tells me what should be in my system but not actually what is in my system.

So you expand the logic to check if any of the listed dependencies are
installed, e.g.:

 for pkg_version in $(dpkg -l | grep qgis | grep ^ii | awk '{print
$2"="$3}'); do apt-cache show $pkg_version | egrep "Depends|Recommends"
| sed 's/^Depends: //; s/^Recommends: //' | perl -e 'my $input="";
while(<>){ $input .= $_; } foreach my $pkgs (split /, /, $input){ $pkgs
=~ s/ \(.*\)//; foreach my $pkg (split / \| /, $pkgs) { $pkg =~
s/:\S+//; system("dpkg -l $pkg"); } }'; done | grep ^ii | awk '{print
$2" "$3}'

Hello,

I have these questions for authentication system in QGIS on Windows 7 
and 10 systems:

1. Where directly is stored the master password ?

2. What is the rule of the QGIS_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE on windows machines 
and how to use it ?

Tks. I am not a perl scripter, normally using Python. dpkg-query 
generating a CSV file fed into a custom script to compare two computers 
version lists is what I'm working on at the moment which is easier for 
me to maintain.

Hi all,
Here is my report of this week:

   - Tasks done:
      - Export vector layer textured materials.
      - Added layer name as a prefix of the .obj file object names.
      - Fixed merge conflict and adjusted the code to use
      QgsAbstractMaterialSettings instead of a class specific to phong material.
      - Created a branch for the skybox rendering.
      - Started working on skybox rendering.
   - Tasks to be done:
      - Finish the skybox rendering feature.
      - Start working on wire frames rendering.
   - Blocking issues: None

Any suggestion or feedback is always welcome.
Best wishes,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] SVG icons in QGIS
Message-ID: <b764ff46-b87a-56e8-09f8-da557eaa3fa5@lightpear.com>

Hi List,

The more I look at the current SVG icons, the more I'm thinking it 
really needs some TLC (Tender Loving Care). As far as I can tell, icons 
are categorised by the directory they're in, so if you want an icon to 
appear in two categories, you put the icon in there twice... and so 
that's just what has happened! I suspect the current set has simply 
accreted over time.

Examples of weirdnesses:
* The "food" and "entertainment" categories are basically identical, but 
have different icons for the same thing.
* There are at least 7 near-identical aeroplane icons(!)
* There's cycle parking and cycle locking, but no cycle? No car (that's 
under "gpsicons") but two taxis? Oh, and 5 (five!) aeroplanes to choose 
from, and multiple types of train. And that's just "transport".
* "Shopping" has a hammer and a pawprint in it... well, I mean, you can 
buy those things sure, but that seems like a rather odd place to put them.
* "landmark" seems to basically be a subset of "religion", with a museum 
and a weird icon for a "school" thrown in for good measure.

I'm sure there are many more.

Given the importance of a good symbol library for cartography, this 
seems like a fairly significant issue, but fortunately it's pretty 
"easy" to fix (compared to writing a data processing algorithm anyway ;-) ).

My thoughts:
* Move the svg's into a single directory. (Though would break any 
current projects symbology using them I guess?)
* Use a metadata file to categorise them, so you get a list of 
categories as now and a single symbol can be in multiple categories.
* Add a search feature so the user can quickly find "museum" without 
having to guess where it has been categorised.
* Clean up the current symbols by removing duplicates.
* Add the font-awesome symbols (per my thread on the User List) to fill 
in the gaps and flesh out the collection. As a bonus, it comes with 
metadata for categories and search terms (YAML files).

* bonus - metadata is internationalised so "museo" (IT), "muzeu" (RO), 
etc would also work for finding that museum.

Thoughts?

Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi Jonathan,

If you'd like to work on it and make it happen, probably the best place
to start is opening an issue in the QGIS Enhancement Proposal:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues

And post the link to the dev list, so that all the ideas will be collected
there and give you a clear path forward.

Kind regards
Saber

Hi Jonathan,

I do not want to sound rude, but I think you really underestimate the possibilities and complexity of the icons and QGIS styling and styling resources in general.

About the 'Resource Sharing Plugin':
- styling (of points) is never only about the little icon. styling and symbols are complex beasts. If you google the plugins QEP, you will see that it (also) started of as a 'simple todo' but ended up in current form
- did you have a look: because there are a LOT of styling resources already: simple ones (like mine with actually only some icons), but others giving you the capabilities to show all dimension labels and arrows of your geometries, and again others very specific for a certain working area: oil&gas icons, Red Cross-map icons etc etc

I'd be OK with cleaning up, but a good thing on the Resource Plugin is that it fetches a (online, be it on github or on you webserver!) set of styling resources: symbols, styles, icons, colors, whatever is possible. Please try Faunalia's 'Distance Measurement Styles'. One click and it will be available for you.

About metadata and searching: cool, would also be nice if that could work for Resources. Isn't there some kind of SVG-standard for this?

About all in one directory: fine, or at least for the ones QGIS gives you upon install (the 'App' folder). But I also like the way the Resource plugin orders them in folders (see screenshot).

But as Saber proposes: please create a QEP so there can be some centralized discussion.

Hi Richard,

Thanks for the clarification. No rudeness parsed. :-) Apologies, I 
should be clearer.

One of QGIS' biggest weaknesses IMHO is usability; a lot of progress has 
been made in this area, but it's an area that still needs work. The SVG 
icons are one such area, and while the Resources Plugin may technically 
provide a potential solution to this problem (i.e. just port over the 
Font-Awesome SVGs into the plugin), it:

a) doesn't solve any of the issues I raised

b) makes some of them worse. Now even more duplicate SVGs! The red cross 
one adds yet another cross for example, on top of the 5 identical ones 
already in the core, (and there's the simple marker too of course..)). 
And that's literally the first random one I picked.

c) introduces new issues. i.e.: unhelpful metadata "This collection 
contains SVGs by GIS LAB" (sorry for picking on you, not the only ones 
;-) ).


 > Please try Faunalia's 'Distance Measurement Styles'. One click and it 
will be available for you.

Impressive. The Resources Plugin seems to me better suited to solving a 
different problem, though if I may provide some feedback: It took me a 
good minute or two to figure out how to access these styles once I'd 
downloaded them. (Found a bug too, but I'll open an issue for that :-) ).


 > But as Saber proposes: please create a QEP so there can be some 
centralized discussion.

Is it the way to go? The blurb for QEPs says: "Generally smaller 
features do not require a QEP unless they can have large knock on 
effect." - looking at them, most of them are large chunks of dev work, 
and the rest are for project admin. Conversely, this is a couple tiny 
dev features (though I am making assumptions about the QGIS dev base... 
;-) ), and a small chunk of admin work.

Further thought (and an issue with QEPs in general): QEPs as Issues 
(which are Pull-based) are not very visible compared to the list (which 
is push-based). As in I'd expect barely anyone outside of project devs 
are likely to ever go trawling through the QEP issue tracker (i.e. I 
never have), whereas everyone on the list will get emails even if the 
chose not to read them.

I mean it's easy enough to do; mostly just copy/past my previous email. 
But I see it reducing the audience for the conversation and not adding 
anything.

Cheers,

Jonathan

See screenshot.

Wanting to show my versions list to somebody, I saw that today (27th of july), I apparently am running a Proj 7.1.0 which is released "in the future": August 1st, 2020 :-)

Where does this come from? Is this QGIS issue? Or an OS (Debian) metadata hickup?

Richard,

As you may know, PROJ is way ahead of its time so it only seem fitting to put
out a release from the future :-)

This is simply a blunder on my part. When updating version numbers and
release date in preparation for 7.1.0 I inadvertently put in the wrong date [0].
Wait a few days and it won't look odd anymore.

For reference: I'm totally in agreement that we need to improve the
DEFAULT set of svg files, and that the resource sharing plugin isn't
the best solution here. It's a great solution for some use cases, but
we need to improve the out-of-the-box experience in this regard and
that means extending the default set.

Yes -- we CAN'T do this. What we've got now has to stay, in its
current structure, and without renaming.

We could potentially add tags to the svg files themselves to add this
information.

Big +1 to this. Especially if we also add search by tag support!

Again, we can't do this without risking breaking people's existing
projects (which is off-limits!)

Sounds good to me! To clarify -- are you volunteering to lead this effort?

Oh, also they'd need to be "parameterised", so that users can set the
fill/stroke color, opacity and stroke width from within QGIS.

OK so comparing dependencies has not found any that appear significant. 
Only differences found were in a couple of OpenJDK packages.

Methodology:

1. Create a list of packages and versions from the entire system using 
dpkg-query:

     dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package}|${Version}\n' >pkglist.txt

2. Compare two package lists using this Python script:

# pkgcheck.py
# compare package lists and version details

# declarations
import argparse

# set up command line argument parser
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='pkgcheck')
parser.add_argument('firstfile')
parser.add_argument('secondfile')

# get arguments
argList = sys.argv[1:]                              # drop the script 
name parameter
args = parser.parse_args(argList)
firstFile = args.firstfile
secondFile = args.secondfile

# read files as CSV
firstCSV = open(firstFile, mode = 'r')
firstPkgs = firstCSV.readlines()
secondCSV = open(secondFile, mode = 'r')
secondPkgs = secondCSV.readlines()
outFile = open('pkgcheck.txt','w+')
# first iteration with each line of firstPkgs look up in secondPkgs and 
compare
print(firstFile + " >< " + secondFile)
for firstPkg in firstPkgs:
     firstLine = firstPkg.split('|')
     firstName = firstLine[0].strip('\n')
     firstVersion = firstLine[1].strip('\n')
     firstFound = False
     for secondPkg in secondPkgs:
         secondLine = secondPkg.split('|')
         secondName = secondLine[0].strip('\n')
         secondVersion = secondLine[1].strip('\n')
         if firstName == secondName:
             firstFound = True
             if firstVersion <> secondVersion:
                 outFile.write("Version Mismatch In Second: " + 
firstFile + ":: " + firstName + "::" + firstVersion + " <> " + 
secondFile + "::" + secondName + "::" + secondVersion + '\n')
     if firstFound == False:
                 outFile.write("Package Missing in Second: " + firstFile 
+ " :: " + firstName + " :: " + firstVersion + "\n")
# second iteration with each line of secondPkgs look up in firstPkgs and 
compare
print(secondFile + " >< " + firstFile)
for secondPkg in secondPkgs:
     secondLine = secondPkg.split('|')
     secondName = secondLine[0].strip('\n')
     secondVersion = secondLine[1].strip('\n')
     secondFound = False
     for firstPkg in firstPkgs:
         firstLine = firstPkg.split('|')
         firstName = firstLine[0].strip('\n')

     if secondFound == False:

The only version mismatches found were

11.0.7+10-3~deb10u1

I've made some quick and dirty scripts in the past to add these tags to 
sets of svg symbols. If needed I can help with it.

Hi all, 

I am only loosely following this discussion. 

But about the internationalization: couldn't we use the same param -
mechanism we already have for fill-color, stroke-color, opacity, etc.
and extend it to the content of <text/> elements? 

That would solve internationalization and would also be usefuly for
dynamic text in icons anyway - there might be some use cases for this
even without internationalization. 

Just an idea,

Hi,
I think we should better follow the standard for internationalizing instead
of progressively making a proprietary format.
See https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/i18n.html

Hi Régis, 

In general - you are right - but the problem with standards it that they
are often ignored. Browser developer companies (like Google) basically
ignore 80% of the W3C standards and just implement what they want. I was
involved with SVG standardization a decade ago  - and I have to say - it
was a big disappointment to see what the big companies did with
standards - even if it were their own employees who worked on the
standards documents. 

The SVG param specification is in "working draft" stage - it is from
W3C, not an invention by QGIS - but in my opinion, it is much easier to
use than the i18n section that you quote. And I don't think it is
implemented in any browser or authoring system (like Inkscape,
Illustrator, etc.) 

See https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGParam/#AdaptTextToUse 

Adapt text in an icon or button is exactly a use case in the SVG param
specification (working draft).

And in the SVG param primer, you can see examples of adjustable text in
<text/> elements (e.g. buttons, icons, etc.): 

https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGParamPrimer/#Examples 

Given that we already have the param mechanism in QGIS, it would fell
natural to extend it to text as well. 

And - if we really want it - I think there is a fair chance to get
Inkscape to implement SVG params as well. They also implemented some SVG
extensions that unfortunately didn't make it into the browser, because
the browser companies blocked them during the standardization process. 

It is one of the advantages of XML (and SVG in that respect), that you
can extend with your own extensions.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Raster layers: average resampling disappeared
Message-ID: <dfcf0ee7e2c276ff6dd3e612bad2fd28@carto.net>

Hi, 

In QGIS master, when symbolizing raster layers, the "average" resampling
method disappeared and is now replaced by nearest, bilinear and cubic
alternatives. 

Anyone knows why "average" disappeared? 

Here a screenshot of 3.10: 

and here from master: 

Could we get the "average" method back for zooming out? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Thanks for sharing this discussion. 

So when you load an old project in QGIS master, the average method would
be replaced with bilinear now? 

Is "bilinear" the closest method to the previous "average"?

This is just a label change. "average" was actually implemented by bilinear.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] "Show selected features" is very slow in recent
	versions
Message-ID: <5fa98860-5b63-067a-f038-73a22ac26d73@gmx.at>

Hi,

There seems to be a performance regression concerning "Show selected
features" in the attribute table of recent QGIS versions. (See also
https://twitter.com/DrChrisGeoSci/status/1288120808951312389)

I've tested this with the Natural Earth dataset ne_10m_populated_places
layer. The expression "NAME" like 'A%' is close to instantaneous but
switching to "Show selected features" takes forever and freezes QGIS
master and 3.14 in a way that looks like it crashed (i.e. "not
responding" on Windows).

In 3.4 "Show selected features" is much faster. There's no freeze.

Is this a known issue or should I open a ticket?

Regards,

Anita

you can chekc all the logic in the documentation:

https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/auth_system/auth_overview.html

or directly reading the code of
QgsAuthManager (https://qgis.org/api/classQgsAuthManager.html)
and
QgsAuthCrypto that is used to manage dehashing  and based on QCA library (
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsAuthCrypto.html)

eventually you can update an old C++ plugin that manage storing master
password in your host OS wallet of Keychain
https://github.com/planetfederal/qgis-master-pass-cxxplugin

you can hire one of old devs of this plugin (mainly Alessandro Pasotti) or
ask for others to update it... was abandoned due to acquisition of the
company behind this code. Fortunately they left the old code public.

Hi all,

one of the more recent updates to QGIS-Django appears to have broken the
`package_name` parameter of `plugins.xml`.

Before, the following query would yield a list of ALL compatible
versions of "someplugin" (and nothing else):

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?package_name=someplugin&qgis=3.14

Instead, I now get the same result as if I was simply querying:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.14

Is this intentional or a bug?

Thanks,
Sebastian

Indeed, the plugin is visible on the list page:
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/author/3Liz/?page=1&&

But we click on the "AtlasPrint", it's a 404:

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] using conda for development
Message-ID: <CAFC3uCgXwCSTMQGZknk07G4QV6nsPv3K+eugPBFYYVHTk5n1qw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Please refer to my issue https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/38017 .

Is it possible for the Python QGIS development community to use conda for
their standard development process?  This would eliminate the dependency
version discrepancies I identified in that issue.

Thank you,
Ari

Well almost - Dimas actually migrated the code for the feed manually
because the upstream project hasnt moved to django 2.

Or please file tickets here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues and
we will fix issues as we get the time to attend to them.

We will shut it down on the old server soon - that
https://plugins.qgis.org/planet/ is redirecting to the new plugins host.

There's a related proposal at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/179 --
probably best to keep the discussion on that page.

Not really about the details of using conda but about the concept:

  conda's documentation says it runs on "Windows, macOS and Linux" but
  qgis also runs on at least NetBSD and almost certainly other BSDs.

  it seems that to build something, including qgis the requirement is
  that the things it depends on are present in some way that is found by
  the build.  People can choose to do that however they want, and it
  seems funny to me to impose a requirement.   If this is really "let's
  publish a conda config file so that people who want to do that can do
  less work", that's of course fine, but if it's more "if you don't have
  conda then you can't build qgis", that's something else.

@Nyall, that proposal appears to be specific to plugins -- not sure if
that's the best place to discuss this issue.
@Greg: I found that many of the exact dependencies were not even available
through the main channels.  So if the QGIS devs compile/build against such
versions, I'm not sure there's an easy way to even specify such a conda
recipe, unless all those dependencies are also made available somehow.  I
didn't expect that those versions would not even be there with the others
for the various libraries.  Could this imply that the library developers
don't want those versions to be used?  Not sure.

As a user and developer, I just want to be sure that if I pull down
conda-forge qgis version X that I will get the same effective distribution
as contained in downloadable installer version X.  Right now, we are
getting a very different set of dependencies.

Thanks,
Ari

One thing to keep in mind is that even the main qgis 
installers/distributions do not have fixed dependency versions. Using 
downloaded macOS QGIS will have different dependencies than Windows and 
so will all the linux/*nix flavors.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] gdal processing gives no output in standalone
	script
Message-ID: <YT1PR01MB316416EE5FDC643EF644DCF2B34E0@YT1PR01MB3164.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi all,

I'm unable to use any GDAL algorithm in a standalone script (QGIS 3.12.1 on Windows 10). All processing.run(native: ) and processing.run(saga: ) algorithms work without any problem, but when using a processing.run(gdal: ) algorithms, I only get an empty result (no error). However, the same processing(gdal: ) algorithm works when I'm using the python console within QGIS.

Thinking that it may be related to environment variables, I used os.environ inside QGIS' python console to see what variables were loaded, then loaded the exact same ones in my standalone script but it didn't work. I asked on StackOverflow but I’m still looking for a solution. I tried on couple QGIS’ version and different computers with always the same result. I suppose I must be missing something in my imports.

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/359589/no-result-with-processing-rungdal-in-standalone-qgis-script

Hi,

I will take this opportunity to give a brief explanation of how conda /
conda-forge works. At least what I was able to understand so far.

Full disclaimer: I know very little about building and maintaining packages
and installers, including the QGIS ones, but I try to trigger the update of
QGIS versions on Conda-forge.

*Conda* - an open source package management system and environment
management system developed mainly by anaconda. It provides tools to build,
install and run packages, and setup environments. One interesting feature
is that, in conda, the same building recipe can be used to build the
packages for Windows, Mac and Linux. Normally, to build a package, you use
prebuild packages of its dependencies which are available in conda online
channels. This doesn't mean that the same versions of the dependencies are
used for all platforms, as some dependency may not be available or doesn't
work for a specific platform.

*Conda-forge* - a community that maintains a big amount of conda recipes
for many open source packages, which are stored in github repositories.
Those are called feedstocks. Among them, there is a qgis-feedstock and also
feedstocks for almost all of its dependencies. Collaboration to keep those
recipes is normally very welcome.

https://conda-forge.org/feedstocks/

https://github.com/conda-forge/qgis-feedstock

All conda-forge recipes (each feedstock github branch) are built
automatically using Azure Pipelines and uploaded to the conda-forge channel
in Anaconda cloud, making it easily deployed for installation. QGIS has a
master (stable) and a LTR branch.

*Anaconda cloud* is a repository of prebuilt packages, which is organized
in channels.  Anyone can have a channel and upload their locally built
packages so that others can use them. If you search for QGIS in Anaconda
cloud you will find several channels with several versions available.

I can only speak for Conda Forge and mainly QGIS feedstock. I normally try
to keep the recipes updated for every single new version of QGIS and QGIS
LTR, but I may forget to do so. Then, sometimes the recipes don't work out
of the box for a certain patch release of QGIS, the conda-forge folks try
to fix them, but meanwhile, a new patch release is out, so we may just
abandon that version recipe and move on. I expect the same may happen with
other packages... There is no intention of excluding versions for any
reason.

Regarding the version of the dependencies. Conda-forge community always
tries to use the most recent version of all dependencies. Sometimes that
doesn't work, and one needs to pin the version of a dependency. Also, my
idea was to keep the LTR main dependencies pinned during all its lifecycle,
to avoid regressions.

*Cool things about QGIS on conda (and conda-forge):*
- One single transparent recipe to build QGIS in all three main platforms;
- As users, to install one or several packages for a certain workflow, you
normally create an environment to isolate the install, which allows having
several versions of the same software in parallel in your machine.
Nevertheless, the packages shared by different environments/QGIS versions
are only downloaded once and don't take more space in the disk. Symbolic
links are used.
- Once set, you can share an environment with others, making it perfect for
collaborative development.
- Updating QGIS is like osfeo4w in all platforms, only the necessary
packages are downloads and install.
- Using Conda-forge infrastructure, you only need to update the recipe, the
build and upload to anaconda cloud are done in azure pipelines
"automagically".
- It's a great way to use QGIS PyQGIS and the command line tools (the
reason why I try to update QGIS versions in conda-forge)

*Caveats of  conda-forge:*
- As QGIS project, we have no direct control over dependencies used on the
master version, as the community has the goal of using the most recent
dependency versions that is possible. The same is not necessarily true for
LTR, where I feel we would be allowed to control and pin the dependencies
- Currently, there are some dependencies missing. For example, QtWebkit,
which limits QGIS functionality, including some nice plugins like
DataPlotly, and resource sharing plugin.

It seems to me that, if the QGIS project wanted to use conda as their main
building/packaging system, we would need to:
- Keep a fork of conda-forge recipes, and upload the result to a dedicated
channel, probably even outside anaconda cloud.
- We could use dependencies available on conda-forge or other channels, but
we would need to be ready to maintain abandoned packages that greatly
impact QGIS, like QtWebkit;
- Recreate the installers (at least Windows and Mac) to use conda tools for
downloading, installing, and updating packages.

Last bit, when I was working for Boundless, Larry Shaffer was trying to do
all this mentioned above, but then the company was bought by Planet... Not
sure what is the status of this work now.

Thanks, Sorry for the long post.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Interpretation of qgisMaximumVersion in
	metadata.txt
Message-ID: <71b277d6-835f-27ff-8f3f-961b60691d6c@pleiszenburg.de>

Hi all,

(hopefully) simple question: Is the version of QGIS indicated by
`qgisMaximumVersion` in plugins' metadata assumed to be compatible? Or
is it (under certain circumstances perhaps) an excluded upper boundary
as in `[qgisMinimumVersion,qgisMaximumVersion)` in mathematical terms?

For further context information, see below.

Best regards,
Sebastian


---

`qgisMaximumVersion` values reported for plugins compatible to QGIS 3.X:

- QGIS 3.0: 3.4.0, 3.6.99, 3.9.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.1: 3.4.0, 3.6.99, 3.9.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.2: 3.4.0, 3.6.99, 3.9.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.3: 3.4.0, 3.6.99, 3.9.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.4: 3.4.0, 3.6.99, 3.9.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.5: 3.6.99, 3.9.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.6: 3.12.0, 3.6.99, 3.9.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.7: 3.12.0, 3.9.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.8: 3.12.0, 3.9.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.9: 3.12.0, 3.9.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.10: 3.12.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.11: 3.12.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.12: 3.12.0, 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.13: 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0
- QGIS 3.14: 3.98.0, 3.99.0, 4.0.0, 9.99.0

"3.99.0" is what QGIS-Django assumes by default (if no value is provided
by a plugin). Applies to about 94% of all contemporary plugins.

Based on QGIS' current implementation, "3.99.*" is assumed to be a
precursor to "4.0.0" at some point in distant future, i.e. not part of
the "3.X" branch. QGIS itself actually translates "3.99.*" to "4.0.0"
internally.

6 plugins set the value to "4.0.0" directly (1%).

"3.98.0" appears to be a value for indicating that the plugin is only
compatible with QGIS 3.X (and not 4.0 or any of its precursors). It is
used by exactly 31 plugins (4%).

The "WKTBulkLoader" plugin assumes to be compatible almost indefinitely
by setting the value to "9.99.0" :)

The "anomalies" from the above are:

- tiles_xyz==0.8.1 -> QGIS 3.6.99
- geopec==1.0 -> QGIS 3.9.0
- shoguneditor==0.2 -> QGIS 3.4.0
- qgisnetworklogger==0.3.0 -> QGIS 3.12.0

Values like "3.12.0" as found in qgisnetworklogger==0.3.0 for instance
appear to indicate that it is an included upper boundary.

On the other hand side, values like "3.99.0" or "4.0.0" indicate that
the value is interpreted as an excluded upper boundary. It's much more
unlikely that current plugins will actually run with QGIS 4.0 (but not
with 4.2).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] qt and antialiasing - line pattern fills
Message-ID: <ec56fe711c72554a36ea7728d8ab4c97@carto.net>

Hi, 

In our efforts to improve cartographic quality, I'd also like to
discuss, if we could somehow improve the quality of the line-pattern
fills, and/or the antialiasing quality of the qt renderer. 

A very small change in angle can change the quality of a line-pattern
fill in QGIS pretty or very ugly. 

Also: even if all buildings in the following rendering have the same
distance between lines, some look much "denser" than others. 

Have a look here: 

Is there something that QGIS could do to improve the "prettyness" of
line pattern fills, or would this have to change in the qt library? 

Thanks if you have any thoughts on this topic, 

Andreas
