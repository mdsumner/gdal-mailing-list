Hi Calvin,

In case you missed, it has already been asked here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/43531

For now you can use the H3 Toolkit plugin for generic H3 grid creation.

BR,
Aron

Everything in core has to be built by every qgis package, and becomes a
required dependency, so "it would be useful" is not really the right
test.  It's more "It is so useful to many, on balance, that the overall
benefit outweighs the increase in size, compilation time, build
complexity, and dependency footprint".

I don't really have an opinion on the specifics of this.  It might help
to explain licensing, what the library depends on, build-time and
run-time requirements (anything not already required by qgis), whether
the library has a sane build system, etc.

Aron,

Thanks for that link. I added a comment to it. I have also implemented H3
in the Density Analysis plugin. A grid of polygons is used to do a
histogram count of data within the area. To do this in QGIS with its core
algorithms you create a grid (hexagon) over the extent of some point data,
followed by counting the points in the polygons. With H3 you create the
geohash of each point and keep a dictionary of the counts then you generate
the polygons with their scores. This is orders of magnitude faster
especially as your data gets dense and you are looking and millions of
points. This shows processing times using the QGIS count points in polygons
of some sample data, geohash algorithm which I have also implemented, and
H3. Geohash is quick but H3 is quicker and I like the hexagon grid rather
than the geohash rectangular grid.

Algorithm                     4km grid      1.22 km grid
----------------------------  ------------  -------------
QGIS count points in polygon  8.16 seconds  63.18 seconds
Geohash                       4.89 seconds  5.6 seconds
H3 geohash                    3.56 seconds  3.79 seconds

Here is the Density Analysis plugin.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Error building QGIS under Windows 10
Message-ID: <004001d8be1f$ff9a8550$fecf8ff0$@shaeffer.co>

I've recently been on a journey to build QGIS using Visual Studio 2022 and
have been successful so far, updating msvc_env.bat, configonly.bat and
package-nightly.cmd and getting a qgis.sln file to work with. When building
the ALL_BUILD project, I received only one failed project.

 

Here is the failed project in question:

 

------ Build started: Project: synccrsdb, Configuration: RelWithDebInfo x64
------

Running crssync

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v170\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(

I'm not sure why the project is failing and could use some insight into what
the cause might be. Thanks.

Hi Raymond,

(I've been bitten by this one too)

g++ etc is actually in the 'build-essential' package, and named here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/release-3_22/INSTALL.md#310-building-debian-packages

So, it IS there, but not part of the big line(s) with dependencies per distro...

If on all Ubuntu releases it is named like that, you could add 'build-essential' to the distro-lines?

Others?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Work on QgsAbstractDatabaseProviderConnection for
 MS SQL Server
Message-ID: <2e1f1a3b-294d-a9e0-c5b6-1e144b37c814@gmail.com>

Hi List -

I am working on a plugin that's is using for connections 
(QgsAbstractDatabaseProviderConnection) to several types of databases, 
including Postgres, GeoPackage and MS SQLServer.

I was hoping to use the method "createSqlVectorLayer 
<https://api.qgis.org/api/classQgsAbstractDatabaseProviderConnection.html#a2c6e55db0df105012f0936c84df0b14d>" 
for converting some fairly complex SQL queries into QGIS vector layers. 
This works super nice for Postgres and GeoPackage. However the current 
version (QGIS 3.26) doesn't support this method for MS SQLServer. As 
illustrated in this piece of code:

conns = 
QgsProviderRegistry.instance().providerMetadata('mssql').connections(False)
conn = conns['geodata @ localhost'] # SQL server connection
capabilities = conn.capabilities()
print(bool(capabilities & QgsAbstractDatabaseProviderConnection.SqlLayers))

The last statement shows "False" for MS SqlServer connections, 
indicating the missing functionality. (QGIS ver. 3.26 or older)


My first question is: Has there been done any work on this for MS SQL 
Server connections in QGIS master (next version) ?

The second question: Is it possible for someone in the group of Core 
developers to provide me with a ballpark figure for implementing the 
missing functionality for the mssql driver ??

To be specific: get method "createSqlVectorLayer 
<https://api.qgis.org/api/classQgsAbstractDatabaseProviderConnection.html#a2c6e55db0df105012f0936c84df0b14d>" 
to work for MS SQL Server connections.

If somebody steps up to the challenge I will send the information to my 
customers so they can consider making QGIS better instead of paying me 
for an ugly workaround.


Med venlig hilsen / Kind regards

Bo Victor Thomsen

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Model for Temporal Measurement (vector) Datasets ?
Message-ID: <830c8937-7ae4-49fb-fb34-612b6149a55d@duif.net>

Hi All,

Anybody is aware of a model in which data owns a location, but THAT location has a (growing) set of [timestamp, value] observation data to it....

In GIS/QGIS everything is tabular (talking about vector here, I know meshes can have more shapes).

But in the IOT world the 'location' is 'just an attribute', and the 'other' data is actually more of interest (and growing in time).

Currently to view measurements, 'we' often replicate the location for every value/measurement: we create a 'Feature' for every time step (eg for example via a WFS)

The OGC has a SensorThingsApi (STA) standard, in which for given location you can request all values/observations (of filter a certain sensortype/parameter). So one geometry has a full table of data to it.

BUT to 'work' with that data in QGIS, you always have to 'flatten' it, one way or another, (I think), for every time step: create a feature with: location, time, value...

My Question:

- isn't there some model (or can we come up with one) in which a location can actually have a range of time/value data (like some table join like), and when you use the Temporal Controller, you style your layer by RE-using the one location, but getting the value for current Timestamp (in the TimeController). Some sort of indirect filtering....?

- or is this the mesh model (I know netcdf's in which you have often predefined meshes/location and the data/time vector is growing)?
And would a solution be to have some kind of in memory vector -> mesh loader or so???

I hope this makes sense to others. Any input appreciated.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS, if you want to play with SensorThingsApi:
- install: https://github.com/AirBreak-UIA/SensorThingsAPI_QGIS-plugin
- connect it to: https://airquality-frost.k8s.ilt-dmz.iosb.fraunhofer.de/v1.1/Locations
(around 5000 location and 500-million 'observations')
- load all locations in one layer, and click on a location
My point: the data is then viewable/selectable by table and graph, but NOT loadable in a sense way (yet) in QGIS...

Hi i-s-o,
qgis-dev has been updated (293-fc1b1cac1c-1 2022-Sep-02 17:09) just few 
hours ago.

Hi Richard

Don?t people normally use things like https://www.timescale.com/

For this? In any case some of our clients that are doing things like vehicle tracking are?

Yes to *store* it, but my point is: given 2 points with 100 timesteps, QGIS will create 200 features for it to be able to display it...
So to 'view' that data in (Q)GIS, you have to flatten it to a 'table' with 200 features...

While the actual interesting part is the value and the time, NOT those 2 xy fields... (the case of moving vehicles is slightly different, there the xy values also change)...
Maybe I'm in the wrong crowd here to tell the geoms are not so much of interest in my case ;-)

I'm looking for a way/model (non tabular) that QGIS creates 2 geometries/features, and then will style/paint it based on the timestamps and values

The use case here: having 5000 sensors in Europe, having 500.000.000 measurements in total, I don not want to create 500.000.000 features.

I'd preferred to create those 5000 features, and then get the geom-id/value/timestamp for a given filter range and repaint my canvas.

Something like 'dynamic' joins: the geometries will stay the same, but the 'joined' columns/table will change based on the 'temporal filter' requested.

Sorry if I can not make myself more clear (or making it more complex that it maybe is...) :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

It seems to me this should be possible using:

1. Two tables:
- Points
- Measurements (Timestamp, Measured attribute)

2.  A view (Points LEFT JOIN Measurements)

Timescale as proposed by Tim can be added to the mix to optimize things if
you have additional requirements for time-specific aggregates or optimized
storage.

What would be the actual result in your case (eg in the case of 2 points with 100 measurements each)?

That would be 2 records/features isn't it? With..., I dont know, the last join?
OR 200 records (which is the actual way QGIS/GIS is handling this?

Note that I'm not talking about storage here.
I'm looking in a way, the temporal controller (or something else) can (separately from the geometries) request the timestamp/value data.
For example: FIRST requests all Locations of Sensors,
Then (based on the status of some (temporal) controller) request a subset of the values/timestamps.

I'm looking into this, because I'm searching for a way to handle massive datasets, in which it is such overkill to again and again sent over the geometries (be it points or polygons)...
Or another use case: I want points on the map, and timestamps/values flying in realtime as they are measured...
Or: you have a giant km grid covering the whole of europe, and data (per hour) for 7 days of data, and you can request (remotely!) the value for every grid cell per 10 minutes (without having to request the geometry every time...)

Regards & all thanks for the input,

Regards,

Richard

MobilityDB has temporal temporal bools, ints, floats, texts, and
geometries: https://docs.mobilitydb.com/MobilityDB/develop/ch03.html

So that would cover the storage question but the visualization issue
remains until we implement support for these types in Temporal Controller.

Hi Richard

Thanks for clarifying your ideas. Could we not implement something similar
to how WMS-T works in that we have a PostgreSQL-T provider extension for
example that passes a time filter to the underlying data base request. In
another system we are build for a client we have some logic to fetch
min/max/mean/sum/etc from a time slice so we could have something similar
such that each point has only one value for the current time slice.

Not sure if I make myself clear or not...


Regards

Tim

Hi

IIRC, Richard's explanation as to why we turned off the CDN is that it was
trying to grab all the download archives each time it did a cache request
and it was blowing our server out of the water. So the plan is to split the
latest downloads and the archives to separate hosts / domains / sites such
that the CDN conly caches the latest builds....

Regards

Tim

Hi

I am attempting to build QGIS for windows and have been using a QtCreator 64 bit compiler.

Section 4.1.2 Other tool?. of
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL.md  

Has a link to 64 bit OSGeo4w, but it returns a 404 Not found.

I note on https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ the OSGeo4W network installer, does not specify if it is 32 or 64 bit?

Are the packages I have downloaded using the OSGeo4W network installer 32 bit, and therefore I will need to compile QGIS as 32 bit?

Thanks for your help.

Paul

Hi Paul,

For what I know we only do 64 bit nowadays.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problem with LIKE/ILIKE expressions and line breaks
Message-ID: <CAEs0QJbbNCW8RZeRmqCcG7M7jabH3aJRVJ6TG25vwia5LJtyhg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have some problems with the expression editor for styling and other
expressions.
I found a related issue to this problem on github:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/47957

A simple LIKE/ILIKE expression with line break values no more works in
3.22.5/3.22.10 LTR and 3.26.2.

In QGIS Version 3.16.5 it worked fine.

'Herbert\nCarl' ILIKE '%carl%' returns 0, not 1.

A temporary workaround for me is using "replace" + LIKE  or "regexp_match"
without LIKE.

Is the issue known?

Kind regards,
Felix

Hi!

I didn't receive much input in this table, so I will go ahead and create a
few feature requests as Nyall asked for those functionalities not yet
covered by a viable workaround.
I will be up to the project to decide which are crucial, nice to have or
simply won't fix/implement.

Hi!

I added recently one comment in your table regarding TopoViewer because I met
somebody at Foss4G who was using it. From what I understand, it
generates several vector layers to visualise topology when extension is
enabled in PostgreSQL.

I don't know if it is widely used, if the feature is stable/maintained
or if there is other QGIS plugin able to provide such visalization.

Regards,
Julien

IMNSHO not. I believe it is the only way to visualize topogeoms from 
PostGIS.

Hi Felix,
I can confim the issue is a regression, as the expression works 
correctly with QGIS 3.20.3 and previous versions, while it doesn't since 
QGIS 3.22.0.
It seems to me this issue is a side effect of the "migration" from 
QRegExp to QRegularExpression.

I've submitted the PR https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/50124 which 
fixes this issue, according to my tests.

Regards.

Hi

Can anyone please create a github project for dbmanager migration? I don't
have enough permissions for it.

I had never heard of 'projects'... but Alexandre helpt me to create:

https://github.com/orgs/qgis/projects/1

Please let me know if it works...

I used it everytime I'm dealing with topologies, which is daily, on
work days.

It's stable and it's maintained (by me). No other QGIS plugins that I
know of do this. It would be nice to get the code ported to the
browser so to show a tree node containing all the topologies defined in
a database and load that layer tree upon double-clicking on them.

Just a clarification: the DBManager TopoViewer does not visualize
"TopoGeometry" objects (which is what I usually refer to by
"topogeoms") but simple features being the primitives of topologies.

Visualizing TopoGeometry objects (topology layers) is supported by core
QGIS (PostgreSQL provider) since version 2.0.0 (2012)

Hi,

In the end, Richard ended up closing the project. But I was able to create
a new one. Can someone with QGIS organization owner privileges please make
it public?

This decision makes sense to me, but I still miss an SQL interface ? I mean
an SQL-oriented interface for data as GDAL does even for unnecessary cases.
QGIS has a python-first approach but I don't think this should be the only
or the mandatory way to approach GIS data.

 DBeaver is a great tool if you have to move data from one DBMS to another
and has even a simple geometry viewer, but what I think QGIS should provide
is a data-oriented interface, something that could mix procedural tools
that work on the client with dbms resident functions. In reality, if you
deal with data and resort to views based on native Postgis functions, it's
much better to have a good SQL interface in QGIS than simply visualising
geometries in DBeaver. Let alone, as Paolo Cavallini says, using topology.
Nothing against the idea of a better integration that implies an optional
role of the plug-in, but the outcome is an implicit choice for a
traditional client-server approach vs a well-balanced orientation we
enjoyed. I would appreciate a move in the opposite direction, but it's only
a personal preference.

It's probably out of the scope of this migration, but following your idea,
I wonder if the python console/editor and underlying code could be used
also to run SQL?

I don't think so. I think the python console has its specific function by
now. I think an SQL interface should provide different functions and
integrations, maybe based on GDAL that seems less and less important and
may play a stronger role as Spatialite.
At the same time, I understand that having two consoles may be confusing
for some of us.
Maybe it's just a boomers' approach, I would love even getting a bash
interface, a lua and a node one because they serve different approaches...
;.)

Hi !

I'm working on a Merge Request ( https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/50167 
) and when I run the tests locally, some tests failed. It seems not to 
be linked with my modifications : when I run the tests without my 
changes the same tests failed too.

I run the tests using the command `make test' or `make check`in my 
build-master directory.

In my ccmake config, I have :

```

ENABLE_TESTS???????????????????? ON

```

and also

```

 ?ENABLE_COVERAGE????????????????? OFF
 ?ENABLE_HANATEST????????????????? OFF
 ?ENABLE_LOCAL_BUILD_SHORTCUTS???? OFF
 ?ENABLE_MODELTEST???????????????? OFF
 ?ENABLE_MSSQLTEST???????????????? OFF
 ?ENABLE_MSSQLTEST_CPP???????????? OFF
 ?ENABLE_ORACLETEST??????????????? OFF
 ?ENABLE_PGTEST??????????????????? OFF

ENABLE_SAGA_TESTS????????? OFF

```

The tests that failed are :

2 - checkGitStatus (Failed)
24 - ProcessingOtbAlgorithmsTest (Failed)
46 - test_core_compositionconverter (Failed)
99 - test_core_layoutmanualtable (Failed)
107 - test_core_layoutpicture (Failed)

What should I do for not having tests that failed ?
Also is it possible to run a single test ?
Thanks a lot for your time & held.

Hi,

Same ? issue ? here where I have a lot of failed test locally.
Mostly visual render that slightly differs from expected image.
Linux Mint Vanessa (Ubuntu 22.04)
4K TV screen

A lot of timeout too or aborted child

I believe this is normal. If you want to run tests locally you should use
the docker toolchain like the GitHub action uses (or set up similar actions
in your fork). See:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.github/workflows/run-tests.yml

Tim

Hi Martin,

Thanks for sharing this initial version - it's great to see some of the 
possibility.

Is this something you would like to / be able to develop? I'd be 
interested in exploring the possibility of developing this, and am happy 
to put some money in towards this if you (or anyone else) is interested.

Please do let me know your thoughts.

Best wishes,
Nick.

Hi,

There is also a recent script file that will help you run the tests in
Docker just like on CI:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.ci/run_tests.sh

Regards,
Julien

To run a specific test, have a look to the README.md
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/README.md#running-the-tests
"-R"

For quite a few files, you will find the helper
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/test_qgspallabeling_server.py#L4

Same, quite a few tests would fail locally, as said by others.

I would be definitely interested in developing this further - there's so
much potential to unlock by having QGIS running in web browsers :-)

I am happy to have a chat to discuss possible next steps...

Thanks all for your help,

I'll take time to integrate all the information you gave.

By the way, I also found this following folder 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/.docker which also help to run 
tests using docker.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] ForceSuppressFormPopup on QgsRelationEditorWidget
Message-ID: <72da06e0-b236-1846-f69c-e933aa0eedd7@gbd-consult.de>

Hi,

I'm working on a form (created in Qt Designer) that is using multiple 
instances of QgsRelationEditorWidget set to Attribute Table mode. I want 
to be able to quickly add entries in the table and therefore hide the 
form of the relation when I add features. Setting the form of the 
relation to not show (in the layer properties) is not an option because 
I need the form to show up in every other context.

When using the Drag and Drop form creation I'm able to set the "Force 
hide Form on add feature" Option on the Relation. This is exactly what I 
need but I want to provide a .ui file for the form.

Using the .ui file I do not have that option. I tried setting the Option 
through a python script (see below).

But the form still shows up even though the option is set to True.


def disablePopup(dialog, layer, feature):
 ??? for w in dialog.findChildren(QgsRelationEditorWidget):
 ??????? w.setForceSuppressFormPopup(True)


Does anybody have a solution for this kind of problem? Or insights in 
why it doesn't behave the expected way?

Using QGIS 3.26 btw.


Regards,

Tristan Kessler

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Fwd: Jenks Raster Styling?
In-Reply-To: <CABPxTTqp6d1maY-XMF3Ebzra2fC3KVq177QkbOJCsUmo7O_Phw@mail.gmail.com>

I am posting this email to the developers group because my current comments
are more developer related. I am contemplating writing a plugin to make up
for the lack of Natural Breaks (Jenks) not in QGIS raster styling. There is
a feature request already to have this added as a core capability, but it
is unfunded.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/39746

I received a request for Jenks raster styling from a team that doesn't
really care whether they use QGIS or Arc. They really like the speed of
QGIS, but the manager gets the question of why doesn't QGIS have Jenks
raster styling because they need it and it is available in Arc. I have
queried some of our folks to see if it is possible to get this funded to be
developed in core QGIS, but that process is quite time consuming and
wouldn't happen anytime soon so my question for near term use is whether it
is worth doing a plugin for it or not. That is really based on the
difficulty of implementation. I'm not really supposed to be taking on new
QGIS plugin development, but if it doesn't take me too much time, then my
management probably won't complain too much.

I have been looking at the documentation for the QGIS classification
methods. I believe these contain all that is needed for doing the raster
classification. Am I correct?

QgsClassificationMethod
https://api.qgis.org/api/3.22/classQgsClassificationMethod.html

QgsClassificationJenks
https://api.qgis.org/api/3.22/classQgsClassificationJenks.html

It appears that you pass in a List of values and it outputs a list of the
ranges. I don't think this needs to be a sorted list. Hopefully that is
the case. I think I could use these classification routines for all of the
styles it supports and apply them to rasters. This seems to be the process:

1. From the input raster image copy all the pixel intensities to a List to
pass to either QgsClassificationMethod or QgsClassificationJenks.
2. The output of these classification methods is a list
of QgsClassificationRange.
3. I am guessing that once you get the output classification ranges you
would then map them to equal segments of the selected color ramp. You would
then add each range to a manual value, color and label.
4. For Interpolation it probably should be set to either Linear or
Discrete. I'm not exactly sure what Mode does and what setting it should be.

There may be a problem with large images and the large number of pixel
values. NODATA values would be skipped. If the imagery gets overly large
only decimated pixels would probably be the way to go. How would you
developers handle this if the image is large? I wouldn't want to create
such a large list to pass to the classification methods that it would crash
QGIS or cause problems.

Am I missing anything that could potentially be a problem?

Rather than a plugin, how much effort would it take for one of you core
QGIS developers to implement and add to QGIS?

Thanks,

Calvin

---------- Forwarded message ---------
With Graduated vector symbology there are various modes such as Equal
Count, Equal Interval, Logarithmic scale ,Natural Breaks (Jenks), Pretty
Breaks, and Standard Deviation to apply the graduated style to the vector
data.

With raster styling there are only "Interpolation" options Discrete, Linear
and Exact, and then the "Mode" of Continuous, Equal Interval, and Quantile.

Is it possible to implement similar styling methods such as Jenks in raster
as you have with vector? Can these styles at least be simulated in some way
with how QGIS is now?

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi Alister,

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsProject.html#qgis.core.QgsProject.createEmbeddedGroup 
and 
https://api.qgis.org/api/classQgsProject.html#ad2e059da29ebfc32096367abb78da46c 
say it should return a QgsLayerTreeGroup so I guess it is broken, at 
least documentation-wise.

https://api.qgis.org/api/qgsproject_8cpp_source.html#l03274 on the other 
hand hints at several "return nullptr" so it returning None is by 
design. The code seems fairly readable and even has useful comments so 
maybe check if one of the cases might be true in your testcase.

Cheers, Hannes

Ah, sorry.
I misunderstood what it does  - I was thinking I could specify an arbitrary
groupName which it would create and load the layers in projectFilePath
into.
groupName is actually meant to be an existing group in projectFilePath, and
it loads that.

Thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] C++ debugging policy/strategy
Message-ID: <Yy3kGOiw5cUq7Bt+@c19>

I often find myself in need to place console printouts to better
understand the flow of data in qgis while analizing bugs, but I never
know how to implement such printouts.

The attempts I usually make are:

  (1)

    qDebug() << "XXX: whatever is " << whatever;

  (2)

    std::cerr << "XXX: whatever is " << whatever << std::endl;

  (3)

    QgsDebugMsg( QString( "XXX: whatever is %1".arg( whatever) );


And I do see each of them used in the sourcetree, but I'm not clear
which of them needs which operator, and I feel like defining 3
operators to support all possible calling conventions is overkill.

An example of such redundancy is in src/core/geometry/qgsrectangle.h
which has:

  CORE_EXPORT QDataStream &operator<<( QDataStream &out, const QgsRectangle &rectangle );

  inline std::ostream &operator << ( std::ostream &os, const QgsRectangle &r) {...}

Is there a development guide to recommend one approach over the other ?
I could not find a specific chapter on this here:

This is fine as a temporary strategy, but don't ever leave these in
code you push to QGIS master. (qWarn is also useful as you'll get a
stracktrace)

Again, ok as a temporary thing, but this one isn't to be left in code
pushed to QGIS.

This is the best approach for anything which will be pushed to QGIS
master, as the QgsDebugMsg macro will become a no-op on release builds
so there's no extra overhead caused by the debug output.
BUT

Don't push code to QGIS master which uses QgsDebugMsg() for anything
BUT reporting unanticipated errors. For all other cases you must use
QgsDebugMsgLevel( "message", level ), where
-   level = 2: for occasionally hit code paths and highly useful
priority debug messages
-   level = 3: more often hit code paths, more esoteric debug messages
-   level = 4: for super-noisy debugging messages in frequently called code

This is an outlier -- it's ancient unused code from > 15 years ago

Also relevant are the various "char *toString( const QgsXXXXX& val )"
methods defined in qgstest.h -- these ARE relevant, and are used when
reporting test failures by the QCOMPARE macro.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsjkBr_-d5oHGtt4q4ASP8_uQPdYDVfpr+oGAHtsfSPN-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs!

I'm after some wider feedback -- in 3.26 I moved the "Georeferencer"
action from the Raster menu to the "Layers" menu, as the georeferencer
was expanded to support more than just raster layers and it no longer
seemed a logical place to put this action.

But we've seen a lot of confusion and bug reports about the missing
action since this move.

I'm pondering whether we should add a second shortcut to the
georeferncer back into the Raster menu, so that this tool will be
available through either location.

Is this a good idea and helps avoid user confusion? Or a bad one which
causes more UI bloat?

Hi Nyall,

Thanks for raising this. Initially I was also confused, but the new menu 
position makes more sense.

I would be -1 on adding it also to the raster menu. If we do add it to 
the "Raster" menu, as a consequence, it would also have to be added to 
the "Vector" menu ...

It just needs a bit of time for people to get used to the new menu 
position in the "Layers" menu, I think.

Andreas

Hi Nyall, Andreas,

I fully agree with Andreas here.
Having the same functions in different locations usually only confuses the
user ("is this function doing the same as the other one?").
So -1 from me as well. The Layer menu makes complete sense with the newly
added functionality.
regards
Werner

Hi Nyall,

I'd agree with Andreas here, so a -1 from me.

Given that many people have mentioned it, would an alternative be to 
post a message in the news feed that appears when people open QGIS?

And/or are 'tips' still a thing in QGIS? I can't remember now, but a 
while ago you had the tips appear when QGIS was opened - although this 
may be long gone now!

Best wishes,
Nick.

Hi Nyall,

I remember getting confused too. When searching for it, the things I 
tried were typing "georef" in the locator bar, in the processing toolbox 
(filter) and in the plugin manager. Not finding anything anywhere there. 
Maybe it would be possible to make that work?

For example all the menu items showing up in the locator?

Kind regards,
Raymond

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Unclear wording for QgsDistanceArea
Message-ID: <bcb112fe-a5d9-b3e3-accb-841ea922d6c8@wheregroup.com>

Hi!

I am in QGIS 3.22 in an empty project set to EPSG:3035.

Considering the following Python code run via the script editor:

 >>> point_a = QgsPointXY(7.824, 48)
 >>> point_b = QgsPointXY(7.829, 47.98)
 >>> da = QgsDistanceArea()
 >>> print(da.willUseEllipsoid())
False
 >>> print(da.ellipsoid())
NONE
 >>> measure = da.measureLine(point_a, point_b)
 >>> print(measure)
0.02061552812809131
 >>> meters = da.convertLengthMeasurement(measure, 
QgsUnitTypes.DistanceMeters)
 >>> print(meters)
2294.910093653533

I was wondering how it was able to turn the seemingly unit-less 
0.0206... into a distance in meters and checked the docs. The 
documentation 
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsDistanceArea.html#qgis.core.QgsDistanceArea.lengthUnits 
says:

 > Usually, the measurements returned by QgsDistanceArea are in meters. 
If no valid ellipsoid is set, then the units may not be meters. The 
units can be retrieved by calling lengthUnits() and areaUnits().

As it said "usually" and I didn't do anything special on purpose, I 
expected this to return a distance measurement in meters but instead I 
apparently got a distance in degrees (well, some cartesian measure 
between my points as a float) which I could *convert* to meters. I have 
no valid ellipsoid set so as the docs say, this could have happened 
("may not be meters").

Checking the .lengthUnits() as suggested confirms that my 
QgsDistanceArea somehow decided to consider my coordinate values, and 
thus the measurement, to be in degrees:

 >>> da.lengthUnits() == QgsUnitTypes.DistanceDegrees
True

But why? I find the language very unclear and confusing there.
Do "usually" and "may" mean that this is undefined, random behaviour 
unless one explicitly sets an ellipsoid?
If so, should the docs strongly suggest to always use an ellipsoid so 
that there is no "may"?
Do those words express the doc writer's vision of how the class what 
usually be used?
If so, should the docs suggest a specific setup of the class?
Why did it consider my point coordinates to be in degrees?
How did it convert the degrees to meters if it supposedly does not use 
an ellipsoid?
8)

Cheers, Hannes

Count me in the list of people who got confused too...but hey, it's better
to break the egg once rather than twice right?

@Raymond Nijssen <r.nijssen at terglobo.nl> I also struggled to find the menu
option, but Nyall nudged me to use the . actions search which works well:

Does this mean it takes qgtest.h inclusion to debug ?

Is there a development guide to recommend one approach over the other ?
I could not find a specific chapter on this here:
