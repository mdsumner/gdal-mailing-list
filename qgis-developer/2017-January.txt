did you check if you are pointing the same pydevd installation from
qgis to aptana/pydev installation?

check in the qgis python console the path used to load the pydevd module

e.g.

>>> import pydevd
>>> pydevd
<module 'pydevd' from
'/mnt/data/PROGRAMMING/IDE/eclipse-cpp-mars-2-linux-gtk-x86_64/plugins/org.python.pydev_4.6.0.201605031722/pysrc/pydevd.pyc'>

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Z or M styling in QGIS
Message-ID: <1483375692149-5301770.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi folks, 
I wish you all a happy new year and best wishes for a winning QGIS3 release!

While working with Z value improvements in QGIS (see [0] ), It became clear
that we have some room for 3D - 4D styling. 

I already have gathered some existing solutions for that:

- Use Matplotlib / plotly external tools to display true 3 D objects even if
those tools are more "plot" oriented.
- Add a panel for vertical cuts like Profile tools and others (we have one
using D3js somewhere, another using a true mapcanvas). This gives a true Z
value. 
- couple QGIS with a browser - like horao for true 3D
http://oslandia.github.io/horao/

I was wondering if a complementary solution could be to improve expression
generator with some iterators that could loop on vertices and generate
geometries (so iterators and aggregators such as SQL generate_series /
aggregate or window function). 
We could then imagine to extend current 2.5 D generator to lines, display
roof steepness, projects depths with dashed lines and so on. 
Does that sound like a feasible solution? Again, this will point out a point
around advanced SQL engine vs qgis specific expressions but whatever the
technical option, I think this could be quite nice. 

Does that ring any bell to someone working on something similar?

All the best!

Yeah it is pointing to the same installation (the only one). However import
pydevd from the console does not work (no module pydevd). But the same setup
is with the other (newer) installation - i cannot import pydevd through the
console, but the remote debug configuration points to the right pydevd
folder and breakpoints work.

I'd say the preferred solution would be a 3d viewer using the Qt 3d
framework (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt3d-examples.html). Then it could be
built in as core functionality instead of as a python plugin (or
relying on a js framework). We'd gain lots of benefits to this
approach, including:
- could be used with a multi-canvas view, with a mix of 2d/3d views
- could potentially reuse existing symbology as surface materials
- could do nifty things like embedding an interactive 3d view in a composer
- could potentially replace the globe plugin

There's already a lot possible here using geometry generators and the
existing expressions. Eg with a marker line style set to markers on
nodes you can use the  @geometry_point_num variable to pull out the
specific node being rendered.

So something like:
z(point_n($geometry, at geometry_point_num))

Throw that inside some type of data defined override and you can style
a geometry's nodes based on their z value.

A geometry generator using  segments_to_lines and geometry_n can style
a geometries segments based on their z/m values too.

There's a lot more we can do, but styling with z/m is already possible
and I know of a few users who are already doing this.

Hi,

I'm currently writing a script that could benefit a lot from
parallelization. Will Processing in QGIS 3 provide parallelization support?
Or is it better to look into how to achieve parallelization independent of
Processing, e.g. using Python's multiprocessing library?

Thank you and best wishes,
Anita

Hi

my fault, you can import pydevd if you set pydevd path in pythonpath,
something that is done on the fly by remote plugin. That's the reason
you can't import pydevd in python console.

btw the problem you describe I had useually when qgis use a pydevd
module different by that used by Eclipse/Aptana... this can happen if
you had upgrade of pydevd module => you have different versions
installed in your pydevd plugin module.

please check in the module path... e.g if your pydevd module set in
remote plugin is:
/mnt/data/PROGRAMMING/IDE/eclipse-cpp-mars-2-linux-gtk-x86_64/plugins/org.python.pydev_4.6.0.201605031722/pysrc

then check in:
/mnt/data/PROGRAMMING/IDE/eclipse-cpp-mars-2-linux-gtk-x86_64/plugins/
if there are different:
org.python.pydev_*

usually Eclipse/Aptana use the newest one.

if this is not the problem, then probably I can't help you directly
without replicating the problem.

regards
Luigi Pirelli

Yes I forgot to mention Qt3D. That would be good to know if someone has
already played with it.

Thanks for the pointer, That works with that expression on a Marker Line
easily to draw vertical edges. See the screenshot here

Wow I just realized that you can combine a geometry generator inside a
marker line. Win!!!

I used that expression, creating a line for each marker with a y
translation using z value:

make_line( translate(point_n(  $geometry,  @geometry_point_num ), 0 ,
-z(point_n($geometry, at geometry_point_num)) ), translate( point_n(
 $geometry,  @geometry_point_num +1  ), 0 ,
-z(point_n($geometry, at geometry_point_num+1))
) )

See http://imgur.com/TlCN7zf


and a video just to underline the immediate feedback when editing :)

Thanks again Nyall, QGIS always allows a lot more than we think. So
great....

Hi all

This is indeed awesome !
Régis, you really should pass this kind of snippet to a broad audience (if
you have time, of course). I do not know if the new QGIS sharing tool is
the right target, or a quick blog post ?

Cheers,
Michaël

Yep, qgis ressource sharing + a blog post (I have a bunch of them to write
on many topics) is the way to go .
About ressource sharing, do we have a centralized repo somewhere. I  don't
want to create one for only a few styles..

Message-ID: <CAP=p+YvN8j6VGRN3SAefRWGeDuVrzmd+mtSx++RdOGUkXnDyGg@mail.gmail.com>

Jumping on the boat of Anita's question, how is multiprocessing planned to
work on QGIS 3.0?

In the past I have tried using it on Windows and ended up with the whole
thing crashing after many QGIS instances were opened. Is that something
that is being looked into?

Cheers,

Hi René-Luc, hi all,

This is something I have been afraid of for a couple of weeks.

Short story: our builds just grew too big and a full build is taking
more than 50 minutes to complete on the travis infrastructure. What
keeps us alive at the moment is the persistent ccache so a full build
actually never happens. If the ccache gets lost, we will need some black
magic to get the builds started again (it's possible to slowly get the
cache warm but not straightforward).

What we could possibly do:

 - Modularize the build: e.g. astyle could very well be moved to a
   separate job along with other static checks like spelling. That would
   even have the advantage of a faster feedback for these analyses.
   But I'm not sure how much time we can actually get out of that.

 - Move dependencies into separate packages. We have some deps like
   qspatialite that are built as part of QGIS which I think could be
   installed as dependencies from a .deb. This will require quite a bit
   of work: moving travis out of the container based infrastructure to
   the sudo-enabled infrastructure, setting up a repo (e.g. ppa) with
   all sort of dependencies including qt 5 etc. This would be an option
   again since travis enabled caching also on sudo systems recently.
   This will be a quite large task to do.

 - Move to another system (managed infrastructure or self-hosted, there
   are a couple of services like circle ci, drone.io, jenkins, gitlab
   ci ...).
   This will be a quite large task to do with the risk that we run into
   yet another timeout, other technical issue or run a self-hosted
   infrastructure for which nobody really has the resources to maintain.

Apart from this, there is also the dependency on some pre-compiled
libraries in the osgeo4a repository. Keeping these up to date is not
something we will want in the long term (I was hoping that travis would
ship a more recent distro than trusty but haven't seen many hints in
this direction yet).

Bottomline: I don't think there's an easy fix but I think it's time to
start thinking about the future.

Matthias

Argh... what a pain! Still, I think in some ways this is a good
reflection of the exponential growth in QGIS unit tests since your
initial work introducing the CI infrastructure. I certainly would
never want to go back to the pre-CI days!

Just wondering- is there any chance sending an email to the Travis
crew could get an extension to this build time? I can't see anything
on their publicised plans, but perhaps they have a cheaper unlimited
build time option available for open source projects?

I'd like to see us exhaust these "easier" options first before
requiring someone to donate time into tweaking/changing the CI
infrastructure.

How long does the build vs test run itself take?

Hi all, 

I agree with Nyall. We should try contracting the travis ci team and ask
them if we could switch to unlimited build time. Even if this means
paying a certain amount for the services (if it is a reasonable price). 

Matthias - could you please take a lead in contacting them? 

Thanks,
Andreas

There's also the risk that the gains would be eroded by the fact that I
believe sudo-enabled builds are slower than container-based ones.

Hi Andreas, Nyall

I would also prefer this, I just sent them a mail and will get back to
you as soon as I get a response.

Mid-term we will still need to launch a project to update the system and
get away from the pre-built dependencies in osgeo4travis to a system
that is easier to maintain collectively but I'm happy if we can wait
with this a bit.

@Tom Chadwin:
agreed, that's a risk indeed

Best regards
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQt4 sip API version conflict with qgis for an
	unrelated qgis project
Message-ID: <CAPn+-XQF5OAaRtWc05Te-kGrkibYFZ11UtOrFNzzR3GLqdR6oA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I didn't know about qgis until a week ago, when I received a bug report on
a PyQt4 program I developed, which doesn't have anything to do with qgis,
since it's intended for music.
It seems that when I use uic.loadUi() to load a window from a Qt .ui file,
somehow qgis interferes with it and gives a ValueError for the sip API
version.

Here's the complete report: https://github.com/MaurizioB/NoLaE/issues/1

The submitter says he'll try my program on a different setup (which doesn't
have qgis installed), but I'm still curious on how and why qgis could
become involved.

Thank for your support.

Maurizio

Hi,

the sip api version gets changed as soon as qgis is imported somewhere.
Aparently uic.loadUi() just loads all available custom Qt widgets found
on the system.

I am not aware of a gentle way to deal with this problem (neither on
your not on our end). I think that's something to ask on the PyQt
mailing list.

Cheers
Matthias

Thanks Matthias,
I think I've understood the problem.
In the meantime, the submitter has confirmed that the problem doesn't occur
in the partition where qgis is not installed, so I suppose you are right.
I could use pyuic4 and build every ui files by hand, but I'd prefer to use
the loadUi, since it's easier and cleaner.
I'll write to the PyQt mailing list and see if they have a solution for
that.

Thank you again,
Maurizio

As a side note to this, I see very little use of [ci skip] in commit
messages [0]. If we are asking Travis to help us out with unlimited (or
longer) build times, it would be neighborly of us to add to our developer
docs (and maybe new PR template) some information on recommended use of [ci
skip] for trivial or non-build/testing-related commits.

Building QGIS jobs certainly must eat a bunch of Travis resources. It would
be good of us to try to ensure extraneous builds are not initiated.

Does anyone know if adding [ci skip] to the merge commit of a PR (that has
already passed tests) skips a CI build on the merged-into branch?

For the time being, I introduced a workaround that helps if someone
modifies (a lot of) low level files.
If the build takes too long, it's possible to split it into two separate
builds, controlled by an environment variable `CACHE_WARMING`.
d
For pull requests:

 1. Add CACHE_WARMING=true to the `env:` Key in travis.yml
 2. Push
 3. Wait for the build to complete (and fail)
 4. Remove the CACHE_WARMING env variable
 5. Push again

For master:

 1. Add CACHE_WARMING=true to the Environment Variables in the travis
settings
      https://travis-ci.org/QGEP/QGEP/settings
 2. Trigger a rebuild of the current commit (travis web interface)
 3. Remove the environment variable
 4. Trigger a rebuild of the current commit

Regards
Matthias

Hi all,
on current master, if I load a coloured TIFF, it is displayed correctly.
If I change the blending mode to Multiply, the NULLs (0s) are displayed
black, and they remain black even if I switch back to Blending=Normal.
On 2.18, the same TIFF is displayed as expected.
Sample image available. Should I open a ticket?
All the best.

according to http://www.gdal.org/frmt_grib.html GDAL, thus QGIS, should
be able to read GRIB data. I did a bit of testing and I cannot get

Subject: [Qgis-developer] reference relation widget - filter by expressions
 and spatial relations?
Message-ID: <1483627224560-5302113.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I'm trying to allow a user to set a relation from reference relation widget. 
I can't find a way to filter candidates by a spatial expression such
map_canvas extent, or better by distance. 
Currently, I have to set the list to read only so that user can't display a
dropdown list of thousands of features, which kills QGIS. User only have the
choice to use the map pointer tool, or use "link it" plugin. 
I saw Alessandro's work for value relation filtering with form "value
relation plugin" , which works great with a python function. 
The same feature for reference relation widget would be cool.

Dreaming of the perfect tool, I even think of these features:
- display name on expression with the ability to compute distance between
current object and candidate
- display on the fly a curved arrow rubberband between selected relation and
current feature, to have a visual feedback before saving (already in link it
plugin)

Is there anyone working on that area? 
Cheers
Régis

Paolo,

This is a bit vague as a description of issues ;-) gdalinfo reports on datasets would be 
a start. GRIB support is generally a pain due to the diversity of the format.

Hi Even,
sorry for being vague - I hoped I was just missing something obvious,
and an howto was already available. Life is mostly more complicated :)
So, symptoms:
* the grib is loaded with a custom CRS:
 * Generated CRS (+proj=longlat +a=6371200 +b=6371200 +no_defs)
* it occupies a thin vertical stretch, from about 1.86884,-1418.31515 to
about 18.142,67.489
* colours are obviously not understandable
* the bands are superimposed, as if it was an RGB file, not
understanding the multiband structure of GRIB
* a series of warning is issued, of the type:
Warning 1: Band 895 of GRIB dataset is 33x23, while the first band and
dataset is 65x45.  Georeferencing of band 895 may be incorrect, and data

That's not really an issue per se, is it? GRIB data comes with non standard CRS, but that's how 
the data is registered. Can be reprojected to WGS84 later if that makes life easier

That's more an issue. There's properly a lack of support for the projection method, or 
something wrong when reading the extent.

That's a defect of the driver I'm aware of. It should expose those as subdatasets to fit the 
model of a GDAL dataset.

Thanks for checking. If there is anything I can do, please do not
hesitate. Could we check zyGrib approach? It seems smooth there.
All the best.

BTW, width seems approx right, height is badly wrong.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] When to start converting our plugins?
Message-ID: <1483638204409-5302167.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

Amazing work going on for QGIS3 - I'm in awe of you all (as always).

I've been getting more and more nervous about how easy it will be to convert
my plugin, so yesterday I started to have a go. With lots of help from
Matthias (huge thanks, as ever!), I got a good way through the process. I
think I can now do it. I certainly don't feel so nervous.

However, Nyall pointed out that there is still a lot of change to come to
the API. I'm happy to abandon the work I've done so far, as it has achieved
its aim of getting me familiar with what the job will entail.

So, my question is, when would be the best time to start the actual
conversion of our plugins? Is there going to be an obvious time in QGIS3
development for this to happen? Can it be announced on the list?

Thanks

Tom

I'd say just before/after feature freeze. There's still some very
large API changes in store, eg Martin's current refactoring of the
project and map layers will likely have large impact on your plugin,
and I'd hate to see you have to "port twice". By the time feature
freeze comes into play the large API changes will all have been locked
in (or have to wait till 4.0!).

There's no time frame for this yet, but I'll fight hard against any
plans for a release before mid-year.

Depends what you're after. When processing is ported to the new task
manager framework then algorithms will be able to run in parallel
(where possible). Eg a buffer for one layer can run while a transform
occurs on another layer.

If you're after parallelization *within* a single algorithm (Eg
buffering features using multiple threads) then I'm unaware of any
plans in place to handle this.



* That said.... read on for some thinking aloud....

I think when we port the guts of processing over to c++ then this will
become relatively straightforward. I'd see this happening:
- algorithms which operate feature-by-feature inherit a special
algorithm subclass (say "QgsFeatureBasedAlgorithm" or something) and
override some base class "QgsFeature processFeature( QgsFeature )"
method. Eg a buffer alg will implement this to buffer the passed
feature's geometry and return a new modified feature.
- QgsFeatureBasedAlgorithm could take advantage of something like
QtConcurrent::mappedReduced to call processFeature on multiple threads
and use the result function to write out the results for each
processFeature call. Nice and (theoretically) easy way to gain
multithreaded algorithms, and it would be simple to adapt many
existing algorithms to this (buffer, centroid, transform, translate,
.... Basically anything which operates on each feature in isolation).

The side benefit of this refactoring would allow something I've wanted
for a while - a way for processing algorithms to modify a selection
inside a layer "in place". Eg select a bunch of polygons, run the
buffer alg on the selection (not sure of the best UI to expose this!)
and each selected feature will be buffered. Currently there's no easy
way to do this in QGIS - you've got to run the alg on a selection and
get a new layer, then delete the selection, and finally copy features
back from the new output layer to the source layer. Yuck.

Will do - it's not my machine, so I only get occasional access. I'll
let you know when I've given it a test.

Sounds sensible. Any ideas on how long between beginning of feature freeze
and release? Could be *a lot* of plugin devs pleading for help from QGIS
devs.

Thanks again

Tom,

While Nyall's right to point out further API disruption on the horizon,
your exercise isn't in vain since the plugin adjustments you've figured out
will still be needed when porting season will open.

If you have time, you should write a blog post somewhere to detail this
experience of yours, I'm sure it'll be useful to many.

I've already updated a rather large plugin some months ago. and created
a compatibilty layer plugin. have a look here

That's true for some changes (such as python 3, Qt 5), but there's no
gaurantee that 3.0 breaks within PyQGIS won't be changed later in the
3.0 cycle.

So yes, this *is* a good time to port to python 3, Qt5, PyQt5 so long
as you don't do major refactoring which may be affected by the PyQGIS
api!

Hi,

One of my phd students are working with a SAGA "Channel network and drainage basins”

He wrote this to me - and I have tried to solve the problem by re-install QGIS - but nothing seems to work. At my computer it´s OK

Can someone try to “translate” the problem:



I cannot execute the “Channel network and drainage basins” plug in. A problem in Saga with the DLL file “gdal_MrSID.dll” seems to be the cause. Attached is a screendrop of the dialogue box and a script from the log. My ‘filled DEM’ seems fine.



I am using Qgis 2.18.2, but have also tried an earlier version 2.16 something, with the same result. I use it on a Dell Latitude E6530 with 4 GB RAM and an i5 2.60 GHz processor operated with a 64-bit Windows 7 Enterprise system.



Sincerely,

Jonas

Hi Tom,

would be great to have your and anybody else's experiences and how tos 
available for reference by then. Is there a website where people can 
contribute?

Hi Nyall, 

Interesting. 

Your "thinking aloud" - is this something that would have to wait for
QGIS 4x or could this be interested in 3.x already? Just wondering ... 

>From a user point of view it would be very interesting to have
processing within a layer in update mode without having to create
separate new layers. Also, of course, the parallelization option (for
certain algorithms where feasible).

Hi, 

Jürgen is the release manager and ultimately proposes/decides when to
release 3.0. So I don't know what his opinion is. 

My personal opinion is in line with Nyall. Core devs should have enough
time to properly prepare everything and do at least the API
changes/redesign/refactoring properly. After 3.0 there won't be API
breaks for a longer time, so it is better to have enough time to do
things properly. 

A double dev cycle, followed by a double test cycle (testing and bug
fixing) would be useful. If we stick with the four month release cycle
with a double dev cycle this could mean a feature freeze somewhere
around May and a release after a two month test/bug fixing period
somewhere around July. Just a very rough idea, and not discussed with
the core devs and Jürgen ... 

Thoughts?

Yes, Matthias pointed me towards it. I intend to use this so that I don't
have to maintain parallel QGIS and 3 versions. Thanks!

I'll try to write something up. No blog these days, but will put it
somewhere and see if I can RSS it and get Planet to pick it up.

@Andreas I just want to have a 3-compatible version launched as soon as
possible. I don't really want 3 to be released and have no version to
accompany it. Yes, I could guarantee everything would work if I develop
after release, but hopefully the feature freeze will give me and others time
to convert our work. 

Thanks, all, for the really useful replies. 

Tom

Hi all,
thanks for the fruitful discussion. I agree:
* the ideal situation is that at least the most downloaded plugins (say,
>=25) are ported during feature freeze, so they are immediately
available for early adopters of QGIS3; this is important IMHO because
the more early adopters, the more early Q3 testing, the faster we'll get
to a stable Q3; missing important plugins will keep users away from Q3
* documents to help plugins devs to migrate are very important, both
formal documents, and real user experiences; better create a place to
start accumulating it (READMEs on GitHub?) and point plugin deveopers to it.
All the best.

Should we do a wiki page on github?

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki

I do not want github to be our final wiki/knowledge base, but for such
temporary pages, I think it is ok?

By all means. All I would say is that anything I might write would be more
conversational and less formal, not least because I would intend to mention
things which real developers would take for granted and already know. For
example, I don't really know Linux, but I am doing this work on Ubuntu so I
can use a nightly. I therefore stumbled over some very basic things (thanks
again, Matthias). Whether documenting that is appropriate on an "official"
QGIS doc is debatable.

Hi Tom,

don't worry, the average 'plugin'-developer are not hardcore dev's
either and for sure not on all OS's. So I think everything that can be
of help for ANYBODY doing some lines of code is usefull in this wikipage.

As an example, I think I would copy this email:
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2016-November/045641.html
in it for a start :-)

And doing it in a wiki, you can make it as conversational as you want
:-) There is nothing 'official' to a wiki page ;-)

Regards,

Richard

Message-ID: <CAKuFJPrgpF=5jhyJsQU+n=w0hdUAyb2GEkWy=byTmTMgUi98GQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I have a problem with Qgis 32 bits,If I use the qgis 64 bits versions, work
prefectly this library when I import cefpython3 with the python console,but
in qgis 32 bits return this log.

import cefpython3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/./python\qgis\utils.py", line 607, in _import
    mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)
  File "C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python27\lib\site-packages\cefpython3\__init__.py",
line 8, in <module>
    from . import cefpython_py27 as cefpython
  File "C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/./python\qgis\utils.py", line 607, in _import
    mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.

what is the diference with Qgis 32 bits/64 bits?

Note: Cefpython work prectly in my computer,only not working when import it
in qgis.

​Yes, definitely within a single algorithm.

Feature-by-feature parallelization would certainly be helpful for many
algorithms.

For my current use case, I'd like to process groups of features (identified
by common attribute value) in parallel ... but that's probably more complex
and less common.

Best wishes,

Hi list -

Is it possible to control map canvas decorations from python ? By 
decorations I mean the "North Arrow", "Scale Bar", "Grid" and "Copyright 
Label" that is user selectable using menu item "View" -> "Decorations".

I'm "only" interested in reading the present settings i.e. "on"/"off" 
and how to set or unset them using Python.


Regards

Bo Victor Thomsen

Hi Bo

Try:

QgsProject.instance().readBoolEntry("ScaleBar", "/Enabled", False)[0]

or something close to that.

Thanks

Tom

Hi,

I think the original idea for the plugin was eventually having it into core
as a Python core plugin.

Any objections if we start the process to make it a core plugin for 3.x ?

It will require some testing and minor tweaks of course.

Hi,

This mainly means it is preinstalled (and enabled) out of the box and
there will updates will happen via the usual QGIS release schedule?

Or is there anything else to it?

That sounds good to me, I think it will be a valuable tool to quickly
get access to good-looking styles!

Are there any plans to have common code for this and the plugin manager?
I think they share some very similar concepts and functionality.

+1
we should also consider in the process if it is worth the while to port
to this also other resource sharing areas, namely Processing models etc.
Thanks Alessandro.

Unfortunately the implementation is rather different.
But of course I suggested Akbar to try to re-use any existing code from
other parts of QGIS and I'm pretty sure he did.

IMHO if it will be merged into core, it should replace style manager,
Processing sharing code and Plugin Manager.

I tried project-related macros, but it seems to me that they are never
launched. I found issue what exactly describes this problem [1]. It

Unfortunately in this case the fix was a quick one which relied on
language features available in QGIS 3 but not QGIS 2.x, so the fix was
not easily backportable. I just stumbled on this bug while
experimenting with possible solution for a project which never went
ahead so I won't be investing any more time into this issue. It's
possible that an interested developer could adapt the fix to Qt4/non
c++11 for 2.x, but I can't volunteer the time to do this.

Obviously, it'll also need porting to PyQGIS 3 before it can be
merged, and I'd want to make sure it's got sufficient unit tests in
place to not add extra burden while the QGIS 3.x API
breaks/refactorings are being performed.

I don't think this replaces style manager though. Style manager has
also undergone significant work in 3.0 and is now really polished and
smooth, so I don't want to see it go. I'd rather python hooks were
added to style manager to allow the resource sharing plugin to
integrate into the existing style manager dialog instead.

What would be nice is if we had the next hackfest just before the
planned feature freeze. So we could discuss in person if there's a
reason to postpone feature freeze by a couple of days/weeks.

Something like:

 * hackfest mid-april
 * feature freeze May 1
 * release July 1

How does that sound to you?

Hi Ale and All,

First I want to apologize that I could not take a look at some PR's
recently for new styles, but Anita and Ale are doing great job giving some
time to look at them. So thanks to both!

Unfortunately the implementation is rather different.
> But of course I suggested Akbar to try to re-use any existing code from
> other parts of QGIS and I'm pretty sure he did

Yes, the implementation is quite different . IIRC I tried to put plugin as
a resource and it worked fine after creating its handler. But it was just a
'dirty curious' work. I need to take some time to think thoroughly the best
way to have them both in one big architecture.

I agree with Nyall too on both points. As I mentioned in the final report,
there are some room for improvements, one of them is to make a good set of
unittests (I am ashamed of myself as some people called me as the unittest
guy and yet I abandoned it on this plugin :)). And it's also not replacing
Style Manager.

Since I couldn't really give some love for this plugin right now (probably
until this summer), if anyone wants to maintain it, please let me know and
I will register you as collaborator. Ale and Anita are already contributors
too to the repository. And if there is a chance for me to work on this
again for GSoC 2017, I am eager to apply once more. But this is something
that I need to talk to my supervisor and depending on this semester result.
Or whether I need to take 'official' internship. So maybe in February I
will know exactly what to do for this summer. But for sure, I will keep my
eyes on this. So keep discussing :)

Cheers

Message-ID: <CA+DVeYBqwDmDM4uN9BbH=CSg9uQsmoMoYSD-ey-60NBkJVwkJA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I am currently evaluating QGIS Server as rendering backend for my new
project; can you give me some insight in the architecture / implementation?
To pose my question more specific: with QGIS Server being a fcgi
application, what data (e.g. parsed .qgs file?) is retained and/or freeing
of resources is deferred between requests?

Much appreciated if any of you can shed a bit of light to the
implementation details of QGIS Server. Possibly there is technical
documentation available online?

Thanks

I want to raise this discussion again.

Currently in Processing we have two kinds of algorithm providers:
- providers which are available in all major platforms out of the box
(e.g. GDAL, GRASS, maybe SAGA and OTB)
- "special" providers which require user to install additional components
(R, TauDEM, LiDAR tools)

Maybe as a first step we can move those "special" providers into separate
plugins? I almost sure that they used only by advanced users who can install
required dependencies. So such move should not harm most our users and
reduce maintenance overhead.

Hi,

QGIS Server is being deeply refactored, and the new implementation is
described in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/74

and: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3866

The current implementation has some limited caching of the capabilities
(taken from the project .qgs file).

Note that with some performance degradation you can still run the server as
plain old CGI.

AFAIK there are no documents about the implemementation: follow the source
Luke :)


Cheers.

Hi list,

Thanks Alessandro. Indeed, I started looking in to the source. It made me
wonder: how does a QGIS Server fcgi instance go about varying MAP=...
parameters in subsequent requests?

>From source it seems to me that the QgsProject object is retained across
the handling of requests (by its fcgi loop). Yet: how about requests coming
in that pass different "MAP=" parameters, selecting different .qgs files?

Thanks
Rob

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg_8Dn_5vfC9zrGJxh=BaGw4+xZvj8yjcejKkZyNTYTWCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I would like to propose a new QGIS menu item that in the menu before the
Project item.  This menu item will contain all the stuff in the Settings
Menu, Exit QGIS, and some of the stuff from the Help menu like About

Motivation:  A lot of application have a "Application" menu with
application-wide settings, etc . I think this would make it clear that
anything in this menu is related to the application itself and not the
project.  Having a Settings menu just floating in the middle of the menu
bar seems strange to me now.

Example

[image: Inline image 1]

Thoughts?

Dear Developers,



In 2017 - the first Hackfest will take place at the Linuxhotel in Essen – Germany from Friday from 28th April - 1st May.

This Hackfest is only going to be hard work for the developers – QGIS 3.0 is being developed and launched this year. More details and signing in for this weekend at

https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/17th_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Essen_Germany_2017





The second Hackfest in 2017 will include a Summer Camp and take place in Nødebo<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi1o9n4eX7o> at University of Copenhagen, Forest and Landscape College, Denmark from Wednesday  2. August till  Friday 11. august

The Summer Camp will be a combination of work and leisure for the developers. And for users there will be workshops.



It is the first time we are having a Summer Camp at the Forest and Landscape College. We have both the place for work and the nature for exploring.

There are 28 rooms/56 beds, 3 large shelters and a large lawn where you can bring a tent sleeping bag and mattress.

Nearby the wonderful forest and lake.



The setup is as following:

Users pay for participating in workshops, food and accommodation (room/bed) – Shelter and tent are free.

Developers and workshop lecturers stays for free.

Call for workshops and sponsors: If you have a topic for a workshop or want to contribute as sponsor, please send me an e-mail at lfi at ign.ku.dk





Save the dates – and we will send out more information about the Summer Camp later this month.

Hi all,

How about the switching between .qgs files for subsequent requests handled
by a single fcgi instance?

Hope someone can just shed a bit more light on this.

Hi Lene,

Thanks a lot for these informations and organization!

I think that the wiki hub was meant to be shut down and that github's
wiki should be used instead:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki

To be confirmed, but last HFs were there.

Cheers,
Denis

I think it's a good idea, having both the project settings and application
settings in the same menu it's confusing for most users.

Hi Nathan,

I understand what you are trying to achieve and it makes sense to me.

On the other hand, almost all applications start with with File / Project
as the first menu entry. So QGIS would break an established convention.

Best wishes,
Anita

> Thoughts?

My 2c:

It seems odd having project properties outside the project menu. I
also find the positioning of this a bit unusual. I'd suggest that the
QGIS menu should appear last, so that we keep to the standard
convention of having the "file" type (project) menu first. I'd also
suggest that Exit QGIS should remain in the project menu so that it
keeps the convention of exit being the last item in the first menu.

On a related note - I'd love to see us add a way for plugins to add
pages to the general QGIS options so that we can avoid menus being
cluttered with additional "settings" items. Eg processing options and
the python console options should just be extra pages in the main
options dialog.

Ignore the project properties in there was just a mistake in UI file.

Hi Nathan,

I think the original idea was to have something like a "File" menu, that 
many applications have, too. Although it is not named "File". Anyway 
IMHO it is a good idea, because many users get general and project's 
settings mixed up and I would not favor renaming "Project" to "File" 
either.
Going into detail: shouldn't "Project Properties..." go into the 
"Project" menu then (and be renamed to "Properties")?
"Snapping Options..." are currently placed in settings, but are a 
project's setting. Should go in the "Project" menu then, too.

File was renamed to Project for a few reasons, mainly for better context
awareness and external non file based projects.  No plans to change that as
I think that works well.

What I was trying to say is that many applications have a "File" menu at 
the first position. As QGIS is not really following that scheme (because 
the menu is named "Project" and I totally agree with not having it 
renamed to "File") I support your idea of the QGIS menu.

Hi all,
Just to point that on MacOS, there's already a QGIS menu at first position.
See

Message-ID: <CAB28AsipzNE-af2TsKcXrktXyu1Qhi=POf47+j9nj=YY7qYvRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just filed a QEP regarding fixing http://hub.qgis.org/issues/2738
- legend customisations are lost when creating a composer from a
template.

I'm keen for feedback on the described approach. I've deliberately
kept the QEP "non-technical" as it's the logic for the approach which
I would like feedback on. IMO the approach is sound, but there may be
something I'm overlooking (or a better approach!).

You can read it here:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Symbolizing a discrete or a boolean raster
Message-ID: <CAK6pVBVuvj8Q8U8AgGRQGAcrG=if29R5FdWjf2BDjS+qia2Ukg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

let me move here a request that has been shortly discussed on the
user-mailing list:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2017-January/038793.html
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2017-January/038795.html
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2017-January/038801.html

and for which a ticket is open:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14845

I was said that some work has been done in this direction for 3.0 but I
don't know if it completely covers the feature request

----------------------

When styling a discrete or boolean raster, there seems to be no direct
method, only a few workarounds. The feature I dream of would do the
following:

   - A new render type "Discrete raster"
   - One button allows to fetch all unique values form the raster (with a
   warning message if there are more than XXX unique values)
   - A color ramp is applied by default
   - I can multi-select values and apply them the same style and / or the
   same label
   - I can remove values. The pixels with those values will simply not be
   displayed
   - I can save my color map and load an existing color map

So pretty much like the ArcGIS implementation:
http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#/representing_unique_categories_such_as_land_use/009t00000074000000/

The current limitations I see (in 2.14):

   - The discrete values must be entered manually, which is a pain for a
   raster with many unique values (or if I don't know in advance what all
   values are)
   - If I click on *Classify*, QGIS will choose X values (based on the
   number of classes and the classification method (continuous or equal
   interval)), which no longer match the "exact" values of my raster. It
   doesn't really make sense to classify a discrete rendering
   - Although it is currently possible to style discrete rasters, the
   procedure is not really intuitive for beginners

----------------------

Is this a feature that is envisioned for 3.0? Is there anything I can do to
support it? (except coding it myself, since I don't have the skills for
that...)

Thanks a lot in advance

Cheers

Stéphane

Message-ID: <1484046507579-5302751.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

I've been meaning to add a donate button to my QGIS plugin's Github repo
README. For anyone who might want to do the same thing, and who likes the
common shields.io style of badges, just add the following:

[![Donate to
QGIS](https://img.shields.io/badge/donate%20to-QGIS-green.svg)](http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/donations.html)

You can see it in action on the qgis2web Github README.

Thanks

Tom

Subject: [Qgis-developer] EPSG v9.0 upgrade
Message-ID: <3120596.LBnunzVJ1o@even-i700>

Hi,

I've updated to the EPSG v9.0 database.

The relevant tickets are:
* libgeotiff: https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/ticket/83
* GDAL: https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/6772
* proj.4: proj.4: ​https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/477
* postgis: ​https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/ticket/3684 (patch submitted)

Combined with that update, I've also applied datum shift overrides for EPSG:4149 (CH1903), 
EPSG:3844 (Pulkovo 1942(58) / Stereo70 Romania), EPSG:31251,31252,31253 (MGI (Ferro) / 
Austria), EPSG:2397/2398/2399 (Pulkovo 1942(83) / 3-degree Gauss-Kruger zone 3,4,5), EPSG:
2065 (S-JTSK (Ferro) / Krovak).

Those were awaiting in various GDAL/libgeotif/proj tickets (*), and were not doable until now 
for most of them, since there was no possibility of defining datum shift overrides specific to 
projected coordinate systems, before the changes done in https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/
changeset/2747 and
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/37080

I think that's to do with the UI guidelines for the MacOS interface which are dictated by Apple more than anything. 

On a side note, if we're talking about mucking around with the menu order, is there any chance of Project, Layer, Edit, ...  ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Compiling QGIS with gdal2
Message-ID: <fa60bbc3-82ce-f9e7-3f6f-7907377e14de@gmail.com>

HI guys,
related to the mail of this morning [0] and thanks to the hint of Nyall,
I'm trying to compile QGIS with gdal2

I'm on a Mint Machine where the default gdal version is 1.11.3. So I
downloaded and compiled from source gdal 2.1 [1]. In fact I get:

matteo at matteo-computer ~ $ gdal-config --version
2.1.0


Now I'm trying to force the cmake config to read this gdal version, that
is I've changed

GDAL_LIBRARY = /usr/lib/libgdal.so.20.1.0

leaving all the other gdal options in the ccmake untouched.

But I always get the same error during the make process, so I think I
have to change other config parameters in ccmake.


Anybody has some hints?

Thanks to all!

Matteo

Should that be in /usr/local?

Check that the include directory points to the version you installed and not the one of the 
system.

Hi Matteo,

1. Find the correct gdal-config (one that prints 2.1.0 if you call
gdal-config --version).
2. Remove all the lines that contain GDAL-specific options in CMakeCache.txt
3. Call cmake -DGDAL_CONFIG=your/path/to/gdal-config ..
4. make

With this workflow, all configuration options should be extracted from
gdal-config without any further manual intervention.

Hi Nathan,
I think this is a good idea.
But then I would suggest that the Project Properties to the Project menu.
Secondly move Plugins right after the QGIS – So the rank would be: QGIS - Project – Layer – Processing - Edit – View – Vector – Raster …
Users also often ask for a Print – menu. ..

Emne: [Qgis-developer] QGIS menu item

Hey all,

I would like to propose a new QGIS menu item that in the menu before the Project item.  This menu item will contain all the stuff in the Settings Menu, Exit QGIS, and some of the stuff from the Help menu like About

Motivation:  A lot of application have a "Application" menu with application-wide settings, etc . I think this would make it clear that anything in this menu is related to the application itself and not the project.  Having a Settings menu just floating in the middle of the menu bar seems strange to me now.

Example



Thoughts?

Guys,

thanks to all! I made it!

I tried every hint, but the quickest way was to add the
ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable repo

then fix some packages version, clear CMakeCache.txt


Many many many thanks to all!

Matteo

There is an established generic menu order in Windows:

File
Edit 
View
Help

We shouldn't unthinkingly deviate from this unless we are confident the
change represents a UX improvement. I would recommend not pushing Edit
further to the right. I believe similar conventions exist on other OSes.

Hi all,
in the download page I read:

Mac Installer Package for both OS X Mavericks (10.9), Mountain Lion
(10.8) and Lion (10.7).

while in http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis it is

For OS X Mt Lion *and newer*

Maybe this should be more explicit in qgis.org?
BTW, are there news about the more standard installer for OSX I heard
about a couple of years ago?

All the best.

I used this link months ago:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/193814/installing-gdal2-1

It was the only way to get QGIS3 to compile and build.

Specifically the answer:
You can download GDAL 2.1 for Windows from GIS Internals. There is an 
installer and a portable version that doesn't require installation.

GDAL 2.1 is available for Ubuntu 16.04 from the UbuntuGIS-Unstable PPA

sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade # if you already have gdal 1.11 installed
sudo apt install gdal-bin python-gdal python3-gdal # if you don't have 
gdal 1.11 already installed

Hi Lene,

Thanks for the information.

Would the second dev meeting in Nødebo also host the annual user 
conference? Would be sad if we would give up on the user conference only 
after two years ...

Thanks,

Andreas

Is there a simple way to do this?

I set Qt Creator to use a local version.
`qtchooser -install -local 5.8 /home/gordon/Qt/5.8/gcc_64/bin/qmake`

And the environment I would like to use for development like this:
`qtchooser -print-env`
`QT_SELECT="5.8"`
`QTTOOLDIR="/home/gordon/Qt/5.8/gcc_64/bin"`
`QTLIBDIR="/home/gordon/Qt/5.8/gcc_64/lib"`

Except I see no easy way to have `cmake ..` find my local package as it 
uses the ones from the Ubuntu 16.04 Qt5 development defaults package.

Hi all,
Great news that we have those events on the rails!

I wondered what happened with madeira and switzerland proposals?  I
struggle with the flow of mails, lists, gitters and IRC and am asking if I
missed something (maybe we should do something about the gitter  - irc
redundancy BTW).

Cheers, and thanks for organizing that, this is a lot of work but really
useful and appreciated!

Hi Andreas,
I´m trying to re-think the conference/short presentations for a limited crowd.
What if we are having presenters making video presentations and then have webinars where so many more participants can attend ?
And this summer additionally have 1½ week of workshops…

There are so many conferences this year -  both FOSS and QGIS local and worldwide. Webinars can reach so many more.
Just ideas.

Hi Lene,

Thanks for the information.

Would the second dev meeting in Nødebo also host the annual user conference? Would be sad if we would give up on the user conference only after two years ...

Thanks,

Andreas

Dear Developers,



In 2017 - the first Hackfest will take place at the Linuxhotel in Essen – Germany from Friday from 28th April - 1st May.

This Hackfest is only going to be hard work for the developers – QGIS 3.0 is being developed and launched this year. More details and signing in for this weekend at

https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/17th_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Essen_Germany_2017





The second Hackfest in 2017 will include a Summer Camp and take place in Nødebo<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi1o9n4eX7o> at University of Copenhagen, Forest and Landscape College, Denmark from Wednesday  2. August till  Friday 11. august

The Summer Camp will be a combination of work and leisure for the developers. And for users there will be workshops.



It is the first time we are having a Summer Camp at the Forest and Landscape College. We have both the place for work and the nature for exploring.

There are 28 rooms/56 beds, 3 large shelters and a large lawn where you can bring a tent sleeping bag and mattress.

Nearby the wonderful forest and lake.



The setup is as following:

Users pay for participating in workshops, food and accommodation (room/bed) – Shelter and tent are free.

Developers and workshop lecturers stays for free.

Call for workshops and sponsors: If you have a topic for a workshop or want to contribute as sponsor, please send me an e-mail at lfi at ign.ku.dk<mailto:lfi at ign.ku.dk>





Save the dates – and we will send out more information about the Summer Camp later this month.

Thanks Lene  ! I missed the 2018 it seems then. Do you have more info on
the forest summer camp? That seems great on their web page.

Other question, Usually the hackfests last for three days. Here you point a
9 days time frame. I'm afraid most of us can't be there during the whole
event. Is there a 3 day sprint planned?

Cheers Régis

Hi Régis,

Switzerland is next year and Maderia also later.



Next month I´ll send out a call for next year hackfests – so we can plan
longterm. There have been contact to several places. But we have ended up
with Essen and Nødebo this year.

Hope you are attending J

Hi all,

Great news that we have those events on the rails!



I wondered what happened with madeira and switzerland proposals?  I
struggle with the flow of mails, lists, gitters and IRC and am asking if I
missed something (maybe we should do something about the gitter  - irc
redundancy BTW).



Cheers, and thanks for organizing that, this is a lot of work but really
useful and appreciated!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Postgis layer_styles table
Message-ID: <c670505f-bd3b-6b91-b983-cb35991f61f7@di.uminho.pt>

Hi,

I would like to improve a little bit the style storage on Postgis.

There are 3 little things I would like to do. That's way I would like to 
discuss them here, prior to any PR. Maybe someone else is working on this.

i) Change the DDL table definition (just column sizes)
ii) Allow users to remove unused styles
iii) Improve error management

Regarding each proposal:

i) The current DDL is (as defined in [1]):

CREATE TABLE layer_styles(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
  ,f_table_catalog varchar
  ,f_table_schema varchar
  ,f_table_name varchar
  ,f_geometry_column varchar
  ,styleName varchar(30)
  ,styleQML xml
  ,styleSLD xml
  ,useAsDefault boolean
  ,description text
  ,owner varchar(30)
  ,ui xml
  ,update_time timestamp DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)

On Postgresql, both the username and column names can have 63 characters 
[3].

a) There is an old feature request [2] to enlarge the owner column name 
(it only has 30 characters right now).

b) Sometimes I use the same name for the table and for the style. It 
makes sense to allow the styleName as long as the table name can be.

My proposal is to change both owner and styleName columns to 63 characters.

So, my first point is: does anyone knows/remembers why these fields were 
defined with 30 characters? Are there any arguments against changing the 
maximum length to 63?

ii) I found no way to delete an exiting style from QGIS interface. 
Styles can be added or changed, but not deleted.

Which would be the best approach to allow users to remove an existing style?

I can allow the removal by adding a small button to the "load style from 
database" dialogue [4]. The user selects a style and the remove button 
becomes available to remove it. It is not a perfect solution, but it is 
easy to implement.

iii) When writing or updating styles, the error management is very 
simple. I would like to provide further information to the user when the 
user is not able to insert, update (or delete) the style. Right now, a 
generic message is presented, that says:
"Unable to save layer style. It's not possible to insert a new record 
into the style table. Maybe this is due to table permissions (user=%1). 
Please contact your database administrator."

Hello all

I've been meaning to add a donate button to my QGIS plugin's Github repo README. For anyone who might want to do the same thing, and who likes the common shields.io style of badges, just add the following:

[![Donate to
QGIS](https://img.shields.io/badge/donate%20to-QGIS-green.svg)](http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/donations.html)

You can see it in action on the qgis2web Github README.

Thanks

Tom

No idea on the history here, but why not make styleName a text column?
There's no benefit to varchar(n) over text fields on postgres unless
there's some application logic which requires the size restriction
(which in this case I don't believe there is).

Probably the "style manager" dialog would be the most logical place to
expose this.

Sounds great, all improvements which would be very much welcomed!

Hi Régis,

Yes the hackfest is normally short – and the same will be in Nødebo – but you also have possibility to take a few days vacation – and stay at the campus. Perhaps a bikeride in North Sealand or visiting castles or Vikingships. This is a possibility to both work hard AND time off. Don´t you think this sound as a good idea ;-)

Surely  a lot of the developers are heading for Boston after the Hackfest, so not sure what the best time for the 4 days of hack would be…

As written in the first mail – more information at the end of this month.

Lene

Thanks Lene  ! I missed the 2018 it seems then. Do you have more info on the forest summer camp? That seems great on their web page.

Other question, Usually the hackfests last for three days. Here you point a 9 days time frame. I'm afraid most of us can't be there during the whole event. Is there a 3 day sprint planned?

Cheers Régis

Hi Régis,
Switzerland is next year and Maderia also later.

Next month I´ll send out a call for next year hackfests – so we can plan longterm. There have been contact to several places. But we have ended up with Essen and Nødebo this year.
Hope you are attending ☺

Hi all,
Great news that we have those events on the rails!

I wondered what happened with madeira and switzerland proposals?  I struggle with the flow of mails, lists, gitters and IRC and am asking if I missed something (maybe we should do something about the gitter  - irc redundancy BTW).

Cheers, and thanks for organizing that, this is a lot of work but really useful and appreciated!

Hi Lene,

Thanks for the information.

Would the second dev meeting in Nødebo also host the annual user conference? Would be sad if we would give up on the user conference only after two years ...

Thanks,

Andreas

Dear Developers,



In 2017 - the first Hackfest will take place at the Linuxhotel in Essen – Germany from Friday from 28th April - 1st May.

This Hackfest is only going to be hard work for the developers – QGIS 3.0 is being developed and launched this year. More details and signing in for this weekend at

https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/17th_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Essen_Germany_2017





The second Hackfest in 2017 will include a Summer Camp and take place in Nødebo<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi1o9n4eX7o> at University of Copenhagen, Forest and Landscape College, Denmark from Wednesday  2. August till  Friday 11. august

The Summer Camp will be a combination of work and leisure for the developers. And for users there will be workshops.



It is the first time we are having a Summer Camp at the Forest and Landscape College. We have both the place for work and the nature for exploring.

There are 28 rooms/56 beds, 3 large shelters and a large lawn where you can bring a tent sleeping bag and mattress.

Nearby the wonderful forest and lake.



The setup is as following:

Users pay for participating in workshops, food and accommodation (room/bed) – Shelter and tent are free.

Developers and workshop lecturers stays for free.

Call for workshops and sponsors: If you have a topic for a workshop or want to contribute as sponsor, please send me an e-mail at lfi at ign.ku.dk<mailto:lfi at ign.ku.dk>





Save the dates – and we will send out more information about the Summer Camp later this month.

Hi again

it seems that the requirements are related (although not 100% similar) to
this other open (and assigned) ticket: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14449

I really hope to see this very needed feature in a coming version of QGIS
and happy to help wherever I can!

Cheers

Hi Régis,
Switzerland is next year and Maderia also later.

Next month I´ll send out a call for next year hackfests – so we can plan longterm. There have been contact to several places. But we have ended up with Essen and Nødebo this year.
Hope you are attending ☺

Hi all,
Great news that we have those events on the rails!

I wondered what happened with madeira and switzerland proposals?  I struggle with the flow of mails, lists, gitters and IRC and am asking if I missed something (maybe we should do something about the gitter  - irc redundancy BTW).

Cheers, and thanks for organizing that, this is a lot of work but really useful and appreciated!

Hi Lene,

Thanks for the information.

Would the second dev meeting in Nødebo also host the annual user conference? Would be sad if we would give up on the user conference only after two years ...

Thanks,

Dear Developers,



In 2017 - the first Hackfest will take place at the Linuxhotel in Essen – Germany from Friday from 28th April - 1st May.

This Hackfest is only going to be hard work for the developers – QGIS 3.0 is being developed and launched this year. More details and signing in for this weekend at

https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/17th_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Essen_Germany_2017





The second Hackfest in 2017 will include a Summer Camp and take place in Nødebo<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi1o9n4eX7o> at University of Copenhagen, Forest and Landscape College, Denmark from Wednesday  2. August till  Friday 11. august

The Summer Camp will be a combination of work and leisure for the developers. And for users there will be workshops.



It is the first time we are having a Summer Camp at the Forest and Landscape College. We have both the place for work and the nature for exploring.

There are 28 rooms/56 beds, 3 large shelters and a large lawn where you can bring a tent sleeping bag and mattress.

Nearby the wonderful forest and lake.



The setup is as following:

Users pay for participating in workshops, food and accommodation (room/bed) – Shelter and tent are free.

Developers and workshop lecturers stays for free.

Call for workshops and sponsors: If you have a topic for a workshop or want to contribute as sponsor, please send me an e-mail at lfi at ign.ku.dk<mailto:lfi at ign.ku.dk>





Save the dates – and we will send out more information about the Summer Camp later this month.

Message-ID: <CALuHMPAzumAD8h_=bSeoS7Q8+xQRA1hru3_LEw6FyFAgfM+N+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Seems suffix we use for QGIS style files (QML) conflicts with
QtQuick/QtQML files which have same QML suffix. This results to wrong
file associations and wrong icons, see for example [0].

Should we rename our QML files to something else like QSL, QMM or
something else?

As the QML has now turned into more then just style I think a full rename
is in order for what it is, which is really all the layer properties.

We can then have a new file type for just style information.

I strongly agree with a menu for qgis-system-wide stuffs, position can be
disscused with UX group (I hope without locking with Apple UX policies that
are too much marketing guided)

I would suggest to use the same vertical "..." menu used in Chrome,
Firefox, OpenLayers etc etc as in the attached image. Calling QGIS a menu
inside QGis could be redundant.

I don't this there would be drawback... would make sense to align the

no problem IMHO

no idea... we should contact Emilio Loi the author of the commit

good Idea, please add deleteStyle as capability and and/or implement

renaming "load style from DB" widged as Saved styles manager can solve

Many investigations have shown *decreased* usability when menu items are
"hidden" in a hamburger menu. First example from a simple Google search:

https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/

There are many other such studies.

Hi,

I have just received the confirmation from travis that they boosted our
build times to 90 minutes.
I think that should keep us alive for the foreseeable future.

Please let me use this opportunity to highlight the excellent support
from their side!

One last message for today (sorry for spamming!)

It seems that this feature would actually be wished by "many" people (see
the ticket and the talks on user-). I just gave a try to 2.99-nightly and,
as far as I can see, nothing has been done in this direction (yet?).

I am wondering if there are massive challenges that I am overlooking or if
this could be implemented quite easily. In any case, do you think this is a
request that can be taken on to 3.0?

Thanks a lot to all the devs here... I feel quite bad for asking for a new
feature while not having the competences to contribute a tiny bit to its
development but I really feel this is one of the few major missing features
in QGIS right now (and will be happy to help on the feature requirements,
the tests, etc.).

All the best!

Stéphane

Hi,
Some other points below:

1/ An option I couldn't understand is in Layer properties dialog -->
General tab, the option *Layer name .... displayed as .... *where you can
only change the layer name but the "displayed as" is immediately synced
with it.
I'd expect the Layer name to not be modifiable and the displayed one to be
the way I want it to appear in my project.

2/ Being able to give a title to the symbology, which will be used by
default in the composer legend. I mean, with a single layer, I can prepare
different styles showing different analysis of the same data (let's say
"type of service of airports" in a case  and "level of activity of
airports" in other one). But I can only have a single name for the layer
regardless these styles. So when this layer is added to the composer legend
the group name that is displayed is the layer name which I would then need
to replace for a more related title. Having a title set in the Symbology
dialog (and saved within the style) would help to skip that step.
This title could also be displayed in the Layers panel, just under the
layer name.

Should I open issues in the UIX platform or should I rather open the issues
in redmine?

Thanks,
Harrissou

Hi all,

How about the switching between .qgs files for subsequent requests handled
by a single fcgi instance?

Hope someone can just shed a bit more light on this.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] LINEARRING not valid
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C58143BB@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hi all

I have a simple LINEARRING which I would like to use for processing:

LINEARRING (592457.52 6227645.26,592454.37 6227645.98,592448.43 6227647.35,592454.15 6227672.3,592428.66 6227678.14,592422.51 6227651.33,592412.78 6227653.56,592419.05 6227680.86,592424.64 6227691.08,592465.86 6227681.63,592457.52 6227645.26)

When I insert it into QGIS 2.18.2 using the QuickWKT plugin and afterwards run the "Vector\Geometry Tools\Check validity" (method: QGIS, GEOS reports it as valid) on the resulting layer, I get an error saying:

    segments 0 and 9 of line 0 intersect at 592457.52, 6227645.26

The LINEARRING comes from a valid polygon and I would expect the LINEARRING to require some form of intersection at that point, since it's the start and end point of the ring.

I have tried doing a "Vector\Geoprocessing tools\Fixed distance buffer" with zero distance on the layer, but it returns a "None" geometry.

Why is this ring invalid? Is this due to numeric precision and what can I do to circumvent it?

Regards, Casper

Hi all,

just chiming in to express our need for this improvement as well, and we
would very welcome any improvement in this direction.

Hello Stéphane,

IMHO, since it seems that you are not able/willing to sponsor the feature
yourself, sounds like a good opportunity for a small crowdfunding.

That way you would be able to contribute back to QGIS by giving your time
in finding a developer able to do it, setting up the crowdfunding,
advertise it, pay for part of it and so on.

It looks like a simple feature. it should not be very expensive (much less
than an ArcGIS license for sure), and if you think many people need this,
then the money will be easy to raise.

One last message for today (sorry for spamming!)

It seems that this feature would actually be wished by "many" people (see
the ticket and the talks on user-). I just gave a try to 2.99-nightly and,
as far as I can see, nothing has been done in this direction (yet?).

I am wondering if there are massive challenges that I am overlooking or if
this could be implemented quite easily. In any case, do you think this is a
request that can be taken on to 3.0?

Thanks a lot to all the devs here... I feel quite bad for asking for a new
feature while not having the competences to contribute a tiny bit to its
development but I really feel this is one of the few major missing features
in QGIS right now (and will be happy to help on the feature requirements,
the tests, etc.).

All the best!

Stéphane

Hi

let me move here a request that has been shortly discussed on the
user-mailing list:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2017-January/038793.html
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2017-January/038795.html
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2017-January/038801.html

and for which a ticket is open:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14845

I was said that some work has been done in this direction for 3.0 but I
don't know if it completely covers the feature request

----------------------

When styling a discrete or boolean raster, there seems to be no direct
method, only a few workarounds. The feature I dream of would do the
following:

   - A new render type "Discrete raster"
   - One button allows to fetch all unique values form the raster (with a
   warning message if there are more than XXX unique values)
   - A color ramp is applied by default
   - I can multi-select values and apply them the same style and / or the
   same label
   - I can remove values. The pixels with those values will simply not be
   displayed
   - I can save my color map and load an existing color map

So pretty much like the ArcGIS implementation:
http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#/representing_unique_categories_such_as_land_use/009t00000074000000/

The current limitations I see (in 2.14):

   - The discrete values must be entered manually, which is a pain for a
   raster with many unique values (or if I don't know in advance what all
   values are)
   - If I click on *Classify*, QGIS will choose X values (based on the
   number of classes and the classification method (continuous or equal
   interval)), which no longer match the "exact" values of my raster. It
   doesn't really make sense to classify a discrete rendering
   - Although it is currently possible to style discrete rasters, the
   procedure is not really intuitive for beginners

----------------------

Is this a feature that is envisioned for 3.0? Is there anything I can do to
support it? (except coding it myself, since I don't have the skills for
that...)

Thanks a lot in advance

Cheers

Stéphane

Hi Alexandre

(also posting on user-)

I 100% agree with you and I would love to somehow give back to QGIS (I did
already, but at a small scale).

I mostly wanted to know if I am the only one to wish for this feature.
Apparently not the case: many have expressed the same wish!

Now funding: I would love to have a rough idea what "not very expensive"
means. If there are any dev around who could have the interest / skills to
implement this feature, can we somehow go concrete and work together on a
feature description and tentative budget? The situation is obviously very
different if we talk about 1.000 or 20.000€

Cheers

Stéphane

Subject: [Qgis-developer] No GRASS7 In Processing in QGIS master
Message-ID: <95ce5720-8420-064f-2edd-da65545027ae@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

when I try to run a GRASS algorithm with Processing the following
message appears:

super-class __init__() of type MessageBarProgress was never called See
log for more details


and then the default message that GRASS is not found on the system:

This algorithm cannot be run :-(
It seems that GRASS GIS 7 is not correctly installed and configured in
your system. Please install it before running GRASS GIS 7 algorithms.


GRASS is correctly detected when running cmake:

-- Found GRASS 7: /usr/lib/grass72 (7.2.0, off_t size = 8)

and I can normally use it as standalone.

Are there some issues with my installation or is that a global issue?

Thanks!

Matteo

Hi all

upon advice from Andreas, I started a formal description of the
requirements for such a feature:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cDemM2m88_mbs65sYzfBbVdHI_ObOjf_i35ne3OKsRs/edit?usp=sharing

Please, anyone interested, do check, comment, add, correct,... Once we have
a "final" version, I will inquire a more precise financial estimation. Then
let's see how we can move forward!

Thanks and cheers

Stéphane

Before proceeding with changes, which suffix should we choose?
For me QLP proposed by Alexandre Neto looks more suitable, as
currently .qml contains not only styling setting. So we can leave
QSL for future when/if we decide to export only style/labeling
settings into shareable file.

Just checked and QLP is the extention for some printer drivers files. Not
sure if that's a big problem or not.

What do you think about leaving QML for some time as a (deprecated)
recognized extension for import?

I'm worried about users not being able to import their old style QML files.

Hi Matteo,

A quick look at the algorithm code shows, that there is no output with
the name OUTPUT defined in the algorithm. The name of the output file is
determined based on the input file.

There is no logic in place to handle such a case without writing custom
test logic (i.e. no yaml based test).

I wonder if it wouldn't be better to effectively "fix" the algorithm so
it will write the result to a defined location (configurable with an
output parameter). As far as I can tell, it's impossible to use the
output of this algorithm as input in another algorithm in a model the
way it currently stands.

Best regards
Matthias

Hi Matthias,

thanks for the complete answer.

However I added the qgis:createspatialindex algorithm that does not
produce any output (but it is still "linked" to the input layer) and the
test runs fine with the parameter

result: {}

in this way I thought it is possible to check the output (without
testing it) but testing the algorithm itself, i.e. the algorithm runs
fine and creates the output.


Thanks again for the availability

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Matteo,

Not sure if I can follow, was that another question?

Adding a simple "smoke test" for createspatialindex sounds fine. One
that does not check results but rings the alarm if an exception is thrown.

In the case of extractprojection that would work as well of course.
But if you are at it already, I think it's better to do things properly.

I think there is a html file created which could be
* checked for correctness in a test
* and potentially used as input for other algorithms

so I think that's a different case and it should be fairly simple to fix
the algorithm.

Best
Matthias

Hi Matteo,

I never tested this kind of smoke tests. Best to check yourself if it
works. Add a line that will raise an excpetion in an algorithm and check
if the test fails. Something like `int('oops')` as first line in
processAlgorithm() should do the trick.

You are right, there's no html file. I guess in this case it's even on
purpose that the .wld file has the same name as the original file and
another smoke test is ok. I was just thinking about an .html file based
on the content of your first message.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Create memory layer containing only features
 visible in current canvas extent
Message-ID: <1484237252927-5303218.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

I currently create a memory layer from an existing layer as follows
('usedFields' is a subset of the original layer's attributes/fields):

newlayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri, layer.name(), 'memory')
writer = newlayer.dataProvider()
outFeat = QgsFeature()
for feature in layer.getFeatures():
    if feature.geometry() is not None:
        outFeat.setGeometry(feature.geometry())
    attrs = [feature[f] for f in usedFields]
    if attrs:
        outFeat.setAttributes(attrs)
    writer.addFeatures([outFeat])

What is the best way to add only features visible in the current QGIS view
of the canvas, rather than every feature in the layer?

Thanks

Tom

I've found this method:

viewportPolygon =
QgsGeometry().fromWkt(iface.mapCanvas().extent().asWktPolygon())
layer = iface.activeLayer()

resultlayer = QgsVectorLayer("Polygon", "result", "memory")
resultlayer.dataProvider().addAttributes(list(layer.dataProvider().fields()))

clippedFeatures = []
for feature in layer.dataProvider().getFeatures():
    clippedGeometry = feature.geometry().intersection(viewportPolygon)


>From http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/74471/36921

However, this loops through all features. I'm concerned that this will
struggle with large layers. Is there a more efficient method?

I guess that's unsuitable for layers of millions of records.

Hi Tom

Try something like this:

request = QgsFeatureRequest(iface.mapCanvas().extent())
request.setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.ExactIntersect)
for f in layer.getFeatures(r):
  print f.id()

This feature request will only use features that intersect canvas
view. The extra flag ExactIntersect is there to make sure that true
intersection test is done, rather just doing fast intersection of
geometry's bounding box with the canvas extent recangle.

Cheers
Martin

This looks ideal. Thanks, both. Plus I could make ExactIntersect an option in
the GUI, as sometimes dotted could be more critical than accuracy.

Thanks again

There's already a test for this - see

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/e7e9ba0efc66761193e98b384dda318609cac05c

Basically you need to flag that an algorithm modifies a given dataset
in place by adding the 'in_place: true' line to an input dataset.
Then, you also need to indicate that the result file should match the
modified in place dataset by adding 'in_place_result: true' to the
expected result.

This is all done manually - the 'create test' option in the processing
log doesn't have anyway to automatically handle this.

Doing this allows the processing test to know that it needs to make a
temporary copy of the input dataset, run the alg, and then compare
results against the modified input dataset. So basically it tests both
that the algorithm ran and also checks that the results are as
expected.

Hi devs,

I saw the PR to improve/start the QGIS Generic Help system [0], thanks Alex!

I was just thinking a way to take advantages of this new method for
improving the help files of Processing, especially for SAGA.

I know I'm boring, but IMHO having super algorithm without any guide on
the input, output and parameter is barely useless (except if the user
knows already the algorithm).

In December I pointed out a similar question [1], could we make some
default link to the SAGA url(s) and algorithms?

Just my 2 cent

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Matteo,

Yes, this is the idea as far as I understand.
What's missing is the concept.

Here a proposal:

 * Add a new helpTag property to the processing GeoAlgorithm class

 * Set the help tag to something like
    processing_algs/saga/grid_analysis/aggregation-index

 * Within our documentation server
   * Create pages where we have extra docs for algorithms
   * Add a rewrite rule (or some other script logic) to forward the
     browser to the upstream documentation, where no override exists.

What would also be nice if someone with experience and connections could
check with saga, grass, etc. how collaboration could work, especially
also w.r.t. to translation of algorithm documentation.

Matthias

Hi all,
Processing stopped finding my GRASS7 install:

This algorithm cannot be run :-(
It seems that GRASS GIS 7 is not correctly installed and configured in
your system. Please install it before running GRASS GIS 7 algorithms.

while I do have it installed:

i  grass - Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS GIS)

i A qgis-provider-grass - provider GRASS per QGIS

Could it be due to an upgrade? Im on Debian Sid, and I have grass 7.2.0-1
All the best.

IMHO the GRASS help is fine as it is, and should not be rewritten, just
made it available to the user. The current situation is fine, I think.
Main problems are with SAGA and our own algs.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

Are you referring to the quality of the upstream help?

My proposal offers to do both:

 * By default use the upstream help if quality is good enough
 * Override *where necessary*

What about translation?

agreed

I'm not sure it is translated upstream - if not, however, it shuld be
done at that level, it makes no sense to do it downstream.

All the best.

Agreed, do you know someone with experience and connections who could
check with them how collaboration could work, especially
also w.r.t. to translation of algorithm documentation?

Hi,
I see an update for my Linux Mint to grass 7.2.0-1 hanging around in the  
update manager for a week or so, and this time I was so wise to ignore it  
;)
With currently installed 7.0.5-1 it works (am on 2.14.10).

In general, how can we avoid getting in trouble with those updates?

Cheers
Bernd

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New mailing list for QGIS Web Client 2 (QWC2)
Message-ID: <6585fbc42a81359310083e0d8654f814@carto.net>

Hi all, 

QGIS Web Client 2 (QWC2) is the second generation QGIS web client and is
now in late alpha/early beta stage. This second version uses modern
libraries (OpenLayers3, React, nodejs) and is fully responsive. You can
use the same version for traditional desktop web clients and touch
devices (phones/tablets). The initial version was developed from
Sourcepole, but now is open to everyone for contributions. QWC2 is based
on the Mapstore2 project from GeoSolutions. 

There is a new mailing list about QWC2 at
https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-qwc2, where you can: 

- get help for initial setup 

- discuss issues and further development of QWC2 

You can find the QWC2 repo at https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app with
instructions about installation. Feel free to come up with pull requests
about further installation hints, should you find some improvements. 

If you have bug and feature requests, please create a new issue at
https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/issues  

The reason why we split this mailing list from the regular QGIS-user
mailing list, is that discussions will at time be quite technical and
web-centric, with server setup, Apache, javascript, etc. - not the usual
stuff of the QGIS Desktop mailing list. 

With tomorrows website update, the list info should also appear at
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/mailinglists.html#qgis-mailinglists
 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Hey,

Do we have an update when we might have nightly builds for Windows for QGIS
3.0 for users to test?

Giving the large number of changes in 3 we need lots of ramp up time for
users to test with.

Regards,
Nathan

In fact, cmake complains:

-- Could not find GRASS 7

Any hint?
Thanks.

Many thanks, Matthias and Martin - I got it working exactly as you suggested.
Is this the mechanism which QGIS itself uses to determine which features are
in the viewport?

I'm running into some performance issue which I thought this would help, but
they are not solved yet, so I might soon have a more general question about
identifying bottlenecks in PyQGIS code.

Tom

It will possible take togheter QGIS 3 and the old release to make test on

I suppose on Windows it's possible, but on Linux distributions there will
be libraries conflicts.

I do it happily on a Linux machine as well, either running directly from
the build directory or on a custom CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

Matthias, what about dev libraries? Do you keep them in separate folders?
I have 2.14.10 LTR for my production tests but I would like to build QSIG
3. I'm worried that downloading the required dependencies for QGIS 3 will
cause conflicts, am I wrong?

I just run it from the build dir.
All the best.

Hi Giovanni,

I use the same (system provided) dev libraries for both. The only thing
that could potentially get you into trouble is the recent requirement
for GDAL >= 2 but QGIS 2.14 is also compatible with newer GDAL versions.

ok thanks Matthias. I was worried with Qt5, PyQt5 and so for. I will try
(fingers corssed!).

@Paolo: I run from build dir too, but I was asking about dev libraries not
QGIS build.

Message-ID: <CAH5HFGme8p5P4MLsL0oUO9OD5qtke38=T39uKbkEyS8frfar2Q@mail.gmail.com>

If I open 'OSGeo4W Shell' from the installed shortcuts with either of the
following versions of QGIS (all installed from the 64 bit standalone for
Windows), and type 'make' in the shell, my the command is found and my
plugin's makefile is executed:

2.8.2
2.12.3

But if I do the same for the following versions, the make command can't be
found (the shell reports 'make' is not recognised as an internal or
external command...):

2.16.1
2.18

Can anyone shed any light on this and what I need to do to fix the problem?

Yeah it works on Sierra so we should update it to say 'or newer'. I fixed the download page here:

Yes Larry is working on it, just give him time because he is getting the whole stack set up to work cleanly under brew (like apt for MacOS).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SLD parsing: handling ogc:Literal within
	CssParameter PR #3996
Message-ID: <e0bc80f2-5707-2db2-f471-08123f0c0441@di.uminho.pt>

Hi devs,

This message introduces the PR #3996 [0] to the developers mailing list.

QGIS fails to load SLD files with valid SLD syntax that uses
<ogc:Literal> to specify the value of a <CssParameter>.

This works:
<CssParameter name="stroke-width">2</CssParameter>

This fails:
<CssParameter name="stroke-width">
	<ogc:Literal>2</ogc:Literal>
</CssParameter>

Both are valid SLD syntax.

I noticed this behaviour when importing styles with the Geoserver
Explorer plugin. I opened an issue on qgis-geoserver-plugin [1]. From
the discussion with Luigi Pirelli, it seems wise to start by solving the
problem on the QGIS side.

So, my plan is to fix QGIS and then also fix the qgis-geoserver-plugin.

I've made my humble first PR to QGIS regarding this issue. I hope I did
it right.

More details

To confirm this behaviour, we can use the default data and styles used
by Geoserver. Several default styles from Geoserver uses this
<ogc:Literal> tag, and that's why so many styles are not parsed correctly.

Let's use the shapefile geoserver/data/data/sf/streams.shp and the style
geoserver/data/styles/simple_streams.sld as an example. Those files can
be downloaded from [5].

1) The style uses <ogc:Literal> tags around <CssParameter> values.

2) The style is valid according to the SLD definition.

xmlstarlet val -s
http://schemas.opengis.net/sld/1.0.0/StyledLayerDescriptor.xsd
simple_streams.sld
simple_streams.sld - valid

3) When the style is loaded in QGIS, these values are not parsed and the
default values are assumed instead.

4) The rendering on Geoserver is [2]. The render on QGIS (right now) is [3].

The same syntax is used in other default Geoserver styles.

Note: The <ogc:Literal> is properly handled when it appears in the
context of a Filter. For example, the following SLD is already properly
imported:

          <ogc:Filter>
            <ogc:PropertyIsBetween>
              <ogc:PropertyName>PERSONS</ogc:PropertyName>
              <ogc:LowerBoundary>
                <ogc:Literal>2000000</ogc:Literal>
              </ogc:LowerBoundary>
              <ogc:UpperBoundary>
                <ogc:Literal>4000000</ogc:Literal>
              </ogc:UpperBoundary>
            </ogc:PropertyIsBetween>
          </ogc:Filter>The problem

The limitation is only when a value of a <CssParameter> parameter is
surrounded by <ogc:Literal>.

The solution

To solve this issue, I've changed
QgsSymbolLayerUtils::getSvgParameterList at
QGIS/src/core/symbology-ng/qgssymbollayerutils.cpp

Instead of just get the value from the firstChild(), I add a test to
check if there is an additional <ogc:Literal> ElementNode. So, the value
can be or not be within a <ogc:Literal> tag.

The rendering on QGIS, after applying the changes proposed, is [4].

[0] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3996
[1] https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-geoserver-plugin/issues/58
[2]
http://webgis.di.uminho.pt/~jgr/geoserver%20rendering%20of%20simple_streams.png
[3]
http://webgis.di.uminho.pt/~jgr/qgis%20rendering%20of%20simple_streams.png
[4]
http://webgis.di.uminho.pt/~jgr/qgis%20rendering%20of%20simple_streams%20fixed.png
[5] http://webgis.di.uminho.pt/~jgr/simple_streams.zip

I would love to provide unit tests to confirm the error and to show that
the proposed solution works, but I need to study more deeply how to
write tests. I've just tried to find out a test that already reads SLD
files, but I didn't find any. So, I think I have to write the test from
scratch.

I would like to thank Luigi Pirelli for the initial comments and
pointing me the this approach.

Please be gentle: it is my first PR.

Regards,

J. Gustavo

Hi,

Processing is still expecting GRASS version 7.0.x (grass70). See in
../python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/Grass7Utils.py

This needs to be updated, since GRASS 7.2.0 is the new stable version and
is available in the major repositories.

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposal - Change mIconProjectionEnable/Disable
	Icons
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GELS0=MkbwaS7H_dVxvVqwoDJAj7i9uKWLPRiyRrOK3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Proposal: for consistency, change the current mIconProjectionEnable and
mIconProjectionDisable Icons. These are the Icons next to the EPSG code

Rationale: While converting those icons from PNG to SVG, I could not
understand what they were, or try to represent. Besides, these buttons open
the CRS tab in project properties, which uses another Icon (CRS.svg). So,
for consistency and user's recognition, it would be better to use always
the same icon when we are referring to select a CRS.

My idea is to use the CRS.svg icon as a base to create a version for
enable/disable icons that look good at 16x16 pixels.

http://imgur.com/O7hKsmK

I would also replace the Icon in the capture coordinates plugin, which is
the same.

Any objections to this?

+1 for me.  Icons should have the same meaning over all the application.

What about a cross out though the icon, to show not enabled?

When I was originally working on on the fly projection support a long time ago I added that icon so you could en/disable OTF in case OTF had some side effects. Many years have passed and I would guess there isn't much reason to ever have OTF disabled. Does anyone still have a use case for this? If not, why don't we just make it permanently enabled? And then use the project properties icon in greyscale down in the status bar (which I still find pretty convenient to have there).

While we're on this - what about changing the logic so that instead of
showing "(OTF)" when reprojection is enabled to instead showing "(OTF
off)" when it's DISABLED. I think reprojection on normal for 99% of
users and it's more important that we instead alert users when it's
NOT switched on (as the map could be misleading).

Big +1, for these reasons:

- OTF off results in confusing and often misleading measurements - see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3992
- There's no performance penalty associated with OTF when no
transformation is required - everything is short cut so no projection
is done
- If user's really want to display a layer in a different CRS to what
the layer has, they should just manually select a new CRS for that
layer in layer properties.

Agreed - things will get easier if OTF is always enabled.

If we do such change, I would suggest that we allow layers to have unknown
CRS. Right now all layers are forced to have a valid CRS - if not, a dialog
to choose CRS will be shown or a default CRS would be assigned. Allowing
unknown CRS would basically exclude a particular layer from any OTF
reprojections. There could be a small warning icon in the layer tree next
to layers with undefined CRS to make user aware of the problem. I really
don't like the fact we force people choose CRS for layers even if they do
not know it (and popup dialogs are not very nice UX anyway).

Cheers
Martin

Hi all

I have seen that quite a few people had a look at this feature description
but only few commented or modified it. Can I assume that most agree with
the description as it is and would support / welcome such an implementation?

If no major concern, I would love to ask a quote to a few devs by the end
of this week so that we can quickly evaluate the financial options.

Thanks a lot in advance!

Stéphane

Generally agreed. I use and teach not to use OTF of when:
* checking in case of trouble (layers misaligned): switching off allows
a better understanding of what has gone wrong
* digitizing: people may digitize in the wrong place, if they are not
aware OTF is on
* analysis: there is a warning, ON by default, to avoid mixing CRSs, but
if OTF is OFF, things are more immediately clear to the user
So having it permanently ON, with the possibility of switching OFF
manually, seems fine to me.
BTW, it should be noted that we currently allow invalid reprojection,
e.g. a global layer on a local CRS, with weird results and potential
freezes (crashes no longer happen, but were a problem years ago). It
would be good to check the bounding box of each CRS and avoid invalid
combinations.
All the best.

Thanks a lot Pedro. Does someone know whether GRASS devs are going to
change the name of the executable for each version? Perhaps it would be
simpler to add an alias to the package?
All the best.

Hi all,
AFAICT, we mostly agree on:
* freezing just after Essen HF, with possibility of delaying it in case
the need will arise there
* release just after Nodebo HF, again with the same clause.
Would this fit?
All the best.

Hi Stéphane, 

Looks good! Go ahead and ask some devs for quotes. It may be that they
will have some feedback regarding your requirements. 

Regarding the crowd funding itself. Some devs already did successful
crowd funding campaigns and have some experience with it. You can ask
the devs about it and what their opinion is. It may make sense to ask
for a minimum amount of contribution. It doesn't make sense to collect
very small amounts (e.g. 10 EUR) as the administrative overhead may
become too much of a burden (or you have to pay a lot of fees to crowd
funding providers). If you still want to do small donations, you have to
factor in that a commercial crowd funding provider often keeps 5-10 % of
the contributions (in combination with credit card fees and currency
conversions). 

Thanks for taking the initiative! 

Andreas

I feel quite bad for asking for a new feature while not having the competences to contribute a tiny bit to its development but I really feel this is one of the few major missing features in QGIS right now (and will be happy to help on the feature requirements, the tests, etc.).

Yes, changing the executable and install path for every version is a
long established practice in the GRASS community to support multiple
versions installed at the same time.

Hardcoding a version is wrong.

The Debian package installs the /usr/bin/grass symlink to the
/usr/bin/grass<XY> version specific executable.

But you can't rely on that being available on all platforms, so you need
to test for the various possible executables.

Kind Regards,

Bas

OK, so it turned out this is a long standing issue:
https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/ticket/846
I suggested to move the translation files to Transifex, so we could
motivate more people to contribute:
https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/ticket/846#no4
Let's see how it goes.
For now, I think having the EN GRASS help everywhere is good enough for
our users.
All the best.

Hi,

same problem here on Linux Mint Sarah (as pointed out by Bernd).

My cmake does not complain:

-- Found GRASS 7: /usr/lib/grass72 (7.2.0, off_t size = 8)

but I get the same error of Paolo.

Thanks to all

Matteo

Hi,
My plugin VDLTools has been approved last week, but now that my colleague wants to install it, he obtains an error : "corrupted extension : invalid syntax".
I checked that the package name is same than directory name, but looks good (saw that it could be the problem on the net).
Where does it come from ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Valid or invalid geom in PostGIS?
Message-ID: <b36921aa-ba41-5967-0a8d-4fea2c05c3a0@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
when loading a layer in QGIS 2.18 I get from the PostGIS log panel a
series of notices of the type:

2017-01-16T11:34:52	1	NOTA: NOTICE:  Self-intersection at or near point
619746.32941695023 4869530.4882389866
2017-01-16T11:34:52	1	NOTA: NOTICE:  IllegalArgumentException: Invalid
number of points in LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or >= 4

Howevet, geoms seem valid:

select ST_IsValid(the_geom) from istat where ST_IsValid(the_geom) = FALSE;
 st_isvalid
------------
(0 rows)

I'm puzzled, any explanation?
Thanks.

QGIS retrieve geometry from postgis using WKT or WKB ?

AFAIK The WKT is less precision than WKB.

This is the commit with the proposed changes.

It has the new Icons and different behavior of the CRS text. I.e:

When OFT is enable, it will show only the EPSG:<code>
When OTF is disable, it will show EPSG:<code> (OTF off)), besides the icon
is crossed.

Note: I did not change the default settings to make OTF enabled by default.

Hi, do you have enabled the postgis server-side simplification for this layer? Maybe it could throw these errors.

QGIS retrieve geometry from postgis using WKT or WKB ?

AFAIK The WKT is less precision than WKB.

It was enabled for one of the layers. Disabling and reenabling it did
not trigger these errors. However, the strange thing is that errors are
logged *before* opening the project: maybe due to the previews?
All the best.

Hi,

I dont know any postgis specific server-side simplification option.

:(

Perhaps you mean the "rendering --> Enable feature simplification by 
default for newly added layers" ?


Thx.

Yes, Paolo is right.
There is a project option to set the simplification default setting for new layers. But you can change this setting to each layer you want (e.g layers throwing these errors).
Could ST_RemoveRepeatedPoints from QGIS 2.14 to be the guilty?
http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog214/#feature-use-st-removerepeatedpoints-for-server-side-simplification-with-postgis-2-2-or-newer-layers

This is a GEOS error that is being reported

Look for  'ST_SelfIntersections(..)' in PostGis
- it will show the points that cause such errors
-- not sure of PostGis has this command

The first error
- is often a POLYGON that has been created from single LINESTRINGs
-- 1 or more of these LINESTRINGs have been included more than once
--- remove the double LINESTRINGs to correct
---> will start at the given point: 619746.32941695023 4869530.4882389866

The error message will only show the first POINT, if there are more than
one you should look for the next.

The second error means that the ExteriorRing of the POLYGON only has 3
POINTs
- 4 are required to be Topologicaly correct
SELECT ST_NumPoints(ST_ExteriorRing(geometry))
- should return 3 in this case, but should be 4 at least

Certain functions, that use GEOS, will not bring correct results
- when Topological error exists
-- and should be corrected

Hi Mak,
thanks for your feedback. Shouldn't this be reported by ST_IsValid also?

select ST_IsValid(the_geom) from istat where ST_IsValid(the_geom) = FALSE;
 st_isvalid
------------
(0 rows)

All the best.

Hi,

I'm trying to build QGIS 2.18.3 (the latest source in release_2.18) in Windows 7 (x64) using VC++ express 2010 and I am getting the error message:

    Error C3861: 'round': Identifier not found

It happens in qgsmaprenderercustompainterjob.cpp when building qgis_core (debug).

What can I do to get rid of that error?


Regards, Casper

I don't know exactly why, but it works now.
And I added the check of qwt/matplotlib.

Hi devs,

I'm trying to run some Processing test for the QGIS provider with the

no problems with the other providers (ProcessingGdalAlgorithmsTest for

No test added to the QGIS provider and I've just pulled from the master

Any hints?

I am assuming the answer is no, but is it possible automatically to reverse
engineer a .ui from a .py file which was originally created using pyuic4?

Yes, it should.

SELECT
 ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((7 7, 77 77, 35 35,7 7))') AS bad_poly,
 ST_IsValid(ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((7 7, 77 77, 35 35,7 7))')) AS
bad_poly_valid,
 ST_IsValidDetail(ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((7 7, 77 77, 35 35,7 7))')) AS
bad_poly_geom,
 ST_IsValidReason(ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((7 7, 77 77, 35 35,7 7))')) AS
bad_poly_reason;

will report:
GEOS warning: Self-intersection at or near point 7 7
(as shown when called from spatialite in a terminal)

and as the result of ST_ValidReason: Self-intersection[7 7]

I cannot find a simple sample to reproduce the second error:
- Invalid number of points in LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or >= 4

A simple sample that produces both errors at the same time
- could possibly show if the second error possibly interferes with the first
-- causing ST_IsValid to return TRUE, which should never happen

If you could supply the offending geometry in a text file (i.e. result of
'ST_AsText(geometry)'), then this could be checked.

You have right.
The ST_MAkeVaild is capable to return a valid geometry. But it dont
remove redundant vertexs.
The redundant vertex is not always considered an Unvalidity (I guess
yes) so originally it was separated from the MakeValid function.

I guess is better if qgis do: before a removeredundants and after a makevalid.
Also pay attention to extract right type from the makevalid with the
couple forcecollection and after the extractcollection (or
collectionextract).

Regards,
A.

let me be more clear: there are NO invalid geoms in the DB, as reported
by st_isvalid. what is strange:
* invalidities are reported in qgis log (this may be due to
simplification, thanks Alvaro)
* these are reported *before* opening a project (so maybe the projects
are read to generate the preview?).
All the best.

The tolerance depends of current map scale, but you could check results in postgreSQL for different tolerances: 1 ... 10 ...100.
To avoid invalid geometry errors, but simplifying data to maintain rendering performance, you can disable in QGIS the server-side simplification of that layer to only enable the local simplification (The original features are read from postgre and simplification runs when the geometry is rendered. This does not change the original feature).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Python AddMaplayer but with low resolution
Message-ID: <1484648453562-5303695.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello, I'm new to QGIS Python develop. I was trying to add raster layer (.asc
file) into QGIS. Below are my srcrips. 

from qgis.PyQt.QtCore import *
import gdal
import os

filePath = "path/2017011003.asc"
style_layer = "path/StreamStyle.qml"

fileInfo = QFileInfo(filePath)
baseName = fileInfo.baseName()
rlayer = QgsRasterLayer(filePath, baseName)
if not rlayer.isValid():
  print "Layer failed to load!"

crs = rlayer.crs()
crs.createFromId(4610,QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.EpsgCrsId)
rlayer.setCrs(crs)

rlayer.loadNamedStyle(style_layer)
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(rlayer)

I did add the raster layer into qgis, but the problem is that the layer
seems very dim... I also import the same raster image by just using the qgis
"Add Raster Layer" function which shows quite clear
Here is the comparison:

Does anyone met same issue before? Thank you very much!

> you can disable in QGIS the server-side simplification of that layer to

The huge benefit of the feature implementing server-side simplification is
the reduction in data downloaded. Yes, we can do as you say, but we'll lose
that benefit.

It will be interesting to see if the tolerance can be changed to get rid of
the errors. If so, is there a logical pattern to the required tolerance
which QGIS can then implement to retain server-side simplification but
remove the errors?

Thanks

Tom

there is also

but it's much slower (understandably so)

Message-ID: <221b8686-5412-adec-7353-083a0a7c1afb@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a weird problem on Processing (Master fresh compiled).

Whenever I run a Processing algorithm (any provider) I get this error:

2017-01-17T21:18:50	2	Uncaught error while executing algorithm
Traceback (most recent call last):

There were errors executing the algorithm.


I any of my local configurations that cause that errors?

Thanks in advance to all

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Processing] how to handle selections
Message-ID: <87a656d5-0c5e-d4e3-1946-a0e28cf76c46@jena.de>

Hi all,
processing sports the "Save selected features" algorithm. However if in 
processing's options you untick "Use only selected features" the 
algorithm outputs _all_ features of the input layer. Although I know 
that processing works only on selections when the option is ticked IMHO 
the current behaviour is not intuitive: if an algorithm in its name (and 
help) claims to do something with the selected features it should do 
that _all the time_.
Opinions?

Background: I opened a PR [1] yesterday for an algorithm that works on 
selected features all the time (won't make sense otherwise) and would 
like processing to be consistent in that respect.

regards

Bernhard

Hi
Thanks Matthias.

Any advices to cloned repo to have their build time also extended? All
branches in my QGIS repo fail due to timeout: thus, not possible to check
if the commits are clean before the pull request creation.

Thanks,
Harrissou

Hi all,
I see that in QGIS 3 the function (Layer Properties > Labels) "Show all
labels etc." is present both in the "Rendering" tab and in the
"Automatic placement settings" (top right). Apparently this is a
duplication, better get rid of it?
Thanks.

Hi,

I just installed SAGA version 2.3.1 and there are lots of io_gdal issues 
- basically with all raster operations (in combination with QGIS master 
2 (2.18)).

Seems like there are closed bugs on this very same issue (closed as 
being irrelevant) - f.e. https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13279 - opposing to 
what the ticket says, SAGA 2.3. doesn't work fine with QGIS.

What version of SAGA is known to work fine with QGIS processing?

Thanks for your help!

Andreas

Hi,

The error I get is:

io_gdal 0 -TRANSFORM 1 -INTERPOL 0 -GRIDS 
"/tmp/processing7506c8fe191843708dbabb1ef3e015bc/2d0dfc6865944d63b13d24be8ecd081b/dom69602440.sgrd" 
-FILES "/home/an/kurse/qgis/daten_uster/dom_6960_2440.tif"


Unknown option 'INTERPOL'


Apparently, INTERPOL was replaced by parameter RESAMPLING in newer SAGA 
versions.

Anyone knows how I can get a working SAGA installation that plays nicely 
with QGIS? or a Processing that plays nicely with newer SAGA versions?

Thanks,
Andreas

There is already a ticket about it:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14735

We probably need to have a (public) repository (?) with downloadable
saga algorithm providers?
SAGA changes switches faster than they release versions ;)

regards
Werner

this is a long standing issue. IMHO the reasonable choice is to support
the SAGA LTR, and convince packagers for various OSs this is the one to
package.
I'm interested on this, available for help.
All the best.

me too.. available for testing and/or general helping.

Sometimes running SAGA algorithms after an upgrade means having faith ;)

Hi,

I would like to know if there is plans for replacing Q_FOREACH (use discouraged from QT 5.7) with C++11 range based loop in QGIS code and if it is appropriate to start the move in new PR ?

Good catch

I fixed it and now it uses the selected features, regardless of the
config parameter. The change is in 2.18 and master branches

Hi Victor,

what do you think about enhancing processing's vector.features with an 
additional optional flag that returns the selection no matter if the 
option is set or not?

hmm, not a bad idea, but it is actually very easy to do that using
standard QGIS methods (you can see how simple the fix i made is). The
advantage of vector.features is that it honors the option setting,
without the developer having to take care of that.

Cheers

of course, I see. I was under the impression that apart from honoring 
the option by using the method you would not run into problems if the 
api changes.

Message-ID: <CAPHDReKzCjMakmtR+7dVq9cWHJnk4zCfTg2+tE7sU07QKfB4Vg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear developers,
i have a naive question.

Would it be possible and meaningful to implement the QGIS Server in Python?

There are several nice Python Web-frameworks (Django, Flask) which would
make it easy to expose the rendering, data management and processing
functionality of QGIS as WMS, WFS or REST service.

Do you think this may be a good idea to implement?

Thanks and best regards
Soeren

Hi,

The server is actually under heavy refactoring: the new version - planned with Qgis 3 - enables you to embed the server in any  framework (python or C++) by using abstract request/response objects that links all I/O between server and your embedding frameworks. Examples will follow soon.

David.

Hi all, 

playing with my experimental Z styles I noticed strange rendering issues
with vertices not being rendered at the right place. 
See short screen cast here  https://youtu.be/NdoyysCzEUs
<https://youtu.be/NdoyysCzEUs>    

I'm filing that in 
Does that look like a bug underneath in QGIS or an error in my expressions ?

Cheers
Régis

You can do that right now:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/qgis_wrapped_server.py

But after the refactoring that we are doing it will be even simpler.

There is also a WPS plugin for QGIS server.

Message-ID: <ca2c9e85-f602-1bc9-f76c-9054aa9c51ff@di.uminho.pt>

Hi devs,

This discussion addresses a minor UI issue in the Convex hull dialog
(under Vector → Geoprocessing tools).

The Convex hull dialog [1] has two independent options, which are:
Field, to create convex hulls by classes
Method: to create a single convex hull or convex hulls by classes

Current issues:

1) If the user selects a field in the first combobox, to create convex
hulls by classes, but leaves the second combobox with the default option
"Create single minimum convex hull", the convex hull is not done by
classes, but for all geometries. Probably it is not what the user wants.

2) If the user does not select a field in the first combobox, but
selects the method "Create convex hulls based on field", the operation
tries to do something, but fails with: "float division by zero".
Obviously this does not make sense, but it is allowed by the interface.

My proposal is to enhance this dialog, to provide a better user
experience with these two related options.

I see two possible alternatives:

a)
* The order of these two fields changes.
* First the user has to select the method.
* The field combobox only gets enabled if the method is "Create convex
hulls based on field" is selected in the Method combobox.
* When the user changes the method back to "Create single minimum convex
hull", the Field combobox is disabled.

b)
* We drop the Method combobox at all,
* We use just one dropbox to select a field
* If no field is selected, the method is "Create single minimum convex
hull".
* If a field is selected, the method is "Create convex hulls based on
field".

I can make a PR to improve this, but I would like to discuss what is the
best approach here.

Regards,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python bindings for "QgsMapToolCapture"
Message-ID: <3bed27af-09e4-d4c8-5f98-033280a45194@gmail.com>

To the QGIS developers (and not a newbie QGIS plugin developer like me) -

Is there a QGIS python binding for class "QgsMapToolCapture". Or do I 
have to recreate the various point, line and polygon capture tools ?

My goal is to have 3 tools (point, line and polygon capture) available 
though a QGIS plugin and show the capture -  result in the canvas using  
QgsRubberBand. I can't find any documentations for the python bindings 
for QgsMapToolCapture and I guess that they doesn't exist.

I refuse to believe I'm the only one having this problem - So:

  * Does the python bindings exist or not ?
  * If the first answer are "not": Is there some QGIS / qt / python
    based replacement for "QgsMapToolCapture" ??

Regards

Bo Victor Thomsen

Hi Bo,

2.18.2 here:

from qgis.gui import QgsMapToolCapture
tool = QgsMapToolCapture()

Hint: You probably want to subclass QgsMapToolCapture

Hi guys,

this issue is still there, I'm not able to run ProcessingQgis tests

I also tried to comment the last tests uploaded (that some days ago run
without problem) but it does not solve the problem.

Any hints?

Thanks again

Hi dev,

I'm facing a strange issue in GetPrint. The SELECTION is not apply to 
the MapComposer.
The code is quite old: 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blame/release-2_14/src/server/qgswmsserver.cpp#L1273
And there is no test to verify it.

Do someone know how selection is apply to MapComposer ?

It is supposed to work. Do you reproduce that with a specific WFS endpoint 
(in which case which one?) or with all endpoints ?

Hi David,

Thanks for bringing this up. After reading the referenced KDAB article (and
especially the not-so-happy comments about this deprecation), I looked at
the code base.

Instances of Q_FOREACH in QGIS 2.99 (master): 2023

Why can't Qt just leave the macro in and recommend using a better C++11
construct for devs wishing better performance? (rhetorical question)

I guess the macro can be added to a QGIS header file while devs spend their
time endlessly figuring out how to do a port "for each" Q_FOREACH.

I, for one, find this a bit annoying on Qt's part, but still understand the
reasoning for it.

Hi devs,
I was looking for the possibility of iterating a clipping by field process but I saw that the only option is to use a script from the online collection (Cut by field).
On the web some old workarounds are proposed, but they mostly make use of direct programming or are related to arcgis (1<http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/66755/clip-polygons-with-other-polygons-based-on-matching-attributes>,2<http://www.northrivergeographic.com/archives/model-builder-and-iterators>).

What’s the idea behind making an alg become a core one? Due to teh fact that no other provider offers this functionality, could it be an idea to include that script among the core geoalgs avoiding the risk of losing it with some API breakage?

All the best,

Nic

Hi Even,
I tested again with a fast and stable connection, and it works as it
should. The context where i noticed the issue was possibly a corner
case, with a very slow connection (which BTW is where the Interrupt
would be most useful).
I'll see if I can replicate it more reliably.
Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Getting data from another layer during digitizing
Message-ID: <97916412-9280-7b58-b31b-b0810af79e60@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I have an interesting problem: I need to get, when digitizing a line,
some data from the closest line where the digitized line is snapped to.
Of course with a database this can be solved with a trigger, but in this
case I have to do it on shp (and it's an interesting exercise anyway).
I thought of using the default value for the field, getting it from an
expression finding the closest feature and getting the desired data from
it. This does not seem very easy to do, and I wonder if there is a
simpler method.
Thanks for any hint.
All the best.

Hi all,
I am clipping lines with polygons, and I found issues:
* QGIS alg does not cut the line at the change of the polygon
* GDAL alg does not produce an output
* GRASS v.overlay works fine.
Does anybody confirm?
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Selection color in Composition
Message-ID: <57b31890-0377-4055-5ae6-d112acbaccc2@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

How the selection color is set in composition ?

I found a regression in QGIS Server about selection in GetPrint request. 
I'd like to fix it but I don't know which commit has generated this 
regression. It is the reason of my question.

Regars,
René-Luc

Confirmed also for 2.14. It must have to do with layer validity, as I get:

GDAL command output:
ERROR 1: TopologyException: Input geom 1 is invalid: Self-intersection
at or near point 1591718.5859374921 4869828.5859374423 at
1591718.5859374921 4869828.5859374423
...

So, still the same old issue for gdal; what is strange is the behaviour
of QGIS.

All the best.

It's not - compositions never show the selection.

I suspect it was this 3 year old commit which broke the server
behaviour: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/aaa7003 . This was done
to prevent accidental selections showing in exports from composer. My
guess is that this broke the selection behaviour in composer, but
given that there was no unit test and no-one has noticed it until now
I'm guessing this feature is not used often on server! (I didn't even
know it was something server supported)

How is this supposed to work on server? Is the selection color
configurable? Does it affect all maps in a composition or do you
specify which map to show a selection in?

You'll probably need to do something like:

- add a Flag enum to QgsComposition, with a ShowSelection option
- Q_DECLARE_FLAGS this to a QgsComposition::Flags type
- Add a flags()/setFlags() option to composition so that server can
set the ShowSelection flag
- Make QgsComposerMap::mapSettings check the associated compositions
flags to determine whether the selection should be shown
- (If selection color is configurable) add a getter/setter to
QgsComposition to set the selection color

Has anyone a QGIS toolchain for using g++ and Qt5.7 or Qt5.8 with 
Eclipse Oxygen - that they are willing to share?

The documentation indicates how to build with CMake but does not 
indicate the preferred way to develop and/or test code.

Is Qt Creator the preferred IDE?  Or can it be done with Eclipse?
What is the preferred test environment?

Any pointers would be appreciated.

I suggest you to use Qt Creator if you can. AFAIK it's the easier way to
develop and build QGIS. You will also have the benefit to design the UI
components visually, being Qt (Gui) stuff.

The docs provide some guidelines to setup Qt Creator:
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/qgisdevelopersguide/qtcreator.html

All the best,
Giovanni

Hi,
I wonder if someone could add the "About" section in the plugin approval
notifications so that we can just have a quick look on what a plugin
actually does without having to explore the repository?
That would help a lot since plugin naming is most of the time not helpful
at all.
Cheers

I tried to do this myself, but couldn't find my way round the repo code (not
a Django person). +1 for this, together with a link to the repo.

No,but this plugin need a special shapefile and some more conditions.

Anyway I will publish it in my github with an explanation of its operation.

Hi all,
GRASS in Processing essentially unusable here:

I think this is a bug fixed years ago, how could it have been reemerged?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problem with ON INSERT TO ... DO INSTEAD postgres
	rules
Message-ID: <CAM_TN39z9dn0agfSOjWGC4BdfQDg5zNU9jxZnfaVAqpfe0ijSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,

after a short disscussion in qgis user list I've opened this ticket [0],
because starting from QGIS 2.16 I can't insert new feature in postgres
views using rules. When I try to insert a new feature I have this error
[1]. All works fine with QGIS 2.14. The problem happens only with INSERT
rules. UPDATE and DELETE are ok.

I saw that for simple rules I can add a RETURNING * clause and all works
fine, but I have a lot of complex view that use many tables, so RETURNING *
clause doesn't work and compose the clause it's really hard.

Then I have some question:
1) Is it really an issue or the problem is due to a new functionality of
QGIS ?
2) In the first case, it could be considered a regression for it works on
QGIS 2.14 ?
3) Is there a simple way to modify my views by adding a RETURNING clause
without specify all returning field (* doesn't work) ?

I love to know if it's a deliberate change or it's just a bug,so I can
choose if I have to modify all my views, in order to allow me to migrate to
QGIS 2.18.

Many thanks in advance
Regards
Luca

this is a problem that have been recently discussed quite a lot
(again) in and out the official channels.

See for example:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3865#issuecomment-267016050

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3865#issuecomment-267039499

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3865#issuecomment-267042049


to resume... native qgis tools (or even ogr based ones for that
matter) do not have yet any mechanism/option to fix geometries
while/before doing a geoprocessing operation (I'm talking in the
context of Processing here). To consider that

a) working with garbage produced by others is frequently not an option
b) fixing the most common geometry issues should be easy (the geometry
checker is good, but does not work in Processing and is quite complex
for the vast majority of users)

the solution is of course available, liblwgeom or
https://git.osgeo.org/gogs/rttopo/librttopo seems the thing to use, in
fact when using st_makevalid (in PostGIS or the liblwgeom plugin for
Processing) the vast majority of geometry issues that make qgis tools
choke are easily and quickly fixed.

would qgis/spatialite been compiled with liblwgeom support (which I
don't think is the case on all major supported platforms) I would have
already added a "fix geometries" option in the ogr based tools (that
among the other things are magnitude faster than the native qgis ones)
adding also the most common operations involving more than 1 input.

this happens also with error free data.
I'm investigating.
thanks for the feedback.
All the best.

Hi Luca,

this was a deliberate change to allow QGIS to directly use the newly
inserted features (e.g. add child records to a newly created feature).

To make the views compatible with this, all you need to do is add a

    RETURN NEW;

to the end of the insert function (I think). Have a look at the views
which I linked in my response in the other thread.

We could possibly add a flag to specify in which cases we need the new
primary key and in which cases not.
But I somehow suspect, that in the end we will need to specify this in
some often-used code (e.g. add feature form) and in the end one will
still be required to update all views and we have some half-baked
pointless workaround code inside QGIS.

Hope that helps for you!
Matthias

Hi Matthias,

thanks for your answer. Sorry but I missed your previous mail.
Now I've seen that in your example you used TRIGGERS to update your data,
instead in my case I use view RULES.
I try to add "RETURNING new" clause in the rules but it doesn't work.

I can try to change all my code and substitute RULES with TRIGGERS but I
still hope there is another way to maintain the possibility of using rules.
Is It possible that I'm just missing a simply solution because I don't know
well the using of RETURNING in postgres views?

thanks
Luca

Cannot replicate that,

I resolve the problem by adding the RETURNING clause in the INSERT RULES
fololwed by all single field name and with a dummy value where I can't
returning the real value, eg:

REATE OR REPLACE RULE insert_generalita AS
    ON INSERT TO sifrap.v_frane_pol_full DO INSTEAD  INSERT INTO
sifrap.iffi_pol (idfrana, tipopol, the_geom)
  VALUES (new.idfrana, new.tipopol, st_multi(new.the_geom))
  RETURNING
    iffi_pol.gid,
    iffi_pol.idfrana,
    ''::text AS idesteso,
    1::smallint tipopol,
''::CHARACTER VARYING tipo_poligono,
1::smallint tipo,
[...].

It seem all works fine.
Thanks for the tips !

Hi Giovanni.
Please find it here:
http://www.faunalia.eu/~paolo/test_clip.tar.xz
There are two polygons and one line, with the result of the clip with
qgis and gdal algs.
All the best, and thanks.

Dear all, 


I have some difficulties to figure out how to split line at specific distance from the beginning. 
I need to split a single line into several lines at specific distances. 


I'm able to get the point at specific distance using the intersection function of QgsGeometry but I'm in trouble on how to create the new geometry. 
I looked at the split function but I'm not sure it could help me. 


Do you have some code to share on how to split a line into several lines at specified distances? 


Thanks 
Pierluigi

doing this operation the postgis/spatialite way is tricky because the
st_split function won't work if you don't have a node/vertex where you
need do the split. See for example this workflow

https://mygisnotes.wordpress.com/2017/01/01/split-lines-with-points-the-postgis-way/

I had to use it (does not means that is the best way) to solve a
specific problem here. I used PostGIS because in QGIS/Processing do
not seems there is yet any tool (not even in external providers? I
maybe wrong, I just could not find any) that allow do this operation.

cheers!

it seems you hit a corner case.
The qgis tool returns the right result, while the ogr based clip gives
that topology error (ERROR 1: TopologyException: Input geom 1 is
invalid: Self-intersection at or near point 1629973.9531249425
4886529.3203125177 at 1629973.9531249425 4886529.3203125177)

the curios thing is that
a) not even st_isvalid returns anything wrong (so cleaning with
st_makevalid does not make any difference)
b) the qgis geometry checker does not find any auto-intesection, but
finds slivers. Trying to fix them results in an error and the output
gets only one of the two polygons.

bottom line, the qgis and ogr based tools do work fine, when
geometries are ok, and here we return to the other day email about how
we can improve the checking/fixing geometries in processing. The
problem here described seems really something very odd, that I cannot
investigate more now.

Hi Luigi,
I don't think it's a regression but an incomplete fix, the qgis code still
imports SLD
assigning mm as units, while in SLD everything is in pixels unless
otherwise stated.
This needs to be fixed in all SLD import procedures (large-ish change).

Before QGIS was wrongly exporting and wrongly importing, however the two
errors were canceling each other out ;-)

Cheers
Andrea

Ha ok, now it's clear

I'll downgrade the issue to simple bug.

BTW this suggest that any export fix would check also import side to
maintain QGIS consistency.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Building a pdf version of QGIS documentation
Message-ID: <CAECJsSrYndiEMuO1oLtnVr7D42JQTYoP2AT15seSvfKHy65q-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to build a pdf version of QGIS Testing doc, following the readme
at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation. I'm on Ubuntu Xenial.

The "make LANG=en pdf" command ends with :

build succeeded, 3 warnings.
# Compile the pdf docs for that locale
# we use texi2pdf since latexpdf target is not available via
# sphinx-build which we need to use since we need to pass language flag
mkdir -p output/pdf/en
# need to build 3x to have proper toc and index
# currently texi2pdf has bad exit status. Please ignore errors!!
# prepending the texi2pdf command with - keeps make going instead of
quitting
# japanese pdf has problems, when build with texi2pdf
# as alternative we can use platex
# for russian pdf you need package 'texlive-lang-cyrillic' installed
# for japanese pdf you need: 'cmap-adobe-japan1 cmap-adobe-japan2
latex-cjk-all nkf okumura-clsfiles ptex-base ptex-bin texlive-fonts-extra'
/usr/bin/texi2dvi: pdflatex exited with bad status, quitting.
/usr/bin/texi2dvi: pdflatex exited with bad status, quitting.
/usr/bin/texi2dvi: pdflatex exited with bad status, quitting.

UserGuide.pdf
mv: cannot stat 'output/latex/en/QGISUserGuide.pdf': No such file or
directory
Makefile:97 : la recette pour la cible « pdf » a échoué
make: *** [pdf] Erreur 1

I manually added a fake QGISUserGuide.pdf file in output/latex/en/ but it
still failed with the same message.
What am I missing? Any help will be welcome.

Thanks,
Harrissou

Yep... sorry I was not aware that the geoserver plugin was doing
round-tripping of styles,
never used it seriously and noticed the possibility to round trips styles
only a couple
of weeks ago

I notice that FGDB writing support seems to have been dropped from QGIS. It
was in 2.14, but not in 2.16 nor 2.18. What happened? Can it be included
back into QGIS?

Hi!

Seems like you have errors in building so the pdf gets not created.
There should be a logfile somewhere where you can look for the error
(I guess probably a missing package or misformated rst).

seems like texi2dvi has some problems ..
Maybe you can "dryrun" the texi2dvi command line and look for the error ..

regards
Werner

Hi,

Maybe we can add support for uom (units of measure), like in [1], in the
export and import to/from SLD. I think we could archive better
compatibility if we use real world units. The uom attribute is
necessary. Numbers only have meaning when they also have units. I would
like to try this approach.

The qgis-geoserver-plugin uses a fixed SIZE_FACTOR = 4 to convert units
from QGIS (mm) to Geoserver (pixels).

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

[1] http://geoserver.geo-solutions.it/edu/en/pretty_maps/style_uom.html

I think we should review all this import export

This is, in fact, a long awaited feature. It is/was present in the Sextante
version used by gvSIG:

"""
Split lines with points layer

Description
  Parameters
   - Capa_de_lineas[Vector layer - Line]:
   - Points layer[Vector layer - Point]:
   - Tolerance[Numerical value]:
   - Method[Selection]:

  Outputs
   - Split lines[Vector layer - Line]:

Command line
Usage: runalg( "splitlineswithpoints",
                LINES[Vector Layer],
                POINTS[Vector Layer],
                TOLERANCE[Numerical Value],
                METHOD[Selection],
                RESULT[output vector layer],
              );
"""

but was never ported to QGIS Processing.

Is has, at least, two feature requests for that:
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/5040
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/9469

Giovanni, maybe you can update your feature request for a future version,
raising the priority.

Thanks!

Pedro Venâncio

The fact is that in the qgssymbollay[v2]utils.cpp there are already
all encode/decode UOM stuffs since 2012 (by G.Sucameli), but these
static routines seems not used in any part of qgis code. I'm still
investigating...

Hi all,

I noticed that there are not the gdal commands output in the Processing

Someone can see them?

Message-ID: <441ce7a6-fbe4-8aa3-263c-113bbc309674@faunalia.it>

Hi all,

I have to give a short talk on the current status of QGIS3 and the
outlook for the future. The main aim is to grow interest, and ultimately
attract testers, developers, and sponsors.
Topics I thought of are:

* current development state
* what's new for the user
* what's new for the developer
* what's the most likely roadmap and timing
* what to do about plugins (when starting to upgrade, how to do it).

I thought to dig through commits and QEPs, but it' a big amount of work,
and from this fine graded scale it's very difficult to get the whole
picture, not to say about outlooks.
I think this is of relevance to this list, as it could be a good chance
to have a clear picture to communicate to users. I'd be glad of doing
this as a cooperative effort, so this could be used to communicate it
worldwide.
I'd therefore be grateful of any suggestion.

Thanks for any hint.

Hi Paolo, Hi all,

We just had the annual Swiss QGIS user group meeting yesterday. 
Obviously we had to tell our users a little bit about what is already 
finished, what is currently being worked on and what still has to be 
worked on. So I had to compile a list:

What is already done:

  * Migration to qt5 and Python 3
  * Python plugin update helper 2 to 3
  * Inheritable flexible properties framework (QEP 22)
  * Inbuilt task manager in QGIS for long running background tasks

What is currently being worked on:

  * QGIS 3 Windows packages (Jürgen)
  * Layer registry and legend tree refactoring (Martin) (QEP 76)
  * QGIS Server refactoring (devs from 3Liz, Alessandro,
    Oslandia/Camptocamp?) (QEP 74)
  * Multiple canvas within a single project (Alvarao and Nyall) (QEP 70)
  * Application Profiles and Unified Settings (Nathan) (QEP 50)
  * Generic Helping System for QGIS (Richard) (QEP 32)
  * Improved Node Tool (Martin) (QEP 69)

What still needs to be worked on:

  * Print composer refactoring (QEP 23) (Nyall)
  * Reporting mode for print composer (Nyall)
  * Porting core of Processing to C++ (Nyall)
  * Redesign of GUI of fields/widgets/forms (QEP 21) (Matthias)
  * Improving the loading/display performance for complex forms with
    lots of relations (Matthias)
  * Rename compositions to layouts (QEP 25) (Nyall)
  * Project backup and versioning (Nathan)
  * More unit tests (QEP 17, QEP 24) (all devs)
  * Documentation of API changes (all devs)
  * Finishing registration of QGIS legal entity, logo, etc. (QGIS board
    and PSC)
  * Visual changelog (all)

I probably missed a lot of stuff in the above lists, and it is my own 
point of view, but it may help for a dicussion around the current state 
of QGIS 3.

 From the above list it is obvious that we can't feature-freeze soon 
(with a single three-month dev cycle) and that we need the double dev 
cycle we already discussed. One realistic feature freeze time could be 
somewhere in May, and a possible release date could be around July. But 
obviously it is Jürgen who decides. He may have different ideas.

Some good news:

The Swiss QGIS user group decided yesterday to fund a few of the above 
"what still needs to be worked on" list:

  * Print composer refactoring (Nyall)
  * Porting core of Processing to C++ (Nyall)
  * Redesign of GUI of fields/widgets/forms (Matthias)
  * Improving the loading/display performance for complex forms with
    lots of relations (Matthias)

Further print composer work and work on the new reporting mode still 
needs funding. Probably also processing work could use some love and 
funding, esp. once the porting of Processing core to C++ is finished.

Hope all of this helps a bit to get a picture where we are. Please help 
complement the picture!

Finally, I propose that we very soon do another round of QGIS grants. We 
are doing quite well financially (the call for funding helped) and can 
now afford to spend another 20k € on more grant projects.

FileGDB write support is provided by the GDAL/OGR FileGDB driver, which
requires the FileGDB API SDK [0] (that happens to now be under the Apache 2
license [1]), not QGIS itself. When installing QGIS via the OSGeo4W
installer, you also have to install the gdal-filegdb package, which is a
plugin for GDAL/OGR that provides this write functionality; though, I am
not sure which version of the SDK is currently included.

In other words, the support was not dropped from QGIS, per se, but maybe
just not included as a dependent package for GDAL/OGR, given its further
proprietary library dependency. Upon looking at the 2.14 OSGeo4W 'full'
packaging [2], I don't see that it is included, by default, there as well
(at least, not anymore).

There is also the read-only OpenFileGDB driver [3], included in GDAL/OGR
1.11+. While this does not allow writing, it can be used to dump data into
a PostGIS setup (see page).

This is quite an incomplete list ;)

for a better (albeit somewhat raw) list!

Obviously I missed a lot. I apologize. I was trying to be brief and
concentrate on the very essential work necessary for QGIS 3. Every
version obviously has plenty and numerous improvements, regardless if it
is a major version change or not. Thanks a lot to all of the very active
devs!

Just to clarify - I wasn't offended. I'm just very aware that there's
a lot of "lurkers" on this list who could misinterpret your email and
think that there's only been those changes so far. Next thing we know
it's being shared on Twitter!

Thanks a lot Nyall, Andreas. This small incident IMHO highlights the
need for more communication to users, so our exercise may be useful.
Andreas, do you have slides to share?
Of course I'll also share mine.
All the best.

Hi,
Well, things are going so fast that even for developpers, it's hard to
start a work not already being worked on somewhere else.

Can I ask for all devs to use the WIP (Work in Progress) label in
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api issues?

We in fact started to work on issues that became Pull Request the day
after. No harm up to now, that became a good opportunity for code review
that time.

Many thanks

Cheers
Régis

looking at this, I see we have a number of obsolete repos hanging
around. For the sake of clarity, wouldn't it be better to get rid of them?

Hi Paolo, 

Here are the slides from our annual meeting:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d1ott7W5agb2vvUB8xSfv7x6gE843H-JLw4_OWqyTmc/edit?usp=sharing


However, only a small nr of slides on QGIS 3 itself. 

Feel free to re-use, if you need something.

Thanks a lot Nyall, Andreas. This small incident IMHO highlights the
need for more communication to users, so our exercise may be useful.
Andreas, do you have slides to share?
Of course I'll also share mine.
All the best.

Hi Andreas,
thanks for sharing, this is very valuable to other user groups and QGIS
community!

Just a question, up to now, sponsoring could not be oriented and I see that
gold sponsor is dedicacted to bugfixing and QA. Did we change our policy?
If yes, that needs to be wide spread, we might gain some sponsors !

Hi all,
Not easy to summarize all the work committed in QGIS3. Using QEP sounds
like the most practical way imho though a lot of work is being done out of
QEP processes.
I'd add to the "work done" list the move of Gdal Raster menu items to
processing and removal of some c++ plugins.

In the work being done, I'd cite standardization/polishing of ui.

In the "need to be worked" list, there's one item I feel bad to not see:
writing documentation. As far as I can say, not only API doc interest users
(actually it interest only those with dev skills), the User Manual is (and
depending on the user profile, the Cookbook or Training manual are) also of
interest.
If we, who are involved in QGIS development, do not consider documentation
as part of development cycle and mention/claim that there's a work to do
there, I'm afraid that QGIS 3.6 is released when we are still documenting
3.0 features.

my2cts,
Harrissou

Hi Paolo, Hi all,

We just had the annual Swiss QGIS user group meeting yesterday. Obviously
we had to tell our users a little bit about what is already finished, what
is currently being worked on and what still has to be worked on. So I had
to compile a list:

What is already done:

Migration to qt5 and Python 3
Python plugin update helper 2 to 3
Inheritable flexible properties framework (QEP 22)
Inbuilt task manager in QGIS for long running background tasks

What is currently being worked on:

QGIS 3 Windows packages (Jürgen)
Layer registry and legend tree refactoring (Martin) (QEP 76)
QGIS Server refactoring (devs from 3Liz, Alessandro, Oslandia/Camptocamp?)
(QEP 74)
Multiple canvas within a single project (Alvarao and Nyall) (QEP 70)
Application Profiles and Unified Settings (Nathan) (QEP 50)
Generic Helping System for QGIS (Richard) (QEP 32)
Improved Node Tool (Martin) (QEP 69)

What still needs to be worked on:

Print composer refactoring (QEP 23) (Nyall)
Reporting mode for print composer (Nyall)
Porting core of Processing to C++ (Nyall)
Redesign of GUI of fields/widgets/forms (QEP 21) (Matthias)
Improving the loading/display performance for complex forms with lots of
relations (Matthias)
Rename compositions to layouts (QEP 25) (Nyall)
Project backup and versioning (Nathan)
More unit tests (QEP 17, QEP 24) (all devs)
Documentation of API changes (all devs)
Finishing registration of QGIS legal entity, logo, etc. (QGIS board and PSC)
Visual changelog (all)

I probably missed a lot of stuff in the above lists, and it is my own point
of view, but it may help for a dicussion around the current state of QGIS 3.

>From the above list it is obvious that we can't feature-freeze soon (with a
single three-month dev cycle) and that we need the double dev cycle we
already discussed. One realistic feature freeze time could be somewhere in
May, and a possible release date could be around July. But obviously it is
Jürgen who decides. He may have different ideas.

Some good news:

The Swiss QGIS user group decided yesterday to fund a few of the above
"what still needs to be worked on" list:

Print composer refactoring (Nyall)
Porting core of Processing to C++ (Nyall)
Redesign of GUI of fields/widgets/forms (Matthias)
Improving the loading/display performance for complex forms with lots of
relations (Matthias)

Further print composer work and work on the new reporting mode still needs
funding. Probably also processing work could use some love and funding,
esp. once the porting of Processing core to C++ is finished.

Hope all of this helps a bit to get a picture where we are. Please help
complement the picture!

Finally, I propose that we very soon do another round of QGIS grants. We
are doing quite well financially (the call for funding helped) and can now
afford to spend another 20k € on more grant projects.

Andreas

Hi all,

I have to give a short talk on the current status of QGIS3 and the
outlook for the future. The main aim is to grow interest, and ultimately
attract testers, developers, and sponsors.
Topics I thought of are:

* current development state
* what's new for the user
* what's new for the developer
* what's the most likely roadmap and timing
* what to do about plugins (when starting to upgrade, how to do it).

I thought to dig through commits and QEPs, but it' a big amount of work,
and from this fine graded scale it's very difficult to get the whole
picture, not to say about outlooks.
I think this is of relevance to this list, as it could be a good chance
to have a clear picture to communicate to users. I'd be glad of doing
this as a cooperative effort, so this could be used to communicate it
worldwide.
I'd therefore be grateful of any suggestion.

Thanks for any hint.

Hi Régis, 

No, we did not change our policy regarding earmarked sponsoring. 

However, looking at our expenses, bug fixing is the biggest item
(usually around 2/3 of the expenses). So you can easily claim that
someones sponsorship covers that ;-) In reality, of course, everything
goes into the pool. 

I also wrote "primarily" - that does not exclude that the money is also
used for other purposes. 

It was my argument to "sell" the sponsorship to our users.

Thanks a lot Nyall, Andreas. This small incident IMHO highlights the
need for more communication to users, so our exercise may be useful.
Andreas, do you have slides to share?
Of course I'll also share mine.
All the best.

Good to know ! I probably could have sold that to my previous employer that
way. So displaying a diagram explaining the average proportion of fund
destinations on the sponsoring page could be great. Could be something like
that "sponsoring funds generally go to:
(fake values) 60% bug fixing and infrastructure for quality, 20 % to
developper meeting, 10% for documentation..."

Cheers!

Hi Regis, 

Yes - we already publish our financials. Although in textual form: 

see
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/finance/index.html 

I will perhaps cross-reference the financial reports on the page
explaining the sponsorship. Makes sense. 

The report for 2016 will soon be published. If you are interested, you
can find it already on Google Docs:  

Financial report 2016:

I think is really important SLD compatibility work (crowdfunding) by
GeoSolution... QGIS->SLD/SE 1.1
In this moment SLD read back is not correctly done by QGIS, e.g.
SLD/SE1.1->QGIS but almost few people are working on this without a
structured road map (I should say that is not an attractive task)

IMHO interoperability would be the way to distinguish QGIS and GFOSS
from the proprietary lock-in philosophy

cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server - SSL handshake failed for cascading
	WMS
Message-ID: <ff01a1b823d77b1a77abfe48add87412@carto.net>

Hi, 

I want to use a cascading WMS in QGIS server. I know it is not ideal,
perfomance wise, but it would be only for printing. 

Problem is that the WMS uses https and QGIS server can't connect. The
QGIS server log shows a connect error: 

Download of capabilities failed: SSL handshake failed 

curl or wget on the same server works fine with the same ssl connection.


Anyone knows how I can overcome this SSL handshake issue? Do I need to
set up a separate certificat chain for QGIS server? I hope not ... 

Thanks for any hints, 

Andreas

Some more information on my server: 

Linux CentOS7 

qt 4.8.5 

The server only allows tls connections, no SSLv2/3 or such vulnerable
stuff. Perhaps qt is too old to properly support tls ciphers? 

Can I add an SSL "do not check exception" for specific connections of
QGIS server? 

If yes - how would I configure that for QGIS server? 

Thanks for any hints,

Hi,

QGIS is cutting edge when it comes to data interoperability. It consumes
all kinds of data. It is amazing!

But when it comes to style interoperability, it is not so good. I know
there are a lot of different style languages and libraries, and they
keep changing. Urh!

This SLD compatibility enhancement might be one more nice label for QGIS
3.0. I support this idea and I'm available to help to archive this
compatibility. It mighty be not so sexy, but it is a key feature. I know
people still using great uDig just to save the style as SLD.

Regards,

Network management of QGIS Server is definetely week. We alse faced this
issue and I thought to bypass it setting a proxy... but it isn't possibile
to set a proxy for QGIS Server to use (as you can do in QGIS).
So neither SSL nor a proxy can be configured. I suggest to add this to the
ongoing server refactoring...

> Qt 4.8 can definitely use TLS, and can be configured (in a SSL Server
configuration) to connect to the WMS endpoint how you feel is appropriate,
including ignoring specific SSL errors. This assumes you are cascading by
configuring a QGIS project with a WMS layer and then, in turn, serving
again via WMS through QGIS Server. If so, you should be able to use the
authentication system to solve the connection issues. However, you will
need to have the authentication database available to QGIS Server as well,
via env variable, because the SSL Server configurations are stored in it.

Recently (last week), I noticed a possible bug in the auth system whereby
the SSL endpoint connected to will throw an SSL error when the endpoint has
intermediate certificates that are not stored in QGIS's Authorities tab.
Usually, validation would not check for trust of intermediates, only
whether a given cert in the chain is valid for the particular use and the
eventual trustworthiness of its root Certificate Authority. Essentially,
any intermediates need to be trusted as roots CAs until this is fixed.

In this case, for a workaround, you will need to either add the
intermediate certificates to OpenSSL's referenced trusted roots
file/directory, or add them to your Authorities tab in QGIS (which adds
them to the authentication database as trusted, by default) then ensure the
auth database can be used by QGIS Server for the project.

I would need to know more about your particular SSL setup to give any
further suggestions here. Unfortunately, "SSL handshake failed" is a too
vague, and I am only guessing at the problem above.

Hi all,

I don't know if a miss some older discussion on this topic but I'm not
able to load SpatiaLite databases in QGIS 3.

It seems there there is no pyspatialite for python3:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"/home/matteo/lavori/QGIS/build-qgis3/output/python/qgis/utils.py", line
598, in spatialite_connect
    from pyspatialite import dbapi2
  File

647, in _import
    mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)
ImportError: No module named 'pyspatialite'


I checked around on the web and I found an issue the github repo [0]

Has anyone a working SpatiaLite db on QGIS?

Thanks to all

Matteo

I compiled a fresh QGIS master on a virtual machine with ubuntu xenial,
so the machine is super clean (nothing else than the QGIS building
requirements installed)

I still cannot run local ctest for ProcessingQGIS, the terminal just
remains at this line:

4: -- Running /usr/bin/python3
/home/matteo/lavori/QGIS/QGIS/python/plugins/processing/tests/QgisAlgorithmsTest.py

4: Running from build directory!

4: - output directory of the build:
/home/matteo/lavori/QGIS/build-qgis3/output
4: !!! prefix path was requested, but it is not valid - we do not run
from installed path !!!



as Matthias suggested I also ran the test with gdb [0] to see where the
code gets stuck and it seems that there is a segmentation fault. Here
the pastebin [1] of the complete output.

gdb ends:

Thread 1 "python3" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

PySpatialite is a totally obsoleted python package: you must explicitely load the mod_spatialite extension using the spatialite load_extension(..).

Qgis use its own version of pyspatialite, but you must enable it in the build configuration as stated by Matthias.

Hi,

just finish to compile QGIS with Matthias suggestion cmake
-DWITH_PYSPATIALITE

it works now thanks!

However, even with the standard SpatiaLite add button I can load layer,
with DB Manager QGIS crashes saying:

QGIS died on signal 11Could not attach to process.  If your uid matches
the uid of the target
process, check the setting of /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope, or try
again as the root user.  For more details, see /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf
ptrace: Operation not permitted.
No thread selected
No stack.
gdb returned 0

Should I open a ticket?

Thanks again guys for the time and help!

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7y2KNe51ezox-EhPicOWZcAxif3QomK_Hw2gLYiR2ZkeA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have set up the OTB and LiDAR tools Processing provider as separate
plugins, each of them in its own repo. The idea is to have those
providers that require 3rd party apps outside of the core Processing,
so they can be installed separately and managed independently. Alex
Bruy already did that for the TauDEM provider.

The removal of these two providers is in this PR (yet to be merged)

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4076

LiDAR Tools and OTB plugins are in repos in my github account at the
moment, but they will be transfered. The OTB dev team has accepted
taking the ownership of the OTB plugin, and Martin Isenburg (creator
of LASTools) will take the ownership of the LiDAR tools one. They will
take care of managing them and making releases when needed

I hope this will help better organizing these pieces of Processing,
and making it clearer for users how to use these providers.

If you have any comment, please let us know.

Thanks!

Thanks Victor. I think this is a good improvement, giving OTB and
LASTools more flexibility to update new versions.
One thing that worries me is: we are shipping OTB and LASTools at least
in Windows packages, and I believe we should keep on wit this. So it
seems weird to me an user is now not able to use it straight away, but
he has to install additional software. Maybe we could find a mechanism
to avoid this (install OTB and LasTools plugin in ~/.qgis3 with a
postinstall? this may cause other problems however; (ab)use the new
profiling?)

All the best.

I think we are not shipping them. OTB is available in OSGeo4W, but not
in the standalone installers, if I am right

One good thing that we have been discussing, related to this move, is
that for LiDAR tools, it should be possible to have a plugin that has
not just the code of the Processign provider, but the binaries as
well, so installing the plugin would add the algorithms to Processing
without any need to configure the paths to LASTools and FUSION
binaries, since they can be harcoded. If there is a change in the
binaries (such as an update), and the provider code has to be changed,
a new release can be made, independently of the QGIS release cycle
(unlike it happens now)

I think this is an interesting topic to discuss, and that's why I
wanted to send this email to get more feedback.

Thanks for your ideas!

AFAIK, OTB version in OSGeo4W is very outdated (5.0 if I'm not wrong).
Right now latest version is 5.8 and OTB team is working on 5.10.
I think having OTB provider separated from core will allow to update it
faster and also support more OTB features like special parameters types.

Hi, 

A quick question from user land.

Does having to explicitly set that option mean that spatialite might not be supported in the packaged releases of QGIS 3?

As someone that has (mostly) been paying attention to the continued stream of "shape files are so old and decrepit" comments that come up on these lists, and is making an attempt to learn one of the “modern” storage types (say spatialite) I’d like to know before 3 is released if I should be switching to a different path.

Hi,

Spatialite will be supported, core spatialite functionality does not
rely on python libraries.

If there are issues with db_manager spatialite functionality or other
python based modules, please contact your local package manager.



Technically we were reviewing a couple of alternatives to pyspatialite
(because it would be nice to have something properly supported for
python 3 by upstream) but we ended up not implementing these because
dynamic loading of extensions (and hence the spatialite extension) was
not enabled on every platform IIRC.

Hi

The next Hackfest is in Essen in the end of April 2017



At the moment there are 25 or 26 beds occupied. So 1 bed still available.



For booking at the Linuxhotel we need to get information about arrival and departure. So please update these information on the GITHUB page today.

Hi,

I think it´a good idea to move it to a plugin – installing I a special folder eg C:\ seem to be hard to understand…. And then setting up the providers…

It´s a bit worring when the users then are working with complicated functions. But for my students it has for some been an issue.



Installing plugins are installed without issues ☺

Sendt: 30. januar 2017 15:27
Til: qgis-developer
Emne: [Qgis-developer] OTB and LiDAR tools as separate plugins



Hi all,



I have set up the OTB and LiDAR tools Processing provider as separate plugins, each of them in its own repo. The idea is to have those providers that require 3rd party apps outside of the core Processing, so they can be installed separately and managed independently. Alex Bruy already did that for the TauDEM provider.



The removal of these two providers is in this PR (yet to be merged)



https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4076



LiDAR Tools and OTB plugins are in repos in my github account at the moment, but they will be transfered. The OTB dev team has accepted taking the ownership of the OTB plugin, and Martin Isenburg (creator of LASTools) will take the ownership of the LiDAR tools one. They will take care of managing them and making releases when needed



I hope this will help better organizing these pieces of Processing, and making it clearer for users how to use these providers.



If you have any comment, please let us know.



Thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server WFS and CurvePolygon layers
Message-ID: <45909e3d03cbb05122af8454514299e7@carto.net>

Hi, 

In QGIS server (very recent 2x version) I noticed that for layers with
geometry type CurvePolygon (Postgis data source) that the geometry is
just omitted. 

Here is a very simple project with 2 features: 

https://services.geo.zg.ch/ows/Hydrologie/GWS?SERVICE=WFS&REQUEST=GetFeature&VERSION=2.0.0&TYPENAME=test_curve_polygon&SRSNAME=EPSG:2056


Result: 

Features without a geometry, but a correct bounding box a the top of the
reponse. 

Anyone knows why the CurvePolygon is not supported? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi Larry, 

Thank you for your reply! 

It is actually a chain with an intermediate CA. So maybe I just hit the
issue you also discovered? 

It is about this URL/certificate: https://services.geo.zg.ch/ 

Root CA: SwissSign Silver G2 Root CA
Intermediate CA: Swiss Sign Silver CA 2014 - G22
SSL Certificate: services.geo.zg.ch 

So I will try do have a look at the workaround or fall back to http only
- because I can control both servers. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

This assumes you are cascading by configuring a QGIS project with a WMS layer and then, in turn, serving again via WMS through QGIS Server. If so, you should be able to use the authentication system to solve the connection issues. However, you will need to have the authentication database available to QGIS Server as well, via env variable, because the SSL Server configurations are stored in it.

Usually, validation would not check for trust of intermediates, only whether a given cert in the chain is valid for the particular use and the eventual trustworthiness of its root Certificate Authority. Essentially, any intermediates need to be trusted as roots CAs until this is fixed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WMS metadata() in non-English locale
Message-ID: <1485892171139-5305601.post@n6.nabble.com>

I am trying to retrieve the WMS version of a layer, and am just parsing its
metadata(), as no other solution was suggested here:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/213817/get-wms-version-from-qgis-layer-in-python

However, what does metadata() return if the user's locale is not English? In
other words, will "VERSION" be translated, and hence will this method fail?

Hi Tom,

Yes, unfortunately the string is translated.

Would be nice to have that available the same way as for vector data
providers:

QVariantMap metadata();
QString translateMetadataKey( const QString& key );
QString translateMetadataValue( const QString& key, const QVariant& value );

Cheers
Matthias

revisiting this problem; it is really making QGIS totally unusable for the large tables we are manipulating.

UNECESSARY FULL TABLE SCANS == VERY BAD USER EXPERIENCE!!

If funds could be made available for this fix, is there anyone able/available to add this functionality, and avoid a full table scan on adding a layer, and on existing project start-up?

(i.e. add a new pop-up dialog when one adds a new vector layer to optionally/manually enter the layer extents)

this would make QGIS *-far-* more usable for “big data”

thanks!
Chris

I get the following types of errors and have determined that the first 
is a preprocessor error due to QT_CONFIG being undefined.  Am I missing 
some kind of Qt config file?  Could someone send instructions how to 
specify please.  Is there a way to build the project using Qt Creator 
4.20?  I had a CMAKE cache file error when I tried.

Also, on Ubuntu Qt5Webkit and Qt5WebkitWidgets seem to be now 
Qt5WebEngineCore and Qt5WebEngineWidgets or perhaps something else.  
I've waited to see if anybody else would ask but they haven't as far as 
I know, how are they supposed to be handled?

Thanks.

 I can't help with the Q_ALWAYS_INLINE error, but can here. Qt5WebKit
and Qt5WebEngine core are very different beasts with different use
cases. Unfortunately Qt upstream have royally messed up this situation
in Qt5 by declaring Qt5WebKit deprecated. We can't switch to
Qt5WebEngine as it's just too limited and doesn't support many of the
methods we need from Qt5WebKit.

If you don't have Qt5WebKit available you can set WITH_QTWEBKIT to
FALSE to allow QGIS to build. You won't be able to use any html
dependant features (eg composer html items, or html annotations), but
the rest should work OK.
