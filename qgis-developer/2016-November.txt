One thing I learned:

- IF you make use of a plugin Makefile (if you created a plugin using
the plugin builder), is to FIRST fix your make file (that is:
- point to .qgis3 directory instead of .qgis2
- change pyrcc4 an pyuic4 to pyrcc5 and pyuic5 in your makefile
- make clean (to get rid of the Qt4-versions of your gui-py files and
resources
- run make again to have Qt5 versions of your gui-py's and resources
- and THEN run [QGIS-repo]/scripts/2to3 <yourplugin sources>

Else you end up wondering why just half of your python files are 'fixed'
by the script :-)

Other point to make:
- as a lot of deprecated QGIS code is removed: remove all the switches
you had for < 2.0 (if you have an old plugin :-) ), <2.6 etc etc
versions of QGIS, as this cleans up nicely

- FIX all signal slot stuff to use the 'connect'/new way

- I only had a couple of QGIS-api changes. But that is maybe still coming...

- Often you can clean __init_.py (as that was used for the 'old'
waymetadata (which is now in metadata.txt), and I had to keep that for
very old QGIS version (my plugin should work from 1.8 onwards....)

- maybe some notes about the Qt-wrappers and the future script?

Some links to add: http://qgis.org/api/api_break.html
And please add other api change links... I think we should put these on
the frontpage of qgis.org.. I could not google them easy

Hi Richard,

Thanks for the feedback, very interesting.

We have been working on a plugin qgis2compat [1] that aims at being a
legacy layer, so you have to maintain only a single plugin.

1. Migrate to QGIS 3
2. Add some code to load the compatibility layer
3. Add missing compatibility fixes in the qgis2compat plugin

This way one has to manage only a single - QGIS 3 compatible - plugin
and incompatible calls are routed transparently to the appropriate QGIS
2 API. Without any if-version-branches inside your plugin code, so once
the day comes you can just drop the qgis2compat plugin.

Main advantage:
 * maintain a single codebase (!!)
 * the code is clean and targetted at QGIS 3
 * the load for writing versioned calls can be mutualized between
   plugin developers

https://github.com/opengisch/qgis2compat

Cheers
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Field mapper when pasting features

Hi Arnaud,

I am really looking forward to seeing such feature implemented in QGIS,
thanks for bringing up the discussion.

I would also recommend going for a QEP, as it is a largely foreseen
feature, and I suppose everyone has its own definition and use-case...

From my point of view, we should go for a very generic field-mapping
mechanism which could be used in many places such as copy-paste. A way
of reading/saving configuration would be quite useful, like presets.

Best wishes,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WFS strange network timeout error on localhost
 with latest master tests (but not on 127.0.0.1)
Message-ID: <CAL5Q673ZzQdnsoG7NxMdvECbfb+c0o_wkYYH5LzfeCHXZf6SEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to solve a strange issue from a QGIS python test in master:

If I use "localhost" in the url, this times out:
assert QgsVectorLayer("version='auto' table='' url='
http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi/?map=/home/dev/QGIS/tests/testdata/qgis_server/test_project.qgs'
typename='testlayer_èé' srsname='EPSG:4326'", 'wfs', 'WFS').isValid()

- If I point it to 127.0.0.1 it works normally.
- Both localhost and 127.0.0.1 work as expected from a web browser or for
curl/wget
- Using another server different from qgis shows the same behaviour (hence
it does not depend on qgis server but only on the hostname)
- The same Python code works fine if run from within QGIS master
- I have nothing strange in my /etc/hosts
- This does not depend on ctest: runnig the test directly from python shows
the same problem
- WMS is working fine with both localhost and 127.0.0.1, so far only WFS
shows this problem


Env:
- ubuntu xenial
- Qt 5.5.1

Any idea?

Hi all,

Speaking about child tables, I would rather have them presented as table
and not forms by default (or have an option to decide this for QGIS
installation). Usually you only want to see the list of children for each
relation, which is more compact, and show very fast if there is zero or any
children.

Hi,

I'm using 2.18 on Ubuntu and the following lines segfault:
​​
multi = QgsMultiPointV2()
multi.addGeometry(QgsPointV2(0,1))
multi.addGeometry(QgsPointV2(2,2))
print multi.asWkt()

Can you confirm? Or is it already fixed and I should update?

What's the recommended way to collect points and afterwards compute
bounding box area?

Thank you and best wishes,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] issue in exported SLD for categories symbology
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zNOaovPhkBq1cnvtBoj6bTfjnco2APR1PS_2ogjwoiZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

It seems that there is an issue with SLD exports. When exporting
categorical symbology in which a default value is defined (for all
values not matching any of the categories) a rule-based symbology is
created. However, the default category has no ELSE in it (as it
should), and the default symbol is applied to all elements, since it
has no filter, and shadows the rest of the symbology.

Morever, when a rule-based symbology is defined as rule-based, and the
ELSE condition is added, it is not exported. The resulting SLD has
something like this:

<se:Rule>
         <se:Name></se:Name>
         <!--Parser Error: syntax error, unexpected ELSE - Expression
was: ELSE-->
         <se:PolygonSymbolizer>
           <se:Fill>
             <se:SvgParameter name="fill">#9a5ceb </se:SvgParameter>
           </se:Fill>
           <se:Stroke>
             <se:SvgParameter name="stroke">#000001 </se:SvgParameter>
             <se:SvgParameter name="stroke-width">1</se:SvgParameter>
             <se:SvgParameter name="stroke-linejoin">bevel</se:SvgParameter>
           </se:Stroke>
         </se:PolygonSymbolizer>
       </se:Rule>

Is that a known limitation, or is it like that for some reason?

For the record, the resulting SLD is correctly rendered in GeoServer,
so maybe there is some issue in how QGIS handles those default
categories. Opening the exported SLD and using it for a layer in QGIS
causes all feature to be rendered with the default symbol.

It might be related to this issue:

Hi Victor,
that would be a good usage of <ElseFilter/>, which is indeed designed
to match all features not matched by other rules in the same
featuretypestyle

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS crash when displaying lines using
	QgsGeometryRubberBand
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C57ED5F5@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hi!

I was trying to visualize a linestring using the QgsGeometryRubberBand and had QGIS crashing as soon as the rubber band was being drawn. It looks like the geometry is being corrupted somewhere.

If I draw a polygon it works fine:

from qgis.core import *
from qgis.gui import *
rb = QgsGeometryRubberBand(iface.mapCanvas(), QGis.Polygon)
g = QgsGeometry.fromWkt('POLYGON((0 0, 0 1, 1 1, 1 0, 0 0))')
rb.setGeometry(g.geometry().clone())

If I draw a line instead QGIS crashes:

from qgis.core import *
from qgis.gui import *
rb = QgsGeometryRubberBand(iface.mapCanvas(), QGis.Line)
g = QgsGeometry.fromWkt('LINESTRING(0 0, 1 1)')
rb.setGeometry(g.geometry().clone())

The crash happens at: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/release-2_18/src/gui/qgsgeometryrubberband.cpp#L57

QgsAbstractGeometryV2* paintGeom = mGeometry->clone();

Is it a difference in the deep copy/clone mechanism that fails somehow, since I guess that the problem arises in the cloning of the abstract geometry in my two samples and not in line 57 of qgsgeometryrubberband.cpp?


Regards, Casper

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 2.18 'Las Palmas'
Message-ID: <20161103101707.GA29735@norbit.de>

QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System that runs on
Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.

We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 2.18 'Las Palmas' on the
October 21st.  Las Palmas was the host city to our developer meet up in
November 2015.

Latest Release

This is the latest and last release in the 2.x series.  This release provides
incremental improvements over our previous release. The majority of activity is
currently focussed towards the development of QGIS 3.0 which is our next
generation release planned for the end of the first quarter of 2017.

The current Long Term Release (LTR) remains version 2.14.x and will be
maintained until it's replaced by the first LTR based on QGIS 3.

New Features in QGIS 2.18 'Las Palmas'

QGIS 2.18 includes great new features, tweaks and enhancements to make the most
popular Free desktop GIS even more feature filled and useful.  Visit the
visual changelog that highlights some of the new additions
( http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog218/ ).

Whenever new features are added to software they introduce the possibility of
new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a
ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker ( http://hub.qgis.org ).

The source code and binaries for Windows, Debian and Ubuntu are already
available via the large download link on our home page: http://qgis.org.  More
packages will follow as soon as the package maintainers finish their work.
Please revisit the page if your platform is not available yet.

Thanks

Finally we would like to thank our official sponsors for the invaluable
financial support they provide to this project:

Fixed.  Still a redirect to the changelog site - eventually the changelog will
be imported into the website.

Hi Nyall

Thanks for fixing #15505 it works nicely now and sorry it took me some time to get back to the issue and test it out.

I was wondering if it is possible to see somehow which QGIS releases has the current fix in it?

Hi Casper,

Click any of the commit link (Revision........) in the bug report and it
leads you to a page where the branch (hence the release) is mentioned under
the title of the fix. In this particular case, the fix has been ported from
master (3.0) to release-2.18 and release-2.16 (though this one has not been
published as there's no 2.16.4 ).
So your fix is currently available in 2.18.0 and next 3.0.

HTH,
Harrissou

Hi Stefan,

This should already be fixed in 2.14-ltr-dev build [1].

Sidenote: In master there are unit tests for the eliminate algorithm and
this error would never have made it to a release...

Hi Devs,

Is multi map canvas for QGIS it actually going to make into qgis 3.0? I've
share some additional thoughts in the QEP.

Thanks David and Matthias for providing some feedbacks about QGIS 3 on mac.
I also would like QGIS 3 compiling on mac.

I hope you will update the install.md on the repo when you will have a
working workflow ? Thanks

Hi

I'm trying to compile QGIS master on Ubuntu 14.04. According to the INSTALL
[1] file I try to install the build depencies but I can't find some of them:

E: Unable to locate package libqca-qt5-2-dev
E: Unable to locate package libqca-qt5-2-plugins
E: Unable to locate package libqwt-qt5-dev
E: Unable to locate package pyqt5.qsci-dev
E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'pyqt5.qsci-dev'
E: Unable to locate package python3-future

Any ideas?

You need to self compile them, or use 16.04.

Message-ID: <D54333308A8EE94FB62F55487E054D010150FE4334@VVVMAIL11.vvv.vvv-konzern.net>

Hi,



"area" is a double-field with values e. g. 213.1234,  43215.3456, ...



strpos("area",'.') gives only value 1 return :-(

strpos(to_string("area"),'.') gives only value 1 return  :-(



This error exits only by '.', other search-strings e. g. '12', '1', ... work fine



Our workarround works fine.



strpos( replace( to_string( "area" ), '.', ',' ), ',' )



Is this a bug with '.'?



best regards, mikeE.

libqca-qt5-2-dev and pyqt5.qsci-dev is not available for trusty (xenial and
yakkety have it) [1].

That's also why there are no master builds for anything before xenial [2]

Hi Stefan,
IIRC Packages for qca-qt5 are not avail for 14.04, yo might be sucessful
in building them from source.
[1] might help

qsci same

and python3-future seems avail at [2] but not on the ubuntu repos??

ciao

Hi,

strpos is based on regexp, a '.' matches any character.
To let the engine treat a . as such you need to prefix it with a
double-backslash.

strpos(to_string("area"), '\\.')

Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS v3 Code sprint in Lyon
Message-ID: <3498729.YsVgHOQWdH@tatras>

Dear Developers,

Several french(-swiss) companies are interested to organized a code sprint 
before the end of  the year around QGIS (server) v3.

This code sprint would take place in Lyon either in 29-29 November or 12-13 
December in regards of your feedback, see[1]. Please answer only if you plan 
to be present! This is the most important step for now for the code sprint 
organisation

For you information, we (Camptocamp, 3Liz, Oslandia) will focuse on QGIS v3, 
especially QGIS Server (but other developers are welcome to work on other 
parts).

Régis and I are the current organizer team and official contacts. Régis will 
post here the wiki page for the code sprint so you can register soon.

This is quiet short to organized this so we will focused on lunch and dinner 
and location, no more (well if we find a location for a nice dinner it will be 
great). We will share a call for sponsorship program quickly this week.

Thanks,

Y.

I am facing to the same problem on Ubuntu when using QGIS 2.14.8.
Please open new issue. Meanwhile I needed to downgrade to QGIS 2.14.3
which is working for me. Martin

Read 28-29 November!

Actually, my own opinion is that it could be quiet hard to organize the code 
sprint in 3 weeks :)

Or we could upgrade regex_match() to return an offset instead of a binary
false / true.

We should indicate in the function help that strpos is regexp based.

Hi,

strpos is based on regexp, a '.' matches any character.
To let the engine treat a . as such you need to prefix it with a
double-backslash.

strpos(to_string("area"), '\\.')

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Loading sld with external graphics
Message-ID: <CAHPjskN3vcRSmDB_wiwjBPU6x4_V5vxdkStROTYu2dDhxKqMfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am working with the Norwegian Mapping Authority and we are planing on
making a registry that consists of svg files that are going to be used in
sld's when styling gml.

I have no problem with loading sld files into QGIS when i use
ExternalGraphic --> OnlineResource to a location on my computer, but when i
"xlink:href" to an actual online resource and try to load the sld file into
QGIS the program crash.

It would be really nice if people could link to svg or png on the web to
use for their styling, so that they do not have to download a bunch of
images when they are going to style a dataset.

I hope there are some easy fix to this :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Snapping visual feedback
Message-ID: <CABgOYCdtORs=GUdVnx3edUiy+4u7BsyFedg+aQEJUos7PX71xA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

When editing geometries, it is currently impossible to know on which layer
the current edit tool is snapped.
So in case of very close vertices, nodes or segments, you have to change
your snapping settings each time you need to explicitly snap on a target
layer.
It seems that there is in autocad some kind of visual feedback by changing
the snapping cursor symbol according to which layer is snapped. We are
asked to do something similar in QGIS.

Did I miss something?
Is there any work in progress in that area?

I still don't have any draft idea of how to do that, ideas are welcome :)

Cheers
Régis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Did I miss something on nightly qgis-dev
Message-ID: <b172feb2-1296-9e24-1fc0-48190099cb0d@pp1.inet.fi>

Hi,

on my morning rituals belongs updating nightly qgis-dev. I've noticed
for some time that there is no new build, the latest is 2.19.0-2.
I'm using osgeo4w to take care of the routine.

There might be several solutions to my problem:
1. there is not at all anymore nightly build?
2. it's not anymore in osgeo4w?
3. there is no more  nightly qgis-dev due new python or something other
new feature?
4. something else?

Best regards and thanks in advance,
Kari

The nightly builds are currently based off the 2.x series, and a new one is
only made when there's been changes since the last one. Almost all the work
now is being done on the 3.x branch, so, no new nightlies...

When the nightlies change over to the 3.x branch the new releases will
start flowing through again. With TONS of changes, but also no working
plugins. There's no timeframe on this yet.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Feedback re future of core c++ plugins in QGIS 3.0
Message-ID: <CAB28AshWJ1gqzBBXgoMBQM3MkWpwBvEdwPDnuymmoXY=cO6g3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Discussion is currently underway concerning the future of a number of
the plugins which come preinstalled with QGIS.

This concerns the plugins:

- coordinate capture
- evis
- geometry_checker
- georeferencer
- heatmap
- interpolation
- offline editing
- oracle raster
- raster terrain analysis
- road graph
- spatial query
- topology checker

If you're an active user of any of these plugins, your feedback would
be greatly appreciated. You can join the discussion over at:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/issues/67

Note that a number of preinstalled plugins have already been removed
in 3.0 - specifically:

- geometry snapper: was generalised to work with all layer types and
moved to a processing algorithm
- zonal statistics: was moved to a processing algorithm
- dxf2shp converter: was removed from QGIS - this conversion is better
handled outside of QGIS, eg by using OGR tools directly.

I have been preparing Homebrew and OSGeo4Mac 'taps' for this move and am
now focusing on QGIS 3 formulae, probably starting on Thursday or Friday. I
hope to have everything building and docs completed by the end of the
weekend.

The new formulae will not be hosted in OSGeo4Mac or Homebrew (at least not
until there are stable releases), but in a specific tap for QGIS
development and Travis CI support:

https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev

So, look for changes there as things progress. Please contribute or post
bug reports there for those dev formulae or docs, once they are available.

Message-ID: <53573.172.31.56.50.1478682852.squirrel@webmail.ensg.eu>

Hello,

I am a student in the French school of geomatics, ENSG in Paris. Our
current project is to develop a c++ plugin that records GPS tracks
(map-matching).

We worked on debian 8.4 with Qgis 2.14.8 (latest version of 2.14) and Qt 4.8.

One of the instructions is to use and compile the plugin Globe to open the
tracks in 3D. The problem is the compilation of the plugin Globe. We
isolated it, tried to resolve all the errors the isolation of the plugin
and when we succeeded the plugin compiled but not in a proper way: the
file of library (.so) is copied with the others in /usr/lib/qgis/plugins
but the plugin is not find by QGIS.

Have you any ideas to help us ?

Thanks

Elsa Darroman

Hi,

We (as osgeo SAC admins) receive a lot of requests for the osge-mantra
from QGIS users, just because they think you need that to use plugins.

I think it is because plugins.qgis.org lands on a page in which it says:
"In order to access to some functionalities of this website you will
need to login with a valid OSGEO ID."

I think it has something to do with the fact that we plugins.qgis.org
was first 'hub', a collection of some QGIS/django/issues related web-apps.
But now plugins.qgis.org is actually only plugins (+ a user map and planet)

I propose either to cleanup the django app, so it is ONLY plugins, and
maybe create another small app for all the rest apps (usermap, planet)

OR to remove the landing page, and move that text to the dev part of the
website. The landing page could be a more generic page maybe, telling
that you install plugins via the plugin manager, and this app is only if
you want to upload plugins?

Another option would be to remove the little login-man from the frontpage.

It is getting annoying to answer all the user requests for a mantra,
just because they want a plugin...

Regards,

Richard

+1 to move that to dev section.

However on that note: how hard is it to connect other providers for
authentication? Google, Facebook, etc I know people like the OSGeoID thing,
but having other options isn't bad.

The qgis package in jessie-backports should have the globe plugin 
enabled already, so you don't need to compile it.

It may be that the recent updates disabled it again as the globe plugin 
doesn't support the osgearth version in testing/unstable.

Bas

Thank you for raising the discussion Richard,

I agree, the plugin landing page should be mainly targeted at users. A
short description + picture for the best plugins ever, see e.g.

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/, https://extensions.gnome.org/ ...

and have a link to a dev section somewhere.

And I would also like to stress the requirement for other auth providers.
If I remember correctly, the decision to stick to redmine was taken
under the assumption that the mantra is a temporary workaround.

If you add other means, please also accept OpenID.

I like to identify myself by providing my website
(note: this is also what we request to people looking for a mantra,
to prove their identity)

Yeah I think splitting it up might be nice (or splitting the non plugin manager related apps off together into the changelog django instance) might be nice.

Message-ID: <CAFF9Zhvj-EDk23is83FV3Y+V1MwDx3Mc1UF-h2CTFpK+a6qJhA@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning,


purging my PC,  I found 1595  files named   "qgis-*.dmp"  in my Temp
folder.

Totally, they amount to 36 giga of space  :(

For example, I have many of:

myUSER\AppData\Local\Temp\qgis-20140915-160805-11200-8480-c3a2817.dmp

each of 23 mega.


So, for each quitting of QGIS since 2.18  from  september 05 2014  I had a
crash (also without any plugin installed).

Also, randomically I had crashes.

So, now I am deleting these files, to have space sufficent in my PC to work.


I hope this can be sufficient for you to start a good debug of this
problem, that I have reported more than once.

If you need, I can share that files with you (also if I don't know how).


Best regards

Geo

That's about osgEarth 2.8, which is still in Debian experimental because 
QGIS doesn't support it yet, not even QGIS 3.0 which benefits from the 
Qt5 support in osgEarth 2.8.

QGIS 2.14 LTR doesn't support osgEarth 2.7 which is in Debian 
testing/unstable and hence the globe plugin is disabled in those 
distributions.

QGIS >= 2.16 does support osgEarth 2.7, but not 2.5 in Debian jessie and 
QGIS disables the globe plugin for the unsupported osgEarth versions.

Bas

What a mess...

I wish osgEarth one day receives some sort of at least semi-stable API.

Does Qt5 give us anything 3d related that we can just do all this inline
without worrying another dependency?

I don't know, but I suspect Pirmin (CCed) does as he's been most 
involved in the globe plugin.

There is no way to directly access the internals of a plugin. There were
some previous discussions but it was always concluded that this
shouldn't be done.
I even wrote a patch once that exposed some globe internals as a plugin-api.

If it's just opening the globe your best option is to search in the
menus for the action and trigger this directly.

Yes - since Qt 5.7 there is a brand new 3D framework:
http://blog.qt.io/blog/2016/06/16/introducing-qt-3d/

Of course it would need a major rewrite of the globe plugin, but maybe
it would be worth it :-)

Hi,
Have you reported it to the bug tracker - https://hub.qgis.org/issues - 
That's the best way to report this sort of behaviour. While I can see 
why a dmp file would be useful, no program should be leaving GB of dump 
files behind.

Maybe it should clean up when there are more than x number?

Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi,
just a notice: I experience crashes while zooming if geometries are 
invalid. As soon as I fix them the crashes stop.

Setting: Geometries from PostGIS with ST_IsValid(geometry) = false, QGIS 
2.* 64bit on Win7
So it could be worth to check your data.

I had crashes also without loading any shp or other, and without any plugin (I tried also deleting .qgis2  folder and with --noplugins option in starting cmd)

Yes I trached in qgis issues many times, but it was closed without any fix, and the "minidump" title was renamed. 

So, I am tired.   :(

Please, try yourself to insert the issue and see what will happens.  If you need some dmp file, I backupped them, and I can send how many you and others need. 

Regards

Geo

I like the idea of having some "top rated" , "top downloads" and "most
recent" plugins in the home page in some strongly visual way.

It would be great to have some instructions on how to install plugins, or
even better links to the user manual. The same goes to instructions on how
to submit plugins to the repository.

Hi,

How about simply showing the plugin list
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/?sort=-featured by default when going to
plugins.qgis.org?

Most of the time, that's what people are looking for anyway, I'd bet.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi,

just to be sure that you are aware of that, in case the the front page text
needs changes/updates it can be easily edited online by clicking on
http://plugins.qgis.org/admin/flatpages/flatpage/1/ (with proper
credentials).

BTW, I'd also like to see the front page reworked, as it is there is too
much text. Creating new subpages (flatpages in Django admin) is very easy
but maybe we should better merge all the information on the plugin site
into the main documentation PyQGIS Cookbook and link to the appropriate
sections on that site.



Cheers

Hi Francisco, your suggestion is to move from QWebView to CEF/PyQT?

QWetKit (on qt4) has been discontinued on debia due to low secure
maintenance, but reintroduced with qt5... doo you think it could be
CEF more supported with only three contributors? CEF seems more active
and could be an interesting solution. Can you prepare a proof of
concept porting build for e.g. identify tool or plugin manager?

btw three.js is already usable in QWebView since (at least) 2011, do
you mind CEF would introduce some advantages respect QWebView?

regards
Luigi Pirelli

That was my thinking. Having links to documentation is a much better
approach compared with the wall of text in the front page.

(I apologize in advance for the cross-posting.)

We are considering holding the annual "C Tribe" Code Sprint in Daytona 
Beach, FL and are currently considering two dates.

If you are interested in attending, then please confirm your interest 
and the dates that work for you in this Doodle. We will keep the doodle 
open until early next week:

http://doodle.com/poll/vyyew4ibbwcdp6ka

You can find out more about the plan as it evolves in the wiki:

https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Daytona_Beach_Code_Sprint_2017

and follow the full discussion on the "tosprint" list:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/tosprint/2016-November/000644.html


* Note that the "C Tribe Sprint" is labelled this way only for 
historical reasons since and is really open to all "tribes". The goal is 
cross-project collaboration and all OSGeo projects are invited.

Hi,
Looking at QGIS Application project in Transifex, it appears that the
icelandic is transated at 50% but not available in QGIS (actually in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/i18n) while slovak (40%) is
available.

What's the minimum translated strings required to have a language pushed to
QGIS?

Hi Luigi

I’m not proposing a migration. The thing is that I was trying to do the
development with a qwebviewer and three, js, pannellum, etc. and the
rendering was awful and sometimes it was imposible to move along the image.

Looking for other possibilities, I found ceppython because I used cefsharp
in another project, where rendering in extremely fast and equal to a web
image viewer.

Nowadays I’m implementing a demo for personal purposes and the difference
is noticeable, I could prepare an example.

Regarding the contributors, I don’t find it so important, the important
thing is that it is a functional and active project.

The result is very good.
What I can not do is use it in qgis.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/./python\qgis\utils.py", line 607, in _import
    mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)

    mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.

Any suggestions?

Being somewhat unfamiliar with Python I needed to have a QGIS plugin to 
debug my code.

I modified the QGIS remote debug code for the QGIS 2.99 development 
version.  It works on Ubuntu 16.04 and is forked from the GitHub site 
for the qgis-remote-debug plugin.

This brought about a few questions:

1.  Are plugins going to be a complete break from QGIS < 2.99 in moving 
forward to Python 3.5, Qt5.7, etc?

2.  Is 2to3 the only way to go?  I didn't use it but it probably would 
have been easier.

3.  Is a plugin supposed to be backward compatible from Python 3.5+ and 
Qt5.7 to Python 2.7 or less and Qt4?

4.  How does one code to make the plugin work in the QGIS <= 2.18 and 
QGIS >= 2.99?

5.  How is python-six, python3-six, or pypy-six supposed to be used or 
python-future for that matter?

Any pointers will definitely help me produce more useful code.

To answer one of my questions:

http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html

Therefore futurize (and pasteurize to backport) may be alternatives to 
2to3 and allow development of plugin code that works for both QGIS 2 and 
QGIS 3.

It would be nice to get some directions to avoid going off in the wrong 
direction or add unnecessary overhead.

 Hi,
Thanks for raising plugins.qgis.org problems, Richard. I had looked for
ways to address things like this in the past but was unable to figure out
where the source were, looking unsuccessfully at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django. Now Thanks to Alessandro I know I was
starring the wrong place.

I think the first and mandatory thing to do is to remove the button at the
top right. I also fell into the trap:
- connect to the plugins.qgis.org to look for a plugin
- enter a  keyword in the text box
- the next and logical step is to click that button nearby instead of
hitting "Enter"
- you end up with creating an account if you're not cautious, and without
any explanation on what a login is necessary for.
This button should  be removed as there's already a "LOGIN" button earlier.

In the same spirit, there's also two links to qgis.org page (the Logo and
"QGIS Home"). We should keep only one!
Hence my proposal for the menus would be: the Logo (leads to qgis.org),
"Home" (leads to plugins.qgis.org), "Plugins",  "Planet", "User
Map","Login" and "Search textbox". Maybe move the "Share Plugin" button
somewhere in the menu bar to help devs directly access it.

About the text available at the landing page, I also agree that it's too
much and not really useful for common users. Links to bug reporting section
in qgis.org is confusing and inappropriate as it's about hub.qgis.org. And
it does neither mention access to "Planet" or "User Map" features. I think
this page should explain what this site is for, which features are
available and link to appropriate pages/sites depending on the item. Hence
I'm not sure plugins.org should land directly to
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/?sort=-featured (a section I've never
understood what it was about).

Link to documentation seems a good idea as there's a whole chapter (
http://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html)
about plugin development, with the advantage of translation.

Harrissou

That was my thinking. Having links to documentation is a much better
approach compared with the wall of text in the front page.

(cc'ing to dev list too)

@Phil: I'm VERY curious if this helps... because IF it does (and it
could because: if it is actually GDAL which is pulling the json over the
net, it needs proxy info too, and it is not picked up by the Qt-network
machinery probably)....)

BUT IF this works, it woul be nice to maybe make this part of a normal
QGIS setup:
IF a user set's a proxy, also create a environment variable for GDAL!

Another option would maybe to have some wrapper around GDAL, or make
GDAL aware of using QTNetworkManager via that wrapper?

Does this makes sense?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Sure, all network settings should be centralized.
IMHO better opening a ticket, not to forget about this, and of course
helping to find a solution.
All the best.

Just FYI, a couple of months ago I had the same issue with password secured
GeoJSON files over https and under proxy.
The access to the GeoJSON files worked without any problem without the
proxy.
Under the proxy I had to set the environment variable as said in a previous
email.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugins: "standalone" versus more tightly
	integrated
Message-ID: <1479122597576-5295643.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

Nathan got in touch over the weekend, and we discussed possible plugin
changes. He suggested breaking up the one-dialog GUI, and instead embedding
the different parts into appropriate places in QGIS:

- general options into own pane
- preview window into own pane
- layer settings as plugin to style dock

I honestly can't decide what I think about this.

Pros:
- tighter integration with QGIS and improved workflow (instead of start
plugin, preview, close plugin, change QGIS settings, start plugin)
- remove GUI duplication
- reduce GUI development of plugin (perhaps)

Cons:
- plugin loses identity (vague)
- cluttering/confusion/pollution of QGIS GUI
- initially less simply for user, as not all functionality in one dialog

What do others think about this? I think it could probably improve workflow
for the plugin, by using QGIS UI to allow user customization of the UI
(dock/undock panes, etc). However, one dialog is certainly simple.

Thanks

Tom

The qtcreator setup page:

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/qgisdevelopersguide/qtcreator.html

contains a broken link to:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/CODING.md


Indeed there is no directory 'blob' in the project (anymore) and I 
cannot find any file called 'CODING.md' neither.

Does anyone know where it should point to?

Hi Tom,

Offering the possibility for this sounds good to me. I have already
added an API to register custom pages on the vector layer properties
page and will be happy to see more such functionality.

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog216/index.html#feature-api-add-pages-to-vector-layer-properties

Are you talking about qgis2web in particular or more generally?

I think most of the cons can be neglected because the whole process is
opt-in. If someone wants he can still use a simple single dialog. Or
create the integrated option windows while keeping a simple "setup
wizard" around for people to get started with.

At the same time, the risk of "cluttering" the UI is present. But there
are already now a ton of possibilities to decrease UX from plugins.
That's the cost of giving power to plugin developers, "with great power
comes great responsibility" ;)

Cheers
Matthias

Hi Raymond,

It has been moved to the website, have a look here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/7b0837f490018d938695ccf601ba9595cee7bdbd

Can you update the link to

Thanks

Hi Matthias

Yes, I'm talking about qgis2web, but thought the discussion was generally
relevant. I'm not sure I agree with the opt-in approach. I think either it
stays as it is, or the single dialog disappears, and it is embedded as
Nathan suggests. Users could then configure the qgis2web panes in their QGIS
UI layout, but I don't think the single dialog would remain.

Thanks for the thoughts

Tom

Hey,

Yeah, this was mainly just a side comment from watching Tom's talk and how
integrated some plugins should be as part of the UI and if that makes the
general UX better or worse.

It's not always relevant in every context but I have started to become a
fan of reusing what is provided in core vs custom for each plugin, but
this depends on the plugin and the user.

Something to keep in mind at least.  As most people know I'm not a fan of
dialogs, even non-model ones so always on the look out for better
integration with
the main interface.

Hi Tom,

The opt-in approach was for plugin development in general. As long as
the API is there, anyone is free to use it or not. What's done for a
specific plugin - like qgis2web in this case - is up to its developer.

Anyway, for an example of what's possible now, have a look at the globe
plugin which uses the plugin API to register additional pages.

Cheers
Matthias

Hello,

The pool is closed. We publish some information on the wiki github page [1].

We will publish a call for sponsorship later this week.

Can add you in the wiki page for those who plan to come? Even if you don't 
answer to the pool, you can come ;) We need to plan the lunch and the dinner.

Note that even if some of us (as organizer or not) have some plan for the code 
sprint, we suggest to start some discussion before the code sprint.

Thanks,

Y.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] delete selected features slow (because of
	featurecount/events)??
Message-ID: <bf09577cde9e098f47d541bf442e3745@xs4all.nl>


Hi Dev's,

having a small dataset of 300 features (from an online service).

I want to quickly remove most/all of those features, request a new set 
an put them in the same vectorlayer (in a python plugin).

All ok, untill you activate the 'show feature count' in the legend.

If you show the featurecount, it looks like the features are deleted one 
by one: you can see the featurecount go down to zero... ( but I also 
have dataset with a lot more features :-( ) and it takes several (ten's) 
seconds.

Easy testable:

- load some data, tick the 'show feature count' tickbox in the legend.
- make the layer editable and select all features
- make sure the layer is current in the legend

do the following in the python console:

l=iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
l.deleteSelectedFeatures()

you can see the 'feature count' go down one by one (slowly...)

while... if you do it outside of python, using the little red 
delete-basket in the edit-toolbar. All features are deleted in a blink! 
Also if you show the featurecount...

I tried some different ways, but could not find a quick way?

Do I miss something/a quicker way?

I thought that it maybe had something to do with filling up the 
'editbuffer', so tried with and without the 'edit' construct [0]
But in this case I just do not want an edit-buffer anyway..

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi devs!

I compiled QGIS 2.18 with Qt 5.3.2 and Visual Studio 2013. There are
some problems:

0. VS 2013 dont support `noexcept` keyword and throws
qgsfield.h(383): error C3646: 'noexcept' : unknown override specifier

Setting USE_CXX_11 to FALSE manually lead to following error:
3>  Generating ui_qgsrelationreferenceconfigdlgbase.h
4>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio

12.0\VC\include\xkeycheck.h(250): fatal error C1189: #error :  The C++
Standard Library forbids macroizing keywords. Enable warning C4005 to
find the forbidden macro.

I added this defines to CMakeLists.txt to disable C1189 error and
redefine only noexcept:
ELSEIF (MSVC AND MSVC_VERSION GREATER 1600)
  SET(USE_CXX_11 TRUE)
+  ADD_DEFINITIONS("-D_ALLOW_KEYWORD_MACROS=1")
+  ADD_DEFINITIONS("-Dnoexcept=")

1. Q_WS_* macroses changed to Q_OS_* in Qt5
Q_WS_WIN macro in 'src/core/geometry/qgsgeometry.cpp:48' breaks
compilation on Windows.

2. Linking of all executables fails with:
2>MSVCRT.lib(crtexew.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol
_WinMain at 16 referenced in function ___tmainCRTStartup
2>D:\Projects\QGIS\build\output\Release\qgis_help.exe : fatal error
LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals

It is related to CMake Warning:
CMake Warning (dev) in src/helpviewer/CMakeLists.txt:
  Policy CMP0020 is not set: Automatically link Qt executables to qtmain
  target on Windows.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0020" for policy details.
  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

Added 'CMAKE_POLICY (SET CMP0020 NEW)' to following files:
- src/app/CMakeLists.txt
- src/browser/CMakeLists.txt
- src/helpviewer/CmakeLists.txt

Setting this to root CMakeLists.txt has no effect, dont know why.

3. Running debug build fails with assert in method 'void
QgsMapLayerModel::addLayers( const QList<QgsMapLayer *>& layers )'
line 96 (layers list is empty).
qgis output - http://pastebin.com/zaHv0hpz
call stack - http://pastebin.com/PVV8bsLW

Adding 'if ( layers.isEmpty() ) return;' fix this.

4. Multiple warnings:

	key, extents?
Message-ID: <E00DFE91-FB1E-4D0F-9345-B7DD66798F9C@housecanary.com>

greetings -

I have noticed for a long time, that despite checking the  “use estimated metadata” box when adding PostGIS layers, QGIS seems to issue 2 full-table scan queries. Although I do notice a number of queries to pg_stats, etc looking for various things, NET/NET is 2 full table scans looking like:
SELECT count(distinct ("block_id"))=count(("block_id")) FROM "christest"."block_th_view"
SELECT st_extent("the_geom") FROM "christest"."block_th_view"
Consider a well-indexed table with billions of GPS points with a free running counter as its unique key, that only allows display up to a zoom scale of 1:1000. Good GIST indexing and fast RAID disks make such a huge table very usable ... ONCE given a chance… The user KNOWS it’s extent is the whole world and the primary key is indeed unique. But there seems to be no way to “just add it”…
For tables with many hundreds of millions of objects, this is an unreasonable operation to perform every time that layer is added.
I am a complete newbie to the QGIS source, but am wondering if
QgsPostgresProvider::extent() might be enhanced, or perhaps more generally QgsVectorDataProvider::extent() , to store some metadata in the local sqlite database, and recognize a new “extent” tag on a maplayer within a project, and a “skip metadata checks” preference to just trust these values. Similarly for QgsPostgresProvider::uniqueData() .
Helping user avoid unneeded full data table scans will make QGIS *-far-* more usable.

thank you
Chris Nicholas

Could you check if an issue mentioning this problem exists already
on hub.qgis.org and add one if not already present ?

I've had the same impression and it is possible this was a regression.
It'd be great to have an automated test guarding against full table
scans with PostGIS, to secure the feature once for all..

Hi, 

I think your question is related to this issue [1]. 

It is about QGIS Server but the issue is the same. 

QGIS needs a way to declare the extent of a layer to avoid a query that
gets (st_extent) or guesses (st_estimated_extent) the extent. 

[1] : http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14364

Hi,
I did raise those issues in the list and in the hub before because I wa
very impacted because all was exposed via postgres views.
QGIS server was more impacted than desktop since project loading was made
too often.
That was partially solved in Server scope by writing extent in qgs file and
just read that value instead of reading from provider.
I think we still need that in desktop, but this can be a trick for others
since extent might be wrong if data was edited somewhere else.
Having some maintenance tools somewhere to refresh extent in background
task could be a path maybe.
Cheers
Régis

Hi Anatoliy,

I'm not in the position to comment on the actual problems, sorry.

But can you please try QGIS master in the same setting?

Because that is the branch where all energy is put into at the moment.
2.18 had some experimental work for compiling with qt5 but is actually 
qt4, but in current master we go Qt5 all the way...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Improve server-side compiled expressions for
	PostGreSQL
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6erTi7r5ysy4LxNrNh_kO8cWxwkKO7dHuNspM85N1EAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I usually work with PostgreSQL data in QGIS.
I would like to have a guidance on how to improve the set of compiled
expressions for PostgreSQL. My goal is to propose a PR for some spatial
function.

I think the files are here
src/providers/postgres/qgspostgresexpressioncompiler.cpp
src/providers/postgres/qgspostgresfeatureiterator.cpp

For example, I would like the following expression to be compiled server
side:

    intersects(
        $geometry,
        geom_from_gml(
            '<gml:Polygon+xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml
"><gml:outerBoundaryIs><gml:LinearRing><gml:coordinates+decimal="."+cs=","+ts="+">MY_GML_COORDINATES</gml:coordinates></gml:LinearRing></gml:outerBoundaryIs></gml:Polygon>'
        )
    )

where MY_GML_COORDINATES is the GML version of a polygon ring coords.

What are the required steps to do so, and where ? The result would be


    ST_Intersects(
        geom,
        ST_GeomFromGml( 'the long GML polygon representation')
    )

Regards,
Michaël

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Changing ergonomy of the visibility of layers
	inside groups ?
Message-ID: <201611151134.45510.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi,

I've been involved in discussions about improving/changing how visibility of 
layers (or groups) is handled when they are inside groups. Currently if you 
check/uncheck a group, this recursively checks/unchecks all its items (layers 
or sub-groups). There are workflows with large projects that include ~ 50 
layers in several groups and where users need to quicly turn on/off the 
visibility of groups, but when they don't want to change the visible of items 
inside the group. For those use cases, the layer themes functionnality has 
been tested but doesn't solve the need to be able to quickly (1 click) turn 
on/off/on/off the visibility of a group to be able to detect changes between 
raster imagery (the human eye is sensitive to movements more than colors), and 
they don't really have predefined configurations (would require creating tens of 
them)

Basically what is proposed is the following:

[ ] Group
	[x] Layer 1   --> Layer checked but group is not --> invisible
	[  ] Layer 2

[x] Group
	[x] Layer 1   --> Layer checked and group too --> visible
	[  ] Layer 2

There's a ticket https://hub.qgis.org/issues/14547 about that.

In the ticket it is suggested that the current behaviour might be preserved by 
using control-click. Control-click on a group would check/uncheck recursively 
all sub-items.

One effect of this change is that there wouldn't be anymore a tri-state for a 
group. It is either checked or unchecked. One potential downside of the new 
behaviour would be that it might not be immediately obvious to determine the 
visibility of a layer if you have several levels of hiearchy : looking only at 
the layer item if it is checked isn't sufficient to tell about its visibility. 
Not sure if that's an issue though (and if so what could be ways of indicating 
the visibility state)

At the API level, from what I can see,
* Qt::CheckState QgsLayerTreeGroup::isVisible() would be renamed to bool 
isChecked() since it would be a binary state and not related to visibility. 
I'm not sure if there are users outside of the layer tree mechanism where we 
really need to want if a group is visible (ie all its subgroups and layers are 
visible ?). Wouldn't be hard to implement anyway
* Qt::CheckState QgsLayerTreeLayer::isVisible() would be "split" into a bool 
isChecked() and a bool isVisible(). The later would inspect recursively its 
parents to figure out the final visibility state.

Thoughts ?

Even

Hey Even,

Personally I think this is a good change and handy for the use case you
mentioned.

To solve the UX of knowing if the layer is visible in a heavy nested list I
think we could grey out, or some kind of icon, for all layers not currently
on.

Thank you Even for working on this,

I think this would be a good improvement to the usability of the legend
groups.

Does it make sense to add a right-click action to maintain the possibility
of hierarchical/recursive selection of the group items?

out of its scale range of visibility (hence not visible). so it may be good
to keep greying layers when they "should" be visible but another option
makes them not rendered.

Hi Michaël,

No functions are compiled so far (afaik).

One will need to implement this in qgssqlexpressioncompiler or
qgspostgresexpressioncompiler for all the functions involved (I'm not
sure if / to what degree these functions are compatible between
different sql dialects).

Also make sure that any new function which is compiled is unit tested
(providertestbase.py) to make sure it behaves exactly the same when
executed locally and server side - across all providers.

It's a long-standing plan of mine but I haven't found the time (or
contract) for this yet...

Matthias

this is my observation on 2.14.8:

if the postgis layer is added (via the "add postgis layer" dialog)
with the "select at id" checkbox then when opening the attribute table
this is iterated one time. If the table is large browsing it is not
very snappy.

If the layer is added without the "select at id" thing, then the table
is always iterated twice before opening. If the "show features visible
on map" option is selected, the table is still iterated  twice (the
entire table, not only the records of visible features) before
opening. Browsing of large tables (once opened) is fast.

One ticket I found that may be related

I need to install QGIS 2.14 on a Windows machine. I've tried throigh
Osgeo4W but AFAICS, qgis_core.dll and qgis_gui.dll are missing. Only
qgis_app.dll is available. Is there a packaging problem?

Message-ID: <56e9d932-eb54-1f65-43bb-76d2a09e0e75@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
on 2.18, the extraction of a shp from a large (18 Mpoints) PostGIS table
takes ages, even when the user chooses to save only a small portion of
it, selecting a small extent. This seems to be due to QGIS saving only
the chosen geoms, but the whole table. On 2.14 it seems to work fine.
Could anybody confirm the it is not a local issue?
Thanks.

I'm using 2.18 on Ubuntu 16.04. I connect to a postgis database with 2.2 
million points covering the continental United States. I exported that 
to a shapefile and it took about 2.5 minutes.

Thanks for the check. My problem was that the dbf also contained records
for which the geometry was not selected, when saving only the canvas extent.
Does it happen the same for you?
All the best.

Errata corrige: also in 2.14 all the table is exported.
Thanks for any hint.

to be clear, PostGIS layers added using the option “select at id” , and then saved within a QGIS XML project file, will load from that project file very fast from then on?

Can I distribute project files with this option embedded in it, so that I might “suffer for the sake of others” and they have a pleasant experience seeing what I have authored?

Just to clarify - is this when you are saving only selected features,
or when saving using a preset extent (eg features visible in map
view)?

re-reading your post, I note the words:

"Browsing of large tables (once opened) is fast.”

yes; it is precisely that “once opened part” I am talking about, particularly when one has many views joined to a common large large geometry table..

Hi Richard,

What the trash button does is

vl.beginEditCommand( "Delete Selected Features" )
vl.deleteSelectedFeatures()
vl.endEditCommand()

This makes me think, that the "with edit" construct could actually wrap
things into a single edit command as well.

The visualisation could still be tri-state, I think

* Unchecked
* Checked (All subitems checked)
* Semi-checked (Checked but some sub-items are invisible)

Clicking would then switch between either Unchecked and Semi-Checked or
Unchecked and Checked depending on the subitems.

The approach sounds good. What do you think about integrating on both
levels (group and layer) the methods isVisible() and
itemVisibilityChecked() methods? I think this API is more verbose than a
simple isChecked().

Yes, users might not necessarily be aware of the Ctrl+click shortcut. For the 
contextual menu, I can imagine different variations:
- one item whose label&action would change according to the context. For 
example if the child groups and layers have different check state, or all 
unchecked, then it would be "Check all subgroups and layers". And if they are 
all checked, it would be "Uncheck all subgroups and layers". Downside is that 
you need to do it twice to go from the state where subitems have different 
check state to the state where they are all unchecked. But that would be 
consistent with the behaviour of the Ctrl+click action.
- have the 2 items "Check all subgroups and layers" and "Uncheck all subgroups 
and layers" always displayed (but potentially greyed if not available given 
the state of the subitems)
- or variation of the above, show 0, 1 or 2 of the items according to the 
context (0 for a group no subgroup/layer, 1 if all subitems are checked/
unchecked, 2 if there are different check state) ==> This one is probably the 
best one as it seems our contextual menus are rather dynamic according to the 
context

That might work indeed. It is just hard to imagine what is the more natural 
way of handling this. I couldn't find something similar in other applications
Let me think out loud to a scenario :-)

If we allow isVisible() for groups, it would need to be 3 state : 
TotallyVisible, PartiallyVisible, Invisible (probably better than using the 
Checked semantics directly, so we can decorrelate from how we render partial 
visibility)

Another scenario would be:

When clicking, the group toggle between unchecked, partially checked,
checked. At the same time it caches the state for all subitems to
restore the partially checked state when switching to this.

At any time, when a subitems check state is changed, all parents
invalidate their cached states and override it with the new partial
check state. If the last remaining unchecked item is checked (and vice
versa) clicking the group skips the partially checked state...

Maybe that would be more natural?

Hi all,

Jumping in... Quite reluctant at first, I think it's indeed a very nice
improvement.

Matthias' idea is quite nice and turns off my concerns.

I would prefer first approach (switching brtween partial and checked or
unchecked) as I find it more intuitive and also more practical: one
click only (I often switch on and off to make features blink).

Does our LayerTreeMaster (aka Martin) has some concerns for this change?

So imagine you have an initial state with a group G checked and its layers A 
and B checked
You click on G ==> it becomes unchecked, and A and B as well
You click on G ==> it becomes checked, and A and B as well
You click on A to unselect it ==> G becomes partially checked. And you save 
current state of A and B as StatePartial
You click on G ==> it becomes checked, and A and B as well
You click on G ==> it becomes unchecked, and A and B as well
You click on G ==> it becomes partially checked, and you restore StatePartial 
(ie A is unchecked and B is checked)
You check on A ==> it becomes checked and G as well (and clicking on G would 
switch between all on - all off)
You uncheck A --> G becomes partially checked
You uncheck B --> G becomes unchecked  (and clicking on G would switch between 
all on - all off)

Is that what you meant ? That makes sense to me.
Besides a slightly more complicated implementation, one downside would be that 
cycling between (partially)on state and off state of a group (with different 
check state of its items) would require 1.5 clicks on average (1 click to go 
from unchecked to partially checked, 2 from partially checked to unchecked) 
instead of 1. I should check with the users if they can afford the extra half 
click :-)

Thanks for your suggestions.

Following the conversation from
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/89d4998 , this is an announcement
to notify that the PyQgsOfflineEditingWFS has been disabled on the
Travis builds.

Work has been underway to remove "noisy" tests from Travis which cause
false alarms and these tests regularly fail for unrelated changes.
False alarms are bad as they undermine confidence in the CI results
and encourage contributors to ignore the test results.

If you're interested in seeing these tests continue as part of the CI
infrastructure here are some examples of typical random failures these
tests encounter:

StatePartial 
(ie A is unchecked and B is checked) 

[and earlier posts]

I don't think I agree with this. I'll try to express how I would expect it
to work:

- the check state of a group is determined entirely by the check state of
its children, and is not independent of them

- checking a group *irreversibly* checks/unchecks *all* children, and never
results in a group becoming partially checked

So:

G, A, B unchecked
Check A > G becomes partial
Check G > G, A, B become checked
Uncheck G > G, A, B become unchecked
Check G > G, A, B become checked
Uncheck G > G, A, B become unchecked

I think I just don't really like that "clicking a group restores partial"
means that some children have a stored but not current state. It just all
seems too complex, and not necessary.

It might be a problem in the test, but a segmentation fault could be a
signal of something more serious in the core on in the bindings.

, even if you reverted that single commit with no changes in the failure,
that does not imply that the test was broken.

Note that the test itself is passing.

What you describe above is exactly how it works currently, right ?

And what about the initial idea of checking/unchecking a group wouldn't affect 
the checked/unchecked state of children (except if done with Ctrl+click ?)

What you are doing right now (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3774) seems
quite promising :) Thanks!

BTW were you able to reproduce the segfault on your local machine?

Yes, that extra (half-)click is exactly the one I'm worried about when
thinking of your use-case. Was just thinking loud :P

Hi devs,
I noticed that since the 2.18 release the behaviour of the AdvancedModifiers parameter changed, and when I use (FUSION) tools all the optional switches are now mandatory to run the algs.
Is it a technical decision or a bug? How can I solve it?
Thank you in advance.
All the best,

Message-ID: <DB5PR08MB0808028C984722E1F6DB2DF8A7B10@DB5PR08MB0808.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

working with field menu (QGIS 2.14.8 OSGEO4W64) i noted a behaviour that 
i find misleading and

could potentially lead to severe errors in edit session:

say that i want to set a range for an integer field with

min value 1

max value 5

step 1

at this point i would expect that QGIS only accepts "1 2 3 4 5" and 
throw an error if i insert 6

while editing; infact if i erroneously insert "6" QGIS will not complain 
and happily save the

maximun value for range (i.e 5) i find this odd and a way to defeat the 
hole pourpose of my

setting.

I think this is a bug, can anyone confirm? If this is the expected 
behaviour i think the logic

of this tool is flawed because QGIS should not insert values at his own 
will but should instead warn the

user that the value is outside the expected range.


Thanks, Roy.

Message-ID: <CAECJsSrk5BWF1LTG8S9NzggCPqgeuQ3b9Jtxa9NvXswrQeSbHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
In QGIS 2.18, if I select a feature in the map canvas and this feature is
shown in a print composer, it's also rendered with the selection color ( I
mean, as a selected feature).

Wasn't this removed in earlier releases (https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11929)?
Actually, it happens only on my Windows machine. Tested on Mac, the
selection is not rendered in the composer.

Is it a bug or an option I may have mistakenly activated? Can someone
confirn, please?

Thanks,
Harrissou

I saw this one before, but then could never work out the exact set of
circumstances required to reproduce it. Can you get it to happen
consistently?

Hi,

Quick update. Success! I've finally built QGIS 3 master branch off of
unmodified Homebrew dependencies, though had to edit several bits of source
code and pull some hair out.

QGIS version: 2.99.0-Master
QGIS code revision: 6727ea7
Compiled against: Qt 5.7.0
Running against Qt: 5.7.0
Compiled against GDAL/OGR: 2.1.2
Running against GDAL/OGR: 2.1.2
Compiled against GEOS: 3.5.0-CAPI-1.9.0
Running against GEOS: 3.5.0-CAPI-1.9.0 r4084
PostgreSQL Client Version: 9.6.1
SpatiaLite Version: 4.3.0a
QWT Version: 6.1.3
PROJ.4 Version: 493
QScintilla2 Version: 2.9.3
This copy of QGIS writes debugging output.

and Python 3.5.2.

http://drive.dakotacarto.com/qgis/qgis3-master_homewbrew-macos-10.11.png

It's take me a bit more time to commit proper changes, create the qgis3-dev
formula and add the docs for:

https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev

Is anyone else already developing QGIS 3 master on Mac?

Nice work! I'm very keen to see if this fixes some issues we have with
OSX. Specifically, if you remove the ifdef from
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/qgscolorbutton.cpp#L505

Does the color picker work?

And if you remove
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/qgisapp.cpp#L2007

Do preview modes work?

Hi,

Today when I opened Qgis I found this message saying that the certificate
of plugins.qgis.org has expired.
Does anyone have the same problem or I have some problem on my network?

Best reggards

Yes, it's expired.

We need to renew it.

Hi Grant,

Probably my fault, I arranged a new ssl certificate for *.qgis.org but 
did not put it on the qgis server(s) yet... so current certificate is 
not valid anymore. Will do this asap...

To be more precise: during startup, QGIS is requesting the latest 
version of QGIS by requesting:

https://ubuntu.qgis.org/version.txt [0]

And that one does not have a valid certificate at this moment.

@devs: I still think this should be an opt-in option instead of current 
situation


Regards and sorry for this fuzz...

I tried but didn't succeed in a reasonable time so I left it again.

I will be happy to try the formula and have a look at the patches you
have created.

http://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/blog/2015/01/30/qgis-layer-tree-api-part-3/

but using it removes all default options, AND it is created for ALL 
layers.

Q1: is there an option to only add this menu item to certain (1) layers?

Q2: is it possible to add the new 'refresh' option on top of all normal 
default menu items?

Q3: looking at the possibility to add a 'Transparency slider' in the 
layertree (see layer props bottom item): how difficult is it to add a 
'refresh data' button (with custom refresh data code) in the layer tree

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

An edit session and an edit command are not the same thing.

An edit session corresponds to clicking the pencil button (or im python
startEditing() / commitChanges()).

During an edit session, multiple edit commands can made. They appear as
"one action" in the undo stack and some parts of the application use it
for batch processing (postpone expensive processing like updating the
feature count to the end of an edit command).

As such they should be used to group logical units - usually what is
triggered by a single click of the user.

Bests
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] DB Manager and other PostGIS issues: notes from a
	course
Message-ID: <e82eb4dc-73c8-073d-9de0-7dfb81905a10@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
just finished my latest course on PostGIS, we spotted several issues in
QGIS 2.18:

* DB Manager
  * create table: field types are limited; in particular, timestamptz is
missing
  * create table: SRID has to be entered by hand; the projection widget
should be added
  * edit table -> Table properties -> Field properties: the field
`Length` appears wrong; for geom it shows `geomtype,srid`, for
varchar(255) and others, adding a length will cause an error:
ALTER TABLE "public"."buffer_union" ALTER "round" TYPE varchar(255) (24)
length has to be entered by hand changing varchar(255) into e.g. varchar(20)
  * we got frequent errors similar to [0]

* Browser
  * importing a shapefile of points results in a (generally undesirable)
MULTIPOINT, without a possibility of choice for the user
  * a table created with SRID=0
CREATE TABLE pt
 (id INTEGER, name text, geom GEOMETRY(Point,0,2));
INSERT INTO pt (id, name, geom)
 VALUES (1, 'Origin', ST_GeomFromText('POINT(0 0)', 0));
results in two entries: one with mouseover= geom as Point in 0 and one
geom as Point in -2147483648

* Processing
  * there are two Import into Processing (one QGIS and one OGR)
  * for the first (QGIS), batch processing fails with `Missing parameter
value: Table to import to (leave blank to use layer name (row 1)`
  * for the second (OGR), it also fails because it tries to write in the
spatial_ref_sys (CRS should default to source CRS) [1]
  * the gdal output is not interpreted correctly (html and encoding) [1]

Thanks in advance for any comment. I'll open the tickets where relevant.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Best Practice for QGIS Plugin Help Documentation
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqXPxQGeqn9T4+Mv5CyCFYyfKb+p0tjyEFByqQRgVKAEg@mail.gmail.com>

As part of my plugins I want to have a Help button that displays the
documentation. What method do you recommend? I see various authors do it
differently. I see three methods for when a help button is clicked on.

1. Launch a web browser to point to the documentation on the web.
2. Have the documentation as a part of the plugin and launch a web browser
to view it.
3. Display a PyQt window with the documentation in it.

I don't consider #1 as a good option because it fails if you happen to be
disconnected from the web. What are your thoughts on #2 or #3 or do you
have a better option?

Thanks,

Calvin

Yes and no. When enabling the picker, from the new styling dock, then
clicking on the map canvas, it works great (no change in cursor to an
eyedropper, though). Guessing this is because the dock is not modal, and
the 'constraining' widget is the whole QMainWindow of QgisApp.

However, open the same layer styling as a modal dialog and there is no
picking beyond the dialog's widget. Every mouse event beyond the dialog,
e.g. over map canvas, is blocked until the mouse reenters the dialog, then
it appears to 'catch up' and samples the entry edge to the dialog. It even
does so after a short timeout, without clicking anything.

While it might be possible to disable the picker if some widget parent in
the hierarchy is modal, but this would nix the ability to work with a
rendering inside of the same modal widget (e.g. if there was a preview
inside of the widget that the user might sample).

Might be able to fake it somehow, by taking a screen shot upon choosing the
picker, then maybe getting the mouse's location and grabbing the color from
the mapped screen snap x/y, but still not sure how to get the mouse
location outside of the modal widget (though, I have not given it a try).

Could use a keyboard focus and a keystoke to do the sampling, while the
color well is updated live from the mouses x/y coords, instead of finding
some way to access the blocked mouse click events. Again, haven't tried any
of this.

Apparently. Switching modes, and back to normal, works. Not sure I known
whether what I am seeing is correct for the color-blindness settings, but
they do change the rendering of the geotiff I was testing. Would need
reference images for manual comparison.

Hi Calvin,
thanks for raising this point: I agree that having a coherent system
would be better for developers and users alike. I'd be more inclined
towards #2. Could we recommend this in the pydev docs?
All the best.

Hi Calvin

Method 2 is well supported by QGIS.  Put the help in index.html in the plugin directory, then

def showMyPluginHelp(self):
    from qgis import utils
    utils.showPluginHelp()

The showPluginHelp function will look for index.html by default, but you can specify a filename to use instead of index.
It also has a section argument which will go to an html anchor in the help file (<a name="mysection">...</a>

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/utils.py#L441

I'm not sure if this is in the PyQt developers cookbook or in plugin builder?

Cheers
Chri

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Best Practice for QGIS Plugin Help Documentation

As part of my plugins I want to have a Help button that displays the documentation. What method do you recommend? I see various authors do it differently. I see three methods for when a help button is clicked on.

1. Launch a web browser to point to the documentation on the web.
2. Have the documentation as a part of the plugin and launch a web browser to view it.
3. Display a PyQt window with the documentation in it.

I don't consider #1 as a good option because it fails if you happen to be disconnected from the web. What are your thoughts on #2 or #3 or do you have a better option?

Thanks,

Calvin

Message-ID: <CANxjxarxjan70mvn+6Ch16NM3zz+mjmKbyP3Cc0r3tViQOoeaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have installed 2.14.8 from William Kyngesburye's packages, all ok. I
noticed that almost all the algs of SAGA and TauDEM do not work.

For SAGA (2.2.3) algs I get:

/Users/slarosa/.qgis2//processing/saga_batch_job.sh: line 3: 83064
Segmentation fault: 11 saga_cmd io_gdal 0 -TRANSFORM 1 -INTERPOL 0

Error: Zone Grid

That was happening with the Zonal Raster Statistics alg. But I get the
identical error (segmentation fault) with the others algorithms.

For TauDEM algs I get systematically an "Unsupported Data Source" error:

is not a supported raster data source TIFFReadDirectory:Failed to read
directory at offset 1991676

Anyone confirms?
Can I exclude a local problem with my machine (OSX El Capitan)?

SAGA changes its API too often, and QGIS has not been adapted to work
with the SAGA 2.3.x LTS releases yet.

Thank you for your quick reply.
The issue is a segfault here and OSX package (QGIS LTR 2.14.8) bundled
with SAGA 2.2.3.
Anyway I don't see a syntax command error as mentioned from the issue
which seems was fixed, at least for the 2.2.x version.

Best Regards,

I am confused, which issue is easy to fix, TauDEM or SAGA or both? and How?
Do you were referring to your ticket (#13279)? I don't see a segfault
there though

The version I bundle is 2.2.3, not 2.3.x, and is supported by Processing.

I get the segfault when I try, details tell me it's happening when SAGA tries to get the projection info from the file.  I don't know how to fix this, and it's not a QGIS problem but a SAGA problem.  I wonder if SAGA 2.2.x is not fully compatible with GDAL 2.1, I did see an initial item in the SAGA 2.2.0 changelog mentioning GDAL 2 compatibility that "was not complete", but no other changes in later versions specifically about improving GDAL 2 compatibility.

Can you check if you have the same error when using saga_cmd without
using processing?

@William: Which compiler was used for saga on mac os x? We had an
issue with gcc6 - this looks similar. It is fixed in trunk and in
(upcoming) 2.3.2 release of SAA.

Kind Regards,
Johan

I also tried saga_cmd from shell with the following command:

saga_cmd io_gdal 0 -TRANSFORM 1 -INTERPOL 0 -GRIDS
"/Users/slarosa/MU/elevationutm.sgrd" -FILES
"/Users/slarosa/MU/elevation_utm.tif"

and it throws:

Right - if you want to modify the default menu, there is
QgsLegendInterface that you can obtain through
iface.legendInterface().

Note: most of the methods are obsolete now thanks to layer tree API,
but there are few methods for menu handling that are not available
elsewhere. Note to myself: remove QgsLegendInterface in 3.0 and move
the few useful methods to QgisInterface.

Yes, QgsLegendInterface::addLegendLayerActionForLayer(...)

Yes, QgsLegendInterface::addLegendLayerAction(...)

(but not for group nodes)

I'm using Clang 7.0.2 from Xcode 7.2.  Is the fix something that can be backported to 2.2?  QGIS doesn't support 2.3+ yet.

Hi,

With QGIS 2.16 constraints have been introduced that are able to check
entered values and provide feedback as well as prevent the user from
clicking ok:

I tried this, and indeed can create such a widget (QToolButton or 
QPushBtuuon) with a handle to a layer to do things with it.
But I can only add it to a layer in the legend via the properties 
dialog?

If I try to add the widget via the addLegendLayerActionForLayer

btn = self.refresh_button_provider.createWidget(self.measurements_layer, 
0)
self.iface.legendInterface().addLegendLayerActionForLayer(btn.defaultAction(), 
self.action_layer)

it does not show up in the legend. (the same button DOES show up (and 
works) if I do via Layer Properties/Legend dialog).

Should I be able to add such a button/action to just that layer via 
addLegendLayerActionForLayer?

Or do I miss something here?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

old issue, old as db manager, it only shows a subset of available datatypes.

see above: it has always been so in DB manager.

see above: old as db manager. If you choose a datatype with a
predefined length then manually changing the length causes an invalid
query to be run.

confirmed. This does not seems to be the case in LTR, so this
configures as a regression.

confirmed down to 2.8.* so not sure is a regression.

the OGR based tool is necessary because is the only one available that
is fast enough. It is 8+ times faster than any other tool available in
QGIS making it the only tool good enough to import into postgis large
layers.

the "table name" parameter has been incorrectly set as mandatory. This
is not the case in LTR, so this is a regression.

I will make the input/output CRS parameters mandatory.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] symbol.symbolLayer(n) triggers RTTI error in one
 place, but doesn't in another
Message-ID: <1479726231416-5296740.post@n6.nabble.com>

QGIS 2.18, qgis2web leafletRefactor branch 
(https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/tree/leafletRefactor).

- open a point layer
- change marker type to SVG
- start qgis2web
- OpenLayers 3 preview works
- click Leaflet in plugin dialog
- RTTI error

The error is triggered by:

 sl = symbol.symbolLayer(0)
(https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/leafletRefactor/leafletStyleScripts.py#L67)

However, these lines in the OpenLayers 3 export code does not trigger the
RTTI error:

for i in xrange(symbol.symbolLayerCount()):
    sl = symbol.symbolLayer(i)
(https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/leafletRefactor/olwriter.py#L851)

I just don't understand how the same method - symbol.symbolLayer(n) - can
trigger the error in one place but not in the other (with everything
identical in QGIS).

Matthias has removed the problem by removing the dependence of the SIP
symbol bindings on RTTI (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/c3852c0).
However, I still wonder if I can work around the issue, given that the
OpenLayers call to symbol.symbolLayer(n) doesn't trigger the error.

If I can work around it, I could maintain qgis2web compatibility back to 2.8
as I currently do. Otherwise, I'll have to switch to 2.18, and I don't like
not supporting LTR (or I'll have to ask for c3852c0 to be backported to
2.14).

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thanks

Tom

why the input? it should be taken from the sources, isn't it?

so in your cases html tags are interpreted?

Many thanks. I'd still like to know why the method consistently fails in one
instance, and always works in the other, though.

What's the timescale for 2.14.9?

Thanks again

Tom

Me too...
Random suspicions: different imports, different origin of the symbol
objects, different symbols in use...

Looks like this Friday is release day:

Data in QGIS exactly the same, so I don't think so.

Definitely not, for the same reason.

Assuming only QGIS imports are relevant, the working code imports iface,
while the non-working doesn't. However, importing it doesn't stop the error.

Message-ID: <a2dddf9a-8c80-13ef-098f-6ca4eb48a5c7@gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I compiled QGIS 2.18 and everything went fine except for this error that
appears when I run QGIS (each time):



Unable to open bookmarks database.
Database: /home/matteo/.qgis2//qgis.db
Driver: Driver not loaded
Database: Driver not loaded


In ~.qgis2 folder there is the qgis.db file. I tried to remove all the
qgis2 folder and/or the single qgis.db file and re-run QGIS but I always
get the same error.

Am I missing something?

Thanks to all

Matteo

Here is how to configure an embedded widget without properties dialog:

my_layer.setCustomProperty("embeddedWidgets/count", 1)
my_layer.setCustomProperty("embeddedWidgets/0/id", "transparency")

Finally one needs to call refreshLayerLegend(), e.g.:

view = iface.layerTreeView()
view.model().refreshLayerLegend(view.currentNode())

The methods from QgsLegendInterface only affect the actions in context
menu for the layer tree, they are not related to embedded widgets
functionality.

Martin

The QGIS based one is much more straightforward for the vast majority
of cases because it does not have all the advanced options that the
ogr based one has. In general I'm very much in favor of keeping
diversity in Processing.

Also keep in mind that only the QGIS one fully supports QGIS layers,
including all the available field and geometry types. The OGR one also
does not have full support for all the QGIS data providers
(mssql/db2/memory layers).

For this reason I do not want to see the native QGIS one go. I'd
rather we improved QGIS core so that writing layers is faster, and
then dropped the OGR ones ;)

Ok - that matches my experience with Qt4. Shame, I was hoping we'd get
support for this for free.

I wondered this too. But I'm not familiar enough in OSX development to
do this (and also have no personal investment here... while I'd like
to see this supported across all our platforms, I don't use OSX for
QGIS so can't justify spending time on this). Hopefully when your work
lands and it's easy to setup a build env on OSX again we may see some
of the mac developers return!

That's great news! The easiest way to check would be to test the
grayscale mode in both canvas and composer. If you can confirm this
works OK i'll strip out this ifdef.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New python packages in QGIS 3.0
Message-ID: <CAP=p+YsrfYKatF8j1OsgWDRCcuM1wyJPUsT4ypcf96hBsqufXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
     I am looking to port a few projects that exist in Python for the
transportation modeling world (complimentary to the AequilibraE plugin) ,
but they rely heavily on scientific and data analysis packages such as
Pandas.

Is there any chance new Python packages will be added to the standalone
QGIS installer for Windows? Is this list available?

Windows is by far the most used operating system in the transportation
planning/modeling world, so supporting these libraries would aind in making
QGIS the go-to place for open-source transport planning/modeling.

Cheers,
Pedro

Hi Pedro,
I agree this would be an useful addition. You can find current list here:
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/PackageListing
Please consider learning how to add it yourself, or sponsoring its
inclusion.
All the best.

Thanks Giovanni and Nyall for comments.
Certainly the current situation, having two limited tools, the
difference among which is not clear for users, is suboptimal.
Giovanni, would it make sense to hide the more complex and less used
stuff under an Avdanced section?
All the best.

Hi Martin,

a cool thanks. Will try.

I think having this kind of functionality has a lot of potential 
specially for plugin writers (examples taken from Martin's blogs or PR's):
- change transparency with a slider widget
- refresh data for this layer via a button widget
- let user choose between x predefined styles with a dropdown widget
- create a timebased subquery via a datetime-widget
- do 'something' on this layer
- layer based timeslider?
etc etc

This kind of 'components' could easily be exchanged via plugins isn't 
it? Or do you envision some other exchange mechanism?

The api for using a widget via python/code could have some love I think.

Also do you think it is usefull to have the same type of widget 2 times 
for a layer in the legend?

I'll try to add this new knowledge in the python cookbook too.

Thanks & Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Paolo,
                Thanks for the feedback. I am developing open source
transportation software as a volunteer, so I have no resources to sponsor
this effort. Open source is still not big in transportation modeling
(unfortunately), and I am not very hopeful to find resources in my industry
for such a task.

                As soon as I have a break I will look into contributing it
to QGIS myself, although I am afraid it might be way above my skill level.
To follow that route, are there any "how-to", example or list of
recommendations I could use to jump start it?

Cheers,
Pedro

good point. I do not know of an howto for this, it would be good to have.

Just more info on this issue:
I just noticed that saga commands work correctly when the SRS layers
is not projected (i.e. epsg:4326).
Using UTM projection (i.e epsg:32633) on raster and vector layer SAGA
fails with segfault.

Thanks to take in account this issue.

I'm afraid the Windows LTR nightly, with that commit, minidumps on that line
now. Removing the line stops the dump.

However, I've delved into this a lot further this morning, and I think it's
a mistake I made some months ago. The dump no longer happens if I
startRender() before it and stopRender() after it.

I'm still not getting the results I expect (symbolLayer(0) returns None
instead of QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayerV2), but at least it's a different problem
for me to work on.

Apologies if this is the problem, and I've wasted your time, and as always,
thanks

Tom

Hi Pedro,

short answer: yes you can use Pandas without problems

large answer: Pandas can be simply installed using pip from osgeo4w
shell (OSGeo4W python-pandas package is broken and probably not
maintained because the simply workaround using pip), and pip now is
already installed in OSGeo4W.
Beaware that pandas will be installed in dist_packages on the of you
osgeo installation. No way (for now) to use Pandas installed with
Anaconda because is is using a different python interpreter that that
used by osgeo4w. Btw you can link the two world using wrapping scripts
and setting pythonhome env var changing the running context.

I Strongly suggest to:

1) install pandas using pip
2) use IPython Console qgis plugin by Alessandro Pasotti where you can
have also inline graphics and qgis var instances introspection.

remember only that the IPython kernel of the IPython Console can't be
connected from external clients due to intrinsic embedding limitation.

cheers
Luigi Pirelli

	statutes
Message-ID: <2B5904BD-8324-4014-993D-80E7F332CD40@qgis.org>

Hi All

In a few days we will ask the QGIS Voting Membership to vote to approve our proposed changes to the QGIS.ORG statutes. I would like to invite any final comments about the changes to the charter.

These changes are intended to:

* satisfy the legal requirements of QGIS.ORG becoming a Swiss Verein (association)
* clarify the roles of the various participants in the QGIS.ORG governance
* make the process of becoming a PSC/Board member more democratic and transparent

For reference, our current statutes (drafted in 2015) are here:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B__vDnQXCKiwYWVCNGQxYWZsNE0

The proposed 2016 revision of these statutes is here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B__vDnQXCKiwZHdsbWt3T2syVXc/view?usp=sharing

If you would like to suggest a change to the proposed revision please use the following procedure:

1) Do NOT post the comment as a reply to this email. 
2) Email your suggestion to tim at qgis.org with [2016StatutesRevision] in the subject line
3) Specify your change by referring to the section  number, paragraph and then provide details of your proposed change
4) If necessary provide a simple accompanying explanation of why you would like to make the change

The final draft will be put forward to vote by the QGIS Voting Members on Saturday 26 November so this is just a last short window for substantive changes to the draft prepared by the PSC. If your comments / proposed changes are trivial please consider holding back your comments until next year.

Please do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions regarding the process.

Regards

Tim

Hi,

Just a quick question, I would to update OTB definitions in QGIS to upgrade

Before starting the process, I would like to know on which QGIS branch do I
need to do this, master branch or on a 2.X release branch?

Thank you advance.

Hi Manuel,

In general I think it's best to work on master branch and then backport
if applicable.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Querying PG database in current transaction group
Message-ID: <CABgOYCcC_g5Dm3AAru22=VMsMMef67184kO3o+ot=hzNgbxUcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi dev's,
We currently use a lot transaction groups (the thing hidden in project
properties) [0], so that triggers do their job on the fly and all layers
are refreshed together on each edit action, without having to manually save
edits and refresh maps.

This works very well, but sometimes we want to trigger procedures on DB's
side and we are forced to some hack by adding attribute tables and
inserting fake feature in it to trigger what we need (such as disconnect
objets, cut features, refresh some views, ..)

Is there a way to access the current transaction group from a layer in a
python layer action so that we could avoid using those fake tables? I would
like to simply reuse the current postgres connection to do some "select
my_special_function([my _args]); "

If we have a way to do that, that would allow QGIS to be a client for in-DB
service-oriented architectures.

Thanks for your lights !

All the best,
Régis

Hi Régis,

Nice to see interest in TG rising :)

transaction = layer.dataProvider().transaction()
transaction.executeSql('EXECUTE qgis.rocks()')

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Call for sponsorship for the QGIS code sprint in
	Lyon (12-13 december)
Message-ID: <92503176.1fxpDlvxcp@tatras>

Hello,

The Francophone local chapter of OSGeo organized in december a developer 
meeting for the QGIS project in Lyon.
 
This is 2 days during which the developers have the opportunity to share and 
work together on the next major QGIS release. This contributors meeting will 
make significant progress on the project.

The OSGeo-fr, organizer of the event, looks for sponsors to fund the event. 
One level of sponsorship 500 € was established. If you wish to contribute 
financially, you can make a donation on our platform: 
https://www.helloasso.com/associations/osgeo-fr/collectes/code-sprint-qgis-2016 The unused budget will be divided between the OSGeo-fr (max 30%) and 
the QGIS association (> 70% of the remainder).

If you use QGIS on a regular basis, sponsorship of this meeting is an 
opportunity to advance the project.

Your organization wants to provide financial support for OSGeo-fr to set up the 
meeting? Do you want more information? Contact us at conferences 
osgeo.asso.fr.

The deadline for this sponsor call is December 7. However we recommend that 
you contact us promptly to allow the best possible organization.
 
The OSGeo-fr team

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Python add layer to subGroup from thread error
Message-ID: <1480021818823-5297338.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

I'm developing a python plugin for QGIS and I have found an error I cannot
seem to get my head around.

I have create a QObject that is my worker class that i will pass to a
thread.
Everything is running fine but my problem is i create some layergroups.

Group 1 which has subgroup named Group 2. This i create with:
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(knude, False)
 
group = self.layerTree.addGroup("Group1")
group2 = group.addGroup("Group2")
group2.addLayer(knude)

Layer is valid and layer is added to the correct group. But when this is
loaded and i close qgis, drag the layer to another place or click new
project i QGIS i get a crash and QGIS shuts down with a minidump and
sometimes just a crash where qgis stopped working.

If i add the layer to group and not group2 from the thread every thing is
working fine. I have not seen a crash yet.

I have tried doing this outside a thread too (directly in the plugin
code/thread with gui) Here i can add the layer to group2 and can now drag
the layer, close qgis without minidump or start a new project.

Has anybody else seen the same problem with subGroups or I'm just doing this
wrong?

I'm using QGIS 2.16.3 and QGIS 2.18 (here i get a bad allocation)

Hi all,

I have made a QEP for merging all qgis2 and settings into a folder:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/82

I'm keen to work on this for 3.0 so just looking for any feedback on it,
mainly any negatives that people can see.

Sorry, I was a bit lost as I did not pull since the foss4g sprint where
there were still master and master_2 branches if I remembered well.

Thanks for your answers, what I need to do now is to install qt5 :)

Regards,

Manuel

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Any UI/UX plans for QGIS3?
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_FsgZg47Hg8=b_faiGmBPVKXQk7dPzEYGTrER3bP=951w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

QGIS 3 is getting lots of love, and we are seeing new features being added,
some legacy code being clean up, and so on. We are all aware that this will
break the 2.x API, but now it's the time for it.

So I wondered if this is not the perfect time to think about some UI/UX
changes as well, as it will lead to more work in translation and
Documentation. Could we do a list of UI/UX stuff that we could improve?

I can think of a few things:

*Consistency*
 - "search", "select" and "browse" for browsing files;
- "Add saved file to map", "Load into canvas when finished", "Open output
file after running algorithm";
- there is more of these for sure;

*Help and Documentation*
- Most of our help buttons lead to nowhere, we already talked about
pointing them to the User's Manual online (although we would need a
solution for working with it offline and in different languages)

*Defaults*
- Should default selection color not be opaque?
- Showing only selected features vertexes by default?
- Map template, we could provide a very simple template as default (I think
there was already some discussion about this); Most people I see gets very
confused when they see a completely empty page.

Yep, also from me: let's make QGIS the Desktop gis with the best UIX of 
all. Now is the time indeed!

@Alexandre: note that we closed the qgis-ux mailinglist as there was 
almost no traffic, and IF there was, we often needed input from the dev 
list so everybody started cross-posting anyway. So we decided to remove 
the ux list.

Which brings me to the point: we need devs/resources to do such things 
too. Also for me it is too easy to rethink stuff, but not able to do it 
myself it does not happen by itself...

Yep please: I should know there is some wiki page with 'wishes and 
changes' in QGIS3 but I do not have the url with me here (anybody?).

Would be good if somebody collects these idea's, and (given we can come 
to some consensus...) maybe try to do a special 'UIX'-funding round 
somewhere later in the QGIS-3 process (when api etc etc are settled)?

Coming to a consensus is maybe best done during a (big?) user or 
developers meeting?

Regards,

Richard

agreed, a targeted funding could be started. I think most of the stuff
is rather independent from API changes, so probably the two initiatives
could go largely in parallel (March is very close, as other have pointed
out).
All the best, and thanks.

I also wondered that there was no discussion about those topic for QGIS 3  
so far, so I dare to throw into the collection a topic that a while ago  
was raised somewhere:

Ribbon based menues/menue groups

This is definately a love/hate topic, but as I got used to the ribbons in  
MS-Software, I really see them now as a way to partially reduce the  
clutter, though I have no real idea how to intelligently group the stuff  
(but I'm sure enough brilliant people around here could have good ideas)
And this would really give QGIS3 a maximum of a "fresh" look.

Cheers
Bernd

Interesting. In case, better having it optional.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] UIX/Qt5 Styles on Linux
Message-ID: <5c2a4398-6c5f-9bbc-3dad-8bd3d6621cda@duif.net>

Hi,

This picture:
http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1480074074.png
shows to the left QGIS 2.18/Qt4 in which I could choose (I'm on Debian 
here) several Styles. To the right is current Master/Qt5 in which I can 
only choose between 'Fusion' and 'Windows' (last one being nice on 
windows, but really ugly on my Gnome desktop here).

I think I like the gtk+/adwaita theme better then the Fusion one in 
master, but I'm wondering if on Windows/Mac it is the same...

FYI: some googling showed me I had to install adwaita theme as a 
separate package, to make it look 'good' again:

adwaita-icon-theme - default icon theme of GNOME
adwaita-qt - Qt 5 port of GNOME’s Adwaita theme
adwaita-qt-data - Qt 5 port of GNOME’s Adwaita theme — data files

apparently with the Fusion theme Qt tries to create a 'general usable' 
style for Qt applications

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

thanks for the tip, I had the same feeling, nice to see it nice again.
Installing qt5-style-plugins adds back more styles (apparently all that
were available previously).
Perhaps the packages should be at least suggested from the package.
All the best.

Ah, yes, now I have cleanlook also again...

Adwaita misses some icons with me here by the way (screeny attached)

yes, I also noticed some overlaps and not-so-nice borders.
BTW (a long standing issue, may be worth checking it here):
the top toolbars are movable by clicking on the dotted stripe on the
left, except for the very first ones on the left, that seem "glued" to
the border: is this a know issue? A Qt one?
All the best.

Maybe I am over-simplifiyng things, but I think some of this issues are
repetitive tasks that, once learned, even a non-developer could take care
of. So maybe one needs just a gentle push from from one available
developer, and then do the rest. I would love to help in some of these.

agreed, this kind of things fall somewhat in between the aims of a dev
and those of a normal user, and are easily overlooked.

I thought I really disliked ribbons, but the ribbon interface that Marco and Sandro from Sourcepole demonstrated in Girona really appealed to me. I think if it is carefully done it could be nice. However I don't know it it makes sense for general use cases where users probably value screen real estate over big easy to click buttons. In Sourcepole's case they had a very well defined audience and specific activities they needed to perform I thought it made a lot of sense.

Adwaita is very broken for Qt apps. Eg it makes Virtualbox unusable.

I'd actually like to see us blacklist Adwaita and not allow it for use
in Qt until the theme is fixed. Given that it's the default theme in
Fedora I think it does us a real disservice and gives new users a bad
impression of QGIS being a broken app.

I love it!

Stuff like this is a great jumping in point where anyone can get
involved. It's just a matter of trawling through all the dialogs and
collating a list of strings which need changing. If that was done then
someone with commit rights could fix these in a couple of minutes. The
hard bit (and the bit where ANYONE can help) is making the list in the
first place.

Some more suggestions (which again, anyone could help with identifying):

- replacing "non standard" icons. We still have some inconsitently
used icons (such as the expression builder icon) used throughout qgis.
- dialogs which violate hig conventions:
    - use of ":" at the end of strings
    - bad tab order
    - group boxes with just one widget
- bad/inconsistent capitalisation in strings, dialog titles, and tooltips
- widgets without tooltips (or non helpful tooltips)


These are also issues for plugins, so collating lists and opening bugs
against plugins would also help.

Depends how it's done. I don't think it should always open with a
template, but including some nice templates with qgis would be a good
start.


Another idea I'd love to see for 3.0 is switching the main ui to using
monochrome "symbolic" icons. I think this could really refresh the
interface and avoid the ui from taking attention away for the content
(ie, the pretty map you're making). I tried making a script to auto
convert the icons as a test.... and ended up with a horrendous result
which had to be burned in a furnace and scattered on the four winds.

​I also liked the ​customized UI by Sourcepole but Tim is right, they had
to fit a really limited set of functionality.

Additonally, for example, the Powerpoint ribbon is as high as four rows of
toolbars on my notebook. And the ribbons cannot be arrange vertically on
the left or right side. This leaves very little map space, particularly on
notebooks.​

Another one I forgot to add (a bit unrelated):

- lots of the processing algorithms don't correctly handle z/m
geometries and the changes are often trivial to allow them to. I'd
love to see someone generate a list (based off master) of all the
algorithms which currently don't maintain z and m values and which
should.

And another big one would be to make QGIS expressions the standard way for entering expressions (thinking about raster calculator and layer filter expression dialog for example). Maybe the expression dialog should have a 'SQL' and "QGIS' mode so that it can use the same UI but constrain expressions to valid SQL if the recipient of the expression requires valid SQL.

Hi,
I want to report issues at http://hub.qgis.org/ - but I have forgot my username/password.

So now I´m in a catch22 – There is no way to get a new password – I can´t find a way to create a new login –

Do we want users to report issues – yes/no ?

If yes – it must be much easier to access a platform. Right now it is only for hardcore users who are really good at remembering passwords….

There *is* a way, check out http://www.osgeo.org/osgeo_userid (search
for "password reset").

The whole internet is like that lately, isn't it ? :)

Hi Lene,

Short story: see below to reset your password:
https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Osgeo_Userid_Help

Long story: we use osgeo-user id's (and ldap for it) because then you do 
not need to remember even more passwords :-)
We could have easier QGIS password infrastructure but in my view we 
shouldn't want this: it is better if we unite as geoFOSS community in 
both infrastructure and use of standards.

Besides this, you need some determination to create an issue anyway as 
it is best if the issuer keeps monitoring the issue and reacts on 
questions from devs...

Let me know if you have a problem resetting your password (though I 
cannot reset it for you either...), then we figure out another way to 
issue your problem.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I understand that it is very efficient and clever to use an existing  
infrastructure. But this infrastructure is set up in a typical "nerdish"  
way, so we have quite some barriers for non-nerds.

There is really the danger that the issues are misused as a helpdesk by  
users for minor stuff if it is better accessible.
But when you do not use the issues regularly, it is hard and time  
consuming filing a new one. The search for already existing issues is not  
easy. Obviously the default settings when filing a issue is, that you do  
NOT get a message when someone replies on the issue, which makes the tool  
quite useless for the lots of people who naturally expect to be subscribed  
to the thread automatically.

I rarely file bugs, though I now subscribed to all issues to at least have  
a chance to get an overview. There is huge discrepancy between what I can  
read in the mailing lists and in the reported issues. So e.g. I was really  
surprised by Giovannis yesterdays issues about regressions of OGR in the  
toolbox for LTR but haven't read anything about this somewhere before.
People already seem to accept that things are broken and silently search  
for alternatives and workarounds.

As long as the developers are happy with the tools, I don't care, but  
assistance from ordinary users in some form is not so likely as well.

Hi,

I am having problem with QGIS Server (2.14.8) which shows strange
circles (see attachment) when publishing data as WMS. The project is
prepared using same QGIS version. When I remove manually

from the project, the circles disappears. Any idea what could be
wrong? I have diagram disabled in the project. QGIS desktop renders
data as expected. Thanks, Martin

Hi Martin sounds very similar to [1]

Though it was on old qgis versions. Have you double checked that you maybe have an old version of the server running?

I wonder if Matthias (in cc) has an idea

Hi 

Just disable diagrams on the offending layer properties. The circles get added if you open a project using a newer version of QGIS then an older e.g. 2.14 LTR.

Actually, truth is a lot of developers are not happy with the osgeo
auth integration. Eg me.

I was recently in a discussion about qgis with a co-worker who had a
small suggestion about how we could improve the software. I thought
this was the perfect time to show him how to file a feature request in
the hope that doing so would help him understand better about how open
source works and how he can get involved.

So I show him hub, then watch in total embarrassment as he struggles
to find out how to register for the site. And then when he finds out
how to get to the registration page, he's asked for a "mantra".
Obviously, he has no idea what this is, and turns to ask me about it.
And I have no clue what the actual mantra is. And I know that trying
to explain to him something like "ok, now you go to irc and find
someone on this channel who knows that magic phrase..." is totally
pointless and he'll never do that.

End result - no report filed, I can't remember what his suggestion
was, he's left thinking open-source is complex and not beginner
friendly, and I'm left embarrassed because I can't even help him file
a ticket (let alone get it fixed!).

I realise that the current setup was done by hard working volunteers,
and I applaud their efforts, but the sad truth is that it's just not
working anymore and we need a better solution. :(

This is very recognizable, Nyall!

What are the options? Do other open source software projects have more 
user friendly systems for this? We could ask osgeo to implement it.

​I also liked the ​customized UI by Sourcepole but Tim is right, they had
to fit a really limited set of functionality.

Additonally, for example, the Powerpoint ribbon is as high as four rows of
toolbars on my notebook. And the ribbons cannot be arrange vertically on
the left or right side. This leaves very little map space, particularly on
notebooks.​



​Best wishes,
Anita​

Hi Nyall,

Myself I'm not so much against moving to GH issues to be honest, 
although I'm scared of the number of issues already coming in and our 
(in my view aparent) inability to handle those...

My fear (and some experience) is that the average 'user' is very eager 
to let us know his/her problem, but is not very eager to do any follow 
up work: he/she just want's it fixed. Which is good and valid, but I'm 
not sure if it fit's in our current infrastructure. Maybe I'm too 
cynical but handling hundreds of half-baken/nontech issues is where you 
leave fun/volunteer work and make it paid/not-so-fun work. But maybe I'm 
plain wrong and we should 'just do it', growing pains will show up 
anyway :-)
The vast income of nice features (which is GOOD) also seems to come with 
a lot of issues we have to handle problems with super basic GIS stuff 
(hanlding shapes/data, OGR problems, simple algorithms like 
buffering/dissolve not working correctly etc etc).
We (well... you and other devs already do) should really concentrate a 
lot on testing and quality.
Can we make this a (more important) part of QGIS 3 too? Maybe by 
cleaning up some smelling code places (looking at the QGIS startup 
process here etc etc)...

In short: it is important to keep changing/discussing these things and I 
hope the new QGIS-association is able to handle all this in a way both 
devs as users stay a happy family.

Regards,

Richard

Hi all,

It seems that whenever you have a data defined pen, the custom dashed
pattern (if provided) is not respected even when pen = 'dash'.

Shall I give another string than 'solid' to the pen, like 'custom'?

Thank you!

Hi Raymond,

the point is not to come up with options, those are there enough. Strk 
even put one in place (Gogs [0]). Problem is/was:

- the inability to come to a consensus which one to use
- the inability to determine if we need to keep history when moving to
- responsible people to actually DO it (and handle the critics that come 
from people who would have decided to do it otherways....)

Regards,

Richard

Hi

I really like the idea of having an osgeo infrastructure that is built
on top of an open source stack and gives a user a single login on all
infrastructure.

The problem seems to be, that it's just very few people taking care of
it and this situation makes it very hard to maintain a good
infrastructure. I would really appreciate if UX received more attention
also in this context (I actually think it's really important that it does).

This discussion fits with my experience so far, it seems to be quite
complicated to get up and running with the current system.

Personally I would not mind moving to a different provider if it makes
maintenance easier and improves UX.

Of course, keeping it hard to sign up reduces the amount of reported
issues. The question is if it's actually a good filter that reduces
noise. I have the feeling that we should rather encourage users to write
better reports by providing them with the required information at the
time they are writing the bug. See e.g. how we do for QField [1] with a
template and a link to the guidelines on top.

Thanks for all the good comments in this dicussion!
Matthias

Hi Nyall! Thank you for your reply.

A sex, 25/11/2016, 22:09, Nyall Dawson <nyall.dawson at gmail.com> escreveu:


I love it!

Stuff like this is a great jumping in point where anyone can get
involved. It's just a matter of trawling through all the dialogs and
collating a list of strings which need changing. If that was done then
someone with commit rights could fix these in a couple of minutes. The
hard bit (and the bit where ANYONE can help) is making the list in the
first place.


I will gladly work on that list, but I was hoping that, under the idea of
"give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you
feed him for a lifetime", with a gentle push from a developer, I could
directly fix some of the problems.


Some more suggestions (which again, anyone could help with identifying):

- replacing "non standard" icons. We still have some inconsitently
used icons (such as the expression builder icon) used throughout qgis.
- dialogs which violate hig conventions:
    - use of ":" at the end of strings
    - bad tab order
    - group boxes with just one widget
- bad/inconsistent capitalisation in strings, dialog titles, and tooltips
- widgets without tooltips (or non helpful tooltips)


Maybe I will start by gathering a list of issues to search for, before I
start looking into each dialog. Those above are all good candidates.





These are also issues for plugins, so collating lists and opening bugs
against plugins would also help.

Depends how it's done. I don't think it should always open with a
template, but including some nice templates with qgis would be a good
start.


We could have a few options when creating a new print composition keeping
an "empty" option on the top.
- Empty ()
- A4 landscape
- A4 portrait
- plus list of recent user's templates



Another idea I'd love to see for 3.0 is switching the main ui to using
monochrome "symbolic" icons. I think this could really refresh the
interface and avoid the ui from taking attention away for the content
(ie, the pretty map you're making). I tried making a script to auto
convert the icons as a test.... and ended up with a horrendous result
which had to be burned in a furnace and scattered on the four winds.


It would be nice if we could get some graphic designer to make them
distinctive enough.

Also, it would be nice if special care is taken so that they work with the
the dark theme.


Nyall

Pick your choice, try using Qt Designer and a text editor and full text
search to fix whatever you want. If you run into walls, ping me (or
someone else) here or on gitter. I'll be happy to provide you with trawl
nets if possible ;)

Any chance to ask your employer to jump in here? IIRC they also helped
with someone for the website redesign. And after the shiny charts in a
blog post from last week this could be a nice move to live up a bit
closer to the contribution share which this post pretended they hold in
QGIS ;P

Hi,

the following code is working fine in 2.x but not in master:

>>> QgsApplication.instance().argv()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.5/code.py", line 91, in runcode
    exec(code, self.locals)
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'QApplication' object has no attribute 'argv'


I looked at the sip file but I did not find the reason why it's now
failing, any idea what has changed in this regard?

Hi Alessandro,

QApplication is part of PyQt, did you check if it also changed if you
run a non-QGIS pyqt application?

Yes, it seems so:

>>> from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget
>>> a = QApplication([])
>>> a.argv()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'QApplication' object has no attribute 'argv'


In [2]: import sys
   ...: from PyQt4 import Qt
   ...:
   ...: a = Qt.QApplication(sys.argv)
   ...:

In [3]: a.argv()
Out[3]: ['/usr/local/bin/ipython']


Now I wonder if this is a PyQt bug or something changed in Qt itself

Is there anything we can do to get the argv/argc in a python script running
inside QGIS?

This is needed by the testing environment in
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-testing-environment-docker/blob/master/qgis_testrunner.py#L150
fortunately, there are some workarounds.

Just for completeness: the mantra is written in a wiki page only

Hi all,

I would like to answer this issue for my plugin : 
https://github.com/UMR-PASSAGES/DissolveWithStats/issues/2, and turn it 
into a processing subplugin. I read this : 
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/processing.html, 
but I'm still not sure how to go on.

I'm guessing that my script will be accessible from the Scripts/Tools 
part of the processing toolbox. But I don't understand :
- where these scripts are hosted, and how do I submit it
- where do I start ? Should I just make  a new version of my plugin 
without the GUI ?

Sorry if the answers are obvious !

Thanks,

Julie.

Message-ID: <d64354338aa04568b7935cef545088f4@EXCHMBX-21.cg67.fr>

Hi devs,

I found different results when I want to dissolve line vector layer by attribute value :
With Dissolve processing alg,  features are merged but with Multilinestring geometry type for dissolved cases, and Linestring geometry  for other cases.
With group by action from vector menu, all  features get Linestring type.

Is ‘group by’ behavior the right one? In such case should be  Dissolve processing alg improved?

Hello,

As someone asked it I share a concern about the code sprint: While held in 
Lyon, France and that mainly french speaking people will be present, if there 
is no native french speaking people the official langage for the code sprint 
will be english.

Following the wiki page [1], we have at least one dev that doesn't speak 
french, so the discussion will be held in english.

Thanks,

Y.

Shouldn't that be QApplication.arguments()?

http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcoreapplication.html#arguments

There's no QApplication::argv member.

Thanks, arguments() works the same as argv() for Qt5.

Do you by chance know where does argv member come from in PyQt4? I couldn't
find it in the Qt 4.8 docs, that's why I was confused. Was it a PyQt
addition? http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qcoreapplication.html#argv

Thanks, arguments() works the same as argv() for Qt5.

Do you by chance know where does argv member come from in PyQt4? I couldn't
find it in the Qt 4.8 docs, that's why I was confused. Was it a PyQt
addition? http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qcoreapplication.html#argv


I'm not sure either - it had me confused too. Maybe it was a qt3 thing that
pyqt4 was aliasing to arguments(). But there's no mention of a related
change in the PyQt5 changes.

Hi Devs (moving this to dev list),

I tested the geojson url of Phil, and if I provide username and password 
IN the url like below it works:

https://username:password at server/api/reports/sample/addresses/geojson

But without the username/password in the url, QGIS does not provide any 
authentication dialogs or so.

Is the api missing a header which QGIS needs to know there is 
authentication on it?

Or how is QGIS triggered to show authentication dialogs when provided 
basic authentication on a 'protocol'-vector layer?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <CA+Ei1Ofpex72Sg2MRyRer5c7Jxpxvi2-EiaqvbEL2BoQNJvsAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

when working with students on new QGIS plugin some questions raised.

First we use destinationSrsChanged signal from QgsMapRender (which is
DEPRECATED). We couldn't find similar signal in QgsMapSettings class.

In the code we also transform coordinates using QgsCoordinateTransform
class. It works except of user defined srs, eg. USER:100000. In this
case isValid() return False and transformation do not work.

Any ideas? Thanks, Martin

Hi Martin,

QgsMapSettings is a data only object, meaning that new map settings
objects are created from a map canvas "snapshot" for every rendering job
and therefore they don't change and don't need to (and cannot) emit signals.

That also means: map canvas is the one who manages CRS information [1].
In short:
mapCanvas.destinationCrsChanged.connect(onCrsChanged)

For the QgsCoordinateTransform question, how are you generating the
transform object? I assume with createFromWkt or createFromProj4 it
should work, but I'm sure there are people more experienced with this
part of the API out there.

Hi all,
testing QGIS master, I am noticing that the connection to PostGIS
through the browser is OK, whereas the same through DBM attempts to find
a 'g' schema, which is not there, and fails:

SELECT has_schema_privilege('g', 'CREATE'), has_schema_privilege('g',
'USAGE')

Is this a local problem?
All the best.

Hi Richard

usually would be triggered by the signal

http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qnetworkaccessmanager.html#authenticationRequired

signal and listeners are registered here:

Hi,

Yes it would really be awesome if the UI also got it's share of work. There
were so many new features added to QGIS on every last version that some
parts of the UI suffered and would really benefit from being rethought a
bit more globally.


I would add this to the list:


- Consistency when creating layers. Currently each provider type has a
slightly different ui. Also it's not possible to create certain type of
layers from the ui (eg csv layers) even if they are now well supported.

- Go through all .ui files and make sure all elements are well aligned and
have correct size policies. On small screens it happens to have windows
that don't scroll correctly (so that you can't click on the OK button).

- The style/symbol dialog for vector layers got really complex. Quite a lot
of features were added over time and the dialog is now pretty confuse.
There is an old thread were we discussed it, I think a lot of the points
still hold. The thread wes "Redesign vector layer style dialog - Was:
Redesign stylemanager", I don't find it online though ?! This issue lists
some of the points of the threads : https://hub.qgis.org/issues/7556

- We also already discussed that, but I find the difference between a layer
and a datasource is not made clear enough in the UI. The most critical
place where this confusion happen is the ability to modify columns of
vector data from within the layer properties window. I think the
distinction between these two concepts should be made more obvious in the
UI : have places where you modify data representation (the layer properties
window), and places where you modify actual data (the attribute manager).


Cheers,

Olivier

agreed. I'd add along this line that:
* the duality of DB layer management between the browser and the DB
Manager is a source of confusion; this is a complex task, but it would
be great to unify the two somehow
* the duality of adding layers through many different dedicated buttons
and through the Browser seems useless; my preference goes to the unified
Browser, adding the missing features to it.
All the best.

Hi all,
another oldish part of our UI is the "handle bad layers" dialog.
The UI win is having the project opened with just a warning, and the layer
greyd + a red warning symbol + a way to change datasource in layer
properties.
I know, it is very ArcXX - like :)

Hi Mathieu,
thanks a lot for the cleanup. I just tested it[0], and I would like to
add a few notes:
* selecting "Edit color ramp" does nothing if a ramp is not selected;
the menu should be inactivated then
* maybe this is the right time to add some very useful colour ramps (at
least one DTM)
* IMHO the default for `Create a new color ramp...` should be cpt-city,
not gradient
* this might be the chance to rename cpt-city: it would be bad to miss
the credits to the original website[1], but the name is really arcane
for most users
All the best.

is it appropriate to file tickets on master, or better wait until it is
more stabilized?

Paola,

Thanks for testing. To answer to your notes:
* Good point on the "edit color ramp..." menu shortcut, I'll fix that
* >1 week ago, I revamped the default symbols, we could also revamp the
saved color ramps (and highlight a few excellent ones via favorites)
* I'm a definite -1 for changing default type from gradient to cpt-city,
the color gradient editor dialog is much, much better the work with (by
default) than the cpt-city preset picker dialog
* +1 to rename the cpt-city ramp type to something that'll be understood by
more than a few dozen individuals on earth ;-P

great, thanks

IMHO a DTM is badly missing. please have a look also to the GRASS ramps
embedded in cpt-city - some of them are really useful, e.g. ndvi,
corine, aspect.

> * I'm a definite -1 for changing default type from gradient to cpt-city,

agreed it's better, even too good ;)
my point is that with gradient users tend to create overcomplicated
palettes, that are not appropriate for sound cartography; that's why I
suggested to put them one step away from users. but I accept your choice.

> * +1 to rename the cpt-city ramp type to something that'll be understood

good; perhaps we should put credits somewhere else.

Thanks again.

Thanks for the feedback Arnaud. Ticket opened, not to forget:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15910
In general, the duplication of functions between DB Manager and Browser
is not a good thing IMHO.
All the best.

​Many of the prettier ones (e.g.
http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/wkp/template/tn/wiki-2.0.png.index.html)
are
also very difficult to use because we have no way to specify where the
border between blue = under sea level and green = above sea level is in our
raster values.

Best wishes,
Anita

agreed many are unsuitable, but others are really precious: I spend
hours to design the CORINE one, years ago, and in Europe this is a must.
NDVI is also tricky. Perhaps we could divide them in two sections, or
simply include all the useful ones in the default?
Anita: agreed some are very difficult to use - ideas for improvement?
Thanks for the comments, I think we are greatly improving usability here.
All the best.

Ok - I was a bit harsh here. I think the problem is that the good ones
are buried in ones which are totally useless. I'm referring to the
ramps like the different country flags, multiple variations on black
and white stripes, and things like banded "christmas candy" ramps.
Maybe we should curate a list of good ones and only show those at
first, rather then the "all ramps" category.

Hi all,
is it worth the while to keep NVIZ in QGIS3?
All the best.

-------- Messaggio Inoltrato --------

Hi
In the older version of QGIS the GRASS module nviz worked fine under
2.2. Now I tried it under QGIS 2.16 & 2.18 and it does not work. It
opens a window showing what it is processing (like a flash) and then
when the 3D model has to open in a new window ........nothing!
Hope somebody can help me.

Thank you
Strumbi

+1. I'm OK with a solution other than the Arc way, but the current
handling of bad layers is definitely in need of a rethink.

Actually, I don't dislike the dialog of handlings bad layers. Maybe keeping
the layers could be a setting in that dialog. Another cool thing is if once
you correct one layer data source, it would be smart enough to fix layers
in a similar data source.

Am I remembering correctly that imports via DBManager also don't
handle z/m geometries? Seems like that should be an easy fix too.

I'll volunteer to identify the offending processing algorithms. We're
talking QGIS algorithms, right? Not from GRASS or other providers? I
might need some guidance but it seems pretty straightforward.

I think I'd be OK with that. My biggest problem is wanting to keep the
layer in my map document even if the reference is bad so that I don't
lose styling or other information.

Also +1 for intelligent fixing of layers with similar data source.

Hi,

Another update. I have crafted a 'qgis3-dev' Homebrew formula:
https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/blob/master/Formula/qgis3-dev.rb

See README for basics on building the formula:
https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev

For those devs/testers with a ready-to-go Homebrew setup:
`brew tap qgis/qgisdev`
`brew info qgis3-dev` (to review options)
`brew install -dv qgis3-dev <extra options>` (though try without options
first)

Takes ~ 18-20 mins to build on a newer Mac with 8 cores. There is a long
pause when compiling src/core/qgsxmlutils.cpp (not sure why it happens only
for a Homebrew formula).

Note: there are definitely macOS-related bugs in the resultant QGIS.app.
Please report them as QGIS bugs, unless you think it is related to the
formula, then report on github tracker for homebrew-qgisdev repo.

If you have the time, please test this and contribute however you can.
Thanks!

I am working on a 'qgis3-travis' formula, specific for use in main QGIS
source tree Travis CI testing. Also working on an updated tutorial for
using Qt Creator 4.1, etc. to develop on QGIS source based upon these
formulae Homebrew dependencies (much easier now).

As well all agreed on need to rename the new color ramp categories, let me
put forward new names and ordering:

--------------------
*Current:*
Gradient
Random
ColorBrewer
Preset colors
cpt-city

*Proposed:*
Gradient (stays the same)
Palette (instead of Preset colors)
Presets: cpt-city (instead of cpt-city)
Presets: ColorBrewer (instead of ColorBrewer)
Random (stays the same
--------------------

Does that sound good with you guys?

I'll leave the comments to native English speakers.
BTW:
* how about changing the names of renderers? I never found Singleband
etc. names particularly enlightening
* why keeping activated the multiband renderer also for singleband rasters?
* why keeping the Band dropdown whan there is only one band?
* what is the Paletted renderer supposed to do?
Thanks a lot.
