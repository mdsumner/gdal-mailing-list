Hi,

I miss the plugin_builder.py in the src/plugins/ in ltr-3_4.

The last I found was in 2.18 but this doesn't work for me because the 
version of Qt has been changed.

I need an example for upgrading my plugins, thanks for a hint.

Hi,

Just a little mail to ask if the LTR version will come back because we have
over 300 users waiting for a Computer Update but we can't do it if we can't
use the LTR version of Qgis.

We don't see any communication about the suppression of LTR version for
openSUSE repos.

Message-ID: <CAEh5jtFZhn_PUPdjaArCD598sdRWU3Up9Agdj=X8L+48ib8AdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

My name is Ismail Sunni, I am from Indonesia. Currently, I am studying in
Germany for my master degree. Since I am now a student, I want to
participate in this year Google Summer of Code for QGIS. I am interested to
contribute and work on the 3D improvement
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2019-Ideas#qgis-3d-improvements>.
It's still young and I think that I can help with making it more complete.

I have discussed with Martin Dobias for a more detail idea and start my
proposal. Now, my proposal is more or less ready (according to me). But it
would be better if I get some feedback or suggestions from the QGIS
community itself. Since it will give impact to the community.

If you are interested, you can check my proposal in this URL:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RcXiEyziQyGurqDGRBN3g-het33liVD81WFjv8qQlt8/edit?usp=sharing

Please don't be hesitate to make a comment either in this email thread or
even in the document itself.

Thank you

Best regards

Regarding on-screen navigation, it'd be good to think of an implementation
that would work for both 2D as well as 3D map canvases when conceptualizing
the way ahead (I'm not suggesting you implement this as part of this GSoC
plan, just seeding the idea as it might shape way you move forward). It'd
be useful in a few places across QGIS to have some ultra basic zooming and
panning controls attached to a qgsmapcanvas.

Always nice to see some more love thrown at our 3D support :)

Great proposal Ismail -- all these features would be lovely to see!

Reading over the billboard proposal, I'd strongly suggest that you
re-use QGIS marker symbology here to render the actual billboard
content. Amongst other benefits, this would allow re-use of identical
symbols between 2d and 3d maps.

Best of luck with the coding!
Nyall

Thank you Nyall!

Sorry for replying so late but I suddenly went on a busy 2 week trip abroad.

Last HF martin and I discussed the current geometry model and some of 
the flaws and weird things. Especially the set() and get() are not very 
logical function names to me.

To find out about the model I tested it using a script in the qgis 
python console. I'm still using it often to figure how to create and 
convert geometries. Hope it helps others as well. Would be nice for the 
cookbook maybe.

Kind regards,
Raymond

Hi Ismail, 

Looks nice - thanks for the proposal. Hopefully it will be accepted! 

I'd love to see all of these improvements, esp. the billboard ones -
because currently there is no way to properly label something in 3d. 

I added a suggestion for the billboards: Allow leader lines between the
original point feature and the billboard location above the point
feature, with a configurable vertical offset (best also data-defined).
It would help better locate the position of the actual feature that is
labeled. 

------------------------- 

There are two other ideas regarding QGIS 3D: 

 	* allow highlighting of objects in 3D when using the Identify tool.
Currently one can pick an object in 3d and query the attributes, but
there is no visual feedback what object was actually selected. perhaps
with the new line rendering that Martin is currently working on, this
could be used to draw a red 3d outline of the object picked?
 	* allow a per layer (or per category) wireframe mode for 3d polygons
and terrain (in order to be able to look through the terrain or 3d
objects).

I understand that this would be too much for the GSOC proposal, but
nevertheless I would like to mention those here, as I think they are
important. I totally understand, of course, that they are too much for
the GSOC proposal. 

Thanks and good luck, 

Andreas

Just to add more thoughts to this... There is obviously a lot of
confusion regarding geometry API in QGIS since the big refactoring.
Things like QgsGeometry vs QgsAbstractGeometry ... or QgsPoint vs
QgsPointXY. I would say some bits are fixable without too much effort
(e.g. add some missing convenience constructors), but most bits will
need to wait until QGIS 4.0 (e.g. getting rid of methods
accepting/returning QgsPointXY within geometry API).

One idea that I wanted to explore is whether we could avoid having
QgsGeometry in the Python API at all, so it would be a mapped type
like QVariant is in PyQt5. So for example, feat.geometry() would
return directly QgsPoint or QgsLineString. This would avoid the need
to extract the internal geometry object from QgsGeometry and vice
versa (wrap internal geometry object into QgsGeometry). I have not
tried it in practice yet though and it will definitely be an API
break, but if it works, it should simplify things a lot :-)

Cheers
Martin

I can only add that I am also happy that Ismail would like to

the proposal looks great.

Have you asked the question of the openSUSE maintainers, as presumably 
they maintain the listed repositories, download.opensuse.org

Hmm, yeah, I will think about it in the design. I agree, if it can be used
on other part, it will be better for sure.

 Hi Nyall,

Great proposal Ismail -- all these features would be lovely to see!

As Martin said, it's a good point. I will be happy to re-use existing code,
I think it's a win-win solution.

Thanks, Nyall

Yeah, regarding the billboard, that's one of the common use cases that
Martin and I discussed. So it's under my radar to have something like that
in the implementation. Btw, thanks for your comments in the Google Doc.

Those two ideas are interesting and should be implemented somehow in the
future. But as you said, perhaps it's too much for the GSoC proposal :). I
can't promise, but who knows what will happen in the future :)

I can only add that I am also happy that Ismail would like to

Thanks for your help and guidance, Martin :)

Nice proposal Sunni! On the Mac the 3d window is a bit of a pain because it is a dock window so cannot be maximised easily and when you do resize it it tends to dock into the main window so it always makes it a bit clunky in demos. It would be really nice if it either replaced the main 2d map canvas or was possible to use it as a normal window instead of a dock widget so you can easily maximise it.

Oh and then please implement some kind of star wars tie-fighter vs x-wind chase through my neighbourhood game as an Easter egg in it :-)

Regards

Tim

Not sure, but I think Otto (in bcc) has something to do with it, or
maybe he knows the actual packager?

Dear Susann,

you have to install plugin builder plugin frm QGIS 3.4
Go to Plugins/Manage and Install Plugins in the menu and search for Plugin 
builder.

There are sources how to upgrade plugins:

Hi,

This is in part because SQLite (what GeoPackage is built around) doesn't 
do character limits on text fields. You can declare them, but SQLite 
just ignores them.

That said, the GeoPackage format does allow for them:

"... The optional maxchar_count
defines the maximum number of characters in
the string. If not specified, the length is
unbounded. The count is provided for
informational purposes, and applications MAY
choose to truncate longer strings if encountered.
When present, it is best practice for applications
to adhere to the character count. Stored as
SQLite TEXT"

So I'd suggest that QGIS simply not declare text limits on string fields 
by default for GeoPackage, and only declare them when they're explicitly 
declared (i.e. in the original data format).

Cheers,

Jonathan

Hi Tim,

Nice proposal Sunni! On the Mac the 3d window is a bit of a pain because it

Ah really? I can't remember get that issue in Mac before. (un)fortunately,
I am not using Mac anymore, so I am not sure if can help with that. Perhaps
Peter can check it :)


Oh and then please implement some kind of star wars tie-fighter vs x-wind
> chase through my neighbourhood game as an Easter egg in it :-)


Haha, nice idea! Let me check if I prefer star wars or Avengers :D

Thanks also for your comment in the Google Docs.

Best Regards

Hi,

I also had some similar issues while testing the 3D window on W10 with 
QGIS 3.6.1 :
- sometimes, the 3D window loses its controls (no title bar, no status 
bar), but I get them back if I resize the window with the mouse (on 
click release)
- the 3D window appears in View -> Panels menu, but not in the 
contextual menu (right click in the empty toolbar zone)
- if I uncheck the 3D window in the View -> Panels menu, it is closed 
and I can't get it back
- I had crashes while trying to dock a new 3D window in an existing one 
(which normally create a new tab)
- it would be great to be able to minimize 3D windows

Kind regards,

Thanks for your advises,

but this is only for python plugins and I need to update my c++ plugins.
I have read that deploying plugins in c++ is a bit undesired so I think 
there is no template available at time and also it will not be prepared in 
next future?

Dear Susann,

you have to install plugin builder plugin frm QGIS 3.4
Go to Plugins/Manage and Install Plugins in the menu and search for Plugin 

builder.

There are sources how to upgrade plugins:
https://gisforthought.com/updating-a-plugin-from-qgis-2-to-qgis-3/
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Plugin-migration-to-QGIS-3
https://github.com/gc-i/wntOS/wiki/QGIS3Port
https://new.opengis.ch/2018/04/13/porting-qgis-plugins-to-api-v3-strategy-and-tools/


Best regards,
Zoltan

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problems Display properties with html and imatges
Message-ID: <CAGvsbY5F7+PfmTPWQ_SohburipjX853e7LffjvtJke3JRGsvjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi dev,
I noticed that QGIS 3.4 & 3.6 only for Windows, Display's properties
doesn't work
It's not work when we use HTML Mat Tip for show one image

For example:
*<style>*
** {margin: 0px; padding: 0px}*
*</style>*
*<img src="http://flags.fmcdn.net/data/flags/w580/ca.png
<http://flags.fmcdn.net/data/flags/w580/ca.png>" width="400" height="300"/>*

The same expression We've used for define one Action, and we don't have
problems

On Linux is alright.

Is it a known error?

You could use the core plugins in src/plugins[0] as examples and compare them
to their QGIS2 pendants[1] - and [2] for the API changes.

great proposal... I strongly second you.

I¡m expecially interestd in point cloud visualization (not necessarily
processing).
I agree with nyall to reuse marker point symbology, btw I would suggest to
investigate also visualization strategies applied in other QT based sw like
cloud compare.
Ismail, Is it possibile to add a reserch aspect to evaluate this point?

cheers

Thanks Ismail for the proposal, looks great.

re Mac: I have also issues when undocking & docking 3d view. I suspect it
is qt bug with rendering of OpenGL panels. There is already ticket in the
tracker for the issue.
re Point clouds: The amount of work to make it happen in 3D is heavily
outside of GSOC scope, so maybe can we open another discussion on this
topic if you are interested?

Cheers,
Peter

FYI,

QGISSweden (local branch) decided to fund the porting of the FUSION-plugin into QGIS3. It should become available from the QGIS plugin repository sometime soon.

Hi Nic,

I got an estimate from a developer what the cost would be to port FUSION to QGIS3 (Around  1000-1500 Euros). I will now proceed to see if I can get funding for this from my organisation or from QGISSweden. If anyone else want to contribute, do not hesitate to contact me.


thanks,

Fredrik

Hi Frederik,

the lidar tools provided in qgis 2.x has been splitted into lastools and fusion/ldv.

If the first has a maintainer, the second unfortunately doesn’t; one year ago, a core dev told me that it’s not in the plans. I wrote some of the scripts for the 2.x version but I’m not a programmer and I have no idea how to migrate the whole thing.

If you know how or you know someone who knows how to do it, I think it’s just a matter of asking for the access to the repository.



HTH,



Nic

Dear all,

Does anyone have any plans for making a plugin for the LiDAR tools included in FUSION/LDV for QGIS3?

This was available in QGIS2 but has not been migrated to QGIS3.


best wishes,

Message-ID: <0bd2d349-d912-4848-1f3b-16a31ddb29fc@duif.net>

Hi,

Working with Time Ranges, I often wanted a 'double slider', now I found
this one:

https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-controls2-rangeslider.html

And was wondering if it would be possible to use that slider in for
example a dock-widget or a plugin or in ‘Layer Tree embedded widgets’ [0]
Anybody an example of mixing qml with QGIS? I'm aware of creating a full
ui with QML, but if anybody has pointers for 'mixins', please let us know.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Point cloud rendering is mentioned there because the 'billboards' 3D
rendering technique can be reused for point clouds as well - but it
wasn't the intention to implement a point cloud visualizer there
(although re-reading the proposal, it can give such impression).

@Ismail - maybe that point in your proposal could be removed to avoid
confusion about the scope of the project... or it could be
reformulated that it would "just" prepare the ground for point clouds
rendering sometime later.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GDAL and microstation dgn v8 files... Teiga ?
Message-ID: <13dc1576-24b5-02f9-ad0e-55934e69ef04@duif.net>

Hi,

Here in NL a lot of municipalities still work with Microstation, so
dgn-files are a common format to use.

FME is capable of converting dgn to whatever format.

But we just found that gdal also has a dngv8 driver [0], but it needs to
be build against the Teiga driver.
QGIS can import autocat dwg/dxf files, I forgot what lib was used for that.

Anybody experience with building GDAL with Teiga?

BUT: want/could we use this to create a QGIS which is capable of loading
dgn or importing files?
Or is there an licensing or technical problem?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

For Linux, use the following switches for configure:

  --with-teigha=path Include Teigha DWG/DGN support
  --with-teigha-plt=platform Teigha platform

Like:
--with-teigha=$HOME/Teigha_lnxX64_5.3dll --with-teigha-plt=lnxX64_5.3dll

For Windows, locate the TD_ variables in nmake.opt and tweak them.

Sure, that works (except automatic styling) if you use a GDAL with Teigha 
support

> Or is there an licensing or technical problem?

No technical problem per se. Regarding licensing, Teigha is of course 
proprietary. I don't recall the terms, but I guess QGIS.org or any other 
distributing entitee would have to pay a fee to be able to redistribute a 
plugin using their SDK.

Thanks Even, I'll give it a try, IF I can find the lib (for free)...
Any pointers to the current library download?

I'm not able to find a sdk link at
https://www.opendesign.com/
Though the pricing page
https://www.opendesign.com/pricing
seems to tell: only for selected universities it is free, and only for
non-commerical use ("in house") for $250.

>From Juergen I see that we use libdxfrw for dxf import..

Anyway, maybe a 'business' opportunity for 'commercial packagers' ? :-)

Hi Richard,

Interesting topic!

Just for the reference - I think about 3-4 years ago we discussed the 
same thing: using Teigha for reading/writing dxf and dwg.

Back then, I was suggesting the exact same thing like you: using Teigha 
- but due to the proprietary license and packaging issues, there was a 
lot of opposition towards using Teigha. You have to be a member in the 
OpenDesignAlliance and pay a membership fee for being able to 
distribute/package the Teigha libraries.

We even did a crowd funding for dxf/dwg support back then: 
http://blog.qgis.org/2015/12/08/crowd-funding-project-for-reading-cad-documents-in-qgis/

During that project it was decided to use the libdxfrw library instead 
of Teigha. I believe that Jürgen forked and/or improved that library a 
lot during the project.

Jürgen can tell you all the details about it.

Greetings,

Andreas

Hi Luigi,

Yeah, like Martin and Peter said, it's out of the scope of the proposal.
Martin and I actually discussed it also. But I agree, after reading it
again, it does give a hint that I will implement that. I think it's better
to remove it for now and focus on the most common use case one. What do you
think?

Hi Sigeal

I also had some similar issues while testing the 3D window on W10 with QGIS

I will check it, but not sure will add it to the proposal. I also wonder
that there is no minimize 3D windows. I think it will be great if we can
have a list of 2D and 3D view that we can close and open later.

Thanks for all your comments :)

Best regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Behaviour of GetLegendGraphics in case a custom
 static legend is provided
Message-ID: <bd3391672f0335158b46523dd4e440d3@carto.net>

Hi, 

In QGIS there is the option in the "Layer Properties" --> "QGIS Server"
--> "LegendUrl" to provide a custom legend. 

We noticed that, while QGIS Desktop as a client loads and displays this
alternative legend, if a single WMS leaf layer is requested, that the
custom legend is not delivered when doing a GetFeatureInfo request on
that specific layer. It is also not used when asking for a
GetLegendGraphics of a whole group or the whole project. 

I'd like to discuss if this is the intended behavior or not? 

While I understand that it would be much more complicated to integrate
this custom legend into a generated legend (the generated legend would
have to split into peices and then merged with the custom legend), I
think this is what the users would expect. They spend a lot of efforts
on a nice custom legend (matching the rest of the automatically
generated legend) and then GetLegendGraphics respond isn't even using
this legend? At least my users are disappointed. 

-------- 

Alternatively, I think, if we improve the GetLegendGraphics in the
future, there might hardly any need for custom legends. But in the
current state ... 

What we miss in the GetLegendGraphics is mainly the following: 

- get a proper legend for text labels (currently, nothing is displayed,
just the layer name) 

- in addition / or alternatively, it would be nice if a legend for a
given layer could be suppressed. In many cases a legend for a certain
layer is quite useless. A layer may even be rendered with a "no symbol"
renderer to allow querying invisible features. 

Thanks for a discussion on this topic. 

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Why was selection tool behaviour changed in 3.x?
Message-ID: <CAMW5rYKh8wb1T7TVRF6EXHdspLHRj+pdM1anhMnQ7hSQpdbJ3A@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering why the selection tool behaviour in 3.x was changed from
the implementation in 2.18?

In 2.18.x when you wanted to select features in a layer, you clicked the
primary mouse button, held it, and moves the mouse cursor over the items
you wanted to select - known as "click and drag". To help, a shape was
drawn on screen for the user to know what they had already dragged the
mouse over top of. To add to the selection you used shift plus click and
drag, to remove, Ctrl plus click and drag. It the way select tools work
broadly across computer world and is intuitive because of it's ubiquity -
learn it once, use it everywhere.

In 3.x, however, instead of using that common method, it has changed to
click and release and move the mouse around. This is a common UI method to
set focus to an item for subsequent actions but still be able to move the
mouse around without selecting or affecting any other items. I know things
would work slightly different in QGIS because of having a distinct
selection tool that one must activate, but this removes intuitiveness from
the application and makes it more difficult to use without any
corresponding gain in functionality.

A similar change has also happened in the vertex editor where in 2.18.x
single clicking on a vertex used to mean select, and you had to drag (click
and hold) to move it. Now, if you click and release, it unexpectedly drags
the vertex around as you move the mouse.

QGIS having it's own, non-standard mouse actions for tasks that are common
(select, copy, delete, etc…) across all types of data (text in a
wordprocessor, frames in a movie editor, features in a map editor, etc…) is
counter-intuitive and confusing, especially if those non-standard actions
are already commonly used for other common user interface actions.

It's almost like the QGIS development team has decided that Ctrl+V will now
mean "Cut", Ctrl+X will mean "Copy", and to copy have to use Alt+F1 for
"Paste". Extending common user interface actions for something in QGIS that
has no exact parallel but is still conceptually similar to that common
action, like how Ctrl+Alt+V means paste what was copied into the buffer
into a brand new layer, that makes sense. But ignoring decades of common UI
actions that are in the muscle memory of probably all users makes the
programme frustrating and tedious to use as one has to constantly remind
themselves that QGIS is different.

I think you are left with the choice of either doing the package
yourself, or hire someone to do it. Of course you can always compile
qgis yourself, it shouldn't be too hard if the dependencies are properly
packaged.

Just curious: why should we invest money for Apple packaging and not for
SuSE packaging?

I think we should be inclusive and supportive for all users on all
platforms.

Seems to be related to the authentication manager. Is this a known

There is a (common) problem with that text
and your reply that is increasingly giving
my headaches when thinking how to advertise
QGIS among colleagues:

Quote (from the URL above):

"unlike the commercial GIS offerings"

This suggests that QGIS is a non-commercial
project.

But a few lines further down we read:

"either organisations who offer commercial QGIS
support"

"if you hire a core QGIS developer to make your
changes"

These are clearly commercial offerings/activities,
and people are being advised to make use of them.

To be clear: I don't think there is anything wrong
with that. But I think that it is misleading to
present QGIS as "non-commercial". It is open
source and non-proprietary, in the sense that no
single individual or institution owns the rights
to it. But commerce is clearly part of QGIS now.

As I see it, there are two "honest" options:

(1) Stop calling QGIS non-commercial and keep
advising people to hire developers for fixing
bugs and implementing features.

(2) Keep calling QGIS a non-commercial project
and stop advising people to hire developers
to fix bugs or develop features for them.

Best,

Ben

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Why was selection tool behaviour changed in
	3.x?

Hi Cory,
I must say I didn't notice any difference on the selection tool behavior on
my side.
I don't think there was any explicit attempt to homogenize the selection
behavior with the node tool new ergonomy.

Just a check, in the maptool dropdown list for selection tool, are your
using the freehand selection tool or the classical clic and drag selection
tool?

I've seen similar surprising issues with the new "identify" tool that now
can interrogate features in a polygon. Users got confused when they changed
this behavior by mistake. Could that be your case?
Cheers
Régis

Yep. There's a tool which may be of use:

Yes, there was some prototyping done a couple years ago that confirmed there 
was a high chance to be able to produce a GDAL raster driver to open 
FileGeodatabase raster (without using the ESRI SDK, that doesn't offer this 
capability). Mostly waiting for an interested party to develop/fund it.

For now, I'm actually trying to do it myself... for up to 200+ users in my
company.

A valid rpm package was available on repositories and suddenly disapear and
i've found no explication.

Some dependencies required by Qgis were provided by Qgis repository and...
disapear.

There is no objection to dev or anything we can do to improve Qgis but
there is a point that we can't count, the fluctuant repository to install
packages and that mean if we finnaly build a proper rpm , we'll distribute
it by our on way because we can't predict what apend in the future.

Hi Yann
We are tallking about going towards official docker for desktop use here :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/142

It might be an option, I have all my QGIS versions running with this option
on Ubuntu, just because running different versions at the same time is a
pain in Linux. We do this frequently for production uses with QGIS server,
and it seems to be working with Desktop, though we still need to test and
document it thoroughly. Of course other container options are here (flapak,
snap, conda) and I just can't give any advice on these other options as I
don't use them.
The other option is to support (in the long term) someone to package QGIS
for Suse.

Cheers Régis

Message-ID: <DB7PR04MB5164E444553D83133BC7C6CBA72C0@DB7PR04MB5164.eurprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,
I need to add an online service (Bing/google aerial) as a background map in my project.

Using those offered in the OpenLayers plugin I get the following error “Printing and rotating of Javascript API based layer is currently not supported” and, therefore I’m not able to keep any of these layers saved in my project.

Using QuickMapServices, instead, I’m not able  to download the “Contributed pack” because I get this error: “Attribute error: module ‘sys’ has no attribute ‘exec_type’ “.


It is a pain for normal use but this has quite bad consequences when I decide to use that project on Qfield. Am I missing something? Any other suggestion?
I’m using LTR 3.4.6 on W10.

Sorry for the re-post, but I got no reply on users-list.

Many thanks in advance for your help

Nic

Hi Niccolò,

Have a look at this gis.stackexchange.com answer for a QGIS only, no
plugin possibility. This also offers maximum compatibility with
printing, rotating and QField.

Hi, folks,

Longtime QGIS user but recent listserv subscriber here with a question
about macOS installs of QGIS 3.x. I could not find this question in recent
archives, so here goes:

When I installed QGIS 3.x recently on macOS Mojave, the required Python 3.6
install from Python.org severely mucked up my existing Homebrew Python 3.
I've discussed similar issues with colleagues who've experienced the same.

I'm curious whether it's possible to direct QGIS 3 to reference an existing
Python 3 install other than the one from Python.org? Would this be possibly
considered as a new feature, if not?

Beyond that, if anyone has found a good guide to managing Homebrew Python
alongside the Python.org install, I'd appreciate that.

I've been told that installing QGIS 3 via Homebrew is also an alternative,
but I haven't tried and would appreciate thoughts there.

Thanks,
Anthony DeBarros

Hi Paolo,

Might I suggest that you consider that not everybody has time to go an
learn the codebase of QGIS to be able to know where to start for making
changes themselves, even if they happen to know C++? Especially if they
have to learn the Qt framework at the same time.

That consideration might be better than a snarky reply to a polite inquiry.
Just saying.

I don't believe Paolo's reply was ever intended to be snarky. Instead,
he's just trying to inform you of how development occurs in
open-source projects like QGIS in order to empower you to be able to
get this bug fixed.

Hello Nyall,

Oh, I am well familiar with the vicissitudes of getting work done in open
source projects - It's why I have donated to many opensource projects over
the decades that I have been using them, including QGIS. But just telling
people "go fix it yourself" is not helpful. To be frank, it makes me wonder
if I should have made that donation elsewhere rather than making me willing
to contribute to the project by trying to fix a bug or two instead. How do
I know that I wouldn't just get another snarky brush off were I to ask for
help because my lack of familiarity with the QGIS codebase and the Qt
framework?

Hello Régis,

Sorry for not being clear - I mean when using the selection tool in
freehand mode. I am definitely not talking about the identification tool,
assuming you're referring to the same thing that I am thinking of?
Ctrl+Shift+I, or the icon that is the cursor with a the letter "i" in a
sold blue circle. I'm not sure I would call that new as it's been part of
QGIS since I started using it in about 2015. Perhaps you're an old salt
from the 1.x days? ;-)

As a principle of UX design, ideally, the user should do the same action -
click and drag - for any type of selection, both to maintain internal
consistency in the application and with common ways of doing things in the
broader computer universe. This lets people learn new software quickly by
having a set of transferable actions that can get them up and running and
doing rudimentary things quickly. It also helps reduce unintended errors
caused by using common actions that get unexpectedly interpreted different
than the user is used to. Things like this contribute to how easy or
frustrating an application is to use, both for new and long time users.

1. For the "Select Feature(s)", click and drag to indicate the diagonally
opposite corners of a selection rectangle.
2. For the "Select Features by Freehand", click and drag to create an
irregular blob of selection area.
3. For the "Select Features by Radius", click and drag to indicate the
centre of a selection circle and it's radius.

In 2.x the answer to all of those was yes, but in 3.x it's yes, no, no.

In vector and raster drawing applications, drawing rectangles, circles and
blobs is done by click and drag, as is selecting rectangular, circular or
irregular blobby areas. If you release and click elsewhere then drag, you
start drawing a new object, or you discard the first selection and start
outlining a new one. Word processing and text section, video editors and
frame selection, sound editors and lengths of time in a track, they all
have the user do these conceptually similar tasks in the same way - click
and drag to create a selection , new click discards old selection.

Another principle of UX design is that you don't change how a user does
something unless there is clear benefit that outweighs the trouble of
relearning, especially for action concepts that are common in the broader
sphere. When you make changes without benefits you cause friction in your
user flows (some call those "point points"), and that means people find
that task (and potentially the application as a whole) difficult and
frustrating to use.

For those three methods of selection there's nothing to be gained by making
QGIS 3.x the odd one out in how this is done. There's no benefit added by
extra functionality in these selection methods. All it does is create pain
points, both by being different from everybody else and by being
inconsistent internally.

The exception to this is the poly gone selection tool. I've never
encountered it outside of QGIS and ArcGIS. Drawing applications have
polygon drawing tools in which you sequentially click the polygon's points,
just like how you create features on polygon or line layers in QGIS, but
there's no polygon selection analogue. As such it makes sense to take the
feature creation method of sequential clicks over for use in a polygon
selection tool rather than coming up with a whole new user flow like click
and drag and tapping the space bar for the points.

And so I wonder - what was the rationale behind making this change?

Hi Cory,

The message of that blog post is definitely not intended to be that
the answer is "go fix it yourself". It's that fixing it yourself is
ONE option, and there's a number of other reliable avenues to follow
too.

If you can suggest any ways to improve the wording of that post (while
keep the core message intact), please let me know.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Why was selection tool behaviour changed in
	3.x?

I guess the rationale was making it easier on the tendons in the carpal
tunnel. Click, hold/move, click became click, move, click.

I would like to see a mode where the node that will be moved is
autoselected based on proximity to the mouse pointer. Then it would become
move, click, move, click. Obviously this needs to be guided by a
rubberband, whowing which node will be moved.

In JOSM this "improve way accuracy" also allows Ctrl-Click for adding
nodes, I mean vertices.

Hi,

we have bug-fix period before each release which is funded by QGIS.org from
donations. So usually bugs that are critical/regression/crash/corrupt data
are fixed during that period for LTR and PR.

Cheers,
Peter

sorry Cory, I did not mean to be impolite. I think the page cited
depicts accurately the sheer reality behind bug fixing, and effectively
answers your question.
A Peter pointed out, thanks to our sponsors and donors we are able to
fix many bugs before each release, but there cannot be a guarantee. The
best option is always come and collaborate with core team, in the way
that is most practical to you.
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS WMS tiles don't load on Windows
Message-ID: <CADP_rvuAHJQFOrU7Quog1H7C2z5rMQBh49=druw6NFeRbJ02gQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm busy developing an app using the QGIS Python api, PyQGIS, and am
noticing some strange behaviour when loading WMS tiles: Running the python
script on Linux Mint loads xyz layers from Google Maps and Google Satellite
just fine. On Windows, only the Google Maps layer loads.

Here is a test script I wrote to demonstrate the problem:

from qgis.core import QgsApplication, QgsProject, QgsRasterLayer
from qgis.gui import QgsMapCanvas, QgsLayerTreeMapCanvasBridge

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMainWindow
import os

GOOGLE_MAPS_SOURCE = "type=xyz&url=
https://mt1.google.com/vt?lyrs%3Dm%26x%3D%7Bx%7D%26y%3D%7By%7D%26z%3D%7Bz%7D&zmax=19&zmin=0
"
GOOGLE_SATELLITE_SOURCE = "type=xyz&url=
https://mt1.google.com/vt?lyrs%3Ds%26x%3D%7Bx%7D%26y%3D%7By%7D%26z%3D%7Bz%7D&zmax=19&zmin=0
"

class WMSTestApp(QMainWindow):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.canvas = QgsMapCanvas(self)
        self.bridge =
QgsLayerTreeMapCanvasBridge(QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot(),
self.canvas)

        layer = QgsRasterLayer(GOOGLE_SATELLITE_SOURCE, "Test WMS Layer",
"wms")

        QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(layer)
        self.canvas.setLayers([layer])

        self.setCentralWidget(self.canvas)


QgsApplication.setPrefixPath(os.environ.get("QGIS_PREFIX_PATH", "C:\Program
Files\QGIS 3.4\apps\qgis"), True)
qgs = QgsApplication([], True)
qgs.initQgis()

app = WMSTestApp()
app.show()
qgs.exec_()
qgs.exitQgis()

Interestingly, the layers (from the same sources!) both load from the
Windows QGIS app.
So I did some digging and noticed that the default Google Maps url returns
PNG files, while the Satellite url returns JPEGs. I tested a couple of
other links, and it seems like only PNG tile servers have any effect on
windows systems.

Have tested this on Windows 7 and 10, with the same results.

Does PyQgis need to be reconfigured in some way to get this to work? Or is
it a known issue with the version (3.4) I'm using?

Cheers and thanks,
Erik

I want to second Cory, to me it also feels a little rude to tell a
'user' (not a developer) to try to code or pay for a dev. And I'm a
dutchie, known for their blunt talk :-)

@Nyall: in my opinion your followup article:
http://nyalldawson.net/2016/08/how-to-effectively-get-things-changed-in-qgis-a-follow-up/
has a better 'tone' for non developers.

We should probably mix your followup article with the first one and put
it in the website (in the 'user' section) so it is translatable, so
translators can maybe even add more 'cultural politness' to it if needed?

WHO wants to do that (you can earn karma points if you do this !!)??

We should also make clear that it IS OK to ask for the community to have
a look at the an issue which makes your(!) live a hell. But also make it
clear that to be fair your problems are not always the problems of
somebody else. Same goes for commercial software by the way, only they
are not as transparent as we are. And that we are humans with not enough
time to solve all the problems in the world.

STILL I'm not sure what the right tone is to tell people to read such a
text though... people (me included!) will feel a little offended anywat
when not helped but sent to a page to read what they should do...

I think Geoserver does a good job:

https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/Successfully-requesting-and-integrating-new-features-and-improvements-in-GeoServer
And Ian's talk: (though it can maybe be polished a little):
https://www.ianturton.com/talks/foss4g.html#/how-to-earn-support


@Cory: please stay on the good side :-)

May I suggest to make your bug report even better by adding data and
instructions so for an average developer, it is 10 minutes work to
replicate your issue? Or should we just create the table and start
editing? If so please add some steps. For example some googling revealed
to me that I need: "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";" to use
the uuid_generate_v4() function you use?

Also make sure it is actually a QGIS problem, looking into it, it is.
But it is also a data-schema issue, as you define the problematic
columns as:
predecessors uuid[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]::uuid[],
And the "uuid[]" is not a very common type in the gis world.

If I'm correct '{""}' (what QGIS now uses for NULL values if the column
has an array type) is a textual representation of an array with one
string in it. Would it be better to do '{null}' or even '{}' instead?
Can you try to create an update query with '{null}' and '{}' values in
the empty array fields?
And add these queriies to the bug report?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I suggest taking a look at the source of the QuickMapServices plugin to see how they do it. Make sure to get the extra datasets from the plugin settings dialog.

This thread is another good reason why we need some user metrics and why our users would benefit from it - we currently have a very poor grasp of the distribution of our users across geographies and platforms.

Agreed fully. I'm a big fan of anonymous user stats since ever.

Hi


I wonder, what is the best way to answer a question like

> I was wondering when issue x is getting some attention?

Assuming
 - that "issue x" is very important for a user who asks the question
 - that "issue x" is one of 3000 open issues for a developer

The best for the user would obviously be someone replying "Oh sorry, I
missed that one. I'll have a look immediately".
But in reality, unfortunately we all have limited time resources. So
this just would not be true. To me informing people "how to get things
done" is not the nicest answer to get, but it's a very honest one.

With all best intentions
Matthias

    I want to second Cory, to me it also feels a little rude to tell a
    'user' (not a developer) to try to code or pay for a dev. And I'm a
    dutchie, known for their blunt talk :-)

    @Nyall: in my opinion your followup article:
    http://nyalldawson.net/2016/08/how-to-effectively-get-things-changed-in-qgis-a-follow-up/
    has a better 'tone' for non developers.

    We should probably mix your followup article with the first one and put
    it in the website (in the 'user' section) so it is translatable, so
    translators can maybe even add more 'cultural politness' to it if
    needed?

    WHO wants to do that (you can earn karma points if you do this !!)??

    We should also make clear that it IS OK to ask for the community to have
    a look at the an issue which makes your(!) live a hell. But also make it
    clear that to be fair your problems are not always the problems of
    somebody else. Same goes for commercial software by the way, only they
    are not as transparent as we are. And that we are humans with not enough
    time to solve all the problems in the world.

    STILL I'm not sure what the right tone is to tell people to read such a
    text though... people (me included!) will feel a little offended anywat
    when not helped but sent to a page to read what they should do...

    I think Geoserver does a good job:

    And Ian's talk: (though it can maybe be polished a little):
    https://www.ianturton.com/talks/foss4g.html#/how-to-earn-support


    @Cory: please stay on the good side :-)

    May I suggest to make your bug report even better by adding data and
    instructions so for an average developer, it is 10 minutes work to
    replicate your issue? Or should we just create the table and start
    editing? If so please add some steps. For example some googling revealed
    to me that I need: "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";" to use
    the uuid_generate_v4() function you use?

    Also make sure it is actually a QGIS problem, looking into it, it is.
    But it is also a data-schema issue, as you define the problematic
    columns as:
    predecessors uuid[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]::uuid[],
    And the "uuid[]" is not a very common type in the gis world.

    If I'm correct '{""}' (what QGIS now uses for NULL values if the column
    has an array type) is a textual representation of an array with one
    string in it. Would it be better to do '{null}' or even '{}' instead?
    Can you try to create an update query with '{null}' and '{}' values in
    the empty array fields?
    And add these queriies to the bug report?

    Regards,

    Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi  Matthias,

I cannot agree more, I think that we (developers) are in general very happy
if we can help anyone that has an issue with QGIS and we do everything we
can to help, but unfortunately the users are many, the issues are also many
and we definitely need to feed our families and our pets (that's basically
the same that not having enough time for unpaid work).

So, I also think that we are giving an honest answer.

I personally get a little bit upset when people push too much (basically
asking me to work for free to solve their problems), on the contrary I'm
usually very happy to help someone that is asking politely.

What it is important to stress is that hiring someone to fix an issue is
not the only way to get things done, for instance I am generally more happy
to help someone who I know as a very active member of the QGIS or
open-source community, because I know that there is a fair balance between
what this person gives and takes.

On the other end of the scale are some corporate users that I imagine are
saving a lot of money by using QGIS and give back just nothing.

Last but not least, as Régis pointed out, we have some funds for bug-fixing
before the releases, the donations from the sponsors and from the users
make this possible and these funds can act as multiplier for the
unpaid-volunteer bug-fixing work that inevitably continues after the
releases.

Let's just find the best way to communicate this to the users, Nyall's
posts looks good to me but I really like the idea of having translations
and culture-specific texts to better explain the concept.

What I found looking into a fix for that that is that we also represent json as
map (the table also has json), like hstores.

And later produce hstores from maps - which is obviously isn't json.  That
could be changed by simply applying to_json on the produced hstore when
inserting or updating.

Doing that I got doubts about the current implementation as hstores apparently
can only be simple key/value maps and cannot - unlike json - be nested.

So nested json data might not currently read correctly either and we should
better be using text instead of a map for json or check whether if our support
for maps in the ui consideres nested or make it configurable how json is
handled.

But that's where I left off.

PS: That was after the initial gentle ping - if it started like the second
    response, I might not have looked at it at all - although that effectively
    doesn't make much difference.

Hi there!
Chiming in as this is an interesting conversation and it's relevant to
pretty much any "mature" open source project (the kind that has
developers that are a bit older, with a family and a job, and very little
and precious spare time).

What I wrote in the first article above should really be reworded to cover
not just features and improvements, but also bug fixes.
As others say, the reality is simple and "hard", core developers have
already a day job, that normally involves following up on contract work,
or project work, but not fixing random bugs for free, regardless of how
important they are.

Sure, there are bug fix code sprints, and there is a bit of spare time, but
both are time constrained and volunteer based,
that puts some simple filters on top of those activities: one does whatever
fixing fits the time allocated for the bug fixing, and
tries to fix as many as possible. Meaning, there is a tendency to pick the
quick to solve tickets, starving anything else that requires
longer development (or maybe longer setup), or just anything that one
guesses might be complicated (e.g., found in a area of
code that is known to be fragile).
The volunteer bit puts another filter on what gets done, given a choice of
hundreds of reports, one tends to choose stuff that
they feel comfortable working with. Personally, given two equally viable
tickets, I also tend to choose ones that are reported by
people that are actively participating, and skip/delay the ones that have
been reported by people that have been troublesome in the community.

Users might call this unfair. I say they don't understand a thing about
community driven open source... because it's not a faceless
service like, dunno, healthcare (which one has paid taxes for btw), open
source developers are people, not machines, and the free bug fixing
is a courtesy, not a service. As far as I'm concerned, those that do not
understand that or cannot live with it, can go back using proprietary
software, it's a better match for them (really, open source is not just for
everybody, even users need to have the right attitude towards it).

I use a lot of open source software myself. When something does not work, I
report. If I can help fixing, I do. If I cannot help fixing, I wait.
If I cannot wait nor pay, I look for an alternative. After all, the GPL
license is really clear on the matter:
"THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION"
Throwing one's frustration at the developers that shared code under the
above conditions, while somehow understandable, really does not make sense
and helps nobody.

I would like to see some "summary" document of sort shared at the OSGeo
level, as several projects have the same issues.

Cheers
Andrea

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS-Server: filter by categories in an OGC
	compatible way
Message-ID: <374093d6cb0a9d3a39c5680fe4756bc3@carto.net>

Hi, 

Does QGIS-Server support SLD styles to filter away RULEs in a GetMap
Request? 

I would assume, yes, but in what encoding would I submit such an SLD in
a GET request? I know that one should rather use POST reqests for such
long parameters, but for experimenting, it would be ok to use GET. 

The idea would be to allow users to enable/disable categories within a
given layer. 

The WMS client would first request the available rules with a GetStyles
command (that part works fine) and would then filter the RULE (strip
away the unwanted RULEs) and resubmit the GetMap with an SLD. Does that
work with QGIS server? 

I know that one can also use the FILTER parameter, but we want to do it
in an OGC compatible way, since the client being developed should work
with any OGC compatible WMS server. 

Thanks for your reply, 

Andreas

For operating systems like FreeBSD the QGIS ports only fetch source 
tarballs[1][2]. Prebuilt packages are delivered by FreeBSD servers 
themselve.

It seems difficult to get such statistical informations from OSes like 
FreeBSD. Any ideas?

Well we have been discussing for a while to implement the new welcome screen[1] and do some (opt-in) tracking of user platform there….

Hi, 

I did some test: 

Here is a long URL with the SLD (originally sent by QGIS server,
stripped away some RULES manually) and sending it back in a GetMap
request:

So apparently the SLD cannot be converted to a QString. Is my encoding
in the URL above wrong or am I missing a required additional parameter? 

Can you point me to an example how to create a valid GetMap request with
an SLD submitted? 

Thanks a lot, 
Andreas

Hi,
if you want to pass a verbatim SLD, you should use SLD_BODY. This seems to
work:

Using &sld=... you should feed it with a URL that the SLD can be downloaded
from instead
(none of this is QGIS specific, it's just how the SLD specification says
user provided styles should be used).

Hi Andrea, 

Ah - thanks a lot! This helps. 

Is there also a simpler OGC compatible way available to filter away
categories in a layer if there is no intent to re-style the categories
in a layer? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,
no, I'm afraid not, the WMS specification provided no way to filter, and
even the SLD/SLD_BODY parameters are not part of the WMS specification,
but part of the SLD one, which a server might decide to implement, or not

Cheers
Andrea

Hi Andreas,

There's a basic example in unit tests:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/test_qgsserver_wms_getmap.py#L1309-L1325

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS-Server: filter by categories in an OGC

Hi Paul 

Thanks - now I know that I have to use SLD_BODY for the case where the
SLD is in the URL. 

Another QGIS-Server specific question: 

Can I count on it that the SLD output by QGIS server with the GetStyles
request can also be consumed again by QGIS server? What about complex
styles (e.g. something with a style that can't easily be represented by
SLD). If I first consume the styles from QGIS server, then filter and
send back, would the complex styles potentially be lost/destroyed? 

Again: our intent here is merely to filter categories, not to change the
styles. 

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Andrea, 

Thanks a lot for the clarification. That's good to know. 

I know that both Geoserver and QGIS server have easier ways for
filtering, but those are not standardized then. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi Erik,

I think maybe there's a nomenclature problem here. I wasn't aware that 
any Google services were available via WMS.

WMS is a specific specification, and if you're googling around using 
that term you're going to find results that aren't pertinent to what you 
actually want to do (which is using Google's tile based, non-WMS services).

Cheers,

Jonathan

Hi Andrea,

As always, I agree with you, but one thing:

 > After all, the GPL license is really clear on the matter: "THE ENTIRE 
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. 
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION"  Throwing one's frustration at the 
developers that shared code under the above conditions, while somehow 
understandable, really does not make sense and helps nobody.

To be fair you get the exact same conditions if you throw six digit sums 
to the proprietary vendors too. FME (https://www.safe.com/legal/fme-sla/):

"Limited Warranty: the Software is provided “AS IS” and with all defects 
and errors. ... TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SAFE 
SOFTWARE MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO 
MERCHANTABILITY, USE OF REASONABLE SKILL AND CARE, OR FITNESS FOR ANY 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, 
SAFE SOFTWARE ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE TO ANY SYSTEM ON WHICH 
THIS SOFTWARE IS INSTALLED, FOR CORRUPTION OF ANY DATA TRANSLATED BY THE 
SOFTWARE, OR FOR LOSSES ARISING IN THE EVENT THIRD PARTIES ARE ABLE, FOR 
ANY REASON, TO USE OR ACCESS THE SOFTWARE OR YOUR DATA OR SERVICES 
WITHOUT CHARGE."

ESRI 
(https://assets.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/en-us/media/legal/ma-translations/english.pdf)

"3.3 General Disclaimer. Except for the express limited warranties set 
forth in this Agreement, Esri disclaims all other warranties or 
conditions of an kind, whether express or implied, including but not 
limited to, warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a 
particular purpose, ... Esri does not warrant that Esri Offerings or 
Customers operation of the same will be uninterrupted, error free, fault 
tolerant, or failsafe *or that all nonconfirmities can or will be 
corrected*..."

(my bold at the end). Pretty much every software license ever says "this 
software won't necessarily do what you've paid for it to do".

The only real difference is that with FOSS, you /can /pay to get it 
fixed. With proprietary, even paying isn't a guarantee (Esri explicitly 
say so as you can see in my bold).

Cheers,

Jonathan

Hi Andreas,

Another problem you may hit - the link below is hitting it being ~2300 
chars - URL's (and thus GET requests) cannot reliably be more than about 
2000 characters long. At that point you need to shift over to POST 
requests (and I think GetMap is GET only...).

Cheers,

Jonathan

Yes indeed, completely agree.
I kind of see an unfortunate tendency to repetition in users, a sort of
"continuity" if you like:

   - "I pay for proprietary software, hence I'll pay for support and
   fixing" (and agree that getting a fix is really hard, towards "mission
   impossible" levels, with large vendors)
   - "I did not pay for open source software, hence I won't pay for support
   or bug fixing (let alone use my super-precious personal time to help the
   community in other ways)". And this is where I get mad :-D

Cheers
Andrea

Many thanks for the suggestion to use the Lutra Consulting installer. It
worked perfectly and it didn't upset anything else on my system. I'd liken
it quite favorably to the approach used by https://postgresapp.com/ for
PostgreSQL installs on Macs. I hope you'll consider an approach this simple
for your "official" macOS build.

Best,
Anthony

Hi Erik,

(Staying on list)

I'm afraid I can't help you with QGIS stuff as I don't know anything 
about the code-base. Just wanted to clear up confusion.

That Google service is definitely not a WMS service. To get a maptile 
via WMS it would have this in the query string somewhere: 
&request=getmap&service=WMS&version= at the minimum. Most OGC services 
build URLs similar that, so they're easy to spot.

Other map service types are TMS (which is most similar to Google map 
tiles and OSM tile services) and WMTS (a more complex version of TMS). 
Both are designed for sharing basemap tiles. It took me a while to get 
my head around the different types too!

Cheers,

Jonathan

Hi Anthony,

Yesterday we  had a meeting and decided that we want to further support 
the efforts towards a better MacOS installer. So we hope that this 
initiative will bear more fruits in the future.

Greetings,

Andreas

Hi Jonathan,

I am aware about the limit in GET requests.

Are you sure that WMS servers don't support POST requests?

Some Google hits suggest otherwise

Geoserver:

https://anitagraser.com/2010/06/09/getmap-from-geoserver-using-http-post/

UMN:

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/232215/mapserver-wms-http-post-requests

I am pretty sure that QGIS Server also allows POST requests, but I may 
be wrong.

Hi Andrea,

Just checked the WMS 1.3.0 spec:

"HTTP supports two request methods: GET and POST. One or both of these 
methods may be offered by a server,
and the use of the Online Resource URL differs in each case. Support for 
the GET method is mandatory; support
for the POST method is optional."

The GetCaps document should indicate whether POST is supported.

So I was wrong, they can be GET, but it's not guaranteed. Sorry about 
that, thanks for checking!

Cheers,
Jonathan

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] reale Distanzen durch Strassenverkehrsnetz rechnen
Message-ID: <web-2880560@rz.tu-bs.de>

Sehr geehrter Damen und Herren,

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
English version follows at the end of the email



im Rahmen eines Projekts im Institut für Controlling und 
Unternehmsrechnung beschäftigen wir uns mit der Forschung, um die 
Anzahl der Krankenhäuser im Teil von Niedersachsen effizient zu 
reduzieren.
Man sollte eine “isochrone map”. Es soll mit der software (QGIS) 
gerechnet werden, was “service area” des Krankenhauses innerhalb 
30mins oder 60mins Fahrstrecke ist.

200 zufällige Punkte in jeder Gemeinde wurde schon generiert, um den 
Distanz zwischen jedem Punkt und jedem Krankenhaus zu rechnen.

1- Über Distanz zwischen zwei Punkten auf der Layer konnten wir nur 
die absolute Distanz rechen, aber eigentlich brauchen wir die genauen, 
realen und mit realem Strassenverkehrsnetz gerechneten Distanzen.
2- Es gibt eine Erweiterung heisst “OSM Tools” in QGIS, und diese 
Erweiterung besagt, es kann Isochrone map generieren. Aber wenn wir 
das Rechnen versuchen,dann gibt es kein erwartetes Ergebnis.
Auf jede Hilfe Anweisung oder weiterleitung sind wir sehr dankbar.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen
Aziz


Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,


As part of a project at the Institute for Controlling and Enterprise 
Accounting, we are engaged in research to efficiently reduce the 
number of hospitals in the Lower Saxony area.
One should have an "isochronous map". It should be calculated with the 
software (QGIS), which is "service area" of the hospital within 30mins 
or 60mins driving distance.

200 random points have already been generated in each community to 
calculate the distance between each point and each hospital.

1- We were only able to calculate the absolute distance over the 
distance between two points on the layer, but actually we need the 
exact, real distances calculated using the real road traffic network.
2- There is an extension called "OSM Tools" in QGIS, and this 
extension says it can generate Isochrone map. But if we try the 
calculation, then there is no expected result.

We are very thankful for any help, instruction or forwarding.
Yours sincerely
Aziz

The packaging instructions are written for Debian/Ubuntu as far as I

Hi Andrea

"I did not pay for open source software, hence I won't pay for support or bug fixing (let alone use my super precious personal time to help the community in other ways)".

What I have experienced is that I, as a frequent open source user in my line of work, have a difficult time convincing my boss to invest in something which is free (and thus inferior – not my opinion since I prefer the open source program). Which means that while I agree with your “madness” in

“And this is where I get mad :-D”,

your “madness” hits me and not the ones refusing to throw a few coins at helping us all fix a couple of bugs. I guess it’s just another example of how the purse-keeper doesn’t feel the frustrations, just the moneyless ☺

Hi Andrea,

As always, I agree with you, but one thing:

> After all, the GPL license is really clear on the matter: "THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION"  Throwing one's frustration at the developers that shared code under the above conditions, while somehow understandable, really does not make sense and helps nobody.

To be fair you get the exact same conditions if you throw six digit sums to the proprietary vendors too.
Yes indeed, completely agree.
I kind of see an unfortunate tendency to repetition in users, a sort of "continuity" if you like:

  *   "I pay for proprietary software, hence I'll pay for support and fixing" (and agree that getting a fix is really hard, towards "mission impossible" levels, with large vendors)
  *   "I did not pay for open source software, hence I won't pay for support or bug fixing (let alone use my super-precious personal time to help the community in other ways)". And this is where I get mad :-D

We have packaging for Fedora which is RPM based [0]: it may be used as a
starting point for OpenSUSE. Indeed you'll need mostly to change the
section about dependencies: names may be different and something may be
missing.

About numbers: COPR [1] gives a rough estimated number of repo downloads
which is around 1.5k. I was also surprised by the quantity of feedback
received about these packages: I was not expecting so many (proactive)
users.

This confusion will not have been helped by the fact that PyQGIS (I seem to
recall) makes XYZ layers inherit from WM(T)S layers. That makes sense from a
functional point of view (they're all served rasters), but from a
standards/terminology point of view, it's pretty confusing.

Hi Cory

>From memory, there was a lot of discussion about making this change in the
vertex editor. It's not true to say that QGIS is an outlier: the rationale
behind the change - along with the reasons Jo mentions and increasing the
ability to be more accurate if you don't have to hold down the button - was
to align with the behaviour of CAD, which does use "click-click", rather
than click-and-drag.

@thomas : there are already dozen of issue reports with your stacktrace,

Message-ID: <CA+Ei1OcrYLtpYFJugT=eiX_Cc0rpSQ4UfW-Na9afhoTwxGnu8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I got a strange experience with QGIS (3.4) when opening attribute
table with larger number of fields (here 512 fields). Attribute table
opens very quickly, but then QGIS freeze for dozens of seconds (not
able to scroll attribute table).

Do you have similar experience? Known issue? Thanks! Ma

namely https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20283, but a clue how to reproduce the
issue.   People tend to just post the crash report, but most of the time no
information how to reproduce the issue - this is not one of the issue where the
pure stacktrace is conclusive.

oops, "a clue" as in "no clue at all". ;)

I just tested and the answer are, as Régis mentioned, the same as in
2.18 ( tested using 3.4.4). the behavior you describe is only true when
you activate "select by polygon".

That is exactly why QGIS does it the same why as other tools.

a very quick google search returned the whole rationale to changing the
behavior of the Node tool [0] but none for the behavior you describe,
which I could not reproduce. Could you show us a screencast?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Inconsistency in QgsServerRequest parameter
	handling ?
Message-ID: <E333A758-3906-4ACA-8A41-0512BDAB068E@3liz.com>


Hi devs,

I found a strange and seemingly inconsistent behavior when accessing QgsServerRequest parameters:

If you try:

request.setParameter('FOOBAR','foobar')

then

request.parameter('FOOBAR')

then you get an empty string,

If you call

request.parameters() 

Then your get a dictionary with all the values previously set.

At first glance it seems that request.setParameter enforce use of a limited set of keys (SERVICE…..

This does not seem very consistent with the fact parameter() should return any value previously set with setParameter and also the fact that
request.parameters()  return all previously defined  parameters key/values .

Furthemore this may be  problematic with plugins that define services in python and thus may define any other set of allowed parameters.

Should I open an issue ?

I will confirm that my QGIS 3.6 crashes as well especially when clicking on
the X in the upper right hand corner. I don't know why this has been such a
problem over time because it has plagued many versions of qgis.

Hi

I can help with the why part of the message:

- it has been caused by a wide variety of different reasons over time

- these reasons are often very specific to a local setup/project/system
environment

- because it doesn't cause data loss, the priority is reduced from
super-urgent to high

That said, this message unfortunately doesn't help to solve the problem,
but hopefully helps to understand

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Canonical way to customize QGis toolbar icons
	within themes?
Message-ID: <110af6e9-5c16-1b4c-ef8d-a4be5d4f8981@pleiszenburg.de>

Hi all,

I am looking for a/the canonical way to customize QGis toolbar icons
(or, in general, the icons of certain actions throughout QGis), like for
instance the icons for "New project" or "Open project" as part of a theme.

Themes can contain icons and reference them, see for instance here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/93e761dd2396af21db9bb93e26d7cba680c906ca/resources/themes/Blend%20of%20Gray

Is there possibly a way to use *.qss style sheets to point to specific
actions in QGis, e.g. the "new project" action, and modify their icons?

Or can I modify icons of certain actions through a plugin at runtime?

What I have messed with so far: I can overwrite icons in ...
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/93e761dd2396af21db9bb93e26d7cba680c906ca/images/themes/default
... and rebuild QGis from source. It appears that the icons become part
of the binary or one of its libraries as compiled resources.

Best regards,
Sebastian

It looks to me that there is a community of openSUSE users out there 
building packages. You should try and engage with the people that have 
built community packages to see if they can develop this package.

Hi there,

@Alessandro Pasotti; thanks for pointing out that there are several persons
affected by bugs which cause QGIS3 to crash on exit.
I know that my stacktrace is different from Andreas' one. when I said "same
here" I was refering to Andreas'  statement  "We always have crashes on
closing QGIS (on Windows)".

@Jürgen Fischer: ok. here is the long story about the stacktrace ;-) :
Yesterday I created some layers (mostly memory layers )with the processing
toolbar (reproject, union and so on). Then I did not touch the opened
project until today when I wanted to close QGIS and it warned me that there
are unsaved memory layers. So I canceled the closing and saved the layer.
After that I tried to close QGIS and it crashed.

@Matthias Kuhn: I can understand that the priority is not as high as if
would be if data would be corrupted but if I have a look at
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20283 I see nearly 70 tickets linked to this
one where it was reported that QGIS crashes while closing so I think it's
obvious that is is a nasty bug that affects a lot of people.
Doing a quick google search for the term " proj_lpz_dist"  shows a lot of
cases where the coordinate transformation of a polygonlayer seems to cause
problems:

proj_lpz_dist :
QgsCoordinateTransform::transformPolygon :


Does someone know what "proj_lpz_dist" stands for?

If I would have been able to reproduce the error I would have contacted our
QGIS support provider to let them fix the bug but until now it was not
possible to reproduce the crash.

Is there something else that can be done to help fixing this bug?
This bug is one of the reasons why QGIS3 cannot be rolled out for
productiuon use at my workplace. Even if QGIS3 has very nice new features
QGIS2.18 is still way more stable at the moment, so we postpone the QGIS3
rollout from week to week.

regards,
Thomas

I think I fixed this one recently with NathanW's help. I'm not 100%
sure, because I could never reproduce it myself.

I also thought the auth manager one was fixed by Matthias recently?

Yes, an auth manager related one has been fixed (and backported to 3.4
and 3.6) a month ago

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9334

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9336


My point was by no means that crashes on exit should be or are
neglected, sorry that I expressed myself badly.

Thanks for that information. I was unaware there really is such a small 
community of developers.

I guess that Gis software is specialised enough that there is not 
general interest to attract the wider community support that some of the 
major open source projects produce, whether this is a larger development 
community or financial support from a sponsor.

I only use a small fraction of the capabilities of the software. 
Unfortunately it is not practicable at this time for me to contribute 
more than bug reports to the software. The fact that we even have this 
software in the open source community is greatly appreciated by me.

Actually, QgsServerRequest and QgsServerParameters are high level
classes which are not aware of valid parameters defined in services. For
example, FI_POINT_TOLERANCE is a valid parameter in WMS service, and
defined within the WMS module. But it's totally encapsulated within the
module (a shared library so), and considered as unknown from
QgsServerParameters. The only valid parameters from the
QgsServerParameters point of view are those which are common for all
services (WMS, WFS, and so on) like SERVICE, VERSION, REQUEST, ...

If you want to retrieve the full query from the request without any
filter on valid parameters, you may use request.url(). However, I think
we could probably add a fallback on the `parameter()` method to return
invalid parameters too. I'll do a PR tomorrow and I'll ping you to check
if the behaviour suits you.

Yes, this is what I was thinking about Looking at the code: maybe adding a lookup to the 'unmanaged' parameters if the code is not found should restore the symmetry setParameter/parameter.

I'm standing from the python plugin's point of view - services and filters: plugins are expecting some behavior when setting/getting parameters. If a plugin override a parameter it can only doing it using the requestHandler which is aware
only of the  base QgsServerParameters owned by the  QgsServerRequest instance, so they should be able to set/get parameters in a transparent way.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Advice? Sneaky trick for call out labels
Message-ID: <42CFDB46-3D8C-4842-934E-8F1E72F9C6EA@kartoza.com>

Hi Friends

So I am using logic like this* to make call out labels using a geometry generator:

make_line(
  closest_point($geometry,
  make_point( "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positionx" , "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positiony" )),
  make_point( "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positionx" , "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positiony" )
)

The line runs from the closest point along the edge of the polygon to the bottom left corner of the label box. With this configuration it works well when my ‘lollipop’ callout label is north-east of the polygon being labelled:



But doesn’t work when the label is e.g. south west of the polygon:



Now I am wondering if we have any options for getting the geometry of the label box so I can do the reverse and get the closest point along the edge of the label box to the polygon being labelled. So my question:

Is there any sneaky trick for getting the geometry of the label box for a feature in an expression? And no, using an opaque background for my label to mask away the call out line doesn’t really hack it. I know the label box isn’t being calculated at the time the polygon is being rendered so the answer is probably ’no’ but maybe someone else has a clever idea to make may lollipops work when labels are south (or east or west for that matter) of the feature being labelled?

Thanks!

Regards

Tim

To clarify a little, I am trying to avoid the label text crossing the call-out line.

Hi David,

that makes sense, I agree completely, it's odd I didn't catch this issue
before during one of my tests with plugins, I often use parameters to pass
information around within plugins.

May I suggest that we add a test case to protect the changes when done?

Thanks!

Hi Tim,
You can have a look at easycustomlabeling plugin code. It's sets those
expressions for label alignement.

FYI I should be working on a new version of it taking profit of the
geometry generators power soon , and we might be able to revive the QEP47
to revive the idea of porting this natively to core.
Best regards
Regis

Hi Alexis, Régis and Nyall

I went with Nyall’s approach for now since I was 90% there and he gave me the last nudge I needed :-) I used data defined alignments:



Here are the expressions I used for horizontal:


if (
  X(closest_point($geometry,
  make_point( "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positionx" , "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positiony" ))) >
  X(make_point( "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positionx" , "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positiony" )),
  'Right', 'Left’)

Which gives (animated gif, open in browser if needed):



And Vertical

if (
  Y(closest_point($geometry,
  make_point( "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positionx" , "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positiony" ))) <
  Y(make_point( "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positionx" , "auxiliary_storage_labeling_positiony" )),
  ’Top’, ‘Bottom’)

Which gives (animated gif, open in browser if needed):



@Régis I will give your plugin a try to see what it does too, thanks!

QGIS Rocks!

Tim

HI Tim,
the old plugin is crappy as it was made before the auxiliary data storage
and the geometry generator awesome features.
The expression used are exactly similar to Nyall's advice. The next plugin
will just be a helper to set all those expressions and geometry generator
style for users. I still miss a native implementation for callouts, but
that might become a reality in the next months. Finger crossed.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Why was selection tool behaviour changed in

Hi,

@Marco I can second Cory that the selection tools' behaviour is 
different between 2.18 (tested on Win) and 3.* (tested on Win and Ubuntu)
1) select by rectangle: behaves the same (click + drag)
2) select by polygon: behaves the same
3) select by freehand: behaves differently: 2.18 click + drag 3.* click 
+ click
4) select by circle: behaves differently: 2.18 click + drag 3.* click + 
click
I have no strong feeling for either behaviour (hardly use options 2 to 
4) but I would think that the behaviour should be consistent within QGIS 
(either all click + drag or all click + click). Click + drag is well 
established (e.g. Inkscape, Bentley Microstation) at least for the 
rectangular selection, so maybe it would be better to use this approach. 
Furthermore this is how the rectangular selection works in the layout, too.

@Cory concerning the vertex-editing tool there has been a lot of 
discussion and there were good reasons to change its behaviour. A lot 
has been improved recently: most prominent IMHO: feature can be locked 
for exclusive editing with a right click (similar to selecting a feature 
for editing in 2.*) but can be edited directly without locking e.g. by 
simply picking and moving vertices. May I therefore ask you to try again 
with current master (or a nightly build)? And may I further ask you to 
forget how it was in QGIS 2 and simply try how it works in 3?
AFAIK there is no "standard" in mouse behaviour for vertex editing. CAD 
uses click + click (I can at least say for Microstation), Inkscape uses 
click + drag, so if one or the other seems familiar might depend on 
one's background.

just my 2ct

Bernhard

Hi,

Shouldn't we drop some of the QGIS Server that are now available in the
more general "Metadata" tab or at least fallback on those values?

Or maybe provide a button to copy values from the "Metadata" tab.

I am trying, to read in python, the list of operations performed on a layer
in edition, in the order of realization. I can read from the editbuffer,
the list of add, deletes and changes, but, I need to be able to access
these operations in order.
In principle, I see that in the undoStack there would be the list of
commands, in the order of performed, but, I need to link, to each of these
commands, with the id's present in the corresponding lists in the
editbuffer.
Can you give me a clue?
I see that the undostack, has the list of commands for each layer, but, I
can not find how they can be related, from python, with the corresponding
lists in editbuffer.

Thanks

Nyall has hopefully fixed that bug already.  The one with proj_lpz_dist in
the stack trace.  That isn't the real crash as that stack trace has no
symbols so it's giving you the wrong info.  I got a stack trace the other
day with correct symbols loaded and hopefully, it will be fixed now.

Nyall has already made a PR for this: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9197
To use layer metadata instead of QGIS Server metadata when using an
expression.

I think we can replace a few of them already.

That's a bit different, and now the confusion is complete :)

If I'm not wrong, in getcapabilities you will get metadata from OWS tab, in
expressions you get metadata from Metadata tab and there is no fallback.

Correct, but there is a fallback. The expression will use the QGIS Server
metadata if the corresponding layer metadata is empty.

According to https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/50
and some discussions 2 years ago, I think that all items of the QGIS Server
tab can fit into the new schema. But I agree, the UI is not the best about
links for instance. (metadata URL, data URL, legend URL)

Yeah, I think this is the rational behind what I think is the strongest
bottleneck of Open Source projects currently.
I think we should make an effort to kill the idea that QGIS does not cost
money. It is free yes, this allow you to start and scale GIS for anyone in
an organisation. However, we are witnessing a worlwide behavior change with
open source. Beyond all the billion dollar things with red hat, githb, IBM
and Microsoft, we see here big companies that totally changed their way to
use open source. They advocate that open source costs gain is not at all
the correct argument to choose open source. If you do so, you will kill
communities by asking much, making great savings and never give back. And
one day, the project will die and your projects with it. So those companies
are working to convince their teams to switch to a correct way of doing
open source, which could be summed up this way :

- understand the community first before starting a production project
- Always start with budgets roadmap for open source contribution. Justify
how much you will save at start, we scaling up if your project rocks, and
bargain to keep a fraction of it to contribute back (ie : fix, document,
improve, promote, translate). I f you don't do this at start, it will be a
lot harder to negociate something if your boss thinks it is free
- Go for a support contract, this helps you make your hierarchy understand
this is serious stuff, react fast, helps you explain them the open source
codes.  And it's best commercial solution we've found up to now to fit with
AGILE working. I don't know any serious Oracle 2 postgresql migration that
is not supported like this in fact.
- Advertise what you are doing publicly, and get in touch with "big serious
corps" to show QGIS is serious stuff.

In fact this is pretty much the same thing about data. I've always been
taught that any GIS project is expensive. But if you start any project by
evaluating costs and gains on the long run, you save a lot in the end.

I think we are in a moment where we must all try to make our boss spirit
change. Let's stop saying QGIS costs nothing. Let's share experiences
together to convince them this is serious. Let's calculate how much it
costs to workaround issues instead of solving them. Let's show them that
solving issues is often NOT expensive.

Let's keep up guys, the current moment we live is mostly a good one because
we are facing a huge success, and we are no more between us, hairy
convinced nerds.
We have millions of users, huge expectations, very few ressources. We all
have to spread the word beyong our technical social networks, take some
risks. And each time I tries to do that, surprisingly it works! Not
immediatly, but somes months or years after, a whole company suddenly
switches from the anti-open source camp to our side. Sometimes, one person
can't swich, be patient, do a work around, speak with others (above),
sometimes hire someone to spread a message you are not in a position to
spread yourself.

The fallback I'm talking about is in server metadata, not the expressions.

If "Title" is empty in server metadata tab, getcapabilities will not use
the metadata from the metadata tab.

But in general, the question is: now that we have the metata tab for both
project and layers, do we still need a separate UI server metadata?

Maybe yes: it's just a question.

But if the answer is yes, we should think about inheriting defaults in a
consistent (and documented) way.

Hi Nathan,
is this a configuration issue? Can I do something to get the correct
symbols in the stacktrace?

Thomas

Hi
I'm using QGIS Server version 2.18.17 and it works well on Mac OS X.I initially tested the official version of QGIS for Mac OS X from the qgis website but the server application immediately failed while the desktop part is working well.
So I tried to install QGIS 3.6.0 from MacPorts.org and the desktop part also works well here. The server option was included in the software, a first attempt to build the QGIS Server application.  The binary was built but unfortunately there are some errors difficult to understand.I have made some comparisons with the Ubuntu version and I would like to understand from you where the problems of compilation are assuming that the desktop version works well and all software dependencies are compiled.
The binary of QGIS Server 3.6.x is built within the application and if I start it from the terminal I have this information:

As you can see in the first part are loaded modules, such as the Ubuntu version, but then come the errors and these are complex. Example: no SIP module but the module is installed.The end result is that QGIS Server 3.6.x does not work.
Can you help me understand how to intervene and how to compile the server version at best?
Thank you in advanceLorenzo

Well, that's why I came here because there's been no activity on that bug
for a month except my own comments. No requests for more information like
"please do X and tell me the output". I get that developer time to fix
things is not infinite (I am one myself), but good triage includes an
attempt to narrow down where in the code where the problem occurs to judge
the scope of the problem and comment to that effect so other developers
don't waste time duplicating the effort. But without any comments I don't
even seen an attempt to triage the issue.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Building on Centos 7
Message-ID: <CACq2deKH_8spj2Vv0BjS=boLmw2vit=o7MZG0xVewThB=Un65Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I was wondering if anyone has experience building QGIS 3 on Centos 7?
I have created a Centos 7 docker image to run the build with all the
dependent libraries but I have hit a wall when running the compile.

I managed to get the build to correctly configure using cmake but then I
get an compile error complaining about types (build log is attached to this
email). Does anyone have intuition on what is going wrong?

If people are interested I could share the Centos 7 docker image I am using
to build.

Thanks,
Elias

Hi all,

playing with the i18n translation of projects I discovered some
(unwanted?) things:

* works only for qgs and not qgz, right? Is this a bug or a feature request?
* when using a field within an algorithm (e.g. a buffer with variable
distance) the name displayed are the original and not the translated

Is this still a work in progress or should I file a bug/feature request?

Thanks

Matteo

Correct. The main open question there is if the side car files should be
inside the qgz or next to it. Both have advantages and disadvantages and
therefore it was left out of the first implementation for a follow up
step with a clearer path.

What exactly are you referring too here?
In general: everything that is translatable needs to be added one by one
(see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/90) and
will also need to be added incrementally as things appear in the future.
Especially expressions are hard to do.
The focus of the initial project was mainly on forms and legend.

There is no work going on right now.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Can I backport bugfix with UI updates and fixing
 QGIS Server regression
Message-ID: <465d79a5-fd13-ee48-7035-fa64eb48baef@gmail.com>

Hi Dev,

I have worked on fixing a regression in QGIS Server. 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9692

This regression exists in QGIS 3.4 but has been fixed by Nyall in QGIS 
3.6 by fixing an other issue.
The issue fixed by Nyall was *Layout export - raster divided into tiles, 
edges evident in pdf/svg* https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19500
The issue has been found in QGIS 3.2. It has been fixed in QGIS 3.6 but 
the fix has not been backported to QGIS 3.4.
I suppose that the backport has not been done because the fix updates 
the User Interface. https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9016

I would like to know if I can backport all the commits made by Nyall to 
fix issue 19500 even if it updates the User Interface ?

I think that this backport has to be done in QGIS 3.4 to fix a desktop 
issue and a server regression because it is the LTR version, but I need 
to know if it's the right thing to do.

+1 from my side, but obviously Nyall has the final word on this.

I imagined that the main focus was related to legend and forms. What I
mean is that if you run a Processing algorithm and you want to use a
field of the source layer (e.g. a variable distance buffer where the
distance should be taken from a layer field), the list of the field
shown in the alg UI is not the translated one, but the source one

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GetFeatureInfo: sensitivity on rendered geometry
 vs original geometry.
Message-ID: <4a6ec21f5bbc102d213b2452a457d23a@carto.net>

Hi, 

I'd like to discuss an issue with GetFeatureInfo that we have with point
symbols. 

(Point) symbols can have different sizes (sometimes rather large),
different anchor points and sometimes even with offset away from the
original feature geometry. Often, the rendering of the point symbol
differs substantially from the original point geometry. 

Now, our issue is that GetFeatureInfo often fails miserably in such
cases. People try to click on the visible symbol, which doesn't
correspond to the original geometry. 

One such example WMS: 

https://services.geo.zg.ch/ows/Abfallsammelstellen 

The symbols are rather large, but the anchor point is at the bottom of
the symbol. Users now think that they can click anywhere on the symbol,
but in fact they can only click on the original geometry at the very
bottom of the symbol, taking into account the FI_POINT_TOLERANCE
parameter. 

Things get even worse when one wants to identify points that are
displayed using the point displacement renderer. There, GetFeatureInfo
is only sensitive on the center point, and not at all at the rendered
points at a completely different position. 

Now my question: could we improve QGIS server that GetFeatureInfo
responds to the bounding boxes of the rendered geometries (as opposed to
the raw geometries), taking into account sizes, offsets, etc. 

Would this be technically possible?  

Would others also think that this is useful to have? 

Or would this even contradict OGC standards? 

Do other WMS servers implement such behaviors (Geoserver, UMN)? 

Thanks for the discussion, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

I think QGIS Server has to use the rendered geometries to identify Feature.
Is it possible to get the  point layer to polygon rendred layer ?

Hi René,

Yeah, I also though that's the only solution, what scares me is the
performances cost, because we would need to render and check each layer
individually.

I don't follow you, can you explain what's in your mind?

Like Alessandro, I also don't understand this statement. Do you say that
I should convert my point layer to a polygon layer representing the
rendered bounding box? This would be quite difficult for our users.

On the contrary, I believe a behavior that does not use map rendering to
answer the questions contradicts the standard,
since GetFeaureInfo should return what a user clicked on a particular pixel
in the rendered map

GeoServer does the rendered version by default, but it's possible to turn
that off and go back the on the bbox based engine

The idea is how QGIS can convert point layer to polygon layer 
corresponding to bbox symbol to get feature information.

In QGIS Server, GetFeatureInfo is a simple GetFeature based on Extent. 
Is it possible to do the same but based on rendering ?

I think Paul and Eric have been working on that issue. I'm adding them in
the loop here.

Hi
> 2) select by polygon: behaves the same

For select by polygon, there is an additional option: right-clicking allows
you to select features intersecting with existing polygon shapes (so that
you do not need to capture the same geometry):

Message-ID: <CAJ6DwMCzD_voHJ9e1R0ykm9UeWOBYB8kRZyi8+0Y8OTSk_3nog@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to apply styles stored in a PostGIS DB.

In one method I'm trying to make an inventory, in the other method I try to
load the styles of a particular set for all layers.

I tried to find a solution using Google and this is the result of
assembling code using bits and pieces from other posts, but unfortunately
it still doesn't work.

def populate_layer_styles(self, layer):
    for style in layer.listStylesInDatabase()[2]:
        style_set = style[3]
        if style_set not in self.layer_styles:
            self.layer_styles[style_set] = {}
        style_manager = layer.styleManager()
        from PyQt5.QtXml import QDomDocument
        self.query = "SELECT styleqml FROM public.layer_styles WHERE
stylename='{}'".format(style)
        print(self.query)
        self.perform_query()
        styleqml = self.result[0]
        style_doc = QDomDocument()
        style_doc.setContent(styleqml)
        print(layer.importNamedStyle(style_doc))
        print(layer.loadNamedStyle(style))
        style_manager.addStyleFromLayer(style)

        self.layer_styles[style_set][style] = style_manager
    for style_set in self.layer_styles:
        if style_set not in self.dockwidget.rb_styles.button:
            self.dockwidget.rb_styles.add_button(str(style_set),
self.activate_style_set)

def activate_style_set(self, style_set):

    '''style_set is '1' or '2', etc'''
    print(style_set.text())

That would be a UX prone to mistakes unless it had to be explicitly turned
on and very visible when on. :-)

> It's not true to say that QGIS is an outlier:

I think it's quite fair to say that it is the outlier, and I gave a bunch
of example where click+drag is the norm and aI gave anumber of exmaples.
Click+drag is ubiquitous. Next time you go into a text field of the feature
attributes form to edit that text attribute, let me know how much text you
select by doing click-move-click instead of click+drag. :-)

> along with the reasons Jo mentions and increasing the ability to be more
accurate if you don't have to hold down the button

I would disagree that having to hold the button down while selecting makes
it less accurate as it doesn't affect how much you are able to flex your
wrist or add to stress on the carpal tunnel. Click or no click, you wrist
would make the same movements. Given the ubiquity of click+track in the
computer world, choosing that offer the better UX experience to the users
because it doesn't requires them to relearn how they do simple, common
actions for just one application.

Especially the regular "Select Feature(s)" tool (not polygon, freehand or
radius) does requires you to click and drag. If carpal tunnel issues and
accuracy were actual issues/reasons, then this tool also should have been
change to click, move, left-click to end just like the other selection
tools were changed. That lack of consistency leads to a frustrating
experience for the user, ask any UX designer.

> was to align with the behaviour of CAD, which does use "click-click",
rather than click-and-drag.

How many people who start using QGIS were CAD users beforehand? I suspect
that even minimally experienced CAD users are in the minority. If there is
a decent chunk that could benefit from such a UX/UI change, perhaps it
would have been more appropriate to make that a switch in the settings that
would change the behaviours?

Hi, 

Today is the last day submitting workshop and presentation proposals. 

I wonder who/what was already submitted, so I could potentially help to
fill in gaps? 

I could submit something around "tips&tricks with layouts/atlas/reports"
(including usage of variables and expressions). 

How about 

 	* QGIS server improvements (OGC validation, etc.)
 	* Behind the scenes of QGIS.ORG (it was presented in Dresden at
FOSSGIS by Anita and in A Coruna by myself; but I think not yet at a
FOSS4G conf)
 	* QGIS 3D (Lutra-guys - are you participating?)

How about doing a workshop around 3D and mesh rendering? 

Thanks for your replies and greetings, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

we submitted one QField Workshop and 6 talks:
- Field data collection strategies - using QField and QGIS
- QGIS is dead, long live QGIS! - the very best new features of QGIS 3.x
- GIS Migration Paths - Tools and strategies to move to open source GIS
- Custom workflows in QGIS thanks to Python - a non technical introduction
- PyQGIS the comfortable way - tricks to efficiently work with Python
and QGIS
- and I'm finishing one more about what/why open source should be in
your toolbox

Ciao

Marco

Hi Andreas,

We have sumbitted 2 talks:
- Mesh layer: beyond raster and vector
- Input: a QGIS based mobile app

Mesh layer or 3d workshops sound a great idea. If you are submitting a
workshop, we are happy to help with the preparation and presenting with you.

Kind regards,
Saber

We have submitted these talks ( or nearly ;-) related to QGIS :
- Running QGIS Server in production
- OS Tools for geology based on QGIS and PostGIS
- (no title yet) : a talk about QGIS adoption, market maturity and
evolution of the project

And the following workshops :
- 3D in PostGIS and QGIS
- QGIS Server and QWC2

I have read that the LOC wants talks "State of XXX" for all OSGeo
projects. Has someone already submitted a "State of QGIS" talk ?

Best regards,
Vincent

Do you recall if "state of" is meant as Feature-wise or how is the
project doing ?

if the former then I submitted "QGIS is dead, long live QGIS! - the very
best new features of QGIS 3.x"

ciao

Marco

Hi, 

Thanks Vincent. 

What would be the content of a "State of QGIS" talk? It would obviously
not be possible to present all improvements in QGIS from the past year.
Would this be more like a "behind the scenes" talk where mainly issues
around community, organization, infrastructure, challenges we face, etc.
would be discussed? 

Good to see that you will cover server/web client. 

I had a quick exchange with Lutra regarding a 3D and mesh workshop.
Obviously this would overlap with your 3D with Postgis and QGIS
workshop. Would it still make sense to submit two proposals? 

Greetings,
Andreas

Hi

I submitted a workshop proposal about QGIS Server and Python.

Basically the same I did in La Coruña.

@Vincent Picavet <vincent.picavet at oslandia.com> could you let us know if
your workshop is about QGIS 3d, so we can submit another proposal for mesh
layer?

Thanks

Hi Andreas,

We have submitted (at least) 2 Talks:

- WPS with Qgis Processing - From desktop to server.
- QGIS: No more plugins only processings.

No mesh layer in our proposed workshop. We only deal with 3D objects
supported by PostGIS. QGIS is used to visualize results of PostGIS
queries with 3D operators, and we will probably show a tour of QGIS 3D
capabilities to start with.

Hi Andreas,

We also submitted 2 talks around QGIS and QGIS-Server:
- Lizmap to create Web Map Applications
- Offline viewing and editing Geographic Information for Forest Fire 
Defense

Thanks all for sharing your submissions. 

In that case I'll submit two things: 

1. A workshop proposal for tips and tricks in layouts, Atlas and reports
(incl. usage of variables and expressions) 

2. A "State of QGIS talk" - assuming that this is not about a feature
frenzy talk, but rather discussing the internals (behind the scenes),
challenges and progress we have in the project. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

No idea, I just read this comment from the CfP :

"""
FOSS4G is the international geospatial community’s event, thus the main
selection of talks will be done through the open community voting
process. The highest-scored ones will automatically be included in the
program, while the others will be reviewed by the FOSS4G 2019 Bucharest
volunteer Program Committee. Its members will make sure that the
conference program will be well-balanced, diverse and they will make
sure that every OSGeo project will have a “State of ” kind of presentation.
"""

As for features, Marco's presentation will be relevant. It may be
interesting to have something more project-oriented to have a general
overview, with QGIS.ORG status, project dynamics, etc.

We can also ask the program committee to know exactly what they would
want to hear.

Vincent

Hello

I quickly cross checked with the LOC.

First (inofficial) response is Marco's talk should have it covered
already. The idea is to have an overview on what happened with the
project, what are future plans etc.

But I'm sure that an additional presentation about the organisational
side of things which has moved quite a bit too in the last years will be
interesting as well. I'd propose to choose a name that highlights this
though so as not to have people expect a feature frenzy in there ;)

Hi all,
I just submitted this:

**Open source contributors do more than they should. QGIS as a reference
project on how to find sustainable ways to rock!**

QGIS - like Geoserver, Mapserver and all the great OSGEO project - do not
have to prove any longer that they can do the job.
We now have millions of users, with great expectations, growing budgets and
growing communities. Still we lack funding for boring tasks : packaging,
bugfixing, documentation, QA and marketing need some love.

**What about changing minds and stop saying open source does not cost
anything ?**
Could that solve this situation where countries having most users also have
the less contributors ?
This talk will take profit of real life examples of big corporations that
decided to pivot their approach from "using open source" to "embrace
Opensource".

Let's get out of our technical comfort zone and expose ourselves to enlarge
our contributor's base.

This is a deeply optimistic talk looking right into the eyes of what we
need to improve, as an opensource ecosystem !


if this is accepted, I will reuse some facts of Andreas talks about users
stat's, project budget and we could articulate this with a "state of QGIS "
talk.
Best regards
Régis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issue with embed layers in layergroups in QGIS 3
Message-ID: <CANkSeKNUniE6V5HLL67kcE7QZMj9g_Ke_t8d5dVaKoSuy_RoEw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I'm confronted to a big issue with embed layers. We have a lot of projects
with embed layer groups (like cadastral map, city map, addresses, etc.) and
the status (enabled/disabled) is not keept in my child projects.

Steps to reproduce:
- Create new project with QGIS 3.4.5
- Create 2 subgroups and add layers in it (keep them enabled)
- Save project as Ref.qgs
- Close project
- Create a new one
- Add all layers/groups from Ref.qgs
- The layers are activated but not the layergroups --> So the layers are
not visible in the map (for me it's already not wanted)
- Activate all layergroups (ctrl+click on layergroups)
- Save the project as Child.qgs
- Open Child.qgs --> The state of layers is not kept, so the layers are
still not visible (for me this is a bug)

To resume the structure of Ref.qgs (all layers and layergroups are
activated):
- Layergroup A
-- Layer A1
-- Layer A2
- Layergroup B
-- Layer B1
-- Layer B2

Is it the same on your side? It was working well in 2.18.

Thanks for your feedback on this point.

Rémi

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Disable primary key unicity check
Message-ID: <CAC_adirOk511b65wF8j_qhsHvXRi24FyUN27+aGd++-vYEAZ0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I posted this earlier in the QGis Issue Tracker (
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/21839 ) but it did not gain much traction.

I noticed that initial loading time of large PostgreSQL views (> 10 million
records) seems to have increased considerably compared to QGis 2. After
observing the db logs, seems the sql query for checking primary key unicity
is one of the causes for this. From the API documentation I had the
impression that this behaviour could be disabled by setting the property
TrustLayerMetadata on the project to true (in the GUI under project
properties or through pyqgis). This only makes a difference while opening a
project, not when loading new PG layers in an open project.

So I tried setting the parameter checkPrimaryKeyUnicity to '0' in several
ways (editing an exported QLR layer definition file and through pyqgis) but
also without result. The parameter checkPrimaryKeyUnicity in the edited URI
of the QLR file is ignored. For pyqgis, it seems, in case of a postgres
provider, the parameter checkPrimaryKeyUnicity set on the QgsDatasourecUri
instance is overriden depending on the provided layerOptions (more specific
the readExtentFromXml option) specified on the QgsVectorLayer class:

*bool QgsVectorLayer::setDataProvider( QString const &provider, const
QgsDataProvider::ProviderOptions &options )*
*{*
*  mProviderKey = provider;     // XXX is this necessary?  Usually already
set*

*  // primary key unicity is tested at construction time, so it has to be
set*
*  // before initializing postgres provider*
*  QString checkUnicityKey = QStringLiteral( "checkPrimaryKeyUnicity" );*
*  QString dataSource = mDataSource;*
*  if ( provider.compare( QLatin1String( "postgres" ) ) == 0 )*
*  {*
*    QgsDataSourceUri uri( dataSource );*

*    if ( uri.hasParam( checkUnicityKey ) )*
*      uri.removeParam( checkUnicityKey );*

*    uri.setParam( checkUnicityKey, mReadExtentFromXml ? "0" : "1" );*
*    dataSource = uri.uri( false );*
*  }*
*...*

So the only way to influence the parameter is by specifying the
readExtentFromXml layeroption. Is there a reason for this construction?

I always was impressed with the loading of postgis layers in QGis 2 but
this has considerably changed in QGis 3. Therefore I wonder if there's a
way to specify the checkPrimaryKeyUnicity in the GUI or by changing the URI
strig of a datasource?

best regards and keep up the good work,

Tom

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Globally setting FI_POINT_TOLERANCE on QGIS server
Message-ID: <8753969d6ccb53e9d413510db09567e9@carto.net>

Hi, 

I wonder if it is possible to globally set/influence the
FI_POINT_TOLERANCE in QGIS server? 

We'd like to configure QGIS server such, that by default it is a bit
more tolerant (using a larger search radius) for point features. 

I know that the client can set the FI_POINT_TOLERANCE on GetFeatureInfo
request, but what if the client doesn't know about QGIS and these
special parameters? 

Could this be set globally in QGIS server by an environment variable? 

Thanks for your reply and greetings, 

Andreas

No, that's not possible.

Hi!
I need your help. I need to Create a numbers sequentially in a "Points
shapefile"  with a spacial pattern.
For example, the point number 1 start northwestern and the next  numbers
points will be order from west to east. For the next row (to South) going
from west to east too.
And so on, the values points increase to the south. Therefore the last
point will be in the southeast.
For now I'm doing manual but it is around 1,000 points!

I hope that you understand my situation. Can you help me? I could send you
the shapefile with an example better explained

Thanks,

Ana

Hi René-Luc and David, 

Excellent - Thanks for providing it. I will test and report back. But I
won't have time to test it before Thursday because I am giving a QGIS
course tomorrow. 

Seems like we are all hitting similar issues with QGIS server ;-) good
that there is something we can do about it. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

I confirm, another issue is that you create/drop a new layer in an embedded
group.
I opened an issue here https://issues.qgis.org/issues/21863

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] issues with constraints(?)
Message-ID: <CACfnYnQ+n-VPoNN2fKBEMMVmRgo2xn3Nqcsk1xQ-4GHAN_5W=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have some questions on table/attributes constraints, not sure if it
is me I don't understand how they work or if they are issues. I would
appreciate a clarification.

1) they seem to work while adding a new feature or when updating the
attributes using feature form that opens using the identify tool, but
not they do not work in the table of attributes both in table view or
form view. Is this expected?

2) the "not null" constraint works if the attribute shows "NULL" while
does not not if the cell is empty. While I understand the difference
between NULL and empty, for the vast majority of users NULL=empty. Is
this the intended behavior or is a bug? if it is the former than I
would suggest add a "not empty" option

3) I have difficulties in understand how the "expression" and
"expression description" work: if I choose a column for the former and
fill the latter (that is optional) with some kind of text, then when
reopening the vector properties I find the description in the
"expression" and the column name in the "expression description".

thanks in advance

Hi devs,

Thanks Paolo for your agreement.

I'd like to fix the QGIS Sever regression before friday and the version 
3.4.7 released.

So I'd like to have other point of view  about backporting : 
[needs-docs][layouts] Add checkbox to disable raster tiling for PDF/SVG 
exports https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9016
and finalizing Fix regression server print selection pdf release 3.4  
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9692

Thanks.

Hi,

I'm looking for a core developer willing to fix issue #21839, related to
the primary key unicty check on PostgreSQL views in QGis 3, in return for a
financial contribution.

It would suffice if it would already be possible to specify the
checkPrimaryKeyUnicity parameter in the datasource uri of a QLR or QGS
project file. For the moment this parameter is ignored/overriden for a
PostgreSQL dataprovider. No need for GUI changes.

As we would like to stick to the 3.4 LTR version backporting would also be
appreciated.

best regards,

Tom Vanzieleghem

Hi Tom,

Did you try to uncheck project property "Trust project when data source has
no metadata" ?

Hi Alessandro,

I’ve indeed tried that option and it partially solves the issue but only when loading db layers while opening an existing project. It does not have any effect when adding a new db layer.

Best Regards,

Tom

Hi Ana,

Your question is more related with QGIS usage. This list is mostly for
QGIS development. Can you please use the "QGIS-user" [1] list for this
issue?

In QGIS-user you will get a broader audience of power users that can
recommend you simple tricks (like sorting the points using an expression
on x and y). Here [QGIS-Develpment] you can end by writing C++ code ;-)

Good luck,

Jorge Gustavo

Message-ID: <CAGKduJ2LhMQkQ=7gbP5f-YzKgExxuRFOkfoHVhOTj28EzQyEmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm testing the Dockerhub's camptocamp qgis-server running on docker, but
it seems that it has some problems (i.e. not rendering labels).
Furthermore, it seems strange that I cannot find any repository about this
Dockerfile.
I see that there another, like openquake.

Which one do you use? I'm trying to use the one that supports QGIS 3 LTR
(at moment 3.4.6).

Thank you in advance :-)

Hi,

We (at 3liz) publish a qgis docker platform to be used as base image for running  qgis server or other qgis based application:

The docker file is on github: https://github.com/3liz/docker-qgis-platform <https://github.com/3liz/docker-qgis-platform> and you can pull images from dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/3liz/qgis-platform <https://hub.docker.com/r/3liz/qgis-platform>

We have images from release (buster), nigtly-release (buster),  ltr (stretch),  nightly-ltr (stretch)

You will find a full-featured/ready-to-run qgis-server here: https://hub.docker.com/r/3liz/qgis-map-server <https://hub.docker.com/r/3liz/qgis-map-server> (Dockerfile at: https://github.com/3liz/docker-qgis-server <https://github.com/3liz/docker-qgis-server>) 

These images are based on the qgis.org <http://qgis.org/> debian packages and not from a custom build.   

If you plan to run qgis server, you may need to start a frame-buffered X server with Xvfb, if not, fonts are not found by Qt and no labels are rendered.

See here for an example a starting an Xvfb server before running a qgis server: https://github.com/3liz/docker-qgis-server/blob/master/docker-entrypoint.sh#L33

David,

Panos literally implemented Nyal Dawson's excellent recommendation(s)
[0, 1, 2] and exposing a GRASS GIS module/add-on is easy. An example is
the QGIS plugin [3] for the `r.estimap.recreation` plugin [4].

[0] https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2019-February/056155.html
[1] https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2019-February/056285.html
[2] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9202
[3] https://gitlab.com/natcapes/natcapes_qgis
[4] https://gitlab.com/natcapes/r.estimap.recreation

This makes the process as easy as never before, as far as I understand.
In my humble view, this should be further adopted and advertised.

On/Off-topic (Cc-ing also the qgis-developer mailing list):

I left from the `r.estimap.recreation` project leaving behind one
remaining issue-to-solve: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/21322.

This issue concerns only the interface and does not affect the
core work of exposing a GRASS GIS add-on inside QGIS' Processing
Framework. Nevertheless, in my humble view, this issue is important to
the GRASS GIS community and having an up-to-date documentation will save
our time from figuring out how the interface related api works.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Bug in QgsPathResolver ?
Message-ID: <045935D8-93BD-495E-AB91-0B082A72E22E@3liz.com>

Hi devs,

I have  a strange behavior with QgsPathResolver that prevent layer to be loaded if a QgsProject read config file from relative path:

The problem has been reduced to the following behavior (pyQgis):

```
# Init a QgsPathResolver as with a relative path
pr = QgsPathResolver('./geography/data/france_parts.qgs')

pr.readPath('./france_parts/france_parts.shp')
# Output -> '/geography/data/france_parts/france_parts.shp' 
# Note the leading '/'
```

Worst:
```
pr = QgsPathResolver('../geography/data/france_parts.qgs')

pr.readPath('./france_parts/france_parts.shp')
# Output -> '/../geography/data/france_parts/france_parts.shp' 
# which is a meaningless path
```

The side effect is that if you do:
```
prj = QgsProject()
prj.read("./geography/data/france_parts.qgs")
```
then you get the error:
```
Qgis OGR: Cannot open /geography/data/france_parts/france_parts.shp.()
Qgis : 1 unavailable layers found:
Qgis :  * ./france_parts/france_parts.shp
```

This is with Qgis 3.6.1

Can anybody confirm that this behavior is a bug ? I will submit a PR  if this is the case.
Thanks,

Cheers
David

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Cannot save raster data in formats like NetCDF
Message-ID: <3f056e70-22a5-cc97-0d91-f1898af5d3c3@mailbox.org>

Hi list,

I wish to report a bug I've discovered when using QGIS Desktop.
Unfortunately, I cannot login to the bugtracker (never received an
activation email), so I'm reporting the bug on this list.

Saving raster data in formats like NetCDF is broken for me in operations
like "Clip Raster to Extent", because GDAL is run with the wrong output
format.

I can reproduce that by:
- opening e.g. "Clip Raster to Extent" dialog
- setting "Input layer" and "Clipping extent"
- setting "Clipped (extent)" to a (non-existing) NetCDF file

Expected Result:
The output format parameter of the shown GDAL command is "-of NetCDF".

Actual Result:
The output format parameter of the shown GDAL command is "-of GMT". When
run, GDAL exits with an error, telling it does not know format 'GMT'.


As a workaround, I'm just running the (corrected) GDAL command in my
terminal.

I'm using QGIS 3.6.1 and GDAL 2.3.2 on Arch Linux.

Greetings,
Felix

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS and GeoNode
Message-ID: <1555915714991-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi
I am looking for a solution for our QGIS users to easily publish data sets
and web maps, either using a web based client or directly from QGIS. The
QGIS/GeoNode integration looks interesting and I have a few questions:

- Is support for QGIS Server backend enabled in the standard release of
GeoNode?

- Is it correct that the QGIS Server backend will render the cartography, as
long as the server and the project file uses the same version (such as
3.4.5)?

- The user creates a web map from the web client, not from QGIS by using a
function like "Publish as web map using GeoNode", correct?

- Now that QGIS is getting better at 3D for each release, are there any
plans on support for publishing 3D web maps using GeoNode?

- Are there any public installations of GeoNode with QGIS Server backend?

Regards,

Magnus

I’ll need Rizky (in CC) to respond to this, but it hopefully yes.

We still need to migrate our work to 3.x so currently things are set up to work with QGIS 2.18.

Correct.

We don’t have current plans for this, but are always open to look at it if there is funding….

https://geonode.ingc.gov.mz <https://geonode.ingc.gov.mz/> is one we set up.

If you like docker and rancher, we have a Rancher Catalogue recipe where you can fairly easily spin up your own instance to test it:

https://github.com/kartoza/kartoza-rancher-catalogue <https://github.com/kartoza/kartoza-rancher-catalogue>
https://github.com/kartoza/kartoza-rancher-catalogue/blob/master/templates/geonode/README.md <https://github.com/kartoza/kartoza-rancher-catalogue/blob/master/templates/geonode/README.md> 

The GeoNode is not the most recent there but it should give you the idea.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Using QgsMapCanvas in a python plugin dialog
Message-ID: <CADfa=12JcUx09utHMG9eTRJ-f41A1kqAinE2EtsQ6-S6VxzjgQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm unsuccessfully trying to use a QgsMapCanvas in a python plugin's dialog.

The canvas renders the map, which appears and disappears the first time I
load the dialog. The second time I load the dialog, the map is rendered and
remains. However, I've only accomplished this by using
waitWhileRendering(), which I know is incorrect.

I have posted a minimal plugin on GitHub (
https://github.com/ebrelsford/qgis-map-canvas-test/) demonstrating this
issue. It was created using Plugin Builder. The relevant parts will be the
.ui file:


https://github.com/ebrelsford/qgis-map-canvas-test/blob/master/map_canvas_test_dialog_base.ui#L15

and the dialog python file:


https://github.com/ebrelsford/qgis-map-canvas-test/blob/master/map_canvas_test_dialog.py#L55

Is anyone familiar with what I'm doing wrong here? Or does anyone know
python plugins using QgsMapCanvas in the dialog that I could use as a
reference? I'd appreciate any thoughts you have on it!

Hi
Thanks for the reply, Tim.

We will soon be moving from QGIS 2.18 to 3.4, so the current GeoNode/QGIS
Server solution only supporting 2.18 seems like a problem.

I guess it´s OK for our users to create their web maps from the web client,
but it would be even better if they could do it without leaving QGIS.

3D web map support is not required at the moment for us, but it could be of
interest later on.

I´ll see if I can get started with the Rancher catalogue.

Regards,

Magnus

	QGIS plugins
Message-ID: <525f816e-baac-b90d-6ea1-942b72b54ad4@hsr.ch>

Heya all

What Python modules (beyond the "qgis" module provided by QGIS itself 
and the ones built into the Python language or included in its standard 
library) can QGIS plugins expect to be accessible?

Or asked the other way around: When packaging QGIS (e.g. for a Linux 
distribution), what Python modules do I have to make available in its 
Python, so that plugins may use it?

While one could probably determine this by looking at existing packaging 
efforts, e.g. the dependencies of Ubuntu package "python3-qgis" from 
https://qgis.org/ubuntu-ltr, I wonder whether this isn't already 
documented somewhere, as this should be of interest for both plugin 
authors and application packagers.

My context: I'm trying to improve the QGIS experience on NixOS and other 
NixPkgs-based installations and would like to do that "right" rather 
than basing my changes on guesswork. I've collected my current findings 
on https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/59842

Kind regards,
Raphael

The dependencies of python3-qgis are It's "documented" in debian/control.in
([0]).

I don't quite understand. (Maybe there's just a full-stop missing in 
your message between "are" and "It's"?) Are you saying that the 
dependencies of python3-qgis are "documented" (and that they are 
"documented" in 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/debian/control.in#L370) or are 
you saying that these dependencies actually are the "documentation" of 
what Python modules QGIS plugins are allowed to rely on (and implying 
that no other (or no more official) documentation/specification about 
that topic exists)?

Kind regards,
Raphael

Yes, control.in lists the dependencies that installed with the (debian) package
- and those are the only ones you can actually rely on (installing via pip
might not work everywhere and shouldn't be done anyway for packages the
distribution already can provide).

I don't know of any other documentation (except for the osgeo4w qgis-full*
setup.hint files - that are essentially the same thing [0]) - and if there was
it would problably be old and out of sync.

The main issue for 3.x support is that we need to port the ‘on the fly project’ creation QGIS Server plugin that makes a QGIS project for a layer on the fly so that we can serve it up via QGIS Server. Other than that I actually don’t think it is a massive amount of work to migrate everything to 3.x.

The workflows here are more tricky since we would need to parse out QGIS Project layers that are not available from within the GeoNode context. I agree though it would be a cool feature to add.

Is it, though? As far as I can see that includes SciPy and Shapely, 
which the control.in file 
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/debian/control.in) doesn't.

So it seems there is no authoritative source that the Debian/Ubuntu 
package definitions, OSGeo4W and the OS X installer (and all the plugin 
developers) can rely on as a common base. Doesn't this lead to 
compatibility problems?

This list (under "Used Python3 modules") seems to include even more than 
the OSGeo4W one does. Some of those might be build-only dependencies 
(though, are they then available at plugin runtime anyway?) or effects 
of differing packaging granularity, others are maybe indirect 
dependencies that the `*.deb` based systems (and OSGeo4W?) would pull in 
transitively, but I guess not all can be explained by that. So I'm 
pretty sure that QGIS plugins on different platforms will have a 
different set of modules available.

I've posted a comparison of control.in vs. setup.hint vs. 
lutraconsulting installer at 
https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/59842#issuecomment-485832623 
(Click "Details" in that comment to see it.)

It seems to me like currently, plugin developers have to limit 
themselves to a common subset of these if they want their plugins to be 
interoperable between different QGIS installations of the same version. 
Do they do that? Do they even know?

For the time being, I think I'll use the Debian/Ubuntu dependencies as a 
guideline for NixOS, as both are Linux operating systems. For 
simplicity, I'll probably at least initially leave out PyQt5.QtWebKit 
though, hoping that no plugins actually use it.

Kind regards,
Raphael

Correct.


> Doesn't this lead to compatibility problems?

Yes, but the list is not set in stone - often when somebody mentions something
it will be included quickly (in osgeo4w for instance).

It lists also secondary dependencies (eg. idna, certifi, cffi) - that will also
available for debian and osgeo4w and will be pulled in.

Hm, there is stuff missing - xlrd & xlrw are also in qgis-full.

And do they have to?  Stuff can also be installed afterwards if necessary.  The
problem is just that there are platform differences on how that is done.

qgis2web uses QtWebKit

Isn't this an odd/dangerous/fragile situation to begin with? I'd be in
favour of requiring QgsPathResolver to accept only absolute paths in
the constructor.

Hi,

That would mean that only absolute may be passed to QgsProjet::read(), why not, it's  a decision to make; I cannot
tell it there would be side effects or not.

but IMHO, in all case,  I think we should have explicite error/warnings and not end with 
meaningless path (see below) and ' unavailable layers found' errors which is confusing.

Regards
David,

I believe I got this working by making the mapLayers a member of the dialog
rather than a variable created in show(). For anyone who is curious or runs
into this in the future, this commit worked for me:

Message-ID: <CA+T_MsLo5U0jM2qaXkiedMvweT3TknwZW+mpz-oiB05Z4J90Ng@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

would it be possible to remove/archive this repo
https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev ?  I think it brings more
confusion than good for new Mac developers. Only with some value in it is
README.md
<https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/blob/master/development/README.md> ,
but as it is unmaintained it has some mistakes already. I think that part
of it is already in qgis's INSTALL and part could be just published as blog
post.

I am not maintainer of the repo, so I do not have these rights.
Thanks,
Peter

Hi

Thats fine for me too - I also contributed a bit to the home-brew docs … but….

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/osx.t2t <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/osx.t2t> is really out of date (still referring to Qt4) so can you clarify where the canonical macOS docs are currently?

Also we did a very detailed developer environment setup here:

https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/blob/master/development/README.md <https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/blob/master/development/README.md>

That I would not like to see lost - we should update it or replace it if there is something better out there.

Regards

Tim

Others do as well: for example, I noticed by chance that go2mapillary does.
I'm sure plenty of others do too.

Dear Qgis,

I work on a MSI  GL 62 6QF laptop with Nvidia GTX960 with 8GB of RAM.
I intalled Qgis standalone 3.4.6, 3.4.7and 3.6 several times but after using it for give or take 5 minutes it freezes. I cant click on anything and it will not shut down using the red cross top right on the screen (I have to open the task manager and force it to shut down Qgis).
I tried reinstalling it. Also tried to install it on an other drive and folders.
Do you know how I can solve this problem?

Thank you in advance,

Ricardo Hofman


Met vriendelijke groet,

Ricardo Hofman

Hi all

I am experiencing issues with my data being shifted in 3.7. Here is the scene from QGIS 3.4:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/178003/56698970-a69a7980-66eb-11e9-9dc9-ffd4e1d1aa1a.png

And here is the same scene in QGIS 3.7

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/178003/56698977-ab5f2d80-66eb-11e9-9b5e-125429a59c08.png

I am using EPSG:20790.

QGIS revision is https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/d3f6a5f9be <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/d3f6a5f9be> (Lutra 3.7 package for Mac from a week or two back).

I’m attaching a minimal project that can be used to replicate the issue.

Does anyone else experience this issue?

Regards

Tim

Nyall is working with proj 6 integration and from what I understood 6.0 has
unexpected with QGIS, 6.1 (may) should solve the issue.
But Nyall would have a more precise explanation I guess.

I've been building proj6 here with gdal 2.4.

But (without modifications )I've not been able to build QGIS master with
it yet.

Not sure if it is helpfull, both with and without (earlier suggested):
 -DACCEPT_USE_OF_DEPRECATED_PROJ_API_H=1
or
 -DACCEPT_USE_OF_DEPRECATED_PROJ_API_H=0

I get:

/home/richard/git/qgisgdal/src/core/qgscoordinatereferencesystem.cpp: In
static member function ‘static int
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::syncDatabase()’:
/home/richard/git/qgisgdal/src/core/qgscoordinatereferencesystem.cpp:2249:3:
error: ‘projCtx’ was not declared in this scope
   projCtx pContext = pj_ctx_alloc();

/home/richard/git/qgisgdal/src/core/qgscoordinatereferencesystem.cpp:2249:3:
note: suggested alternative: ‘projCtx_t’
   projCtx pContext = pj_ctx_alloc();
   ^~~~~~~
   projCtx_t

Happy to test build if it is helpful, but I'm afraid I cannot be helpful
with fixing the build though :(

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

last "building" commit on master with proj6 is
d3f6a5f9be9692c4ce232178df144f64a228955a
Nyall will probably fix master with proj6 next week.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to split QGISMapLayer attribute "source" into
	parts (python)
Message-ID: <CAAJbAXuEJ9m26MEa=40fTcy6VO_e6aYTT1H0MO7VHRkXCso06Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all -

I have a python plugin where I iterate through all vectorlayers and get the
source for each layer using

mySource = myVectorLayer.source()

The result could be something like this: (one line)

restrictToRequestBBOX='1' srsname='EPSG:25832'
typename='dai:theme-pg-natura2000_omraader_habitatnatur' url='
http://wfs2-miljoegis.mim.dk/dai/ows?version=1.1.0' table="" sql=

The question:  - How can i split this string into parts ? (In this
case: restrictToRequestBBOX,
srsname, typename, url, sql)

The obvious method is to use ex.:   myList = mySource.split(' ')

But that depends on that no part id or value contains a "blank"

Is there a more secure method to do the spiltting?

I use:

from urllib.parse import parse_qs

d = parse_qs(layer.source())
if 'tileMatrixSet' in d:
    useWMTS = True
    wmts_url = d['url'][0].replace("request=getcapabilities", "")
    wmts_layer = d['layers'][0]
    wmts_format = d['format'][0]
    wmts_crs = d['crs'][0]
    wmts_style = d['styles'][0]
    wmts_tileMatrixSet = d['tileMatrixSet'][0]

Source is here:

Hope this helps

Use QgsDataSourceUri -- that's what it's designed for.

so something like

    uri = QgsDataSourceUri(layer.source())
    table = uri.table()
    user = uri.username()
    restrict_bbox = uri.param("restrictToRequestBBOX")

etc

For non-db layers (eg disk based OGR/GDAL layers, you should use
QgsProviderRegistry.instance().decodeUri(layer.source())

ciao,
sorry if I still propose to your attention the problem of updating the
translation of the LTR version.
starting from [1] I didn't understand how to work.
Is it possible to have a very brief guide on the operations to do, as
proposed by delazj in [2]?

thank you so much

	QgsFeatureRequest
Message-ID: <CAOM0XWBOeujr6CujW1UjcY3Acbce=fFKBGgoWRsSxu57ydDsxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings Everyone,

While working on my PR (9648) I noticed that expression filter and a list
of feature IDs are both considered the same thing cannot be used as two
filtering criteria.

I am aware that the intent was to only have one element active to filter
out features other than the rectangle(? might be wrong on that one).

What I am wondering if it would be a good thing to have both co exist
(mostly for my PR as of now). A simply way to do so would be to use the
give feature ids as the list to iterate over and check for the expression
if there is one.

I assume that such a thing might be implemented without touching the
current behaviour, otherwise one would have to remove either the expression
or the IDs in some case when we want to override the current filtering
method.

Using multiple filtering method might be better than only forcing one and
would provide more flexibility.

As I have a PR that is related to this (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9816 ) I would like to address this point
in it and would like to have the discussion occur there as to the best way
to implement such a thing without any breakage if people are not opposed to
having only one filtering method in qgsfeaturerequest.

Thanks and have a nice day!

Alex

I also think this would be desirable. The tricky part (well, one
tricky part -- feature iterators are low level stuff, lots of
complexity there!) is avoiding any API breakage while adding new
methods to handle your use case.

The other (SUPER) tricky bit is that any change to feature requests
usually requires accompanying changes to every vector data provider in
order to keep consistent behaviour across all these providers. The
same request should always give the same result, regardless of the
actual underlying data provider. The consequence of this is that
you'll need to be update the postgres, mssql, oracle, OGR, memory,
spatialite, wfs, arcgis feature server, db2, and vector layer feature
iterator code. You'll also need to add many new unit tests to cover
all the changes to the different providers.

Definitely not a trivial change! Don't let this put you off making it,
but just be aware that this change would take even a QGIS core
developer a week or more of work to implement.

Hi,

I'm on a corporate windows environment here, and trying to install a

Earlier installs went fine, but today I receive (and the second time, 
even after a full fresh install):

Does this ring a bell?

It could be that Windows Admins have made these machines 'more

Hi all,
until now we discouraged the inclusion of external python libraries in
python plugins. I still think this is the right, clean approach. I just
want to check with main core devs if there are strong reasons to change
the approach.
Thanks for comments.

Greetings Mr. Dawson,

Thanks for the reply,

The tests that I did with the method in my PR was provider agnostic but
still entailed looping over every feature to do the check. Could you
provide idea or methods that could enable this behaviour in an API friendly
way?

Should I make a new iterator entirely or should I modify existing methods
and add a trigger like I tested in my PR?

Thanks!
Alexis Roy-Lizotte

Not really.  -1073741819 is c0000005 in hex - which apparently is an access
violation.  Can you run the scripts in etc/postinstall manually from the
osgeo4w shell?

Hi,

I like the idea of a nicer API to combine several filter conditions.
Currently the only possibility to perform this operation is to write a
filter expression as a string or by combining expression nodes.

I am not convinced however that this should be done directly on
QgsFilterRequest level. It feels a bit like reimplementing the
expression engine on another level again.

Some questions that come to my mind:

 * Are these filters always combined with AND or also OR?

 * Can these filters eventually be nested?

 * How should we deal with compiling expressions, should that be
implemented again?

An alternative approach would be to work on a nicer API for an
expression builder to require 1) less string manipulation when building
an expression and 2) have more introspection capabilities when
manipulating an expression.

Regards

Matthias

Greetings Mr.Kuhn,

Well in my case the fact that each symbol node is evaluated add some lenght
to the computation, if I can make something that would only iterate over a
given list of Fids, (and at the same time prevent having to iterate over
each feature to check if that feature is within the given list of feature)
we would move from something that takes x by n loops to something that
would only take around x loop ( where x is the number of features and n is
the number of symbol).

For other use case the gain might be minimal. Other similar behaviour could
be used with selected features (though I'm not sure if this is a perfect
match for this also.)

This gain in efficiency is why I want to alter the iterator itself rather
than fiddling with expressions, despite the fact that this is also a
possibility but far less optimal for the reason mentioned above.

I just want to know what would be the best way to alter the iteration
process without breaking and in a way that could be leveraged.

Thanks.

Alexis Roy-Lizotte

Hi,

An expression `attribute = 'major_road' AND $id IN (1,2,3)` should have
the same result on the number of features in the iterator. Or I am
missing something.

Hi,

Well I could rework iterators to use the provided Fids as the base list to
iterate over, this would mean that instead of checking every feature for
each evaluation ( from what I'm seeing each evaluation goes through every
feature and check for either the id number or if the expression is true.)
If we are doing 3 evaluation on 3 distinct symbols, this mean that every
feature will be iterated over 3 times. Because each features are checked
one by one for each of the 3 expression to evaluate.

By using Fids as the base list and incrementing the index of it, each
feature should be evaluated only once and no Fids check would be necessary.
(Assuming a simple legend with a depth of one.)

This would drasticly speed up things when many loops are required on a
single feature.

Sorry, I lost you here.

I think for both proposals three QgsFeatureRequests will need to be
created, requested and iterators generated.

Can you paste a minimal code sample here that demonstrates the use of
your proposed API?

Thanks Matthias

lib or python eggs, IMHO do not generate problems if used in the plugin
code without modify pythonpath for the all the env.

Am I wrong?

Hi

Yeah I also don’t remember any specific policy discouraging it, and as long as they are namespaces nicely it is nicer IMHO than requiring users to go and manually fetch extra packages so your plugin will work.

Hi,

I also was under the impression that this it's ok to ship dependencies
within plugins.

One of the major blockers towards a better world (TM) is that no
pip(-like) tool to auto-install dependency packages at runtime is
available on all platforms (looking at you, Windows). Meanwhile shipping
dep libraries as wheels/eggs/... sounds like the best user experience a
plugin dev can deliver.

Regards

Matthias

Hi all,
thanks for comments. We have always encouraged devs to use shared libs,
and to declare dependencies in metadata. I see two problems in letting
anybody including wildly:
* code duplication: with hundreds of plugins, reinstalling the same
libraries over and over, possibly in different versions, does not look
the Right Thing To Do to me; when needed, commonly used libs have been
included (thanks Juerghen!) in osgeo4w standalone installer, a much
cleaner solution IMHO; of course, in Linux this would only be a burden
with no significant advantages. In addition, this encourages devs to
take shortcuts, patching and forking libs, including older versions
instead of upgrading, etc.; to me this sounds a bit like windows vs
linux approach
* licences: I should check then the licences of all the libraries
embedded, that often do not include a LICENCE file.
Cheers.

I think the only reason to discourage the inclusion (IF we did, I'm not
sure) is that some modules are not cross platform (but most smaller ones
are) or are just too big to include.
Some (eg Requests) made live really easier (though we have alternatives
I think). And others were just needed but not appropriate to bundle with
QGIS.

So I would think it is ok to include them as long it is practical.

We also have been talking about some mechanisme to make it possible to
(pip)-install from within QGIS, some kind of virtual environment within
QGIS.
But that is to be done.... :-)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GDAL Coordinate System Barn Raising follow up
Message-ID: <1556654738126-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all!

I have been invited to the first Open Source Conference on GIS and Remote
Sensing in Costa Rica, part of the Geo For All, since I have been a devout
follower of PROJ, GDAL and QGIS. I think it is a great opportunity to
explain the way in which coordinate reference systems are implemented and
used in software such as QGIS that are used by end users that do not
necessarily understand the complexity of such developments. 

I want to promote the initiative "/GDAL Coordinate System Barn Raising/"
because in Costa Rica  has recently been a change of CRS - from CRTM05 (EPSG
5367) to CR-SIRGAS (EPSG 8909) - this is a hot topic at this moment. I want
to be able to explain how is the development and implementation of the CRS
and how they arrive at softwares like QGIS that are used by end users with
different skill levels. 

I've been talking to Even Rouault from PROJ about the new GDAL Coordinate
System Barn Raising and how this affects the final users of softwares like
QGIS and PostgreSQL / PostGIS.

for QGIS users, I have the following: Even told me: "/From what I've
understood, PostGIS will still ship its spatial_ref_sys.sql database (since
it is part of its user visible surface), and will so have to refresh it
regularly from the PROJ database. For QGIS, I think the intent will be to
use ultimately the PROJ database/" "/...Will require all QGIS builds to use
PROJ 6/"

Now this, makes me the following question: if PROJ already  contains the new
CRS CR-SIRGAS (8909) according to this commit
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1368.
QGIS would have to implement the new PROJ6 so that users here in CR can have
access to the new CRS. however, this I suppose, is planned for the version
QGIS 3.8 What generates me doubt is how is it going to be handled with the
QGIS LTR version?

in other words, how QGIS will handle the updates of the new coordinate
reference systems? Is a new version required each time? or can they be
updated by a pointreleases?

I think many countries are on track to continue updating the CRS and I want
to know how QGIS is going to be maintained with the most up-to-date EPSG
databases.

this in order to be able to explain to the users of QGIS here in CR how it
is expected to implement the update of the new CR-SIRGAS (8909) Since many
governmental institutions currently use QGIS for their daily processes.

Thank you very much for the help in this topic.

Greetings,

Yes as far as the number of request and iterator the same number would be
created, there is no workaround for that.

I'll try to set up a prototype PR if I can get the time to make up
something.

Should I work only in the base featurerequest/iterator or do it in a
provider? I'm not too sure when the base one and the dedicated one are used
in QGIs.

And should I got for a dedicated iteration method or simply add a trigger
to be in line with current API standards.

Thanks,

Alexis Roy-Lizotte

I, too, am fine with this repo being removed, after a culling of pertinent

It would be good if someone updated that or added something more relevant,
e.g. based upon current 'osgeo-' prefixed formulae in OSGeo4Mac [1], etc.

I am currently working in a different packaging system and am not intending
to work with Homebrew or OSGeo4Mac in the near future. So, unfortunately, I
can not spend time on any documentation re-writes for awhile.

,Greetings,
I'm going over iterators for the prototype and it would appear that the OGR
iterator uses by default the filtered fids (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrfeatureiterator.cpp#L48
)

Though I'm not too sure about how this interacts with expression, maybe
this is done in the core of the iterator, but nonetheless part of the work
seem to already be done to some extent.

having inspected hundreds of plugins in the last years, I'm still unsure
this is a good approach. I think it induces bad habits (e.g. one plugin
had a modified gdal command, so these improvements were essentially
lost). For the very same reasons, this practice is formally forbidden
e.g. in Debian. I'm aware this puts some extra strain on developers and
users, but results in better software in the long term.

this seems quite right to me.

Cheers, and thanks for comments.
