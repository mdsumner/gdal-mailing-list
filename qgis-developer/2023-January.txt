Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Some PROJ versions are not compatible with QGIS on
 Linux instances
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqqGvstXxE=9SUeSS1hxzQviapHeCJdZQ7G7vLKOa604A@mail.gmail.com>

I don't know if this is something I should report or not. I keep getting
users submitting issues for the Lat Lon Tools plugin on Ubuntu or Fedora
because they are using a recent pyproj library and it is causing a crash. I
have them check to see if "import pyproj" works from the python console
which it invariably does not. The error is not with Lat Lon Tools, it is
likely with this call

epsg4326 = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem('EPSG:4326')

which is called during initialization and it is because the newer versions
of PROJ seem to be incompatible.

I just have to tell them to use a QGIS supported version of PROJ.

This is just to raise awareness that there is an issue which I'm sure will
be resolved at some point.

Thanks,

Calvin

It sounds like if "import pyproj" in python crashes, without doing
anything qgis-ish, then the issue is not "pyproj not compatible" but
"broken version of pyproj".

Can you in plugin init, do essentially try import except, and display an
error that init failed because the pyproj could not be loaded, and this
is not a latlontools issue?

Which pyproj is bad? 

Is this an upstream bug or a packaging bug?

Does it happen with a bad pyproj with all proj, or all pyproj with some
proj or ?

Is there a proj or pyproj bug open?

It's a side-issue, but what do you need pyproj for? Everything
**should** be possible through the native qgis classes and avoiding
pyproj imports would help to avoid issues like this in the first
place. (Of course, if you're needing geopandas then the pyproj import
isn't something you can control!)

Double check that these users aren't installing pyproj via pip --
that'll end up with multiple incompatible proj library versions
installed on the system. They should be using pyproj from the Fedora
repos only.

Hi David,

Have a nice new year :)

Are you sure to use the right path(es)? Your first one is for a Windows 
system, the second one for an Unix-like system ...

On my boxes, both places are empty, there is absolutely nothing to 
update within.


In my understanding, the documentation for R scripts in QGIS [1] 
describes another scenario. Perhaps it could be helpful to read the 
chapters 24.10.5 and especially 24.10.6?

[1] 
https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/processing/3rdParty.html#id13

Maybe that I am totally wrong here, but I think QGIS uses an R 
installation, already present on the system. This R installation should 
have the needed R packages installed and updated. In QGIS, you tell the 
QGIS R provider in its processing settings, where to find this installation.

HTH.

Best wishes,
Rainer

Message-ID: <24b929afdebaf5bd5b07964852841530@carto.net>

Hi,

This concerns PyQt code. I am trying to process attribute data on 
acceptance of a QgsAttributeDialog and can't find the correct signal 
name that I could attach my function to.

I tried

myDialog.accepted.connect(myFunction)

but it tells me

AttributeError: 'QgsAttributeForm' object has no attribute 'accepted'

Anyone has a hint what kind of signal I could use to process data on 
acceptance or closing of an attribute form?

Thanks,

Andreas

Oh - I see, i am dealing with the QgsAttributeForm and not the 
QgsAttributeDialog object. The QgsAttributeForm has a "closed" signal. I 
can attach to it, but it doesn't fire ;-(

Hi Andreas

QgsAttributeForm is a QWidget (no accepted there). Shouldn't myDialog be a
QgsAttributeDialog instead?

Cheers

Hi,

I got the "featureSaved" signal working (firing), but the "closed" 
signal is not triggered - no idea why ...

But I can work with the "featureSaved" signal - I am fine with that one.

Hi all,

Just a heads up, I have published a new QEP for cachable provider metadata.
This has the potential to improve the QGIS project loading times for
desktop as well as for web services.

  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/261

I'm looking forward to critical analysis and feedback.

Best wishes for 2023

Hi,

It is my pleasure to announce ( 
https://github.com/sozip/sozip-spec/blob/master/blog/01-announcement.md 
) the initial release of the specification ( 
https://github.com/sozip/sozip-spec/blob/master/sozip_specification.md ) 
for the SOZip (Seek-Optimized Zip) profile to the ZIP file format, as 
well as its GDAL implementation.

What is SOZip ?
----------------------

A Seek-Optimized ZIP file (SOZip) is a ZIP file that contains one or 
several Deflate-compressed files that are organized and annotated such 
that a SOZip-aware reader can perform very fast random access (seek) 
within a compressed file.

SOZip makes it possible to access large compressed files directly from a 
.zip file without prior decompression. It is not a new file format, but 
a profile of the existing ZIP format, done in a fully backward 
compatible way. ZIP readers that are non-SOZip aware can read a 
SOZip-enabled file normally and ignore the extended features that 
support efficient seek capability.

Use cases
--------------

The SOZip specification is intended to be general purpose / not domain 
specific. It was first developed to serve geospatial use cases, which 
commonly have large compressed files inside of ZIP archives. In 
particular, it makes it possible for users to read large GIS files using 
the Shapefile, GeoPackage or FlatGeobuf formats (which have no native 
provision for compression) compressed in .zip files without prior 
decompression.

Efficient random access and selective decompression are a requirement to 
provide acceptable performance in many usage scenarios: spatial index 
filtering, access to a feature by its identifier, etc.

Performance
------------------

SOZip is efficient:

* The overhead of using a file from a SOZip archive, compared to using 
it uncompressed, is of the order of 10% for common read operations.
* Generation of a SOZip file can be much faster than regular ZIP 
generation when using multithreading.
* SOZip files are typically only ~ 5% larger than regular ZIPs 
(dependent on content, and chunk size)

Have a look at benchmarking results: 
https://github.com/sozip/sozip-spec/blob/master/README.md#benchmarking

Other ZIP related specification
------------------------------------------

The SOZip GitHub organization also hosts the KeyValuePairs extra-field 
specification ( 
https://github.com/sozip/keyvaluepairs-spec/blob/master/zip_keyvalue_extra_field_specification.md 
), to be able to encode arbitrary key-value pairs of metadata associated 
with a file within a ZIP. For example to store the Content-Type of a file.

How does this relate to GDAL ?
-------------------------------------------

Pull request https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/7042 has been submitted 
with the following enhancements:

*? The /vsizip/ virtual file system uses the SOZip index to perform fast
 ??? random access within a compressed SOZip-enabled file.

* The Shapefile and GPKG drivers can directly generate SOZip-enabled 
.shz/.shp.zip or .gpkg.zip files.

*? Addition of the CPLAddFileInZip() C function that can compress a file 
and add
 ??? it to an new or existing ZIP file, and enable the SOZip 
optimization when relevant.

*? The existed VSIGetFileMetadata() method can be called on a filename of
 ??? the form /vsizip/path/to/the/file.zip/path/inside/the/zip/file and
 ??? with domain = "ZIP" to get information if a SOZip index is 
available for that file.

*? The sozip 
(https://github.com/rouault/gdal/blob/sozip/doc/source/programs/sozip.rst) 
new command line utility
 ??? can be used to create a seek-optimized ZIP file, to append files to 
an existing ZIP file, list the
 ??? contents of a ZIP file and display the SOZip optimization status or 
validate a SOZip file.

Best regards,

Even

Hi Even,

Cool!

Out of curiosity: I thought sqlite/geopackage was already relatively 'skinny' packed? Am I wrong?

Anybody has experience with zipping "laaaarge zipped GeoPackages"? ;-) Is that useful? I just tested a 885MB mbtiles file (I know not geopackage...but still sqlite isnt't it?), and that ended up in 868MB.

OR... are we talking about sets of geopackages?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Well, SQLite does some packing of integer or floating-point values, but 
nothing on strings or blobs (which means no compression o the WKB 
extended geometries of GeoPackage). You can get easily a 3x compression 
ratio when zipping GeoPackage vector files (of course depends a lot on 
what you put in them)

I have successfully tested a ~30 GB uncompressed GeoPackage vector file 
compressed as ~10 GB as SOZip.

MBTiles holds PNG or JPEG tiles which are already compressed, so no 
surprise that the Deflate compression of ZIP doesn't help.

The SOZip spec is all about laaarge-files-in-zip. Considerations of 
many-files-in-zip are not covered by it (they are orthogonal)

For *raster* GPKGs/MBTiles it won't do much. JPG and PNG tiles are 
already compressed and DEFLATE on top won't do anything interesting 
unless there is lots of identical tiles inside
For *vector* data it should offer considerable savings in most cases.

E. g.:

114M Address_25832_all.gpkg
16M Address_25832_all.gpkg.zip? # standard zip, not sozip

Or see https://github.com/sozip/sozip-examples for actual sozip examples.

Very cool project, Even! (Why not "Cloud-Optimized" though? ;) )

Message-ID: <8e011942-dd47-45a0-6504-81b32aab750c@gmail.com>

Hi all,

maybe that's a silly question, but with all the self compiled QGIS 
versions that I have (3.22, 3.28, master, ecc) QGIS is not 
autocompleting the code, not in the console, editor, Processing script, 
macros, etc etc.

With the QGIS 3.22, but again the version seems not be the problem, 
installed from packages, the autocompletion works as expected.

Is there a parameter in the cmake that I have to adjust or is this 
behavior expected?

p.s. working on a Debian Sid OS

Cheers and thanks!

Matteo

The term is heavily loaded and quite vague. SOZip doesn't make something 
cloud unfriendly magically cloud friendly. If you need to seek at 100 
different locations in a (uncompressed) file, you'll need to also seek 
at 100 locations in its SOZip compressed version (which is 
excruciatingly slow for a regular non-optimized ZIP). SOZip will shine 
most for local use cases, where this seeking in the underlying 
compressed stream is a cheap operation. For remote use, your mileage may 
vary.

I had a user that may have hit the "Upgrade All" button in the plugins window. Does that automatically upgrade all installed plugins to the newest version? If so is there a way to revert back to the previous versions. He may have just hit the Upgrade Plugin button for the specific plugin.  Not sure and I did not want to test it and mess up my configuration.

We have created our own QGIS plugin that relies on the VisibilityAnalysis plugin and upgrading VisibilityAnalysis from 1.7 to 1.8 breaks our tool as I created a my own Visibility Analysis UI to run the VisibilityAnalysis tool.  I basically want to prevent a user from upgrading any plugin that we access so that this does not happen.  Is there a way to disable "Upgrade All" and "Upgrade Plugin" buttons in the plugin window through settings, interface customization, or programmatically through python on QGIS using startup.py?

Thanks,
Luke

Hi Luke,

You can install the previous version of the plugin by installing it from
its zip file manually.

   1. Go to the plugin page, (e.g.
   https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ViewshedAnalysis/)
   2. Click the *version* tab
   3. Click the version you want to install (e.g.
   https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ViewshedAnalysis/version/1.7/)
   4. Download the plugin (a zip file)
   5. Open Plugin Manager
   6. Uninstall the plugin
   7. Install from Zip

One possible way to disable the Upgrade All or Upgrade Plugin is to disable
all the plugin repositories (i.e. Plugins -> Settings -> disable all
repositories).

Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <CADQ4pmCmzikaBK=YkmxrUxKKQ+WM70gZUKoj7Jw4Xm=pQv=1HQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,
I was experiencing issues installing a QGIS Python plugin on MacOS 12.6
and, after some investigation, I found out that the problem seems to happen
only with the current QGIS-LTR (3.22) and not with the latest release
(3.28.2-Firenze).
The problem occurs for instance when attempting to do something like the
following from the QGIS Python console:
from matplotlib import pyplot

I'd suggest in this situation that you should instead be either
working with the VisibilityAnalysis maintainers to get the latest
version compatible with your needs, or alternatively fork parts of the
1.7 code into your plugin so that you aren't dependent on another
maintainer's work.

Trying to workaround this by blocking plugin updates is going to be a
fragile path, likely taking much longer than either of the above
suggestions.

Thanks. I did think of that but am trying to avoid hundred if not thousands of users having to deal with a manual solution.  I think I have another work around I am testing.

Hi Luke,

You can install the previous version of the plugin by installing it from its zip file manually.

  1.  Go to the plugin page, (e.g. Blockedhttps://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ViewshedAnalysis/Blocked)
  2.  Click the version tab
  3.  Click the version you want to install (e.g. Blockedhttps://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ViewshedAnalysis/version/1.7/Blocked)
  4.  Download the plugin (a zip file)
  5.  Open Plugin Manager
  6.  Uninstall the plugin
  7.  Install from Zip
One possible way to disable the Upgrade All or Upgrade Plugin is to disable all the plugin repositories (i.e. Plugins -> Settings -> disable all repositories).

Hope this helps.

It would probably be more the other way around for my case. I will have to modify the calls from my front end UI for my tool to work properly with their plugin and that is how I kind of expect it as I am making calls to their code.  We plan to have quarterly releases cycles of our code with new features/bug fixes unless there is some major issue found in the 3rd party plugin that requires a hotfix.



I was hoping to avoid forking and have to maintain 3rd party plugin.  We may be looking to transition to a version of Visibility Analysis in GRASS that is a core plugin that was developed inhouse almost 40 years ago, but in the mean time I tried another method as a test. I copied the VisibilityAnalysis plugin to another directory, VA_Test, so I can mess with privileges on a copy of the plugin directory.



Looks like if I deny write privileges to the VA_Test the Upgrade Plugin button just displays as Reinstall Plugin since it does not allow an upgrade and it is actually greyed out so that is good. The user can still run the Upgrade All plugin and that will upgrade all other plugins.  When I ran that it upgraded the original  VisibilityAnalysis plugin directory and all other plugins that had upgrades available.  So this seems like this will be a quick fix.  I will just need to make those permission restrictions in the my installer MSI file and test it out.  This in general could be a good solution to prevent user?s from upgrading plugins that we provide with our install, so that users don?t just continue to upgrade before we test to make sure they work so we can avoid unnecessary tech support called.

I'd suggest in this situation that you should instead be either working with the VisibilityAnalysis maintainers to get the latest version compatible with your needs, or alternatively fork parts of the

1.7 code into your plugin so that you aren't dependent on another maintainer's work.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Report for the QEP Settings Registry follow-up
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+aZxS86iD1RR82qWQJ0P9hU-wU7T6YskS3C+W9_pRq9fw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS fellows,

This is a small report for the QEP #245
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/245

After some hard thinking, I have finally found a nice way to register
settings in a hierarchical and organized way, without too much complexity
in the API to actually use the settings.

I have recently submitted a PR https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/51295 with
the proposed approach.
To have a clean approach, some keys have been renamed. There is a
compatibility handling (both forward and backward).

The PR is actually a part of the original QEP (mostly the GUI part is
missing).
The trade of scope reduction towards a cleaner approach for the settings is
valuable to me.
The structured approach will mainly allow for an even cleaner
representation of settings in the advanced editor and a more comprehensive
knowledge of named groups of settings (such as WFS connections, GPS
devices, ?).
I commit to start implementing the GUI part during the HF in NL this spring.
The migration of the remaining settings will be done continuously from now
on.

I am glad to have finally found a good approach here. Please let me know if
you have any feedback.

Kind regards,

Denis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] language dependency qgis_process
Message-ID: <2258300.M2sZZ9dyre@debian11>

Hi,
I am using qgis_process stand alone (Linux desktop or Linux headless server) 
and run e.g. an overlap analysis, This algorithm adds a field 'Buffered_pc'.

When I use the processing inside the QGIS desktop, the overlap algorithm names 
the added field 'Gepuffert_pc', because I am using the German locale. 

But I need for the further processing the German version of the field name.

Apparently qgis_process creates a file in ~/.config/Unknown Organization/
qgis_process.bin.conf with the content 'localized_data_paths=@Invalid()'. It 
seems to be that qgis_process expects somewhere the path for the German 
localization.

How do I tell qgis_process to use the German locale?

Thank you for any hints.

Michael

Hi developers.



Previously I generate a custom build and now I'm trying to generate an installer using the file creatensis.pl, but the script fail, viewing the file content I see that url http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w on the line 35.?my $root = "http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w" does not exist;





How can I download the dependencies to generate my custom installer?.



Thanks for your answers.

Mmm,

but   mTabDescriptions.insert( QStringLiteral( "all_plugins" ), tr( "<h3>All Plugins</h3>\

means it uses the tr-function, meaning it is being translated, so it should show up in the QGIS tr file...

So, yes, it is in: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/i18n/qgis_de.ts

Looking at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commits/master/i18n/qgis_de.ts the actual translation is in transifex.

So: grab an transifex account, join the German translation group (ask Juergen?), and translate

https://www.transifex.com/qgis/QGIS/viewstrings/#de/qgis-application/180485114?q=text%3A'On+the+left+you+see+the+list+of+all+plugins'

If you provide me a proper text I'm also happy to add it
(but better if we spread such knowledge/skills)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Michael,

I'm not 100% sure, but I would think that such fields should never be translated?
Not in Desktop nor in scripts?

What do other think?

Or has processing some language aware dict with all languages in it?

Hi Richard,

I have already an account to do it - but my question was more into the 
direction, if this text is local available - so it is not. The 
background is, one of our customers has banned the official plugin repo 
from QGIS - this can be done manipulating the installer_data.py. Now 
they also want to change the text one the right side...

thanks anyway for your answer

Stefan

Hi Michael,

I agree with Richard that algorithm outputs should not be different when 
using other locales.

However, there's a Rename Field algorithm (native:renametablefield) that 
might be useful for you.

Kind regards,
Raymond

The current build recipes are on https://github.com/jef-n/OSGeo4W
(src/qgis{,-ltr,-ltr-dev,-rel-dev,-dev})

And it's now using MSI (see scripts/msis.sh)

Hi Richard & Raymond,
thank you for looking into this issue.

E.g. the algorithm (native:calculatevectoroverlaps) creates a new field in the 
output layer, which gives the percentage of the overlap ('Buffered_pc'). In the 
moment, calling this function in a model inside the QGIS client, the field is 
named 'Gepuffert_pc' (German translation). When I call the model standalone 
with qgis_process, the field is named 'Buffered_pc'. There are other algorithms 
which create fields in the output layer. 

But: qgis_process creates a file ~/.config/qgis_process.bin.conf with the 
content ''localized_data_paths=@Invalid()'. This is an indication for me that 
qgis_process expects somewhere a path for translations. 

Because qgis_process and QGIS client (3.28.3) run on the same installation/
environment (Linux/Debian), everything should be in place. There is also no 
language parameter f?r qgis_process like '--lang=de-DE'. 

==> I assume that I have to set an environment variable for qgis_process - any 
hints are welcome!

@Richard: I remember a long discussion, if Excel-functions should be 
translated - a college in England could not use my German Excel. Microsoft 
solved this over the years with switches, and finally came up with the function 
translator:  <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-functions-translator-f262d0c0-991c-485b-89b6-32cc8d326889>. For me, switches would be  
sufficient.

@Raymond: Renaming or other workarounds require to check the existence of a 
field. I have not found a clickable function for this, only some pyqgis 
scripts: <https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/299263/qgis-3-0-2-check-if-a-field-exists-in-a-layer-in-python>

Thank you for your help.
Michael

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Apply style to all selected layers and groups
Message-ID: <CABPxTTpScw7sX2VuaHWv9GsG_jBP10W-LxA3wtsHPLgn2Y_srw@mail.gmail.com>

I keep having users come to me and ask why QGIS does not allow the ability
to apply a style to all selected layers and groups of layers. As far as I
know this does not exist. I added a routine to do this in the Density
Analysis plugin, but this capability really should be a part of the core
Layer Styling - perhaps with a checkbox that says to apply to all selected
layers. This would need to understand that it is only applied to layers
that match the layer type or either the first or last selected layer.

Are there any development efforts to apply styles to all selected layers?

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi Calvin,

If I load a layer, duplicate it twice more.
Restyle the first layer,
Copy Style (of that first one)
Then select both other layers in the layer list (select click)
Then Paste Style
Then both other layers get that style?

That is not what you mean?
Or do you want to have some ui for that?

One this I personally miss, is the copy pasting (mostly of colors or categories) from one kind of geometry type to another...
I know do that (if I have pretty complex styles), by hand by editing the qml files...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Richard,

We tend to operate on older versions of software so I see that the latest
has this, but what 3.28 does not do is when you are using the Layer Styling
panel, it only works with one layer. Once that layer is set then you can
copy and paste it to the rest, but it would be really nice if you didn't
need the additional copy and paste step.

Thanks,

Calvin

Ah, sorry now I understand.

Yes that would be cool, so instead of the dropdown in the Layer Styling panel, you would have an option to select more layers...  and apply to all of those the changed you do in the layer styling panel.

One thing I'm thinking of, is what to show as 'current' styling after selecting 5 (different styled) layers...

Something like: the one in the dropdown is the 'master'? So as soon as you add other layers to the selection they get styled (after confirmation?) to the same style as the Styling panel is showing for the 'master'?

Anyway: nice idea! Needs some UI thinking though, to not make things overly complex for 'normal' use :-)

Richard

The other aspect of this that I didn't mention is that my users create
their own styles which they save ("Save Symbol") under their own tags. This
is all available under the "Layer Styling" panel. When they click on one of
their styles they would like it applied to all selected layers, but because
this is under "Layer Styling" it is only applied to one layer.

Calvin,
If I have a lot of files that I want to coordinate the style of I put them
in a group. Then I change one layer and do the copy style trick and then
paste it on to the group. This will apply that style to all the layers in
the group that are compatible.

As far as coordinating styles between layers rather than being able to
select multiple layers I would like to see the option to be able to link
the symbology to a style in the style manager. That way if you change the
style in the style manager  there it changes it for all layers that have
that style set.

I like your idea about changing the style in the style manger and having it
apply to all the styles that are linked to it. That could be very useful.

The last tool in my plugin https://github.com/djes/MultipleLayersTools does
this.

Please note that in DB, style is linked to only one layer that could be
used in misc layers in QGIS.

Another trick is to change the default keyboard shortcut. Personally, I'm
using 'B' to copy style. 'N' to paste. It's very handy when you're using
virtual layers and so on.

Hi Stefan,

Ah, ok clear.

One idea I had later, is: the shown text in the gui is actually the text that comes from the ts (Qt translation) files (which are 'compiled' to binary qm(?) files by (eg) Qt Linguist.
So (even the english texts in the gui) are determined by the <locale).qm file in the QGIS installation.
So if you manage to update/change the en_US.qm or de.qm in the i18n installation dir, then the gui will show THOSE strings.
Best would be probably do that during or just after installation, but maybe your python script is able to do that?
Last resort is to update the/an installer (with your custom qm files) I think?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QEP for the removal of GeoNode provider
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=wmgn9dtXq+qCUwmaSd7P+dmFvswOxOpeE_KTuDiFUgQQ@mail.gmail.com>

HI all,

I've just submitted a proposal for the removal of the GeoNode provider
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/262>.

As some of you may know, a QGIS Plugin for GeoNode
<https://github.com/GeoNode/QGISGeoNodePlugin> is available. It's been
developed by Kartoza with the collaboration of GeoSolutions, and now it's
maintained under the GeoNode community organization.

The plugin enhances and extends the capabilities offered by the core
provider. Most importantly, and contrary to the core provider, it also
supports the current versions of GeoNode 4.
The GeoNode community and GeoSolutions will maintain it and keep it updated
with GeoNode.

Given the lack of new contributions to the core provider, and the
difficulty in maintaining it, a proposal for the removal of the GeoNode
provider <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/262> has
been submitted, after consulting together with Tim Sutton (Kartoza).

We would like to implement this change to the next release, 3.30, and would
like to ask for a feature freeze exception if the work is not completed by
the date of the feature freeze.

Looking forward to receiving your feedback.
Best,
Giovanni

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS info on MeshLayer
Message-ID: <eec7c9449e5c20fe3d49ddda2d27f15d@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

I'm trying to get values from an x,y from a mesh layer via PyQGIS.

But I fail to SEE the results. Debugging in QtCreator, I see that there 
are results, but apparently they are dropped somewhere?

The code I'm using:

results = []   # iterator 'reference'?
context = QgsIdentifyContext()
context.setTemporalRange(QgsDateTimeRange(begin=QDateTime(2022,11,7,7,0,0),end=QDateTime(2022,11,7,8,0,0)))
# make sure the mesh layer is active layer
# note that the coordinates used are MapCanvas coordinates (???)
# returns QgsMapToolIdentify False in case of NO layer
print(QgsMapToolIdentify(iface.mapCanvas()).identifyMeshLayer(results, 
iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer(), QgsPointXY(470208.66, 6766348.44), 
context ))
print(results)

This always returns [] (empty list), while debugging c++ in QtCreator I 
see there are results.

Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks for any Pointers.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all,

if I'm not wrong (Tim?) there was kind of dashboard to see the download 
statistics of QGIS, but I cannot find it anymore.

Is there a link available?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Speedup of PostGIS Topology layers loading
Message-ID: <20230124221212.fibxd5fgfptyfyvd@c19>

Hi all, I'd like to bring to your attention a pull request
I created that allows making effective use of spatial indexes
when showing PostGIS Topology layers in a QGIS map:

  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/50906

There's no way to make use of such indexes without changing
the SQL query used to retrieve the data because PostGIS Topology
based spatial objects (TopoGeometry) are just referces to other
tables and dereferencing those connections done on a row-by-row
basis would always be slower than building a proper query informed
of the data organization.

As I know there aren't many QGIS committers using PostGIS Topology
consider this as an invitation to take a look at it :)

"Quick" way to build a TopoGeometry layer in PostGIS:

  CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology CASCADE;

  CREATE TABLE x(id serial primary key);

  SELECT topology.CreateTopology('test', '4326');
  SELECT AddTopoGeometryColumn('test','public','x','tg','POLYGON');

  INSERT INTO x(tg)
    SELECT toTopoGeom(
      ST_SetSRID(
        ST_Buffer(ST_MakePoint(x,y), 2),
        4326
      ),
      'test',
      1
    )
    FROM
      generate_series(-170, 170, 3) x,
      generate_series(-90, 90, 3) y;

Then use the QGIS browser to load the table public.x
and compare the performance with and w/out the patch,
if you want.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Who manages the PR queue?
Message-ID: <398b5614-5ba3-1b69-38e4-fb99f5e2a963@libero.it>

Hi devs,
in the Developer guide [1] is stated that:
***
If you feel the PR is not receiving the attention it deserves your 
options to accelerate it should be (in order of priority):
Help review others pull requests to free the person assigned to yours.
Send a message to the mailing list ?marketing? your PR and how wonderful 
it will be to have it included in the code base.
Send a message to the person your PR has been assigned to in the PR queue.
Send a message to Marco Hugentobler (who manages the PR queue).
Send a message to the project steering committee asking them to help see 
your PR incorporated into the code base.
***

Is the line "Send a message to Marco Hugentobler (who manages the PR 
queue)." still valid? Should it be removed or updated?

Bay the way, there are currently about 40 PR in the queue and some PR 
are going stale multiple times without being merged. Just for example: 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/50749 or 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/50590 or 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/50489.
Some other non merged PR are backports to release-3_22 branch and the 
last release of 3.22 is planned for today: 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/51573 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/51539 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/51386

Best regards.

The mingw64 builds have been constantly failing for a couple of days.

I have a PR open to disable them https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/51611

If there are no objections, I will merge this.

Message-ID: <0794f2ff-1347-d908-b1d8-202ec49cf8a8@duif.net>

Hi,

Compiling master on Debian Testing today, I first was presented with a new dependency Qt5Multimedia (hopefully we can soon use QGIS as a Spotify client ;-) ), which was installable.

But then my (fresh) build stalls at:

[9773/9812] Generating ui_DlgAddGeometryColumn.py
FAILED: python/plugins/db_manager/ui_DlgAddGeometryColumn.py /home/richard/git/qgis/build/python/plugins/db_manager/ui_DlgAddGeometryColumn.py

An unexpected error occurred.
Check that you are using the latest version of PyQt5 and send an error report to
support at riverbankcomputing.com, including the following information:

   * your version of PyQt (5.15.7)
   * the UI file that caused this error
   * the debug output of pyuic5 (use the -d flag when calling pyuic5)

Others have that issue?

Running pyuic -d on one of the errors seems fine (see below).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to set defaults to
 QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers
Message-ID: <CABPxTTpV2HRoBmD_nj7yMt+WrG0UhHrtxHTgM86ew9ossnZbpg@mail.gmail.com>

I just received a request to update the Density Analysis plugin
density hash algorithms so they work with multiple layers and produce one
density map based off of multiple input layers. In the algorithm I have
replaced QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource
with QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers.

Is there a way to automatically populate as default value of selected
layers in QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers with the selected layers or
selected groups of layers in the "Layer Panel"?  This would be incredibly
useful.

I am doing this as a QgsProcessingAlgorithm. The layerType to
QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers is QgsProcessing.TypeVectorPoint.

Thanks for your help.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issue reading world_map.gpkg
Message-ID: <7d952d7fa17de.c9657833014dd@odyhpc.com>

Hello,
I'm trying to automate changes in the projection used by the map canvas. If 
I open the python console and use the following command sequence:
novus_CRS = '+proj=lcc +lat_1=63.0 +lat_2=75.0 +lat_0=70.0 +lon_0=-97.0 
+datum=WGS84 +no_defs'
crs = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.fromProj4(novus_CRS)
qgsProject = QgsProject.instance() 
qgsProject.setCrs(crs) 
This works fine. However, and when I try to incorporate it programmatically 
(e.g. in a plugin), I keep getting the error:
Failed to open /usr/local/share/qgis/resources/data/world_map.gpkg
However, this file seems to be in the right subdirectory:
$ cd /usr/local/share/qgis/resources/data

Not sure why of this behavior discrepancy console vs. programmatically. 
Thanks.

It was broken -- but has been fixed by J?rgen and is all working now.

What we need now is someone with some insight into how the 3rd party
.api files in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/qsci_apis
were generated and how we can update these to recent library
versions...

You'd (unfortunately -- it's not a trivial change) need to do this via
a custom Processing widget wrapper, so that your parameter gets its
own widget class where you can implement this logic.

 -- solution
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjktTD5UayDKgFhaCcUa1AvYjRifnVUP84NbRMpn9seZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey list,

Just in case anyone else is running into this Qt Creator bug : on
systems with Python 3.11 current Qt Creator versions have broken
debugging helpers, which means you can't see the contents of
QString/QList/... (making QGIS debug much more painful then it should
be!)

The bug is described here:
https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-28659  , with a patch
included in this comment
https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-28659?focusedCommentId=702724&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-702724
which you can apply directly to your Qt Creator install to fix the
issue for now.

A PR to remove such line from the Developers docs has been opened at 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8002.

> Some other non merged PR are backports to release-3_22 branch and the

Those backported bug fixes missed the chance to be integrated in the 
last point release of QGIS 3.22.

Best regards.

Hi,

just to avoid other people losing a couple hours like me... If you 
update to latest master on Debian/Ubuntu, and after rebuild, you get a 
cryptic error like the following when importing qgis_gui:

# PYTHONPATH=output/python QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=output python3 -c "from 
qgis._gui import *"
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ? File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
RuntimeError: qgis._gui cannot import type '????' from PyQt5.QtCore

Then the fix is to install python3-pyqt5.qtmultimedia. Cf 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/324dac16696bff43d637920733eb5ee4cb7b3ddf

Thanks to Alessandro for hinting me on the right direction. I'd wish 
PyQt would output a better error message...

Nyall, Is there an example somewhere on how to do a custom processing
widget wrapper?

Thanks!

Ok, so the crux was:

sudo apt install libqt5multimedia5 python3-pyqt5.qtmultimedia

I did install the first one, but the other not (yet)

Thanks Even R !
