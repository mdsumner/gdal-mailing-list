This plugin looks promising, allowing transparent tiles to lay over 
normal tiles and easy adding of new tile sources.

Unfortunately,it does not work with the qgis dev version. It claims to 
require EPSG:3857 (which my project has), but maybe gets disturbed by 
the new datumshift selection of QGIS 2.1.0.

Greetings,
Andr? Joost

Subject: [Qgis-developer] fixes for python-sip 4.15
Message-ID: <8669314.4DRnE2jhjM@xrated>

Hi,

being a newbie in gis affairs and therefore in QGIS, I would like to say 
warmth hello. 

Not being a newbie for python nor python-{sip,qt*} affairs, I noticed some 
issues of QGIS with sip 4.15 onwards. It was a rather noticeable update, as 
many complex bindings broke. Thankfully, the fixes are easy enough: it boils 
down to declare some missing private methods in the respective sip files.

Please see attached patches. What do you think? 

I noticed, that these issues are tackled differently in the current git: 
they're moved to protected methods. This is rather suboptimal, since due to 
sips "protected is public" trick, the whole protection is void.

BTW, I build my stuff in the public: 

	https://build.opensuse.org/project/monitor/home:frispete:geo

and attempt to feed my fixes upstream (with this message) as well as to the 
more prominent openSUSE feeds (Application:Geo), but the submit request is 
still pending.

While at it, I noticed a long stream of error messages related to srs.db 
handling during build. A crude fix for that is also attached, but I have to 
admit, that I didn't fully grok the details of the database handling in this 
regard. I first concentrated on getting a clean build. Hence, I included the 
sample data as an additional package. 

Now, the hopefully soon to be available packages for openSUSE are in a much 
better shape than before. Somebody with a deeper builder and user experience 
taking a look is highly appreciated, especially related to the available 
extensions. Which one's are really open source, which is a prerequisite for 
being build on the OBS?

Cheers,
Pete

Tim,

The controversy is over 10.04 (Qt 4.6) not 12.04 (Qt 4.8)
To me it seems good enough to bump to 4.6 now without breaking anything
and to consider 4.8 as minimum for QGIS 2.2

That seems reasonable given what out there and providing packagers time
to catch up. Presumably there are known fixes and features that devs
intend to take advantage of for 2.2 that warrant this shift (previous
notes on this thread indicate this to be true).

Move to Qt5 seems like a whole different discussion depending on level
or work needed.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Bernd, you are right,?It would be better that this action would be undoable, and add a layer ... but for the moment there is no such implementation.?

Accepting the rule that any action not undaoble must be confirmed by the user, then it seems that deleting a layer should also request a confirmation, right?

Regards

Hi, in QGIS for windows you can select more than one layer (to remove) with the Ctrl key pressed in TOC, this is not possible on other platforms?

Hi, I have tried to bring together all the comments and I have updated the pull request (https://github.com/ahuarte47/QGIS/compare/Issue_9094):

	* Selection tools (With point, rectangle, circle...) delete selected features with 'backspace' or 'delete' key without confirmation (It is an undoable action).?
Also, a new status message notify the number of features deleted.
	* DEL key in attribute table delete the seleted features similarly.
	* Node tool, or capture tool, remove a node with 'backspace' or 'delete' key.
	* TOC remove selected layer[s] with Ctrl+D with ask for confirmation (It is not an undoable action).
Also, a new status message notify the number of layers removed.

Thank you very much for your advices!
Regards

Hi Hans,
thanks for this. If you reissue these as GithHub Pull Requests, their
acceptance will be far easier.

Hi Radim,
I checked in the master version and the vector customization works 
properly (thank you!!), but it seems that the problem with the raster 
menu (and so gdal) is still there.


Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] No Zoom to selected point
Message-ID: <529C6BB5.4010801@jena.de>

Dear devs,

today I stumbled on a strange behaviour when zoooming to a point.
To reproduce: load a point layer, select one feature in the table and 
click "Zoom to selection". The result is the same as if clicking "Pan 
map to Selection", i.e the map is panned but not zoomed.
I _think_ this is because the bounding box of the selected feature has a 
width and height of 0. Try 
iface.activeLayer().boundingBoxOfSelected().width()/.height() in the 
Python console.
Geometrically speaking this is correct but as the zoom to selected 
function builds on a bounding box with width/height > 0 the outcome for 
the user is bad.
My suggestion would be to define a small rectangle around the bounding 
boxes' center if it has size 0 in the zoomToSelected function.

Tried with QGIS 2.0.1 and current master

Shall I file a ticket for this?

I can use the ctrl-key on debian to select layers in TOC, and 'ctrl-D'
then removes all selected layers from TOC.

looks like it is the same on windows?

Yes, I wondered why a user said he had to remove layers from TOC one by one.

Then remove layer[s] from TOC asking for confirmation seems appropriate becuase of it is not an undoable action, right?

Thank you very much Richard.

Thank you Matthias for your help. I had correctly declared the location of
the bison executable yet there is something strange on my machine that is
causing it to not recognized the path variable.
 
I specified it before compiling by inserting the path to the bison
executable in the VC directories (tools - options ) in the solution.

I think I have a problem that may be an issue of an older version of windows

I learned that it is available only after Windows Vista. Is there a
workaround? I am compiling 2.0.1.

Hello all,

... as in object, I need to set the transparency of all the vector layers
in my plugin ( "rasparenza" ).

What is the syntax to set the transparency of a vector layer (in pyQis 1.8
and 2.0 versions ) ?

I am searching in documentation and in  "gis.stackexchange",  but I only
found... myself.


Thank you in advance for any info

How about this?

layer = iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
layer.setLayerTransparency(50)  # int between 0 and 100
iface.mapCanvas().refresh()

I don't have a 1.8 version handy, but I think layer.setTransparency() would
work with the old API.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] atlas composer: print a specific feature - call
	for a developper
Message-ID: <529DE824.8030509@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I work for a water supply service and we have a patchwork of maps all 
over the network.
It is a common task to print -- after a modification -- a single 
specific map, not the whole set.
This is why, the atlas generation is not really convenient: first, you 
must find the id of the feature, create a filter in the atlas, update 
the overview map if you have one, export to pdf, and finally print!

I would like to be able to print a feature directly.
1. Identify the feature to be printed  (could be an attribute action in 
the layer)
2. the composer is shown with the corresponding extent.
3. but most important,  the feature would be given to the composer, so 
it could be used in expressions (as it is used for atlas)

I wonder if this is easily achievable. I see this as an extension of the 
atlas, as the layer as to be defined in the composer.

So, please tell me:
- if there's a workaround
- if the idea is not that good or if you have something else in mind
- if you're interested in developing such feature - this is funded

Cheers,

Denis

I am not sure to totally understand your third point.
I understand the need as being able to trigger atlas generation for a
particular feature, by direct selection on the layer (via an action as
you suggest or something similar), the composer would then prepare
everything for this particular feature.
Is it correct ?

There is no workaround I am aware of.
We can surely propose you to develop this feature. You can contact us by
pm (me and / or Vincent Picavet) for more details.

Hi Gino,

can you confirm what I described (_one_ point selected, does not zoom)?

I tried with f21562c on OpenSuse 64 bit.

Hi Bernhard

If one point is selected, it is somehow undefined how far to zoom in. 
Earlier behaviour was to just zoom in by a factor of two. This however 
is very unconvenient if you repeatedly select entries in the attribute 
table and click 'zoom to selected'.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

of course it is undefined, but IMHO something should happen if you click 
"zoom to selected". If I have a cloud of points and nothing happens I 
have no means to see the particular point I selected and that is worse 
than "unconvenient".
How does other GIS software handle this problem?

Of course you have. You know the point is in the middle of the screen, 
so you can manually zoom to it. It is just not convenient :-)

Oh, you are right! But then, wouldn't it be sensible to have the program 
do that for me? Maybe zoom to a certain scale that is related to say the 
size of the bounding box of the layer? So the scale would be different 
for a layer containing global disaster points compared to one containing 
local addresses.

Zoom to a scale related to the layer bbox sounds much better than 
zooming in a fixed factor.

Sorry Bernhard was my mistake... I had a layer but it was composed of
circular polygons similar to point.

sorry for the noise

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Legend for proportionnal symbols and expression
	based symbols
Message-ID: <1386155285191-5092635.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi All, 
we have a long lasting problem with proportionnal legends in QGIS. It gets
more problematic with V2, as those maps are so beautiful and popular. 

I'm starting some brainstorming to clarify fonctionnal specifications what
we actually want to have legends in layers registry and composer working. 

Here are some exemples of what I would love to see in legends:
 - [0] proportionnal circles or square with 1 to 5 classes
 - [1] proportionnal symbols AND colors 

Now that we have expressions everywhere, we probably will have to handle
legends differently than in other GIS, where legend is generated once, when
user tune symbology. Let me explain:

- user can now define expressions for size, color, rotation, border width...
for any sub-marker (1 to n) of a symbol. 
- Moreover, we can use conditionnal expressions, and scale dependent
conditions ($scale variable). 
- QGIS is also a server, we need to be able to generate legends working on
really displayed datas.

Conclusion, It now is impossible to correctly pre-generate the legend by
analysing symbology properties. 

Does this sound possible to developpers to explore some other way? We could
read real dataset to collect informations to build a legend, and eventually
do some statistical classification to get discrete classes from continuous
data? 

We could do that on live or on-demand update maybe. 

My idea was to collect rendered object in current canvas and current scale.
BUT.. we can face discrete data - some kind of SELECT DISTINCT can do the
trick - , OR continuous data - we need then to do some statistical
classification to reduce the legend to 1 - 10 classes to get it readable. 
We also need some intelligence in those statistical classifications:
 - round values to keep it readable
 - display separate classes only if size or color distance is long enough so
that human eye sees some difference on screen. ie: do not display for
classes if symbol size varies from 0.5 to 0.7... 
 - add some options in GUI to choose number of classes, type of legend
rendering.. 
 - keep the classification process fast (subset of data with random
sampling?) 
 - test all use cases, I'm mostly thinking of points symbols, but lines and
polygons must not be forgotten.

I'm sure plenty of scientists have already been theorizing all this. Any
opinions? Could this be an idea for GSoC or other kind of training course?  

I'll be pleased to get feedback from the community. 

Cheers
R?gis

Hi r?gis,

Martin Dobias will make a proposal soon for a legend refactoring.
You should see with him how to let those things happen in the future in 
the new legend.

Cheers,

Denis

I haven't had a chance to properly plan this out, but something which
has been playing in the back of my mind is the idea of "table
legends". Take a look at the legend in this map:
http://www.cartogrammar.com/images/vba/cervical_cancer.jpg
I'm thinking the user could specify the variable which is changed
along each axis, along with the min/max value for that axis and number
of rows/columns for the table. Then the classes would be generated
automatically (maybe equal ranges? equal count? user specified?) and
the symbol automatically generated for each cell in the table.

The size and spacing of each cell could be user controlled, so that
this type of legend would also work for symbol layers.

As I said, I haven't really sat down to work out exactly how this
would work yet... it's just a rough idea which I've been toying with!

Hi all,

I don't know who the own is of the QGIS web client repo:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Web-Client

I am trying to add Bernhard Str?bl as a collaborator, but I can't.

Where can I see who is the owner of the repo? Is it Tim or Pirmin? Or
someone else?

Thank you for your help. I can commit stuff to this repo, but I can't
change settings or add collaborators.

Thanks,
Andreas

Probably I'm not using it correctly.
I want to retrieve the features within a bbox and obtain one field only.
Im' doing the following:

request
= QgsFeatureRequest(bbox).setSubestOfAttributes(['id'],mylayer.pendingFields())
for feat in mylayer.geFeatures(request):
   for fields in feat.fields():
       print field.name()

and I get all the field names printed while I thought I would get only 'id'.
What am I doing wrong?

It seems that joining filters do not work (at leat in Python). I have to do:

request = QgsFeatureRequest(bbox)
request = request.setSubestOfAttributes(['id'],mylayer.pendingFields())

And I see that field names are always returned but field values are set to
None if filtered out.

>From some posts I have read it looks like the both the 64 bit Windows
standalone and Osgeo4W installers are busted and one should install the
32 bit version instead. Is this correct? I used the 64 bit standalone
installer back in early October and am missing some GDAL libraries and
certain GRASS tools do not work, giving me a GDAL library error. Have a
look at the thread here:
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-2-0-Win-standalone-busted-td507

fixed or should I install 32 bit version instead?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qt/ui different dialogs/windows/docks etc
Message-ID: <529F8D18.4030209@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

currently we have all kind of different dialogs popping up, from
plugins, processing, actions etc etc.
some have a close button in bottom, some have little close icons in the
titlebar, some have all on windows and none on linux etc. some are
dockable, others are not.

there are already some issues related to this:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9126
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9141
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8699

Different but also in the better usability category:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9083

maybe we should start some ui/usability-team, which creates tasks for
this kind of problems, propose/finds solutions (he, qt is huge) and
maybe also can create some guidelines about a good dialog/popup/plugin
should look like?

any volunteers? Or should we ask this on the userlist?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

You should now have admin permissions for the QGIS Web Client repo.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to get feat.geometry() from SpatiaLite in
	pyQGis ?
Message-ID: <CAFF9Zhvpb7N6BNW3fXzfsKPNAkG0qG04GsvaAr5vUkY=65vYBA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,


as in object, within pyQGis  I need to read the geometry of a SpatiaLite
vector layer.

This is my source code:

layer = iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
iter = layer.getFeatures()
for feat in iter:
    geom = feat.geometry()
    elem = geom.asPolyline()
    print("ELEM %s\n") %(elem)
    for p1 in elem:
        x1,y1 = p1.x(),p1.y()
        print("XY= %lf %lf\n") %(x1, y1)


But... it returns only:

ELEM []
ELEM []
ELEM []
ELEM []

etcetera, instead of something like this :

ELEM [(2.37786e+06,4.60302e+06), (2.37784e+06,4.60304e+06)]

... that I had with a "normal" qgis layer.

Sure, I miss something.

Somebody can help me to understand how to get geometry from SpatiaLite ?


Thank you in advance

Roberto

Hi, Roberto:

I think the query from layer.getFeatures() returns an iterator and that
means you use the nextFeature(feat) to get the next feature until it fails
to return a feature, then it means you have reached the end of the iterator
list.

iter = layer.getFeatures()
while iter.nextFeature(feat):
    geom = feat.geometry()
    elem = geom.asPolyline()
    print("ELEM %s\n") %(elem)    
    for p1 in elem:
        x1,y1 = p1.x(),p1.y()
        print("XY= %lf %lf\n") %(x1, y1) 


Should work for you,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] C++ Plugins failing due to upgrade (missing what
	procedue)?
Message-ID: <1386306843653-5093042.post@n6.nabble.com>

I am getting this error message with my C++ plugins and am wondering why? Can
anyone help solve this puzzle? Is there any documentation that tells what
has changed as far as plugins written in C++ for QGIS 2.0 to install them?
It seems to me that there may be a procedure that it is lookign for in the
plugin that used to install in the past. I see several other plugins also
fail due to the same error message. I see what Nathan was saying that C++
plugins are getting by the way side due to lack of maintenance. But I am
tryign to maintain and I need information to do it.

Below is the message I get for several plugins including my own,

Failed to load C:/Program Files/qgis2.1.0/plugins/sqlanywhereprovider.dll
(Reason: Cannot load library C:/Program
Files/qgis2.1.0/plugins/sqlanywhereprovider.dll: The specified procedure
could not be found.)

Thank you,

Maaza

Open the project file and look for the list of layers. I think the order is
based on how it is stored in the project file. Something must be happening
while saving the project.

I tried in python console on a Spatialite linestring layer:
	cLayer=iface.activeLayer()
	iter=cLayer.getFeatures()
	feat=iter.next()
	geom=feat.geometry()
	ln=geom.asPolyline()
	pnt=ln[0]
	print pnt.x(),pnt.y()
with the correct answer:
	1511590.31375 5099925.78455
(but I'm on a old 1.9.0-Master)

Hi Christos (!),


sorry but your code works only in QGis 1.8 version.
I am using the 2.0.1 version and pyQGis methods are changed:

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20


BTW, my problem is:

- using a SHP file layer,  elements are returned
- using SpatiaLite layer,  elements are returned, but each is empty.


It 'a known issue?
Someone in the list has tried it?

Hi everybody,

I have a WFS layer and I would like to obtain the server url using pyqgis.
Now I'm using layer.source(), but it return the entire url with all
the parameters.
Is there a way to abtain only the server url?
When QGIS create the string for the request it append every time
REQUEST parameter for first? Could I split the string using it?

Thanks

Hi

Good to hear that the plugin is of use.
I am not sure if I understood what you want to achieve.
In general it should be possible to remove the lower limit of the zoom-factor.
However, zooming out and then exporting the Garmin Custom Map / KMZ would give the same result.

Btw, the zoom-factor does not affect the possibility to zoom on your Garmin unit.

Or did you mean something else?

Cheers
Stefan

Great plugin! thanks!
Can the Zoom factor be less than 1.0 so that the map can be viewed on lesser scales also?

Fixing Feature #9094 (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9094) we have implemented several shortcut changes in QGIS desktop application in order to make more agile editing geometries:

QgisApp / MapCanvas:

+ By default, 'Delete' and 'Backspace' keys are used to delete the current selected features. Now, no message for?confirmation is showed (It is an undoable action), but a new status message shows the number of deleted features.?'Delete' key?does the same in attribute table dialog, as heretofore.

To avoid key conflicts, we have implemented that active MapTool?can override the default behavior of shortcut keys.


+ 'Ctrl+D' removes seleted layer[s] in legend. Now, it?ask for?confirmation because of it is not an undoable action.


Node tool:

+ 'Delete' and 'Backspace' keys delete the selected node[s]. This tool, as 'capture tool', ...?override the default behavior of these keys. Also, it is automatically selected the adjacent node to last removed?node.

+ '>' key activates the next node to current selected node.


+ '<' key activates the previous node to current selected node.


PR 1010 (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1010) contains these changes.

Thank your very much!

Hi Luca

usign QT you can:

create QUrl and then query "url" with it's method  queryItemValue

probably there's a pure python method... that it's always better reducing
QT coupling. If you find a pure python way... please post it.

thanks Giovanni this could be useful, it is not the best solution but
it could work.
I just discovered that WMS works in a better way

layer.source()
u'crs=EPSG:3857&dpiMode=all&featureCount=10&format=image/png&layers=landsat&styles=&url=http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv?map%3D/home/lucadelu/github/urlCapabilities/mapfile/landsat_urlcapabilities.map'

in this way it is really simple to understand the url and all the
other parameter (if I use urlparse the map will be in the params
instead it is in the main url)
Could we have the same for WFS? Should I open a ticket?

QGIS version: 2.0l.1

It happens randomly right after start and I can to isolate the reason.

Giovanni, thanks for confirmation.
Does it also happens immediately after start ?
Do You use packages from UbuntuGIS ?
Have You already submitted some bug report or should I do it ?

Thanks, I was worried that it is some problem with my QGIS implementation
at GIS.lab [1]. I will submit ticket with GDB traceback.
Anyone else can confirm ?

Hello all,

I asked the question on stackexchange but nobody could help me. I think 
it's a beginner-problem but I can't get it. Maybe somenone here could help 
me please?

I want to set the extent of my map for two cases. In one case i have the 
geometry as QGsGeometry* in my object of class "adress", in other case i 
use the coordinates also from my object as double-values. Setting the 
extent from geometry works fine, in the other case QGis crashes by 
refresh(). I think qgis wants to give my adress->x/y free. where is my 
error? I'll get the pointeritis! Here is my code:
QgsRectangle* extent;
    QgsPoint pt;
    double myX=(adress->X);
    double myY(adress->Y);
    if (adress->geom==0)
    {
        pt=QgsPoint(myX,myY);
        qDebug()<<"Geom is 
null"<<"X="<<QString::number(pt.x())<<"Y="<<QString::number(pt.y());
    }
    else
    {
        pt = adress->geom->asPoint();
        qDebug()<<"Geom is 
valid"<<"X="<<QString::number(pt.x())<<"Y="<<QString::number(pt.y());
    }
    extent= new QgsRectangle( pt.x() - 50.0,  pt.y() - 50.0, pt.x() + 
50.0,  pt.y() + 50.0);
    mQGisIface->mapCanvas()->setExtent(*extent);
    mQGisIface->mapCanvas()->refresh();

And this are the messages:
Geom is null X= "4.45099e+06" Y= "5.71994e+06" Eine Ausnahme (erste 
Chance) bei 0x5e453fe6 in qgis-bin.exe: 0xC0000005: Zugriffsverletzung

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Newbie question re building qgis
Message-ID: <20131210211636.2939923a@bigpond.net.au>

Hi,
I am running linux - Mageia 3 (intel x86-64) and want to run qgis 2+.
The mageia repo only has 1.x.
I have had problems running qgis as I installed 1.x and did a
compile /build as per the github install instructions.  I believe I
have now cleaned out the 1.x and only have the current source on my
system.

I am able to build / compile / install qgis without problem, and the
application starts, however I have problems loading the "open layers"
and gearthview plugins. I get:
***********************
An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):

[GCC 4.7.2]


QGIS version:
2.1.0-Master Master, c610f37

*********************************************************************

Can someone please advise.  I suspect I am using an old version of the
plugin and that either I have not rebuilt it, or I am loading it from
the wrong location.

Should I have reset the path for plugins to work with the development
system? (please point me to the bit of the manual I should have read if
this is the case!)

Do I need to do something other than "make" to build all the plugins?

Have I left something floating around from 1.x?

Any help gratefully appreciated!

Hugh

Hi

I have a couple of issues found using the offline editing, and I would
like to file a couple of tickets.
Where can I find its issue tracker and relative source code repository?
Or is it now part of QGIS core? (as it came together with QGIS installation)

thanks

Hi Paolo

offline editing is a default plugin, so tickets can go to

Hi,

not very sure of the questions, but for what I know it is not possible
to rotate the mapcanvas (== the map in QGIS).

but you in composer you can rotate a map-widget for eg printing a
rotated map.

I think you need to use a reference instead of a pointer as the argument.

Hi all

You can rotate map in QGIS composer, but I could not find a working options
in the label tabs to keep labels horizontal while rotating the map. So the
user has to turn the paper page after printing to read labels. What am I
doing wrong ?

As rotating the map directly in the map canvas, could you please tell us
why you need this option ? I can understand you need to rotate it in pdf to
let the shapes fit in the constrained size, but in QGIS map canvas (screen)
you are always able to zoom, pan, etc.

Hi, to achieve it I used HTTrack Web Copier and Calibre.

Here's my resultant epub:

Hope it's OK for you.

Re: [Qgis-developer] some trouble with pointers in my c++-plugin





Thank you for your reply,
i tried this but in the first case QGis crashes on refreshing. What do I 
wrong? It seems to be so easy...

                QgsPoint pt;
                double myX=440000.0;//(*adress->X);
                double myY=570000.0;//(*adress->Y);
                if (adress->geom==0)
                {
                        //pt=QgsPoint(myX,myY);
                        pt=QgsPoint(440000.0,570000.0);
                        qDebug()<<"Geom is null"<<"X="
<<QString::number(pt.x())<<"Y="<<QString::number(pt.y());
                }
                else
                {
                        pt = adress->geom->asPoint();
                        qDebug()<<"Geom is valid"<<"X="
<<QString::number(pt.x())<<"Y="<<QString::number(pt.y());
                }
                QgsRectangle extent( pt.x() - 50.0,  pt.y() - 50.0, pt.x() 
+ 50.0,  pt.y() + 50.0);
                mQGisIface->mapCanvas()->setExtent(extent);
                mQGisIface->mapCanvas()->refresh();

I think you need to use a reference instead of a pointer as the argument.

Dear all.

I'm currently working on a python plugin for QGIS which deploys points 
along lines on a given distance basis. The lines, say transects, are 
created placing an initial point and then providing a bearing for the 
line. Then, n stations/smapling points are deployed in its place.

I'm using Vincenty's Formula to get the coordinates for the points. So 
far, I've found an python implementation for this, but I haven't been 
able to know under which license is released the code, as far as I have 
found the code in a forum 
(https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/IsisSupport/index.php?topic=408.0) 
but the link provided in the message for the original code can't be 
followed.

As far as I know, in QGIS API there is no direct Vincenty's formula to 
compute in this way (point, azimuth/bearing + distance to destiny), and 
I want to make the plugin dependence-free as possible, so my questions are:

1) Do you know if, in QGIS API, is there and usable implementation of 
Vincenty's direct formula?
2) Is it fair to copy the code posted in the forum as is? (auto-answer: 
I don't think so....)
3) In this case, how should it be credited in my code?
4) Should be better to reimplement it in a class apart and release it 
under GPL3? is this possible?

By the way, the plugin name will be Transectizer... any better ideas?

Best regards,

Dear all (again)

Also I've trying to speed up diagram creation. I have a bunch of layers 
with the same fields (rigth now it's difficult to have a single layer 
and filter it) where I want to display diagrams.

I have to set each individual color in each layer. Maybe it would be 
nice to have a way of saving the diagram style, so it is loadable like 
layer style, but now i'm just thinking about have a set of colors easily 
accesible, like color picker *custom colors*

The problem is that AFAIK I can't remove colors from inside *custom 
colors* nor define a new "palette", so my current custom color palette 
is useless.

Is there a method to accomplish this? Where does QGIS store palettes  
(to try to remove/create manually)?

Thanks in advance

Hello,

I have a SVG-File in my Ressource-file and want to use it as Symbol for a 
VectorLayer. Is there an ability to load it in the QgsSvgCache and access 
it from there? 
I've tried it directly but this didn't worked in c++:

QString name=
"E:\\Entwicklung\\QGis\\Quantum-GiS\\src\\plugins\\adresssuche\\haus.svg";
                        //QString 
name="qrc:///adresssucheplugin/haus.svg";
                        qDebug()<<name;
                        QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayerV2* p_svgSymbolLayer(0);
                        p_svgSymbolLayer= new 
QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayerV2(name, DEFAULT_SVGMARKER_SIZE, 
DEFAULT_SVGMARKER_ANGLE);

Hi all

  Im running qgis 2.0.1 on windows 7 64 bit and want to write a little 
python plugin for qgis. However, when trying to run it, i get the 
following error message:

Traceback (most recent call last): File 
"C:\Users\Ausleihe\workspace\testGame\testGame\testGame.py"
, line 24, in <module> from qgis.core import *
  ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.

I've already tried several tipps provided in forums, like resetting 
python path etc. The location of qgis.core lies on the path, and I get a 
different error message when I remove it:

Traceback (most recent call last): File 
"C:\Users\Ausleihe\workspace\testGame\testGame\testGame.py"
, line 24, in <module> from qgis.core import *
ImportError: no such module

Inspecting qgis_core.dll with dependency walker 2.0 led to various 
missing dependencies, but I'm not quite sure how these work out. 
Importing moduls like PYQt4.QtCore etc works just fine.
  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards

You need to run your plugin inside QGIS, if you try and run it from the
outside it's not going to work.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS for Windows 64bit crashes when using
 addSttributes on any vector data provider
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=zsa=LyVzZ-UHp5-=A=eyQ+yjWQD8e916oHJkXEkNnq7g@mail.gmail.com>

During a course students with QGIS Doufur 64 bit (on Windows 7) reported
crashes when using QgsVectorDataProvider::dataProvider().addAttributes()
method. It happens whatever provider we use.

QGIS receives an OS signal and generates the following minidump:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13861666/qgis-20131212-123926-2704-6552-d94c044.dmp

The same code works fine on QGIS 32bit.

OS: Windows 7
QGIS 2.0.1 (both from OSGeo4W and Standalone)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Multi-threaded Rendering
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFduypNWFNqnt2fBDw-uaZKHgBQCduK6=rdoPyH6yFdm-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone!

[attention: long text ahead]

In recent weeks I have been working on moving map rendering into
background worker threads and all related infrastructure changes.
There is still quite a lot of work to do, but finally I think it is a
time for a preview and a broader discussion about the whole thing. Not
every little QGIS feature is working yet, but things work fine with
most commonly used data sources (GDAL/OGR, PostGIS, SpatiaLite).
Please give it a try! The code is available in my QGIS repository on
GitHub, the branch is called threading-revival:
https://github.com/wonder-sk/QGIS/tree/threading-revival

The plan is to continue working on the project in the following weeks
to reintroduce support for features and data providers currently not
supported (e.g. WMS, WFS). Hopefully by the time of feature freeze in
late January the code will in condition to be merged to master, so the
multi-threaded rendering can appear in QGIS 2.2 release.

The project has already quite some history: it started as my GSoC
project in summer of 2010, unfortunately it was not merged back to
master branch because the code never get into production level
quality. The scope of the project is not just about moving rendering
into background: it is mostly about updating various pieces of QGIS
core library and data providers to behave correctly in the case that
more threads simultaneously try to access the same resource - until
now the assumption always was that there was only one thread. Back in
2010, QGIS code was much less ready to change those assumptions. Now,
after the release of 2.0, the code is much closer to what we need for
multi-threaded rendering: both vector and raster layer code went
through a major overhaul in the preparation for 2.0.

What to expect from the project:
1. better user experience. Browsing the map in canvas gets much
snappier - pan and zoom map smoothly with instant preview, without
having to wait until rendering of the previous view is finished,
without flickers or other annyoances. Even if the map takes longer to
render, you are free to do any actions in the meanwhile. It is a bit
hard to describe the difference of the overall feel, one needs to try
it out :)

2. faster rendering of projects with more layers. Finally, it is
possible to use the full power of your CPU. The rendering of map
layers can be done in parallel: layers will be rendered separately at
the same time and then composited together to form the final map
image. In theory, rendering of two layers can get twice as fast. The
speedup depends a lot on your data.

3. starting point for more asynchronous operations. With safe access
to map layers from worker threads, more user actions could be
processed in background without blocking GUI, e.g. opening of
attribute table, running analyses, layer identification or change of
selection.

What not to expect from the project:
- faster rendering of one individual layer. A project with one layer
that took five seconds to render will still take five seconds to
render. The parallelization happens at the level of map layers. With
one map layer QGIS will still use just one core. Optimizing the
rendering performance of an individual layer is outside of the scope
of this project.

What to expect from the project *right now*: things should generally
work, except for the following:
- data providers: delimited text, gpx, grass, mssql, sql anywhere, wfs, wms, wcs
- QGIS server
- point displacement renderer

For testing, simply use QGIS as you would usually do and see if you
feel a difference when browsing the map. In Options dialog, Rendering
tab, there are few new configuration options for you to play with: 1.
parallel or sequential rendering, 2. map update interval. The parallel
rendering may use all your CPU power, while sequential (currently
being the default) will use just one CPU core. The default map preview
update interval is now set to 250ms - feel free to experiment with
other values. Lower values will bring faster updates, at the expense
of wasting more time doing just updates instead of real work. Parallel
rendering can be switched on/off also directly in the map canvas by
pressing 'P' key - useful when you want to quickly compare the
difference between sequential and parallel rendering. There is another
magical shortcut, 'S' key, that will show very simple stats about the
rendering (currently just total rendering time), so you can again
quickly compare the impact of various factors (antialiasing, parallel
rendering, caching etc). These shortcuts are likely to be removed from
the final version, so make sure to use them while they are still
there!

Now, it is time for some details about the design decisions I took and
their justifications. Non-developers can happily stop reading now,
developers are encouraged to read that thoroughly :-) I would be very
happy to hear what other devs think about the changes. Nothing is set
into stone yet and any critical review will help.

- QgsMapRenderer class got deprecated (but do not worry, it still
works). The problem with the class is that does two things at once: it
stores configuration of the map and it also acts as a rendering
engine. This is impractical, because very often it is just necessary
to query or change the configuration without actually using the
rendering engine. Another problem is the fact that the rendering is
started by passing a pointer to arbitrary QPainter - it is fine for
sequential rendering, but not for parallel rendering where the
rendering happens to temporary images which are composited at any
point later. My solution was moving the map configuration (extent,
size, DPI, layers, ...) to a new class called QgsMapSettings. The
rendering engine got abstracted into a new class QgsMapRendererJob -
it is a base class with three implementations (sequential and parallel
rendering to QImage, sequential rendering to any QPainter). The class
has asynchronous API: after calling start(), the rendering will start
in the background and emit finished() signal once done. The client can
cancel() the job at any time, or call waitForFinished() to block until
the rendering is done.

- render caching has been modified. Cached images of layers used to be
stored directly in the QgsMapLayer class, however there was no context
about the stored images (what extent etc). Also, the solution does not
scale if there is more than one map renderer. Now there is a new
class, QgsMapRendererCache which keeps all cached images inside and
can be used by map renderer jobs. This encapsulation should also allow
easier modifications to the way how caching of rendered layers is
done.

- map canvas uses the new map renderer job API. Anytime the background
rendering is started, it will start periodically update the preview of
the new map (before the updates were achieved by calls to
qApp->processEvents() while rendering, with various ugly side effects
and hacks). The canvas item showing the map has become ordinary canvas
item that just stores the rendered georeferenced map image. The map
configuration is internally kept in QgsMapSettings class, which is
accessible from API. It is still possible to access QgsMapRenderer
from map canvas - there is a compatibility layer that keeps
QgsMapSettings and QgsMapRenderer in sync, so all plugins should still
work.

- rendering of a map layer has changed. Previously, it would be done
by calling QgsMapLayer::draw(...). I have found this insufficient for
safe rendering in worker thread. The issue is that during the
rendering, the user may do some changes to the internal state of the
layer which would cause fatal problems to the whole application. For
example, by changing vector layer's renderer, the old renderer would
get deleted while the worker thread is still using it. There are
generally two ways of avoiding such situations: 1. protect the shared
resource from simultaneous access by locking or 2. make a copy of the
resource. I have decided to go for the latter because: 1. there are
potentially many small resources to protect, 2. locking/waiting may
severely degrade the performance, 3. it is easy to get the locking
wrong, ending up with deadlocks or crashes, 4. copying of resources
does not need to be memory and time consuming, especially when using
implicit sharing of data (copy-on-write). I have created a new class
called QgsMapLayerRenderer. Its use case is following: when the
rendering is starting, QgsMapLayer::createMapRenderer() is called
(still in the main thread) and it will return a new instance of
QgsMapLayerRenderer. The instance has to store any data of the layer
that are required by the rendering routine. Then, in a worker thread,
its render() method is called that will do the actual rendering. Like
this, any intermediate changes to the state of the layer (or its
provider) will not affect the rendering.

- concept of feature sources. For rendering of vectors in worker
thread, we need to make sure that any data used by feature iterators
stay unchanged. For example, if the user changes the provider's query
or encoding, we are in a trouble. Feature sources abstract providers:
they represent anything that can return QgsFeatureIterator (after
being given QgsFeatureRequest). A vector data provider is able to
return an implementation of a feature source which is a snapshot of
information (stored within the provider class) required to iterate
over features. For example, in OGR provider, that is layer's file
name, encoding, subset string etc, in PostGIS it is connection
information, primary key column, geometry column and other stuff.
Feature iterators of vector data providers have been updated to deal
with provider feature source instead of provider itself. Even if the
provider is deleted while we are iterating over its data in a
different thread, everything is still working smoothly because the
iterator's source is independent from the provider. Vector layer map
renderer class therefore creates vector layer's feature source, which
in turn creates a copy of layer's edit buffer and creates a provider
feature source. From that point, QgsVectorLayer class is not used
anywhere during the rendering of the layer. Remember that most of the
copied stuff are either small bits of data or classes supporting
copy-on-write technique, so there should not be any noticeable
performance hit resulting from the copying.

- rendering of raster layers is handled by first cloning their raster
pipe and then using the cloned raster pipe for rendering. Any changes
to the raster layer state will not affect the rendering in progress.

- update to scale factors. I have always found the "scale" and "raster
scale" factors from QgsRenderContext confusing and did not properly
understand their real meaning because in various contexts (composer vs
canvas) they had different meaning and value. There were also various
rendering bugs due to wrong or no usage of these factors. By scaling
of painter before rendering and setup of correct DPI, these factors
are now always equal to one. In the future, we will be able to remove
them altogether.

- composer has also been updated to use QgsMapSettings + QgsMapRendererJob.

- labeling engine has seen some changes: it is created when starting
rendering and deleted when rendering has finished. The final labeling
is stored in a new QgsLabelingResults class, which is then propagated
(up to map canvas). Also, it is possible to cancel computation and
drawing of labeling.

- the API remained the same with only tiny changes within the
internals of labeling, diagrams, renderers and symbols, mainly due to
the fact that QgsVectorLayer is not used in the vector rendering
pipeline anymore. Callers should not see any difference (unless using
some exotic calls).

Finally, some further thoughts/questions:

- rasters - currently we do not have API to cancel requests for raster
blocks. This means that currently we need to wait until the raster
block is fully read even when we cancel the rendering job. GDAL has
some support for asynchronous requests - anyone has some experience
with it?

- rasters (again) - there are no intermediate updates of the raster
layer when rendering. What that means is that until the raster layer
is fully rendered, the preview is completely blank. There is a way to
constrain the raster block requests to smaller tiles, but what would
be the performance consequences? I am not that familiar with the way
how raster drivers are implemented in GDAL... anyone to bring some
wisdom?

- PostGIS - I had to disable reuse of connections to servers because
it is not safe use one connection from multiple threads. If reusing of
the connections is an important optimization, we will probably need to
implement some kind of connection pool from which connections would be
taken and then returned.

Okay, I think that's it. Sorry for the long mail to all the people who
read it until the end. Please give it a try - I will welcome any
feedback from the testing.

Regards
Martin

Hi Jorge

What about QgsDistanceArea class? It does the calculation of distance
/ bearing on ellipsoid.

Hi Martin,
Just a minor thing, probably an accidental omission. Your list of
data-providers that don't work doen't include the Oracle native one but I
suspect probably should.
>From a non-dev's perspective it looks quite promising. :-)
Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi, Martin, thank you for your answer.

Well, the problem is that QgsDistanceArea class provides a function to 
(that's what I think due to my limitations in C++) calculate the 
distance an bearing between two points (start-end points). This is what 
INVERSE Vicenty Formula does, and I think thatthat's the formula 
implemented in QgsDistanceArea with its method computeDistanceBearing. 
This metod, as stated in the API documentation,calculates distance from 
two points on ellipsoid based on inverse Vincenty's formulae: given a 
departure point P, and destination point P2, it yields the distance 
between the two points and the bearing from P to P2 as well as from P2 to P.

But I want to perform another calculation: Calculate the destination 
point P2 given an departure point P, a bearing B and a distance D. 
That's what direct Vincenty Formulae performs and it's what I'm looking 
for :(

Thank you very much,

Jorge Tornero

Great work Martin.  I have been using this branch as my normal QGIS for the
last couple of days and it feels loads better.

I think the idea of the new classes and splitting the responsibly of what
each one does up more.

Myself, or Tamas, will update the MS SQL driver just after Christmas so
that is ready to go for the merge.

For curiosity, can you post the code of the bug?

Some day I tried to use addAttributes, but I found that using
initAttributes/setAttrobite makes QGis more stable.

Hi Luca,
the code is as simple as creating a memory vector layer, populating a list
of QgsField and passing the list to addAttributes method of the provider.
It was a simple example for the course.
Generally I set the attributes one by one through the layer, inside an
editing session  This works fine. But addAttributes works only on 32bit.

Great work Martin!

I am working to speed up to vector rendering?https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/980?(http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8725) using current master branch as base.?I wonder if I should better develop my patch using your branch as base.

Anyway, cheers!

Hi Martin,

(CC'ing gdal-dev : original email is
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2013-December/029716.html)

just commenting on the interesting raster topics.

Indeed there's an API in GDAL for asynchronous requests :
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc24_progressive_data_support
Note that it has a "real" implementation only in the JPIPKAK driver
(driver that implement the JPIP protocol - JPEG2000 trough the network -
with the Kakadu library). For other drivers that don't have a dedicated
implementation, a default implementation will just turn the async requests
as a sync request (more precisely GetNextUpdatedRegion() will just do
a RasterIO(), other methods mentionned in the RFC are no-op).
Real cancellation / async request is generally hard to implement since the
low level libraries used by drivers must support it. The analysis must be
done on a per-driver basis (determine which drivers are important for you,
which ones are slow, see if it can be remedied in the general synchronous
case, otherwise imagine how async request could be implemented, ...)
We could imagine that the default GetNextUpdatedRegion(), instead of
issuing a single RasterIO() could split it up into several RasterIO()
if the request window crosses several tiles (in the case of a tiled
dataset) to allow cancellation between the calls to GetNextUpdatedRegion().
But that's no always a beneficial strategy. Drivers can use the fact that
a RasterIO() is done on a "big" window to optimize things a bit, w.r.t
issuing several RasterIO() on smaller windows. In GDAL 1.10, I've for example
implemented multi-threaded block decoding in the OpenJPEG driver : if the
window of a RasterIO() call spans over several tiles and you have several
cores, then each tile will be decoded in parallel.
Regarding the current API of asynchronous requests, I feel there's perhaps
a lack of a way of signaling that data is ready. GetNextUpdatedRegion()
works on a pulling startegy. Perhaps a callback mechanism could be usefull.
That topic needs some thinking...

You can issue a GDALRasterIO() call with a buffer size that is smaller than
the source window. If the raster has overviews (.ovr file, computed internal
overviews, or "implicit" overviews in formats like JPEG2000 or ECW), then they
will be used. (Of course, you can also directly issue GDALRasterIO() on a
overview band, but that will be equivalent performance-wise).
Otherwise, full resolution data will be fetched and then sub-sampled, which can
take some time. No magic solution here.

That all sounds absolutely brilliant! Thanks for such a nice clear
description of how it all fits together. I know you are only considering
layer-by-layer rendering but does your design accommodate further future
optimisations easily? I'm thinking of things like:

* predictive / off screen  rendering of 3x3 canvas dimensions after the
initial render so that any pan is near instantaneous (and would trigger a
new off-screen render)
* on zoom, resample first then over render the resampled image (like open
layers and other web toolkits do so you see a resampled version of the old
render which gets overpainted as the new render comes in)
* symbol layer render in threads - I believe even single layer draws can
benefit greatly from the render-then-composite approach you are taking -
rendering each feature into a buffer when symbol layers are enabled (and
then compositing the buffers after rendering them) means that no feature
should need to be retrieved more than once when rendering.
* render caching of symbol layers (so that if only one layer gets changed
not all others need to be re-rendered)
* progressive rendering (e.g. rendering in a generalised way ala A Huarte's
patches and then update the display and the start a second pass render with
full detail) - that way you get a very fast first render but if you stick
around at that AOI the render quality improves as the second pass happens


I know there are possible issues with memory consumption with some of the
above ideas,  and they are definitely not on your current roadmap, but it
would be good to at least play a little mental soccer with the above ideas
and see if the architecture you have devised can accommodate such further
optimisations cleanly in the future.

I just built my copy of your branch while I wrote this email - can't wait
to go and try it out now!

The 'destination' method of the Vincenty class in geopy seems to do this:

https://github.com/geopy/geopy/blob/master/geopy/distance.py

def destination(self, point, bearing, distance=None): # pylint: disable=W0621

The top-level LICENSE file seems to just require preservation of

So obviously adding async API support for other common formats would
take a lot of time... I was secretly hoping that the remark in rfc24
mentioning only jpipkak driver was just a temporary state of affairs
:-)

However I realize that actually I do not really need to have truly
asynchronous requests. The requests from QGIS are being made from
within a worker thread, so it is not a problem if GDAL block that
thread. The only thing I need is to be able to tell GDAL to stop
reading data as soon as possible once the rendering gets cancelled.
API-wise, I would like to have a method in GDALDataset, using which I
could register my custom function returning cancellation status of the
request (just true/false). The drivers would be responsible for
calling that function whenever appropriate during RasterIO to check
whether the request has been cancelled or not. It would be probably
much less hassle to implement this functionality in drivers - although
I understand that still many drivers using custom libraries won't be
able to provide that functionality.

Regards
Martin

Yes, that's a reasonable possibility. The callback could also take
as parameter a percentage of completion. That could actually be a
GDALProgressFunc (
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/browser/trunk/gdal/port/cpl_progress.h )

That would be really good to keep room for this improvement. This is how
maps on the web generally behave, and it's a behaviour that many of my
students and customers ask about at their first impact with QGIS.

Hi Martin,

So nice to see this close to master!

Just tried with a big project.

At launch, I have the database login showing up (since there is too many 
connections apparently):

And it doesn't stop showing up while in the project

Will try with a smaller one ;)


Cheers,
Denis

I have had this idea in my mind while working on the project. In
theory map canvas can spawn several renderer jobs (instead of just
one) and let them render just one tile of the map. Some special
handling of the labeling would be necessary if we wanted labels that
are allowed to cross the border of tiles.

Actually that's already there :-)
When you change the extent, the old map will be still present, just
scaled. It will be there until the first update of the preview (now
the default is set to 250ms). So, first quarter of the second you will
be looking at the older resampled map (of course if your new map is
rendered under 250ms, it will be shown as soon as it is done).

This could be quite interesting thing to do. I guess the vector layer
renderer class could actually spawn further rendering tasks for each
symbol level after initial load of features and their division into
groups based on their symbol.

So you mean render caching not only the whole map layers, but also
levels within layers? I am not sure how big the benefit of introducing
that would be - if the added code complexity wouldn't outweigh the
benefit of optimizing such case (i.e. how much of user's total time in
QGIS does he/she spend waiting for update after a change to a symbol
layer?)

I haven't really thought about that so far. We would probably need to
employ some guessing to know when does it make sense to actually do
the progressive rendering and when to render just once...

This 'progressive' thing reminds me of another thing worth trying: by
default we could try to cache all reasonably sized vector datasets
upon their load into memory. Then we would render the layers without
actually querying the backend. When the rendering is done, we could
then optionally run the query on backend to check whether our cache
needs updating.

Also, it may be interesting to build some temporary overviews for
raster layers (if not present) and do the progressive rendering there
- first a low quality render from the overview, then a real rendered
image.

Sure, it is always good to think ahead about possible improvements!

I believe GeoServer (well, GeoWebCache) uses "metatiling" for that purpose
within its WMTS/TMS. My understanding is that rather than rendering a
single 256*256 pixel tile like it was asked to, it renders a grid of 4*4
(adjustable; but that's the default) of those tiles (so 1024*1024 pixels)
and then clips that to get the requested tile. The result is that labels
look quite good crossing tile borders. Maybe something similar could work
for QGIS.

I have had this idea in my mind while working on the project. In
theory map canvas can spawn several renderer jobs (instead of just
one) and let them render just one tile of the map. Some special
handling of the labeling would be necessary if we wanted labels that
are allowed to cross the border of tiles.

Actually that's already there :-)
When you change the extent, the old map will be still present, just
scaled. It will be there until the first update of the preview (now
the default is set to 250ms). So, first quarter of the second you will
be looking at the older resampled map (of course if your new map is
rendered under 250ms, it will be shown as soon as it is done).

This could be quite interesting thing to do. I guess the vector layer
renderer class could actually spawn further rendering tasks for each
symbol level after initial load of features and their division into
groups based on their symbol.

So you mean render caching not only the whole map layers, but also
levels within layers? I am not sure how big the benefit of introducing
that would be - if the added code complexity wouldn't outweigh the

Hi Lee,

as Gino points, we are actually building pdf's of all versions of the
different documentation manuals, eg:

http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/pdf/QGIS-testing-PyQGISDeveloperCookbook-en.pdf

So
http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/pdf for 2.0 branch docs
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/pdf for testing docs
and only the manual for 1.8:
http://docs.qgis.org/1.8/pdf/

It's also possible to build this yourself off course, I think Sphinx can
also output epub format if you really want/need.

Richard Duivenvoorde

Very excited to hear this - I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this
confusing!

I tested your branch last week and the improvements were dramatic. Thanks
for taking the effort to tackle this. Together with all the recent render
optimizations and Alvaro's work 2.2 will be a fantastic release...!

Hi John,

there is work going on for putting it back. It broke on the old server,
and we are trying to set it up in a easier to maintain/share way on the

Hi,

as some of you have noticed, QT 5.2 is out. From release notes [1]:

"I am proud to say that Qt 5.2 fully brings Qt into the mobile space as a
true player in the app development market supporting Android, iOS,
BlackBerry, Sailfish/Jolla and Ubuntu Mobile."

Now it could be easier to port QGis to these platforms. I remember that QT,
from 5.0, uses OpenGL backend and it could render maps faster than before.

Hi all.
The default for raster rendering is to cut values at 2-98%. This is
inappropriate in many cases, and confusing for users. Is that OK if I
change the default to min/max?
All the best.

> I believe GeoServer (well, GeoWebCache) uses "metatiling" for that
purpose within its WMTS/TMS. My understanding is that rather than rendering
a single 256*256 pixel tile like it was asked to, it renders a grid of 4*4
(adjustable; but that's the default) of those tiles (so 1024*1024 pixels)
and then clips that to get the requested tile. The result is that labels
look quite good crossing tile borders. Maybe something similar could work
for QGIS.

Metatiling is a trick emplyed by almost every caching/tiling system. It's
on the client side. While buffering is made by the server.
Using both of them give the best results, but they're not alternatives.

Yeah, it would be great to see QGIS ported to Qt5. My hope is that
QGIS 3.0 will use Qt5 and Python3.

Not to my knowledge. OpenGL backend is used for QML-based user
interfaces (Qt Quick 2). But we are not using that for map rendering.
Switching to OpenGL for map rendering would be a big project.

Qt is the project that now includes Android support - with open source
license as usual.

Qt Mobile is a (new) different product, it comes with commercial
license, and brings you additional tools + support + cloud service.
You do not need Qt Mobile for QGIS on Android.

Is there any guidance regarding this?
I mean, on one hand, I think users (plugins dev mainly) might be upset 
if this change is happening so close to 2.0 release and on the other 
hand we don't want to wait ten years for this to happen, especially if 
this brings QGIS more easily on mobile device.
If QGIS 3 is brought as the "mobile" release, it might sweeten the pill.

We should be able to get our codebase into a state where it will
compile with both Qt4 and Qt5. The transition should be relatively
painless (mostly fixing the build and plugin/provider system). Even
after that, all the 2.x releases would still be based on Qt4 and
Python2 - no change whatsoever, so no reason for making plugin
developers angry. Just people building their custom projects based on
QGIS would eventually be able to use the new features from Qt5.

Thanks Martin for claryfing it.
I've given a look to the port status and it seems quite good.
It lacks some important, tipycal mobile features, like
positioning/satellite information, bluetooth, etc., which are planned for
5.3.0.

I think Marco already has access to the GPS on his Android port. I 
don't know how he did it, but I remember, that he has been showing it.

Hi Marco

as mentioned in my earlier mail, it's mainly that not all providers
have been updated yet. Then, I haven't checked how the server behaves
and the point displacement renderer does not work right now. There are
few other unresolved things like geometry cache for editable layer,
joined layers, SLD with pixel units, split extent in renderer.

On your own system of in the source tree?

I would prefer to keep the 2-98% in the source tree  myself.

Hi Martin,

I guess I am also running into the PostgreSQL issue. In general my
PostgreSQL based projects with many layers freeze after a very short
time, while the SpatiaLite based projects work very nicely.

Too many PostgreSQL connections? Can we limit the PostgreSQL connections
or can you better re-use existing connections?

Looks very promising - looking forward to testing my PostgreSQL based
projects once this issue is fixed.

Andreas

I also think that min/max would be more appropriate as default ina
fresh installation.

Min/max is inappropriate in many other cases. It is quite common to
get data with few outliers. The result in such cases with min/max is
black rectangle which is very frustrating and that was the case with
1.8.

I believe that it is better to get inappropriately rendered picture
than black rectangle. I understand however that it may be problem that
user does not notice that the cut was applied.

If we find 2-98% as bad as bad min/max we should invent something
better, not just switch from one bad solution to another one. We can
discuss for example the range (2-98%,1-99%,0.1-99.9%...) and different
situations (data types, number of bands).

Can you describe some examples where 2-98% is a problem (data type,
number of bands, map content, features/phenomena represented by those
2+2%,...) so that we can think about it better?

Hello Salvatore,

Great plugin, I was hoping to use it to videomaping open street maps.
I was able to make it work with your data, but not with mine. :-(

I keep getting the error below, even after changing my time format
to %Y-%m-%dT%H.%M.%S


Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Example #1 (less problematic): dtm and their legend are always shown
wrong; newbies do not understand why
Example #2 (more serious): rasterizing sparse vectors (e.g. rivers)
results in a black rectangle, as the number of pixels with valid data is
<2%.

In fact, I think we should help users more, e.g. by applying non linear
colour scaling (log, exp)  in case of very skewed raster values
distribution: if data are more or less normally distributed, no cut is
applied, and linear scaling is used; if they are badly skewdw or with
outliers, apply a non linear colour scaling. With some thinking, this
should solve most if not all user cases, without asking a normal user to
understand much about raster stats.

However, in my case the general setting "use min/max" does not seem to
be working.
Thanks for your thoughts.

AFAIK

The strategy of 2-98 is usually useful when there a "noised image", 
because we assume that the noise is a white noise and it
is randomized an isolated spikes.

THis is absolutely a right theory and really useful,
ma what kind of imagge are usually used in a gis system.

If we think at the ortophoto image the noise could be really happened 
because they came from a photo-sensor.

But is we think to a artificial image, like the 2-colors balck-white 
images named "carta tecnica" thata are trasposition of vectorial data.
Them are no noised images and has a really thin lines. Also the 
artifical thematic chars with colors and point and symbols and lines 
(outline and so on) are noise-less images.
Don't forget to think also to geological charts. Are all noise-less images.

So what kind of image are more used in a GIS system ?

This is not simple question.
The response is , "it is dependent by the kind of work you should do.".

But also another question is:
Usually the ortophoto are not simple to have . They are produced and 
have a license.
The thematic images are more easy to produce and are often without a 
license or has a free license.

More often the ortophoto images are available from a WMS system, and 
this is a solution that deny the use of the 2-98 strategy.

I have a *lat ,lon *point with projection system and I wanted to know the*
map x map y *so that i can map on the map

I am working in c++

Any help in this context will be highly appreciated

Thanks in advance to all

What is map x/y? Do you mean projected coordinates or screen/print
coordinates?
Is this a question within the QGIS API context?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] next Hackfest: Vienna
Message-ID: <52AC7B36.1060306@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

after last PSC meeting we decided to go to Vienna for the next QGIS
Hackfest.

This makes it possible for QGIS devs to spar a little with the Osgeo
C-tribe devs, because Stephan is organizing an Osgeo Code sprint there.

Because there is already an osgeo wiki page [0] we decided to not create
one of our own, but reuse that resource. For most questions: please
consult that page first: [0]

So: if you want to join: please add your name to te participants list in
the wiki page.

Normally the QGIS hackfests are organized by some local organizer, often
together with some (local/national) sponsors.
Though we are joining the Code sprint, it will be VERY helpfull if
people from our community would give a hand to Stephan for the
organisation. 	
Please email the PSC or Stephan for this.


Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <CAMtDFLKoQOKsF1kRE--WqgJAZAje4dYB8Pmt3SA-OcD2_JYh_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Sorry, I'm a beginner in pyqgis.
I found the signal "layerDeleted ()" in the QgsVectorLayer class,
however, I can't find it in the QgsRasterLayer class :

http://qgis.org/api/2.0/classQgsVectorLayer.html#acc3e594b1dac4815dc031a2236f66a96

Is there a reason ?
How can I detect that a raster layer has been deleted ?

Another question :
I didn't find a way to insert a layer at the bottom, not on the top.
I want to change the drawing order for a new layer.

Thanks
Regards,
Etienne

Hi Stefan,

also if I prefer the "serious" using of QGis, I like your OpenStreetMaPacMan idea. 
Funny. 
But, are you sure that a gis is the right platform to make a similar game ?
I imagine it more like a web application, where all of us can play to simulate a city life.

+1 :)

should be a good way to introduce gis at school. Some of the Italian local
chapter worked in projects involving (g)foss in didactic... A.furieri (mr.
spatialite) did a project to explain gfoss at school (I don't know exatly
how it was).

Some friends asked me to explain GFOSS at school, and I've serious problem
how to approch it in a firendly way.

let us/me know,

ciao Ginetto

Message-ID: <CAFO80_rqgM-bEf2wQKo5nM+wxn6EqwK_vfh7v0ypDpoRXLhX9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I can't find a python solution how to customize actions shown in the legend
menu opende using right click button

QAction registered in the QgsLegend can be retrieved using method:

QList< LegendLayerAction >QgsLegend::legendLayerActions(
QgsMapLayer::LayerType type ) const;

and the I can use iface.legendInterface().removeLegendLayerAction(QAction)

but this method is not available in QgsLegendInterface.

Other way is to get QAction that is listed in iface.action* and then
use removeLegendLayerAction, but not all QAction seems available in iface
and none in legendInterface(). e.g How to remove "Remove" QAction in this
menu?
iface.actionRemoveLayer() refer only to "Remove layer" QAction in layer
menu.

could be useful add QgsLegend::legendLayerActions to api to allow deep
customization?

thanks, Luigi Pirelli

Yes. My concept is Civilization like, module based (terrain, soil,
weather, waters, agriculture,...) with known trends (e.g. known
average temperatures and precipitations) and random fluctuations.
Currently I am thinking about robust framework for hierarchical
processing, data management, data exchange and user interaction. It
won't be that simple.

This it's still an issue and could be discussed here, if QGIS should not be
associated explicitly with gaming.

What we could do at least, is a gamified enhancement of data capturing,
where one gets acoustic feedback and credit points for each added
geographic feature.

Yours, Stefan

I don't know why there is no equivalent for raster layers.

But to solve your problem, you can use layer(s)Removed signals in the 
layer registry.

you would use:

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().layer(s)Removed.connect(this, yourSlot)

Then in your slot, check if the delete layer(s) is the good one.

Sorry, I had a quick look, and couldn't find how to do this.
Have to wait for someone else to answer!

Hi all.
In fact (optional) acoustic feedback would be good to have. Is there
direct support for this in Qt?
All the best.

What we could do at least, is a gamified enhancement of data capturing, where one gets acoustic feedback and credit points for each added geographic feature.

Hi Stefan,

also if I prefer the "serious" using of QGis, I like your OpenStreetMaPacMan idea.
Funny.
But, are you sure that a gis is the right platform to make a similar game ?
I imagine it more like a web application, where all of us can play to simulate a city life.

Imho, a lot could be derived from the image metadata: datatype, number 
of bands, 'photographic interpretation', etc.

- for 3 bands, 8 bit, assume rgb and do not stretch
- for 4 bands, 8 bit, assume rgba and do not stretch
- more bands and/or datatypes >8bit or float: usually means satellite 
imagery. I'd say, start with a stretch of 2-98%. Users of satellite 
imagery mostly know what to do when their image then still appears 
black, I think?
- 1 band data, >8bit: probably conitnuous data, possibly a dtm/dem, 
apply a stretch, maybe also 2-98 %? Of course all nodata pixels should 
be excluded from the 2-98% calculations.
- 1 band data, 8bit: probably sparse or 'class' data: discrete, might 
have lots of actual nodata values. A good default strategy might be to 
apply a random or default colormap.

Personally, I would refrain from non-linear stretch types as default. 
When I open a raster, I do not want too much 'intelligence' to happen. 
Also, I usually find the x-y% type of stretching more useful than the -x 
+y stdev type of streching, but that might have to do with the datasets 
I usually work with.

Problems of course arise when people/programs do not correctly set 
nodata values, etc. (e.g. in the case of rasterizing sparse vectors, all 
other pixels should be nodata). I'd say, do not build in too much 
intelligence to correct for things like that, in the end it only makes 
things more complicated.

My 2 cents.

Best,
Vincent Schut.

+1 I feel very much like Vincent. Maybe there is potential for
improvements in NULL value detection?

If there is some decision taken by the software, should it be 
communicated to the user? I am thinking of a message bar popping up 
"Hey, I think that a 2-98% representation suits your new layer best and 
I've applied that for you. But if you want to change it: here is a 
combobox and a link to the layer properties."

this would be annoying, but I think we should not "drop" (even if
virtually) values in any case without letting the user know.
does anybody confirm the general option is not working?
furthermore, I think some cleaning of the raster layer properties dialog
would also help users.
thanks.

We can try to distinguish discrete from continuous data by number of
values, but what will be the threshold? 2, 10, 50, 100...?

Can you define precisely "more or less normally distributed"?

In general, applying more sophisticated/sensitive decision can catch
correctly more cases but it will become more difficult to be
communicated  to a user. Until we hide it under single  "intelligent"
style option.

Contrast enhancement "Stretch to min/max" is not applied to new raster
layer? For me it works.

Have you tried to run QGIS 2.0? I think that most of what you are

I also hate programs which "intelligently" do something what I don't
want. OTOH I also hate application which are not able to do some very
simple task like render a raster so that I can see more than black
rectangle. Unfortunately such simple task appears to be quite
complicated. In this situation I would prefer first to try to improve
style decision instead of resign completely.

Decisions are always taken in case of rasters. We are only talking
about particular detail of that decision. I.e. we have to choose
renderer, decide if stretch should be applied or not and stretching
mode is the last. What has to be communicated and what not?

Communicated yes, but how? Dialog is disturbing, soft message are not
being read.

Yes, so we can either ask user when QGIS is run the first time to set
some global defaults (nobody will do (correctly)) or we can try to
guess the type of data which will never be 100% but it can be better
than it is now.

BTW, we can reconsider to decompose WMS images to RGB bands.

I have to study a bit to be more accurate. Perhaps we can use some
outlier detection algs (I remember in R they have implemented a few).

IMHO normal users should ideally have something reasonable displayed out
of the box, at least in most cases. Power users can tweak things as they
want, I do not think they should be our first target.

Not, is the Limits -> Minimum/Maximum that has a behavious I did not
understand at first (I assumed it used 100% by default).
Sorry about the noise.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Connecting composer closure with another window
	focus
Message-ID: <52AF0810.2060605@espaces-naturels.fr>

Hi all,

I'm running QGIS 2.0.1 on Ubuntu 12.04, 64 bits (installed with 
ubuntugis-unstable repository).

I've created a form, which shows a composer when I click on a button.
This form stays active while the composer is showed, but is located 
behind the QGIS main window.
I'd like it to come back in front of the screen when the composer is 
closed by user.

After several web searchs and tests, it seems that the following 
function works :

/def operationOnTop(self): //
//     self.raise_() //
//     self.activateWindow()/

My problem is to connect a ? composer closed ? signal with this function.
I think the signal should be QgsComposerView.composerViewHide. I'm right ?

* I tried to connect it with the above slot  :

/QgsComposerView.composerViewHide.connect(self.operationOnTop)/

But QGIS returns :
AttributeError: 'PyQt4.QtCore.pyqtSignal' object has no attribute 'connect'
I can't understand this error message : all signals should have 
? connect ? attribute, right ?

* Trying with the old ? connect ? way :

/self.connect(QgsComposerView(), QtCore.SIGNAL('composerViewHide'), 
self.operationOnTop)/

My plugin doesn't crash during loading, but nothing happens when I close 
the composer.
I've added ? print 'operationOnTop' ? to the end of the function, to 
test its loading. Apparently, the signal is not catched, as I have no 
return in the Python pannel.

Can you see what I've missed in each case ?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Kind regards


PS : I've tried to make the connection in the class constructor :

/class OperationDialog(QtGui.QDialog): //
//def __init__(self, iface): //
//QtGui.QDialog.__init__(self) //
//self.ui = Ui_operation() //
//self.ui.setupUi(self) //
//self.iface = iface //
//self.canvas = self.iface.mapCanvas()//
//...//
//QgsComposerView.composerViewHide.connect(self.operationOnTop)//
///
Should I put it in the function which creates the composer?

Hi,

I often had the problem that connecting to a signal did not work, too. 
My solution always was to make the object which throws the signal an 
object of the class
so instead of
QgsComposerView....
try
self.QgsComposerView....

I have no idea if this is generally true neither can did I investigate 
why it worked in my cases

Message-ID: <52AF1244.6010206@gmail.com>

Hi dev,

I just created a pull request to run QGIS-Processing headless.
I have tested it with a qgis and a modeler algorithm.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1031

Review and comments are welcome

To test QGIS Processing algorithm headlessly, you can use this python code
__________________________________

import sys, os
import inspect

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from qgis.core import *


# supply path to where is your qgis installed
QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/path/to/your/qgis/build", True)

# load providers
QgsApplication.initQgis()

# load a project
p = QgsProject.instance()
p.read( QFileInfo( "/path/to/a/project.qgs" ) )

# init QApplication for processing
a = QApplication( sys.argv )

# init QGIS Processing
from processing.core.Processing import Processing
cmd_folder = os.path.split(inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe()))[0]
if cmd_folder not in sys.path:
     sys.path.insert(0, cmd_folder)
Processing.initialize()

# import QGIS Processing tools
from processing.tools import *

# print an algorithms search
general.alglist( 'buffer')

# print an algorithm help
general.help( 'qgis:fixeddistancebuffer' )


# run an algorithm
alg = Processing.getAlgorithm( 'qgis:fixeddistancebuffer' )
general.runalg( 'qgis:fixeddistancebuffer', '/vector/layer/input/uri', 
0.1, 5, False, '/vector/layer/output.shp' );

# quit
QgsApplication.exitQgis()

Thanks a lot Bernhard for your answer.
This was the solution!
Instead of

/        composerView = diffList[0]//
//        composition = self.composerView.composition()//
////composerView.composerViewHide.connect(self.operationOnTop)////
/
I tried

/*self.*composerView = diffList[0]//
//*self.*composition = *self.*composerView.composition()//
////*self.*composerView.composerViewHide.connect(self.operationOnTop)////
/

And now it works!! The signal is connected with the operationOnTop 
function, and my form comes back in front of the main QGIS window after 
the composer closure.
Thank you very much!
Best regards
Vincent

Thanks Gino and Denis for these answers.

For the signal, it's ok. Even if the signal from the vector layer is
better than the signal in the layer registry.

For the order, I didn't see anything interesting in the
QgsLegendInterface : http://qgis.org/api/classQgsLegendInterface.html

Etienne

It's derived from QObject so it also emits destroyed() signal[1].

You can move the layer using QgsLegendInterface::moveLayer()[2]

Phonon should be in the package.  I was able to install the plugin.  Does this work in the QGIS python console:

from PyQt4.phonon import Phonon

What would be nice is if QGIS has a trouble shooting option under the help
menu. Through a series of questions,  the trouble shooting system can give
the user suggestions on solving their problem.

Ah, it's not that phonon is missing (it's not) but phonon needs QtDBus, and that is missing.  Must be a recent link requirement I missed.  Works for me because it finds it in my development environment.

I'll have to package an update with the needed QtDBus...

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] wrapped C/C++ object of type QgsMapRenderer has
	been deleted
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYrx2bb+Eq8NSK84FJEUJV0VZ92hJeJ5Dub1cve92xsgMA@mail.gmail.com>

I have got strange bug report for python plugin, when calling from initGui()
   iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().hasCrsTransformEnabled()
it gives
   RuntimeError: wrapped C/C++ object of type QgsMapRenderer has been deleted

>From C++ code I see that QgisApp mMapCanvas is created in QgisApp
constructor and never deleted and QgsMapCanvas mMapRenderer is created
in QgsMapCanvas constructor and deleted in QgsMapCanvas destructor. I
don't see how it can happen that QgsMapRenderer is deleted.

Any clue?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Filter query definition doesn't update in tooltip
	over layer
Message-ID: <1387271451564-5094594.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
When playing a lot with filter request on postgis layer, Tooltip content is
no more in sync whith actual query. 

Another strange behaviour observed twice, on loading a project, filter query
disappear from filter dialog, and is hard written in datasource definition.
There is no other way to change it but manually cleaning qgs file. 
anybody confirms? 
Cheers
R?gis

Hi all,

I wrote a brief post on the code sprint website [1] about the QGis
Hackfest joining the Code Sprint. Let me know if you want me to add or
change anything.

Feel free to subscribe to the tosprint mailing list [2] if you're
interested in sprint related communication.

Well, it's possible that it was compiled right after I committed a fix to the source this morning.  The package on my site is just a fix to the package without a rebuild, but the source fix should not break it like I did.

William,


also the QGis-2.0.1-6  has the same empty video box problem.  :(

BTW, here there is a link for the test video and gps data :

https://www.dropbox.com/s/ugm7awhlwlt5yj3/Dati%20VUT.zip


and this a short tutorial, from my blog:

http://droneplanner.blogspot.it/2013/12/video-uav-tracker-plugin-per-qgis.html


I know, it's an italian language blog? I am sorry;  but, more than words,
it's important the video shown.

:)

Hmm, that blog video tutorial also has its own empty video problem - in Safari, in html mode (no flash), the video just disappears after loading the initial view.

So, don't know how to test the plugin...

Hi Radim

I have encountered this problem recently by chance when working on
multi-threaded rendering. In SIP file for QgsMapCanvas, the
mapRenderer() has /Transfer/ annotation (see commit 0246816e). The
annotation has been obviously added to fix some other problem with
"canvas.mapRenderer().hasCrsTransformEnabled()" idiom. I think the
root of all evil is the fact that "hasCrsTransformEnabled" is both a
signal (with one argument) and an ordinary function (no arguments). My
guess is that SIP probably interprets that combination wrong, it seems
that this is not a problem with other functions/signals.

In any case, /Transfer/ annotation does not seem right. Maybe
/KeepReference/ function annotation would solve the problem (I assume
the python wrapper was getting destroyed too early). Also, having a
signal and a normal function with the same name also does not feel
right - but I guess we need to live with it until 3.0.

Regards
Martin

Got it.  Another missing bit in Qt - the phonon backend that actually does the video playback work.  Another package update coming soon. (tested and works)

Thanks for the explanation. Keeping reference to the object returned
by canvas.mapRenderer() helps.

Are you going to fix those problems?

Note: in my case, the error happens on QGIS 2.0.1 64 (Qt 4.8.5) / Win7
64 bit but it is working  on QGIS 2.0.1 32 (Qt 4.7.1) / Win7 64 and XP
32, but that only question of more frequent garbage collector, I
think.

Hi,

With the most recent build QGIS master now renders much slower than QGIS
2.0. Things get worse when I zoom in in my project.

Compared to QGIS 2.0 it now renders 5-10 times slower.

Any idea what would cause the issue?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Alvaro,

I recompiled with "Release" mode instead of "Debug" and it seems back to
normal speed or maybe even faster. Maybe too many debug messages on the
console that slowed down QGIS. My projects have many layers (50-70) and
many labels.

Strange - I will have to do further tests. Sorry for the noise.

Andreas

I am studing recent changes in postgre driver, I think that the PR-980 #8725 is not the problem.

yes many debug messages to the message logger will decrease responsiveness
a lot. I experience that with InaSAFE where we were logging in a 2000
feature loop. the loop would block while using normal print statements it
works in 10sec

Not now (busy with other things)... but the only thing I can think of
is to use /KeepReference/ instead of /Transfer/ for mapRenderer()
call. Feel free to commit such change if it works well.

Hi Bernhard,

As far as I know, Martin will be working on the legend infrastructure 
soon and I suppose he will also take care of this (or at least prepare 
the required infrastructure). I would wait for the outcome of this 
project (or further information from his side) before investing any 
time here.

Hi Matthias,

thanks for the information. I will be patient :-)
It would be nice to have some kind of diagram legend next year.

Hi dev,

I can announce today that the French Search Institute Ifremer is partialy
funding the development of Web Processing Service on QGIS-Server.

The final goal is to execute QGIS-Processing Server-side.

The first step was to run QGIS-Processing headless. I made a pull request
which needs review and test.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1031

Next steps: developing the WPS interface and executing algorithms server
side.

Are you going to reuse the excellent PyWPS framework, or build a specific one ?

Do you plan to integrate the WPS modules selection and settings directly 
inside the Processing interface or with a specific one ?

How can I create empty QgsGeometry, i.e. type WKBNoGeometry?

Simple QgsGeometry() does not create empty geometry.  It has mGeometry
= 0 and saving in OGR results in warnings: "OGR error: Pointer 'hFeat'
is NULL in 'OGR_L_CreateFeature'".

QgsGeometry.fromWkt('POINT EMPTY') creates something but probably
wrong and use of such geometry is causing QGIS crash.

Compiled QGIS testing (12 dec) on a clean debian wheezy box

copied qgis_mapserv.fcgi into /usr/lib/cgi-bin and created a vanilla qgs

but while getting a capabilities response, I'm not able to receive map

some other problems:
- if I start a epsg:28992 project, then the latlon capabilites contain
those crs coordinates in the LATLONboundingbox in capabilities
- if I start a epsg:4326 (latlon) project, then both the latlonbbox and
the crsbbox contain latlon coords???

also some problems with the 'crs selection' in ows properties of project
dialog.

When I try to load the layer via a remote QGIS wms connection, I see the
error:
- 'Cannot calculate extent', Raster layer is not valid ...
When I try to load an image via a local browser I see this error:
invalidCRS: could not create output CRS

Am I doing something wrong, of does the server need more info?

Hi Matteo,

This is unfortunately not possible with the relations feature. 
Nevertheless, there is the "Join" feature in the layer properties, 
which enables you to do what you want.

I hope to be able to integrate this feature into the realtions as well, 
so we will have a more integrated solution.

A simple but powerful solution would be to implement an export to PyWPS Python 
code similar to the existing Python export.

Good news!
Where does QGIS Server fit into this? I mean, if we implement WPS with
PyWPS and headless Processing, QGIS Server isn't required. Are you thinking
to QGIS Server as a proxy to PyWPS?
I hoped you were considering to implement Python support inside QGIS Server
(as it was discussed a year ago), but probably it would be a lot of work
having to integrate the python interpreter...

Hi

sorry for the late reply

This looks great to me. I have just merged it and made a minor
cosmetic change to a line of code, but it's great to see that there is
a way of running headless Processing.

More valuable than the pull request is actually the script that you
provide. Where do you think it would be the best place to put it?
Maybe in the PyQGIS cookbook?

One little thing. In these lines:

alg = Processing.getAlgorithm( 'qgis:fixeddistancebuffer' )
general.runalg( 'qgis:fixeddistancebuffer', '/vector/layer/input/uri',
0.1, 5, False, '/vector/layer/output.shp' );

You actually do not need the first one. If you get the algorithm, you
can then run it using the alg object, but the second line should work
without the first one.

Many thanks again for this contribution!

Hi,

Well - it is not so easy to use 1:n relations in styling - not as easy
as with the 1:1 joins. At least not from the "1" side. What would you
use (min, max, mean, median, other aggregates)

Or are you talking about the "n" side - where there is a clear relation
just to one element that could be used?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problem with forms and python init function
Message-ID: <CAM_TN38f=A52327xnyhQroCNaWZ35xuHnohMFEwt8+pfEOu3Wg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,

I'm a newbie with pyqgis so apologize me for the trivial question. I'm
trying to create a forms using QT and to add some intelligence into it
using the "python Init function", present in the Layer properties ->
field menu. I want to update the data in combo2 on the base of the
combo1 choosed value, but I encountered some problem, probably due to
my lack of knowled of QGIS API. This is my first problems:

I try to read some data from a layer using this code [1]. If the layer
is a geometry layer all works fine but if I try to read the data from
a table (without geom coloumn) i cant read the attributes. Both object
are QgsVectorLayer so I though that I can use the same methods. In
order to resolve this problem i just addes a geom coloum to my table
but it's just a ploy.

The second, and the very real problem, is that when I try to update
the the value using the
curLayer.changeAttributeValue() method some strange beaviours occours.
- If i try to commit changes from the code (using
curLayer.commitChanges() ), and I'm in the table form view, Qgis
crash.
- when I try to commit changes use the toogle editing mode button, and
I'm in the table form view, all my changes are lost.
- when I try to commit changes use the toogle editing mode button, and
I'm just in the form view, changes are lost alternatively once on two
saving operation.

I don't understand if this is a problem of my code or a qgis bug.
Any hint ?

I hope to have described the problem clearly.
thank in advance

Luca

Hey Luca,

If all you want to do is load the attributes for a column from layer you
can just do this:

layer = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayersByName('yourname')[0]

for feature in layer.getFeatures():
     combo.addItem(feature['columnname'])

That will loop all the features and load the value from columnname into the
combo.  You will have to add more smarts to that if you need more logic.

If you are in your initFunction you already have the layer:

def init(dialog, feature, layer):
  for feature in layer.getFeatures():
        .....

+1 for that, simple, flexible and powerful. And Unix spirit too :-)
If we want tighter integration, it is a matter of packaging PyWPS with QGIS.
Or implement a way of sending bundled WPS scripts from QGIS to a PyWPS server.

As for performances, I think having python for serving WPS is not damaging, 
since the performances issues are more related to the algorithms 
implementation than the WPS server itself.

Thanks Nathan, your code is decisively more clearer !

 nevertheless the problem remain  the same: if i try to load the data
from a table without geometry, values for i.attributes()[1] remain
empty.

Hi Luca,
I tried your sample code and it works... I don't know what's wrong in your
situation...

If your problem remain the same,
I could suggest you to use QgsFeatureRequest with NoGeometry flag

(see Detailed Description in:
  http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsFeatureRequest.html )

Example:
layer = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayersByName('your_table')[0]
iter =
layer.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest().setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.NoGeometry))

for feat in iter:
    print feat.attributes()
    print feat.attributes()[0]
    print feat.attributes()[1]


Ciao!

Enzo

you are right, the code now works fine.
It was just my fault due to to the fact that I'm trying to take ones
first steps with pygis !

thanks for the support and sorry for the noise.

Btw I also resolve my second problem described in the first mail.

Hi Brent,

See http://blog.vitu.ch/10112013-1201/qgis-relations for some
information on the QGIS relations.

I think that this is just the beginning. The relations have much more
potential - e.g. with styling, enhanced forms, aggregates, reporting
with the Atlas serial printing, etc.

We hope that Matthias can continue to work on this in the second half of
2014. He is currently busy with his master thesis where he also works on
QGIS globe.

If you know someone willing to fund his work in the second half of 2014,
let us know.

Thanks,
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2 on Centos ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7ktof+TnpnYcNvEO2=F+rootkejwG=cs4ny7YBv+3mqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have some client asking who is responsible for packaging QGIS on
Centos/Redhat .
At present, QGIS is still in 1.8 version in the ELGIS repositories, even in
testing. Does anybody use Centos on this list and can share ways to get
QGIS 2 ? If compiling is the only way for now, is there anywhere some tutos
on it for this specific platform ?

Thanks in advance

Michael

Hi Michael,

I know Matthias Kuhn has been busy to create a docker image to build a
fedora rpm's and telling me that it was pretty easy to do the same for
rhel too...

The idea was to even set up our own repo for that fedora.qgis.org or
rhel.qgis.org or so. Not sure what current status is though...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Michael,

There are some centos packages listed in the official download section
[1]. I had to exclude minor parts of the python bindings [2]. If
somebody is actually going to run into issues with these, the underlying
problems could be investigated.

The nightlies mentioned by Richard are working in principle, the missing
parts are basically, that they are built regularly and uploaded to a
public repository.

Best,
Matthias

[1]
https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#rhel-centos-scientific-linux
[2]
List of excluded python bindings:
- Parts of QgsComposerEffects
- QSet<QgsComposerItem*> QgsComposerItemGroup.items()
- QHash<int, QString> QgsVectorDataProvider::palAttributeIndexNames() const
- bool QgsMapTool::gestureEvent( QGestureEvent* e )

Sounds interesting. It would be good to extend it to SpatiaLite, and
possibly to integrateit to DB Manager.
Any interest?
All the best.

Well just to be clear: if a new plugin dev uploads his/her plugin into
the public QGIS repo, it will not be visible for the general public
untill somebody  from a group of devs will test and approve this plugin.
I see that Nathan now approved the plugin so it is visible now also to
Brent :-)

General note to plugin writers: please do not feel offended if your
plugin is not approved immediately, sometimes the devs responsible for
approving are just to busy. Another reason is that it is just not clear
enough what you plugin action is.
So please create a plugin page somewhere, or a good README at Github,
and if you plugin still does not get approved. Sent an email to the dev
list and ask for it.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS this also applies for Pull Requests: please explain as good as
possible, and just ask

Hi

The plugin uses a only slightly modified version of the steam logo [1]. 
Are there any copyright issues involved with this?

I \have been struggling for a week with a fresh installation of QGIS 2.0.1
(Dufour) and the development version. I get a Debug Error on the Program :
C:\path\qgis-bin.exe 
   Module: 4.7.1
File global\qglobal.cpp
Line:2262

QPixmap: Must construct a QApplication before a QPaintDevice

(Press retry to debug the application)

and three boxes showup with Abort, Retry and Ignore. 

If I choose abort it closes, retry it will return the error message again,
and Ignore for a few times it will get into QGIS GUI but the error comes
again and again to the point of frustration.

I reinstalled from a windows install, OSGeo4W setup with advanced (Which I
always used and worked before this one) and any combination thereof and
nothing seems to work. The machine is stuck.

Hi,

I am using the QGis python console for the use of exporting an active layer from postgist to a shape file layer.  I want to include the symbology as is possible through the GUI of QGis 2.

I am using the writeAsVectorFormat<http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorFileWriter.html#a289af78b5b609fbcb0572aaf505f2822> method of the QgsVectorFileWriter class, but keep getting errors as if the parameter doesn?t exist. Can anybody give me an example of the use of this method that includes the used symbology of the original layer.

Th alternative would be save the style als SLD and import the style file after creating the shape layer, but if I can avoid that ...

Thanx in advance kinds regards,

Pim Verver

Posting a small code snippet of what you have already come up with would
probably be useful for folks wishing to help you.

nothing seems to work. The machine is stuck.

I installed QT 4.8 and then uninstalled it thinking it will help me get rid
of the QGIS error. Do I need to install QT 4.7 (designer, and compiler)? I
am confused. I use VS2008 express to do custom programming.

Thank you for your help,

Maaza

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SymbologyExport parameter
Message-ID: <c8fc3191a58342518daa4a1945827bc2@DBXPR06MB598.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,
I am using the QGis python console for the use of exporting an active layer from postgist to a shape file layer.  I want to include the symbology as is possible through the GUI of QGis 2 (Dufour).
I am using the writeAsVectorFormat<http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorFileWriter.html#a289af78b5b609fbcb0572aaf505f2822> method of the QgsVectorFileWriter class, but keep getting the message that there are "Too many arguments" as if the parameter doesn?t exist. That seems correct given the fact that the mouse popup for the parameters doesn't indicate a Symbology parameter. However in the  official QGis API the parameter is mentioned: http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorFileWriter.html#a1aac90d30d811d2888d1aab4098ad63c. The symbology parameter seems tob e added in the latest release (QGis 2)
Am I using it the wrong way or is someting else going on?
The alternative would be save the style als SLD and import the style file after creating the shape layer, but if I can avoid that ...
The console code sofar:
canvas = iface.mapCanvas()
aLayer = iface.activeLayer()
if aLayer.dataProvider().name() == 'postgres':
    writer =  QgsVectorFileWriter
    error = writer.writeAsVectorFormat(aLayer, r"D:\Documenten_Travelingo\SkyDrive Pro\Horeca routes\Projectbestanden\deBaak Driebergen\Shape bronnen\\"+ aLayer.name() + ".shp", "CP1250", None, "ESRI Shapefile", False, None,"","", False, None, "NoSymbology", 1.0)
#    then import the shape file in a new layer
if error == QgsVectorFileWriter.NoError:
    vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(r"D:\Documenten_Travelingo\SkyDrive Pro\Horeca routes\Projectbestanden\deBaak Driebergen\Shape bronnen", aLayer.name() + ".shp", "ogr")
    QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)
Th error is raised at the writeAsVectorFormat method and its parameter NoSymbology.
Thanx in advance
Kinds regards,
Pim Verver

Hi

I'm not sure why the Symbology flag is not working (havent time to look
sorry) but a quick fix might be to do this (which worked for me in a quick
test):

error = writer.writeAsVectorFormat(aLayer, r"/tmp/out.shp", "CP1250", None,
"ESRI Shapefile", False, None,"","", False, None,
QgsVectorFileWriter.NoSymbology, 1.0)
aLayer.saveNamedStyle("/tmp/out.qml")

(u'Created default style file as /tmp/out.qml', True)

Hope that helps!

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

I executed an exact copy of your line of code and got the same error'

This is what I tried:

canvas = iface.mapCanvas()
aLayer = iface.activeLayer()
if aLayer.dataProvider().name() == 'postgres':
    writer =  QgsVectorFileWriter
    error = writer.writeAsVectorFormat(aLayer, r"/tmp/out.shp", "CP1250", None, "ESRI Shapefile", False, None,"","", False, None, QgsVectorFileWriter.NoSymbology, 1.0)

if error == QgsVectorFileWriter.NoError:
    vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(r"D:\Documenten_Travelingo\SkyDrive Pro\Horeca routes\Projectbestanden\deBaak Driebergen\Shape bronnen", aLayer.name() + ".shp", "ogr")
    QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)

And the error: Tceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
  File "D:/Documenten_Travelingo/SkyDrive Pro/Horeca routes/PostgrestoShape.py", line 5, in <module>
    error = writer.writeAsVectorFormat(aLayer, r"/tmp/out.shp", "CP1250", None, "ESRI Shapefile", False, None,"","", False, None, QgsVectorFileWriter.NoSymbology, 1.0)
AttributeError: type object 'QgsVectorFileWriter' has no attribute 'NoSymbology'

I work with the console of  a Dufour 64 bits version on a Windows 8.1 machine. The qgis_core.dll is present in C:\Program Files\QGIS Dufour\apps\qgis\bin. Can it be that the windows version is an old compilation because as I understand the SymbologyExport parameter was just recently added to the source code?

Kind regards

Message-ID: <op.w8u0xvgkna7rjy@anita-pc.home.gateway>

Hi,

I just unapproved the Hello world plugin on the basis of that it is not  
useful for the general user base.
It seems like the plugin was created as a test case for the plugin  
management system. I see why that is useful but I also think we should  
avoid having such things show up in the production version.

At least I would like to encourage the use of the "experimental" flag for  
all plugins which are of no direct use to QGIS users but which were  
created by developers for developers or for testing purposes.

What do you think?

Best wishes,
Anita

I've done the first step and also the third one (I've created a repo in
github) , but I haven't been able to follow the second step:

Create a new project at
http://hub.qgis.org/projects<http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins>
and
make it a subproject of "User Plugins"

How should I proceed?


Best regards,


Jorge Tornero

Anita: I also agree it should be kept as experimental or test case. 
I have another question on the PgRouting plugin. I get an error message
while starting QGIS saying that the python version is wrong. Is it written
for Python 2.5 or 2.7?

But I am not a voting member, so do not add my response about the plugin.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] C++ plugins instructions
Message-ID: <1388361272636-5095747.post@n6.nabble.com>

I have an issue that after upgrading my C++ plugins to 2.0.1, they do not
show up in the 2.0 version of QGIS. Has the procedure for identifying and
installing C++ plugins in QGIS 2.0+ changed? I have tried using the start-up
plugins generator and that does not show up also in the 2.0 version. 

I have asked this question more than three times and I have not heard a
reply. May be it is the holidays, but I have been asking since October the
same question. I looked and tried many ways, and I am still without an
response. Is there a new instruction for plugin registration? Do we have a
new policy to limit C++ plugins from users, a new unwritten policy to unplug
C++ plugins?  

Just wondering,

I've only tested using 2.7. It's well possible that it does not work with  
2.5.

Sorry about that. In general if you get no response to the mailing list, it
is a good idea to try to contact someone to help on IRC, or try to make
direct contact with a developer who is active in the same area that you are
working on. If you still can't get the help you need, you could also
consider asking one of the commercial consultants on this page:

> Is there a new instruction for plugin registration?



I don't believe there is a new procedure. It would be an extremely good
idea to look at one of the existing core c++ plugins (e.g. coordinate
capture plugin) and see if it is doing anything different in initialisation
to yours.

Certainly not.

For general questions (i.e. anything that is not a PSC vote), anyone can
vote / offer their opinion - the only criteria is that you need to be
interested enough to offer one.

Message-ID: <CALCNqkbaat2_RsFwPFkLzVDn=a80jYQ4nwu5JME9591bOvcvkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Over the last couple of weeks, I have started compiling a list of
interesting new features for the visual changelog for QGIS 2.2. Could I
invite others to add entries there too. You can either do it directly on
the changelog site [1] (you need to create yourself a login first) or send
me an email with the following info:

* Category of feature
* Title for new features
* Feature description in markdown or plain text
* A screenshot if possible (it is a *visual* changelog)
* Your full name for the image credits.

Please take a look at the existing entries to ensure that you are not
duplicating work.

@Nyall maybe it would be nice to get another entry for composer summarising
all the other improvements you have made, I know I haven't done the work
you have done justice in the list so far.

Thanks

Will do!

Incidentally, the "overflow: hidden" setting on .media,.media-body in
the changelog css breaks the site on mobile chrome. With this setting
only the images are visible, not the text.

Generally speaking, I agree.

But in that particular case (HelloWorld), I feel that people are using it
as a template to explore/start the development of their plugins. It was
downloaded more than 4000 times and people did warn me in the past when it
was broken/uncompatible with newer QGIS version. In other words, even if it
does just nothing (it's a test plugin) I'm sure it has been useful to other
users.

No problem for me to left it unpublished, I will republish it if I need it
for testing but next time, please, be polite and ask the author *before*
unpublishing.

Hi Tim, thanks for your work, but I have a question: the entry '# Feature: New keybindings' is implemented in PR #1010 but it is not yet merged.

I have other pull requests with new features (#1040, #1046) not merged neither,?in any case, I should add a new entry?
Thanks you very much.

Alvaro

Hi Alessandro,

Thanks for chiming in.

I'm sure the plugin is useful for plugin developers. For users though,  
it's just confusing to have a plugin offered which doesn't do anything.

Sorry, I didn't think it was a big deal since it's not a silent procedure,  
there are notifications, and reapproving it just one click. I completely  
agree that plugins which users might depend on should not be unpublished  
without notification, except if something is seriously wrong. As I already  
mentioned, I think it's enough if Hello world is marked experimental  
anyway, so I reapproved it.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Anita,

well, the plugin in fact does something even if not very useful: it opens a
small window with a button.

Did you have any real feedback from users being confused from the
HelloWorld plugin? After all, it clearly advertises itself as an example
do-nothing plugin.

Can you explain me why do you put plugin developers in a different category
than users? I tend to see plugin authors as (power) users.
 If I were a new QGIS user, I would like to have starting point to develop
plugins, of course we have the coockbook and the builder plus plenty of
blog articles, but as a programmer, what I would search is exactly that:
the simplest possible plugin to start tampering with.

But I definitely agree that HelloWorld should not have a dual purpose
(testing the plugin repository and provide a barebone example for wannabe
plugin authors), so here's my proposal: unpublish HelloWorld and create a
new Example plugin with the purpose of providing a simple starting point
for new plugin authors.

There is feedback from at least one user who think it should not be on the  
list of "official" plugins:
https://twitter.com/dig_geo_com/statuses/417293802387152896

I can understand that it does not leave the most professional impression  
if users find "weird testing stuff" in the "official" plugin list. (Note  
that I'm speaking from the perspective of users without open  
source/programming background.)

Many GIS users are not programmers. They have QGIS installed by their IT  
department and might or might not be able to install additional plugins.  
They certainly won't touch programming with a ten-foot pole.
I think it's a valid distinction to make and the first impression should  
not alienate these more casual users.

I totally agree with your statement from the perspective of someone who  
knows at least some programming. But not everyone is in this position.  
Many users come to QGIS without feeling the need to develop plugins. Too  
often all they want to do is visualize some data, maybe have some  
background map from OpenLayers plugin.

Personally, that doesn't bother me. I'm fine however you decide.

Best wishes,
Anita

+1 to Anita's post. The vast majority of GIS users aren't programmers in my
experience (which is my masters and my current employment with 100+ people
who use GIS in some form). Simpler is almost always better.

It may not seem that way from mailing lists, but these are a self-selecting
group of the more technically-proactive users (dev lists even more so).
Cheers,
Jonathan

For 1010 I committed your PR thanks. For the others, I'm fairly confident
they will both be merged once the details are ironed out, so yes adding new
entries would be good (perhaps it is better to wait until after the PR
merges though).

Hi to all,

i've a problem with my plugin 'Video uav Tracker', it is always updatable.
I checked metadata.txt and init.py and everithings seems to be okay, 
then tried to close the project and re-create it, but nothing changed.

Could somebody take a look?

Thanks a lot,

Salvatore

Hi,

I'm writing to inform you that QGIS now has a dedicated mailing list where  
people can chime in and collect and
discuss QGIS related UX (User Experience) / usability issues (as discussed  
in http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-psc/2013-December/001840.html).

http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-ux

Best wishes,

I think the last two parameters were added with DXF export coming in 2.2 so
for 2.0 this should work for you:

error = writer.writeAsVectorFormat(aLayer, r"/tmp/out.shp", "CP1250", None,
"ESRI Shapefile", False, None,"","", False, None)
aLayer.saveNamedStyle("/tmp/out.qml")

The Qgis2threejs plugin just references gdalwarp as if it is already
available on PATH. Assuming you are using Kyngchaos.com install, you will
need to ensure the following is on your PATH:

/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs

However, since it is a little tricky augmenting PATH for a GUI app on Mac,
you can try prepending it to PATH using the Custom Environment Variables
available in the QGIS Preferences, under System.

If that does not work, there are a couple of other approaches to augmenting
PATH for a Mac GUI app [0].

I might see it if google showed me the image ;)

I can say that gdalwarp IS installed - it's in the GDAL framework.  I installed the plugin and it didn't complain.  I don't know what to do with the plugin to see if it fails when running it.

My guess is that it needs a configuration option to be able to set the location of gdalwarp.  There is an environment variable option in the QGIS prefs that might work - you would add PATH and set it to /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.10/Programs

Maybe what is needed is a checkbox for programmer related plugins such as
Plugin Builder, Plugin Reloader, ScriptRunner and HelloWorld?  One another
idea is to integrate HelloWorld into Plugin Builder?

Simply, load an image (possibly a dtm, like a .bt or a .tif ), before to call the plugin. 
It displays the qgis image into a 3D viewer web page.
I tested it on (bleah!) Windows and it works (very) well. :)

I don't know since now that MacOSX had the PATH variable, also  :(

I will try to set

Thank you

Hi,

yes, this is a solution, I feel that with over 6000 downloads it is
probably useful for somebody to study how a minimal plugin does work.

But HelloWorld is also used as a test plugin for the plugin repository:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/tree/master/qgis-app/plugins/tests/HelloWorld

I collected a lot of HelloWorld versions that I use to test version
conflicts, metadata parsing, UTF8 support and a lot of other errors that
appeared in the past.

But I'm fine to leave it unpublished, I can re-publish it when testing.

Hello Minoru,


Your  "Qgis2threejs"  is  great !

This is an image I taken from it:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwg_m86uaXY1LUVzdmV0bUdNcnM/edit?usp=sharing


Well,  I have some suggestion:

The only thing that I find to be improved is the fact that it opens a new
web page, and that is opened in QGis an information panel on which (if any)
choose the DEM layer.

For me, the panel should be "confined" in a panel on "Settings", and
instead the function must be called directly (and using the same web page)

Sure, with this, everything would be (even more) immediate and amazing.

Also I suggest to use a temporary directory inside the plugin directory, as
in my GEarthView plugin.

What do you think about ?

Thank you for your great work and ... Happy New Year all in 3D !!!

Roberto

Hi,
a quick test on Debian showed a blank page on Iceweasel, and a couple of
(movable) grey polygons on a blue background on Chromium.
Possibly a missing lib, or missing webgl support? Any hint?
All the best.

I second Alessandro that HelloWorld plugin has it's place, next to
Plugin Builder.

While HelloWorld is a really minimal plugin (as minimal as possible),
really usefull to make your first plugin. The Plugin Builder is already
pretty complex for a newby (because working with Makefile, translation,
documentation etc etc).

Both have there merits I think. As long as it is clear from the
description that HelloWorld is a test/dev plugin without real purpose, I
think it should be available to all.

By the way, Alessandro the plugin isn't unpublished currently.

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all.
Following the interesting article by Anita:
http://anitagraser.com/2013/12/29/address-finders-in-qgis-osm-place-search-vs-osmsearch/
I would like to ask the authors, Piotr Pociask and Xavier Culos, if they
would like to merge forces, reduce duplication, and publish an unified
OSM address search plugin, possibly also involving the authors of
similar plugins, e.g.
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/GeoCoding/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ru_geocoder/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/geopunt4Qgis/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/pdokbaggeocoder/
If successful, such a plugin could be included in the standard QGIS
package, with great advantages.
All the best, and thanks.

I will increase the number of items in the dialog. I have already
implemented multiple resolution output that has both detailed close
view and rough distant view, and would like to challenge vector data
output. I think it is good to provide an option to output simple one
by 1-click from the toolbar button so that user can preview easily. I
will also consider an option to open page in existing tab.

> Also I suggest to use a temporary directory inside the plugin directory, as

I'll consider it. If you have some reasons that temporary directory
inside the plugin directory is better than system temporary directory,
please tell me.

Hi Paolo,

Can you view a sample page linked from README [1]? WebGL support is
required. A list of browsers that support WebGL is on Wikipedia page
[2].

If we are going to integrate this into core, I would like to see this
functionality form part of a new search toolbar that does spatial search on
the web and displays the results on the canvas. The implementation should
be generic enough that we can add other data sources. We could add a
twitter search and other types of services too. I'm imagining something
like in firefox where you choose the search engine in the search box and
then enter your search criteria - except in our case the results are shown
as features on a map. When you click on a feature it could show in an
embedded webkit widget the result details (tweet, osm details etc).

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,
thanks for picking this up; this is what I had in mind.
Any news from the plugin developers?
All the best.

When I "make" after building, I get error like this:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Installation using OSGEO4W 32 and 64 bit.
Message-ID: <52C304A8.5080804@northrivergeographic.com>

So I've tried this a couple of different ways but the end result is the 
same. So I hope it's just me.

I downloaded the 32 and 64 bit installer of OSGEO4W and have done an 
install (using each in two different attempts). Here are the steps and 
the error messages (I think) I'm getting. At the end of this I have a 
QGIS install with most of the GDAL menus missing (or at least that's 
what I call them).

1. Download the installer.
2. Right click and run as administrator
3. Select Express install
4. Click Next twice and then I get an error (except the install these 
packages to meet dependencies is checked).

5. I install and QGIS is missing all the GDAL oriented menus under 
vector and raster.

For fun I built a brand new Win 7 VM 64 bit and installed and had the 
same thing happen there also. Everything seems to be working except QGIS 
- and like I said it starts - but not with the correct number of tools.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis-dev has dependencies on ECW ?
Message-ID: <CABqTJk-1HWK8FB-G3SfA+iGrViTY+0m5WkMZ-gf172SGV0Y7Wg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,
I'm just no to update my install of qgis using the osgeo4w .
And I see the osgeo4w report me that actually qgis-dev
ask as mandatory dependencies this packages:

>gdal-ecw    (1.10.1-2)
>    ECW Raster Plugin for GDAL
>    Required by: qgis-dev
>
>gdal-mrsid    (1.10.1-2)
>    MrSID Raster Plugin for GDAL
>    Required by: qgis-dev

I don't understand why the gdal-ecw and gdal-mrsid are mandatory.

Thx,
