I think this is a good idea, for the future, as it augments the probabilities
that fixes apply cleanly to the stable branch.
Unfortunately it's too late for 2.0.

Another trick to help with backporting can be, for developers, to keep two
different directories with the source code: one tracking master and one
tracking last stable branch, to reduce the cost of testing if a bug exists
in the stable branch and fix it there (running qgis from build dir is
possible since 2.0).

This doesn't only help with maintaining the stable branch, but also with
verifying regressions (a bug that exists in master but doesn't exist in
the stable branch is a regression and should block next release).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Layer selection
Message-ID: <524A85C1.1020703@heurisis.eu>

Hello,

I do not know if this is the right place to ask this question. If not, 
please tell me.

I would like to iterate over a list of layers. For each layer, I would 
like to zoom to its extent and create a pdf file (using the QgsComposer).

At the beginning, the layers are already loaded but not selected. I am 
facing a problem to select each layer. The following code does not work. 
The list of selected layers is desperately empty.

from qgis.core import (QgsMapLayer,
                                        QGis)

def run_script(iface):
         legend = iface.legendInterface()
         layers = iface.mapCanvas().layers()

         if len(layers) > 0:
             l = layers[0]
             legend.setLayerVisible(l, True)
             iface.setActiveLayer(l)
             print legend.selectedLayers()

I am stuck. Any help would be appreciated.

Regards,

Beno?t

I'm not disagreeing, "Testing" or "Preview" seems like reasonable names,
as long as no one gets them mixed with "Release Candidate". "Preview"
might be better as that term does not exist in the Debian world at all
from what I know.

I do know where the term "unstable" comes from though: yesterdays build
worked, today's doesn't, maybe tomorrow will but we can't be sure. So
it's more of the - it may break at any time and we reserve the right to
break it for a few days if some big change is working through.

Thanks,
Alex

Thinking about it, I like "preview" more than "testing".
It encourages people to test it (who does not want to preview what's 
coming up next?) but at the same time emphasizes, that it's not final 
yet and readyness for production should not be taken for granted.

Hi all.
If I try to run an analysis on a WCS, I get a strange error:

GDAL provider: Cannot open GDAL dataset

sying that the output file is not valid: should an empty file exist

All the best.

stable is often also tied to a fixed feature set.  so unstable might just mean
that the feature set can change.

This sounds reasonable to me. More formalized:
* no regular bugfixes to release-2_0 branch until all packaging issues
are resolved and new release is tagged (most probably final-2_0_2, but
may be final-2_0_3, ... if another packaging issue appears)
* open release-2_0 for regular bugfixes once packaging issues are
solved (will be announced by release manager)

Is it acceptable for release manager, PSC and others?

I am asking because I have fix for #8724 (96bd7e7f) and I am willing
to backport it to release-2_0 but I am not sure if I am allowed and
when.

Hi,

I'm trying to load a GML from command line. The file loads fine using
Add Vector Layer GUI. The command used to work fine in 1.8 and works
if I exchange the GML with a Shapefile for example.

iface.addVectorLayer(path+'|layername=Edge',"route","ogr")

Can anyone reproduce this GML-related problem?

You are taking WCS layer as input? I guess that the error message is
wrong and it reports wrong output instead of input. Which "analysis"
do you mean, SEXTANTE? Could it be that SEXTANTE just takes layer URI
and expects that it is a file supported by GDAL?

the C++ terrain analysis plugin. if this is so, I guess the option to

which analyses are supposed to run with WCS?

Hi all.
The Add vector menu correctly navigates the local network (Windows),
whereas the Browser cannot explore inside the content of folder (added
as links on the desktop). Apparently, networks cannot be added to the
list of items in Browser. Is this a know limitation of Browser? Any
workaround?
Thanks.

If I revert 61e101dd4 and 597c4028 it compiles, but QGIS gives on start

ProcessingToolbox.py", line 57, in __init__
    useCategories = settings.value(self.USE_CATEGORIES, type = bool)
TypeError: QSettings.value(QString, QVariant defaultValue=QVariant()):
'type' is not a valid keyword argument

so it seems that keyword_arguments="Optional" in Module definition is
now necessary but it is not supported by SIP 4.10.2. The fix by Jef
0f3f440cd fixes compilation, but did somebody try if it also works?
For me it does not.

In any case, the fix is only applied if compiled as Debian package,
would it be possible to do it conditional in .sip files according to
SIP version?

QgsRasterTerrainAnalysisPlugin gives to QgsRelief layer URI as
inputFile, QgsRelief simply opens it as GDAL file and it fails.
Unfortunately QgsRasterTerrainAnalysisPlugin does not check
QgsRelief::processRaster() returned value and probably tries to add
result as new layer, which fails and gives correct error message (for
ne layer it is really input).

AFAIK, various raster analysis are still using access through GDAL,
this should be upgraded to read data from raster layer. Quick fix is
to filter out in input combo boxes all non GDAL layers.

Please create a new ticket.

Ok, I eventually solved my problem. In case others would face the same 
problem, use "iface.legendInterface().layers()" instead of 
"iface.mapCanvas().layers()", the latter only providing already selected 
layers.

Hi,

the QgsRasterLayer costructor has changed. If I try this:


rlayer = QgsRasterLayer('
http://testsrv/mapaccel?map=ciao.map&crs=EPSG:25832&format=image/png',
'test', 'wms')

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(rlayer)

self.iface.mapCanvas().refresh()


the wms raster layer is never added to map. How can I fix this?

keyword_arguments Module argument was introduced in SIP 4.12
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/hg/sip/rev/4a79f5996bd7
Current requirement for QGIS in INSTALL is SIP >= 4.8
Is it really necessary to have keyword_arguments? If yes, we have to
increase the required SIP version in INSTALL. The SIP version should
also be checked by CMakeLists.txt but I don't see any test.

It would mean that Python support will not work on Debian 6.0 Squeeze, bad IMO.

Hi, 
Oracle connection dialog does not show in 64 bits version (revision d94c044,
gdal 1.10), installed with OSGEO4W here. 
I get a error message "Impossible to obtain Oracle selection dialog from

32 bits versions does well (revision 341139bc, gdal 1.9.2). 

Something wrong only on my system? If someone can reproduce, I will open a
ticket.

I'm not the best one to answer this, but considering QGIS offers 2 APIS - C++ and Python - you should look for ways to use this kind of API in Delphi. For example:

hi all, sorry for crossposting but i think different groups could have
different feelings on this.

I was wondering, we are looking into how we could get more donations to
qgis.
how would you feel about adding a donate link in the help menu (like after
qgis website)? the link could then point to a qgis.org page  with all
possible payments backends we want to support or point directly to paypal
or similar.

i think this would give us a very simple/visible way to donate

ciao

Subject: [Qgis-developer] pyQgis QGS intersect
Message-ID: <CALwGb1Swq+9uHFmGcQsf-4VZu4PRTMJTcS1Yi3WAGpwAQ1Le4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi group,
I am trying to create a new line feature that extends to the first polygon
geometry boundary. Now i can simply do an intersects
function<http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/vector.html>available
within pyQGIS to determine if it intersects but is there a
function to determine where that line feature intersects a polygon (or
perhaps another line feature) as in an X,Y position? i.e.

for feature in layer.getFeatures():
    geom = feature.geometry()
    if geom.intersects(geom2): ## <- can i figure out the intersect point
here
        ##do something

Or is there a function that might be available within shapely or pysal?
Cheers,
Bjorn

Hi Marco,

yes, I think it is a good idea to put this in the application too!

Now we have a 'paypal'-button on the frontpage of the website, but what
I actually wanted (is on my todo list...), is one big html page with the
different possibilities of making donations to QGIS.
The idea is to make it easy for people to use different ways to donate
for the project. Yes, I have been looking into the OSM example [0] :-)

We could link to that page from within the application too.

I will create this page this evening, so we can fill it with different
ways to donate (we have a flattr account now too, for example).

Regards,

Richard

yes I think linking to our own donate page is better. so if we want to kill
a service we just remove it there.
great you make such a page. can you make the page accept a referrer or
similar variable? it could come in handy to track targeted donations

Hi!

Very good idea ..
speaking from removing or adding something ..

I find the "donators" Tab in the about box (Help -> About) pretty much
useless with containing just a link in a big white box ..
Any suggestions to improve that?
Probably just a menu entry?
I'd rather remove that Tab instead of having just one little link with
no information in it .

regards
Werner

I stumbled over this again. So I decided to fix this. [1]
This pull request changes the meaning of QgsFeatureRequest::NoGeometry.
Or maybe I should rather say it defines it and unifies behavior. It
seems, that this was handled differently by different providers. E.g.
OGR provider was returning features of a geometry-less layer regardless
of this flag, while postgres and spatialite providers spat an error to
the message log and didn't return any features.

New behavior is:
The geometry is not required to satisfy the request. It may still be
returned if e.g. required for a filter condition.

Are there any objections to this?

My main point in the change is to be able to query any layer (regardless
if it has a geometry or not) with a default constructed feature request
and get all rows.
Do we need a new flag RequiresGeometry? Can't just the layers/providers
geometry type easily be checked for NoGeometry instead? And would a
RequiresGeometry flag not rather have to be applied on a feature basis
(only return features whose geometry is not NULL)

Kind regards,
Matthias

Hi,
vector layer styles (categorized, graduated) based on attributes from
joined table are expected to work in master?

For me it does not work (shp <-> shp). Classification is correct but
all rendered as NULL value.

QgsRasterLayer constructor has changed, now it accept four arguments, the first
is the uri string.
To construct the uri string you must know what layers you want.

You could try this:

desired_layer = 'abcdefg'
uri = 'crs=EPSG:25832&featureCount=10&format=image/png&layers=' + desired_layer
+ '&styles=&url=http://testsrv/mapaccel?map=ciao.map'
rlayer = self.iface.addRasterLayer(uri, 'test', 'wms')

Hope this helps!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2 64bits, is it stable ?
Message-ID: <524C5152.3090507@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Some french users downloading the windows standalone 64bits version and 
they encounter bugs considered as blockers :
* IGNF:LAMBE -- not reprojecting https://hub.qgis.org/issues/7941
* Interpolation crash
* not conserving EPSG:900913 and not transform to EPSG:3857 for old project
* no GRASS plugin
* 'The selected color palette is not available' on windows7

I don't know if its just for 64bits version, but some users thought that 
*QGIS 2.0.1 is not stable enough* to be used in production. They are 
waiting for a bugfix release.

Regards,

Ren?-Luc D'Hont

Yes, it's intended to work. Sounds like a bug then.

 Hi,

 There are tons of problems with joined tables. Would be a useful goal 
 to fix these issues within QGIS 2.1.

 As an example one cannot edit layers anymore once they are joined (not 
 even the geometry of the original table). In addition one cannot filter 
 the layer anymore once they are joined. The query builder button is 
 disabled/greyed out after a different table is joined to a master layer.

 There are also crashes if a join is disconnected and the joined columns 
 are still referenced (e.g. in labeling, symbology and diagrams).

 For my own purposes, table joins are not very usable in its current 
 state. I tend to join layers in Postgis on the database level.

 Andreas

I have created http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8757

This is the very basic functionality! Please test, hopefully I missed something.

Hi Ren?-Luc, hi all,

I don't know about these specific problems, but I can well imagine, that
there are some flaws hidden in all the new features introduced, since
2.0 marks a huge step forward in terms of functionality.

Recently there has been a discussion around the topic of managing a
stable release with different opinions and plans from different parties.

As already said, I think that 2.0 marks a big step forward. All this
would not have been possible without a lot of time invested by various
people, some of it on a contract basis and some on a voluntary basis. I
have myself been spending countless unpaid hours on fixing bugs because
I wanted to make this release awesome (Just to be clear, it was fun, I
don't want to complain!)
I think the developers have (once more) shown, that they are able to
produce a professional product.

However, at the current stage, I think it would be very good, to have a
sponsored bug-squashing effort, just like we had to have J?rgen work on
getting rid of blockers before the release. I think we should promote
targeted donations to get rid of the most annoying issues. I'm sure
there are companies out there which save a lot on licenses. It would be
a good time to reinvest part of this money into the project.

Kind regards,
Matthias

Hi Matthias. agreed. 
How to fund, this is the question. I have budget (at least at the moment). 
I haven't been able to spend it completly in 2.0 release sprint because all
goes too fast for classical contract, where I'm constrained to pay for a
specific work (debug or feature). 
Please be warned to public finances are not good in europe, and every
unconsumed budget can be erased. 
Sponsoring should be a way to finance infrastructure consolidation, but in
current rules, sponsoring can't be oriented. 

I need help from the community to have a serious real use case unit test
suite. I'm ready to fund a part if PSC gives an infrastructure and a
manager. If no work canvas is given, I'm sure I won't have any successfull
commercial proposal to such a funding. 

I also kindly ask other funders to systematically include unit test
developpement for every new feature. 

Again today, I found 3 regressions, hard to find. I thought once 2.0 was
out, I could spend less time testing, and more time working. It's still not
the case. 

Again, you gave a lot unpaid work, when I was struggling to find a way to
spend some.. 
Hope we'll find a way. 
R?gis

Assuming it's not already done, I'd suggest that requiring Unit Tests for
all new features should be mandatory for a Pull Request/patch to be
accepted into QGIS. In the long term that would hopefully help alleviate
the significant number of regressions that we're seeing in 2.0.

+1

Of course providing tests will only be effective when there's also a rule
of not accepting changes beaking any of the tests, and that's only effective
when there's a continuous monitoring of testsuite runs. All of that is likely
yet to be defined by the new Testing and QA Manager.

Speaking of which, the psc page describes the roles but there's no link
to the currently appointed person for each role:
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/organisation/psc.html
(nor links to contextualize the path that brings there from the homepage)

Hi R?gis,
  Windows x64 2.0.1-2 install here - the Oracle dialog works fine. I didn't
use the OSGEO installer but instead used the standalone one. Worth trying
that?
Cheers,
Jonathan

This is probably better placed on the developer list (cc'd).
However I believe I read a message on there suggesting it was being ported
over.

Yes. Some sip version problem?

I can run make four times with errors and the fifth time it compiles without errors. But then I get an error on qgis startup that pyqgis will be disabled.

yes, that is because each run you pass a sip error and the generated file
is still partly done. eventually you generate enough times and the
compilation goes through. or something like that.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS : QgsMapRender does not project layers
Message-ID: <524D8DF6.8030903@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I encounter some difficulties with QGIS 2.

I have some code which rendering well layers in a PNg image, but now it 
does not project layers :

     # create renderer
     render = QgsMapRenderer()

     # set output size
     render.setOutputSize(img.size(), img.logicalDpiX())

     outputCrs = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(3857, 
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.EpsgCrsId)
     render.setDestinationCrs(outputCrs)
     render.setProjectionsEnabled( True )

     # set map units to get labels from new label engine
     render.setMapUnits(outputCrs.mapUnits())
     render.setOutputUnits(QgsMapRenderer.Millimeters)
     render.updateScale()
     labeling = QgsPalLabeling()
     render.setLabelingEngine(labeling)

     p = QPainter()
     p.begin(self.img)
     p.setRenderHint(QPainter.Antialiasing)

     render.setLayerSet(lst)

     render.setExtent(rect)

     # do the rendering
     render.render(self.p)
     # end
     p.end()

What I missed ?

And another +1. It's time to focus on code quality to reduce bugs and 
maintainance costs, for which it is always difficult to find funding.
We need more unit test, more code quality dashboards and much stricter rules 
relative to what code has to be accepted into master.
A PostgreSQL-like code inclusion workflow, with commitfest and review, could be 
something interested, to be discussed.

On the funding side, for information, public administrations, at least in 
france, cannot pay for a time based contract. Estimating how much time a bug 
fix could take is a really hard task (except if you fixed the bug already). This 
is a problem both for company willing to fix bug for paid contracts and for 
public administrations wanting to finance bugs, and can explain the funding 
situation related to maintainance and bugfixing.

I think this is a matter of balance: a large part of QGIS success is due to the huge
number of new functions and developers that keep on coming. Setting up to srtict
rules will dry up our main source.

IMHO a desktop program is a totally different beast from a server one. Unit testing
for atomic functions is relatively easy, it can be a nightmare when you have very
complex user interactions.

IMHO our main problem is sheer lack of resources: to work properly, we would need at
least 3 full time, paid persons:
* one for bugfixing and patch reviewing
* one for QA and unit testing
* one for infrastructure.
With 1M+ users, many local and central governments relying on our code, this seems a
reasonable requirement/goal.
Until we have this, I'm afraid all the rest will be largely speculative.

Yes, this is a crucial problem: I'm sure many people would be happy to pay for their
most annoying bug, if they knew how much would this cost, but as you described,
estimating the cost is about the same as fixing it.
We (Faunalia) solve this by proposing support contracts, with a fixed number of hours
for bugfixing, that can be used on demand. Possibly not the ideal solution, but it
works, both from a technical and from an administrative point of view.

All the best.

Hi Stefan,

Looking at the INSTALL file, minimum requirements for SIP is 4.12, 
while Ubuntu 10.04 still ships SIP 4.10 I think.
So unfortunately, yes, you are probably out of luck.

Regards,
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] features not shown if a rule has a join
Message-ID: <524E757A.3010805@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I opened an existing 2.0 project in master, and some features were not 
rendered.

It seems to occur when there is a joined attribute used in the rule 
based symbology.

This works in 2.0.

I looked for existing issues but I don't think #8757 correspend.

Could this be quickly fixed or shall I fill a bug?

Cheers,

Denis

Try building debian packages.   debian/rules fixes the sip files up in the
process.  And we have nightly builds for lucid...

Tested with a GML with only one layer now, and this does not cause a crash.

Other difference is that I tested on Ubuntu before and Win7 now.

If anybody could confirm, I'll open a ticket.

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OTB Configuration for Processing Toolbox
Message-ID: <1380880545981-5081774.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,
Has anyone configured a standalone OTB installation within the Processing
toolbox before? I have tried to configure it in the following manner...

OTB applications folder - ...\Monteverdi2-0.4\lib\otb\applications
OTB Command line tools folder - ...\Monteverdi2-0.4\bin

however everytime i try and run a script i receive the following error
message

'"...\Monteverdi2-0.4\bin\otbcli_Segmentation"' is not recognized as an
internal or external command, 
operable program or batch file. 

Interestingly in my Monteverdi there is no file otbcli_Segmentation but
rather otbapp_Segmentation so I do not know if that is the problem for me
(i've tried to rename it though with no luck)? In addition I dont know if it
should be running from the \bin folder considering that the .dll resides in
the \applications folder.

Any help would be appreciated,
Cheers,
Bjorn

I have to respectfully disagree with the premise behind this. I'm sure
ease-of-committing has facilitated much of the development, but at a
certain point in a popular project's life it should become "mature" - unit
tests, code reviews, etc. This will make it harder to commit that cool new
tool that someone hacked up over the weekend, but you know that when it is
committed and approved, it is a lot less likely to break something else.

Yes QGIS is almost undoubtedly the most popular FOSS GIS on the planet, but
it will struggle to maintain that reputation if lots of users start
encountering regressions and bugs and crashes.

Maybe the question should be - how do other successful Open Source desktop
applications do it? Could QGIS not find some other projects that release
regular relatively bug-free builds and ask them what their process is? QGIS
isn't the first project to encounter these problems; it can learn from
others. I don't know the answers which is why I'm posing them as questions
- but maybe someone else does.

Cheers,
Jonathan

Do we have a class which keeps a combo box updated with list of layers
in legend? I.e. updates the list if layer is added/removed.

Similar for combo box with fields of a layer selected above?

Radim,

Yes Denis has some code to do this in Python. There is a pull request for
this however we are going to change the approach and use a model style for
more flexibility.

If you project is in Python I would use stuff James linked to.

Hi,

Processing works with OTB command-line tools, not with
Monteverdi. You need to install OTB cli tools.

I think we have to be fair with the current state of the project in 
this discussion.

The stability of the current release is heavily influenced by 
increasing the major version number. What I mean with this is, that 
because for the next release only the minor number will increase, I 
expect it to be to be more stable and not less. Regardless of testing.

I'm by no means opposed to testing. I would like to encourage everybody 
to write test-cases. But, recently it appears to me, that testing is 
proposed as cure to all evil, which I don't believe. It can surely help 
to get feedback about broken functionality fast, but in the end it is 
also additional effort to implement these tests and keep them up to 
date. Let me quote Martin Gr?sslin "I rather use a working system 
without unit tests than a system with unit tests that doesn?t work" [1].

So right now, I think it is important to fix bugs. If somebody pays a 
developer to fix a bug, please feel free to include a regression-test 
in this contract. It will be appreciated. But even more important: 
Please DO consider hiring a developer to fix bugs at all.

You're right it won't cure everything, but it would mitigate a good chunk
of one subset of bug type.

It sounds good, but it's a false dichotomy - why can't you have both?

because of limited resources. if all the 1.000.000+ users of QGIS would invest 1 euro
per year in it, this would be quite feasible.
All the best.

True, but that's back to my comment previously about what other projects do
- there's bound to be OS software out there that also has very limited
resources (most aren't supported by RedHat or IBM) yet manage a more
rigorous testing regime. What could be learnt from them? Staying within the
very-niche GIS world I know the GeoServer devs also complain about limited
resources (it appears to have far fewer committers than QGIS), yet they
have a unit-test requirement for all patches/commits and regular bugfix
releases. I know it's not like-for-like, but it's indicative of what might
be accomplished.

Kind regards,
Jonathan

Hi, 
I must say my opinion is somewhere between Jonathan's and Paolo's. 
QGIS is getting fast with new feature, and this is needed to stick and go
beyond to proprietary softs. QGIS is the only one with such mapping and
redering capabilities, but it still lacks some critical basic features
(proportionnal object legend, totally solid joins, relates, label callouts..
) . 
So, we need to still be opened to new features.
 In the same time, regressions do cost ressources also, both for developpers
and users. 

What about starting the infrastructure for unit test and commit validation
and testing it now? 
I must say I could be very interested in a commercial support for this, if
this is sticking to community version and not a separate branch. The only
offer I saw was Sourcepole, in Switzerland, so out of Europe market rules
(yes), maybe I missed some others.

If you set up a list of requirements, I'm sure there will be people willing to
undertake the task.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python: Select features that touch other features
Message-ID: <524ED54F.1040205@carto.net>

Hi,

In my little python plugin I would like to do the following:

In a parcel layer the user can interactively select a street parcel
(typically long parcels). The user could select one or more street parcels.

My little python script should then select all parcels that touch the
selected parcels, so the touching features are in the same table than
the originally selected features.

I did not work with spatial operators and selections so far. Does
someone have some code around to start from?

Thanks a lot!

No reference ?

Any documentation for developers about how to create and run tests ?

All I could find on the website is this interesting page:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/Developers_Manual#Unit-Testing

"As of November 2007 we require all new features going into trunk to be
 accompanied with a unit test"

Is the document still valid ?

Any page reporting test run status ?

I think these are all part of an infrastructure (among other aspects)

Yes please !

But probably also coming up with a "list of requirements" would be part of
such project, as it will require finding an agreement among developers to
cope with policies that will need to be defined (I guess).

What about funding the new QA manager for working on such a plan ?

The nightly builds run tests.  And AFAIK http://jenkins.linfiniti.com/job/QGIS/
builds QGIS and runs tests after each commit.

In jenkins and for the nightlies on:

http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS

We might move that to our new server at some point.

Never heard of that - or successfully repressed it.

And most of these tests are not really freshly failing (see dash above).

Cheers,
That was simple enough... however i've run into another problem which i hope
is just as simple.  Whenever i run an application with a vector output i
receive the following error (this example from Mean Edision Segmentation).

Segmentation -filter edison -in

vector -mode.vector.out.shp 

ERROR: option -mode.vector.out.shp does not exist in the application. 

This is the Segmentation application. 
(here it starts to describe the parameters for that application)

Any ideas?
Thanks
Bjorn

Message-ID: <CABMk0NhYx_Hx_xs8mhjp1ASL9w47B4rUziDioZs2ZpbZsuQ-hg@mail.gmail.com>

To get back to the first question (stability of QGIS 2 64bits/ Win),
my feelings are that a lot of bugs had been corrected before the
release announcement, but package phase did not go to the same level
of control and showed many regression. For instance, French IGN
projections bug in master was a GRASS one, and that bug came back with
the released version (but that does'nt seem to be Grass's fault this
time). Old or removed packages had been inserted in the installer in
the first version. And so on.

My self-compiled-from-release QGIS brick  is strong. Other bricks are
separately strong too. But the wall made of those bricks isn't.

Because the extent of data reported in capabilities by server are
sometimes wrong (bigger), the WCS provider verifies true extent by
requesting reported full extent but low resolution (10x10). If the
server does not have overviews, it can take very long time (server
side problem).

Default cache mode is "Always Cache" it could be that you got timeout
the first time and the timeout response is cached.

or with ogr (same result):
-------------
    from osgeo import ogr
    # empty ogr geometry
    myunion = ogr.Geometry(ogr.wkbLineString)
    for elem in layer.getFeatures():  
           geom = elem.geometry()   
           # transformation of the QGIS geometry to ogr geometry     
           geoms = ogr.CreateGeometryFromWkb(geom.asWkb())
           myunion = myunion.Union(geoms)

Is there a comparable solution with PyQGIS ?

Try the QgsGeometry::combine() method.

Quoting class doc

*Note:*this operation is not called union since its a reserved word in C++.

Finally, I found the solution: it is 

*geom.combine(another_geom)* and not union, why ?

   gLine = QgsGeometry.fromPolyline( [ QgsPoint(1,1), QgsPoint(2,2) ] )
   gLine2 = QgsGeometry.fromPolyline( [ QgsPoint(1,2), QgsPoint(2,1) ])
   gLine2.combine(gLine).exportToGeoJSON()
   u'{ "type": "MultiLineString", "coordinates": [ [ [1, 1], [1.5, 1.5] ], [
[1, 2], [1.5, 1.5] ], [ [1.5, 1.5], [2, 2] ], [ [1.5, 1.5], [2, 1] ] ] }'

Control with Shapely:

   from shapely.geometry import asShape, mapping
   from json import loads
   geom1 = asShape(loads(gLine.exportToGeoJSON())) 
   geom2 = asShape(loads(gLine2.exportToGeoJSON())) 
   print mapping(geom1.union(geom2))
  {'type': 'MultiLineString', 'coordinates': (((1.0, 1.0), (1.5, 1.5)),
((1.5, 1.5), (2.0, 2.0)), ((1.0, 2.0), (1.5, 1.5)), ((1.5, 1.5), (2.0,
1.0)))}

Ok, the reply is 

          this operation is not called union since its a reserved word in
C++.

Thanks to Daniel-2, we post  at the same time.

Hi Daniel,

Thanks - this should do the trick! And it explains why I did not find
"Union".

Will try on Monday when I am back in the office.

Hi Andreas,

First create a spatial index over layer features (I got this code from
ftools_utils.py)

# Convinience function to create a spatial index for input
QgsVectorDataProvider
def createIndex( provider ):
    feat = QgsFeature()
    index = QgsSpatialIndex()
    fit = provider.getFeatures()
    while fit.nextFeature( feat ):
        index.insertFeature( feat )
    return index

Let's suppose that you have a vector layer "vlayer"



get the selected features:

# vector data provider
vprovider = vlayer.dataProvider()

# spatial index
index = createIndex(vprovider)

# selected features
selection = vlayer.selectedFeaturesIds()


for inFeatA in selection:
    geomA = QgsGeometry( inFeatA.geometry() )
    intersects = index.intersects( geomA.boundingBox() )
    for feat_id in intersects:
        # probably you want to discard some intersected feature that has in
selection so...
        if feat_id in selection:
             continue
        vprovider.getFeatures( QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFid( int( id )
) ).nextFeature( inFeatB )

Don't forgot to instantiate inFeatA e inFeatB

inFeatA = QgsFeature()
inFeatB = QgsFeature()


After vprovider.getFeatures() maybe you need to tests if inFeatB has a
valid geometry and if geometry touches the current selected one, something
like this:

geomB = QgsGeometry( inFeatB.geometry() )

if geomB.touches(geomA):
   # do something


http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsGeometry.html#a6f4183fe331cc77ba3683c9d0d9c7181
[touches method]
http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorLayer.html#a33968fa939503a9e3873c88e5f0ea439
[selectedFeaturesIds]


PS: Sorry for the noise, but I sent the previous email without conclude it.
This completes the previous one.

Hope it helps

Try something like this for your createIndex which will work with any
collection of features:

def createIndex( features ):
    index = QgsSpatialIndex()
    map(index.insertFeature, features)
    return index

index = createIndex(provider.getFeatures())

and also because I hate seeing while nextFeature() used :)

Using map() is the pythonic way


Maybe ftools need an upgrade :)

Thanks for the tip

Please be warned that it is in the "messyest" part of our code :)

Hi,

I am trying to union selected geometries in a layer into one geometry. A
multpolygon as a result would be fine if the selected polygons aren't
contiguous.

I did not find a union command in the API. How can I do this from Python?

Thanks a lot for any hints!

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] new server
Message-ID: <52513318.8020900@duif.net>

Hi PSC/Devs,

last week we ordered and received a new server at Hetzner.

It's a rental server, paid per month via Paypal.

Specs:
Intel? Core? i7-4770 Quadcore Haswellincl. Hyper-Threading Technology
RAM 32 GB DDR3 RAM
Hard Drive 2 x 2 TB SATA 6 Gb/s 7200 rpm
HDD (Software-RAID 1)
Class Enterprise
Connection 1 Gbit/s-Port
Guaranteed Bandwidth 200 Mbit/s
Backup Space 100 GB
Inclusive Traffic 20 TB*

Juergen seeded this server with Debian Stable/Wheezy 7
The kernel is upgraded to 3.10 to be able to use docker/lxc:
uname -a
Linux qgis2 3.10-0.bpo.3-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.10.11-1~bpo70+1
(2013-09-24) x86_64 GNU/Linux
It is running LVM being able to resize disks as needed.

IP: 144.76.174.102 /  2a01:4f8:200:5265:: / 64
Only way to connect is via ssh with public key access (password disabled)

Currently only Tim, Juergen en myself have access. Please ask access to
this machine via the PSC mailinglist.

We have to make a structured plan on how to use this machine.

First (tim wants to do) is fix the django-app running feeds, plugins
etc, en move it into an docker-container there.

Then.... (as said, we have to make a plan).

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

Good. It is a welcome move. Our current servers are a bit too overloaded.

Hetzner is a good company. I also have my servers at Hetzner. It is a
good price/value ratio and reliable. It is also good to know that the
data is stored in Germany, where they have better privacy protection and
no NSA/GCHQ access by default.

Hi


This is my first attemp with QGIS. I'm using 2.0 version.
My first goal is a proof of concept with a wms map and a vector map.
I started with the wms service. You'll find the code below, there are two
things that don't go well.

First, QgsApplication::applicationVersion() is "", Did I do something wrong in 

initialization ?


Second, my wms layer is not valid but maybe it is only because of the first question...



main.cpp
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
??? QgsApplication app(argc, argv, TRUE);
??? MainWindow w;
??? w.show();
??? 
??? return app.exec();
}



mainwindow.cpp

MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent) :
??? QMainWindow(parent),
??? ui(new Ui::MainWindow)
{
??? ui->setupUi(this);
??? QgsApplication::setPrefixPath("/usr/lib/qgis", false);
??? QgsApplication::initQgis();
??? qDebug()<<
 QgsApplication::applicationVersion();???? // <<------------------- return empty string

??? mapCanvas = new QgsMapCanvas(this);
??? mapCanvas->enableAntiAliasing(true);
??? mapCanvas->useImageToRender(false);
??? mapCanvas->setCanvasColor(QColor(255, 255, 255));
??? mapCanvas->freeze(false);
??? mapCanvas->setVisible(true);
??? mapCanvas->refresh();
??? mapCanvas->show();

??? QVBoxLayout* lyt = new QVBoxLayout(ui->centralWidget);
??? lyt->addWidget(mapCanvas);

??? QString uri = "crs=EPSG:4326&featureCount=10&format=image/gif&layers=osm_auto:all&styles=&url=http://129.206.228.72/cached/osm";
??? QgsRasterLayer* rlayer = new? QgsRasterLayer(uri, "test",
 "wms", true);
??? if (!rlayer->isValid()) qDebug() <<"invalid wms";?? // <<--------------------- It is invalid !

??? QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->addMapLayer(rlayer);

??? mapCanvas->layers().append(rlayer);
??? mapCanvas->zoomScale(1/10000);
??? mapCanvas->centerOn(5.7, 45.2);
??? mapCanvas->update();
}

Thanks for your help.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing Python Error on Startup
Message-ID: <1381082204859-5082070.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I have this error that keeps occuring and i've tried fixing it all afternoon
but with no luck and its slowly driving me crazy. I tried to change the r
scripts processing location to my r folder but after I changed those
settings in the processing options I cant load the processing plugin!
Somehow despite trying to delete every known qgis file and reinstalling
either with the installer or through osgeo4w it keeps trying to create a
folder in my R directory giving the error making me believe it somehow is
remember that location somehow? temp PATH maybe?

Couldn't load plugin processing due an error when calling its classFactory()
method
"C:/PROGRA~2/QGISDU~1/apps/qgis/./python/plugins\processing\core\ProcessingUtils.py",
line 97, in mkdir
    os.mkdir(newdir)
WindowsError: [Error 123] The filename, directory name, or volume label
syntax is incorrect: 'G:\\R-3.0.2\\scripts\r'

I don't even really need R can I somehow prevent processing from even
loading it?
Any help would be appreciated,
Cheers,
Bjorn

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New QGis project,

I don't know if you should receive "2.0" as output of applicationVersion()
method.

It's because setApplicationVersion() and setApplicationName() are called
from src/core/main.cpp (QGIS code).

The class QgsApplication don't call setter methods, so I don't know what
are the supposed behavior when I call these methods.

It works for me

QString uri= "url=
http://wms.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi&crs=EPSG:4326&format=image/jpeg&layers=global_mosaic&styles=pseudo
";
qDebug() << "uri" << uri;
QgsRasterLayer *rlayer = new QgsRasterLayer(uri, "layer_name", "wms",
false);
qDebug() << rlayer->isValid();


Hope it helps you

That is already fixed in master

The problem is related to a  \r character being added at the end of
the path string when retrieving its value from the configuration file,
which causes the mkdir method to fail.

Hope this helps

Hi all.
What are the plans for this?Are we going to backport and release a
fixed version?
This question concerns a few other fixed bugs, I believe.
All the best.

I have discussed with Tim the idea of releasing new versions of
Processing periodically, tagged as experimental, to the plugin repo.
Alex has prepared a script that packages and uploads the Processing
code, and that can be used to automate that, but we haven't done
anything yet regarding that. What do people think of this idea?

If a new QGIS release is made, the master version cntains quite a few
bug fixes for Processing.

Cheers

Hi,

I also think the best option is to provide updates of Processing in the plugin repo. Processing is still evolving and much bugfixing has been done and is done regularly. In my opinion, these fixes must be backported more regularly than the QGIS releases.


Best regards,
Pedro

As I mentioned in IRC chats I think this server is appropriate for
developer sandboxes, build machines, load balancing an other non
critical services. That way it can scale or move as necessary.

So in terms of the django,  I disagree with that being the priority to
move, it's actually running quite well now with added ram and builds
relocated. The biggest competition for resources is actually
Ruby/Passenger which last I looked was unoptimized the way mod_wsgi is.
I'll also note, that if we want to squeeze more performance out of
django we should be looking to move to uwsgi or gunicorn instead of
mod_wsgi.

In terms of docker I'm not 100% sold on the need for it outside the
context of this new server, as we can already dump an image of the
running server and move it to another service. Sure setting up scripted
deploy via puppet or chef makes sense, but that goes for the existing
config too nothing special about the vps container. I've also not seen
clear evidence that a vps container does anything more to balance
resources or keep apps in line on the same hardware. If docker is indeed
almost no overhead and divides resources then I'd be happy to put it on
the existing server to sandbox the parts on there.

Side note, I think the statement below in regards to a public non-profit
FOSS project is complete FUD. If people are keeping private or
confidential files on the servers, they shouldn't be. I encourage all
admins to use ssh key auth all the time, and we can in fact enforce that
on the current server too.

PS: Thanks for getting the hub logins to ssl.

Thanks,
Alex

I agree too. "Processing" is massive and to fully test it is going to take
while.

Also, considering the interest of the community and the number of new
features that are added or requested in the bug tracker/GIS Stackexchange
every day, I think scheduling frequent releases is the best way to keep
Processing evolving and maturing.

As always, I would like to thank Victor Olaya for bringing
Sextante/Processing to QGIS. It has greatly improved my GIS work and made
it a lot more enjoyable. I think sometime ago Camilo Polymeris said
something like "the more into Sextante, the more I like it". I feel the
same way about using it.

Regards

Hi Alex,

one reason to start with the django app, is that it seems broken on
current server because of (tim, please correct me if I'm wrong) some
gdal-python breakage (which... is needed for the user map app or so).

So instead of fixing this on current machine, it seemed a nice candidate
to do in a docker. To potentially being moved back to qgis1 later.
One argument for docker is that it is easier to fix this kind of
breakages (because separation of services), because the breakage then is
only in one service/container.

In Nottingham in a talk about Mapproxy (also python/wsgi) by Oliver
Tonnhofer he also promoted the use of gunicorn.... let's put it on our
todo list :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

That sounds like a plan.

If you want to upgrade Debian versions, thats an option or we can check
DebianGIS for a backport of newer gdal.

I setup the gunicorn for spatialreference.org (also on osgeo machines),
so let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Daniel


Thanks for your help.

I tried nasa server within my app without success, rlayer is still invalid.
I also tried within the QGis app, the server returned "this server no longer
provide full WMS services!"...

I also notice that my app starts immediatly, I'm not sure wether it should take
some seconds or not....

Anyway, I added some paths in my app (defaultsvg and plugins), and now my wms server is "Valid'.

But there's still nothing displayed in my map. Here's the current code regardings layers : 

? QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->addMapLayer(rlayer);

??? QList <QgsMapCanvasLayer> myLayerSet;
??? myLayerSet.append(QgsMapCanvasLayer(rlayer, TRUE));

???
 mapCanvas->setLayerSet(myLayerSet);
??? mapCanvas->zoomScale(1/10000);
??? mapCanvas->centerOn(5.7, 45.2);
??? mapCanvas->update();
??? mapCanvas->refresh();

I don't know if you should receive "2.0" as output of applicationVersion() method.

It's because setApplicationVersion() and setApplicationName() are called from src/core/main.cpp (QGIS code).

The class QgsApplication don't call setter methods, so I don't know what are the supposed behavior when I call these methods.

It works for me

QString uri= "url=http://wms.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi&crs=EPSG:4326&format=image/jpeg&layers=global_mosaic&styles=pseudo";
qDebug() << "uri" << uri;
QgsRasterLayer *rlayer = new QgsRasterLayer(uri, "layer_name", "wms", false);
qDebug() << rlayer->isValid();


Hope it helps you

Hi Alex,

I apologize for my, out of context, comment on "privacy" and "NSA". I
understand that OSGeo and our existing QGIS servers do not contain any
known backdoor for NSA & Co. It is just that we are quite uncomfortable
with the actions that the US/UK (and other European) governments are
undertaking in the disguise of "security".

We value the work and efforts you, Alex, OSGeo and others did for us.
Thanks a lot! Nevertheless, we had performance issues with the QGIS
servers, esp. for the Redmine instance (hub.qgis.org) - at least in the
country where I live. So I think it is quite useful to add additional
server resources to make the overall system more reliable.

Andreas

Dear All,
I'm converting a plugin with new API but I still doen't figure out how
to add attribute to feature.
I know it's a stupid question but i think the cookbook is till not
updated?

http://qgis.org/it/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/vector.html#add-features

I tried this code without success:

vl = QgsVectorLayer("Point?crs=epsg:4326", 'test', "memory")
pr = vl.dataProvider()                 
#~ add fields
pr.addAttributes( [QgsField('text', QVariant.String),QgsField('date',
QVariant.String)])
fields = vl.pendingFields()
feature = QgsFeature(fields)
feature[0] = 'some text'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: '0'


Below I attached the code I used in 1.8 


vl = QgsVectorLayer("Point?crs=epsg:4326", 'test', "memory")
pr = vl.dataProvider()                        
 #~ add fields
 pr.addAttributes( [QgsField('text', QVariant.String),QgsField('date',
QVariant.String)])                           
#~ add features point
for pointID in range(len(coordNotes)):
       fet = QgsFeature()
        xcoor=float(coordNotes[pointID][0])
        ycoor=float(coordNotes[pointID][1])
        fet.setGeometry( QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(xcoor,ycoor))) 
        #~ add attribute value
         fet.addAttribute(0, QVariant( dateNote[pointID][0] ))
         fet.addAttribute(1, QVariant( dateNote[pointID][1] ))
pr.addFeatures( [ fet ] )
#~ update vector layer    
vl.updateExtents()
vl.updateFieldMap()


Thanks
Pierluigi

Hi,

two weeks ago I've uploaded a plugin I've created for the Vorarlberger
Landesregierung:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/VoGisProfilTool/

It is not approved yet.
Could you tell me how long it normally takes to get a plugin approved, or
what is missing to get it approved?

Regards,
Wilhelm

Hi Wilhelm,

your plugin is approved now, I see that it is 1.8 only.

It just slipped throught the net of 'approvers'... sorry for that.

Richard,

thank you for your fast response.

Yes, it is 1.8 only.
It will be upgraded, when "Vorarlberger Landesregierung" moves to 2.0.

Hi List,
I have been creating a map with Annotation Text, see attached image.
I've been testing with Windows 7 64 bits, Ubuntu 12 and QGIS 2.01 and QGIS

In all cases the top buttons do not work

Font, size, Bold, Italic, Color not work.

It is a known bug?

Hello, 

I set up a mapserver server on my machine.

I access it thru QGis and QGis API.
It seems that, thru QGis API, it ignores the axis orientation leading to a wrong map.

I found IgnoreAxisOrientation member in QGis code ; Is there a way to access it thru the api ?

Thanks

That error currently occurs during startup ..
Though I have to say that I don't know what part it would probably
affect .. everything on my computer works normal.

So for now this seems to be a "cosmetic" error in the 64bit version..

Just try your normal workflow and report possible errors.. The 64bit
Version is quite new ..

kind regards
Werner

The problem has been solved by Jurgen in the osgeo4w installer and
once an updated standalone installer will be created the error will go
away there too (it should be related to intel drivers/applications).

cheers!

Hi all,

I don't if you have noticed but a new contributor has submitted a patch

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/922

that seems to improve the vector rendering speed up to 90% ->
http://hub.qgis.org/attachments/6318/test_data_qgis_master_RenderingStatsQGIS__Feature-8725.zip

I would really appreciate if one of the core devs can review it and
eventually commit it (or suggest modifications), so we can start test
it as this would be a much needed improvement.

Cheers!

Thanks Alessando,
It was what I was looking for.

My error was I didn't updated fields using:
vectorlayer.updateFields()

Why it is necessary to call it when a field is added into provider?

Thanks

	legend tree
Message-ID: <a50f80e64031e9efce5d0db0e76071e0@carto.net>

 Hi,

 In my python script I would like to append a filtered Postgis layer 
 into a group with a given name.

 This works fine as long as the user did not activate a group already 
 interactively. If a group is already active, my method to find the 
 groupIndex fails. If not group is active, the script works fine.

 Here is my method:

 ---------------

 Is there a more reliable way to find the groupIndex if the user 
 selected a group already?

 Maybe there is some interference with the setting "New layers should be 
 added to chosen or current group" setting in "Settings" --> "Options" 
 --> "Map & Legend" --> "Layerlegend"?

 Thanks,

Hi Andreas,

this is how I do it:

def getGroupIndex(self,  groupName):
     '''Find the index for group groupName'''
     retValue = -1
     groups = self.iface.legendInterface().groups()

     for i in range(len(groups)):
         if groups[i] == groupName:
             retValue = i
             break

     return retValue

def moveToGroup(self, layer, groupName):
     '''move layer into a group'''

     grpIdx = self.getGroupIndex(groupName)

     if grpIdx == -1:
        # add the group
        grpIdx = self.iface.legendInterface().addGroup(groupName)

     self.iface.legendInterface().moveLayer(layer,  grpIdx)

Hi,

Thank you Bernhard. This works better than my code with the
legend.groupLayerRelationship()

We should add this to the Python Cookbook
(http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/) - Do you mind?
Or should I do a pull request?

Do you have a clever strategy to make this same code available in
multiple QGIS plugins?

But really this should go into the core QGIS API. It is annoying taking
care of such things.

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using PDB for debuggin on Windows
Message-ID: <CALPrXdrEu_vEpykLn79RUdiOMF6EOx0G0td7XLPdT3PbXzw5Xg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm working on the "Debugging" chapter for the PyQGIS book[1] and have a
question.

Is there a way to use pdb to debug a plugin on Windows? It works on OS X
and Linux, but seems to have issues on Windows, likely related to not being
able to connect to the terminal that QGIS was started from. I'm not worried
about remote debugging using IDE's and Winpdb---I have those covered.

Thanks,

-gary

I have no idea how to contribute to the cookbook. So please go ahead.

All plugins that I create for my users are subclassing a class that 
provides this kind of functionality for all of them.

Hi,

I am not sure we should make any publicity to the legend API which is 
very bad.

I hope these methods will deprecated soon ;)

So is there anyone working on fixing these legend API problems?

We should probably come up with a Wiki page where we could collect ideas
what we would expect from a proper legend API.

I'm new to QGIS plug-in developemtn and I'm setting up a development 
environment on Mac OS X.

At the moment I'm going with PyCharm and got the remote debugging to 
work. Thanks to this list!

One thing I can't get to work is code completion for the PyQGIS API.

I've added '/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/Resources/python/qgis/' and 
'/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/Resources/python/' to the interpreter's 
path. PyCharm can find PyQGIS and ads it to the external libraries. This 
way I can import the qgis modules without errors, in the Python console 
for example.
However, code completion doesn't work in the editor nor in the console.

Thanks in advance for your help,
Jorge

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS and checking WMS layers have data
Message-ID: <FA49BFC197A78E4D8E7F1200278E5F5565B7DAA9@fmexch2.fylkesmannen.local>

Hi all,

I have a loop in my code that makes PDFs for a number of polygons and the base mapping comes from an aerial photography WMS. So for each polygon, the python code moves the map to the extent of that polygon and the makes a PDF.

However, some of my maps end up with white backgrounds where the aerial photography hasn't loaded/displayed.

Is it possible to make sure that a WMS has loaded its data before a PDF is made in python? Or does the problem lie with the network connection at the time that PDF is made? Is there any way I can catch these instances and maybe load the WMS again?

The last time I ran the script, of the 1465 PDFs it created, about 21 had a white base map, so generally it works really really well. I have checked that there is actually data for these 21 areas, and there is. It also seems to be different areas that do not load each time I run the script.

Many thanks

James

Welcome to developing with QGIS. PyCharm is an excellent choice for IDE,
especially now that 3.0 has a free community version and more support for
PyQt.

You only need the '/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/Resources/python' path
added (assuming you are using a Kyngchaos.com QGIS install), so I recommend
removing the other path . However, I have noticed that sometimes PyCharm on
Mac does not properly rebuild the 'skeletons' for code completion (I'm
using PyCharm 2.7.3). Try relaunching the app and removing/re-adding the
path, then clicking the reload button. You should see a progress bar and
eventually notice the qgis.* modules being parsed. If not there may be an
issue.

For plugin development, I add external commands, several of which are for
running my plugin's Makefile [0]. While the new PyCharm 3.0 has an embedded
terminal, I find assigning a key shortcut (say Ctrl-M) to the make <prompt>
command to be very quick for deploying the plugin to
~/.qgis2/python/plugins/. Deploying is the best-practice means of testing
your plugin, instead of symlinking it, but that also works.

Also, I recommend using the Plugin Reloader PyQGIS plugin to reload your
plugin within QGIS, so you do not have to relaunch QGIS every time you
propagate a change in your plugin.

Hi all.
When running a GRASS command through Processing, the import creates a
"cat" column. If the same layer is used as input for another GRASS
commend, the cat column is renamed as cat_, and a new cat column is
created. If this second layer is used once more as input, the renaming
of cat in cat_ fails, because the column already exists. Following
analyses may fail.
Did I interpret it correctly? Should I open a ticket?
All the best.

we did a little face to face meeting in Brighton with Martin D. and Marco
H... QgsLegend classes need a refactory due to structural limitation.

Marco H. did an estimation of the refactoring, but probably, as I can see
there are more that need this refactoring, could be interesting collect
features that this re-write should involve....
....and obviously funding :)

Hi Luigi,

Do you have a written proposal already? Is it available on Google Docs
so we can comment/append?

Personally, I am also interested in enhancing group options in the layer
tree. Groups are not just stupid containers with only toggling of
visibility. They could also have a group opacity and blending and group
metadata. Later on we may also have clipping and masking on groups. So
we really should have an extensible mechanism for groups as new group
features appear.

Yes, if we have a written proposal we will have more organization that
may help to fund this effort.

Andreas

One thing I'd love to see is the ability to make the layers in a group
"mutually exclusive". (ie, imagine radio buttons instead of checkboxes for
controlling the visibility of layers within that group). I find I'm often
going through a process of switching one layer on, then switching a bunch
of other layers off for comparison purposes. A mutually exclusive layer
group which automatically switched the other child layers off when I select
a layer would make this process much nicer!

no, not yet,

I found structural limitation looking for adding customized legends (aka
items)... I waited Brighton to check if it was a problem related to my
"ignorance" or a structural one.

I hadn't time to find what's the "procedure" to add a RFC in qgis with it's
workflow (in mapserver is clear, I can learn the procedure reading ML)

let me organize ideas and procedural proposal... or if it's more clear to
you, please start it and I'll contribute as soon as I can... or, in the
meantime, we can continue with this thread.

Andreas, thank you to open this thread

Hello,

Check out the layer combinations plugin. It's really cool which let's you create combinations of layer states to turn on and off.

Would be great to add this as a core feature.

Thanks for the suggestion.

I have taken a slightly different approach, and I am checking the file size of my PDFs using the following:

os.path.getsize(file)

There is an obvious difference between the file sizes of the PDFs where the wms loaded, and those where it failed. If the pdf is too small, it tries to create it again. Hopefully it won't get stuck in a loop where if it fails once it will always fail!!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] texi2pdf and pdf manuals
Message-ID: <52568DF8.3040405@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

who is familiar with the texi2pdf stuff we used for the generation of
the pdf manuals?

Please have a look (or try out) this Makefile:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/Makefile

it is more or less copied/makiefied from

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/scripts-old/post_translate.sh

after the latex build we use texi2pdf to generate the pdf's

I could not make it work via the pushd popd stuff like in the script, so
try to use some texi2pdf parameters:

--build-dir=$(BUILDDIR)/latex/$(LANG)/

so it is build in the output/latex/xx/ directory.
After that I copy it to the 'live' directory (which is being served via
apache)

While (most languages) working on my machine, it is failing on the server.
Two problems:
- I see this msg: egrep: Invalid range end which is not seen on my machine
- on my machine the pdf is found in:
output/latex/xx/QGISUserGuide.t2d/pdf/build/QGISUserGuide.pdf but on the
server it ends up in a dir with a dot and exclamation marks:
output/latex/xx/.!QGISUserGuide.t2d/pdf/build/QGISUserGuide.pdf

So Questions:
- can somebody please test if you have the server problems too
- can somebody please help me to fix this (otherwise: no pdf's :-( )

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps: there are currently a lot of errors in the documentation builds....

I guess instead that much better should be a group checkbox that 
enable/disable the under childs layer.

This allow OFF the actual configuration or ON that same configuration.
Actually the group checkbox when checked put ON all the layer.
This often is mean too much information .

Instead the mutual exclusive need to choose only one.
And in that case disable and ri-enable will reput the same original clayer.

Hi all,

I have noticed that there are still issues when installing plugins on
Windows machines and when the username has an accented letter.
 A few plugins do not install and when they install then they do not
show in the "installed" list, and so the user can't remove/disable
them.

Anyone confirms?

cheers

Hi, nightly builds are available since more than a year, at android.qgis.org

I've now a much smaller package that would fit in the play store (see 
following mail). I still have some crash but it doesn't look too bad.

ciao Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] test new android package
Message-ID: <5256DC0A.4070908@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi all, I've been working on creating an android packae that is smaller 
than 50mb to fit the playstore.
the pakage now includes only a small subset of the needed libs, all 
other libs are downloaded on the first run by ministro.

all in all you will be downloding about 30mb for the apk plus 200mb 
dependencies plus 40mb qt, so do it on a wifi, i know it got bigger 
(used to be 150mb apk), but the adventage is that now qgis is small 
enough for the market (thus update notification will be available) and 
for each update you will have to rownload only what actually changed.

To achieve this, I created a reporitory at 
http://android.qgis.org/repository/ that can actually be used by any 
android qt app that needs any of the available libs.

so please, help me test this package and just report if the installation 
worked and you could start QGIS.

thanks a lot Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] how to add labels to PluginLayer?
Message-ID: <52571FEE.7080702@mail.geometrics.com>

Hi,

I am trying to add labels to the plugin  layer. What I use in draw()
is:

  fields = QgsFields()
  fields.append(QgsField('0', QtCore.QVariant.String, 'string', 32))
  fields.append(QgsField('8', QtCore.QVariant.Double, 'double', 8))
  fields.append(QgsField('9', QtCore.QVariant.Double, 'double', 8))

  feat =  QgsFeature(fields)
  label = QgsLabel(fields)
  feat.setAttribute('0','Test Text')
  feat.setAttribute('8', -8.66774)
  feat.setAttribute('9', 37.08391)

  label.renderLabel(renderContext, feat, False)

- QGIS crashes (2.0.1, stock version, Linux)

There is almost no doc on how to add labels to the layer
I am trying to mimic field 'Text' 'XCoordinate' and 'YCoordinate'
with '0', '8' and '9' based on enum LabelField

Apparently also some change in the Api since 1.8, I was
using GridPlugin from 1.8 as example, but something is different now.

Could anyone shed some light on it?

I am actually developing Lat/Lon grid plugin for QGIS, which I think
very much needed.

Thank you
Mikhail

Hi all.
The Google Summer of Code should be finished by now. Maybe I missed
something, but I did not see any public result of it.
Would it be possible to have access to it? I think it would be a great
improvement in our infrastructure and functionality.
Thanking you in advance.
All the best.

Tried on a Nexus 10 tablet, install worked OK. Only 'issue' is cosmetic;
after the message that I need to install the 'necessitas' runtime, I'm
redirected to the play store. When I return from that, I get the message
(in qgis) 'necessitas not found' and I need to restart to resume the in-app
installation procedure to continue.

Apart from that, is this meant to be more than a proof of concept /
pre-alpha? Does it make sense for me to report bugs yet?

cheers,

roel

yes go ahead, this is ment to become the main way of installing 
releases. Nightly builds will keep on using the old installer

The group checkbox, imho, should *not always* switch children on/off. You should have a modifier to get this as a secondary behavior, like pressing the ctrl key when (un)checking the group checkbox. The primary behavior of the group switch should be to make the children invisible or visible, regardless of the children's visibility being on or off.

In the primary behavior when the parent is turned OFF, the children are not drawn but retain their checked or uncheck status.
If you use the secondary behavior then unchecking the parent will uncheck the children. Same would apply when checking the parent on.

I guess instead that much better should be a group checkbox that enable/disable the under childs layer.

This allow OFF the actual configuration or ON that same configuration.
Actually the group checkbox when checked put ON all the layer.
This often is mean too much information .

Instead the mutual exclusive need to choose only one.
And in that case disable and ri-enable will reput the same original clayer.

One thing I'd love to see is the ability to make the layers in a group "mutually exclusive". (ie, imagine radio buttons instead of checkboxes for controlling the visibility of layers within that group). I find I'm often going through a process of switching one layer on, then switching a bunch of other layers off for comparison purposes. A mutually exclusive layer group which automatically switched the other child layers off when I select a layer would make this process much nicer!

+1 for this feature from a frequent user!

Best,

Agreed, sounds like a sensible behavior to me.

Yes, a sensible behavior.

But there is still use-case for the radio-button like behaviour. Imagine
having a group with a series of orthoimages of different years and you
quickly want to see each year. In this case, the radio-button behaviour
would save you one click. So I don't think that this contradicts the
other proposal listed above here.

The problem I see is that we have layers visible in the canvas that are 
unchecked, because their group is checked. Maybe an unchecked layer 
should show a partly checked state in that case.

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail//qgis-user/2013-January/020842.html

Is there a solution ?

Regards,

Beno?t

No no, I don't think so. The only way for layers to be visible in the canvas
would be for both them and all their ancestor groups to be checked.
That's my understanding of the suggested behavior.

So if there's a problem of sync between checked status of a layer
and its visibility on the canvas is the contrary one: a layer can
be checked _but_ not visible because any of its ancestors are unchecked.

A "partially checked" kind of visual feedback could be useful for
those cases: whenever a group is unchecked, all checked discendent
become "half-checked" and you can only switch between unchecked
and half-checked by acting on a single layer in that state.

Maybe this could be obtained with secondary behavior (SHIFT-click) on layers,
but it sounds like something that easily becomes confusing (conflicting
with radio-on-groups, undefined behavior for unchecking etc.).

Hi,
just a thought, what about different "Group Styles/behavior" ?
- "default classic Layer Group"
- RadioButton exclusive group
- etc...

This is the opposite from what I described. I think of the user 
experience. We would have these two cases:
1) Group is checked and although layer is unchecked it is visible
2) Group is unchecked and although layer is checked it is not visible

We could use the partial check for both cases indicating to the user 
that the layer visibility is overridden by the group visibility.

Are you saying you _want_ this to be possible ?
Because for me an unchecked layer should _never_ be shown.

This is a possible case, IMHO, which calls for the "half-checked" widget.

I understand this in the way I wrote in my last message. You would make 
the children visible/unvisible "regardless of the children's visibility 
being on or off". This results in the two cases I described.
Well, to be honest there are two more cases, but they are not critical :-)
3) group is checked and layer ist checked
4) group is unchecked and layer is uncheched

Why not? You check/uncheck a group and the layers are visible/invisible 
depending on the group status not their individual status.

Same for me, _plus_ a checked layer should _always_ be shown

Indeed that wording was a bit confusing to me.
If you confirm you meant that a layer could be visible on canvas
without it being set to "visible" then I disagree about that.

The way I see it is in that case you'd SHIFT-click thus changing
the visibility state of every child layer, loosing the original
visibility state of them.

Fine by me, as long as we have an "half-checked" state for
the case in which c layer is set to visible but any ancestor
makes it invisible.

switching between several raster layers is exactly the main (only) use I 
have for this, and as we are mainly doing remote sensing stuff here, 
including lots of time series, it is something I really frequently miss. 
(Practical example: you have several Landsat rasters from different 
times for the same area, all of them have clouds but not in the same 
place. By switching between layers, you can easily get a 'cloudfree' 
view of the entire area.)

IMHO 'undefined behavior for unchecking' should not be a problem; 
usually unchecking simply is disabled for radio groups. I do not know 
any UI with radio groups where you can uncheck a selected item by 
clicking it again... I think having it as a secondary behaviour is just 
confusing. I'd rather see groups have a 'selection type' property, which 
defines the selection behaviour within that group (and on that level 
only). Could you explain what you mean with 'conflicting with 
radio-on-groups' (what are 'radio-on-groups')?

No no, I don't think so. The only way for layers to be visible in the canvas would be for both them and all their ancestor groups to be checked.
That's my understanding of the suggested behavior.

So if there's a problem of sync between checked status of a layer and its visibility on the canvas is the contrary one: a layer can be checked _but_ not visible because any of its ancestors are unchecked.

A "partially checked" kind of visual feedback could be useful for those cases: whenever a group is unchecked, all checked discendent become "half-checked" and you can only switch between unchecked and half-checked by acting on a single layer in that state.

By 'radio-on-groups' I meant using radio behavior on groups rather
than on layers. Having "selection type" as a parameter of a group
solves the complexity problem I had in mind.

An unchecked layer is never visible... that would really confuse users...

I understand this in the way I wrote in my last message. You would make the children visible/unvisible "regardless of the children's visibility being on or off". This results in the two cases I described.
Well, to be honest there are two more cases, but they are not critical :-)
3) group is checked and layer ist checked
4) group is unchecked and layer is uncheched

Why not? You check/uncheck a group and the layers are visible/invisible depending on the group status not their individual status.

Same for me, _plus_ a checked layer should _always_ be shown

+ 1 for not having an unchecked layer non visible, even if the group is not
checked -> this will confuse users
For radio-like interaction, I think it would be nice inside a group. If you
want to use it for layers outside a group or for group, we should really
find a way to make the "radio" items visible (background color for selected
layers or groups with radio behaviour ?).
It would indeed be great to let the user choose 2 to n layers (or groups) ,
right-click and set "radio button behaviour" or "exclusive visibility".

I'm having an hard time understanding statements in this thread.
Are you saying you agree that about this ?

 An unchecked layer should never be visible

This is even more confusing %-|
Triple negation ? Could you please rephrase ?

PS: we highjacked a thread about reliable way to identify a group,
    may be better to start two new threads, one for group visibility
    behavior and another for radio vs. checkbox configuration

Ok, sorry ;)

If a layer is unchecked it is not drawn in the map.

If a layer is checked but its parent is not, it is not drawn in the map.

This is even more confusing %-|
Triple negation ? Could you please rephrase ?

PS: we highjacked a thread about reliable way to identify a group,
    may be better to start two new threads, one for group visibility
    behavior and another for radio vs. checkbox configuration

I have made the Loop Visible Layers plugin for just that. Add the reaster
layers you want to see in a group, then select that group in the Loop
Visible Layers dock and click play. You will see those raster layers one at
a time.

To make it easier, maybe we should refer to the two different methods as
"AND"/"OR". Ie, a layer is displayed only if it's ticked AND all it's
parent groups are ticked, as opposite to a layer is displayed if it's
ticked OR any of its parent groups are ticked.

For me, it's a +1 for the AND behaviour.

I'm reading this thread in a too fast way so probably I'll miss something

we can distinguish two topics in this thread

1) api re-design... but I think is a Architecture re-design of the
QgsLegend component
2) Enhancement of the Legend interface.

Thread 1) more technical, at this moment is still not approached
Thread 2) is focused (as I understood) on adding a new type of ItemGroup
that would manage a mutual/exclusive selection (radio button mode selection
inside the group)
Thread 3) please add topic of this thread if I missed it.

I can say something about Thread 1) that is related with Thread 2).
Sorry if I make mistakes on this my analysis, I tried to the do the best I
can and I'm here to learn :)
At this moment QgsLegend doesn't use a clear MVC pattern (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). This
is (probabily) the main problem to expand it's features. I'm not sure about
group managing because I didn't focus on this feature, but I'm quite sure
that Item customization limits are extended to groups too.
QgsLegend is based on QTreeView that has all features to allow a full
customization of it's items (a group is a kind of item).
The main problem at this moment is that rendering of an item is not
delegated to each item but it's spread in different classes that create an
abstraction of the different kind of items.
I found this limitations looking for a solution to show WMS legends in
legend interface.
I my different way to find a solution to this new feature I also tried to
add a "delegation"approach (just to try if it was feasible) but I wasn't
able to have a complete control of the item rendering... this is seems be
related with not so clear (to me) path of emitted signal inside this
hierarchy of classes.

So my conclusion are
1) move all rendering action custom item delegates
2) clean or clarify signals emitted and inter-relation with the classes of
the legend ecosystem.
3) this is a "new" point... I think that to allow developing new feature
it's necessary create and abstraction of the data returned by
layer->legendSymbologyItems() because returning a QList< QPair< QString,
QColor > > is a really a big limitation to customization (for example I
can't ask to the layer to return a pixmap that is the legend for a WMS
layer)

Why thread 1) is related with Tread 2)? because if I've a clear Item
delegation I can add a new group item that manage it's rendering and
behavior basing on it's own characteristic.

I hope to hear from who's more "inside" qgis architecture to find the
"correct" direction.

thank you, Luigi Pirelli (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it)

Hi all,

Looks to me like something has stopped planet.qgis.org from fetching new
posts. There's been a number of posts on the linked blogs recently which
aren't showing up in the planet feed. Who should I contact to take a look
at this?

Cheers,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS crash sometimes damages project file
Message-ID: <525BAF18.90502@carto.net>

Hi,

I had it now the second time that a crashing QGIS would damage a project
file. Unfortunately it wasn't myself, but co-workers of me and I did not
exactly see what they did.

According to the users they did not even save the project, just QGIS
crashed and destroyed the .qgs file. Can this really happen?

I examined the .qgs-File after the crash, the file was still
well-formed, but the <legend/> element was empty, all the print
composers disappeared and several map layers were missing.

Is this a known-issue?

For now, I set the project-file to "read-only" to avoid such problems so
that only I as the administrator can modify the file, but it is not the
best solution ...

-----
>From my wife I also heard that some of her students had this issue of
broken .qgs files after QGIS crashes. So at least this is not only in
our office.
-----

I am really sorry that I cannot provide more details now. Just want to
see if others have similar issues and if there are solutions.

Etienne,

I was not opposing your idea. Just proposing a default behavior for the group/children visibility pattern.

I sometimes do have need for your use case. Maybe there could be an option in the context menu when right-clicking a layer - eg "Mutually exclusive layers". A popup window could appear that allows you to select the 2 "opposing" collections of layers, and then these could appear with a radio button in the maplegend.

The group checkbox, imho, should *not always* switch children on/off. You should have a modifier to get this as a secondary behavior, like pressing the ctrl key when (un)checking the group checkbox. The primary behavior of the group switch should be to make the children invisible or visible, regardless of the children's visibility being on or off.

In the primary behavior when the parent is turned OFF, the children are not drawn but retain their checked or uncheck status.
If you use the secondary behavior then unchecking the parent will uncheck the children. Same would apply when checking the parent on.

Agreed, sounds like a sensible behavior to me.

Yes, a sensible behavior.

But there is still use-case for the radio-button like behaviour. Imagine
having a group with a series of orthoimages of different years and you
quickly want to see each year. In this case, the radio-button behaviour
would save you one click. So I don't think that this contradicts the
other proposal listed above here.

Maybe this could be obtained with secondary behavior (SHIFT-click) on layers,
but it sounds like something that easily becomes confusing (conflicting
with radio-on-groups, undefined behavior for unchecking etc.).

switching between several raster layers is exactly the main (only) use I have for this, and as we are mainly doing remote sensing stuff here, including lots of time series, it is something I really frequently miss. (Practical example: you have several Landsat rasters from different times for the same area, all of them have clouds but not in the same place. By switching between layers, you can easily get a 'cloudfree' view of the entire area.)

I have made the Loop Visible Layers plugin for just that. Add the reaster layers you want to see in a group, then select that group in the Loop Visible Layers dock and click play. You will see those raster layers one at a time.

IMHO 'undefined behavior for unchecking' should not be a problem; usually unchecking simply is disabled for radio groups. I do not know any UI with radio groups where you can uncheck a selected item by clicking it again... I think having it as a secondary behaviour is just confusing. I'd rather see groups have a 'selection type' property, which defines the selection behaviour within that group (and on that level only). Could you explain what you mean with 'conflicting with radio-on-groups' (what are 'radio-on-groups')?


Vincent.

Hi all.
I understood that an osgeo standalone package for 2.0.1-3 was underway: am I wrong?
In case not, when could we expect it?
Also, in Debian unstable, installation fails because it requires a grass642 package,
which is not available.
Any hint on how to solve this?
Thanks.

Hi,
I tested the pgRouting Layer plugin in qgis 1.8 and found out it doesnt work
with pgRouting 2.0 functions.
I found https://github.com/sanak/pgRoutingLayer/ to be more feature
rich(has more shortest path functions)
and would suggest to the plugin owner to update it with @sanak's commits.

BTW, installing it anyway results in:

Hi Oware,
I've merged Sanak's pull request now. I haven't tested it yet but it  
sounds like you are running it successfully. The plugin metadata needs  
some more love before the plugin can be uploaded to the repository. Any  
contributions welcome.
Best wishes,
Anita

Hi all.
I think time is now ripe for a better integration of Processing:
* integrating the excellent tutorial https://github.com/volaya/sextante-manual into
the main documentation
* publishing an upgraded version (several smaller and bigger fixes have been done,
it's a pity not to let users enjoy them.
Any short term plans for this? I'm available for help if necessary.
All the best.

I plan to integrate that into the training manual, probably along this
week (I'm glad that you like the Processing tutorial... :-) )

Alex wrote a script that builds the resource files, cretaes the zip
file and uploads to the plugin server automatically. We would like to
have that done automatically daily or weekly, to create regular
versions tagged as a experimental, but I want to hear the opinion of
the community about this, to find if there is consensus and most
people think that it is a good idea I have a few minor bug fixes
almost ready to be commited, and once this is done (most likely along
this week), I also want to upload a new stable version.

Opinions on the best way to do this are welcome

Thanks!

fine, obviously +1 for me - ready to give feedback from "out in the wild"

BTW, people in Gibraltar at a conference were rather astonished by QGIS in general,
and Processing in particular.

> Opinions on the best way to do this are welcome

+1 for me. I'd suggest to have the usual Debian strategy: publish in experimental,
and if no bad bugs are reported for, say, 2 weeks, move that version to stable.

Thanks.

Hi,
I used the plugin to visualize query results in the pgRouting workshop
http://workshop.pgrouting.org/index.html
The metadata.txt seems ok except for the homepage, tracker and repository
attributes.

IMHO the processing chapter in the qgis manual has to be a little bit 
updated and integrated.
But I'd add the "complete" manual of processing in the documentation 
page like the "an introduction to gis" or the "python cookbook".
And add in the qgis processing chapter a link to the complete manual.

Cheers

Matteo

Hi,

Apparently no one is to help me... I found it is not simply possible to put
labels at where I want on the plugin layer. Apparently no one is using 
QGsLabel
anymore, and documentation is missing or obscure...

Qgis keeps crashing on me when I try to add label in python, which I 
believe is a bug
anyway.

+1 Personally I would prefer to have daily versions. It is highly
motivating for users and testers to report a bug and to have Processing
fixed and available in the next day. I would not mind to have to use an
external software to get the most recent code (e.g. Tortois svn or
equivalent).

It appeared that I made it work. It might be not the best way,but it works.
It also might get outdated as new labeling engine being developed.

1. In the __init__ I add:

        self.fields = QgsFields()
        self.label = QgsLabel(self.fields)

Not sure I need to keep object "QgsLabel" but I do.
Also self.fields are actually not used,  this is just requirement
for "QgsLabel"constructor


2. In the function to draw label:

    # again, "fields" has nothing inside

fields = QgsFields()
    feat = QgsFeature(fields)


# init number of attributes with the same number of fields
# as enum LabelFields in the QgsLabel class
# this is just for convenience and is not very nice

    feat.initAttributes(QgsLabel.LabelFieldCount)

# set feature geometry as a point. Here x,y is position of the label

feat.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QGpsPoint(x,y)))

# now we have two options to set label options: or we use
# label itself or we use feature "feat" It is better to use label itself
# for font, color etc if we draw bunch of labels. Here is how can be done:
# ( example from my dialog)

self.label.labelAttributes().setFamily(self.dlg.label_attributes.family())
self.label.labelAttributes().setBold(self.dlg.label_attributes.bold())
self.label.labelAttributes().setItalic(self.dlg.label_attributes.italic())
self.label.labelAttributes().setUnderline(self.dlg.label_attributes.underline())
self.label.labelAttributes().setStrikeOut(self.dlg.label_attributes.strikeOut())
self.label.labelAttributes().setSize(self.dlg.label_attributes.size(), 
core.QgsLabelAttributes.PointUnits)
self.label.labelAttributes().setColor(QtGui.QColor.fromRgba(self.dlg.label_attributes.color().rgba()))

# the rest of the attribute we set using feature "feat"
# note that above call feat.initAttributes(QgsLabel.LabelFieldCount)is
# essential for to allow setting these attributes as below


     feat.setAttribute(QgsLabel.Angle,90.)
     feat.setAttribute(QgsLabel.Alignment, 'right')

# etc.  Noe that now we need to tell QgsLabel where to search for the 
attributes.
#  Because we created the same number of feature attributes as size of 
enum LabelField
# we can tell it this way:

     self.label.setLabelField(QgsLabel.Text,QgsLabel.Text)
self.label.setLabelField(QgsLabel.Angle,QgsLabel.Angle)
self.label.setLabelField(QgsLabel.Alignment,QgsLabel.Alignment)

# Note that first and second argument is the same but this is only
# because number of feature attributes was set the same as LabelField size.
# many of the attributes this way remain unset.
# note that you also can specify font, color etc using 
self.label.setLabelField()

# finally draw the labels. I used function drawLabels(self, renderContext)
# Just add:

     self.label.renderLabel(renderContext, feat, False)


Best Regards,
Mikhail

You can grab Processing code from GitHub and just copy it to your
QGIS installation. It should work.

Packaging needed for peoples, that don't know about git and github, but
want to test (or in most cases simply use) latest Processing.

Thank you very much. I does work. I had thought about that but was afraid
it could ruin my installation. I wish I knew that before!

Hi Richard,

as you can see in my image, I have not edit in my VTerrain plugin.
Instead, I have editing on my GEarthView ...

Misterious...

How can I reset the password for VTerrain ?

There is some other way to solve it ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis : synchronized view for photo-interpretation?
Message-ID: <1381832850069-5083658.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

We have to do a photo-interpretation project. We have to display
simultaneously TWO data : one raster raw data (to capture vector features
from) + another raster data to assist in the interpretation. So we would
like divide classic qgis interface into 2 views. Indeed we would like
display these 2 raster data thanks to a synchronized view.

Displaying view left : raw data. Displaying view right : assist reference

Is it possible to do that with qgis? If not is it possible to do that with
another soft or application?

In advance, thank you to throw light for me.

Regards.

 getLegendGraphic in legend and composer
Message-ID: <CAFO80_pkop5YmNmXTH6hCS1QOCHkK_EYyomc9mffO-utxiZ_zA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I just pulled some requests related to features presented in Brighton and
Developed with funding from Regione Toscana-SITA

A) WMS Tile Retry - This feature that reduce problems due to fail on
download single tiles

B) WMS getLegendGraphic adding api in provider to get the getLegendGraphic
pixmap

C) WMS legend in Legend Interface as popup. This allow visualization of
getLegendGraphic pixmap in legend interface using popup (cause to
architectural limitation)
Legend reload is linked to scale modification and in the future also to
extent to use new mapserer feature that customize legend basing on viewport

D) WMS legend in Composer to show the legend in composer. This feature add
a configurable resolution parameter to set legend pixmap resolution to
allow a good print quality.

I tired to be more modular as possible...

Pull request A is independent
Pull requests from B to D are hierarchically linked

please let me know for every doubt or suggestion

thank you

Hi Alexander,

This works, except for LecoS and Semi-Automatic Classification plugins, but I think it is problem of own plugins: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8792

This is 3rd party plugins, so this is not a Processing issue at all

Ok Alexander, thanks!

I also just found this error when I click [...] in a field InputNumber, on a model that was created earlier. I think that in the last days, was discussed anything about this kind of fields. There was a change in Processing that causes this error on older models, or an error is now present?


An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
? File "C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/./python/plugins\processing\gui\NumberInputPanel.py", line 56, in showNumberInputDialog
??? dlg = NumberInputDialog(self.isInteger)
? File "C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/./python/plugins\processing\gui\NumberInputDialog.py", line 54, in __init__
??? self.lblWarning.hide()
AttributeError: 'NumberInputDialog' object has no attribute 'lblWarning'

Python version:
2.7.4 (default, Apr? 6 2013, 19:54:46) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)]

QGIS version:
2.0.1-Dufour Dufour, 34139bc


Thanks!

Best regards,

Somebody has tested it recently ?

Dear all,

Since QGIS was at 1.8 version I used a plugin very useful for me but now
the same is to updated to the 2.0 version.
I write to the developer asking for un update for version 2.0 and
telling him I'm are available to the the necessary work to do that.
Unfortunately I didn?t receive any reply from him.

What you suggest to do?
I can update the code but then I cannot distribuite the code as I'm not
the developer?

Let me know
thanks

Hi Jurgen,

things are pretty much ok now in the latest master. Thanks!

the only plugin that fails to install is the OpenLayers one that gives a

"the plugin is broken. Python said: ascii"

message, followed by

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in
  File "C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis-dev/./python\pyplugin_installer\installer.py",
line 339, in installPlugin
    pluginDir = qgis.utils.home_python_pluginpath + "/" + plugin["id"]
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'home_python_pluginpath'


message.


But maybe this is a plugin issue.


cheers!

My opinion:

I do not know which plugin you need, but I would be very carefull to
pull somebodies plugin out of his/her hands.

I think it is to the developer to decide what priorities he takes by
doing his work. We cannot force somebody to update it, if he is busy
with something else. (or just missing the email in which somebody asks
for that)

If the plugin is on github, I would start with forking the repo, and
upgrading the plugin as needed and do a pull request.
This way YOU have a working plugin :-)

Then maybe ask via this list if the developer is around, or if somebody
knows this developer personally, and try to contact him again (or via
the person who knows him).

Maybe offer a little gift? Some nice words? A beer somewhere on the
world? Offer to do it (patches, pull requests)?

If all fails, there are two options:
- we can my you manager of the plugin (but as said, as a project I think
we should be really carefull with this. Maybe even only if the
plugin-owner has given permission for this)
- you can rename the plugin and upload it with another name?

>From my own experience, I can tell several reasons to not upgrade
immediatly:
- I'm in the middle of some refactoring and are planning to do the
upgrade and new functionality in one version
- I just do not have time for this, at THIS moment (meaning: other
things in life have prio now)...

In short: please be gentle to a plugin dev. He invested his free time
into the developing the initial version(s) of the plugin.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hello,

somebody knows if it just exists a plugin that select all elements (of one
or more layers) contained in the QGis view ?

I need something similar to the "Show elements visible in the map" button
of the Attributes table, but selecting the elements.


Thank you for any info about this

Hi,

the setHTMLPage method wants a file name of an HTML as argument.

So I must create a file to pass to the QgsHtmlAnnotation, but it would be
nice to have setHTMLSourceCode ( ... ) to pass a html string directly.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] paletted rasters with class labels
Message-ID: <525E90AB.1020609@sarvision.nl>

Hi,

Since version 2 qgis does not seem to support paletted rasters (e.g. 
tiff's with colortable) with a label for each raster class, is that 
correct? In version 1.8, in the colormap tab of the raster properties, 
the palette of the raster (if any) would automatically be used, and you 
could add (or qgis would load, if they were available in the raster 
metadata) a label/name for each of the colors/classes. In the new 
version, a raster is either of type 'palette' but that has no option to 
use/add labels (but does use the internal palette of the raster), or it 
is rendered as 'singleband pseudocolor', which has labels per class, but 
cannot use the raster internal colortable.

We really miss this feature now.

Should I file a new enhancement request/bug?

Best regards,
Vincent.

PS over the whole, version 2.0 is a great improvement, kudo's to all the 
devs! :-)

Hi all.
In the Field Calculator there are, among the expressions, a series of spatial

make sense as operators across layers, but I do not see how to use them within the
same layer.
Any hint?

Hi Pierluigi,
I think you can modify and redistribute the plugin [1] if you want 
because it should be release under the GNU General Public License [2].
Remember to release it under the same license and to cite the past 
developers after the licence. Maybe you can publish your plugin clearly 
marking it as for qgis 2.x.x only (some of the administrators of the 
repository can give a better answer).
Of course, it would be best contacting the original developers team but 
sometimes it could be impossible (is him/her in a wounderful island and 
doesn't think to touch a pc  for very much longer time again? ;) ).
Hope to not annoy nobody.

Hi 
selectAll did that, I did not check if it was updated to 2.0. 
 I added CTRL+A shortcut to it. 
We should probably consider it has a core feature in fact! 
Cheers

thanks Juergen, Giovanni for clarifying.
AFAIK in the standalone there are still some packaging issues for GRASS and/or SAGA:
could someone clarify what is best to use to run a full set of analyses
(GRASS+SAGA+OTB; GRASS also from its plugin, and all from Processing), on Windows?
Thanks a lot.

Hello Roberto,

If you open the attribute table, and apply a filter (e.g. "Show elements
visible on the map") and then press Ctrl+a (click on the table first if,
so it will get the keystrokes) or right click => "select all"  the
features which match the current filter (= are visible on the table)
will become selected.
This works only on one layer, so for multiple layers you will have to do
this repeatedly.

Regards,
Matthias

Hi Paolo,

You can find a description of it here :
http://www.3liz.com/blog/rldhont/index.php?post/2012/11/06/Spatial-operators-in-QGIS-expression

You can do this type of expression :
intersects( $geometry, geomFromWKT( 'LINESTRING(765145.88 6274561.22, 
776031.67 6284189.52)' ) )

I made it for WFS QGIS-Server

When you say 32 bit, do you mean:
http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup.exe
or:
http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/testing64/osgeo4w-setup-x86.exe
?
Thanks for clarifying.

Hi all.
I think the beahviour of this tool should be improved:
* no feedback is given upon completion ("World file written")
* name is misleading (it is extracting a world file, not a projection)
* the prj is (optionally) created according to the project settings, so it is empty
for layers not loaded; the user should be warned, and the prj not created in this case.
Agreed?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

just tested latest master

2013/10/17 Paolo Cavallini <cavallini at faunalia.it>:
> * no feedback is given upon completion ("World file written")
Agreed, feedback about process completion will be good.

> * name is misleading (it is extracting a world file, not a projection)
Hmm, it also extract projection into .prj file (optionally). Maybe both
files (wld and prj) should be created by default?

> * the prj is (optionally) created according to the project settings, so it is empty
> for layers not loaded; the user should be warned, and the prj not created in this case.
Hmm, works for me. Maybe your layers don't contain projection information?

BTW, I think it is better to improve this tool inside Processing as in future
IMO it should replace GDALTools.

Hi,

in the web I find the QGIS API Documentation http://qgis.org/api/ for
version:

1.6
1.7
1.8
2.1.0-Master

Is there also a 2.0 version, or is it not necessary to distinguish between
2.0 and master (2.1)?

Message-ID: <1382003054221-5084095.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I happily discovered today that gdal 1.10 supports xlsx format, and very
well according to my tests. 
I was disappointed when I tried to open old xls files, working correctly in
gdal 1.9 osgeo4w. 

Is it compiled with xls support? (ogrinfo says no). Any hope to have it? 

Cheers 
R?gis

as suggested by -strk I'll try the solution in the list...

I've three features with hierarchy  dependency among them:
FIRST needed by SECOND that is needed by THIRD

what it's better

A) ONE big pull request of the three features (with hierarchy dependency)

or

B) TREE sequential pull request sequentially waiting the merge of the
previous pulls?

or

C) three parallel pull request but that can create compilation problem if
THIRD pull is merged before SECOND and SECOND before FIRST

or

D) somethig new :)

Do A) as long as they are clear commits for each feature, or clear lines
between the commits.  It's easier to test because it's only one branch and
everything is related so just do it in one go.  The person who merges can
split them as needed.

I'm using (still) qgis 1.9 alpha, from before major changes were made. It is very stable and we're using it on several machines quite happily.

There is one user where qgis crashes a lot, doing trivial stuff like pan, zoom, identify. And we cannot pinpoint the root of the problem.

Is there any logging facility in qgis that we can use to help narrowing the possible causes?

Thanks,
Duarte

Hi all.
Showing DB credentials on the tooltip on mouse over the legend seems an useless
security flaw (e.g. these can accidentally be shown during a demo, etc.).
Why not hiding them?
All the best.

First of all thanks for reply, Kaosmos 
I wrote as you said. 

m_mapCanvas->mapRenderer()->setProjectionsEnabled(true);
m_mapCanvas->mapRenderer()->setDestinationCrs(m_mapCanvas->pseudoMercator());
m_mapCanvas->mapRenderer()->setMapUnits(m_mapCanvas->pseudoMercator().mapUnits());

I created custom layer based on QgsVectorLayer and overloaded bool
draw(QgsRenderContext &rendererContext) method, where i draw pixmaps
(tiles). Also i set crs to this layer in constructor:
setCrs(QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(4326,
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::PostgisCrsId));

So, i know the coordinates of tile (where i need to draw it in degrees).
Also i know, that my canvas has crs_3857 and my layer has crs_4326.
I try to get scene position, where i need to draw it:

QPointF toCanvasCoordinates( const QgsPoint& point ){
    double x = point.x(), y = point.y();
    m_layer->canvas()->getCoordinateTransform()->transformInPlace( x, y );
    return QPointF( x, y );
}

And nothing is was happened... What i`m doing wrong?
Thanks.

Might it be a GDAL thing?

Hi,
***Untested theories here... there might be dragons...

you could maybe make plugin with a dockwidget with a qgsmapcanvas in it 
where you show your support data and react to Qgis canvas move events 
and update the plugins mapcanvas.

Hi all.
I'm struggling to set up Processing, with saga, otb, and grass, on several machines,
and I'm encountering a series of issues:
* on Win, I had to install osgeo4w 32 bit to have OTB; this resulted in a series of
problems in autoconfig of Processing, solved by removing the standalone, the registry
keys, and activating the saga 2.0.8 compatibility option
* on osx, grass is not found, even if the path seems correct
* on Ubuntu 13.04, running grass from processing freezes QGIS
* on Debian Wheezy saga is not available.
I think we still have something to improve to make life easier for our GIS analysts.
Any hint welcome, available for testing.
Thanks.

Hi Paolo,
According to this just-closed ticket, I think (some of?) this stuff has
been resolved in future standalone builds:

My OS X package has all the Processing dependencies bundled in the app.  With a clean install it should find the bundled GRASS (and SAGA, OTB, TauDEM) automatically.  If you have used the 2.0 nightlies before 2.0 release, your preferences may have paths to Processing components that don't work with my build.  The Processing prefs are not stored with the QGIS global prefs, but are in the ~/.qgis2/processing folder.  But the GRASS path for the GRASS plugin (non-processing), and the flags that say that GRASS and SAGA are installed for Processing ARE stored in the global QGIS prefs (~/Library/Preferences/org.qgis.qgis2.plist), so you might want to try deleting both.

This might be due to antiviruses blocking the installation of some of the executables.
Anyone has the same issue?

Hi, I agree showing password is dangerous, but showing  login is usefull as
it helps knowing what user is connected (and then understand rights, and so
easily debug problems with access right management)
cheers

in the same way as before but with layer.getFeatures():

        layer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer()
        for elem in layer.getFeatures():
                geom= elem.geometry()
                poly = geom.asPolygon()

       poly.wkbType() == QGis.WKBPolygon

(231684,110648), (232139,110988)]].

There are other ways as the result of getFeatures() is now a generator:

       layer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer()
       elem = layer.getFeatures().next()
       geom= elem.geometry()

Hi William,
thanks for clarifying. Apparently the user has a fresh install, so this should not be
the problem. GRASS plugin works, it is just Processing plugin that has trouble
finding it.
All the best.

...strange, because also using your code, I had this error

poly.wkbType() == QGis.WKBPolygon
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'wkbType'

What I do not understand is:  for what reason getting coordinates is
different from Lines and Polygon ?
Perhaps, Is this a new of PyQGis 2 ?


Thank you

That should be geom.wkbType() == QGis.WKBPolygon

poly is a list-of-list.

Polygons are list-of-lists-of-points. A list for each ring in the polygon
Linestrings are list-of-points.

This hasn't changed since 1.8, or in a long time.

I found a way to have coordinates:

layer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer()
for elem in layer.getFeatures():
    geom= elem.geometry()

    elem = geom.asPolygon()

     for iii in range (len(elem)):
          for jjj in range (len(elem[iii])):

                x1,y1 = elem[iii][jjj][0], elem[iii][jjj][1]


Is this the unique way ?   Nothing of more elegant ?

For what reason, in the linestring case I can write something like this:


layer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer()
for elem in layer.getFeatures():
    geom= elem.geometry()
    poly = geom.asPolyline()

    for p1 in elem:
         x1,y1 = p1.x(),p1.y()
         print   ('%lf,%lf \n') % (x1,y1)


...and, instead, in polygon there is not a x()  y()  method ?

:)



Thank you

Hi All,

I submitted a new python plugin for the plugin repository yesterday. I
wanted to provide some additional clarification to help with the review
process.

The plugin 'Google Maps Engine Connector' was developed at Google to help
the enterprise customers view their maps engine maps in QGIS as well as
upload layers to maps engine from QGIS. Testing the full functionality of
this plugin will be difficult without a paid google maps engine account. I
have ensured the code is sufficiently documented so it should be easy to
get an idea of the functionality. If the team has further questions or
concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Github repo: https://github.com/googlemaps/mapsengine-qgis-connector
Plugin: http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/GoogleMapsEngineConnector/

Also, if possible, could someone give an estimate on when can we expect
this plugin to be reviewed and listed?

Thanks.

Hi,

In my opinion, the plugin description should clearly state that the
plugin requires a paid google maps engine account. Otherwise we will
be flooded with user mails wondering how it works.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hmm.  Runtime errors can cause Processing to say that it can't find it, even when the path is correct.  What's in the output log of a Processing GRASS command (not the dialog that pops up when it can't find GRASS).  You can keep the algorithm dialog open by setting a Processing general option.

Hi all.
Just finished a course on GIS analyses, following mainly the sextante tutorial; here
my notes:

* Random selection: the selection does not appear, as the module is not refreshing
the view
* Split randomly: the % is not exact (e.g. if I select a 20/80 split, I get 22/78 etc.)
* Create graticule from extent: with lines, one of the points (first North-West) is
left out; with polygons it is ok
* In the Log viewer, the button Cancel is misleading, and can lead to loss of
important data a bit too easily; better to give a warning before actually deleting
* the Field calculator is barely usable without a dropdown list of fields and
functions; on win it does not seem to work (most or all calculations end up with all
NULLs); unclear if this is due to minor edit issues from users (quite likely without
the dropdowns)
* it seems impossible to make conditional models (if this value is ... then run this
command, else this other one): am I correct? this would be a major improvement IMHO
* I cannot have OTB running, neither on Debian nor on Win (osgeo4w 32 bit)
* I get a systematic crash when attempting to edit Processing or R scripts, but this
may be a local issue

Hi,

Seems fixed in master. Also similar bug was closed about 5 days ago, see
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/8127#change-45578

> * Split randomly: the % is not exact (e.g. if I select a 20/80 split, I get 22/78 etc.)
I can see only SAGA algorithm with this name. Not sure, but seems this is
upstream (SAGA) bug.

> * Create graticule from extent: with lines, one of the points (first North-West) is
> left out; with polygons it is ok
Seems same as previous.

> * In the Log viewer, the button Cancel is misleading, and can lead to loss of

I suppose you mean Clear button, right? Added in master just now.

Maybe I'm wrong, but currently there is no way to create such widgets
and use them
in Processing algorithms.

> * it seems impossible to make conditional models (if this value is ... then run this
> command, else this other one): am I correct? this would be a major improvement IMHO
Yes, there are no support for conditional expressions and loops in modeler.
I don't remember exactly, but this is a complex issue and adding such feature
will require a lot of work.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS inconsistency
Message-ID: <CALYXVraQgbVzB8Ynyijj-Z4mmm9LNX-x6ZFG=SfBWb8-w=0ySw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have been doing a project to calculate mountain viewsheds, basically
where a mountain summits can be seen from.

I have calculated the viewsheds and polygonized to Vector. So far so good,
but then I wanted to show which mountains could be seen from the summit of
other mountains I appear to have 2 problems.

1. I ran a spacial query to show how many mountains (Munros) are Within my
polgonized viewshed. This returns the Munros. Unfortunately I get a
different number in QGIS 1.8 to QGIS 2.0.1, I don't know which is true

2. I had saved my Viewshed originally as a shapefile with a CRS of 27700
(British National Grid), I saved a version as GeoJSON with CRS of 4326. If
I run the same spacial query on this file I get a different number of
Munros again.

So I now have 4 different figures from what I would have expected to be
identical.

Is data lost when a shapefile is saved as a GeoJSON file in a different CRS?
and which should I beleive 1.8 or 2.0.1 or neither?

If anyone wants to test this you can download the files here:
Viewshed Shapefile<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/AmBodach_shp.zip>-
CRS of 27700
Viewshed GeoJSON<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/AmBodach_geojson.zip>-
Converted fromthe above but with CRS of 4326
Munros Shapefile <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/Munros.zip> -
CRS of 27700

Wish I had realised there was something wrong before I had calculated 200
of these.

Thanks,
Steven

Hi, 
first tests for me, and I found that using selection or not should be an
option in every tool dialog. Having to go in general options to use
selection or not in input is not natural, and is different from other qgis
tools. 
Cheers,
R?gis

agreed - however, I think having the (editable) plain gdal command line at the bottom
is a major advantage of gdal tools for power users.

I think it would be useful to open a ticket for each and specify
2.0.2 as the target version of those which are clearly bugs and known
to be fixable in a safe way. Release manager should have the last word
about that.

You are both wrong :-)

When the algorithm is started, a method called
getCustomParametersDialog() is called. If it doesn't exist, the
default dialog is used. If you want an algorithm to have a different
dialog, you can create it and just return it in here. Right now, no
algorithm implements that method, but the architecture of Processing
supports that


Regarding releasing a new version, I actually do not know how to do
it, considering that there is not Processign plugin page, so I cannot
publish the zip file using the web interface. However, if you Paolo,
or Alex, want to publish it, I definitely like the idea. We are not
adding any new functionality lately, but mostly fixing bugs, so I
would propose to release regularly, like once a week, to have all new
fixed available.

I propose to tag versions using the current QGIS version and an extra
number, so now we will do 2.0.1.2, then 2.0.1.3....and once QGIS 2.0.2
is out, we move to 2.0.2.1. Sounds ok to you?

Try with gdalinfo tool, if raster has projection, this tool will show
it. Also raster
can be displayed in correct place even it doesn't have assigned projection, but
has correct wld file. Maybe this is your case.

This is true only for tools, that are command line utilities. Extract
projection is
exception, it uses GDAL API and has no independent command line equivalent.

Also it is possible to add text field for additional command line arguments in
Processing.

You are right:

Coordinate System is:
LOCAL_CS["unnamed",
    UNIT["unknown",1]]
Origin = (1606490.380039062583819,4894971.249973144382238)
Pixel Size = (0.500000000000000,-0.500000000000000)

in this case, a .prj should not be written by the command (even better: the user
could be warned about this).

sure

that would be good. however, having the plain gdal command ready at hand (not the
processing wrapper) is very useful to prototype scripts.

All the best, and thanks.

Why not reusing existing SEXTANTE page at plugin website? Maybe
it is possible to rename it and use for publishing Processing packages?
If this does not violate plugin site and project policy, maybe Nathan or
Alessandro can do this (I mean renaming) for us.

Or alternatively, we can mark SEXTANTE as deprecated, create new page
for Processing and upload packages to this page.

And finally, we can publish Processing packages near to the QGIS nightly
builds, so users can download it and install manually. This option is less
automated for users.

I'm not sure will Plugin manager correctly recognize such four-numbers versions
and overwrite them (will try to do some testing). Maybe I'm wrong (Borys know
more about this), but we should keep main Processing (in QGIS core) with higher
version than version available from plugin repo. This needed for
correct overriding
when user installed new QGIS build.

I would remove the SEXTANTE plugin website. It makes no sense to have
it there, since SEXTANTE does not exist anymore

We can use a different version naming scheme, as long as it makes it
easy to coordinate independent releases with releases made along QGIS
ones.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] What's the difference between
 provider.geometryType() and layer.geometryType()
Message-ID: <op.w47hzjvuna7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi Victor,

I've been porting one of my scripts to the new Processing. Everything  
seems fine but I'm confused about one issue:
It seems like almost everything can be accessed via the layer now, e.g.  
crs(), pendingFields(), etc. However, if I try to use layer.geometryType()  
in the VectorWriter constructor, I get an error. It only works if I do:

writer = VectorWriter(output, None, fields, provider.geometryType(),  
layer.crs() )

What's the reason for this unintuitive behavior?

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

Hi Anita

looking into the code... the unintuitive part is that these
geometryType() methods return values from different enumerations:
- provider's geometryType() returns value from WKBType enumeration
- layer's geometryType() returns value from GeometryType enumeration
(translated from provider's geometryType())

GeometryType has just coarse differentiation (Point, Line, Polygon,
UnknownGeometry, NoGeometry), while WKBType is more fine grained
(WKBPoint, WKBPoint2D, WKBMultiPoint, ...)

I totally agree that it is confusing... they should be at least called
differently (e.g. geometryWkbType vs geometryType).

Regards
Martin

I wasn't aware of that difference that Martin mentions. I guess that,
from the Processing side, the only thing to do is to document clearly
which find of enumeration value is expected, and also how to convert
it in case you have a value corresponding to the other enumeration. I
will try to add that to the Processing documentation

thanks for finding this issue

Hi,

Currently we have:

QgsVectorLayer:
 * geometryType() returns QGIS geometry type (coarse)
 * wkbType() returns WKB type (fine)

QgsVectorDataProvider:
 * geometryType() returns WKB type (fine)

Unfortunate indeed.

To not break existing code, a new method geomType() could be 
introduced, which returns the QGIS geometry type and the method 
wkbType() could be implemented for the dataprovider as well. The 
current methods could be deprecated, but left for a transition period 
(IMO, there is no need to force people to change working code too fast)

Apart from this, a couple of other methods could also be called the 
same in data provider, vector layer and fields.

QgsVectorLayer
 * int fieldNameIndex( fieldName )
 * QgsFields pendingFields()

QgsDataProvider
 * int fieldNameIndex( fieldName )
 * QgsFields fields()
 * QMap<QString, int> fieldNameMap()

QgsFields
 * int indexFromName( name )
 * QgsField field( name )

I would even argue, that QgsVectorLayer should have a common interface 
(base class) with QgsVectorDataProvider. A lot of code could perfectly 
be run against any of the two, and with such an interface, this could 
be done. Just like we don't care if we are working with an iterator 
from a vector layer or a data provider.

Regards,
Matthias

Thanks for the explanation Martin! I hope here is a way to have  
consistency again without necessarily breaking working code.

@Victor: A few comments in the example scripts explaining the issue would  
already help a lot I think.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Steven,

just having a quick look at the data you provided:
- your Munros.shp doesn't have 27700 projection, but some user defined and  
only becomes visible when setting to 27700 manually.
- the geojson and the shape file have quite some offset. (75 whatsoevers,  
meteres, miles ??)

Apart from the fact that there might  be a bug, your data seems to me more  
buggy ;)
Besides that, i never dare to do any spatial analysis within epsg 4326.

If we start to talk about inconsistencies I also want to propose
to use same approach for retrieving selected features as we use
for all features ? iterator.

Now getFeatures() method returns iterator, while selectedFeatures()
returns a list. It will be good to have same approach for both method.
This can be done as introducing new method (or updating existing) for
getting selected features or, alternatively, by introducing special flag to
existing getFeaures() method.

Has anybody ever heard of this redmine plugin:

https://github.com/jamtur01/ghostred

According to the project description "GhostRed connects to GitHub ... 
Each? pull request is then captured, a corresponding ticket opened in 
a? Redmine project"

I think this could help us to manage this problem, if we stick to 
redmine. In redmine, devs can also get a list of open tasks and not 
only get a one-time-notification informing about the responsibility.

Message-ID: <5263B38D.3060908@gmail.com>

Hi guys,
I'm trying to install qgis on debian 7.2 but there is a problem with the 
keys:

gpg: requesting key 47765B75 from hkp server keys.gnupg.net
?: keys.gnupg.net: Host not found
gpgkeys: HTTP fetch error 7: couldn't connect: No such file or directory

That's my first installation on a debian machine. Am I missing something?

Thanks

Matteo

Message-ID: <CADb3=VGdNOweSbsOKcAhJpMYGiq3ojg-enzD2HhsXrHPbBRPAw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I'm trying to join the attribute tables of two layers by location as part
of a python plugin. Using the GUI I would do this using Vector > Data
Management Tools > Join attributes by location. I expected to be able to do
this using the processing toolbox, but it looks like this algorithm is
missing.

If I'm overlooking something obvious, could someone point me in the right
direction? Otherwise, it doesn't look like too much trouble to port the
algorithm from fTools to processing - I'm happy to do this, but don't want
to step on anyone else's toes if this is already underway.

Regards,

Josh

I see it: Select by location. Perhaps you did not enable the QGIS backend?
Anyway, if you have some spare time, there are a number of modules that need some
care, please go ahead and fix bugs listed here:

Paolo,

The selection by location algorithm is not the same - it selects features
in one layer that intersect with another layer. I want to join the
attribute tables of two layers where they intersect. Multiple intersections
should either take the first feature, or calculate summary statistics (e.g.
sum, median).

Thanks for pointing out the bug tracker - I probably should have gone there
in the first instance...

Josh

no, that's not the intended behaviour.

Shared locks for select queries are ok (that's how postgres works) but they
must be released once cursors are closed (or even deleted).

Please, file a ticket on the QGIS trac [1].

Hi all,

I need to export some attribute tables from QGIS in .xls format. As far as

QGIS 2.0 yet, right? I can update it and contribute the changes, but I
would like to know if it has been already planned or maybe the plugin is

Yes, I believe it is. At least the fact that only closing QGIS releases the
locks.
You can even create several locks on the same table if you keep removing
and adding the same table.

But, is it expected that a QGIS client can lock a postgis view in such way
that I can not even run a trigger on a related table? When I tried, QGIS
just hangs until I close the process in Postgresql. The opposite happens
when I try to delete a View via Pgadmin that is opened in QGIS, pgadmin
hangs until I close QGIS.

Thanks,

Alexandre

Hi Siki,

Thanks for the response. I like your solution, but the users who are going
to use this don't want to export data to dbf or csv and then transform it
manually. So I guess my best option is to adapt the XYTools plugin to the
2.0 version, provided that nobody else is already doing so. Is anybody
working on that already?

Cheers,
V?ctor.

Hi Victor.

According to the page of this plugin [1] Richard Duivenvoorde is the 
maintainer of this plugin. I would wait for his response before taking 
any action. He recently replied in another thread to a similar 
question. [2]

Kind regards,

Victor,

Open QGIS, load layer, open attribute table, select all button, copy button, open excel, paste.

That's the fastest way I know to get my data into excel.

Hi Siki,
Thanks for the response. I like your solution, but the users who are going to use this don't want to export data to dbf or csv and then transform it manually. So I guess my best option is to adapt the XYTools plugin to the 2.0 version, provided that nobody else is already doing so. Is anybody working on that already?

Cheers,
V?ctor.

Dear Victor,

save your data into a shape file and open the dbf table with excel or calc and save as xls.

Regards,
Zoltan

Hi!
I have implemented the improvement of rendering in a new ad-hoc featureIterator with the possibility that each vector-provider implements its own method of pre-simplification.
The performance is the same as the first version I developed (~3x faster :-)).
It also implements the simplification of geometries in the OGR-provider pre-fetch the features. It improves the post-simplification around 5%.
I think that this branch is ready por test! :-)

Could it please be approved again:

That's good news !

Is it configurable in the interface for each layer independantly ? 

It should probably be, as according to the style applied to the geometries, 
the simplification could be something we want for some layers and not for 
others.
A checkbox in the layer properties dialog could be interesting. 

Then we would have to decide if we want it activated by default or not for 
dataproviders supporting it. We could have a global option for that default 
too.

Hello Vincent!
For now, it is not configurable, automatically applies to all vector layer to be painted.

I think that the userneed not configure this, of course, if dev-community suggests, will be as you say! :-)

Hi,

Thank you for your work!

Yes - I think it should be configurable. It should also automatically be
turned off if a layer is in edit mode.

Just my opinion,
Andreas

Hi, I am testing in Windows XP compiling with Visual Studio 2010.

I have a console test application using directly the "shapefil" library.
I will use?test_ogrsf utility for a complete benchmark

I this environment and my test application, using?OGRFastAtof(), the full read of a?huge shape around 500.000 records (500mb of shp file, 150mb of dbf file) with eight double fields goes from 5.6sg to 3.06sg. I don't evaluate that the precision loss, it is a task for check.

In addition, using filemapping with boost library, the full process goes from 3.06sg to 1.45sg.

These values ?as you see ?are approximate, but they give an idea of ??optimization is possible at least for this OS.

It is why I wanted to check this behavior


thanks!

A use case is for example when a "line of symbol" symbology is used, with a 
symbol on each vertex. Simplifying the geometry, even when it is not 
supposed to be visible, could have undesired consequences on display.

Hi Victor,

I'm just too busy with other things.

And I was/am in the middle of some bigger change: writing and reading
all geometries as wkt columns (instead of only x/y). The core is
working, I just have to do the gui stuff to make it work...

But maybe I should postpone that and just do the little fixes needed to
make the old version run in 2.0?

Please give me some time....

Actually when thinking about the atof() optimization, a far better idea would 
be to make sure that QGIS uses OGR_L_SetIgnoredFields() with all the regular 
field names as parameter (except the fields it might use for styling), when it 
just needs the geometry. So no slow or fast atof() at all will be needed. In 
my old copy of QGis git, I see a QgsOgrProvider::setRelevantFields() method 
that is supposed to do something in that area. Something that you should be 
investigated more. You don't need to read 8 double fields just for rendering.

Hi, I'm maintaining this plugin

I tested the code:
settings=QSettings()
a=settings.value( "/qgis/zoom_factor", 2, type=int )

in the python console and it works... the error message says that

cannot convert QVariant metaType = 10 (QString) in QVariant metaType = 2
(Int)... so probabily in your settings zoom_factor is set as string
value... e.g "2" instead of 2

try to check in your Qgis setting

if this is not the case, please create an issue here:

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/dockablemirrormap/issues

explaining the context and if possibile a data set to allow me to reproduce
the error?

thank you

Ok Andreas, I'm going to make it configurable, will present a new option in the main properties form of the layer

About of simplification in "editmode". I think is not necessary disable it, the simplification runs only on the method of painting "QgsVectorLayer::draw", not when you retrieve a geometry to treat your information.

Hi,

There is a problem with a comma as the decimal separator.

A new bug has been reported:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8934

Hi,

Thank you, Richard. If you want I can work with you to upgrade the plugin
to 2.0. I have a current project now in which this functionality is needed,
so I can spend some time in this. What do you think?

Regards,
V?ctor.

I suppose he meant to do not draw simplidied geometries during editing
because it would obviously lead to produce unconsistent edits.

My simplification algorithm is a new method that uses the MapToPixel data of current QgsRenderContext to ignore in the drawing of geometry the "equal-pixel device points". It has no effect if the geometry is not far of current point of view of map.

It does not uses the ST_Simplify() method (douglas-peucker algorithm) where the geometry is simplified for other "similar" geometry.

Hi Vincent!

My simplification algorithm is a new method that uses the MapToPixel data of current QgsRenderContext to ignore in the drawing of geometry the "equal-pixel device points". It has no effect if the geometry is not far of current point of view of map.

It does not uses the ST_Simplify() method (douglas-peucker algorithm) where the geometry is simplified for other "similar" geometry.

I think the appearance of painted geometry is not affected except that it does not draw the unnecessary "equal-pixel device?points".
The simplification will be configurable by user, then we can test this issue.


Alvaro

Oh, I see. So it's "transparent" to the user, he doesn't notice the
simplification, right?

I think so, the user?doesn't notice the simplification or I do not see why I have my glasses dirty :-)

You can see this previous discussion in....

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to get the field values in PyQGis 2 ?
Message-ID: <CAFF9Zhssmv4=nf2p6w1vzaorhjxNVE59x0UAXfO3WD473fOStg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have difficulties writing the python code to print the field value
contents from a feature.

This is my source code:

                    iter = layer.getFeatures()
                    for feat in iter:
                      fff = feat.fields()
                      num = fff.count()
                      print "num %d\n" %(num)
                      for iii in range(num):
                         fieldValue = fff[iii]
                         print "%s\n" %(fieldValue)

but this is what I had:

<qgis.core.QgsField object at 0x000000000BF95268>

etcetera....


What I need to modify in the source code to have the correct string values ?

Sorry, but the 2.0 documentation is not so clear... actually  :(


Thank you in advance for any info about this

Roberto

OK, I found it !


                    iter = layer.getFeatures()
                    for feat in iter:
                      fff = feat.fields()
                      num = fff.count()
                      for iii in range(num):
                         print "%s " %(feat[iii])


But...  what about to have the field names ?

Thank you

Roberto

Simple just:

For feature in layer.getFeatures():
     For attr in feature:
          Print attr

If you have field names

For feature in layer.getFeatures():
       Print feature["field name"]

Message-ID: <CAMB2qw1A7SO9VhwH1fLXmj0SBcoouZgPztwCdCcndcQ7xVVcHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've made a pull request to Qgis Web Client code:

 https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Web-Client/pull/54

With this pull we can customize QWC toolbar by adding custom buttons. There
is an example with a test button to get map coordinates.

It will be easier to get updates from QWC repository, since we leave
Webgisinit.js and GUI.js untouched.

Thank you, Nathan.


But I have not the field names.  I want to have the field names ...

Hi list, 
I use an iterator two times in a python code and I wantto reset it to the starting point before to reuse it. 
In this way I hope to be more quick. 


# first use of the iterator 
iterator = layer.dataProvider().getFeatures() 

for feature in iterator: 
# operations 

# than, a second time I have to use the operator, in a following part of the code: 

for feature in iterator: 
# other operations 


But it doesn't start from the first feature! 



I try with: 
iterator.rewind() 
between the two blocks, but it doesn't work. 


Thanks.

No, it does False! 


But if I put 
iterator.rewind() 
before the first use of the iterator it does True.

I have a strange problem,
   block = QgsRasterBlock ( QGis.ARGB32_Premultiplied, 10, 10, 0 )
   block.setColor( 0, QColor ().rgb() )
prints warning when run in QGIS Python shell (in QGIS debug output,
not in shell):
  qgsrasterblock.cpp: 378: (setColor) index 140703128616960 out of range

The same code run in pure Python shell (outside QGIS) works OK. Also
QgsRasterBlock.setColor(int,int,QRgb) and
QgsRasterBlock.setValue(size_t, double) both works OK in QGIS Python
shell.

Any idea?

When the iterator has given back all the features it gets closed.
Rewind works only while the iterator si open, so it's supposed to work
while you're stepping through the iteration.
I fear you have to obtain a new iterator to repreat the iteration.

Hi all
It is unclear to me whether the behaviour of this option is correct:
if I have an UPPER CASE field content and apply the above option, I
would expect to have it displayed as Upper Case, whereas it seems to
be left unchanged: am I misinterpreting, or there is a bug?
All the best, and thanks.

So I would expect Upper case, whereas I have UPPERCASE.

Well, Capitalize first letter means... first letter, so UPPER CASE remains
UPPER CASE :)

Message-ID: <CALuHMPBmXiKV+z2FTLCsJi7c1JCEE1bXCa2zYUBBiDG-GPB5kg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all and sorry for cross-posting.

We already have context help for some dialogs in QGIS, but this
texts available not for all dialog and most of them are outdated.
Moreover, docs and this help used different format (RST for docs,
HTML for context help).

Keeping context help up-to-date requires additional efforts and
maybe separate team. Maybe it is better to drop context help in
favor of documentation? Opinions?

IMHO we should unify the two. The context help should appear as a box
in the manual, and the GUI should take it from there (one source,
copied both in the GUI and in the manual).
Thanks.

On the issue of which format to use, pandoc can translate between most
document formats it seems, including the ones specified by Alexander as
being used by QGIS. Project is here:

http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/

The help should definitely be in a single format; ideally something that is
easily editable by non-technical users.

Cheers,
Jonathan

When I enter those two lines into QGIS python console, it work fine
(no debug output, result of setColor() call is True). Tested on linux
64bit, QGIS master (debug), SIP v4.15.2.

Otherwise I do not really have an idea what goes wrong there (btw. the
index is an interesting number - in hex it is 0x7ff800000000 - maybe
it is not handling size_t type correctly? what if you change that
"size_t" argument in .sip file to something else?)

could you also test if you get the right value from block back
   block.color( index )
and with indexes > 0

it does not seem to be really correct

> - maybe it is not handling size_t type correctly?

yes, size_t seems to be the problem, it is not defined in qgsrasterblock.sip,
probably the definition from qgsgeometry.sip is used:
  %If (WS_MACX)
  typedef unsigned long size_t;
  %End
  %If (WS_X11 || WS_WIN)
  typedef unsigned int size_t;
  %End
which does not seem to be very robust. BTW, how to define such things
correctly, in each sip file or globally in another sip file for all?

With int it works.

+1

I was actually hoping that we could get rid of the context help, in
favour of pointing to paragraphs/anchors in the manual. Either view it
in some kine of webkit-dialog, or just with the default webbrowser.

Actually that was also reason to choose for bootstrap: the ability to
view the docs in all kind of (msgbox)-widths, maybe use some slightly
different css.

Not sure about the possibilities, but we could choose to point to online
help, OR package the docs (per language) in a way that it can be used
offline.
As an example: if the grey boxes like about 'Operators' in
http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/field_calculator.html
would have an anchor we could point to it.

Hi,

I have a problem with this very useful plugin.

If I load a Postgis dataset which includes points across 180, for data captured around New Zealand, using longitudes in the 0-360 space (which is valid data for EPSG:4326) they plot fine in QGIS.

If I then start the plugin & use a Google/Yahoo/etc basemap, the points are (usually) initially in the correct place and plot OK. Sometimes the points in the W hemisphere fail to render, sometimes they are OK. This is on a zoomed out map.

As I zoom in, QGIS starts to omit the points in the W hemisphere altogether, even in the configurations that were OK when zoomed out. QGIS also sometimes starts to offset the points from the basemap, so that the western points on the map plot at an increasingly offset position, and the eastern points are missing. As I zoom back out, this offset is retained and the map fails to overlay the points correctly.

I'm assuming this is related to the plugin switching the canvas to EPSG:3857 and failing to support the 0-360 longitude coordinates. Given Proj.4 is used as the reprojection engine, there should be no problems with the 0-360 coords being correctly mapped to EPSG:3857, as in my experience Proj.4 (cs2cs) has supported 0-360 input seamlessly for some years now.


Is there any simple fix I can apply? If some funding is required to make the plugin work correctly across 180 with 0-360 longitude data, this is possible.??

Hi,

Regardless of whether it is called "capitalise first letter" or "title case", I think the current behaviour is better, because it preserves acronyms in upper case.  If you want to force every word into title case you can always use an expression to convert to lower case first.

What I actually think is unfortunate is that the expression function "title()" does what you want.  It would be more useful if it worked the same way as the label formatting option that you're complaining about ;)

Indeed, the definition does not look robust. Will it help if you
change size_t definition for your platform to "unsigned long long" ?
(assuming you are on 64bit OS)

There was a thread on size_t in PyQt some time ago:
http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2006-March/012753.html

You need to define these things just once in one of the .sip files.
The order is not important (unlike c/c++).

Hi all,

Preamble : I am not a QGIS core rendering guru, nor an opengl/webgl, etc.
one.

In web mapping contexts, major improvements are made in 2D vector rendering
speed by using WebGl technology, such as in upcoming OpenLayers 3. As a
user point of view, improvement seems huge compared to classical DOM or
more advanced CANVAS renderer.

What about using graphic card to help improve rendering performance in QGIS
? Would this help a lot, or at the contrary would this be a dead-end ?

I have seen the funding for having a multi-threaded rendering, this is why
this idea came in mind. In twitter, Pirmin told me Marco made some advanced
test. What were the conclusions ?

We would probably begin with porting QGIS to QT5, as OpenGL support has been 
added to QT5 and improved in 5.1.
See for example : 
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtopengl/2dpainting.html

Otherwise, reimplementing an pure OpenGL rendering engine seems a big effort.
And we still would want to have a classic renderer for non-accelerated 
hardware.

One really interesting thing is that it would open the door for viewing 3D 
objects in QGIS. As for now to be able to see PostGIS 3D objects we had to 
develop our own external 3D viewer (horao). For that to happen we would need 
real 3D geometry support in QGIS too.

Interested in preliminary results as well.

Both the future steps look really promising! QT5 and 3D geometries. There
are more and more people longing for it.
Vincent, is there already a roadmap, any plan and, first of all, sponsors?

Thanks for this ressource page about qt5
I agree with you : why reinvent the wheel if QT5 proposes needed and mature
tools. I just hope porting QGIS to Qt5 won't be so hard that it would
postpone it to 3.0 though :) Have any discussions begun on this topic among
QGIS devs ?

Exactly, I have seen your video for Lyon town project, this is great ! I
can only imagine what a speed improvement it would bring for "simple" 2D
painting !

There is also a more ambitious option, detach in QGIS the render of the objects of the painting technology ( Currently Qt+QPainter ) using interfaces as Ogre, Irrlicht or OSG does.?

Then could be implemented several 2D/3D-CPU/GPU renderers ( Qt4-5, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Ogre, OSG ...) being the rendering mode (2D/3D or CPU/GPU) changeable from a single application option.

There is also a more ambitious option, detach in QGIS the render of the objects of the painting technology ( Currently Qt+QPainter ) using interfaces as Ogre, Irrlicht or OSG does.?

Then could be implemented several 2D/3D-CPU/GPU renderers ( Qt4-5, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Ogre, OSG ...) being the rendering mode (2D/3D or CPU/GPU) changeable from a single application option.

Hello all again,

>From PyQgis, I need to export (to my own format) only the elements
contained in the QGis view.

So, I taken the canvas coordinates and I created a string that has the
"expression" syntax:

                text = self.iface.mapCanvas().extent().toString()
                text1 = text.replace("," , " ")
                text2 = text1.replace(" : ", ",")
                text = "bbox($geometry, geomFromWKT ( 'LINESTRING(" + text2
+ ")'))"


There is a way to applicate the bbox filter during the scanning of the
elements, that is during:

                    iter = layer.getFeatures()
                    for feat in iter:

...or, need I to filter elements from myself ?

It will be only in 2.2 version ?

Thank you for any info about this

Hey Roberto,

No need for all that :)

This is all you need:

rq = QgsFeatureRequest(iface.mapCanvas().extent())
for feature in layer.getFeatures(rq):

Hi all

Qt already has an open gl based paint device ( QGLPixelBuffer ), so the 
effect of hardware acceleration can be tested just by replacing the 
QImage with a pixel buffer. I did this years ago and ( can't remember 
the Qt version ), the rendering with QGLPixelBuffer was slower on my 
computer compared to QImage. Additionally, the graphical quality was lower.

The reason might be that transfer of data to the GPU is slow, but 
rendering is fast. So it would probably need a non-QPainter based 
approach to store the data at the GPU and use repeatedly then. Afaik 
Hugo Mercier has experience using a non-QPainter based approach (as used 
in the 3D example city of Lyon). However, such an approach would require 
very fundamental changes in lots of places in the core library.


Regards,
Marco

Actually the usage of QPainter with OpenGL backend is simply a dead
end. As far as I understand the topic, it is just wrong approach. For
efficient use of GPU, one needs to take a different approach: 1.
prepare triangles and textures 2. render the scene in one go. GPU
likes to process lots of data at once - with QPainter it has to
process small bits of data many times and that is why the rendering is
slow.

For rendering with OpenGL, I think we would need to change various
aspects of our symbology:
- markers would be rendered as squares with a texture (prepared with a QPainter)
- linestrings and polygons need to be converted to meshes of triangles

First of all, we probably should:
- have a cache for vector and raster data - a lot of rendering time is
actually spent by fetching data (from disk, database etc) - we need to
keep the data cached in memory and keep updating the cache when the
view changes.
- find out whether we want to interface OpenGL directly or via some
libraries (e.g. OpenSceneGraph)
- as mentioned by others, port QGIS to Qt5 for convenient OpenGL
interface (it should be possible to have a codebase that compiles with
either Qt4 or Qt5)

Martin

Then I get

>>> block.setColor( 0, QColor ().rgb() )
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: arguments did not match any overloaded call:
  QgsRasterBlock.setColor(int, int, int): not enough arguments
  QgsRasterBlock.setColor(int, int): argument 1 has unexpected type 'int'

works with "unsigned long". In C++ I have size_t defined as "long
unsigned int" (gives compilation error if used in sip file) which
should be the same as "unsigned long" I believe.

The problem is wrong definition of size_t in sip file. It should not
work for you as well, right? If you are on Linux you get "typedef
unsigned int size_t" in sip which is not the same as size_t in C++. I
guess that it accidentally works because by chance the memory used by
wider type is zeroed.

Yes, I saw, quite old and no solution. If I look into stddef.h
(/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6/include/stddef.h) the typedef of
size_t is quite complex.

So how can we reliably define size_t in sip file?

I mean what is the best practice to do that in QGIS. Would not it be
better to have shared definitions separated into some common.sip?

and you can use a simple dictionary:


  fields = layer.pendingFields()
  field_names = [field.name() for field in fields]
  for elem in layer.getFeatures():
          atr = dict(zip(field_names, elem.attributes())) 

 The result is a Python dictionary:

{u'DIP_DIR': 120, u'STRATI_TYP': 1, u'DIP': 30}}, for example

Please see this discussion [0] and pull request [1]. Since it is too late
for inclusion in 2.0, and makes no sense to reintroduce the deprecated SVG
files for 2.x, I recommend archiving them and providing a download link on
the web site. I think according to Olivier, these would be the ones to
include [2].

Message-ID: <1382831564.10875.YahooMailNeo@web28902.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Umm, I want to test an experiment.
I see that qgis draws the geometries (LineStrings or Polygons) in independent calls ("painter->drawPolyline" or "painter->drawPolygon()" calls). I have experience using GDI++ as renderer and it is very faster joining n-geometries in one geometry-path and then flush this complex object to the renderer.
I want check how qt-painter (or qt-image) behaves using this trick (It not is applicable in all layer styles but it is for the simple layer style). Someone knows something about it?
Thank you very much.

 2.0.1 dev to Qgis 2.0.1 stable
Message-ID: <CAHmdnV53meZKZ6_13h24HQ33aUwDAs+kNVRcRsT1oO0dg0tSEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,
I've a trouble in importing a module for python after I've updated Qgis
from 1.8.0 stable and 2.0.1 Dev to 2.0.1 stable under windows 7 with
Osgeo4w advanced installer.

A module that I need into the development of my plugin pyarchinit is no
more accessibile because the file _agraph.pyd is no more loadable.

The module is pygraphviz linked to graphviz that is located under Program
Files (x86).

Python 2.7 (32bit) is able to import pygraphviz module and the same for the
python intepreter runned inside osgeo4w shell.

Only the Qgis 2.0.1 python intepreter raises the error for _graph.pyd:
 "ImportError: DLL load failed:..."

What's change into QGis from 2.0.1 dev and 2.0.1 stable? Is very strange
for me and I didn't found a reason.

Any suggestions?

Best regards
Luca

 Unfortunately I'm still seeing this behaviour after 5f5cd4c - I've made
some notes at http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7679 which may be helpful. Please
let me know if there's any extra diagnosis steps you'd like me to try to
help track this down.

Yes I also think it works just accidentally.

We should probably try to compile and run a tiny program (during CMake
configure phase) that will return the value of sizeof(size_t) and from
that generate a helper .sip file with correct definition for size_t.
Not extremely elegant, but should work. The problem will be again with
cross-compilation (e.g. Android) as we cannot run such utility program
on target CPU, but we can hardcode the definition for such platforms.
But maybe there's a better way I am not aware of...

Yes, that would be better.

Hello,
Two weeks ago I wrote that my nmea2qgis2 plugin (?http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/nmea2qgis2/?)?can't get approval and I didn't receive any answer. Could somebody please check it out? Thank you,
Maciek.

Hi Maciek,

I'll have a look, and probably will approve it.

Can you please give some more descriptive info in the metadata?

I'll test it with a little nmea file I found in wikipedia, but feel free
to sent me a better one :-)

Regards,

Richard

I've taken the example nmea snippit from:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183

But it is not working for me.

Can you please give some general information about how to use it in? I
ticked all checkboxes but still no points are shown to me.

Maybe start with writing something down in the README.md at github,
provide a working nmea file with it (just in the zip)?

Regards,

Richard

Message-ID: <CAG4NReK415AgaL6azdR4SZQUtqHiFb3NVw47V8dPN+NJpXE2HA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm finding wrong, distorted results with qgis 2.0 georeferencer. We've tried
with the same set of gcp's in envi and the same method (polynomial deg 2) and
there the results are correct, but with
qgis the result is very distorted. Actually, the errors represented by
the red segments in the
georeferencer do not correspond with the actual gcps displayed on the reference
image in Qgis main display.
See an snapshot here:

Hi,
My plugin page says:

> <http://hub.qgis.org> and filling the missing metadata.

However I cannot find a way how to create new project there... I do have 
osgeo id
and I can login in the right top corner of the screen but I don't see 
any way to create
a new project... I would prefer to keep plugin sources on hub.qgis.org.

Thank you!
Mikhail

I think someone has to grant your user permissions to create a
subproject. Can you reply with your osgeo id.

I was under impression that creating github repository is what almost 
any plugin
developer does.  Perhaps I was wrong.

Well, I won't bother anyone about this...

Hey Mikhail,

hub.qgis.org is just our own source code host and tracking setup.  You are
free to create a github repo and store everything over there.  That is what
a lot of people do.

It would be better if it would just say github.org

Well, that statement isn't wrong. We do like for people to create plugin
repos on hub.qgis.org because it helps to make all the plugins more
discoverable and easily adoptable by other member of the qgis community.
It also means there's a single site for filing bugs for QGIS and Plugins
to QGIS.

However the process to create a new repo requires human interaction, you
have to communicate with us and then we say ok and grant you permissions
to upload plugins (the bar is really low). This is similar to how all
things to plugins.qgis.org are not automatically approved the 1st time
either. It's just spam prevention that a login doesn't auto grant
permissions.

The github thing, is just that it happens to be common for people to
already have and want to use github. The downside is we can't track bugs
all in once place. So we suggest if you use github that you use hub.qgis
for bug tracking. Note you could also use bitbucket, gitlab,
sourceforge, or whatever other hosting for your source you want.

Thanks,
Alex

Thank you Alex,

I also would think that keeping all in one place is more logical.
So if could allow me to open project repo on hub.gis.org
it would be nice. I currently don't have any public repositories,
so if I use github I also would start from scratch.

My geo ID is: Mikhail
the plugin I would like to host

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/latlongrid/

Well, it's a small one.

Otherwise I have to start with github or other service

Thnak you

Mikhail

Done. You should be able to create a subproject now inside of
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins

Look for the add subproject on the upper right of the main body of that
page.

Thanks,
Alex

Message-ID: <CAB28Asi31Hu1xitCAAuNf5_Qo3Or7xc7=t5v9EoT0cjCeYxAWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm just scoping things out -- if I was to go through all the commits which
have hit master since the 2.0 release and apply any relevant bug fixes to
the release-2_0 branch, what's the chance of getting this packaged up and
released as a 2.0 point release?

I'm happy to apply all the bug fixes, but packaging isn't in my skillset!

Hey all,

Now that we have 2.0 out does that mean we are maintaining a stable API?  I
have a fix for a bug in the composer export which requires an API to public
facing APIs, changing int to QString.

What is the procedure now.  Do we add overloads for something like this and
depreciate the old method?

Regards,
Nathan

Is it enough to check only size? I think that unsigned and signed have
also be distinguished.

This is used in GRASS to identify data types and byte order and I
would prefer to avoid it because of the problems with cross
compilation you mentioned.

Maybe the easiest would be to define our own

   typedef unsigned long qgs_size_t;

Hello,

What effects can I achieve using 'Blur only alpha pixels'? What can I
do with this option? Does 'alpha' have to do something with
transparency?

Yes, size_t should be unsigned integer, at least 16-bit long.

Assuming that "unsigned long" is typically 32-bit, and it is not
expected that images would not have more than 2^32 (~4E9) pixels, then
yes, why not. I would just refrain from calling it anything similar to
"size_t" to avoid confusion.

Hi,

I would like to try wherever possible to only extend the API and not 
change or remove existing methods. This will help to ensure, that 
plugins written for 2.0 will stay working for minor releases.

If there is a (more clever/better) replacement for a method, the old 
one should be deprecated. There are several ways to do this e.g. 
Q_DECL_DEPRECATED in C++ /Deprecated/ for SIP annotations but I'm not 
sure what exactly they do. More important IMO is to write a note about 
what should be used instead in order for your code to be prepared for 
the future, like "@deprecated: This method will be removed in QGIS 3. 
Use abc( xyz ) instead."
Often a simple default value for a newly introduced parameter is enough 
anyway.

There may be places, where it is not possible to keep the API or the 
amount of extra work required to keep it would be enormous. In this 
cases, I think we could think of changes to the API, but they need 
careful consideration.

In short: I would like to keep plugins working without changes wherever 
possible.

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-bUToQumJ6D67b_TtQAUo6y2SwEZXnGpYeH-39UP=oVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I seem to be having issues with connecting to QgsProject::writeMapLayer in
Python.
Using new style connections I get an error:

>>> QgsProject.instance().writeMapLayer.connect(layerwrite)

yields

TypeError: connect() failed between
writeMapLayer(QgsMapLayer*,QDomElement,QDomDocument) and unislot()

Trying to connect using the old style connect just doing ever get called:

def write2(layer, dom, dom2):
    print layer, dom, dom2

QObject.connect(QgsProject.instance(), SIGNAL("writeMapLayer( QgsMapLayer,
QDomElement, QDomDocument )"), write2)

This should be called when ever the project is saved and the layer is
written however it just never calls the slot.

Doing something wrong?

Message-ID: <CAFkzVYQwQx-a77_UCNCo_uVoN2pY7bs2pf4Vytk1g6ky8o1fvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm using QGIS 2.0.1-Dufour from the repository ubuntugis-unstable.

I have a plugin that is used to translate a vector layer with a shift
"delta_x" and "delta_y".
To do this I use the function translateFeature() as you can see from the
code below:

vlayer = iface.activeLayer()

feature = QgsFeature()

for feature in vlayer.getFeatures():
    vlayer.translateFeature(feature.id(), delta_x, delta_y)



For every translated feature, the following message is displayed on the
screen:

undo index changed 1
undo index changed 2
undo index changed 3
...


and the plugin execution seems very slow compared to same run under version
QGIS 1.6.0-Copiap?.
Looking at the source code it seems that the message is sent through
Qdebug().
This means that the QGIS was compiled with debug system activated?
How do I get a non-debug version?

Thanks

Message-ID: <1383158596519-5086683.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi!

I write on C++.

Question: how to use QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2?
Input data: 
1. Some features with unique fields (for example QgsField("id",
QVariant::String))
2. QgsVectorLayer with "memory" data provider and "Polygon" items
Task:
I need to draw this features with different colors.
Now i have such code:

QgsCategoriesList categories;

//for all ids create new category with new QgsSymbolV2 with unique color

QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2* renderer = new
QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2("id", categories);
myLayer->setRendererV2(renderer);

Any ideas?
Thanks

Hmm. Something's wrong with that option. It is supposed to show only those
pixels that have a partial alpha component beyond the base opaque pixels of
the component being blurred. For example, if you set the shadow of some
text to be gray and turn on that option, it should still show a duplication
of the text, colored as per the shadow color option, but with any blurred
shadow that extends beyond its text. With the option off, in this example,
it will blur all pixels of the duplicated text.

This is useful for creating a shadow that increases legibility at smaller
output sizes, e.g. like duplicating text and offsetting it a bit in
illustration programs, while still showing a bit of shadow at larger sizes.
Apparently, there is an error with re-painting the opaque pixels back over
top of the shadow (depending upon the shadow's color), when that setting is
used.

So, not sure what to do about the user guide description, since it that
option is broken right now.

If you need any help with descriptions of anything new with labeling,
please let me know.


Regards,

Larry

I  saw that Martin Dobias was the committer for the topology editing 
[0]. Martin, do you have any suggstion on this?

On the side, your fixes are more than welcome, thanks a lot for your work.

Let me give some historical context first because I am afraid we are
mixing two different things :-)

For a long time QGIS has some support for "topology editing". But
that's not a proper topology editing as one may think - from
documentation:
"The option  Enable topological editing is for editing and maintaining
common boundaries in polygon mosaics. QGIS ?detects? a shared boundary
in a polygon mosaic and you only have to move the vertex once and QGIS
will take care about updating the other boundary."

Originally there were separate map tools for addition, removal and
moving of points which were also doing updates to the shared
boundaries of polygons if the "topological editing" was enabled. The
old commit Denis is referring to was basically meant to add the same
functionality also to the newly created node tool that was meant to
replace the three separate tools.

Now about "real" topology editing of data consisting of nodes and
edges - as discussed already in issue #3483, there are various
topology models (PostGIS topo, GRASS, OpenStreetMap, ...?) that would
need slightly different set of tools and validation methods. I have
not really investigated if it is possible to have a support to cover
all of those models - or even it is worth it. Maybe for a start it
would be enough to pick one and focus just on that (PostGIS topo being
my personal favorite).

In general I would love to see a new "topology" layer type in QGIS
(next to vector and raster) that would bring native topology viewing
and editing capabilities to QGIS. I am not aware of anyone working on
that - if you can spend some time on that matter, I am sure you will
make many people happy :-)

Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Opening composer from Python
Message-ID: <CALuHMPAAXw+62dBQGhy_SunUQNcR0w2M1qSPsBuZwoW2M+bwmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I need to create composer window with prepared composition from Python.
There is an createNewComposer() method and seems this is what I need.

I run simple test from Python console and it works, but when I tried to use
same code from plugin QGIS crashes. Here is code for console:

canvas = iface.mapCanvas()
renderer = canvas.mapRenderer()
composition = QgsComposition(renderer)
composition.setPlotStyle(QgsComposition.Print)
composition.setPrintResolution(300)
composition.setPrintAsRaster(True)
map = QgsComposerMap(composition, 5, 5, 200, 200)
map.setNewExtent(canvas.currentLayer().extent())
composition.addItem(map)
c = iface.createNewComposer()
c.setComposition(composition)

Any ideas what can be wrong? Maybe I miss something obvious?

I would prefer something generic from the beginning. We started to
talk about such common editing interface (PostGIS / GRASS) with strk
in Zurich. IIRC we were able to find common editing methods. There
should be some photos of our hand drawn schemas around and strk should
have a paper with the list of methods. Strk, could you publish a scan
of it somewhere on Web?

Message-ID: <1938926513.2406311.1383217507553.JavaMail.open-xchange@comunica.csi.it>

Hi all,

In Python I would to parse WMS GetCapabilities:
the main goal is to gather informations of all exposed layers

I might be wrong, but in QGIS 2.0 API I didn't found any interface or class to
achieve this.
Instead in QGIS source there is qgswmsprovider.cpp that has all methods that I
need.

I already have a simple wms parser in python but possibly I wouldn't duplicate
code... nor to use external python libraries like OWSLib.

Any suggestion to achieve this without reinventing the wheel?

TIA

Hi Nyall,

I will happly release updated Packages for Fedora in my own Repo and I'm
sure they will also be packaged for the official repository in Fedora 20.

I am in favor of this plan. But the most heavily requested packages will
probably be Ubuntu + OS X + Windows. So it would be nice to receive
feedback of the respective maintainers.

Do you have a plan about how to make sure, that the fixes did not
introduce any regressions as side-effect?

Regards and thank you for the offer,
Matthias

I'm completely blank about where that piece of paper can be.
Maybe someone took a picture ?

Agreed: IMHO it would be good to have a common GUI, to be used in a consistent
(topological) way, writing to different backends.
So yes, Pierre, it is interesting to many people, and no, nobody is actively working
on this.
All the best.

Hi Nyall,
thanks for your offer, very interesting. Of course packagers will have to bear much
of the burden of a new release, so they have a say on this.
On the other hand, AFAIK we are going to release more often, so I wonder if it is
worth the while backporting fixes while releasing a new version, with the same bugs
fixed.
All the best.

This is close to http://linfiniti.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/topology.jpg
but not the list I mean.

This is another list, which I probably compiled shortly after Zurich,
but I'm not sure the list on paper was exactly the same (probably not
as I remember we were fighting about having or not "moveNode" :)

I'm not sure I agree with this, or not fully.  Packaging should be a
relativity automated process you just change the branch you build against.
Looking at package.cmd that Jurgen wrote for Windows it seems pretty
complete from A to Z.

On the other hand, AFAIK we are going to release more often, so I wonder if

Yes.  There are users how can't update to new major versions and a bug fix
release is the only option.  Any time you make a major release you can
introduce new bugs with new features. It's fine for us that control the
hardware we run stuff on but a lot of people don't and have to go though a
major process to get an update.
