Hi,

When user selects 2 or more vertices in the vertex editor of a polyline, I
would like to be able to loop over these objects from Python.

Is this possible?

I get the impression the vertex editor is shielded off from Python
scripting.

Hi,

I currently get a lot of 525 errors (SSL Handshake) or 522 (Connection 
time out) from Cloudflare when trying to access the docs. It works 
around every 2nd time I try to access the docs and fails every other time.

Is it just me or do others experience the same?

You mean QgsProjectFileTransform class never dealt with style configured in
project files ? Or what does "for this code" mean, exactly ?

Do you have a link to a mailing list thread where decision taking
process was conducted ? Just in case it has some hints about how
to fix this backward compatibility problem as QGIS moves forward.

Possibly. Sometimes there was/is legacy loading code directly inside the 
readXml classes.

If you want to work on it now however, QgsProjectFileTransform sounds 
like the path to go.

I reckon it was removed mainly because it cluttered the readXml code in 
the classes.

Yes I was having the same issue over the weekend with the API docs. I will take a poke around on the server later to see if I can figure out what is up.

By docker, you mean following
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation#building-the-documentation-using-docker
, I found the instructions minimalist and my attempt years earlier on
Windows had not been successful. Or do you have another recipe? I can see
we have one in the qgis-website readme. I could give it a shot later.
About pdf, I've never built it myself. So no idea.

While not necessarily what would bring new writers to the team, having easy
to build instructions could be of help when good times come ;)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Integration of Zoo and QGIS
Message-ID: <548B5937-C67B-4FEC-BEE0-8763561B28AF@kartoza.com>

Dear QGIS devs

During the FOSS4G I had a nice catch up with Gérald Fenoy from the ZOO project. He had some interesting suggestions about integrating ZOO and QGIS. The benefit? The addition of many more processing algorithms to our collection. There are different alternatives we could look into but the main interesting ideas I think are:

1. Exposing QGIS 3 Server as a WPS server, making all the algorithms available in WPS via ZOO. I remember 3LIZ was working on WPS support in v2 but I dont know what the state of WPS options in QGIS 3 is.
2. Using ZOO as a WPS client in QGIS and wrapping the algorithms we find as local processing algs.
3. Potentially using ZOO as a WPS server running locally and exposing the algs they support to the processing framework

Is anybody interested in pursuing the idea of ZOO integration? Would you like to join us for a call to better understand the possibilities? If so please let me know and I will set up a call.

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

David Marteau has ported QGIS 3 Processing framework to Web as WPS.

A presentation has been made during the Foss4g 2019: WPS with Qgis 
processing - From desktop to server
* the stream 
https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-306-wps-with-qgis-processing-from-desktop-to-server 
or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL1tdcJwimA

Here is the code source https://github.com/3liz/py-qgis-wps
and the docker source https://github.com/3liz/docker-qgis-wps

Regards,

René-Luc

Just be aware that if you're thinking of restoring this code in master
-- it's extremely unlikely to be accepted. You'd need to instead port
it to a python plugin and take on the related maintenance burden
yourself.

Hi Jürgen,

thanks for your help, it works.

It poses another closely related question: The `initializationCompleted`
signal is only emitted once. If the plugin is loaded together with QGIS,
this is fine. However, if it is loaded later, maybe because it is
installed by a user from within a running QGIS process, the plugin does
not receive this signal. QGIS must be restarted for the plugin to work.
Is there a way to figure out whether this signal has already been
emitted in the past (for the current QGIS process) / the initialization
has been completed?

Sebastian

I realize the topic hasn't brought much attention a year ago, but things
are getting more real, and Qt 6 is about to be branched [0] -- no, no, not
released, just branched ;)

No changes since Nyall's email:
> Qt6 is expected to be released in late 2020 as an evolutionary
advancement over Qt5 with less breakage compared to the Qt4 to Qt5
transition.

Nyall estimated some timeline at late 2021 - mid 2022 for QGIS 4.0 release.

One major topic is to decide wether we stick to PyQt6 or if we look towards
PySide2. This is for sure not a trivial discussion, and cannot be decided
without a deeper look and understanding.

But before going into technical details, I think that we anticipate as much
as we can and ideally have this handled by a dedicated group who could
propose and defend an action plan and timeline. What PSC thinks about this?
Do you have any plan already?

Cheers,
Denis

thanks for looking into this. It is good and IMHO reassuring for the
users that we are looking ahead.
no plans have been laid out, you're free to put forward your suggestions.
PyQt has often been a PITA, I believe alternatives should be researched
carefully.
Cheers.

Hi all,
For a few days now, I have been trying to setup PyQt and QGIS without much
success. So I have tried to create a ui using QT designer and from there
create my python file using pyuic5:
When I go to run it in PyCharm, I get the following:
No module named 'qgsfilewidget'

And the error is coming from:
from qgsfilewidget import QgsFileWidget

Could some please tell me how to setup PyCharm with QGIS please as I am
unable to find anything useful on google.

Thanks
Le gach dea ghui,

Hi Shane,   
are you using Linux or other systems?  
  
Here there are my notes on how to configure PyCharm for pyqgis development from when I used PyCharm and Gnome: [https://marioba.gitlab.io/blog/post/2018-04-12-pyqgis-autocompletion-pycharm/](https://marioba.gitlab.io/blog/post/2018-04-12-pyqgis-autocompletion-pycharm/)  
  
I Hope that helps.  
  
Cheers   
Mario

Hi,

You should try:
from qgis.gui import QgsFileWidget
It's in the GUI library: https://qgis.org/api/classQgsFileWidget.html

For PyCharm on Ubuntu, I used the normal launcher. Then I have setup a venv
called "QGIS3" that I can use in all my plugins and project related to
QGIS. In the venv, I added
/home/etienne/dev/qgis/build/master/output/python
to my interpreter paths. It works well for autocompletation. You may need
to restart pycharm and/or to force PyCharm to scan these libraries.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Raster calculator problems
Message-ID: <CV9.2EtuM.610l2zpBhio.1TRuNW@seznam.cz>

Dear All,



I am dealing with raster calculator issue and I am not quite sure about the 
algorithm of this tool, it seems that it somehow does not work in way I 
would liked to. I discussed this issue on GIS stackexchange and people 
assumed that the sytax is correct. The version of QGIS I am using is 3.8.0.,
also I've tried to use previous releases but none worked.




The thing is that I have a 1-band geotif raster and I use following syntax 
in order to create output raster where values from the 1-band raster 
represents following table. In other words, I have a raster layer with 
values ranging from 0.00597303 to 0.102894 and I want to assign specific 
number representing a group to specific range of values:



 Group 4: x >= 0.1



Group 3: 0.01 <= x < 0.1

Group 2: x < 0.01

I am using the following syntax: 

("Ri_Q50 at 1" >= 0.1) * 4 + (("Ri_Q50 at 1" >= 0.01) AND ("Ri_Q50 at 1" < 0.1)) * 3 
+ ("Ri_Q50 at 1" < 0.01) * 2




But the output is not quite what I am looking for - I think that raster 
calculator should be suitable to do this job.




I don't know what else could be the problem then my unsufficient knowladge 
of the algorithm of raster calculator.




I would be very greatful for any kind of advice.

Thank you very much for help, I appreciate that.

Kind regards

Václav

Hi all,

 I'm writing about the status of the qProf plugin.
Its main purpose is to help create geological profiles.
As such, the topographic profile is fundamentally the base to add:
- geological attitudes
- lineaments intersections
- outcrop (polygon) intersections
- topographic traces projections on the profile.
I am not sure whether these tools are really needed in a topographic profile tool.
Currently, I am rewriting the code, in order to allow to create geological profiles directly in a Jupyter notebook (no QGIS libraries use). The GUI will be created afterward and tested in a standalone Python app, and at the end, everything would be inserted in the qgSurf plugin as an additional module. 
The qProf plugin per se could be then deprecated and is currently in bug-fix mode.

mauro

Message-ID: <9be11846bf214bd19edf0ad35a89e1f0@C119S212VM042.msvyvi.vaha.local>

Hi,

I followed the recording from FOSS4G 2019 about the new features in OL 6 https://media.ccc.de/v/bucharest-337-openlayers-6-there-and-back-again. At time 16:35 there is a slide that states "Use only geographic coordinates (WGS 84) in the API". I wonder if such change would make it difficult to work with the Polar coordinate systems like those used in the Arctic SDI geoportal https://geoportal.arctic-sdi.org/ (press the World icon under the scale slider for selecting your favourite). Do we need to be worried?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How do I define a marker offset with an expression.
Message-ID: <A87E66F06E86F14B857F2EB047CDF932313992B7@prdassexch01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All

I am trying to offset a marker (ellipse or simple marker).  I can easily do this by entering values into the Offset x and y fields (eg 20.0, 30.0 mm).

However I haven't figured out how to enter this as an expression.  I have entered an expression as "array(20.0,30.0)" but the symbol remains at its unadjusted offset.

Have I got the expression syntax entered incorrectly?

Thanks
Chris

The array format is supported, but only from 3.10. For earlier
versions, use a string like '3,4'

Hi
After upgrading my local installation in W10, attempting to open qgis-dev-bin-gPress.exe to do some bug testing, the application fails to open, and I get the error "Could not load qgis_app.dll" because "The specified module could not be found", and the advice to "Check C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\qgis-dev-bin-gPress.env for correct environment paths".
I have had similar issues before after upgrading, and I have previously managed to fix it manually, but so far not this time.
C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\qgis-dev-bin-gPress.env did not exist. The closest thing was C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\qgis-bin-g7.env. So, I edited the text of that one, replacing instances of "apps\qgis" with "apps\qgis-dev", including in the top line, "PATH=C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\qgis-dev\bin", because there is a qgis_app.dll file in the OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis\bin folder, and then I saved that with the new file name qgis-dev-bin-gPress.env.
This did not work, so I tried re-installing all the desktop applications in the OSGeo4W64 installer, but still get the same error.
I suppose the "PATH=C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\qgis-dev\bin" statement in the .env folder is not actually setting a PATH variable. I'm not sure what it is doing, really - just describing what should be in the PATH maybe? If so, my edit and saving the qgis-dev-bin-gPress.env file will make no difference to anything.
I have tried a few other things, like putting a line, "path %PATH%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\bin" into a .bat that ends by starting qgis-dev-bin-gPress.exe - does that line set the PATH variable? Anyway, it didn't work - same error message.
Any ideas please?
Thanks
Steve

Apologies - There was a typo in my message. Where it says "because there is a qgis_app.dll file in the OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis\bin folder", it should say the "qgis-dev\bin" folder - the qgis_app.dll file is in there, too.

I'm new to GIS but i've already a signifiant experience in development. I
work on new project. We're trying to use the power of Qgis to create a GIS
tool for our commercial team. QGis is istalled from OSGeo4W (3.8), Python
(3.7) and PyQt (from pip) are installed too.

Correctly set PYTHONPATH :

set PYTHONPATH=C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis\python

When i try to run my python script (copied from the official documentation
"PyQGIS Developper Cookbook"), we've got an error :

from qgis.core import *
# Supply path to qgis install
locationQgsApplication.setPrefixPath("C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis", True)
# Create a reference to the QgsApplication.  Setting the# second
argument to False disables the GUI.
qgs = QgsApplication([], False)
# Load providers
qgs.initQgis()
# Write your code here to load some layers, use processing# algorithms, etc.
# Finally, exitQgis() is called to remove the# provider and layer
registries from memory

qgs.exitQgis()

Erreur :

ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 n’est pas une application Win32 valide.

Could you maybe help me ?

Hi

These notes are for QGIS 2.x but the process should be similar:

Hope that helps

We ship a similar file - except that it's called python-qgis.bat (or
python-qgis-dev.bat, python-qgis-ltr.bat etc.) and drops you into the python
command line (unless you pass a script as argument).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] attribute join questions
Message-ID: <CAOM0XWBocGTEBNbqb11kUpBz_+UcBg9qwm14vqGU+jkcHemqVw@mail.gmail.com>

Greeting everyone,

I had an idea and wanted to see i it was good or not.

I have been thinking about ways to improve our joining algs. This proposal
mostly apply to the attribute table join. I want to improve the spatial
join too to reach speed similar to esri's but I'm not sure how they do it.

I thought that we could possibly speed up and provide more flexibility by
using hashes, this way we could also multi-attribute join ( as it was
recently implemented for the table join).

The idea would be to get the desired field (or fields) in the selected
order. Make a QHash< QVarList, QFeatureIds>. This would require to go
through both features once for mapping and another time for
extraction/joining. We could also cache the full list of selected
attributes instead of the featureids but this would take up more memory but
prevent the extraction step.

Is that a good idea or is it more wasteful/slow that the current
implementation?

Message-ID: <A87E66F06E86F14B857F2EB047CDF9323139D73F@prdassexch01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Title pretty much is the question - I'm building QGIS development build on ubuntu as per instructions in INSTALL.

I think the thing I need to register with designer is libqgis-customwidgets.so.   But that doesn't seem to be built as part of the CMake build (can't find the file anywhere), and the only reference to it I can find is in the debian directory as a package.  I'm not familiar enough with packaging to figure out how it gets built or what source files are used :-(

Any help would be great - I am building on a virtual machine with source code in a mounted directory.

Thanks for any guidance
Chris

Hi Chris,

First thing is to run CMake with -DWITH_CUSTOM_WIDGETS

Then the resulting library needs to be copied into the folder where Qt 
loads its plugins from.

Hi all,

I have a plugin that depends on the `initializationCompleted` signal
from the `iface` object for initialization. It only works properly if
the QGIS interface is completely initialized.

Problem: My plugin can be loaded after `initializationCompleted` has
been triggered, e.g. if it is installed or activated by a user sometimes
later. The user then has to restart QGIS for the plugin to work. I want
to get rid of the confusing necessity of a restart.

How can I determine whether `initializationCompleted` has been triggered
in the past and/or whether the QGIS interface is completely initialized?

Best regards,
Sebastian

Hi all,

if I'm not wrong there was a way to prevent the raster legend to be
shown in the layout composer, saving a lot of loading time if the raster
is very big with a "complex" legend.

Was I dreaming? :)

Cheers and thanks

	Questions
Message-ID: <CALTr1wD_EqfmzL-Nt7OeDpjmOsqr=rJkgHdzkPEMr8ONabJTYw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Developers,

Please forgive me if this is not the best way to reach out to y'all, and
please do let me know if so.

I am a current college senior majoring in CS at Tufts University, located
near Boston, USA. For my engineering degree, I need to complete a year-long
senior capstone project. Now, I am a huge fan of free software and maps,
and I have been programming for the past two years on C/C++/Python. I
stumbled upon QGIS upon searching possible projects, and have been thinking
wildly about devoting my last school year to contributing to its
development. I have been fiddling around with QGIS for the past couple of
days, and will take a couple more until I get the basic hang of it.

I currently have a team of a couple of CS students including myself, an
applied math major student, and might possibly have a human factors
engineering student. The only caveat right now is that we need a project
"sponsor" who would simply have to communicate with my team and give
feedbacks/guidance.

We would really appreciate if anyone can suggest a cool year-long
project/idea, while we also would be searching for our own.* More
importantly, is there anyone who can possibly be our project sponsor? *Please
let me know if so. Thank you for your time.

With best regards,
Eric Park

Hi Eric, 

Thanks for reaching out about your college project. 

I am not a core developer but a contributor and power user. 

We normally have GSoC project almost every year, but I guess your setup
would also work well. I am positive that we can find a mentor (project
sponsor) to help you get started and for occasional support. But the
potential mentor probably depends a bit on the area of code you are
working on. 

Are you familiar with QGIS as a user? 

Areas in QGIS that would benefit from developer attention, are: 

- 3D (e.g. proper highlighting for feature identification and better
integration with 2D (e.g. show camera position in 2D, allow reposition
of camera in 2D)) 

- Creating a 3D model sharing repository 

- Processing, incl. the graphical model builder 

- ETL functionality in Processing 

- Integrating the QGIS time manager plugin in QGIS core 

- the Report builder (e.g. create a preview mode for reports) 

- the Georeferencer (support for georeferencing vector features) 

These are just some ideas ... of course it depends on your interests,
skills and more. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

But when I import with OSGEO4W shell it failed at this line:

I am using QGIS 3.8.2 and windows 7, python 3.7.0 32 bit on win32
I installed hdbscan 0.8.22 manually via python setup.py install

Any suggestions will be grateful, cheers.

Hi all

I'm still having problems installing the custom widgets into designer on ubuntu 18.04.  I've run make  and make install, and copied the custom widgets .so with

sudo cp libqgis_customwidgets.so.3.9.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer/libqgis_customwidgets.so

It is being found, in that when designer starts it now dies :-(  I think the problem is that it is not finding qgis.db, though there are other errors along the way.  Output when starting up is listed below.  QGIS itself starts up normally.

Still desperate for ideas!!!

Thanks
Chris

Hi Chris,

First thing is to run CMake with -DWITH_CUSTOM_WIDGETS

Then the resulting library needs to be copied into the folder where Qt
loads its plugins from.

But that doesn't seem to be built as part of the CMake build (can't find the file anywhere), and the only reference to it I can find is in the debian directory as a package.  I'm not familiar enough with packaging to figure out how it gets built or what source files are used :-(

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] using a features subset as an input for a
	processing alg
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xorRV556VPsYmcASc8xO_F8W9-JJGq15TL-AJyJ1vqwg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I was confident that it would have been simple, while I can’t find the
proper way od doing that. Having a reference to a QgsVectorLayer, I would
need to use a subset of its features to run an algorithm down the line.
I hoped there was a way to define an input as afeature source with a filter
(QgsFeatureRequest or similar. I’ve tried using
QgsProcessingFeatureSourceDefinition with a selection but with no luck:

pointlayer.selectByRect(rect, QgsVectorLayer.SetSelection)

processing.run("qgis:voronoipolygons", {
         'INPUT': QgsProcessingFeatureSourceDefinition(
                    pointlayer.id(),
                    True),
         'BUFFER': 10,
         'OUTPUT': outpath})

error, can’t find the layer with that id, since it expects to find it
in the proje

Any ideas? Is it possible to build a QgsProcessingParameterDefinition
for the task?

Cheers,
Giovanni

Howdy Andreas,

Thank you much for getting back to me so quickly. I am currently on the
learning curve, trying to get myself familiar to the entire software. It
will probably take a bit of time for me to go over most features in the
program.

>From the topics you've listed, the 3D project definitely interests me a
lot, since I've been practicing and programming computer graphics project
using OpenGL for the past couple of months. On that note, if you or anybody
can advise or guide me sporadically throughout the year, that would be very
much appreciated. Please let me know about it. Thank you so much again!

Best,
Eric Park

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] UI ideas to fix opening of certain OSM files

I've started work on creating a PR for htis, but I am a bit confused by the
number of potential classes I could use and tying the calls together. It
seems like I could use one (or all of) QgsDataProvider::ProviderOptions,
QgsVectorLayer::LayerOptions or QgsDataProvider::ProviderProperty
(with QgsDataProvider::providerProperty
and QgsDataProvider::setProviderProperty. Have they all been added at
different times, or are they meant for different use cases? There doesn't
seem to be a path from the UI all the way through to the GDAL calls so I
presume that no one has done this before? It seems like something that
should be available as an option.

Thanks in advance

Stephen

Hi Eric, 

I am just a QGIS user and contributor, occasional Python programmer. I
am sorry, I can't mentor you in C++ development. However, I do think,
that, if you are interested in 3D development, that there is a large
range of possible improvements you can work on. 

The persons to ask about mentoring are the developers from
LutraConsulting (Martin Dobias, Peter Petrik) - there might be others.
We just recently had a Google summer of code project for improvements in
3D - see
https://github.com/ismailsunni/QGIS/wiki/GSoC-2019---QGIS-3D-Improvement


It would be nice, if your project would have similar results for
improving the QGIS project. 

As I mentioned, here are some potential improvements I can see about 3D
(I am sure other people have additional ideas): 

- Proper highlighting of objects when using the "Identify features"
tool: either stroke polygon edges with a hightlight color or show a 3D
bounding box in the highlight color 

- Allow setting camera position in 2D view for 3D view 

- Support of animated objects: moving objects, such as cars, boats, etc.


- 3D bookmarks (storing camera position and viewing angle) 

- integration with time manager 

- texture support for objects 

- build a repository for sharing 3D object models (such as buildings,
trees, benches, other objects) 

I am sure there are more ideas. 3D in QGIS is still young and that means
a lot of features are still missing. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Best QGIS Devs,

We from OnTheLink created a script that installs QGIS on linux enabled
chromebooks, you will need to have a stable internet connection before
using it because most times it fails without one...

It currently is only functional on Linux enabled chromebooks but we may add
support for all linux devices in the future.


Link to the instructions: QGIS Instructions
<https://github.com/onthelink-nl/scripts/blob/master/qgis/MUFU/Tutorials/INSTRUCTIONS/QGIS%20Instructions.pdf>
Link to the github: Our GitHub <https://github.com/onthelink-nl/scripts>


We would like this to become an official script instead of a unofficial
script, if you have any questions about us or OnTheLink
<https://onthelink.nl> please let us know by e-mailing us on
info at onthelink.nl



Thanks in advance,

Greetings,
Team OnTheLink

Hi Eric,

As Andreas said, if you have student status, GSoC is a really great way to
contribute to the project. It offers you the opportunity to get mentors and
the stipend also. Unfortunately, GSoC is finished for this year. You can
apply again around March next year (assuming Google continues the project).

Regarding QGIS 3D, Tim Sutton has compiled some interesting improvement
ideas here [1]. You can also find some interesting ideas in from this year
GSoC Ideas [2].

Thank you much for getting back to me so quickly. I am currently on the

QGIS is really big. I think it's better to focus on some parts, rather than
checking all of the features :)

Best regards

Hi

Another area that could really use a lot of love is the reporting framework. Nyall has a great start in place but there are a long list of features that would take if from ‘great’ to ’top notch’. @Nyall could we share your google doc brain dump of reporting TODO’s here?

Regards

Tim

I'd say a GREAT project would be adding support for point cloud data
to QGIS + QGIS 3D. It'd be a lot of fun, you'd get to know a lot of
useful libraries (like PDAL), you'd learn a lot about hot-topic
technology, and you'd learn a lot about the internals of how QGIS (and
other GIS) work. And you'd be adding a feature which is highly
desirable to a huge number of QGIS users.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Build error: qgsspatialiteprovider.cpp
	undefined reference to `sqlite3_column_table_name'

After some googling, it turned out that sqlite should be compiled with
SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA preprocessor flag as mentioned in
https://sqlite.org/compile.html. It would be very useful if this detail is
added to the installation instructions. After this fix,  QGIS build
successfully completed.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Plugin Manager can not see prod and testing plugin
Message-ID: <a5fa5e64d1134d2ea06bde591cb1c43d@SCPEX2K13-1.scp.fr>

Dear all,

I am developing a plugin and I want to install a testing version and a production version on QGIS desktop.

I have a « testing » local repository and a « production » local repository.
QGIS Plugin Manager only shows one of the two plugins in the install view.
I can see my production plugin when I remove the testing repository from the plugin manager settings, and I can see my testing plugin when I remove the production repository.

How does the Plugin Manager detects that the two plugins are the same ?
They have different names, zip names, and versions.

QGIS 3.4.9
Windows 10

Thanks,
Best Regards

Thank y'all so much for the inputs. This is honestly my first time ever
reaching out to an open source community as a developer and I am grateful I
did. I will discuss the topics with my professor, but regardless of if it
gets approved or not, I am willing to work on the 3D improvements for QGIS
whatsoever - sounds like a lot of fun.

Andreas and Ismail: thank you again for the suggestions and referring to
the people:)
Tim and Nyall: would it be okay for me to reach out for a bit of guidance
in the very near future?

Best,
Eric Park

Hi Eric

I would be also happy to help if you decide to work on QGIS 3D. Here's
my recent presentation about the current state of QGIS 3D:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LQSTbWx1VrkCGbzXs7cSDmrHUgZP2NnGRHglK81uo8o/edit?usp=sharing

There's also a wish list at the end, and the point cloud support Nyall
suggested sounds like a very good idea to work on :-)

Cheers
Martin

Message-ID: <CA+Ei1Oc-6FpexDAKO-0EU01-o9qFKcr+X4WGLSNEaj+WkjVLkg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to ask whether is it possible to upload into official
plugin repository a plugin without English localization and
documentation. I recently found out that one Polish-only plugin has
been approved. There are few Czech-only plugins developed under my
supervision which could be uploaded. I haven't asked since I thought
that English localization + documentation is required.

Thanks for clarifying, Martin

as a general rule plugins should be in English and if possible
translatable. There are a few exceptions, especially for plugin useful
to access local data, where it makes sense to have a local language.
What we are always asking is at least an English description, to allow
users to decide whether a plugin could fit their needs, or perhaps is
worth investigating the code for a similar problem.
Cheers.

That unique identifier is the Python module name (i.e. the directory name). 
The 
zip file name should be either:
directory_name.zip
directory_name.optional_suffix.zip

Thus, what really counts is the file name *until the first dot*. If you have 
two 
zip files with different suffixes (after a dot), they are considered the same 
plugin. Please note the plugin name (that human-readable name) doesn't really 
matter for the installer/manager.

Plugin Manager doesn't fully support multiple versions, however, it can 
support two, using the <experimental> tag:

Production:
	<file_name>myplugin.foo.zip</file_name>
	<version>1.0</version>
	<experimental>False</experimental>

Dev:
	<file_name>myplugin.bar.zip</file_name>
	<version>1.1</version>
	<experimental>True</experimental>

Plugin Manager always offers the highest available version, thus for users 
with 
experimental plugins enabled it will be 1.1, and for those with experimental 
plugins disabled it will be 1.0.

Best regards,
Borys

I am, sure! (I can give general guidance, but for anything solely
within the 3d realm you'll need Martin's help too.)

It depends if you can get away with a layer subset string for the
filter. (I.e. provider side filter). Because if so, you can embed
these filters in layer sources, e.g.

   processing.run("native:centroids",
{'INPUT':'/home/me/layer.shp|layerid=0|subset=\"something\" =
\'value\'','ALL_PARTS':False,'OUTPUT':'TEMPORARY_OUTPUT'})

Would be nice to extend QgsProcessingFeatureSourceDefinition to
support an expression based filter, that sounds like a good
addition...

This is not true, see for example http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/inspireNL/.
Both description and about are non English as well as UI, but plugin was
approved years ago and new versions still get approval.

Asking, not necessarily obtaining. Unfortunately managing hundreds of plugins takes a lot of my spare time, so something falls into the cracks.
Thanks for noticing, could you please open a ticket?
Cheers.

Is an English description in the repository sufficient?

The reason I'm asking is that we are currently developing a localized 
plugin and it would be nice to show the localized description in the 
plugin manager, so our "localized" users get the information in their 
preferred language (and I don't think we can provide translated plugin 
descriptions?).

Thanks for clarification

Maybe it's time to reconsider a support for localized tags in the repository?

The plugin manager displays localized 'description' and 'about' tags from the 
metadata.txt: 

description=Hello world
description[it]=Ciao mondo

thus for already installed plugins only. It's easy to add a ?lang= parameter 
to the request, but I don't know how big deal would be to implement it in the 
repository (especially storing all those optional tag variants in the 
database). Unfortunately personally I never had time to dive into the 
repository stuff.

Regards,
Borys

That unique identifier is the Python module name (i.e. the directory name). 
The
zip file name should be either:
directory_name.zip
directory_name.optional_suffix.zip

Thus, what really counts is the file name *until the first dot*. If you have two zip files with different suffixes (after a dot), they are considered the same plugin. Please note the plugin name (that human-readable name) doesn't really matter for the installer/manager.

Plugin Manager doesn't fully support multiple versions, however, it can support two, using the <experimental> tag:

Production:
	<file_name>myplugin.foo.zip</file_name>
	<version>1.0</version>
	<experimental>False</experimental>

Dev:
	<file_name>myplugin.bar.zip</file_name>
	<version>1.1</version>
	<experimental>True</experimental>

Plugin Manager always offers the highest available version, thus for users with experimental plugins enabled it will be 1.1, and for those with experimental plugins disabled it will be 1.0.

Best regards,
Borys

Hi,

It is possible to see the plugin version number (from the metadata file) when you open the manage plugins window and select a plugin.

Is it possible to retrieve this version number using Python in the plugin itself?

It's not really very important but I just want to be able to include it in messages; so for example, "You have successfully upgraded to version..." or being able to automatically include the version number in bug reporting.

I did try an internet search but it just comes up with people looking for the version of Python rather than the actual version of the plugin itself.

Thanks in advance,
Paul

Unfortunately no, since my filter is a spatial filter (a rectangle in this
case, but it's not relevant).
I fear I will have to create my own voronoi algorithm.

from qgis.utils import pluginMetadata
pluginMetadata('db_manager', 'version')

In (a rare) case it doesn't meet your needs (e.g. the plugin you examine is not loaded), you 
can alternatively parse the metadata.txt file on your own, using Pyton's 
configparser.ConfigParser

Hi Paul,

I do not think it is supported now, but a workaround could be:

- Add a variable 'version' with the plugin version number to your plugin 
class.

- Then do:
qgis.utils.plugins['your plugin name'].version


You could even write a version() function that reads the version number 
from the metadata.txt to prevent redundancy.

I wonder if there is another way though..

Kind regards,
Raymond

Subject: [QGIS-Developer]  Plugin Manager looks for icon in http://
Message-ID: <916b0b4df7a940f287b98f5036ec0464@SCPEX2K13-1.scp.fr>

Dear all,

I have a local repository for my plugins, with the icon path for each plugin in the corresponding tag of the xml.

Example :

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<?xml-stylesheet  type="text/xsl" href="./plugins.xsl" ?>
<plugins>
  <pyqgis_plugin name="my great plugin" version="1.2">
    [...]
    <icon>icons/my_great_plugin/icon.png</icon>
    [...]
  </pyqgis_plugin>
</plugins>

The problem is that the Plugin Manager is looking for the path http://icons/my_great_plugin/icon.png when the plugin is not yet installed.
I can force my deployment script to write an absolute path in the <icon> tag, with the file:// protocol, but then the Plugin Manager looks for http://file://C:/my_abs_path/icons/my_great_plugin/icon.png<http://file:/C:/my_abs_path/icons/my_great_plugin/icon.png>

When the plugin is installed, everything works good.
Any idea ?

Thanks a lot,
Best regards

Agreed, this would be a good improvement. A suitable project for QGIS grants.
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Plugin Manager looks for icon in http://
In-Reply-To: <916b0b4df7a940f287b98f5036ec0464@SCPEX2K13-1.scp.fr>
References: <916b0b4df7a940f287b98f5036ec0464@SCPEX2K13-1.scp.fr>
Message-ID: <4914503.aAlaMYqQZH@debian>

Initially, the manager was only supporting http:// repositories. Then we added 
support for local ones, and we apparently missed the fact the icon protocol is 
hardcoded instead of following the "main" protocol. See:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/pyplugin_installer/
installer_data.py#L411

Would you mind to fix it by yourself and make a pull request? Otherwise I can 
do it but probably not in the upcoming days or weeks.

From what I tested so far, it seems for the file:// protocol rather than 
adding the protocol prefix, the icon variable should stay as it was (just the 
path). I didn't succeeded to make it working with the prefix. So maybe the 
prefix should be only added to the http and https protocols. Something like:

if icon and not icon.startswith("http"):
    if QUrl(self.mRepositories[reposName]["url"]).scheme() == 'http':
        icon = "http://{}/{}".format(
			QUrl(self.mRepositories[reposName]["url"]).host(), icon)
    elif QUrl(self.mRepositories[reposName]["url"]).scheme() == 'https':
       icon = "https://{}/{}".format(
          QUrl(self.mRepositories[reposName]["url"]).host(), icon)


It's been tested on Linux, but needs a test on Windows, as there is usually a 
difference in the number of expected slashes at the beginning of the path ;)

Btw. if you want to see the plugin metadata sent from the installer (Python 
backend) to the manager (C++ GUI), you can catch it here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/pyplugin_installer/
installer.py#L197

Borys

Thank you so much, Nyall and Martin. I will get back to you in a couple
weeks when I will actually start. Meanwhile, I probably will explore more
of the application features on QGIS and specify my project idea. Hope y'all
have a good weekend!

Best,
Eric Park

Message-ID: <CAB900JUkbxKWi9iUDJwndnwjDXU7aiH82=CFeW0VQ-ZCcWBB5w@mail.gmail.com>

QGIS Layer List upgrade to V3 C++ plugin - Geographic Information Systems
Stack Exchange <style>body,.top-bar{margin-top:1.9em}</style>

I was upgrading a c++ plugin that I had used in the past and almost
eliminated all the the usual compiler errors due to version changes
according for the current version (3.6). The plugin used to collect current
map canvas layers in a combo list box for selection. I am getting two
errors that I can't figure out what to do with. This code compiled without
problem pre-2.0.

The first happens to be about QGSMapLayer that can't be instantiated
because it is turned as an abstract class and I am getting an error
[Severity Code Description Project File Line Source Suppression State Error
C2259 'QgsMapLayer': cannot instantiate abstract class tarjan_sccplugin
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Qt5\include\QtCore\qlist.h 214 Build ]

This is portion of the code generating the error.  Where cmbNetSourceLayer
is a combo-box .

void tarjan_sccGui::populateLayers( QString const& url ) {
cmbNetSourceLayer->clear();

QString layerName; QString layerType;

// fill list of layersQMap<QString, QgsMapLayer*> mapLayers =
QgsProject::instance()->mapLayers();QMap<QString,
QgsMapLayer*>::iterator layer_it = mapLayers.begin();
for (; layer_it != mapLayers.end(); ++layer_it){
    QgsVectorLayer* vl = dynamic_cast<QgsVectorLayer*>(layer_it.value());
    if (!vl)
        continue;
    else

     cmbNetSourceLayer->addItem(vl->name() );}

The second error appears to be in explicit declaration for the plugin.
Something has changed in how the plugins are initiated. [Severity Code
Description Project File Line Source Suppression State Error (active)
invalid explicit instantiation declaration tarjan_sccplugin
d:\GIS\v3\Quantum-GIS\src\core\qgsoptionalexpression.h 82 IntelliSense ]

No idea what must be done to overcome this error.  The cited module appears
to be an optional data module.


Any help is appreciated.

Using ' --config GDAL_HTTP_UNSAFESSL YES', as suggested in GDAL mailing

This does not happen in QGIS compiled against older versions of GDAL. For
instance, I've QGIS LTR in a Linux machine, compiled against GDAL 2.2.2,
and the same dataset loads ok. The same in the CLI.

So, I assume that the SSL certificates are only checked in most recent
versions of GDAL (for sure > 2.2.2).

In this way, how can QGIS deal with that? Maybe inserting an option to get
the curl library to skip SSL host / certificate verification
(GDAL_HTTP_UNSAFESSL)? Or maybe that would not be a good politic, skipping
SSL verification...

Thank you very much!

Pedro Venâncio

Hi,

I can't really answer your question but you should use
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsMapLayerComboBox.html instead of creating your
own combobox. (if possible).

Hi all,

The hackfest has gone for weeks, but QGIS is still there as well as writers
and developers. So I wonder if someone had considered the opportunity to
give a hand on any of the identified issues.

*NB: It could not be for the "Spare Time Inc" since we still have
unallocated funds (and not "founds" - damn keyboard).*

Harrissou

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] windows build qsci dll issues
Message-ID: <CAOM0XWBRHk6eg24P=97gBKjxhaSLMSh2Z9E6WeQLZv2U1E34iA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I've been trying to build on windows and I'm having issues with python. I
have set the python exe in cmake to the python 3.7 in osgeo apps (and not
the python3 in bin since that was causing issues), the pythonpath and
pythonhome also point to the python in osgeo/bin but when it comes time to
execute "from PyQt5.Qsci import..." I get a dll error.

I have used pip to download qscintilla and the sip bindings again, but this
did not change anything.

Has anyone else had that issue? Where is this dll so that I can add it to
my Path environment?

Thanks

Alex

I can't help with this particular issue. But for reference, here's my
"just works" from-scratch Windows build process, using Qt Creator. No
warranty, zero support! If it works for you it works ;)

Rough notes only...

- I install MS Visual Studio community 2015, just the c++ language
related parts (using
http://download.microsoft.com/download/D/2/3/D23F4D0F-BA2D-4600-8725-6CCECEA05196/vs_community_ENU.exe)

- I install cmake (64 bit) and add that to the windows path

- I download ninja and shove ninja.exe in c:\program files\cmake\bin
(yep - can't get this to work otherwise!)
- I use cygwin (64 bit) to install flex and bison
- I use osgeo4w 64 bit, installed to the default location. I use this
to install qgis-dev-deps

- I personally install WSL and ubuntu for windows, and use that for
git and stuff. It won't affect things, but I find it easier to use
this to get sipify etc up and running because I can just use ubuntu
bash commands...

In qt creator kits:
- Qt versions: manually add C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Qt5\bin\qmake.exe
- Compilers: should autodetect the msvc stuff, e.g. Microsoft Visual
C++ Compiler 14.0 (x86) under C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual
Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat x86 . Should be about 14 entries here,
automatically populated
- Debuggers: Should autodetect C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows
Kits\10\Debuggers\x86\cdb.exe and C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows
Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\cdb.exe
- Cmake: should autodetect C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.exe ,
otherwise manually add it

Kits:
- manually add a new kit:
  - compiler: set both c and c++ to Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 14.0
(x86_amd64) (make sure it's the 64 bit one!)
- debugger and qt version: set to above ones
- cmake - set to system cmake, as above. Change generator to "ninja"
- Click "Change" next to environment, and insert:

GDAL_DATA=c:\osgeo4w64\share\gdal
GDAL_DRIVER_PATH=c:\osgeo4w64\bin\gdalplugins
PATH=c:\program
files\cmake\bin;C:\cygwin64\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python37;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python37\Scripts;c:\osgeo4w64\apps\qt5\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python37\sip\PyQt5\;${PATH}
PYTHONHOME=C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python37
PYTHONPATH=
QGIS_INSTALL_PATH=c:\osgeo4w64\apps\qgis-dev
QML2_IMPORT_PATH=C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Qt5\qml
QT_PLUGIN_PATH=C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-dev\qtplugins;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Qt5\plugins

Phew.
Now open the qgis project. In the cmake config, set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
to "RelWithDebInfo". Make sure your build environment looks good, i.e.
has the above entries.

Build! Cross fingers and close eyes...

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgVrctZrS1sSnjUr=vWBiLdbAy0r24O_V03YqL1LftssQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just a quick plea that during this freeze period please think
carefully about the suitability of backporting fixes to 3.4. At this
stage in its lifecycle 3.4 should only receive absolutely mission
critical fixes (such as crash fixes or data corruption issues).

The consequence of regressions in 3.4 caused by backporting minor bug
fixes much outweighs the benefits of fixing these bugs. While the
backport label makes 3.4 backports easy to do, it does not guarantee
their safety or suitability.

Thanks!

Is it easy to disable the auto backport and have it just create the pull

That's what it does -- it creates the PR, but the PR can't be merged
without someone (other than the original developer) approving it.

I'm seeing a lot of backports which the bot can't auto create over the
last week, where devs have manually backported... yet the validity of
the backport is questionable and I'd hate to see wasted effort going
into manual backports which won't be accepted.

While chasing a [crash at startup](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/31350)
I found that the --noplugins commandline switch does not prevent QGIS
from loading provider plugins from the plugins directory.

This mail is to ask if you think it should skip those plugins as well.

In my case a set of old/invalid plugins resulted in such crash.

So, what do you think, should I enhance --noplugins to skip those
loads as well ?

I think that the root of the confusion is that we call "plugins" three
different objects:
- python plugins
- data providers
- C++ plugins

I think that --noplugins should only skip python (and C++?) plugins and
frankly I don't see a use case for not loading data providers.

Agreed.

QGIS is still pretty powerful without plugins. Whereas QGIS is pretty 
much useless without providers.

Broken plugins are quite common. Broken providers something that only 
ever happens on a few dev machines.

I think disabling providers would turn something that is currently a 
last resort backup plan into a "break my QGIS completely" option.

If anything, a --noproviders option could be added, but I wonder if it's 
really worth the effort.

Best regards
Matthias

The use case would be this one I'm reporting: QGIS crashes, and users
are asked to run it in a "simplified" way to check if the crash is due
to some plugins.

There was another bug report for startup-crash which was filed
on May 21 2019 and never fixed (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/29930)

Anything that can improve debugging could be useful ?

Concerning changing the behaviour of --noplugins, my perception is, that 
there's a difference between user installed 3rd party plugins (much more 
likely to break the system) and a provider which is always deployed with 
QGIS itself and in 99.9% of all the cases rock solid.

As far as I can see, in this report it wasn't even requested to run with 
--noplugins.
> Anything that can improve debugging could be useful ?

Let's assume it would have actually been identified that it's a provider 
which caused the crash (which already is a question in itself). What 
would be the next step? Wouldn't it be easier to ask him to move the 
dlls one by one to another place to check if and which provider is 
responsible?

I won't block any work on a --noproviders parameter, I just wonder if 
it's really worth the effort.

Why am I so unlikely to always be in that 0.1% ? ...

You're right, Giovanni's hint was to actually _remove_ the plugins:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/29930#issuecomment-495908026

Yes, that's how it was fixed for me.

BTW, I noticed in code that a QGIS_PROVIDER_FILE env variable can be
set to contain a regexp matching provider plugins. If, as you say,
provider plugins are 99.9% shipped with QGIS, how about making that
file-pattern hard-coded to match actual plugins ? Because in my case
I think the crash came from loading a file not containing "provider"
in the name.

With a clean install I get 15 files under plugins/ matching *provider*
and 13 NOT matching it.

Effort seems low, using existing support for env variable.
The resulting QGIS is indeed pretty broken, and full of paths to other segfaults
(may be a good journey to take, fixing those ones).

PS: _static_ plugins would still be available...

I'm confused about the backport policy: do we want to backport
bugfixes to 3.8 branch as well or it doesn't matter, as long
as 3.4 is covered ?

If we assume that < 0.1% of all QGIS users are developers who compile

Not sure, I've never played with that. Might make sense. What does the 
commit message say from when it was introduced?

But actually, couldn't this existing variable be already used now to 
filter providers fine grained without an additional parameter?

Feel free to proceed with a parameter as well :)

You have a point...

I'm just thinking if we should have that variable default to
*provider*. Is there a use-case for third-party providers that would
break if we hard-coded a pattern ?

I don't remember exactly. It seems to be introduced for browser
debugging/development.

Hi Regis, Patrick,

I'm working on https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/26186
and trying to figure out what is supposed to create the
qgis_editor_widget_styles table which is queried by
QgsPostgresProvider::setEditorWidgets in
src/providers/postgres/qgspostgresprovider.cpp

One of you seem to have introduced the use of that table.
In current code I find the querier but not the creator,
can you shed any light ?

But just because there will be no more 3.8 releases (next stop 3.10) - before
we would have targeted both branches.

What strikes me is that QGIS is querying a table but never creates
that. The pointers found in that thread are not saying what's supposed
to create that table. I see possible optimizations implying schema
qualification, for example, but since I don't know what creates that
table I can't tell if schema can be predictable or we have to rely
on search_path to find it...

My (very shaky) understanding is that it's designed for some
administrator to setup in advance, and isn't exposed anywhere in QGIS
ui.

But - to be harsh - this kind of hidden, implementation specific,
feature is the kind of thing we should be extremely wary of. Without
any documentation or publicly accessible explanation of how it works
it's of extremely limited use to QGIS users. At the minimum it should
have been accompanied by a documentation PR explaining how it should
be used.

Googling "qgis_editor_widget_styles" gives no clues at all.

Message-ID: <CAL5Q671Ngfky9yTq2v=f1LgrytL_zfbDeLBJ86B6j_OJ-nkRjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm testing the WMS contextual legend feature in QGIS client and -
supposing that the expected behavior is that when zooming and panning the
canvas the legend should be reloaded to only show items related to what's
in the canvas (that I'm not 100% sure it is) - I cannot make it work, I
didn't find anything in the source code that perform this action.

Does anyone knows what's the expected beavior is and how it is supposed to
work?

Thanks.

I'm not sure I imprelented this for Regione Toscana many years ago... in
2.x code before legend refractory. There a combination of
getLegendGraphic + BBOX supported by server side serving the correct legend
image. But probably code is radically changed in that part, mainly due to
legend refractory. I would look for getLegendGraphic keyword.

The expected behaviour was to retrieve the legend image if BBOX changed
modifing it in the legend panel.

cheers

Thank you for the clarification.

I thy I have run into a local issue, it looks like it is working fine now.

There was an issue with the server but I fixed it.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Making QgsRasterLayerProperties class independent
 again from QgisApp instance
Message-ID: <CAHaTM5VFiuE3Vg1MaDouj2Q1uNgUbQFAZwFvATwZUFPwiFt+bA@mail.gmail.com>

In standalone applications, I am using the QgsRasterLayerProperties class
to manage rasters displayed in the map canvas.

However, since QGis 3.8, this class is no longer independent from the
QgisApp instance because the methode
QgisApp::instance()->askUserForDatumTransform() is called from the
QgsRasterLayerProperties instance.

As in my standalone applications, I don't have QgsApp instance (no need),
now this applications crash when the raster layer properties widget opens
...

So, after a look at the Qgis code, I am thinking about to make a PR to make
again the QgsRasterLayerProperties independant from the QgisApp instance. I
think it could be possible with a static method in the QgisApp class. I
have to work on it.

But before trying this solution, I would have your opinion if it makes sens
to go in this way.

Thanks.

Possibly -- but it's a band-aid solution only. There's a LOT of code
in the app library which will make assumptions that the QgisApp
instance is available, and that's why all this code is partitioned off
into the app library. app also has no stable API guarantees and you'll
continue to hit situations like this.

I'd suggest two possible alternative ways forward:

1. Use the stable api classes exposes through the gui library to
rebuild your own raster layer properties dialog
2. Submit a PR moving the raster layer properties class from app ->
gui and adding it to the stable API

Both approaches are more upfront work, but are paths to much less pain
and future breakage...

I agree. I'd actually call for dropping this whole support, and if
someone will cry to keep it we'll have someone to talk with about
moving this whole support to a plugin ?

I remember it was designed for implementing Inspire models. Not sure 
about the status of this project.

How about deprecating this functionality to drop it with QGIS 4 and 
starting with 3.12 raise a warning that this is deprecated functionality?

This will leave some lead time to jump in before deprecation and some 
lead time to react before removal.

Interesting. I'm copying this to Yves, he might be aware of who uses it and
react better than the Pr's author. If such a feature exists it would be
nice to advertise it and make sure it is self contained in qgis. Otherwise,
let's go for the deprecation warning and drop it in QGIS 4

Message-ID: <DB8PR02MB55479B1EB1B86788077859ABC8890@DB8PR02MB5547.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

Sorry if this is a bit of a simple question.

I have created a script in the processing toolbox and it opens a dialogue box when you double click on it (as you would expect). Given that many users may not understand or even open the processing toolbox I want to trigger the script using a button in my custom plugin.

I know you can use processing.run(script/model, parameters) but I don't know the parameters and I don't want to recreate the dialogue box in my plugin.

Is there a python command to simply trigger/open a process to run (replicate clicking on it in the toolbox)?

Thanks,
Paul

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_E4Dih-NFz+XU=qoE19gEGJJ1pH985cRPySBuPOEFfMng@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have reviewing Snapping documentation, and I have a couple of questions.

Is snapping map units connected to the project CRS units? It seems to be,
because when I turn the CRS off (No projection), the snapping map unit
became <unkknown>. However. using say EPSG:4326 (WGS 84), the snapping
options show either pixels or meters. I though it would have to do with the
measuring settings, but try to snap a point you can see that it's actually
using the Project units (decimal degrees)

Any idea of how it was supposed to work?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Hi all,

I have realized that the processing option to determine the default output
extension as moved to the advanced settings. What I find odd is that the
value type is an integer and the default values is now 0. Changing it to 1,
seems to make the default shapefiles.

If exists, where can I find the enumeration for default values? this needs

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Fwd: Raster Stretch and Clip to MinMax possible bug

Hi.

I'm trying to identify some pixels within a range of values across several
bands.
I though that using Stretch and Clip on an RGB composite would allow me to
find them, but I'm going through some unexpected behaviour that I cannot
really explain.
At times even using Stretch and Clip on singleband does not work as
expected.

You can see in the screenshot [1], I used the info tool to get a pixel
value and set all Min and Max accordingly, but nothing shows up on the
canvas.

Eventually by changing the range, some pixels are rendered, but those are
not always consistent with the values set as Min/Max.

Maybe I am missing something, or is this is a bug ?

QGIS 3.8.2 on Arch Linux

Cheers,
Stephane

Hi,

these options are not used anymore and should be removed. Correct extension now
determined automatically from the filename for file-based outputs.

you can get the dialog of the processing algorithm you want and use that...
hereafter a snippet

    dialog = processing.createAlgorithmDialog("model:AjustarRasterGCP",

Hi Alex,

Thanks for your fast answer.

Is there a way to control what happens in multi output files? Like split
vector layer, wher you can only select a output folder.

Thanks,

Alex

No, I think you can't.
People are changing the extension by editing the source code:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/317169/24505

Related ticket: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/28377

Alexandre, where did you find these options? I think they have been removed
a few months ago now.

For split vector layer and other similar algorithms output format is hardcoded
or defined by underlying 3rd party tool (e.g. WhiteBox Tools or TauDEM).

BTW, as far as I can see, this options already removed in master and probably
in 3.8 too.

It would be great to see a specification about that table.
For example it isn't clear in which schema such table should be found,
which makes it even harder to optimize its querying...

Hi,

Thank you for your answer as I think that has got me in the right direction. It will either be execAlgorithmDialog or the createAlgorithmDialog you reference.

Unfortunately I’m having a little trouble getting it to find the algorithm I’m trying to run at present but that led me to notice what might be a bug. Of course it might be intentional but execAlgorithmDialog returns False instead of None if it doesn’t find the algorithm. That in turn leads to an error message which appears accidental when you run the createAlgorithmDialog function.

I’ve created (probably badly) a pull request (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31899) to show the line I’m referring to.

It would be good to know how to actually setup and create that pull request correctly really but I never have time to get my head around all the processes involved. We work on Windows machines which Visual Studio so I never full trust the formatting etc but who knows it might be safe on such a small change.

Anyway, it would be useful to know if that is a bug or not and I’m sure I’ll work out why it didn’t find my script shortly so thanks for your help 😊

Paul

I know you can use processing.run(script/model, parameters) but I don't know the parameters and I don't want to recreate the dialogue box in my plugin.

Is there a python command to simply trigger/open a process to run (replicate clicking on it in the toolbox)?

Thanks,
Paul

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] OSGeo4W: python libraries missing when installing
	plugins
Message-ID: <80f4c87c7c853b6e5873524aa74c21c9.squirrel@webmail.tu-dortmund.de>

Hi there,

sorry for the cross-post, but I believe, that both sides should work
together on this issue.

When installing QGIS on Windows the normal way (which doesn't need
the user get to know about all those expert settings and libraries),
you'll quickly run into the problem of missing Python libraries when
installing a plugin. Numpy, SciPy or mathlib are the most common
ones, but there's also well know ones, which can't get installed
automatically on Windows.

Perhaps we should setup rules for plugin developers to inform OSGeo4W,
which plugins might be required. Perhaps we should just "grep" through
all the repositories and find all the imports?

But even then, QGIS on Windows doesn't automatically install the missing
libraries. And even if QGIS would do (setuptools, pip, whatever), the
OSGeo4W-install would lose track about this and we even might get into
version chaos.

So we need a bi-directional way between QGIS and OSGeo4W installer.
Perhaps QGIS (or an additional QGIS plugin, hehe) could trigger
OSGeo4W installer silently to download the packages needed. So it might
keep track of it.

Right now, it's often hard work, since not all the libraries needed
have been added to OSGeo4W. Sure, the girls & guys do their best work
to add the missing libs upon request, but even then, you need to be
aware, WHICH plugin you need and you need to install it outside of
QGIS (at best practice, even BEFORE the installation in QGIS stars
because it might make QGIS instable, crash or both).

How can I help?

Best regards,
Tobias

I personally feel that the libraries you mentioned ( Numpy, SciPy) should
always be installed without having to specifically request them.

True. But we need a solution for the other libs. I just wanted to try
the new plugin "RasterTools" and this message just popped up:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nltk'

numpy is a dependency of python3-gdal which is a dependency of qgis - so that's
always installed anyway.

SciPy is not a hard dependency, but is also installed with qgis-full (which is
what you want if you want more optional dependencies - eg. for plugins - and is
also what the standalone installer is made from).

mathlib and nltk however are not in OSGeo4W.

Hi Rosa,

You are right it's related. The commit was this one:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8997

Like otters already said, the Default Output vector extensions was no
longer working. The split vector layer hardcoded output extension changed
from shp to gpkg. Although I agree with the change, there might be cases
when users really need Shapefiles (or other file formats). Therefore I
decided to play with the algorithm file and submitted a PR to allow
selecting the output format from a small dropdown menu.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31910

Thanks all,
Alexandre Neto

Hello,

Thanks Nyall for your advice.

I have chosen to move the raster layer properties to the gui. As the widget
is very convenient, no reason to rebuild my own. Moreover, it appears there
is not a lot of code to change.
So I purpose this PR: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31942
The tests seem to pass for QGIS, and I have tried to import the
QgsRasterLayerProperties class to a standalone application only using the
gui library, it is ok.

Dear QGIS developers,

... has 167 layer groups
... is heavily styled (in fact, most of the information in the .qgs file are stylings)
... has a size of 53 MB (the .gqs file)
... loads the data from a PostGIS database

The main problem we are facing is, that the loading time of the .qgs file is between 10 and 15 Minutes (depending on the network traffic).
We don't need all the layers which are defined in the .qgs file immediately. In most cases, we just need a bunch of those layers at once.

Therefore, the question is, if QGIS provides a mechanism to postpone the initial loading of all layers from QGIS startup to the point in time when we actually need the layers? I.e., the layer structure is loaded but not the layer data.

Is there a build-in QGIS mechanism that allows loading only the needed layers from the .qgs file and write the appropriate styles to it or is it planned to implement such a mechanism in QGIS?

Kind regards,
Josef

Hello,

I have some difficulties in passing the Travis tests with this PR:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31942.

As I am fed up to make turning the server for nothing and reject CO2, I ask
for help.

The 'code layout' tests seem not to pass. Reading the log, I can find this
link http://tinyurl.com/yynt7m9a. Following this link, it seems the
problems come from warning: undocumented parameters and unknown command
'\TODO'.

Can anyone confirm ?

Thanks.

Confirmed.

You need to complete the documentation of a few methods.
I don't know where the TODO comes from though.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] OGC API Features provider
Message-ID: <2028580.xu4Kt67ciC@even-i700>

Hi,

Just a quick note to mention, to avoid any potential duplication of work if 
someone else is about to do that, that in the coming weeks I'll work on adding 
support for "OGC API - Features" (previously known as WFS3) on the client 
side, now that it is about to be finalized to its 1.0 version.

My initial thought would tend towards to try to add it into the existing WFS 
provider. From a UI perspective, I've got some feedback that it would probably 
be best to access it through the existing WFS entry to avoid cluttering the UI 
with a new provider.
On the code level, the choice between having a dedicated provider or adding 
functionnality in the existing WFS one is not so obvious. Technologically, 
there is little in common between traditional WFS ( XML & GML based, KVP based 
requests ), and OAPI-F (my own acronym for OGC API - Features) (JSON & GeoJSON 
based, with a linking approach). But the WFS provider has something which is 
quite useful for the OAPI-F context, which is the local Spatialite-based cache 
& the background download capability. Extracting that from the WFS provider 
and be generic enough for multiple providers could be quite involved.

Opinions about above directions welcome.

Yes, we're talking about the same API. Alessandro's work was on the server 
side, and here I plan to address the client side (potentially working with any 
server conformant implementation)

 OK, thanks, the tests has passed now.

As you say, that was the undocumented parameters.

And '///@TODO' code in the ccp file that was making the warning and failing
the test.

There's no such existing mechanism.

Have you experiment with the setting under project properties -- data
sources -- "Trust project when data source has no metadata"? I believe
that was added to assist with cases like this.

Whichever path you take, it would be fantastic to use the same codebase for
the WFS Spatialite based cache as it is well used and tested.

Agreed, this should speed up the loading time of layers without metadata
(probably postgresql views mainly in your case)

If your need is to access some layers only, I recommend the
menu_layers_from_project plugin. It will only parse the xml but not load
the data until you choose to import some layers into a session.

I also experienced that lowering the network timeout can speed up ogc
webservice layers when the service is not responding.

Régis

I'm happy to see you taking this up!

I would probably advise against this approach, from the architectural point
of view, I think that it would be better to address the new OGC JSON-based
API with an abstract base class for providers that consume that kind of API
and make WFS3 the first concrete implementation of that base.

Re-using the WFS-sqlite feature cache looks a good idea, you might want to
refactor it out to core to make it re-usable from a family of providers.

Looking forward to test it against QGIS Server, we will be providing a
complete client+server solution!

Thanks!

While I understand this idea, I see several difficulties:
- the candidate providers are the feature one, a coverage and a tile / map 
one, but vector and raster providers have little in common
- at the time of writing, to the best of my knowledge, only the OAPI-F has 
reached a sufficient degree of maturity in its spec and initial 
implementations. In particular while I think there is an intention to have a 
OAPI-Common at some stage, I don't think this has emerged yet (the current 
github repo for it is a copy&paste of OAPI-F), so making an abstraction with 
just a single implementation is not going to work well at that stage.
- if looking at the existing providers in QGIS, the arcgisrest ones seem to be 
the closest to what you mention above. From what I see, the code between the 
AMS and AFS is quite separate, likely for the reasons I mentionned in my first 
point. They do have some utility functions qgsarcgisrestutils.h in common, so 
that would be more the kind of communality I can imagine if a OAPI-Tile/Map 
provider is later added. Perhaps things like parsing service metadata.

Regarding the UI, I'm not completely sure of the best option. I can understand 
the opinion I got that reusing the WFS UI could be better because people are 
familiar with it, and that would limit the number of provider entries (people 
just have to figure out if the URL they are provided with is a WFS, OAPI-F or 
ArcGIS REST Feature one...). It can also makes sense if the OAPI-F stuff is 
added to the existing WFS provider.
The other point of view, having a dedicated UI & provider, has also its 
advantages in term of code clarity (but provided the point below can be 
solved)

I haven't completely given up on trying that idea. Just scares me :-)

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31930

I was thinking, I have found a solution to force QGIS Server to wait for 
loading remote SVG before rendering.
But it seems that I am not able to determine if a task is running or 
will be ran.

Just after fetching SVGs, I wrote this code :

     if ( QgsApplication::taskManager()->countActiveTasks() > 0 )
     {
       QEventLoop loop;
       QObject::connect( QgsApplication::taskManager(), 
&QgsTaskManager::allTasksFinished, &loop, &QEventLoop::quit );
       loop.exec();
     }

When a task is added, does the number of active tasks increase?
Is the number of active tasks null when all the task has been performed ?
If the number of active tasks is null, are all tasks finished ?

Thansk for your help,
René-Luc

Hello Nyall, hello Régis,

thank you for your hints. The option “Trust project when data source has no metadata” improved the loading time a lot. The project still needs about 6 minutes to load, but at least it is already an improvement. However, I guess, that is normal for such a large project. The plug-in “Layers menu from project” also looks very interesting.

Kind regards,
Josef

Agreed, this should speed up the loading time of layers without metadata (probably postgresql views mainly in your case)

If your need is to access some layers only, I recommend the menu_layers_from_project plugin. It will only parse the xml but not load the data until you choose to import some layers into a session.

I also experienced that lowering the network timeout can speed up ogc webservice layers when the service is not responding.

Régis

There's no such existing mechanism.

Have you experiment with the setting under project properties -- data
sources -- "Trust project when data source has no metadata"? I believe
that was added to assist with cases like this.

Message-ID: <523fe094-ee0b-cf26-5252-dc84d439c256@gmail.com>

Hi list members -

I have question regarding coordinate reference systems.

As I understand the difference between the datums WGS84 and ETRS89:

  * They are based on the same ellipsoid. And in 1989 there were - for
    all practical purposes - /no/ difference between the the 2 datums
    coordinate wise
  * However, the datums are "drifting" apart because the ETRS89 is
    coordinate bound  to the Eurasian continental plate and WGS84 is not.
  * The continental drift is ca 2.5 cm / year. And around 70 cm in all.

So a specific position in Denmark (or Europe) in  the same mathematical 
projection i.e UTM32N should have 2 /different/ x,y values using the 
WGS84 datum  and ETRS89 datum. And the present "distance" should be ca. 
70 cm.

However, that is not the case in QGIS (v. 3.8):  A point digitized with 
position (550000, 6080000) in ETRS89/UTM32N has the (almost) exact same 
x/y values in WGS84/UTM32N when you change the projection in the map 
window from ETRS89/UTM32N to WGS84/UTM32N. The x/y values differs around 
.1 mm. Certainly no "drift" around 70 cm.

(Doing the same experiment using ED50 instead of WGS84 show the expected 
difference around 200 m between ED50 and ETRS89)

How come ? Or is the error-source sitting ca. 70 cm in front of the 
screen ?? (I have a 34" large flatscreen :-)

That's a bloody huge project...

I can't fathom you need all these layers at once.

You could try to split the project in a "base" project with a minimum 
set of layers and split the rest in of the layers/groups into a number 
of qlr files.

And use the "QLR Browser" plugin to load/unload the different qlr files 
as you need them.

I personally think this method is better than using other plugins with 
similar functionality and certainly is better than loading 1080 layers 
at once.

The QLR browser plugin is used in a number of Danish municipalities 
which typically uses a very large number of layers in their daily use of 
QGIS.

Hi Bo,

You are on the right path. It is true that ETRS89 is plate-fixed and that WGS84 is not and that the two slowly drift apart. There are two facts that makes this more complicated than most of us would like:


1.       There exists 6 realizations, or versions, of WGS84 that differ up to a meter between the two versions that are farthest apart. Since in general in GIS we never specific *which* of the six WGS84’s the uncertainty in the transformation is larger than the 30 years of continental plate movement.

2.       To do an accurate transform between a global reference like WGS84 and a plate-fixed frame like ETRS89 you need to know the observation time of your coordinate. What if you WGS84 coordinate was measured in 1995? Then you only need to account for a few years of plate movement compared to a coordinate from today where 30 years is needed.

Because of the two above facts the default transformation between WGS84 and ETRS89 is the identity transformation. Improving the situation required both time-stamped coordinates and knowledge of the specific WGS84 version in use.

For the Danish case, if you really need high accuracy transformations you can take a look at https://github.com/NordicGeodesy/NordicTransformations where transformations with cm-accuracy between ITRS2014 (basically WGS84 today) and the Danish realization of ETRS89 is available in the form of PROJ parameter and grid files.

Because the data for such a transform isn't in the EPSG database.

I believe the main reason is that both WGS84 and ETRS89 are in fact datum ensembles, that is a short and convenient nickname for a number of more well-defined datum realizations. For WGS84, you have 6 different realizations from Transit to G1762. And ETRS89 has 11 realizations from ETRF89 to ETRF2014
So to get accurate data, you must research tranformations between those direct realizations. And in EPSG, accurate transformations tend not being given in terms of WGS84 realizations but from their equivalent ITRF realizations (WGS84(G1762) is identical to ITRF2014 within ~1cm),

so, while playing with PROJ' projinfo utility,

$ projinfo -s ITRF2014 -t ETRF2014

I see 2 potential coordinate transformations, and the one that makes probably more sense today is the one using epoch 2010 for the transformation:

unknown id, Conversion from ITRF2014 (geog2D) to ITRF2014 (geocentric) + ITRF2014 to ETRF2014 (2) + Conversion from ETRF2014 (geocentric) to ETRF2014 (geog2D), 0 m, Europe - ETRS89

PROJ string:
+proj=pipeline +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=helmert +x=0 +y=0 +z=0 +rx=0.001785 +ry=0.011151 +rz=-0.01617 +s=0 +dx=0 +dy=0 +dz=0 +drx=8.5e-05 +dry=0.000531 +drz=-0.00077 +ds=0 +t_epoch=2010 +convention=position_vector +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

And you need of course to specify the coordinate epoch of your coordinates as ITRF/WGS84 are Earth-fixed/dynamic datums.

echo "49 2 0 2019.6" | cct -d 10 +proj=pipeline +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=helmert +x=0 +y=0 +z=0 +rx=0.001785 +ry=0.011151 +rz=-0.01617 +s=0 +dx=0 +dy=0 +dz=0 +drx=8.5e-05 +dry=0.000531 +drz=-0.00077 +ds=0 +t_epoch=2010 +convention=position_vector +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

48.9999955186   1.9999924499  -0.0016582003     2019.6000

Actually using the first proposal using an epoch at 1989, I get exactly the same results

echo "49 2 0 2019.6" | cct -d 10 +proj=pipeline +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=helmert +x=0 +y=0 +z=0 +rx=0 +ry=0 +rz=0 +s=0 +dx=0 +dy=0 +dz=0 +drx=8.5e-05 +dry=0.000531 +drz=-0.00077 +ds=0 +t_epoch=1989 +convention=position_vector +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

48.9999955186   1.9999924499  -0.0016582003     2019.6000

That's a 74cm horizontal shift

For funsies, let's try to do this using the transformations I linked in my previous email. Here I have used a coordinate that is actually in Denmark. Using what is currently the best transformation between ITRF2014 and the local Danish realization of ETRS89 (ETRF92 at 1994.704 for those who might find that interesting). I get a horizontal difference between the two of 75.1 cm

echo 12 55 0 2019.0 | cct -d 10 +proj=pipeline +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +init=NKG:ITRF2014 +inv +step +init=NKG:DK
 11.9999917811   54.9999951856  -0.0116067529     2019.0000

echo 55 12 54.9999951856 11.9999917811 | geod -I +ellps=GRS80 +units=cm
-135d32'21.267" 44d27'38.709"   75.092

Unless you care about cm to mm accuracy you will be fine using the transformations that projinfo suggests :-)

Because the data for such a transform isn't in the EPSG database.

I believe the main reason is that both WGS84 and ETRS89 are in fact datum ensembles, that is a short and convenient nickname for a number of more well-defined datum realizations. For WGS84, you have 6 different realizations from Transit to G1762. And ETRS89 has 11 realizations from ETRF89 to ETRF2014
So to get accurate data, you must research tranformations between those direct realizations. And in EPSG, accurate transformations tend not being given in terms of WGS84 realizations but from their equivalent ITRF realizations (WGS84(G1762) is identical to ITRF2014 within ~1cm),

so, while playing with PROJ' projinfo utility,

$ projinfo -s ITRF2014 -t ETRF2014

I see 2 potential coordinate transformations, and the one that makes probably more sense today is the one using epoch 2010 for the transformation:

unknown id, Conversion from ITRF2014 (geog2D) to ITRF2014 (geocentric) + ITRF2014 to ETRF2014 (2) + Conversion from ETRF2014 (geocentric) to ETRF2014 (geog2D), 0 m, Europe - ETRS89

PROJ string:
+proj=pipeline +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=helmert +x=0 +y=0 +z=0 +rx=0.001785 +ry=0.011151 +rz=-0.01617 +s=0 +dx=0 +dy=0 +dz=0 +drx=8.5e-05 +dry=0.000531 +drz=-0.00077 +ds=0 +t_epoch=2010 +convention=position_vector +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

And you need of course to specify the coordinate epoch of your coordinates as ITRF/WGS84 are Earth-fixed/dynamic datums.

echo "49 2 0 2019.6" | cct -d 10 +proj=pipeline +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=helmert +x=0 +y=0 +z=0 +rx=0.001785 +ry=0.011151 +rz=-0.01617 +s=0 +dx=0 +dy=0 +dz=0 +drx=8.5e-05 +dry=0.000531 +drz=-0.00077 +ds=0 +t_epoch=2010 +convention=position_vector +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

48.9999955186   1.9999924499  -0.0016582003     2019.6000

Actually using the first proposal using an epoch at 1989, I get exactly the same results

echo "49 2 0 2019.6" | cct -d 10 +proj=pipeline +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=helmert +x=0 +y=0 +z=0 +rx=0 +ry=0 +rz=0 +s=0 +dx=0 +dy=0 +dz=0 +drx=8.5e-05 +dry=0.000531 +drz=-0.00077 +ds=0 +t_epoch=1989 +convention=position_vector +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

48.9999955186   1.9999924499  -0.0016582003     2019.6000

That's a 74cm horizontal shift

Thanks to Kristian and Even for some very thorough answers. That was 
somewhat heavy reading (for me at least) on such an ordinary Wednesday :-)

I'll guess that QGIS (or the underlying transformation library) is using 
some of the "earlier" realizations for both ETR89 and WGS84 datums since 
the  ETR89/UTM32N and WGS84/UTM32N coordinates of a given location is so 
close to each other (0.1 mm)

Actually the answer was more than I had hoped for. I'm currently 
teaching some students at the  Forestry College, University of 
Copenhagen some /elementary/ knowledge of projections as a part of their 
GIS education.

I'll try to incorporate this knowledge into the curriculum - hopefully 
without exploding their brains (or mine) !

It doesn't use any particular realization. It just uses the generic datums for 
both, and thus get from the EPSG database, a null transformation between 
those.

$ projinfo -s EPSG:25832 -t EPSG:32632
Candidate operations found: 1
-------------------------------------
Operation n°1:

unknown id, Inverse of UTM zone 32N + ETRS89 to WGS 84 (1) + UTM zone 32N, 1 
m, Europe - ETRS89

PROJ string:
+proj=pipeline +step +inv +proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=utm 
+zone=32 +ellps=WGS84

The 0.1 mm you see comes from the fact that ETRS89/UTM32N uses the GRS80 
ellipsoid and WGS84/UTM32N the WGS84 ellipsoid, which differ by a tiny amount 
on their inverse flattenin. Given that we use a null transform between both 
datums, it is not significant at all.

Hi Jürgen,

Is there any plans on the horizon for updating the Qt build in
osgeo4w? I ask because of these issues (all relate to crashes when
exporting hi resolution layouts):

These have a confirmed fix in qt 5.12.4 and 5.13.1 (I've verified):

See bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-75082 and https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/

FYI, 5.12.4 (and 5.13.1 I believe) has an issue that breaks CSS-based
themes (night mapping, blend of gray).

A fix has been committed and will be available in 5.12.5.

Message-ID: <CABPxTTrhuqzbGbtBcFvnmNEe4YBHxFcyYLP4YnnLZ5g9W=USpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Are there any geodesic QGIS algorithms that simplify lines? "Simplify" just
uses the projection units of measure. If there isn't I thought I would add
this to the Shape Tools plugin. I could easily implement the
Douglas-Peucker algorithm using geodesic math.

For GPS tracks I also see a need to throw out all points that are less than
a certain distance or less than a certain time interval. I don't see any
simplification algorithms that make use of time. Am I just missing them?

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS FCGI Server 3.9.0 - JPEG renders but PNG empty
Message-ID: <CAC_adiq7z0Pt6MdHYqUQGvEza2kcZrzf_KezRH707TVMVmv3vw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I've compiled QGis 3.9.0-Master from source on CentOS Linux release 7.7,
mainly to deploy the QGis Mapserver.
At first sight the mapserver works but only renders jpeg format WMS
requests, png format request are empty. No errors in the qgisserver or
apache log.

Probably due to a mismatch in compiled libraries I guess. I've compiled
PROJ, GEOS, GDAL, LibSpatialite, exiv2 before hand.
PROJ 6.2.0
GEOS 3.7.2
GDAL 3.0.1
LibSpatialite 4.3
exiv2 0.27.2

Others are installed from packages.

As there are no error logs I've no idea which library could cause the
issue?
I would appreciate any suggestions which could point me in the right
direction?

My httpd configuration is as follows

  FcgidInitialEnv LC_ALL "en_US.UTF-8"
  FcgidInitialEnv PYTHONIOENCODING UTF-8
  FcgidInitialEnv LANG "en_US.UTF-8"

  # QGIS SERVER log (different from apache logs)
  FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE /data/qgis/server/log/serverlog.log
  FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL 0

  FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_DEBUG 1

  FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_AUTH_DB_DIR_PATH "/data/qgis/server/db"
  FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE
"/data/qgis/server/db/qgis-auth.db"

  SetEnv PGSERVICEFILE /data/qgis/server/pg_service.conf
  FcgidInitialEnv PGPASSFILE "/data/qgis/server/.pgpass"

  ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /opt/qgis/bin/
  <Directory "/opt/qgis/bin">

That's a bloody huge project...

I can't fathom you need all these layers at once.

You could try to split the project in a "base" project with a minimum set of layers and split the rest in of the layers/groups  into a number of qlr files.

And use the "QLR Browser" plugin to load/unload the different qlr files as you need them.

I personally think this method is better than using other plugins with similar functionality and certainly is better than loading 1080 layers at once.

The QLR browser plugin is used in a number of Danish municipalities which typically uses a very large number of layers in their daily use of QGIS.

Dear QGIS developers,

we are facing some crucial performance issues while loading a big QGIS project.

The project ...
... has 1080 layers
... has 167 layer groups
... is heavily styled (in fact, most of the information in the .qgs file are stylings)
... has a size of 53 MB (the .gqs file)
... loads the data from a PostGIS database

The main problem we are facing is, that the loading time of the .qgs file is between 10 and 15 Minutes (depending on the network traffic).
We don't need all the layers which are defined in the .qgs file immediately. In most cases, we just need a bunch of those layers at once.

Therefore, the question is, if QGIS provides a mechanism to postpone the initial loading of all layers from QGIS startup to the point in time when we actually need the layers? I.e., the layer structure is loaded but not the layer data.

Is there a build-in QGIS mechanism that allows loading only the needed layers from the .qgs file and write the appropriate styles to it or is it planned to implement such a mechanism in QGIS?

Kind regards,
Josef

I set up my own plugin repo and meet exactly the problem as described here:

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/325790/error-downloading-a-plugin

Additional info: After restarting QGIS, the plugin is available *but 
inactive*. So I need to check it in the plugin manager and then it just 
works.

Seems like after downloading the zip and extracting it, QGIS is not able 
to find it anymore. Clues anyone?

Hi devs,
I need some guidance to help me find all possible error messages that are
saved in the attribute table when we run the Check Validity Algorithm for
both methods.
This can be found in the source code?

I search here but didn't find:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/qgis/CheckValidity.py

I'm asking this because this can be a good addition in the documentation to
explain the errors that can occur to help understand what is what and why
happens.

Please feel free to give any advice.

Thank you for your time.

Cheers,
João

Hi João,

That would be great!

For the GEOS validation, you can get the list of errors from:
src/core/geometry/qgsgeos.cpp

QStringLiteral( "topology validation error" ), QObject::tr( "Topology
validation error", "GEOS Error" )
QStringLiteral( "repeated point" ), QObject::tr( "Repeated point", "GEOS
Error" )
QStringLiteral( "hole lies outside shell" ), QObject::tr( "Hole lies
outside shell", "GEOS Error" )
QStringLiteral( "holes are nested" ), QObject::tr( "Holes are nested",
"GEOS Error" )
QStringLiteral( "interior is disconnected" ), QObject::tr( "Interior is
disconnected", "GEOS Error" )
QStringLiteral( "self-intersection" ), QObject::tr( "Self-intersection",
"GEOS Error" )
QStringLiteral( "ring self-intersection" ), QObject::tr( "Ring
self-intersection", "GEOS Error" )
QStringLiteral( "nested shells" ), QObject::tr( "Nested shells", "GEOS
Error" )
QStringLiteral( "duplicate rings" ), QObject::tr( "Duplicate rings",
"GEOS Error" )
QStringLiteral( "too few points in geometry component" ), QObject::tr(
"Too few points in geometry component", "GEOS Error" )
QStringLiteral( "invalid coordinate" ), QObject::tr( "Invalid
coordinate", "GEOS Error" )
QStringLiteral( "ring is not closed" ), QObject::tr( "Ring is not
closed", "GEOS Error" )

For the QGIS validation, you have to look at:
src/core/qgsgeometryvalidator.cpp

            QString msg = QObject::tr( "segment %1 of ring %2 of polygon
%3 intersects segment %4 of ring %5 of polygon %6 at %7" )
      QString msg = QObject::tr( "ring %1 with less than four points"
).arg( i );
      QString msg = QObject::tr( "ring %1 not closed" ).arg( i );
    QString msg = QObject::tr( "line %1 with less than two points"
).arg( i );
      QString msg = QObject::tr( "line %1 contains %n duplicate node(s)
at %2", "number of duplicate nodes", n ).arg( i ).arg( j );
      QString msg = QObject::tr( "segments %1 and %2 of line %3
intersect at %4" ).arg( j ).arg( k ).arg( i ).arg( s.toString() );
      QString msg = QObject::tr( "Ring %1 of polygon %2 not in exterior
ring" ).arg( i ).arg( idx );

I hope it helps.

Best regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Hi João,

If you can see a good way to make both validation errors strings more
similar (when the GEOS and QGIS error are the same), feel to make a
proposal.

Right now, for the same error, a user will see (for example):

Using GEOS:
Ring self-intersection

Using QGIS:
segments 2 and 126 of line 0 intersect at -2632521.58859, 5137728.25013
segments 3 and 126 of line 0 intersect at -2632521.58859, 5137728.25013

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

PS For my classes/workshops, I use the alaska shapefile from
https://qgis.org/downloads/data/
It contains errors :-)

Now this seems gone. I think that's a pity, as it is very useful for

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Opening projects from PostgreSQL
Message-ID: <cada01fe-2dfa-bfcd-b4c1-38e039e582ad@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
if I attempt to open a project stored in postgresql, I encounter a problem:
* Project > Open from > PostgreSQL
it shows the schema name, but from the project dropdown no project can
be selected
* then I sect the public schema, back to my data schema, the list of
projects appears.
A known issue?
>From browser all well.
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Loading pg raster crashes QGIS
Message-ID: <c154ffd1-22b7-1bd0-c06d-11ea91ad171c@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I think the crash when zooming after loading a pg raster is back, both
in 3.4 and in master:
* load a single band raster from either Browser or DB Manager
* zoom in and out
* crash.
I'm struggling to find a way of consistently replicating this, using
tiles vs untiled rasters of different sizes, but it happens very often.
Occasionally it hangs QGIS, with the progress bar moving and no effect.
Any hint on what I can check?
Two different error messages in different occasions, see below.
Cheers.

Nice Jorge,
I think for now is relevant to explain the possible errors (I will try to
put some images) and explain to the users what is each one and give
possible hints how to fix them.

Cheers,
João

Does that already also include the fixes we fund KDAB for?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Porting Create Grid algorithm to C++
Message-ID: <76c0dfb7-a315-c78e-a861-1d47a046e8d3@gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Developers,

lately I have been using the 'Create Grid' algorithm a lot on huge areas 
and with a rather fine grid resolution. I was not surprised that 
creating a very fine grid took a very long time as the algorithm is 
currently implemented in python.

In order to speed up my work I decided to experiment a little with C++ 
(coming from a python background) development in QGIS and ported the  
algorithm to C++ based on other native algorithms. The code is working 
very well, the grid creation process has been sped up significantly. I 
would now like to contribute the code to the QGIS project so that other 
users can benefit from the speedup.

Coming from a plugin development/ python background I have little 
experience with the processes involved with porting processing 
algorithms from python to C++ and wanted to clear some questions with 
you before opening a pull request:

- Is there any reason why certain algorithms (eg. the Create Grid alg) 
should not be available in C++?

- As I am not familiar with the processes how native processing 
algorithms get committed to the main repository (pull requests, 
prepare-commit.sh, sip, etc.), would anybody like to help/mentor/guide 
me through this process and review the code?

- Are there any special requirements on testing infrastructure for C++ 
algs which should be implemented too (I have not worked with tests so far)?

So far, my experience with porting python algs to C++ has been very good 
with Create Grid and I would like to work on other ports if everything 
goes well.

Best regards,
Clemens

Sounds fantastic, and a very valuable (and desired) contribution! Nice work!

No. In fact, the opposite! The long-term goal is to port all these
algorithms away from Python and to c++. Python is GREAT for plugin
based algorithms and for quickly developing new algorithms, but it's
just not competitive in speed vs the c++ algorithms. We've also had a
LOT of issues in the past where Python algorithms break due to lack of
compile time checks when QGIS API (or other Processing Python code) is
revised. In contrast, I'm not aware of a single regression of this
nature in any of the ported c++ algorithms.

(My advice for readers out there: don't write big, complex
applications in Python. full stop.)

**raises hand**

Looks like there's already good test coverage with the existing Python
algorithm. These existing tests will carry over to the c++ port, so
it's likely that nothing extra is required here.

In general, there's some "desirable changes" which we are encouraging
when porting an existing algorithm to c++, but none of them apply in
this particular case. Specifically:

- use the QgsProcessingFeatureBasedAlgorithm subclass wherever possible.
- add support for dynamic parameters where desirable.

That's great to hear!  I'd suggest having a look at a really simple
feature based algorithm like DensifyGeometries as a great candidate
for learning. There's almost no logic in the Python code for this one,
so it would be a great one to learn the overall process of porting to
c++ without the complexities of having to port a lot of
python-specific logic.

No - I'm not aware of anyone of these which have actually been merged
upstream yet. It's just a nice coincidence that this particular
upstream issue was recently solved for us.

Hello, Tom

  You could probably try the method described by Jorge in QGIS-user list:

  1. Compile QGIS with debug info.

  2. Create a script with all FcgidInitialEnv taken from apache config
converted to export's like:
  export QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE=/tmp/qgis-000.log

  3. Add query string variable and project file:
  export QUERY_STRING="SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities"
  export QGIS_PROJECT_FILE="/var/www/wms/oracle.qgs"

  4. execute qgis_mapserv.fcgi with debug on:
  export QGIS_DEBUG=9
  export QGIS_LOG_FILE=/tmp/qgis.log
 ./qgis_mapserv.fcgi

  This gives both server logs as well as debug information in separate
files.

Hi devs,

I'm using QGIS 3.9 ea7b27ef3e and am unable to access the page properties;
it used to be available with right-click in the layout but can't find it
there. Browsing the menus neither shows it.

Since my version is not the latest (and osgeo4w did not let me update all
the day), can someone confirm whether it's a bug, a moved feature or me
needing new glasses?

Thank you Nyall for your feedback and for mentoring me in this process! 
I will definitely have a look at other Python algorithms.

I managed to open a pull request 
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/32070) containing the new algorithm 
sources and the integration into cmake.
I ran into some problems when applying the prepare_commit.sh script 
(output: nothing was modified) but everything else went smoothly.

Please have a look at the code and feel free to contact me!

Best regards,
Clemens

Hi,

I confirm that page properties option wasn't showing up in context master
for a earlier version of master, but after pulling the most recent version
and compile, everything looks good.

Are there any good C++ courses for QGIS that you would recommend?

Thanks

Just to round this conversation off -- there was a period of about 1/2
a day where I'd accidentally removed that action. So it was a known
bug in a very short window of time, and you just happened to be
unlucky :)

Message-ID: <7224a7e4-bc94-b3fa-910c-5ba60596f8b2@faunalia.it>

Hi all,

I have a shp with a single line. I drag and drop it from DB Manager into
either a geopackage or PostGIS, choosing "single instead of multi"
option. The resulting layer is still multi, as shown in DB Manager
itself; same thing with a memory layer, it works. QGIS 3.4
to me it looks like a bug. opinions?
cheers.

I guess in a geopck it could reduce a multi in single only if it was a
multi but with one part only for every geometry.

this is my case indeed: a single line

Hi
I may be wrong but I think this "issue" has been raised in the past (with Processing? By Matteo?) and from what I understood in the discussion, shapefiles are multi by default, not single (even if the features are of single part, the layer is identified as multi). Reason why they are handled as such.
Hoping that I do not say nonsense and confuse people more than necessary...

Regards,
Harrissou

No I don’t think we have any time based simplifiers - would be a great addition!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Importing shp into gpkg or PostGIS as SINGLE

Correct, but in the importing popup there is an option to transform into single. It usually works, at least for points, so it's unclear why it shouldn't in this case.
Cheers.

Hi Calvin,

I've implemented a function for this time-based generalization in
MovingPandas:
https://github.com/anitagraser/movingpandas/blob/c26fdf5307f2067d37a0f4cd018fe56c5d6c9839/movingpandas/trajectory.py#L372
I hope to soon provide a plugin that makes MovingPandas accessible from
within Processing. (However, the installation of Moving/GeoPandas
requirements on Windows is difficult without conda.)

Regards,
Anita
