I get an error in 1.8:
newComposition.addItemsFromXML(rootEle,  doc)
AttributeError: 'QgsComposition' object has no attribute 'addItemsFromXML'

so it seems not possible to load a template in a Python plugin in 1.8.
No problem I will wait until 2.0.

Hi All,
finally I got aroud getting master to compile again under the android
arm toolchain with some changes. now is matter of getting all the
dependencies and stuff to get soon a new release.

but this mail, as the subject says is a plea to all devs to please
consider that qreal is _not_ always typedeffed to double. for instance,
under arm it is typedeffed to float which always causes me the most
errors because of signatures incompatibility.
I could recompile the Qt libs to typedef qreal to double, but then I'd
have to distribute myself the full Qt libs together with qgis instead of 
using the necessitas packet manager which would make the package grow 
considerably.

So what I ask you is to please consider this issue when you use qreal 
methods. for example:
qMax(myQreal, myDouble) is ok in x86 but will generate an error on arm.

thanks a lot
Ciao

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGS harvesting to build a metadata catalog
Message-ID: <1362129770254-5037698.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi All, 
A new need is occuring in my corp, and i would like to know if others have
been thinking of that:

I would like to be able to build a minimalist metadata ISO 199115 catalog
referencing QGIS maps and composers. Xml format of QGS already contains a
lot of feature that allows starting a work. 

I see two ways:
- a minimalistic one, generating iso metadata using existing info stored in
QGS. This is not INSPIRE compatible, but allows me to reference maps quickly
(an dirty)
- a complete one, associating a xml iso file inside or along qgs file, if
user want it. All the hard job is tio synchronise xml with qgs content and
events. 

Is anybody already working on that ? I would be pleased to share on it. 
I have seen that some work is done on QGIS and ISO19110 data catalogs for
JRC , we could share some parts of developpement. 

Cheers R?gis

Hi R?gis, 
I've worked on something similar, not exactly about higher level metadata, but if you want some automated way to help catalogue raster/vector data, I built this script:

https://github.com/spatialguru/NME/tree/master/nme/cat
See: gdalogr_catalogue.py

It produces XML output and recursively scans all files/folders.
Maybe it will give you some ideas :)

My hope is to also build capability in QGIS to open and view this XML file to browse the data without ever having to touch until the user is ready to preview or load it.
Just a thought anyway...

Hi R?gis,

We have the same idea in 3Liz.
We would like in a first time have a minimalist one, with for example 
lizmap as metadata proxy.
We don't have plan yet but we would like to participate.

Cheers,

Hi all.
We (Faunalia) are going to do some work on this general area very soon:
* adding a method to store metadata in PostgreSQL
* improving the CSW client.
Any collaboration is more than welcome, in oder to avoid duplication of work.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

We use Geonetwork as our metadata catalogue, in conjunction with a range of FOSS tools including Postgis, mapserver, Geoserver, QGIS, etc. 

Personally, I'd see more advantages in enhancing the CSW client capability of QGIS, so it can harvest data & specifically allow users to add catalogued OGC WMS/WCS/WFS services to the list of stored services, instead of adding them manually. If you are developing a metadata catalogue capability, I'm happy to support a client capability, any server capability is not likely to be of use for us, though it may be for those using QGIS in a server capacity in other ways. 

We have funded Sourcepole to develop a plugin which harvests a list of WxS service URLs & basic metadata from a list in a web page (http://www.niwa.co.nz/ei/feeds/report) and allows users to select layers as predefined favourites, and some other stuff... 

I'm planning to enhance this in the near future. We are currently funding an enhancement to Geonetwork to improve the harvesting facilities for metadata provided? in WxS services, and once this is complete, will be funding changes to our QGIS plugin to enable CWS harvesting from Geonetwork instead of from the above web page.

As I do have funds to provide such specific capability, if you can align your projects to meet our requirements, I'm quite happy to work with other QGIS developers to mutual benefit.


One comment on your requests for donations and funding for QGIS, I've asked a few times on this list for developers to undertake paid work to provide specific enhancements for QGIS, and have been surprised at the lack of response. 3 developers expressing interest is about the best I have received, sometimes zero. 

Cheers,

? Brent Wood

Agreed. Much room for cooperation on this subject.

Cool. I think we can work jointly on this. We also have some funding for this. Where
can we find the plugin?

Yes, I'm aware of the issue. IMHO this is a consequence of QGIS huge success:
probably all available core devs are already overstretched, and full of work.
New devs are flocking in, but there is still need for more.
So any initiative to find new developers, and encouraging (financially, among other
things) newcomers is quite important at this stage.

All the best.

Hi,

I think it would be relatively easy to provide the functionality of 
exporting metadata from QGIS to a pycsw server in the form of a 
publishing plugin, similar to the one creating map files for MapServer.
Thoughts?

Right. Seems I was too excited to read carrefuly your instructions ;) 
Now it works perfectly with 3.0.0

I'd like that very much, possibly it could solve R?gis problem.

Paolo I don't know if it makes sense to do that - for unit tests the
emphasis should be minimal datasets that represent something that
causes a regression or verifies functional capability. For this reason
we will probably end up with many (hundreds) of small shp (often with
only one or a few features) and other datasets over time each
representing the conditions for a known issue.

Sample data on the other hand should be thematic and provide
sufficient breadth for users to try out the key features of QGIS
without trying to express every edge case they may encounter.

Tim

Message-ID: <CALCNqkaUOBAFy1KPjAA_ZL=mgN+jG6OXz=tQsNfb8bgMF0T0hA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I would like to get 2.0 release process rolling - I think all the key
features we were after have made their way into master and those that
haven't can probably wait for 2.1. Unless there is vigorous and
widespread objection, I propose that we embark on the following
release schedule:

15 March 2013 - Feature freeze - no new features in master
1 April 2013 - GUI Freeze and String freeze - no changes to ui or
strings except where required for critical bug fixes. Call for
translations.
1 June 2013 - Branch 2.0, code freeze (except for packaging related
changes), call for packaging
7 June 2013 - Public release of 2.0

The schedule basically allows for 3 months in order to work away the
~50 blockers in the bug queue.[1]

I appreciate there are some who will wish the release period is longer
and others who wish it was shorter, but we need to draw a line in the
sand somewhere and this schedule seems like a good place to draw it.

If you are in some way funding development of QGIS features (or
building them yourself), please bear in mind that the features being
developed for you will no longer be part of the nightly builds after
15 March unless they are already part of the 'master' code base at
that time.

Also if you have the financial resources to do so, please consider
hiring a developer to take care of one or more blocker issues so that
we can avoid extending the release deadline because of blockers. If
you take this path, please also ask your contractee to provide unit
tests for the fixes so that we can ensure that there are no
regressions in the future. As always donations to the project itself
to support fixing these blockers will be gratefully accepted - contact
Paolo Cavallini if you need more info, or visit our donations page[2].

To bug queue maintainers, could you please go through the blocker list
and carefully evaluate whether they should really be in the blocker
queue. IMHO a blocker should be a cross cutting issue (i.e. not
affecting a user base of 1 only) that causes QGIS to crash, corrupt
data or introduces a significant regression to existing functionality.

To documentors and translators - its probably a good time to start
encouraging your communities to get ready for 2.0 and start
translating / documenting new features.

You're right - so we need two data sets: a comprehensive sample one, used for
tutorials, manual etc., and a minimal test one.
Thanks for clarifying.

Hi Tim,
thanks a lot for drawing the line - much needed. Things we planned to fix for 2.0
that still need love are, IMHO:

   * general interface cleanup
   * symbology migration to the new one
   * labelling migration to the new one
   * Sextante bugfixing, and especially setting up a full test suite for it

So I would solicitate funders and developers to concentrate on these issues, during
feature freeze.

I would add the same target (7 June) for the publication of the new website (we're
going to work on this in Valmiera, hopefully this is feasible).

Additionally, I would like to release with plugins in good shape:

   * add a bugtracker for all the plugins that miss it
   * update to the new API the plugins that are not working
   * migrate the plugin from the old to the new repo

I think that, given the rather long period of feature freeze, we should be tolerant
and lift it in very limited circumstances for non invasive, well tested [with unit
tests] improvements.

All the best.

It will be great to see the 2.0 in the end, however first I'd like to ensure 
its API will be ready for all the features to be postponed to 2.1.

Of course, I mean especially the threading. I would ask Martin about his 
attitude to the freeze date. Also Radim put "Raster API revision" to his 
hackfest tasks. 

Seems we postpone the long-awaited GUI usability overhaul to 2.1, but at least 
we should decide for the horizontal/vertical tabs :)

That's next on my list. :^) I'll be finishing the work on converting the
project, vector and raster option dialogs to vertical tabs, probably
starting on Monday.

Considering the number of current outstanding issues for the project as a
whole, I think any more large GUI changes (like the recent ones to Print
Composer) should be slated for 2.1. There is still quite a bit of work just
to bring more consistency to the current GUI.

Larry

As much as a consistent UI is great and we should always aim for that
stability is much more important.  We can fix the UI between 2.0 and 2.1
but releasing something unstable really leaves a bad taste in peoples
mouth.  Having said that the add vector layer stuff is starting to really
get out of hand.  I would like to use the vertical tab idea and just have
one dialog.  I had bigger plans for the dialog but don't have time
currently.  I think the vertical tabs would improve the user experience
enough for 2.0 and then I can work on a new UI for a later release.

Would not be also great to fix issue that are known to cause crashes

otherwise in 2.0 we will ship tools that are known to fail.

Hi!

A copy/paste extents feature would also be very useful when working with a
lot of similar maps (that would fit very well in a contextual menu and
reasonably well next to the ?set extent? button)

Paolo,

I had the idea of using the vertical list of icons on the left, one for
each provider, and having the current providers widget/dialog that opens
normally when you press the button docked on the right.  This would mean
the UI is more consistent with the other dialog that follow this style and
would reduce the Open xxx Layer down to a single Add Data/Layer button.  I
will see if my new employer is happy for me to spend some time on this for
2.0.

I see, thanks. Wouldn't it be better to remove it entirely, and put all the necessary
functions in the Browser?
All the best.

Hi,

I'm hoping to kick off a discussion on a possible new QGIS plugin, which may be more appropriate as a new dedicated application based on QGIS. I'd like to discuss it with any interested developers.

The program is intended to enable users to record observations from a video. 

This is both live video feeds from a mobile underwater camera, and post capture from a recording. 

We have real time data, including GPS via TCP ports. 
The tool displays a high resolution seabed bathymetry hillshade raster as the background (from our on board multibeam system)
It receives real time "Video on, video off, still taken, platform location" data via the LAN.
The user is to be able to quickly record observations of substrate, morphology, anthropogenic features, animals, plants, etc. Each observation is timestamped & point stamped.
The trackline represented by the points can be splined to a best fit linestring (in 5km of water, positional accuracy is not that good)
Recorded observations can be assigned new (additional) positions fitted to the spline.
Multiple runs of the same video by different or the same user are supported.
Embed a video controller capability for post capture (as opposed to real time) operation.

I figure a SpatialLite db, with a taxonomic database, including substrates & other types of observations would be adequate & convenient.

The UI would allow users to set up a pick list of the most likely observations, assigned to buttons, so the top 20 (say) are a simple click, without searching or keyboard use.

The application has a spatial component, hence QGIS as the enabling tool, but has a significant non-spatial requirement .


If anyone is interested in discussing or undertaking such a development, please let me know.


Cheers,

? Brent Wood

Martin, the InitSpatialMetadat() error is gone, and things are working
quite nicely.

For the record, this new OSM support fixed a very irritating bug from the
old implementation: closed way roundabouts are imported as lines! Big bonus.

Playing around with it, I was wondering whether - for the sake of offering
a better user experience - the import topology from XML and export topology
to spatialite  should be merged into one action. Realistically, my guess is
very few QGIS users will want to _only_ do an import to topology step.
Merging both into one would simplify things for the average Joe.

In that regard, it might also be good to offer (via a checkbox?) to
automatically load the resulting spatialite line / polygon db into the
active project.

Beyond that, it's working like a charm.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] LizMap is on github
Message-ID: <51346E82.5080503@gmail.com>

Hi all,

We are in the final stretch for the next version of LizMap, a plugin and 
a web client to publish QGIS projects as web maps based on QGIS-Server.
In this new version, we added new features :
* Geolocation Control
* Measure tools
* OpenStreetMap search via Nominatim
* A simple print control
* Annotations
An another improvement for this version is the transfer of the plugin 
and the web client form bitbucket to github :
* https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-plugin
* https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-web-client
Contributors are welcome!

The features will be freezed today and we would like to release the new 
version in 2 weeks.
Helps to find bugs or localize the plugin and the web application are 
welcome.

Regards,
Ren?-Luc D'Hont

Hi Tim

The release plan sounds good to me (especially the longer bug fix 
period). I don't know however if 15 March is a bit close for feature 
freeze (at least for me, see below).

 >Things we planned to fix for 2.0 that still need love are, IMHO:
 >* general interface cleanup
 >* symbology migration to the new one
 >* labelling migration to the new one
 >* Sextante bugfixing, and especially setting up a full test suite for it

For symbology migration from old to new one, I have good news: thanks to 
a project from Uster and Jena, I can implement data defined symbology 
settings for new symbology. It is one of the few things which are 
possible in old symbology and not in new. Disadvantage is that 15 March 
is too close for it to go into master. What should we do (wait for 2.1 / 
shift feature freeze date / exception from feature freeze) ?


Regards,
Marco

IMHO better having limited, well thought exceptions.
When do you plan to have this completed?

How much time would you need?  Moving the date to say start of April wouldn't
hurt.  Would that help?

Hi,

I appreciate that a release plan is finally getting published and the 
way for a shiny 2.0 is being paved.

I'm currently working on relation enhancements and nested forms for 
related features. Unfortunately, this branch will not be ready by March 
15, but I know, that there are some people who would like to see this 
included in 2.0. I'm sure it will offer a handy possibility for lots of 
users.
Of course, there will always be some new features, that just won't make 
it into a new release and as Tim said, "the line has to be drawn 
somewhere in the sand".
Anyway, if the feature freeze would be a month later, the relation 
enhancements could go into master before 2.0.

So I have the same question as Marco. What should we do: wait for 2.1, 
shift feature freeze or except this from feature freeze?

Kind regards,
Matthias

It seems that 2 weeks to finish all works won't be sufficient. The
date itself probably would not be problem if it was announced 2 months
ago. We should have probably always enough time between freeze
announcement and freeze date. Some developers are also working on
contracted works which are expected to go to 2.0. And it was
reasonable expectation if feature freeze date was not known until now.

I think that feature freeze should be announced at least 2 months
before feature freeze.

I agree with Radim we need to start calling this much early then this.  2
or 3 months should be fine but I also think that we should have a more
planned out release time. This way people know it is coming +/- a month or
so.

How about planning a 2.1 release shortly after June, where all this job could fit in?
I know it's imposing an additional strain on the whole chain, but it might be a good
compromise.
- From the power user point of view, please remember that we are now in a farily
difficult state, with a 1.8 with several bugs, and a dev version with several of
these fixed, but often broken.
Thanks.

Start of April would be ok for the data defined symbology.

Please try again - Juergen has recently pushed some fixes, those might
eventually help you (btw. please do the build with completely empty
build directory).

This is a good suggestion - the export dialog should probably allow
users directly choose .osm file and import it automatically before
doing the export. Subsequent exports would detect the existence of the
topological database and run export without another import.

Indeed that would be useful.

In qgsrasterpipe.h line 32 - 34 the code look tlike this.
/#ifdef _MSC_VER
#undef interface
#endif/

I have commented the #ifdef and #endif out so that #undef interface is
executed.

Now it compiles further.

Well in Essen we said we were going to wait for a defined feature  set
to make it into GIT  and then call the freeze.  Basically we have been
waiting for Martin's vector refactor branch to be merged and other
features as listed on our short list. We didnt have an ETA for this so
we didnt have a specific freeze date. I'm happy to follow your
suggestion for 2.1 but I'm not sure we want to wait another 2 months
before commencing feature freeze for 2.0 (during which other new
features will start arriving and being almost ready just before the
cut off date etc.).

I would propose we give specific features (Marco H and Matthias K's
work) leeway to come into master up to 1 April but still call the
freeze on 15 March as laid out. If there is a general concensus that
we should wait two months before the freeze then we can shift the
timeline along I guess.

Regards

Tim

 Hi,

 We have the (german speaking) FOSSGIS 2013 conference in Switzerland 
 from June 12 to 14 - would be kind of nice if we could announce QGIS 2.0 
 there (http://www.fossgis.de/konferenz/2013/).

 I agree that data-defined symbology and raster improvements should be 
 finished. The relations manager would be nice as well - though, with 
 only relations manager, you cannot do much. You would also need the 
 nested forms - and this will most likely not make it into QGIS 2.0.

 Thanks,
 Andreas

+1 for April 1 as a general feature freeze date, i.e. not for any specific
feature. I believe that's enough time to finish some of the labeling
features I've been wanting to focus on for 2.0. If someone could help out
with optimizing PAL for speed, that would be great. I think it may be above
my standard C++ coding skills at this time.

Maybe 15 April 2013 for GUI Freeze and String freeze, but keep the same
timetable for the rest... can always bump those dates if blockers can not
be rectified.


Here's a suggestion related to the feature freeze:

Considering the sheer number of new features and the lack of any beta
version, it might be prudent to also have the feature freeze extended
beyond the release date. While I understand the current focus is to not do
any incremental or backported updates, e.g. version 2.0.1, due to lack of
resources, I feel this may hurt the project with regards to this particular
release.

If the feature freeze remains in effect for a certain time beyond the
release it will allow the public to test the new version and have the
developers respond without having to work on two separate branches. In
other words, I suggest we should plan for one (and only one) incremental
release, 2.0.1, and notify users upon release of 2.0 that they have a set
amount of time to report bugs that should be addressed for 2.0.1.

IMHO, if we again have to essentially say to users, 'you'll have to wait
until 2.1, just keep using it broken,' it would be a bad thing. However, I
also suggest with such a setup that after 2.0.1 there only be forward
commits to 2.1, with zero backporting. In fact, with such a setup there
should never be any backporting or working on multiple branches, except new
feature branches waiting for the freeze to end.

In other words, I think the project would maintain good karma if it
publicly acknowledged the need for a bug fix release after such a
significant release as 2.0.

Larry

Andreas, 
So I appreciate the parts you describe, 
but maybe there is another pair of hands, who maybe able to complete a
component of some value. The contributor may be able to describe their own
milestone.
The offer stands in that case, albeit minor.
cheers

/
 a development effort of approx. 200 hours. Part one - one of the 
larger chunks is already financed and implemented by company Sourcepole. 
The Swiss QGIS user group (and some Austrian QGIS users) have a strong 
interest in fixing these issues and started funding it. Part 1 is 
already done. We are still looking for sponsors for parts 2-5. ---- This is
to let you know 
that development efforts are under way and that we are looking for 
financing of parts of it. The work is done by a professional company 
with contracts - so the hardware bounty is unfortunately not an option 
here. Of course, the work items / contracts can be split up to different 
amounts. Andreas Am 24.02.2013 02:33, /

Hi Benjamin,

Thank you for your interest in the project.
I was looking at a problem today and thought of your mail to the list.
In case you still would like to contribute to QGIS with a task 
concerning parallelisation, I would have a place, where I can imagine a 
true benefit of this.
QGIS makes use of the PAL library, which allows for automated placement 
of labels [1] using collision detection. To my knowledge (pardon me if 
I'm wrong), this library is not widely used outside of QGIS. 
Unfortunately it can be really time consuming, as it compares each 
possible label position to each other. I think that this job could 
greatly profit from being split between different cores.
While I'm not the author of this library, my understanding is that the 
loop on line 579 in pal.cpp [2] could be a place to start. If this loop 
could be split up into chunks being worked on by different threads, 
overall performance would benefit.
As far as I can see, there is quite a bit of code, that requires being 
checked for concurrency. I think it is feasible to solve these, but I 
can't tell what the real extent of this is.
Any help in this direction will surely be highly appreciated by the project.

Kind regards,
Matthias

Hi Matthias

>From what I remember the main source of PAL speed issues were the
underlying geometry algorithms, especially when working with polygons
(instead of the label placement algorithm as one would expect). The routine
for searching overlapping candidates uses R-tree, so usually it walks
thrugh just few other candidates (though in case of dense layers even that
may be a lot - we should probably skip candidates if they intersect more
than a certain number of features to save processing time of hopeless
candidates).

Parallelization always comes at a cost of more complex code and the
possibility of deadlocks and subtle errors from run conditions. Worst of
all, algorithms sometimes do not scale well and running them in parallel
actually takes longer due to waiting on locks. That's why I think the
parallelization should be a only used as last resort (unless the task is
trivially parallelizable).

Martin

Also from my point of view, April 1 is a better target to finish 2.0
features. Seeing my recent development speed (slowness) it is clear that
threaded rendering has to be moved to 2.1 or later. It seems that merging
of new vector api branch has introduced various bugs that I need to focus
on in the followong weeks...

I would also like to finally remove old symbology - whether being fully
replaced by features in new symbology or not - otherwise we will need to
live the whole 2.x release cycle with old symbology.

But what about other duplicate things like old labeling and
diagrams? As I understand Marco works on?improving new symbology
(data-defined settings) so old one can be removed too. Regarding
diagrams, if I'm not wrong, new implementation has same features
as old and can replace it smoothly.

Diagrams should be ready for 2.0. The code has been merged about half a 
year ago.

The new diagrams engine is solid, working better than the old one in all
the scenarios I've met. It's only weakness is that it doesn't play well
with the PAL engine.

 Hi,

 Maybe Larry, Martin or Marco can answer this:

 I am looking for the possibility to label a line at the start or end 
 (plus a given offset from start/end). As far as I know this is not yet 
 possible now? Does PAL support this and is it a matter of exposing this 
 option in the GUI or is this not yet supported at all?

 Thanks for your reply,

That's not supported as far as I know. It would be handy to have a
functionality in PAL that would allow us to constrain where the label
candidates should be created and how they should be prioritized. That
would also allow us to decide where to put labels for point features
and which positions are preferred.

Hi,

So this sounds like its not happening any time soon. Definitely after 
QGIS 2.0

In this case I will do a helper layer and restrict that line using 
linear referencing. My data is in Postgis and I can use its linear 
referencing functions.

For the long run I would want to get rid of that helper layer and find a 
QGIS only solution.

Thanks for your reply!

Hi,

I have an idea concerning this that was originally cooked up for an
approach to doing multi-line curved labels [0]. I refer to them as 'label
anchors,' which would be for line and polygon features (though they could
be handy for point features). The concept is roughly like so:

* An anchor point is sent into PAL that constrains where a single label
candidate is generated. The point could be data defined or a reference to a
calculate-able point, e.g. midpoint, beginning/end, leftmost/rightmost,
nearest point on on line relative to off-line point, point furthest from
extent center, etc..

* With data defined anchors, a map tool could be made that allows the user
to visualize and dynamically move the anchor along a line or even place the
anchor off the line (e.g., over a nearby related feature, like a
building-to-street relationship). This would allow data defined curved
labels to work like moving text along a path in an illustration program,
and allow for precise control over label placement along a line without
forcing full pinning of the label.

* Additional options could be weighting the above/below line labeling
option (for off-line anchors), and quadrant and offset placement of the
label relative to anchor.

There may be other advantages to sending controllable label anchor points
into PAL. This is different than data defined x/y, which totally skips
chosen placement algorithms and essentially treats the feature geometry as
a point. Right now it is just conceptual, and I'd like to hear some
feedback.

Regards,

Larry

Hi,

Sounds interesting to me. Cartographers would love it! Esp. the dragging 
along a line. Sounds like something for QGIS 2.1.

The other thing that bothers me a lot is the efficient (performant) 
labeling of banana-shaped polygons ... this would be kind if it could 
still be fixed in QGIS 2.0. But I'd be also patient and wait for 2.1 ;-)

Thanks a lot,
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Volume between two surfaces
Message-ID: <1362523689.51319.YahooMailNeo@web122302.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

Is there any way to calculate the volume between two surfaces (two DEM rasters)?

There are ways to calculate the volume between a surface and a particular height value (GRASS r.volume or SAGA Grid Volume) but I can not find how to calculate the volumes (landfill / excavation) between two DEM.

Any tips?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Hello,
I would go for plain GRASS raster algebra solution.
diff = top_dem - bottom_dem # difference between two surfaces in DEM units
positive = if (diff < 0, 0, diff) # remove any errors/places where
excavation is higher than original
r.sum raster=positive
g.region -p
and multply r.sum output with size of single cell from g.region.

Take into account that large cells will produce larger uncertainty as
each cell is treated as a square prism.

Hope it helps,
Maris.

Hi,

I have a plugin which selects features on the map. When the user
activates render caching, the selection will only go visible after the
user interacts with the map again. Without render caching it works
fine. I just use:

self.vlayer.triggerRepaint()

Can a plugin override render caching?

Hi Maris,

Thank you very much!

With your directions I get the volume of landfill.

So, if I do
negative = if(diff < 0, ((diff)*(-1)), 0)

and then 
(r.sum raster=negative) * [pixel area]

I will get the volume of excavation, right?

Thanks!
Pedro

Hello,
I would go for plain GRASS raster algebra solution.
diff = top_dem - bottom_dem # difference between two surfaces in DEM units
positive = if (diff < 0, 0, diff) # remove any errors/places where
excavation is higher than original
r.sum raster=positive
g.region -p
and multply r.sum output with size of single cell from g.region.

Take into account that large cells will produce larger uncertainty as
each cell is treated as a square prism.

Hope it helps,
Maris.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Tool for creating unit tests for SEXTANTE.
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7xoUUxTCDN4qTy69q3DTgkYs-Pjc2E17fnqa1WG1X61bA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have been thinking about how to ease the process of creating unit
tests for SEXTANTE algorithms. Ideally, there should be (at least) a
test for each algorithm. I do not fancy the idea of automating that
and just feeding whatever data to an algorithm and checking it
produced something, since that is not a good solution. Instead, I
would like to have meaningful tests, taking a sample dataset, running
an algorithm, and checking it produces a correct result.

This is time-consuming, but I have created a small tool, so anyone,
even non-programmers, can use it and help us. Basically, you have to
run an algorithm using a test dataset that will be provided along with
SEXTANTE. Then you check that the resulting data is correct. If so,
you go to the SEXTANTE history, right click on that algorithm you have
just run, and select "create test". It will create the corresponding
python code that calls that algorithm with that same input values and
tests the output is exactly that one. That code can later be send
somehow, to be included in the testing suite.

Before lauching this and tell people to start helping us, I would like
to hear your opinion on it, and if you have something to add, please
feel free to comment.

Thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Zoom in and out using mouse wheel may use pointer
	position as center
Message-ID: <CACw3ADj_krNK3ON7sD+3DD0JJZFZb_rdeKx4HGYme0Cj8e5GuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

zooming in and out in qgis using mouse wheel does not change canvas center.
Why don't use current mouse position as center?

This would allow zooming to a small region without panning, with the
following steps:

1. position mouse in the desired position
2. zoom in with mouse wheel (desired position never exit the canvas)

Currently user usually do:

1. zoom in with mouse wheel until desired position exit the canvas
2. pan to recenter canvas around desired position. Due to the
imprecision of this operation zooming in a lot desired position may
exit the canvas again
3. repeat 1+ 2 until needed

Regards,

Gabriele Monfardini

I also wondered, before finding out it was a user setting.
Look in in all the configuration/preferences/settings menus.

Hi.

I was intersecting lines with polygons and was getting strange results.

I tried the exact same procedure in QGIS 1.8 and in QGIS 1.9

It works perfectly in 1.8, but in 1.9 the lines get splitted, but some of them dont take the attributes from the right polygon.

Here on QGIS 1.8 http://tinypic.com/r/3586grd/6 

Here on QGIS 1.9 http://tinypic.com/r/swbmvo/6 

All tickets I found related to that are closed.

Hi Victor,
thanks for that. I think the problem can be split in two:
* checking that a module works
* checking that it works well.
The first one would simply mean that a module would produce an output
(of the type expected); I think this check should be run automatically
at every commit into the sextante code, to be sure nothing breaks
badly. I think this should be very easy to implement, and could be
done soon. Most errors will be spotted this way. Many less used
modules can break without nobody noticing it.
Your suggestion address the second issue, and is obviously better, but
it will take longer to implement.
So I would suggest to implement the first one soon, doing the second
for a GSoC or other.
All the best.

This should be the default action of the mouse wheel zoom when doing a
fresh install.  I changed it to be the default before 1.8 was released.

Sounds like an issue with SVG rendering. Those are some of the newer icons
that have been switched over to SVG-only (regardless of theme). Maybe check
your C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qt4\plugins dir in imageformats and iconengines to
make sure your Qt SVG dlls are actually there?

Is this with a fresh build ? The macro was added long ago.

The staged_plugins_on_build target is created when WITH_STAGED_PLUGINS is
set to TRUE [0]. I believe the dependent target staged_plugins should
always be created if WITH_BINDINGS is TRUE. The new staged plugins setup
was committed over a month ago, with no appreciable changes since then [1].

What is the make command you ran?

Did you try re-generating the cmake build files?

Does this happen on make (all target) for the project with an empty build
dir?

What, if anything, has changed in your cmake setup between your last
successful build and this error?

Regards,

Larry

Ah, I knew it was a trap :)

That's odd; seems like those dlls should always be installed along with
'qt4-libs'. Means that Qt run time currently only has built-in support for
PNG. Did you just install 'qt4-devel' and not 'qt4-libs' ?

No I had everything installed.  I'm just going to nuke my install and redo

Not sure I understand what you mean. The macro is still always run. Under
the new setup, only the build directory staging is optional, though all
targets should always be created, including those for staging. The new
setup just give options on when and which ones are built [0 previous post].

Sorry, I wasn't in sync with latest changes.
I like the availability of multiple rules, althought I don't see
any reason, beside speed, to not always stage-install (is there any?).

I was looking at the new "staged-plugins" rule and to my disappontment
I found it being "staged_plugins". I dunno what kind of keyboard you 
have by on mine it takes 2 fingers to produce a "_" sign while it
takes a single one to do "-".

This is an important barrier to usability !

Would you mind if I change all rules to use "-" instead of "_" ?

For reference, GNU standard Makefile targets exist with "-"
but none exist with "_":

Not really. Just for speed of building. The staging is quicker as it now
checks if any files have changed before deciding to copy them. However, it
still takes quite a bit more time than not staging at all (significantly
more time on some platforms, slower boxes or virtual machines). So, I now
always leave cmake option for staging off, then run the additional make
commands as needed.

How much time it saves is relative to how often you build, I guess. I'm
doing a multiple daily builds on 3 different platforms for GUI testing now
and the compile time savings really add up.

It may be that I did not recompile last month. Does it require any new
dependency?

Nothing changed I think, I did git pull and when make failed I run
ccmake. I saw that some new strange things are missing, so I installed
bzr but I have still: DART_ROOT-NOTFOUND, HGCOMMAND-NOTFOUND,
QSCINTILLA_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND - are those necessary?

Hi all.
QGIS was very well received in the
http://www.sigte.udg.edu/jornadassiglibre/
That was not obvious, given the (past) obvious dominance of gvSIG in
Spain. One noticeable thing is that several new key features (server,
web clients, DB Manager, etc.) are not well known by users.
I think we should advertize them better.
All the best.

Maybe set WITH_STAGED_PLUGINS to FALSE (it's TRUE by default), possibly
skipping the build error, since that problematic target won't be
auto-built. Then, if successful build, try 'make staged_plugins' to stage
the plugins to the build directory, if you run QGIS from there.

QSCINTILLA_LIBRARY is the C++ library used by the Qsci Python module, used
in the new PyQGIS console. Currently only the Python module is linked to
it, i.e. no one has used QScintilla in C++ code. So, while it shouldn't
matter for current building if not found, it should have been found by the
.cmake script.

Not sure about the others. DART is probably for reporting test results to
the dashboard at [0].

Works OK, but if I set WITH_STAGED_PLUGINS=ON, make fails again, more
verbose output:

I can confirm that more people are moving each day from gvSIG to QGIS.
but still many people do not know about all the great functionality in
QGIS.

Paolo, it was great having you here, and I think that your talk will
(hopefully) have an interesting impact in the future of QGIS around
here. I will do my best to spread the word about QGIS as well  :-)

How can QGIS be not well received in any open source conference??

I'm generally happy to hear about more OS desktop GIS alternatives and
particularly happy to have meet Paolo there. Very interesting!

Cheers.

This is awesome stuff! It would be really create if these tests could
be run as part of our standard test framework (e.g. invoked by make
test), so that we could collect pass failure metrics accross different
platforms. Is this already the case, or something you could add
support for?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] kickstart wms dialog with wms url
Message-ID: <513B44E6.7070109@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

I'm thinking about using our national catalog server (csw) together with 
next-gis csw plugin to preview available WMS layers.

Making it easier to 'preview' a wms-service from a csw (catalog 
service), I thought to make it possible to kickstart the addwms dialog.

That is:
1) start it with only a wms-url (NOT in its current connectionlist)
2) make it do a normal getcapability request and show available layers
3) user can then view a layer by clicking on one of the layers and 
choose 'add' (the normal way)

But I encountered some problems trying to do that. Please correct me if 
I'm wrong or (if you can) provide an alternative for my strategy:

If I understand correctly my plan is not working. Because in the normal 
way to create/add a new wms connection, QGIS makes it store the 
connection information into the global Settings, so this 'connection' 
are for example available when you are going to add a layer.

But I thought to NOT store these connections, because I do not want to 
pollute my wms connections with all kind of connections I may not want 
to keep. Besides this, coming from a csw dialog, I have not given a name 
to the connection yet also.

Another problem for me seems to be that to make a new wmsconnection you 
always have to go through the QgsNewHttpConnection class which is a 
visual dialog (while for my purpose it would be nice if I could 
'silently' make my temporal connection?

Am I correct in this? Or am I missing something?

What would be the best way to implement this? Maybe create a temporary 
connection (named 'temporarily connection (save if you want to save it) 
), and discard it later (or let the user save it in between)?

Regards,

Richard

PS: I could off course take a shortcut and only use the uri + layername 
to add a rasterlayer via the 'addrasterlayer'-api. But then I would skip 
the getcapability step which makes it possible to check other layers in 
the service, and see if my image-type and crs are available etc...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] some questions about GRASS features in QGIS
Message-ID: <26EA5497-A5DA-41B7-8A9C-8D5171B999CE@kyngchaos.com>

I'm thinking about a packaging idea for bundling GRASS in the OS X app and need to know the extent of GRASS capabilities in the QGIS plugin. (I don't use GRASS in QGIS except to load GRASS layers, and that very rarely)  I'm trying to figure out if there is anything I can trim out of the bundled GRASS.

- Can the plugin access/start the GRASS GUI?  I mean just the full GUI started with g.gui.  Is there really any benefit to doing this in QGIS?

- Can the plugin use the command mini-GUI things (whatever they're called), that start when you run a GRASS command without parameters?  Seems redundant if it can, since the plugin has it's own GUI forms for filling in command parameters.

- Then there are a couple tools that only run in a small GUI interface, like NVIZ (in its multiple forms).  How does the plugin handle these?  Not at all, or let them run as is?

- Does the plugin initialize the GRASS environment completely on its own, or does it use any of the GRASS startup/init shell scripts?

- can the plugin run arbitrary GRASS scripts or modules (ie user scripts and addon modules)?

Not all the commands and options are included, so yes, it is useful,
even if unelegant.

It lets run them.

it could, if the module developer writes also the necessary qgm

Tim

I am going to start writing tests with the idea of eventually having
them added to the QGIS test framework. There are some test that have
to be written the usual way (tests of inner classes and methods), but
this is just an idea to simplify how the tests for algorithms are
created. I guess that once we have a good set of algorithm tests, if
they pass, that wil be a good sign, since they cover many different
cases. Then I will start with the "normal" tests, and this can be
moved to the QGIS framework anytime.

I agree with Paolo that we could have something automated (Camilo
started writing code for that), but we would be leaving out many
algorithms if values are selected randomly or are harcoded for the
whole set of tests. For instance, if we are testing an algorithm to
create contour lines, the values of the contours, or the interval,
have to be selected accordingly to the value range in the raster
layer. Otherwise, the algorithm will fail. In most cases, by setting a
fixed layer and a fixed numerical value, cases like that are to be
found. In other words, using an analysis algorithm is not trivial and
requires knowledge, so using random values or a fixed one for all
algorithm is likely to not work in many cases.

I said it before, but tests are my priority for the hackfest, and hope
to work on that with other people who are interested on helping.

Hmm, sounds like I can really only trim out the g.gui GUI.  I'd still need wxpython to handle the modules.

	Valmiera
Message-ID: <CAK8GbeDQUR5teBhnpcvkjTvFT+roJx7+yfK9w6zpOMATVEprzQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all 9th developer meeting potential visitors.

In parallel to hacking event on 12th of April is planned a
presentation session about QGIS and it's success stories aimed at QGIS
users from Latvia. Currently we have reserved two time slots for QGIS
representatives to give two talks about "What is QGIS and what to
expect from upcoming release?" (aka. the new cool stuff) and "How can
You help QGIS project". Thus on behalf of event organisers, I kindly
ask some of participants to step forward and give those talks (in
English).

Please let us know if You are willing to spread the word.

Preliminary event programme is available in Google doc. It is editable
for anyone. Feel free to add Your name and preliminary title.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAUYHvpvWuDLpqJOY-fnUsEKOFAac20GYih1O4o_n_Y/edit?usp=sharing

I kindly ask to make the decision fast and notify organisers to allow
us to include Your name + presentation title in event's advertising.

Don't hesitate to contact me or Peteris Bruns, if You have any
questions regarding developer meeting in Valmiera.

Than You!
Maris Nartiss.

Hi,

I see that Marco Hugentobler and Otto Dassau are at the dev-meeting and
suggest you ask them. Marco could do the technical presentation - what's
new and what's coming - and Otto could do the community presentation.

Just my suggestion.

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-rJDh7q4YS4yzD1DYqPOdGawKhqf5_Cm9m+ECp58ejag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Has anyone noticed that the Google based layers in the OpenLayers plugin
are misaligned when zooming in to about 1:1000.  I have some property lines
that look ok when zoomed to 1:1500 but anything under that and the scale of
the image seems to be wrong and everything becomes misaligned.

1:1500 http://i.imgur.com/th4pSD4.png
1:1000 http://i.imgur.com/1GWfXZf.png

The more you zoom in the more the shift changes.

Regards,
Nathan

If this is an issue, IMHO you can skip it. Users will have to revert
to the shell, which is not bad after all.

Message-ID: <20130311153317.ddec9c82d81c0684ebafc8a9@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've tried to implement functionality for changing raster brightness
and contrast in QGIS in addition to existing contrast enhancement
functions. Code available in my GitHub fork in "brightness_filter" branch [0].

Also, as suggested by Radim, I added readXML() and writeXML()
methods to base QgsRasterInterface class, to provide uniform way for
saving/loading filter settings.

Currently new toolbar buttons have no icons, but request for icons
already filed in OSGeo trac [1].

Any comments are welcome, I plan to merge this code into master in
next few days if there are no objections.

Hi Victor,


Thanks for your reply.

Sorry, it was my fault.
Running ccmake once solved the issue.

Message-ID: <1363005872427-5039575.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 

I have developed a Python plugin to QGIS 1.9.master. Trying to get it to run
in QGIS 1.8 I am getting the error: "ImportError: No module named lxml".

Are there any ways to include the lxml library in a QGIS 1.8 plugin and
distribute it?

Is there any change log on the QGIS Python API from 1.8 to 1.9. Comparing
the earlier API version at www.qgis.org/api/ is not optimal. 

Thanks,
Jakob

Hi all,
as discussion about the next release has already started, so here is
the periodic issue report.


Regressions number has raised quite a lot in the previous weeks, we
are at 57 right now

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=23


Issue tagged "causes crash or data corruption" are 28 (34 minus 6 that
are also regressions)

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=27



There are 22 pull requests on github (the older has 4 months, the newer 2 days)

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pulls

plus 37 tickets on redmine with a patch applied

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=32



The above report does not include Sextante (tickets have not yet been
merged), but it should as it is a new core feature

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/sextante/issues?query_id=44

Sextante bugs tickets are 74 at the moment.


Cheers!

For me, April 1st will not be enough time to finish this work. I'll

I also think April 1st as general deadline for new features is the 
better way. Looking at the 22 open pull requests, I don't think core 
developers will be happy to have some more time to review than March 15 
would offer.

I'm not sure what the best way is to keep new features coming but at the 
same time guarantee for stability.

One thing, while not directly connected to release schedules, is the 
way, issue reports work. We've got now close to 2000 open issues. More 
than anyone could handle. I think we need to shoot down some of the 
non-issues to allow the real bugs to gain some attention. And then keep 
the issue count down by e.g. automatically closing issues being in 
"Feedback" status for more than 2 weeks.

Anyway, I didn't want to distract from the real discussion.
I would appreciate some more opinions on this topic about the way 
forward - and eventually a decision with support from the PSC.

Regards,
Matthias

Just a nuisance, really.  It adds another 60MiB to the package (20MiB zipped) for OS X (GRASS app total with it is 140MiB, 50MiB zipped).

Message-ID: <20130311134554.GA27461@utopia.topf.org>

Hi!

I missed support for easily using web tile servers in QGIS for a long time and
finally decided to do something about it. :-) (I am not talking about WMS-type
servers, only about those where all you have is a URL pattern such as
http://tile.openstreetmap.org/${z}/${x}/${y}.png .)

Somebody wrote down how this can be done with QGIS using GDAL:
http://www.3liz.com/blog/rldhont/index.php?post/2012/07/17/OpenStreetMap-Tiles-in-QGIS
Thats already pretty impressive, but it is harder than it should be. So I
started working on a plugin: https://github.com/joto/qgis-plugin-tiled-map .
This will give you a menu where you can easily add servers that are pre-defined
in a .yaml file. (Of course this should be configurable from QGIS at some
point.)

Now to my question: This works all very well and does mostly what I want.
But there is one issue: Of course QGIS/GDAL will resize the tiles from the
servers to fit the current screen. That's okay in many cases. But I want
to at least have the option of "snapping" to the right resolutions (will,
of course, only work in EPSG:3857).

There is already "Tile scale" panel that is used for WMS-C. Can I somehow
enable this from my plugin? I looked into the core C++ code and it looks
like it is very specifically tied to one data provider:

  if ( !rl || rl->providerType() != "wms" || !rl->dataProvider() )
    return;

Maybe this can be done in a more general way?

Is the "Tile scale" panel the right way to go? I want the user to have the
choice whether they want the snapping or not. I am not sure how the panel
is supposed to work in that case.

Message-ID: <CAOJAE5okQkCFwF5F-nJZoPqRexD4oK49MJ-e=oCNpMeQJUduiQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a whole bunch of markers (QgsVertexMarker), and I'm trying to
highlight the active one when the selection in a list changes. To do this I
make the active marker red, while the others are green. However, in order
for the new colour to be visible, I have to do a mapCanvas().refresh(),
which takes about a second. The idea is that it should be quick and easy to
scroll through the markers, so it's quite annoying that it takes so long to
just change the colour. Is there some other way to update just the marker
itself? I see there is a paint(QPainter) method for QgsVertexMarker - is
there some way to use that?

Thanks,
Rudi

FYI, the openlayers plugin is essentially doing something very similar.
Your scale issue might be similar to what Nathan was seeing yesterday 
too where tiles don't always line up right.

I tried the OpenLayers plugin and it seems rather flaky, sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn't. And it seems it only works with the original Mercator
projection of the tiles not with other projections.

There are no problems like this with the GDAL/WMS approach/my plugin. Scaling
raster maps will always look crude, there is no way around that. I really
just want a button or so that snaps the current view to the right resolution
so that no scaling is needed at all.

Not quite the same:
Early versions of openlayers plugin were bound to the scales the tiles 
were designed for. This was somewhat annoying, and it was changed to use 
all scales freely.

What Nathan ran into was a misbehaviour only with Google satellite 
imagery in high zoom levels, possibly due to the fact that those tiles 
are not available at the same defined highest zoom level throuout the world.

It definitely works. Only disadavantage is that some tiles do not show 
up, if the server does not respond in time. It just needs to move the 
map a bit around, to see the missing tiles.

Thats true, but reprojecting tiles individually looks rather bad. You 
have to load all tiles, mosaic them together, and then reproject the 
result. But this may take too long.

It actually works quite well with the GDAL-WMS provider/my plugin. Tiles are
cached so after a while only the reprojection needs to be done and it is
amazingly fast. Of course that depends on what projection you are using.
Of course the projected raster tiles still look rather bad, but you get
what you pay for. :-)

Sandro has updated the target names to be more in-line with Gnu target
naming conventions (using - instead of _) [0]. Everything else, as far as
the workflow, remains the same.

Example: 'make staged_plugins' is now 'make staged-plugins'

Hi Radim,

Could you start an issue ticket for this, possibly including some specs,
like which version of cmake, compiler, etc.? I can not discern what might
be causing the problem for your setup, but working for everyone else (I'm
assuming that), and would like to exchange some patches since I can't
reproduce it here.

Thanks,

Larry

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Francophone Open Source Geomatics day (FROG) in
	Paris
Message-ID: <40091330.99yhdf4FqF@helios>

(Sorry for cross posting this email)

OSGeo-fr, the french speaking OSGeo local chapter, is organizing on 10th of 
June 2013 the Francophone Open Source Geomatics day (aka FROG) in Paris inside 
French IGN building (at Saint-Mand?, close to Paris).

FROG is one day of conferences and meetings on several topics around OSGeo-fr 
projects and is a great opportunity to bring all together the community of 
users, developers or just curious of free software in geomatics.
The event is expected to attract around 150 people.

This meeting will share our experience by 25 mn conferences in two parallel 
sessions: one technical, dedicated to software develoment, the other will be 
more focused on practical use.

You are an expert in a field related to free GIS? You are using OSGeo stack in 
a specific context (major project, big data management, innovative project, 
etc.).? You are participating in a
free project linked to the OSGeo? So don't hesitate to give a presentation! 
You are warmly welcome!

Contributors to the Francophone Open Source Geomatics (FROG) who wish to do a 
presentation of their projects should submit an abstract before 15th of march 
2013.
Abstracts should be sent by email in plain text at the following address see 
http://frog.osgeo.fr/AppelContribution (fr).

In the following days a three days sprint code is organized. All FOSS4G 
projects contributor are warmly welcome to add any information on the wiki 
page to help us to organize it. See http://frog.osgeo.fr/Sprint for more 
information.

For any inquiries, you can send us an email to conferences at osgeo.asso.fr

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem using QgsFeature.attributes() instead of
 QgsFeature.attributeMap() in QGIS 1.9
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_EyATFkj87f7HGEEqNBwny7vF-ZO4f4w84H=V8mjNP8VA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to adapt my plugin (multipart
split<http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/splitmultipart/>)
to work in the master version 1.9. at some point in my code I had something
like this:

...
new_attributes = layer.pendingFields()

        for j in range(new_attributes.__len__()):
            if provider.defaultValue(j).isNull():
                if QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT < 10900:
                    new_attributes[j] = feature.attributeMap()[j]
                else:
                    new_attributes[j] = feature.attributes()[j]
            else:
                new_attributes[j] = provider.defaultValue(j)
...

But when using it in 1.9 I got the following error in the line:
new_attributes[j] = feature.attributes()[j]

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line x, in <module>
TypeError: QgsFields.__setitem__(): argument 2 has unexpected type
'QVariant'


Any advice is welcome.

Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

Message-ID: <CAPzumuEcrGSEo4D35T-yO3cDo9f6R1UMjOFBWvenG8WfGn4x6w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear devs,

Some QGIS users in my local community would like participate in the
hackfest.  This is just to get other people familiar with how QGIS is
developed and hopefully contribute more in the development.
Is there any specific task we can work on? Such as bug reporting and
squashing, documentation, etc.

We have a big time difference:
http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_LV.aspx?y=2013&mo=4&d=12&h=10&mn=0

It would be nice if there is some sort of G hangout or other
communication with us on how to get started or participate in the
hackfest.

Hello Maning,
currently there are no plans how to involve remote participants into event.

As there might be more remote participants, we, event organizers,
would like to hear what kind of participation forms You and other
remote participants would prefer?

Any advices based on previous meetings experience?

Maris.

We have enough serious issues, is not sufficient to set
WITH_STAGED_PLUGINS=OFF by default?

I think the default should be that output/bin/qgis works and can load
all new core plugins, so developers can test and users can use multiple
versions. That seems to currently mean "staged plugins".

I can't find any issue filed on hub where [Subject contains "staged"]

You mentioned that WITH_STAGED_PLUGINS=OFF works for you, right ?
Does "make staged-plugins" work after that ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer]  Build problem with Postgresql 9.2
Message-ID: <513EF640.4020304@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to prepare QGIS binaries for the release of openSUSE 12.3 
(in 2 days) and I am getting some Postgres 9.2 related build error.

Build log is here:
https://build.opensuse.org/package/rawlog?arch=x86_64&package=qgis&project=Application%3AGeo&repository=openSUSE_Factory

The error says:
[ 714s] make^2 <http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7331#fn2> : *** No rule to 
make target `/usr/lib/postgresql92/lib64/libpq.so', needed by 
`output/bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi'.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Angelos

Yes, as I already reported. It is

   make staged-plugins-on-build

causing the problem:

   *** No rule to make target `staged-plugins', needed by
`python/plugins/CMakeFiles/staged-plugins-on-build'.  Stop.

No. My original idea of GRASS plugin was to only support those modules

In the theory it could if a command is run from shell, but that was
not intention of the plugin. Again, the idea was either plugin GUI or
nothing.

Unfortunately that commands were also added to the plugin modules
instead of just implement 3D view in QGIS.

Yes, on its own, in QgsGrass::openMapset() or QGIS may be run in GRASS
shell which was previously set up by standard GRASS start up script.

Do you have a `python/plugins/CMakeFiles/staged-plugins-on-build.dir'
directory ? What version of cmake are you running ?

Hi all.
Just installed QWC on a new machine, straight from git (nice
improvements BTW, thanks!). I notice that the map is not correctly
reloaded when refreshing the page; generally going back one page and
forth is ok, but often the app hangs, and no map is displayed.
Any hint of what can I do?
Thanks.

For the record, it works here with cmake version 2.8.7
I think it'll be worth filing a ticket with all info gathered so far.

Hi
Maybe you can replace QgsVertexMarker with QgsMapCanvasItem which has own
paint method? This is implemented in GPS live tracking.
You can find sample code here:

Dear Maris,

We don't really want to disturb existing plans nor the dev's focus on
coding.  But if there is way for us to help remotely, please let us
know.

Layers with no titles? Is it a hack to avoid the layer title to be
drawn in the legend for single symbol layers? Wouldn't it be better to
modify composer legend so that single symbol layers will be drawn
without separated layer title above symbol and the layer title text
will be used as the symbol label?

Radim,

Thanks for fixing the width issue.

Regarding layers with no titles and the need for treating the space like a
layer item, see http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3605. We've discussed this with
Marco Hugentobler back then and came up with a nice compromise.

Beyond being a regression as it stands (i.e. legends from 1.8 projects will
have visible vertical spacing issues), here's a simple scenario in picture:
http://hub.qgis.org/attachments/3161/legend-simple-scenario.jpg (the
spacing should be equal for all companies, as well as btween roads and
railways.

Having no layer title is a way to regroup many layers under one layer name
(i.e. having 5 shapefile polygons representing different ago-industrial
crops might nicely be represented under one layer title even though the
items are in five different physical shapefiles).

Math

Only one short question I would like to ask:

When should one expect to be able to build QGIS by using Qt5?
Any plannings ideas?

Hi devs

The first part of the symbology improvements is available in my github fork:

https://github.com/mhugent/Quantum-GIS/tree/data_defined_symbology

Currently, one symbol is either in mm or in map units. The changeset in 
the branch adds the possibility to mix different output units ( mm / map 
units ) in one symbol and even in one symbol layer. So it is now e.g. 
possible to have line width in mm and line offset in map units.

Let me know if you have feedback on this. Next enhancement part will be 
to add more data defined symbol properties (from attribute / expression).

Regards,
Marco

I think the suggestion by Paolo Corti, to use the GeoNode way of using
git branches, is a very good solution to this.

IMHO we should be very careful before closing tickets. To focus on the
most relevant ones, I think the current approach (using priorities) is
reasonable.
All the best.

IMHO we should make it as easy as possible to allow more people to
join the HF remotely. In fact, having multiple synchronized HFs
throughout the world would be a great thing.
Any hope to start during the next one?
maning: I plan to work on the website, with the aim of publish the new
version by the end of the HF. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
All the best, and thanks.

I agree with Paolo,

during the next HF I will close, as usual, as many obsolete tickets as
it is possible. The vast majority of the tickets tagged as "bugs" are
real bugs (less important or more important is not the point).
Probably many tickets tagged as "features" (more or less 50% of the
tickets) can be closed, we will see.

What are you actually trying to do?

layer.pendingFields() returns QgsFields instance, which basically acts
as a list of QgsField instances (attribute definitions). Then, you are
trying to assign an attribute value (QVariant) to a field - that's
clearly an error and it is reported correctly. Probably you want to
copy the attributes to another feature?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Sextante integration of WPS client
Message-ID: <1938290.yYhbJWhi5v@polarwind2>

Hi,

The WPS plugin with Sextante integration in https://www.kappasys.ch/svn/wps is 
now ready for others to look into. The major work was an extraction of shared 
WPS client code into a wpslib package. Testing of the native GUI is very 
welcome, since a big amount of code had to be touched. The Sextante support is 
far from complete yet. WPS bookmarks are shown in the Sextante toolbox and can 
be executed from there.
The next tasks are:
1. Update toolbox tree after adding new bookmarks
2. "Current selection only" checkbox
3. BBOX parameters
4. Support for use in modeler. Currently the process description is loaded 
just before the input dialog is openened (as in the native GUI).
5. Register raster types supported by Sextante
6. Support for multiple raster and vector inputs
7. Replace error/warning message boxes in wpslib with callbacks
8. Handle literal outputs

Any help is welcome!

Pirmin

Hello List,

I think that actions in QGIS are really powerful but not very accessible.
The access through the attribute popup is not very intuitive as actions
don't really deal with attributes. Furthermore, to reach actions, two
clicks are necessary

A left click and a right click has the same effect.

Why not targetting actions with a right click?

Best,

Mathieu

You can also use "Run feature action" button from the "Attributes"
toolbar. Moreover, you can bind shortcut to call this action.

Just for the record, right now it is necessary to call
f.initAttributes(..) to tell the number of attributes. Before 2.0 I
would like to update QgsFeature API a bit to make things easier: e.g.
QgsFeature(fields) constructor call would also call initAttributes()
and setFields()

Hi Alexander,

I dn't see my actions in the shortcuts List.

Nice ways to get it done but not the most intuitive way for the basic users
that open qgis in my admininstration.

Why do the left and right click perform the same thing?

Wouldn't be nice to get the right click opening a contextual menu with the
list of actions?

Just an idea for the developers!

My two cents ;-)

IMO, using empty layer title to achieve grouping of items from
multiple layers into a single layer (group) is just a workaround. If
it was working for some reason in previous versions (probably because
there was no difference between layer and item spacing) it does not
mean that we must add new and new hacks to the code to support it
forever.

I am not convinced that removing layer space if the layer title is
empty (http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/08c8857/diff/src/core/composer/qgscomposerlegend.cpp)
is good. It is a hack to support your need but it introduces another
bug and inconsistency because other user may require hidden layer
titles (if empty) but still keeping layer spacing.

A clean solution could be to add a new group "Road & Railways" with
roads and railways layers inside and implement something like flatten
sublayers check box for the group, which would put items of all
sublayers directly into the group, ignoring layer titles.

Hi, 
+1 with Mathieu, actual action button needs to first choose an active layer
and then to choose which action to execute on click. 

Using right click might be intersting since it could be always available,
whatever the tool selected. 
Another possibility is Mapinfo 's behaviour that we copied in Hotlink Plugin
(in repository). 

User has to choose hotlink tool (a thunder icon). On flyover, a tooltip show
up with the list of all action titles located under the mouse cursor ( +
display field info), for ALL layers. 
On click, a dropdown listbox shows up allowing to choose what action to
execute. 

I agree that starting having a right clic contextual menu would be better
since user do not have to change his current tool. The downside, it will
give the habits of right clicking everywhere (composer too) and we should
have a global discussion about contextual menus in QGIS, so that we have a
consistent UI behaviour everywhere.

+1 for right-click actions. Also it would be useful if plugins could add
actions to the right-click menu.

Hi,
+1 with Radim. Such hacks do produce inconsistencies and bugs not compatible with collaborative coding. IMHO, we need clean coding in QGIS.
A feature already asked I remember could solve both issues. Some of us asked that for layers having single symbol style, symbol in legend should be drawn on the same line as layer?s title (like in Arcgis or mapinfo).  http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6960

Using groups will then help reaching Mathieu?s goal?
Opinions?

I?m ready to put that in a contract if needed

Objet : Re: Multicolumn legends in print composer

IMO, using empty layer title to achieve grouping of items from
multiple layers into a single layer (group) is just a workaround. If
it was working for some reason in previous versions (probably because
there was no difference between layer and item spacing) it does not
mean that we must add new and new hacks to the code to support it
forever.

I am not convinced that removing layer space if the layer title is
empty (http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/08c8857/diff/src/core/composer/qgscomposerlegend.cpp)
is good. It is a hack to support your need but it introduces another
bug and inconsistency because other user may require hidden layer
titles (if empty) but still keeping layer spacing.

A clean solution could be to add a new group "Road & Railways" with
roads and railways layers inside and implement something like flatten
sublayers check box for the group, which would put items of all
sublayers directly into the group, ignoring layer titles.

Hello Martin,

Thanks for your answer. You are right, I was not doing it correctly in the
first place.

For 1.8 it "worked" cause I was able to swap each QgsField for a QVariant,
in 1.9 with the QgsFields that is not possible anymore.

So I have changed it for:

                    if QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT < 10900:
                        new_attributes = feature.attributeMap()
                        for j in range(new_attributes.__len__()):
                            if not provider.defaultValue(j).isNull():
                                new_attributes[j] = provider.defaultValue(j)
                        temp_feature.setAttributeMap(new_attributes)
                    else:
                        new_attributes = feature.attributes()
                        for j in range(new_attributes.__len__()):
                            if not provider.defaultValue(j).isNull():
                                new_attributes[j] = provider.defaultValue(j)
                        temp_feature.setAttributes(new_attributes)

I don't like the repeated code, but I was not sure if checking for QGIS
version for each attribute was much better.

Thanks again, and sorry for the time wasted, I know you guys are quite busy.

What's described below is cool, would work out just fine : ) having this
alongside groups would work perfectly, probably even better than hack-ish
status of the past.

That should be default, it is what most users are expecting, I
believe. This should not be changed in major line, so if we want that,
it must be implemented for 2.0.

He asked for single symbol item labels, I have commented and suggested
single line representation of single symbol layers instead.

Hi all.

During a course, I found several minor issues using an oldish
(298f0c0) qgis-dev:
* zooming from the bookmark definition popup does not work (double
click does)
* the layer properties window is too wide for 1024 px screens; it can
be resized, but the text does not wrap
* statistics command from fTools hangs
* enabling topological editing does not work for all points (logic
unclear).

If confirmed on master, I can open the tickets.
Thanks.

In this case I think rather than having a context menu dedicated just to layer actions, it might be better eventually to have a more general context menu, with actions in a submenu.

I think context menus would be good everywhere ;)

For most people when a right-click does anything different from opening a context menu they are surprised - assuming they even notice what it did.  If the right-click function is moved into a context menu then they will know what it did, even if they didn't read the manual. 

I guess getting rid of all direct right-click functions might upset some existing users, because an extra click will be required for the same function, but it will of course allow more functions to be added.

IIRC I think there is a recent proposal for context menus in the composer - in a ticket or pull request for paste to original coordinates.

Alister

Message-ID: <CALPrXdr2U7J5jjEdA-B4bTOxXgZ9MuxpvY_gbu3dDFCDEWF+wg@mail.gmail.com>

In the 1.x console API, you could use:

output = sys.stdout.get_and_clean_data()

to grab what was sent to stdout via print statements.

Is there an equivalent way to do this with the 2.0 API? I'm not seeing it...

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Ideas on the SVG symbols library
Message-ID: <CAExk7p2_dN6gun70Yw6Ya-yx7bk2-HoPJ63fXBxHKJD_98it-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

Here are some thoughs about the SVG symbols library.

Currently, some of the pictograms come with a blue frame, some with a black
frame, some with a colourised frame and some with no frame at all.
There's some redundancy between the symbols (for instance the "airport"
symbol, which exists several time with different stroke/color).
There are some composed pictograms, but other are missing (there's an
"indoor swimming pool" but no "indoor skating rink")

Since the symbology allows for multiple layers, providing the pictograms
without the rounded square would allow for a much more flexible use :
- put the pictogram in another shape (no shape, circle, square, etc...)
- independently set the colors and the strokes of the pictogram and the
background shape
- compose pictograms together or with other elements (glyphs...)
- easier to add items by simply loading a pictogram

The main drawback I see is for beginners : they'd have to understand that
it's possible to have two layers before being able to have nice symbols.
But that could be managed by having a two-layer symbol by default.
I guess that if for the sake of backwards-compatibility, it would be a bad
idea to completely remove the current images. Would there be a way to
regroup all the old symbols in a folder where we'd keep old icons ?

If we don't go this way, we could at least try to make most symbols support
the "fill" and "outline" parameters (see http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3269 ).
This feature could even be improved by replacing the "fill" parameter by
two parameters : "foreground" and "background". Or we could use the "stroke
color" parameter for the foreground, but that wouldn't be very explicit.
Or even better : provide a table widget displaying each unique color used
in the SVG where you could override each color individually. So you could
customize the colors of any SVG, without needing to prepare it specifically
for QGis customization.

What do you think ?
Is it worth working on this ?
Did someone already start something heading in the same direction ?

Cheers,

Olivier

PS : please don't misunderstand me, most symbols look really good in the
current library, it's just that I find it a bit frustrating not being able
to customize the symbols a little more when using it...

+1 with you alister. We could put that global target on 2.1 roadmap maybe. 
contextual menu are generally used for differents purposes:

1- access properties of the object you click in . 
 for mapCanvas, you could have shortcuts to projection settings, project
settings, current zoom and scale, refresh content, stop redraw.  I think
some shortcuts to render global options could be nice. I often have to play
with antialiased rendering / number of objetcts to draw when displaying very
large datasets. A shortcut could be nice. Do you see anything else.


2- actions under the click location (layers actions, plugins actions, finsh
editing of a feature). 

we must precisely decide what happens for editing use case, where right
click is used today top finish an object.. Thoughts?

Message-ID: <CAML4Tunj1XY2TqV1u=dYKv-41S-e_jqGv5t-d-LnPLdR1vU+pQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to this mailing list. I am writing a plugin for QGIS in order to
perform complex cost surface analyses. I wrote some code in Python using
GDAL, and it works but it is too slow. So, I'm considering the possibility
to re-write the plugin in C++, but C++ plugins are less documented and I
have few questions:

- can they be deployed in the same way Pythons plugins are? (Or, if not,
what the user shall do to install the plugin and what have I to do deploy
it?)
- which library shall I use to read and write raster data from a C++ QGIS
plugin? GDAL or a specific QGIS API? And if the answer is GDAL, can I trust
that this library will be installed in final user's pc?

Thanks!!

C++ can't be installed via Plugin Installer. Users should download
plugin library (.dll or .so) and put it in right place manually.

You can use any library for raster processing. GDAL is one of the
possible solutions. If you decide to use GDAL, don't worry, QGIS
itself relies on this library, so users will have it on their PC

Thank you Alexander,

I'll finish the Python plugin, because I think that inexpert users will prefer a module that will be slower but easier to install.

+1 For giving some additional use to right-mouse-click in map canvas.
Context menus seems coherent with most of software that I have worked with.

I'm not sure about where right-click direct actions are used, I can only
remember the finish feature edit.

For currently actions using direct right-click, I see a few alternatives:
1 - The action is the first on the context menu ( need 2 clicks and breaks
current usability);
2 - Assign function key for those actions (fast but breaks usability, not
suitable for mouse position dependent actions);
3 - Change right-click direct action to Shift + Right Click ( faster, and
kinda keeps usability);

I personally like the solution 1 + 3, direct action is detached at the top
of the context menu and can be accessed directly (no context menu is
showed) if one presses Shift (or Ctrl) while clicking.

I have to tried to install the latest versions of the ECW plug-in without
much success.

It is imperative that we have an ECW plug-in that is easy to install,
bug-free, and does what it does in ArcGIS.

I can understand Fred's frustration. Let's see a new plugin in OSGEO4W
sooner than later.

I am currently following this up as we need it here in Australia or else we
could loose a lot of users.  It has come down to licencing issues.

+1 with you Alexandre,
Modifier key for click + access to action in contextual menu (plus a tip to explain the use of CTRL+Clic or SHIFT + clic) is a good solution.
We seem to reach a consensus for actions .. Anybody else?

+1 with you alister. We could put that global target on 2.1 roadmap maybe.
contextual menu are generally used for differents purposes:

1- access properties of the object you click in .
 for mapCanvas, you could have shortcuts to projection settings, project
settings, current zoom and scale, refresh content, stop redraw.  I think
some shortcuts to render global options could be nice. I often have to play
with antialiased rendering / number of objetcts to draw when displaying very
large datasets. A shortcut could be nice. Do you see anything else.


2- actions under the click location (layers actions, plugins actions, finsh
editing of a feature).

we must precisely decide what happens for editing use case, where right
click is used today top finish an object.. Thoughts?

You are free to sponsor the development and maintainance of such a tool.
You are free as well to pay for the ECW licence.
You are free to put pressure on ERDAS for them to make ECW available as 
opensource and allow its distribution
You are free to explain to your data provider that offering data in proprietary 
formats is a bad idea
You are free to finance a new open wavelet compression format

I was going to write the same thing, ECW is proprietary viper's nest, 
the work to make it usable on QGIS should be done by ERDAS or by the 
people using it.

For those wanting a good wavelet format, there is OpenJPEG 2.0. If it 
doesn't fit the bill for you then they should think about supporting it 
like the CNES did instead of asking a open software to support a black 
box with a stupid license.

Here is a very documented blog post about the comparative use of ecw or
compressed gtiff

http://blog.webmapper.com.au/

You can use basic gdal command line to get a compressed gtiff from ecw,
with very good performances. For example :

# convertir l'ecw
gdal_translate -of GTiff -co "TILED=yes" -co "PHOTOMETRIC=YCBCR" -co
"COMPRESS=JPEG" input.ecw output.tif
# cr?er la pyramide
gdaladdo -r average --config COMPRESS_OVERVIEW JPEG --config
PHOTOMETRIC_OVERVIEW YCBCR --config INTERLEAVE_OVERVIEW PIXEL
compressed.tif 2 4 8 16 32 64 128

Will provide a geotiff with great performances and not so big compared to
the ecw.

And as other suggested, open source wavelet is in progress too and must be
burried out !

self-defense...

1) from this archive (http://goo.gl/XiG21) copy gdal_ECW_JP2ECW into
C:\OSGeo4W\bin\gdalplugins\1.9 directory.

2) copy all other dll of previous archive in C:\OSGeo4W\bin and
C:\Windows\System32 directories

don't ask me why but it works!

this is valid, obviously fo sure in windows; i don't know for other O.S.
it works for brand new installation of qgis via osgeo4w both for 1.8 version
and dev. version

currently doesn't exist a similar method in the new console, but all the
print
statements are catched from the console.

I had to delete the QgisOutputCatcher class because I got some problem with
the text styling in qscintilla lexer.

However, I think it is better revert that method or add a similar.
I'll try fix it asap.

Thanks for catching it :-)

1 May 2013 - GUI Freeze and String freeze - no changes to ui or
strings except where required for critical bug fixes. Call for
translations.
1 June 2013 - Branch 2.0, code freeze (except for packaging related
changes), call for packaging
7 June 2013 - Public release of 2.0

Regards

Tim

It is very simple for Windows.  This is based on Giovanni Manghi's web page
http://www.faunalia.pt/node/438

However, instructions for copying the dlls into their respective directories
are not clear.  

On Windows:

(1) install Quantum GIS with the osgeo4w installer
(2) install this package
"http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/Download.aspx?file=release-1600-gdal-1-9...\gdal-19-1600-ecw.msi"
(obviously without the inverted commas)
(3) using windows explorer go inside c:\program files\gdal and find the two
.dlls, libecwj2.dll and gdal_ECW_JP2ECW.dll
(4) copy libecwj2.dll into the c:\OSGeo4W\bin folder
(5) gdal_ECW_JP2ECW.dll into the c:\OSGeo4W\bin\gdalplugins\1.9
(6) start up QGIS into the osgeo4w folder
(7) add raster layer using add raster layer command
(8) select the image file ending in ecw

There you have it.  It should work.  I successfully loaded ecw files this
morning.

Thanks Giovanni

A slight revision.  I inserted the wrong link to the GDAL's MSI installer. 
The correct one is in place now.  It should work without a hitch.

Manu users are not administrator of their pc, so it's easier to copy dll's
into proper directories.
Are the instructions not so clear?

The instruction I have provided are clear and tried and proven.  I am
successfully using ECW files thanks to Giovanni Manghi's instructions.  I
put them in here so that any user can install the GDAL-plugin simply and
with a minimal number of steps.

It also means that a user does does not paste dlls into the system
directories.  Instead only two files are copied to the appropriate
directories in the OSGEO4W folder.  It is that simple once one has obtained
the GDAL-ecw plugin and the library file from the MSI installer provided by
Giovanni.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Lizmap Web Client and Plugin: new versions
	released !
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7A_qd5F0eSOmZrhZy=r_f+0Y2EO2H7ZD7-3ehJLHEZwA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

We are pleased to announce the release of a new version of
LizMap-Web-Client 2.7.0 and a new version of the LizMap plugin (1.8.0) for
QGIS

This new version brings some interesting new features:

* Online documentation (build in restructuredText with Sphinx). It is now
only in French, but we will try to set up a pootle instance and start
translating it into english). For now, you can use Google translate, which
helps a bit I hope
It contains the plugin and Web application docs:
http://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=fr&ie=UTF-8&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.3liz.com%2Ffr%2F&act=url

* Printing Support
Users can print the first composer found in QGIS.  External baselayers
(Google and others) are not printed.
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-plugin/interface/map-tab.html&usg=ALkJrhgFUsGomkk7H7r4wzidSPzS34OBMg#impression-simple

* Support for "annotations"
Users can add new features to a Spatialite or PostGIS layer of the QGIS
project. Once the geometry is created in the web interface, a popup with a
form will appear and let the user fill in the fields data. The form uses
nearly all the edit types (list of vales, checkbox, text edit, range,
etc.). Only the addition is available for the moment, hence the name
"Annotation" and not "Edition"
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-plugin/interface/tools-tab.html&usg=ALkJrhiFHXV5cJ6wc8DFdtrvUKG143-_Vg#couches-d-annotation

* Geolocation
This tools allows the user to automatically find its position on the map.
For mobile devices, GPS is recognized and allows more precise positioning
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-plugin/interface/map-tab.html&usg=ALkJrhgFUsGomkk7H7r4wzidSPzS34OBMg#positionnement-automatique

* Address search
A search input let the users search for an address. The geocoding engine is
currently Nominatim, which uses OpenStreetMap data (
http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org ). The search is restricted to the
extent of the QGIS project.
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-plugin/interface/map-tab.html&usg=ALkJrhgFUsGomkk7H7r4wzidSPzS34OBMg#recherche-d-adresse

* Zoom History
The user can go back (and forward) while navigating in the map.
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-plugin/interface/map-tab.html&usg=ALkJrhgFUsGomkk7H7r4wzidSPzS34OBMg#zoom-precedent-suivant

* Measure tools
The measuring tool allows the user to measure areas, perimeters and lengths.
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-plugin/interface/map-tab.html&usg=ALkJrhgFUsGomkk7H7r4wzidSPzS34OBMg#outils-de-mesure

* Location layer
A dropdown list is generated from objects in a vector layer to provide an
automatic zoom on one of the objects of the layer. Up to 3 different layers
possible.
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-plugin/interface/tools-tab.html&usg=ALkJrhiFHXV5cJ6wc8DFdtrvUKG143-_Vg#localiser-par-couche

*Rendering order for layers
In QGIS, we can decouple the rendering order of the layers and the order of
appearance of those in the legend. Lizmap now supports this feature.

* Server cache management
Possibility for the administrator when connected to remove the server cache
layer by layer from the online legend, via a red cross next to each layer.

* Client cache
It is now possible to configure the timeout for tiles in the browser cache.
This means that if the images on the map are in the browser cache and not
expired, no new request to the server is sent: the image is displayed
directly from browser cache. This optimizes the display of layers
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-plugin/interface/layers-tab.html&usg=ALkJrhgcno9HxUMm2AW3uQL1kJpLluf35w#utiliser-le-cache

* Ability to hide layers of the QGIS project

Just put the layers in a group called "hidden" and they will not be visible
in the web interface. This can be useful to hide the annotation layers, or
layers you wish to retain in the project but not published online.
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-plugin/features/hide-layers.html&usg=ALkJrhiTrVlQpd9e1MqXivexBwaWOi6izQ

And other features:

* Management of web map scales: min and max scales are used to restrict the
display of the online map.
* Addition of an animated gif next to each layer during the loading of the
data.
* Added icons for all map tool menu and dialog boxes.
* Using the EPSG:3857 official projection instead of EPSG:900913 for
reprojection to external baselayers: remember to change your projects!
* Popup: Changing the way we call media files into HTML templates popup
(see documentation)
* Legend: possibility of transforming the parent groups in separate blocks
legend.
* Bug fixes and interface problems on some browsers.
* Added the Lizmap Web Client version number in the administration panel,
menu "Lizmap Configuration"
* Ability to keep session alive by checking a box on the login form

To see and test these features:
https://demo.lizmap.3liz.com/index.php/view/map/?repository=montpellier&project=montpellier

The complete source code of Lizmap Plugin and Lizmap Web Client, and the
documentation, is online at Github:
https://github.com/3liz/

To see all the code changes since the last official version 2.4.1
https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-web-client/compare/2.4.1...2.7.0

We would especially like to thank for this version 2.7.0:

* The Natural Park of Ballons des Vosges, which funded the development of
annotations, zoom history, the possibility of grouping parent groups in
blocks, and trusted us since the beginning of the Lizmap adventure.
* Andromede Oc?anologie, which funded the support for simple printing,
measure tool and geolocation tool.
* Salvatore Larosa for translating the plugin and Web application into
Italian.
* Everyone who gave feedback and tested Lizmap.

Regards

Michael Douchin

Hi all.
I see that new plugins are still accepted without a repo and a bugtracker.
I think this is bad practice, and makes the whole process unreliable,
with a bad user experience (e.g. I just spotted  serious bug in this
plugins, and I have nowhere to open a ticket).
Could we implement this?
Thanks.

It is easy enough to make those fields required in django, perhaps with 
a note/link to where to create them if you don't already have (aka hub).

Trickier but still possible is to modify the django form validation to 
verify the links are real.

Even trickier yet, but most useful is to ask the user if they want an 
issue tracker/repo created for them and have django interact with 
redmine for them.

I won't step on toes, but I can create a patch for the 1st idea if no 
one else is available.

Thanks,
Alex

+1 for me.
It would be good if someone (the plugin manager?) could write all the
plugin authors who did not include a bugtracker and repo, asking them
to add it.
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Selecting with On-the-fly enabled (PyQGIS)
Message-ID: <1363598238955-5041031.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi everyone, 

I have problems with a specific task. I intend to write a new module, during
which the user has to select features from the map canvas. My project is in
EPSG:23700. There are shapefiles from different coordinate systems, such as
EPSG:23700, EPSG:4326, EPSG:32633 and even without projection. On-the-fly
projection is enabled.

Everything works fine when selecting features from the EPSG:23700 and the
projection-less features. But when I try to click on a feature in the other
files, they are not highlighted and therefore not selected. When I disable
the on-the-fly projection, the EPSG:4326 and EPSG:32633 features are
transformed back to their normal place, and I can click on them. But I
INTEND to use on-the-fly projection, so this is a big problem for me. 

When I use the official icons for selecting features, however, the selection
works just fine with features from ALL EPSGs. 

Does anyone has an idea what should I do? I'm quite new to Python
programming and to the QGIS API.

My code looks like this (only the important parts):

class LelohelyBejelento:

    def __init__(self, iface):
        self.iface = iface
        self.canvas = self.iface.mapCanvas()
        self.clickTool = QgsMapToolEmitPoint(self.canvas)
        self.dlg = LelohelyBejelentoDialog()
        self.selectList = []
        self.cLayer = None
        self.provider = None
		
    def initGui(self):
        self.action = QAction(QIcon(":/plugins/lelohelybejelento/icon.png"),
u"Lel?hely-bejelent? k?sz?t?", self.iface.mainWindow())
        QObject.connect(self.action, SIGNAL("triggered()"), self.run)
        self.iface.addToolBarIcon(self.action)
        self.iface.addPluginToMenu(u"&Lel?hely-bejelent?", self.action)
        result = QObject.connect(self.iface,
SIGNAL("currentLayerChanged(QgsMapLayer *)"), self.handleLayerChange)

        # connect to the selectFature custom function to the map canvas
click event
        QObject.connect(self.clickTool, SIGNAL("canvasClicked(const QgsPoint
&, Qt::MouseButton)"), self.selectFeature)
    
    def unload(self):
        self.iface.removePluginMenu(u"&Lel?hely-bejelent?", self.action)

When fetching features from vector layer/provider, the rectangle you
specify as a filter is in layer's CRS. To convert from project's CRS
to layer's CRS you can use QgsCoordinateTransform class, or with a
convenience call in QgsMapRenderer (which can be accessed from
QgsMapCanvas) - something like this:
layerPoint = canvas.mapRenderer().mapToLayerCoordinates(layer, point)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Editable checkbox for field widget definitions
Message-ID: <aba103608025daa2a91ffe980979685a@carto.net>

 Hi,

 The new editable checkbox for the field widget definitions is useful - 
 but it behaves quite strange.

 If I set some widgets to "not editable" (checkbox unchecked) and then 
 do some other widget changes and then return back to the field that 
 wasn't editable before, it falls back to "editable". So either there is 
 a field-index problem or some other reason that the checkbox set 
 manually by the user falls back to the initial state.

 Can others please check if they can replicate this behaviour?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Message-ID: <CAJBK7JG9XofwYer3wu6p+v6FT-xMr58HDP8nXjoFay4HiZXt9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,
I was configuring search panel in qgis-web-cilent following the readmin you
can find on gh

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-web-client

I noticed that search panels are configured statically in GlobalOptions.js
declaring vars as following

var simpleWmsSearch =  {
 /* ... */
  formItems: [
    {
     /* ... */
      fieldLabel: "fieldname",
    }
  ],
  /*... */
  selectionLayer: 'layername',
};

var mapSearchPanelConfigs = {
  "projectname": [simpleWmsSearch]
};

It's ok for a limited number of projects, but what if I wish to make it
indipendent from projects? (so I can have a search panel for any project I
have on the server without touch GlobalOptions.js).
Is there any way to do this dynamically in qgis-web-client or it needs to
be implemented?

Thanks,

Hi,

when building qgis from source (fresh git checkout just to be sure) I 
get the following error:

just adding a line with "int a2State = 0;" @55686 seems to resolve the 
problem, at least at compile time, but I'm not sip-literate enough to 
know if this is the right solution...

Best,
Vincent.

 Hi,

 I noticed that in the current master the label settings are not 
 correctly loaded from the QML file. They seem to be exported but on 
 import they are not applied.

 Can others confirm? If yes, I will do a bug report.

 general documentation regarding the C++ API)
Message-ID: <CABSrVubZc6H_UJYUmDvPv0sZdEouwtH5a19yBQft6wnZV=PRaA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

having no experience with mailing lists I tried to find kind of a QGIS
forum, but did not find anyone.

I hope, it is the right place to ask the following questions and may find
some help :-)

1)
I launched the first tutorial describing the first simple use of the QGIS
API (findable under
https://github.com/qgis/qgis-code-examples/tree/master/1_hello_world_qgis_style)
and would like to know, why I get the app output:

 *Layer is valid*
* *

*QWidget::repaint: Recursive repaint detected*
* *

*QPainter::begin: Widget painting can only begin as a result of a paintEvent
*
* *

*QPainter::setRenderHint: Painter must be active to set rendering hints*
* *

*QPainter::setRenderHint: Painter must be active to set rendering hints*
* *

*QPainter::worldTransform: Painter not active*
* *

*QPainter::save: Painter not active*
* *

*QPainter::restore: Unbalanced save/restore*
* *

*QPainter::setWorldTransform: Painter not active*
* *

*QPainter::save: Painter not active*
* *

*QPainter::setOpacity: Painter not active*
* *

*QPainter::restore: Unbalanced save/restore*
* *

*QPainter::setWorldTransform: Painter not active*
* *

*QPainter::end: Painter not active, aborted*


The only change from my side was the adaption of the pathes to the plugins
directory and my smal spatialite database.


2)

I opened my database in QGIS application and created a *.qml style file,
but how do I apply such a style to a QgsVectorLayer using the C++ API?

I tried the following without success:


*const QString myLayerStylePath = app->applicationDirPath() +
"/../rsc/styles/lines.qml";*

*bool resultFlag;
QString errorMsg = mypLayer->loadNamedStyle( myLayerStylePath, resultFlag );
if ( !resultFlag ) {
qDebug() << errorMsg;
}*

*
*

There was no error message but no rendering too!?


3)

Is there any detailed documentation for the use of the API? The only not
really complete one I found is http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook**

4)
My last question I hope to find any help is: How do I search throw the
discussions in the mailing list to avoid to ask duplicated questions?

Many thanks
joomie

I could install the plugin without any error. However, there is a
problem with the server hosting the qgis-selection files. I will
advise when it is fixed.

thanks for that; could we consolidate the structure, moving the files

I would like to finish off cpt-city color ramps before 2.0 release.
Here are a few points

1)
Currently, there is a limited number of ramps installed by default :
72 ramps, with a number of variants.

The color ramps plugin allows to install more collections, and also to
update when available:
- a "qgis selection" collection (385 ramps, 600KB as zip, 3MB on disk)
- the full the cpt-city collection from the official cpt-city website
(3000 ramps, 5MB as zip, 40M on disk).

Ideally, I would like to have the larger collection (385 ramps)
installed with qgis - would this be advisable? This would require an
additional 2.5MB of space on disk and about 0.5MB to the installers.


2)
Updates to the "qgis selection" are currently available in a personal
server and should go to one of the qgis servers, as Paolo mentions. Or
we could do away with these if the selection is chipped with qgis.

That would require an available directory to host a few files (e.g.
http://qgis.org/downloads/cpt-city/), can I send these to someone?
There should not be many updates, just every once in a while.

I have tried hosting them on the hub.qgis.org site, but it is not
possible to have directories, which the update script requires.

3)
Integrate the Color Ramps Manager inside the Style Manager UI or in
the Preferences. The update script has been written in python and I do
not have the time to re-write it in c++. But I could update the Style
Manager / Preferences code to match the settings changes in the color
ramp manager.

cheers
Etienne

I fear it is a redmine limitation... Also any new files have an id
added to them which makes things difficult
(e.g. http://hub.qgis.org/attachments/download/4772/cpt-city-qgis-2.02.zip )

Thanks Giovanni!

I am a bit unsure what parts of the layer settings are exported/imported
and what parts not.

Other examples that do not get exported/imported:

* the filter expression in the general tab
* the layer title (display tab)
* title and abstract (metadata tab)

Haven't tried actions, joins and diagrams ...

I think we should export and import everything (except the layer id) or
allow the user which parts should be exported/imported. But this is
something that could wait for version 2.1 ;-)

Hi there, 
A up to that topic since feature freeze is almost there (sorry I didn't
realize my need earlier).
My corp is using -- configpath option to move profiles to Windows Server
2008 official location (/AppData/Roaming) so that profiles can be
centralized for all servers.  We have .qgis moved, but settings store in
registry. 
New behaviour in 2.0 will move profile AND registry to Qsettings files. This
will make it quite hard for us to manage all user settings as we use regedit
tools. *Is there any hope to have a startup option to move only profile for
2.0??? *
If not, I will have to pay for a custom package (which is bad , long and
costy).
 
We couldn't achieve the alternative option working by cheating qgis with
Symbolic links .. That would have been simpler

Hey,

Wouldn't the new behavior be better as everything is stored in one place.
 This is not a bug pre se because before it was leaving the settings in
the registry which makes it hard/impossible to make a sandboxed QGIS run
environment.  What we might need to do is come up with some better command
line options something like --homepath --settingspath etc.

I had a nice big rant, because this really ticked me off but I'll bring it back to a few fairly simple points. 

1. This is not about throwing money at a problem. It's a legal quibble problem. After that it might be a money problem.
1a. More importantly, for the *user* this is about removing easy access to a feature. (Translation: It's a regression).
2. This an option, but the plugin still needs to be there.
3. The ECW Project Manager has been asked for an opinion (the PSC has a copy), and I do not see this as incompatible with OSGeo4W continuing to provide the ECW plugin.
4. My major data providers do not yet provide Jpeg2000 as a standard option. This leaves me with options of an ECW which can probably be processed one day and emailed the next; or any other option which will go on a hard drive and the postal service will sit on (or kick around) for a week before it gets to me.
5. Yes, I agree they're bad. But there's a heck of a lot of legacy ecw around, particularly in Australia. (There's a lot of doc and docx around too)
5a. GDAL does a much better job of turning ecw into something else than anything else I've seen. But if ecw isn't accessible, then the data is effectively lost.

It's not just up to me. It's also up to QGIS to work out what sort of uptake it wants. Particularly here in Australia there is a *lot* of existing ecw, for example at the first Australian QGIS forum, ECW use ran at around 90%. It will make it extremely difficult to show off QGIS if it can't be easily shown to handle their existing data. Once we have the foot in the door then we can start the weaning process.

-ramon.

In case this triggers the "don't say anything bad" email, I'm writing this from my involved *user* perspective.  I'm also writing in a QGIS advocate sense. I'm not meaning criticism, but I am meaning to express serious concern that this one decision will make both my life as a user and particularly as an advocate in Australia much harder.

Yes. Very quickly too.

Because I look at this through a QGIS lens, the PSC has a copy of the correspondence. I'm not prepared to put it up on the mailing list. The essence though is that in the OSS setting, the installer of the SDK is deemed to be responsible for correct usage.

Additional info that might be relevant (as others do not seem to see 
this): my sip was updated not too long ago to 4.14.4. Could that cause 
the error?

Thanks Nathan,
I agree that current master -configpath behaviour is the right main target. I'm just asking for a way to move homepath, and keep settings in windows registry. This is very specific for enterprises I guess.
Is there any chance to have this in 2.0? I'm on the way to fund bug fixing to help with 2.0 release but what I ask is sort of a new feature. It's just not totally new since I just ask to be able to keep installing 2.0 just like I did for 1.8.
Thanks for your help
r?gis

Hey,

Wouldn't the new behavior be better as everything is stored in one place.  This is not a bug pre se because before it was leaving the settings in the registry which makes it hard/impossible to make a sandboxed QGIS run environment.  What we might need to do is come up with some better command line options something like --homepath --settingspath etc.

Hi there,
A up to that topic since feature freeze is almost there (sorry I didn't
realize my need earlier).
My corp is using -- configpath option to move profiles to Windows Server
2008 official location (/AppData/Roaming) so that profiles can be
centralized for all servers.  We have .qgis moved, but settings store in
registry.
New behaviour in 2.0 will move profile AND registry to Qsettings files. This
will make it quite hard for us to manage all user settings as we use regedit
tools. *Is there any hope to have a startup option to move only profile for
2.0??? *
If not, I will have to pay for a custom package (which is bad , long and
costy).

We couldn't achieve the alternative option working by cheating qgis with
Symbolic links .. That would have been simpler

As a side note: what licence do these data have? If the licence allows
it, why not collecting them, translating, and putting on a shared space?
This will help users, and hopefully also push data providers to
upgrade their offer.
All the best.

Paolo,

It's not so much that you can't change it it's just there a lot of
providers here in Australia to only give ecw out. Some of these files are
big as ecws so converting them to GeoTIFF would be impractical, plus a lot
of work and data storage. JPEG2000 is another option but unless the
providers change then user wont.

Regards,
Nathan

Once provided a comandline, perhaps with a simple webapp, this could
be easy. And with so many more-or-less-free storage providers around,
space should not be an issue.
Anyway, that's just a second choice, of course.
All the best.

Hi all.
Anyone interested in following this up?
All the best.

Oggetto: [OSGeo-Discuss] [Google Summer of Code] Deadline for filling Ideas pages -
28th of March
Data: Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:28:56 +0100
Mittente: Anne Ghisla <a.ghisla at gmail.com>
A: OSGeo Google Summer of Code list <soc at lists.osgeo.org>, OSGeo Discuss list
<discuss at lists.osgeo.org>, edu_discuss at lists.osgeo.org

Hello all, and sorry for cross-posting,

Mentoring organisations application time is now open, and will end by
28th of March.

All OSGeo developers are invited to discuss ideas and write them down
in the relevant projects' Ideas pages - see the list of 2012 Ideas here:

http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2012_Ideas#The_ideas_pages

The whole page contains links and clarifications about Google Summer of
Code program.

Of course, projects that were not participating in 2012 are equally
invited to create a 2013 Ideas page.

It is important to fill the Ideas soon, because OSGeo application will
contain a link to these Ideas pages: the more we have, the more we show
we are willing to take part in GSoC 2013.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards!

Anne

Subject: [Qgis-developer] mmqgis unavailable on 1.8
Message-ID: <514883C3.4070509@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi Michael, I just tried to install mmqgis via the python installer on 
qgis. the plugin is not visible on the list of available plugins for 
1.8. If I use my selfcompiled master then no problem.
It probably has to do with the min version being 1.9.

Ciao

Marco

Thank you for the note. I had to make a major upgrade to use
the new vector API in 1.9 and there was no practical way
to make that backward-compatible. I hoped that the plugin-installer
on 1.8 would handle that and suggest an older version, but I guess
that is not the case. I thought of setting the experimental flag,
but I don't think that solves the problem.

Do you have any thoughts on how to deal with this until 1.9
gets rolled out more universally?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] fTools and GdalTools: sextante vs original plugins
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFf71a8GGY+p-AmOAg2nZbkGnjhO8wXjV9=yxeRh4mcO5w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been wondering recently about the status of original fTools and
GdalTools plugins and their algorithms in SEXTANTE. As far as I
understand, the implementation in SEXTANTE is independent from the
original plugins. That means that any changes in fTools or GdalTools
have to be ported manually to SEXTANTE (and vice versa). Also the
users must be confused by having two completely different ways how to
trigger the same algorithms. Maintaining both versions will be painful
for us and our users.

The port of original algorithms to SEXTANTE seems to be nearly
complete  and SEXTANTE has superior approach of creating the GUI for
algorithms dynamically (similar to GRASS toolbox) instead of manually
creating GUI for each algorithm. So...what about removing the original
fTools and GdalTools plugins before 2.0 and focusing on improvements
of their counterparts in SEXTANTE?

Regards
Martin

it does not seems so easy to me, in sextante there are missing tools,
just to make examples, (gdal) clipper, gdaldem, eliminate sliver
polygons... and others.

Before doing that, we should make sure all algorithms are in SEXTANTE.
Some of them might not be in there, because I did not ported them,
considering that another algorithm was equivalent. Particularly, the
dem tools and the interpolation tools in SAGA should replace the ones
in GDAL and add much more options. Moving those GDAL algorithms to
SEXTANTE would allow to remove the GDAL tools...but will add more
redundant algorithms to SEXTANTE (there are DEM tools already from
SAGA and GRASS), so we have a similar problem.

Anyway, I think that redundancy in SEXTANTE is not so bad as having
several ways of doing the same thing in the QGIS interface, since
users will understand that algorithms come from differnt providers and
are not completely identical.

Agreed: redundancy in analyses helps double-checking, and overcoming eventual bugs.
The filtering mechanism in Sextante makes redundancy far less confusing than the
usual dropdown menu approach.
So I vote for moving all algorhithms to Sextante, and removing GDALTools and fTools
only when the former is well tested.
Thanks.

hi list

I am wondering whether anyone has any news about the gsoc project on
vector layer generalization for qgis, described in (1).

It sounded promising but it seems this work has not been integrated in
qgis. What is the current status ?

Hi,

would there be any objections to remove QgsQuickPrint class from GUI
library? It was created back in 2008 as a quick way how to produce a
rendered map with fixed layout in PDF format - at that time the
composer was not as powerful as it is nowadays... I can hardly think
of a reason why would anyone want to use QgsQuickPrint instead of
composer. And given that it got virtually no updates last few years, I
consider it as abandoned.

Hi !

Just for information :
- will QGis 2.0 have the PyQt API changed to version 2 ?
- will it have a separate plugin folder than QGis 1.8 ?

Thanks !

+1 for removing fTools and GDALTools.

But unfortunately not all fTools and GDAL tools algorithms ported to
SEXTANTE, some of them still present only in original plugins. I
plan to work on this.

Also note that some users have no SAGA installed but when similar
algorithm from GDAL (or other more common source) is available they
still can do their work. So redundancy is not bad.

The GSoC was aborted on this.
If you are interested, consider activating another GSoC for this year (deadline soon).

I'd encourage that those tools still be made available via the Vector 
and Raster menus. Also that they should be update-able via the Fetch 
python plugins. Preferably independent of Sextante upgrades, but still 
be the integrated version.

I also would miss the command line viewer that's in GDAL Tools. That is 
extremely useful when prototyping something that I plan to move to a script.

Does sextante allow for batch application the way GDALTools currently does?

So basically, I'm all for streamlining but I don't want to loose 
features and flexibility because of that.

Alex

Message-ID: <51496629.9050608@carto.net>

Hi all,

The Swiss QGIS user community is increasingly building application
modules around QGIS. Most of these modules require database relations -
not only 1:1, but also 1:n and n:m relations. Currently, only 1:1
relations are supported (with some limitations) in QGIS through the
table joins.

Since many upcoming QGIS applications will require also 1:n and n:m
relations we want to make database relations a core feature in QGIS.

Matthias Kuhn from Switzerland already started work on this and will
continue to work on it. Some swiss communities started funding this and
other efforts in QGIS - now we are looking for some additional funding
and are also approaching the international QGIS community for financial
support.

Matthias and Denis Rouzaud (both from Switzerland) already worked on the
following forms and database improvements:

* drag and drop forms designer - allows to easily re-order form widgets
and group them in tabs and groups
* combining forms and tables into a single window (dual view)
* Allow to step through all records and forms one by one
* Filters/Selections apply on both forms and table
* database relations manager allows to set foreign key database
relations (regardless of the provider - you can join f.e. a
Postgis-table with a SQL-server table)

The next steps would be the nested forms where one can embed one child
form in another master form and the records are filled into the child
form automatically based on the relation defined in the relations manager.

We are looking for funding of CHF 13'000, approx. 10'500 ? or 13'700 US$
to complete this work for the nested forms.

If you have an interest in database relations and more complex forms
please consider to support this important QGIS feature that will in the
future allow to build more complex tools and applications with QGIS and
databases.

If you are interested, please contact me and I can forward you the more
detailed specification of what we plan with the nested forms.

Thank you,
Andreas

Hi!

I am usually also for cleaning up - and removing stuff like duplicate
labelling and such things but for functions like GDAL and fTools i rather
tend to hold them as long as there are not all equivalent function
available elsewhere.

My point would be to rather clean the GUI (less automatically created
button bars) than try to get rid of them by deleting functions.

Would it be possible to make just a clean GUI with only the basic functions
(I know .. what are the basic functions) .. but with the possibility to
build up one button bar by oneself adding only the functions I would need?
I like the idea of automatically appearing buttons but with a lot of
plugins activated the space is crowded.
I think it would be good to create a complete customizeable button bar ..

regards
Werner

Hi again,

I wanted to add that the proposal also includes managing relations
(adding/removing relations) by picking one or more feature geometries in
the map or one or more records in a related table, once the relations
are defined in the relation manager and the widgets are defined accordingly.

Thanks,
Andreas

While we work on moving everything into SEXTANTE, a quick solution can
be to add new algorithms in SEXTANTE that call the fTools and GDAL
tools and pop up the current dialogs. They will not be available in
the SEXTNATE modeler or batch processing interface, but at least they
will be in SEXTANTE and we can have all analysis stuff available
there, which might be less confusing.

We should find the way, however, of making clear that this is a
duplicated functionality and that those algorithms are different to
the rest of them

Not sure it is the best idea, but well, I guess it's worth commenting.

Cheers

I'm afraid it would be super confusing to have tools in Sextante but
not available in Modeller.

hmmm, I agree that, in this case, it will be confusing, but SEXTANTE
supports having algorithms that can be in the modeler and not in the
toolbox, or in the toolbox and not in the modeler. There are already a
few of them, though they are a bit different to these ones.

I forgot about the command line window and the (folder) batch
geoprocessing in gdal tools...

please don't get rid of them without a replacement :)

Hi!
As I've seen there are some problems round git in the last time ..
Probably it could help using some GUI tool for that ..
For all windows users I recently found [0] which looks very promising ..
Just to inform you and probably help git users on their first steps ..

Hi R?gis,

Given the current release schedule this won't make it into 2.0, but
would go into 2.1 then.

Previous work made by Matthias is either already in master (the drag and
drop attribute designer), or pull requests hanging (the dual view
attribute/forms work).

The relations manager is almost finished I heard, but is not of much use
without the nested forms - so probably will be postponed to version 2.1

That sounds good to me, 
I'm reviewing current blockers, and we already have some work with current
features for 2.0. 2.1 seems good.

Hi,

when I created  the git repository for the colorrampmanager plugin, a
network error occurred and the repository is somehow corrupt.


$ git push gitosis at qgis.org:colorrampmanager.git master
ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly


I have read and write access to other plugin repositories on qgis.org,
so it is not an access problem.

Can someone please fix the problem, or remove the repository so I can
re-create it? I do not know who has actual access to the server.

It would probably make sense for it to have a separate plugin folder
and also a separate QSettings namespace.

Message-ID: <CALPrXdpymyENgXvpW5MUFzq4+19ckmNg6U3yrDvwt=9FfcNbXA@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any provision for running a plugins custom post-install method
during installation via the plugin installer?

Setting "first-run" flags in the plugins settings seems kludgy...

Message-ID: <CA+Ei1Oea=moHKne3hAYyCuc2LVFzbvRrSDOhwC+9gSc1+k7fvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

for teaching purposes I am creating sample C++ application built on
QGIS libraries. No compilation problems on Linux. Unfortunately I have
several problems on Windows, after some investigations, I have
installed

Qt 4.8.4 (VS 2010) + VS 2010
from OSGeo4W qgis and qgis-devel

When building my C++ app in release mode [1] I am getting

name of missing module (roughly translated):
QtCore4.dll!??4QString@@QAEAAV0@$$QAV0@@Z

Any idea? Any Windows gurus here? :-) (\me happy to stay with my GNU/Linux ;-)

Use qt from OSGeo4W and VS2008.

See recent issue ticket for info on downloading VS2008 with SP1 as an ISO
[0], which might be useful if installing on many machines in a classroom.
VS2008 with SP1 produces no critical errors when compiling recent sources.
The rest of the issue about jom.exe you might want to ignore (unless you
want to use Qt Creator with NMake) and stick with VS2008, and just follow
the INSTALL doc very closely [1]. There are some updated .bat files for
launching with correct VS2008/OSGeo4W environment variables noted in that
issue as well (slightly different paths than in INSTALL notes).

Note, while I'm definitely no Windows guru, I have recently gone through
this build setup from scratch on a couple of Win7 64-bit virtual machines.

Further checking: it is obviously a local problem: on the same machine, a clean VM is
working well.
All the best.

Hi all.
With current master, measurements on screen when projection is in degrees returns
values in meters. A while ago one could obtain measurement in meters, even for 4326.
This is a regression to me.
All the best.

Mainly do a one-time configuration process such as setting up individual
user config files.  I can envision other tasks that are required for the

It's user configurable in the Project Properties in 1.8. Did that change 
in master?

Or do you mean when projection on the fly is on?

That's rather odd... I ran it the day before yesterday without problems

does the directory exist? /home/paolo/.qgis//python/plugins/test_plug

Please modify the script to contain the following lines and run again
(untested).

        # fix permissions: dirs are 755, files are 644
        print('datadir: '+str(datadir))
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(datadir):
            os.chmod(root,0755)
            print('root: '+str(root))
            for f in files:
                print('f: '+str(f))
                os.chmod(os.path.join(root,f),0644)

Which install directory are you using in the color ramp manager?

Yes, OTF on, Project properties > meters.
I expected measurements in maters, but they are in degrees.

What if the user (accidentally or intentionally) removes the so-generated
configuration files ? Would it make more sense to make the effects of this
one-time process detectable to re-run when needed ?

thanks a lot, it helped. Another problem - loading data providers (my
sample app loads Shapefile)

QgsProviderRegistry::instance(QgsApplication::pluginPath());

doesn't seems to work.

QgsProviderRegistry::instance( "/usr/local/lib/qgis/plugins" );

it works as expected.

Thanks for any hits, Martin

Message-ID: <20130321112905.GA26033@gnash>

After a recent update of the code all the arrows in topology
views (db_manager) are rendered with about a double thickness.

If I open the Style tab of the layer I can see that
"Pen width" is 0.6 for the Line decoration and 0.5 for
the Simple line components, but the line decoration is more
than doule as big. It's still more than double if I set it
to 0.5, only starting to look the same at 0.2.

This is happening with commit:fe6b4ad

Can anyone confirm ?

Hi there.

After making a clean install of 1.9 - 174 (before vector merge) I'm missing some icons in the toolbar, namely Pan Map to Selection, Toggle Editing, Save Layer Edits, and Current Edits.

I thought there was a themes folder in qgis, but I can't find one even in other installs where this problem doesn't occur.

So my question is: where are the icons stored and can I replace them with a complete set?

Thanks,
Duarte

This is due to the new SVG based icons.  I had to reinstall qt4 from
OSGeo4W in order to get the QtSVG libs to install.

Give that a go and see what happens.

Hi,

Sorry if it is not the right place to report.

I have an account on hub.qgis.org. I can add comments to tickets and
create tickets.
But a ticket cannot be assigned to me (which would be the case for
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7408 for instance), except for tickets that I
created (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6484).

My name or account name does not appear in the "Assigned to" drop down
menu. Did I miss something ?

Hi all,

Is there a straight way to achieve an interpolated identification on a 
raster?

Let's say I have a DEM, and I'd like to calculate an interpolated 
altitude at a given position.
The identify method returns the nearest neighbor (the pixel under the 
mouse pointer).

Or could you point me to a direction?

Thanks,

Denis

1.8?  initAttributes is part of the new vector api.

Some version in between?   IIRC addMapLayer is in 1.8, was temporarily removed
from master, but readded recently.

1.8?  it's .crs(), but epsg() was removed too use authid().

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 1.8 shows only last record of a delimited
	text imported layer
Message-ID: <CACH1WLDJ5Mc5d3g75ELuD1s-og2gaA81q03ZvmXz3Hm-xLtY_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,


I'm experiencing problems running the following script in QGIS 1.8:


---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---

from qgis.core import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *

inFileName="/tmp/test.csv"

url = QUrl.fromLocalFile( inFileName )

capaImportada = QgsVectorLayer( QString.fromAscii( url.toEncoded() ),
"testLayer", "delimitedtext" )

pr=capaImportada.dataProvider()
pr.featureCount()

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayers( [capaImportada] )


---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---

("test.csv" is attached to this message)



In QGIS 1.8, pr.featureCount() shows the correct number of features (7L) but the
feature table always shows only the last record. The layer metadata also
seems correct. Tha same happens both in Windows or Debian.


The script works fine in QGIS master but that means to adapt all the
code of my plugin.


An alternative coud be to use the OGR driver:

  capaImportada = QgsVectorLayer( inFileName, "ogrTest", "ogr" )

but I need the ability to ignore an arbitrary number of lines at the
beginning of the file, but I cannot find any way to do it with OGR.



Does anybody know of other workarounds?



Best regards,

Thanks a lot - that was on master from a while ago - I'll update and check again.

I'm new to QGIS on Mac OSX with fink. I installed python-psycopg2 on fink but
have trouble making QGIS recognize my path. In my .bashrc file I have

export
PYTHONPATH=/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages:/sw/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/Applications/QGIS/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/lib

but QGIS seems to miss this. Any advice?

Thanks lots.

Since you mentioned it, I noticed in my 1.8 install that the units
always says m even when in a projection that is feet, but the actual
measurement is correct. Makes me wonder if it's just the units failing
to switch.

Hmm, that appears to be the preferred units override...

Hi all.
On a few machines (QGIS 1.8 on win) defining label size in map units works correctly
only when zooming in. At lower zooming levels, the labels remain of the same size on
screen. On Linux qgis master behaves correctly. A local/solved problem, or a hidden one?
All the best.

I did multiple experiments with triggers and QGIS. It is working nicely.
Also QGIS versioning plugin (pgVersion) is using rules and triggers for
editing views.

yes - the PostgreSQL rules and triggers usually work without problems.

I use them often when I deal with views.

Message-ID: <514C5486.2000008@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am looping over features of a layer using new API (QgsFeatureRequest).
If I modify a feature and do: layer.updateFeature(f), my loop is broken.
Is this a normal behavior?

What should I do if I want to modify features during the loop?

Thanks

Denis

Do you mean your loop is exited when you call updateFeature?

Can you post your code.

Yes exactly

             f = QgsFeature()
             iter = vectorLayer.getFeatures( QgsFeatureRequest() )
             while iter.nextFeature( f ):
                 print f.id()
                 f.setAttribute( field, QVariant( 1 ) )
                 vectorLayer.updateFeature( f )

Prints only 1 id, commenting the last line prints all ids.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugins with no metadata
Message-ID: <1363958836070-5042350.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
I've seen that metadata.txt is now mandatory for plugins (good thing). 
I've seen a side effect on existing installs, when plugin is installed
previously without metadata (FastSQL Layer, Import Project... ), there is no
error message. Installer displays 'installed' status, but plugin is not
loadable. 
Could we throw a error message on load for those plugins so that authors
modify them?
Cheers

Applications on OS X do not inherit the shell environment.  The simplest solution is to install my psycopg2 python package for the system python.  My QGIS uses the system python so it will automatically find it.

If you compiled QGIS yourself using that python.org python that I see you have installed, then you need a psycopg2 in that site-packages folder for QGIS to find it.

Hi Matthias,

Thanks for your reply.
This should work better, the loop is not exited.

However, my field values are set to NULL using either 
changeAttributeValue(s) on vector layer or on data provider.

I tried:

vectorLayer.changeAttributeValue( f.id(), fieldIdx, QVariant(alt) )

vectorLayer.dataProvider().changeAttributeValues( {f.id(): {fieldIdx: 
QVariant(alt)}} )

Both return true, but changes are not written. I also tried without 
transforming the values to QVariant.

Do you have any hint?

Thanks,

Denis

If updateFeature is indeed doing feature request inside and breaking the
loop then that is a bug.  updateFeature should not affect the feature
request.

Also Denis.  You can simplify the code a lot like this:

for f in vectorLayer.getFeatures( QgsFeatureRequest() ):
    f[field] = 1
    vectorLayer.updateFeature(f)

The misfeature is that there can only be one active iterator per provider (see
also [1]).  So the feature iterator in updateFeature closes the iterator of the
loop.

replacing

>                      vectorLayer.updateFeature( f )

with

		       vectorLayer.changeAttributeValue( f.id(), field, 1 )

should help.

Jurgen,

What is the purpose of doing all the extra feature lookup in updateFeature?
Just so that don't change all the attributes everytime? I doubt there would
be that much overhead to really care, I would even say the getFeature
request would be slower then just changing all the attributes each time.
 To me this method is broken an shouldn't call getFeatures.  The method is
just updateFeature it shouldn't do anything more, especially not change my
iterator .  If we want to implement attribute change tracking it should be
done on the QgsFeature, which would be easy, not in QgsVectorLayer.

You could then just do (in updateFeature) (in python):

attributes = f.getChangedAttributes()

for index, value in attributes.iteritems():
    layer.changeAttributeValue(id, index, value)

I tried to reproduce this, but vectorLayer.changeAttributeValue( id,
idx, value ) works for me for integer and string fields (without
converting them to QVariant manually, but that should not hurt). The
only thing that happened was, that when I tried to set an integer field
to a random string value, it was set to 0 instead.
I had an attribute table window open to verify, which updated the
changes immediately.

Sorry,

Matthias

To record just the changes on the undo stack and not load of changes that
actually don't change anything.

I don't see a way to currently get what changed without looking up the current
feature in the process.

features are not tied to layers.  QgsVectorLayer (and it's edit buffer)
currently track the changes to features of a layer.

The bug is that the providers have a notion of active iterators.  The iterators
should be independent, but currently aren't.   I think that's going to change
when threading is introduced - we are just not there yet.   If the iterators
were independent updateFeature would work fine.

While these technical restrictions have not so beauty effects (one 
would not guess and has no idea that updateFeature is unreliable when 
used in an iterator loop) I think such problems will pop up at one end 
or another in the upcoming months, even more when multithreading is 
introduced, but not all dataProviders are ready to play nice and allow 
multiple iterators run in parallel. What do you think about introducing 
exceptions being thrown in such cases? It would be easier to become 
aware and also to react to such problems.
There can also be conditions, when the underlying data is edited while 
being iterated. I remember Java had something called fail-safe and 
fail-fast iterators, which might be worth revising for this case.

Concerning the current issue: If there is really no possibility to fix 
this without parallel iterators, at least the API should give a hint on 
these restrictions.

Well the feature itself knows what values it started with. Every update in
QgsFeature goes though the setAttribute, etc, call, you can just have an
internal dictionary that logs when one of values is changed using those
methods.


features are not tied to layers.  QgsVectorLayer (and it's edit buffer)

That's fine you can still do that on the layer.  I'll write a patch and
show you what I mean.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New QgsColorButton: features and poll
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR84SYtbuLqyVdzBrNa9-BjGoyLphLv+3DFEBO_aXt3+_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Matthias Kuhn and I reworked the QgsColorButton class and refactored it use
across the project. The following is an overview of its new features, a
poll on how to move forward, and a note about a Mac issue.

Features:
* Now one class based off of QPushButton, with two variants: one with an
icon when there is text (normal OS style), and one purely stylesheet-based
when there is no text (we refer to it as a color 'well'). Comparison of the
two variants [0].

* Code for using the button is much simpler, since the color chooser dialog
is now part of the QgsColorButton class.

* Whenever the color of the button has an alpha < 255 there is a
checkerboard background with the color overlaid, to indicate to the user
that the color has a transparency value. There is currently no graphical
indication that the button's color chooser dialog *offers* transparency
editing (I have figured out how to add this as a small badge, though).

* When the option is checked in Options, a live-updating color chooser
dialog is used and interim color choices update the button. This means any
signal/slot connection to the button's color change will also update,
creating a live preview. Try this with items in Composer (arrow, frame,
background) and when creating/editing a gradient. Some buttons shouldn't
have live updates, so there's a setter function to turn it off per button
(default for live updating is on).

[0] http://drive.dakotacarto.com/qgis/color-button_comparison.png

Poll:
Do you think there should be just color wells, just buttons with icons, or
a mix of both (current situation)? IMHO they should all be wells.

Mac 'triple-modal' issue:
On Mac there is an issue when using the native color dialog with what I
call 'triple-modal' dialogs: where one modal dialog opens another modal
dialog, which offers opening the modal color chooser. When this happens,
upon closing the color chooser, then the topmost modal dialog, the first
modal dialog becomes completely unresponsive (basically like there is still
another modal dialog open on top of it, but there isn't). It does not
happen when there is only one modal dialog and then the modal color chooser
on top.

This is a known Qt Mac issue with 4.8 and 5.0 (and maybe 4.7). I worked
around it by making all instances of base dialogs that present the issue
show as Qt::WindowModal, i.e. as sheet dialogs. This means there should be
no more Qt-style color choosers (only Mac native ones). Please let me know
if you notice any non-native color choosers popping up or any more
'triple-modal' issues.

Regards,

Larry

Not sure if any dataProviders currently work with multiple iterators.


> What do you think about introducing exceptions being thrown in such cases?

No much.  We currently don't use exceptions at all (ok, at some internal
places, but not in the API).   Qt doesn't use exceptions either.   I don't 
think it's worth to introduce exceptions just to workaround bugs.

Can that work without revisiting the feature in the database?

Ok.

Sure, you could do that.  But what for?  Just for updateFeature?  That method
is not even used anywhere.

And one instance of QgsFeature is often used as buffer, so the tracking would
have to be reset at some point (setValid? setFeatureId?).

IMHO one needs to be aware that currently multiple iterators are not working
for now.  Maybe Martin can comment on this - I guess he has plans continue to
work on this and the current state is for the time being.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] implement "Open/Save File" option into QGIS plugins
Message-ID: <1364065499120-5042520.post@n6.nabble.com>

Dear Developers! 

I'm writing a new plugin in which I'd like to implement some ways to enable
the user to open and save some contents. For that I need a file browser that
navigates through the file system. How can I make this happen? 

On the QGIS documentation I discovered something called
"QgsStyleV2ExportImportDialog Class". Is this what I need? If yes, how can I
implement it? I'm quite a novice to Python programming and to the QGIS API.
Any help is highly acknowledged. 

Best wishes 
               Gergely 

(PS. I know that there is a QGISFileBrowser plugin out there, but I don't
intend to use another plugin, just want a simple pop-up-file-browser
whenever the user hits the "Open" or "Save" buttons.)

As long as the code gets put into http://hub.qgis.org/projects it can 
easily be adopted by other developers.

Since the author has expressed willingness to let others adopt it, we 
will grant publish permissions on plugins.qgis.org to other developers 
who ask.

We've got QgsException (although admittedly not used much) and anyone 
coding python plugins will be used to using exceptions. Is the usage of 
QgsException discouraged?

I agree, that it should not be used to work around bugs. Rather to 
discover them.

I'm not sure, if all dataProviders will be ready to support multiple 
connections for 2.0 and in case one needs to be closed before reaching 
the end, giving appropriate information to the developer would be nice 
(can also be a return value or whatsoever). It would be nice to hear 
Martin's ideas about this as well.

I think so. For e.g. Postgres we probably don't need to care. Iterators 
coming from the database should be fail-safe anyway.
For other data sources, which do not provide safe iterators, handling 
changes that come from within QGIS are traceable, while for changes 
from outside appropriate signaling from the dataProvider would need to 
be guaranteed (if not yet implemented). But I may have missed something 
here and I think you know the dataProvider internals better than I do 
to estimate the current state of change-tracking possibilities, so 
please take this with a pinch of salt.

We should try to avoid exceptions wherever we can (see S. Meyers: 'More 
Effective C++', item 15, 
http://dl.irpdf.com/ebooks/Part15/www.irpdf.com%285702%29.pdf )

I strongly oppose eliminating the tools in fTools and gdaltools from
the main menu.
Your argument contemplates the picture from the point of view of the
developer only.
While having certain tools (i.e. R scripts, original sextante, OTB...)
within the
Sextante menu makes sense, from a user point of view basic tools such as those
in Vector and Raster are much more intuitive and easy to use as they
currently are in their
respective tabs. I actually have always wondered why fTools were
within Sextante also.
>From the user perspective the unnecessary redundancy is having them
within Sextante.
In short, I think that basic GIS functionality must be kept in the
tabs of the main menu.

Also, please note this question should be discussed in the users list also.

The main reason is that being part of SEXTANTE, they become more
powerful tools. They can be used in the modeler, in the batch
processing interface, in the console... Plus, history is kept for
those commands as well.

Cheers

p.s. A bit off-topic: the functionality of running R scripts from the
R scripts editor in SEXATNTE that you asked for, it is already
implemented in the dev version. If you have time to test it, your
opinion will be appreciated :-) Thanks!

 shared network folder

Hi.

While still trying to get qgis working from a network share (windows), I found this particular problem with openlayers plugin.

I have osgeow4 copied to a network share and edit the .bat files and qt.conf to point to this share. As far as I can tell everything is working, except for openlayers plugin...

The layer I choose loads ok and appears in the legend.

When I click to turn visibility on, qgis waits forever and has to be forced to close.

I tried debugging with winpdb and it seems the plugin gets stucked on line 107 in openlayers_layer.py:

      # wait for page to finish loading
      while not self.loaded:
        qApp.processEvents()

If I copy the plugin to the user's .qgis/python/plugins folder then it works fine.

I suspected the url created from the location of the plugin would be invalid but seems fine to me, and I can load it in chrome.

So I'm out of ideas... can anyone help?

Thanks,
Duarte

Yeah,

I already needed to use as batch when SEXTANTE wasn't that popular, so I
had to use grass instead.
So just the batch feature already justifies the implementation of FTools in
SEXTANTE, thank you guys, it's really a worthy tool.

Please fill out an issue ticket and provide more details, specifically

It's about color choosing, so there should be some space to get a 
feeling for the chosen color.

+1!

Hate to say it, but I'm with Augus on this one.

Particularly this is something that should be at least mentioned, preferably discussed in plain sight on the user list.

I would also add that since the other plugins are being encouraged to show up in appropriate menus (e.g. plugins that work on vectors in vector, plugins that work on database in database, etc.), it would be really unintuitive to me that fundamental vector *and* raster functions are in some menu called Sextante.

(I think a way around this, would be to have the menus provided by F-tools and GDALTools provided by Sextante and the menu items point to the right thing in Sextante - with of course a user useable interface. Not sure if that's viable. 
Agus, would that cover most of your comments too?)

-ramon.

Hi,

works fine here, updated to latest master.

what do you mean exactly by "too high", and how are you trying to
resize the histogram?  A screenshot would be handy.

Using click-and-drag you can zoom in, and zoom out using right button.

Thanks! I followed your advice and downloaded the tar ball from
http://initd.org/psycopg/tarballs/PSYCOPG-2-4/psycopg2-2.4.6.tar.gz,
unzipped it, then followed the instructions in the INSTALL file. Now
psycopg2 is installed under the OS X system Python, and I've since been able
to install QGIS plugins that require psycopg2.

OK, now I see: it was a problem with the scale; the size is meant as a multiplicator
of the cell value. Thanks for helping understand.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to embed a mapRenderer object into the QDialog?
Message-ID: <1364300844083-5042970.post@n6.nabble.com>

Dear Developers,

I'm writing a new plugin and I need some help.
In the plugin dialog there are multiple tabs, each contains fields that can
be filled with values. The output will be a PDF file, but before saving, I
would like to preview it into the dialog itself.

The last tab would be the one where I intend to put the preview. I think the
best way would be to use a mapRenderer(), where I can put everything
together. I already know how to save it into a PDF file, but my question is:
how can I preview it into the dialog box itself? How can I connect the
mapRenderer object to a dialog element?

I created a blank, white-backgrounded QScrollArea in the last tab, this is
where I would like to preview everything.

Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

Gergely

That's not actually what I meant - I have a ready-made package for OS X on my site (see sig below).

If you install from source blindly, I *think* it puts it in the system Python framework, not it's proper place /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages.

Hi.
I would expect that a fixed size in mm would indeed be fixed.
Perhaps better Size (mm multiplied by table content) or similar?
Thanks.

Hi all.
It is a pleasure to announce yet another generous sponsorship by the Austrian State
of Vorarlberg. They are not new to us, having sponsored QGIS already in 2011.
Welcome back, then, many thanks, and Happy QGISsing!

Hi all.
Tried on a different machine, current master; the plugin installs, is shown in grey,
but when QGIS is restarted, it does not appear.
Anyone confirms?
Thanks.

Hi all.
I'm still getting an error, a generico one this time: Error checking update
Does it work for others? The dir:

I haven't updated the webserver which hosts these files...

I am waiting on a fix to the plugin's git repository to add necessary
files there instead of an external server.

I got no response from an email here on this list (subject "problem
with plugin git repository on qgis.org") nor ticket I created
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7412

If someone with access to the git server can take 5 minutes to look at
the problem (git repository seems corrupt) I will update plugin to use
the repository.

Thanks,
Etienne

As well as the wiki pages of ideas from previous years, there are a few more ideas in the mailing list archives.  e.g. see

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Crashes on direct project load
Message-ID: <b2990c0db2afac8b88ee3e0864813ea0@carto.net>

 Hi,

 I have once again (or still) problems that QGIS is crashing when I 
 double click a .qgs File in Windows Explorer. These projects work fine 
 if I manually open them, but not if I open them directly on startup. I 
 guess double clicking on Windows is the same like the --project startup 
 option on the command line - so QGIS may crash on other OS as well when 
 using this command line option.

 Not all of my projects crash on startup, but most.

 Can others confirm that?

 Thank you,
 Andreas

Can anyone confirm that master version is now unable to correctly import
rasters stretch from 1.8 projects, showing the raster area in total gray?
To actual see the raster one needs to Strech histogram. I have tried using
TIF and SID RGB.

I did not have this problem before master update yesterday.

I'm testing using QGIS 1.8 (f440b60) and QGIS 1.9 (4189f45), in Windows 7
64bit, installed via OSGEO4W.

Hi all.
Apparently, when adding a layer with labels (new system) to a project in QGIS 1.8,
the layer is not shown. The same layer, without labels, is shown correctly. The same
with qgis-dev works well.
Could anyone confirm?
All the best.

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-uNNPJ56Qjyp4h2rahc2s2BccPG3oE+8AKpGUoN=oFuw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Do GUI updates, like migrating from horizontal tabs to vertical ones, that
do not really add a feature fall under the feature freeze, or can they be
done up until the GUI freeze?

Basically, I'm not quite sure what is modifiable, and to what extent,
between the feature and GUI freezes. Would appreciate some clarification.

Also, IMO, moving completely to SVG icons (where possible) during April
would also be a good GUI goal.

Thanks,

Larry

Hi dev's, I was notified some performance matters when dealing with
selections in attribute tables, by some users swithcing from arcgis to QGIS. 
Indexes of datasource seem to be ignored for SQL selection and search. This
leads to very slow selections when dealing with large datasets. 
Anyone confirms?  Is it really related to indexes or another bottleneck? 
Is there any possible improvement ? Are providers working on selections or
is that all dealing with cache? 

Thanks for your feedback ,

Hi Regis,

I discussed this with Matthias today, and it is apparently more related to refreshing the map canvas.

I also noticed very slow selection of features in attribute table for heavy project (regardless of the size of the layer).  But selecting the same layer, being the single one loaded, is very fast.

Matthias might give further thoughts on spatial indexing.

Hi,
I'm slightly confused. Could you clarify for me?

If you mean that your 1.8 project has an image with "no stretch" applied and that shows as a grey box in 1.9, then yes this is known and there's an issue reported. I understand it has to do with there being some significant changes to the way vectors are handled in the new version. Once you've stretched the image in 1.9, you should be able to put it back to "no stretch" and still see it. http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6809.

If you mean that your 1.8 project has an image which "already has a stretch" applied that shows as a grey box in 1.9 then I think that's new. 
I couldn't see this happening on a mac using 0005467 this morning, but will also check on a win7 box later.

-ramon.

Hi R?gis

The attribute table is not using any providers indexes. And when 
thinking about it a couple of questions arise like stable syntax across 
providers (different providers need different SQL which either needs to 
be translated from QgsExpressions or written by the user). Then a 
request needs to also include not-yet-committed features. These need to 
be evaluated as well. In case the user directly specifies sql for the 
provider and not a QgsExpression this will pose some more problems.

A new caching mechanism has been merged recently, but I don't expect 
any performance improvements yet. The new caching mechanism 
nevertheless supports plugable indexes, which I hope can help at least 
in part of these situations as soon as they are implemented.

The only possibility to make use of the data providers indexes that I 
know of right now (apart from making views et al) is to provide a 
subset string in the layer properties, but that's most likely not what 
you want.

Also, as mentioned by Denis Rouzaud, the rendering that takes when the 
selection changes place takes its bit of the performance. I remember, 
that somebody began a list of such unnecessarily triggered renders, but 
can't find it right now. I hope that in this area some work will be 
done as well.

Kind regards,
Matthias

 Hi,

 I noticed that the blend modes do not have any effect on labels.

 I was trying to see if one of the blend modes could help to label 
 orthophotos where you have the problem that the photo varies a lot in 
 brightness - there are dark and bright regions next to each other and 
 therefore neither a dark or bright text really works well. I wanted to 
 test if one of the blend modes could fix that problem.

 Any chance that the blend modes could also work on labels?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

 Ah right - it is already available - cool!

 So it can be found in the label settings dialogue. Just testing now.

 Hi,

 I tested the blend modes with white bold labels on top of a orthofoto 
 and unfortunately I could not find a blend mode that fitted my needs. I 
 was hoping to find a mode that would result in the exact negative of the 
 underlying graphics - meaning if the backgrund is dark, the label should 
 be bright and vice versa. The "Substract" and "Difference" modes are 
 close, but not satisfying in my case.

 Thanks anyway for making these blend modes available - they will be 
 useful in some cases!

Thanks guys,
I also raised on list issues with redrawing triggered by selection (but also bad performance for "identify" highlights for big objects).  On that point, preventing extra refreshes (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/2596) and heading towards multithreading to let renderer use another process can help. 
Anyway, we have an issue here, since datasets keep growing, and user won't always know about filter in layer properties. I didn't test if "select at id" option did change something. I didn't catch either what you describe with 'plugable' indexes. What could it be exactly?

Plugable indexes mean, you'll be able to have a cache on a layer (or 
maybe a data provider) later on, which can have several indexes on its 
features (even written in python hopefully) which can then answer a 
certain QgsFeatureRequest (if they're able to)

E.g. you can have an index on certain attributes and in case the index 
knows, that is has e.g. all the features with column1 = 5 ready (due to 
an earlier request), the backend will not be bothered. Or a spatial 
index could be integrated to speed up rendering (e.g. when panning 
around and drawing similar regions all the time).

Right now, the only index available is for feature ids.

Very nice, 
From a GUI and user point of view, how could those indexes be created? By hand in layer properties? From datasource indexes? 
My concern is that user don't have to manually tell to QGIS to create some indexes, when a data administrator already has done it in the database.

Are you working on that in relations project?  I was interested in call for funding made by andreas, but with a low priority. if this is a part of the work, I think I could justify funding from my administration. 

Please tell me, 
r?gis

Hi Paolo,

Sorry for not answering quick enough.
Have you discovered what was causing the issue ?

Sometimes, you have to force Qgis Server to reload the project file by
reloading apache ( service apache2 reload  in debian )

Cheers,
Michael

You are right, it's the second case you have described. The one also
described in

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6809

I'm glad that the tickets was reopened since, IMHO, an effort should be
done to make users transition from 1.8 to 2.0 as comfortable as possible.

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

It was probably a misconfigured projection.

For what it is worth, I frequently use several hundred MB shapefile
datasets, usually of forest inventory. The speed difference between ESRI
products and QGIS is quite apparent here, whether on spatial selections,
table selections, or whatever. I frequently turn off rendering while I play
in the table, but it is still slow compared to doing the same operations in
PostGIS or in Arc.

I'm happy to play with sample code fragments in python to run test cases on
my datasets, if that would help. I can work from shapefiles or PostGIS, as
needed.

If we need to build a test dataset to work with, then I can build something
we could release to the project.

This is a significant factor in how I use QGis, mainly driven by relatively
big data.

 Hi,

 First, let me thank for the guidelines - for the developer (Marco I 
 think?) and the one who sponsored it (no idea who paid for it).

 The behavior is a bit non-standard, though. When dragging from the 
 horizontal ruler one gets a vertical guideline and vice versa. I think 
 we should stick to the behaviour of other graphics software - like 
 Inkscape and Illustrator. From a horizontal rules you should get a 
 horizontal guideline and from a vertical ruler you should get a vertical 
 guideline.

 Or what are the reasons that you should get a vertical guideline from a 
 horizontal ruler?

 Thank you,
 Andreas

Message-ID: <00F9E64B563E7C45818C85C1B7FCC7262C84630E@SFMB03.exponent.com>

Hi all,

I am working on compiling QGIS for Windows under a MinGW environment - my program links with R so unfortunately I can't use the MSVC toolchain. I've successfully built the CMake targets core, ui, gui and providers on release-1_7_4 branch on Git, but had a couple problems with dependencies. I am using the Qt 4.8.4 binary distribution (qt-win-opensource-4.8.4-mingw.exe) and MinGW with gcc 4.4.0. Primary things to note are:

 - Make sure SETUPAPI_LIBRARY is set to MinGW/lib/libsetupapi.a - CMake may assign C:/WINDOWS/system32/setupapi.dll by default.
 - The GnuWin32 versions of Flex and Bison did not work. Fortunately, someone has finally ported over the latest versions to Win32 without dependencies on the MSYS DLLs! The latest version of the files located here worked well: http://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/

I've successfully linked against the libraries and I'm running a simple QgsMapCanvas-based demo application - thanks Tim Sutton for the excellent tutorials.

I would like to move to release-1.8 or trunk but the only thing preventing me from doing so is the dependency of core on libspatialindex. I can't get it to build with MinGW; has anyone successfully managed to do so and could you give me any tips? I can post the complete build log on request.

Thanks,
John

Hi Andi

 >First, let me thank for the guidelines - for the developer (Marco I 
think?) and the one who sponsored it >(no idea who paid for it).

The worldbank (InaSAFE project) funds the development.

It took me a while to find out how to create snap lines in Inkscape.
I don't have a strong opinion about that. The idea in QGIS is that if 
you want a snap line at x-coordinate 50, you click at the number 50 on 
the x-scale. In Inkscape, you have to go to the vertical ruler first, 
than drag from there  to x-coordinate 50 (feels slightly more 
complicated to me).

Regards,
Marco

Since doing this would add to the general fit and finish of the 2.0
final release, I would say +1 for allowing this work to be carried out
in the period up to the GUI freeze.

Basically we want to avoid adding large wads of new code or making any
sweeping changes to the code base so that the focus moves to
stabilising what we already have. So in a general sense commits post
feature freeze should be focussed on fixing bugs.

The gui freeze is intended to allow us to prepare press materials and
to allow documentors etc. to start preparing materials that will
coincide with the release.

+1 please go ahead with this if you have time. This is also something
we could defer to 2.1 if needed.

I cannot run the modeler in Sextante on a QGIS 1.8 with a Windows 7 - 64 bit.

It seems like the issue closed here http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7187,
stating: >>"Fixed in master"

Will this mean that on a W7 64bit one has to wait to the next version of
QGIS for the modeler to work?

Jakob,

more or less, yes :-(

The current development version of SEXTANTE includes changes to adapt
to the new vector API, which render it incompatible with 1.8.
Mantaining a version compatible with 1.8 means extra effort, and there
are no plans for that.

Hi Jakob,

For me modeler worked just fine with 1.0.8 version of Sextante in QGIS 1.8
on Windows.

Just download it from
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/sextante/version/1.0.8/ and replace the
version that was installed by Plugin Installer.

Best wishes,
Anita

While I agree that this current approach may seem more logical,
unfortunately almost every other design program behaves the way
Andreas described. It's rather jarring trying to get used to this new
behaviour. I'd suggest following the de-facto standard and flipping
the horizontal/vertical guides over.

Great feature BTW -- thanks for adding it!

I think the reason that Inkscape has it swapped around is so it can create
those snap points on the axis. For me I find the QGIS way more user
friendly and less clicks.   The way we are currently doing it lines up with
how programs like Word and Publisher do it so there really is no right way.
 My main thing would be make it easy for the user to know what to do
regardless of the method used.

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8oo_rVbar=2L+zP+nSoM+Rb7NZ1MXGXvBDkwDc8CmFgA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In an effort to bring a basic label background feature into 2.0 before for
the freeze, I figured out a good approach that makes adding label
backgrounds much easier (better late than never, I suppose) [0]. This means
that adding SVGs and drop shadows for label backgrounds is only an extra
couple of days of work.

Here's a preliminary gui setup [1] (not all may be implemented, but most
can easily be).

An example of generic rounded-corner rectangles (a la web mapping and many
road shields) with a bit of x/y offset to nicely center the text [2].

And, an example of the 'centering' of the background relative to the label
contents (background rotated 90 deg relative to text) [3], regardless of
label's offset placement (see pink-text label next to point feature). This
is a crucial feature for integrating many types of backgrounds.

Both examples also show one issue: while labels don't overlap due to
collision management, their backgrounds might overlap each other or
previously drawn label text. I believe this is fixable, though I don't know
how long it will take, off hand.

So... basically, I'm asking those who make decisions whether I can work for
another week on this feature, for inclusion in 2.0.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Learning the new Python API, problem with combine
Message-ID: <1364663017366-5043806.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

I am trying to learn the new Python API (calling dir(variable) to understand
the differences) and i have a problem with combine (union) geometries in the
Python console
With the old API, I use

    geoms = []
    for elem in layer.selectedFeatures():
        geom = elem.geometry() 
        geoms.append(geom) 

   union_geom = geom # starting with the last geometry in layer
   for geometry in geoms:
         union_geom = union_geom.combine(geometry)

For of a polyline layer, the result is a MultiLineString, for example

but this causes a  crash with the new Python API (Mac OS X master version)

No problem if I use Shapely (also based on geos, more direct with the union
function)

   from shapely.wkb import loads
   from shapely.geometry import *
   union_geom = LineString() # empty shapely LineString, it is a Polyline
layer here
   for elem in layer.selectedFeatures():
       wkb = loads(elem.geometry().asWkb()) # conversion to shapely geometry
       union_geom = union_geom.union(wkb)

Thanks

Hi,

I'd love to have these label backgrounds and drop shadows in QGIS 2.0.
Makes sense to me to include this work despite feature freeze since a
major effort was made already to improve labeling in QGIS 2.0.

so +1 from my side.

Thank you for your work, Larry.

Hi all,

I often regret the mouse wheel is wasted, as it could have different functions 
with Shift or Ctrl pressed. Here is a small patch to intercept the wheel if 
any keyboard modifier is pressed and pass it to QgsMapTool:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/491

Is there any objection to block the zooming when a modifier is pressed?

Hi,

In my opinion, the terminology concerning the use of "style" and "symbol"  
is currently confusing. The best example is the difference between Style -  
Save Style (which saves the symbol(?!) to the Style Manager) and Save  
Style ... (which creates a .qml or .sld).

I would therefore like to suggest to rename Style - Save Style to Symbol -  
Save Symbol.

What do you think?

Hi,

Ok, I'm going to do what I can in the next week, then put it up for review
for inclusion in 2.0.

Note that these changes to the labeling engine will also work well when
moving to styles and rule-based labeling. When that happens (I think a
definite main goal for 2.1) then pretty much most of the current labeling
gui and supporting gui logic will be tossed out (all except for small
widget groupings), in favor of the symbology-ng gui approach. So, while
some of the work I'm doing is redundant, it will be good to have the
background features in use and to garner user feedback. Hard telling how
long it will be until 2.1.  :^)

Also, thanks to Tim for starting this with his commits a while back for
road shields [0], which I used for reference.

Hey Anita,

I have changed that now. It's now called Save in Symbol Library.  I'll
review all the strings for that over the next few weeks.

I think the Save Style... that creates the qml is wrong too as it saves all
the layer properties and so I think it should be renamed to Save Properties
with the added option of only saving the Style and Label information.

Regards,

Btw. I always find the "Save As Default" button confusing for newbies...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS globe and mapserver export plugin
Message-ID: <CACfnYnRwie6hZY1HvutwFTY668pC+aOCf883okqC2S09ax6tPg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I was wondering what are the plans for the QGIS globe and the
Mapserver export plugin.

The Globe does not seems to work (yet):

on Windows it give "bad allocation" and on linux it seg faults qgis
easily when playing with configurations.

The Mapserver export plugin does support just the old symbology, and
as the old symbology will be removed then should make sense also
remove the plugin (that anyway can be replaced by the "RT Mapserver
exporter" one).

Cheers

Does UMN Mapserver support SLD? If it does, do we even need a dedicated  
export plugin?

Best wishes,

Thanks for taking the initiative! I'll keep checking nightly and report if  
I notice any other such problems.

+1 from me.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] feature freeze exception
Message-ID: <201304010044.18047.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

Hi Tim, hi All, 

Last time Martin switched the plugin manager to only use metadata.txt instead 
of __init__.py , and now I'm updating installer to use the same. 

Old plugins without metadata.txt are not displayed in the manager, however 
they are available in installer (because it doesn't know about the lack of 
metadata.txt unless the plugin is installed), so it's important to mark them 
as invalid after install to explain to the user their state.

Because 'displaying plugins without metadata as invalid' can be recognized as 
a new feature and I won't manage to implement it in 15 minutes, I'd like to 
ask for freeze exception for this small feature. I believe it would be a huge 
regression if plugins without metadata.txt disapeared with no sign.

Hey Borys,

I would see this more as a bug fix then a new feature.

Yes same here, Borys this would fall under consistency and clean up
leading up to the release.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.0 Milestone: Feature freeze & updated
	release timetable
Message-ID: <CALCNqkYfZPH0bicBYb5XuAzOEFftfSSJ=OKpna-UWAXqSWKa3w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

Please note that we are now in Feature Freeze for QGIS 2.0. This means
that no new major functionality (typically annotated with [FEATURE] in
a commit message) should be added to master.

Exceptions to this are the GUI cleanup work and the shield label work
being carried out by Larry. If anyone else feels there should be
further exceptions made, they should be discussed here on the list
*before* pushing them to master.

Now is the time to clean up the code base, remove inconsistencies,
make all the tests pass, make the GUI neat and tidy and generally get
things ready for general consumption.

Today I will also commit changes that move the home directory from
~/.qgis to ~/.qgis2 so that we can properly support deployments where
1.8 and 2.0 are used side by side. Also settings for QGIS 2.0 will be
independently store from the QGIS 1.x settings (e.g. under unix like
OS's they will now go into ~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS2.conf).

Please note that I have updated the release timetable as per below:

1 April 2013 - Feature freeze - no new features in master
15 April 2013 - API Freeze - no changes to API except where it is in
direct response to broken functionality.
30 April - GUI Freeze and String freeze - no changes to ui or strings
except where required for critical bug fixes. Call for translations.
1 June 2013 - Branch 2.0, code freeze (except for packaging related
changes), call for packaging
7 June 2013 - Public release of 2.0

The updated timetable gives a little more time to sort out user
interface issues and improve UI strings before the release.

Regards

Tim
