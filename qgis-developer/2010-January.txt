Subject: [Qgis-developer] Renderer improvements masked for mac
Message-ID: <9BA3B3F5-B912-42E2-99BE-CEF9BE2D2E23@GMAIL.COM>

Marco,

In trying to test the polygon dashed line issue, I removed the mask of the following lines from qgsoption.cpp that I added a few days ago on my source file. The lines are:

 #ifdef Q_WS_MAC //MH: disable incremental update on Mac for now to avoid problems with resizing
  groupBox_5->setEnabled( false );
 #endif //Q_WS_MAC

I am not clear why the above is set for Mac's. I'm not sure what the resizing issue is. I see no ill effects when I mask these lines, and the performance gains are much too great to not have this feature available. This is truly makes qgis a much more enjoyable program for production work, in my opinion.

Can we take this out unless there is a specific issue that can be pointed out and tested?

BTW, this had no effect on the polygon boundary. I'm in the dark on why the problem was present, but now is gone. Strange...

Regards,
John

Hi John

The incremental update was disabled because of update problems when resizing 
the main window of QGIS on Mac. I tested it on a Mac at university and as far 
as I remember, there was a difference with painting events coming from Qt that 
caused the problems.

Could you test if this still is true? For testing, take out the ifdefs in 
qgsoptions.cpp and also in qgsvectorlayer.cpp. Then take a large vector layer 
that is updated several times. Start drawing and while it draws, resize the 
QGIS window several times. Then do the same also with WMS layers.

If there is no problem with it any more, I will be happy to remove the ifdefs, 
as I like the incremental render updates very much too.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <4B40876A.5020600@duif.net>

Hi List,

I got a question from some fieldworkers to be able to do (point/area) 
digitizing in the field using qgis and qps on a netbook with touchscreen.
I read tim's blog post:
http://linfiniti.com/2009/11/creating-dynamic-forms-a-new-feature-headed-for-qgis-1-4/

I need a way to hook my own dialog into the edittool, but only using the 
ui-file is not enough, because I need to fill/layout the dialog with 
dropdowns according to a certain context.

Any ideas, pointers or lines of code to be able to use a truly dynamic 
scriptable form?

For example: where do I hook a python plugin into the edittool(s)?

Did other people already do a project like this?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <f0f9bf091001030918p1a7d10a9xd846702795e427dd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
Is it possible to reset a plugin (reloading it's modules) from inside qgis?
It's the only feature necessary for a smooth development since eclipse's
pydev can debug plugins inside qgis.
What happens is that I debug the code but I have to reopen qgis and every
data I was working on for qgis to load the new plugin version and test
again.
Is it possible to reload it manually?

Unfortunately it isn't possible yet :( I know it's a painful gap, but it's 
still not resolved issue yet.

Hi Richard,

In the QGIS 1.4 or the development builds there is the possibility to
specify an onload python script. This script is called whenever the
dialogue is opened.

I can send you an example tomorrow and more info from my workplace. I
don't have it at home. J?rgen Fischer implemented this if you have more
in-depth questions.

Best,
Andreas

Message-ID: <baea77b11001031607g52d20181i30eff6e0b58732db@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I've a problem when I use the QFileDialog with filters
in GdalTools-plugin (python).

If I use QFileDialog static methods, passing in filters args
a filter with a very long name, the dialog becomes larger
then the screen width becouse it adjusts automatically its
size.
Instead, if I create a QFileDialog instance and after I
set the filters, it works fine (by the way, the dialog created
is also different from the previous one and this is strange!).

Becouse I use the QFileDialog in every tool within the
plugin, I prefere to use the static methods to avoid to write
4 function to create the dialog and set filters (to replace
openFile, openFiles, openDir, saveFile).
There is another solution to set the dialog dimensions to
the normal ones when I use the QFileDialog static methods?

Thank in advance.

Apparently I only tested the raster-related portion of the fix; I was not aware of the code in qgsvectorlayer.cpp. Removing that code does create some problems with qt-4.5.3. I'm going to download and try qt-4.6.0 and will report back on that if it works -- ok, tested that and it does not work any differently with 4.6.0.

I suggest that we remove the mask in qgsoptions.cpp because it brings the raster speedups and there is no apparent cost to other functions. The raster caching makes a huge difference for me. I cannot comment on the quality of the vector improvements as I have not really tested it yet.

Cheers,
John

Hi Richard,

Here is more info.

To associate the start-script with the layer do the following:
Layer Properties --> General --> Init function

The python script can reside either in the project directory, side by side
with the .qgs project file, or in the python plugin directory.

In my case the init functions are "haltung.featureFormInit" and
"normschacht.featureFormInit". It receives the following parameters:
dialog,layerid,featureid

I attached you two sample scripts. You can't do much with it without the
database, but you see the structure of the script. Starting from the
featureFormInit method or function you can do pretty much everything you
can do with python scripting.

Hope this helps,
Andreas

Is there anyone who could just purge the plugin from the repo, and I could

Hi Andreas,
I'm very much interested in it. Can you sent it to me?

Indeed that updateSymbolAttributes() method was missing in the python
bindings. I've added it in now in trunk (r12672). Also there was
missing automatic conversion from QgsRenderer to the subclasses, e.g.
QgsSingleSymbolRenderer (fixed in the same commit). So from now you
can use the "right" approach too but I would recommend you to keep
your workaround for compatibility with older releases.

That's because when calling single symbol renderer's addSymbol()
method, the updateSymbolAttributes() method is called in it.

	integration
Message-ID: <b2de29ac1001060200y3ecf3049nd45e10ac1b7334b8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Marco and I have been working on C++ based GPS integration into QGIS
core. The work has been sponsored by Navigo (http://www.gonavigo.ca/).

There are two parts:

- a gps background process that communicates with a GPS and extracts
nmea strings and then propogates them to any listing classes
- a user interface, implemented as a dock panel that shows position,
signal strength bar chart, satellite polar chart, options

Similarly to Martin's gps project, the gps ui can be used to capture
features (and attributes using the normal attribute dialog mechanism).
The ui part uses Qwt for the charting functions. I would like to
propose that we add Qwt5 as a soft dependency. If it is not present,
the GPS ui parts will not be built (the background process part will
still be built. Could you please let us know if you are happy for the
inclusion of this soft dependency - and the GPS code itself?

If on, the other hand, people are inclined to make Qwt a hard
dependency, that would be good to because I can then replace the
raster props dialog histogram with a better charting implementation.

Regards

Tim

+1 for choosing one library for all graphs. For me Qwt5 is ok and PyQwt5 is 
used already in some python plugins.

+1 from my end. I've built my own qwt5 already on OS X, so it's not a problem. Making it a hard requirement seems best to unify graphing operations. William might have additional thoughts for the xcode project.

Hi

Just one thing to bear in mind: only C++ plugins would benefit - python plugins would still need python-qwt5-qt4.

I have it as a customization for the bundling step, but it's easily added to the Xcode project (as an optional bundling step).  My current binaries do bundle it.

Sure, but it at least gives the possibility to achieve look & feel unified with 
the core. And probably will lead to include pyqwt5 to some of the bundles.

0 for me.

Either use it as a hard dependency or don't use it at all. Personally
I don't have any experience with Qwt and it's capabilities. I guess it
doesn't have as many features as e.g. python's matplotlib, anyway it
might be a good candidate for drawing graphs also in future.

Hi all

The non-gui part is in src/core/gps now. The code is experimental and I hope 
to receive a lot of improvements :-)

There is a base class QgsGPSConnection, subclassed by QgsNMEA connection. So 
it would also be possible to add support for non-NMEA connections by creating 
new subclasses. QgsGPSConnection emits a signal (stateChanged) that contains 
the last received data.
To query the gps connection in the background, there is the class  
QgsGPSTrackerThread.

The code uses QExtSerial to access the serial port platform independently. 
Currently, there is no support for USB devices. This could be implemented as a 
new subclass of QIODevice.

Tim and I tested it successfully with our Garmin eTrex H devices, using an 
usb-serial adapter cable.  

To parse the individual nmea sentences, code from libnmea is used. The code is 
directly included in the qgis sources, so no other hard requirement ;-) . From 
what I see, it handles only the most important sentences, so there is also 
space for further extensions here.

Looking forward for your comments, suggestions, improvements.

Regards,
Marco

 I think with Qwt you get graph and control widgets that integrate
into the Qt framework, so you can build them into Qt dialogs with
designer and interact with them via signals in the usual Qt way.

 matplotlib is clearly a superior 2d plotting library though :)

Hi all,

today I've added support for complete unloading and reloading of
python plugins (r12690). So from now developers creating python
plugins won't have to restart every time they do some changes.
Instead, in qgis python console they can type:
qgis.utils.reloadPlugin('myplugin')

... and the plugin gets removed completely and started again (using
fresh source files).

It would be good to have this functionality available somewhere in the
GUI. Any hints where it should go? Or there could be a simple plugin
for developers that would trigger the reload... It would be even
possible to monitor changes in plugins source code periodically and
ask user to reload the modified plugins if any changes are detected,
check this site for insipiration:
http://www.indelible.org/ink/python-reloading/

Bye
Martin

Well done Martin! this is for sure a long-time awaited functionality.

IMHO, a good place can be in Plugins menu, after Manage Plugins:
something like

Reload  >  All plugins / the list of all loaded plugins so that one can
pick up just one

the automagic detection of updates can be fine too. But I'd prefer the
manual way.

my 2c, and thanks again,

Anne

Hooray for this improvement!
As a newbie trying to build a plugin (and making endless mistakes) I
was tired of restarting qgis all the time.
Thanks a lot

I think that it would be a good idea to have this functionality in the
GUI incorporated as a plugin for python developpers. This way it would
be cleaner for normal users, who probably don't have the need to
reload plugins, so they can do without one more button or menu in the
GUI. This plugin could also be enhanced in the future, if the need
arises, to incorporate other utilities to speed up dev'ing.

It would also be nice if the plugin manager used this new this
feature, this way when a plugin gets updated it won't be necessary to
restart Qgis.

I think the list of all plugins wouldn't be too handy:
1. It could be too long
2. it requires entering an additional menu level.
3. it's hard to set a keyboard shortcut

So I prefer one simple menu item, either 'reload all loaded plugins' (what 
hopefully won't be too slowly) or configurable for one plugin you're just 
working on. The former is defininety simpler ;)

Oh and it's also a good solution, easier to configure.

Outstanding!

Testing my Python plugin currently requires opening a project file with 
270 layers linked to a PostGIS database with somewhere between 250k and 
500k elements.  This will speed things up considerably.

Just to be clear, you're talking about something a plugin developer 
could do optionally, not something that would be built in by default, right?

Thank you very much for implementing this.

Hi all

The gui component is now also in trunk as of r12697. Please note that
it seems to want a recent version of Qwt (tested with qwt-5.2.1). If
you are on ubuntu 9,10 you should find everything you need in apt.

Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E06462502F7@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

I'm wanting a renderer for vector field data.  In my case this is earth deformation data - surface displacements - but it could as easily be hydrological flow, or other such data.

Ideally this will display an arrow of length and orientation based on data values (x,y or length,orientation) at points, but with some independent overall scaling to allow all the vectors in a layer to be rescaled without recalculating the data.  To be perfect (!) it would also take account of the projection convergence when using on the fly projections (though I could live without that, at least initially!)

Do you know of a plug-in that does that?

If not, is it possible to build a renderer like this with a python plug-in?

And if it is possible, can you point me to any examples of a python renderer plug in that I could build from (I haven't programmed python or the Qgis/Qt API before, so examples would be really helpful!!)

Thanks
Chris

 Here's a link to a python renderer I wrote that colours features
according to the ratio of two attributes:

http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Software/ratioRenderer/

 this was a couple of years ago so expect to have to tweak it for
modern qgis versions.

 hope that helps. You'll need to write a renderFeature function that
draws your arrows.

Hi.
This should be updated: who can do it?
Can someone document how to add a plugin to standard repos? This is not the first
time people waste time setting up their own repo, just because they ignore how to add
their plugin to the standard repo.
All the best, and thanks a lot.

He Martin,

great!! Confirmed working here on ubuntu 9.4

I think this will give me at least one day more to 'live' this year ;-)

for me, the python-console-option is actually enough, I'm developing one
plugin at a time anyway, and am already very, very happy with this option.

But he, if you're in the mood don't let me stop you ...

Like Borys I would say: keep the gui simple. And maybe do not put it in
the normal menu's. It's only for developers isn't it? Then put it in the
python console? Most 'Normal users' would not be interested in this
feature I think.

My idea for the gui:
In the console: one button "reload plugin(s)" and a dropdown with all
plugins loaded and one item 'All'.

And again: THANKS Martin for this work!

The gui is working now. Thanks for your work on that today. Unfortunately, no ports are being picked up on OS X. This has always been a problem with the gps plugin, so there is a mutual issue for your new feature and that plugin.

There must be some qt code that works on all platforms because other qt-based projects reportedly work on multiple platforms, including OS X. Perhaps a solution can be found from this one:

Hi Tim,

Well, the gebabbel program does not offer any insights. It does not poll for gps devices. Perhaps looking into the updated qextserialport project code? 

http://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/

It looks like things have changed considerably from the 1.0.0 code in qgis.

Hi Chris

yes this is all possible with new symbology (introduced in QGIS v1.4 -
will be announced shorly). There are python bindings so you shouldn't
have a problem to create such renderer in python. Unfortunately so far
there are no examples in python, for some code samples you might want
to look at c++ code in src/core/symbology-ng - there are several
renderer implementations and symbol layer types.

For an introduction check this wiki page:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Symbology-NG

If you'll need any further assistance, don't hesitate to write to the
mailing list, I'll try to give you some further guidance.

My idea was to add this functionality as a plugin for python
developers - average users probably wouldn't understand the
functionality nor use it. And I'm wondering whether it makes sense to
reload all plugins. Instead I would prefer to select a plugin and have
an action to reload it (with configurable shortcut).

Later such plugin could include more functionality that would make
plugin developer's work easier - just think of an integrated debugger
that would enable to walk through plugin's variables at any time or
allow inspection of the problem on an exception :-)

Anyone interested to implement such a plugin? ;-)

giving a look to the trac for feature requests, and making a quick

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Support for tiled layers
Message-ID: <4B4929D0.6050702@mapgears.com>

Hi Devs,

Has any thoughts ever been put into supporting the concept of tiled 
layers (for images or vectors), the equivalent of MapServer's TILEINDEX 
concept (http://mapserver.org/optimization/tileindex.html), or Seamless 
tables in the MapInfo world?

We have a client who has a need for this, they have hundreds of images 
that they need to load all at once, and to which they need to apply a 
common classification or color correction. You can imagine that applying 
the settings on each image one by one through the GUI is not very 
practical. If we had this concept of a tiled layer, we could just point 
QGIS to the tile index file, and then applying the settings once to the 
tiled layer would apply them to all the images that it refers to.

Or is there another way to do this through the GUI without scripting? I 
admit I am not a QGIS guru and may have missed this option, but I 
thought I would ask here to get your thoughts.

Thanks

Daniel

P.S. I will be away from my email next week, but I will check my mail 
and respond as soon as I'm back.

Hi there Daniel,

Would just running gdalbuildvrt on the raster sets and then loading that
into QGIS get you what you need?  QGIS can consume VRT's just fine and I
have had great luck emulating the tileindex functionality that way.

Also, you can build vrt rasters from within QGIS, via the Raster Tools (AKA
GdalTools) plugin: https://trac.faunalia.it/GdalTools-plugin/
All the best.

Hi all,

good news everyone: there's a new python console in trunk (r12727).
Please test and leave feedback what you think about it.

It's much simpler, no buttons, just a big text edit where you both
enter commands and see the results (some code used from Carson's
manageR plugin). Use up/down keys to traverse commands history.

Great news! Only problem I see is fixed width font. If you want do make an 
indentation block, it's moved left, as the '...' prompt if shorter than 
regular '>>>'. It makes me a bit confused ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] help with python code - works for postgis,
	but not for shapefiles
Message-ID: <c422d6cd1001101030l29d6765p7880fb87051abe50@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list
I am stuck writing a part of my plugin's code. It is working fine with
postgis layers, but for some reason it doesn't work with shapefiles
I think I've managed to nail it down to the part of the code that is
not working[1].
I want this code snippet to do the following:
    - iterate over every feature of the layer
    - calculate the value of a variable called "api"
        - this variable is calculated by calling some other code and
depends on the input that the function gets from the user (hence the
call to eval in there)
    - store the "api" variable in the apiField attribute field of the layer

When the layer is a postgis layer the code works fine. When it is a
shapefile the while cycle only seems to run once, and so the "api"
variable is calculated only for the first feature. No errors are being
thrown, so I am really lost as to the cause.

If anyone can try to have a look at it and point me to what might be
the issue I'd be very thankful.
If you need to look at more of the code I've set up a project in
launchpad[2] for my plugin where you can browse the source. Look for
the fisheyefilterplugin.py file. The plugin is already functional for
the postgres provider, but I was hoping to extend it to work OGR and
spatialite providers if I could get this error fixed.

Thanks in advance

[1] - Python code follows:

def calculate_api_field(self, apiField, commands, totalCommandsToCalc):
    print "calculate_api_field method called"
    attrIndexes = self.provider.attributeIndexes()
    allFeatures = self.provider.select(attrIndexes)
    self.layer.startEditing()
    feat = QgsFeature()
    while self.provider.nextFeature(feat):
        featureId = feat.id()
        api = 0
        for command in commands.keys():
            attrName = commands[command][0]
            attrIndex = self.provider.fieldNameIndex(attrName)
            functions = apifunctions.ApiFunctions(feat,
commands[command][1:], self.provider, attrIndex)
            commandResult = eval("functions.%s()" % (command))
            if command in ("less_than", "less_than_or", "more_than",\
                           "more_than_or", "equal", "not_equal")\
                           and commandResult == 0:
                api = 0.0
                break
            api +=  commandResult
        api /= totalCommandsToCalc
        print "API:", api
        self.layer.changeAttributeValue(featureId, apiField, api)
    print "calculate_api_field method exiting"
    return self.layer.commitChanges()

William,

It appears that the contextual help is not working in the Snow Leopard packages. A test on Leopard hardware from another user confirmed it worked on that platform. When you get a chance, you might want to update those two packages (all-in-one and standard).

Message-ID: <b2de29ac1001101430o1203b0a6o14f660996f5415f5@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Users & Developers

We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 1.4.0 'Enceladus',
the next in our development release series.

Our 'development' release series are provided to offer users a chance
to try out new features as they make their way into the code base. We
will not support these releases over a long term and they are aimed at
people who don't mind if the user interface changes from release to
release.  We are dropping the term 'unstable' in favour of
'development' to label our non-long term support releases since the
'unstable' moniker creates the incorrect impression that these
releases are more crash prone. In reality the developer releases
contain many bug fixes that should improve stability over previous
releases.

Binary and source code packages are available at:

http://download.qgis.org

A visual changelog for the release is available here:

http://blog.qgis.org/node/142

Along with the release of QGIS 1.4.0, the QGIS Community Team is hard
at work on an updated QGIS Users' Guide version 1.4. The guide will be
available in the near future - we will post announcements when it is
available.

QGIS is a completely volunteer driven project, and is the work of a
dedicated team of developers, documenters and supporters. We extend
our thanks and gratitude for the many, many hours people have
contributed to make this release happen.

If you would like to make a donation or sponsor our project, please
visit http://www.qgis.org/en/sponsorship.html . QGIS is Free software
and you are under no obligation to do so.

Happy QGIS'ing!

Hmm, I see in Activity Monitor that Qgis and qgis_help are loading the installed Qt frameworks alongside the bundled Qt frameworks.  This could cause odd behavior, in general.  Are there any crashlogs for Qgis (qgis_help will show as "Qgis")?

I'll poke thru all the binary stuff to see if something was missed in the Qt paths.

I think I see the problem - PyQt loads the QtWebkit framework (which I included for convenience for plugins), and I see that QtWebkit needs phonon and QtDBus, which I didn't bundle (oops).  On your system, it may be trying to load your Qt 4.6 (you were testing that out, I believe?) which is different than the bundled Qt 4.5.  Is python loading for you?

Another side-effect of r12622, because qgis_help runs thinking it's Qgis, it's loading Python stuff?  

I'll bundle the extra needed frameworks and get an update out soon.

Hi Arthur

Can you reply via the lists rather - the Ubuntu packagers can then try to help.

I believe this error is because you need to add the grass libs dir to /etc/ld.so.conf and then run sudo ldconfig.

Is pyqgis broken? Can someone fix it, or otherwise help stafan to upload his plugin?
I think this is a very useful tool, under active developmente, and should not be missed.
All the best.

Hi

I updated the plugin:

5. Rectangular Points: select a baseline and start entering abscissa and
ordinate values.

Since I'm not able to update the plugin in the qgis user contributed
repo, you can download the plugin here:

Lutfi,

Welcome to plugins QGIS!

Last year i started building python plugins to QGIS.

I show some steps to create python plugins for QGIS, know each step 
isolated!

1) API QT4 - See diagrams of classes
http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/
2) Binding QT4 for python - Practice the  API Qt4
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/html/classes.html
Use of tools QT (Ex.: Desginer for make GUI)
3)  API QGIS - See diagrams of classes
http://doc.qgis.org/
4) Use console python of Qgis - Practice the API QGIS
*You can write files with classes and functions in plugin directory  and 
import by console.

After these steps you can read about plugins:
1) Quantum GIS Blog:
http://blog.qgis.org/taxonomy/term/2
2) Download plugins and read sources, choice the most simple!
3) Get your best idea and go to make your plugin!

Good luck

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python based Renderer (V2)  for vector field data
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E064640E398@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

I trying to develop a renderer as a python plugin, using the symbology-ng rendering interface.  The renderer is to plot a vector field data from a vectory layer as arrows at each point, where the size and orientation of the arrow is calculated from attributes of the point.

This is going well up to the point of being able to create the renderer from the python console, and render data.  I have one issue which is that I wanted to use one of the existing symbol layers (QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayerV2) but I think that this is not defined in the python interface?  However this is easy to work around for the moment.

However now that I have a working renderer I am wanting to have it integrated into the application.  To do this I think I need to install the renderer into the registry, and then create a widget to select and configure it.

I don't think  I can do this using python.  Just trying to do the first bit - install the renderer into the interface - I think that the python interface doesn't provide the necessary functionality?  I don't have the QgsRendererV2Metadata class, or the QgsRendererV2Registry

Perhaps I am completely on the wrong track, and I should be doing this some other way?

Any suggestions as to how to proceed from here?

This would be required for any C library linked by Qgis. This is out of discussion.
Qgis has to manage correctly C libraries by providing wrappers to raise execeptions
when C calls fail, else people will start asking that libc too supports
exceptions, soon or later...

That's right, the default symbol layer classes are not yet available in PyQGIS.

Ah... you're right. I'm looking at the bindings right now and I see
neither renderer nor symbol layer registry wrapped properly :-/

You're on the right track.

You can still work with the renderer even if it's not registered, just
there will be some annoyances - loading of project files with this
renderer or inability to change its properties in vector layer
properties dialog.

> Any suggestions as to how to proceed from here?

I'm going to fix the bindings in svn trunk and will update the
symbology-ng page with information on how to proceed with custom
renderers and symbol layer types.

Message-ID: <f2b361eb1001140811v397819b6l203ac91fbcdd9640@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,
A little bit offtopic, but I promise I'll mention QGIS as well :-).
I'm starting out a relatively small GIS project (read: no money involved,
for at least next 6 months :-)). I've got the desktop part covered, GIS
applications are nothing new to me (10+ years of experience), but we are
interested in a web component as well.
This web GIS component would be more for show than for real hevy-load
usage... Layer on/off and some attribute searching capability are a must, of
course...
What I have now is QGIS, mainly shapefiles (still waiting for conversion to
PostGIS...) created from DXF and TIFFs.
I looked into Mapserver and Geoserver, and I'm kind of inclined to use
Mapserver because of an existing GQIS plugin. But there are several
"frameworks" I came accross googling: Mapfish, Geoext, worldKit, not to
mention stuff that seems not to be developed any more, like Fusion,
Chameleon, ka-Map!, etc, etc

What are you using? Any recommendations, caveats? If I had time I would test
a couple and share the results, but - time is money, and no money is
involved (for now) in this project :(.


Best regards,

I asked this question on the Qgis-community mailing list but was

Are you planning on supporting Python 3 in Qgis 2 ?
Since I saterted to "learn" Python recently, it would be nice to 
concentrate on just one python version.

Hi Markus,

Sorry if I don't answer your question but.... my 2 cents is that you should 
know python 2 too. I don't think the difference between python 2 and 3 is 
"huge". I think there are only a few "incompatible changes" to do. And the 
main reason is that a lot of libraries wont migrate to python3 yet because 
python2 is still largely used.

Personally, I haven't even started thinking about the migration yet. As we 
have a huge number of plugins written in Python 2.x, the only reasonable 
moments for the migration are qgis 2.0 or 3.0. I don't know when the 2.0 will 
arrive. If this Summer, it rather won't be the time for switching yet. If this 
Winter - well, hard to foretell...

Anyway, for the next few months Python 2.x doesn't seem endangered, so I would 
advise to start with it. The changes won't be drastic :)

Hi,

it seems that from PyQt4 there's support for Python 3, so with some
tweaks it will be probably possible to run also QGIS 1.x with it. I
think after adding support for Python 3, QGIS will support compilation
with either python 2.x and 3.x. Once python 2.x will be considered
legacy, we'll continue to support only python 3.x.

It has been already said, the changes between v2 and v3 are not that
great, so I would recommend to start learning python v2 as it will be
around for several more years.

Hi Zoran,

For the client part I would recommend any of (or a combination of) 
OpenLayers/GeoExt/MapFish. All three are related.

For the Server either UMN Mapserver or Geoserver is fine. There is also 
a QGIS mapserver developed by Marco Hugentobler. Marco will work on it 
later this year so you can re-use .qgs project files for web projects 
(without having to write other config files). Meanwhile you can already 
use QGIS  mapserver, but you have to write an SLD. It will serve the 
data as WMS. UMN and Geoserver are certainly more tested and perhaps 
faster than the current QGIS mapserver.

Marco can tell you more about QGIS mapserver.

Hi all.
I checked the room today:
http://int.faunalia.it/~paolo/15012010311.jpg
Looks very nice, the natural park around is quite nice; I got informal confirmation
of the availability from the Park president, in the next few days we'll get formal
confirmation. Even in the worst case (I think this is *very* unlikely), I have a
backup solution, so you can start booking your tickets.
Is someone coming, or I'll be alone?
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/3._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Pisa_2010#Participation :)
There is internet connection (nothing exciting: pinging google gives around 200 ms,
but during the weekend it should be better, as the neighbouring offices will be
empty); ssh is open.
We'll have to pay around 100 EUR for the final cleanup, but I think this is fair enough.
Please let me know if you have any question.
All the best.

Thanks Andreas,

This QGIS mapserver sounds promising, I'll look into this. As I said speed
is not my primary concern now, but simplicity and "looks"...

Anyone here with working experience with Fusion? They seem to be much more
concentrated on MapGuide, not Mapserver? But that's a question for some
other mailing list...

I'm still interested in hearing from anyone willing to share his/her
experience... (QGIS + Mapserver...).


BR,

I've fixed the problems in svn trunk and now everything's ready. I've
also updated the symbology-ng wiki page [1] with brief instructions
and sample code how to create custom symbol layers and/or renderers.

Hi Zoran, maybe you can find useful a basic comparison between web map
clients.

So visit:
http://geotux.tuxfamily.org/index.php?option=com_myblog&task=view&id=239&Itemid=59&lang=en

The comparison is originally in spanish. The english translation is finished
( but under revision :) ).

This problem is solved by upgrading sip. Version 4.7.9 does not work.
Upgrading to 4.10 solves the problem. The build docs need updating if
the minimum sip version has changed.

Updated minimal SIP version in installation guide to 4.8 (which might
work too). Works with 4.9 here.

I tried the newest sip 4.10 and PyQt 4.7 last night. PyQt 4.7 seemed to be disliked by cmake, which dropped python support. Perhaps someone else is willing to see if this new combo works for them?

Thanks,

Hi Marco,

I am quite interested in the progress you are making with the composer. I tested the newly added svgfill a moment ago on my OS X system. Unfortunately, despite changing the outline color to yellow and providing an svg symbol for the fill, the layer remains unfilled and with a black outline. I tested this on my ubuntu vm also, and no luck there either. I am guessing this is a work in progress and I may be jumping the gun. Otherwise, I must be doing something incorrectly or it is broken.

Cheers,
John

It works on Ubuntu. I can't get QGIS to compile on my mac using cmake
or xcode since I upgraded to Snow Leopard...

Message-ID: <CCEBFA99-B5D7-43F6-8258-8C765262ED5E@kyngchaos.com>

The xcode project is updated to handle the new python module compilation (thanks Martin!).  It compiles faster - from the new compilation process from Martin, and now the sources are compiled by Xcode instead of by the old python script so they can take advantage of Xcode's multithreading.

A new addition to the Xcode configuration - PYQT_SIP_DIR and PYQT_SIP_FLAGS.  These are set by default to SIP+PyQt (Carbon) installed for the system Python as described in the INSTALL doc.  They may need to be adjusted (manually) for other configurations.

Note that the minimum SIP/PyQt version is affected by the Qt version used.  ie to use the new Qt 4.6 (fuly) you need at least SIP 4.10 and PyQt 4.7.


Gary - what compile problems are you having on Snow?  I'm using Qt 4.5 Carbon right now, but the Xcode project should work with 4.6 (John's tested that a bit).  I haven't tried Qt Cocoa yet, but will start soon now that Qgis 1.4 is out.  I don't use the cmake build any more, except to occassionally test that it works.

Hi John

Could you send me the svg file you used and a small test dataset where the 
problem happens? Like that, I could check if it works on my system or not.

The svg files I tested so far worked (but not all 100% correct, probably 
because of the Qt SVG classes).

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

It seems to not work on shapefiles, postgis, etc. Here is a test shapefile anyway. I used several standard svg symbols from the default selection, none of which worked. Perhaps I did not try enough. The red and blue asterisk thing is one. Here's one of my own that did not work also.

Thanks,
John

Hm, it works for me here (kubuntu 9.10).

See screenshot

Maybe a problem only on Mac?

Hi all,

we've been working hard on several QGIS things these days and first one
more or less ready to show is a new python plugin RasterCalc. It is
based on Barry's RasterLang idea, but it is using more straighforward
formula mechanism (LISP is hard), familiar calculator interface and
some more goodies.

Please give it a go and we'd like to have feedback. Please note, that
few functions are yet locked, but we plan to unlock them if the basic
logic is working ok.

Don't forget to turn on experimental plugins in your plugin installer.
Have fun.

Hi Maxim

I had a play with your plugin - great job! Some comments:

- It would be nice to be able to do things like assign value of null
to all pixels below 128
- the combo box with ndvi / difference would be nice if it actually
used the layers of the current image e,g, ndvi just adds a generic
formular
- it would be nice to remember the state of the add to map checkbox.

This is something that I would love to see go into the raster menu
that Paolo et al are working on, and then eventually go into the core
of QGIS.

Regards

Tim

Oops, was meant for the list also. Thanks

Martin, is there a specific setting for cmake or are these speedups automagic?

Cheers,
John

Thanks for the quick turnaround. The only (I think) problem I have now
is with pyqwt. I'm unable to build it due to an error in a sip
generated file. I'm running sip 4.9.3:

In file included from ../sip/qwt5qt4/qwt_plot_rescaler.sip:36:
./qwt_plot_rescaler.h:120: error: incomplete type ?QwtPlot? used in

Just checking - are you following the Qgis INSTALL instructions?  They were recently updated with Qwt build intructions and today the install guide on the wiki was updated to what's in svn.  And of course it has the SIP/PyQt instructions, with some custom options for using the system Python in Leopard and Snow.

Yes, although the build instructions for PyQWT didn't work for me but
I have gotten past that. Now I'm getting a link error in QGIS:

Ah, there is a detail in the PyQt build that up to now wasn't important, but it is for PyQwt.  I'm not sure if it's a PyQt bug or not, or maybe a glitch in Qt if PyQt gets this setting from Qt.  After configuring PyQt, edit pyqtconfig.py and change the qt_dir line to:

'qt_dir': '/usr',

then make and install.  You can fix an already-installed PyQt by editing the installed pyqtconfig.py.

Then the PyQwt configure will work.  I'll update INSTALL with this.

If you have an older template, do you have to update it to get the speedup in the build, or will it pick up these improvements anyway?

The compilation part is automatic.  

An existing user config should work, as long as the defaults for the new config variables work for you (they should be fine for normal SIP/PyQt installations).

Thanks for explaining that. It is building now. Note that the configure command is inside the configure directory, a detail that probably should also be added to the instructions.

Just gotta make sure again: the INSTALL mentions the (yet another, I know) hack to 'fix' the Qt installation for QtCLucene and QtUiTools when used with a system SDK.

If you did this, maybe your Xcode configuration isn't seeing this.  It's possible that /usr/local isn't automatically searched by Xcode (I must have done something so that it is for me).

Try adding this to your qgis_user.xcconfig:

QT_LIB_UITOOLS = -L/usr/local/lib -lQtUiTools

Yes I had missed the need for a symlink but found it shortly before
your email. It builds and runs but without Python support. There is an
error in loading PyQt---I guess that's progress.

Hi Marco,

I now realize that my butterfly svg has a halo border (I was trying to make them stand out as point symbols on dark backgrounds; no way to add a buffer to symbols yet like you can do with labels). Still it is unusual that it renders it so differently on my system than yours based on your screen grab.

Also, when I tested printing to pdf the fill patter from the composer, the svg is scaled up to a huge size, practically filling the entire map space with only one symbol. Have you tested a print to pdf yourself yet?

As a side note, it would be great to have an option in the symbol properties to adjust the spacing between repeats of the svg image fill. I.e., padding the repeated elements by some value so the spacing can be adjusted without having to manually change the svg symbol itself.

Cheers,
John

Not to interrupt, but I had the same problem building with my older user settings file. I created a new one from the template, and all went well. I did not run a diff on them or anything, but it might be that one does need to update that with recent updates.

I assume you compiled PyQt for the python.org Python 2.5, and then configured Qgis for the same?  It should work theoretically, though I haven't tried that combination (the default configuration for the Xcode project is to use the system python).

Or as John pointed out, maybe your old configuration file for Qgis is still configured for the python.org Python but you intended to use the system python?

Which version of Qt are you using?

I also think this would be a usefull option. Could you fill an enhancement

This is a bug in the Qt pdf printer (see the answer that I received on the qt-
interest mailing list about it). However, I think not all versions are 
affected. At my development machine in the office, it seems to work with pdf too.

What qt version are you using? Perhaps downgrading to 4.5.x makes some sense, if not for the pdf issue, then maybe for the rendering issue above. I have not tested an image export yet.

 What operating system? Print has always worked for me under Linux.
Normally under Windows there's no console, so where is the print going
to go? Or are you starting Qgis from a command line console and not
getting any output?

 You could use python's ability to print to a log file if you are
really pulling your hair out with this.

 Plenty of code examples in the Qgis source, especially the python
plugins. Note that Qgis tends to work on Qgis layers, which may or may
not be shapefiles - they could be PostGIS layers or any other OGR
source really.

 If it's a really urgent situation then I find that money makes things
happen a lot quicker. There are companies that will do Qgis
development for you, see the Qgis web site or the OSgeo web site for
help.

Dear List,

I would like to use qgis api to manage the attributes of shape-files.  
Adding attributes to shapefile is working correctly.
But when I try to delete an attribute from the attribute table, it  
doesn't do anything.
I looked up the vectordataprovider, and it seems the feature is not  
implemented, am I right?
My provider has no capability to delete attributes...

Is there any other way to make the attrib deletion?

Thanks,

Hi

the deletion of attributes in shapefiles is not supported by GDAL library:
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2671

Anyway you could use Table Manager plugin from Borys Jurgiel for it.

You should try the latest QGIS 1.4.0. QGIS 1.3.0 had known bugs in the PDF
export.

Hi Arpita.

You should be able to get what you want porting the qgsmaptoolselect.cpp
code [1] to python. Then just set the maptool in the canvas:

        self.toolSelect = MapToolSelect( self.canvas )
        self.canvas.setMapTool( self.toolSelect )

Regards,

Germ?n.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] List layer from Legend
Message-ID: <4B54CA2E.6060104@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am making the python plugin and need show layers in QTreeWidget with 
same order show in Legend/Layer.

The list of layers by :
layerRegistry = core.QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance()
it is not same order by Legend.

I have success get list of layer's name by find the QTreeWidget with 
name 'Legend':
### getDocWidgetLegend
def getDocWidgetLegend():
  widget = None
  lst = qgis.utils.iface.mainWindow().children()
  for item in lst:
    if type(item) == QtGui.QDockWidget and 
item.objectName().compare('Legend') == 0:
      widget = item
  return widget
### getMapLegend
def getMapLegend(widgetLegend):
    widget = None
  for item in widgetLegend.children():
    if item.objectName().compare('theMapLegend') == 0:
      widget =  item
  return widget
### Use functions
widgetLegend = getDocWidgetLegend()
treeLegend = getMapLegend(widgetLegend)
### End scripts

The problem is when the have same layer's name in Legend, i don't know 
how take exact source.

The other method is read the entries in project:
project = core.QgsProject.instance()

I don?t know how get entries in tag Legend in project:
Example QGis project file:
<!DOCTYPE qgis PUBLIC 'http://mrcc.com/qgis.dtd' 'SYSTEM'>
<qgis projectname="" version="1.5.0-Trunk" >

    <legend>
        <legendlayer open="true" checked="Qt::Checked"

            <filegroup open="true" hidden="false" >

            </filegroup>
        </legendlayer>
....

I would like how use "project.entryList()" to take values of  all layerid's.

Do someone know how to solve it?

Thank you Luiz

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Get rasters/vectors format name from selected file
	filter
Message-ID: <baea77b11001181419k3199a4bud77aa0e5bb00a748@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would to retrieve the rasters/vectors format name
from the selected filter in a save file dialog. This to
choose automatically the right output format
depending on the selected filter.

To avoid duplicated code, I used as dialog filter the
qgis functions:
QgsRasterLayer::buildSupportedRasterFileFilter()
QgsProviderRegistry::instance().fileVectorFilters()

I cannot use the file info because I want to create it
and it may not exists.

By the way, I get the rasters format short name
using the filter in this manner:
1. get the filter name,
2. for each GDAL driver search the one that have
as long name the filter name
3. return the driver short name

For vectors this not works. Infact the filter name is
not related with the OGR driver but it is harded in
code.

It's not important, but the code is in python.

Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

Hi Luiz.

You can get the orderer list of layers from QgsMapCanvas class:

 *canvas = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()
for i in range( canvas.layerCount() ):*

* ly = canvas.layer( i )
*

* print ly.name(), ly.getLayerID()*


I don't know if there's another method but I guess the QgsLegendInterface
class (added in v.1.4) [1] will provide some useful methods to play with
legend layers and groups.

Meanwhile (v.1.4) you can get the group names:

 *legend = qgis.utils.iface.legendInterface()*

*for group in legend.groups():*

* print group*

Germ?n,

Thanks for response.

The MapCanvas only work with layers in canvas. If you have layers in 
legend where it is not checked,
they are not calculated by canvas.layerCount()

I test the /legend, but legend.groups() is empty when don?t have the 
layer of type group, the legend
don?t have root group with all layers for fist level.
I tested with QGIS 1.4 and QGIS 1.5 r12771M, both in Windows

Hello List,

Quick question.  The following piece of code seemed to always work
before upgrading to 1.4, but now it seems to fail with this message:

The program has unexpectedly finished.

Any ideas with what the cause might be?  Any help or direction would
be greatly appreciated.

Hi all.
Who is planning to go to Barcelona?
http://2010.foss4g.org/
Apparently registration is fairly expensive (360 to 465 EUR):
http://2010.foss4g.org/registration.php
if compared to our hackfest usual expenses.
Any thoughts?
All the best.

Message-ID: <1ED6A2F3-C4F7-43D8-AFAE-635B1865A914@geo.uu.se>

OSX 10.6.2, spatialite 2.3.1, GEOS 3.2.0

Hi!

I have a couple of vectorlayers from a spatialite database - point, linestring and multipolygon. The following happens:
QGis 1.3: QGis crashes when open attribute table or "Identify Features" is applied on any spatialite layer with more than one column in the attribute table.
QGis 1.4: QGis crashes when "Identfify Features" is applied on a multipolygon layer, here with more than one column in the attribute table. On point layers with more than one column in the attribute table "Identify Features" works sometimes, otherwise QGis crashes. In difference to QGis 1.3 "Open attribute table" works always. I have not recognised any other problems when working with these layers (e.g. symbology, labels).
No observations on current trunk (can't get it to build without errors).

Starting QGis 1.4 from the terminal the error message points towards a problem with GEOS:
"GEOS: IllegalArgumentException: Points of LinearRing do not form a closed linestring
Bus error"

However, in the editor I can verify that the polygon is closed. (The editor function "capture polygon" results also in a crash the same error message as the above")

Has anybody observed a similar problem?

Cheers,

Henning

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with Color
Message-ID: <760214.78069.qm@smtp103.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Dear all,

i'm writing a plugin form to set the color of different object of the 
same layer.
i'd like to realize something like the Color map in the Raster Layer 
properties: a table where each entry is an object and for each object 
the user can set a color through QColorDialog.getColor() function.
I tried to realize the form using the QTableWidget object but an 
error occurred (TypeError: 'QColor' object is unindexable) when i 
tried to read the color.

      Colors = [QColor(0,255,0),QColor(255,0,0),QColor(0,0,0)]
      self.lstColorBoat.clear()
      self.lstColorBoat.setRowCount(len(Colors))
      self.lstColorBoat.setColumnCount(2)
      self.lstColorBoat.setHorizontalHeaderLabels(["Boat", "Color"])
      self.lstColorBoat.setSelectionMode(QTableWidget.SingleSelection)
      self.lstColorBoat.setSelectionBehavior(QTableWidget.SelectRows)

      for i, ItmColor in enumerate(Colors):
          item = QTableWidgetItem("KitICT" + str(i))
          self.lstColorBoat.setItem(i, 0, item)

          item = QTableWidgetItem(ItmColor[0])
          self.lstColorBoat.setItem(i, 1, item)
      pass

May someone help me?

Thank you, Michele.

Right, the layers in map layer registry have arbitrary ordering.

The problem with this approach is that the implementation details
could change in future releases without any warning and will lead to
broken code.

You could use item's tooltip() method - it returns the same string as
layer.publicSource() so it might be a reliable identification of the
layer. But remember: that's also an implementation detail that can be
changed.

Unfortunately project doesn't always reflect the current state, so you
might work with outdated entries.

There might be a better solution, however it will require you to do a
bit of c++ coding. From v1.4 there's QgsLegendInterface class which
allows plugin developers to work with the legend widget in a more
convenient way. Currently the interface doesn't offer much, but I
would be happy to see any patches that add methods that allow listing
of layers etc.

Just making sure: have you recompiled your code after upgrade to 1.4?
Is QGIS 1.4 itself working fine? (e.g. it opens a shapefile without problems)
Is that a standalone application or a plugin?
If it's an application, do you initialize QgsApplication?
Is the provider path in your code (/usr/lib/qgis) still valid?

The code itself looks fine and shouldn't be affected by upgrades.
(Except for that you create an instance of QgsVectorLayer and never
free it.)

QgsMapToolIdentify class is not a part of gui library, thus can't be
used within plugins. But in case you're interested in some of the
functionality it provides, feel free to check the code
(src/app/qgsmaptoolidentify.cpp) and port it to python.

Martirn,

Thanks for response.

I understand the missing interface to Legend.

I only tried resolve this problem with what offer the plugin.

The best way is use the QgsLegendInterface.

In the moment, i make the plugin (python) for Zip layers, first create 
shapefile and after zipped.

I will start writing plugin in C++, and after i will make patches to QGIS.

Step by step for contribute to QGIS:
1) Make plugin in Python
2) Make plugin in C++
3) Make patches...

Aekansh,

You can read the my plugin:
"Image catalog from INPE - View and order to download"
in user-contributed <http://pyqgis.org/repo/contributed>  
(http://www.pyqgis.org/)

I make the class for Identify.

I would recommend you to avoid rewriting your plugin to c++ if you
don't have reasons for doing that: the distribution, installation and
maintenance of python plugins is much better and easier than c++
plugins. But it might be a good exercise if you're not yet familiar
with c++ :-)

You have to import the class:
*from map_tool_seleccionar import SeleccionarMapTool*

Then instanciate an object:
*self.toolSeleccionar = SeleccionarMapTool( self.canvas )*

And when you want, activate the tool:
*self.canvas.setMapTool( self.toolSeleccionar )*

That's all.

Martin,

Thanks for replying to my email.

I have done a bit more looking at my problem and it looks like the
problem really lies (maybe) in the qatomic_i386.h file with the inline
bool QBasicAtomicInt::ref() function.  If I don't step into the code I
sent before that is where it fails.  I am using the Qt Creator IDE,
which I like but seem to have trouble debugging with.

I have answered your questions below, but am not sure if maybe my
recent findings change things.  I need to do some more Google-ing
probably.

I am new to C++ so that is a good question, but yes I have recompiled
my code and it compiled fine.

Yes, seems to work fine.

It is a stand alone application.

I don't initialize QgsApplication.  Is this required?  I didn't do
this previously either.  My application performs an analysis and
generates a few shapefiles but does not display them.  On a side note
I would like to make it a plugin in the future, but am working out
some other issues first.

Yes it seems to be.

Message-ID: <2E95F75EDC25D54999387A1E2E6EF6274349045A59@MBX02.cgcent.miami.edu>

Good afternoon All,

I use Python 2.5.4 along with OSGeo4W and win32 OS. I am programming a QGIS application but have no trouble with that part right now. I'm posting to you guys because you are very smart and wouldn't mind a small challenge... help is welcome, please.

I have trouble with memory when using the sumComb list below, that has a size of 2,657,205 elements. I DO NEED this many elements because they are product of combinatorial math operations. To solve my memory problem I created a file on disk that stores the elements of the list as they are created. Now, I need to use the 'list' in a generator and have not been able to replicate the effect without actually calling/storing the list in memory, that is, I need to use the data directly from the file on disk:

I need to mimic what the following generator does:

def  validList(sumComb, GammaPossible, valid):
    for l in sumComb:
       for m in sumComb:
         for n in sumComb:
                k = [l,m,n]
                i = 0
                while i < valid:
                     C = 0
                     j = 0
                     while j < 3:
                           C = C +((GammaPossible[i][j])*k[j])
                           j += 1
                     yield C
                     i += 1

By not using the list sumComb in memory, but having its elements in a file F writen using F = open("my_list.txt", "w") and where elements are stored with column "/n" separation. I have not been able to find the appropriate syntax for the nested 'for' loops to replace sumComb list by using F.readlines(), str.split(), etc.  Please help me with this little challenge.

Angelica.

Hi

I've got a python renderer almost working, apart from a fatal crash when I try to apply it to a layer!  Hopefully I'll get that sorted soon :-)

Can I configure the renderer so that it is not presented as an option for line and polygon layers.  It is only appropriate for point layers, so ideally it shouldn't show in the dialog for other layer types.  I guess the least I can do is show an error dialog box if it is selected for other types?

Thanks

When creating a sample renderer, I've also experienced few crashes:
most often the reason was an exception thrown from python which caused
invalid behaviour in c++ code. You can try to wrap the "bad" python
code in a try/except block to find out what goes wrong.

Setting renderer to support only certain type of features is not
possible now. Your suggestion will work fine.

Hi all,

I post the plugin "Zip Layers", site of User-Contributed Python Plug, 
this plugin create zipfiles from
layers of  Layers/Legend in QGIS.

Each zipfile is a shapefile of one layer.
The layer is not necessary be in shapefile format.

I tested with a spatialite source, where, the BLOB field was saved how 
text field.
I believe if have the field not supported by shapefile provider(OGR), 
this will be created how text field.
I would like testing the datetime field from layer in Postgresql/Postgis.
Please, someone can test this case.

BTW, Italy seems the first country for QGIS:

Hi,

I have a problem in QGIS 1.4.0 when I reproject a gpx file into Belgian
lambert 72 coordinate system : the waypoints are not correctly placed on the
map (see the image
http://www.fsagx.ac.be/gf/outilslogiciels/Garbel/proj4.jpg, correct
positions are in red). In QGIS, the towgs84 parameters are
'+towgs84=106.869,-52.2978,103.724,-0.33657,0.456955,-1.84218,1' for this
coordinate system. According to a discussion on the proj.4 mailing list (
http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2010-January/005016.html), the
correct parameters seems to be
'+towgs84=-99.059,53.322,-112.486,0.419,-0.830,1.885,-1' (accurate to a

What is your memory problem? Handling few millions of items shouldn't
be a problem nowadays.

Anyway, what about using this generator (instead of using directly
'sumComb' list):

def sumCombGen():
  for line in file("my_list.txt"):
    yield float(line)

For each line in the input file it returns parsed floating point
number. To check the generator:

for i in sumCombGen():
  print "item", i

IIRC it's not clear how the tabbed interface should behave. Some of
the unanswered questions:
- one project per QGIS or one project per tab? (the first option
probably makes more sense)
- what differences should be allowed among tabs: allow different layer
sets, different layer visibility settings, different layer symbologies
- or use tabs only with different extents with the same data?
- how the legend will be affected? allow e.g. different active layer
for each tab?
- how the map tools should work? bound to one canvas or should they
interact with multiple canvases?
- how the plugins should behave? until now, there are only one map
canvas that plugin use. With multiple canvases, should plugin work
with just one canvas or with all canvases (tabs)?

There are probably some more unanswered questions, these are just the
ones from the top of my head. Probably other devs will add more
thoughts. Having answers would enable us to think about the
architecture. I think we're currently missing some practical use cases
how the users would like to use the tabbed interface.

It's kind of possible. From 1.4 release there's support for caching of
rendered layers (turned off by default). You can turn it on in options
dialog. Then always make sure to erase cache for the layer that has
been changed (layer.setCacheImage(None)). It will get rendered again,
while the rest of the layers should stay untouched (their cache image
will be displayed).

Hello!

I'll throw in an idea for a practical use case, although I must admit that I am not currently a stable user of QGIS (or any other OS GIS).

We are developing a distributed hydrological model framework, which simulates spatio-temporal dynamic processes, usually with discharge from a set of subcatchments as the final target. This framework has just been decided to become an Open Source project, but is not yet established as such.

For each time step, the model simulates a large number of variables and states that would be interesting to monitor, almost like an animation, but as the simulation goes. It would be very useful in subjective model diagnostics to select some of these, and see the simultaneous development of i.e. precipitation, snow storage, soil water and runoff maps. It would be desirable to have some sort of connected zoom, ensuring that all the map windows show the same area.

I have not even started to implement such a map interface module, but the idea of doing this through an existing GIS program has been there for a long time. At the moment, the system offers no display of maps or time series graphs.

For sure the ease of handling many map windows separately and as a group will determine how well a GIS can serve as front end to the hydrological model framework. Tabbed monitors would go some of the way, even better would be multiple canvases or one multi-map canvas split in 4 or 6 sub-windows with connected zoom and updating capability.

Best regards,
Sjur K :-)

Ol? Luiz,
nice works as always.

Just a few notes:

a) if the vector is a shape and the .prj file is not available then the
plugin throws a pyhton error "OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or
directory: '/home/gio/Desktop/penela/mat_base/cart_2/vector.prj'

b) once a zip is created the button "create zips" become not available
to be be clicked again

c) under linux (ubuntu), in the UI, the "description layer" window is a
little higher than the "vector layers" window. It would be good also to
let the user resize the UI at least horizontally to improve the reading
of the infos in the "description layer" window.


thanks!

Giovanni,

Thanks for  evaluate the plugin.

Answers for your comments
a) OK.
This error appers when source is shapefile and do not have selected 
features.
I do not check if  shapefile have PRJ.
Corrected bug!

b) It is needed because the user can click "create button" again when 
process  is running.
I believe the zip operation is made only once

c) I changed UI for resize

New version 0.1.1

This was a missing change to a sip file. I hope it works with r12820 again.

Hello Martin and others,

I am still having trouble with my application; when I try and to call:
QgsVectorLayer * mypVectorLayer  = new QgsVectorLayer(myLayerPath,
myLayerBaseName, myProviderName); my program ends unexpectedly.  I
have tried to walk through the code and it looks like it never even
gets to the QGIS code but dies in the qatomic_i386.h file with the
inline bool QBasicAtomicInt::ref() function.

I have put together a small Qt project that fails in this way for me.
I am wondering if I could send this project to someone (it is about
130 KiB) who is running Kubuntu 9.10 and QGIS 1.4 and see if they have
the same problem.  I am really stumped.  This all worked fine for me
in the past.  I put the project down for a week or so during which
time I ran updates, installed Spatialite and PostGIS, and upgraded to
QGIS 1.4.  Now it doesn't seem to work, however, QGIS seems to work
fine.  I feel like I must be missing something obvious here.

Thanks,

Matt

An earlier release is always possible (and probably welcome, as several important
bugs have already been fixed in trunk).
All the best.

Thanks for this. Unfortunately compilation of r12820 (and using a

If I were you, then I'd use the 'pgsql2shp' command that comes with
PostGIS. Try this one:

  # ~> pgsql2shp --help

and read it's output,

Or just use the postgis manager plugin.

I believe the question was how to go from shapefile to pgsql. If so, my preferred method is to do this from the Terminal.

Assuming you have a postgis enabled database called 'postgis', and you are importing data with epsg code 26911, this will work:

shp2pgsql -d -I -s 26911 my_shape.shp my_shape | psql -d postgis

The -d command is only needed if you are overwriting an existing table (replacing it), although it won't hurt if the table does not already exist. The -I command creates an index on the geometry column, so it will speed data access. The -s specifies the epsg code so the table will have an associated CRS. Then you have the shapefile and the name for the table in your pgsql database. Finally, this is piped to the psql command where you specify your database.

Cheers,
John

Message-ID: <D2AA881A-E31D-4690-BDFF-4C057D646DD8@kyngchaos.com>

By popular demand, and to widen the test base, I will start providing dev builds of Qgis.

Only Snow Leopard is supported, framework-based only.  Builds will occur sporadically, as I have time and feel like it ;-)  The first build is for Qt 4.5 Carbon (yes, it contains the raster speed fix), hopefully future builds will be Qt 4.6 Cocoa 64bit.

This is a build of the bleeding edge of Qgis, use at your own risk.  It contains bug fixes and new features, but may (probably) have new bugs.

Testing is encouraged.  Report bugs to trac or check the dev list.

Hi Sjur

creation of such a frontend should be easy with QGIS libraries with
any recent QGIS version (>= 1.0) either using C++ or Python. I believe
the best approach for you would be to create a standalone application
with several map canvas widgets that would share the current extent
and update regularly.

Martin,

Thanks.  Well I finally figured this out.  When I upgraded to 1.4 I
switched repositories from qgis/unstable to ubuntugis-unstable and
somehow ended up with the old 1.3 development files.  Anyway, it is
working.  Thanks again for your help.

Hi all.

The approach of the maps connected is indeed close to the Mirror map plugin
from Aaron Racicot [1]. Maybe it lacks a way of set the symbology for the
layers in the new map (qml?). I guess a legend for each map could be a good
idea, hiding it at first and then showing it from a button. The legend of
the new maps could be just to set the order of the layers and its properties
(state, symbology, more?).

I don't know what is the difference between this and the tabbed interface.
Maybe the last could be to allow two different data sets on the same QGIS
session.

Just to contribute.

Aaron also recently added a tabbed interface [1] to the Quantumnik  
plugin [2]. In this plugin two tabs/mapCanvases are created (within  
the same application window), one that renders layers normally using  
the Qt renderer and another that uses Mapnik as the renderer, but more  
tabs are possible. It does not allow splitting across monitors, but  
that would be cool :)

Hmm, I think I might have a different use case scenario in mind when I
think about a tabbed interface, where each tab could have the
same/similar layers but at different extents/zooms. Or each tab could be
completely different with the idea that each tab equals a component of a
final map composition.

(Arc calls these Data Frames I believe for those who might be familiar.)

Just some ideas,
Alex

Thanks for the advice Martin.

In my case the crashes were due to a careless omission of a return statement in the SymbolLayer clone function.  I guess quantum ended up trying to dereference a null pointer.

When creating a sample renderer, I've also experienced few crashes:
most often the reason was an exception thrown from python which caused
invalid behaviour in c++ code. You can try to wrap the "bad" python
code in a try/except block to find out what goes wrong.

Setting renderer to support only certain type of features is not
possible now. Your suggestion will work fine.

Hi Pythonists,
I've just uploaded to my repo an extremely simple plugin to reload any plugin 
we're working on. It has just two actions:

* one for reloading previously chosen plugin (with the F5 keyboard shortcut)
* one for selecting the plugin to reload (Shift-F5)

It's marked as experimental to not bother normal people, so you need to enable 
this category in the Installer.

Hope you'll find it useful :)

Hi Richard,

sip 4.7.x doesn't work anymore. Try a higher version (4.9 or 4.10 are
known to work fine).

Thanks Martin for your anser.
But this means I'm not able to compile qgis anymore on my vanilla 9.04 
ubuntu without compiling sip myself :-(
Do we really have to be that upfront?

Hi,

The plugin ogr2layers seems to be too old and not working at all with qgis.

Are all plugins proposed in list validated and confirmed to be 
functional with the current version of qgis ?
Can you remove ogr2layers or solved it ?

AFAIK, only the plugins in the 'Official' repository are validated and
confirmed to be functional with the current version of qgis. Since
this plugin is in the 'Contributed' repository, you're probably better
off contacting the plugin author and asking them to fix/update it. Of
course, anyone is welcome to correct me on this :-)

Hi,

it works fine here under qgis 1.4/1.5dev

Actually (I may be wrong) all the plugins available in the qgis
contributed repository should be 1.x compatibles. It turns that not all
plugins are working, but this is not a qgis problem. Issues should be
filed to authors (I believe most of them do read this mailing list).

I plan soon to make a test of all available plugins under win/linux and
report back.


> Can you remove ogr2layers or solved it ?

The ogr2layers was a project (had is own site) that seems has been
abandoned. The plugin originally wasn't 1.x compatible and I asked to
make the necessary changes and add it to repository.

You may want to post here the problems/errors you are getting.


cheers

Hi all.

I have the same trouble, I can't even use QGIS from binary packages after
compiling SIP 4.10. Riverbank seems to delete previous SIP releases from the
servers. Altough I did also compile PyQT 4.7 trying to fix it.

I'm using Ubuntu Jaunty (9.04) and I get a *Segmentation fault* if I want to
use PyQGIS.

I don't know if there is a correct combination of Qt, PyQt, Python and SIP
versions.

I wonder how are using QGIS 1.4 the Ubuntu (9.04) users.   :-/

Germ?n.

I opened a ticket (https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2392) with an 
implementation of a plugin layer registry to support plugin specific layers. 
Also included is a basic sample plugin.

We are now testing a plugin to render maplayers with OpenLayers, using this

Probably not and this could be worked around to compile with older sip
versions. Please send me your generated sipAPIcore.h and
sipcorepart*.cpp files from (build)/python/core and I'll take a
look...

There might be additional packages dependent on SIP/PyQt that might
need recompilation when upgrading SIP/PyQt - python bindings for Qwt
or QScintilla may cause the havoc. Start python interpreter and do
various imports (sip, PyQt4, qgis.core) to find out which part of the
chain is broken.

Anyway I'll try to fix the compilation for sip 4.7.

Message-ID: <2E95F75EDC25D54999387A1E2E6EF6274349045A68@MBX02.cgcent.miami.edu>

Dear Devs:

I am currently using self.canvas.saveAsImage ( FileName,  QPixmap=0,  QString="PNG" ) with only the first argument, the second and third are therefore using default settings. My Qgis version is OSGeo4W Kore 1.0, along with Python2.5.  I have tried many ways of using QPixmap following the API, with no success. I need to set up the resolution of my saved image (int width, int height, depth, ... or dpi if that option alone exists.) Currently, my images are being saved by default at 96 dpi which is very low for my purpose. Please, how are the syntax for using the second argument QPixmap? or... should I define QPixmap before and just call it in the method? how? please give me some exemplified advice.

Thanks,
Angelica.

Hi all,

Let me announce availability of significantly improved
Georeferencer. There are lots of new stuff in it, among the main features:

1. GCP table with errors
2. Completely new interface
3. Raster properties configuration

Let me thank Juergen, he made possible reuse of QGIS dialogs from
plugins and Manuel Massing, whose portion of code we've used.

We welcome you to test it if you use OSGeo4W QGIS under Windows or able to compile
from svn. We'd like to hear about bugs. Please note, we are not
planning to add big features from now, however we can add them to TODO.

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Python plugin reloader

Hi Pythonists,
I've just uploaded to my repo an extremely simple plugin to reload any
plugin 
we're working on. It has just two actions:

* one for reloading previously chosen plugin (with the F5 keyboard
shortcut)
* one for selecting the plugin to reload (Shift-F5)

It's marked as experimental to not bother normal people, so you need to
enable 
this category in the Installer.

Hope you'll find it useful :)

Now that the icons by Robert are used by default in GRASS, why not setting them as a

homogeneous among freeGIS would be an advantage for users.

Hi Maxim

Wow, this is really great work! If there are no objections, I'd like to 
include the plugin to trunk in the next few days.

After a short test it seems to work really well and provides a lot of 
improvements and better user experience.

One minor issue: shouldn't the labels 'link georeferencer to QGIS' and 'link 
QGIS to georeferencer' be switched?

Regards,
Marco

I managed to compile the latest qgis on ubuntu 9.04, but it certainly
was not straight forward. I addition to compiling sip I also had to
compile PyQt4 and PyQwt :-( My first reaction was to search for a ppa
offering binaries for these dependencies. Unfortunately I didn't find
them. It would be nice if we had a ppa for these dependencies like the
ubuntugis ppa. Any volunteers? :-)

Nice work, Borys!

May I suggest you a small change - to allow devs change the default shortcuts:
Instead of
  self.action1.setShortcut(QKeySequence("F5"))
do
  iface.registerMainWindowAction(action, "F5")

And in unload() method of plugin additionally call
iface.unregisterMainWindowAction(action)
This functionality exists from v1.2 so you might need to check whether
these methods exist.

... so now we just need an integrated debugger ;-) Being able to
inspect variables, set breakpoints, step through python code and look
at context of exception in a nice GUI would make dreams of many
developers true. In meanwhile we can use pdb.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Crash when loading layers in memory
Message-ID: <4B5EC5A3.3020008@nordcomp.ru>

Hi, devs!
I`m trying to load vector layers into memory for better performance, but 
at some point application crashes.
Here is the simple example:
   QDomDocument* doc = new QDomDocument("qgis");
   doc->setContent( &proj_file );

   mMapCanvas->readProject( *doc );

   QDomNodeList legendLayers = doc->elementsByTagName("legendlayer");
   QDomNodeList nl = doc->elementsByTagName( "maplayer" );
   for (int i = 0; i < legendLayers.count(); i++)
   {
       QDomNode nod = legendLayers.item( i ).firstChild().firstChild();
       QDomElement elem = nod.toElement();
       QString lid = elem.attribute("layerid");

       for (int j = 0; j < nl.count(); j++)
       {
           if (lid == nl.item( j ).firstChild().firstChild().nodeValue())
           {
               QDomNode maplay = nl.item(j);
               QString type = nl.item( j ).toElement().attribute("type");

               if (type != "vector")
               {
                   qDebug("raster layers not supported. Terminating!");
                   return 1;
               }

               QgsVectorLayer* newLayer = new QgsVectorLayer();
               QgsVectorLayer* vl = 0;
               if ( newLayer->readXML( maplay ) )
               {
                   QgsVectorDataProvider * spr = newLayer->dataProvider();
                   QString geomType;
                   QString layerName = newLayer->name();
                   if ( newLayer->geometryType() == QGis::Point )
                       geomType = "Point";
                   if ( newLayer->geometryType() == QGis::Line )
                       geomType = "LineString";
                   if ( newLayer->geometryType() == QGis::Polygon )
                       geomType = "Polygon";
                   if ( newLayer->geometryType() == QGis::UnknownGeometry )
                       qDebug() << "Unknown geometry";

                   vl = new QgsVectorLayer( geomType, layerName, "memory" );

                   QgsVectorDataProvider * pr = vl->dataProvider();
                   QgsFeatureList list;
                   QgsFeature f;
                   newLayer->select( spr->attributeIndexes(), 
QgsRectangle() );

                   while ( newLayer->nextFeature( f ) )
                   {
                       list.append( f );
                   }
                   if ( !pr->addFeatures( list ) )
                   {
                       qDebug() << "features not added";
                   }
                     vl->copySymbologySettings( *newLayer );

                   QgsMapLayer* ml = 
QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->addMapLayer( vl );
                   myLayerSet.append(QgsMapCanvasLayer(ml, TRUE));
               } else
               {
                   qDebug( "Unable to load layer." );
               }
               delete newLayer;
           }
       }
   }

   delete doc;

If vl->copySymbologySettings( *newLayer ) commented, then loading 
project successfull, else - application crashes.
Any suggestions?

I solved the problem but I found a strange behavior of the repo:

I create a new user putting my old username and a new password. Now I can
change my old project!!!

This is really dangerous!

My Qgis version is OSGeo4W Kore 1.0, along with Python2.5. ?I have tried many ways of using QPixmap following the API, with no success. I need to set up the resolution of my saved image (int width, int height, depth, ... or dpi if that option alone exists.) Currently, my images are being saved by default at 96 dpi which is very low for my purpose. Please, how are the syntax for using the second argument QPixmap? or... should I define QPixmap before and just call it in the method? how? please give me some exemplified advice.

Hi,

saveAsImage() method is meant to really just copy the contents of the
canvas, so if you'd like to work with higher resolution, you should
use the composer classes.

I'm attaching a sample code which I've just put together. When the
code is run from qgis python console, it renders layers from map
canvas with the current extent into a PNG file. The default settings
for composition are page size A4 and resolution 300 DPI (it's possible
to change them). The advantage with this (a bit more complicated)
approach is that you can use also PDF or PostScript output and you can
use further composer items available in map composer (scale bar,
legend, labels, ...) If you need further guidance with usage of
composition and/or composer items, Marco will be able to give you some
more guidance.

It would be helpful if you provided a backtrace. And what QGIS version is that?

One suggestion: instead of copySymbologySettings() try using something like:
vl->setRenderer( newlayer->renderer()->clone() )
IMHO copySymbologySettings() (and hasCompatibleSymbology()) are legacy
methods and it would be better not to use them as they might be
removed in future.

If you're working with QGIS >= 1.4 then layer might use rendererV2()
and renderer() is NULL. Check isUsingRendererV2() to find out which
one is valid.

Thanks a lot! Done in v0.2
I was briefly looking for it and haven't found.

The reloading requires v1.5 ;)

Great plans :) Personally, Let me finish the plugin cleaning first ;)

Thanks for helping! I`m using QGIS 1.3.0, Qt 4.5.2 on windows XP SP2.

vl->setRenderer( newlayer->renderer()->clone() )

don`t solve the problem, log in attach. I`m trying to run application in 
gdb, but it freezes after

Is the renderer from 'newlayer' valid (i.e. not null, contains
meaningful values)? And what renderer type is that? Is the renderer in
'vl' valid?

It would be good if you could try it with a newer qgis version and on other OS.

Layers and renderers seems to be valid:
newLayer->isValid true type: 0 wkbType: 3
newLayer renderer: "Single Symbol" 0x4646fa8
vl is valid: true type: 0 wkbType: 3
setting renderer
vl renderer: "Single Symbol" 0x643d768
renderer setted
deleting newLayer
newLayer->isValid true type: 0 wkbType: 3
newLayer renderer: "Single Symbol" 0x45a0aa0
vl is valid: true type: 0 wkbType: 3
setting renderer
vl renderer: "Single Symbol" 0x4220120
renderer setted
deleting newLayer
newLayer->isValid true type: 0 wkbType: 3
newLayer renderer: "Single Symbol" 0x493cbc0
vl is valid: true type: 0 wkbType: 3
setting renderer
vl renderer: "Single Symbol" 0x6410758
renderer setted
deleting newLayer
deleting doc
Set the Map Canvas Layer Set

and after that application crashes. Maybe someone could test it?

Mathias,

I've applied the patch, my changes are listed on the ticket page.
Thanks for the contribution.
Looking forward to see the OpenLayers layer! ...and MapServer layer :-)

Dane: you might be also interested in using this new functionality for
the Quantumnik plugin... From now one can avoid using the
renderComplete() signal to render map from other sources. Mapnik map
could be represented as a layer, allowing user to modify it directly
by showing layer properties or use more such layers at once...

Hi Craig.

Yes, even searching the packages on the web for compile them is not an easy
task. E.g. I can't find SIP v.4.8 there.

I've missed too those packages in a repository.

Hi Mathias

Cool! I guess with the OpenLayers maplayer, there will be the possibility to 
have a Google maps background in QGIS. This is going to be a real killer 
feature.

I'm looking forward, also, to mapnik and other external layer integration with the composer. Hopefully this will make it all possible.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python plugin architecture and renderer plugins
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E06465A20D9@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

I'm wanting to implement a python based renderer as a plug-in.

This seems straightforward, but there are a couple of interface issues that I cannot fix.

The problem is with the unload function of the class factory.  I cannot unload the plugin if there are current layers rendered using it, so ideally what I want to do is to be able to cancel the unload, or at least postpone it till Quantum exits.

The other thing I want to do is notify users that if they do unload the plugin that they may not be able to reload projects which contain layers rendered using the plugin renderer - if it is no longer installed then the project will fail to reload the layers.

I thought I could do this in the unload function by displaying a dialog box.  However the unload function is called when Quantum exits, as well as when the plugin is unregistered.   I don't want the dialog to pop up every time the user exits.

It looks like I need an uninstall function in the class factory, which is called by the plugin manager before it is uninstalled, and which can cancel the uninstall.

Is there any such function?

Thanks
Chris

Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E06465A211A@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

I'm wanting to associate an icon with a python based renderer plugin, so that it looks like the other renderers in the symbology dialog.  It seems that the icon defined by name in the QgsRendererV2AbstractMetadata constructor.

I guess that the icon name refers to the name of a QIcon resource, and I imagine that I can install the resource with this name somewhere as part of my initGui function of my plugin class factory.

However my knowledge of PyQt lets me down at this point.  Can anyone give me any clues as to how to build an icon resource from a .png file and how to install it so that it shows up as an icon in the Symbology dialog?

Thanks
Chris

Message-ID: <8ed9bbfc1001261459s6511a20aqfea90a3d255d826a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I have worked over a year to understand the QGIS development and now I
try to contribute.
The subject is:
If we want to create a plugin for QGIS with some folders inside for example
on FreeBSD is easy but in Mac Os X using Xcode is not same, because the
script for compile the plugin is not really good.
Let's see the old script:
------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir -p "$DERIVED_FILES_DIR"

cd ../../src/plugins/$TARGET_PLUGINDIR

UIUI=`ls *.ui`

for u in $UIUI
do
    uh=`echo $u | sed 's,\.ui$,.h,'`
    # compare times because output files spec below doesn't seem to work
with wildcards
    if [ ! -f "$DERIVED_FILES_DIR/ui_$uh" ] || [ $u -nt
"$DERIVED_FILES_DIR/ui_$uh" ] ; then
        rm -f "$DERIVED_FILES_DIR/ui_$uh"
        echo "$QTUIC -o \"$DERIVED_FILES_DIR/ui_$uh\" $u"
        $QTUIC -o "$DERIVED_FILES_DIR/ui_$uh" $u
    fi
done

exit 0
------------------------------------------------------------------

and now take a look to my new script

------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir -p "$DERIVED_FILES_DIR"

cd ../../src/plugins/$TARGET_PLUGINDIR

UIUI=`find . -type f -name "*.ui" | sed 's,.\/,,'`

for u in $UIUI
do
    uh=`echo $u | sed 's,[^:]*\/,,' | sed 's,\.ui$,.h,'`
    # compare times because output files spec below doesn't seem to work
with wildcards
    if [ ! -f "$DERIVED_FILES_DIR/ui_$uh" ] || [ $u -nt
"$DERIVED_FILES_DIR/ui_$uh" ] ; then
        rm -f "$DERIVED_FILES_DIR/ui_$uh"
        echo "$QTUIC -o \"$DERIVED_FILES_DIR/ui_$uh\" $u"
        $QTUIC -o "$DERIVED_FILES_DIR/ui_$uh" $u
    fi
done

exit 0
------------------------------------------------------------------
I decided to use the find function and not the ls.
what you think?

Hi

Anyone know how to create an account for the plugin repository?  When I try and sign up at http://pyqgis.org/admin/contributed/account/signup I just get redirected back to the list of plugins at http://pyqgis.org/admin/contributed/python_plugins/list.

Also, is it ok to put up plugins based on the development stream of Quantum? I can set the QGIS minimum version to 1.5, but it will only work with more recent builds.

Thanks
Chris

The register function is currently unavailable due to a security  
issue. I'll have it available later today (~5 hours from now).

Not to be defensive, but what is wrong with ls?  Did you have a problem?  Seems like find + sed is a lot more work.

One thing I probably should do is hardwire the path to /bin/ls so it doesn't accidentally get a MacPorts or Fink ls, which may behave differently than expected.

Sorry, I don't give a good explanation for the change in the script.
Suppose that somebady create a plugin with other subfolders and some of this
subfolders having inside files with the extension *.ui, the ouput of the
command `ls *.ui` is not the same of the `find . -type f -name "*.ui" | sed
's,.\/,,'`( is no V is  \+/ without space) the previous command don't have a
recurrent action and therefore the Xcode build system will produce an error.
Also the UIUI=`find . -type f -name "*.ui" | sed 's,.\/,,'` is not the only
change in the script, the line after the "do" is changed by:
uh=`echo $u | sed 's,[^:]*\/,,' | sed 's,\.ui$,.h,'`
it's necessary for eliminate the path names and leave only the file name
changed with the *.h extension.
Selecting the good ls command is a possible solution, but I think that the
Mac Os X distribution command ls don't have a recurrent action, maybe with
some option.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] develop c++ plugin under Win
Message-ID: <48d9b78e1001270304v48404ad2u21d2e28f3043d5d4@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to develop c++ plugin under windows.
I want to use Visual Studio to do it.

Using plugin_builder.py I get a
standard c++ plugin template and a CMakeList.txt.
Using CMake for win I can't obtain
a visual studio project(obtain some error).

How have to modify the CMakeList to correctly obtain a VS project ?
Which is the best way to develop plugin with visual studio ?

Supposing that my plugin is correctly built how I have to say to Qgis of
load that plugin? (the tutorial says to copy the dll in the plugins
directory).

Note that I ma using QGIS installed from pre-built installer not builded
from source.

Thanks in advance,

Luca

Why not fixing it while in trunk? You can get more testing and feedback this way, and
possibly also help from other devs.
All the best.

I guess I'm assuming that all Qt-related sources are at the top level of the plugin, that's standard for the plugins so far.  Subfolders are usually used for stuff like a bundled supporting library.  I guess it can be helpful to organize a plugin with a lot of sources and ui's.

ls can list subfolders with the -R flag, though files are grouped by subfolder with noise that's unhelpful.  If you want ui files in a subfolder, stripping the paths is not good because the uic command won't know where they are ;)  It would be better to cd into the ui folder first, just change the 'cd' line and leave the ls command as is:

cd ../../src/plugins/$TARGET_PLUGINDIR/myuifolder

All derived sources within a target get dumped into the same DERIVED_FILES_DIR which is automatically added by Xcode to all target compilation, so your sources will still find them to #include.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] sip not working with py 2.6?
Message-ID: <4B606098.6080907@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I'm getting an error in building (Debian unstable, up to date):
ccmake ..

 CMake Error at cmake/FindSIP.cmake:52 (MESSAGE):
   Could not find SIP
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   CMakeLists.txt:354 (FIND_PACKAGE)

However, I have istalled:

i A python-sip4                     - Python/C++ bindings generator runtime libr
i A python-sip4-dev                 - Python/C++ bindings generator development
i   sip4                            - Python/C++ bindings generator

Any hint on how to solve this would be appreciated.
All the best.

Looks like python-sip4 doesn't have python2.6 support yet.

Upgrading helps, but now it's PyQt4 that's not found with python2.6.

Hi

I've done some digging into this, and it seems that I can create an icon, but I have difficulty associating it with the renderer in the dialog.  The problem is in qgsrendererv2propertiesdialog.cpp, line 74, which reads:

    QString iconPath = QgsApplication::defaultThemePath() + m->iconName();
The problem I have my icon resource (built with pyrcc4) isn't necessarily on the default theme path.  I guess I could put it there, but that would depend on it not being changed.  I wonder if it would be better to code this as:

    QString iconPath = m->iconName();
    if( ! iconPath.startsWith(':')) iconPath = QgsApplication::defaultThemePath() +iconPath

That way I can use my own resource path, which avoids any possible conflict.

Is this something that could be implemented?

Thanks
Chris

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python renderer plugin icon

I'm wanting to associate an icon with a python based renderer plugin, so that it looks like the other renderers in the symbology dialog.  It seems that the icon defined by name in the QgsRendererV2AbstractMetadata constructor.

I guess that the icon name refers to the name of a QIcon resource, and I imagine that I can install the resource with this name somewhere as part of my initGui function of my plugin class factory.

However my knowledge of PyQt lets me down at this point.  Can anyone give me any clues as to how to build an icon resource from a .png file and how to install it so that it shows up as an icon in the Symbology dialog?

Thanks

Message-ID: <4B613E7B.8020108@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Yesterday evening I've been at a Pisa LUG meeting (http://www.gulp.linux.it) to
stimulate interest on the hackfest, and ask for their participation and support.
They suggested we could also do, at the beginning of the fest (possibly during the
first afternoon), a short tutorial on how to start coding in QGIS: we can do that at
the University http://www.di.unipi.it/, so we can stimulate the participation of
students and newcomers to the project, and try to raise new qdev. I think the
tutorial of Gary should be a good start, so no need for much work.
Opinions? Ideas?
All the best.

Hi, see this:

http://doc.qgis.org/head/classQgsMapLayer.html#df3b0b576d7812c4359ece2142170308

I cannot use this enum in Python... I found that VectorLayer = 0 and
RasterLayer = 1.

Try it in the python console:

layer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer()
layer.type() == QgsMapLayer.VectorLayer

[True]

Use QgsMapLayer.VectorLayer and QgsMapLayer.RasterLayer.

Python doesn't really have an enum type, so instead PyQt uses unique int values.
As you have found, in Python VectorLayer=0 and RasterLayer=1.
Had there been more layer types, the numbers would simply increase
with the number of layer types.

Michele,

The two classes you are going to need to use are QgsRasterShader and 
QgsColorRampShader.

Hi Chris,

setting the renderer icon as of now is a bit awkward. I'm going to
change it so that the metadata contains instance of QIcon, not just as
file name for the icon. I'll update symbology-ng wiki to give an
example how to do it.

Currently there's no such function that would enable the plugins ask
for confirmation. But that doesn't mean it can't be added :-)
So I believe you need a function, e.g.: canUnload() in plugin's
interface. It would be called from plugin manager (and installer) when
users disables the plugin and it would return True/False to indicate
whether the plugin can be unloaded.

Anyway plugin's unload() method should take care of the layers having
a renderer which is going to be unloaded: it may try to go through all
layers in QgsMapLayerRegistry and reset the renderer for affected
layers to a default one.

In future we might need to create generic dependency tracking, so it
should be clear whether the plugin is safe to unload and if not, which
objects depend on it.

Martin

Hi,

in the layer properties you can set a query via Query Builder to select
some features to display.

There is any way to do set this query from a plugin?

Thank you in advance

Message-ID: <201001291649.19266.mwa@sourcepole.ch>

We have added a watermark plugin to the Sourcepole repository, showing the 
basic usage of the recently added QgsPluginLayer. With this plugin you can add 
a layer showing a semitransparent user-defined image in the lower left corner 
of the map.

The tricky bit was calculating the scaling and dimensions of the painter area 
in draw(), so the watermark is also rendered correctly in the print composer. 
This calculation could eventually be moved to QgsPluginLayer.
There is still the issue of the unscaled rendering in the print composer 
preview.

You can find the plugin sources at
http://github.com/pka/qgis-watermark-plugin

Hi,
thanks for the plugin.

I'm trying to install it from your repository (on qgis 1.4 under linux)
but I get the following

"the plugin is broken. Python said:
name 'qgspluginlayer' is not defined"

thanks in advance

forget it, I didn't noticed that qgis required version is 1.5

On trunk it installs fine.

Hi Mathias,

This is a nice demonstration of the QgsPluginLayer. It worked very well on my OS X trunk build, with the exception of the print composer scaling issue that you mentioned. 

Would it be difficult to enhance the plugin to include some placement options (i.e., upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left and center)? Also, transparency settings would be useful as well.

Cheers,
John

Please provide details about your particular problem (snippet of code
that doesn't work, what else did you try, your platform, qgis version

Compilation with sip 4.7 should be working again in trunk, so you
might want to try it again with stock distribution packages.

Hi,

I'm trying to compile on ubuntu 9.10 and I also get the

CMake Error at cmake/FindSIP.cmake:52 (MESSAGE):
   Could not find SIP
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   CMakeLists.txt:354 (FIND_PACKAGE)

message.


cheers

Umm... this is actually something different...

Isn't that related to a recent update of your distribution? Because
this macro (FindSIP) hasn't been modified recently (two weeks?)
Can you confirm that all of these packages are installed?
- python-sip4
- python-sip4-dev
- sip4

And when you run in python:
>>> import sipconfig

will that return any error?

I'm on ubuntu 9.10 too and no problems here.

I compiled without problems until two/three days ago. I do not see any
related update in my system. At least in the last week.

ok... if you go to 'cmake' subdir inside qgis directory and run
python FindSIP.py
... will it print anything?

And you could try to make a clean build to see whether it helps.

Hi Martin

Yes, sounds just what i want.  Though I think it may be called canUninstall, or canUnregister, or something like that.  Because of the potential impact on saved jobs I want to warn the users of what to expect if the remove the login.  I don't want to do this on unload, as that happens every time they shut down qgis.  

Would be great (for me!!) if this function was added to the plugin interface  :-)  

Thanks
Chris

Currently there's no such function that would enable the plugins ask
for confirmation. But that doesn't mean it can't be added :-)
So I believe you need a function, e.g.: canUnload() in plugin's
interface. It would be called from plugin manager (and installer) when
users disables the plugin and it would return True/False to indicate
whether the plugin can be unloaded.

Anyway plugin's unload() method should take care of the layers having
a renderer which is going to be unloaded: it may try to go through all
layers in QgsMapLayerRegistry and reset the renderer for affected
layers to a default one.

In future we might need to create generic dependency tracking, so it
should be clear whether the plugin is safe to unload and if not, which
objects depend on it.

Martin

	topology editing
Message-ID: <25bc040b1001310556m4298aeccs875256a58732ab11@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I'd like to enable QGIS to visualize topology errors and do more
sophisticaed topology editing (without GRASS).
It's something similar to ArcGIS/ArcEditor Geodatabase Topology
(called topology rules there).

For visualization of errors I would 1) implement a PostGIS validation
function and put the features found into a new feature class and
visualize it in a separate layer. See below for some topology rules
I'm thinking of.
=> Does anyone have experiences with such a Python plugin?

For helping to maintain topology while editing I also would implement
this as validation function in PostGIS but are not sure how to
interact between Stored Procedures and QGIS vector editing functions
(at least simply displaying messages from return values of these
functions). => Any help here?

Regards, S.

I?ve compiled following ?topology types? so far:
* Area topology cleaning: Eliminating sliver polygons, overshoots,
 undershoots (polygon topology, same polygon class).
* Polygons are non-overlapping (polygon topology, same polygon class).
* Polygons are inside other polygons (polygon topology, two different
 polygon classes).
* Line topology cleaning: Snapping close endpoints
 (vertex-vertex/route topology).
* Routes that share vertices (vertex-vertex/route topology, same
 line class).
* Line objects that share (inner) endpoints (node-vertex topology,
 same line class).
* Line objects that are ?connected to? point objects at their
 (outer/inner) endpoints (node-node topology, line and point classes).
* Point objects that share points along line objects (node-vertex
 topology, line and point classes).

Pls. consider "are" (validation) as place holder to be also "should not"
(validation) or "should be snapped to" (cleaning).

Hi Stefan,

some work on topology checking has been done already: we've been
implementing such plugin within qgis-mapper project. I've extracted
the sources from our private repository and put it on github:
http://github.com/wonder-sk/topol

The user adds some topology rules for various layers, runs the check
and the results are visualized in map canvas. For more info, check
(brief) user and developer documentation in "doc" directory. I would
say the plugin is somewhere around beta stage: it works, but needs
some polishing. It's written in c++ (we've started with python
implementation, but then we've moved it to c++ because it was quite
slow with larger layer). It should work with any vector layers
supported by QGIS, uses geos library for geometry checks. If you'd
like to develop topology checking, this plugin is probably a place
where to start. Currently there's nobody working on the plugin - it
would be great to see some progress with it. Once it's ready for
general consumption, we can add it to c++ plugins that live in qgis
source.

Regards
Martin
