Just a followup, when restoring a memory layer thanks to memory layer saver,
we got QpyNullVariant objects, when we had NoneType object on memory layer's
creation. Updating the values to None restore the unpinned labels. Just use
this

 layer.changeAttributeValue(myFeatureId, myfieldId, None)

I will try to patch memory Layers Saver for this, since I assume some other
side effects with memory layers are expectable

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8yiEzZGamp9dU5WMYs0bhA5bUiSpRpuwhidjVKPAkguQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been mostly absent for the past development cycle, due to family
obligations and other work, but am now able to devote the next 2 1/2 weeks
to prioritizing, diagnosing and (hopefully) fixing as many labeling issues
as I can for the 2.2 release.

If you have reported a labeling issue, please revisit it and add any
additional info you can, *especially* any test data/projects. If you know
of an unreported issue, please add it to the tracker.

If you would like to help code any fixes, please let everyone know by
posting to the particular issue's page first, so there is no duplication of
work. Ideally, any fixes should be as pull requests first.

Again, sorry I have been absent from development for awhile; doubly sorry
for anyone's headache caused by issues that my 2.0-release labeling code
may have caused.

Best regards,

Larry Shaffer

I've updated the MemoryLayerSaver plugin to fix this.  Basically the problem comes from (I believe) the SIP wrapping around QgsFeature attributes.  So for a feature feat with a field 'f',

feat.f=None
value=feat.f
print type(value)

prints PyQtNullVariant.  The same result (expected in this case) if the first line is feat.f=NULL.

I've got around this in the MemoryLayerSaver by not setting the value at all if the required value is None.  This works as when a feature is created all the attributes are None - they just can't be set to that value as far as I can see (through the python API that is..)

Cheers
Chris

Hi,

Just wondered, if "Paste into a new layer" allows you to save as a memory layer; why does it need a layer to be in edit mode to become active?

Is this expected behaviour?

Should I add a bug/feature request?

This is with QGIS self-compile e846521 on linux.

Hi,

To PostGIS and QGIS devs: I'd like to get and setup a PostGIS "web
app" and later on a QGIS server (with Processing/Sextante) as >> WPS

=> What is the status of the work regarding this ?

To QGIS devs: What about a switch in Processing tools (in QGIS

server side, based on a wrapper around spatial databases (like PostGIS
and Spatialite)?

Yours, Stefan

Message-ID: <CAK6pVBXaYq7D90JY0QT5SxPzQMq-WtMb2UGxA2J5DZnnVjfQ4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

I am trying to automate some OSM-data processing in Qgis but I get stuck
while importing the processing module.

No matter whether I do

*from processing.core.VectorWriter import VectorWriter*

or

*import processing.core.VectorWriter*

or

*import processing.core*

or

*import processing*

I always get this warning:

*QPixmap: Must construct a QApplication before a QPaintDevice*

But this only happens in my stand-alone script. If I do *import
processing.core.VectorWriter* in the Python console in Qgis, no problem...

Any idea where this can come from?

Ubuntu 13.10, Python 2.7.5, Qgis 2.0.1

Thanks and cheers

St?phane

Hi Larry,
thanks a lot for this. IMHO the most urgent issue to fix is this:

marked as a blocker.

Hi Olivier and everyone,

I watched the video, this plugin sound good!
I've been testing this plugin,

My computer: Window s 7 SP1 and 64 bits!

I have two comment:
1- When enable the plugin I can't use the pan pressing the space keyboard
2- Don't work block de distance

Thanks for merging the differents plugins editing.

Good job!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] some flaw in RDP algorithm?
Message-ID: <20140203150836.2a30e950@acerCF>

Hi all,


I do not know if this is the right place to talk about it but I think I
have found a small problem in the plugin fTools, particularly in the
"Simplify geometry" of the module "Geometry tool";

more precisely, the problem is in the RDP algorithm used by the
function;

nothing dramatic, the procedure works properly and provides a
simplified line, but I have isolated some cases in which the solution
is not optimal: some points, not needed for the definition of the line,
are left;

to sum up, I put some considerations in some slides here
http://www.slideshare.net/giulianc/clean-lines-presentation;

can you tell me where and how it can be of interest to discuss this
topic? 

thanks, best regards, sfm+Gtbe(*) :-)

Hi,

We definitely need a better simplify algo in QGIS than Douglas Peucker. It
is very fast, but does not really preserve the "shape" of polygons/lines
and does not preserve topology. Your work seems interesting. Is you
approach similar to Visvalingam algo (used for example in Mapshaper :
http://mapshaper.org/ ) ? Does it preserve topology ?
Having a simplifier that can preserver topology while being fast like
Visvalingam would be great indeed !

ps: sorry to bring personnal will in response of your topic instead of
really answering your question..

Michael

Hi all.
Regarding the new functionality of LizMap 2.9:
http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-plugin/features/timemanager.html#time-manager
would it be possible to share a sample project, or a shapefile? It is unclear from
the docs what the time format should be.
All the best, and merci.

Hi Paolo,

You are right, documentation does not help a lot. We use date.js librairy,
so you can test the format here :
http://www.datejs.com/
You can enter a date in the box under "Mad Skillz..." to check if your format
is taken into account.

Which format do you use ? datetime or string ?

Michael

Thanks Michael,
I was trying blindly, and got frustrated - now it will be far easier.
Perhaps better adding this note to the man?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS SZIP.DLL Licensing?
Message-ID: <A7AAEFA693EF664FA8B1EF28740A964BB6B166@HVXDSP23.us.lmco.com>

Does QGIS have any license agreement related to SZIP use?

I'd like to use QGIS on a project, but we're stuck on whether/how the szip.dll is licensed for use.

For example HDF specifically has a license page asserting permission to use szip in their distribution, so long as it is used within the context of their overall app.  For a commercial firm, the permission is just to decode, not to encode, but that is fine.

I tried just deleting/renaming the szip.dll, since we do not actually need the functionality for our use, but it appears to be tightly bound to the build - qgis errors-out if it does not detect a proper, functioning, szip.dll on startup.

If there isn't a license statement from the intellectual property owner allowing its use/distribution to decode with qgis, is it possible to include a user-controllable switch to allow not including it, or to perhaps include a true GPL zip package, albeit losing the lossless functionality?

Thanks.

Mark

Are you sure this is a QGIS question and not a GDAL question?
I believe that is part of the GDAL method for reading HDF files.

What is the problem with distributing the szip.dll ? There is no agreement
between qgis (or gdal) with szip/hdf group.

My understanding of the info in this page
http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/ is:

- In no circumstances a user can create hdf5 files with szip encoding
within qgis. So far, only gtiff files are created within qgis.

- you are correct in stating that commercial products can use szip for
decoding only, so it is OK for qgis to distribute the szip library.

- as qgis is not a commercial product and does not allow to create
szip-encoded hdf5 files, there is no need for any commercial licence.

- if someone were to write software, based on qgis (and gdal), which sould
create an szip-encoded hdf5 file, that entity would require a commercial
licence

There is no GPL szip library, AFAIK.

Szip is not released under GPL, has patents, is restricted licensing.  It isn't a classic FOSS package.  Here's the license related to Szip use with HDF:

I can't legally use QGIS with SZip, unless there's some kind of license to permit szip.dll distribution with QGIS.  For instance, HDF has permission for anyone, including commercial users (like me, as I work for a company, though we don't directly use QGIS to generate $), to use szip decode functionality.

Possible ways out:

1)       Obtain permission from Joe.Feeley to distribute szip with qgis, same terms as HDF - okay for everyone to use to decode, but commercial users (like me) aren't permitted to use its encode functionality.  That's fine, I can't make new SZip zipfiles, but can get the unpack of them.

2)      Modify QGIS to not require szip.  Make it an add-on applet, a plug-in, rather than something absolutely mandatory.  Right now, qgis closes at startup if it doesn't see a working szip.dll.

3)      A variant of (2), provide a dummy szip.dll, a "fake", so qgis is happy.

4)      Another variant of (2), preferable to me, switch to permit use of some other, open distribution, zip, like 7zip.  You would lose the SZip Rice lossless functionality, but for a lot of basic bulk unpacking 7zip is fine.

Then can GDAL be disabled, without QGIS breaking completely?  When I tried deleting (renaming actually) szip.dll, qgis errored-out right at startup.

Thanks!

Hi,

When will we decide on the release name? Do we have any material to design  
the splash screen yet? If you have some material that might be suitable,  
please mail it to me.

Best wishes,
Anita

Do we have any tool (including plugins) to digitize curves? I mean
digitize a linestring which will be auto smoothed to spline.

Perhaps you do not understand why szip is included - it is there to be able
to unpack hdf5 files with encoding - this cannot be replaced by 7zip.

Licensing terms
The version of Szip distributed with HDF products is free for
non-commercial use, which may occur in two sets of circumstances:

   - Non-commercial users may use the Szip software integrated with HDF
   products to both encode (compress) and decode (uncompress) data. This
   applies to educational and research applications.
   - Commercial users may use the software to decode any data. Further,
   they may use the software in internal activities that do not involve or
   result in the development of an Szip-based software product.

Commercial licenses are available for commercial users who wish to
distribute an Szip-based software product or engage in commercial uses that
are not allowed above. For further licensing information or to view a copy
of the Szip copyright statement, see Commercial use terms and the copyright
and license notice<http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/Commercial_szip.html>
pertaining
to Szip in HDF products.

---

Also from this page
http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/Commercial_szip.html

Commercial users may use the Szip software integrated with HDF to decode
data and for internal activities that do not involve or result in the
development of an Szip-based software product.


It seems to me that it is OK (without permission) to use szip for 1) any
non-commercial use and 2) commercial use with decoding only.
As I have stated, qgis does no allow to encode any hf5 files with szip
encoding, so any commercial use would also be ok
Now perhaps I do not understand the wording there, as I am not a lawyer.

That might work, I'll check with our licensing people.

The summary is:

-Szip in qgis is there for HDF5
-HDF5 does have a license for distribution of szip.dll with HDF products
-The HDF szip license permits all to use szip.dll for unpacking/decoding of HDF products.
-QGIS only unpacks/decodes HDF5 with szip, it doesn't have any functions implemented to pack/code.

Thanks!

I can't legally use QGIS with SZip, unless there's some kind of license to permit szip.dll distribution with QGIS.  For instance, HDF has permission for anyone, including commercial users (like me, as I work for a company, though we don't directly use QGIS to generate $), to use szip decode functionality.

Possible ways out:

1)       Obtain permission from Joe.Feeley to distribute szip with qgis, same terms as HDF - okay for everyone to use to decode, but commercial users (like me) aren't permitted to use its encode functionality.  That's fine, I can't make new SZip zipfiles, but can get the unpack of them.

2)      Modify QGIS to not require szip.  Make it an add-on applet, a plug-in, rather than something absolutely mandatory.  Right now, qgis closes at startup if it doesn't see a working szip.dll.

What is the problem with distributing the szip.dll ? There is no agreement between qgis (or gdal) with szip/hdf group.

My understanding of the info in this page http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/ is:

- In no circumstances a user can create hdf5 files with szip encoding within qgis. So far, only gtiff files are created within qgis.

- you are correct in stating that commercial products can use szip for decoding only, so it is OK for qgis to distribute the szip library.

- as qgis is not a commercial product and does not allow to create szip-encoded hdf5 files, there is no need for any commercial licence.

- if someone were to write software, based on qgis (and gdal), which sould create an szip-encoded hdf5 file, that entity would require a commercial licence

There is no GPL szip library, AFAIK.

I'd like to use QGIS on a project, but we're stuck on whether/how the szip.dll is licensed for use.

For example HDF specifically has a license page asserting permission to use szip in their distribution, so long as it is used within the context of their overall app.  For a commercial firm, the permission is just to decode, not to encode, but that is fine.

I tried just deleting/renaming the szip.dll, since we do not actually need the functionality for our use, but it appears to be tightly bound to the build - qgis errors-out if it does not detect a proper, functioning, szip.dll on startup.

If there isn't a license statement from the intellectual property owner allowing its use/distribution to decode with qgis, is it possible to include a user-controllable switch to allow not including it, or to perhaps include a true GPL zip package, albeit losing the lossless functionality?

Thanks.

Hi all.
One more thing: it would be useful to be able to define the time interval in
different measure unit (e.g. hours or days), as it will be painful for the users to
calculate the conversions in case of more sparse data.
Should I open a ticket?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Radim
For smoothing lines you can use v.generalize tool from GRASS GIS or
Generalizer plugin (which is based on v.generalizer).

Hi list, 


I have a plugin where I choose a layer from a comboBox. 


How can I get the layer path and directory name in the code? 


For example, in order to get the layer name and use it in the code, I use: 



layer_name = ftools_utils.getVectorLayerByName(self.comboBox.currentText()) 


Is there something to get the layer path and directory name? 


Thanks.

Hi all.
We just decided to invest a substantial part of your donations and sponsoring funds
to hire two core developers and iron out as many issues as possible, in order to have
yet another successful release (2.2, due next 21 February).
Thanks to all who have contributed. I'm sure this will motivate even more donors and
sponsor to contribute: your input will have a definite impact in improving this and
further releases.
All the best, and Happy QGISsing.

Message-ID: <52F0F698.2060505@gmail.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,
I would like to discuss purpose and content of a GetProjectSettings request.

- From the name of this request, it seems that it should return some project
settings values. I would expect response where I will find similar information
like it is saved in QGIS project file. In reality it returns only little bit
extended GetCapabilities response.

My questions are:
1. Could it be renamed to something more suitable like GetCapabilitiesExtended ?

2. Would it be acceptable to write some new request which will really return
all possible project configurations ? Would you accept such patch ? If yes,
can we make some proposal of request name and it's content ?


PS: GIS.lab WebGIS application [1] is automatically detecting content and
configuration of QGIS project using GetCapabilities request and creates web
application based on these values. Thus, no configuration is needed to create
web client for any QGIS project.
We would be happy to extend it's features, if we would be able to load more
informations from such request.

Hi Ivan

The idea of the GetProjectSettings is that the output is easily 
extendeable (because it is a non-standard method). So if there is some 
project information you think is usefull for your webclient, just add it 
to the code and I'm happy to apply pull requests in that respect.
It is not the idea of GetProjectSettings to serve all project 
information, rather to extend on-demand.

Regards,
Marco

Marco, thanks for your answer.
I think it could be very useful for many clients building on top of QGIS
Server to have such informations:

My quick proposal is to add:

Layer properties:
 * layer type
 * geometry type
 * source geometry SRID
 * primary key
 * layer transparency
 * layers group membership

and for Project:
* project title
* selection color
* background colors
* project scales
* canvas units
* precision

Do you think it is a good idea to add this informations to that
GetCapabilities-like XML response ?

Ivan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Oracle layers - improving the speed
Message-ID: <CAA-xNcWpwF8p5ravsLqtRAaV-UnWO9dz8e1W5Kn6Y0iHuiM+2g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,
The native Oracle provider has been in QGIS for quite a while (a year?) and
is generally quite good.

However there are still two fundamental issues that we have with it, both
as a result of the fact that Oracle doesn't store accurate spatial metadata:

a) Whenever I "Connect" to the Oracle database, QGIS performs a scan of
every table to get the metadata which can take almost 2 minutes (the
results are cached by Oracle and subsequent "Connects" are faster, but only
for an hour or two). This is using the "Only look in metadata table", "use
estimated table metadata" and "only existing geomtetry types" checkboxes.
See also - http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8689

b) When I add a specific Oracle table, QGIS then performs some checks
against it (I believe trying to find the actual BBOX). This is fine for
small tables, but for large tables it can take several minutes for the
layer to get added - locking up QGIS in the interim - even if "render" is
disabled!
The issue becomes even more problematical when re-opening a project - QGIS
then rescans all of the tables included in the project which can mean a
several minute delay after opening the project.


None of the other GIS-y systems we have have this problem. ArcMap and
MapInfo solve it by having their own metadata tables that we have to
manually maintain :-( . FME solves it by... well I don't know how (not
separate metadata tables).


So my question is - is there any development work that can be done on the
QGIS end to speed either of these things up? Ticket 8689 linked above has a
couple of my thoughts, but I'm sure the list can come up with better
suggestions.


Any thoughts? Particularly item (b). We're willing to consider sponsoring
these particular changes as we're heavy Oracle users, hence me asking. :-)

Thanks,
Jonathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Access labels properties from python?
Message-ID: <1391544461383-5101930.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi there, 
I would like to explore the possibilities to extend EasyCustomLabeling to
handle correctly curved labeling on lines, and maybe also labeling on the
border of polygons. 
My idea is to make PAL engine compute curved labels, get label path and
convert it to a linestring, a sort of label path. 
Is there any way in the python API to access label properties once computed
by PAL? If not, does C++ API allows that? 
Thanks for your hints.
Cheers
R?gis

I've asked the author to add a (free) licence.
One more, this time clearly free:
http://www.mapaction.org/resources/gis-resources.html
Added here: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9495
There may be another similar ticket, but I could not find it.
I think we should really act here: having a rich symbol set will increase our
cartographic capabilities immensely, especially now, that our cartographic tools are
so sophisticated.
All the best.

The renderer context you are accessing is the one that was used
previously for map rendering - for next redraw it will be overwritten.
In general you should not change anything in that context (it would be
better if the context would not be exposed).

The selection color is stored in QgsProject settings, the following
snippet shows how the selection color is read:

  QgsProject* prj = QgsProject::instance();
  int myRed = prj->readNumEntry( "Gui", "/SelectionColorRedPart", 255 );
  int myGreen = prj->readNumEntry( "Gui", "/SelectionColorGreenPart", 255 );
  int myBlue = prj->readNumEntry( "Gui", "/SelectionColorBluePart", 0 );
  int myAlpha = prj->readNumEntry( "Gui", "/SelectionColorAlphaPart", 255 );

... a similar code with "writeEntry" methods will change the selection color.

Martin

Hey guys, I have tried to put this issue on the tracking manager but I have
no account for this.

I think this issue is related to another https://hub.qgis.org/issues/8822,
however, the bugfix applied to close this effect is not suffcient for this
case.

The shapefile is inconsistent , two files "*packed.shp" and *packed.shx"
are created. The error occurs in line:

 OGR_DS_ExecuteSQL (ogrDataSource, sql.constData (), NULL, NULL);


in function "repack" of  "qgsogrprovider.cpp".

And the log was:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Supporting USER CRS's in QGIS Mapserver and QGIS
	Web Client
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=wxmEG5eoX5c83G3X5bn9QyYDJP1Uvy94H2sSRXOw58zg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.
I've been asked to support a customer of us to deploy a map where a custom
CRS has been defined.
After various tests I've identified almost all the issues that arise when
using a user defined CRS.

*QGIS MAPSERVER*
Given that user defined CRS (>100000) are automatically written and read by
QGIS to the user qgis.db database, it would add the possibility for QGIS MS
to use a custom CRS DB. I've been able to do it adding an env variable
(QGIS_CUSTOMCONFIG), similar to the custom config variable to QGIS startup:

QString configPath = getenv( "QGIS_CONFIGPATH" );
QgsApplication qgsapp( argc, argv, getenv( "DISPLAY" ),configPath );

This solves the problem of picking the USER:XXXXXX  CRS, but something else
needs to be done (I'm debugging to catch the point).
Before going on I would like to ask (Marco?) if it's something you would
incorporate in QGIS MS, and if you already know what should be done how
much would it take to do it.

*QWC*
The "EPSG" string should be set in a variable. In this way a different
authid could be set, e.g. "USER". Otherwise the requests to the server will
always be with an EPSG CRS.

What do you think about these improvements? Do they fit in both the
softwares?
I think yes. This way planetary maps could be deployed too ;)

Have a good day,
Giovanni

The label information available, after labeling is completed, is stored in
QgsLabelPostion, used by the interactive labeling tools [0]. These are
retrieved from a search tree via
QgsLabelingEngineInterface's::labelsAtPosition(QgsPoint) and
::labelsWithinRect (QgsRectangle) [1]. All of that should already have
bindings.

QgsLabelPostion has limited label component info, only the minimum needed
for working with the interactive tools, e.g. just a bounding rectangle and
corner points for geometries.

However, there are several outstanding bugs (and the advent of labeling
styles) that could benefit from a new full label class that maintains as
much information about the label *before* sending only the needed bits to
PAL.  The label class properties would be resolved as needed to reduce
overhead. This also means that if the registered label classes persist
during PAL registration and solution, and rendering, then any new
properties calculated along the way can be appended.

The stored result, accessed like QgsLabelPostion, could possibly contain
all initial settings and resolved properties, as well as any geometries
calculated during rendering, i.e. the "label path" you were referring to.
It also means that additional lightweight geometries can be stored within
it, like a data defined destination point for leader (call out) lines.

I have taken the next week off from my job to work solely on labeling
issues. I'm pretty sure I will not have enough time to do such a large
refactoring before the release, since squashing as many bugs as possible
and finishing a full unit test suite should come first.

Hi,
QGIS already has access to tons of generalisation options via the grass
v.generalise tool

http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/v.generalize.html

Split into four categeories - Generalisation, Smoothing, Displacement,
Network Generalisation.

Is there a reason those can't be used? I wonder how many implementations of
Douglas Peucker QGIS already has? Re-implementing other ones when they
already exist doesn't seem optimal. Of course maybe you want a new one, but
then I'd suggest maybe it could be added to Grass and that in turn would
automatically feed into QGIS.

Cheers,
Jonathan

you're probably right, but I have never advised to develop a new
simplification algorithm :-)

I am a "mathematical" as a hobby, I have only met a "little problem"
with the RDP algorithm and I reported it, and I had fun writing an
algorithm for fun but no idea of proposing developments in this
direction;

some of that interesting reading.

Message-ID: <CAFO80_oB9itm_71eFvYzGrx9si2p55QBKPq5vvhRxGvYSL6A_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm developing a new feature to save SLD and ui in Spatialite provider in
the same way this function is available for postgres.

this function developed for Faunalia is funded by ARPA Piemonte
fork is available at:
https://github.com/luipir/QGIS/tree/spatialite-savestyle
and actual modification are localized in this
commit: f058bea1fe51116b8231eb5c1ca4faee485c38b2

there are some question about how to develop it and are related how to
manage XML in a sqlite/spatialite table.

this code derive by the postgres provider code where QML and UI xmls are
recorded in a XML column. XML is a postgres type. This type is not
available in SQlite but it's available in SL 4.1> (called XmlBlob [1])
In this preliminary commit XML is saved in a text column, but saving XML as
a blog (blob type in sqlite or XmlBlob in SL) have the advantage to avoid
all encoding problems.

so the question is... sqlite blob or spatialite xmlbob?

Blob type can't allow XML parsing using SQL queries
XmlBlob allows this (using libxml2)

Blob type is sqlite native type
XmlBlob can be used only with SL 4.1>

My preference is to use native data type Blob. What's you opinion about
blob/ xmlblob or whatever

Luigi Pirelli (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it - luipir at gmail.com)

I have contributed spline digitizing to CadTools and in the end I have
also made a standalone plugin "Spline".

BTW, it seems to me that Hermite smoothing in Generalizer plugin is
using wrong tangent for the last edge.

I think it would be very handy for users and devs who provide support to
the public to have a handful of short and semantic sub-domain perma-links
to such changeable URLs, e.g.:

issues.qgis.org  <-- goes to issue tracker
py.qgis.org  <-- goes to cookbook in the docs
... and so on

We already have (off the top of my head):
docs.qgis.org  <-- resolves nicely, like above should
plugins.qgis.org

Then, if in the future the resolved URL changes, the perm-link remains
valid in places like gis.stackexchange.com, etc.

Regards,

Larry

Saving style as spatialite files would probably cause a significant file
size overhead - don't all spatialite files take at least 3MB for the SRS
tables?

The 3MB size is the size of an empty DB spatialite .
A DB emty is 3MB size .

A DBspatialite with 1 single dataset of 10MB is

3MB +10MB = 13MB.

A DBspatialite with 3 dataset everyone of 10MB is

3MB + 10MB +10MB + 10MB = 33MB.

Also, AFAIK the goal of Luigi is storing in the spatialite the SLD 
finalized to rendering the same dataset stored in the spatialite,
not to store SLD for general usage.

Regards,

Andrea.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multilayer PDF ?
Message-ID: <52F38D16.9030408@oslandia.com>

Hi,

I am investigating how multilayer PDF export could be handled through QGIS.
This is a feature of the PDF format (called Optional Content Groups)
that would allow to keep "layered" representation of a GIS map when
exported to a PDF.

Something similar has been recently done with the SVG format (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1092)

As far as I know :
- QPrinter/QPainter is not able to deal with this concept of layer
- OGR/GDAL has a driver for Geospatial PDF writing that does support
multi layers, but has a very limited support for styling, so it would
require to rasterize each layer and put them into the PDF
- only a few third-party PDF libraries support writing and OCG, probably
poppler is the best option.

Does anyone see other easier options ?
Thanks !

What about generating individual PDF outputs for each 'layer' (i.e. a layer
or group of layers in layer legend) first, then combining them into a PDF
as layers?

This is totally untested, but when using GDAL to generate a geospatial,
layered PDF, could the individual 'layer' PDF outputs be piped back into
GDAL as DATASOURCEs for individual layers? There seems to be a set order
for generating the layers, e.g. raster on bottom with vector layers over
top, instead of random instertion, e.g. raster on bottom, then vector, then
raster. You might want to ask Mr. Warmerdam about how flexible the PDF
layer writing process is, and whether external PDF content can be streamed
through to layered output (instead of having any geometries read and
styled). There is the EXTRA_STREAM=content creation option, but I don't
know if it can be used multiple times to insert external PDFs as layers.

Also, I think the blending modes of individual layers/groups would have to
be migrated to PDF-specific (Postcript?) definitions, since each will be
rendered separately. Surely standard blending modes for layers can be
defined in PDFs (?).

I think this is a *very* important export feature to add to QGIS, and will
ultimately help with its adoption in enterprise, institutional and
government settings, since such an output fulfills many mandates for
publicly releasing a functional representation of data.

Regards,

Larry

Message-ID: <52F3F5DA.5000102@duif.net>

Hi devs,

python iface has a method addToolBar, to add a toolbar with buttons.
But there is no way to remove the toolbar.

I've created a toolbar, with proper unload function. So disabling the
plugin removes all from menu's, but I cannot remove the toolbar.
Which would be ok, if not a second one pops up when you enable the
plugin again.

Created an issue for it: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9504

Would this be a bug or a feature ( :-)

Richard Duivenvoorde

I have a toolbar in a plugin too.
I can remove the toolbar using:
del self.toolBar

Ok, try :-)

Also did api.qgis.org

Not sure if I choose the best deep link pages, eg issues.qgis.org is a
direct link to hub, but we could also link to the explanation pages in
the docs (
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#tickets ).

Hello all,

I just updated QGIS-dev for 32 bit OSGEO4W and it crashed on startup.
Attached is a "Entry Point Not Error" dialog box that mentions "?
RefreshSymbol at QgsComposerShape@@QAEXXZ"

Thanks!

http://py.qgis.org <-- works great!

http://issues.qgis.org <-- should probably go to (?):
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#bugs-features-and-issues

http://api.qgis.org <-- this fails to resolve (extra '/html' in url?, and
still keeps api.qgis.org domain)
should probably just go straight to http://qgis.org/api/ ? (Which is not
much of a difference, but I think still better.)

My 2 cents-worth.

Regards,

Larry

Hi all.
1. do we have good ideas here?
2. do we want to participate independently, or under osgeo umbrella?
I think it would be bad to miss this opportunity.
All the best.

-------- Messaggio originale --------
Hello all, and sorry for cross posting,

this year, Google Summer of Code starts earlier than usual: the
applications for mentoring organisations are already open, and will
close on February 14th.

For who is new to Summer of Code, it is a global program that offers
students stipends to write code for open source projects. See more at
http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014

OSGeo is going to apply for GSoC 2014, and the first task is to set up
Ideas pages for all projects, before February, 14th. It is a little
more than a week!

The Ideas page is being built here, and shall contain links to all
the geospatial projects involved:
http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2014_Ideas
The links from past year are commented in the wiki page. If you have
trouble editing the wiki let me or Hamish know.

I encourage developers, teachers and students to start working on ideas
for GSoC and populate the Ideas pages of the related project.
Please forward this mail, or the link to OSGeo GSoC wiki pages, to all
the interested people and projects.

If you have questions, please send a mail to the dedicated mailing list
soc at lists.osgeo.org .

Thanks everyone in advance for your contribution to the Ideas pages -
let's do our best to get OSGeo accepted in GSoC 2014!

http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2014

Best regards,

Anne and Hamish
OSGeo GSoC Admins

The code to generate multi-layered svg can be used for that. What the 
code does is to hide all/show one composer items or map layer at a time 
and render it to a stream, the stream is then post-process (in case of 
svg it's an xml structure) to create the final output.

It would be a nice refactoring to have the same (templated?) function to 
do both.

Hmmm, that could also work :)

Thanks for this. I have to dig deeper GDAL's PDF writing capabilities,
but it seems promising.

That would not be that easy to correctly support blending modes. There
is something in the PDF reference related to standard blending modes,
but I have no idea yet how it could be linked to layers ...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] inconsistency of new "fill ring" icon
Message-ID: <52F4A368.6030709@gmail.com>

Hi,

I have noticed that the new icon for fill ring was not really consistent 
with the rest (no new part, polygon was not fully drawn).

I took the opportunity to transform digitizing icons to SVG to be 
consistent with the previous work on layer icons.

Here is the pull request
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1146

Please comment.

Cheers,

Denis

Hi, 
qgis is still very weak concerning pure cartographic uses cases with size
varying symbols, and have no working legend for this, and more generally for
all data defined symbology. 
I've already shared my ideas with Martin Dobias who seems to have legend
refactoring in mind. 

Since this is critic for a cartographic tool, and since data defined
symbologies can't be guessed before real data is rendered, we have something
that needs some deep investigations. 

Putting this in a developpement contract seems dangerous in such early
stage. It be could either be a topic for the next hackfest, or a GsoC. 

Martin, any opinion on this? Others?

Cheers
R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Styling OSM data
Message-ID: <52F4DE50.7090808@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I think an automatic styling of freshly downloaded OSM data would be a
big plus for QGIS, especially for courses (I do a lot of them all
around, and it is always painful to customize them, and embarrassing to
reuse data from my region).
I know of two approaches to the problem:
* https://github.com/3liz/osm-in-qgis
* Mayeul work e.g. on http://www.outdoormaps.org/simple_map.htm
I think with a minimal effort we could incorporate that in QGIS:
* the user downloads the data from OSM and loads them into spatialite,
with the new tool
* he adds the styles (please note we have implemented a way to
automatically store and load from spatialite).
Could we smooth out the path for this, and add the above mentioned
styles as default ones for QGIS?
Could we document this as an early entry for the course material under
preparation?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi all,

Thanks Paolo for openining this topic. I would like to add some context
around it.

* Anita has also a great repository to style OSM data :
https://github.com/anitagraser/QGIS-resources/

* The work I did in osm-in-qgis repo is based on OSM data from Geofabrik
(on purpose, to facilitate the use for users). The styles in this repo are
a proof of concept and really need improvements (and simplification when
possible).
A quick link to see what it looks like :
http://demo.lizmap.3liz.com/index.php/view/map/?repository=rep2&project=baselayer

I agree with you that we should now base this kind of wokr on the "new" osm
importer in QGIS. This could be a 4th step (1- download OSM data, 2- put
them in a sqlite db , 3-extract some data into tables). We could think of a
way to store more than one style and let the user choose one among those
available. A little bit like the "Color Ramp Manager" let the user download
and update color palettes.

Michael

so, lots of duplication, and suboptimal solutions: there is scope for

we have implemented this, see our Save style for PostgreSQL, now ported

Hi all.
Compiling current master throws an error here. A local problem, or is someone confirming?
Any hint will be appreciated.
Thanks.

It fails for me too, but not sure it's the same error
( your log doesn't contain the error line )

Here's my error:

freeze? It will result in a ui change but given that it's just
removing a control there's no risk of introducing bugs.

It means that iface.getFeatureForm(layer, f) returned None, that
should not usually happen.

Can you try to select a vector layer and run from python shell:

layer = iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
f = QgsFeature(layer.pendingFields())
dlg = iface.getFeatureForm(layer, f)
dlg.exec_()

That's to determine the geometry types and srids used in the tables.

That the available metadata tables in Oracle are somewhat optional and you
can't safely assume much about them is really unfortunate.

We could do another metadata table that stores the outcome of those queries in
the database.  That would require the user to have INSERT/UPDATE on that table
and/or CREATE TABLE rights.

We could also do a local user cache.  That would have the advantaage that it
could be used for any database.

The extent could also be added to that cache.  But for this the extent could
also be added as cachedExtent to the data source uri.  Parameters for srid and
(geometry)type are already there and I just changed the postgres provider to
depend on those without verifying them. Extent would be the next natural
candidate and possibly speed up the loading of projects even more.

But those are features which will have to wait until after the release.

Hi

There is also the service we provide at http://osm.linfiniti.com -
currently they are integrated into the inasafe plugin. The tool lets you
get buildings and roads (I plan to add support for more features in the
future) and applies default styles. It also does some server side
processing to tidy up the data a bit. Unlike geofabric, the osm data is
processed on the fly and returned immediately - although this means there
are limits to how large an area you can fetch.

http://test.inasafe.org/en/user-docs/application-help/openstreetmap_downloader.html


Personally I would like a solution that uses our existing OSM downloader
(in Vector menu) and styles the data client side after it is retrieved. We
could probably port some of the logic from our osm reporter app too.

Regards

Tim

we have implemented this, see our Save style for PostgreSQL, now ported

Message-ID: <DUB122-W240D2BC2891A8C61F16BACEE900@phx.gbl>

Hello

I am working on a QGIS Plugin with a touch-optimized GUI. So it is actually very useful to be able to create custom feature forms. However if I use the Identify tool and there are two or more features near together, QGIS does not show my feature form but a "Identify Results" window containing all the features nearby. So my question is: Is there a possibility to create a custom "Identify Results" window with Python if there are several features? Or is there a setting to change its behavior? Thank you very much for your help.

Hi Josua,

I don't think the possibility is available OOTB yet, but it should be 
straightforward to create your own maptool which inherits from the 
identify maptool and uses a QgsDualView with a request (or filter) 
limiting the available features to only the relevant feature ids. This 
should get you a list of all features and their form when selected.

Would be nice to be see this in core as well in the future.

Best
Matthias

Hi J?rgen,
  Thinking about it, the simplest solution is to just trust
MDSYS.USER_SDO_GEOM_METADATA and get everything from that where possible -
SRID and BBOX. The geometry-type it doesn't have, but is that strictly
necessary for the list?

This seems like the optimal solution for us; I'd suggest adding the
functionality behind the current "Use estimated table metadata" and/or
"only look in meta data table" checkboxes. In fact I expected "only look in
meta data table" to already do this.

I realise that this can be dangerous as Oracle doesn't keep it up to date,
however we do a good job of keeping it up to date ourselves (because if we
don't, ArcMap starts doing silly things). I'm sure other organisations are
similarly good at keeping their metadata up to date and could benefit too.

Does that seem like a plausible solution? A local-cache could build on that
I guess (store geometry types from pre-accessed tables?)
Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi,

Also, I don't know if you know the "Layer selection" mode for 
identification.
When you identify in the map, you have a contextual menu which let you 
choose which layer will be identified. Though it solves this problem 
only if the features identified were not in the same layer,

Cheers,

Denis

Hello Denis

Thanks, that's a good point. However I have several layers and in each layer several features to be identified.

Rouzaud (2013) has a done this and published an example of a custom 
identification map tool:
http://3nids.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/identify-feature-on-map/

Btw: The solution I proposed is only able to work with features on a 
single layer. For multiple layer you would have to implement your own 
dialog.

Message-ID: <52F8E7FB.1040408@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I get a crash on a windows machine with a plugin. It is strange as it 
seems it does not occur on every machine.
I would like to investigate, but I don't know what info I can get.

Is there a way to know where the crash occurs without any IDE?

PS: I don't get the warning saying there is a minidump. QGIS just blanks 
out.

Thanks,
Denis

As you say there is no minidump question: If the process is still 
running I think you can right click in the task manager and choose 
something like "create dump" or similar. You could also install 
debugview to see the last debug messages.

Thanks Matthias.

Weird, but the debug messages did not lead to anything special.
I will try with the dump, but it seems to be a PIA to be abble to 
install the tools to view these dumps...

Thanks again!
Cheers,

There's always an extent, but that not necessarily reflect an actual bbox, but
just sets the available bounds, which are often set much bigger than the actual
data.  But the bounding box is determined after insertion of the layer anyway.
To insert the layer we just need tablename, column, type and srid - and that's
what the thread searches for.

An additional idea would be to use the filters upfront.  Currently you can only
filter the result of the layer search after the search has already been run.
Instead we could reduce the searches we want by just looking for tables with
given (partial) name, in a given schema, srid and/or geometry type.  Especially
in cases where the search is expensive, because there are loads of tables, this
is would even be useful if performance wasn't an issue.

And that would also be interesting for all other database providers.

You can open the dump with any visual studio, but to make use of it, 
you will need the some files (.pdb?) produced for the particular build 
which is crashing on the machine. I am not sure if these files are 
available for the nightlies (J?rgen?) but I guess it would be the 
easiest thing to compile it on your dev machine, reproduce on the other 
machine with your build and then analyze the dump on your dev-machine 
again.

Or you just revert to simple printf debugging in your plugin and narrow 
down the point of failure with some log messages 
(http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html).

Fair point, but for us it's definitely still preferable over having QGIS
"hang" for several minutes waiting for Oracle to perform a MBR check on a
table with millions of features.

How about doing the search for "type" when the layer is actually added to
QGIS? It could also confirm the other stuff (which it got from metadata) at
that time too.

Hi All

You may be interested in the QGIS podcast that we (Nathan Woodrow and
myself) started.

http://qgispodcast.libsyn.com/

You can subscribe with your feedreader at

http://qgispodcast.libsyn.com/rss

It would be great to have more representation from the diverse users and
developers of QGIS on the show. If any of you out there are using QGIS in
an interesting way and would like to appear on a future episode, pop me a
note at podcast at qgis.org.

Regards

Tim Sutton

Hi Tim,

I created podcast.qgis.org pointing to the libsyn page.

Currently I create a config for every subhost, have to find out how to
do this more efficient...

Is there an advantage to host it there? Or should we move the mp3 to
somewhere on qgis2 server?

Regards,

Richard

Ah cool thanks! Maybe its better to use a CNAME record so it doesnt

For now that is fine - when I get the time I will build a proper page (in

Yes they syndicate it for you to various services and have local mirrors
load balancing etc. so if we ever get popular it will cope with the
download demand :-)

Hi,

not sure if others can, but for me the image is not clear enough to see
what it is exactly that you want.

Can you describe it a little more?

Technically (almost) everything is possible either via python or else
via a cpp plugin. But depending on your python/cpp skills a plugin with
a set of dialogs doing things in the database is maybe a little
ambitious for your first plugin.

Maybe the functionality you want is already partly available in QGIS itself?

As said, plz provide more details, and describe what exactly you miss in
QGIS for which you have to write the plugin.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Well, too be honest, I do not think that is possible via email and
without the code.

Best is to have a look at the python documentation of QGIS:

 http://py.qgis.org

You can use the python code from existing plugins to have a look at how
you can structure your plugins.

You are talking about an existing plugin which is not working anymore
because of the api change in QGIS 2.0. I think it would be be better,
and less work to upgrade that plugin.
You can email the original author to do it for you, or use these pages:

 http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20
 http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Plugin_Compatibility

to determine what has to be changed.

If you put the code in Github, you can ask other developers here to have
a look into it.

Hope this is helpful enough.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Alex,
would you be available to coordinate the work on GSoC? I think we need someone to
take care of this (besides individual mentors).
Thanks.

Hi all.
Could this be a GSoC project? Would someone take the lead on this?
All the best.

It could be a GSoC project if we knew what do we want to implement.
Currently we just have a use case in the mind ("generate nice legend
for symbols with data-defined scale"). But we have not yet elaborated
the concept how this would be done. The mentioned use case is probably
not the only scenario where it would be nice to have customized
legend. So we need to think more about other possible use cases (what
to do if there are combinations, e.g. data-defined scale, data-defined
color, data-define rotation, categories) and how the user would define
their requirements. Without a good design, we can end up with a poor
solution that satisfies just the simplest use case, but fails with all
others. I do not feel confident proposing such project without having
a clear idea as that may lead to high risk of failure.

Regards
Martin

Thanks for your lights Martin. 
Is there any way for me to help you go further? From my point of view, I can write user requirements, but hardly help you on a technical implementation. 
Cheers,

Yes, I think there are ways to help. It would be great to gather
various examples of legends that are currently impossible to get with
QGIS (and I do not mean only data-defined scale). That would help us
identify how generic the framework may need to be.

Message-ID: <CAFF9ZhvcFThvnWWTBnJ1zmuWr2BS6toLsH=JfP8Cy2iBsbT6DQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,


a simple question    :)

How to generate the SHP curves  of a DTM layer ,  only inside the current
QGis view,  quickly and faster ?

I tested with Processing >  Grass  > Nviz ...   but nothing appears  (after
10 minutes of waiting... )

Other ideas ?   For example,  the  "gdal_contour"  command  can also take as
input a window ?


Thank you in advance for any info about it

Hello Roberto,

If your DTM raster is in *.bil or *.asc format then you can use LAStools'
las2iso or blast2iso from the LiDAR Processing toolbox. All LAStools have
"native" support for the BIL and ASC formats and convert these rasters
on-the-fly into a point-cloud on a grid.

Hi Hamish,
thanks for this. Please note that we'll be collecting ideas on QGIS at:
https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Google_Summer_of_Code_2014
Should we add the link somewhere?

Hello Martin,


If your DTM raster is in *.bil or *.asc format then you can use LAStools'
> las2iso or blast2iso from the LiDAR Processing toolbox.
>

Ok.  :)

But,  my DTM is a simple GeoTIFF.      :(

Do you know if  gdal  permits  to create  curves from a GeoTIFF  DTM,
clipped  by  a rectangle BBOX ?

Perhaps,  I need to clip my DTM, before, with  the  "gdal_translate"   and
then  send the result to  "gdal_contour" ...

There is no way to do it in a single shot ?   :)

Who knows ?


Thank you

Roberto

Hi Minoru,


look at this example I created:

https://googledrive.com/host/0Bwg_m86uaXY1RDRrVXpnT2JoV2c/index.html

as you can see,  the pink cube near the  "67"  number  have a bug  on the
roof  :(

What can be the reason ?



Ciao

While I have the right to approve plugins, it is currently impossible for  
me to tell from the list of unapproved plugins (47 entries) which ones  
have not been reviewed yet and which ones have been rejected for some  
reason.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi All,

@Gino: we have a 'team' of about 10 devs available which get notified
when a new plugin is to be notified

it's on my todo list to contact all plugin owners which have plugins
there which either are unapproved for a longer time (or only available
for older version of QGIS) OR which have older unapproved versions
besides a approved 'latest' version.

to be continued

Regards,

Richard

Message-ID: <52FA9B1D.8060309@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

tl;dr; can we make an email address: approvers at qgis.org for which an
email can be sent to all approvers?

who can arrange this?


I'm busy weeding the long list of unapproved plugins.

Some of them are so old the I just sent the author an email if it is ok
to remove it.

Other have some older versions unapproved, so I ask to either approve
them or delete these versions.

Others just have been added pretty recently, but miss certain metadata
information and did not get attention from an approver.

I propose to make homepage, repository and tracker mandatory properties
too (at least for approval). So we have to fix this in:

http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/releasing.html#validation
and
http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html#plugin-metadata-table

To these people I want to sent an email, telling them that they have to
fix this before any approver will have a look into them.

To be sure that all approvers are aware of this, AND to be able (for me)
to ask all approvers in one go to please have a look it would be handy
to cc such a mail to 'approvers at qgis.org'.

Agreed? Other ideas?

Richard Duivenvoorde

maybe a mailing list would be better, so we can check the archives.
also, I agree with Alex: a bugtracker category for plugin approval would
be good.

If we enforce Homepage, we also have to pay attention  to the link content:

this is a meaningless example:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QSpatialReport/ (homepage link broken and
even if it were not broken, still unrelated with the plugin since it's the
company homepage)

I think that the plugin home page should be a page about the plugin itself.

There are many others like this that I can't recall now.

right. IMHO a home page is nice to have, but not necessary.
bugtracker, code, and some description are.

OT, but related :)

I would appreciate a field more in Metadata... a maintainer(s) optional
section. It's not strictly necessary because of trac, but a lot of time the
first Author of the plugin is disappeared or can't invest time in the
plugin, but she(he) still receives issues or mails from users.
my 2c

Message-ID: <52FB312A.3060104@gmx.ch>

Hi,

There is a status "resolved" which can be assigned to issues. What is 
its purpose and advantage compared to just "closed" and setting an 
appropriate resolution?

The drawback of it is, that issues with the status "resolved" are still 
considered "open" and turn up with a "status open" filter, although they 
normally are normally no longer of any concern.

I would propose to get rid of this status.

Matthias

Hi all.
1. the file extension is not added automatically
2. the created layer returns an error when trying to load it back in QGIS.
Should I open tickets?
All the best.

Hi !

-1 for making the homepage mandatory...
If it's only to display the plugin's help/readme information, we should
rather have the developpers create some help/readme file for each plugin,
which could be opened directly from within QGIS.
IMO that's much better than a link which opens in the browser, and which
most of the time will be either irrelevant (since no one will spend time to
make a homepage for a plugin), or a quite technical looking github readme
page, which precisely displays a readme.md/txt/html page.

+1 for the tracker and the repository !

On the same topic :

I find the descriptions of the plugins often too synthetic to really know
what a plugin is good for.

I'd say this comes from the fact that descriptions can be on one line long
in the metadata file.

Having the ability to use multiple lines would be much better, and we'd
simply show the first line only in compact views (listings...).

Thanks !

Olivier

Multiline descriptions in the metadata are allowed, newlines are not
converted to BR in the HTML though...

Good to know ! Is it ok to use HTML then ? Does the same apply to the
changelog ? ...

The default metadata.txt file should be more explicit about how to format
the entries... A few days ago I added an "&" in the author fields (since we
were two authors), and the plugin wasn't downloadable anymore (it uploaded
well though).

	object has been deleted
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYqpRwA3Aiu1bDjGtbpQCNDb2OreDsasM+6rGxfFfLudMQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am using rubber band in Python plugin:
  self.rb = QgsRubberBand(self.canvas,  QGis.Polygon)
and on mouse move
  self.rb.addPoint( point, update )

It works well on most systems only for Win7/32bit (QGIS 2.0.1, Python
2.7.4) it was reported that it fails with "RuntimeError: underlying
C/C++ object has been deleted"

I see that ownership of rubber band is passed to map canvas

   QgsRubberBand( QgsMapCanvas* mapCanvas /TransferThis/,
QGis::GeometryType geometryType = QGis::Line );

that is OK, but QgsMapCanvas should not delete QGraphicsItem until it
is destructed.

So how can the QgsRubberBand be deleted before QGIS is closed?

BTW, because true owner of QGraphicsItem is QGraphicsScene, should not
we first mScene->removeItem() (which returns ownership) before item is
deleted in QgsMapCanvas destructor?

Is your map in render mode (not cache)?

Hi Denis,
It was on Cache, switched to Render, no change.
BTW, it seems to interact with the main canvas, preventing the display
of the layer used for Atlas.
Merci.

I don't have any trouble using the preview, no idea where the problem 
comes from.
You don't have any filter set in it?

Concerning the main canvas, there is a bug if you check "hidden coverage 
layer", see #9506. Nyall should fix it for 2.2

When does it report the error - when closing QGIS?

That's the correct approach in Python (IIRC). You can remove the item
in your map tool's deactivate() method.

Hi all,

I am trying to subclass QgsMapCanvasItem in python.

 From the API doc, I read that I should reimplement paint( QPainter * 
painter )
but not paint( QPainter * painter, QStyleOptionGraphicsItem * option, 
QWidget * widget = 0 );

Anyway, when I implement this one, I get this error:

Am I missing something?

Cheers,

Denis

not - in fact, also the menu Atlas setting seems not to do anything.
moreover, the map generation is taking ages - I have rotated element,
could this explain?

Something similar happened to me the first time I tested.
I noticed that I needed to check the "controled by atlas" box in the map
item properties tab (this was not necessary in 2.0.1). After that,
everything worked fine.

Might it's the same problem.

Message-ID: <4D60FEC8-5608-4DD5-8919-231C6B6445BB@hbaspecto.com>

I couldn't figure out what was wrong with loading WFS layers into QGIS, it always worked before, but it wasn't working in my new project.  Turns out I had spaces in the layer names.  QGIS wasn't parsing the layer names right if the layers had spaces in them, it would try to load a different layer than the one I had selected.  

Do spaces in layer names need to be escaped so that they work in the URL?  Should QGIS be escaping them? Or are spaces in layer names just a bad idea overall?

Anyone care to enter this into the bug tracking/issue tracking system?  It would be great if it at least threw an error/warning.

I don't know but I presume when map tool is used, it is called from
QgsMapTool::canvasMoveEvent().

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with my flowTrace plugin using featureAtId
Message-ID: <006401cf281f$7734a5f0$659df1d0$@com>

Hello Everyone,

 

I am trying to fix my plugin to work with Qgis 2.0 but I am running into a
snag because I struggle with Python and OOP.  When I run my code I get an
error, AttributeError: 'QgsVectorDataProvider' object has no attribute
'featureAtId', for this line of code: 

 

provider.featureAtId(selection_list[0], feat).  

 

I have reviewed http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorDataProvider.html and
http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/vector.html

 

How should the above code be modified?

 

Thanks,

 

Ed

Hi Ed,

plz have a look at:

Or more general:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WFS loader should fill in abstract/title or report

Hey, in case anyone is going to work on the WFS loader, please consider another two feature requests or bug reports:

1) A WFS layer does not report it's server-supplied title/abstract or any other useful server-supplied metadata in it's "properties" dialog.  

A WMS layer added to QGIS displays all the server metadata in Properties->Metadata->Properties->Server Properties.   WFS layers, in comparison, only show the Abstract/Title metadata when you are choosing what to load, not once it's loaded.  It should be modified to show the metadata from the server in the properties dialog.

2) Neither WFS or WMS layers populate the Title / Abstract metadata fields from the server-supplied values when loading.

It seems to me that both the WFS loader and the WMS loader should copy the Abstract and Title metadata (at least) from the server to the local QGIS metadata Abstract and Title, as the default values, that the user could modify it after loading if they choose.

Mucho thanks to anyone who takes this on, (someday I should relearn C /C++, but for now my own open-source contributions are limited to Java and python projects?),

This is needed now because more than one map can be atlas controlled (or,
potentially, no maps at all if you just want label items to change between
features). I couldn't think of any better way of exposing this to the user.
Ideas are welcome!

And it is a great add-on to the the atlas.

Maybe make it on by default in all maps? Or at least to the first. map
added.

We should also make it clear the in the users manual.

I have added (ie uncommented) QGIS to the list at:

http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2014_Ideas#OSGeo_Foundation_member_projects

So QGIS is online.


But not many other projects are there yet -- we need all those
ideas pages ready and linked in the next hours/day! It's critical
to our application to become a mentoring org; there is no guarantee
that we will be accepted, only a guarantee that we won't be if our
ideas pages are too thin.

@everyone: Please make the ideas as detailed as possible, and it
helps I think to have those "mentor" or "willing to mentor" listed.
One question Google asks us in our application is how many mentors
we have lined up (please speak up on behalf of your project team).


thanks,
Hamish

Subject: [Qgis-developer] how to use QgsPalLayerSettings class
Message-ID: <52FC3443.8060307@gmail.com>

I'm a newer of qgis

I write a C++ application.
I want to set a layer's label when it smaller than 1.00mm will be not 
visible.

My code is as follows:
void LayerMgr::showLabels(QgsVectorLayer *layer, bool opt)
{
     int index = 0;
     QString attrName = "name";
     QgsPalLayerSettings  labelSetting;
     QgsLabel *layerLabel = layer->label();
     QgsFields field = layer->dataProvider()->fields();

     if (false == opt)
     {
         layer->enableLabels(false);
         return;
     }

     for (index = 0; index < field.size(); index++)
     {
         if (QString(field[index].name()) == attrName)
         {
             break;
         }
     }

     labelSetting.enabled = true;
     labelSetting.fieldName = QString(field[index].name());
     labelSetting.textColor = Qt::black;
     labelSetting.minFeatureSize = 10.0;
     labelSetting.writeToLayer(layer);
     mpMapCanvas->refresh();
}

But it was not usful.Who can help me.
Thank you very much.

Hello all,


as in object,  I need to display the current cursor Z info into the QGis
staus bar.

Of course, I have a DTM layer in QGis list    :)

It just exists something that does something similar ?


Thank you in advance for any info about this.

Hi all,

we already have ideas page for upcoming GSoC. May I ask possible mentors to
add their contacts to this page too or simply send email to soc at lists.osgeo.org
or osgeo-gsoc-mentors at googlegroups.com.

Also I ask ideas authors to extend descriptions of ideas if possible.

To: osgeo-gsoc-mentors at googlegroups.com


Hi all,

a reminder for any projects wishing to participate in OSGeo's Google
Summer of Code 2014: we need your ideas pages up and
fully QA'd ASAP! We submit our org application tomorrow, and it will
be assessed by Google early next week. They've repeatedly stated that
the ideas pages are amongst the most important thing they look at, and
the previous good-stead orgs have been rejected due to slack ideas
pages.

So far we only have links to ideas from GRASS, QGIS, pgRouting, and
PyWPS. Last year we had 13 more projects than that involved, so I
know there are more of you out there! :-)


Also Google wishes to know ahead of time how many mentors we have
lined up to help, so please add mentor names and how-to-contact info
to each idea in your ideas pages where you can, &/or say hello on this
list or the public soc at lists.osgeo.org one.


thanks,
Hamish & the OSGeo GSoC 2014 admin team

ps- any questions just ask: you can find Anne, Dustan, or myself at
various times through the day on IRC at #osgeo-soc (Freenode network)

travelling between Bangkok and Manila while working on a sweet Valentine's
release for LAStools and have lost the overview on which page how to add

Hi Radim,

It seems it is your point that has been deleted, not the rubber band.
Doing "print point" before addPoint crashes.

Cheers,

Denis

Good, thanks and sorry for false pointing to rubber band.

However, do you have any idea where the point may be deleted? The
points are acquired from QgsGeometry.asPolyline() which returns
QVector<QgsPoint>, i.e. list of values. The points are then add to
another list: result.extend( pnts[1:-1] ). Is it wrong? The points get
deleted with original list?

I suppose you need to do a copy of your point in the result of the snapping.

do: point = QgsPoint( result[0].snappedVertex )

otherwise, result get out of scope at the end of the method and your 
point is deleted.

Denis

that was it, thanks. I found it unclear, but I agree it's not easy to
improve this. Perhaps the control should be echoed also in the Atlas tab?

What about having a warning in the setting if you don't have any map 
controlled by atlas?

Or the count of map controlled by atlas?

Ok. Let's decide now and here:

On
http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/releasing.html
put something as

(partly take from http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/: "How to add your
plugin to this repository"):

Approval:

1) your plugin will not be public until it is approved by a set of
community approvers
2) give approvers some time to do this (after 2 weeks just email to...)
3) to approve we check that (checklist):

- does NOT show the orange block with missing metadata anymore in the
plugin details page
- has a very descriptive 'description' in the metadata.txt (which is
seen by users in Plugin manager and on pluging.qgis.org)
- contains no malicious code (?? pointers on how to check for approvers??)
- starts without python errors (aka has some basis error handling)
- has at least minimal documentation how to use/test it (visible from
within the plugin!?)
- provides a minimal data set (or links to) for testing
- has a proper license (???? which one? and info about that??)
- supports english language
- does not duplicate of existing functionality or plugin, unless there
is a very good reason (plz provide this reason in the description or
metadata)

For the first point (orange block) can we standardize on Github? Can we
ask from the average plugin author to put his code on Github? Because
then an author has both an issuetracker and either a README or a wiki.

Then here:

http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html#plugin-metadata-table

AND in the plugin code, make repository a required property, and keep
homepage and tracker optional. BUT that should be enforced in the plugin
repo code then.


Is this clear enough?
Please comment/rewrite in a way that I can copy it into the website.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

There is no choice on the licence a plugin can be distributed under : a python 
import is considered a link, therefore the "import qgis.core" is enough to 
propagate the GPL licence to the plugin.
There may be some other files under different licences though, namely sample 
data, documentation or whatever else is not concerned by the link and GPL 
"contamination".

I'm going to cc in the ux list for their feedback too, since this
seems like the kind of thing that list was made for...

Hi !

I made a quick draft about a potential plugin approval checklist :
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag5xh-UHkkZLdG56V2p4cXRGVkNDb0tYZjhVYjhhcmc&usp=sharing

Please extend it or change it !

1) does it mean that
  point = result[0].snappedVertex
does not make a copy? It only creates Python wrapper object
referencing original C++ QgsSnappingResult.snappedVertex member?

2) If a SIP wrapper class A has a member class B and an instance of A
is created in Python,  B member is referenced and reference to A is
deleted is it the A instance deleted by GC including B (which is still
referenced)?

C++: class A { B b; }
SIP: class A { B b; }
Python:
a = A()
b = a.b
a = None
# garbage collector

a and b were deleted?

I would say yes too. But, I would ask confirmation to people more aware

My understanding is following: with the line "a = None" the reference
count to SIP wrapper of A gets to zero. Because the object is owned by
Python (it was created in Python and the ownership was not transferred
to c++), also the underlying C++ object will be deleted. As far as I
know, "b" will still reference to SIP wrapper of B which in turn
references C++ object that has been deleted in the meanwhile. Using
"b" will may lead to crashes (or just strange behavior). If the class
"B" had a virtual destructor, the SIP wrapper for B (which is subclass
of B) should be at least be notified that the instance is going to be
deleted - so when trying to use "b" again, SIP can at least raise the
exception instead of crashing.

The above is my expectation of what happens, I have not actually tried that.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing Toolbox in QGIS 2.0.1-Dufour does not
	show some toolboxes
Message-ID: <52FCC878.6000807@gmail.com>

Hello all,
I am experimenting some issues with Processing Toolbox in QGIS 2.0.1-Dufour.

Yesterday, I compiled qgis 2.0.1 using the zip version on github [1] 
without problems. However, the Processing Toolbox only displays three 
toolboxes: GeoAlgorithms, Models and Scripts. The rest of them are all 
"active" within the "Processing options" menu but are not shown. This 
happens even though I move "processing" folder from 
$HOME/apps/share/qgis/python/plugins/ (defined by --prefix) into 
$HOME/.qgis2/python/plugins.

I deleted my compiled version and installed qgis from the repositories 
following the instructions given in [2] (ubuntu, precise). QGIS works 
fine and the toolbox behaves in the same way, though.

Does somebody know what is happening here?

Looks like you have the simplified mode enabled, which does not show
providers (SAGA, GRASS, etc), but just one single group with all
algorithms. In the lower part of the toolbox there is a widget to
select the advanced interface. The simplified interface is the default
one in 2.0.1

If you have just compiled it, don't forget to update Processing using
the plugin manager. There is a newer version than the one shipped with
QGIS 2.0, tagged as experimental in the plugin repo.

Hope this helps

What a newbie mistake and what a waste of time! I didn't remember the simplified
and advanced toolbox models. My fault!

> The simplified interface is the default one in 2.0.1

I did not know that. Is the advanced interface the default one in the following
versions? That would explain why I got the advanced toolbox when I compiled from
the repo

I will keep it in mind, thank you. :)

The toggle between simplified and advanced for the Processing interface
seems to confuse people on a regular basis. Beside me I know of two other
people who have said it stole a few hours of their time to figure this one
out ... (-:

No, the default one is the simplified. Maybe there is some issue with
the settings. Once you set the advanced, it should use it even if you
update, since it will take the parameter from the same setting. Maybe
there ha been some cahnge in the setting name and i do not remember
it...not sure

Yes, that's true, but I have no idea how to make this clearer. My idea
is to have the simplified interface by default, so users with no
experience in SAGA/GRASS/etc can use the algorithms and not worry
about seeing things that sound strange to them...but I would like to
avoid confusing more advanced users who want to use the advanced
interface :-)

Cheers

Exactly! Docs and user manuals are for weaks! It is better to expend hours
without resolving anything :P

Ok, now I know what happened. I compiled the repo version some months ago and I
probably changed my set up to display the advanced interface.Then, I kept this
installation apart and completely isolated while I installed 2.0.1 version
yesterday. So, the repo version displays the advanced interface and the 2.0.1
version displays the simplified one.

Hi devs,

GSoC applications period for mentoring organizations will close soon
(about 24 hours).

We already have ideas page [0]. But most ideas have no mentors.
It would be great if developers interested in particular project indicate
that they are available to mentor.

Currently we have only two ideas with possible mentors:
 - LiDAR data support in QGIS (Martin Isenburg)
 - OSM download & style (Paolo Cavallini)

Added myself as a possible mentor - yet to add myself to some project ideas...

I found that a bit surprising, so I did the test, an actually python+sip 
do a pretty good job in ref counting (at least for the mentioned classes 
which are pretty simple)

I Added a dtor to QgsSnappingResult to see when it's called:

    ~QgsSnappingResult(){std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << "\n";}


And the little script:

    from qgis.core import *

    print "try to del r while p is still referencing one of it's members"
    r = QgsSnappingResult()
    p = r.snappedVertex
    del r
    print "it's not deleted yet"
    print "delete the referencing guy"
    del p
    print "it's deleted"

    print "try to del r (i.e. without anyone referencing anything)"
    r = QgsSnappingResult()
    del r
    print "it's deleted"


Result:

    try to del r while p is still referencing one of it's members
    it's not deleted yet
    delete the referencing guy
    QgsSnappingResult::~QgsSnappingResult()
    it's deleted
    try to del r (i.e. without anyone referencing anything)
    QgsSnappingResult::~QgsSnappingResult()
    it's deleted

We have always stated that any issue tracker/code hosting is acceptable.
Including:

github, bitbucket, sourceforge, or hub.qgis.org

We encourage the use of hub.qgis.org for the issue tracker and at least
a clone of a git repo if it's hosted elsewhere.
1. So tickets can all be on hub.qgis where a qgis user is likely to go
anyways
2. So it's possible for the community to easily adopt abandoned plugins,
or combine additional developers from other plugins.

I disagree with the need for a standard as coders should have
flexibility in their choice. I do agree that they should have something
though, hence we offer hosting if they're looking for the simplest option.

Thanks,
Alex

Ya it's a kinda weird default of Redmine. You pointed out the only
difference. It would be best to only have 1 of those.

I added myself as a possible co-mentor for a newly added entry for
implementing the brand-spanking-new GeoPackage [0] support across QGIS. I
am not a student (for a long time now) so I can't offer to do the coding as
part of GSoC.

Anyone looking for a very worthy summer project might consider adopting
this work.

I think my ability to mentor a new provider roll out might be
underwhelming; so, if someone does decide to adopt the work, it would
probably need a co-mentor with more experience in that part of QGIS.

Clear. I'm with you that we do not need a standard for coders.

I want to keep it easy, even for inexperienced coders to create and
publish their plugins.

Myself I started with my plugins sources on hub, but had problems with
that. That is the reason I moved to Github (and the fact that it has a
nice issuetracker etc).

So not forcing to some kind of system. Just enforcing at least a public
code repository + email. And preferably a issuetracker and a webpage.

Agreed?

-1 for forcing people to use a single system. I am happy to make a source
repo mandatory, anyone who touches code should know to do that anyway
however I don't want to force people into a system they don't want/like.  I
prefer github to our own hub so I would not upload a plugin if forced to
change.

Concur on this viewpoint.

On a similar note, I find the most annoying part of plugins to be the lack
of coherent descriptions and missing changelogs. I really *want* to know
what a plugin actually does, and what's changed, before I upgrade it.

IMO such user-oriented documentation should be an ongoing requirement.

Many users are not necessarily going to go to the developer's web site to
figure out what the plugin does; though, that's often what you have to do
now, sometimes to no avail. I still have no idea what many plugins are for,
where they show up in the GUI (if at all) or how to use them once installed.

Regards,

Larry

This reference counting must be a new feature in more recent versions
of SIP: in QGIS with 32-bit OSGeo4W (with SIP 4.12.1) I am getting the
behavior I described earlier, with invalid "snappedVertex" after
deletion of the owning instance. It is also possible to check it with
sys.getrefcount(r) before deleting it - on windows I get 2 (one from
"r" and one for being used in the getrefcount), while on linux (with
SIP 4.15.2) it reports 3 (obviously one more for reference from "p").

Cheers
Martin

Also i tried this:

  lyr.labelPerPart = false;
  lyr.writeToLayer(m_layer);

but it now worked too...What i`m doing wrong?

Hello All,


perhaps there is a problem with PointSamplingTool plugin,  using layers
with different SRS.

In fact, I found all the resulting fields of the output SHP  with NULL .

Somebody test it,  recently ?  Could you help me  ?


Thank you

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Filter on joined tables
Message-ID: <52FDE3BB.4080707@oslandia.com>

Hi,

We are asked to work on subset filtering when a qgis layer has joined
fields.

Currently, the filter feature has been disabled on a layer with joined
fields to circumvent a bug (see http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3858 and
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3857).

What if you want to implement filtering on a table with joined fields ?

Filtering on fields of the primary table would be ok, assuming we find
another way to circumvent the mentioned bug (propose to rename fields
when saving to shapefiles ?).

Filtering on fields from the joined tables (but not he primary) is a bit
more problematic. We could imagine attributes to joins (within the joins
tab of the property dialog) where users could define a where clause on
joined tables. But the joining function would have to be modified in
order for it to reject rows when rows of joined tables are null (correct?).

For filtering on every possible combination of fields, including those
from the primary table and joined tables, the best option would be to
propose a filter expressiion based on QgsExpression. It means filtering
would happen client-side, after data have been fetched from the
different providers. It's convenient, but not very efficient.

Comments, other ideas ? :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Drag and drop field designer crash on joined layer
Message-ID: <52FDE70B.5040506@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi All,
Trying to use the Drag and drop designer to create an feature form for a 
shapefile joined to another shapefile in QGIS.
If I to add a widget coming from the joined Layer to the feature form, 
triggering the view feature form action will crash qgis with signal 11.

any Ideas? is this a bug?

here 2 screenis of what I'm doing

I think there should be a switch in the GUI allowing the user to do
filtering with native query (if supported by provider) or with
QgsExpression (always supported, allows joined attributes in join).
For simple cases the QgsExpression filter could be even translated to
provider's native subset query for greater efficiency.

On a side note, there seems to be currently a lot of new features coming in 
QGIS which look like database features. Join tables, relations, filtering, 
indexing ... 

We should probably take a moment of reflection sometime to think about it from 
a general point of view. We do not want to reimplement a database inside QGIS, 
as we already have an embedded one (SQLite/Spatialite), but we want to keep as 
general as possible in terms of format combinations and features available in 
QGIS.
Some rules for development architecture on this topic would be great to have, 
to avoid code complexity and (potentially bad) reimplementation of existing 
features.

Not that I have a good solution ready, but just to raise the subject for 
discussion. Do not hesitate to start a new thread if you think it is worth it.

If that's the case, you should file a bug report as kml should be supported
everywhere.  Did you install using the osgeo4w or standalone package?

We built QGIS-2.0.1 + all deps for Windows7 x64. And when we checked GDAL, we
found that it was built without exif option. After that we rebuilt GDAL -
and all is ok now.

Probably better to relax this for 2.2, but enforce it after release...

I'm 100% for failing unit tests being a blocker for any release. Since QGIS
is used on many platforms and versions, there does need to be some
reasonable 'cutoff' for how successful across platforms a unit test has to
be, before being consider valid. Minimum of success on recent OS versions
of the major platforms, i.e. Windows, Ubuntu, Mac?

Beyond the platforms I can test on, I would like to know who to contact for
help with other platforms.

** I propose a listing on the wiki of all core developers and any other
developer/tester who cares about unit tests, along with the platforms they
can reasonably test, and whether they are set up to compile on the
platform, or are just relying on nightlies instead.

To me, this is a very important resource, especially for devs new to the
project and trying to do pull requests with unit tests.


Another methodology would be to invest in a bunch of different CI servers
on VMs on OSGeo servers somewhere. Then, a dev could just review all
failures independent of contacting anyone else. That's a large investment
in time and resources, however.

Tim, as testing/quality assurance guy, what are your suggestions?


Regards,

Larry

If all the tests were significant.  That's not currently the case.

All the render tests seem quite fragile.   There are small differences, font
mismatches across platforms and version and even tests that still require old
renderers that we already removed.  I don't see why those should block
releases.  That's my point.

Currently there are a lot of constantly failing tests that make it harder to
see when meaningful tests start to fail.  That kind of ruins the point of
running the tests in the first place.

Don't get me wrong - of course these should either be fixed or removed - and
once that happens, we can define failing tests as blockers.  But this also has
been brought up again and again, but not much action has been taken.

We already have that - didn't I mention that already? ;)

The windows and debian/ubuntu/ubuntugis builds feed their test results into
cdash[1] - since about April 2012.  And your mac builds do to.  So there should
be enough coverage to find tests to fix.  I don't think that that is the
problem.  Lack of time is probably the main reason for the situation and I
doubt that pressure will help with that.

All the composer tests should be passing ok, but there's a lot of
anomaly images due to fonts and platform specific rendering which may
need to be added to actually get them to pass.

The one that worries me is the blend mode tests - they have started
failing recently for some reason. Looking at the generated images it
seems like the actual scale of the output has changed.
Unfortunately(?) I'm leaving for a couple of weeks holiday today and
won't be able to put in any more work on 2.2, or to investigate what's
caused this test to start failing.

Agreed. Although, I'm not sure how any valid test that is failing could be
classified as un-meaningful. It either tests something that needs tested or
not, yes? Or, are you saying there are too many corner cases included?

Maybe there could be a 'main' test suite (that always has to pass 100% for
major platforms before a release) and an 'extended' suite for testing less
common use cases? Should be doable for indivudal Python tests using skip
decorators. Not sure how to do it for individual C++ tests.

As far as I know, only Tim has (or did have) a continuous integration
server setup, using Jenkins. Otherwise, aren't they all daily/nightly
builds with CDash reports? That's what mine are. I'm not saying that
resource is not enough for reviewing the current master branch. It is very
good and I use it often.

I am suggesting to have official or sponsored CI servers as a preventative
measure. For example, many github accounts have a CI server hooked into
their pull requests. This way, the repo maintainers have a constant check
as to whether the proposed change builds and passes tests *before* the
request is merged.

The same could be done for QGIS's github account (via one of the github
webhooks [0]), building and testing across 3 or more platforms, and
possibly OS versions as well. This way, for example, I could do a pull
request with unit tests and check back later to see if any unit tests have
failed across platforms, including ones I have no access to.

Currently the QGIS github account only offers info on whether the pull
request is merge-able by git.

I'm guessing that maybe about 3 - 6 CI servers would be enough: the 3 major
OSes, with current OS and maybe one older version (e.g. current LTS
version). Anything more than that can fallback on the CDash information
after code is committed.

I would be willing to set up a CI and maintain it for Mac OS X 10.7+, if
there were OSGeo or QGIS resources available for it. That would allow its
continuation, regardless of individual developer(s) financial resources.
Mac OS can only be legally virtualized on Mac hardware, which is a bit of a
financial roadblock.

It was resolved a while ago. It may happen to another person and I want to
leave a note that it must have been a mix up of older libraries causing the
GUI to cause conflicts in QT. I uninstalled the old version of QT and
installed QT 4.7 version. I then reinstalled QGIS and it worked.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] translation: breaking ts file up in parts for
	transifex ?
Message-ID: <530088DB.2090602@duif.net>


Hi Devs & translators,

one plan for the next hackfest is to get the translation of QGIS itself
in to transifex.

We already did some testing, and one of the things that is missed, is
the notion of the context grouping: knowing if you'e in a 'contexthelp'
part or in the 'wmsdialog' part translating. A this moment going to one
of tests, the strings are one huge blob...

https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/apptest/viewstrings/#nl

I asked a question in the forum of transifex about this:

http://support.transifex.com/customer/portal/questions/5456317-can-tx-separate-contexts-from-ts-files-as-separate-resources

Their conclusion was: split up the ts file into parts.

My question to devs/community: should or can we do this?
My feeling is that it adds complexity==problems to it.

Or do we have other options or ideas?

Plz input.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

I think splitting will increase complexity both for devs and translators.
Also IMO we still have number of unsolved problems with Transifex:
 - irregular updates (now github and Transifex not in sync)
 - losing old string versions when offline workflow used
 - it is impossible to detect changes when offline workflow used, so
   one should check every file for updates.

So, -1 from me to put GUI translation to Transifex.

Also when using QtLinguist translator can see dialog UI, check how
translated string will look and change it if necessary (e.g. if string too
long).

Hi,

I'm translator for Finnish language.
Maybe this issue relates more to devs than to translators due this 
replied email is not published in translators email list !

I think that splitting the whole file into modules is wise idea. At the 
moment when you translate by using Qt Linguist the module name might 
give some hints where in actual program to look what the original 
English text means. Quite often devs have used slang words which 
non-natives cannot guess without knowing what is happening in program. 
Unfortunately even this checking can be very difficult and time consuming.
If there is some errors or something should be translated in another 
way, it's easier a) to find certain place where the translation is 
situated b) You can guess the context from the name of that module (if 
it's correct).

One note of Transifex is that it might lower the quality of future 
translations ! This is due that none is responsible of the translation 
anymore and there is no common dictionary/vocabulary to help 
translations and keep it in nice "package".

Simultaneously should question how to translate plugins raised. At least 
the most common and those which are in the list of most used in each 
country. At the moment this issue is very important here !

Cheers,
Kari

Hi Richard!

I think the translation files can be split up like taking the name of
the file and just include the translations thats inside this file.
This should definitely be possible somehow .. But that would also mean
we have to put them together again after translation on transifex to
be able to use the file in QGIS (unless it is possible to read a lot
of single files(which would slow down the start procedure anyway I
guess)).

I know that translation would be a lot easier and faster with a lot
more people participating on transifex but I also agree with some
parts that Alex brought up.
It might be possible that the quality will become lower and there is
also my biggest worry about the sync in between transifex and the main
part.

For experienced people it will definitely be easier to stick to the
current workflow so I think nothing is fixed yet and we have a lot of
things to discuss, try out and test at the end of march ..

kind regards
Werner

String cannot be too long; if You cannot translate the string correctly 
it's developers duty to modify/update the dialog structure to make all 
translations possible (that's called democracy). ;)

I can translate string correctly. But you miss some points:
 - in some languages average word length is bigger that in others, as result
   translated string can be much longer than original
 - sometimes original string should be translated in a flexible way, using
   synonyms or even totally rephrased.

There are some other reasons why translated string has bigger length
that original
one. And this is not developers duty, this is translator duty to make
UI consistent
and easy to read.

I've almost single handed translated from so called English language the 
whole QGIS application (and some other applications too), so I think 
I've some experience. The language structure is very different in 
various languages (I've also some knowledge of other languages than 
Finnish ;) ). If You cannot fit translation in too small area then 
translator cannot obey Your order and duties You mentioned. QGIS is 
meant to be a quality software and that means those texts which 
developer has originally written should be used (mostly) but at least 
they should be understandable. To change dialog e.g. using the tools Qt 
provides, it'll take max 3 mins. and I consider that a very limited cost 
compared that if user cannot understand and you have to help him/her 
each time 15 mins. or that we get bad reputation and QGIS will not get 
new users.

I'm not looking any fight here, I'm only looking quality result. These 
issues have been somewhat a problem since gui came into use, for me late 
70's.

Cheers,
Kari

Hi Kari!

You are more than welcome to help correct "not understandable" english
"original" .. Sometimes fixing a bug or getting a function to work ist
just more interesting than thinking about the correct term to use in a
button.
If you find such things .. just post it on the translators mailing
list and I am more than happy to try to fix it in the original
version..
That would be really great ..

kind regards
Werner

Hi Werner,

agreed. I'm not trying to force this to transifex: honestly not.

But I generally believe that we cannot discuss either without trying and
finding out errors and problems.

And asking questions on mailing lists or support forums take time, so my
idea is to do some of this upfront. We cannot force discussion and
implementation to the hackfest I think?

But if nobody is +1 for App in transifex, it's fine for me also.

Then just make a decision for now, and add some clarification in the
website, so we can point to that if someone raises this point (again) on
the mailing lists.

Regards,

Richard

Hi Alexander,

Your first point: "irregular updated of github and transifex": this is
by 'design/choice'. We make the translations in Transifex actually
canonical. We should not even put them in Github, only reason we once
and every while after a build (==pull from transifex) push to github is
to have some backup in case Transifex vanishes from earth.
For Documentation and Website, nobody should get .po files from Github.
If Application would come in Transifex, the same rule: you should NOT go
to Github and get it from there.
At Transifex, you can get the .ts file from their website (and thereby
locking the translation from the website for one day if you want).
You can then use Linguist to offline translate the ts file (you got from
transifex). After Linguist-translating you can upload that .ts file back
to transfex and it will be merged there.

Your second point: yes, you are right. You do not have the old string
stuff, in Linguist then. But Transifex is getting better and better, and
for example if we translate via transifex itself now, you get
Suggestions and History too. But we win and loose some
functionality/options.

Third point: yes, all responsibility is moved to online service then.
But as long as we do a push of the original english file(s) to transifex
every day or so, you can see there?

About your -1: personally I'm pretty neutral in this: I'm happy with
both. Only reason I'm testing and talking about it is because others ask
for it, and it seems pretty successfull for Documentation and Website.

Splitting indeed adds complexity, that is the reason I sent the mail :-)

But maybe PSC can make a stand for this, or we should do some voting in
community?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

This is bad approach for application IHMO (well, actually I think this is bad
approach at all :-) ). Now I can update .ts file and translation in any time,
so translation will always about 100%. If we will use same workflow as used
for Documentation and Website then I'll have lot of untranslated string before
release.

Yes I know about this and this is way I worked: download .po files from
Transifex, translate them using Qt Linguist and upload them back after
translation.

Uhmm, this is a matter of taste. I just logged into my Transifex account
to test file you mentioned and I found that I completely loose in new
Transifex interface. I spend about 10 minutes to find how I can now
download file.

Also translating via Transifex requires internet connection. Unfortunately,
stable connections available not everywhere. For example here internet
sometimes become very slow and unstable. I already loosed translations
for two relatively large sections because of internet failures when translating
via Transifex.

Hello all,

Here goes my 50 cents.

I believe that using transifex will bring more translators, as it's
definitely more straightforward to just register, login and start
translating, than having to mess with download files from git, and push
them back to the repository. In transiflex, if we could share the
glossaries between Documentation, Web and GUI it would also add consistency
to certain translated strings.

But... not being able to preview the GUI dialogs while translating, makes
it difficult to safely translate certain strings that in English can have
several meanings, but that in other languages (my experience is with
Portuguese) must be more explicit. In the website and documentations this
is less troubling since generally strings are in some context.

This means that at least some of the translators will have to keep
downloading the files and edit them using QtLinguist to ensure the quality
of translation.

Why don't you ask the translators ?

As the main translator for QGIS 2.2 Danish, I would give this a -1 until 
convinced otherwise:

  * My current work-flow "just works" by having the source-tree for QGIS
    - including the Danish ts file - on my computer. This is a absolute
    _must_ because the Danish translated strings are mostly longer than
    the original English strings. I have to check the Danish strings in
    the QT based dialogues using the QT linguist program for a large
    percentage of the strings.
  * Moving it to Transifex and splitting it in several parts would just
    complicate my work-flow without any benefits.
  * I suspect that the different translation teams is often the size of
    one person for a version release - removing the benefit of crowd
    sourcing.

What I wanted to say is that there are a bunch of tests that fail because they
are not up to date or fail for other reasons that are not related to actual
bugs in qgis itself. For example render tests, which fail because of fonts or
other differences (eg. removed renderers).  I think that are the majority of
tests that currently fail.

So the tests need work. But that's a known fact and it's not at all new.  Still
not much has been done about it - except talk.

Another thing is that we don't have the concept of actual blockers anymore.  We
release every four months what we have at that point.  Blockers are just
highest priority for bugs.

Not sure if CI would have made a big difference.  We could have fixed the
failing tests with the nightly build reports.

But I think Tim planned to add a jenkins instance to our new server.

We could use travis[1] for that (other OSGeo projects already do). But I think
there is no coverage for OSX and Windows there.

Not sure where to get OSX servers and how much that would cost, but at Hetzner
Windows 2012 R2 Standard Edition costs 25 EUR extra a month (ie. 84 EUR a month
for Windows Server).  But both could probably be integrated with jenkins on the
new servers and also take over the nightly builds.
 
But that also only makes real sense once the tests are fixed (for what we don't
need any of the above).

All of your comments on unit tests make sense to me.

Excellent! Thanks for pointing me in that direction.

This time I looked into Travis, I found they now have OS X support [0], and
it supports the Homebrew project for installing dependencies. This is
*very* good, since they do not offer the new caching feature for Mac, only
Linux [1]. I imagine the caching will be very important for any QGIS Travis
setups, since their build process means starting up a VM then reverting it
after completion, i.e. all dependencies would need to be built or installed
from binary packages.

The caching feature just pulls from an offsite Amazon S3 bucket, which is
what I also use for the Mac nighties. This means I can leverage Homebrew to
produce 'bottles' (binary install packages) and store them in my (or an
OSGeo) bucket. Homebrew will then install all needed dependencies, similar
to how Travis's cache works.

This also means I can fully setup Travis and test its integration on my own
QGIS fork first. I can also set up a script to auto-update my fork from
QGIS/master which will give some metrics, including bandwith usage on my S3
bucket (which is cheap).

Though the available CI environment for OS X is only at version 10.8.5 (not
10.9.1), that is better than nothing at all, considering Travis is free and
most QGIS devs aren't testing on Mac.  :-)

OK, I see your point now. Thanks for explaining it.

Solved, but this way is not good, i think :)

layer->startEditing();
QList<QgsField> fields;
fields.append(QgsField("XCoordinate", QVariant::Double));
layer->addAttribute(QgsField("XCoordinate", QVariant::Double));
fields.append(QgsField("YCoordinate", QVariant::Double));
layer->addAttribute(QgsField("YCoordinate", QVariant::Double));

layer->dataProvider()->addAttributes(fields);
layer->commitChanges();

QgsFeature feat;
QgsFeatureIterator fit = layer->getFeatures();
while(fit.nextFeature(feat)){
	QgsGeometry *geom = feat.geometry();
	if(geom){
		QgsPoint center = geom->boundingBox().center();
		QgsAttributeMap chmap;
		chmap[layer->fieldNameIndex("XCoordinate")] = center.x();
		chmap[layer->fieldNameIndex("YCoordinate")] = center.y();

		QgsChangedAttributesMap map;
		map.insert(feat.id(), chmap);

		layer->dataProvider()->changeAttributeValues(map);
	}
}

One more problem: how to disable rendering too many labels (overlapped
labels) ?

I tried this code:

bool inSets = QgsProject::instance()->readBoolEntry("PAL",
"/ShowingAllLabels");
QgsPalLabeling* mPal =
(QgsPalLabeling*)m_map->mapCanvas()->mapRenderer()->labelingEngine();
mPal->setShowingAllLabels(false);
mPal->willUseLayer(layer);
qDebug() << "IS SHOWING ALL LABELS:" << mPal->isShowingAllLabels() <<
inSets;

It shows me that label overlapping is off, but it is on! What to do?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Case study about aerial photo archive management
 with QGIS at IRPI in Turin, Italy
Message-ID: <20140217095112.6f9bff49@nature.speedport.ip>

Dear Community,

we have a new QGIS case study written by Danilo and Franco Godone.

Franco Research works at the Institute for Geo-hydrological Protection of
Turin (IRPI-CNR) as a specialized technician. 
Danilo is Postdoc grant holder, at Turin University, studying geomatic
contribution in landslide, glacier and, more generally, natural disasters
monitoring.

The case study is about an aerial photo archive management, where they use
QGIS to cope (manage and analyse) with the large amount of aerial imagery
and other data.

You find the whole story here:
http://qgis.org/en/site/about/case_studies/italy_turin.html

Thank you very much Danilo and Franco for your contribution!

Kind Regards
Otto

Hi,
not sure if this helps, bu you can explore EasyCustomLabeling plugin where I
use a lot those options.. check current version 1.1. 

Cheers,

Here you used label_style.qml, there is the string "labeling/displayAll =
false". It is that i needed, but it not worked for me... :(

bool loadedStyle;
m_layer->loadNamedStyle( path_to_style + "/label_style.qml", loadedStyle);

m_layer->setCustomProperty("labeling/fieldName", "" );
m_layer->setCustomProperty("labeling","pal" );
m_layer->setCustomProperty("labeling/fontSize","8" );
m_layer->setCustomProperty("labeling/enabled","true");
m_layer->setCustomProperty("labeling/displayAll", "false");

What is wrong? I am at a loss...

Hello everybody,
I just want to ask if any development towards lidar analysis is in act or has been planned for the future.

I write here because, looking at the mailing lists, this seemed the most appropriate. If I missed the correct place, I apologise.

Many thanks in advance for the good work you're doing,

Mmm. .. 
m_layer->setCustomProperty("labeling/displayAll", "false");  that should
work.

Did you also put data defined properties like this?

m_layer->setCustomProperty("labeling/dataDefined/AlwaysShow",
"1~~0~~~~LblAShow")

Thoses properties overide general placement properties on feature's level... 

I only have experience on PyQT side, maybe you miss something to refresh
that?

I did refreshing... nothing
Also i tried m_layer->setCustomProperty("labeling/dataDefined/AlwaysShow",
"1~~0~~~~LblAShow") - nothing too...

It`s strange, why this not work.  I looked at QGis sources and tried to do
the same - again nothing... I thing there is something little nuance, but i
don`t know what exactly...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Spatialize attribute columns XY oor WKT,
	design choice
Message-ID: <1392635292759-5104209.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
Users here ask us a good reliable way to spatialize data from XY or WKT
columns and I'm wondering what could be the reference architecture to have
it in core. I am aware of Xytools plugins, delimited text import and
RTQspider plugin, and also of VRT GDAL format. Questions here are for 2.3
branch or later. 

Here are the functionnal requirements:
 
- The action MUST allow to spatialize XY columns (cartesian or DMS units)
from ANY OPENED data source attribute fields. 
- the action MUST be referenced in vector menu, AND in vector layer's
contextual menu. 
- Geometry and attributes MUST be in sync with origin data source.  
- Spatialized data source SHOULD be correctly imported or linked in another
project (embed project, import project plugin).
- Geometry MUST not be editable to avoid conflicts with attribute or
geometric editions. User should then save as a real spatial data source to
edit geometries.
- the user MUST be able to declare attribute field's SRS so that
reprojection handles correctly. 
- the user should be able to spatialize only a selection or a feature subset
(not sure about it)
- refresh of data should work even if no additionnal plugin is loaded
(dangerous for user experience).
- attributes index and spatial index should be generated in memory. 

quite simple, but no plugin does satisfy all use cases. We have either
replication of data, or direct access only for some specific data sources
(csv, xls, ods.. )

Mapinfo does it but geometry is static and must be refeshed by calling the
action another time. Mapinfo can use sub selections. 
Arcmap only refreshes content on project reload. Grouped with  linear
referening event actions in UI. Not editable

Any opinions on the best implementation architecture? 

As i'm only developping with python, I have be exploring Memory layers,
plugin layers, but it is still unclear to me if this is possible without
declaring a new virtual provider using attributes from on data source. 

VRT is IMHO no adaptated since it is not dynamic with csv data, GDAL lacks
many options to open correctly csv (text delimiters, decimal delimiters...)
. This is why delimited text exists. It also has no spatial index. 
It still remains extremly powerfull for UNION, spatial queries thanks to SQL
dialect...


I would be glad to here from you, so that I can write some specs and hire a
dev. 

Cheers, 
R?gis

Hi Niccol?.

the state of and the plans for QGIS and LiDAR are summarized in this thread:

my assumption is that plans will get be made during the code sprint in

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS mapserver: Occurrence of <gml:featureMember>
 elements in WMS GetFeatureInfo response in GML format
Message-ID: <CAKeJj6-rQ+mRpsKEUr4ay50qWdQ8EhGDF+R+2a_vZFuzTmemYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

Current implementation of QGIS mapserver generates only one
<gml:featureMember> element for all features of particular layer. For
example, response from GeoServer (
http://demo.opengeo.org/geoserver/wms?LAYERS=topp%3Atasmania_water_bodies&QUERY_LAYERS=topp%3Atasmania_water_bodies&STYLES=&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetFeatureInfo&BBOX=141.5115%2C-43.933%2C150.8015%2C-39.288&FEATURE_COUNT=10&HEIGHT=256&WIDTH=512&FORMAT=application/xml&INFO_FORMAT=application/vnd.ogc.gml&SRS=EPSG%3A4326&X=292&Y=145)
produces
<gml:featureMember> element for every feature. Also parsing response from
QGIS mapserver with OpenLayers (OpenLayers.Format.GML.read method) results
in max. 1 feature per layer, even if XML document clearly contains more
features.

For me, it seems like bug, but I'm no expert on WMS standard, so maybe
there was some good reason to do it this way.


Thanks

Message-ID: <374F2A33A0F46242B3A1F52EB8A1E8B4FB9720C17C@EXCHMBX-V.cg67.fr>


Hi,

I'm working on porting a standalone app from 1.8 to 2.0 API
When iterating over vector features like this:

fields = layer.pendingFields()
  field_names = [field.name() for field in fields]
  for elem in layer.getFeatures():
          atr = dict(zip(field_names, elem.attributes()))

returns this:
{PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'off_set'): <PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant object at 0x05115C70>, PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'code'): <PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant object at 0x05115BC8>, PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'pk'): <PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant object at 0x05115C00>, PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'id'): <PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant object at 0x05115B90>, PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'annee'): <PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant object at 0x05115CA8>, PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'id_anom'): <PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant object at 0x05115B58>, PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'fk_position'): <PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant object at 0x05115C38>, PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'resolu'): <PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant object at 0x05115CE0>}

Instead of tupple like u'off_set': 1 ...

Info here:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/76364/how-to-get-field-names-in-pyqgis-2-0/86751#86751

What is missing to get "good" values?

You have not set SIP api to version 2 to QString, QVariant and other
Qt classes. QGIS python package tries to do that automatically for
you, but if you imported PyQt4 python modules before QGIS python
modules, that will not work. You have two options:
1. move import of QGIS module before PyQt4
2. keep the order of imports as is, but put these lines before import of PyQt4:
import sip
sip.setapi("QString", 2)
sip.setapi("QVariant", 2)


This is only necessary in standalone applications - inside QGIS
application this initialization is done before any plugins are loaded,
so this issue does not come up. Probably in qgis __init__.py there
should be some code checking if there are not Qt classes imported with
API v1 - in such case we could throw an exception.

Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster resampling suggestion
Message-ID: <4E74B118-372F-475A-861E-26A79571BFFC@gmail.com>

Hey,

I've been using qgis and have been pretty impressed with it so far.  I would however like to offer a suggestion for improvement of the raster resampling.

Right now, it appears the resampling is done on the final RGBA output, rather than on the data values.  Further, there are issues with both negative kernel lobe artifacts from the cubic convolution kernel and NODATA interpolation artifacts from the bilinear resampling.

My suggestion on how to deal with this is:
1.  Resample the data values, not the RGBA output
2.  To remove the NODATA artifacts, create two rasters while resampling:
2a.  First, create a nearest-neighbor only resampled image from the original.
2b.  Second, before interpolating, use a neighborhood mean that only fills NODATA cells, edge extend, or combination of the two to prevent NODATA interpolation artifacts.  This must be done to a minimum of (kernelExtent - 1.0) cells.  Then, interpolate normally.
3.  Use the NN raster as a mask to gate data values from the resampled image.  ie:  dest[i] = nnMask[i] != NODATA ? cubicResampledSrc[i] : NODATA;  Should be 2-4 cycles per pixel SIMD depending on dual issue.  If the NODATA value is 0, you can just clip everything to either 0 or 1 in the NN raster and do lots of nice memory-aligned vmuls.
3B. If using cubic (or Lanczos), you'll need to integrate or do another clipping pass to make sure the evil negative kernel lobe fairy didn't turn any data into NODATA.
4.  If you're maintaining the alpha channel at this point, I would suggest always using NN to resize it.

I have implemented this myself, and it works quite well, for both bilinear and Lanczos interpolation.  Not terribly creative, it's derived from how the alpha channel in PowerVR textures work.  I did not find the neighborhood mean to significantly distort anything, compared to a very strict bilinear implementation that never interpolated NODATA but rather fell back on NN.

Net results are:
1.  Higher quality interpolation, if the source raster uses a data type with more width than uint8_t.  You can actually zoom in crazy amounts on even bilinear interpolated rasters as long as you're interpolating something like 32-bit floats.
2.  No interpolation into NODATA values.
3.  With bicubic, elimination of negative kernel lobe black ringing artifacts in NODATA areas.  (ringing artifacts will be present to some degree still.  This can mitigated by transforming to the logarithmic domain and back but that's relatively expensive)
4.  Possibly faster performance if you were interpolating 4 channels of RGBA interleaved data which could be done with 2x planar interpolations instead.

If it would help, I can provide source code of a working implementation and release it without copyright, although as this stuff is simple but implementation-dependent, I'm not sure it'd be more useful than the above.  Just pad any NODATA around the data values, interpolate and gate / clip with the 2nd NN raster.

Thanks!

Hi Nick

Resampling on data level does not work in case of colormap rasters, 
therefore the resampling filter currently comes after assigning rgba. 
One possibility would be to provide a user choice if resampling should 
be done on color values or on data.

I think it is best if you post your code (as a pull request on github or 
via mailing list), then others can give it a try and provide feedback. 
I'm not really a raster power user myself (mostly working with rasters 
as background images for maps).

Regards,
Marco

You have not set SIP api to version 2 to QString, QVariant and other Qt classes. QGIS python package tries to do that automatically for you, but if you imported PyQt4 python modules before QGIS python modules, that will not work. You have two options:
1. move import of QGIS module before PyQt4 2. keep the order of imports as is, but put these lines before import of PyQt4:
import sip
sip.setapi("QString", 2)
sip.setapi("QVariant", 2)


This is only necessary in standalone applications - inside QGIS application this initialization is done before any plugins are loaded, so this issue does not come up. Probably in qgis __init__.py there should be some code checking if there are not Qt classes imported with API v1 - in such case we could throw an exception.

I think you need something very close to GDAL's VRT, but supported
natively by QGIS.

It could be (just thinking loud) something like a special
QgsVectorProvider that "wraps" another one (or many other ones) with
options like "pointsFromColumns", WKT field, etc. or with the
possibility to have "computed" columns based on QgsExpression
(geometryFromWKT already exists, we may want to add MakePoint, MakeLine,
etc.)
This provider would not allow edition of computed geometries and would
be responsible of indexes and so on.

I think metadata should be properly handled by QGIS. We are using (and
improving) the metadata plugin by Alex, but the longer term solution
would be to integrate all the metadata in the main properties, as you
suggest.
All the best.

Hi all, has anyone seen this?

if confirmed (it seems so to me) it would be pretty bad. It is not a

Hi all,

thanks to your effort (sponsors, donors and developers) the blockers
list in down to 4 tickets:

one is probably already fixed (9526), another it seems it is being
worked on by Alvaro (9581) and a third one (9060) it is pretty serious
because it causes to have areas (and distances) computed wrong when
otfr is on. I would like to know is someone is going to have a look to
#9060 before the new release because it is a pretty serious issue in
qgis 2.0.1

Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.02.1402181510210.3204@www.localdomain>


The MetaSearch team announces the release of MetaSearch 0.1.0.

The 0.1.0 release marks the initial offering of a CSW client for QGIS 2, with significant features to enable plug and play interoperability with OGC CSW services.

- find and bind functionality allowing users to discover and add layers from WMS, WFS, WCS, or WMTS services dynamically to the map
- template-based service and record metadata view, allowing for custom templating of responses
- visual footprint of CSW results
- display of all metadata access links, allowing users to click/download data to add to QGIS
- spatial and aspatial querying of CSW services

Version 0.1.0 represents a significant engineering effort to bring CSW support for QGIS 2, make the codebase sustainable/extensible and easy for developers and documentation teams to make contributions.  Longer term plans include:

- supporting other catalog APIs (CKAN, etc.)
- making MetaSearch part of QGIS core
- transifex localization
- display thumbnail/browse images

We are looking for feedback and testers for the plugin.  Comments, bugs, features/enhancements are welcome (IRC, GitHub issue tracker, etc.).

The full list of enhancements and bug fixes is available at https://github.com/geopython/MetaSearch/issues?milestone=1&page=1&state=closed

The plugin is available from the QGIS Plugins Repository at http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/MetaSearch

Testers and developers are welcome.

Hey Marco,

Here's the code I have for a bilinear-based implementation (attached),
though I've omitted the actual NN and bilinear resampling code itself for
brevity.  This does have a number of implementation-specific assumptions
which would need to be reworked for the general case.  (the general case in
GIS is hard and makes my brain bleed.)  So it's not really close to the
point of being ready for a pull request.

It could be adapted to work on RGBA output, though with some modifications
mostly involving using the alpha channel with a NN resample in place of the
NODATA values.

It should be all ANSI C with no external dependencies. (except for one
irrelevant Accelerate framework call)

Hope this is useful -- let me know if anything else is needed.

Good news!
There is also http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9324
but it does not seem to me serious enough to really block us.
Any hope to have all 4 fixed within 1.5 days?

Hi,

Recently there was a discussion on IRC between NathanW and EvenR 
concerning SQLite's virtual table [1]
I think this would be a (mighty) generic approach which could also 
serve this use case. I didn't give it much deeper thoughts yet, but I 
must admit it looks promising. Basically you just register a new table 
with SQLite and implement the backend for it. This gives you all the 
SQLite power (where we even have a driver for already) and therefore 
database goodies tailor suited to runtime-generated data.

I also had the idea of creating such tables on the fly for iterators 
spanning multiple tables (for JOIN support in queries. Providing a 
provider-independent highlevel query syntax like expressions). If we do 
this I would like to make sure that we have the possibility to get 
access to the parsed query before it is executed. This is necessary to 
be able to optimize the query for databases for which we have our own 
drivers and which support such operations natively (Think of a join of 
two possibly huge postgres tables: you don't want to join them 
locally). I haven't yet verified if this is possible or not, and can 
therefore not say if this approach fulfils the requirements.

There are python bindings available for virtual tables, so it may be 
possible to implement it this way [2] I think it would be good to 
gather some experience in this direction before implementing it in 
core. I am not even sure how it plays with SpatiaLite.

Best
Matthias

For me this is also a regression from 2.0 but it is down as high priority for future release. This was working fine in 2.0.

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9357

I know it will stop me upgrading to 2.2 for this one script I have.

4 months isn't so long to wait for 2.4 if it can't be fixed for 2.2 I guess :)

Good news!
There is also http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9324 but it does not seem to me serious enough to really block us.
Any hope to have all 4 fixed within 1.5 days?
All the best.

Hello,

I submitted a plugin three weeks ago, but it remains unapproved and
I didn't receive the notification by e-mail, neither. The plugin is called
Viewshed Analysis - currently the last one in the list of unapproved
plugins (http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/unapproved).

In the meanwhile, I created a GitHub repository, set up a QGIS project and
uploaded the plugin for the second time (in order to ease the process) -
still no news... (Yes, I should have done it at the outset ...)

Is it possible to get an information on problems in the plugin
functionality, so that I might get down to fix them ?

Thanks,
Zoran

It's most likely just a backlog of plugins to review. See this thread
for discussion.

There is a good chance that is true. I have always recommended for
analysis one must reproject all data into the same projection. There are
many other tools that won't work in QGIS and other software.

Projection on the fly is really best reserved for exploratory purposes
and cartography (even then sometimes it's better to reproject).

Alex

Hi Tom,

Thank you (and your team) very much for this excellent plugin! Very valuable!

I tested version 0.1.1 (in QGIS 2.0.1 on Win7) and love it already.

Adding WMS/WCS/WFS however does not seem to be active yet, and using the "back" arrows throws an error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\ninsbl/.qgis2/python/plugins\MetaSearch\dialogs\maindialog.py", line 572, in navigate
    if res == QMessageBox.Ok:
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'res' referenced before assignment

Should I file a ticket?

Still the plugin is already very useful and personally I think it should make it to QGIS core in the long run!

So, thanks again,
Stefan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS MetaSearch Catalogue Client 0.1.0 released


The MetaSearch team announces the release of MetaSearch 0.1.0.

The 0.1.0 release marks the initial offering of a CSW client for QGIS 2, with significant features to enable plug and play interoperability with OGC CSW services.

- find and bind functionality allowing users to discover and add layers from WMS, WFS, WCS, or WMTS services dynamically to the map
- template-based service and record metadata view, allowing for custom templating of responses
- visual footprint of CSW results
- display of all metadata access links, allowing users to click/download data to add to QGIS
- spatial and aspatial querying of CSW services

Version 0.1.0 represents a significant engineering effort to bring CSW support for QGIS 2, make the codebase sustainable/extensible and easy for developers and documentation teams to make contributions.  Longer term plans include:

- supporting other catalog APIs (CKAN, etc.)
- making MetaSearch part of QGIS core
- transifex localization
- display thumbnail/browse images

We are looking for feedback and testers for the plugin.  Comments, bugs, features/enhancements are welcome (IRC, GitHub issue tracker, etc.).

The full list of enhancements and bug fixes is available at https://github.com/geopython/MetaSearch/issues?milestone=1&page=1&state=closed

The plugin is available from the QGIS Plugins Repository at http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/MetaSearch

Testers and developers are welcome.

The MetaSearch team.

Platform dependent tests (fonts) don't make sense for me and should be
disabled until get fixed (e.g. using font set shipped with QGIS).
Renderer test should be updated and only real bugs will remain and
those should be blockers, I think.

I have fixed WCS, I'll disable those platform dependent and look at
renderer test. I don't know much (never worked on) about others like
PyQgsDelimitedTextProvider, geometrytest, openstreetmaptest,
PyQgsAppStartup.

Blockers do not block stable release?! I don't think anything like
that was ever explicitly said nor there is a general consensus about
that. I read your release plan again and I only found:

which I did not read as "may be released with blockers". Do you say
that 2.2 may be released with issues marked as blockers?

Hi

I also think more things could be added automatically (bbox for example).
But it would be hard to implement all the metadata needed inside QGIS.
Other tools are dedicated to metadata. In QGIS metatada tab, you can add
the URL to the page giving the metadata in standard format.

There is a tool called "metadator", written in python, which aims to
facilitate the generation of metadata for several layers. This tools could
be great to have as a plugin in QGIS : https://github.com/Guts/Metadator

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Embedded group bug ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7e6CYmAjKAY8GEoYjuM5XUM12j-GROasXMoD+DnsPUCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Yesterday I played a little bit with the feature "Embed layers or groups".
I works well for single layers, but it seems to behave randomly for groups.
For example, embedding a group containing sub-groups and layers does not
produce the right result in my case : the group is imported, but only
contains the sub-group. All the layers from parent project origninally
contained in the group root are imported in the root of the legend in the
child project. Second problem : the layers are imported with reverse order
compared to their order in the parent project.

Espected behaviour :

* imported group
-- * sub-group
---- * layer A
---- * layer B
-- * layer 1
-- * layer 2

Actual "buggy" behaviour :

* layer 2
* layer 1
* imported group
-- * layer B
-- * layer A

And I cannot move the layers 1 and 2 afterwards in the "imported group" as
the embedded groups are read-only.

Has anyone seen this happen ?
I would be happy to report a bug in hub.qgis.org

Michael

Let me add that in case of tests it will most likely not even help to
ship a common font with QGIS: on different platforms the text is
rendered by different libraries (e.g. FreeType on linux, native
backends on windows/mac).

Also, renderer tests should IMHO have some tolerances instead a set of
anomalies. For example, in multi-threading branch some tests started
to fail because of some microscopic differences - this will require
another set of reference images (and anomaly images) although there is
no real difference. This looks like an interesting tool for comparing
images:

One issue I see here is we are mixing unit tests with integration tests.
The tests for QgsExpression are examples of unit tests and should flag a
regression but stuff like rendering tests are more if a integration test
and may or may not flag a regression.

Hi Michael,

It is a known issue and Marco Hugentobler is working on it (hopefully
still in time for 2.2).

BTW: you will not be able to rearrange the order of individual layers if
you embed a whole group - only the group at a whole. But the order
within the embedded group should be correct once the bug is fixed. If
you want to reorder embedded groups or layers you will have to embed
them individually several times.

Hmmm ... sounds very interesting !
Looking for more details, I found this :
https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=VirtualOGR
which is a VirtualTable driver for Spatialite giving access to OGR
sources ...
And Spatialite functions handling spatial indexes can be used on them ...
So we could imagine a VirtualQGIS virtual table driver distributed with
QGIS ...
Cool ! :)

Yes. That could be used for joins as well.
I am not sure how SQLite would handle things if you have two virtual
tables and decide to JOIN them in a query ...

Thanks for pointing this out. I have to think about this further.
I like it. It also enforces the idea that a Spatialite-based format
(GeoPackage?) should be considered as the native layer format for QGIS.

Um... is the mixing of unit and integration tests really an issue? :-)

Some more complex classes are somehow difficult to test in isolation
(e.g. QgsMapRenderer), so their unit test becomes kind of integration
test... but is there anything wrong with it?

Exactly. I just tried only because of the issue. I won't need it if groups
and layers are embedded correctly.

This is what I did to avoid the bug after I discovered it. I recreated a
group and sub groups with individual embeded layers in them. Then I use
QGIS project templates to save this state and create new projects with the
same group.

Hi,

Another question regarding the embeded groups. Is there any way to tell if
a group is an embeded group with python bindings ? For layers, there is the
layerIsEmbeded method of the QgsProject class, but what about groups ?

Cheers

Michael

Hi, 
I just raised a new blocker http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9599. 
It should be easy to solve since all works well but a error message is
raised anyway on startup with QGIS_PLUGINPATH option. 

R?gis

Hi Andreas and Michael

Working on the embedded group bug right now btw.

 >For layers, there is the layerIsEmbeded method of the QgsProject 
class, but what about groups ?

There is no such method for groups, because QgsProject does not know 
anything about groups. Only the legend knows about groups, and there is 
a C++ method QgsLegend::groupEmbedded, but without python bindings in 
the legend interface.


Regards,
Marco

Well, there are platform dependant bugs and therefore there also could be
platform dependant tests.  But those would need to be clearly marked as such
and only run on the corresponding platform.

Do we need to discuss that failing tests - or any other bug - should be fixed?
I doubt that we do.

I'm just objecting to planing ahead too much - let's first fix the tests and
then decide further steps.

Sure, "nothing but talk" was a overstatement.  I'm just saying that we have
just a few tests and some of them are even flawed - and hence to me the current
outcome is too unreliable to let other decisions depend on it.

We just have releases.  The plan is to release what we have on release day.  Of
course that should be in the best possible shape, but whatever we do it will
have known und unknown bugs.

While it's good to have a plan releasing software with regressions is not a
good. Bugs are expected but regressions will drive users away.  Blocking
tickets should only be reserved for regressions and should be fixed before
a release is called, even if the only bugs we fix before the release is
regressions I think it is a smart move.

That is not to say we should hold off the release forever but if we have a
few blocking issues and it only adds a couple of days/weeks, or even maybe
a month, to the final release date, I would rather see that then release
something with major regressions and annoy users.

Exactly, so why to insist exactly on release day planned 3 months ago?

That won't work, we must be forced to fix them.

Whatever we do it will have unknown bugs but does not have to have known bugs.

I am strongly against releasing with known blockers.

Hi

I'm voting for releasing in time as is.
We had that discussion prior to each release before. It turned out that 
after shifting the release date, new must-fix bugs showed up and the 
release was shifted over and over again.
With a fixed release schedule, it is no problem to wait for the next 
release with bugfixes and features, because the next release comes 
within a few months. If releases are delayed, people cannot rely on a 
next release coming after four months.

Regards,
Marco

Yeah it is pretty cool.  That is where I first got the idea from.

My main idea was to have a QGIS implementation of that that can sit on top
of any QGIS layer not just OGR ones.  So instead of having a backend of
OGRFeature and OGRDatasource it would use QgsDataProvider and QgsFeature.

It's pretty cool that there is a Python way to do this, will be good to
prototype something quick then port to C++ for speed.  I might have some
time tomorrow to try my hand at something basic and if it works we can
explore it further.

Agreed. If we decided to do time-based releases, let's do them as
planned and not discuss the decision two days before the planned
release...

I think we should mainly reconsider which bugs should be marked as
blockers. The current policy "every regression is a blocker" does not
make sense to me. In my opinion a blocker is something that makes the
software unusable for potentially large amount of users - in such case
it makes sense to delay the release for few days (as an exception, not
a rule).

Martin

A bit of a problem I see is that there is still no support for plugin 
data providers. Are you thinking about implementing this as a plugin 
layer?

Well it's just SQLIte so the Spatialite provider should handle it fine
because to it it's just a normal database with tables.

I would also like to expose the data provider API to Python but I don't
think we will need it for this.

Done.

BTW, the problem that I could not add WMS / WFS is likely to be on the CSW side and not the client side, cause it worked for some WMS...

I was using the CSW for "official" map data in Norway provided by geonorge:
http://www.geonorge.no/geonetwork/srv/no/csw?

There are several / many WMS listed which cannot be added... Would you mind double checking if this is a server-side problem?

Cheers
Stefan

Hi Stefan: thanks for the info.  This is the dreaded metadata "link types" issue.

If possible, can you open an issue on this so we can discuss this in the ticket?

Thanks

+1 to all this

It will probably take some time for all of us devs to take good habits of 
fixing blockers as soon as possible. It will probably also encourage funders to 
give money to developers to fix them before the release.
At the end, it should be a better solution to keep strict fixed releases, and 
should enforce code quality.
One way to ensure this is to work seriously on tests as well.

Thanks, although I've already discarded my unfinished post after Marco's mail

Right, and that's was going to be my answer to Nathan's mail - discarded too :)

A blocker just needs to be severe - and that's about it.  It doesn't matter to
me if it's a bug in a new feature or a regression.

Hi all.
Long ago I suggested using Debian bug classification, with minor
adjustments:
https://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities
Possibly the first three should be merged.
What's wrong with that?
All the best.

With QGIS permanently broken and always waiting for next release which

But funders already gave money! I believe that they are interested in
stable QGIS in the first place.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing - bug when editing an open model ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO4v=bwQPwHwBiamVC=yuuPrOeF9o=jwuokBUP-6iWoPVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Before reporting a bug, I would like to know if it is not already reported.
I am using QGIS 2.0.3 with Processing plugin experimental version
2.0-20131120 (Ubuntu)

When I create a graphical model from scratch, everything works fine. I can
save the model and run it.

But whenever I try to open an existing model, then modify one of the algo
and apply modifications with the OK button, the interface freezes
completely. I then need to kill QGIS to get out of it which is very bad in
case you have not saved the project...

Has anyone reported this or should I fill a new bug ?

Regards,
Michael

Hey, a last question about this. Would it be hard to add the python binding
for QgsLegend::groupEmbedded ? I could do it and add a PR if someone show
me some example...

Thanks in advance
Michael

I have updated at least single symbol in rendererstest. I was not able
to get exactly the same image with the new renderer so I had to update
control image and remove all anomalies. I have added tolerance for
color components currently set to 15, i.e. about 6%, too much?

Agreed, quite interesting.
Maybe we should set up a wiki page to coordinate all the varuious pieces around
metadata and CSW?
All the best.

BTW, in the meantime we have just 3 open blockers:

* http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9599 has a fix
* http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9526 might be fixed (awaits confirmation)
* http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9324 does not seem really dramatic.

All the best.

Argh, missed to rephrase the message to say "fixes #9599" when I merged it.
Down to two.   And Martin just took over to close the ticket while I was
looking up the SHA...

Any chance https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1063 can be included in the
release? Its an annoying bug with a small, tested fix.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1071 also contains some nice fixes for
#9060 which could be cherry-picked out to avoid the new strings.

I know I'm not in PSC or or core dev here. 
I feel uneasy about that thread, because both options are right from a
certain point of view. 
We strongly need fixed calendar to organize a fluid release workflow. We
also need releases with as few blockers as possible.
 
So, since QGIS is still extremely fast to get new features - thanks to all
of you - I'm afraid blockers solved after the release date, will let some
room to new blockers if we don't put strong quality rules in dev and tests.
I understand Radim when he says all releases will have big blockers then. 

As a funder, my reaction to this would be to go funding a stable branch with
bugfixing releases. But.. we partly choose QGIS because our fundings were
also profiting to all the small NGO's and local authorities we finance to
improve water management.  Then, I need a free public stable release
(financed upstream by funders), and not a paying service.  I can't agree to
have a good software, and pay for it with public funds, and do not afford
small authorities we finance-  to get the same stable software...

To solve that paradox, I'm trying to convince my whole hierarchy (2 levels
done, 2 remaining!) to go for sponsoring. I hope in this way encourage you
to have more resources for tests and bugfixing. 

For 2.0 , I tried to finance bug fixing, but it is almost impossible in
France to do that. We can't hire someone for days of work, we can only do it
for a clearly predefined work). 

Having planned release dates will also help me have someone do standard real
use cases with prerelease versions once feature freeze is started. It
remains difficult to me since users don't like testing and reporting yet
here, I feel a bit alone doing that. I'm pretty convinced this is a cultural
change and some power users could help, but most users won't contribute.. 
And I'm not sure my hierarchy will follow with such time consuming tasks if
it implies other workers. Again, agreed with Radim when he says funders
already funded things..

By myself, I think a release every 4 month is too much. I'm only in capacity
to get involve in a migration for users once a year (80 users to manage, +
Citrix deploiement tests, and docs..) . (That's a only my situation, others
could prefer a frequent release)

Anyway, keep going on a stable calendar, and we'll do our best testing and
funding. Valmeria will be an excellent release. 
Cheers!
R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Printing error in QGIS Web Client Master
Message-ID: <CAN5q7SVysDXF9gMOsHCymP8avGOLR6-9n4cj3=cL2C3M2BvBLA@mail.gmail.com>

 I installed the QGIS Web Client Master with OSGeo4W, however I find an
error in printing. Checking I find that:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Web-Client/blob/master/site/js/QGISExtensions.js
#L369

Line 369 of QGISExtensions file should be:

url: serverAndCGI + '?'+ wmsMapName,

Changing "/" to "?", with this change I've managed to correct the error.

Do not know if it's a possible bug and apply for other platforms.

regards,

Samuel Mesa.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Python QgsLocalServer and standard fonts for
	testing
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8S4VXpistEBqARzAn0xb1S6v+W6OfDEk+gUk4-jw4sSw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

While trying to get some labeling bugs fixed, I noticed some serious issues
with the local unit test server, for qgis_mapsev.fcgi, I had previously
made, and some issues relating to the loading of test fonts. The latter
drove me crazy for over a week trying to track it down, but I finally have
a workaround. I can now essentially 'trust' the output from server tests.

What changes did I make?

* Tossed all the old QgsLocalServer[Config] classes and support files

* QgsLocalServer is now a server controller class [0] with these features:
-   Web and FCGI processes are separated and can be independently controlled
-   Abstracted controller can work with any backend Web and FCGI-spawning
executables
-   Initial Lighttpd and spawn-fcgi support, but can work with Nginx,
Apache, uWSGI, fcgiwrap, etc.
-   Just need local init scripts, or commands, and configs to add new
backends, which only need to be on PATH
-   Uses sockets on *nix-based machines

* Removed FreeSansQGIS font and added Bitstream Vera Sans (Roman, Bold,
Oblique, Bold Oblique) test font family [1]
* Test fonts reworked to have specific 'QGIS Vera Sans' name to avoid font
conflicts
* Test fonts are now built into desktop and server executables via
testdata.qrc
* In Release builds, all test fonts are available, but not loaded by default
* In Debug builds, all test fonts are available, but only Roman and Bold
styles are loaded by default
* Loading of test fonts moved to QgsFontUtils, with sip bindings


What does this affect?

Very little, except my sanity. :-) Other than the adding of testdata.qrc to
the desktop and server executables, regardless of build type, only the
fledgling Python unit tests for labeling were affected. This is because no
one else used the old QgsLocalServer classes.


So, what's this mean?

* Adding a local server to a Python test class is very simple [1]
* Once Web and FCGI-spawning executables are available on PATH, no other
config required
* Classes are initial foundation for a Python plugin that allows live
previewing of current project in a local, no-config QGIS Server, with
chose-able web client loaded into QWebPage

* Test fonts are more robust, but still fairly small in size (load quickly)
[2, see char tables]
* Test fonts can easily be loaded via C++ or Python in desktop or unit tests
* Example: loaded from PyQGIS Console (running RelWithDebInfo build)

from PyQt4.QtGui import *
fontdb = QFontDatabase()

fontdb.styles(QgsFontUtils.standardTestFontFamily()) --> [u'Bold', u'Roman']
QgsFontUtils.loadStandardTestFonts(['Bold Oblique']) --> True
fontdb.styles(QgsFontUtils.standardTestFontFamily()) --> [u'Bold Oblique',
u'Bold', u'Roman']

tf = QgsFontUtils.getStandardTestFont('Bold Oblique', 12) --> QFont
tf.family() --> u'QGIS Vera Sans'
tf.bold() --> True
tf.italic() --> True
tf.pointSize() --> 12

* Such manual loading of test font(s) in a Release build allows helping
users debug labeling, etc. with a known, valid font
* Using similar interface, other fonts of differing typeface, writing
direction, etc. can easily be unit tested


Caveats?

* Only config'd to work with lighttpd/spawn-fcgi and only on Mac, right now

This is because I didn't have time to also config on other platforms and
work on labeling bugs. It's fairly quick to do however. See [3, 4], if
interested in adding a platform/server setup. The labeling tests generally
failed on most platforms anyways, due to other issues that this setup has
fixed.

* Practically no docstrings or other documentation, yet (classes are pretty
semantic, though)

* Control images need rebuilt.. so, all labeling tests will fail until then


Lastly, please do not hesitate to make my submitted code better. :-)

for this release, we invested a large proportion of our funds (derived from
sponsorship and donations) to hire core developers and doing bugfix.
This has proven very successful, but is currently unsustainable for the future.
Further sponsoring is therefore welcome, and will greatly improve the quality of
future releases.
In shorth: users, if you want a release without blockers, your best option is to
donate or sponsor QGIS.
I think we should mention this clearly in the release notes for 2.2.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Larry,

Thank you for this contribution.

Do you have any experience yet to quantify the differences introduced by 
the various font rendering engines used on supported operating systems? 
I keep reading that they all render differently, but I haven't found a 
hint about how much that difference could be.

Cheers
Matthias

Hi,

CSI piemonte was thinking to port it, but we developped a "better" core
solution integrating in the legend (only if legedGraphic capability is
available).

but if, for some reason, you still interested in porting
CSIWMSLegend<https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/CSIWMSLegend/> plugin
we can arrange a solution.

thank you, Luigi Pirelli

Hi,

Along these lines I see it as an option that the many local QGIS user
groups that establish currently could perhaps come up with some
additional funding. Most organizations and companies would happily pay
a small annual fee into a local user group if the group spends this
money wisely to the benefit of all users. I think the Swiss QGIS user
group can perhaps again help with the 2.4 release. We did not help
with 2.2. release as we already spent our 2013 money we have and there
was enough funding in the main project.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] .ui file and photo widget
Message-ID: <5305D615.5000702@gmx.ch>

Hi,

Today I tried to integrate a photo widget in a custom .ui-editor-form - 
with no success.

It was possible to integrate the lineedit and connect a pushbutton to 
open a file browser, but I could not get the preview field to show up.
Did somebody manage to do this?

Technically:
Looking at the sourcecode it seems, that the "editor widget" (think of 
this as a master widget connected by its name to a certain field) is the 
lineedit, but then connecting its change event to a label (the picture 
preview widget) would require the label to be the "editor widget".

In short: it seems impossible to me, but please let me know if I forgot 
about something.

Outlook:
For 2.4 I am still working on a general editor widget system update, 
where I my plans are to introduce the possibility to make a container 
the "editor widget" and then just throw all the additional control 
widgets in there. Doing this will be in addition to any currently 
supported scheme (i.e. This will not break your existing .ui files)

Thank you for your response,
Matthias

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_xc09QQcBagkXXGstNH+9GV2b20kyx4s40QzN7tdfb_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi J?rgen,

I'm definitely in favor of a set release schedule. Though I've missed much
of the 2.1 development cycle, I feel an obligation to finish fixing some of
the more serious labeling bugs. Towards this goal, I'd like to work through
Sunday on those issues, if it is OK to do so.

With the new local unit test server classes, I feel pretty confident now
that any unit tests I make, to ensure the labeling bugs are fixed, should
be valid across all outputs. But, I have now run out of time.

If I could work from now through Sunday, it would be very productive
towards labeling fixes for this release. If not, I understand and will do
what I can today and tomorrow to wrap things up and commit what's working.

I will endeavor to avoid such extension requests in the future.

Best regards,

Larry Shaffer

No, I don't have any data on that. The results are currently too chaotic.
This is why I think having a standard font available across all builds and
tests is important.

For example, when users submit to the tracker a labeling issue, a dev could
ask them to ensure to post an example project using the standard test font.
I think it would be good to have the standard font(s) also available as
part of the install, like maybe in 'resources'. On Mac, the current issue
is that custom fonts can no longer be loaded from a .qrc file, but still
work if loaded from filesystem.

While too late to add to this release, I would like to implement the
auto-loading of 'QGIS Vera Sans' on app startup by default, or at the very
least have a 'Help->Load QGIS Vera Sans font' menu. The latter would allow
users to quickly load the standard test font, and maybe others (when more
are added); though, it doesn't help if the project being opened already
references the font, i.e. best to auto-load on startup. Regardless, the
user should not have to install those fonts onto their system.

Implementing something along these lines should help with gathering
feedback on platform font inconsistencies from users, and for building a
set of well-known rendering anomalies. Alternatively, we could add some
basic renderchecker unit tests that specifically address platform font
inconsistencies. It also might be handy to have a test report generator in
the desktop app itself.

For example, a user could choose 'Help->Generate test report' and a test
report directory is produced on the user's desktop and an index.html file
opened in their browser to preview results. Such a report could provide a
multitude of information, including lib dependency info, provider info,
system info, and some specific renderchecker tests. If it were a PDF, then
the images could be embedded and provide a simple format for sharing.

Regards,

Larry

If we release last minute on Friday - and I should really have set a exact time
and zone beforehand - at say Anchorage time, we still have about 1 day,
14hrs[1] to work on 2.1 before it is branch 2.2.

Although that will be 10am on Saturday for me - so at least 10hrs of precious
packaging time gone ;)

But to quote Tim: "We're not going anywhere".  There will still be bugs in QGIS
2.3 to work on after the release.  And I trust that you're not going to stop
bug fixing just because the fixes don't make it into 2.2.

Of course that's a bit odd and it's an relative arbitrarily set date (and time
and zone) - but I'd still like to keep it.

Good job.  Although we now need lighttp and spawn-cgi now, don't we?  I saw
something in the cdash logs.  Probably something I need to add to osgeo4w.

So we need to coordinate that I don't branch between two of your possibly
dependant last minute commits?  The interruption by branching should be short.

Seems appropriate to freeze at the end of Gary's time zone.  :-)

I'll just do what I can today and tomorrow. I'll keep working on bugs (of
course :-). If someone takes up maintaining a 2.2.1 bug fix release branch,
I'll backport any of my post-2.2-release bug fix commits.

Yes, please do add those to osgeo4w, if possible. QgsLocalServer can be
config'd to work with the osgeo4w Apache and some FCGI spawning utility (or
as an Apache-spawned FCGI), but I think Apache is a bit too much of a
resource hog just to run a local QGIS Server with single connection, e.g.
for unit tests or local previewing.

We discussed before adding lighttpd/spawn-fcgi to the QGIS src build, but
opted for external dependencies, which is what I built the new
QgsLocalServer around. If the local QGIS Server Preview plugin gets
finished [0, mockup], and is considered for core adoption, maybe an
internal build would be nice. The latest versions of lighttpd/spawn-cgi
have CMake build setups [1,2].

Also, I didn't have time, but want to add a FindLocalServer.cmake module,
which would define:

* LOCALSERVER_FOUND
* WEBSERVER_EXECUTABLE
* FCGISPAWN_EXECUTABLE

That module would be run if ENABLE_TESTS=ON and would look for pairs of
web/fcgi-spawn executables that are known to work well together. To pass
the found executable paths to the Python test modules, two
SET(ENV{QGIS_*_EXECUTABLE}) could be added in UsePythonTest.cmake, or the
paths can be written to a file, like is done with qgisbuildpath.txt. Then,
QgsLocalServer class could just be set up to look for either.

Ok. I'll try not to commit at the last second. :-) Helpful countdown clock.

QGIS only support 4.x, I think 4.7 is the min version.

We will move to Qt5 at some stage but not yet.

Hi all,

I just noticed minor inconsistency in  methods naming in QgsCoordinateTransform
class [0]. There is a setSourceCrs (only first letter in upper case in
Crs) method and  setDestCRS (all letters are upper case in CRS).

Should we make them consistent, e.g use "Crs" everywhere? To prevent API break
we can leave exisiting method and mark it as deprecated.

Just a follow up to this if other people ever have trouble with this.

I have managed to load my query layers by specifying False for the loadDefaultStyleFlag parameter when I create the QgsVectorLayer. So

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), layerName, "postgres", False)

This parameter stops QGIS from checking if there are styles in the database, and thus means that it doesn't run loads of queries that it then doesn't close.

QGIS still needs to unload some of the connections that it creates when searching for styles when loading query layers (if you don't specify the False for the loadDefaultStyleFlag), so I believe the bug is still valid, but this is a workaround so that is good. I also wonder if True is the right default for the loadDefaultStyleFlag parameter?

It would be good to get details about this parameter added to http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/loadlayer.html

Is this something I can add myself?

Emne: SV: [Qgis-developer] Issue with standalone python script and PostGIS Layers

Following on from reporting the bug, I have done more digging into the problem.

It seems to be related to styleQML lines when I check what connections are being sent to PostGIS. These don't disappear with each loop iteration in Master, but they do in version 2.0. Eventually when my script gets to 100 connections, it hangs.

What can I do to make this work?

I have updated the bug report with more details, which can be found here https://hub.qgis.org/issues/9357.

Thanks for the response Tim.

I have not been destroying my layers. This has not been an issue when running the plugin with 2.0.

This was the first thing I thought about in the version running against master so I added the following code to close the postgis layers as it once I am finished with them:

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayer(layer_id)
This has not made it difference. It still hangs at the same place and I still get the warning that there is already too many clients when trying to connect to PostGIS with DB Manager or pgAdmin.

Shall I open a bug?

Hello all,

I have a standalone python script that creates a bunch of PDFs for me.

Recently this script has developed an issue. It uses QGIS-dev so it could be related to some of the changes in master recently as it works fine with QGIS 2.0.

It makes about 42 PDFs then it stops.

It is not actually crashing as such, as you can see it running in task manager. It stays running using between 0 and 2% processor, and fluctuates a little with memory use (around 108840kB). But it does not produce any more PDFs. It is like it is stuck.

>From the log file that my script creates, I know that it is hanging with this line of code:

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), layerName, "postgres")

If I try and connect to the database using DB Manager in QGIS or pgAdmin III while the script is still running, I get an error saying there is already too many clients already. If I kill the process in windows task manager, I am then able to connect to the database using DB manager.

Has anyone any suggestions as to what is wrong here? Is this a bug?

I updated QGIS dev this morning using the OSGeo4W installer (its revision is eb9ce3a).


If you are creating postgis layers in a loop, are you making sure to destroy them again nicely in your loop? Anyway if it used to work before maybe there was a regression somewhere....

How about encoding such trust in an official "2.2.x" branch to be used
as a "maintainance" branch from which to ship "2.2.1" after <n> days
of inactivity following last bugfix commit since previous release ?

I'm sure more bugs will be reported once 2.2.0 is officially out so 
those <n> days of silence might take a few weeks too :)

Sure: sources of the python cookbook live here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/source/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/loadlayer.rst

You can fork QGIS-Documentation project and do a Pull Request
(preferably) but if that is too much work (or beyond your git foo), just
write down some paragraph of text and sent it to .... the community list
<very small font> or me </very small font>?

Building the docs itself is currently only working on Linux (not 100% sure).

I, my customers and without a doubt: Several thousands of ordinary users 
of QGIS would simply _love_ the idea of having a stable branch which is 
only updated with bugfixes. The problem with using QGS - "weekly" is 
that you get the bugfixes, but also a lot of new - very untested - 
technology. This gets the ordinary users stuck between a rock and a hard 
place.

I might possibly be able to get some of my customers to "cough up some

That's good news! Either developer time or money would do.
An estimate will strongly depend on who could take care of it.
All the best, and thanks.

Just to add some background info about "taking care" of a stable
branch:

There have been 14 commits between tags "final-2_0_0" and "final-2_0_1".
The download page makes you download 2.0.1.

There are 42 commits between tag "final-2_0_1" and current tip of 
the "release-2_0" branch, but no final "2.0.2" release exists.

Latest commit in the branch was on Mon Feb 3 15:25:35 2014 +0100,
that is 18 days ago (2.5 weeks).

I think "taking care of stable releases" would be first of all setting
some rules about when a new stable release is due. I think this would be
the duty of the release manager. My proposal was to "cut" a new release
after some days (or weeks) of inactivity since last commit. For example
if it is after 2 weeks, we would be ready to cut a 2.0.2 right now.

Once rules are setup, we'd need:

 1. Someone to execute the "cutting" rule (ie: go throught the process
    of closing a final version when it is due).

 2. Someone to guard after what activity is allowed or not allowed
    in the stable branch.

 3. Any number of developers backporting bugfixes to the stable branch.

The first task could be delivered on-demand.
The second task would be best covered by a "maintainer role".
The third task could be taken care of by anyone.

Hi,

Maybe I did not follow all discussion. But I see people posting tweets
and blogs everywhere that QGIS 2.2 will be available in 24h or something
similar.

Is this really true? Don't we require a couple of days for packaging,
testing that the binaries really work, etc.?

I am just a bit worried that people put out false promises and increased
pressure on the release manager, making people believe that they can
install QGIS 2.2. Monday morning ...

Sorry if I don't know all the details - this is more a question than a
comment as I am not totally aware of what tasks are required to do the
releases.

Well, I think it's a matter of perception.

It would take a simple git tag for me to be able to install QGIS 2.2.0.
For somebody else it'd take a .deb or .rpm or .exe package instead.

The way I see it, a release should be considered "published" as soon
as a versioned tarball with the source code is made available somewhere
on the internet.

It may be a good habit, in the future, to tag "release candidates"
for packagers to test them before going final.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Which compiler for a c++ QGIS custom app
Message-ID: <530760A3.9070500@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am a bit lost at trying to build a custom QGIS app on a windows 7.

I have installed QGIS libs, Qt libs and minGW using osgeo4w installer 
(thanks to Nathan's advices).
I have also installed Qt Creator 3.0.

Now in creator, I have configured Qt version as Qt 4.7. using 
c:\osgeo4w\bin\qmake.exe.

But I can't manage to find the right compiler to use for this version.
With all the compilers I tried, it says "none of the compiler can 
produce code for this version of Qt".

Does someone know which compiler to use? Can't I use one embedded in 
osgeo package?

PS: I don't have visual studio installed, and I would like to avoid 
installing it.

Thanks a lot,

Denis

Yes.  That's what we had the freeze period for.  But we're going to release
only the sources today (which still lasts 18h in Alaska) and call for packages
after that.

The release manager is blocking people from continuing their bug fixing work
after having blocked them to doing their feature work already.

Releasing just the sources on the release date will probably just put pressure
on the packagers to get packages out asap.  But there's no set date when that
needs to happen.  But Monday is hopefully not far off.

Hi J?rgen,

Thanks for the clarification.

Maybe in the future we could also test binary packages before we
"officially" release QGIS. After all this is what people use out their.
If packages are broken (even if QGIS from source is fine) this will be
bad for QGIS reputation. 95% of the QGIS users will judge QGIS after the
quality of the package they install. They would not install from source.

I guess any company with a "product" would do that. I know, we are a
project and not a company, but I think from a QA perspective we should
really also test packages before releasing stuff. At least for the most
common OS, like Win64, latest OSX, latest Ubuntu/Debian.

Anyway - thanks for all the work to all the devs and to you as release
manager!

Andreas

mingw using the osgeo4w installer?  That might be there for GRASS.

But QGIS and Qt in OSGeo4W is built with Visual C++ not MinGW.  You can't use
OSGeo4W's Qt with MinGW.

Sorry, I didn't do that for years - should also be possible, but I suppose it
takes some work.

Hi J?rgen,

Thanks a lot for your reply.

It seems I should finally use Visual C++.
I will give it a try this weekend!

Thanks again and happy release ;)

That's what the test period is for - the differences there are minor (at least
for Windows and the debian/ubuntu packages).

But a lot of people will always wait for the release before they start to test
and find stuff that no one ran into while testing - of course some of those
could be found in a separate package testing phase (and with a extensive test
suite), but packaging problems can also be handled outside of the qgis release
schedule.

As the packaging is now outside of qgis (and IMHO is was that way earlier - eg.
bugs in the OSGeo4W packages should be filed there - but the standalone
installer from repackaged OSGeo4W packages is a gray area).

For Windows there's already some threshold - I'll first put the new release
into OSGeo4W and produce a standalone installer some time later...

That's why maintaining a stable branch is important: there'll always
be a lot more testing after a release is out. You can't beat thousand
of users with any automated tests... :)

Greetings Devs,
I have a large number of shapefiles I need to process and have had limited success using QGis 2.0.1 with it's python console.
// This works - 
from osgeo import ogr

canvas =
qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()

allLayers = canvas.layers()

for i in allLayers: i.selectAll(); print i.name(); print
i.selectedFeatureCount()
// What I can't figure out is how to throw in a selection and then run Dissove on it.
I've tried 
for i in allLayers: i.selectAll(); print i.name(); i.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest().QgsExpression('LWFLAG <> "P" '); print i.selectedFeatureCount()andselExp = QgsExpression('LWFLAG <> "P" ')for i in allLayers: i.selectAll(); print i.name(); i.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest(selExp); print i.selectedFeatureCount()
andfor i in allLayers: i.selectAll(); print i.name(); i.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest('LWFLAG <> "P" ')); print i.selectedFeatureCount()
and several other techniques all to no avail. 
In PseudoCode:
from osgeo import ogrcanvas = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()allLayers = canvas.layers()for i in allLayers:       i.select('LWFLAG <> "P" ');       print i.name();       print i.selectedFeatureCount();      i.dissolve("use sel", i.name() + '_dis', "BLOCKGRP");

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 2.2
Message-ID: <20140222085848.GA8399@norbit.de>

QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System
that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.

We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 2.2 'Valmiera'.  The
emphasis on this release has been very much on polish and performance - we have
added many new features, tweaks and enhancements to make the user interface
more consistent and professional looking (and hopefully easier to use). The
composer (used for creating print ready maps) has had a lot of work done to it
to make it a more viable platform for creating great cartographic outputs.

This is first release following our new four month release schedule that is
meant to make new features and bugfixes available quicker and the development
and new releases more predictable.

In order to streamline the release process, we only release the source code
today.  The binaries will be created in close succession by the individual
package maintainers.  The source code is and the binaries soon will be
available via the large download link on our home page: http://qgis.org

If there is not yet a binary package for your platform on the above page,
please check back regularly as packagers push out their work and the
download page will reflect the new packages.


A word of thanks to our contributors, donors and sponsors

I have prepared windows binaries in osgeo4w now.  The currently marked 'test'
there you you have to use the advanced install and check the 'Exp' radio button
on the top to install them.

Please test and report problems, so that I can soon promote them to 'curr'ent.
Once that has happend, I'll proceed with turning them into standalone
installers.

OS X package will be a little delayed.  I am finally upgrading Macs at my job to Mt Lion, so I won't be supporting Snow Leopard, and I'm checking a few things in all my packages and my development environment.

Hi,

I have a suggestion with regards to addressing bugs and supporting the
concept of a 2.2.1 bug-fix release for stability's sake.

How about for a set period of time, only commits that devs think can
readily be ported to the 2.2.0 branch are 'allowed' on master? With any
code changes, which would make porting changes/fixes over to the 2.2.0
branch difficult, submitted via pull requests. Maybe for two weeks?

I think if code is committed to core that steamrolls over the means of
providing a reasonably timed bug-fix update, it becomes that much harder to
do so. I also think much user frustration may stem from that vicious cycle,
and we have an opportunity to fix that *right now*.

Don't get me wrong. I like the new release schedule. Just looking for ways
to make it as beneficial for users as it is for devs/packagers.

Best regards,

Larry

As much as I'd love to see the multithreaded rendering branch land asap,
I'm in favour of Larry's proposal.

Message-ID: <53092362.4090407@northrivergeographic.com>

I asked on the Ubuntu GIS list and they wanted me to check here. I am 
using the UbuntuGIS repos.

I just upgraded to QGIS 2.2 - upon the upgrade I'm getting an error. The 
OS is 12.04 LTS. I also renamed the .qgis directory to get a new one and 
the error remained.

/Unable to open bookmarks database.
/Database:/home/rjhale/.qgis2//qgis.db
/Driver: Driver not loaded
/Database: Driver not loaded


If I crank up qgis from a terminal I get one more bit of useful info
when trying to make a bookmark:

/Warning: QSqlDatabase: QSQLITE driver not loaded Warning: QSqlDatabase: 
available drivers: QMYSQL3 QMYSQL QSPATIALITE/

Thoughts? Am I missing something?

Whoa, there. Heck, I didn't even name my son Larry.  :-)

I just checked INSTALL [0] and it looks like that package needs to be added
as a listed dependency. Probably should let the folks at UbuntuGIS know
that as well, if you have the time.

HI,
In my struggle to manage to build QGIS from source, I finally found the  
INSTALL-file on github. (No link to this from the website! At least I  
couldn't find anything)

I just want to remark, that under

Optional dependencies:
...
- for georeferencer - GSL >= 1.8

the version number can't be correct, cause there is no such high version  
available.
This might be no big problem for most people, but for a noob like me, this  
is causing hysteria and increasing blood pressure.

I think it came into existence from an old version i found here
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Minimal-requirements-td4157264.html
where it sais:

- for georeferencer - GSL >= ? (works with 1.8)



In general, I would also like to remark, that it would be very nice to  
have kind of a wiki for build instructions for the different platforms and  
versions and the different related resources like GDAL, spatialite etc. as  
well, cause I have to build GDAL myself for MrSID and FGDB-support (and  
without that, QGIS on Linux is quite useless for me, at least not for  
productive work).
Finding all these infos (and sometimes not very congruentt ones) in  
different blogs and forums is ridiculously time-consuming. And when I  
already invest so much time in fiddling out this, I would like to have the  
other parts state of the art as well, but there is unfortunately no common  
place for instructions on the related items.

Cheers
Bernd

Several people invested time [1] to create QGIS.
You are welcome to be part of the project and improve build description.
After that read your e-mail once again...

The web resources are always in flux to some extent, with 2.0 the data
has actually been shifting from the wiki into the main docs and other
appropriate places. As Robert points out, more volunteers are always
welcome to help clean things up. I think in the move to the new site
things got easier for new users but stuff for devs and people compiling
got a little lost for those who don't already know where to look.

An install.txt in the root of a source tree is actually standard
practice in the industry. The download page hints (but agreed should
link) if you click on Sources :
"Refer to the INSTALL guide on how to compile QGIS from source for the
different platforms."

If you're on Ubuntu or Debian the easiest way to get a build going is to do:
sudo apt-get build-dep qgis
This automatically pulls in all the required libraries for compiling.

As for FGDB, that is absolutely possible on linux but not simple one
click install. This thread has good info
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/How-to-open-ESRI-geodatabase-in-QGIS-1-8-and-Gdal-1-9-on-Ubuntu-tp5014447p5015419.html

Thanks for reaching out with questions, don't hesitate when you get
stuck. We also have an IRC channel if you want to try to get more
immediate help especially when dealing with compiling.
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/support.html
Note: there's also a #gdal channel for more help on FGDB

Enjoy,
Alex

I also have the impression that the new website is harder to navigate.  And the
sphinx stuff makes little updates time consuming.

There should be a link to

http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html

on the documentation page (which reminds me that I still have to add the 2.2
API docs).

But it is.  1.8 is from 2006.   Current is 1.16.

Hm, I'd say building GDAL extensions is out of scope for our build
instructions.  But you can as a wiki page to hub.qgis.org, if you like.

Our agreement was to not do point releases.  And not because stable release are
a bad thing, but just acknowleding the fact that we don't have the resources to
do everything.  The more we "wasted" on releases, the more we loose on feature
work.

Maybe we should just emphasize more that the four weeks before the release are
not a pure developer thing.  If users want good releases, they should verify
that master is ok before it get released - and not start testing right after
the release.  Of course all testing is welcome, but testing after the release
only contributes to the next release.

So blocking development for another two weeks to backport stuff to a branch
that - unless in the undesired event that something severe wasn't spotted in
the four weeks before the release - won't ever be released, doesn't make sense
to me.

The next release is 117[1] days away.  That might sound far away, but I bet
it's sooner than we think.

The link to the INSTALL build instructions is "hidden" under  
"Developement" headers
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#development

I think almost everything is on the website already but sometimes the  
structure is not as intuitive as it could be.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Robert,
sorry for the wrong wording again. Of course I appreciate all your efforts  
in developing QGIS and I'm a QGIS-evangelist.
I donate as often as I can, and that's all i can contribute, cause I am  
even not able (yet) to build that stuff myself.

This message was written to show a really minor mistake in the install  
text on github, and further on I (humbly) remarked that it would be "nice"  
to have a central place for the install instruction for the other parts  
needed as well. And contributing to that would of course not be the  
developers job, but maybe thinking about the possibility to offer a wiki  
for that.
Q&PA-Platforms like stackexchange are not really suitable for that, and  
searching the mailing lists will not lead anywhere in a lot of cases as  
well.

And it is really time consuming to gather all the tips and tricks from  
those different resources, and I'm always a friend of streamlining  
processes, not only for me but also for lots of others who fail in  
building that stuff, or even finding proper instructions.

If I were able to build QGIS and related stuff myself, I would be able to  
run the stable and the master versions alongside and could work and test.
And when I finally successfully built everything, I would be happy to  
publish my findings .. but where? Just on an other blog or in another  
blogs comments, which will be outdated soon?

But I do not intend to lead a discussion here.
Just my 2 cents
Bernd

Oh, sorry, I missed that.  I was probably too concentrated on trying to explain
that version 1.16 is higher than 1.8. ;)

Here, if it's something that should be integrated in INSTALL and you don't want
to jump to the hoops on github to issue a pull request to doc/INSTALL.t2t & co.
You could also file a ticket on hub.qgis.org.

There's although a wiki there - but chances are that blogs and that wiki page
share the same fate.

Message-ID: <CAC2XbFffnq+8UCdOEKPgcvbHac-50f2-kkJc0kzf1EeeQ-nMFg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

this is a short note about the fact that multi-threaded rendering has
now landed in master, so from now on, you should be able to enojy
better experience when browsing your map (especially the fact that you
can keep using QGIS as usual even if rendering continues in the
background).

By default the parallel rendering is not enabled (yet) - to enable it
please go to options > Rendering and check the appropriate option.
There is another new option that lets you setup how often the map
canvas should be refreshed while being rendered.

If you find anything that used to work for you and now it does not, do
not hesitate to let me know. I hope the merge has not ruined your
Sunday :-)

Another, more technically oriented mail will follow later.

Regards
Martin

Needless to say, I'm also in favour of it.

It would be interesting to look at the bug tracker to check
how many bugs are reported affecting 2.1.0 in a week.

Speaking of which, there's no "2.1.0" field to pick for
the "Affected version" field in a new ticket.

Most of them are in files generated by MOC - maybe we could disable
the deprecation warnings for those files. For the actual QGIS source
code that triggers deprecation warnings, these should get sorted out.

I see, sorry I didn't check the actual code... I tried changing the
function to an inline one, but the moc file still triggers the deprecated
warning.

Unless there is an argument against it, I think Martin's suggestion to
disable deprecated warnings for moc files.

Personally I am not a fan of wikis for this kind of info. They tend to be a
dumping ground for 'stuff' that gets left unmaintained and takes users down
blind alleys. Having the INSTALL file is a 'single point of truth' that we
can maintain and that should always relate to the particular version of the
code base it ships with. Of course if you find issues with it or can
improve it, by all means send us a patch and we will fix and improve it.

Hi,

Identify with "Open feature form, if a single feature is identified" opens both Feature Form and Identify Results window.

Anyone confirms?

Tested on Linux.

Thanks for re-raising this.  Unfortunately the original report was closed
before the problem was actually fixed - just because there was a workaround.

That reminds me of someone mentioning in a ticket of a 2.0 issue resolved
against qgis 2.1 that he'd wait (angrily?) having fix backported into a
(mythical) 2.0.x update rather than him moving to 2.2 and having to deal
with possible regressions. I was thinking at the time that this sounds to
me like a flawed behavior by some QGIS users, an egg or chicken situation.
How are regressions fixed if users are not doing their parts in uncovering
and reporting them.

That led me to think there might be a very low-cost, high reward behavior
QGIS could adopt: 4, or 2, weeks before the release date, {beta,release
candidate,tech preview,etc.} builds (from master, no need to branch out
really) are pushed out to osgeo4w & linux and quite loudly advertised (blog
posts, social media, etc.) to get as many users as possible to test drive
it. The users' feedback would enrich the 4-weeks period when developers are
to be focused on bug-fixing only.

Thoughts? Was that already suggested and declined?

Martin,

Fantastic work; I knew to expect a better rendering experience, yet I was
caught by surprise at how much of a positive difference it makes.

Few things from my 10-minutes play with it:
* The map overview extend is broken, its extend goes way, way beyond the
extend of the sum of all the layers in a given project
* The 'xxx' option doesn't seem to be taken into consideration, the
parallel rendering is always activated on my machine irrespective of
whether I checked the box or not.
* Half of the times I exited QGIS, the application process was not
terminating and this error message was thrown: "*** Error in
`/home/webmaster/apps/bin/qgis': corrupted double-linked list: 0x0a0680f0
***"; I had to manually kill the process

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Datum transformations
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFeuE=DGD2FeZ_vmAgS+5wnJ4Myqj6rDhVT=J1ApKnj1Cw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi (Marco)

I have some suggestions for the implementation of datum transforms in
QGIS and I would like to hear your opinion about them.

In the 2.2 release, as far as I understand the logic is implemented like this:
- map renderer emits a signal asking for datum transform choice
- map canvas catches the signal and provides either the default
(defined in options) or asks the user in a dialog - and sends this
information back to map renderer
- map renderer stores the information about datum transforms and does
loading/saving in project file
- map renderer provides access to coordinate transforms (with correct
datum transform info)

The main issue I see here is the fact that in case of non-default
datum transforms - if some code in QGIS creates coordinate transform
without using transform provided by map renderer, it will be created
without the chosen datum transform and will therefore provide
incorrect results. This can lead to subtle bugs (for example,
QgsVectorFileWriter will not use the defined datum transforms, causing
offsets in reprojected data). Changing all the possible places where
coordinate transform may be used to call
QgsMapRenderer::transformation() seems impractical.

What do you think about:
- using QgsCoordinateTransformCache internally by
QgsCoordinateTransform anytime a new transform should be instantiated
- keeping the datum transform information in a helper class
(loaded/saved by project) and using it directly by
QgsCoordinateTransform - so any QGIS code will use the correct datum
transform
- GUI: have a tab in project properties where non-default datum
transforms would be managed - instead of requiring the user to select
the datum transform immediately when the layer was added (and without
being able to change the decision later)

Currently the datum transforms do not work at all in master after the
merge of MTR because the QgsMapRenderer class is not used for
rendering anymore. Before trying to do anything in that area I would
like to hear your input.

I guess there is still a question what to do in cases when there are
more layers with the same CRS but with different datum transforms - I
am not sure how well the current implementation handles that case (if
there is a datum transform defined in options, it will be used for all
layers with given CRS) and how much we need such functionality.

Regards
Martin

I always thought there is not enough publicity made to encourage testing 
the master build.
Advertising for beta and release candidate sounds like a good  idea.

Just to be clear, I don't think QGIS can handle more than one pre release.
The list of terminologies was just there as a "pick one name you like" :)

What's the difference to the nightly builds and the weekly standalone snapshot
for Windows - except for the noise of course?

Nightly builds (or weekly snapshots for that matter) are very different
from a publicized, pre-release preview build. With a prepared pre-release
preview, users are at least expecting that basic functioning will work,
that's something  the nightly builds simply can't guarantee by the nature
of what those are. Very few average user will install a nightly development
build, but you get an higher chance of getting a broader number of people
(that interacts with QGIS in different ways) to test out your product
before it's released.

It also helps channel what your describing as noise (i.e. users running
into problems) into a better managed call for people to test and report.
The noise will happen no matter what. But it might make some sense to
trigger some of that noise (valid bugs and "invalid" RTFM cases) _before_
you release your final version via a pre-release social media and news site
"try this pre-release build" :)

It's really more a matter of presentation to the users than of actual work.
As you point out Jef, you guys already have the infrastructure that
produces weekly standalone builds, and daily packages.

Hi Tom,

I see you started collecting Meta Data Catalogues (at least on national scale) for the default services in the plugin.

I like the idea very much. What about asking (QGIS) users explicitly to provide addresses for their countries? Such a collection would be really valuable (especially for people working across borders) and maybe also of interest for other projects as there are already comparable initiatives on collecting information on available data:
http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Geodata_Discovery_Working_Group
http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Global_datasets

What do you think?

Cheers,
Stefan

Hi Stefan: thanks for the info.  This is the dreaded metadata "link types" issue.

If possible, can you open an issue on this so we can discuss this in the ticket?

Thanks

In my quick test everything seems to work fine, I will need more
details about the issue - feel free to file a bug report.

Works fine for me... but there are two different concepts:
1. rendering in background - GUI is responsive even while the map is
being rendered - this is always on
2. parallel vs sequential rendering - in sequential mode, there is
just one job that renders everything - in parallel mode, the job is
split into several jobs (one job per map layer) and jobs can therefore
use multiple cores

Are you sure you are not referring to point 1?
Also, it is worth noting that parallel rendering may bring
improvements only when there is more than one layer to render.

I had this problem too - due to some garbage in the build directory
(incompatible plugin DLLs). Try to run QGIS with --noplugins option.
But better do a clean build.

Why not?  We're talking about a feature freezed period!?  The nightly build
is a snapshot what what will get release.  Where do you see a difference?

Why should it matter if we call it "weekly snapshot", "nightly build" or
"prerelease"?   It's the same thing, just the tag is different.  And
installation is essential as easy as installing the stable release.

Exactly.  And that's what I meant with noise: "tada, there's a new weekly
snapshot/prerelease/nightly build" - not users running into problems.  Because
I see that as the only significant difference to what we already have.

There is a lot of code and plugins that rely on the assumption that a 
coordinate transformation is fully defined by source crs and destination 
crs. I agree it is not an ideal situation, however that assumption is 
simply not correct  and it probably takes some time until all places are 
changed. I remember having changed that for QgsVectorFileWriter, but 
other places (e.g. measuring tool) still behaves not correct.

layers with given CRS)


This is my main concern regarding caching of datum transformation. It is 
very important to have the possibility to control the datum 
transformation for each layer individually. E.g. it is quite common to 
load a layer twice with different datum transformations to see the 
difference. This was actually my main visual test during implementation, 
so I'm quite sure it works in 2.2 (or at least it was when I tested that 
last time). In case a user defines  a default transformation, he accepts 
that it will be silently used for all layers (and there is still the 
possibility to delete that in options).

I don't have a strong opinion if it should be in project properties or 
if the user should be asked immediately. The immediate selection has 
been implemented following the behaviour of a commercial GIS. However, 
the possibility to change it later easily does also sound good to me.

Btw., congratulations to the merge of the multithreading branch!

Regards,
Marco

I installed Visual Studio Express 2013, and it seems the compiler given with (version 12.0) is not compliant with Qt libs from the osgeo package.

Do you know if I should I restrict to a given version of the compiler? Which one has been used for building osgeo?s qt lib?
I saw that Nathan is using version 9.0.

Thanks a lot,

The supported version is VS 2008.  I have never tried building with
anything else.

Right, if you want to use Qt from OSGeo4W you need to you the same compiler as
the one used to build Qt.    That is 2008 for 32bit and 2010 for 64bit.

Hi Marco,

I struggled quite a lot with the interface of a very famous commercial 
GIS on this issue, I believe there is a real possibility to do better 
here ! I think it is essential to allow the user to change the 
transformation later easily, maybe somewhere linked from the CRS choice 
? That's where I would go as a user.

I was also wondering how you see the relationship between CRS and datum 
transformation. I use CRSs (all the Beijing54 CRS) which already have a 
+towgs84 defined in their definition, but several towgs84 coefficients 
are offered when loading the layer. It is confusing to have to answer 
that, and if something else than the default coefficients is chosen, the 
result is incompatible with the proj4 definition. Should we strip these 
CRS definitions of the towgs84 coefficients (which were only meant for a 
small area initially, so are not valid everywhere)?

Also, do you see a need to allow to define a custom datum 
transformation, or do you think it is enough that user can create a 
custom CRS with different towgs84 parameters?

Regards,

Leyan

In an old feature request from me [1] I was suggesting to add LIKE/ILIKE
filter to GetFeatureInfo FILTER allowed params.
Trying to follow the path of the request, it seems that the filter is
simply appended to layer subsetstring as it is. QgsFilters' aren't being
used, right?

He, he, I bet it is the same GIS :-)

Do you mean we should strip the towgs84 parameters from 
tbl_srs.parameters or do you mean to deprecate/remove entries from 
tbl_datum_transform?

 >Also, do you see a need to allow to define a custom datum 
transformation, or do you think it is enough that user can create a 
custom CRS with different towgs84 parameters?

It is possible to add new entries to tbl_datum_transform to create 
custom datum transformations. Yes, it would be more convenient to have a 
gui for that, even if I don't know how often it will be used. You might  
judge it better since you obviously have to deal often with CRS issues.

Regards,
Marco

Please note the following related issue:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9396 "deactivate the Select datum
transformations dialog by default"

Maybe the ticket has to be reopened?

LIKE was just added in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/ddc0f87f3e9113f4aeb693c46e446ed5eed7474d

ILIKE was not working as we expected, therefore we didn't included it.

Hi Ivan,
so ILIKE works bad in QGIS Desktop too? I will test it.

Can you confirm QgsFilter is not being used (mmm... where is it ever used
now?)

Excellent work, thanks guys.

Just a thought, but as part of the release process (I'm guessing there's a
big list of things to do somewhere) I'd suggest updating the "Affected
Version" on redmine to whatever the newest version is. There's no 2.2.0 on
there currently.

Cheers,
Jonathan

Message-ID: <1393250257366-5105532.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I would like to catch the layer or layer id that is sending
attributeValueChanged signal. 
This signal carries only  QgsFeatureId fid,	int  	idx, const QVariant & ) 	

Any idea how to do this in a clean way? 

Cheers,

I think it's a perception thing.
"Nightly build" in my mind always means "bleeding edge may or may not work,
use at own risk." I'm aware that doesn't always mean "*it will crash your
computer, burn down your house, and spend your life savings on questionable
drugs*", but it's certainly not what I see as a synonym for "stable" either.

Every time I see a nightly, it always comes with a big scary caveat (QGIS
does too - http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html ). This
trains users not to use them. Taking one of the nightlies and re-branding
it to something more amicable would get more folks to test it. Just copy
and paste it and rename the file. :-)

Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi R?gis

Calling sender() in your SLOT should return the QgsVectorLayer object
There is also QSignalMapper [1] which has a cleaner concept, but it 
looks as if this will on the one hand help you to identify the source 
layer, but you will loose any other parameters, what's probably not 
your intent.

Best
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rendering feature symbol when feature is not
	visible
Message-ID: <CAM4StfAF-CaUQoU46YCA59yMybmeoSQ7VxBd-dJ_NjzrNUmytg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to render marker symbols that are bigger than the feature
geometry bounding box. When the feature is not visible (because it is out
of the current extent) the symbol isn't rendered.

I think the code in the draw method of qgsvectorlayer.cpp is:


QgsFeatureIterator fit = getFeatures( QgsFeatureRequest()

                                        .setFilterRect(
rendererContext.extent() )

                                        .setSubsetOfAttributes( attributes ) );


Ok, this is a expected behaviour, but is there anyway (using C++ API) to
change this behaviour without extending QgsVectorLayer?  I suppose that if
I could pass the renderContext with the whole layer extent it would do the
trick.


Any suggestions or ideas?


Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Yes - I can confirm that on Windows (OSGeo4W). Very annoying. I don't
know when this bug was introduced - too bad I did not see it before the
release.

With this bug present I cannot roll out QGIS 2.2 in my organization -
sad - it means I have to wait another 4 months to maybe have a useful
release. We really need these 2.2x releases fixing the most urgent bugs.

How about making a formal announcement (mailing list, website, wiki etc)
telling the users that QGIS version 2.X is in feature freeze and therefore
is sufficiently stable to be tested by end users? This may increase the
number of testers.

As an end user that uses QGIS for production, this is the only time I work
with QGIS Master.

Slightly deviating from the topic, but I'm quite fond of the GeoServer
release process; they're revamping a little to offer better Long Term
Support:
http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GSIP+107+-+Extended+Release+Schedule

I feel a similar system would solve most of QGIS' release problems:
- Bugfix releases
- LTS (if/when required)
- Predictable releases (though now fixed by QGIS)
- Clear test releases (betas and release candidates)

In comparison the QGIS release system feels... haphazard I guess is the
best word.

I know the common complaint is a lack of a resources, but QGIS has far more
resources than GeoServer - both in number of developers and the existence
of a "general fund".

Just thought I'd put it out there.
Cheers,
Jonathan

Sure, but that doesn't change that it's a misperception.

It more like "This is what we're going to release soon - it's not too bad and
it's getting better every day, but if you don't try it and report problems,
it's your responsibility if the release later eats your kids". ;)

Or just remove all those wimpy warnings.  It's in the smallprint (GPL) anyway.
The users can not tests all they want, we still can't even be made responsible
if the release does not eat kids. ;)

Ok, seriously, I should probably emphasize in the freeze announcement, that
it's mainly the users that are supposed to test the daily prereleases and
weekly release candidates and report problems, while the developers work on
reproducing and fixing already known or newly reported bugs.

And the warnings on the download page should be changed to say, that testing
nightly builds in the development phase are different thing than the daily
prereleases in the freeze phase.

Hi Matthias, 
thanks for the pointer. My plugin main class does not inherits from anything
and I get the following error:

 line 173, in labelLayerModified
    sender = self.sender()
AttributeError: EasyCustomLabeling instance has no attribute 'sender'

Should I inherit my class from a higher QT or PyQt4 object, and which one? 

Cheers
R?gis

J?rgen, at first thank you for your work as a developer and RM.

Time based releases are very good decision.

I think that clear separation of nightly builds after a feature freeze from
regular nightly builds (even if they are technically same) followed by loud
public announcements will surely help to catch more bugs.

Even if there is a no man power to maintain bugfix releases, please support
people to commit backported fixes to release branches. I think many people
realized importance of these bug releases and will offer a hand. I vote for
Sandro's work flow - if there is at least one commit from latest minor release
and at least 14 days of silence - release just a source code. Other things
will follow upon volunteer base.

?A followup:
I had my class inherit from QObject (first time doing that for me) and I catch the sender correctly. 
Strangely, I catch the signal twice, so maybe inherinting from QObject triggers another signalk somewhere.. 
Cheers

Hi Stefan: great idea! FYI there is discussion on this at
https://github.com/geopython/MetaSearch/pull/31#issuecomment-35818883,
the output of which we'll place on the MetaSearch w.r.t. how to get
your CSW added to default connections.  If someone can put out a call
to qgis-user, that would be great.

I think those two posts really do sum it up. The project just needs to
communicate better with the user community that the weeks between the
feature freeze and release are their chance to make a difference, by
testing the 'release candidate' (or whatever it going to be called), or be
prepared to wait 4 months.

+1  I'm all for these changes. I don't think the idea I proposed in the
original post is any better, excepting the inclusion of a larger user base,
which still doesn't mean better testing, though.

If the majority of users 'know' that they have several weeks every 4 months
to directly affect change/bugs right before a release, that should be good
enough.

Also, would be good to list that right on the Roadmap schedule [0], e.g.:

WEEK  DATE  EVENT
21         23.0    2.3  freeze begins, release candidate

Hi Martin,

This is just awesome work!

Unfortunately, all but the simplest labeling tests (default labels of mm
unit) fail, especially any that utilize labels in map units. In your
forthcoming detailed description of changes you mentioned, could you add
some info on what may have changed with regards to output resolution?

Sorry, I haven't read all previous list threads concerning your work yet.

I'm going to go back to a 2.2 build and work on a semi-complete suite of
labeling tests. Then, port the unit tests and control images to master, so
we can see the differences between then and post-multi-threading commits.

For now, labeling output is ~90% broken, resolution-wise, across all
outputs.

Regards,

Larry

hmmm that is a real bugger.  Yeah I think kind of thing warrants a bug fix
release.  This will kill QGIS for most users who do data entry, which is

The workaround for this is to have the identify dialog docked which will
stop it opening over the top.   I have hidden mine behind the browser dock
so it doesn't show up all the time.

Regis, did you try use the @pyqtSlot(your types) decorator for your slot?
Often a slot getting called twice is because the signal is emitted twic 
with different signatures.

Hi List,
Just an observation but the weekly builds -
http://qgis.org/downloads/weekly/ - don't seem to have built for the last
couple of weeks. Are they still meant to be getting built or has something
gone wrong?

They're a good way around the myriad issues I seem to perpetually have with
the OSGeo4W installer.
Cheers,

I do not think that changing the individual pieces of code to
explicitly support the datum transforms is the way to go. It would be
very hard to make sure that all occurrences of datum transforms behave
properly just in QGIS itself, not speaking about python plugins.
Handling of datum transforms is a more complicated topic that not
everybody understands, so not having consistent behavior all across
QGIS will lead to an endless stream of problems for users who would
try to take advantage of datum transforms. I believe we need a
systematic approach where the the datum transforms will just work
without extra effort from the developer - this would maybe limit some
functionality (just one possible datum transform for a pair of
source-destination CRS), but it will _always_ give correct results.

For example, the saving of vector layers (QgsVectorFileWriter) has
been enhanced to support datum transforms, but there are dozens of
occurrences in QGIS tree which do not use it and therefore they may
end up writing incorrect results. And that is just one utility
class...

To me it sounds like an acceptable limitation to support just one
particular datum transformation at a time for one project. It may
bring some inconvenience for some users, but it seems that it is
better to clearly know the limitations rather than quietly doing wrong
transformations. The users can still explicitly reproject the data to
the destination CRS to overcome such limitation.

Martin

Hi,

Solved it myself. Finally I inherited from the QgsXXXRendererV2 and
overrided the startRender() method in order to modify the renderContext to
meet my project needs. This is not a perfect solution, but it works for me
as the layers I want to render are quite small and it does not become in an
overhead.

Thanks anyway.

Cheers.

Hello all, and sorry for cross-posting,

Hamish, Dustan and I have the great pleasure to announce that OSGeo has
been accepted once again as a mentoring organization to the Google
Summer of Code program [0]! Have a look at the great variety of OSGeo
and guest software projects listed on the main OSGeo ideas page on the
wiki - it will be another diverse, lively patchwork of open geospatial
toolsets [2].

What to do now?

- Would-be mentors: have a look at Mentors Guide, discuss with previous
years' mentors for guidance and wait for more instructions on how to
register. All links and info will be available shortly at [1]

- Would-be students: talk with the developers of your preferred
software project(s) and start working on your proposals. Have a look at
the Ideas pages for inspiration [2].

- All: feel free to discuss on soc mailing list on how to improve this
year's SoC, and add your ideas to the wiki [3]

Next item in calendar: Student application period opens -  March 10 at
19:00 UTC [4].

For any question that is not listed in the FAQs [5], just ask on soc
list.

Yes.  qgis.org space is constantly low - space freed by moving stuff off to the
new server is quickly used up by other stuff (probably the new website and
documentation).

I'm going to move the packaging of the weekly snapshot of qgis-dev in osgeo4w
to the new server too - but there still needs to be room on qgis.org to host
the results...

I think it would be better to remove the towgs84 parameters for the 
ellipsoids where there is no clear choice, and offer to set the datum 
transformation, but I agree it is hard to go about it in a user-friendly 
way.

In my case, the coefficients offered for Beijing54 ellipsoid come from  
different sources and only cover a small area each. This ellipsoid is 
only used in China and there is no official list of coefficients to 
transform (CRS are kind of an important secret in China, which does not 
really make sense ...).

I was thinking of improving the custom CRS entry further by splitting 
the proj4 definition in a gui. In that case, datum transformation could 
be a part of it, or near it. I agree this will not be used by most 
users, but still, it would be better for the few end users who need it. 
Anyway, I don't have a lot of time to code so my progress on these 
things is very slow ...

A 2.2.1 could come out after 1 week of no activity in the stable branch after
any activity.

If it takes 4 months to get to that state (ie: nobody pushes a fix for that
or more than one fix a week gets committed weekly) then no 2.2.1 would ever
come out.

There are going to be a few other bugs, hopefully fixed in 2.2, so
eventually a point release will be worthwhile. With (semi-)automated builds
it's not *that* much trouble I think.

Please try to erase those plugins completely from your environment and 
install again from the Plugins Manager.
I cannot reproduce this issue.

It is a surprise to me, openSUSE was the first distribution to have 
OpenJPEG v2 packaged in Factory...
Plus, I can work with jp2 files in 13.1
Can you please provide a jp2 file that fails for you so I can test?

Hi Martin

I still think this limitation is not acceptable. Datum transformation is 
a very approximate thing. Some transformation are well suited for 
particular areas, but not for others. So you can easily have several 
layers using different transforms in one project.
And don't forget that QgsCoordinateTransformCache is used by one server 
instance. We have hundreds of projects on qgiscloud. We cannot force all 
of them to use the same datum transformations.


Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco, 
thanks for having me discover this.  
In fact, the signals I catch are triggered by my own slot ;-). 

Following what I have seen in pyqSlot doc , I'm not sure decorating
QgsVectorLayer.AttributeValueChanged is so simple, because last argument is
variant.. I don't know how to define this varying type in python style. I
get either float, unicode or int object there.. 

Cheers
R?gis

Yes, it was the original behaviour to always ask the user, however it 
was considered as not user friendly.

Even in Switzerland, where it seems to be a clear choice (one CRS for 
the whole country), the default towgs84 parameters of the national crs 
are only accurate one digit behind the dot. So choosing the 
transformation with an accuracy of three digits behind the dot in the 
datum transform dialog makes a well visible difference.

Marco

shouldn't there be a tag 'backport' tag in the tracker to identify critical
tickets that warrant a backport to stable branch, so if someone has the
time can backport those fixes?

 I think the problem comes from the plugin's repository XML : for my "layer
combinations" plugins, the metadata file sets version=1.01, but the
plugin's current version is displayed as 1.1 (both in QGIS's plugin manager
and on http://plugins.qgis.org).

So, the plugins stays marked as "upgradable"... I'm not sure on where to
file tickets for that (since it's probably not in QGIS itself)

Thanks !

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Node tool symbols
Message-ID: <530D9AE4.3080308@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Now that we are at the beginning of a new release cycle, can we discuss
a bit about the symbols used for node tool? I always found weird the
choice of colours (red for normal nodes, blue for selected ones, and
green for errors). Maybe we could use a different scheme, e.g. green for
normal, yellow for selected, red for errors?
Also, the thick square seems too thick, compared to the rest of the
interface: perhaps a better one could be used?
Thanks.

Hi guys,
I noticed that qgis 2.3 (debian nightly repos, just updated) is not
working.
No problem to open qgis, but then, when loading any layer (raster or
vector) it crashes saying "segmentation error".

Someone else has the same problem? What can I do?

BTW: debian 7.3

Thanks to all

Matteo

I am sorry about that, but I am sure we can sort it out in the next
few days. Mathieu has done a great job testing post-MTR rendering and
reporting regressions, just today he has added #9661 and #9662 - maybe
these are the issues causing the tests fail.

The main change is that doing size/width calculations should get
simpler now, because the "scale factor" and "raster scale factor" are
now always equal to one (so we do not need to use them anymore) and
there is just one true DPI (instead of two DPIs - painter DPI and
scene DPI). I know that labeling had to do some voodoo to get the
rendering right, I remember updating that code, but maybe I missed
some pieces....

Message-ID: <CAHL0Nf897YHgFONpPK-f3-S4wen7sQF=j4BpnzozjDoOiVZsew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am working on a plugin and want to get a signal
when the
symbology
 of a vector layer is changed by the user. In the doc, there is a signal
that seems to fit (
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorLayer.html#a403f235d3743aa59bb3aad69a72a5705
)
.


I have
tried two
 method
s
called :

> QObject.connect(self.iface.activeLayer(), SIGNAL("rendererChanged()"),
> self.
> DoSomething)


I have also tried :

>  self.iface.activeLayer().rendererChanged.connect(self.
> DoSomething)


On os x mavericks nothing happens with the first method and for the second
I have a error :

> AttributeError: 'QgsVectorLayer' object has no attribute 'rendererChanged'


But on Debian, I can get the signal but just for the layer which is
selected when the plugin is run ; On the other layers, if I change the
color, nothing happens.

Regards,
Guillaume

Hi,

Note that you can also use an indirect function call when you connect
the signal, thanks to lambda. For instance :

myLayer.attributeValueChanged.connect( lambda : self.myslot(myLayer) )

I can't tell why, but you should use the second method as it is the new 
signal/slot connection style.

This is because iface.activeLayer() is the currently selected layer in 
the legend. [0]
If you want to do so, you might want to connect all layers by browsing 
them using:
iface.mapCanvas().layers() if you want all the displayed layers actually 
displayed in the map
or
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance(). mapLayers() if you want all the layers

Cheers,

Denis

Hi Paolo,

Go to layer properties -> fields
in the combobox on top (attribute editor layot) choose "drag an drop 
designer"

it might be hidden on the right if you previously reduced the splitter 
to its minimum.

tested now on master, I believe it's not different from 2.2.

Cheers,

Denis

Hi all.
Why exactly is using PostGIS so painful on a slow connection? I
understand that loading time is long, but I do not know why editing or
zooming should be so slow.
Any explanation? Better yet: any solution?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

Explanation:
Zooming and editing require loading of data (we don't cache much data 
locally)

Solution (partly):
* Activating server side simplification for such layers gives a 
noticeable speed boost here.
* Get a faster network ;)

You're right, sorry for the noise.
The fact that the dropdown is empty induced me in error: perhaps better
to fill it with the default value?
Thanks again.

Thanks for all the replies.
I tried with qgis --noplugin and it works fine, so the problem is related
to some plugin but which one?! :) I will try to find it out.

Hi,

As far as I know libpq does not support compression.

There is a lengthy discussion on libpq compression at
http://postgresql.1045698.n5.nabble.com/libpq-compression-td5712541.html

Message-ID: <530DE177.2030705@oslandia.com>

Hi,

I've spent some time with a strange issue.

The signal QgsComposition.composerMapAdded is supposed to carry the
QgsComposerMap object that has just been added to a composer.
Right, but when connecting this signal to a python slot, the argument
becomes a plain QObject ...
(connecting from something like iface.activeComposers()[i].composition())

I finally circumvented the problem in my plugin, but I can't understand
what is going on.
Is there something special to add to the .sip file in order for
arguments to be correctly passed ?

(using trunk with commit ab929a855c1)

To: qgis-developer <qgis-developer at lists.osgeo.org>


Hi all.
Now that we are at the beginning of a new release cycle, can we discuss
a bit about the symbols used for node tool? I always found weird the
choice of colours (red for normal nodes, blue for selected ones, and
green for errors). Maybe we could use a different scheme, e.g. green for
normal, yellow for selected, red for errors?
Also, the thick square seems too thick, compared to the rest of the
interface: perhaps a better one could be used?
Thanks.

Happy to report that following Martin's last commit (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/daf1e0b6881cdb77df6f6a9dc988ad92e0f9019d),
I cannot see any issues with vector/raster layer rendering, as well as
labelling. All renders like 2.2, except the user experience is 10 times
better :)

Larry, I'm pretty sure your labeling tests will mostly turn green now.

Some of the slowness is understandable, some not really, e.g. why
deactivating a layer in the legend should require time?
All the best.

Hi,

https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Application:Geo/qgis2

There is a "report bug" link in the above URL.

I will check it when I find some time later.

Best,

It sounds like the PostGIS connection provider could use some optimisations.

The Oracle provider had/has a few which are being resolved (thanks
Jurgen!), but it does first require identifying what queries are being run
during what actions. If you have access, watch what queries are running on
PostGIS when you perform actions within QGIS.

Looks like it should be pre-populated with "autogenerate" (or at least,
selecting that option does nothing so I guess it's "already" selected).

I've seen a couple of references to a "qgis-ux" list, however it's not
linked to on maillists list of the website:

Do you have many records in your viewport ?
Limiting the number of fetched records could also in those cases,
but I'm not sure there's an UI option for that (I remember Larry
adding it for labels for performance reasons).

I'm pretty sure there are many cases of unneeded refresh.
You notice a lot while playing with big topologies... even
in a loopback network.

I'd suggest to file a ticket for each case of that sort.

that's a case where the render-cache should work. When deactivating a
layer, QGIS will just redraw all remaining visible layers. In case the
render-cache was active it would just draw the layers from the cache.

Unfortunately the render cache introduced issues and did not work well
with certain data providers (e.g. WMS). That's why I do not use it
currently.

Maybe Martin could comment if the idea of the render-cache is still
feasible or useful at all with the new multi-threaded renderer.

Hi list, 


I try to use the multiprocessing module in a plugin, in order to increase the calculation speed. 


I use the Poll class and the apply_async method with a function that use a layer: 
pool. apply_async(function, layer) 


But I have the following error: 
RuntimeError: super-class __init__() of type QgsFeature was never called 


Is there someone who has tried the multiprocessing module in Qgis? 


Thanks.

Thanks.
Would it be appropriate pointing out that deactivating a layer should
not load any data from the server? Seems reasonable to me.
All the best.

Fair enough to at least look at what's currently being done with the 
requested data and evaluating if it's appropriate (in every case) IMHO.

That means, please open a ticket and add information about the executed 
queries if possible.

Yes and no. :-)

The server and composer tests, and comparisons with canvas output ,seem to
pass OK now, but not so for the canvas [0]. Now, I don't know if it is the
unit test setup that needs updated to work with new QgsMapSettings or
something in PAL, so I have to do some investigation first.

Hmm. I didn't figure everything would go smoothly. :-)

Stripping out all the vector and raster scale adjustments from labeling
will be great.

But, the code removed in [1] is exactly the only thing that I thought I
would need to leave in. It is used to find the difference in dpi from a
native, local painter, versus the current render context. That is in turn
used by the drop shadow and other functions to make sure their output
matches the current painter's scale, since I leverage a local painter and
QPicture to generate the silhouette of the label component, which is the
basis for the drop shadow.

Do you know of a way to effectively copy the main painter to a local one?
Does the new renderer setup offer a means to duplicate the painter?

Might have to switch the whole operation over to using Qt 4.6+
QGraphicsEffect drop shadows for QGraphicItems (tried that first, but had
odd results). Could work better now with the new renderer setup.

I won't be able to verify the issues that removing the noted code produces
until I am done adding many more unit tests.

I'm looking at adding two more unit test rendercheckers: composer export to
PDF and SVG, then rasterize those back to PNG for comparing against
composer and canvas outputs. This means for every individual labeling unit
test, the following suite will be auto-generated:

Self-comparisons
* canvas (done)
* server (done)
* composer image (done)
* composer PDF
* composer SVG

Cross-check comparisons
* server vs. canvas (done)
* composer image vs. canvas (done, but has double anti-aliasing issue)
* composer PDF vs. composer image [and canvas?]
* composer SVG vs. composer image [and canvas?]

All outputs that support different resolutions should also have suites
associated with a likely range that may expose issues, e.g. 72, 150, 300
dpi. Needless to say, many of these tests will have varying allowable
tolerances, given font differences across platforms.

The focus, at least for me, is to have the unit tests point towards glaring
issues with QGIS code, not precisely solve cross-platform font issues nor
have all output match cross-platform. Ideally, they should help ensure
user's output is generally WYSIWYG in day-to-day usage.

For rendering PDF back to PNG for cross-checking, I am looking at muPDF and
poppler libs [2], both recommended by the Qt project [3]. There is also
pdf2image [4], but that depends upon ghostscript.

It should be safe to use render cache now in master branch, even with WMS.

Paolo: make sure you have render caching turned on. Deactivating (and
activating again) a layer should be immediate. Of course, if you pan
the map or zoom in/out, everything will be re-rendered.

Hi Martin,


Do you think setting the destination CRS for QgsMapSettings should
automatically update its map units?

i.e.,

void QgsMapSettings::setDestinationCrs( const QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem&
crs )
{
  mDestCRS = crs;
  setMapUnits( crs.mapUnits() )
}

Or, are the two considered mutually exclusive?

Turns out I just had to rebuild the TestQgsPalLabeling base test class to
utilize QgsMapSettings (instead of deprecated QgsMapRenderer methods) [0]
and ensure to set the correct map units for the CRS. Canvas tests now match
2.2 control images within a 0 - 6 pixel tolerance [1].

Close enough for me!

Uh, sorry, I got it a bit wrong, let me put it correct it what are the
main rules now when rendering map:

1. QPainer's coordinate system is always in paint device's raw pixels.
That means, in canvas a line with width 1 will be one pixel wide, in
composer it will be one dot wide. (In 2.2 the coordinate system would
be either in pixels or milimeters)

2. the "raster scale factor" is always equal to one - and thus does
not need to be used anymore because it will not make any difference
(in 2.2 it has to be used for proper scaling, especiall in composer
output)

3. the "scale factor" is always equal to number of device's raw pixels
per millimeter. To draw a line with width 2 mm you would use "2 *
scaleFactor". (In 2.2 the scale factor did not have a clear physical
meaning

4. there is just one true DPI - painter's DPI is equal to map settings
DPI (In 2.2 these are DPIs are not always the same - especially not in
composer output)

5. there is no forced scale in composer anymore - the scale calculator
is set up properly (In 2.2 the map scale is forced by composer as the
scale was calculated from different values)

If you intend to do drawing with symbols, then yes, it makes sense to
scale the painter from millimeters to dots and then setup the raster
scale factor (=1) and scale factor (=DPI/25.4) as noted above and
things should just work..

Let me know if you have any problems.

Good question :-)

The logic says that CRS selection should automatically imply what map
units will be used. Right now there is also the possibility that
on-the-fly projections are not turned on and the map units have to be
set manually by the user. Then there are measure settings related to
that in some ways and it is all a bit messy (I think we need to do
some updates to the project properties dialog and better understand
what are the reasonable combinations). In QgsMapRenderer the map units
and destination CRS were kept separately (maybe for historical
reasons?) so I kept it like that also in QgsMapSettings.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Spatial index - what about having it automatically
 created and updated ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO5DtK-AKz+Ryu_Dq=YkBBiJbTx_E2Mb4QdCgGbAw7G8Kg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I have some concerns about spatial indexes in QGIS. Spatial indexes are
very usefull, and for me rather mandatory as soon as you deal with more
than 100 features.


I would like to share some ideas about them :

1) Extend QGIS so that it can create spatial indexes for more vector
format. If I am correct, for now only Shapefiles and Database vector layers
can have a spatial index created by QGIS . Why not for GeoJson, CSV files,
etc ?

2) If possible, create a spatial index for each vector layer added to the
canvas if no one is already present. Since it is a quite fast operation,
the small time needed is worth it.

3) If possible, update the spatial index (replace the old qix by a new one)
every time the vector layer is updated. No need to do so for database
layers, but this can be very usefull for big shapefiles. I have seen some
people creating a spatial index, then as time passes, they add more and
more data into the shapefile but forget to update the spatial index.
Sometimes this can lead to some data not displayed in QGIS because QGIs
seems to rely on the outdatedSpatial index.

For me, using spatial indexes is like brushing my teeth : I do it very
often without even thinking of it. But many users do not know that spatial
indexes exists, or do it but forget to use them as needed. I really think
QGIS should help them to improve perfs in the background.

Michael

The create spatial index functionality is handled by data provider -
in this case GDAL/OGR - at some point it was available only for
shapefiles, not sure if anything changed since then.

I am not sure this is the right thing to do it automatically. It could
however suggest it for large layers for better performance.

Doesn't OGR handle the update of the spatial index automatically?

I guess more better is to use this extremely simple batch and create all
the index in one step only.
sing the gdal/ogr from osgeo4w.

 As I said, I am thinking of non power users. They surely won't create nor
use such a batch file, even if it is simple. I know there is also the great
tool Vector / Data management tools / Create Spatial Index, which can
create one for all layers in one step. But users do not use it : they do no
know it exists, or they know but forget to use it.

Hi,

I just tested this behaviour with the Windows standalone build 2.2.0-1.

With shapefile layers, the combobox is filled with "auto generated". But
with PostGIS layers, the combobox is filled by default with "drag and
drop". So if the option "Open the form if only one feature is selected" is
checked, the form open with nothing inside it...

Can someone else confirm it?

Thanks.

R?mi

It could be an option, but I did not think it is worth it as the spatial
index is fast to create. I agree we could detect if the layer is large and
do it only in this case.

I do not know, I should do some more research...  This would be great

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Atlas export Python script not working in 2.2
Message-ID: <1393499964408-5106328.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello, 

I am having a bit trouble migrating a script to QGIS 2.2. 

In QGIS 2.0 I have the following Python script which will load a composer
from template, generate an atlas and export to image. 

        myFile = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), template)
        myTemplateFile = file(myFile, 'rt')
        myTemplateContent = myTemplateFile.read()
        myTemplateFile.close()
        myDocument = QDomDocument()
        myDocument.setContent(myTemplateContent)
        myComposition.loadFromTemplate(myDocument)

        # Get map composition and define scale
        myAtlasMap = myComposition.getComposerMapById(0)
        myAtlasMap.setNewScale(int(scale))

        # Setup Atlas
        myAtlas = QgsAtlasComposition(myComposition)
        myAtlas.setCoverageLayer(atlas_desktop)
        myAtlas.setComposerMap(myAtlasMap)
        myAtlas.setFixedScale(True)
        myAtlas.fixedScale()
        myAtlas.setHideCoverage(False)
        myAtlas.setFilterFeatures(True)
        myAtlas.setFeatureFilter("reference = '%s'" % (str(ref)))
        myAtlas.setFilterFeatures(True)
        print myAtlas.composerMap()

        # Generate atlas
        myAtlas.beginRender()
        for i in range(0, myAtlas.numFeatures()):
            myAtlas.prepareForFeature( i )
            jobs = r"\\myserver\a folder\Jobs"
            job_fol = os.path.join(jobs, str(ref))
            if not os.path.exists(job_fol):
                os.makedirs(job_fol)
            output_jpeg = os.path.join(job_fol, ref + "_BMS_plan.jpg")
            myImage = myComposition.printPageAsRaster(0)
            myImage.save(output_jpeg)
        myAtlas.endRender()
        if os.path.isfile(output_jpeg) is False:
            QMessageBox.warning(self.iface.mainWindow(), "Uh Oh!",
"Something went wrong, no image exported!")
            return
        else:
            return

In QGIS 2.2 this script is no longer working correctly. The template is
loaded and a map is exported to image, however, the map does not display the
correct area. The map area draws the correct layers but the extent is wrong
(no where near the feature from the atlas). Had a look at the documentation
and wasn't really able to see what has changed/deprecated? 

Thanks
Matt

Hello matt,

That must have to do with the fact that now it's possible to control more
that one map extent with atlas, that means that for each map item you need
to check the control by atlas option.

The same probably applies to the python scripts.

Hope I helped,

Alexandre Neto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Incosistencies in QGIS Mapserver's GetFeatureInfo
	WMS responses
Message-ID: <CAKeJj68HsgghgwApeyi-ygs1Wjc5nCUGYxA0_vaNGSFjg6u6iA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I found some inconsistencies in QGIS Mapserver in GetFeatureInfo WMS
responses in GML format:

Identification by point coordinates (X/Y or I/J parameters):
------------------------------------------------------------
 - returns geometry data of every feature in layer's CRS only if 'Add
geometry to feature response' in project settings is checked
 - returns bounding box of every feature in layer's CRS only if 'Add
geometry to feature response' in project settings is checked
 - doesn't returns global bounding box of all matched features collection

Searching by attributes (FILTER parameter)
------------------------------------------
 - always returns geometry data of every feature in layer's CRS
 - always returns bounding box of every feature in layer's CRS
 - always returns global bounding box of all matched features collection in
requested CRS (SRS/CRS parameter), but this value (whole XML element) is
correct only for text/xml format, because bounding box value is computed
only for text/xml format, but it's XML element is included in server
response regardless of concrete XML output format.


I'm able to fix these issues and prepare pull request(s). This is my
suggestion:
 - return geometry data of every feature in requested CRS only if 'Add
geometry to feature response' is checked
 - return bounding box of every feature in requested CRS only if 'Add
geometry to feature response' is checked
 - return global bounding box of all matched features collection in
requested CRS only if 'Add geometry to feature response' is checked, and in
proper XML element depending on output format - <BoundingBox
CRS="EPSG:4326" maxx="1" minx="-1" maxy="1" miny="-1"/> for text/xml and
<gml:boundedBy><gml:Box srsName="EPSG:4326"><gml:coordinates cs="," ts="
">-1,-1 1,1</gml:coordinates></gml:boundedBy> for GML format.

Hello,

Yes.
You should now call QgsComposerMap.setAtlasDriven(True) and set your
scale preferences (fixed or margin) on each composer map.

Old functions are marked as deprecated.

That's a python plugin (ftools), so it may not be available to everyone.

Better to do it natively (in the data provider) doing something like
OGR_DS_ExecuteSQL("CREATE SPATIAL INDEX ON tablename [DEPTH N]") - untested

I think it's a great idea to do this automatically with large ogr data
sources

as you said you should probably ask the gdal-dev list about which drivers
support spatial index creation an automatic update.

there is already a function QgsOgrProvider::createSpatialIndex() (for
shapefiles only) which  is called by QgsOgrProvider::syncToDisc() if the
spatial index already exists.

Create or updte a spatial index in a table is a danger operation ..
So in postgis it is availabale only to user with write grant.

QGIS is unable to understand if a connection is readonly or write enable so
try to do an automatic update
is a trouble-matic operation if a table was open from a read-only user.

Another question is why it should be complex for an user to create an index
?

A second question is what kind of index ?
On postgis is possible to do more than one index.

A table could have more than one geometry and every one could have a
spatial index or not.
But an index is a space consuming and often the index is needed on 1 only
geometry field menawhile the other
geometry field are only for special uses.
To do always automatically a spatial index on every geometry filed is
really a not useful operation in these use-case.

Thanks for the pointers Alexandre and Hugo.

I have tried setting myAtlasMap.setAtlasDriven(True) which still produces
the same results. 

I have found that myAtlas.numFeatures() returns 0, which is strange because
when i run the script (with no feature filter on) it clearly iterates over
the entire the atlas layer. 

I am thinking it might be something to do with the atlas render? 

I have also tried setting myComposition.setAtlasMode(True) and
myAtlas.setEnabled(True) to no avail.

I think it is myComposition.setAtlasMode( QgsComposition.ExportAtlas )

You can have a look at test units in :
tests/src/python/test_qgsatlascomposition.py (which ... apparently are
failing now ...)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Timer issues with threaded rendering on Windows
Message-ID: <a58d72c99f15be99bd5a12787dcd289e@carto.net>

Hi,

I am testing the threaded rendering on Windows 7, 64bit. Unfortunately, 
I often get "hangs" and in the log I get messages like:

...
QObject::startTimer: timers cannot be started from another thread
QObject::killTimer: timers cannot be stopped from another thread
...

QGIS than hangs for a couple of seconds until I can navigate again. This 
happens quite often.

I also notice there is a considerable lag between the rendering of 
features and the labeling.

My data is in Postgis, the server in the same LAN.

Any idea on what may be wrong?

Thanks,
Andreas

And when you click on "Create Spatial Index" in layer properties.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Calculating acreage in 2.2
Message-ID: <530F6F2D.7030307@northrivergeographic.com>

I think I may have found a bug....or I'm just slightly confused.

I'm working on a client job (digitizing forestry stands) and I need to 
calculate acres of the final area. The data I'm working with is in 
EPSG:2274. So I create a field that is decimal (width 20, precision 5) 
and in the field calculator I use $area/43560 - (there are 43560 square 
feet in an acre). My result is one decimal off - instead of 195.30 acres 
I have 19.53 Acres. I've done this enough to where I'm questioning every 
button push. If I divide by 4356 I get the correct number. I'm currently 
doing this in Windows 7 OSGEO install QGIS 2.2.

Anyway - can someone tell me I'm crazy...or not crazy. Projections are 
set correctly...cat has remained off the keyboard etc.

Randy

I'm going to plead insanity. I'm having the most inconsistent 
"calculating" day ever. I'm going for a walk and then try this again. In 
some instances things are off as described below. In others I get the 
correct results. This happened yesterday and today. In others it works 
fine. I built a grid and in some cases got the normal square footage - 
in others it was off. In all cases I've only used tools within QGIS.

Below is the data. I open it in QGIS, edit, and use the formula $area / 
43560. Projection is EPSG:2274 . I can't make this calculate correctly 
in my OSGEO install of QGIS 2.2. I do this on Ubuntu 12.04 QGIS 2.2 and 
it comes out right.

location is here to the data:
/northrivergeographic.com/documents/eshleman-022714.zip

Sorry if I'm unnecessarily causing you guys distress. I do appreciate 
the work you all are doing - 2.2 is an excellent piece of software. Even 
if I have to confirm I want to remove data from the view (ha).

Ha!!

I'm not sure exactly what is going on. I just set out another email and 
I can't get this one data layer I've created to calculate correctly. I 
chalked up the one yesterday to fat fingering the acreage. Today - I've 
done this quite a bit it's consistently wrong. Linux - it's right. I'm 
going to reboot. Go for a walk. Come back and try again.

I'm going to do a series of tests to reinforce it's me - I've done some 
things but I haven't been consistent between platforms.

This cat isn't sneaky but sleeps on my desk....

A couple of points:

- first, make sure you are using the QgsAtlasComposition which is created
by the composition, rather then creating a new one.  Ie,
myAtlas = QgsAtlasComposition(myComposition)

Should be:
myAtlas = myComposition.atlasComposition()

Then, as Hugo mentioned, you need to activate the atlas by calling:

> I think it is myComposition.setAtlasMode( QgsComposition.ExportAtlas )
>

You should be good to go after this.

While QgsAtlasComposition::setComposerMap and setFixedScale, etc have been
deprecated, they should still work OK. As mentioned earlier, the new way is
to set these properties directly on the QgsComposerMap by setAtlasDriven
and setAtlasFixedScale.

+1 to this, the python tests are a good way to see examples of the qgis api
in action. I suspect they are failing either due to platform specific font
rendering issues or due to MTR changes. I'll take a look at these in the
next couple of days.

this is a feature iterator [0], so you need iterate

f = QgsFeature()
toSelect = []
while i.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterExpression(' "LWFLAGS" 
!= \'P\') ).nextFeature(f):
     toSelect.append(f.id())
i.setSelectedFeatures(toSelect)

We can make that even easier:

toSelect = []
for feature in layer.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest('"LWFLAGS" != \'P\'')):
     toSelect.append(feature.id())
layer.setSelectedFeatures(toSelect)

Hi Marcel

Thanks for spotting this issue, it will be good to have a consistent 
behaviour with / without filter and for all output formats.

Adding geometry / bounding box has been done for showing rubberbands and 
for handling search results (zoom to features that match the filter). 
Therefore, the bounding boxes need to be included even if 'add geometry 
to feature response' is not checked. The added bounding box was meant 
for cases where the geometry data should be kept private, but searching 
should be possible.

I agree with the other points, please prepare a pull request.

Regards,
Marco

The warnings should be fixed now (2081fc). Please check again if you
still have hangs.

This is because first you get the layers rendered, after that the
labeling is started (especially with polygons the labeling may take
quite some time compared to rendering). Or is the total time
noticeable longer with master than with 2.2 ?

Hi all.
I'm testing make valid on a sample of real data. It effectively cleans
up all the topology errors, as found by the Topology Checker plugin, but
geometry errors as found by the Vector --> Geometry Tools --> Check
geometry validity tool are left untouched.
I'd appreciate an explanation on this difference; probably we should add
it to the manual, and warn the user about it.

Hi,

After playing a little bit with the new 1-n relations (very powerful), I
wondering why there is not a save button next to the toggle edit button,
like in the edit toolbar. For now, if we want to save a child, we need to
close the edition and accept the changes.

Don't you think it will be better to have the same behaviour as in the
standard edit process?

Hi R?mi,

I agree, this button could be added if there is a demand for it (and it 
seems that there is, as you are missing it :) )

For now, I see an even more annoying bug. If you change something in an 
embedded form, these changes are not automatically written to the edit 
buffer when you click the toggle edit button, but instead you need to 
close the embedded form (that means: switch to the form of another 
related feature or close the attribute form) before you are able to 
save the edits to the datasource itself. As soon as you have done that 
you should be able to click the toggle edit button in the embedded form 
to save the edits (Will turn off edit mode of course).

I was also wondering if this kind of auto-commit-to-edit-buffer is 
expected by the user or if users rather expect some kind of action they 
need to take in order to commit stuff to the edit buffer (as in the 
feature form, where you confirm with ok or decline with cancel). The 
situation will hopefully improve with the next release (if I find the 
time for it...) as the feedback in terms of color changes (red for 
changed-but-not-yet-commited features) in the feature list will only be 
updated as soon as the user actually changed the contents of the form.

Best
Matthias

Nobody else has this issue?

Because of it, when I add a feature in a PostGIS layer, the form is empty
because by default the form is set as "drag and drop".

It's really annoying...

Thanks for your feedbacks.

R?mi

We can make that even easier:
toSelect = []
for feature in layer.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest(??LWFLAGS? != \?P\?')):

     toSelect.append(feature.id())layer.setSelectedFeatures(toSelect)

    this is a feature iterator [0], so you need iterate

    

    f = QgsFeature()

    toSelect = []

    while i.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterExpression(?
    ?LWFLAGS? != \?P\?) ).nextFeature(f):

        toSelect.append(f.id())

    i.setSelectedFeatures(toSelect)

regarding how to implement saving SLD in spatialite i downgraded my
previous using simple text field... avoiding blob or XmlBlob (SL>4.1)

the reason is to allow more simpler interoparability reading back sld.
Using directly text I can read it's value directly. values are utf8
enconded and reading them outside qgis context (I received some comments
about this) it's simple to understand that text value has a locale coding.

- I decided to avoid sqlite blob because of to simplify interoperability
avoiding blob decoding step that it's less uman "natural"
- I decided to avoid XmlBlob format because it's available only with SL >
4.1. I plan to use this data type when SL 4.1 will be more used. At the
moment I preferred to allow this functionality available in all platform
and distribution in witch  qgis is available and in some of them (e.g.
debian wheezy, Ubuntu 13) SL 4.1 it's not packaged.
- I hope to add the same functions to the the new GeoPackage, but this it's
not still planned.

please let me know if there are comments

code is here:

Hello,



I had a GSoC idea (https://sites.google.com/site/foss4gku/projects/gsoc-feature-based-map-algebra) originally posted on OSGeo GSoC page but was told that I need to post it on QGIS GSoC site (http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Google_Summer_of_Code_2014). I don't know how I can add the idea to the QGIS GSoC site. I have students waiting for applying the idea, so any help is greatly appreciated.

I always use Spatialite or Postgis so I can run a DISTINCT function in a
query, or GROUP BY what should be unique and get a count (if it's > 1
it's not unique). I'm not aware of any other way to check for duplicate
data.

Hey Roberto,

All QGIS versions on Windows have ECW support.  I have installed QGIS using
the four different windows installers and they all have the full support.

I guess we had it for OS X too but I don't know enough about that platform.
