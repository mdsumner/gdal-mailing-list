The usage of Bing as TMS is now legal AFAIK. Using Google as TMS is against 
Googles Terms of Service. That's why the OpenLayer plugin uses OpenLayers 
(sic!) for Google layers, which complicates a lot of things.
BTW, the master branch of OpenLayers also uses TMS where (legally) possible, 
which solves most printing problems, etc.

I like the idea of promoting the QuickMapServices plugin instead of
the OpenLayers one, but I would go even further. This is a
functionality that would be good to have without having to install a
plugin, so why not making it a core plugin? (provided that it is
rather stable already and works fine). I am sure it would be a
welcomed addition to QGIS.

An entry in the Layer menu (something like "Add base layer") makes
sense to me, and it will solve the issue with the plugin name not
being too clear, as someone pointed out.

My 2 cents

I'm fine with having that kind of thing in core provided we don't breach
any terms of services, which would mean no Google unless we can find a
contact there and maybe make some kind of deal.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Trouble in construct attribute dialog
Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP25796FD85D20E9815D53609B9F00@phx.gbl>

Hello every one.
I’m now working on a personal GIS project, I want to use some features of QGis. Now I meet a wired thing that I can’t initialize the attribute dialog of a vector layer well, I’m writing to you to see if someone can help me. Thanks.

The code is simple, I paste them here

void qgis_dev::openAttributeTableDialog()
{
    QgsVectorLayer* mylayer = qobject_cast<QgsVectorLayer*>( activeLayer() );
    if ( !mylayer ) { return; }
    //qgis_devattrtableDialog* d = new qgis_devattrtableDialog( mylayer, this );
    // d->show();


    QgsVectorLayerCache* lc = new QgsVectorLayerCache( mylayer, mylayer->featureCount() );
    QgsAttributeTableView* tv = new QgsAttributeTableView();
    QgsAttributeTableModel* tm = new QgsAttributeTableModel( lc, this );

    QgsAttributeTableFilterModel* tfm = new QgsAttributeTableFilterModel( new QgsMapCanvas(), tm, tm );

    tfm->setFilterMode( QgsAttributeTableFilterModel::ShowAll );
    tm->loadLayer();
    tv->setModel( tfm );
    tv->show();
}

and the result is like this, there are no attributes in the form, but the feature count is right.



However, when I paste these code into QGis source code and compile the project, I get the right result. I don’t know where I am wrong.


Really hope to get some help.

Thank you!

Subject: [Qgis-developer]  Trouble in construct attribute dialog
Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP25858D197A6143906CDC44CB9F10@phx.gbl>

Hello everyone.

I’m now working on a personal GIS project, I want to use some features of QGis. Now I meet a wired thing that I can’t initialize the attribute dialog of a vector layer well, I’m writing to you to see if someone can help me. Thanks.

The code is simple, I paste them here

void qgis_dev::openAttributeTableDialog()
{
    QgsVectorLayer* mylayer = qobject_cast<QgsVectorLayer*>( activeLayer() );
    if ( !mylayer ) { return; }
    //qgis_devattrtableDialog* d = new qgis_devattrtableDialog( mylayer, this );
    // d->show();


    QgsVectorLayerCache* lc = new QgsVectorLayerCache( mylayer, mylayer->featureCount() );
    QgsAttributeTableView* tv = new QgsAttributeTableView();
    QgsAttributeTableModel* tm = new QgsAttributeTableModel( lc, this );

    QgsAttributeTableFilterModel* tfm = new QgsAttributeTableFilterModel( new QgsMapCanvas(), tm, tm );

    tfm->setFilterMode( QgsAttributeTableFilterModel::ShowAll );
    tm->loadLayer();
    tv->setModel( tfm );
    tv->show();
}

and the result is like this, there are no attributes in the form, but the feature count is right.

Really hope to get some help.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] before current layer change signal
Message-ID: <1790122501.6672621451833075715.JavaMail.httpd@webmail-21.iol.local>

Hi all,
Is there a event beforeChangeCurrentLayer in qgis api? i'm using qgis 2.8.5 version.
I would like to trigger Toggle Editing (if current layer is in editing mode) before change current layer.

Another question:
How can I "customize" Add Feature QMapTool (subclassing)  to add custom behaviour for click mouse event (for example print the coordinate of the first point) and leave the base behaviour as it is?

 

Thanks

Francesco

Hi all,
I agree in:
* reducing duplication, and having only one base layer plugin
* adding it to core
* renaming it to be better understandable to users.

So the issues are:
* do we agree that QMS is, from coding point of view, a better candidate
for inclusion?
* are the authors willing to take responsibility for its longer term
maintenance? If not, anyone else is willing to take it?

BTW, there are a number of older plugins adding individual services
(Korea, Sardegna, etc.); it would be good to incorporate these as
additional services too, or stimulate and help original authors to do
that, and deprecate original ones.

I'm available to help with this, if necessary.

All the best.

IMO it is much better to develop native TMS data provider.
In this case 3rd party plugins will be able to add TMS layers
as we already can do with WMS/WFS/etc. Also we will have
same mechanism to deal with layer objects.

Another +1.

I've got a vague recollection that someone filed a PR maybe 2 years or
so ago for a native c++ TMS provider... does anyone recall anything
about this?

Apparently you're trying to install qgis-plugin-grass.  As said the
qgis-plugin-grass only exists for distributions with GRASS6 and apparently the
last GRASS6 in unstable was available when QGIS 2.8.2 was current.

So that's what you're trying to install, but some of the other 2.8.2 are not
available anymore as they've meanwhile been replaced with 2.8.3/4/5.

liblwgeom was updated from 2.1.8 to 2.2-2 in unstable (and testing).  Fixed in
fdebde5.

Thanks for clarifying, and for fixing 2.13. Unfortunately it is not yet 
on nightly, we'll have to wait until tomorrow I guess (I cannot 
currently compile it because of the perl migration).
All the best.

Perl 5.22 has already migrated to testing, this shouldn't be an issue 
for building QGIS.

Oh, right, thanks - aptitude was refusing to install perl packages,
apt-get behaved better.
However, now installing the build deps results in an error:

aptitude install libgsl0-dev libqca2-plugin-ossl libqtwebkit-dev
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  libgsl0-dev libgsl0ldbl{a} libqca2-plugin-ossl libqtwebkit-dev
0 packages upgraded, 4 newly installed, 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded.
Need to get 1861 kB of archives. After unpacking 9388 kB will be used.
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 libgsl2 : Conflicts: libgsl0ldbl but 1.16+dfsg-4 is to be installed.

All the best.

Since the transition to GSL 2.x (https://bugs.debian.org/804246), you 
need to use libgsl-dev instead.

libgsl0-dev is provided by libgsl-dev in version 2.x, but the real 
libgsl0-dev package from GSL 1.x is also still in the archive because 
the transition hasn't been completed yet and was not coordinated by the 
gsl maintainer. APT prefers real packages over virtual packages, and 
picks the old libgsl0-dev as long as GSL 1.x hasn't been removed from 
the archive.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Thanks again Bas for explaining. I changed debian/control according to
your suggestion, and now compilation is running. Should the change be
pushed, or does interfere with other versions?
All the best.

The change is already included in QGIS (but may be not backported to 2.8 
yet).

To support building with both the GSL 1.x & 2.x the dependency to use 
is:

  libgsl-dev | libgsl0-dev

This prefers the new package over the old, using the latter only when 
the former is not available.

Bas

Message-ID: <CAN0onJhawVLGTbM9_4tbgGVK6dFGGkKf3OGgQAJ=uK3US8WuyQ@mail.gmail.com>

To whom it may concern,


first of all, I would like to present myself. I’m Mathieu
PELLETHIER-LANGLE, a French engineering student who takes part in a group
project which works on a software for the fire department. Our goal is to
propose them a cartographic interface allowing them to coordinate their
interventions on wildfires. That’s why, knowing the fact that QGis is Open
Source and offers most of the features we want to implement in our
software, we would like to use it as a working basis and modify it. Thus,
we would like to add some features, suppress all the features we don’t need
and recast the interface to make it simpler.

The point is, this software will have to be extremely ergonomic, the
interface simpler and more reactive, with only a few buttons, so we’ll have
to make many modifications. That’s why, knowing the fact that our
programming skills are pretty average and that we didn’t work the python
language during our studies, we wanted to ask you if you think this is
realisable or if we should better, instead of pruning a big software like
QGis, start from a much simpler software, easier to understand, and add the
features we want to it.


I already thank you for your consideration.

Hi Mathieu,

Have you had a look at QGIS Customization already?
http://linfiniti.com/2011/07/customizing-the-qgis-ui/
It's straightforward to optimize the interface without any programming
at all.

You may then use python only in a second step for whatever you need for
customized features.

Best regards,
Matthias

Hi all,
with current master, labels from the more dense layer (e.g.
municipalities) always cause the other labels (e.g. provinces) to
disappear, regardless of the priority I give. In previous versions it
worked as expected. Is this a bug, or am I missing something of the new
magic?
All the best, and thanks.

Oh, I see, there are now two priorities. I was using the second one, and
I was wrong. Sorry for the noise.

Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP910F9B478ACF2E796D7EB9B9F40@phx.gbl>

Hello all.

This is my third time to send this email to you, I can’t solve the problem, I really want someone can help me, thanks.

I’m now working on a personal GIS project, I want to use some features of QGis. Now I meet a wired thing that I can’t initialize the attribute dialog of a vector layer well, I’m writing to you to see if someone can help me. Thanks.

The code is simple, I paste them here

void qgis_dev::openAttributeTableDialog()
{
    QgsVectorLayer* mylayer = qobject_cast<QgsVectorLayer*>( activeLayer() );
    if ( !mylayer ) { return; }
  
    QgsVectorLayerCache* lc = new QgsVectorLayerCache( mylayer, mylayer->featureCount() );
    QgsAttributeTableView* tv = new QgsAttributeTableView();
    QgsAttributeTableModel* tm = new QgsAttributeTableModel( lc, this );

    QgsAttributeTableFilterModel* tfm = new QgsAttributeTableFilterModel( new QgsMapCanvas(), tm, tm );

    tfm->setFilterMode( QgsAttributeTableFilterModel::ShowAll );
    tm->loadLayer();
    tv->setModel( tfm );
    tv->show();
}

and the result is like this, there are no attributes in the form, but the feature count is right.



However, when I paste these code into QGis source code and compile the project, I get the right result. I don’t know where I am wrong.


Really hope to get some help.

Thank you!

HI all,

when looking at the code of the OWS providers I noticed possible
code duplication. There is a QgsOWSSourceSelect class [0, 1]
which is used only by WCS provider and OWS metaprovider. Other
providers, namely WMS and WFS use their own implementations
and have separate *.ui files.

Should we drop QgsOWSSourceSelect in favor of the specific
implementations or move all providers to use this class?

Message-ID: <CABaTiKL9P8Emt+bX=PzMy3yA0ko9ZGr4pquxbMfXY66=tiRKcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I've been trying to work out how to calculate screen width and height on
the canvas such as that used in the vector layer properties dialog under
labels and style (the QgsUnitSelectionWidget) and I'm having some trouble.
I.e. find a way to locate something X millimeters from the edge of the
canvas.

I can't seem to find the classes for these dialogs or the location of the
_ui files to work out how they've done it. Would somebody mind pointing me
in the right direction or giving me a heads up on the approach used (or
both) please?

I see that QPaintDevice has a widthMM() function, but I thought I read
somewhere that this is not platform independent and assume this isn't a
great idea?

Any help you could give would be much appreciated.


Thanks,

Duncan

A customer and I have some troubles with "DB Manager" and "Oracle". 
Every times we load an SQL query to layer, we get the log message:
* No key field for query given

To verify where the issue comes from, I wrote n python script to test 
loading an SQL query to layer with a keyColumn specified. I can load the 
SQL query.

I'd like to know if others have the same issue ?

I didn't know about QStandardItemModel, and I do'nt know if 
`uniqueFieldName = 
self.uniqueModel.item(self.uniqueCombo.currentIndex()).data()` well gets 
defined primary key in dlg_sql_window.sql

Hi,

If this panel opens (automatically) only in particular situations, do we
need it listed there? User, as I did, may want to activate it and be
confused for nothing.
Wouldn't it better to have it hidden and just make it appear when the user
is using the appropriate tool?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [QGIS-UX] What is "Discourage other labels
 from covering features in this layer" option in layer properties?

Hi,
I'd like to know what's the current state of this issue.
I've made a suggestion of design but it was before rule-based labeling
support. Anita asked for a mockup but I'm not sure I can efficiently design
one; so write some ideas

Currently, you can:
- label a layer and discourage labels from other layers to cover its
features
- discourage labels from other features to cover features of a not labeled
layer
But what if I want to label a layer and don't want to see labels from other
layers cover its features? I suppose I need to add it twice (a labeled one
and a "discouraged" one).

To improve the dialog and help fix the issue above, what about :
- adding at the top of the dialog a checkbox with "Discourage other labels
from covering features in this layer".
- and keeping in the current listbox : 'No Labels', 'Show labels for this
layer', 'Rule-based labeling'.
These two options will be independent from each other, meaning that you can
choose to "discourage other labels from covering features" (or not) for
either a labeled or not labeled layer.

(Thinking loudly)
Maybe the "Discourage other labels from covering features in this layer"
could be a checkable group box with the obstacles parameters moved inside.
However, I am not able to see how Obstacles features will behave in case of
rule-based labeling.

Subject: [Qgis-developer]    Trouble in construct attribute dialog
Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP89E74DBA267DEEDFCA0E72B9F50@phx.gbl>

Hello all

I’ve solved the problems by my self. After calling the QgsEditorWidgetRegistry::initEditor() method, I got the right attribute table. Sorry for bothering you. 
My original email is list below.


Hello all.

This is my third time to send this email to you, I can’t solve the problem, I really want someone can help me, thanks.

I’m now working on a personal GIS project, I want to use some features of QGis. Now I meet a wired thing that I can’t initialize the attribute dialog of a vector layer well, I’m writing to you to see if someone can help me. Thanks.

The code is simple, I paste them here

void qgis_dev::openAttributeTableDialog()
{
    QgsVectorLayer* mylayer = qobject_cast<QgsVectorLayer*>( activeLayer() );
    if ( !mylayer ) { return; }
  
    QgsVectorLayerCache* lc = new QgsVectorLayerCache( mylayer, mylayer->featureCount() );
    QgsAttributeTableView* tv = new QgsAttributeTableView();
    QgsAttributeTableModel* tm = new QgsAttributeTableModel( lc, this );

    QgsAttributeTableFilterModel* tfm = new QgsAttributeTableFilterModel( new QgsMapCanvas(), tm, tm );

    tfm->setFilterMode( QgsAttributeTableFilterModel::ShowAll );
    tm->loadLayer();
    tv->setModel( tfm );
    tv->show();
}

and the result is like this, there are no attributes in the form, but the feature count is right.



However, when I paste these code into QGis source code and compile the project, I get the right result. I don’t know where I am wrong.


Really hope to get some help.

Thank you!

Sorry

I missed some discussion or again was removed the link to the code in
the online API documentation?

we already had this discussion (more than 1year ago) and a lot of
developer expressed the need to have it online.

I was just browsing treying to browse tje code to find an eventual
problem exposed in qgis-user.

let me know

Hi Luigi,

I see "Definition at line XXX of file YYY" under each method
in the API docs. Both line number and file name are links to

Is this a side-effect of commit 13f4081 [1]?

The commit was only in relation to documentation coverage tests, we'll
probably require two different Doxyfiles to generate documentation on
travis and for the api doc.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Update Fields Selected Features.
Message-ID: <568E97BF.2070905@gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm trying to modify the values of some selected features. I have 
written this small script, but nothing happens when I run it. Is there 
something that I've missed? Here is my code.

/lyr = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer()//
//features = lyr.selectedFeatures()//
//
//lyr.startEditing()//
//lyr.updateFields()//
//for f in features://
//    fid= f.id()//
//    lyr.changeAttributeValue(fid,12,"0")//
//    lyr.updateFeature(f)//
//    print "elemento alterado"//
//
//lyr.commitChanges()/

Thanks per advance!!

Hi,

The second line reverts the changes from the first line here:

/    lyr.changeAttributeValue(fid,12,"0")//
//    lyr.updateFeature(f)/

Either use
/    lyr.changeAttributeValue(fid,12,"0")//
/or
//    f[12] = 0/
    lyr.updateFeature(f)/

Cheers
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Disable undo feature for user geometry edits
 within plugin / general undoStack() questions
Message-ID: <9BEAE41C5F3C764E84B78481B4AC2D7EAED535@STGV-BUS01.thinkwhere.local>

Hi,

I am writing a plugin that modifies a spatialite database in response to geometry edits made by the user.  The attribute table for the modified feature is modified when an item is added or edited, and additional tables within the database are updated with the new information.  The undo button does not revert the database changes (and can cause crashed in Linux), so I would like to prevent the user being able to use it.

So far, I have worked out how to disable the undo button (and shortcut) by disabling the corresponding action.  But when I connect that to a signal, it fires but the undo is still enabled, but with a different corresponding action.

So far I have a class that initiates on beginEditing whose contents include the following:

```
def __init__(self, iface, layer, db):
    ..... various lines here ....
    self.undo_stack = layer.undoStack()

def connect_signals(self):
    ....various lines here....
    self.undo_stack.indexChanged.connect(self.disable_undo_button)
    self.undo_stack.canUndoChanged.connect(self.disable_undo_button)
    self.undo_stack.cleanChanged.connect(self.disable_undo_button)
    self.undo_stack.undoTextChanged.connect(self.disable_undo_button)

def disable_undo_button(self):
    """
   Disable GUI undo buttons to prevent user trying to undo edits, which
    is prone to causing crashes.
    """
    print('Disabling undo button')
    actions_to_disable = ['&Undo', '&Redo']
    for action in self.iface.editMenu().actions():
        menu_item_action_text = action.text()
        if menu_item_action_text in actions_to_disable:
            action.setDisabled(True)
            print(id(action))
```

The disable_undo_button() function works, so it seems that another action is being added as the current undo without any of the signals that I am listening for being called.

- When is the final change made to the undoStack?
- Is there a signal that I can listen for to disable undo afterwards?
- or is there generally a better way to disable undo functionality?

Cheers
John

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Renewed call for funded work: Improvements to QGIS
	API Documentation
Message-ID: <AEF5784C-8EA9-44EE-BB6D-B9E1C39AC341@qgis.org>

Hi All

You may recall that last year we put out a call [1] for interested parties to apply if they were interested in being funded to improve the QGIS API documentation. In particular we are interested in making the API documentation more accessible to python programmers. Unfortunately the person who was selected to do the work is no longer able to do it and so we are reinitiating the call for applications. To do the work you should be capable of extending our doxygen based documentation (or willing to learn to do so) and should be comfortable with writing technical documentation and small code examples to be used in the documentation. If you feel that you are a good fit for this, please consider applying here using the form in [2] below.

Thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS save raster as rendered image,
	then use GDAL tools on it
Message-ID: <1452213154158-5244204.post@n6.nabble.com>

I posted this to Stackexchange, but have had no bites yet.

I have tried to use the code from
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/68803/qgis-save-raster-as-rendered-image?noredirect=1#comment207705_68803.
`i` is a raster layer:

    pipelayer = i
    pipeextent = pipelayer.extent()
    pipewidth, pipeheight = (pipelayer.width(),
                             pipelayer.height())
    piperenderer = pipelayer.renderer()
    pipeprovider = pipelayer.dataProvider()
    crs = pipelayer.crs().toWkt()
    pipe = QgsRasterPipe()
    pipe.set(pipeprovider.clone())
    pipe.set(piperenderer.clone())
    pipedFile = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(),
                             safeLayerName + '_pipe.tif')
    print pipedFile
    file_writer = QgsRasterFileWriter(pipedFile)
    file_writer.writeRaster(pipe,
                            pipewidth,
                            pipeheight,
                            pipeextent,
                            pipelayer.crs())
    
    in_raster = pipedFile
    prov_raster = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(),
                               'json_' + safeLayerName +
                               '_prov.tif')
    out_raster = dataPath + '.png'
    crsSrc = i.crs()
    crsDest = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(4326)
    xform = QgsCoordinateTransform(crsSrc, crsDest)
    extentRep = xform.transform(i.extent())
    extentRepNew = ','.join([unicode(extentRep.xMinimum()),
                             unicode(extentRep.xMaximum()),
                             unicode(extentRep.yMinimum()),
                             unicode(extentRep.yMaximum())])
    processing.runalg("gdalogr:warpreproject", in_raster,
                      i.crs().authid(), "EPSG:4326", "", 0, 1,
                      5, 2, 75, 6, 1, False, 0, False, "",
                      prov_raster)
    processing.runalg("gdalogr:translate", prov_raster, 100,
                      True, "", 0, "", extentRepNew, False, 0,
                      0, 75, 6, 1, False, 0, False, "",
                      out_raster)

It doesn't work, instead giving me the unstyled raster as final output. I
really don't understand the problem, because the output of `writeRaster`
(the file `pipedFile`) *is* styled, so the process from the answer linked to
above is working. It's just that when I try to use the output image to run
through GDAL's `warpreproject` and `translate`, it somehow reverts to the
unstyled raster.

What have I done wrong?

The Processing calls are inherited code. Does warpreproject have completely
the wrong arguments? If so, I don't know how it works at all.

The output of `translate` is *not* styled, and has no additional file.
However, since it's a PNG not a GeoTIFF, that's perhaps the explanation.

I've tried looking at the `expand` option of `translate`, but that gives me
image files which do not display in a web browser - I've not investigated
why.

However, the issue about column names not being recognized is still
there. Other csv files load fine.
Anyone confirms?

Message-ID: <568FC161.80905@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
if I choose a filename for the output of the new geometry repair core
plugin, and do not specify a file extension, I get a warning about the
layer being not editable, so I have to add (e.g. .shp) by hand.
This seems to me a small bug, correct?

BTW, neither GRASS nor Make Valid (the lwgeom plugin) succeed in fixing
these errors, as they simply throw away the polygons with errors.
Furthermore, lwgeom plugin seems not to be working (returning an empty
output layer) on 2.8, whereas it runs on >=2.12. Feedback would be welcome.
All the best.

Hi,

Im not on ubuntu - but not seeing this error on Mac/master. Where are you
seeing the error, in terminal when you launch the app, or in the python
console in QGIS? Is it preventing you from launching the app?

Presumably this is about: python/plugins/processing/tests/TestData.py

Message-ID: <CAFRwRH65-xQ8+fU1EKsr0UizQtFby0LH7r1j8+Rnqsc6+XTG-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
While debugging a qgis plugin written in python, we stumbled on a bug with
Python 274
apps\Lib\zipfile.py extract_member() ~ line 1056 that looks like it was
fixed in Python 275.
As the offending code was patched there, and our bug was fixed when we
patched
apps\Lib\zipfile.py with the code from the python 275 apps\Lib\zipfile.py
library.
See attached diff between the two python versions,side by side diff, and
some example
screen captures from our plugin failing to unzip a file in a 32 bit Windows
7 environment running qgis 2.8.5 LTR.

So with qgis Wien 32bit versions shipping with Python 274, 32 Bit users
can't use a plugin utilizing the
python 'zipfile' library to unzip a file. We can of course just copy
zipfile.py from a 64 bit qgis installation
and copy it to the appropriate location on the Win 7 32 machines...

qgis 32 bit windows version ships with Python 2.7.4 (our plugin breaks).
qgis x86-64 windows version ships with Python 2.7.5 (our plugin works fine).

We really just wanted to take some time to thank you folks for such a
useful gis application and pass along our finding, just in case other end
users might experience the same issue. And ask if there is a path forward
for the qgis 32 bit windows versions to be shipped with Python >=2.7.5?
Please let us know.

Some past history from python development regarding this bug:

https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/

Thank you again for such a useful gis tool.

Thanks in advance

It is this typical python plugin errror window.

I miss the "tests" directory in my install dir (which exists on another
machine). Anything special to set in cmake?

cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

The severity of the "Qt4's WebKit removal" bugreport in Debian has been
raised to serious (Release Critical), because a "new python-qt4 upload
with removed QtWebKit module will happen shortly".

QGIS will no longer build on Debian sid after this upload as long as it
requires Qt4's WebKit.

Bas

Hi,

According to the OSGeo Live schedule
https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Live_GIS_Disc#Schedule,
the next version 9.5 will be used at both FOSS4GNA and FOSSGIS
​ in May and July respectively.

​It currently contains 2.8 and the feature freeze on Feb 1st - so before
our next LTR ...

This means that workshops in July 2016 would lack 1.5 years of new features
:(

What do you think about this situation?

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Anita,

OSGeoLive 9.0 contained QGIS 2.8.x but for OSGeoLive 9.5 I have included
QGIS 2.12.x as you can see in the OSGeoLive nightly ppa:

https://launchpad.net/~osgeolive/+archive/ubuntu/nightly/+sourcepub/5877231/+listing-archive-extra

This will land in the next alpha/beta build...

Thoughts?

Best,
Angelos

​That's great Angelos, thanks!

I only checked https://github.com/OSGeo/OSGeoLive/blob/master/CHANGES.txt
and didn't see QGIS listed there.

Best wishes,

It should be fixed now in master. Could you try again and confirm that
it's solved?

Thanks!

OK, trying to simplify this, can anyone tell me if file locking is an issue
in this process? I am starting with a raster layer, and then want to run the
following in turn on it:

1. QgsRasterPipe.writeRaster()
2. processing.runalg("gdalogr:warpreproject")
3. processing.runalg("gdalogr:translate")

In each step, I am writing the output to a file, and then running the next
step on that file. In either the QgsRasterPipe step or either of the
processing gdal calls, do I need to do something to free up any locks held
on the intermediate files? Alternatively, can I pipe these processes
together to eliminate this as a consideration?

Hi SebDieBln (I've no your email)

I'm working for Boundless to add PKI authentication to postgres
provider. I see you did some work on it:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2473

This email is to share some instruments I did to allow a environmental
testing. I hope are useful for you and for all the community.

I'm developing qgis patches here (<- sorry SebDieBln ;) )
https://github.com/luipir/qgis/tree/postgis-pki

To allow a better testing env (integration test not unit test) I
prepared some docker data containers on the top of tim's
kartoza/postgis docker.
These containers allow to run a postgis container configured to accept
certified connections using test certs in:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/tests/testdata/auth_system/certs_keys

You can find this containers here (sorry again ;) )
https://github.com/luipir/Postgis-pki-datacontainers

eventually you can use this container to setup a certified connection
for you db manager patches.

Hi Luigi,

Would it make sense to start such a container on travis and run some
checks against it from the test suite?
This would allow for a very quick feedback if somebody cuts the wrong wire.

Best regards,
Matthias

I shared it also for this reason

I hope is well configured for the travis context... it's open to have
only ssl cert connection from every host.
It works till verify-ca but not vefiry-full because test server cert
is locked to "localhost" commonName only and docker instance use a
different ip.

enjoy these dockers and thanks to Time to share first ssl enabled
postgis docker.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Heads Up, Pull Requests and upcoming Feature Freeze
Message-ID: <5694D604.1050408@opengis.ch>

Hi everybody,

Feature freeze for QGIS 2.14 is just a couple of days ahead. As of the
15.1.2016 no more features will be merged until the upcoming version is
branched at the 26.2.2016.

**Core developers**

please go through your pull requests so we do not miss out on nice
features and are left with an unnecessary long pull request queue for
the next release.

You can check what your pull requests are at

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls -> Filter

If you need more information, ask for it. If you don't feel responsible,
assign somebody who is more responsible.

**Contributors**

If there has been no activity on your pull request in a while and you
would like to have it merged, please kindly ask the reviewer for
feedback and ask for the requirements to get your pull request ahead.

Thanks to everybody for helping to make QGIS 2.14 an amazing release!

Kind regards
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [QGIS-UX] What is "Discourage other labels

Hi,
About rule-based labeling, it just needs to put the "Discourage other
labels from covering features in this layer" frame inside the "Rule
properties" dialog, so that obstacles is also applied at rule level.
I open an issue report at https://hub.qgis.org/issues/14089

Hi,

wasn't there once a vertex editor available along with a CAD digitizing 
mode - that was pulled out of version 2.12 because it wasn't fully mature?

Is this still not put back into master? I can't seem to find it.

Thanks for your information,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Authentification use from Python
Message-ID: <5694E7EF.7090501@jena.de>

Hi all,

my goal is that my users do not save their PostgreSQL passwords in clear 
text but that they use the new Authentification system to do so. For my 
plugins I would need access to the PostgreSQL username and password, 
though. Is this generally possible in spite of security considerations 
as mentioned in the QGEP? If yes, how would I do it?

what I have so far is:
<code>
am = QgsAuthManager.instance()
myAuthMethodConfig = am.availableAuthMethodConfigs()[mykey]
myAuthMethodConfig.configMap() # returns an empty dict :-(
</code>

QGIS 2.12.2

any help appreciated

regards

Bernhard

Hi Luigi,

many thanks! That was the key.

I now have
<code>
am = QgsAuthManager.instance()
myAuthMethodConfig = QgsAuthMethodConfig()
am.loadAuthenticationConfig(mykey,myAuthMethodConfig,True)
myAuthMethodConfig.configMap()
</code>

Hi Bernhard,

Please note that the Python support for direct access to the credentials
via the auth method config *may* be completely removed for security
reasons.

Ideally, the expansion of credentials within a given auth method config
would only be done within the core application and connection methods
(HTTP, etc.) would be offered through a Python API. In this way an authcfg
token can be passed in and the connection established without access to
credentials.

However, such support and an API are not currently available. It is simple
enough to add to QgsNetworkAccessManager for HTTP[S] connections, but not
so simple for other types of connections, e.g. database via a library or
client. Once completed this means a plugin would not be able to access the
credentials and pass them on to a different connection method, e.g. Python
HTTP lib, etc.

Once such an API is available (or even now, with some work), plugins could
be 'authorized' by the user for access to credentials using revocable
access tokens or signed/revokable certificates.

Until then, the continued Python access to the auth system credentials
means security is not good for the user. It should be considered for
deprecation or just complete removal in 2.14 release.

Message-ID: <CA+0HqqawWmmXW55347vUjBCLMsHObGwERLVHA6KwxP3jFvsY4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi. I'm working on a plugin for the Composer, but it seems that few people
are interested in this aspect of QGIS, so I rarely get answers to my
difficulties on stackexchange (
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/174648/how-to-use-itemchanged-signal-to-update-data
).

I need to to call a function when I move one of the QgsComposerItems on the
composer. For example a QgsComposerLabel that is already placed on the
composer and whose variable name is *label1*, this code

def setCoordText():

    label1.setText(str(label1.x()) + "," + str(label1.y()))

label1.itemChanged.connect(setCoordText)


should show the x and y numbers of the label's new location. However this
only works if the label is moved AND then is put back with an UNDO command.
It is as if the signal is triggered by the Undo command, but not the move
itself. Can anybody help me with this? Thank you

Hi Andreas,

The goal was to integrate CAD tools at the same time as circular string.
It was merged unfinished shortly before feature freeze (2.12) and thus 
reverted.

With some comunities, we will be contracting a developper in a very 
short time to start this development again. It will be merged after 2.14.
It will bring some changes in the behavior (click-click), so at the end 
it might be a better idea to wait for 3.0.

Best wishes,
Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help with projections
Message-ID: <5695FBB3.70200@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
during courses, a frequent question is how to find the correct
projection for layers without a .prj or similar.
An interesting approach is this: http://projfinder.com/
IMHO it would be useful, probably not too difficult, to implement it in
QGIS. I'm thinking of an extension of the current dialog showing off
when loading a non georeferenced layer; adding the logic and listing the
likely EPSG for the layer would be a great improvement.
Worth a ticket? Any taker?
All the best.

Hi Larry,

thanks for pointing these things out, however I am not sure how to continue.

My situation is as follows: I have some 100 users that connect to our 
central PostgreSQL DB. Most of them have a personal DB account granting 
them write access to certain tables. Keeping their password in a secure 
place is essential and I thus adviced them to not store it with QGIS nor 
to share projects that contain layers loaded with their personal 
account. The Authentication system seems to solve both problems.

However I have about 30 plugins for inhouse use that ease data access. 
Some of these plugins directly query the database for reporting. 
Furthermore I provide the plugin DataDrivenInputMask, that directly 
queries the DB, too. I use QtSql for that.

Security reasons in respect to PostgreSQL connections: Any Python plugin 
can currently access stored credentials either in QtSettings or in any 
loaded PostGIS layer, so accessing them through the authentication 
system is neither better nor worse from a user's perspective (IMHO) 
compared to the current (10+ years old) situation. Not providing access 
will increaese security, of course. So until the mentioned api is in 
place I would opt for only deprecating the direct access, maybe have the 
user allow access for the plugin (only once and store his answer in the 
auth-DB).

If direct access to PostgreSQL credentials cannot be granted it would be 
good if the future api could return a QtSqlDatabase object (which, of 
course, contains the credentials accessible through 
QtSqlDatabase.userName() and QtSqlDatabase.password() methods).

best regards

Bernhard

BTW, this particular implementation does not work, as it seems to be

The idea is still valid, however.

Hi Paolo,

I think it would be worth to have better projection choice support in 
QGIS. It is really hard to select proper projections, esp. for new 
users. We also lack some useful worldwide projections in our proj4 database.

One could have a d3.js based preview for world-wide projections.

Would be a good thing for a GSOC project, I think.

Andreas

Hello René-Luc,

I have made some tests and found this bug too...
The main problem is that self.uniqueModel is filled with quoted column 
names.
For Oracle provider, giving a quoted uniqueColumn in a uri to create a 
QgsVectorLayer results in an invalid layer.
If you remove the quotes, the layer becomes valid.

The problem doesn't occur with geomFieldName because for this ComboBox, 
we use currentText() to grab the column name (geom column is then 
unquoted).

I can make a pull request for DBManager Oracle Plugin with the following 
modification in plugin.py:
         uri.setDataSource(u"", u"({})".format(sql), geomCol, filter, 
uniqueCol.strip(u'"'))
instead of
         uri.setDataSource(u"", u"({})".format(sql), geomCol, filter, 
uniqueCol)

to deal with quote deletion. I can't find another quick and clean way to 
do it...

What do you (devs) think ?

Hi all,

however we are going to solve this ..
+1 for better projection support.

reason: there are a lot of downloadable shapefiles by austrian
government which are obviously produced by ESRI products (with
austrian projection) - but when I load them in QGIS I still get
"custom projection" with the same parameters as the austrian
projection (I think it was 31259). So there must be something wrong
with projection recognition.
So beside the better projection CHOICE support - there is still some
thing to do ..

regards
Werner

Hi,

Have you tried the 'sizeChanged' signal?

Also, have a look at the QgsComposerItemWidget class, specifically this
function:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/composer/qgscomposeritemwidget.cpp#L378.
It might contain some pointers for your use case.

All the best.

Regards,

John

Message-ID: <201601131158.38297.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi,

Just to inform you I've just completed the update to EPSG v8.8 (previous one 
was v8.5) in GDAL trunk ( ​https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/32964 ), 
libgeotiff trunk ( ​https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/changeset/2714 ) and proj.4 
master ( ​
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/832329a9aadbfcb7f46919c903f7672e719d2a82 
). (and proposed PostGIS spatial_ref_sys.sql : 
https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/ticket/3427 )

As you can see (proj.4 nad/epsg file is probably the most readable to see the 
diffs), It brings a bunch of new SRS, updated TOWGS84 shifts, etc...

Please report if you notice any issue.

Best regards,

Even

Hi,

The coolest thing to have regarding projections for small scale data 
would be the "Adaptive composite map projection" developed by folks from 
the University of Oregon.

It is developed with the MIT license and could be re-used by QGIS.

See https://github.com/OSUCartography/adaptive-composite-map-projections 
or Google for it to see demos/videos. 
http://cartography.oregonstate.edu/ScaleAdaptiveWebMapProjections.html 
is a good start. A demo is at 
http://cartography.oregonstate.edu/demos/AdaptiveCompositeMapProjections/

As far as I know, ESRI has plans to include this in their products. We 
could do the same if we want.

Hi,

I wonder if the recently added geometry modifiers could be introduced 
also for labeling in a future QGIS release?

Use case:
Label a linear feature multiple times with different label text. E.g. a 
label at the beginning of the line, a label somewhere along the feature, 
and a different label at the end of the line.

@Matthias: this would be for the waste-water management application 
where we need a main label and two minor levels at certain map scales 
numbering the pipes/reaches flowing into a manhole or special structure.

Do we already have the possibility to define multiple labels for a
single layer?

Hi Matthias,

Yes - with the new rule-based renderer we can label a line several times 
- e.g. have one label above the line and another with another label text 
below the line.

Hi Mathieu,

That's cool - I haven't thought about the font markers. I thought they 
can only display a single character - but apparently, with data-defined 
characters you can also have more than one character and expressions. 
Quite powerful!

I tested it with start and end markers and it works fine!

The only drawback is that labels appear up-side-down - something that 
the label engine takes care of.

I can't find the possibility to label the same feature twice, only
different labeling rules for different features.
But I guess you can use "data defined placement" instead of "above" or
"below"?

Hi Matthias,

You can just add several rules that all apply at the same time (e.g. two 
times an empty rule only bound by map scale ranges).

In the placement options use one time "above line", and the other time " 
below line".

This works fine. See screenshot at 
http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/label_multiple_times.png

The workaround with font-markers from Matthieu works fine, but it is 
ugly that the labels can be up-side-down.

Good to know.

So that should work find with my previous recommendation of using
"Placement" -> "Data Defined"?

Hi Matthias,

You mean I should then set the data-defined label position to the start 
and the endpoint of the line?

Yes - this kind of works, but I would have to calculate the 
orientation/direction of the first and last segment of the line myself.

But we are getting closer to solving this issue ;-) ...

I see, you would actually not only want to set the position but also the
orientation.

Yes, that would be less clumsy with a modifier that extracts the first
and last segment. Certainly something that can be done.

The missing worldwide projection is a long standing issue. I can't
recall if there's a ticket (pretty sure there is). The cause is that
QGIS only allows projections that can go both "to and from". Where many
world projection are only "to". The gdal technical term is inverse
transformation. This primarily prohibits data saved in these projections
from being reprojected to anything else. So really just a limitation of
the Projection-on-the-fly.

Some projections include Natural Earth, Winkel Tripel, Fuller, and
Peirce quincuncial. Many of these are actually in gdal/ogr which I use
to transform outside QGIS and then load QGIS and turn off
Projection-on-the-fly.

I have also thought a bit about how spatialreference.org and epsg.io
deal with projections. Having a typical bounding box for each
projection, showing what area it's normally used for and the limits(if
you are trying to reproject into it). If you have those limits you can
also use it to clip things outside the allowed region of the projection
instead of throwing an error for coordinates out of bounds.

Thanks,
Alex

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgTmWcA1vVVE1HgckpkKMweFe6asJOd8nQBJJFpQ_Knkg@mail.gmail.com>

Here's some good news coming from the Qt camp -
http://blog.qt.io/blog/2016/01/13/new-agreement-with-the-kde-free-qt-foundation/

What this means is that we'll now be able to take advantage of modules
which were previously only available to commercial Qt customers.

For me, having access to Qt Charts is a big one. We could finally have
a decent, good-looking, fully integrated charting library usable by
composer, etc.

See eg http://doc.qt.io/QtCharts/qtcharts-barchart-example.html,
http://doc.qt.io/QtCharts/qtcharts-areachart-example.html,
http://doc.qt.io/QtCharts/qtcharts-percentbarchart-example.html,
http://doc.qt.io/QtCharts/qtcharts-polarchart-example.html,
http://doc.qt.io/QtCharts/qtcharts-scatterchart-example.html and
http://doc.qt.io/QtCharts/qtcharts-temperaturerecords-example.html

Qt Data Visualisation also looks useful, eg
http://doc.qt.io/QtDataVisualization/qtdatavisualization-bars-example.html,
http://doc.qt.io/QtDataVisualization/qtdatavisualization-qmlsurface-example.html

Great stuff! (When we finally move to Qt5 only that is ;) )

One more argument in support of moving to Qt5 that goes beyond "newer is
better", thanks for sharing.

Hi Nyall,

Interesting - thanks for sharing. Looking forward to nice charts in QGIS 
3.x ;-)

After you did the print composer redesign and reporting framework 
introduction.

It was not only reverted because of bugs, it was mainly because some 
users strongly disliked the behaviour changes. If you make a new go, it 
will be good to have a QEP about it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Error inserting new feature in geoserver wfs-t
	layer
Message-ID: <36ED2537B46D97408E52C5715B9B303006411E2B@TRITONE.intra.ppd>

Hi,
We have a multipolygon layer in postgis exposed as wfs-t layer in geoserver.

We are trying to edit it with QGis 2.12.1, and we can update and delete feature, but we have some problems inserting new feature

If we create a feature with a single polygon, on saving we always have an error:

Could not commit changes to layer piove_di_sacco:d3cp_fabbricati

Errors: ERROR: 1 feature(s) not added.
Provider errors:
unsuccessful service response: Error performing insert: java.lang.String cannot be cast to com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Geometry

But if we create two polygon and merge them as a single feature, then insert works.

It seems QGis send a gml multypoligon feature if there is more than a polygon, a polygon feature otherwise, while geoserver needs a strictly corresponding feature type with that defined on the layer.

I think the correct behavior was to create a multypoligon feature with a single ring if the wfs layer is a multipolygon.

Is there a workaround? Force QGis to always send multypoligon feature type?

We have the same behavior with a multilinestring layer inserting single linestring.

Thanks

Hi Marco,

Looking at the discussion [0], I don't see strong opinions against this, 
but indeed the node was not usable, many of its features where missing.
Here is the list of remaining things to do to bring it at a usable state 
at that time [1].

While discussing refactoring of the node tool for circular strings, 
which went without any QEP, I was asking to use the new snapping API and 
to integrate it in the advanced digitizing tools. I thought we agree at 
that time.

I find a real pity that such a big change was not integrated into 
existing effort. Now, it will make things even more complicated.

I admit that, one year earlier, the first discussion did not yield to a 
solid agreement [2]. Although, this is the kind of behavior that is not 
really easy to speak about until you really tested it. I have a solid 
belief that click-click is the right approach since:
- people using it find it better
- other QGIS tools behave the same
- it allows integration of CAD tools, cancelation of current editing 
action with right-click, and avoids digitizing errors.

We had the same type of discussion when we remove the fact that right 
click was adding a last node to the digitized line or polygon.
Some were strongly against any change, but from now it looks much more 
natural.

So, yes, effort will start again to make the node tool more integrated 
into existing framework and workflows.
Although, it will be brought to QGIS 3, so it might be easier for such a 
change.

Best regards,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Free WPS service for research in data mining and
	computational biology
Message-ID: <56978051.4020808@isti.cnr.it>

Dear QGIS developers,
at the National Research Council of Italy in Pisa we have just released 
a free WPS service running in a distributed e-Infrastructure and using 
Cloud computing behind the scenes. The name of the service is DataMiner 
and collects several methods developed by computational biology, 
oceanography and data mining communities. We have successfully tested 
this service with QGIS and we would like to make it available among the 
default WPS services in the official distribution of QGIS.

The service usage is free, after obtaining a token on our projects Web 
portal (http://i-marine.d4science.org) and subscribing to one of our 
Virtual Research Environments. The available algorithms change according 
to the VRE.

The access point to this distributed network of web services is 
http://dataminer.d4science.org/wps/WebProcessingService

To make the service work you need to provide a user token. Here is one 
user name and token for testing purposes: 
statistical.manager/2f993647-a724-4f47-abec-968717beaa70

Sample calls:
*Capabilities in the testing VRE:* 
http://dataminer.d4science.org/wps/WebProcessingService?service=WPS&Request=GetCapabilities
*Input of the DBScan algorithm:* 
http://dataminer.d4science.org/wps/WebProcessingService?Request=DescribeProcess&Service=WPS&Version=1.0.0&Identifier=org.gcube.dataanalysis.wps.statisticalmanager.synchserver.mappedclasses.clusterers.DBSCAN
*Execution of DBScan:* 
http://dataminer.d4science.org/wps/WebProcessingService?request=Execute&service=WPS&Version=1.0.0&lang=en-US&Identifier=org.gcube.dataanalysis.wps.statisticalmanager.synchserver.mappedclasses.clusterers.DBSCAN&DataInputs=OccurrencePointsClusterLabel=OccClustersTest;epsilon=10;min_points=1;OccurrencePointsTable=http://goo.gl/VDzpch;FeaturesColumnNames=depthmean|sstmnmax|salinitymean;

Some documentation is available here 
https://wiki.gcube-system.org/gcube/DataMiner_Installation
Surrounding papers about the back-end system are 
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.3030/abstract and 
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.3435/abstract

Thank you very much for your attention and I hope you will help me 
understanding how to embed the WPS link within QGIS releases.

Regards,
Gianpaolo Coro

Hi

today someone asked me where to invest public development funds
enhancing some topology check instruments (not necessarily QGIS)

they have the doubt about if was better invest in Topology Checher or
Geometry Checker (or something else)

would make sense to invest merging the two plugins, new geometry
engine for Geometry Checker with the UI and use cases of the Topology
Checker?

Luigi Pirelli

I just did PR for this new feature integrating the work of SebDieBln

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2674

I just realised that my PKI postgis dockers misses some permission (I
pushed my repo... but cloning, key files have permission changed)...
I'll fix soon.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GDAL 2.1 can update Geojson files - What is
 missing in QGIS to edit GeoJSON files ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO47UT_jYdOfXTQAzqrUBg1v3q8TjWyFKhUXSGVLUdPB3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGIS,

I have read that GDAL can now update GeoJSON  since version 2.1.0. See [1]

If I build QGIS with GDAL 2.1, would I be able to edit the GeoJSON as I can
for Shapefiles ? For the record, capabilities are defined here [2]

Perhaps the GDAL doc about "updating existing GeoJSON files" has a
different meaning that the need raised by Even Rouault here [3]

Or is the best approach to create a specific QGIS driver for GeoJSON ? I
would try to propose a PR for this if this is the best way to go.

Another GeoJSON related question. Any idea on the relevance of adding the
ability to create a spatial index file *.qix for GeoJSON layers in order to
improve rendering speed ?

Cheers,

Michaël

Giving GDAL 2.1 a try will be way less effort than implementing a
GeoJSON driver inside QGIS. And if there are things still left to be
fixed, it's probably better to fix things on the GDAL end since this way
the support for it is in a library shared by many FOSSGIS tools.

(Please note that this recommendation is only meant for non-database
providers. Feel free to propose a native GeoPackage driver ;) )

All the best

Yes, that was developed mostly for the QGIS use case and has been tested with 
it. You have full editing capabilities : adding, deleting, modifying features, 
adding, deleting fields.

The OGR GeoJSON driver proceeds into the ingestion of the full file into 
memory, which can be a limitation when dealing with huge files ( the json-c lib 
might typically consume an amount of memory more than 10 times the size of the 
geojson file).
For a in-memory layer like the one used underneath by the GeoJSON driver, the 
spatial filtering done by OGR uses a basic BBOX filter while iterating over the 
features (the BBOX isn't stored into the geometry object but recomputed each 
time it is needed). This could potentially benefit from a in-memory spatial 
index, but I'd expect that to be only useful for large geojson files (let's say 
> 100 MB), i.e. the ones that the driver would currently have issues to deal 
with.

A more "streaming-like" approach for the driver not proceeding to full 
ingestion of features could be desirable to remove that limitation, but that's 
more involved. A possibility could be to have a "at-hand" parser to delimitate 
JSon "Feature" objects and use only json-c to parse each feature. But GeoJSON 
is certainly not the more appropriate file format to deal with huge datasets...

Cheers,

Even

Just curious to know what advantage a native GeoPackage driver would bring 
over the one in OGR ?

Thanks a lot Even (and Matthias) for your prompt answers, and for pointing
out the current limitations due to in-memory layer approach.
I am build GDAL trunk to make some tests with some data

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Managing Python dependencies automatically for the
	user
Message-ID: <CANFg2AX0_OkTkHTbE+3RNtW2i88gCGPwpLiJOsi+PbTvxT+Uig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

 We are currently developing a QGIS plugin were we wish to generate some
Excel files as output.

 In order to build the spreadsheet file we need to use some python modules
installed from pip (openpyxl, xlwt, etc). This dependency will force every
user to manually install the needed package form the pip repository.

 This situation leaves us with the following question: is possible or it
will be in the future to manage this kind of dependencies from QGIS side
when the user installs the plugin?

 Thank you for your time!

 Kind regards.

It will benefit from expression compiling (for filtering and order by)
which results in performance improvements when it can be applied.

I'm not completely sure to know what you refer to in the QGIS context but the 
OGR SetAttributeFilter() method is directly evaluated by the SQLite request 
engine as a WHERE clause, and similarly for the ExecuteSQL() API.

Hi all,

Not sure if this is only my local issue.

Seems indentation test is a bit unstable and sometimes gives different
results on local machine and Travis. For example, I received two emails
about broken builds and from logs I see that this caused by failed indentation
test. But on my machine this test passes and prepare_commit.sh does
not find any issues. Also runing manually autopep8 on problematic file
leaves it unchanged.

It tries to compile QgsExpressions to native SQL syntax.

I think the point of using OGR that it offers an awesome abstraction
layer where the consumer doesn't need to care about the backend.

As soon as ExecuteSQL is used this abstraction no longer applies and it
just adds another layer of uncertainty (different library versions...)
and may potentially hide internals of the backends which may be useful
in some cases (datatypes, backend metadata, available indexes, ...), so
the advantage is gone while it complicates advanced topics.
Or did I miss something?

- datatypes: all the ones listed in "Table 1. GeoPackage Data Types" 
http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_sqlite_container have an OGR equivalent
- backend metadata: not sure what you're thinking exactly too. But at some 
point this has to be translated in the QGIS abstraction too, no ?
- available indexes: not present in the OGR abstraction currently (but the 
abstraction can be extended if needed, as it has been done in the past). Is 
QGIS aware of which indices exist ? 

A possibility would be to have a thin GeoPackage provider (I guess it could 
probably even by generic to most OGR drivers that have native SQL92 
capabilities) extending the base OGR one + using its capabilities with the 
specificities of GPKG (eg adding the SORT BY clause). Or a more quick&dirty way 
would be to hack that directly in the OGR provider for the vetted OGR drivers.

I was referring to databases in general (expression compilation is also
done for MSSQL, Oracle, Postgres)

I do not doubt that for every requirement an interface can also be
implemented in OGR but it still adds an extra roundtrip in the
development cycle, its presence has to be guaranteed on the client
system (we're still at 1.10.x on win, not sure about all linux distros
and mac) and an extra layer of possible errors, performance loss...

What would be the advantage of using OGR when using ExecuteSQL?

I can understand those reasons (althoug I'm a bit skeptical about the 
performance loss. That would mean the translation from OGRFeature to 
QGISFeature becomes really significant in performance profiles)

Just that the GPKG driver already exists (that was my main point) and in 
theory GDAL/OGR is the natural place to deal with file formats.

Fair enough, this particular point is unlikely to be significant

And it does a good job with it, at least there is GPKG support already!

Even,

Editable GeoJSON in OGR is great news!

I've got a question regarding the geojson driver you may be able to assist
with. Is there any method in the OGR libraries which allow direct parsing
of a string to a  layer? (Ie, without first writing it out to a file).

I'd like to add the ability to directly paste geojson text into QGIS and
have it inserted as a feature in the current layer (like how you can
currently paste WKT text as a feature). I don't want to have to manually
parse the json (that would be a nightmare).

If I could somehow take advantage of OGR's geojson driver to do the heavy
lifting then this work would be trivial.

Any ideas?

Well, the GeoJSON driver support "filenames" which are in fact GeoJSON content:

$ ogrinfo '{"type":"Feature","properties":{"foo":"bar"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2,49]}}' -ro -al

Layer name: OGRGeoJSON
Geometry: Point
Feature Count: 1
Extent: (2.000000, 49.000000) - (2.000000, 49.000000)
Layer SRS WKT:
GEOGCS["WGS 84",
    DATUM["WGS_1984",
        SPHEROID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","7030"]],
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","6326"]],
    PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],
    UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],
    AUTHORITY["EPSG","4326"]]
foo: String (0.0)
OGRFeature(OGRGeoJSON):0
  foo (String) = bar
  POINT (2 49)

Works also with FeatureCollections.
Alternatively, you could also put the content in a in-memory GDAL file (/vsimem/ virtual file system) and open it.

So you could likely instanciate a temporary layer and get a QGIS feature from that.


If you are just interested in geometries and not attributes, there's also the C function : 

OGRGeometryH 	OGR_G_CreateGeometryFromJson (const char *);

Although it has been discussed and some prototyping was done to support automatic installation of dependencies at the last hackfest, there isn’t anything in the released versions of QGIS to support this yet. If your packages have no operating system specific binaries in them, then I suggest to bundle them into your plugin and use an appropriate import path relative to your code. Note there is a limit on how big your plugin can be (I think it is 10mb) so you need to ensure your 3rd party deps do not bulk out your plugin too much.

We bundled xlwt and xlrd as .egg with a plugin recently:

https://github.com/opengisch/shpsync/blob/master/xlwt-1.0.0-py2.7.egg
https://github.com/opengisch/shpsync/blob/master/xlrd-0.9.4-py2.7.egg

Until there's a cross-platform dependency management (which I know that
several people are looking into) that's the safest road to follow.

Boundless plugins uses paver to automatize egg generation and inclusion in
the plugin script... you can find an example in the qgis-geoserver-explorer
plugin source code on github. In the plugin code you can find all the
setting to import plugin included eggs.

Note that the Windows binaries already contain xlwt and xlrd. Jürgen was 
so kind to include it, because I needed it as well for my plugins. Not 
sure about openpyxl. On Linux systems it is rather easy to install them 
through apt-get, pip or similar mechanisms. Just tell your users 
that/how they need/can install them.

BTW, I opened a ticket, not to forget about this:

I think Andreas' suggestion of a GSoC is very good. Anyone would take
the lead?

Hi

I get the following error when launching QGIS (Ubuntu 14.04, qgis master):

Subject: [Qgis-developer] DbManager - new sqlite PRAGMA index_list returns
	more columns than expected
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO5bM8zdBOvh210L0rMrY=BT7D_fjyJ_m=68AvdwbCeevQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Some users reported a bug in DbManager. When you connect to a database, and
then click on one layer, the plugin tries to fetch information about the
layer and its indexes.

The method "getTableIndexes" situated in line 371 of the file
"db_manager/db_plugins/spatialite/connector.py"expects to get 3 fields from
the sqlite method "PRAGMA index_list"

In recent version of SQLite, though, this method now returns 5 fields, for
example

sqlite> pragma index_list(geo_parcelle);
0|idx_geo_parcelle_ogc_fid|0|c|0
1|geo_parcelle_voie_idx|0|c|0
2|geo_parcelle_comptecommunal_idx|0|c|0


This leads to a Python error :

File
"/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/db_manager/db_plugins/spatialite/connector.py",
line 371, in getTableIndexes

num, name, unique = idx

ValueError: too many values to unpack


A change has been made in sqlite code, see
https://github.com/mackyle/sqlite/commit/efa3207797a6ff4eb6a514fad5c99cf67c056492

Then a bug fix has been added for retro-compatibility if index_info , but
not for index_list

https://github.com/mackyle/sqlite/commit/53555d6da78e52a430b1884b5971fef33e9ccca4

We need to backport a bug fix, if it is done in DbManager

I have opened a bug in the hub, since I have not been able to find a
corresponding issue.
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14110

I will try to debug it quicky, or have someone already worked on it ?

Cheers
Michaël

Hi all

I have just tested QGIS master build againt GDAL "trunk" (build via a git
clone from GDAL github repository & following the doc instructions [1] ).
It works like a charm with a small roads dataset.

Thanks Even (and other involved devs and funders ) for making this happen !

I have seen one first caveat :

* Export a Shapefile to GeoJSON in QGIS via the "Save as" and choose to
keep only 1 number for decimal precision
* Open this GeoJSON file, toggle edition, and add a new feature
* The new feature geometries are written with default decimal precision
(for example : 6790978.453365888446569 ) and not like the other original
features ( for example : 6790978.4 )

We should have a way in QGIS to keep the original decimal precision. Any
clue on this ? Should I open a ticket ?

Michaël

This is not something that could get fixed easily. When you open the geojson 
file, there's nothing in it explicitly mentionning the decimal precision (and 
it could be non uniform). There could be some logic to guess it, but that 
wouldn't be trivial since json-c returns a IEEE-754 double and not the 
original ASCII representation. A less user friendly but more reliable way 
would be to have an open option / env. variable to define the wished precision 
when you're in update mode.

First of all, thank you very much for all the fast replies, they have been
very helpful for us.

 The solution we finally implemented was adding the .egg file for the
dependency and loading it when the wider system import fails in the
following fashion:

import os
import sys

try:
    import openpyxl
except:
    package_name = "openpyxl-2.3.2-py2.7.egg"
    package_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), package_name)
    sys.path.append(package_path)
    import openpyxl

 This may not be a solution for every use case but it gets the job done for
us in our setup.

 Once again, thank you for he fast replies and ideas given.

 Kind regards,

Hi Paolo

Looks like these are 3D shapefiles, at least when running the checker 
with "create new layer" I got:

Failed to create the output layer: creation of layer failed (OGR 
error:Geometry type of `3D Polygon' not supported in shapefiles.

Type can be overridden with a layer creation option

of SHPT=POINT/ARC/POLYGON/MULTIPOINT/POINTZ/ARCZ/POLYGONZ/MULTIPOINTZ.

)

Some improvements are needed in QgsVectorFileWriter to discard the Z 
component resp to allow 3D polygons.

I'll also look at whether there is some bad handling within the geometry 
checker code itself.

Best Sandro

So from a geometry checker point of view, the big thing it misses 
compared to the topology checker plugin is support for checking multiple 
layers at once.

The UI at the moment is indeed one big block, but the code underneath is 
very modular, and it is pretty easy to make a more "test-set" oriented UI.

Just my two cents

Can you describe the steps to reproduce the case where a geometry ends 
up getting thrown away?

this happens quite reliably when using the lwgeom plugin and v.clean,
both through Processing.

Okay, but did you encounter such issues with the geometry checker plugin 
specifically? I did a couple of random tests and things seem to work 
(except the layer creation issue mentioned previously).

they were not dropped, but I ended up with a layer with more or less the
same errors as in the origin. I may be missing some options though.
If you want we can try debugging it from IRC.
Thanks.

About to leave right now, but if you can just list which layer and which 
checks you picked I should be able to reproduce any issues easily.

@devs FYI for those not on PSC or SAC list:


Hi PSC, SAC,

Several people told me to move to a free Cloudflare plan to speed up
qgis.org and hub.qgis.org

I just did :-)

I *think* it is already faster (but please confirm) especially the api
pages...

Please let me know if you see any problems. << !!

I created a backup of the go-daddy zone file and put it in QGIS dropbox
folder (though I also see the records still in the godaddy admin screen)

I hope this help to have a better QGIS website experience...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Feature freeze exception for file icons? Sorry...
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GeeHPLLtWAbEWJrE4OD6HxiDmES+iQStMmFuprTfBXKQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm sorry to be the one opening this door (this time) and, OFC, I fully
understand a big "No" as an answer.

I have created icons for QGIS files. I have started to create them only for
the main file formats and then extended for data files as well. I have gathered
opinions from others in UX mailing list
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-Files-Icons-td5238525.html> and I
have created Pull Request #2630 <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2630> long
before feature freeze, hoping to see them land on the next LTR version.

Not being merged now, means that for LTR users this will only be available
in almost a year since now.

So, since this PR has no impact on the QGIS code itself and it's not
actually a feature, would it be possible to make an exception and merge the
PR?

I'm fully aware that it leads to extra work on the packaging side, and I
would love to minimise that as far as I could. For instance, I could keep
it only to the main files (qgs, qml, qlr, qpt).

Thank you very much,
Alexandre Neto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 12 output field types in Field calculator
Message-ID: <569A5671.6080805@duif.net>


As part of http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14082 I had a look into the Field
Calculator today, and see there are 12 output field types nowadays?

http://i.imgur.com/2GtUQgj.png

Is there a special reason to do this like this? I understand that eg for
a postgis db it is useful, but from an average user standpoint I think
it is a little too much (besides the already doubled options)?

Or IF there is an apparent use case for this, should we not hide/mask
the corner cases a little?

And (see #14082) make decimal number (real) or text the default type...
by the way) so user X can use the Field calculator without using his/her
brain too much ;-)
And while we are busy with it: also give a big error message when there
is an overflow (like the area calculation in the issue)?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Yes, the drop down is filled from the datatypes the data provider lists as
native types (see QgsVectorDataProvider::nativeTypes) and will support
when creating attributes (see QgsVectorDataProvider::addAttributes).

Good. But why when working with a memory layer I would see 12 output
types? And part of them doublures (I think...):
Decimal number (real) is show twice
Text (string) vs Text, unlimited length (text)
seem double?

Would it be an idea to only show the types that dat provider type has?
/me looking....

Ah wait..: it is only the Memory Layer that shows 12 types...
If I open a shape file, it shows me the old 4 types...
Postgis shows 11 types

Ok, then I rest my case: we show only the types that are available in
the dataprovider being used... nice!

Only issue I see then is the fields of the memory layers where there are
two decimal and text strings which appear (to me) to be the same?

Thanks for clarifying!!

Regards,

Richard

I read the PR and I saw it was stopped for days for problems not
related with the PR itself, btw was your resonsability to rise the
attention before the feature freeze (you did 10 minutes later!). IMHO
it could be included especially if it was already discussed with the
UX group.

Dear QGIS Developers


For some time now we have been talking about moving to 3.0. The PSC is looking for proposals on how to manage the process of moving to QGIS 3.0. For a little more context please see the blog post I have made [1]. Once we have all the proposals in (please see the example from Matthias Kuhn at the bottom of the aforementioned post and keep it nice & simple)  we will collate them and then select one (or a hybrid of several) and share those plans with the broader community. I will make all the proposals publicly available and we will make the final decision in consultation with the developer community.

Great summary Tim! Thanks for helping push this along.

It's probably no surprise (since Matthias and I have spoken at length
regarding this), but I'm in favour of Proposal 1. I just don't believe
we have the resources to support any form of parallel development like
proposal 2 requires.

Hi Tim,

Thank you for this blog post with the summary - It will help to move 
forward with this topic.

Pending any other/better proposals I am also in favour of 
Matthias/Nyalls proposal with the intermediate 2.16 release and then 
moving on/concentrating on 3.0 - with potentially a 8 month release cycle.

Of course it would have been better to start with 3.0 immediately after 
a LT release - but that opportunity has gone - as we did not 
prepare/announce it properly and well in advance.

Andreas

Hi Nyall,

I also agree with your argument that we do not have resources to support
parallel development.

But I do not agree with the two plans Tim proposed.

I would favour the project to concentrate fully on a QGIS 3.0. I thought
we already spoke about this one year ago: 2.14 would be the last LTR in
the 2.x serie so current 2.x users can at least use that one (plus ltr
fixes if really needed).

And the project could then fully focus on a good Qt4, Py3, new api version.
Whether this is in master branch or in a separate qgis3 branch (so we
can fall back if really needed) I am not sure.

I think without full focus on a transition it just will not happen.
Personally I think current options are too much of a compromise, and we
will end up with a lot of wrappers and hacks to keep 2.x alive while
also trying to server 3.0...

But I'm not a core dev so devs feel free to convince me that *for the
project* it is better to mix two python/qt/api versions and try to hide
that (as I see it). At the moment I just do not believe in this approach.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

To stay focused, I just reply to the main points of your email.

As main author of proposal 1 I can assure you: it endorses focused work
on QGIS 3.0 after release of 2.16.

 * At the moment our C++ codebase is compatible with Qt4 and Qt5. And no
hacks had to be introduced. We can take that as indicator that the same
works for PyQt.
 * Huge projects exist that have a codebase compatible with Python2 and
Python 3 (e.g. pandas [1]). We can take that as an indicator that a
compatible codebase is possible.

 * Usage of compatibility wrappers will be optional for plugin
developers. But they are very desirable for plugin developers who have
to support concurrent versions.
 * If it turns out that it is harder than expected we will still be free
to just completely dismiss compatibility support. But I wouldn't want to
not even try it because of believes and feelings.

Best regards,
Matthias

Hi Everyone,

Is there a summary of a typical development environment that is used to
maintain the LTR?

I am running across multiple sources of how to compile QGIS.  Also, I am
not 100% sure which version and source of libraries folks use.

I would like to suggest/contribute a couple of things to the project and
wanting to not spend a lot of time building out an environment that may not
be acceptable.

In short, is there a standard development/build environment for QGIS?

Any guidance is appreciated.

Thanks,
Robb

Hi Robb,

There is no standard.

Concerning the OS, a lot of dev's use Linux, therefore anybody using
something else is even more welcome :)

If you want your setup to be done quickly, go for the latest Ubuntu or
Fedora linux, clone the git repository, rerun cmake a couple of times,
and install the missing dependencies (-dev or -devel packages). Just
take whatever is offered by the system's repository, the lib versions
should be compatible if it's a recent distribution.

I recently wrote some documents for git and QtCreator (which I did not
yet finalize but plan to put them onto the QGIS web page soon):

https://github.com/m-kuhn/QGIS-Website/blob/qtcreator.rst/source/site/getinvolved/development/git.rst
https://github.com/m-kuhn/QGIS-Website/blob/qtcreator.rst/source/site/getinvolved/development/qtcreator.rst

It would be great to have a comprehensive reference to get new
developers up to speed with a small initial effort. Please let me know
if you find anything that could be improved.

Best regards,

Hi,
I've a relatively recent master (6435a20) on Win64 and I'm noticing that if I unselect some categories in the layer tree all the objects in the layer disappear. 

The objects don't reappear unless all the categories are selected/visible. 

Is anyone else seeing this?

Dev's,

Nobody else?

I would think that these kind of moves would attract some more
discussion, or at least some more interest :-(

Hi all (Tim?)

Can we put out a call for 2.14 beta testers on the blog/social media
accounts?

Will be good to get as much feedback pre LTS release as possible.

I just thought I'd reassure you that the discussion is being read and not
ignored. As just a plugin dev, I cannot offer any opinion - the core devs
will come to the best consensus, and the rest of us can all then work at
fixing our plugins.

Hi Nyall,

We have blog.qgis.org (a wordpress site). If you provide me some text
(and maybe image) I'm happy to put it on the 'offical' blog.
Anita can maybe give you a login to do it yourself if you prefer?
@Anita: can you please add the admin user/admin password to our password
file?

I think Nathan (in cc) does the twittering (? not sure).
@Nathan: is it an idea to share the password with psc so we can put it
in password file?

Regards,

Richard

My suggestion:
* release 2.14 LTR
* move immediately to 3.0
* backport all fixes to 2.14, as usual for LTR
* allow for exception for new functions, on a case by case basis, if
these are especially important, of limited impact, and needed soon, well
before the expected release of 3.0 (I know this is against the LTR
concept, that's why I think it should be exceptional)
* provide help for plugin authors to migrate them to 3.0 API and libs.
Given our limited resources, and the need to move forward to follow the
availability of new libs on some platforms, I think the sooner we start
the better.
All the best.

I try to keep the users within the organizations I work with aware of new
versions of QGIS when they are released. I also like to summarize some of
the changes. My Google skills are failing me, however, in finding changelogs
for eg 2.8.6 and 2.12.3, rather than for 2.8 and 2.12. I'm sure I've found
them before, but if someone can point me towards them, I'd be extremely
grateful.

Hi Tom,

Juergen/jef is pretty good in updating the header of the website (left
in the black top bar of qgis.org). And below the Download button on
frontpage.

I recently even received a message in my running QGIS 2.12...

There is also the version number in the executable installers, eg:

http://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-2.12.3-1-Setup-x86_64.exe

I think 'we' should even create a post on blog.qgis.org for every even
minor upgrades....

Regards,

Richard

Hi Dev's,

Any Travis guru's here have some time to help the doc team/me to move

build/passing icons :-)

No seriously: the doc team is getting on steam to do a big documentation
update for 2.14 LTR docs.
And to be sure (with a lot of new doc writers) we keep the docs building
(and keep it error free), it would be great if Travis keeps us informed
of errors?

I'm happy to help with the building part (we can do virtualenvs, paver
or docker....), but I'm awfully green in Travis...

Or any other alternative to do something like this?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

So a 2.14.x with possibly new features ... why not.

I am also in favor of the approach number 1: focus on the 3.0 rather
than "release when it's ready".

I think I would prefer to have another version in the 2.x branch (2.16)
to let people propose the features they are working on (even if I admit
the 3.0 version has been proposed as the next version since months)

Just an idea: what about a 2.16 being an LTR rather than the 2.14 ?

The blog post says for the approach 1 the main risk is a lack of
funding. Do we have some ideas of the amount of work needed ?

No, I don't mean announcing that the releases are available - I mean a
changelog for the releases. Where is that?

Nyal, All,

In order to help power users to test the futur release, it seems that it's 
worth to create the visual changelog for 2.14.

What is you opinion?

Richard,

Did you check MapServer doc repository? They/we use travis to build the doc 
and publish it via gthub.io

See https://github.com/mapserver/docs/blob/branch-7-0/.travis.yml

It is added to the 'ChangeLog' file in the Release 2.y.z commit:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/e72e2abd0e22ca414af5268dff27c8dce84dc523

Or extract it your self from the branche commits:

Yes, that is what I'm proposing. You could for example use
admin at qgis.org and set a password for that one?

Hmm. Not at all usable, I'm afraid. I would have thought a properly
documented changelog for releases would be A Good Thing.

Yes, agree with that.

Just added a 2.14.0 version to the changelog.qgis.org application:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/2.14.0/

devs: please feel free to add your new stuff

@tim: not sure what else is needed to start with a new version?

Hi, 

QGIS is now used by a lot of professional users worldwide. A lot of them
have contracts with QGIS developes/companies and expect that they can be
delivered within a few months. If we move now to QGIS 3.0 on such short
notice, without any concrete plan/warning, means such projects can only
be delivered in early 2017, which might be a problem for many, including
me and my employer. We need a few improvements in QGIS forms and widgets
in the 2.x branch. We can't wait for them to be delivered only in 2017.
CAD import would also be nice to have soon - though that is not equally
important compared to the forms improvements. 

I have to repeat again that Anita (also board member) promised that the
board will inform all involved parties (e.g. devs, professional users)
well in advance with such decisions. Now changing immediately to QGIS
3.0 on such short notice without a clear plan is exactly the opposite of
good communication of the QGIS board with the user and developer base. 

Because of this, I would like to have another 2x release, like Matthias,
Hugo and Nyall suggest. We can then, as Mathias suggests already
introduce Python 3 support in parallel with Python 2 support, which is
an important ingredient of the upcoming QGIS 3.0 version. It would then
still give us 8 months to mature the 3.0x version before the next LT
release. 

Hugos suggestion to have 2.16 as the LT release instead of 2.14 would
also be fine and acceptable for me. Moving to 3.0 immediately would not
work well for us. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

My suggestion:
* release 2.14 LTR
* move immediately to 3.0
* backport all fixes to 2.14, as usual for LTR
* allow for exception for new functions, on a case by case basis, if
these are especially important, of limited impact, and needed soon, well
before the expected release of 3.0 (I know this is against the LTR
concept, that's why I think it should be exceptional)
* provide help for plugin authors to migrate them to 3.0 API and libs.
Given our limited resources, and the need to move forward to follow the
availability of new libs on some platforms, I think the sooner we start
the better.
All the best.

I am also in favour of proposal 1 (release 2.16 and then 3.0) as it
has a good balance in terms of how much time in advance 3.0 is
announced, how much time is there to adjust to py3/qt5, and how much
extra time can be used for API breaking changes.

Thanks Andreas, sounds reasonable to me.
It would be useful to know what are the improvements planned for 2.16:
could devs and customers share this with us?
All the best.

Thanks Matthias,

Based on your example and some reading I managed to get our docs building.

Currently only master and html only, but that is great for the upcoming
docs update, because new commits will be tested then!

Thanks again,

Richard

hey, we have a QEP process running around labeling / callout lines / saving
ressources with qgs / porting easycustom labeling and mask plugin to core
equivalent.

We can target 3.0, there is no hurry, as no coding work has been done yet.
By the way, I would be pleased that we can achieve a vote on those QEP's so
that I can plan future contracts and QGIS community can take that into
account. Hugo, any opinion from your point of view?
All the best
Régis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Default GDAL/OGR in QGIS master and OSGeo4w shell
	in Windows
Message-ID: <121b01d15300$3392d020$9ab87060$@lutraconsulting.co.uk>

Dear list

 

I am using OSGeo4W installer in Windows. QGIS master shows that it uses
Gdal/OGR 1.11.3

But when I try OSGeo4W shell, it shows Gdal/ogr 2.0.0dev release. 

 

I can read Spatilaite in QGIS and older version of GDAL/OGR but in the
OSGeo4w shell it comes up with an error saying that GDAL/OGR has not been
compiled with spatialite support.

 

I was wondering the inconsistency I am having is due to a local issue or
something to do with the package manager?

 

Cheers,

Saber

On my list I have :

- a new symbol layer to draw straight and curved arrows on line layers,
as it's done by the "Arrows" plugin
- allow to pin diagrams
- some new drawing tools in the composer (polygons, lines)

Yes, I think there are still some open questions around some of these
QEPs. I still need a little bit of time to clean them all and call for a
vote. I'll try to do it soon.

Looking forward to it, thanks.
Any other major plans?
What is the state of other QEPs?
All the best.

Counter-argument. This breaks the only newly established LTR release cycle
which is cited as very attractive to corporate users.

I also have an "unmerged" work called "label layers" (see a demo here
https://vimeo.com/152402776). I would like to see it merged one day ...
but I didn't had much available time so far.
If someone wants to merge it or fund us to merge it, let me know.

Hi all,

FYI

this was just sent out for the upcoming Fedora version.

== Detailed Description ==
QtWebEngine is the new web engine by the Qt project based on Chromium,
effectively replacing QtWebKit, though it is not a drop-in
replacement. QtWebEngine will be available in Fedora as an additional
option. QtWebKit will remain available for the foreseeable future, and
thus applications currently using QtWebKit are not impacted by this
change, unless and until upstream ports them to QtWebEngine. The
version initially packaged for Fedora 24 will be QtWebEngine 5.6.

But as a FINAL 2.x release it would make sense to be a LTR, wouldn't 
it.  To give time before moving to 3.x.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Can :class: :mod: :func: be removed from python
	cookbook?
Message-ID: <569F8AAE.2020706@duif.net>

(sorry for cross posting)

Hi Devs and Python cookbook writers,

As you may know if you follow community list, we have a travis build now
for QGIS documentation (and python cookbook then).

To make Travis fail, I build the docs with an option that warning become
errors, thereby making it clear for commiters that something broke.

To try to make it fully warning free know, I hit warnings like:

pyqgis_developer_cookbook/canvas.rst:21: WARNING: py:class reference
target not found: QgsMapCanvas

It turns out that Sphinx (off course) outside the source tree cannot
resolve the reference to the QgsMapCanvas documentation....

Then found the sphinx conf.py option:

nitpick_ignore = [('py:class', 'QgsMapCanvas'),
                  ('py:class', 'QgsMapRenderer')]

BUT that only works if you put all classes referenced in it, and I'm not
able to find a wildcard...

So I find/added all classes... but then it start failing on :func: .....
which is even more...

So: is it ok for you if I just delete all this :class: stuff? So it will
never be possible anymore to make that a reference to api.....

I will leave the backquotes, so it will at least be made a bold font in
the docs....

Please let me know if somebody sees troubles with this

Regards,

Richard

Hello Richard,

I'd prefer if we keep that reference to the API.

I know that we are not currently using it, but it would be nice if one
could just click on the function/class name and jump to the API docs, this
could be implemented in the future.

Can't you just regexp and add the :func: stuff too?

Hi Richard,

It should be straightforward to extend sphinx to add whole domains
(py:class, py:mod, py:func) to the ignore list or add wildcard support.

If the formatting stays the same as it is now, I do not mind if you
remove the extra annotations (which unfortunately not link anywhere).

Especially the functions/methods are not fully qualified anyway, so
connecting them to real API docs would need further effort.

No, you have to add ALL individual classes...

As you see below, I grepped and was busy
But then the func ones were even more..

But I will try to set in my regexp/vim foo and try to get the full list
of func type mod an class ....

I was thinking about a small pull request against sphinx to improve the
situation there.
Maintaining this list in the future will not make it easier for documenters.

But like Martin said, it's of limited use in its current shape anyway.

So either:

 * Make sphinx regex aware (or some other generalized pattern)
 * Generate the list from the source code rather than the documentation
 * Just drop it

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Setting snapping settings via Python
Message-ID: <9BEAE41C5F3C764E84B78481B4AC2D7EAF0362@STGV-BUS01.thinkwhere.local>

Hi,

Is there a way to set the snapping settings for a layer via Python?  I would like to turn on snapping with a specified tolerance automatically when a user begins editing within a plugin.

There is a question on gis.stackexchange, but it hasn't been answered.

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/133816/how-to-enable-the-snapping-options-for-vector-layer-using-the-python-programming

QSettings stores some values, but these are the defaults:

    qs = QSettings()
    qs.value('Qgis/digitizing/default_snap_mode')
    qs.value('Qgis/digitizing/default_snapping_tolerance')
    qs.value('Qgis/digitizing/default_snapping_tolerance_units')

I have also found the canvas.snappingUtils(), but cannot find functions there to enable snapping modes or set tolerances.

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Qgis-developer] protected members naming
Message-ID: <56A0960C.3020905@gmail.com>

Is there a rule for naming protected members?

In the doc, it is written that private members "begin with a lower case 
m and are formed using mixed case".
Does this include protected members?

Thanks,
Denis

Short answer: Yes

Long answer: Don't use protected members, use protected setters and
getters ;-)

Pretty sure it's just my OCD, but I'd also like to see the rules:
- don't name ANYTHING "my..."
- make sure you give widgets a name starting with 'm' too

Message-ID: <CAB28AsixJhwmqvGvtd1yg1wmzx-_tbM7VGsbALBmxRs94qtH_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Ok, I've just finished the trawl through the git log and added rough
outlines of all the new features to the visual changelog
(http://changelog.linfiniti.com/en/qgis/2.14.0/pending-entry/list/)

If you're responsible for any of these changes, you probably want to
improve these rough entries and make sure you/your sponsors have been
given correct credit.

I've also left off the processing updates, as I get lost trying to
understand what's new and what's fixes from the algorithm changes! So
someone will need to add these too.

It's always amazing to see how much cool stuff lands in a new release...

Hi,

I'm maybe wrong but you'd better look at QgsSnappingUtils
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsSnappingUtils.html
It seems more simple and should do the job for you.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] JS error in QtWebKit.QWebView - no error in IE11
	or Chrome/Win
Message-ID: <1453389758965-5246541.post@n6.nabble.com>

qgis2web's preview pane is a QWebView. OpenLayers 3.13.0 has just been
released. I've tried upgrading qgis2web's OpenLayers to that version, but
the preview stops working. I found instructions for how to redirect the
QWebView's console output to the QGIS Python console. The (not very
meaningful) error I am getting is:

WARNING:root:JS undefined:0
TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function

However, if I export instead of previewing, and open the file in IE11 or
Chrome/Win, I get no error. If I revert qgis2web to OL3.12.1, it starts
working again.

Can anyone help me fix this? I've filed an issue at:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/issues/176

Thanks

Tom

Hi Tom,

You can enable developer tools on a QWebView and then use the inspector
and interactive JS console for debugging. That's very handy.

Thanks, Matthias - that should be just what I need. First attempts to
implement it result in a minidump, but I'll keep trying.

Does it happens in all platforms?
I have a problem like this under windows 32bit but not under Ubuntu or
other external browser.
Attached there is a simple html that throws exceptions loading external
libraries (angular.js !?) under webkit on windows 32bit, but loads fine on
other platforms.

OK, I've got that working (thanks again, Matthias), and I'm getting an error
in OL3.13.0 itself, not in my JS. I'll update the qgis2web Github issue, and
see if I can get some OL3 help from somewhere. For info, the error I get is:

ol-debug.js:48906
TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'handler.bind(s)')

Enrico, I only have Win x64 at the moment, so I don't know if it's
platform-specific. As I say, it's specific to OL3.13.0, not present in
OL3.12.1.

Hi Mathias

I wrote a new not integrating it in test_provider_postgres.py because
it's setup is based on a "standard" db

I/we can do two things

1) use this containers as test suite also for generic postgres
provider giving less strict connection control (in this moment my
container allow only certified connections) => in this way I can
integrate the test inside test_provier_postgres.py

2) add the container in the trevis suite and leave the test is a separate test

btw I don't have "power" or knowledge on QGIS Trevis configuration/setup

my actual simple test code is here  (to see the code do compare):

https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis/tree/postgis-pki-conntest

I also added a configured qgis-auth.db (only with "Fra" user cert) in
the test data set.

the test would be adapted to be more generic in case of docker-machine
containers (OSX and Win)

cheers
Luigi Pirelli

Just to close this one off, this issue was caused by OL3.13.0 replacing
goog.bind() with Function.bind() as part of their move to abandon legacy
code and insist on ECMA-compliant clients. Presumably the Qt4 WebKit is not
thus compliant. Solution is to use a polyfill. All the details are in the
OL3 Github issue above. I'll try it tomorrow.

Cool, thanks for doing this.

Note that we use this url now:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/2.14.0/pending-entry/list/

Also you can only see the entries if you are logged in. So you need to
have an account to edit/see them. Please let us know if you need an
account for it.

@tim: how did you normally organize this? First finish items and then
approve them, so they become visible? Or already approve them so
everybody can see/edit them?

Further test:

Failed to create the output layer: non riesco a creare il layer (errore
OGR:Geometry type of `Unrecognised: 1003' not supported in shapefiles.
Type can be overridden with a layer creation option
of SHPT=POINT/ARC/POLYGON/MULTIPOINT/POINTZ/ARCZ/POLYGONZ/MULTIPOINTZ.

I selected Polygon and/or Multipolygon among Allowed geometry types.

Message-ID: <DB3PR08MB02526A9E19C6CAEBD061315DA7C40@DB3PR08MB0252.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

I'd like very much to use QGIS with the awesome new GRASS plugin,
but lately it seems to be harder and harder (at least for me) to achieve 
this goal.
What i find really very confusing is what release (on windows) or PPA 
(personal package archive
on ubuntu) we are supposed to use to have QGIS working with GRASS.
Now i do not have a fully working QGIS+GRASS system in windows (using 
OSGEO4W)
nor in Ubuntu 14.04 because GRASS GIS in ubuntugis-unstable is no more
compatible with QGIS or vice versa...

I think that QGIS and GRASS GIS enormously benefit each other
and really hope someone could give advise on what 
package/osegeo/ppa/stable/unstable/installer
to use to simply have QGIS and GRASS run together :-)

thanks, Roy.

Sounds like a PolygonZ (=1003) is passed to OGR as WKB encoded with ISO SQL/MM 
to GDAL 1.11 or older. Only GDAL 2.0 will support that. GDAL 1.X will only 
support old-style 99-402 extended dimension (Z) WKB, so Polygon25D = 
0x80000003

Thanks Even. In this case, the plugin would be essentially broken in all
systems with gdal<2 (as in Debian sid9), right?
I'm using current master from debs.
All the best.

Yes, it seems than any 3D geometry outputted by this plugin will not be GDAL 
1.X compatible. 2D geometries should be OK though.
Perhaps there's somewhere in QGIS code base a way of converting ISO WKB to 
old-style WKB ?

Hi all,
I tried to compile both QGIS2.8 and QGIS master with the debian rules.
In both cases the process stops at around 25% saying:

it seems related to libgeos-dev, but I have it installed on my computer:

am I missing something?

BTW a couple days ago I compile QGIS Master without problems

Hi,

we are trying to mirror the ubuntugis repository so users can install 
and update from this (inhouse) mirror.
However trying to mirror with "debmirror" a 403 error is returned. 
Further analysis revealed that "CloudFlare" at qgis.org refuses 
debmirror's user agent.

Question 1: bug or feature?
Question 2: if feature how can we convince debmirror to mirror the repo?

regards

Bernhard

Hi Matteo,

It looks like an I can't find libgeos_c.so error. 

Is libgeos_c.so really in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu ?

If it's not then redoing the configure options is needed (ccmake). 

(Not really a dev)

The Multi-Arch paths are used since geos 3.5.0 on Debian/Ubuntu, earlier
versions use /usr/lib.

These suggestions seem to be more complicated than I require.  I do not need to use the snapper to modify geometries in a custom tool, just to turn snapping on for the current layer when the user begins editing it.  I tried the following, based on Etienne's inasafe example, but nothing happens:

layer = canvas.layer(0)
point_locator = QgsPointLocator(layer)
units = QgsTolerance.LayerUnits
layer_config = QgsSnappingUtils.LayerConfig(layer, point_locator.Types(), 50, units)
snapper = QgsSnappingUtils()
snapper.setLayers([layer_config])
snapper.setSnapToMapMode(QgsSnappingUtils.SnapAdvanced)

Is there another snapper already created by QGIS when editing begins that I can access?

Cheers
John

Hi,

I'm maybe wrong but you'd better look at QgsSnappingUtils http://qgis.org/api/classQgsSnappingUtils.html
It seems more simple and should do the job for you.

The polyfill works.

Matthias, any idea how I make QtWebKit.QWebInspector available in the QGIS
Qt Designer? I've included it by hand-editing my ui.py file, but pyuic4 will
obviously overwrite that.

I don't know how it will be with QWebView, but I suppose will be
similar cnahging slightly the api

this is my common web view configuration that allow inspect

        # set webView setting
        QtWebKit.QWebSettings.globalSettings().setAttribute(QtWebKit.QWebSettings.JavascriptEnabled,
True)
        QtWebKit.QWebSettings.globalSettings().setAttribute(QtWebKit.QWebSettings.DeveloperExtrasEnabled,
True)
        QtWebKit.QWebSettings.globalSettings().setAttribute(QtWebKit.QWebSettings.JavascriptCanAccessClipboard,
False)
        # next parameters can crash qgis if user use arrows after
clicked in the sliders of the webview
        # QtWebKit.QWebSettings.globalSettings().setAttribute(QtWebKit.QWebSettings.SpatialNavigationEnabled,
True)
        QtWebKit.QWebSettings.globalSettings().setAttribute(QtWebKit.QWebSettings.PrintElementBackgrounds,
True)
        QtWebKit.QWebSettings.globalSettings().setAttribute(QtWebKit.QWebSettings.OfflineStorageDatabaseEnabled,
False)
        QtWebKit.QWebSettings.globalSettings().setAttribute(QtWebKit.QWebSettings.LocalStorageEnabled,
False)

I have now managed to change the settings for an individual layer, via the QgsProject class.  But this method only works if the snapping mode is set to 'Advanced' in the GUI dialog (Settings > Snapping Options).

proj = QgsProject.instance()
proj.setSnapSettingsForLayer(layer.id(), True, QgsSnapper.SnapToVertexAndSegment, QgsTolerance.LayerUnits, 5.0, False)

Is there a way to set this snapping mode via Python?

Thanks
John

I've got this working largely as I want - I now have a devtools inspector in
my plugin dialog which F12 toggles (download qgis2web master from Github to
see it).

I would like to toggle the inspector automatically if there is a JS error in
the QWebPage/QWebView. I imagine this is done by subclassing
javaScriptConsoleMessage(). However, if I do this, the inspector stops
working, and becomes blank. Is this because:

1. My subclassing only javaScriptConsoleMessage detaches the inspector from
the web page?

2. My subclassing only javaScriptConsoleMessage removes
QtWebKit.QWebSettings.DeveloperExtrasEnabled?

As you can tell from my probably ignorantly phrased questions, I'm a bit out
of my comfort zone, as someone with very little OOP knowledge.

Hi Bernhard,

I enabled cloudflare recently to speed up docs.qgis.org and qgis.org
sites. I understand that CF is sometimes pickey with things...

We can 'circumvent' (that is in the Cloudflare interface I can tell to
not use cloudflare) them if we use a hostnames for purposes as this.

So ubuntu.qgis.org now is pointing to the same host as qgis.org, BUT
without going via cloudflare.... I think.

Can you please test and let me know if it works like this?

Then we can maybe best fix url's on download page too (plz do or remind
me if your test was successfull...)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

sorry... was another problems to avoid stop bye qt debugger

but could be a snippet useful in case of problems... I use
DebugWebPageinstead of directly the webPage.

about your problem... whou it be set as slot?

this is th esnippet that does not solve our problem but others

class DebugWebPage(QtWebKit.QWebPage):
    ''' custom webpage used to avoid interruption of messagebox by QT
during debugging
    '''
    def __init__(self, parent):
        super(DebugWebPage, self).__init__(parent)

    @QtCore.pyqtSlot()
    def shouldInterruptJavaScript(self):
        return False

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GeoJSON issue
Message-ID: <CAJy=XtcGw1xu77PvJ_UOJyozwcNmc6cGwKkid+uU+hJeLS7ENw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm having a weird issue loading geojson on Qgis 2.12.3 under Ubuntu 14.04
LTS
Features are loaded with coordinates truncated as if they were integer
number. It's a big problem with WGS84 projection because a point like
E11.3455668 N45.4566996 is inserted as E11 N45
The issue appears even loading geojson from URL so it can be easily
reproduced:
For example inserting GeoJSON from with:
http://api.mapillary.com/v1/im/search?min-lat=45.4236627857&max-lat=45.4276518411&min-lon=11.8448906543&max-lon=11.8637224647&max-results=200&geojson=true
all features collapsed to E11 N45
The problem does not reside on source because coordinates in the provided
GeJSON are right.
The strange is that other testing systems do not appear affected ( qgis
2.12.2 under windows 32bit and qgis 2.10 under LUbuntu 14.04 LTS).

Is there Anyone who confims the issue? Should I open a ticket?

Regards.

Hi,

This is a known issue, in relation with decimal separator which depends on
your local.

See https://github.com/3liz/QuickOSM/issues/34

Quick tip : run QGIS through terminal with following command

LC_NUMERIC="C" /usr/bin/qgis 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null

	in settings
Message-ID: <c569d9b28b5b47fb8a4d7431f829fb4a@NINSRV23.nina.no>

Dear devs,

In my QGIS.ini, the paths to the Processing providers are hard coded, which means I have to manually adjust them after every software update (Saga, GRASS, R).
Any chance to pass the updates to the user(s)`s QGIS settings (or make QGIS recognizing the Processing providers installed together with QGIS), or is this only a limitation of the --configpath solution?.

Should I extend:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12623
(as it seems related) or should I open a new ticket (in case this wanted and feasible of course)...

Kind regards,
Stefan

Hi Alex,

Thanks for your reply, and sorry if my question was a bit unclear...

When I want to use e.g. GRASS 7 in Processing, I have to provide the path to the "GRASS7 folder" in Processing --> Processing Options --> Providers
From there, in my case e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\QGIS Lyon\apps\grass\grass-7.0.3RC2" has been saved as an absolute path to my QGIS.ini file in my home directory.

If I use different QGIS versions in parallel (e.g. latest stable and LTR) the path can change. Furthermore, I have to update it manually, after each update of GRASS or SAGA (because then the paths change as well...

This is what I meant, not the source code...

But maybe it would be better to have the paths themselves more stable... 
Recently, Helmut Kudrnovsky did some work on making RStudio available in the GRASS console in OSGeo4W. Maybe something like this is needed to grab the path to GRASS, SAGA or R for processing...?  

Cheers
Stefan

Hi Stefan,

QGIS.ini is a place where QGIS (and Processing, because it is a core plugin)
stores iits settings. if ypu want to have different settings for different QGIS
versions just use --configpath command line option to define different places
to store settings.

Hope this helps

Stefan,

here is a quick explanation

The paths are not hardcoded on the first install. Instead, Processing
tries to find those dependencies (which usually works fine in osgeo4w
distributions),or lets the user configure them manually. Once they are
configured manually (as you have done), that value is stored as a
setting (and written to the ini file for further uses). If you change
your QGIS version or Processing version, the configuration is not
changed, so it will use that value again and again (and since it is
already configured, a new version of Processing wont try to find those
dependencies).

The only solution to that is to have different ini files and specify
which one to use in each case, using the --configpath option

Cheers

Hi Victor and Alex,

Thanks for your detailed replies!
That is nice, I was not aware that the paths are "auto-detected".
I now removed the respective settings from my QGIS.ini and GRASS 6 got detected properly.

However, when I tried GRASS 7 algorithms, I got a Python error:

TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len() 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\stefan.blumentrath\.qgis-custom/python/plugins\processing\gui\ProcessingToolbox.py", line 192, in executeAlgorithm
    message = alg.checkBeforeOpeningParametersDialog()
  File "C:\Users\stefan.blumentrath\.qgis-custom/python/plugins\processing\algs\grass7\Grass7Algorithm.py", line 531, in checkBeforeOpeningParametersDialog
    msg = Grass7Utils.checkGrass7IsInstalled()
  File "C:\Users\stefan.blumentrath\.qgis-custom/python/plugins\processing\algs\grass7\Grass7Utils.py", line 359, in checkGrass7IsInstalled
    cmdpath = os.path.join(path, 'bin', 'r.out.gdal.exe')
  File "C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python27\lib\ntpath.py", line 96, in join
    assert len(path) > 0
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()


Python version: 2.7.4 (default, Apr  6 2013, 19:54:46) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] 
QGIS version: 2.12.3-Lyon Lyon, 02885d5

So, I had a look at Grass7Utils.py and filed PR #2720.
Sorry for the conflicts in the PR (I just changed two lines). I am a git-beginner...
That should make path detection work for GRASS 7 again.
Yet, folder layout is OSGeo4W\apps\grass\grass-7.0.3RC2. But in OSGeo4W\apps\grass\, there can be also a grass-7.0.2 folder present in addition...

Cheers
Stefan

We would like to add a DB2 provider to QGIS so that QGIS users can

We have implemented and tested much of this based on an existing

What is the mechanism to have this reviewed and approved?

Open a pull request on github, and let the automated CI run its checks over
the code.

Tips to get things reviewed/merged faster:
- Make sure all your API additions are correctly documented
- Include unit tests. At a minimum a new vector provider needs a test which
inherits from ProviderTestCase. See tests/src/python/test_provider_mssql.py
for an example. This ensures that the provider behaves consistently with
what QGIS expects from a vector data provider.

Thank you for the quick response.

We have forked the main repository and did a pull request. The code 
development was based on this.

We have also read the contributor guidelines.

Hi David, (and cc'ing back in qgis-dev)

When you open a pull request against the main QGIS master repo, the
automated test suite (https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS) will kick in and run
a test build and run all the existing unit tests to avoid regressions. It
will also run some "meta" tests, checking code quality and adherence to the
code standards.

So that's the first step - open your PR against QGIS master (not against
your fork), and see how this goes. Then you basically keep revising your
branch and pushing to github and for each new push Travis will retest until
you get a green light.

The next step is adding new tests to cover your work. Without tests it
*will* break in some future QGIS release, so that's why testing is
mandatory for something like this. The provider test also runs a bunch of
complex cases against each provider to ensure that they correctly handle a
bunch of corner cases, so it will help ensure that your provider is well
behaved and stable.

Here's some other provider tests which are good models to copy from:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/test_provider_shapefile.py

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/test_provider_spatialite.py

(Note that both also implement additional tests specific to that provider,
eg testRepack for shapefiles). The ms-sql provider test is a good example
of a minimal test, which only implements the things required for the
generic provider test (although you could also omit the
enableCompiler/disableComplier methods if you haven't implemented an
expression compiler for db2 yet). Then you'll also need to include relevant
test data - see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/tests/testdata/provider for what's
expected in the test files, eg
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/testdata/provider/testdata_mssql.sql
.

Hope that helps!

Nyall

test_provider_mssql.py doesn't look like it does much.

Hi,

I have a similar issue regarding authentication and authorization:
We're a part of a Swiss university network which uses partially Portal
for ArcGIS and I'm trying to integrate QGIS to this.
Now they implemented Shibboleth [1] which initially was not made for services...
But since we're the authors of ArcGIS REST API Connector [2] I see a
chance to integrate.
Any solution path for QGIS in order to get secure access to
WMS/WFS/ArcGIS_REST would be appreciated.

:Stefan

P.S. Matthias: We eventually can meet at QGIS-CH GV tomorrow in Olten?

Hi David,
your PR will have to be inspected by core QGIS devs. As it is very
specific, you may be lucky that someone will get interested, and revise
it for free. If you need to speed up the process, you may consider
sponsoring this work directly.
All the best.

Can you share the url of the pull request?  I can't seem to find any pull

Thats all - thanks for taking care of that Richard. I am going to roll out the last changes we made over the holidays that will add the sponsors registry for each project. There may be a bit of downtime while we get that sorted out.

Hi,

Last but not least, make sure that all your code can be actually
distributed under a GPLv2+ licence. This means that the people who wrote
the code are ok with this, and also that you do not use any
non-compatible external code.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Can I change QgsAbstractGeometryV2::fromWkb
	signature ?
Message-ID: <20160126112228.GA23178@localhost>

I've been watching memory corruptions happening during WKB parsing [1]
and found the internal QgsAbstractGeometryV2::fromWkb method not
taking a size parameter to allow preventing such memory errors from
occurring. This needs be changed before it spreads too much !

The current method is virtual:

  virtual bool fromWkb( const unsigned char * wkb ) = 0;

It'll need to be changed to take a size parameter.

Is that something we can do for this upcoming release or should
we just hope all our WKB providers will pass us good WKB ?

Note this all started from OGR giving a WKB which may even be
considered valid but our parser did not expect (3D components
inside a marked-to-be-2D collection).

I think as long as you can make it optional then it doesn't break any of
the APIs and should be fine.

That is just my thoughts.  Maybe see what others think first before doing
it.

I would add a second method with size param and deprecate the current one.
This way we can prepare our own code and remove the dangerous method in 3.0

We do - but wily is affected by this
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cmake/+bug/1527722

Oddly it's only wily/amd64 that is affected.  And the nightlies of the ltr and
release branch also work.

Consider that QgsGeometry::fromWkb() already takes a size parameter:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/geometry/qgsgeometry.h#L141-L145

It's just not passed over to the QgsAbstractGeometryV2::fromWkb.
Is the "internal" call still to be considered part of the API ?

Why not?
Is there a problem with the proposed approach? I would say it is quite
safe and future proof.

Hi, 

I would like to help with the visual changelog - but I only receive 404s
- with qgis.org or linfiniti. 

Is there a different URL that should be used? 

Thanks,

Well, I wouldn't call it "safe".
It is a way to still allow "unsafe" code to run.

It's not even "cheap" as a measure: if every single method has to be
considered part of the API, it'd take a lot of code duplication to keep
the deprecated version alive.

QgsAbstractGeometryV2::fromWkb is re-implemented for each and every
subclass. Each subclass ends up calling WkbPtr which is currently also
not bound-checking, so we'd need another method duplication there.

Each of the deprecated methods would need to call the safe version
with an arbitrarily choosen "length" (max int, I guess?).

Is there a way to tell what's part of API and what's not ?

Another thing to consider is whether the API methods should
be ensured to be found in the library (vs. just implemented
as inlined proxies).
In other words, do we also need to retain ABI ?

Hi

I remember we agreed that the geometryV2 classes are not part of the 
stable API (or was that only for 2.10?). So there should be no problem 
in adding the parameter I guess.

Regards,
Marco

The subclasses state
    added in QGIS 2.10
    this API is not considered stable and may change for 2.12

E.g.
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsCircularStringV2.html#details

That's a good news, thanks.
It would help to have a protocol defined to more easily tag
and identify which classes are and are not part of the API.

For instance, I'm now seeing QgsClipper::clippedLineWKB which
also takes a pointer to unsigned char and no indication of
its length (again, expecting a WKB).

Hi Even,

Interesting - does this mean QGIS will be a WFS 2.0 compatible WFS 
client in the future?

Out of curiosity: may I ask who will be funding the project? How likely 
will this land in the upcoming QGIS version (2.16/3.0)?

We just talked about the WFS client problems today at my new employer. 
We also had problems, that QGIS did not load/display all features that 
were served by our WFS server. Other WFS clients (FME, Geomedia) did 
load all of the features. Potentially related to 
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11968 - I will have to investigate.

Anyway - glad to hear that there will be some work done to improve the 
sad state of QGIS as a WFS client.

Thanks,
Andreas

Yes that's the intent (with the restrictions mentionned in the QEP)

I'll be able to communicate on that once this has been secured with them.

I'm not sure if the planning of the next QGIS version has been decided yet, 
but this is likely something that would be done this first semester.

Thanks for looking into this - the current situation is horrible. For
instance, there's duplicate WKB parsers present in:

- QgsSymbolV2::_getPolygon and QgsSymbolV2::_getLineString
- QgsClipper::clippedLineWKB
- QgsDistanceArea::measurePolygon (although I'm fairly certain that
method isn't used anywhere and should just be marked deprecated)
- the simplification code

There's a lot of inefficiencies happening here... eg rendering
features requires encoding the QGIS representation of the geometry as
a wkb, just to be immediately decoded from the wkb back to a list of
points.... arggg!

We just realized that DB2 on z/OS uses big-endian, first byte = x'00'.

This doesn't appear to work with the QgsGeometry->fromWkb() function.

We have other alternatives but were just wondering.

I'm afraid I'm relatively new to Git - I have mostly used SVN with GDAL 
and GeoTools.

I created a fork off github.com/qgis/qgis onto my 
github.com/dwadler/qgis environment.

The branch is set to master.

When I clicked on New Pull Request, it said they were the same and 
didn't do anything.  Your note stated that this will kick off the 
automated test suite.

Should I be doing a git clone to my development system, creating a new 
branch, putting the new/modified code in it, commit and push back to 
github? Then do the pull?

I didn't think I could do a push to github - wouldn't this attempt to 
update the QGIS master?  It isn't clear how Travis gets in the loop.

For testing, wouldn't QGIS need a live connection to a DB2 database?

Please excuse the novice questions.

David

Looking quickly it seems that indeed QgsGeometryFactory::geomFromWkb() assumes 
host ordering, but the QgsConstWkbPtr class used by the various 
Qgs{Geometry]v2::fromWkb() methods seem to support byte swapping when WKB 
endianness != host endianness. So you might just need to fix 
QgsGeometryFactory::geomFromWkb() to make that work.

good - Should you need any additional funding, I may have some limited

Yes, exactly.

1. clone QGIS master into your own git repo
2. create a branch for example 'db2-provider'
3. checkout your branch 'db2-provider'
4. add your code to 'db2-provider'
5. commit and push to 'db2-provider'
6. make the pull request from 'db2-provider' to QGIS master

Whenever you make a pull request from your branch to qgis master, Travis
starts compiling and runs the test suite.

Yes, you can have a look to Tavis scripts, for example, here is how the
postgres test DB is prepared:

Hi David,
Ideally you should work as follows:

- Fork the qgis repo on github
- in your fork create a feature branch (you can also work in _your_
master, but feature branche are much more clean)
- keep _your_ branch up to date with QGIS master (this will save you a
lot of headaches when merging)
- when done make a pull request [1] on QGIS master (base fork:
qgis/QGIS, base: master) with your own branch (head fork: dadler/QGIS,
compare: your_feature_branch). if you don't see all four fields, click
on compare across forks.

this pull request will get travis involved automatically

hope it helps

ciao
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Icon in addition to layer name in layer tree
Message-ID: <CAPHDReL_36MxhSyx=BxNWk3nLFx-=6MGSUNPE92ivUDUfOHLVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
is there a way to add a user defined icon in addition to the layer
name in the layer tree?
The reason is that i want to visually mark plugin layers that
represent different  time series data (raster or vector) and i don't
want to use the symbology for this.

Best regards
Soeren

I also looked for this functionality, but it seems that you can not
change icon and layer label (not name, just display name)

By default anything that is LIB_EXPORTed should be considered stable
API. There is already a tag which should catch most of the exceptions:

@note not available in Python bindings

If required another one can be added.

FWIW, the main goal should be that people writing code against the API
do not need to update their code with a minor version change.
Things available in Python should be treated extra-carefully.
Anything not LIB_EXPORTed (or private) should be considered an
implementation detail,
For anything in between it has to be considered carefully.
Whenever something needs to be changed it should be first evaluated if
it is possible to leave the current API in place (optionally deprecated).
Exceptions should be treated on a case-by-case basis.
Does this sound reasonable?

I think there are some different stories:

 * Places like the rendering where the internal data structures should
be used instead of WKB
 * Places like simplification that were explicitly implemented in WKB to
be able to work on the data before it's converted to an internal
structure for performance reasons.

git grep LIB_EXPORT does not give much interesting information.
Are we talking about *_EXPORT macros ? I saw CORE_EXPORT and
GUI_EXPORT. What else is there ? Any simple way to tell ?

This sounds easy to break. Aren't sip files automatically created ?

Makes sense.

See above, how to tell if things are available in python ?

What about protected members ?

Is the above assuming every data provider would provide WKB ?
I'd still think deserialized access would be faster...

Hi all,

I have tested with a previously created account, ie with login "kimaidou",
and it seems my account has been disabled. The message is "It seems your
account has been disabled."
Could anyone reactivate my account please ?

Thanks in advance
Michaël

Hi Michaël,

We (well.. Tim) is busy on projecta (the actual django app we use), and
changed the login admin part.
He will backup current data en do a new release. If that is done, we can
enable old/new users again.

So please bear with us for a couple of days...
I'll try to remember and sent you an email, but ping me if I forget

Regards,

Richard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] function to have text smaller (for labeling)
Message-ID: <56A898CA.9070807@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I wonder if it would be feasible to create a function to be used in an 
expression in order to alter the font of labels.

My use case is that I would like to have a smaller line after the main 
one on the label.

I don't think that rule based labeling is the right approach since that 
would be 2 distinct labels.

Do you think it would be acceptable or it is too much of hack to have 
such thing in core ?

Best wishes,

Denis

Hi,

I think HTML support for labels would be a great addition.

What is the main issue with not using rule based labels?  I know it might
be a little extra work but should solve the issue.

It is for a point layer.
They won't be one under the other with rule based.

Just offset one above the other. Should work ok.

Hi all,

I just submitted a QEP regarding replacing core fTools and GDALTools
plugins with Processing algorithms. You can find it here
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/54

There is also prototype implementation at

Will be happy to hear your opinions on this.

Thanks

Indeed.

But it led me to another issue: manual placement of labels seem not to 
be working with rule based labeling...

Thanks Alex! I'd like very much to see this. Just worried about blocking
analyses and editing commands, as mentioned in my comments to the QEP.
Have you already checked the full correspondence between commands, so
nothing is lost by dropping the old plugin?
All the best.

Hi all,

Is it my imagination or is the QGIS nightly build not updating? I'm on 
Ubuntu 15.10 Wily using the http://qgis.org/debian-nightly repository 
and I can't recall seeing any updates for quite a few weeks.

When I check my package manager it gives both the installed and latest 
versions as 1:2.13.0+git20151112+fd9f0bf+23wily

Hi again,

I tried to implement the detection of R in processing, comparable to what has been done for GRASS and SAGA.

This python code finds my R properly when I run it in a python shell (except for the isWindows() function of course):
{{{
        if folder is None:
            if isWindows():
                if "ProgramW6432" in os.environ.keys() and os.path.isdir(os.path.join(os.environ["ProgramW6432"],'R')):
                    testfolder = os.path.join(os.environ["ProgramW6432"],'R')
                elif "PROGRAMFILES(x86)" in os.environ.keys() and os.path.isdir(os.path.join(os.environ["PROGRAMFILES(x86)"],'R')):
                    testfolder = os.path.join(os.environ["PROGRAMFILES(x86)"],'R')
                else:
                    testfolder = 'C:\\R'
                if os.path.isdir(testfolder):
                    subfolders = os.listdir(testfolder)
                    subfolders.sort(reverse=True)
                    for subfolder in subfolders:
                        if subfolder.startswith('R-'):
                            folder = os.path.join(testfolder, subfolder)
                            break
                else:
                    folder = ''
            else:
                folder = ''
}}}

However, when injected into the RFolder()-function RUtils.py it does not change anything and my R_FOLDER - although I deleted that entry from my QGIS.ini - is set to C:\OSGeo4W\bin which of course is not correct...

Any Ideas?

Thanks for helping...
Stefan

Hi Victor and Alex,

Thanks for your detailed replies!
That is nice, I was not aware that the paths are "auto-detected".
I now removed the respective settings from my QGIS.ini and GRASS 6 got detected properly.

However, when I tried GRASS 7 algorithms, I got a Python error:

TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len() Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\stefan.blumentrath\.qgis-custom/python/plugins\processing\gui\ProcessingToolbox.py", line 192, in executeAlgorithm

Python version: 2.7.4 (default, Apr  6 2013, 19:54:46) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] 
QGIS version: 2.12.3-Lyon Lyon, 02885d5

So, I had a look at Grass7Utils.py and filed PR #2720.
Sorry for the conflicts in the PR (I just changed two lines). I am a git-beginner...
That should make path detection work for GRASS 7 again.
Yet, folder layout is OSGeo4W\apps\grass\grass-7.0.3RC2. But in OSGeo4W\apps\grass\, there can be also a grass-7.0.2 folder present in addition...

Cheers
Stefan

Stefan,

here is a quick explanation

The paths are not hardcoded on the first install. Instead, Processing tries to find those dependencies (which usually works fine in osgeo4w distributions),or lets the user configure them manually. Once they are configured manually (as you have done), that value is stored as a setting (and written to the ini file for further uses). If you change your QGIS version or Processing version, the configuration is not changed, so it will use that value again and again (and since it is already configured, a new version of Processing wont try to find those dependencies).

The only solution to that is to have different ini files and specify which one to use in each case, using the --configpath option

Cheers

Blocking should not be a problem once GSoC work will be merged. Victor
and me already looking on this code. Hope it will be ready before 2.16.
Regarding editing GDAL commands, this is not an easy task. But instead
we can add to all algs additional optional parameter where users can specify
options, not available in the algorithm GUI. What do you think about this?

Already checked fTools, it can be completely replaced with Processing. Moreover
some fTools algorithms can be replaced with more flexible alternatives,
e.g. Vector Grid and Merge Shapefiles.

GdalTools also seems can be safely replaced, but I may miss some advanced
settings, as I use this plugin only occasionally.

The checkboxes in GDALtools is why I use it all the time. I can never
remember the correct syntax and options for a lot of things. It's not
always obvious which GDAL options go with which tools, without having to
scroll through the docs repeatedly. Also the quick options for
compression are a huge timesaver. To me this are must haves if the
Processing tool replaces them. Bonus feature, I often use the gui to
craft GDAL commands that save and use in bash scripts. So I find
gdaltools to be a teaching tool for how to use gdal command line.

I fine with full replacements, but that means full replacement of gui
and features not just features.

Thanks,
Alex M.

This should be covered already. You can see the command and copy&paste
it into you scripts (that was added not so long ago)

What Paolo is asking is that you can edit the box where that console
call is shown, and alter the call to GDAL. I guess that's not such an
important feature, since most of the people uses that for copying it,
like you do, not to tweak it.

Hi,

i'm trying to learn a bit of "pyqgis" and cannot find how to zoom to
a certain scale,

here what i'm doing so far using QGIS python console:

###########################################

# Set some variables to define the layer

shapefile_path = r'C:\data\shp\area.shp'
legend_layer_name = 'sample_area'
provider_name = 'ogr'

# define the layer to load

layer = QgsVectorLayer(shapefile_path,legend_layer_name,provider_name)

# verify

if not layer.isValid():
     raise IOError, "Failed to open the shapefile"

# load the layer in QGIS

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layer)

# now i can zoom to active layer i.e.

qgis.utils.iface.zoomToActiveLayer()

# or zoomFull zoomToNext zoomToPrevious

# How to zoom to say 1:10000 ?

#################################################

thanks for any help, Roy

Try searching for "zoom" on this page:

http://qgis.org/api/classQgsMapCanvas.html

That should get you some of the methods you require.

Thanks Tom , got it

what i find confusing is

######################
# This below does not work

canvas = QgsMapCanvas()

canvas.zoomScale(10000)

######################
# This below does work
#######################

canvas = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()

canvas.zoomScale(10000)


so there seems to be a difference between
"QgsMapCanvas" and "mapCanvas"

maybe because working into QGIS there already is
an existing QgsMapCanvas(); the map canvas istance
of QGIS itself, called mapCanvas() ?

Yes. Your failing example creates a new instance of a canvas not associated
with the QGIS interface. Your working method retrieves the canvas instance
from the interface.

I'd not treat protected different from public, both are accessible for
external code.

If it's possible to keep the old API in place and have it deprecated, it
is preferable. If not, I think it's ok to break things for the few devs
that actually use it.

My 2 cents,
Matthias

See the ubuntu ticket.  Downgrading cmake to the version of vivid helps.

Thanks, I'll have a look at that. I haven't been compiling QGIS myself 
but will try doing that with the downgraded version of cmake.

Coming back to this old thread - the issue was reported in #12578 -
and it should be fixed now in master. There should not be a long pause
nor high memory usage for big layers anymore - indexing is done on a
reasonably small area (which may be still much larger than your
current extent - so it is not necessary to re-index after every
zoom/pan). Let me know if you still encounter some problems or have
some new problems due to the changes.

Cheers
Martin

	prevent data loss
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=qfgZRyUyiR5uudzg7U-Z_72n1M7d0vRnJRv+03TnneoA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

It occurred to me that saving a vector layer containing DateTime fields to
an ESRI Shapefile format transforms the DateTime field into a Date field,
leading to the loss of the time data [1]. As far as I understand, this is
not a regression, just something that got onto my radar in the last week or
so.

I think what needs to happen here is for the DateTime field to be
transformed into a String field, similarly to what Nyall has committed for
Time field [2].

Does that sound like the right thing to do here? Thoughts from developers
are most welcome :)

	postgis in a WFS layer
Message-ID: <1454077269578-5248023.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

I am running a Windows Server 2012 server.
PostgreSQL 9.3.5, 64-bit
POSTGIS 2.1.3
QGIS Server 2.6.1-2
QGIS Desktop 2.8.3 and 2.12

I am using a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablet using QGIS Desktop 2.12 to edit
some layers stored in the Postgresql database. The layers in the tablet are
WFS layers served by QGIS Server.

When I toogle editing after inserting some data in the layer to force the
data to be sent and stored in the server sometimes the update is not being
done in the Database.

I can see that the POST http request arrives to the server ok, but sometimes
I can't see a commit (update) in the database and some other times it works
ok and does the commit. 

In QGIS Server's logs I can see (I updated 3 features' data in QGIS
Desktop):

//QGIS SERVER RECEIVED HTTP POST FROM QGIS DESKTOP

WHERE NULL

I can see in the POST data that QGIS Server knows which feature needs to be
updated using de internal "fid" number. My layer, on the other hand, has
"id" field as primary key. Somewhere when it does the mapping from QGIS
internal fid to my layer's id it's getting lost and adds WHERE null to the
query instead of adding where id=1510.


The funny thing is that they have been working for 40 days and hey only got
this problem once, but since last week they have had this problem every
day...Since then sometimes works and sometimes not. I resend the POST http
request from client ysing Fiddles proxy and the same HTTP post sometimes
works and other times don't.

I tested it in QGIS Desktop 2.8, 2.10 and 2.12 and happens in all of them
(QGIS Server is 2.6.1 I think). I also tested it with different layers with
same result.

I don't know if there is a bug or there is some kind of config to the layer
I am not doing properly in server...

Regards,

Hi all,
I'm using the QMS plugin quite regularly now. Generally it works quite
well, but I noticed that after a while the rendering get slower. Has
anyone noticed the same? Any explanation/workaround/solution?
Thanks.

Hi all,
how can I know for which providers does the feature simplification work
server side? AFAIK PostGIS uses it, but what about other DBs, namely Oracle?
All the best.

I'm updating the Users Manual Figures. In my current installation of QGIS
master the GRASS Toolbar only features 2 Icons. Is this expected? I can
only see Open grass tools and Display current GRASS region Icons. We used
to have Open Mapset, Close Mapset, New Mapset and GRASS options as well.

Thanks

	failure?
Message-ID: <CAGZtxQw0uunqRnaFy1kowDYzx0q4O83BMe9xzMmwNcvw__GdPg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a pull request that fails the ci-check because of 2 compile warnings.

I don't see the actual warnings anywhere in the Travis log, and when I
compile locally with clang, I get quite a lot more warnings than just
2, but none of them related to my changes.

How can I find out what the problem is?

Many thanks in advance,
Daan

The oracle provider doesn't.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] AttributeError on Plugin Upgrade
Message-ID: <CAHCHdb+i-URHSGyKt5iwrichbGsX0apbCm53xZfuJMgGh0C8Jw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a custom repo and a custom plugin that I'm developing for QGIS. I
recently updated the plugin in the repo to a new version and tried to
upgrade on my local QGIS install. When I did so, I received the following
error:

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'classFactory'

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/OSGEO4~1/apps/qgis/./python\qgis\utils.py", line 306, in startPlugin
    plugins[packageName] = package.classFactory(iface)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'classFactory'

I've seen this issue before in my plugin (most notably when I try to
use the Plugin Reloader tool) but I've never been able to figure it
out. Is my plugin missing something in the init.py or in the main
plugin class?

For reference, my plugin code can be found here:

https://github.com/spencerrecneps/TDG-Tools/tree/master/TDGAlgorithmProviderPlugin

Thanks for any input!

Hi, it is true, now only it is implementd in the postgres provider.
But it could be implemented easy beacuse of it is entirely similar like the Postgre provider does with the ST_Simplify function.
I propose to test a new pull:https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2738

Subject: [Qgis-developer] DB2 Provider for QGIS
Message-ID: <56ABEF01.8000906@adtechgeospatial.com>

As a novice GitHub user, I didn't realize that clicking on the Pull 
Request button was going to start automated testing of our draft code 
and send out notifications to many people connected with QGIS/Master.  I 
was just hoping to synchronize my fork with QGIS/Master which appears to 
be a completely different and more involved process.

In any case, we are appreciative of all the constructive comments that 
were made so quickly.

A few questions:

It appears that Travis ran again against our fork.  Does it just do this 
continuously once the pull request was initiated?  Or does it recognize 
a new commit/push was done to my fork and fire up again?

How do I find the errors and warnings that are found?  Someone was 
helpful enough to send me a link to them but I didn't see any way to 
find them in the Travis log.

Is there a way to run Travis specifically against our code?  Is there 
documentation about using Travis with QGIS?

It appears that currently the only errors are related to indentation, 
although we wouldn't want the current state of the code to be merged 
into the QGIS master.  Copyright / license needs to be added, improve 
connection authentication, remove excess debug and thorough code review 
internally.

Yes, basically github recognizes when your branch connected to the
pull request has changed, and triggers a new Travis build/test run.
Travis is free for us, so don't feel bad about making it do work!

Right at the very bottom of the Travis log there'll be a link to the
build results. Otherwise you can go to
http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS and look for your
PR number in the "Experimental" section.

If you signup for Travis using YOUR github account (free!), then
Travis will also check all your branches as you push them to github.
This lets you work on and test your changes prior to making a PR (if
desired).

Don't worry too much about the indentation test, that's final
polishing which can be sorted before merge. Concentrate on the changes
you think are required first.

> the QGIS master.

No risk of that. We won't do a full review/merge until you indicate
that you're ready. The feedback so far is just us being
curious/helpful/? and because we're rather
proactive/passionate/(obsessive?) about our code base ;)

Never mind, I've found it already! The Travis log does contain a link to
the compile log.

BTW the failure on amd64 doesn't block the inclusion of the good i386 build
anymore - just in case anyone is still using i386.

Message-ID: <56ACE195.4070705@adtechgeospatial.com>

Should scripts like prepare-commit.sh and astyle.sh run on Windows in a 
cygwin window?
Is there any documentation on parameters for these scripts?

prepare-commit.sh fails to find astyle.sh because it appends to the path 
"E:/qgis-db2-dev/scripts" instead of "/cygdrive/e/qgisdb2-dev/scripts"
I can fix this but am uneasy running it if hacking is required to make 
it run on Windows.

astyle.sh fails because autopep8 is missing.

Are you using cygwin's git?  Looks like it's something else.

You can install it to cygwin using pip.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WKB support is only little-endian?
In-Reply-To: <201601262357.31815.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

I looked into this and tried to fix it although it still didn't work.

The basic problem is in QgsGeometryFactory::geomFromWkb
which has the logic:

  //find out type (bytes 2-5)
   int type;
   memcpy( &type, wkb + 1, sizeof( int ) );
   QgsAbstractGeometryV2* geom = nullptr;
   geom = geomFromWkbType( QgsWKBTypes::Type( type ) );

which is not checking the endian-ness before copying the 4 bytes 
containing the wkb type
QgsConstWkbPtr::readHeader() appears to have the correct logic to read 
and return the type and seems like a better approach anyway.

I changed QgsGeometryFactory to

   QgsConstWkbPtr wkbPtr( wkb );
   QgsWKBTypes::Type type = wkbPtr.readHeader();
   QgsAbstractGeometryV2* geom = nullptr;
   geom = geomFromWkbType( type );

with this change, it worked for same-endian but still failed for 
different-endian.

I believe there is also a defect in QgsConstWkbPtr::readHeader()
It correctly sets mEndianSwap.
Then it gets the type with
( *this ) >> wkbType;

The logic seems to make sense in that it then tests mEndianSwap and if 
set, calls endian_swap to swap the bytes in wkbType.
The problem is that the >> operator in
( *this ) >> wkbType
already takes mEndianSwap into account so the explicit use of 
endian_swap is a duplicate and swaps the data back to the way it was 
before, so it is again invalid.
Taking out the test of mEndianSwap fixes the problem.

This was successful in displaying point data.  However when I tried to 
display polygon data, QGIS crashed.
It is crashing because geometry simplification logic is called which 
reads back the wkb data in the geometry which was saved in the original 
format and is still other-endian and causes chaos. The simplification 
code doesn't use QgsConstWkbPtr .

I tried changing the read function in QgsConstWkbPtr to copy the swapped 
data back into the wkb value but this didn't actually change the stored 
wkb.
     template<typename T> void read( T& v ) const
     {
       memcpy( &v, mP, sizeof( v ) );

       if ( mEndianSwap )
       {
         QgsApplication::endian_swap( v );
         memcpy(  mP, &v, sizeof( v ) );
       }
       mP += sizeof( v );
     }

Any suggestions?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Will not run on Windows Server 2008 r2
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.10.1601301619530.4117@z87>

Hi,

The folks on qgis-users suggested that I ask for help here.  For whatever 
reason, I am unable to run QGIS on a VM we use at work.  As far as I'm 
aware, it's an absolutely vanilla Windows Server 2008 r2 system and I have 
'Administrator' rights to the guest.

I have tried the latest 2.12 release in both 32 and 64 bit versions and 
the LTR 2.8 64-bit release.  Failure mode is exactly the same on all of 
them.

1. I see a fleeting message during install that complains about "..file 
locked", but does not provide any particulars.

2. AFter installation is finished (no obvious error messages) QGis desktop 
traps into the Windows error dialog just after "Initializing GUI" displays 
on the splash screen.

If it makes any difference, I am accessing this machine using 'rdesktop' 
from a RedHat Linux 6.7 system.

I'm an experienced developer in the Linux / Unix environment, but have 
very little knowledge of Windows at the system level.  If anyone can 
suggest some basic steps I can take to debug this and/or provide you with 
more information, I will be glad to go through it on my end.

Thanks in advance for any help you are able to offer!

Steve

Just to confirm - I'm still unable to access the site, but this is

Message-ID: <CAB28AsiY8342GuzOamoBOBKL-kPEaD1K-=3VF5XksqQaESt=XQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

What's everyone's thoughts on this? I think the Selection actions
(select none, invert, select all, etc) should be located under the
"Edit" menu, instead of the "View" menu.

It seems to me that this is much more common behaviour, and a more
sensible location for these actions.

How tolerant are users of such changes? I remember the Quark boss once saying
"never change a keyboard shortcut"...
