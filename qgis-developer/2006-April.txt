Subject: [Qgis-developer] Changes to acinclude.m4 for debian qt4 support via
	apt
Message-ID: <e3e612a60604010313s4c68e971w2e947d4b4369de87@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I have made some changes to acinclude.m4 and committed them to svn
trunk. These are to

a) support the use of qt4.1.0 installed from apt on debian derived systems
b) include support for QtTest

If you have any problems with doing a from clean build on your
platform / distro please report them to me - though I am expecting my
changes to not have influenced others in a negative way it would be
nice to get some verification of this.

Regards

Hi all,

as I have found out with Tim and Radim, in current SVN HEAD there are
still some problems remaining when using GRASS edit tools. They has
been introduced with my changes in map canvas architecture. I think
the only good resolution for these issues is to do some changes in
grass plugin, which means that several new classes for edit tools will
be created in this plugin (no changes for map canvas core).

I know that we'll already in feature freeze which generaly means no
"bigger" changes allowed, however I think these changes are needed.
These changes should not take a longer time - I think of just several
hours of work. So if noone objects, I will start with it.

Bye
Martin

Hi

I agree - fixing this is important and should be allowed within the
feature freeze. Not sure if anyone else objects....

Message-ID: <443131EE.4030709@amnh.org>

QGis Developers,

I am new to QGis+Qt and would like a little push in the right direction 
regarding developing plugins. I apologize ahead of time, if I have just 
overlooked something that is already on the web.

--Most of the instructions on the wiki are for Linux and the 
pluging-template uses aclocal, automake etc. Is it recommended that 
plugins be developed on Linux? Are there any instructions/hints for 
developing on a Windows box?

--My primary target audience for a plugin would be PC users, but the 
plugin would obviously be usable on all platforms. If a plugin is 
developed under Linux is it just a matter of updating the makefile to 
get the plugin to compile on Windows.

--I have been working with Qt 4.1.2 and the plugin-template is written 
with an older version of Qt, is it recommended that Qt 3.x.x be used? If 
it is possible to develop on Windows, does anyone have a link to a 
download site where I can get Qt 3.x for Windows --- Both Qt3 and Qt4 
are available for Debian.

Thank you in advance,
-pete

Hi qgissers,

I will have time to do the implementation of the logger class tomorrow. My suggestion is a header as below. QgsLogger would query the environment variables QGIS_DEBUG and (if set) QGIS_DEBUG_FILE and print out messages or not.
The question is how the output should be controled by QGIS_DEBUG. One possibility would be to have QGIS_DEBUG=1 for fatal, QGIS_DEBUG=2 for fatal and critical, QGIS_DEBUG=3 for fatal, critical, warning, etc. If QGIS_DEBUG_FILE is set, only messages from that file will be printed. Else, messages from all files will be printed. What do you think? 

class QgsLogger
{
public:
 static debug(QString msg, const char* file = 0, const char* function = 0);
 static debug(QString var, int val, const char* file = 0, const char* function = 0);
 static debug(QString var, double val, const char* file = 0, const char* function = 0); //goes to qDebug

 static warning(QString msg); //goes to qWarning

 static critical(QString msg); //goes to qCritical

 static fatal(QString msg); //goes to qFatal
}

Ok for me. I believe that it should be allowed to modify/add
classes and methods even after feature freeze if it can fix bugs
and minimize possible future problems with _existing_ features.

I think this is a good idea.

Here is a bit modified version of QgsLogger with simeple use case.
Simply, I'd suggest to use template member what will make it possible to
pass e.g. objects of class types that have ostream operator defined.

#include <QtGlobal>
#include <QString>

#include <sstream>

class QgsLogger
{
public:

static void debug(QString msg, const char* file = 0, const char*
function = 0)
{
   qDebug("File: %s\nFunction: %s\nMessage: %s",
         file, function, msg.toLocal8Bit().data());
}

template <typename T>
static void debug(QString var, T val, const char* file = 0, const char*
function = 0)
{
   std::ostringstream os;
   os << var.toLocal8Bit().data() << " = " << val;

   qDebug("File: %s\nFunction: %s\nMessage: %s",
         file, function, os.str().c_str());
}


// REST OF FUCTIONS

};

Simple use case:



#include "qgslogger.h"

void foo(int x)
{
   QgsLogger::debug("x", x, __FILE__, __FUNCTION__);
}

int main()
{
   QgsLogger::debug("Error occured", __FILE__, __FUNCTION__);

   foo(19);

   return 0;
}

Hi Marco

I think it would be interesting to combine the logger functions with
the unit tests I am planning. So for example a unit test may achieve a
result but produce critical errors / warnings (Im assuming if its
fatal, the unit test would fail). With this in mind it would be
interesting to propoage __FILE__ and __LINE__ into the logs. I was
also wondering if a simple xml format (or delimited text for xml
haters) could be produced by the logger e.g.

xml:

<Message file="qgisapp.cpp" line="1232" severity="critical">
  QGIS has detected a wobble in the earths orbit
</Message>

or:

File               Line    Severity  Message
qgisapp.cpp   1232   Critical    QGIS has detected a wobble in the earths orbit
etc.

My idea is that we could then record stats across the test suite. e.g.
I run the test suite and  the stats tell give me  a global report:

File | Total Fatal  | Uniqe Fatal | Total Critical | Unique Critical 
| Total Warning | Unique Warning
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
qgisapp   10              6                    5                     
4                10                   10
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all files     100            88                 66                   
22                 99                  22
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This would be very useful way of measuring the growth or reduction of
problems encountered.

Tim

Hi

Adding __FUNCTION__ to my reports would also be useful

It could be nice to have possibility to create 1-3 test reporter for
different output.
This is how Unit Tests work in GEOS.
Test reporter is very very simple code, that just grabs output from
Unit Test runner. Reporter catches callbacks/signals from test runner.

Hi Tim,

Right, __LINE__ and __FUNCTION__ are also important.
XML log file would be a good extension.

I thought that  QGIS_DEBUG would only control debug messages
(not warning/critical/fatal) and the level could be optionaly defined in
overloaded methods (default level 1):
   static debug(int level, QString msg)
It is important for example to have a possibility to avoid debug from loops
through data, for example:

   debug("raster draw"); // level 1
   for each row {
        debug (2, "raster row"); //level 2
        for each col {
            debug (3, "pixel value"); //level 3
        }
   }

i.e. normaly on level 1 it will only print "raster draw", if there
are problems with rendering user can set higher level.

Could we also have a macro calling debug automaticaly with
__FILE__, __FUNCTION__, __LINE__
if available?

It should. The system is setup to add anybody who registers and provides
an email address to the "assign" box.

If you have done so and it didn't work, let me know.

So I shouldn't be advertised to use the link which is wrong, like this:

All the folks who don't follow the qgis dev list enough/at all will
have the same problem. Their eventuall reply might never reach you,
depending on how much they care. I cared to ask on dev list and now I
know. They won't.

Recently I got few emails from Radim via bug tracker, (I don't know if
via Trac or the old system) in which I'm asked to reply to those
emails using https://sourceforge.net/tracker/ in order to provide
additional info as requested by Radim. But it doesn't work.

What do I do so that my replies regarding my bugs, on which Radim is
working now, are stored in Trac from now on?

OK, got it now. I used qgis-developer@lists.sourceforge.net because
that's what the bug tracking system used when contacting me.

Hi Maciek,

I grabbed all reports you submitted on teh SF.net tracker that are still
open.
Here you have them all:

I hope it will help you to find youself in this new situation and you
will be able to use Trac fast. I'd encourage you to not to drop your

Yes all development has historically been Linux centric thusfar -
building for windows has been an afterthought - this is changing with
the upcoming 0.8 release.

Yes. Life will be easiest for you at this stage and you will get more
ready access to help from this list if you do...

Mateusz Loskot has been implmenting a build environment using VC++ -
his patches are making their way into SVN - Ill ask him to announce on
this list when he thinks its ready for general consumption. His notes
on the process are here:

Assuming you havent introduced new library dependencies then in general yes.

Use of Qt3 is depreacted as of 0.7.4 release of QGIS. All future
releases of QGIS for the forseeable future will be based on Qt4. Qt3
for windows is not free/open source which is one of the main
incentives for porting everything to Qt4.

No problem. Feel free to pop in to the IRC channel #qgis on
freenode.net for real time assistance. I would suggest you develop
your plugins against the SVN trunk version so that its compatible with
the new release of QGIS 0.8 when it comes out. I will be rechecking
the plugin generation scripts and tutorials etc over the next few
weeks so will welcome any feed back.

Regards

Please, consult with Gary Sherman or Tim Sutton for details but I think
you should (re)submit them to Trac.
I did so with my reports.

Also, read notes on the first page of QGIS Trac:

Tim, I think the only thing waiting for VC++ projects are QGIS plugins.
I'm not sure but I should have some time near the end of this week to
work on it.

AFAIK cgraefe was trying to work on it too. Though, I don't know with
what results.

No, this is already older issue - the message

> If there is a QPaintEngine error here, it is caused by an emit call
> just after line 215 in file qgsmaprender.cpp.

has been added by Gavin after his investigation about this issue. IIRC
there was also discussion about it in developer list, but I think that
no clear resolution was made.

I would say that best (if not only?) solution for this and some other
problems (showing partially rendered map while rendering and
possibility to stop rendering are disabled) is to use worker thread
for rendering. However such change is not a piece of cake :-)

Sorry for problems. I want to close or move my bugs to trac. When I had doubts
I asked in bug tracker on SF because I did not want to move bugs which should
be closed to trac. Please send response to devel list.

Message-ID: <20060404212808.254d6943.werchowyna@epf.pl>

Cheers,

With Radim's help I have current 0.8 head up and running on Ubuntu
Breezy/GNOME.

First impression: neat, nice and slick. Woopie!

First bugs:

1.
At the _very_first_ run only, opening a project (File, Open project)
brings a file selector saying it's in my $HOME, but the folder is
entirely empty (the attached screendump). Going a DIR up and back and my
$HOME contents are displayed

2. 
Settings, Project properties, Projection:

SRIDSs 172-175 (EPSG 2170-2174) declare "+proj=stere", while it should
be "sterea". Eg.:

QGIS SRSID: 175
PostGIS SRID: 2174
+proj=stere +lat_0=51.67083333333333 +lon_0=16.67222222222222
+k=0.999800 +x_0=3703000 +y_0=5627000 +ellps=krass
+towgs84=33.4,-146.6,-76.3,-0.359,-0.053,0.844,-0.84 +units=m +no_defs 

See how using GDAL 1.3.1 CVS 2006-02-10 I get:

$ epsg_tr.py -proj4 2174
# Pulkovo 1942(58) / Poland zone IV
<2174> +proj=sterea +lat_0=51.67083333333333 +lon_0=16.67222222222222
+k=0.999800 +x_0=3703000 +y_0=5627000 +ellps=krass
+towgs84=33.4,-146.6,-76.3,-0.359,-0.053,0.844,-0.84 +units=m +no_defs
<>

And GDAL is right. In European countries sterea is a better match
for OBLIQUE STEREOGRAPHIC than stere. stere is good America, and if
used for eg. Polish or Dutch grids will yield an error - the bigger the
further from central point. Until not long ago GDAL was also using
stere in error, but this issue was fixed by Frank Warmerdam, as you can
see from the epsg_tr.py output above. QGIS should follow.

For details see 2005 PROJ.4 and GDAL mailing lists archives.

Bug reports are good. Bug reports accompanied with fixes are even
better! You will find under the svn checkout two sqlite.db files under

qgis/resources

qgis.db is the template for user database of srs's (its blank to start
with for each user)
srs.db is the system wide srs database.

You are welcome to provide patches for the latter in the form of sql
insert / update statements.

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0604041653u2cda87aeyd12fabe0ccb04c3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've found that at some point of time, there was a feature that when
capturing points, a signal was emitted and
QgisApp::showCapturePointCoordinate() slot was called, which should
copy point's coordinates to clipboard.

Does someone know whether this is still expected behaviour or not?

Btw. I think it's also against clipboard policy which generally says
that nothing should be put to clipboard without being it user's
intent.

Bye,
Martin

Hi

I implemented that before there was any digitizing support. When Radim
implemented first grass digitizing stuff functionality was taken over
for that. There was an explicit tool for doing this before then if I
recall correctly. It would be nice one day to have a similar tool
again  but it can probbaly best be compined into the identify tool. It
would be best I think if the identify tool showed x,y,value with a
button underneath saying 'copy to clipboard'.

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0604050233q7c35309at26340c753ca51cd8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I just have a question - isn't it possible to use a macro for
QgsLogger::debug call which would automatically add __FILE__,
__FUNCTION__ and __LINE__ parameters? It would save some typing, e.g.
instead of using

QgsLogger::debug("c3", (int) mDiscrete[i].c3, 2, __FILE__,
__FUNCTION__,  __LINE__);

use something like

QgsLogger_debug("c3", (int) mDiscrete[i].c3, 2);



And by the way, could be QgsLogger output a bit less verbose?

This is how does it look like now:

Debug: File: qgsogrprovider.cpp, Function: getNextFeature, Line: 532,
Message: Testing geometry using mbr


I would prefer something similar to output from gcc:

qgsogrprovider.cpp:532: (getNewFeature) Testing geometry using mbr



Bye,
Martin

Hi Martin,

There is already a macro QgsDebugMsg(str) in the logger class doing this, but 
not for variable/int or variable/double pairs. I could add QgsDebugMsg(str, 
val), since QString::number is for int and doubles (but perhaps with ugly 
formating for doubles).
Changing the output is no problem.

cheers,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] v.in.dxf: report
Message-ID: <200604051453.33854.cavallini@faunalia.it>

We tested latest v.in.dxf (CVS 2006.04.05). A few notes:
- dxf R14 and 2000 are correctly imported
- we found problems with R12, but it may be a local problem (possibly a 
corrupted file)
- by default, all layers are imported at once, but it is possible to choose 
which ones
- qgis can open the vector; what is unconvenient, however, is that each layer 
has to be opened by hand (68 layers in our case!)
- TclTk GUI cannot visualize them (?)
So far so good.
What would be useful now would be a way of consistently giving the same 
characteristics (visibility, colour, thickness, etc.) to the same layers 
across multiple maps, and loading them at once. Without this it is very 
time-consuming to use it in real applications.
Overall, great results! Now CAD is no longer a far away world.

Oh. Now I see. Is it really necessary? There will be more like me. And
there will be messy bug reports maybe.

Talking of Trac: yesterday I have submitted several fresh bug reports.
Why aren't they forwarded to devel list?

I'll take this bug for reported being mentioned here.

Radim, All

This problem was cured with installing today's Grass 6.1 CVS. All the
modules suffering previously from "Cannot start module ...
--interface-description" are working OK from Grass tools.

Moreover, I'm only 100% sure for Dutch and Polish grids that stere
should be replaced with sterea. Regarding other oblique stereographic
European grids I only have "a strong belief" that they should follow -
based on what I recal from PROJ.4 and GDAL lists few months ago.
Someone with good expertise in projections stuff should consult it for
safety with Frank Warmerdam and Gerald Evendeed and commit all the
required modifications to QGIS srs db.

Best,
Maciek

We discussed this with Cho and hopefuly he makes it optional to import
everything as one layer with layer name as another attribute.

BTW, you can add all layers to view by double click on vector in
GRASS browser in QGIS.

I think it's not a big problem to work with it.

Hi again

After some debugging discovered the error comes from qgslogger.h here:

#ifdef QGISDEBUG
#define QgsDebugMsg(str) QgsLogger::debug(QString(str), 1, __FILE__,
__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);
#define QgsDebugMsgLevel(str, level) QgsLogger::debug(QString(str), level,\
__FILE__, __FUNCTION__, __LINE__);
#else
#define QgsDebugMsg(str)
#define QgsDebugMsgVal(str, val, level)
#endif


By this logic if qgis is defined without debug support (as mine was)
then QgsDebugMsgLevel is never defined and consequently the message
below.  What is curious is the fact that qgsspatialrefsys.cpp uses the
same function and doesnt give an error...so Im a  little confused....

Tim

Message-ID: <44349611.7030608@mrcc.com>

If you want to take ownership of one or more components in Trac, let me
know and I will make you the "owner". Right now I am the owner for
everything but WMS. When a new ticket is opened it is assigned to me by
default unless the WMS component is selected from the drop-down box.

This is easy to change and it makes sense to at least initially point
the ticket at the person most likely to deal with it.

Some examples that may be appropriate:

GRASS - Radim
RASTER - Tim or Steve
Symbology Marco
MapCanvas Martin

Let me know....

Hi

You can assign me to plugins and rasters.

Hi,

it's ok to assign me to map canvas.
However isn't it possible not to assign anyone to a ticket by default
when the ticket creator haven't done the assignment explicitly?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsMapCanvas & the overview
Message-ID: <2853.60.234.107.58.1144317955.squirrel@secure.niwa.co.nz>

Hi,

While sorting out a map units bug I've found something else that that
needs resolving (or at least clarifying):

Code in QgsProject makes the assumption that the map overview is a
variable of type QgsMapCanvas* (e.g., the QgsProject::_findMapCanvas()
function). This is not the case anymore as the overview is its own class
(QgsMapOverviewCanvas), and does not derive from QgsMapCanvas.
Incidentally, this is the cause of the message:

Debug: Unable to find canvas widget theOverviewCanvas

when loading a saved project (Qgis is trying to find a widget called
theOverviewCanvas of type QgsMapCanvas, but there isn't one anymore).

It seems like the recent changes to how the overview and map canvases are
implemented hasn't been fully reflected in the QgsProject code. I'm happy
to remove/tidy up the QgsProject code but want to check first that this
seems reasonable and is in line with Martin's reorganisation of the canvas
code.

Regards

Gavin

Hi Gavin,

you're right - with changing map canvas architecture I've changed
overview widget to a class derived from QWidget as this seemed much
better option than using QgsMapCanvas derived class - because of
special behaviour that is expected from overview.

I wasn't aware of that it affects QgsProject map canvas handling, so
please go ahead with the tidy ups. Just to note, overview widget is
completely controlled by main QgsMapCanvas, so there's no need to
access it from outside.


Bye,
Martin

Trac requires that all components have an owner. So its not possible to
create a ticket with no owner. Tickets of course can be easily
assigned/reassigned.

Message-ID: <e3e612a60604061204u1d38d98cybcaf5f13aa6187df@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Radim & Martin


Im still using grass 6.0:

ii  grass                                  6.0.1-1ubuntu1             
         Geographic Resources Analysis Support System
ii  libgdal1-grass                         1.2.6-1build1              
         GRASS extension for the Geospatial Data Abst
ii  libgrass                               6.0.1-1ubuntu1             
         GRASS GIS development libraries
ii  libgrass-dev                           6.0.1-1ubuntu1             
         GRASS GIS library development files

As I prefer not to use deps except from apt. I remember Radim saying
there was some requirement to have 6.1? Some time ago I encountered
this issue where grass rasters were rendered only to the corner of the
screen:

http://linux-gis.co.uk/html_old/grass_corner_render.jpg

Pressing refresh resolved this issue :

http://linux-gis.co.uk/html_old/grass_corner_render1.jpg

Is this to do with my grass being too old or is there some other issue
at play here?

Regards

Hi Peter

The plugin builder in trunk is working now (linux only) - Ive made
numerous improvements to hopefully make the task of customising the
generated plugin easier. At the moment only 'core' plugins (plugins
that reside within the qgis source tree) are supported. 'External'
plugins (plugins which are built completely separately from qgis
source tree)  support will be added later.

You can create your plugin by running:

<qgis checkout dir>/src/plugins/plugin_builder.pl

And follow the prompts...

Please feel free to let me know if you have any problems. Ill be
updating the wiki tutorial over the next few days....

Regards

Tim Sutton

You must be in <qgis checkout dir>/src/plugins when you run the script 
or else horrible automake errors will occur.

I ran it from <qgis checkout dir> and it inserted a line into that 
Makefile.am that was really intended for src/plugins/Makefile.am. The 
script needs to check that it's in the right directory before modifying 
the Makefile.

Hi,

from my point of view this seems to be a GRASS issue, because there
were changes to raster rendering in map canvas branch...

AFAIK QGIS should work correctly with GRASS 6.0.0.
I remember vaguely this problem cca 1 year ago but
I would say it was a problem in GRASS GDAL driver.
Try to update GDAL.

I think that you can use MinGW on Windows also. Most of my instructions

Hi

One of the reasons I prefer to use apt only as the source of my QGIS
deps is to better replicate the general experience our users are going
to have. Currently both debian stable and ubuntu breezy / dapper only
offer:

gdal 1.2.6-1

Which is what I am using. At the moment the experience using
prepackaged software isnt too great. Compiling QGIS against qt4.1 in
apt works but crashes on run. Gdal is quite old, and the geos I have
crashes qgis when I do a select features operation...

I will write to the various package maintainers and see if they can
resolve these issues...

Regards

Tim

Hi Radim

Can we move your notes into the wiki at some stage with a link to and
from the vcc instructions of Mateusz?

Regards

Yes we should. Once we get a better idea of how many sessions etc we
can hold it will probably be easier to do...

Perhaps we can get the organisers to give us  a QGIS Room where we
hold our talks and where we can have some pc's set up for general qgis
related use and be available to answer questions etc.

As Im going to have just moved to Brazil I probably wont be able to
make it to the conference, so all I can do is help organise...we need
someone (Marco?) to be 'point man' at the conference and make sure
that everything runs smoothly.

It would also be good to press some live cd's with QGIS on it (Brent
Wood are you still out there?) that we can hand out with the latest
stable and unstable version of qgis on it.

Also it would be nice if we could print some tshirts and have them for
sale there...

Also we should update and make copies of the QGIS flier we had once...

If someone is available to finish pasting the polish transalation of
the flier into the scribus template that would be good...I never did
finish with that because the sentance are too long in polish for the
allocated space and my polish is too limited (read non existant) to
adequately sort that out.

It would be nice also to have printed copies of the user manual in the
various languages (probably eng & german ?) available..

Also we could ask the people doing demos and presentations and
tutorials to presubmit their work / code listings etc so we can create
a resource cd for interested attendees...

Also if anyone is interested in making more flash tutorials we could
include them on the cd too....it would be really nice if we could work
out how to get voice overs on the flash movies too....

Ill post these notes onto the wiki too

What we need next is to discard the ideas above that are crap, add
things I've left out and get peoples (volunteers) names next to each
item...

Regards

Tim

Hi All

and one more thing...

If you are intending to go to the conference, please put your name on
the wiki page at the bottom. Also put your attendance status e.g.
hopeful, preregistered, definate etc

Thanks

Debian testing with geos 2.2.1 from unstable(don't know if geos in
testing works or not) and qgis HEAD works fine and select features
works. I think you'll just need to wait for the goodness to propagate
to Ubuntu. DebianGIS offers backports for stable. Take a look at:

Hi Pascal

I have committed the TS file. You need to run ./update_ts_files.sh in
the root of the QGIS source directory to update all the translatable
tokens. Also note that there may be some small cahnges to strings
before final release so small changes may be needed in the future.

Many thanks for your help!

Regards

Tim

Hi Steve

Right I think I used to use debiangis then stopeed when things were so
wobbly with the gcc4 move in debian. Ill give it another go and update
the wiki to tell the person to add it to their sources etc....it will
be nice if you review teh wiki I keep on ubuntu and check Im not doing
anything stupid - Ill let you know when its ready for review.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Key accelerators vs. key shortcuts.
Message-ID: <200604082027.20745.balazovic@mailbox.sk>

Hi!
For quick navigation through menu items QGIS uses key accelerators. 
Key accelerators are always based on one character of the item name 
(underlined character in item). In localized version is the item name 
translated, so accelerator is logically based on translated name of item, so 
the character used for accelerator obviously differs from original one.
The problem comes out with shortcuts. If there are used shortcuts based on 
combination Alt+some_key then they may be (and mostly are) in conflict with 
key accelerators for main menu items (handled also with Alt). It occurs 
especially in localized versions (in current SVN also with original en_US 
version). 

There are 2 ways how to resolve this:

1. Shortcuts in localized versions are customizable through translation .ts 
files so it is possible to have own set of shortcuts for each language to 
avoid conflicts with key accelerators. However, I think it's not a good idea 
to have various shortcut sets - it is confusing for both, translators and 
users. 

2. Much better solution is NOT to use shortcuts with Alt key (currently 7 
shortcuts affected).

QGIS actually uses these 39 shotcuts (ambigous shortcuts are marked with "!", 
shortcuts with Alt-key marked with "*", after "//" followed with suggested 
replacement):

  mActionFileNew->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+N"));
!  mActionFileOpen->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+O")); // -OK-
!  mActionFileSave->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+O")); // Ctrl+S
  mActionFileSaveAs->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+A"));
!  mActionFilePrint->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+P")); // -OK-
!  mActionSaveMapAsImage->setShortcut(tr("I")); // Ctrl+I
  mActionExportMapServer->setShortcut(tr("M"));
  mActionFileExit->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+Q"));
  mActionAddNonDbLayer->setShortcut(tr("V"));
  mActionAddRasterLayer->setShortcut(tr("R"));
  mActionAddLayer->setShortcut(tr("D"));
  mActionNewVectorLayer->setShortcut(tr("N"));
  mActionRemoveLayer->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+D"));
  mActionAddAllToOverview->setShortcut(tr("+"));
  mActionRemoveAllFromOverview->setShortcut(tr("-"));
  mActionShowAllLayers->setShortcut(tr("S"));
  mActionHideAllLayers->setShortcut(tr("H"));
* mActionProjectProperties->setShortcut(tr("Alt+P")); // P
* mActionOptions->setShortcut(tr("Alt+O")); -nothing-
* mActionCustomProjection->setShortcut(tr("Alt+I")); // -nothing-
  mActionHelpContents->setShortcut(tr("F1"));
  mActionQgisHomePage->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+H"));
* mActionQgisSourceForgePage->setShortcut(tr("Alt+H")); // -nothing-
  mActionDraw->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+R"));
!  mActionZoomIn->setShortcut(tr("z")); // no case sensitivity // Ctrl++
!  mActionZoomOut->setShortcut(tr("Z")); // no case sensitivity // Ctrl+-
!  mActionZoomFullExtent->setShortcut(tr("f")); // -OK-
!  mActionZoomToSelected->setShortcut(tr("F")); // S
!  mActionIdentify->setShortcut(tr("I")); //-OK-
!  mActionMeasure->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+M")); // -OK-
* mActionMeasureArea->setShortcut(tr("Alt+M")); // Ctrl+J
  mActionShowBookmarks->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+B"));
* mActionNewBookmark->setShortcut(tr("Alt+B")); // B
!  mActionAddWmsLayer->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+M")); // W
*  mActionInOverview->setShortcut(tr("Alt+O")); // O
!  mActionShowPluginManager->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+P")); // -nothing-
  mActionCapturePoint->setShortcut(tr("."));
  mActionCaptureLine->setShortcut(tr("/"));
  mActionCapturePolygon->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+/"));

I've submitted a patch to trac, which tidies up shortcuts as suggested above.

Maybe it would be also useful to remove tr() from setShortcut() to preserve 
shortcuts integrity (I've never seen real application with localized 
shortcuts yet, except Trolltech's Qt examples). In case of keeping tr() for 
shortcuts it would be useful to give hint what does the shortcut do (hint is 
the second parameter of tr() and it is displayed only in Qt-linguist).

Regards

Lubos

Hi Lubos

These are good observations. I would like the shortcuts to be
predictable and think its a good idea to look at other applications /
frameworks to see what standard shortcuts and accellerator keys are
used.

Most of your suggestions I agree with, only zoom in zoom out I dont. I
would like to reassign zoom in to '+' and zoom out to '-'. Also I
would assign ctrl++ to add _current_ layer to overview, and ctrl+- tor
remove current layer to overview. I would remove 'add all to overview'
keybindings.

I think th accelerator keys should be set to whatever is logical in
current localised version (ie. that its ok for them to vary from tr()
to tr()).

Remapping alt based short cuts to ctrl seems to me a very good idea....

If others agree to your changes I will apply your patch.

Regards

Tim

Here's Apple's keyboard shortcut guidelines and a list of commonly used 
shortcuts. Apple's command and option are control and alt in the 
non-Apple world.

http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGKeyboardShortcuts/chapter_20_section_1.html

I am particularly fond of the following quote:

"Users expect these shortcuts to mean the same thing from application to 
application. Provide these shortcuts if your application performs the 
associated tasks. You should avoid using these shortcuts for other 
purposes."

> I think th accelerator keys should be set to whatever is logical in

A quick check of some Apple utilities shows that shortcuts don't change 
with language though I couldn't quickly find some Apple policy on this.

> If others agree to your changes I will apply your patch.

Since the patch removes some duplicate uses of the same key, I'm in 
favor of it.

To prevent duplicate uses in the future, I propose adding a list like 
Apple's to our wiki so that we can easily see what keys are available, 
used or reserved. I'll add it to API Documentation unless there's a 
better place.

Ok. Maybe I got my terminolgoy mixed up. :-( I was referring only to
shortcuts presented to the user as an underlined letter in a menu
entry. I dont see how these can stay the same between languages as the
letter used for may not even exist in the translated form.

Sounds good - we could cross link it to the developers welcome pack
which has languished for some time....

This won't be handy IMHO. Zoom in/out and Pan shortcuts are really
usefull only during digitizing. So putting them as far right as '+' and
'-' don't make much sense. Their location should be somewhere at the
very down left of the keyboard - say 'z', 'x'. A shorcut for Pan
could be put there too, eg. 'a'. So the right hand would now be free
to ride the mouse at a decent pace. But what would the left wingers
feel about it?

Or, even better, if shortcut key settings would be customizable. But
this might be a bit too much as for now ;).

Best,
Maciek

Space is already set to do 'mouse locking pan', and arrow keys are set
to pan one screenwidth in a direction. Arrow keys and + and - are all
right together if you use numeric keypad so it seems no hand movement
is required to access these commonly used keys...

Yes one day that will be nice!

I like it and use it a lot while there is nothing else. But still
believe that a regular non-locking Pan key would be better. Especially
for hardcore digitizing. Please read below my ideology.

Not on laptops. And please note that right hand should be free for a
mouse. Left does the keyboard.

Shortcuts on +,-,arrows will not be of much use. Maybe only on
mouseless boxes :).

And also for a mouse scroll zoomin - this is nice, but mouse wheel is
often not accurate enough for controlled zooming. And disturbs the
right hand moving the mouse and clicking. At leat this is my feeling.

The big idea is: Right hand for giving coordinates via mouse and
drawing, the Left hand for panning and zooming within the current view
frame, according to current mouse pointer position. That's most
efficient, propably. I've seen a similar scheme in a cool digitizing
software,
http://www.easytrace.com/work/english/easytracepro/new_in_ET.html, and
it worked very well.

Zoom,Pan keys could  be maybe placed somewhere in the bottom centre of
keyboard to satisfy both the left and right fraction, still preserving
ergonomy.

Just my ideas, for whatever they are worth.

Only? I don't think so. Many people use QGIS like a map viewer - for browsing 
through maps where Zoom In/Out is also useful. For those it is probably more 
intuitive "+" or (Ctrl+"+") and "-" (or Ctrl+"-"). These shortcuts are most 
common in applications with Zoom In/Out tool. (ctrl+"+/-" is used in Acrobat 
Reader, kpdf, kghostview, gwenview,..."+/-" is used in many image viewers 
like kuickshow, irfanview...etc.).

Ok but as you said earlier, this is left handed person unfriendly...

Yes this is good logic. How about this proposal (try it in a keyboard
before rejecting it :-):

                  +---+
                   | Y |
             +---+---+---+
                | G | H |
              +---+---+---+
               | V | B | N |
              +---+---+---+
                 SPACE
              -----------------

y : pan up
g : pan left
h : pan right
b : pan down
v : zoom out
n : zoom in
space : mouse locking pan

The keyboard layout above while not mnemonic allows quick access to
all motion operations with one hand, is both left & right handed
friendly. Note however that collides with some existing keybindings so
those would need remapping. I know some localised keyboards shift the
keys about on the keyboard - would it affect these mappings?

If its possible (I havent looked yet), I would also implement the
arrows, + , - keybindings I mentioned previously as IMHO its 'obvious'
and follows 'principle of least surprise', even if as you say its not
the most efficient or suitable for laptop users.



> Just my ideas, for whatever they are worth.

Good thoughts, good discussion - it will be great to have every part
of the user interface given so much careful thought so that it meets
crtieria of convenience, functionality and aesthetic.

Yes I agree, as I said in the other mail I just sent maybe its good if
we can provide two sets of keybindings to meet the needs of both use
cases....

Well this doesn't prove my idea is wrong - key shorcuts as suggested by
me will do for browsing maps same good as for digitizing.

I'm suggesting an ergonomic, IMO, key shortcuts set.

All those are for browsing 1 page (say photos) or one dimensional
(documents) data sets. Spatial data is 2d at least and requires special
treatment of course. This is to provide smooth navigation and zoom/pan
simultonanously.

So I haven't made myself clear, sorry. I mean only _one_ key for Pan.
It would just center view on the current mouse position. Quick and
neat. Better than locking pan - because the right hand has to press
the key only once for zooming as well as for panning, instead of
pressing once for zooming and press+hold
+move-mouse-with-left-hand-continously for panning currently. I believe
such consistent hand gestures scheme improves user's efficiency on
autamated taks like digitizing (and does no harm for viewing or other
tasks).

If my idea is OK, we would need only three keys. Say
b: zoom in
n: zoom out
m: pan

It is difficult to locate keys in center of keyboard. I would prefer
keys close to the left side with future possibility to remap keys
for left handed persons.

Hello.
Excuse for my english, I'm not so used.

I'm Lorenzo Menichetti, a student in tropical Agricolture from Florence.
I'm not a GRASS or QGis user, but I would be. I'm having my stage with
Faunalia in Pontedera, triyng to learn what sounds interesting to me.

I would like to help to write Grass plugins for QGis. Could be for me a
good way to learn a lot about the possibilities of GRASS and QGis.

For now, I tried to write a plugin for v.build, is attached in this mail
(it lacks the default.qcg part because I didn't understand if I have to
write it by myself or if it should be putted in by someone coordinating
this activity).
It is just a try, I wold like to help more.

Excuse me also for my lack of experience, I heard speaking about GFOSS
for the first time just something like five months ago.

v.build.qgm looks ok except that the 'option' probably is not necessary
as it is suitable only for debuging and it could confuse users.
Did you read instructions?:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Adding_New_Tools_to_the_GRASS_Toolbox

I am not convinced if v.build should go to GRASS Tools or it should
be added as button to the GRASS browser.

When submitting patches you should attach a patch for .qgc.

Please submit your patches via trac https://svn.qgis.org/trac/report
so that it is better archived.

Thank you for the helpful responses to my initial questions regarding 
plugin development.

Before diving into trying to develop a plugin, I thought I would try to 
download and compile the most recent version of QGIS. I had some initial 
trouble compiling QGIS on an older Debian box because of some GDAL 
library conflicts with OpenEV. It was just a simple matter of modifying 
the makefiles but I was unable to find a way to resolve the conflict 
from the initial step using autogen.sh, so I chose to try a fresh 
install of Debian on another box. Additionally, libgeos-dev was 
initially missing and not explicitly mentioned in any of the build 
instructions for Linux, though references to GEOS are in the OSX and 
Windows build instructions. Once everything was in place the compilation 
went beautifully and with out a hitch.

So I thought I would share the steps I took for compiling QGIS on a 
fresh install of Debian Etch, testing release, just using packages and 
libraries downloaded and installed with apt-get.

Great job on the newest version!

=========

1) Download the GUI installer iso from 
http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/GUI and burn to CD.  **For this 
install I used the mini.ios (Intelx86) image which is only 9.2 megabytes.

2) Boot from the CD.

3) Follow the instructions for installing the Debian Etch (testing 
release) desktop environment and standard system, which are the default 
components to be installed. **This is a network install and I would not 
recommend it for people with low bandwidth.

4) Login as a normal user and open a Terminal window.

5) In the Terminal window, become the superuser by typing:
        su root

6) Add your normal user to the sudoers list using:
        visudo

7) Exit from superuser account.

8) Install the necessary packages using the following commands;
        sudo apt-get install subversion automake1.9 libtool 
libsqlite3-dev libgsl0-dev
        sudo apt-get install postgresql
        sudo apt-get install grass libgrass libgrass-dev libgeos-dev
        sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal1-1.3.1-dev
        sudo apt-get install qt4-designer qt4-dev-tools

9) Update the system database
        sudo updatedb

10) Open a new Terminal window.

11) In the new terminal window, make a development directory for your 
normal user:
        mkdir devel

12)  Enter the development directory and download the most recent 
version of QGIS
        cd devel
        svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis qgis-unstable

13) Enter the source directory and run autgen.sh.
        cd qgis-unstable
        ./autogen.sh --with-qtdir=/usr/share/qt4 --with-grass=/usr/lib/grass

14) If all of the packages are found simply type make to start compiling 
QGIS
==========================================
qgis 0.8.0
------------------------------------------
GDAL/OGR       : yes (Version 1.3.1)
GEOS                :yes (Version 2.1.4)
PostgreSQL       : yes (Version 8.1.0)
GRASS             : yes
SPIT                  : yes
Georeferencer     : yes
GPS/GPX           : yes
PROJ4               : yes
SQLITE3           : yes
Python                : no

Debug         : no
Plugin dir    : ${exec_prefix}/lib/qgis

The binary will be installed in /usr/bin

The build is using Qt in /usr/share/qt4
Linking with Qt using -lQtCore -lQt3Support -lQtGui -lQtNetwork -lQtSvg 
-lQtCore -lQt3Support -lQtGui -lQtNetwork -lQtXml -lQtSvg -lQtTest 
-lQtDesigner
------------------------------------------
Configure finished, type 'make' to build.
pete@mwavi:~/devel/Qgis/qgis-unstable$
 
15) Once the compilation is complete, install QGIS
        sudo make install

16) This is it!

**Note additional configuration may be necessary to get PostgreSQL and 
other system component running properly and securely. Additional 
packages may need to be installed if you choose to develop plugins using 
KDevelop or anyother IDE.

Hi Peter

Many thanks for this. I have added your notes to the QGIS website:

http://qgis.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=119&Itemid=86

After your email last week I spent some time cleaning up the plugin
builder on 0.8 so that it actually works and makes a cleaner plugin
starting point. You can easily create your plugin starting point by
doing :

cd src/plugins
./plugin_builder.pl

Note you must run the plugin builder from that dir. I have also
updated the README with some useful (hopefully) info to get you
started - the README will be in your generated plugin dir after
running the above mentioned script, and also appears in teh dialog
that pops up when you run the default generated plugin from in QGIS.

I hope to make a new tutorial to replace the out of date one on the
wiki over the next week or two, so stand by for that. Pre 0.8 we had a
separate svn (cvs in those days) module for contributed plugins that
built outside the qgis source tree with their own autogen etc make
system. I plan to get that updated to create 0.8 friendly plugins and
will let you know when that is done. If you are planning to build a
publicly available plugin, there is the option of hosting your plugin
in the 'external' plugins subversion directory at some point in the
future.

Good luck with your development efforts,

Regards

Tim

Hi

Please remember to post your questions to the user or developers list
(developers list is better for 0.8 issues) so that other people may
answer your questions too if thye know the answers better than me.

You mean its not listing sorted by schema first? Yes we should change
that. Please be sure to add this to the bug queue.

http://svn.qgis.org/trac/

Tim

Hi

Just an update on the unit tests....

I have now build stubs for core, raster and gui libs (Ill be adding
others soon). Ive made a script in tests/src/runtests.sh that will
iteratively run all tests and produce a report as shown attached.

Now we need to start making concrete test implementations....

We could consider a few options:

 - if you change a method, write a simple test to accompany your
change in the stub provided, so next time you make a change we have
something to verify the change with.
- if you add a method,write a simple test to accompany your change (no
stub will exist obbiously) , so next time you make a change we have
something to verify the change with.

Ill be experimenting with the gui automation test facilities next and
then Ill write some HOWTO on creating both non gui and gui tests using
the test framework.

Regards

Tim

Yikes I wonder what is going on there...! It looks to me like its an
issue with your qt4.? How many copies of qt4 are on your system? Just
the one from apt?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Revision 5269 - qgsgeometry.cpp Compilation Error
Message-ID: <443D178B.2090009@amnh.org>

Got this error this morning (April 12) while trying a fresh build of 
Revision 5269:

qgsgeometry.cpp: In member function 'QgsPoint QgsGeometry::closestSegmentWithContext(QgsPoint&, QgsGeometryVertexIndex&,double&)':
qgsgeometry.cpp:993: error: jump to case label
qgsgeometry.cpp:949: error:   crosses initialization of 'int* npoints'
qgsgeometry.cpp:948: error:   crosses initialization of 'unsigned char* ptr'
make[4]: *** [libqgis_core_la-qgsgeometry.lo] Error 1


It is easily fixed by placing {} around the case statements for the switch() that starts on line 940 of qgsgeometry.cpp.

switch() 
{
  case 1:
  {
    blah blah
  }
  case 2:
  {
    blah blah
  }
}


I apologize for posting this to the list and not putting on trac but I am slowly working my way through all of the documentation for everything.  Below is the a modification for the switch() statement starting on line 940 the compiled correctly for me.

    switch (wkbType)
    {
    case QGis::WKBPoint:
      {
        // Points have no lines
        return QgsPoint(0,0);
      }
    case QGis::WKBLineString:
      {
        closestSegmentIndex = 0;
        unsigned char* ptr = mGeometry + 5;
        int* npoints = (int*) ptr;
        ptr += sizeof(int);
        for (int index=0; index < *npoints; ++index)
        {
          if (index > 0)
          {
            prevx = thisx;
            prevy = thisy;
          }

          thisx = (double*) ptr;
          ptr += sizeof(double);
          thisy = (double*) ptr;

          if (index > 0)
          {
            if (
                 (
                   testdist = distanceSquaredPointToSegment(point,
                                                            prevx, prevy,
                                                            thisx, thisy,
                                                            minDistPoint)

                 )

              sqrDist = testdist;
            }
          }

          ptr += sizeof(double);
        }

        beforeVertex.push_back(closestSegmentIndex);

        break;

        //todo: add wkb parsing
      }
    case QGis::WKBPolygon:

Hi Peter,

It seems to  compile on my system even without the brakets. Perhaps different compiler version.
I'll commit the brackets in a few minutes.

Marco,

The use of brakets in case statements did vary with compiler versions, 
by that was many moons ago something around version 2.5 I believe. 
Declaring a variable in a case statement without brakets should be 
illegal no matter what because the scope is ambiguous, but it 
interesting becuase it compiled just fine yesterday (April 11) on the 
same machine without any problems, but I don't remember the exact 
revision, sorry.

Thanks
-pete

If it helps, I am using gcc (GCC) 4.0.3 (Debian 4.0.3-1)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS libs and python bindings
Message-ID: <e8e7199c0604131119t786ac21cpf51554d26253ebe5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to introduce you my plan with QGIS for near future: my
intention is to finish refactoring into libraries which Tim has
started in January and create python bindings for simpler use of QGIS
API for 3rd party apps (and also plugins).

First let me explain why I want to start now and not wait until
release of 0.8. It's because these improvements are part of my school
assignment and it would cause me quite a lot of problems if I don't
manage to prepare it on time. My deadline is at end of May, including
writing a sample application with GPS and routing support and writing
documentation for it.

I would like to do the development in a separate branch ... Gary,
please could you create one for me? I will keep it up-to-date with
trunk, so probably some other development for 0.9 could take place
there.

Let's continue with technical aspects:

QGIS libraries - my idea is to have only 2 libraries for use by 3rd
party apps: CORE a GUI. There's not much sense to have more of them
(e.g. legend library, raster library etc.) as all QGIS functionality
can take place in core or gui library. Also because of on-demand
library loading there's no need to be afraid that it will take more
time to load the libs if they're bigger, because only those parts of
library which are needed are loaded - not the whole lib.

Core library should contain some more classes which are currently in
gui lib because of unresolved gui dependencies - e.g. code regarding
layers and rendering. GUI dependent stuff in core classes should be
moved to GUI library. The result should be that anyone should be able
to create an application without GUI which will use QGIS rendering or
utilities for editing layers etc.

Gui library should also include plugins for Qt designer so map canvas
and lengend (and probably some more widgets) could be included easily
in other apps.

Also I'd like to propose this change for code organization - let's
have only 2 directories under src: core and gui (representing the
libraries), for easier orientation in code it would be good to have
subdirectories for classes with similar functionality. This means that
e.g. composer or legend won't have a separate library, but will be
divided from other gui code by having their own directories.
Miscellanous classes can be left as they are, without being in a
specific directory of the library.

This is an example how the directory structure could look:

core
- providers
- exceptions
- search
- render
- symbology
- raster

gui
- composer
- legend
- layer_properties
- map_canvas
- projection_selector
- ui_files

For Python bindings I've decided to use SIP4 together with PyQT4 to
create these bindings. These utilities are not yet officially
released, but there are daily snapshots available at
http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/Downloads/Snapshots/ and they look
already quite stable after doing some tests.

Paolo,

Checkinstall 1.5.3 from Debian's/Ubuntu's repos is pretty old. On the
project homepage there is version 1.6.0. Also provided as a DEB package.

http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/

I've been using on my Ubuntu Breezy and Hoary with no single problem
for several months now.

Best,
Maciek

Real time GPS tracking with QGIS? THAT would be great!

Would it be possible to install QGIS (together with GRASS even better)
on a Windows Mobile PDA to use it as a mobile GIS with a GPS receiver?

Martin,

  CVS version of roadmap http://roadmap.digitalomaha.net
  uses the dglib library from GRASS and works even on wince ;)
  http://img56.imageshack.us/img56/9744/roadmapnav1tj.jpg
  Then there is navit http://navit.sf.net , but it is a gtk+ program.

 Oleg.

 Even if there was a Qt version for wince, the 25bit operating system will
 have a really hard time :) It would be interesting to test qgis on a Linux
 phone with 128MB RAM running Opie, like HTC Blueangel

Thanks for pointing out dglib library, I'll take a closer look on it
if it could be useful for me.

This app will be standalone - it will only use QGIS rendering. I don't
mean it to be a part of QGIS as it might be frustrating to users to
have all the GIS things in a simple GPS tracking and navigation
software. However it should be possible to add this functionality to
QGIS as a plugin.

Using map canvas from QGIS will bring a great advantage. Most of GPS
software only use a calibrated bitmap for map background. QGIS offers
much more, including WMS client! This means that even if you don't
have any map data, you can still use some publicly available servers.

Recently I've found OpenStreetMap project (
http://www.openstreetmap.org/ ), which looks very well and it might be
interesting to support it for routing. It seems that this database is
getting bigger every day.

Regarding GPS input, I'm currently in doubt whether to use gpsd
software (which doesn't support windows) or to parse NMEA data as they
come from GPS receiver or to use another way.

As Mateusz has mentioned, this will be a problem. But I think it could
be run on Sharp Zaurus or similar device.

With gpsd (or some other abstraction layer) you would be able to do
things like replay recorded tracks or write a simple script that
generates fake signals on the fly for demos and other fun things. If you
read directly from the receiver's serial or USB port you lose that
ability.

Yes, I agree with lars.
gpsd is nice and brings some added values.
Regarding "GPS support in QGIS" I'd stick consider usage of gpsd.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Debian build rules
Message-ID: <e3e612a60604151555t343eac1el63dc613bf120966a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Steve

I did some hacking on the debian/ module to try to revive my regular
build of qgis devel.

svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/debian

It seems to work pretty well, building qgis, but runs aground at this point:


dh_install --sourcedir=debian/tmp
cp: cannot stat `debian/tmp//usr/bin/gridmaker': No such file or directory
dh_install: command returned error code 256

It also gave this error numerous times while working trhough the
tests, though I plan the tests to not be part of the package so that
error should go way I hope.....perhaps it may be nice to build a
separate unit tests package once they do sommat useful....

Example of tests error:

libtool: install: warning: `../../../src/core/libqgis_core.la' has not
been installed in `/usr/lib'
libtool: install: warning: `../../../src/raster/libqgis_raster.la' has
not been installed in `/usr/lib'
libtool: install: warning: `../../../src/legend/libqgis_legend.la' has
not been installed in `/usr/lib'
libtool: install: warning: `../../../src/gui/libqgis_gui.la' has not
been installed in `/usr/lib'
/usr/bin/install -c .libs/testqgssinglesymbolrenderer
/home/aps02ts/dev/cpp/qgis/debian/tmp/usr/bin/testqgssinglesymbolrenderer
  /bin/sh ../../../libtool --mode=install /usr/bin/install -c
'testqgsspatialrefsys'
'/home/aps02ts/dev/cpp/qgis/debian/tmp/usr/bin/testqgsspatialrefsys'


I'd appreciate any tips!

Regards

Hi Again

I think this errorr may be relating to a bug Gavin found inthe
src/plugins makefile.a ... testing now...

Hi Folks

I've spent some time updating things to get .deb packaging working
again for Debian & Ubuntu. I've made a test package and would be
grateful for any feedback from the general community - do the packages
work, does QGIS run ok from the packages etc.

Have Fun

Hi Trevor

Thanks for the feedback. My apologies I should have mentioned I build
using ubuntu dapper. I will probably need to build the package again
on breezy, though I am not sure if qt4.1 is available via apt in
breezy. Could you check on that for me? If it is I will try to set up
a chroot running breezy and build qgis debs in the chroot environment.

Were any debian users able to use the packages sucsessfully?

Regards

Tim

Hi

Current SVN doesn't build on my Ubuntu Breezy. On make I get:

What could that be?




The configure was:

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0604181804g15ac2dcdj51257dbc82ea1fda@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

currently I'm trying to remove stuff from QgsMapLayer which is
dependent on the legend. However more things are not clear to me...

- I'm interested in general concept of layers and layer files in the
legend, what are the main differences between them, what types of
layer files can a layer contain, what features should I expect from
them etc.

- there's always only one file in layer file group, without
possibility to move layer file to another layer file group - is this
an intention, bug or not finished feature?

- popup menus differ greatly in organization, content and
implementation between the legend layers and legend layer files -
which operations should be possible for them?

I could probably add some more questions but I hope you have the basic
idea what kind of help I'm asking.

Bye,
Martin

Hi

Thanks for the great feedback I received on the first trial package I
made for QGIS 0.8 (based on the packaging module by Steve Halasz). I
have added in the missing libraries that caused the first trial
package to fail. If you are willing and able to test again, new
packages have been uploaded to:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/qgis_0.7.9+svn19042006_i386.deb
http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/qgis-plugin-grass_0.7.9+svn19042006_i386.deb

There are still similar issues I need to resolve with the qgis-dev
package - I'll upload a working version of that in the next day or two
hopefully.



Have Fun

Regards

What version is your automake? It should be at least 1.8.x

Right! Recently I have installed some package which required automake
1.4 and has set it as a default instead of the 1.9 which I have had
used before. 

sudo update-alternatives --config automake -> automake 1.9 fixed it

It is easy to get lost. Sorry for false alarm.

A QgsLegendLayerFile represents a datasource (or a qgis maplayer). A QgsLegendLayer has a symbology and one or more datasources. The idea is that several datasources may share one symbology.

If you add a layer, there is one QgsLegendLayerFile in a QgsLegendLayer. It is possible to drag several files into one layer, but the files have to be symbology compatible. Qgis checks this during dragging (QgsMapLayer::isSymbologyCompatible()) and denies the drag if the two maplayers cannot share symbology. For vector layers, symbology compatibility means that two layers need to have the same attributes (because otherwise, there will be problems when using graduated/continuous/unique value renderers). Perhaps there are better definitions (e.g. it could be good that two layers share single symbol symbology), but that's just the current implementation i'm describing. Ah, and this is not (yet) implemented for raster layers. isSymbologyCompatible() always returns false with rasters.

Currently, the popups for the legend layer files come from the QgMapLayer instances, the ones for the other item types from the legend.
In the legend layer item, zoom to extent calculates a bounding box for all the layer files it contains. Add to overview/remove from overview should also consider all the layer files. At the moment, allow editing is not in the legend layer popup, because i'm not sure if it should just make the first layer file editable or all.

Marco

I'm asking because I'd like to move layer file's popup menu to legend.
It's really a question what option makes more sense - first layer or
all. To keep it clear I would suggest that when layer has only one
layer file, editing can be turned on/of (or attribute table can be
shown). With more (or zero) layer files, this menu item will be
visible but disabled for layers and the user must decide which layer
file to edit...

The only drawback i see here is that the popup may differ depending on the 
layer type (e.g. raster layers have no 'show attribute table'). So there 
might be an if in the legend. If now someone decides to add a completely new 
layer type which is not raster and not vector, he needs to go to the legend 
class and extend the if-clause.
But the advantages of having no gui dependencies in the maplayers are clearly 
bigger (and it is very rare that people add new layer types).

This sounds good. Most of the times people use only one layer file anyway so 
they should not be bothered by the multilayer thing.

hello Group
I am a newbee in GIS development.
I read the GRASS Sample data "spearfish60" using grass 6.0.1 vector library line by line, and displayed it using Qpainter and QCanvas but output is no the exact map. Some distorted lines has come in. Also lines printed are not of same no as total no of lines in Map.

any help is welcome,

Is there a link to bug/wish tracker anywhere on the www.qgis.org? Can't

Only from the qgis lists one can learn the address is

Aha. Thanks! But do you think it is easy to notice? I really couldn't
find "Help & Support" even after you pointed me at it. With "Thursday,
20 April 2006" and "Polls" below and a huge logo above it is all pretty
cluttered . But let's just assume it is all my absent-mindness ;).

see if the menu is less confusing now? I added white space above and

Hi

The GrassQt code is not part of QGIS and I dont think there is anyone on
this list who is able to help you with your problem :-( I suggest using the
email form on the grassqt website to further your query:

I'm sorry we cant be of more assistance.

Hi developers,

The identify dialog is different if a layer is editable/ not editable. I would 
like to have it always in not-editable mode and therefore remove some code in 
qgsmaptoolidentify. Is this ok for everyone or is the editable-identify 
dialog used somewhere else (plugins?).

cheers,
Marco

Hi

Yes I thought it was a bit odd the other day when I was testing stuff
and filing bugs. Is your proposal to use the table view dialog only?
And then allow editing by default on the table if the user is
digitising? And if the user is not actively digitising a layer have an
explicit edit button that will allow them to quickly change the
attributes? This would be a good improvement.... Also using a treeview
control really doesnt make sense to me as the information is not
heirachical.

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

Yes, attribute editing is only possible in the attribute table. And the user 
has to press 'start editing' in the attribute table. The table then gets 
modal and the user has to do 'stop editing' prior to leave the table (that's 
because it would be inefficient to check for added/removed/changed attributes 
during each redraw). Also, i'm thinking to make newly added layers not 
editable by default but placing items in the menu bar and the legend layer 
popup such that people find them more easily (as you suggested). The reason 
for this is that there is no need to cache geometries in vectorlayers if 
editing is off, so it's a bit more efficient (and less error prone).

So my proposal is:
-Don't set layers editable by default (but make start/stop editing buttons and 
a 'allow editing' entry in the legend layer popup).
-have attribute editing only in the attribute table
-have the same identify dialog in editable/non editable mode

Marco

It should be excepetion of this rule for New vector layer (menu Layer->New 
vector layer), because if someone add NEW (=empty) vector layer it is surely 
because of creating some new features so it should be set editable by 
default.

> -have attribute editing only in the attribute table

I think the Identify dialog edit attribute feature is really useful in some 
cases. For example I have several maps (map layers) with geometries only 
(from original source it was unable to export database with attributes so 
there is empty attribute table only). Now if I want to fill attributes I just 
click at desired feature and fill in the values for features in current view 
only. If the attribute value would be the only way how to fill in attributes 
this task would get much more difficult.

Hi

I've made new packages for 0.8 preview:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/qgis-latest.deb
http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/qgis-grass-plugin-latest.deb

In order not to keep announcing new packages you will see I have given
them more generic names and enabled directory listings here:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/

So you can just visit that site every now and then to see if new debs
are in. I will always simlink the file names above to the newest
packages present.

Ok, i see that it can be really usefull. But to keep the attributes in sync 
with the rest of qgis, i think it would be necessary (at least in near 
future) to directly commit the changes to the provider after ok (and a query 
'are you sure...'). Do you think that would be reasonable for users?

I think it is better now. More distinct. But my opinion might be biased
as I know what to look for now. Thanks.

Yes, I think that's the better choice than to completely remove this feature. 
Maybe in far future it would be nice to unify 'editing mode' so if 'Allow 
editing' were checked it would be possible to edit attribute table, features 
geometry and also attributes using the 'Identify' tool and all changes would 
be done temporaly and commited only when 'Allow editing' would be unchecked.

Oh! :-( Ok Ill just upload the datestamped files into that dir and
forget about creating the 'latest' symlink. So just browse the
directory http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/ and look for the most current
versions. One of these days we'll get an apt repository set up...

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0604250539i1ea33364p55be6a48f33b0798@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

the last thing regarding handling vector layers to resolve in library
refactoring is to resolve attribute actions. The problem is that
vector layer owns a set of these actions, however these are GUI
dependent (they use QgsRunProcess to run the action which uses
QgsMessageViewer to show the output).

It would be possible to make attribute actions GUI independent,
however I don't think that this feature could be used in 3rd party
apps which will use core library, therefore I suggest creating a
vector layer for core library e.g. QgsCoreVectorLayer, then QGIS
application will have derived vector layer's class called
QgsVectorLayer as before which will be more specialized. This would
enable also more QGIS specific stuff to layer's definition without
having to change basic layer's definition.

Please share your opinions...

Bye,
Martin

Martin,

I can think of a few instances where the attribute actions could by used
by a 3rd party non-gui application (e.g., run an external program based on
the attribute features in the current map bounding box). When qgis gets a
scripting language I can see the actions becoming a part of the scripting
ability, and I'd definitely want to see scripts in the non-GUI part of the
qgis.

An action is associated with the attributes of a geometry feature, and as
such doesn't need to involve GUI classes.

I think that a more general solution would be to abstract out the
attribute actions and provide a specialisation that displays the output in
the QgsMessageBox as present, with the non-specialised version using files
or stdout, etc.

Your suggestion about abstracting the QgsVectorLayer class would yield
other benefits to those mentioned below, and may be a good idea in any
case.

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0604260747u69126bc3vc3abef77c6e8ba0a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a question regarding usage of LIBADD in Makefile.am in
providers and plugins for QGIS. Currently, nearly all of them specify
in LIBADD also libqgis_core.la and libqgis_gui.la. Do you think it's
really needed? If I understand this flag correctly, it specifies which
libraries are needed for dynamic linking. This also means that with
every change of core or gui library, providers and plugins are
recompiled even when they don't need to compile again.

I think this is not needed since the providers and plugins are loaded
only from applications that have already loaded these libraries. Wms
provider doesn't specify them in its LIBADD parameter and seems to
compile / run correctly ...

Martin

Hi Gavin,

ok, I've moved attribute actions to the core library and created an
interface for gui independent output, so it should work for every app.

Therefore vector layer's class could be moved to core library without
problems, so I've decided not to create QgsCoreVectorLayer as a more
general interface.

hello developers
i have a P4 desktop and qgis0.7.4 installed on it.
I have a few queries. After drawing a no of vector maps if i deselect one
whole drawing operation takes place again, which is time consuming. This is
happening with spearfish60 grassdata nd with shapefile also. After every
such operation do we need to generate a new pixmap and put it to canvas.
Also i an not able to put a vector map over a raster map. At a timeonly one
of them is visible. Both maps are of same region. Again same spearfish60
data. I tried to set transparency also but ...

We are planning to implement a composition engine which will address
this issue, however it wont be in the upcoming 0.8 release. :-(

This is a pretty standard operation so I am not sure why it doesnt
work for you - you would need to provide more detail and possibly
sample data so that we can replicate the issue. Please use the bug
tracker at http://svn.qgis.org/trac/ to report the problem in detail.

Hi

Try

plugins -> grass -> close mapset

then

plugins -> grass -> open mapset

and see if it opens this then. I got a similar error the other day
when qgis crashed midway through using a mapset.

Regards

Tim
