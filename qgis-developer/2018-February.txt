thanks for your offer, much appreciated. Would this include also the
inclusion of OTB in the standalone installers for Windows? It would be
good to make sure we always have the most appropriate version, both for
32 and 64 bit.
All the best.

Thanks Alex, Nyall, Victor for thoughts. It indeed makes sense.
What can happen realistically is, IMHO:
* someone will pop up taking the now orphaned providers, as it is
happening now for OTB --> success
* no one will find the resources for this, and QGIS will miss hundreds
of important algs --> failure
Of course this second possibility is scary to all those, that rely on
these algs. I am finding easier since too many years to find resources
for fancy styling and other cartographic tasks than for hard core
analyses, so I tend to be pessimistic, but let's see.
Thanks again.

The standalone installers are made from OSGeo4W packages.  So otb should be
updated there.   IIRC Julien Malik did the last update to 5.2 there.

+1 also from me to the removal of the providers from core. IMHO I would
also remove GRASS, but I understand it could be a tough decision.
The provider system + plugin architecture provide all the means to keep
them separate from the core.

We all agree, I guess, that less is better then more, to guarantee the
highest quality we can afford.

Hi all,

I am also in favour of removing all the work that is not directly related
to QGIS.
But I'd also like to ask if there is already a plugin available (on
github?) that for e.g. readds the GRASS functionality?
Furthermore I'd like to know if it is possible to create a plugin for
official stable GRASS and GRASS development version, which in the best case
can be installed side by side?
(Same applies to SAGA and all the other providers).

I am sure there is a huge possibility that an ecosystem will be created
around those kind of plugins.

kind regards
Werner

OTB is not using ogeo4w for a long time. So OSGeo4W users are stuck on old
version. We have zero interest in pushing packages back again
Windows users can use otb from its binary package, build from source , or
maintain osgeo4w or whatever seems interest.

Hi Werner,

there are no plugins for SAGA and GRASS, but this is just because they
are in core.
Also seems we need to clarify, removal from core does not means wiping
all stuff,
this just mean that existing code will be separated into plugin and
published on GitHub
and QGIS plugins repository. Then interested people can take ownership
and continue
development and maintenance.

Exactly in the same way we removed LiDAR tools provider (now
maintained by Martin Isenburg)
and TauDEM provider (maintained by me, along with several others
Processing providers).

Hello,

Processing plugin allows to integrate other toolboxes. IIUC, this was one
of the features of it.
So when you say integration of so and so toolboxes are total mess, you
might think back.

Nobody had seen new changes to otb algs so all of your comments are on old
version.  Why so rush?
Okay, it easy to reject stating the same reason over and over again. I
understand that.
What happens at end, a processing plugin with zero providers?

Now the reason OTB had to maintain list of "supported" version is due the
fact that processing plugin does not allow to group parameters.
So the issue of a provider being total mess not fully related to provider
itself. If 90% of provider algorithm which you use, cannot be even
integrated into processing where will be the actual problem. I see a lot of
good changes in qgis processing and providers can greatly benefit from it
now.

All those people blindly rejecting this proposal should have waited for new
changes.
I mean, I just put a proposal to lower the burden as much as possible. And
all those issues raised by Alex, Nyall and others will be considered in the
new diff.
Once I prepare changes, you can reject it!. You are voting -1ss on old
plugin code something I consider a mess to work with for both teams.

My initial question was only to see if there are other issues than the
maintenance overhead?
By now, I conclude that only issue was maintenance overhead and I proposed
it can be solved.

Hi Alex,

Thats exactly what I meant.
I know that (currently) there are no plugin for SAGA and GRASS but if I
understood everything correctly the point is to create such plugins.
My Question was more or less if there is already code existing for it or if
we have to wait until they are removed before the plugins can appear - but
this is now answered.

Waiting for the plugins ;)
And hopefully good documentation howto bring new algorithms alive..

thanks and kind regards
Werner

Hi Werner,

code already here:
 - grass https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7
 - saga https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/saga

Only small updates are needed to turn it into plugins. I can turn them
into plugins and
publish if there is an agreement about this approach. Then I will be
happy to transfer
ownership to any interested person.

Some documentation about adding new algorithms to GRASS provider can be found
in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/grass7.txt,
but it is slightly outdated. Same approach used for SAGA.

and again... I agree. In fact the example that I brought here (once
more) was about a basic GIS functionality (that unfortunately despite
being broke hasn't stopped us to make new releases).

For such cases I like the idea of having a mini panel (2 people, maybe
better 3 like 1 developer, a power user and the release manager?) to
untie this cases.

Thanks Rashad for clarifying. In this case, I'd strongly advise removing
OTB from osgeo4w ASAP.
Could you or Julien please do it?

I agree that, in case we decide to follow this route, publishing a first
version of the providers and having a reasonably complete documentation
on how to proceed is crucial for the future of the providers.
All the best, and of course thanks Alex and others for your work on this!

did you try if the same operation (same inputs and parameters) also

If yes then is a SAGA issue, if not is ours.

I could take care of the description files of such plugins (as I do it
in the core providers), but... I'm not really sure about removing
GRASS and SAGA from QGIS installers. Is true that most if users don't
do any analysis, but having hundreds of tools (that we know for sure
will never be implemented as native QGIS tools) out of the box was and
still is a very important "selling" point. I ask to please take this
decision keeping this aspect in mind. Regarding SAGA LTR I understand
the frustration pf many Linux users (I'm among them), but we have to
look also at the big picture, and that is Windows. After having
decided to support only SAGA LTR (because we know we can't keep the
pace with non LTR SAGA underlying changes) we are now finally at a
point (at least in QGIS 2.18) where users can reliably count with this
tools.

cheers!

Only one specific comment: I don't think qgis2threejs is less important with
the arrival of QGIS3 3D functionality. The latter doesn't allow easy export
to the web, so I think the plugin is still very very important, and should
be featured.

Thanks

Tom

as I mentioned, it will always be very difficult to choose, so user
feedback is usually more important than our opinion

I'm afraid it is not true, there are lot of issue even with LTR SAGA, see
for example https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17726. There are also some
recent threads in developers mailing list about broked SAGA and GRASS
modules.

Well, to be precise it did not received much attention from its inclusion into
core, there were tickets filed for this Provider which was not addressed for
years, e.g. issues with R plots, handling different types of parameters.

I'm not a bit R fan and user, so updating this provider to QGIS 3 for me is
lower priority then updating other plugins or doing some work on QGIS core.

quite understandable, nobody could possibly blame you.
the fact remains that before removal users were able to do stuff in R
from QGIS, and now they can't.
IMHO we should avoid the same for GRASS and SAGA.
All the best, and thanks.

IMHO, if it is really important for them, they should find a way
to contact devs and support development.

R provider was removed from core in May 2017 and as far as I can see
nobody asked about it in mailing lists. So I suppose it is not important.

Hello all

I've narrowed down the qgis2web QGIS3 crash further:

- QGIS crashes if the plugin dialog is closed when a Leaflet preview *is
currently visible*

- QGIS does not crash if the plugin dialog is closed when a Leaflet preview
is not currently visible, *even if a Leaflet preview has been triggered
while the dialog is open*

So it's not the Leaflet preview itself which causes the crash, but closing
an "open" Leaflet preview.

Can anyone help? I still don't know why this is happening.

Thanks

Tom

unfortunately users are often silent. but I agree, this is a way of
stimulating they reactions.
perhaps we could accompany this with a crewdfunding campaing, or anyway
with a wider announcement "if you want it, do something for it".

ok is not perfect :) but is for sure is much better compared when we
tried to keep the pace with SAGA changes.

Hi,

Agreed with Tom about qgis2threejs not being replaced by QGIS 3D.

One thing I think could also help to better identify the most used plugins
by the community is reviewing the stats shown. I mean, some plugins have a
lot of versions, meaning that a user might have downloaded many times the
same plugin (sometimes, twice in a month) but afaict, the stats shown is
the sum of all versions. This can also mislead users because you think that
the bigger user base the better a plugin might be.
We should either show:
- the maximum of the downloads (all versions included )
- the mean of all (stable) downloads
- or the latest version download (or the max between the current and the
previous version)
This way, it'll also be fair for the plugin authors that thoroughly tested
their plugins before releasing it as stable, hence have few number of
versions (and less multidownloads to count). And there will be more chance
for turnover at the top when sorting the plugins list by number of
downloads or looking to the most popular list.

my 2cts,
Harrissou

Hi Harrissou

My argument against that is that it encourages plugin authors not to update
their plugins. As users are probably aware, I release versions often. This
means that a single version never gets very high in usage numbers. I would
argue that "release early, release often" is A Good Thing, assuming plugin
versions are tested and stable.

Thanks

Tom

Hi, 

For some reason I did not manage to read the responses to the thread at
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2018-January/051678.html
- perhaps I accidentally deleted the responses together with some e-mail
trash. So sorry for not replying directly to this e-mail thread. 

Anyway - good to see that I am not alone and that others are also
affected with this warning. 

Is there any chance that the warning could spit out more information -
e.g. what layer is triggering the issue? I have so many layers in the
project that it is quite hard for me to find the needle in the haystack.


I know that the warning is harmless, but because I have other issues in
the project and need to work with these log messages, they hide all the
other useful information in the log. 

Thanks, 

Adnreas

Hi Andreas

Were you able to add QgsProject.instance() as a new third argument to your
calls to QgsCoordinateTransform(). That got rid of the warnings for me.

Hello,

Is there a way to hide and show parameter widgets in Algorithm dialog?
current qgsprocessing from master has a FlagHidden for parameters. but this
should be done before loading algorithm. Once it's loaded, based on user
input (say change of selection in QComboBox) I cannot show or hide
parameters again.

I think there's a misunderstanding/language barrier at play here -
no-one meant that the code is a mess, just that the end result of the
QGIS team trying to maintain 3rd party providers resulted in an
inferior experience all round - for users, qgis developers AND the
underlying library developers (whom I'm sure don't appreciate being
blamed when a QGIS processing algorithm is mis-using their API).

Yes, one of Processing's big strengths is its ability to integrate
other toolboxes and make 3rd party libraries accessible within the
QGIS environment and tie them together into models. Another one of
QGIS' great strengths is its strong plugin ecosystem, which allows
anyone the ability to create plugins and extend QGIS, and not be tied
into the core QGIS development practices and release schedules. That's
why plugin-based providers are the BEST solution in my opinion.

Just to be clear - no-one is commenting on your code quality or
targeting OTB specifically. It's the question of whether or not
Processing providers which depend on other libraries should be
included in the main install or moved to plugins which we are
debating. So please, don't take any of this as criticism of your code
or (much appreciated) efforts.

> What happens at end, a processing plugin with zero providers?

Far from it. My vision would be:

- core install: only includes the native QGIS providers (c++, Python
and 3D) and the GDAL/OGR provider (since it's impossible to build QGIS
without GDAL we can be 100% sure that it's always available wherever
QGIS is installed). Maybe GRASS provider too, since GRASS is very
heavily linked into QGIS due to the GRASS provider and c++ GRASS
plugin.
- via QGIS' plugin ecosystem: a whole world of providers ready to
install for users, including SAGA, OTB, lastools, R, PySAL, etc...

Can you elaborate on this please? I'm not aware what the "group

Why? In the past we've always found that discussing plans upfront
benefits everyone and prevents development effort in an approach which
won't be accepted upstream.

In summary, can you please outline the reasons why you think
publishing this as a plugin is not ideal?

The debug information should give the full path to the function which
is missing the context.

It's not layer dependent, and instead is caused by bits of QGIS which
are just not upgraded to handle transform contexts and datum
transforms correctly. The warnings are shown for debug builds only
(not release builds - so the final release won't suffer the overhead
of all the debug prints) in order to allow us to identify these code
areas.

The major remaining ones are:

- all raster layers ignore datum transforms (and have since forever)
- some data providers are not transform aware (XYZ layers for instance
trigger a lot of these warnings)

If it comes down to it close to final release, we could hack in some
QgsProject::instance() calls to force the correct transform handling
for these remaining areas. But that causes issues with server, and
will probably turn Martin into a quivering mess hiding in his
cupboard... (or a raging hulk... I don't want to find out which!).

Alternatively if someone has some hidden 3.0 funds available adding
datum handling to rasters would be a good last minute fix...

You run your own build, right? You could delete the block in
qgscoordinatetransform.cpp lines 588-591, qgsmapsettings.cpp lines
365-368 and qgsrendercontext.cpp lines 111-114.

Actually, it's *probably* a bug somewhere deep in Qt/webkit.

I'd try some workarounds like intercepting the dialog close events and:
- deleting the web preview widget manually
or
- setting its html to a blank page

Hope that works. I understand how frustrating and time consuming
issues like this in the underlying libraries can be, and totally
sympathise with your pain.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3.0 Processing plugin - handling multiple
	outputs
Message-ID: <1517533414718-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

I'm updating my QGIS processing plugin algorithm from 2x - 3x.  The algorithm
generates and outputs one to many rasters. The number of output rasters is
unknown until the algorithm is run and depends on the input parameters.

In my QGIS 2x version, I just set a processing.core.outputs.OutputDirectory,
dumped all the rasters in there and then added them to the map using the
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer method.  A bit dodgy, but the 2x
version was just a quick proof of concept.

Is there a recommended approach for QGIS 3x in the processing framework to
handle an unknown number of outputs?  Or should I just  do something similar
to my 2x version, set a
QgsProcessingParameterFolderDestination/QgsProcessingOutputFolder and add
them to the map via QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer?


Regards
Luke

Perhaps the plugin should provide an OTB binaries install mechanism once it runs and inspects the platform it is on.

Hi Rashad,

plugin code is in python. so nothing much to worry on binaries part and they depend on qgis processing code.
QGIS had removed otb plugin from processing and kept others. So there is another stuff to work on user side and developer side.

Hell Tisham,

Can you explain the part of binaries issue?

The documentation of build from source is already there for OTB. The new module which if merged into Modules/Wrappers/QGIS will be like any other otb module.
Since there are no external dependencies, this could be enabled by default. So need to specific documentation to build it is not required.

But once the coding work is done, there will be another (RFC) and in that i will include the usage, builds options etc..

Message-ID: <CAB28Asha0nUx+kdj7Pg81qG7MZQnr2FEXFOsywbdyZMzXMmVGw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to track down specific information on what the NULL
QVariant issue is and what the intention is behind the code at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/core/conversions.sip#L2237

I believe this code may be the source of some large memory leaks I'm
seeing with the Python bindings - unfortunately my fix for the memory
leaks (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6221) results in random,
unpredictable crashes with the Python bindings (seen so far with
methods which return QgsPoint and QgsGeometry objects).

My suspicion is that this NULL handling code may be causing issues
with classes which are QVariant user types, and I'm wondering if it's
safe to exclude user types in this code block. Without knowing what
the issue the code is trying to avoid I'm reluctant to make any
changes to the logic here.

Can anyone give some insights here? Was that block of conversion code
taken from another project or is it unique to QGIS?

Yes. This is my current proposal to otb provider. And the code will be less
and simpler than grass, saga etc..
But unless I finish coding part, It's not easy to have a discussion as
everyone refers to old version all the time.

Seems that way.   It was introduced in 89b7a4aaa2a21a5c4a073da5c91bede0ffb837c0

I already do that to save some settings:

Thanks to your suggestion, I did some tests, and the overwritten closeEvent
function either doesn't fire at all undr the crash circumstances, or the
crash occurs before the first statement in my custom closeEvent(). This
means I don't get the chance either to:

closeEvent() *does* execute if the preview pane is either blank or contains
an OpenLayers preview.

Is the Qt version in the OSGeo4W dev nightly built with any debug
output/symbols? If not, is there a way I can use such a debug version?

Thanks

I never said you commented on code quality. I said everyone should comment
on new code.
But there are comments and or decisions made on old one  codebase even the
thread started with updating and cleaning up stuff.
And I did said that all your comments about that is valid and reasonable.

Hence, I suggested that to see if all your points to keep providers out
still stands with new code. (not done yet)
For SAGA and others, I cannot speak much because I am not involved in it.
so if it feels like I was targeting OTB, this was not against anything.
But I guess saga or even grass is not planning for similar support for qgis
provider like OTB.
 And maybe this is the case for R and others. So that make sense to remove
it from plugin.

If there is one plugin provider which has mostly code tied to processing
then it will be easy for QGIS.
Consider this, OTB plugin was moved out of qgis some time ago and after
that came a lot of changes to qgis processing.
change of parameter names, moving code to c++ etc.. Now GRASS, SAGA etc got
all these changes because it was in tree.
I understand the idea behind removing otb. If this provider wasn't such a
mess to maintain it would have stayed. Even though it
attains the same complexity level as others. I don't agree that it should
be so complex.

And IMHO, the point being this providers are hard to maintain itself lies
with processing plugin and not individual providers or qgis core.
Be it OTB, GRASS , SAGA or anything.

In case of GDAL, I agree. But I (and many other users) don't have GRASS and
SAGA installed.
So this is some kind of assumption that I cannot fully agree. GRASS
provider still has all of descriptor for grass7 in your tree.
And this was/is the case of OTB for now. New changes will not need a
descriptor file in your tree.
OTB installation will provide a descriptor file in the format needed by
qgis processing!

Yes. most of the concern was more with installation of external tools for
users.

Just that it requires external tools. We understand that totally. But what
we don't agree is your assumption that so and so tools is already for most
of qgis users.
Even if grass or saga is installed, one has to configure it to use. So the
problem of installing something for users seems to be key here.
Now GDAL is not considered an external tool because you need it to build
qgis. I am talking of other providers and not just OTB.

OTB application allows use of parameter with sub parameters,
One such example is here:
https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/CookBook/Applications/app_Smoo
thing.html#parameters
https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/CookBook/Applications/app_Trai
nImagesClassifier.html#parameters

There is a parameter called "type" in Smoothing application. "type"
parameter has list of values such as mean, gaussian and anidif.
The ui widget of this parameter is obviously a comboBox.
This flexibility allows users to select which type of smoothing to apply.
Rather than having a three application namely
smoothing_mean, smoothing_gaussian, smoothing_anidif

so parameter type.* (type.mean.radius, type.gaussian.radius, etc..) etc are
child of parameter called "type".
So you can call "type" parameter a group.

A user of application can select -type gaussian -type.gaussian.radius 3
when launching application.
otb application check for invalid cases such as if type is gaussian then
one cannot use -type.mean.radius
This is okay for command line, but for graphical interface one has to hide
/show parameters based on the value of it's parent.

This is a limitation of qgis processing that upstream was forced to split
applications based on group. I am not blaming or targeting here.
Just saying about a missing feature for support for one provider.

 QGIS users now have three application for smoothing and maybe 10 or more
application for TrainImagesClassifer.
This make users of  otb provider as well as developers of both qgis and otb
unhappy.  Perimeter of bug report is getting more and more
And nobody wants to work on this part.

Now, this can be fixed by allowing plugin providers to hide/show any of the
parameters in the ui.
The rule to hide/show can be left out to provider itself.  This change must
go in qgis processing and not in provider plugin.

If qgis processing plugin has a new widget that allows this, then things go
easy.  You can keep providers as external plugin.
But provider will make use a qgs processing ui widget which is already in
tree.  That makes sure it is tested properly among other things.
Provider will be free from hacks such as splitting applications and doing
stuff specific to some version(s)
And this widget can be reused by existing or new providers also.

I am attaching some screenshots from otb application viewer to visual
explanation.
scheme_parameter.png shows the grouping of parameters.
and the other two explains the show/hide of parameters based on value of
parameter "type"

Very interesting. Wouldn't make sense to have it upstream? This would be
useful also for other providers.

This was originally made on purpose, with the idea of having simplified
atomic commands. Nowe the ecosystem is more riche, and there is room for
more complex interfaces.

Thanks for your input.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Broken 'randomness' for new layer styles?
Message-ID: <f0e192e0-f755-a0b4-8712-ef136dcf512c@duif.net>

Somebody (Raymond ;-) ) 'complained' to me that running a processing
algorithm everytime comes up with an (ugly) brown style.

While (I think) the styling of a newly added/created vector layer should
be more or less random..., what I see is that the colors (at least here
with me) often start with a couple of times brown, then another color
then again two times another color (exact same rgb values) etc etc.

So my question is:
- how 'random' should these colors be?
- would it be an idea to create some (nicer colored) color list, which
would then be used to select (random?) colors from.

To check:
- open (in master) whatever point layer.
- search for Buffer algo in processing toolbox

Hi,

For implementing this feature,  one assume that such a time information is available from the target layer ? Is that the case ? It is done in a normalized way ?

Allow me to disagree. This statement assumes that having a higher number of
downloads is more important for plugin devs than having a more featured or
less buggy plugin. And while having a large user base is for sure
rewarding, i'm pretty sure (and I guess you, too) it's not the objective of
most of the developers. I think the best way to have that "recognition" is
to provide working and stable plugin.
Why would someone update a code if there's no reason? Not all plugins out
there are based on different/upstream libraries: some are just few lines
extending current capabilities of QGIS. As long as it works without bugs
and is still compatible with newer versions of QGIS, why updating?
I don't think that there's a good reason to "hide" them.

As users are probably aware, I release versions often. This

current system is a "good" reason to push devs regularly publish new
versions, whether heavily tested or not (knowing or expecting that their
user base will update, once again). Btw, for new (version of) plugins it
could be nice to show their changelog in Plugin manager before user
downloads it (another feature request, sorry!).

Maybe a solution will be to show both values (sum and max), but still it
doesn't help to decide whether a plugin is eligible to the "Most popular"
list. Anyway, I think that, like for featured plugins, a fairer solution
needs to be found here too.

while being passionate about stats, I still believe in this case user
feedback and rating is our best option here.
not by chance is the way we all choose apps on our phones.
all the best.

 Hi all,

I think this new approach is more or less the same approach used in the
early times of Sextante, before it is ported to QGIS core and become
Processing.

I remember that Sextante at that time had a very good feature, being an
external plugin, that was the updates. They were not dependent of the QGIS
release schedule, and so bugs were solved and new versions made available
very quickly.

Having the providers as plugins, we will regain this flexibility. The
counterpart is that there may be providers that may no longer exist in
Processing, due to lack of workforce. But getting them integrated, without
this workforce, lacking maintenance, is not a good idea either.

So I think this new approach, taking pros and cons, might work well.

I understand Rashad who thinks it would be better to have all providers,
out-of-the-box, after installing QGIS, but we can not get the best of both
worlds in just one. And it seems to me, that OTB's integration into QGIS is
assured, at least as much as it depends on Rashad's will!

Best regards,
Pedro

This functionality was available for years. But most of the users don't bother
with reading what devs wrote in the plugin metadata.

Hi all,
Giovanni kindly sent me a lists of all tickets last updated before
01-01-2015. I'd like to invite everyone (perhaps also more recent ticket
authors) to revise their own tickets, and check whether they still apply
to QGIS3. This will make in any case easier an eventual transitions to
GH or whatever. I see two choices to prepare a mass mailing:
* one email per author, listing their tickets
* adding back the "Bugs reported by me" default query (I can't find it
any more, any special reason to remove it?) and send a mail to all
authors pointing to it.
The second seems easier, the first can bring a higher motivation.
Opinions? Anyone willing to prepare the mass mailing (I think we may
have problems with antispam here, if not properly done)?
Thanks.

yes, as it stands has little relevance; that's why I'm suggesting to add
more sugar to it, making it more prominent and kindly pushing users to
cast their vote, add comments etc.

oh, strangely enough I don't. I only see:

Custom queries

    Bugs causing Crash
    Bugs closed
    Bugs with "Feedback" status (last updated > than 15 days ago)
    Explicit links to redmine
    High priority
    High priority grouped by affected version
    High priority grouped by category
    Issues created last week
    Latest fixes to 2.18 LTR
    Regressions (QGIS 2)
    Regressions (QGIS 3)
    Regressions grouped by affected version
    Subject contains dpi

but in any case the id=128 works, so we have one less problem.
Thanks Anita.

No, I certainly didn't say it was more important. I think it is important as
evidence not just of size of userbase (indicated by number of installations
of a single version), but also of how trustworthy the userbase finds the
plugin (indicated by the fact that the total of downloads across a long
history of versions is high).

I'm not talking about reward or recognition for devs. I'm talking about
perceived maturity and trustworthiness of software. This is profoundly
important to get traction in corporate/public-sector organizations.
Quantitative evidence is often used/requested for proposals in such arenas
(whether rightly or wrongly). It's easier for me to build a case for QGIS as
a web mapping tool via qgis2web compared to ArcGIS Online if I can point to
approaching 0.25m downloads of the plugin. Yes, it's a questionable figure,
but it has some legitimacy, and definitely some persuasive power.

Yes, I think that's valid. That's why I'm not talking about this figure as
being the *only* indicator of plugin quality - far from it.

No, I don't think we say "popular", nor should we, for all the reasons we
have discussed.

I guess we just need to ask "Is there a problem which needs to be solved?"
before deciding what to do.

Thanks

Thanks for chacking. So it must be related to different privileges from
different users.
Anyone can give a hint here?
Thanks.

problems IMHO are:
* users can get confused by several similar plugins; additional criteria
to decide will help
* developers often partially or totally replicate the work of others,
instead of merging forces; an easy way to check more popular plugins
could give a way to decide to merge instead of starting over.
All the best.

so:
* I (most of us? everybody except Anita?) don't have the query listed
* me and Anita can see the results of the query
* others are not allowed to.
I am proposing to recreate the query and make it available to all logged
users by default.
Who could do that?
Thanks.

I can see that at the right of the dialog, i have three categories
("Reports", "My custom reports" and "Custom reports"- not sure of the
translation). I'm pretty sure that I have created my "reported by me"
query, after the revamp of Redmine, shown in category 2.
Maybe, during the upgrade we lose that query and recreating it for all
issuers will do the trick ; I guess that all queries in the third section
use the same url for all: to check this, here "bug closed" is id=140 and
"regression (qgis3)" is 27. Is that the same for you?

I still need to figure out the signing.  I'll probably do it for v3 release.

One small hitch I'm thinking about is the separate GDAL Complete - I think it would be a bit odd to sign GDAL with a QGIS dev cert, so I am considering making a truly all-in-one QGIS, but I really want GDAL as a separate package because I use it a lot outside QGIS.  There is also the external Python 3 that is not signed, which I may also bundle in the QGIS app, and additional python modules which are not signed.  Though loaded as a library to QGIS, I don't know if that matters.

In the end, even if I make an all-in-one QGIS, I'd still have a separate GDAL installer for those that need it, which wouldn't be signed, along with my Postgres/PostGIS stack (which uses GDAL Complete), also not signed.  So many users would still need to fuss with the macOS security to get that stuff installed and running.

​Shouldn't there be an OSGEO certificate? I remember the discussions but
not the exact resolution.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Saving New Map View(s)
Message-ID: <b7d8536e-41c9-67e3-0299-42c5e73c9060@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I think one of my favorite new feature of QGIS 3 is having the chance to
create new (and independents) map views.

One thing I'm missing is that when I close the new map view created
there is no way to save it (or maybe I don't see it)?

Am I missing something?

Thanks

Matteo

Message-ID: <1fb77f50-7484-7cb5-b190-bfb8e39e5a3c@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Looking at a gpkg problem I created an issue for some time ago:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17899

It appears that QGIS is doing some guessing about the primary key?

Like, IF there is a fid, it is used as PK, but gpkg creation fails when
the original fid is not an integer.

Second: when you (in the QGIS save dialog) empty the 'fid' field (as in
this case, remove fid in the field), creation succeeds, but you end up
with a table in the gpkg with a column with an empty column name ('').

Can others confirm?
Or is this a GDAL issue?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Paolo, while revisiting old issues, should we just test against QGIS 3 (and
update the affected version label) or preferably 2.18 LTR?

No, you're correct. Closing the view deletes it and removes it from
the project. What would you suggest happens here?

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-YxSo=GcRjveCc6WEJApkYn-A_gHj3qMfCeWbE3DuR7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

Anyone else seen this error before trying to build bindings on a 64 bit
build.

c:\osgeo4w64\apps\python36\include\pyconfig.h(403): note: see previous
definition of 'HAVE_DIRECT_H'

C:\Users\Nathan\dev\build\python\core\sip_corepart0.cpp(168592): fatal
error C1001: An internal error has occurred in the compiler.

(compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 1468)

To work around this problem, try simplifying or changing the program near
the locations listed above.

Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++

I don't seem to get it on 32 bit build but always on a 64 bit build.

Thoughts?

- Nathan

I've noticed this too - but had assumed it was just some setting I'd
changed locally. It's fixed by https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6254

BUT

Coincidentally, Mathieu and I have been speaking this week about
approaches to improve the random colors picked for layers. We came up
with a similar approach:

- find a palette of ~100 colors which we think look good for layers,
and remove gross colors from this
- include this palette as an additional pre-installed color palette
within the standard QGIS install
- on startup, pick a random starting color from this list and a random
direction (forward or backward). When adding layers, grab this color
for the layer and then jump to the next/previous color in the preset
palette for the next layer added.
- (for 3.2 : allow users to pick which palette to use for new layer colors)

How's this sound? I'd love to address this for 3.0 - our default
random color selection often picks yuck colors, and I think it'd be
great if 3.0 "magically" produced nicer looking maps for users without
any work required by them!

IMHO this ends up in erasign user data without warning, which is a
serious bug. A warning before closing could suffice.
All the best.

Ideally both. If time is short, I'd say Q3 is a priority, as it also
simplifies the issue of an eventual migration to a new bugtracker.
Thanks Harissou!

agreed, this would be a very good improvement. Of course choice of the
palette will be important for a good user experience. Do you have
something in mind? I see there are a number of things on the net.
As a side note, I rememebr very long ago someone proposed to extract
significantly different colours (I think there is already sw doing this)
from famous paintings and convert them into palettes. Especially
expressionists and renaissance gave beautiful results.
All the best.

Hi Nyall,

Great idea to improve those random colors! This could also be a function 
instead of a palette in my opinion. I even guess it already is, since I 
think qgis stopped using very dark random colors a while ago.

I think those colors should be:
- not too dark (too close to black)
- not too close to grey
- not bright yellow, since this is the selection color

Another thought here, for polygons I find myself changing the standard 
black outline to a darker and opaque version of the fill color. And 
often I prefer using a transparent fill color cause it makes it much 
easier to viewing results on the background map. Could this be the 
default or an option?

Or should I just wait for qgis 3.2 and add create a palette for this? :)

Regards,
Raymond

agreed fully. only transparency may not be suitable as a default, as it
might (?) slow down rendering.
All the best.

Plan sounds great, but I think we should not try to do this for 3.0.
The old 'random' colors are ok for now, there are really too much issues
in current master to fix, which will affect average users.

Yesterday I hit crashes (#18019), freezes (#18032) and failures to save
as gpkg (#17899). It is better for the project (I think) if we clean up
this kind of user experiences first :-)
I know I started this color discussion, but still...

I encourage everybody on this list to start using 2.99/3.0 and try to
confirm or invalidate issues from the issue list. We really need to test
for usability.

Regards & thanks for all the hard work and great ideas people!!

Yes, I agree: only warn the user 'if you close this view, it will not be
saved in your project' or something like that.

The alternative: 'remembering closes/invisible views' in the project
file is doomed to give problems I think. It is like an old bug we had
earlier: removing layers from the layers list still had the providers in
the project file, so you saw your project firing requests to wms's which
you deleted earlier as file ...

Hi, in this experimental QEP [1] QGIS saves all map views to project file. It saves the full window state of the application. But there is an issue with this [2], Qt does not provide a method similar to restoreDockWidget() [3] to restore as better as possible the state of a specific widget (a widget with a map) without change the full window state of the application. Therefore, the loading of a project with non-floating maps may cause that windows previously closed appear, or visible windows disappear.
I hope this helps to decide best solution.

	python API
Message-ID: <CAKT=1=DWLjmWAGYXm5RPz8Q=BG4gf-Z1RbbBszrF44sLE4Wk2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm able to create a new rule based labeling setup from scratch like this
minimal example :

root = QgsRuleBasedLabeling.Rule(QgsPalLayerSettings())
settings = QgsPalLayerSettings()
rule = QgsRuleBasedLabeling.Rule(settings)
root.appendChild(rule)
rules = QgsRuleBasedLabeling(root)
myLayer.setLabeling(rules)

Unfortunately I can't find how to iterate over existing rules, the
labeling()
<http://python.qgis.org/api/core/Vector/QgsVectorLayer.html?#qgis.core.QgsVectorLayer.labeling>
method available for vector layers return an object of
QgsAbstractVectorLayerLabeling
<http://python.qgis.org/api/core/Abstract/QgsAbstractVectorLayerLabeling.html>
class but it seems there is no way to get the root rule (
QgsRuleBasedLabeling
<http://python.qgis.org/api/core/Rule/QgsRuleBasedLabeling.html>) from this
class. The only possibility I found is to get directly pal settings using
providers ids but I can't access to rules tree. Anyone have a clue ?

Thanks in advance for any help

Hi Nyall,

just thinking aloud.. could be possible to have a list of saved map
views like the presets?

always thinking aloud.. what about having a kind of menu (like those for
presets) where all the map views ca be stored?

Thanks for the feedback

Solved by Salvatore!

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/pull/612

The culprit was a QWebInspector not being deleted when its parent
QWebView/QWebPage was destroyed.

Thanks so much! As you can tell, I'd got nowhere trying to solve this.
Hopefully no blockers left for qgis2web3 now.

Does it not return a QgsRuleBasedLabeling. If so, that has .rootRule().

There are debug versions of the libraries with pdbs.  But the nightlies are
built against the release libs.

Thanks, Juergen. If anyone could point to some instructions for how to drop
in debug versions, that could be really useful in the future (if it's even
possible post-build).

Hi all,

I followed silently all the thread.

I know all the difficulties and efforts to maintain different providers
in QGIS, even "just" GRASS and SAGA.

Having a so big number of 3 part algs not QGIS natives is, IMHO, one of
the strength of QGIS. Many users tells that they can run all this
algorithms by only learn a single GUI.

I think removing them from core (even if I PERFECTLY understand devs
options) could have a negative impact for all the users outside.

What also about all the beautiful tests (GRASS still there I think and
SAGA temporary turned off because something of Travis)?

Could it be a chance to leave them within QGIS by extending the number
of tests?

Also all the translation works done until know could be lost?


As I said, just my 2cents

and of course, thanks for all the super work and effort put into this issue.

Cheers

Matteo

I guess they'll start complaining once the find that GRASS and SAGA have been
removed from the windows standalone.  Before hardly anyone will notice - just
like nobody noticed that there were more hidden providers, because their
dependencies were not installed and in turn nobody missed them, when they were
removed again.

The question is who is the driving force behind the provider plugins.  If we
want those algorithms in QGIS, we will probably have to maintain the plugins,
if we don't want them to die.

Otherwise if we don't care and just want to enable others to have QGIS
intgration, they'll have to adopt the plugins.  That might work better if there
is real interest.  But I think they usally prefer their tools to be used in
their own environment and don't care that much about whether it works in QGIS
or not.  Is there solid interest of the SAGA or GRASS team to adopt the
providers?  Otherwise I guess they'll sooner or later will die.

At the very least the packaging in OSGeo4W will have to adapted.  The easiest
way would just to remove the dependencies.  This should also kill the current
problem with the 2GB NSIS limit (GRASS depends on python2, SAGA has wxWidgets,
OTB Qt4).

The plugins would be downloaded from within QGIS and instruct the user how
install the rest of the binaries (eg. from OSGeo4W or other sites (like OTB)).

There could also be processing provider plugin packages in OSGeo4W that have
the providers and depend on available binaries there.  Although those packages
would need to be available for all or a selection of qgis packages (qgis,
qgis-rel-dev, qgis-ltr, qgis-ltr-dev and qgis-dev).

You would need to do a debug build of QGIS, that should pickup the debug
version of the qt libraries, but that also require debug versions of other
dependencies ship or build (on windows debug libraries use a different heap
management and are incompatible to their release builds).

So it's far from "drop in"...

The difference is - fixing the default color assignment is a FUN
project, and something I'm motivated to tackle before release.

On the contrast... if I have to look at any more Python binding
issues/memory leaks/object conversion code, I'm likely to end up in a
catatonic state and be no use to anyone!

So for me at least the choice isn't between fixing the random colors
vs fixing a crash - it's fixing the random colors vs not fixing them.

Sounds reasonable. Can you file a regression covering this and assign to me?

Also for reference:
- #18019 is fixed now
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/be6674b8196f1c59e619b4bbe5f9394f163a62c8)
- #18032 is not reproducable, but Denis is working on a fix anyway
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6256)
- #17899 is... maybe a QGIS issue, maybe an upstream (GDAL) issue. Can
I request you discuss this on the gdal list and see if it's something
we need to fix or not?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Please help with the visual changelog for 3.0
References: <1DA5B9A9-2421-4EB8-9374-79EB1713D245@qgis.org>
Message-ID: <DEC551CB-2476-4F17-9226-04FAA2942BAC@qgis.org>

Hi QGIS developers and enthusiasts

QGIS 3.0 is planned for release in 19 days (barring release blockers) and we have so many new features in this release. I would really appreciate it if you could take a minute or two to take a couple of your favourite new features from the 2.99 nightly build and submit a changelog  entry for them here:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.0.0/ <http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.0.0/>

Try to include an image or short animated GIF that highlights the feature. For more complex features, you can also reference a YouTube movie of a screencast or walkthrough of the new feature if needed.

If you are a country user group representative, perhaps you could be so kind as to ask members in your user group to volunteer in writing about new features at the above page too. 

In the process of testing new features, you may uncover bugs - please be so kind as to first search for an existing issue relating to the bug and update it, or file a new issue if needed. You can do that here:

http://hub.qgis.org <http://hub.qgis.org/>

QGIS 3.0 is going to rock, lets tell the world about all the new cool stuff it includes!

Please contact me if you have any queries about the changelog creation process!

Regards

Tim

Yes I believe one was purchased - perhaps William and Larry can collaborate on this since I think Larry has the OSGEO cert.

Well, OTB provider plugin will be able to fetch and install otb binaries.
So users installing plugin is the extra step needed.
1. Install QGIS
2. install otb provider plugin
3. select/download && install otb package

If my proposal to keep otb provider in qgis was allowed, then it will be
two simple steps. But I don't see that happening soon.

Anyways, if the provider is a plugin or not, it is important to have api to
show/hide widgets from algorithm dialog.( see my other mail on parameter
groups)

Thank you very much Martin for this quick fix, tested this morning and it
works as expected now.

I have another question : after settings some labeling rules with pyqgis,
the labels are not displaying but if I just enter the rule settings through
the gui and directly exit it without changing anything then the labels are
displayed correctly. Is there any register action needed for each rule that
I forgot in my code ?

I can use SL data from browser, db manager, etc..

Should I open a ticket?

It is hard to say without seeing a code snippet that I could run
myself. Does it help if you force map refresh (e.g. by moving the map
a bit or zooming in/out)? It is also worth playing with "simple"
labeling in pyqgis first as that might help you understand whether it
is just a problem of rule-based labeling or it applies to simple
labeling as well.

ok I found the solution, it was because I use an expression for labeling
and I had forgotten to set QgsPalLayerSettings().isExpression to True.

Thanks again for your time.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] tricontour crashing in QGIS3
Message-ID: <A87E66F06E86F14B857F2EB047CDF9322B256BB8@prdassexch01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

I'm looking for help debugging or fixing a problem in matplotlib tricontour.  I am using this in a QGIS plugin (www.qgis.org).  The call to tricontour causes QGIS to crash.   Running python3 on ubuntu 16.04 (matplotlib 1.5.1) and 17.10 (matplotlib 2.0.0).

Running in the debugger gives the following result

Thread 1 "qgis.bin" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007fff4f7ca098 in qh_initstatistics ()

#8  0x00007fff5d99bad8 in ?? ()
   from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.5m.so.1.0
....

The python code is

                np.save('/home/chris/temp/data.x',x)
                np.save('/home/chris/temp/data.y',y)
                np.save('/home/chris/temp/data.z',z)
                np.save('/home/chris/temp/data.l',levels)
                print("Extend",repr(extend))
                cs = plt.tricontour(x, y, z, levels, extend=extend)

I've called matplotlib from a simple python script using the saved data (np.save) in a simply python script and it runs without problem, so the problem appears to arise running within the QGIS3 python environment.

Can you suggest any reason why it might be different running from within QGIS and how I can work around/fix this!

Thanks
Chris Crook

Cab you paste a backtrace? I know you described it in the other thread, but I
think the trace itself could help others to investigate.

This sounds great - and all the more reason why (in my opinion)
publishing the provider as a separate plugin is appropriate. A lot of
users will only have to make a couple of clicks and have a fully
functional OTB install and processing provider ready to go.

On the other hand, I don't think this approach is suitable at all for
a core provider. What would you propose to do for Linux users? OTB may
or may not be available in their distro's repos (e.g. it's not
available for Fedora), so how would the plugin install the dependency
in this case? Or what about for Windows users who do not have
administrative rights to install software?

I personally don't think there's any way to guarantee that OTB (or
SAGA for that matter) is available for all QGIS installs, even if we
can manually trigger a download and install via a plugin. And if they
aren't, then we make things harder for our users, QGIS trainers and
support providers -- the feature set of a standard QGIS install will
vary greatly depending on the platform it's installed upon and user's
privileges on that platform.

Totally agree

Me too. However - I don't think this should be default behavior. The
reason is that if we make the initial outline color a non-desaturated
color (say dark blue if a polygon layer is assigned a blue fill
color), then this outline color is kept whenever a
categorized/graduated style is applied to the layer. So you'd end up
with classes with different colors (say red/green/yellow) having a
dark blue outline color. This is going to be ugly, yet a lot of users
may not notice AND even if they do it's non-trivial to change this for
new QGIS users.

So I'd rather stick with the safer option and keep the
"make-the-outline-a-darker-version-of-the-fill" as an advanced users
tweak.

them?

Thanks Benhamin.   - I'll certainly look in to that.  The installations are all using apt on ubuntu.  Using standard repositories apart from the QGIS nightly build.  I'm not sure if QGIS uses qhull directly or indirectly - I'll investigate that.

Looks like a conflict for the qhull library, which matplotlib vendors and builds as a part of its packaging. How did qgis and matplotlib get installed? Perhaps they were built with conflicting flags, perhaps? Just a few ideas off of the top of my head.

                print("Extend",repr(extend))
                cs = plt.tricontour(x, y, z, levels, extend=extend)

I've called matplotlib from a simple python script using the saved data (np.save) in a simply python script and it runs without problem, so the problem appears to arise running within the QGIS3 python environment.

Can you suggest any reason why it might be different running from within QGIS and how I can work around/fix this!

Thanks
Chris Crook

Starting from b6c2de48 scrips are just usuall Processing algorithms:
normal or feature-based.
Testing and feedback are welcome.

did you checked this package?
https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org//packages/OTB-6.4.0-Linux64.run
and others?
https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org//packages/

We don't need admin rights to install otb. just unzip and it works. Same
for mac and linux.
The dependency is libc and libc++ runtime. And I think any centos6 is our
reference platforms.

Issues you asked is why we introduced binary packages for OTB.

Hi all,
sorry, I miss a point here: we have a dev who volunteers to maintain a
piece of code. He is quite credible. His proposal minimize the overhead
to QGIS code, and moves much of the complexity to an external sw.
Why do we suggest to keep him out of the door?
All the best.

Come on!. Users already reports issue to OTB if that is the problem.
Do you know any bugs fixed in OTB processing by QGIS team?
To be fair, the processing plugin is in qgis.  And no matter how you
explain some users doesn't listen.
Are you saying this as a problem or something plugin would solve?

IMHO anything that does not work out of the box will be just
unaccessible for a large part of users. Standalone packages have been a
key of success for QGIS.
All the best.

I believe this would be useful for other backends too - what is your

Hi Tom

The previous mail did have the backtrace as far as the python interpreter ... while I could post the rest of it that will be more layers of python and the standard QGIS plugin invocation.  My feeling is that won't add to understanding the issue .. but can post if it seems useful to you

Thanks
Chris

Cab you paste a backtrace? I know you described it in the other thread, but I
think the trace itself could help others to investigate.

Hi guys,
having default colors is really nice, great to see some work there. But
aren't we in a feature freeze period.?

I plead for the great "release often" mantra that we tend to forget these
times. 4 months between two releases is fairly short most users can live
without perfect random colors.
3.0 is not the holy grail, we'll have plenty of time for new fun features
in the future.

To be more crude, I see no fun in building a gigantic pile of untested new
features. Please also listen the complaints of the documentation team, but
also of the silent clients who try to build there IT plans on QGIS.

Sorry for that,  I like when it's fun, but this time, I really don't get
what makes it critical to do this now, and not within a months in 3.1
branch.

Regards
Régis

quickly screened the GRASS MLs, I can't find any entry that the GRASS
community was ever asked if there could be e.g. a shared attempt for an
automatization to create/maintain the plugin code.

Looking at the new OSGeo website:

*Desktop Applications*

-QGIS Desktop
-GRASS GIS

*Geospatial Libraries*

-Orfeo ToolBox
-GDAL/OGR

*Meta CRS Initiative*

-PROJ4

Most of the software mentioned in this thread are projects under the common
umbrella of OSGeo.

An option may be to ask that OSGeo plays a more proactive role in helping to
coordinate and supporting (technically/financally/...) such inter-project
challenges.

I will forward a short summary of this thread to the GRASS community.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing Help system
Message-ID: <d4456396-a4f9-e383-4e3f-dbe143a04ef8@gmail.com>

Hi all,

even if not strictly related to the dev list, I'd like to point out my
thoughts here.

Last week I made a call for doc reviewer for the Processing Help System
docs written till now (thanks to the grant proposal program).

Pretty most all of the native QGIS algorithm have been described and
lots of improvements have been made (pictures, better descriptions,
updated descriptions, etc.).

At the moment just a small part of the descriptions is available because
a lot of docs are waiting for a review:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Processing+help%22

I think these descriptions have to be reviewed before the release.

Also there are also some problems with some link (e.g. when the
algorithm provider is labeled as *native* and not as *qgis*) and there
is already a ticket opened [0].

Finally: for some other algorithms (e.g. those of SAGA) there is no
description. Clicking on the help button shows a **Not Found** page.
What about having a kind of template "this algorithm is not described,
if you want to help........."

Thanks for any thought

Cheers

Matteo

merge all; if some descriptions have to be improved or corrected, even
avter release; the earlier the merge, the better. having a much improved
help system and not showing it to users does not make sense.
if someone has serious objections please speak out, otherwise I'd just go.

if this is not too difficult, I suggest fixing it (Alaex, could you?).

redirect all ``docs/user_manual/processing_algs/saga/*`` links to a page
with something like "Help missing - please help us improving this by
sending us your description of this alg" with either a link to a GH page
to be edited or a mailto (is there someone willing to take this review?
Matteo, would yo be available?

If necessart, we could use some additionsl funds from QGIS to finish up
and polish this important work.

All the best.

Hello all,

Here is a PR to allow integration of otb smoothly. tests are all passing,
commits are squashed and ready to review.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6272
I did a small fix to control visibility of parameter from provider.
Addition of specific parameter class for OTB is not included in this PR.

Thanks for feedback

+1 for the general idea, pending a code review.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] how to warn user when when reading project XML
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+ahcntxf+pK7fWq6Wo9ei+=KY_5_LtgGWywsDBJk0MHaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am wondering what's the best way to warn the user when reading XML is not
going as expected i.e. when an error is encountered.

Here is the path to the method I want to warn from:

QgsProject::read
QgsProject::readProjectFile
QgsProject::_getMapLayers
QgsProject::addLayer
QgsMapLayer::readLayerXML
QgsVectorLayer::readXML
QgsVectorLayer::readSymbology
QgsEditFormConfig::readXML

I see only two solutions:

1. Using success return value and some errorMessage.
 This is partly done in readSymbology but totally incomplete (always
returns true and errorMessage are not used at all...)
It would require a finer grain than bool as return value (info / warning /
error, probably).
It would probably be a a list of error messages.

2. Emitting signals.
But that means bring the connections all the way up to the project by
connecting and disconnecting the map layers and all other objects during
the way down. Moreover, many config object are not QObjects.

To me solution 1. sounds nicer but is an API break.
The small feature I am working on is targeted to 3.2 si I would need to set
this in place prior to release.

Is there somehting I am missing?

Cheers,
Denis

For those following at home, Denis and I had a quick brainstorm and
settled on the idea of instead extending QgsReadWriteContext to add
error collection/reporting there.

Awesome, just wanted to suggest to use that class :-)

Message-ID: <975DB331-70CD-499F-BC41-5B8454E89D8A@3liz.com>


Hi All

Using processing from python using latest master branch  (from commit 325af48680)  have noticed that native (C++) algorithms  are not loaded anymore !

The native provider does not appears in the list of provider
Native algorithms are not usable anymore  (ex 'qgis:joinattributestable')

All others python algorithms are loaded from a Processing.initialize() call.

Is there anything to do to enable native processing algorithms from python ?

Otherwise this would be a regression from 0a17c370f7.


Thx,

David

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issues with custom forms with Python (in both QGIS
	2 and QGIS 3)
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7xpupY5B4SrWOAZEa20Gzpw4XjVOWZ0XPqG0eNr7z+P3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am writing documentation about custom forms, but I am encountering some
problems.

In the case of QGIS 2, it seems that there is no way of avoiding the dialog
to be closed when the OK button is clicked. I read this blog post
<https://nathanw.net/2011/09/05/qgis-tips-custom-feature-forms-with-python-logic/>by
Nathan, in which it disconnects the default 'accepted' signal from the
'dialog.accept' slot. I tried that, but it doesnt seem to be working. It
runs the validation function that I connect to that signal, but even if I
dont accept the dialog in that function, it closes it.

I also tried using the disconnectButtonBox() method of the QgsAttributeForm
class, but it does nothing. The buttons still do their work.

Is this a bug, or I am doing something wrong?

In QGIS3, it seems that now only the ui file can be provided, but not a
python file with the form logic. How is that added now?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <63237942-f48c-c1a5-14eb-0ba55dbcf6fe@oslandia.com>

Hi,

I have a project with lots of composer templates that have been designed
before the new "layout" refactoring.
Loading these old templates in a more recent version fails silently.
Is there a way to convert from the old format to the new one ?

Thanks.

Hi Hugo,

if the old composition was embedded in a project the conversion should
happen automatically and you should see the old compositions in the layouts
menu.

There is a class to convert the 2.x composition to the new layouts:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/layout/qgscompositionconverter.h

You can find some usage examples in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/core/testqgscompositionconverter.cpp

Cheers

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Nominations for the QGIS Board and a short
 announcement from your Board Chair
Message-ID: <9D548104-54D5-44B3-8EFB-584E65DA29BE@qgis.org>

Hi All

It is nomination time again for the QGIS board! According to our charter [1] our Project Steering Committee and Board members shall serve for periods of two years at a time and then shall be eligible for re-election. In addition, new members for the Board and PSC can be nominated at these times. After the nominations, a vote will follow to decide how the PSC and Board will be made up for the next two years. If you are a QGIS Voting member (i.e. your name appears either here [2] as Community Voting Member or here [3] as Country User Group Voting Member), please take the time to make nominations. You should have already received an email invitation to the nominations form. If you have not, please contact me and I will resend it to you.

On a personal note I would like to share that I will be standing down from the Board and PSC at the end of my tenure as chair. I will continue to participate in the QGIS community as a GIS Nerd :-) I am extremely honoured to have been able to serve as your first Board Chair. QGIS as a project has grown so much and we have many good processes in place to ensure that the project keeps growing and reaching more and more users with our special brand of Open Source GIS goodness. Standing down is not a decision I took lightly and being part of such an awesome community of developers, users, documenters, GIS Nerds has been a really awesome experience. From the humble beginnings of Gary Sherman starting QGIS 16 years ago and his subsequent generosity in opening up the source code to the world, QGIS is now being used in every corner of the world and in every sector of society. It has been great to be a part of seeing that happen, and I look forward to continuing the journey with you all under the new project Chair.

Thank you all for the wonderful support you have shown me while I have served as Chair, now go out and use your votes to elect the next Chair who can lead QGIS on to bigger and better things!

My very best regards


Tim Sutton

Thank you Helmut. Following our PSC meeting, I'll start an open
discussion with all parties involved. Looking forward for your input.
I assumed GRASS-dev was the list to contact, but you sent it on
GRASS-users, any special reason for this?
All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] External providers in QGIS
Message-ID: <9335d5a0-ab24-90d6-d608-039c90e98d6d@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
following the discussion on qgis-dev ML:
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2018-January/051701.html
it has been proposed to remove all external providers (namely OTB,
already removed, GRASS, and SAGA) from Processing in QGIS2 (GDAL will
remain as QGIS cannot be built without). This raised a number of
concerns, so PSC decided not to rush removing them from the upcoming 3.0
release, and to open a wider discussions about this, involving all the
interested parties, to find an optimal solution.
If volunteers outside QGIS core team, ideally from the respective
backends, could take the maintenance of these providers, not much would
change for the end user. If not, this will mean effectively missing
hundreds of algs from QGIS.
I personally propose to reinstate the OTB plugin with Rashad (from OTB)
as maintainer.
QGIS.ORG will seek to support any decision made with funding where possible.
Looking forward for your feedback.
All the best.

I sent it to GRASS users as it seems to me to be more a community issue than
a dev issue.

Thinking about/hearing to your user base helps you to improve decisions on
the dev side.

see 

https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/GSoC/2018#ImproveGRASSintegrationinQGIS3

as a starting point to a possible closer OSGeo inter-project communication
and collaboration.

Being an OSGeo GSoC/GCI admin now for some time, such opportunities or
similar to improve inter-project collaboration seem to be really under-used
at the moment. 

I'll start a new thread about the GSoC idea to attract new interested
people.

As a follow-up of the long discussion how to proceed with alg providers in
QGIS, have a look at:

https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/GSoC/2018#ImproveGRASSintegrationinQGIS3

It should be seen as an starting point to collect ideas, and to sharpen the
technical interface and requirements for such an Integration of external alg

And it should be also understood as a starting contribution of the GRASS
community for a deeper proactively inter-project communication and
collaboration.

Feel free to to improve and extend the ideas proposal.

I dont see the advantage in having providers in core. And if there is an
advantage, it's clearly not in how easy it is going to be to maintain the
plugin. If the people responsible of a given backend (like OTB) are going
to maintain it (which makes sense), why putting it in core where they don't
have write access? Better in a separate repo. Also, they can release
whenever there are changes, without having to wait for a new release. That
way, the plugin will always be in sync with new releases of the backend app.

If we put them in core...why putting only this big ones (which in some
cases require installing external apps manually by the user), and not put
other plugins that exist and contain Processing providers?

I thought the idea was to not have core plugins and avoid them if possible.
I don't see why we have to treat plugins that have Processing provider in a
different way. Specially considering how easy it is to install a plugin in
QGIS.

Hello victor,

Do you see a possibility of a generic processing provider?. One that can
read descriptor files and run algorithms!.
I see processing as a single plugin (included in QGIS or not). And if it
can avoid need to have sub-plugin managed by all those other development
team. That's even better!.
Whichever toolbox want to be integrated into processing plugin can provide
and maintain descriptor files individually. No QGIS developers need to be
involved.
This way, external toolboxes' team or qgis does not need to maintain/fix
qgis-<TOOLBOX>-provider-plugin.

search -> download -> install plugin will be changed to configure providers
install location.
If needed QGIS can control list of available providers (just names).

External tools' dev team needs to know something such as spec of descriptor
files, how to mention name of executable etc.
They don't need to know stuff like how qgis run a processing algorithm, and
things working of modeler, running with other algorithms.

Anyway, this is just an idea and don't know what will be technically
challenging issues?

The other way of putting processing plugin into core and providers
classified as external plugins can avoid maintenance on qgis.
But this "strategy" can result in dead code and users complaining on both
projects. Because, at some developers cannot manage project release + a
plugin for qgis, another plugin for matlab or whatever
Putting all stuff in qgis tree and taking no responsibility of providers
isn't good either.

This way, each team takes part and result in better collaboration and
contribution.
As time goes, generic descriptor provider gets better and stronger.
Toolboxes are free to add, remove, modify their applications and users from
both community benefit best of both worlds.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Rule based renderer question
Message-ID: <26831f40-3c47-8898-8be8-931926368823@gmail.com>

Hi all,

simple question for the refining the rule-based renderer.

Suppose you have an admin layer (all word countries) and you categorized
it depending on the continent belonging (e.g. 5 categories - 5 colors).

Switch to the rule-based rendered and refine the rule (only for the
continent e.g. Africa) by adding sub-categories to style each African
country with other random colors.

When choosing the category column in the sub-rendered, it filters for
**all** world countries and not for just the African ones.

The same happens when adding an interval for the rule (so min and max
values are calculated considering the values of the whole layer).

I don't know if this behavior is intended, but I was expecting to have
listed just the sub-categories of the main one.

But maybe I'm missing something, so I'm just asking :)

Thanks for any feedback

Cheers

Matteo

I dont think that it is possible to make it more generic. It's not only
descriptors with only outputs and inputs. Each backend app has its own
logic. GRASS needs outputs to be converted to its own format. SAGA accepts
only SHP for vector layers and generates its own SDAT format for raster
outputs. Parameters are also not passed in the same way to all apps. SAGA
has extent parameters splitted in 4 params with bbox coordinates. Each
provider has a different way of indicating a boolean value in the console
call. In short, the logic must be there somehow, specific for the provider,

What is the difference between maintaining a set of descriptor files (as
you propose) and a set of descriptor files + a class extending
GeoAlgorithmProvider with the logic (as it happens now)?. I think it is
easier to have a solid provider class for OTB and then do not ever change
it (assuming OTB syntax will never change), than having a generic provider,
which looks rather unfeasible.

As you say, there is the risk for dead code. In that case, i think it is
much better to have the provider outside of QGIS core, as a plugin. There
are dozens of dead plugins, and that is not nice, but it's kinda
acceptable. Having dead code in QGIS it's a much bigger issue, and we must
avoid that.

Cheers

This is possible in the ideal world of ponies and rainbows. In real
world we need
to deal with different types of the inputs, with different
representation of the same
thing in the different programs, different logics.

can you confirm that a GRASS input/output parameter can solve their issue?.
Still there is SAGA and other stuff. So generic provider is not something
QGIS team can do. But I would like to know about this on GRASS issue.

Without such a change there is no long-term existence even as plugin. Or
worse, it exists and will be broken.
QGIS must recognize such a behavior and avoid adding  burden on external
toolboxes' developer teams by asking for splitting applications. Be it OTB,
GRASS, SAGA whatever.

While I was at it, I saw there is less stuff to be managed and can be done
using a customwidgetwrapper for OTB. because a custom widget wrapper works
in a special way only for one provider.
Hence the idea of generic provider came up!.  In  case of GRASS its
input/output parameter, for OTB it is selection list parameter.

Thanks for your valuable feedback on this. I am sure an idea of generic
provider came up sometime during your work on processing plugin.
It tough and need more expert work and safe is to avoid it totally. I agree
on that part.

Thanks! Looks like i was using an older version, not up to date, and the

good to see that some one else is using this as well :-)

I'd be in favour of adding anything important for users.

Thanks for your thoughts.

When in Madeira we can have a discussion about this. It would be good if
all interested parties could meet, locally and remotely.

All the best.

I'm much more in favour for out of core providers, for the same reasons
reported by Victor. Having only GDAL and QGIS algorithms in core will
reduce the number of available algorithms out of the box, but:

- from my experience - comprising years of feedbacks from the courses I
teach - the most frequently used algs are available within the GDAL and
QGIS algs list

- a few generic and widely used algs are from GRASS and SAGA. We would miss
them - out of the box - but it could also be an opportunity to port them.
For examples v.to.points, transects, profiles.
Anyway we would have the plugins for GRASS and SAGA, in case...

- specific algs are for specialized users. Here I think plugins are best
suited (OTB, R, TauDEM, etc.). Tomorrow a new sw could be added to the
list, consistently with the others approach.

I appreciate a lot the work from Richard, I hope this discussion is not
understood as to belittle its effort!

my 2 cents...

I am converting a python  plugin the implements a subclass of QgsFeatureRenderer.  At the moment the plugin is dying on the startRender function with the message (from the base class)

"ASSERT failure in QgsFeatureRenderer::renderFeature: \"renderFeature called in a different thread - use a cloned renderer instead\"

I can't see where I should be creating the cloned renderer for the rendering.  I had a look at the QgsSingleSymbolRenderer C++ code and I can't see anything there, so I'm wondering if the python implementation in some way corrupts the multiprocessing implementation.

Tim -

It's with much sadness that I read this, but I can also totally
understand your decision in doing so. Under your leadership the QGIS
project has grown and gone from strength to strength, and I believe
that a HUGE part of this is directly due to your guidance of the
project. You've been everything we could possibly dream of in a chair.

I'd also like to say that I've found your welcoming attitude a great
inspiration. Just watching you at hackfests I've seen endless

Hello,

Sorry about that.

Here is the non-encoded version.

Marc

Hello,

With QgsComposition, it was possible to pass a "substitution map" to the
method loadFromTemplate : the substitution map was a map/associative
array such that when loading the template, strings like "[key]" were
replaced by the value associated to the key ( see
https://qgis.org/api/2.18/qgscomposition_8cpp_source.html#l01107 ).

With QgsLayout, I have the impression that this feature has disappear.
Do you know if it exists an alternative way to obtain an equivalent result ?

Thanks a lot.

Marc

Eish I hope we didn't lose it too ... we use this heavily….though I guess you could do similar things with variables and expressions now…

Yes - I removed that argument as it was unused in the code and looked
like a legacy leftover. My thoughts are that these substitutions would
be better performed now by placing expressions and through use of
expression variables directly inside the layout elements themselves -
e.g. instead of using the substitution to replace a label's text, put
an expression directly inside the label text and use the built in
expression functions or variables to evaluate to the desired text.

Alternatively, given that the argument was API only and not exposed to
users anywhere, it could also be done directly using built in python
replace methods prior to calling loadFromTemplate.

Continued: Ok, understand a bit more now.  Still not sure where the clone should be created but if the same renderer is called from more than one thread, as the first time startRender is called it sets the thread id for the rendererer, and thereafter cannot be called with a different thread id.  So issue could either be if startRender does not invoke super.startRender (to set thread id) or if called from two threads.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS3: Python QgsFeatureRenderer subclass problem

I am converting a python  plugin the implements a subclass of QgsFeatureRenderer.  At the moment the plugin is dying on the startRender function with the message (from the base class)

"ASSERT failure in QgsFeatureRenderer::renderFeature: \"renderFeature called in a different thread - use a cloned renderer instead\"

I can't see where I should be creating the cloned renderer for the rendering.  I had a look at the QgsSingleSymbolRenderer C++ code and I can't see anything there, so I'm wondering if the python implementation in some way corrupts the multiprocessing implementation.  Can anyone offer any suggestions

Hi devs,

I want to share a super brief summary of the brainstorming we had on
this topic. I think it is better to speak about it in Madeira with all
the interested people.

There are some small issues with the Help system and Processing (sphinx
related): that is, URLs build from the Help system are (sometimes)
different from those generated from Sphinx.

Differences are:

* Help system build URL with providerId/groupId/algorithmName.html
* provider "native" is not present in sphinx
* Help system concatenates words (eventually) while sphinx puts `-`
between words

At the end, for some algorithm, we have documentation already merged,
but unreachable from the UI of Processing, e.g.:

1. Help system URL:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/native/vectoroverlay.html#lineintersections

2. doc URL:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vector_overlay_tools.html#line-intersections

I hope interested people can jump in this discussion on share some thoughts!

Cheers

Matteo

Hi all,
I disagree heartily: without GRASS and SAGA QGIS is currently unsuitable
for serious, comprehensive GIS analysis work. Full stop.
Missing one specific alg, even if not used daily, means having to switch
to other software.
We have already removed R provider: even if used by a tiny minority, and
certainly not perfect, the previous situation was better than the
current one, without the option of using R from QGIS.
I think we have to be extra cautious on this ground.
All the best.

Do you have these toolboxes installed during training? OTB, SAGA, GRASS
etc..
OTB is focused on remote sensing. Unless you have a training or course that
area, your statistics on them being not needed is pretty unreliable. Don't
you think?
What QGIS uses to run a classification/segmentation algorithm without OTB
and GRASS GIS.

Hi,

Regarding the negative effect of algorithms getting lost I fully agree with you Paolo.

However, it might simplify the discussion if we try separate user experience and development (and packaging) solutions as well as means and ends...

Aim should be to have the different back-ends available for user in a way that is as straight forward as possible. From my point of view that includes that possibly available providers are not hidden from users who just install bare QGIS. If they want to activate them, but don`t have the backends installed (and possibly a plugin) then they should get a notice that they have to install them (and I don`t see a problem with installing provider + plugin compared to just provider).

And if that sort of user experience is guaranteed I - as a user - would not care about where the code is maintained (in QGIS core, in the provider core, or in a separate plugin). My impression is that Victors arguments for an out-of-core solution are very valid, esp. given effects of the independent release cycles of the backends and QGIS on packaging needs (at least for the GRASS plugin).
The only difference I see is that additional packages would be needed for a plugin solution. But that is probably not too bad or even an advantage...

Finally, if there is interest in keeping the processing integration alive (and it obviously is) having it in an independent repo should not be a show stopper. Only negative effect I can see is that this produces additional repos, where access rights have to be managed. But that should not be a major issue either...

Cheers
Stefan

Hi all,
I disagree heartily: without GRASS and SAGA QGIS is currently unsuitable for serious, comprehensive GIS analysis work. Full stop.
Missing one specific alg, even if not used daily, means having to switch to other software.
We have already removed R provider: even if used by a tiny minority, and certainly not perfect, the previous situation was better than the current one, without the option of using R from QGIS.
I think we have to be extra cautious on this ground.
All the best.

That would still need users *waiting* for QGIS release for fix in algo is
what I understood from other parts of discussion.
I don't know what these developers are going to do with a bugfix after a
new release. That's some kind of mystery unsolved to me.
I hope there will be zero bugs after releases.

What I ment is that, from my perspective, we shouldn't seek to make QGIS a
do-it-all software by default, because the GIS/EO/RS/Data Analysis fields
are so wide that, from that point of view, everything could go into QGIS
and it would be an overwhelmin experience for users.
Any generic sw I know offers extensions, plugins, for specialized use
cases.  From my experience a user prefers few tools that match their needs,
instead of digging into a long list of (mostly) obscure algs...

Anyway, I don't want to stress on this...

OTB's proposed solution was that plugin or provider algorithm if activated
can find otb installation. If not found, there is code which will download
and install otb packages and configure it for users.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] [server] Status and Roadmap
Message-ID: <CABgOYCcUXY7sqFA9kSJHA90eSj1kXrHu10BBmEu9wOFi1AE6Vw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

As you know, QGIS server has been fully refactored for QGIS 3.

Now some big enterprises are starting to rely on it in production
environment and would like to consolidate again QGIS server.

I have some informations and questions :


# OGC certification

I got in touch with the OGC certification team, in the aim of getting
official certification, since we pass all WMS 1.3.0 tests.
If we seek a reference implementation status on behalf of OSGEO and
QGIS.org, there should be no fees, that's great news.
The process must be renewed every year.
We started the online testing process here:
http://cite.opengeospatial.org/teamengine. It's failing currently, probably
because of IP redirections we need to fix in our reference server (the one
used by the continuous integration system)

We are asked to start evaluating WFS conformity too, but that should be a
bit painful since there is no API in TeamEngine to make continuous
integration, and online platform is not responding. So I'm not confident
we'll have quick results here.

If everything goes well, I think QGIS can be certified soon! I think this
will be very interesting to advertise in the doc and website.

The OGC team seems really happy to see QGIS getting in the certification
loop, and suggest we also try to certify QGIS as a client. If anyone has
worked in that area, that would be nice to join efforts.


# Performance

 * We are still interested in having performance measure reference and
ideally have performance driven development with a continuous integration
system. Yves, is there anything new on your side?

 * One blocker for WFS was the performance of spatial filter, in 2.x, they
were not forwarded to the database when possible, and implied reading the
whole layer in memory before doing the spatial query on the QGIS side.
Anyone knows if it's still the case?



all the best
Régis

I still don't see why this cannot be done if OTB provider is a separate
plugin. Users can install a plugin with the provider, and then that
provider can have the logic to automatically download OTB, install it, or
do whatever is needed in case OTB is not found already installed.

I think is is good to educate our users a little bit. We are talking about
people that will be using complex algorithms for performing advanced
analysis. I guess we can expect that they can install a plugin themselves
and it is not a traumatic experience for them... Looks like installing a
separate plugin it's some sort of cruel chinese torture...when it takes
just 3 mouse clicks.

I agree with Giovanni, there is no need to provide something that has
everything installed out-of the box. Also, take into account that reading
the files that contain the algorithm descriptions takes time (plus, there
might be some additional checks performed when populating the toolbox).
People not doing analysis should not have to suffer that extra loading
time...

About the R plugin not being available now...well, it's in a separate repo
and can be adapted to QGIS 3, packaged and published. No one has taken care
of that, it's true, but that only means we have no R support. If the R
provider was be in core, it would mean that we would have a dead or
malfunctioning provider being shipped with QGIS. That is a much worse
option. And I dont see why, if someone is willing to fix that R provider,
having it in core will make it easier.

Cheers!

If there is no easy proper fix for this, URL rewriting could handle it - I
don't know what server software is being used, but it should be possible.

Can I pull some attention to:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17947

On windows it is not possible (both 2.18 and master) to pull a geojson
via https into QGIS.

Given REST interfaces becoming more and more popular I think this is an
important issue.

But I'm not sure if it is a OGR problem (given ogrinfo <httpsurl> also
fails), or it is a local windows certificate problem.
There is no problem on Linux here with me.

Tried to start a fresh config too.

Can windows people confirm if
https://duif.net/Testing_QGIS1.geojson
fails? While
http://duif.net/Testing_QGIS1.geojson
is ok?

Regards,

Richard

Thank you so very much !!!

QgsProject.instance().writeEntry('Digitizing', '/SnappingMode', 'advanced')
QgsProject.instance().snapSettingsChanged.emit()

This did the trick for me. I'm so surprised the answer wasn't easy to
find...

QGIS increases no of algorithms for a provider. It is simple as that. OTB
has less than 80 applications and coming to QGIS, it will be 100 or 150.
(no interest to count them in qgis)
 And OTB was reading descriptor from xml which is going to be now csv like
others.
Given all that info, I won't be surprised if it takes more time in future
because of new algorithms added to providers. If QGIS was reading proper
way or even open to accepting fixes.

The entire proposal/request to put back OTB was that decision was made on
OLD code. when the update code is there, it has less problems.
Based on concerns raised by other developers no matter if you can fix it,
they can't be put back. This single point was fueling this and other
threads.
Also discussion wasn't started with "why no providers are included?". It
was why some of them are removed even if there is an offer to help!

I don't care enough to continue this discussion about plugin or not plugin.

But aside all decision making stuff, can you check what is to be done in
this PR?
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6272
It is something worthy a discussion and not a plugin or not. I was asking
because QGIS 3 is near and diff is not that big.
If there is something extra need to be done to get this merged, I would
happy to hear about it.

Hi Matteo,

my 2cts: try to fix it either by fixing the code that creates the url
for the  1. Help system URL (even if that would need a switch from
native->qgis or so)..
OR by just plain renaming those directories in the manual (2. doc URL)
(as in Sphinx the links are never the the real html names, but to those
ref-id's). Note that renaming files or directories means changing
paths/resourcenames for transifex too.

only if all fails I would start to create redirects, as in my experience
these are very hard to maintain, especially when they need to work
between different kind of QGIS versions....

Richard Duivenvoorde

No changes here. You just have to specify a QGIS2.ini or QGIS3.ini to

Hi Richard,

(good test!)

I've tested on Windows 10 through OGR using MS4W 3.2.3, which includes 
the latest ca-cert bundle, and an updated libcurl, here are the results:

(note that by running the command "setenv.bat" it automagically sets the 
CURL_CA_BUNDLE variable)

https://gist.github.com/jmckenna/1d4d2c741236f44cc91299dd487fb647

Thanks for sharing this test.




(latest MS4W:  http://ms4w.com )

-jeff

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] [Server] Is QGIS Server 3 fast yet ? the 2018-02-06
Message-ID: <6d3e0013-de38-3419-86f7-3065557f87fa@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

I have made some analyse of the performances data generated by 
CampToCamp test platform.
The data are downloadable here 
https://gmf-test.sig.cloud.camptocamp.net/ms_perfs/
And the tests are based on this docker-pull: 
https://github.com/camptocamp/ms_perfs

The QGIS Server docker used for these tests are based on the Kartoza one 
updated by CampToCamp
https://github.com/kartoza/docker-qgis-server It is based on Apache 
Server and FCGI.

The data comes from OpenStreetMap and are stored in a PostgreSQL/PostGIS 
database.
One type of request is tested, GetMap. Varoious number of simultaneous 
users and various scale
are tested.

To give an answer to the question : Is QGIS Server 3 fast yet ? , I only 
used the values for 10 simultaneous
users.

If the reference to the question is QGIS Server 2: QGIS Server 3 is NOT 
faster even with the trust option activated in the project.
QGIS Server 3 is always slower than QGIS Server 2, when only one layer 
is requested.
In the tests, QGIS Sever 3 is faster than QGIS Server 2 with 
multi-layers and complex styles.

This result can be easily explain by the new way QGIS Server is loaded 
project. QGIS Server 3 uses the QgsProject class, so all the
project : layers and layouts are loaded even if only one layer is requested.

About the trust project option, the results are a little bit 
disappointing. The performances are not always better than without.
For higher scale (1° by 800px), requests are slower, but for lower scale 
(0.015625° by 800px), they are faster.

Now if we consired GeoServer-jai as a reference, QGIS Server 3 is slower 
in lower sacle (0.03125° by 800px)
Now if we consired Mapserver as a reference, QGIS Server 3 is slower!

We have to test some configuration:
* disable simplify local
* change simplify max scale

Points of enhancement have to be explored :
* Faster QgsProject loading based on project parsing
* Simplify configuration at layer level
* Completing trust option

Regards,
René-Luc
* Enhance simplification

Hi René Luc, 

Good points. I also had a look at these stats and was disappointed. 

So I agree that it would be worth-wile working on improving the
performance of QGIS server version 3. 

On the QgsProject loading performance issue: is this only an issue at
the first loading of the project or every time a request is being made? 

Definitely I would welcome a submission at the next round of QGIS grants
to further study the issues and improve perfomance were possible. 

Thanks for your thoughts,

Hi Régis, 

Good points. OGC certification is certainly important and would help us
market QGIS server to potential users. On the other hand - for me
personally - improving performance to bring it at least back to the same
level like version 2 (if not better) is of much higher priority. 

Thanks for having a look at how certification may work. 

Let's talk about it in Madeira.

Hi René Luc,
thanks a lot for starting that analysis!

Do you plan to be in Madeira? Elaborating a complete test suite together
would be perfectly fitted for that task .

Some questions:

- Trust option is only there to not query datasource when this one has no
metadata for PK and extent. So it should only make sense to compare the
first getcapabilities or project load with and without trust option. Other
following requests should not have any impact, so we need to make sure the
platform is not measuring something else in the differences you note. So I
don't see what you mean by "completing" the trust option. Can you be more
explicit ?

- Is the test  platform requesting wms layer groups, and did you test the
multithread rendering? How many cores? How many cores really available when
testing?

I think we should first elaborate a common reference test suite and couple
a system monitoring at the same time to be sure we don't have external
noise in the tests, and find system bottlenecks. Then only we can consider
some conclusions over development priorities I think.

Many thanks !

Régis

I probably missed something. Are you refering to the taking advantage of
the setting "Evaluate expressions on QGIS side when possible" ?

Yep, I agree on the priorities too, we are in an estimating stage for
Orange. I bet the thread anbout performance can push this one upper on the
todo list :)
Let's sprint that in Madeira.

Great news, merci Régis.
IMHO it is not important to set priorities: both standards and
performances are important, for different reasons, and implementing one
will not interfere with the other - just different actors will be involved.
I'm sure both will receive higher support from PSC and QGIS community as
a whole, especially power users.
All the best.

true, but removal from core would mean the external plugin has to be
created, maintained, tested, and documented by someone. If this is
missing, the external plugin simply wil not appear. This is what
happened with R. Once a provider is out and unmaintained, it becomes
less visible, and less likely to attract attention. The work to bring it
back to life, with all the above, will be much higher than when in core,
and increasing over time.
All the best.

agreed fully. as agreed upon during latest PSC meeting, the matter
should better be solved before Q3 release: it's such a pity having help
and not being able to display it to users.
I would ask Richard, who is familiar with the structure, to decide for
the best solution, and ask the most appropriate person to implement it.
QGIS:ORG has some limited resources to implement it if necessary.
Thanks again.

Trust option can be usefull with Apache. When you use QGIS Server with 
Apache, the QGIS Server processes are regularly reset. So the QGIS 
Server cache is regularly cleaned, and the project is regularly 
reloaded. So the trust option can affect all the request not only 
GetCapabilities.
So the average time request is affected by trust option, but I was 
thinking that this option make QGIS Server 3 faster at all scale and 
it's not the case for high scale.
I have open an issue to request min,max, median requests time to have an 
idea of the time needed to load project.

The platform requesting layers, not layer groups and multithreading 
rendering has been activated. the environnment variables are:
     QGIS_SERVER_PARALLEL_RENDERING: "true"
    QGIS_SERVER_MAX_THREADS: 8

The platform provided by camptomcamp is a good start and some 
enhancement has been already opened :
* test GetCapabilties
* test GetFeatureInfo
* test with labels

And we have multi options to test:
* with and without multithreading
* with and without local simplification (for postgres)
* with and without data projection (here form EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857)

And we have other server configuration to test
* Nginx/Supervisor
* Embedding QGIS Server in Tornado or other Python server

Hi Andreas,

The problem with Apache is that the QGIS Server processes are regularly 
reset. So the QGIS Server cache is regularly cleaned, and the project is 
regularly reloaded. So the project is not loading every time a request 
is being made but some time.

I have opened an issue to have min, max and median requests time to have 
a better idea of the performances. But I have no skill in SCALA and 
Gatling to propose a PR.

It will be great to test other Web Server like Nginx/Supervisor or 
Tornado embedding QGIS Server.

Regards,
René-Luc

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Open attribute table dialog Parsingerror
Message-ID: <1518117815988-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,
I want update my Plugin for QGis 2.14.
My "AttributeTable" Button works but I get a Note in the upper corner:
"Parsingerror: syntax error, unexpected $end"

I don't know why because the AttributeTable pop up. But the Note is
annoying.
The sourcecode via Python is simple:
self.iface.showAttributeTable(self.iface.activeLayer())

Does somebody has any idea?
That was not the case in the previous version 2.8

Thanks
luna

Any idea why the QGIS processes are regularly reset? mod_fcgi has
config option FcgidMaxRequestsPerProcess that terminates FastCGI
process after processing certain number of requests, but that should
be zero (= disabled) by default. Then there is FcgidProcessLifeTime
option which is set to 1 hour by default, so it should not really
affect the tests.

Or is it possible that the processes crash sometimes and that is why
they are restarted?

Hi,
         As I continue the development of AequilibraE (a plugin focused on
tools for transportation modelling), I wish I had access to statistics on
who has downloaded the plugin (e.g. Google Analytics).  That would help me
see what the audience is and, hopefully, gauge better where to put efforts
on.

Is that something that other people also see as useful?  If so, is that
technically possible? Is that planned in any ways?

Feedback on this approach is welcome, but I think fixing in the code
is correct vs fixing via redirects.

Yes, this is a great point. I think this discussion has got
sidetracked with some misunderstandings.

Here's the situation as I see it:

------------
The past
-----------

We (the QGIS project) have struggled to keep a bunch of providers
stable and available with the base QGIS install, and the current
maintainers (Alex and Victor, others) have (understandably) struggled
with the burden of maintaining these alone and the time commitment
required to do so. Users have been frustrated by breakage which occurs
when the algorithms they depend on break due to changes in underlying
libraries for which the processing providers have not been adapted.

Despite this, I'd say overall it's worked OK-ish up to now, but
definitely with lots of room for improvement.

-------------
The goals
-------------

I think everyone involved is in agreement that processing's strength
comes when there's many providers available and it's able to tie
together processes regardless of which provider or library they come
from. So I'd say our common goals are:

1. Encourage development of as many processing providers as possible
2. Make it easy for developers to create and maintain these providers
3. Make it easy for users to be able to use the providers
4. Make everything stable and painfree for users

Any disagreements? No? Good ;)

So if we agree that those are the end goals, we should be using them
to drive this discussion.

-------------------
The questions
-------------------

The open, debatable questions are:

- Which is the best approach for allowing easy maintenance of
providers (*regardless* of whether the provider is maintained by the
core QGIS team or a 3rd party)? Is it keeping the code in the master
codebase and locking to QGIS releases, or publishing via plugins and
having independent release schedules? Which approach will encourage
more active maintenance of these providers and share the burden of
this maintenance?

- Who should be responsible for maintaining the providers? Should
maintenance be done by the QGIS core developer team or by 3rd parties?

- How do we make these tools available for ALL interested users? How
can we ensure that 3rd party dependencies are always available and
have a consistent feature set, regardless of which platform the user
is running? Does having the QGIS team or 3rd parties maintain the
provider help make the tools more readily available? Does having the
providers in master or plugins make the 3rd party dependencies more
readily available or not?

- How can we ensure that providers are well tested and don't break
with changes in QGIS OR from 3rd party library updates? Does having
the QGIS team or 3rd parties affect this stability? Does having the
providers in master or plugins affect this stability?

- Is it a core requirement that 3rd party providers are installed with
EVERY QGIS install, or is it acceptable to require interested users to
manually install the tools which they find useful? If the second
option is preferred, then how can we ensure that users are aware of
the availability of these tools?

- Does it make it easier for everyone involved if we just delete all
the python bindings for processing and only allow core, native, c++
algorithms, and merge all our codebases into a single unified
QGIS+SAGA+GRASS+OTB+R mega package? (I joke... ;)

This isn't an easy discussion, but please, let's keep the discussion
civil, factual, and informed, and driven by the above goals.

Just a heads-up: I've noticed while testing the above PR that while it
fixes the native/3d/qgis issue, there's an issue with how the anchor
links in the docs have been named.

E.g.

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/database.html#import-into-spatialite

should actually be

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/database.html#importintospatialite

Using the algorithm id and not its name. The id is unique,
non-translated, and guaranteed to be set for the lifetime of 3.x, but
algorithm names are translated, can be tweaked and refined and are not
locked.

With the above PR the help directs to the URL using an id based
anchor, so the anchors themselves in the docs should be updated to fix
this.

I spent some time today looking into this issue. The end result was
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6300, but it's mostly
micro-optimisations and definitely not of the order of 50% like the
report describes.

I can only think it's a speed regression somewhere in Qt itself...

so the provider issue is fixed. Now from the doc side, we have to change
the section headers so that they match the unique id of the algorithms
in the code. Did I understand it correctly?

Many thanks again

Thanks a lot Nyall.
Who can change to doc side of it? Need help?

while I understand it is useful to know our user better, I'm not sure we
want to allow collecting data on them; previous discussions on this
subject resulted in a clear "no" from most if not all parties involved.

Using the algorithm id

yes, but I think we first have to rename the rst files like:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/source/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vector_analysis_tools.rst

to

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/source/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectoranalysis.rst

so the output html name becomes 'vectoranalysis.html'. Apparently
filenames earlier where chosen for readability, but we now use the
'groupid' (looking at Nyalls pull
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6298/commits/2d1e9188f18c40028b5501fe4c719808e8e20800)

And THEN we need to make sure the section names/headers indeed are the
same as generated by the helpurl code, so the anchor is ok:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectoranalysis.html#nearestneighbouranalysis

So as Nyall is saying: using the algorithm id instead of the name.

One thing to note: If I am correct Alex (in cc) was the one who created
all the templates for this algorithms via a script. I wonder if he saw
that as a one-time template generation, or that it was his intention to
keep stuff uptodate this way? @Alex?

Hi Rashad,

Thanks for your time.

But I do think that you do not give enough credit to Alex et al here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6272#issuecomment-364368721

By telling us that "just because of you can't understand this simple
stuff". I think we/Alex ask valid questions about the consequences for
OTHER providers and QGIS and processing as a whole. While to you it is
'a simple PR'. QGIS devs feel responsible for the whole picture, and OTB
provider is a part of the pack that have to fit in.

Maybe at a hackfest, foss4g or other meeting it is good to come together
face to face so it is easier to actually SHOW each other the
bears/problems we see?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

The change is not small. It might have important consequences in other
parts of Processing. I gave the PR a +1, probably without having
analyzed it in detail. Alex and Nyall had some doubts and asked you
questions. That's how it works. I guess you can understand that, even
if you think the change is safe, others (in this case with a deeper
understanding of the QGIS core code) might want to be sure of that.

In the comments to the PR you replied with "That's your problem. fix
it on your side." No, sorry, but it is not like that. If you submit a
PR, there should be no need to fix anything after merging it. If it
breaks something, you should provide a fix in the PR itself. Ideally,
we should have tests that warn us about any possible break. Since we
don't have them, we (the developers that take care of merging your PR)
play that role and try to analyze what might happen if the PR is
merged. That takes time, and in some cases discussion is needed.
Please, show more respect in your comments.

I suggest leaving the PR open and continue discussing it. It might be
a good contribution to the Processing code and might make things
easier for the OTB provider, but please understand that all changes
must be carefully analyzed in case it's not clear that they are needed
or are safe.

Cheers.

Just small correction. I wasn't the one who created initial RST files, I only
used existing script to created new RST files for algorithms which were
added after integrating Processing documentation into User Guide.
Files were added because some community members were sure that having
such templates will encourage users to write documentation. But this did not
worked in the end.

yes, and this is an "easy" fix, just a couple of renamings

while this is a not-so-small work, but easy to do it.

The only thing I'm a little concerned is readability of the final html
file.

Changing the name of the alrotihm/section from Nearest neighbour
analysis to nearestneighbouranalysis will bring us to have a
concatenated name for all algorithms, right?

I'm definitely not a sphinx guru, but is there the change to have a kind
of :meta: tag before each section and use this :meta: to build the URL?

Thanks Richard for the feedback

Matteo

We don't need to change the algorithms titles, we just need to add an extra
anchor with the algorithm ID before it:

.. _nearestneighbouranalysis:

Nearest neighbour analysis
--------------------------

Description
...........

<put algorithm description here>

This produces a url like we need (assuming that we rename the rst files, of
course.

thanks for the hint.

I've already put anchors before each algorithm, but with the provider name:

.. _qgis_nearestneighbouranalysis:

so I can get rid of the provider name and it should work correctly?

Thanks

I thought wat Alexandre was saying was ok, but trying it out, it seems
just to create a 'span' with that id not a href#anchor ...

Anybody else can try?

changing the file name works fine. I have locally

file:///home/matteo/lavori/QGIS/QGIS-Documentation/QGIS-Documentation/output/html/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/rasterterrainanalysis.html

but not for anchors that are still taken from the header

file:///home/matteo/lavori/QGIS/QGIS-Documentation/QGIS-Documentation/output/html/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/rasterterrainanalysis.html#hypsometric-curves

even if the anchor name is different:

.. _bla_bla_bla:

Hypsometric curves

Hi,

Maybe we can also fix this issue on the application side: in docs, we try
to give the section title the same name as the alg ie the way it's shown to
user (eg "hypsometric curves"). What Sphinx does is to concatenate it with
hyphen when building the url. How about doing this concatenation in helpUrl
function? this way, link from QGIS will already be
"helpId/groupID/algnameconcatenatedbyhyphen" --> same thing as generated by
docs!
In other words, in

 algHelp = QgsHelp::helpUrl( QStringLiteral( "processing_algs/%1/%2.html#%3"
).arg( mAlgorithm->provider()->helpId(), mAlgorithm->groupId(), mAlgorithm->
name() ) );

replace the mAlgorithm->name() by something that replaces each space
between the words in name() by  a hyphen?

 algHelp = QgsHelp::helpUrl( QStringLiteral( "processing_algs/%1/%2.html#%3"
).arg( mAlgorithm->provider()->helpId(), mAlgorithm->groupId(), mAlgorithm->
name().replace (' ', '-') ) );

Does that sound correct?

my 2cts,
Harrissou

Actually, name() does not contain spacing and I think displayName is
translated. So should not work as is

So, is it settled for Processing algorithms help? If so, we should
celebrate!!

Then, we need to think about the rest of the help system :D

(resending as was sent with wrong email...)

Ah, yes, confirmed... funny:

<span id="nearestneighbouranalysis"></span>

is usable as an anchor?

Well if it works (in all OS's and browsers?) it works :-)

Any html guru's here?

@Harrissou: I think Nyall's idea to use the id's is best, as the name
could have been translated?

I didn't know this, but apparently anything can be an anchor:

https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#h-12.2.3

So the span is fine.

I also understood it this way (also Alex explained this). name() is what
users see (and could be translated) while id() is unique an not-translatable

Hi Nyall,

THANKS! Working :-)

One thing which I would like to ask:

Would it be possible to write, the url which is searched for, to the
MessageLog/Log Message Panel (in a tab named 'QGIS Help') or so?

So (even a normal user) can when he/she sees a 'Oops no help' can check
if the actual url looked for is a valid one or not.

Somewhere like here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/qgshelp.cpp#L75

We have a lot of different Oopsies possible to find out and/or fixed:
- redirects
- wrong group ids
- wrong names
- not picked up settings (
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17670)
- local vs remote help (to be implemented
- wrong Documentation paths setting (or one of the vars in it)

Would be great if that could be checked.
This would FIX issue https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17666 :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing data defined parameters in modeler
Message-ID: <32b758ca-07d5-4fb6-ae59-dcbd4714e23a@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm playing with the Processing modeler and I noticed something weird
when using data defined options.

The simple algorithm "Buffer" now accepts the data defined parameter for
the distance. So I have a simple model with vector, vector field and
buffer algorithm.

In order to define the distance of the buffer from the field I have to
use the expression dialog and put the @vector-field-name parameter
(Field and Value menu shows only one NULL entry)

But it seems  it is not taken for the calculation of the distance.

Outside the modeler it works perfect.

Am I using this option in the wrong way?

Thanks

Matteo

Hello all,

Thanks René-Luc for this first analysis and all other for your though.
Here some informations :)

First I won't be at Madeira and this is the 2nd hackfest I missed in one
year. That's a pity but I have a onsite trip for a customer each French
holiday.

But, I think Camptocamp has some R&D on QGIS performance so I will check
this afternoon's meeting how we can start this. Performance improvement
could be either analyze QGIS, add new test (GetFeatureInfo, etc.).

René-Luc, could you open a ticket (if not already did) about any changes
you think valuable?!

Y.

Hi Rashad,
please be patient: bear with us, and we'll find the most efficient
solution. In QGIS we have a very friendly environment, even when tech
discussion may seem harsh and lengthy. I'm sure there is ample room for
profitable cooperation.
All the best, and thanks for your work.

Hi Pedro,
can't you just put a link to the plugin description directing to a simple  
survey users might fill in?
This kind of data would be of much more use than mere download numbers and  
it would be completely voluntary.

Just an idea,
Bernd

One thing is where to keep the code, however I'm not sure what code are we
talking about and I would like to talk about this first. I think that
recent post by Moritz is bringing this up as well:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2018-February/087420.html

As far as I know, QGIS Processing has a text file for each GRASS module
describing its interface and maintenance of these takes time. However,
every GRASS module can tell about itself when called with
--interface-description parameter. If this is used, individual parameters
don't need to be maintained and any, even user provided module can be
executed in processing.

The --interface-description parameter gives XML which would need to be
converted or a new parameter, let's say --qgis-description, would need to
be added for a QGIS-specific format, there is for example --script for
GRASS GIS interface description for scripts. --qgis-description would need
to be in GRASS GIS code base while the conversion can be anywhere. See
emails from Rashad discussing a possible implementation with the
--qgis-description way and the OTB way:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2018-February/087362.html
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2018-February/087390.html

The was discussed in the past and in fact, it is used in the QGIS GRASS
plugin as Radim explains in this older email:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2015-March/074629.html

However, it is not using the --interface-description XML only, but it is
also using the qgm files to supply some additional information which means
that this system still requires updates which are separate from the updates
of GRASS modules. This can be avoided if the necessary information is
updated upstream or sometimes even GRASS --interface-description format or
the individual module descriptions are extended to include that what is
needed by QGIS Processing. Here is a thread which disuses this issues
although diverges into the following:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2015-September/076138.html

One issue which is creating differences between QGIS Processing
representation of the module and the GRASS one is the issue of advanced
parameters. GRASS itself has mechanism to organize the parameters into
groups and marks the required ones. This is of course something which is
constantly being refined and it can be used and changed also for QGIS
Processing as discussed in this 2015 post:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2015-December/078000.html

Other issues besides the interface include list of GRASS modules usable and
unusable in QGIS Processing, thematic tree of these modules, splitting
modules and more. Many of these are discussed in this recent post:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2018-February/087388.html

One of the issues is issue of formats (or import & export). Here again, it
seems to that it is more advantageous to have a function in GRASS code base
to care take of the import and, if needed, push the changes upstream to it
(from QGIS point of view). Here is a related example which is a comment
from Markus Neteler (regarding currently preferred solution for vector
import) which would be part of PR/patch review process if the import
function was originally submitted as extension of GRASS code base:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5426#issuecomment-345067457

Then there is of course the issue of GRASS modules which are more difficult
to wrap in QGIS Processing because the inputs and outputs are not
explicitly stated, most prominent example is probably r.mapcalc but there
is couple of more, although we were able to reduce this number lately:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2015-January/072979.html

See also the following post from Giovanni Manghi (sent off-list to Markus
Neteler and shared by him) and a ticket commend by me for more examples and
details:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2014-August/070342.html
https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/ticket/2409#comment:17

Here is a good r.mapcalc-related example of (at least) asking for changes
upstream (although sent privately to Markus Neteler who opened the issue):

https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/ticket/3431

> - Who should be responsible for maintaining the providers? Should
> maintenance be done by the QGIS core developer team or by 3rd parties?

I'm not sure if we can really separate this from the place in the code, but
if there is a notion of pushing changes upstream then that gives
definitively us more flexibility.

Besides maintenance, I think the initial development, which is necessary
for a realistic maintenance plan, is a major issue. I, and I think some
other GRASS devs too, would be happy to work on it if the financing is
addressed. A different suggestion is here as well and that's GSoC idea
proposed by Martin Landa:

https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/GSoC/2018#ImproveGRASSintegrationinQGIS3

> - Is it a core requirement that 3rd party providers are installed with

If they install manually, on Windows, users can have the latest version of
the software instead of the one packaged with QGIS. OSGeo4W is a different
case; not sure about Mac. However, on Linux, the decision is up to the
packagers, so in any case, the QGIS part needs to be able to work with
different versions. Regardless of QGIS packaging efforts, I have seen many
users with old GRASS who installed new standalone GRASS on the side, even
recently.

On the other hand, many users benefit from the one package, because they
need to get software approved, if they get QGIS packaged with GRASS
approve, they got GRASS as well. Getting approval for each individual
provider is likely more paperwork.

I hope this will help and let me know what I'm missing.

Best,
Vaclav

Unfortunately data defined parameters for algorithms are not yet
usable in models (well, they are, it's just that there's no gui to set
them yet) and can currently only be used through the toolbox.

For this reason the old "variable distance buffer" algorithm is still
available for use in models.

Hopefully in 3.2 we get a GUI for using data defined parameters within models.

Since Madeira is just around the corner, let's organize a round table
discussion on this issue. I've started a section here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/DeveloperMeetingMadeira2018#future-of-processing-providers

Please add yourself to the list if you are interested in participating
on-site or remotely. We'll then try to find a time slot that works for
everyone.

Anita

Paolo,
             I do understand the motivation of the no, and I guess there is
a range of what is acceptable in terms of information collection and what
is what, but it is good to know where the QGIS development community stands
on this.

Bernd,

I do have a mailing list. blog and issue tracker on GitHub that allows for
people to reach me, but my intention was only to have insights such as
where my users are, so I can provide examples and data samples that are
more pertinent to them.

I will look into creating a survey to be distributed with the next version
of the plugin (a link in the *about* menu).


Cheers,
Pedro

Thanks Vaclav for your detailed analysis. As expected, it seems that
there are a number of common tasks between GRASS and OTB, possibly also
SAGA, so it make sense to keep a joint discussion. Please consider
participating even remotely to the HackFest discussion:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/DeveloperMeetingMadeira2018#future-of-processing-providers
All the best.

Hi Nyall

The code is on github ..

https://github.com/ccrook/QGIS-VectorFieldRenderer-Plugin/tree/qgis3_wip

I've documented this in issue 8 at:

https://github.com/ccrook/QGIS-VectorFieldRenderer-Plugin/issues/8

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated :-)

Chris

Interesting - is your code public anywhere? I'll take a look.

Are you just suggesting this feature (I agree, it seems like it would be
nice to have, particularly in the processing toolbox), or would you propose
to do something to implement it?

Note that v.triangle itself is not distributed with GRASS and therefore
QGIS, as it has been deemed to be incompatible with the GPL.
The GRASS wiki states that it "is not free for commercial use", but this
appears to be an exaggeration - the homepage says it "may not be sold or
included in commercial products without a license", so commercial use is
OK, just not commercial distribution.

Hello,

One tells me that Camptocamp had wrote a proposition about performance
issue with PNG format. I will ask to Patrick if he can do more
performance profiling and if this proposition is still up to date.
Unfortunately not before next 2 weeks :(

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] [Server] Package 2.18,
	GetPrint requests are segfaulting
Message-ID: <0ed44aa6-265d-e156-b083-6accf691f99f@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

QGIS 2.18 will become the new LTR in les than 2 weeks and an issue in 
the server still remains.
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15440 https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15440
This issue is a regression for users because in QGIS Server 2.18, 
GetPrint requests are segfaulting.

I have tested on the same server, a Debian Jessie OS, 2 versions of QGIS 
Server 2.18:
* The first one installed with the qgis.org package
* The second one build from source

The first one is segfaulting, and second one is not segfaulting.

The issue is available on Debian, Ubuntu and Windows.

How the packages are build ? Which configuration is used ?

Regards,
René-Luc

Hi Jürgen,

Thanks for this link, I didn't know it.

What is the parameters used to build QGIS for packaging ?

Hi,

This code used to work in QGIS 2.x.

|lblTitle =myComposition.getComposerItemById('title')|||lblTitle|.setText('New Title')|

|However, in QGIS |2.99, myLayout.itemById('title') returns this error :

|'QgsLayoutItem' object has no attribute 'setText'|

This problem is related to the following issue :
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17152

The following workaround still works :
https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe/blob/develop/safe/report/processors/default.py#L54

Can this be corrected in QGIS 3.0 ?

Hi Nyall

Thanks so much for the pointer (idea that is, not C++ pointer) .. I'll give it a go

Cheers

Ok, so the issue is that you're trying to call the base class methods by calling

    QgsFeatureRenderer.startRender(context,fields)

That's not valid syntax. In Python 3 you should use:

    super().startRender(context,fields)

Fixing those calls avoids the assert.

...BUT....

You'll get a lot of crashes, because there's other parts of your
renderer which need upgrading to QGIS 3.0 API. And unfortunately when
a renderer crashes in Python code, it segfaults after dumping the
python error to the console. You'll need to run in a console to see
the Python errors which are thrown and upgrade the corresponding API
calls.

Also - I noticed you access a layer from the project within your
startRender method -- is is very unsafe for a renderer to do, since it
is running in a background thread and should not be accessing layers
at all. Just another thing to try to refactor out as you upgrade your
plugin for 3.0!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Strange issue in QGIS 2.18 (not in QGIS 2.14 nor
	2.99)
Message-ID: <CAMB2qw1J9Sdqs0LxrkMp9DvYrF3KMxjKOPFfZH61xYYQHsx0zw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to anybody,

can you test the attachment in this ticket?

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18063

On Windows 7 - 64 bit and QGIS 2.18.14/16, opening the first composer
and trying to export to PDF, BAAM, QGIS crashes!

In the composer the map is rotated 270 degrees; but if I set to 269,99
it doesn't crash. Maybe a division by zero issue in code?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How QGIS Python API doc is generated?
Message-ID: <c8bbc3ae-1700-9048-85fc-0d4e9a5f7a3e@free.fr>

Hello,

We get an issue for the QGIS Python API doc (see
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18088). I am not sure if this is really
valuable to fix this as it could be not easy.

Anyone knows how to generate this doc?

Thanks,

Y.

Hi all,

For the record:
- All Processing help pull-requests have now got at least one round of
review.
- Processing help files have been renamed to match groupId so pushing any
algorithm help button should lead you at least to the page it "is"
documented. You will not always directly get the algorithm section (it
fails if name is not a single word like clip, intersection...) but I wonder
if that's really an issue given that at the top of each page we have the
TOC listing all provided algorithms --> you just need one more click.
@Richard, did you have time to investigate the id span thingies you were
referring to last day? Is it worth the effort? Could that live together
with our current .. _qgis_clip: anchor?

For me, processing help system is fixed but the help system itself is not.
It still suffers from suffers obstacles which it puts on the capacity of
the writers to update the user manual without complications: section URLs
are currently hard coded in application and changing a section title (hence
the url) breaks the help button. With a living doc like the user manual,
with all the new features and improvements QGIS gets, it would be hard to
keep same titles at same place forever (either because it no longer
describes new features of the dialog, or the dialog gets renamed, or
features are moved to another place, or we find a better, more appropriate
wording, or...) and documenters should not care about that. For information
we have pending PRs in docs that will break some of the already connected
links.

Developers improve the application, documenters improve the manuals and we
find a way to keep links working as long as possible without anyone
stressing. Please, let's do something more sustainable!
Thanks.

Regards,
Harrissou

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Split parts tool creates invalid polygons
Message-ID: <CAFFV8Fj4NoviQJiR6yv6iUBgB0ee=h+PNiCpgWLKWgE411Fbig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The split parts tool creates invalid polygons according to GEOS check
validity. This issue seems to have been discussed two years ago
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/12799 but it still persists today in master.

To reproduce:
1. Create a memory layer with multipolygon type
2. Add a polygon
3. Split the polygon using split parts
4. Use the vertex tool to move the parts apart, in order to avoid issues
with polygon parts sharing an edge or vertex
5. Run check validity

Method GEOS returns 1 invalid:

{'ERROR_COUNT': 0, 'ERROR_OUTPUT':
'output_bd77440a_35eb_4f60_8273_3e4be16349f1', 'INVALID_COUNT': 1,
'INVALID_OUTPUT': 'output_3e1922d6_dc3d_40e1_a0a3_6becbd5cbeb3',
'VALID_COUNT': 0, 'VALID_OUTPUT':
'output_ba297216_4997_4b0d_accd_b1669ff038a5'}

Method QGIS returns
​ 1 valid​
:

{'ERROR_COUNT': 0, 'ERROR_OUTPUT':
'output_9feeaeb9_569b_40e8_9062_ad7bd411472d', 'INVALID_COUNT': 0,
'INVALID_OUTPUT': 'output_b6b99e1e_1bbe_442f_8864_99d334efdf45',
'VALID_COUNT': 1, 'VALID_OUTPUT':
'output_0a7d2f97_4bcc_40c1_806e_ad0ff73bcd05'}

The attribute table
​ of GEOS' invalid output layer does not provide any information on the
type of error.

Should I reopen the ticket? I don't see how this tool can be used without
ruining the features.

Regards,
Anita

Hi Anita,

Tried what you said but cannot reproduce it. This might depend a lot on 
what shape you draw and how/where you cut it. What does your validation 
error say?

I got this:


Processing algorithm...
Algorithm 'Check validity' starting...
Input parameters:
{ 'INVALID_OUTPUT' : 'memory:', 'VALID_OUTPUT' : 'memory:', 
'INPUT_LAYER' :

'ERROR_OUTPUT' : 'memory:', 'METHOD' : 2 }

Execution completed in 0.12 seconds
Results:
{'ERROR_COUNT': 0, 'ERROR_OUTPUT':

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Read QgsProject properties
Message-ID: <31c9a12f-b86c-97c5-f823-0e82af4765b1@servus.at>

Hi,

I'm doing my first explorations into pyqgis and I'm quite amazed,
compliments for the design of the QGIS API!

So far I recursively read layer groups and layers from QgsProject and
write a json file which I then use to build a layer switcher for Openlayers.

Now I need to add additional information which is part of .qgs project
file, but I don't have any clue how to access it without parsing the
XML. Everything from .qgs can be read by API methods?

For example, I want to add to each layer its "Identifiable" info. There
is a XML tag called <Identify> in .qgs, how do I get there? I tried with
readEntry() and readListEntry() but without success.

Or is there any handy reference of all the project properties and how to
read them by the API?

Thanks
Gerald

The answer depends which QGIS version you're targetting. Are you
developing for 2.x or 3.0?

Hi Nyalll

That's brilliant - thanka\s for taking such a detailed look at this.  There are indeed several other things I need to fix but at least I an approach sorted now.

Ok, so the issue is that you're trying to call the base class methods by calling

    QgsFeatureRenderer.startRender(context,fields)

That's not valid syntax. In Python 3 you should use:

    super().startRender(context,fields)

Fixing those calls avoids the assert.

...BUT....

You'll get a lot of crashes, because there's other parts of your
renderer which need upgrading to QGIS 3.0 API. And unfortunately when
a renderer crashes in Python code, it segfaults after dumping the
python error to the console. You'll need to run in a console to see
the Python errors which are thrown and upgrade the corresponding API
calls.

Also - I noticed you access a layer from the project within your
startRender method -- is is very unsafe for a renderer to do, since it
is running in a background thread and should not be accessing layers
at all. Just another thing to try to refactor out as you upgrade your
plugin for 3.0!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Concerns re UX of new "duplicate features" actions
	in 2.99
Message-ID: <CAB28AsijnXaP92Sr7R1kj3KHYwxP+Mw8O_k=s6YQs4MZ_DH4-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just wanted to raise discussion about a concern I have with the new
"duplicate feature" / "duplicate feature and redigitize" actions which
have been added for 3.0.

While I like the functionality, I believe we should re-think the UX of
how it is exposed in the QGIS interface.

Currently, it's implemented as a "feature action", so appears in
numerous places throughout the QGIS UI, including:
- the actions drop down submenu on the toolbar
- within the right click menu for the "identify tool"
- under the "actions" heading in the identify results dock for a feature
- in a menu bar at the top of the form shown after adding a new feature
- as an entry within the right click menu in the attribute table

So my initial concern is that exposing it in all these places is
overkill and far too prominent for this operation. But my deeper
concern is that these actions skip the edit buffer and directly alter
layers in place, even when those layers are not made editable
(https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17852). So now we've got a menu item
exposed in all these places which causes permanent changes to a layer,
including in places which are not associated with editing at all (e.g.
the identify tool right click menu).

I'm also unsure what the actions would do in some contexts - e.g. if I
create a new feature and then select "duplicate feature" in the popup
form *before* this feature has even be finalized, what does it mean?

I'd very much like to see this re-thought before our final release,
and exposed in a more standard way via the advanced digitizing
toolbar.

Thoughts?

I share those concerns too.

The integration with parts of QGIS is sub-optimal. For e.g., the added (and
always visible) menu bar in the attribute form. I'm not sure is should be
there at all, and if so, certainly not when the layer's edit mode is OFF.

IMHO, I'd disable/remove less-than-optimal UI integration (such as the
above mentioned example), leave the less intrusive ones in there (the
action tool's actions), and revisit the UI in the 3.2 dev cycle.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] When is Qt updated for the Windows releases?
Message-ID: <CAB28AshecpDEq5sv04VwCxts-9XbZWXPT6P0dbGeqpCiik0MWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all (well, mostly Jürgen),

I've been discussing with Nathan, and we have some questions about how
the Qt version library is handled with the windows builds, and when/if
we should be updating Qt libraries in our Windows releases.

If my understanding is correct, the osgeo4w architecture (and
correspondingly the windows release builds) only currently supports a
single version of qt 5 (and a single qt 4 version). If this is the
case, it means that upgrading our qt version at some stage to 5.9.4
(or 5.10.1) would also affect patch releases, right? E.g. updating to
5.10.1 for a future 3.2 release would mean that the next 3.0.x build
would also jump up to 5.10.1.

Is this interpretation correct? Do we consider this safe to do in a
patch mid-way through a stable release? And if not, does it mean we're
effectively stuck with the current version of Qt throughout the life
of 3.x?

I can't remember if we ever had to deal with this during 2.x - I'm
guessing we were probably stuck on the 4.8 ceiling from before we had
the whole LTR system in place (and maybe we've never had to deal with
this before).

Apart from https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17916 (which we need to
resolve before release anyway), there's some nice improvements in qt
5.10 which would be good to see us gain at some stage (notably the
much larger maximum QImage size -- opening the door for HUGE composer
outputs), and I'm sure the 3d engine is also much improved given the
heavy development there. So I'd hate to see the Windows builds locked
to 5.9 indefinitely.

Have you got any thoughts/plans for handling this situation? Keen to
hear your thoughts...

I think that is a very good idea. Currently the more robust way is to go with
Bernhards' DigitizingTools version of "Split Features".

Agreed, thanks Nyall for raising this point.
IMHO:
* remove duplication, leaving it only under editing
* disable it when the layer is not under editing.
All the best.

As 3.0 will be replaced with 3.2 once it's there (3.4 will be the next LTR), so
that's not the actual case.  But yes, switching to a newer version for Qt5 will
require to rebuild everything that uses Qt5 (currently that's - not counting
PyQt5 - only QGIS 3.x).

Not necessarily, but we'd have to update all 3.x to be able to build & run with
the Qt5 we have (ie. 3.4 and 3.x w/ x>4).

Windows is not the only platform.  Debian unstable is also at 5.9 currently,
buster/testing 5.9,  stretch/stable has 5.7 (so we build without 3D there).
bionic (next ubuntu lts) also has 5.9.

But what about dev releases? E.g. if we wanted to introduce 5.10 for
3.2 on Windows, then switching over the dev builds alone isn't
possible, right? We'd have to update the Qt library for all builds
(3.0.1 and above) and the dev builds simultaneously. I guess we could
theoretically time an upgrade to occur just before a stable release
(i.e. right before 3.2.0, when no more 3.0.x builds will be released),
but that sounds potentially dangerous.

Oh yeah, linux distros are a totally different matter and I'm not
suggesting any change there. I'm just curious about what the exact
situation is with the Windows builds.

Hi,
I totally agree. BTW, having a generic option to display some actions only
in edit mode would be a nice addition for 3.2!

Hi all,

Just wanted to raise discussion about a concern I have with the new
"duplicate feature" / "duplicate feature and redigitize" actions which
have been added for 3.0.

While I like the functionality, I believe we should re-think the UX of
how it is exposed in the QGIS interface.

Currently, it's implemented as a "feature action", so appears in
numerous places throughout the QGIS UI, including:
- the actions drop down submenu on the toolbar
- within the right click menu for the "identify tool"
- under the "actions" heading in the identify results dock for a feature
- in a menu bar at the top of the form shown after adding a new feature
- as an entry within the right click menu in the attribute table

So my initial concern is that exposing it in all these places is
overkill and far too prominent for this operation. But my deeper
concern is that these actions skip the edit buffer and directly alter
layers in place, even when those layers are not made editable
(https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17852). So now we've got a menu item
exposed in all these places which causes permanent changes to a layer,
including in places which are not associated with editing at all (e.g.
the identify tool right click menu).

I'm also unsure what the actions would do in some contexts - e.g. if I
create a new feature and then select "duplicate feature" in the popup
form *before* this feature has even be finalized, what does it mean?

I'd very much like to see this re-thought before our final release,
and exposed in a more standard way via the advanced digitizing
toolbar.

Thoughts?

If you're after avoiding to do extra builds any point release should do.  I
don't see a big issue - we'd just publish a new Qt on a point release along
with the new qgis builds that already use them - as long QGIS is the only
dependant.

Why does that matter?  If the code builds with 5.9 and 5.10 then there's no
QGIS issue.

I'm personally fine with this. I mean, generally Qt upgrades are
painless and don't introduce new bugs (especially the point releases).
The situation with 5.10 is an obvious exception - but I don't recall
ever having an issue like this in the past.  (Oh wait, let's add 5.6
and its QVariant mess to that list too... 5.6 was the worst Qt release
I've ever seen.)

Like I said above, I'm all in favour of upgrading Qt (I'd love to have
a windows 5.10.1 build). Manpower aside, I don't see any reason why we
wouldn't want the patch releases used as soon as they are available.
The point releases we should probably time just after our monthly
release so that the upgrade gets a full month of testing and there's
plenty of time to rollback if necessary. Bring on the upgrades I say!

This whole thread was just me trying to understand the
process/implications of the Windows build/release process.

With point releases I was refering to our monthly release.  I don't plan to do
any Qt updates unless we require them for new stuff (like 3D; which triggered
the update from 5.7 to 5.9).

But if we update I'd do them with one of our point releases so that the new
release is build with then available Qt - the next nightlies would also pick
them up.  Otherwise we'd have the release packages using a newer Qt then the
one they were built with.

That's all fair enough. Does your no-upgrade plan include Qt bug fix
releases? E.g. 5.9.4?

(Please understand I'm not asking you to do work here... I just want
to fully understand the plans).

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=z=1rLUCC5dpH95L+4YKCFHEDK5fVzf-zTtPmVDYGAXGQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to follow the code that produces the two return values from
QgsProcessingLagorithm.parameterAsSink in Python. I can't find where the
sip interface (or whatever) changes the API return value
<https://qgis.org/api/classQgsProcessingAlgorithm.html#ad9a7c675082ffe996184e37cf4913e00>
to the two returned values "sink" and "dest_id".

Where does it happen?
What does the second parameter (destination id) refer to?

Thanks,

This is the "destinationIdentifier" argument from the c++ API - sip
automatically converts arguments passed by reference like this into
return values. The PyQGIS docs show it a bit clearer.

> What does the second parameter (destination id) refer to?

Per the docs: "The destinationIdentifier argument will be set to a
string which can be used to retrieve the layer corresponding to the
sink,". It's a unique text identifier which processing uses to later
retrieve the result (and to pass on to following algorithms in a
model). The important thing here is that when your algorithm returns
its result dictionary, it should contain an entry for the output with
the corresponding destinationIdentifier as the value.

Here's a good example:

making the sink:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/qgis/CheckValidity.py#L126

including it in the results:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/qgis/CheckValidity.py#L196

If there was a plan, it would include it.  Now it's simply only done when there
is a significant need to do it (eg. QGIS doesn't build without it, we have to
support older version of Qt just to suit OSGeo4W or when it enables something
important; blurry yes).  That also applies to many other things in OSGeo4W
(except for QGIS, GRASS and GDAL).

I think it make some sense to design this as a map tool (if possible).
We don't have a simplify action, it's a map tool.

It could still be possible to add a custom action which will use the API to
duplicate the feature (if one really wants this feature as an action in the
form or attribute table or identify menu).

Enhancing the action API to define action on editable layers only sounds
like a good addition too, but I think is not sufficient here (taking the
simplify map tool as example).

My 2 cts.

Thanks Nyall and Salvatore.
I missed the SIP_OUT specifier of the destinationIdentifier parameter.

Some days ago I saw the PyQGIS API docs from a link by Nyall, but I can't
find it now. Where are they?

That's what I thought Salvatore, but I can only see the text "QGIS Python

I guess it's currently broken...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Bumping Qt to 5.9 on Travis
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+Z3JC=noYmugTy-G+Rfnm5xjr+az9TO+SJGdYAruDTydw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am wondering which versions of the base libraries we should build QGIS
upon on Travis. Read Qt, PyQt, SIP, etc.

Today the Docker image for the dependencies (qgis/qgis3-build-deps) is
based on Ubuntu 16.04 and ships Qt 5.5.
While this sounds reasonable for testing, it is not suitable for building
and publishing an image of QGIS or building the Python API doc.

So, I'd like to bump the Qt version on Travis to 5.9 (and SIP to 4.19.7).

Another advantage is that we will be able to build 3D on Travis too.

But, there won't be any error if one pushes changes only possible with
newest version of Qt and only Jürgen will notice it from the nightly builds.

Another approach would be to fire two builds on Travis (one on 5.5 and one
on latest). It would be pretty straightforward, but I guess that will be
slowing down the build (am I right?).

Let me know your thoughts,

Denis

I'd just drop 5.5 and stay with 5.9 + latest sip, thanks for taking care of
this!

​Strange, I tried this a couple of times yesterday before sending the email
... but today I don't get invalid features after moving the vertices apart.

​Sorry for the noise!

Dear all  
  
I  agree (and I guess everyone else does), that it's not okay that this feature is enabled when the layers are not in editable mode. I already started to fix that, but because of time I had to decide to finish it next week.  
  
Anyway, there is still the question, where it should appear. IMHO it should be everywhere, where you can add and delete features. If it's a MapTool it could be there as well, I think. I'll have to think about that.  
  
Thanks for your inputs  
Dave

	default?
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_FkXV9gPHGr0Dz8zc_oO=4=ETtMkshqYtLoP24bX+HxWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

It seems that in QGIS 3, the new Regular Shape Digitizing Toolbar is
enabled (visible) by default.

I love the work done for this toolbar, and for people doing lots of
digitizing it looks to be very handy, but I wonder, will that be used by
the majority of people that it "deserves" to be enabled by default?

The advanced digitizing toolbar is even more useful and it's disable by
default, for interface cleaness I guess.

I heard complains about QGIS showing too many buttons, for me this would be
an easy choice to disable

Cheers,

Alex Neto

repositories provide version 2.14, which appears to be the latest 
release that can be installed on these platforms.

Attempting install from the qgis unstable repository fails due to broken 
dependencies

As 2.18 would be supported as a previous LTR can we expect to see it 
supported on buster.

Thanks

The qgis package in Debian follows the QGIS Long-Term Repo which is also
at 2.14.20.

Next week it will switch to 2.18.17 [0], as will the package in Debian.

See the note on https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu.

If you use a unstable distribution the release packages can break, when the
base changes.  You can install from the nightly repositories, which exists for
the release, the long-term release and master - or wait for the next point
release.

Hi,

It seems that in QGIS 3, the new Regular Shape Digitizing Toolbar is
enabled (visible) by default.

I love the work done for this toolbar, and for people doing lots of
digitizing it looks to be very handy, but I wonder, will that be used by
the majority of people that it "deserves" to be enabled by default?

The advanced digitizing toolbar is even more useful and it's disable by
default, for interface cleaness I guess.

I heard complains about QGIS showing too many buttons, for me this would be
an easy choice to disable

Cheers,

Alex Neto

Hi,

Yes. I will rename

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] API freeze
Message-ID: <CAJy=XtdPzvzk=bayGUUvUihqxQs2Dpb67s8QoCawcxYBEiGpLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, In github wiki I read that: " QGIS 3 has entered feature freeze.
It's, therefore, time to port your plugin. But be aware that the *API is
not freezed yet*. "

Me and many other plugin developers are partecipating to QGIS3 migration
effort.
I'm handling issues notifications related to API break, (
https://github.com/enricofer/go2streetview/issues/35,
https://github.com/enricofer/go2mapillary/issues/9) and I would know when
API will be stable? Should we expect breaks till the final release?

I understand that core devs are working hard to make next release more
stable, I would only know how to schedule my time contribution.

Many Thanks.
Enrico Ferreguti

If I may, I prefer the current name; it represents what it does: help you
draw regular shapes (or some predictable shape).
Besides "Line and Polygon Digitizing Toolbar" looking too long, the
digitizing and advanced digitizing toolbars and panel also propose tools to
digitize lines and polygons afaict.

Hi Enrico,

Even if the API is not officialy frozen, you can consider it pretty much
stable, and I think it's safe to update your plugin now.

If anything changes from now on, I guess that we could ask to send a mail
on this list with [API BREAK] subject, but it's very likely to happen.

http://python.qgis.org/api/ is not up to date (misses the
QgsMessageBar.MessageLevel move to Qgis.MEssageLevel) but will be updated
in the next 48 hours. It is 3 weeks old and apart from MessageLevel, I
don't think there was big changes to the API for plugins authors.

Best wishes,
Denis

​The currently suggested time is Feb 23rd 10:30 UTC+00.

​So far, we have six people signed up. Please get in touch if the time
doesn't work for someone. We should be able to find a slot that's possible
for all six.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS3 - processing python script. Read features
	from output layer
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7XFq34=DkrUXstjHVheDyTg23txQbbJwqijA3c=WUJdw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a simple processing python alg which
* generates a buffer with qgis:buffer
* use qgis:fieldcalculator to add an buf_area field -> the output vector of
my alg is this buffer+new field.

I would like to parse the features of the output vector in order to gather
some information and put it in a new string output. I have not been able to
get the layer object to perform a getFeatures on it.

See the code
http://paste.debian.net/1010463/

In line 32, my blayer is None
I think I am not using the good way to get the output vector layer
features? I tried to use the same way as for reading an input layer, but
oviously it is different.

Regards
Michaël

QgsProject.nonIdentifiableLayers() does the trick, so I think it's save
to say that every tag in project .qgs can be accessed through the API

What does happen if you put area_result['OUTPUT'] directly instead of
self.parameterAsSource?
parameterAsSource() accept a parameter as first argument and area_result
should be already un QgsVectorLayer.

Where you are trying to execute it from?

I think that wiki page is just being prepared so it's ready for the
final release -- in any case API freeze isn't in place until the final
release.

The thinking here is that it's better to hold off the freeze for as
long as possible, as we don't want to be constrained by a frozen API
while fixing bugs. Better to hold off the freeze and have plugins not
available immediately on release then be stuck with a bug due we can't
fix for the next 3-4 years due to frozen API.

Thanks for the understanding,
Nyall

Hi Salvatore,

I already tried to use

blayer = area_result['OUTPUT']
for feat in blayer.getFeatures():
    ....

with no success . If I do so I get

AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'getFeatures'

There must be a way to transforme this string representing the layer as a
processing layer object....
I use this code inside the processAlgorithm method of my
QgsProcessingAlgorithm class.

blayer = QgsProcessingUtils.mapLayerFromString( area_result[ 'OUTPUT'
]), context )

I'm thinking of adding a shortcut for this to the context, e.g.:

blayer = context.getMapLayer( area_result['OUTPUT'] )

What do you think?

Thanks Nyall,

Our posts crossed !

Ok for the shortcut and the getMapLayer method.

One question : in my alg, if I use QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource
instead of QgsProcessingParameterVectorLayer for my input, can I still use
mapLayerFromString and the getFeatures, or is there a
featureSourceFromString which allows me to loop through the features ?

There's no method like that. At the moment all vector outputs from
processing algorithms are full vector layers (either disk-based or
memory layers). That's because currently only vector layers and vector
data providers are QgsFeatureSources. It's possible (likely?) that in

[1] E.g. I'd like to see QgsFeatureStore become a QgsFeatureSource,
and act as a simple dump for features without the complexity of using
a memory layer. I think there's a lot of value in QgsVectorLayerCache
also becoming a QgsFeatureSource... I think some processing algorithms
could greatly benefit from using a QgsVectorLayerCache, when they are
iterating multiple times of a source layer....

Hi all,

If you're running a QGIS 3.0 beta and have a hidpi/retina display, I'm
after some feedback.

Can you please run the following commands in the Python console:

ss = iface.mainWindow().styleSheet()
iface.mainWindow().setStyleSheet( ss + ' QToolBar > QToolButton
{padding: 8px;} ')

and see if the result is an improvement? Try running just the second
command and tweaking the padding amount, and let me know:

1. your platform
2. the "icon size" setting in QGIS options
3. what you think the ideal padding should be.

For me, on Win 10, 48px icon size, setting the padding to 8px makes a
HUGE improvement in the appearance of the toolbars. But I think this
padding needs tweaking by platform/icon size, which is why I need to
feedback...

Thanks for your explanation !
I also think it makes sense to share source layers in some cache in the
future.

"Regular shape" is a false name. So, what about "Advanced shape toolbar" ?

On my hi-dpi screen on Linux, 32px icon size, the padding of 8px seems
a bit too much. My style's default padding seems to be ~3px. I think
for me it looks the best with padding of 4px for my icon size.

Message-ID: <31c32f3a-4172-f87e-0f75-00a8d919db25@oslandia.com>

Hi,

Following my announcement on the osgeo4w-dev mailing list [1], I would
like to let you know that we now have a mirror to the OSGEO4W
distribution up and running on:

http://osgeo4w-oslandia.com/mirror/

We also provide some additional packages (including PostgreSQL and
PostGIS for instance) here :
http://osgeo4w-oslandia.com/extra/

This is the result of our Windows compilation infrastructure that uses
gitlab and gitlab-ci.

We would like to help make the OSGEO4W effort something more
reproducible, open and distributed in the long run.

The first step was to make public our internal repository that hosts
building scripts. It is now available on https://gitlab.com/Oslandia/osgeo4w

We use it to run packaging scripts and we plan to add QGIS compilation
very soon. But this could probably also be used as a CI to run tests on
Windows.

The current ongoing effort is about making the configuration of the
virtual machine used for compilation the more reproducible possible.

We will discuss in Madeira what is the best way to share our current
infrastructure with the community.

Thanks Hugo, and Oslandia people. PG is a very useful addition to the
osgeo shell. Just to know: why did you decide to rebuild the
infrastructure instead of joining forces to strengthen the existing one?
All the best.

On Linux,
32 and 8 is a bit much. 32 and 4-5 looks good.
48 and 6-8 look good too.

Hi Martin

Thanks for looking at this. For MacOS I can report that the current default looks great, 8px wastes a lot of space:

even if the Help button opens the correct group page and the user needs,
sometimes, one more click to go to the correct algorithm, I think it is
a pity not having a correct section redirection.

I could agree more on this. Specifically for Processing algorithms the
obstacle to have a correct header redirection is really small: as you
know it is just a hyphen handling.

The whole QGIS Help system has impressively improved and we should try
to find a way to better linking dev and doc writer jobs.

Maybe we can have a session on this in Madeira

Thanks

Matteo

Hi Hugo

Let me join the others in thanking you for working on this. Are we on a trajectory where we can reduce the rather complex setup process down to a script or similar that will produce a working compilation environment? That would be a really great outcome and help build a critical mass of developers who can work on QGIS on windows and debug windows specific issues.

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <3789704b-96c3-6b2b-514e-aa5f4959bcf5@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

Processing dialogs have no more the Help tab. If you create a model, as
for QGIS 2, you can add a short guide for the model.

The short description appears correctly in the right side of the dialog
while the single parameter description seems not available anymore (it
was in the Help tab).

Am I missing some step?

Thanks

Matteo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New Processing Help System summary
Message-ID: <4dfa6cc8-e67b-302d-8be2-7114142d1c06@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm writing here a brief summary of the current situation of the
Processing Help system.

Currently all the QGIS algorithms have been described and all the PR in
the doc repository have been merged (kudos to Harrissou for all the
reviews!).

Right now the Help button of each Processing dialog will open the
related page of the algorithm, BUT:

* if the name of the algorithm is made by only ONE word (e.g. clip,
intersection...), the help button will open the browser to also the
correct section (that is, the user will see directly th description of
the related algorithm)
* if the name of the algorithm has >1 words (e.g. split polygon with
lines, lines to polygon, ecc.) the Help button will open the correct
page (so the algorithm GROUP) but is not able to go to the correct
algorithm anchor. This is because sphinx converts "split with lines" in
"split-with-lines" while QGIS system will always cast the words
"split-with-lines" in "splitwithlines". Not a big deal, but IMHO a pity.
We are really too close to the solution.

So Processing Help system right now consists i:

* QGIS algs -> documented
* GDAL algs -> documented
* GRASS -> documented (own docs)
* Orfeo -> documented (own docs)
* SAGA -> nothing documented

Thanks to QGIS Grants to provide this chance to give a big improvement
to the Processing framework even if not in a coding way.

Cheers

Matteo

Agreed, your approach sounds reasonable to me.
Do you have a specific proposal? This could be a reasonable topic for a
next QGIS Grant.
All the best.

Hi Paolo

Thanks Paolo but i'm not sure this deserves PSC intervention. These are not big/blocker issues and reviewing these PRs can be part of the normal process of review: someone finding time to look after. 
It was simply a gentle reminder as i feel they were unnoticed/forgotten.

I can work on some of them during next week as part of the
hackmeeting. I'll give higher priority to 3.x bugs.

Thanks so much for the summary Matteo, it is really nice to see a summary of the current status list this!

I hope soon someone van figure out how to document the SAGA processing tools!

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-ugLbJ1r712vRMjnuBQ0+1G11c8=i-8BQqrgtzU9--Mw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

If we don't move off Redmine in the near future (although I do a see a
GitLab/Github move inevitable) what sign in options do we have that we can
implement for our sites?  If we can't move off Redmine it would be nice if
we could make the sign in process for issues.qgis.org and plugins.qgis.org
a more pleasant one.

Is it possible to wire in Gtihub, Facebook, Google, and all those kinds of
providers into the site? If so what kind of work is required for that to
happen.

Forcing users to jump through too many hoops before even getting a login
does a disservice to those we want to keep happy and puts off a lot of new
users.  Looking at our contribution jump for the project is proof that
barrier to entry being low is a good thing.

Regards,
Nathan

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Call for possible vote on change to official
	plugin repo policy?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsipmM8PS-or1EUBbhx-Ea54EdBRTN1jsYBxd5h6aKEMfg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to raise the possibility of putting to vote changes to the
official plugin repository.

This is something which I've been mulling over for a long time now,
and having discussed with other members of the community I believe
that there is sufficient interest to at least put this out as a
possible vote. It's a difficult topic, yet I hope that we can keep
discussion civil, professional and impersonal. Certainly no offence is
intended here -- I'm just after the best outcome for our users.

Here's the proposal:

"Should the official QGIS plugin repository flag plugins which have
known serious issues, and hide these plugins from users unless a 'Show
plugins with known issues' checkbox is ticked?"

Here's the rationale behind this:

There's a number of known badly behaved QGIS plugins, which despite
long-standing, very serious bugs, the plugins still are widely
installed and recommended by lots of books/blogs/users/training
courses/etc (who are likely unaware of these issues). Stackexchange is
littered with users encountering issues with these plugins, and I'm
constantly encountering users with issues in their QGIS installs
during my consultancy and training which is caused by these plugins.

I believe we have a responsibility to our users here -- if we are
aware that a certain plugin causes serious issues, why are we making
it available to users to download easily through our official plugin
repository?

The fact is: if we had bugs in core QGIS code which caused serious
issues like loss of user data, made QGIS randomly crash or slow to a
crawl, caused inaccurate measurements, or incorrect map rendering,  we
would consider those extremely serious blocking bugs and do everything
in our power to fix them. Yet we have plugins which we know DO cause
issues like this, and we make them accessible to users to install with
a couple of clicks and no warning.

It's a tricky and delicate issue... I fully understand that
significant development time and costs have gone into these plugins,
and that there is significant visibility benefits for the companies
behind having those plugins in the official repo, but the truth is
that the seriousness of these issues has unfortunately caused tangible
harm to QGIS' reputation for some users.

This topic is bound to be compared to Apple's "walled garden" approach
to their app store, which (in MY opinion rightly) comes under much
criticism for restricting user freedom. However, the situation is
quite different here because we supply all the tools required for
developers to make their plugins installable in many different ways
outside the official repo. Developers can create custom repos, they
can reuse the plugin library code on their own server, and users can
easily install non-repo plugins via the new "install plugin from zip
file" option in 3.0. Hiding or removing a plugin from the official
repo does NOT equate to making this plugin unavailable for QGIS users.

So my proposal is that:
- if a plugin has known, serious issues we contact the plugin author
to notify them
- we add a flag to the plugin to indicate it has known issues
- these plugins are not shown by default - users must opt in via a
checkbox (much like the "show experimental" check box)
- if/when the plugin fixes the issues, the flag is removed

Like I said at the start of this email... I realise it's a delicate
matter. But I strongly believe that our responsibility here lies with
protecting our users, not solely our developers, and we should take
some action to do this. That's why I'd like this raised to a vote with
the whole voting community vs just having discussion amongst the

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Incorrect hidpi setting in 3.0 for OSX
Message-ID: <CAB28Asj+1tHR-d9nt=LUtePrK8LFBbJ+yLhsL+tz1dordMB03g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all (specifically OSX devs)

>From a few open bug reports we have against the OSX build of 3.0, I
gather that the OSX builds currently are not correctly handling hidpi
screens.

My understanding is that the builds are silently trying to scale the
UI by pixel doubling/scaling - it's resulting in bugs like
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18043,
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17773, and
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15984.

Does any OSX expert know why this is happening? I think the automatic
pixel scaling should be switched off - while master isn't perfect with
hidpi screens, it's usable and the benefits of the hidpi
canvas/composer outweigh the remaining issues.

Plus, I'd rather we use a single approach to hidpi scaling then have
to worry about separate code paths for OSX.

Thanks for your flexibility here!

What's the chance of getting this resolved before 3.0 final? If we
can't, can we please ifdef this out for 3.0 release and defer to 3.2?

Thanks for starting this thread Nyall.

Ian not sure if it's relates to the HiDPI changes that occurred recently
(e.g maptool cursors becoming small) but I've also noted that since Xmas
the canvas is very sluggish when panning and zooming on Macosx and burning
through many More CPU cycles than 2.18 for the same operations.

Cheers
Jeremy

I fully understand and support your concerns. Why not simply deprecating
these plugin? I have adopted this approach (much too rarely, trying not
to hurt authors too much) in the past, and I found it simple and
effective. Once issues are fixed, I simply remove the `deprecated` flag,
et voilà.
Not sure we need a vote for this, just establishing sensible guidelines
should be enough.
All the best.

it wuld be nice if the small but annoying issue about modules with names

I fully agree and I support Paolo in deprecating those plugins, until
they're not fixed.
I wouldn't even give the option to install plugins "with issues" from QGIS
side.
I would move the responsability on the developers and users to use them...

Should be.  There are plugins for redmine to do this (github at least; also
oauth) - but we didn't have enough time in Essen to get them to fly after the
migration and people wanted to start working on tickets - and this wasn't
revisited AFAIK after we put the new instance into production.

BTW osgeoids are not required for redmine - you can register directly, but for
uploading plugins you need one (and if you don't already have one the mantra;
which you get quickly if you use a mail address that suggest that it's real and
that you will not spam - for gmail.com, hotmail etc. we first try to establish
that the person is real - so that might take longer).  Recently we had two
redmine tickets issued by (a) spammer(s).

While I agree that the mantra could be a large enough obstacle to turn people
away from filing tickets (hence it's not used there), I don't think the same
applies for plugins.

Hi,

sorry if this does not apply to mac (I'm not a Mac user), but did you try
to experiment with the following environment variables?

QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR
QT_DEVICE_PIXEL_RATIO

the effect may be different with different Qt versions and platforms.

Redmine also has a REST-API (JSON & XML).  
Since github also has an API (and also hooks), you could also synchronize GitHub/GitLab issues with Redmine and vice-versa. 
All you'd need to do is add custom-field on the redmine issues, so you could determine which issues are already synchronized. 
Potentially add a custom-datetime-field "last_synchronized", if synchronization/updates should work both ways.
Then you can add a service/daemon to hourly run over all redmine issues and synchronize them to github. 
And then pull all github issues and feed them into redmine. 
If you could store the redmine-issue-id into a github issue, that should be fairly simple. 
Via hooks you might also be capable of live-synchronizing github issues as they are created. 

That way you could receive issues via github, and still only have to look at redmine. 
I've worked with redmine in the past, and redmine has web-service support for custom-fields. 

The only question would be if the github-api provides custom fields ?

 Hi,

I'm considering renaming OSM Tools
<https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/OSMtools/> to ORS Tools for QGIS 3.
Mostly because the provided functionality didn't turn out to use other OSM
API's than ORS, but also to maintain consistency with Github (where the
repo is called ORStools).

Will QGIS 3 use a different plugin repository, i.e. restart all stats and
versions from scratch? If so, it'd make a case to use the chance for the
renaming. Else, I'll rename my Github repo..

Many thanks
Nils

Message-ID: <2E885BB293AF0448A0181138489E9A0EAEC3C82C@S000014.PROD.SITAD.DK>

Dear QGIS developers,

As some of you may know, a new version of the PROJ library is about to be released. At the moment we are on release candidate 3 [0].
It is very likely that this release candidate will be promoted to the final release. Before that happens though, I want to make sure
that we are not breaking the interface to QGIS. I don't expect this to happen but since the internals of the library has undergone
major surgery some testing of this is warranted. Especially in QGIS which is too important to not work with a new major release of
PROJ.

So, has anyone from the dev team successfully build QGIS against the current release candidate? And if not, would someone be
willing to spend a bit of time testing if everything works as expected? I know this is a bad time since everybody is busy with
QGIS3, but nonetheless a quick check confirming that the new major versions of both QGIS an PROJ works together will be good
for both projects.

Thanks in advance,
Kristian

Hi all,

This always sounded very obscure to me...
Alessandro, can you recommend any value to test?

It's rather obscure to me too :)

For Qt 5.10 on Linux I use

QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR to 0
QT_DEVICE_PIXEL_RATIO to 1


but on the same machine and display with Qt 5.9.3 I need to use

QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR to 1
QT_DEVICE_PIXEL_RATIO to 2


in order to have the same effect, that is the SVG icons are not pixelated
neither are the Qt GUI elements (like checkboxes) which are actually too
small.


If I set QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR to 1 QT_DEVICE_PIXEL_RATIO to 2 on
5.10 I get the correct size for the Qt GUI elements but I get pixelated SVG
icons.


I've not yet found the perfect solution.

Jürgen was quick to update the OSGeo4W packages and I have now confirmed myself that on the surface everything seems to function as expected. So thanks to Jürgen for updating the packages so quickly!

One minor thing I discovered was that the "About QGIS” dialog lists the version number as 4.9.3 instead of 5.0.0. Additionally it says “PROJ.4 Version”, which in the future should instead simply be “PROJ Version” as per the release notes for the upcoming release [0]. I haven’t looked into how the text in the dialog is added, but in case it is hard-coded the PROJ version number is defined as PJ_VERSION in proj_api.h, or can be retrieved with the proj_info() function in the new proj.h API.

If proj 4 had that option, it would already be there - for proj 5 the version
it was built against (PJ_VERSION) and the version it's running with (proj_info)
is shown now (obviously only when QGIS is build against proj 5 or above).

Of course, yes. The problem will sort itself out eventually then.

Thanks again, Jürgen, for adding the PROJ RC3-testing OSGeo4W package!

Hi

I think we just need to be careful if we are deprecating a plugin that we have a really solid chain of evidence as to why it is deprecated and a clear roadmap that people can follow if they want to appeal deprecation. Wither way I think putting it to a vote would be a good idea.

Regards

I think this whole thing is a mess :P

I believe the correct  solution (on QGIS side) is to use a device
pixel ratio of 1, i.e. a pixel is a pixel and don't do any tricks to
try to automatically handle this. And then we should avoid all
hardcoded pixel sizes and just use sizes relative to font metrics.
Which is what we've done a lot of for 3.0, but there's still work to
do.

I think the OSX builds are auto-setting the pixel ratio to 2 somewhere
(it's not in the qgis code -- so maybe it's in the homebrew package or
something. I dunno... the mess which is OSX package repos makes even
npm look stable and a joy to use by comparison).

What I can't work out is why Qt widgets themselves badly handle hidpi
screens. E.g. a QDockWidget on hidpi has a TINY close button. I think
that needs fixing in Qt itself though, and until they do we just learn
to squint... but we DON'T try to hack around it using the pixel ratio
settings.

I also can't work out how to automatically scale layout
padding/margins by font metrics. It seems a huge endeavour to manually
set all these... yet without doing so the layouts on hidpi look very
cramped because widgets a smooshed up against each other with barely
any padding.

Bah. I wish my laptop could run natively in a low dpi mode with the
correct aspect ratio. I'd just do that until Qt gets its mess sorted
out.

I don't think this is a good idea - it means we have code in master
which will need updating if the help files are edited and the
algorithm headings tweaked. That'll get quite messy when different
versions/branches are involved (both on the qgis and documentation
side).

I'd rather a fix on the documentation side which uses the invisible
link anchor matching the algorithm id - which is fixed and guaranteed
not to change. Weren't earlier experiments for this approach
successful?

I agree. Adding sphinx anchors should be enough. Unless there are
algorithms from different providers usinf the same identifier, because in
sphinx we cannot have duplicated anchor's names.

I understand the intention of this. We don't want QGIS getting the blame
because of third party plugin not working correctly. I just wanted to point
that we might be adding too many tags, which may confuse the users. We
already have the following tags: experimental, deprecated, trusted.

My other concern is about the process to determine which plugins must be
flagged as having issues (I actually have the same concerns with the
"trusted" tag). It must be clear to everyone who writes a plugins how that
is done.

I'm maybe not the best person to answer this, but I install QGIS3 from brew
and don't see any specific configuration or build time settings for the
QGIS brew formulae [1] or the QT5 formulae [2]. Also there is nothing
specific in the Info.plist app bundle and there is no specific qt.conf file
to set options are described in http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/highdpi.html.

Is there a API I can call in the QGIS python console to see the pixel ratio
used by QT?

Cheers,
Jeremy

What you call "low dpi" really isn't that low, and you might want to test
true "low dpi" setups as well as the "high dpi".
I have an arch linux box connected to my TV which IIRC is about 21DPI.
I haven't been able to build QGIS master on that machine, but I gave up on
trying to get other QT5 programs to render properly - using qt5ct I can
almost get them to work, but some widgets and text are microscopic.
FWIW QT5 isn't alone with its problems - if I set the dpi correctly (which
also requires using extremely large fonts) there are also major problems with
programs like Libreoffice and Opera and Seamonkey if it is using GTK3 -
i.e. some  widgets and fonts are microscopic or giant.

Hi,

While on Madeira Hackfest it can be helpfull to have a common public
'chat' environment to share where you are, or what to do...

Because we already have

https://gitter.im/qgis/QGIS

for real QGIS discussions and messages,

I now have (temporarily??) created a room:

https://gitter.im/qgis/hackfest

which can be used for messages like: 'Hi Guys, in which bar are you at
this moment???' or 'I just eat in xxx the best Madeira Kangaroo-steak
ever'...

So to be clear: keep the normal QGIS discussions on /QGIS, but the
practical stuff in /hackfest

It is an open room, so just hop in.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hello,

Sorry for the misunderstanding about my last mail, I didn't want to
be disrespectful. I would like to continue the discussion about this
contribution.

We will push this contribution and try to answer to all
questions, comments or issues about it. We will submit with my colleagues in
few days the QEP to have a strong basis for the discussion about this PR.
Thanks for setting up discussion on external providers at QGIS developer meeting. 
I had also registered to this discussion in github page.
I hope that we can continue to work together in a constructive spirit on this issue.

We initially had a request to setup such an infrastructure for a
customer. And we also used it internally to allow the distribution of
binaries, either for some private applications or for some local
branches of QGIS, so that we can exchange with our customer about a
feature before proposing a pull request.

We then thought it could be a good idea to integrate it somehow with the
main distribution.

Thanks !
Yes this is the idea. We are trying to reduce as much as possible the
manual steps involved in preparing a Windows box for the compilation of
an OSGeo4W distribution.

However it is designed with the idea of having a common environment for
the compilation of all the OSGeo4W packages. So it will setup lots of
things that may or may not be necessary for the compilation of an
isolated package (even if this not a "small" package like QGIS).

Hopefully on a longer term, we will find a way to have different
environment profiles (which seems to be a native concept in Ansible).

How do you control the order of your algorithms in a group in a qgis
processing plugin?

    def createAlgsList(self):
        self.alglist = [
            Test1GeoAlgorithm(u'Test1', u'Group1'),
            Test2GeoAlgorithm(u'Test2', u'Group1'),
            Test3GeoAlgorithm(u'Test3', u'Group1'),
            Test4GeoAlgorithm(u'Test4', u'Group1')]

In the processing toolbox gui the menu items end up in a random order - and
not the order of the alglist?

Thanks
Jakob

Hi Jakob,

you can not contol order of the items in the Toolbox. Items in the
toolbox sorted
in alphabetical order.

Maybe sorting is done in English and the translation is applied later on?

AFAICR, they are sorted randomly if you load (or reload) your plugin during a QGIS 
session. After QGIS restart (when the algorithms are loaded during the startup), they will 
be sorted alphabetically.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3.0 Sluggish on MacOS 10.13 with Retina
	Display
Message-ID: <CAA5WJYmT=XHTFikCeqtQ=OBDEtgaSGgDTh_q3CJ0hJLfhz6O5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

For some time I've been noticing that QGIS 3.0 on MacOSX has sluggish
canvas redraw speeds. When comparing between QGIS 2.18 and 3.0 I see ~4x
more CPU activity in 3.0 when performing the same set of operations on the
same dataset.

My test case was using a single raster VRT with overviews, and zooming in
and panning around the map cavnas for 20 sec. On average each time I tested
this case the total used CPU time for 2.18 was about 6 secs, but in
3.0dev-64369f8099 (complied against QT 5.10.0 with homebrew) I get total
CPU time of 25 secs. In QGIS 3.0 most of the time the application is using
100% CPU (one core) and spikes to about 180-200% CPU when the canvas
redraws are performed. When using a profiler it seems much of the time is
taken up in QImage::copy(QRect const&) within two seperate, but equivalent,
call subtrees. See [1] for more info.

Is anyone else seeing slow map canvas performance in QGIS 3.0 on MacOSX?

Cheers,
Jeremy

There's not much to go on in that stack - it's all Qt internals.

Are you sure this isn't solely due to the fact that QGIS is painting
so many more pixels? I'd like to see a test where you force a low dpi
resolution for both 2.18 and 3.0.

What would be the best way to force low dpi?

Message-ID: <CACPZzQ23p8WTZSXzb+aQyp=ysX0_tBHLR5tAnYZBT+bAboNFmg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would suggest to add to the documentation the QgisInterface
https://qgis.org/api/classQgisInterface.html mentioning it's only available
when doing plugins as it would be annoying to go back and forth between C++
and Python API just for this.

Waiting for feedback. If Ok, then I will open a ticket to ask for the
improvement. I'm also wondering if there is a category for PyQGIS API
documentation?


Cheers

Message-ID: <CA+4D_vNPU3Pgbe51jvhQsnFNcie9V-SAJyO2qmsgwa3EPHB4cw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello -

I just saw a post from Tim Sutton regarding the Developer Meeting [1]
starting tomorrow. Will the sessions that have zoom meeting links be
recorded and made available to watch later?

I am a daily user of QGIS and would love to figure out a way to contribute
back to the project.

Being able to watch the mentored sessions regarding setting up a
development environment, reporting/validating bugs, and writing tests would
be exciting to see.

Regardless, I hope that the event goes well this week!

Thanks,
Matt

In https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6399 I implement a advanced
settings option, "tools\showDuplicateFeatureActions" to control
whether these actions are shown. By default it's off, but interested
organisations can set the flag in their qgis_global_settings.ini to
show these actions.

I think that's a fair approach - it means that users/organisations
which require this feature can still use it in 3.0, whilst at the same
time avoiding exposing the functionality to users by default until it
is refined.

I'm just saying that there's nothing QGIS specific there - so there's
no clues there wherever it's a generic Qt issue or a QGIS regression.

I'm not familiar with OSX - can you set the monitor resolution
manually? something like 1280 x 800 would be a good test.

That sounds like a good technical solution.

But (like others have raised) I think we need a clear policy here so
that there's no misunderstanding or developers feeling like they're
"targeted". That's why I think we need a strong policy, voted in by
the voting community, so that there's NO chance that anyone can claim
that this is being abused.

What's the next step here? I'd very much like to see this continue
moving forward promptly.

so, we agree that simply deprecating a plugin is the way to go, right?

as plugin manager, I'd appreciate this enormously; I wish there was a
clear policy, with no room for interpretation. Having >= 1 ticket marked
as critical could be one, but this just moves decisions one step ahead.
Do you have a practic proposal?

IMHO we can agree on a solution without the need for a vote. In any
case, I'm sure PSC could ratify any sensible decision that comes out of
this discussion.

All the best.

Can you clarify here if the ticket should be in QGIS tracker or in plugin repo tracker? What is to stop them just chasing the ticket state and then asking for a release?

Yes I do plan to record them and put them on YouTube if there are no hitches.

Hi All

NOTICE: ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WORKING ON THE CHANGELOG AT THE HACKFEST...

We are going to push out some changes to the live changelog site this afternoon - the site will be unavailable (hopefully just for a few minutes) while I do the upgrade.

The upgrade will happen at 12h45 Madeira time, 14h45 South Africa time, 13h45 CET time.

I will post another notice here when the upgrade is complete.

Regards

I confirm, I meant in the bugtracker of each individual plugin.

This is exactly what I meant with "move decisions one step ahead".
Sorry for being unclear.

In short, what we need is a clear criterion for deprecation, with as
little subjectivity as possible. I would welcome any suggestion on this.

All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Future of Processing algs Help panel
Message-ID: <CAECJsSomj8VbLbNdfQKWwAvT3mTwN3ECezGSoU8ZVC8CxR-EuA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Now that all the algorithms are documented in the User manual I'd like to
raise discussion on the status of the Help panel shown in algorithm dialog.
Depending on the algs (I'm here talking only about QGIS algorithms), we
have different status:
- provides an uptodate help
- provides a outdated description or a not really clear one (at least to
the non native speaker i am)
- no help panel.

I think this panel has to be there. It's a first good overview for the
user, allowing him/her to decide whether this alg could be pertinent or
not. If (s)he needs more details then the Help button for parameters
documentation is there. But it'd be better if it was available for all
algs, with an uptodate description (and it would help users with low
Internet, avoiding check in User manual).

This description is now written and available in Docs repo. What could be
the next step?

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi Rashad

Thanks so much for your email below….sometimes things are not always easy to figure out, especially as QGIS gets bigger and more complex. We will really value your contribution as we move forward … and we will try to come up with a solution that works well for everyone.

Best regards

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Concerns re UX of new "duplicate features"
 actions in 2.99
Message-ID: <1519224931-e87b25e221e03f8497e74dd0e2b1e8a2@opengis.ch>


Hi Nyall  
  
I'll start with it today. So possibly it's done before the 23th.  
  
We could keep it as an Action, only enabled when the layer is editable.  
This would include an attribute of MapLayerAction, if it should be enabled only in editable mode or always (first case for the duplication-action). The user actions would need such a attribute as well.   
Probably we could integrate this attribute as another scope-value, and use the scopes as well for the MapLayerActions.  
Then we need to decide on what scopes it should be displayed:  
- Canvas (in the main toolbar)  
- Layer (in the toolbar of attribute list)  
- Feature (in the actions of attribute form, right click on a feature in the form view, right click on the feature on canvas)  
- Field (right click on a field in row of attribute table, right click on field at identify result panel)  
  
What do you think?  
  
Thanks for the ini-configuration anyway. Probably we will need it as well.   
  
Regards  
David

Hi devs,
   I am using an object derived by QgsMapTool class (python, qgis 2.18 on window).
I need to use the keyPressEvent function of QgsMapTool.
I cannot receive any event if I press some keys for example “a”, “c”, “d”, “p”, “x”, “y” keys.
The other keys works fine.
Is there anybody who can help me ?

Thank you

Message-ID: <7CCEF44D1C42854999B19B1EB27281F60128E73FE5@SR2ORBHQ2K803.angus.gov.uk>

Hi List

This issue (https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15132) refers to using the @symbol_color function to make the outline of graduated/categorised features the same colour as the fill.  There is a fix by Nyall from over a year ago but I wonder if there has been a regression?

I am using both the latest 2.99 master and 2.18.16 64-bit versions on Windows 7 and if I render a polygon layer using the categorised or graduated renderer and set the outline colour using @symbol_color then the legend doesn't reflect the style shown on the map. The features are rendered correctly (I like using "darker(@symbol_color,150)") on the map canvas and the print composer but the legend in the table of contents and on the composer layout show the default outline colour.

The only way I can get the legend to update is to set the outline/stroke colour to the fill colour for each category and then make it slightly darker - not too much of a hassle if there are a few but a hassle if there are more than that.

Can anyone else confirm this?  And has there been a regression or was the fix for something slightly different?

Thanks in advance

Thanks for the update! Just wondering, is there a way to add a new category
in the changelog? I thought all 3D-related features could get a dedicated
category, but I can't see a way how to add a category in the web
interface...

Cheers
Martin

Just added '3D Features/3d-features' as category.

I'm using xcode's instruments, but I've never really developed in any code
on MacOSX before. I will see what else can be dumped.

I set the screen scale to 1280 x 800. It made some improvement in speed,
but QGIS 3.0 still is running much slower than 2.18.

I also tried enabling the Low Resolution mode for the app bundle as per
[1]. This setting forces the device pixel ratio to 1 from 2 for HiDPI
supported applications. e.g
qgis.utils.iface.mainWindow().devicePixelRatio() = 1. This of course forces
the UI to low resolution and reverses all of the QGIS 3.0 SVG icons work :( The
results were:

1. The QGIS 3.0 mapcanvas UI interactions seemed smoother due to the
increased frame-rate for redrawing the zoom rubberband box or moving the
the cursor.
2. But, the canvas redraws were still just and slow as a device pixel ratio
of 1. i.e The profiling still showed the same amount of CPU time

Here's the results of my benchmarking:

[image: Inline image 1]

Note: canvas size was determined using qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().size()

Before I proceed with further profiling it would be good to know if other
mac developers also see performance slowdowns like I do?

Cheers,
Jeremy

 actions in 2.99

Hi Dave, hi Nyall,

Thanks for all your thoughts and work on this. The approach that is
currently being developed sounds like a very reasonable one given the
remaining time for 3.0.


Another idea I had to handle things like this was an "activate
condition" for actions. The activate condition for the duplicate feature
action could be a simple `@layer_editable`.

The tricky thing is, that variables (or even expression functions) used
within such a construct will need to be notifiable (e.g. here upon layer
edit state change, but in theory it could depend on other things like
`selected_feature_count(@layer) > 2`), so the expression engine knows
when an expression needs to be re-evaluated.

It will be a non-trivial thing to do and I'm not yet convinced it's
worth it, but I could imagine that we find other areas in QGIS where
such an interactive machinery to enable button states or change labels
interactively based on expressions can come in handy.

Enjoy Madeira, I miss you all !!

Matthias

In the meantime, I'd like to merge that PR. 3.0 is only a couple of
hours away and it makes me very nervous having this feature exposed
still. Can I merge, and then we can address whether to remove the flag
when the changes have landed?

I don't know enough about it myself, I only followed this topic marginally.

It would be good to get the green flag for it from Dave and Andreas if
somehow possible.

Yes, ideally... but also (with full respect to all involved), in its
current form this feature is just too dangerous to have in the
release. I would not feel comfortable at all in rolling out 3.0 in my
customer's organizations with the knowledge that a single accidental
slip of the mouse can permanently damage a non-editable layer.

That's why I would greatly prefer to hide it now, and then un-hide if
the issues are resolved before release.

"Better safe than sorry" and all that :)

Hiding the action everywhere when a layer is non-editable is a good
move. I'd also like to see it completely removed (regardless of
editable status) from:

1. The identify results right click menu and results tree view (I
think that all actions with a "only show in editable mode" flag should
be skipped from these places - the identify tool is typically a "view"
tool, not an edit tool)
2. The menu bar in the attribute form dialog (at least for newly
created features)

Thanks for your responsiveness on this!

Hi Nyall  
  
It's okay for me, when you merge it to be save and we remove it, when the issue is resolved.  
  
But I'll remove the part that the duplicate functions toggles the edit mode anyway.   
So in case there will be still the action to duplicate on a not editable layer somewhere (what it shouldn't) it won't damage the layer.  
  
Thanks and regards  
Dave

Message-ID: <CAGZtxQxToTEwUEhFhP7e82pFBJLFhOyxSnmCv1Q+qb13RDj8bg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

As per the discussion of this bug report:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17990, could a text be added to this
changelog entry:
http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.0.0/#improved-handling-of-defaults
?

For example: "This also means that, after certain editing operations
(e.g. copy-paste, split features etc.) attributes will now be set to
their default value, if applicable."

Kind regards,

Daan Goedkoop

Hi Daan,

You should be able to create an account on changelog.qgis.org and then edit
the entry. Then it will go in the pending queue for a review.

Contributions on the changelog are more than welcome, there is a lot of
work to do ;-)
Thanks for your contribution.

Regards,
Etienne

Hello Etienne,

I've tried it now, but after clicking Submit I got an error about "too
many redirects" and now I can't see the entry anymore at all. Strange.

Hi Daan,

I see that dgoedkoop as a valid user.

Are you logged in?

Can you try again and report back?

I think it has something to do with rights for normal users.

With my (admin) account I can go to:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/3.0.0/pending-entry/list/

And see a list.

BUT if I am a normal user (I added a second normal username for myself),
if I try that url, I am being redirected to:

http://changelog.qgis.org/accounts/login/?next=/en/qgis/3.0.0/pending-entry/list/

Which gives the too many redirects error.

Apparently a normal user does not have rights to see/edit the pending
entries? Is being redirected to the login page (WITH a note that after
login he will be sent to next=/en/qgis/3.0.0/pending-entry/list/
And there something seems smelly...

Regards,

Richard

Hi

So as Richard says, changed entries go into a moderation queue which a changelog manager must approve. I approved your defaults handling entry after tidying it up a bit.

Can you please file a ticket if you encounter any issues in the changelog manager here:

https://github.com/kartoza/projecta/issues <https://github.com/kartoza/projecta/issues>

We will fix them ASAP.

I will take a look at why the redirect is not working properly.

Regards

Tim

Yes, I could replicate the issue. After sending the request, the form
redirects to the pending queue, but a normal login doesn't have permission.
I have a fix in my local, I will deploy asap.
Sorry for that

beforeCommit signal and managing edit buffer before real commit can be
a solution?

another is to modify the edit buffer attaching to the featureDeleted signal...

do you need a beforeDelete signal?

Hi,

When working on the visual changelog, I noticed that the "make_triangle" 
expression function help is missing.

Could the original developer of this expression function please add this 
missing function?

Thanks a lot!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Expression category question
Message-ID: <a5f22c79-8d84-6847-a55c-d24dff8faf96@carto.net>

Hi,

I noticed that some expressions could belong to multiple categories:

One such example is collect(expression, group_by, filter)

Returns the multipart geometry of aggregated geometries from an expression.

For now, it resides in the "Aggregates" category, but just as well it 
could reside in the "Geometry" category. Most likely, there are other 
expression functions that might reside in multiple categories.

Question: should we in the future allow that an expression belongs to 
multiple categories?

Andreas

Hi all,
I'm doing the second option (same mail to all).
Let's hope that the buzz around Q3 release will help getting an
effecting response.
All the best.

Hello all,

There were some issue in this PR which made me stop on this task. sorry
for trouble and I would like to resume this integration to QGIS.

most issues raised by core developers has been explained now. I had
provided some code snippets to explain how processing providers can
use this change in their code.

Could someone check this and let us know status?

congrats on QGIS3 && thanks in advance,

Hi all again,
on a second thought, I believe it is better to send it when the package
is available at least for Windows, so users can test against 3.0.
All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Future of external Processing providers in QGIS
Message-ID: <764db61a-c91f-8149-91d4-fb42df2d6c65@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
meeting has just ended. I must say it was a very interesting and
productive discussion. We are really grateful for the developers from
GRASS, SAGA and OTB for their contributions to our discussion.
I recap briefly here what I believe are the most important outcomes:
* we'll keep SAGA and GRASS Processing providers
* we'll try to update SAGA provider to the next LTR when this will be
available
* we invite OTB team to add their work to QGIS core, granting them write
access if they wish
* for OTB provider, considering that OTB binaries are not part of the
installer on Windows, we suggest this approach: OTB provider checks
whether OTB is installed, if not it suggests the user to install it, if
the user does not the provider hides itself
* While we have granted an exception to the ‘processing providers should
not be in core’ for the short term, our longer term plan is to put in
place mechanisms to ‘side load’ the dependencies (GRASS, OTB, SAGA).
When this capability is implemented, we will mandate that all providers
will be provided as plugins and then fetch these plugins on demand if an
algorithm references them
* we will not accept new providers, unless some very strict and
exceptional conditions apply (TBD; e.g. new backend of high quality and
general usage)
* for future versions we will consider moving providers to the XML
approach where appropriate, as it appears more maintainable, even at the
expense of flexibility in interface tuning; GRASS is the next candidate,
noting that this might require some modifications in GRASS core
* as a first step in we ask anybody to test thoroughly the new SAGA
provider by Alex Bruy
https://github.com/alexbruy/processing-saga
also a check from SAGA, GRASS, and OTB devs would be important, to check
whether this approach is the preferred one from all sides.
Please add if I missed something.
Overall, I think we have now a brighter future for Processing, and as a
consequence for QGIS, SAGA, GRASS and OTB altogether.
* If you want to watch the complete discussion, please be patient; video
is being uploaded.
All the best, and thanks again.

Message-ID: <7fa28cd2-4641-8b63-2100-598c0b3935fd@gmail.com>

Good evening (here)

I had Qgis 2.99 crash and it left the shape file data with three of the 
data files that make up the shapefile, with _packed in their name.

Although renaming the files got the data back, the value maps and 
default values for new features for this layer have disappeared.

Is there a particular file that stores this data for the layer (before I 
decide whether this could be a bug or not)?

Thanks

It would seem this data is stored in the project file?

Given I can't produce a corrupted project file (I can only produce the 
files for the affected laye) is there any point in filing a bug for this.

What platform are you running on? Which GDAL version?

If I recall correctly this was fixed in GDAL around 6-12 months ago.

If someone wants to replicate:
====================================================================
-- create an empty table
CREATE TABLE public.test_raster
(
  rid integer,
  rast raster,
  CONSTRAINT enforce_height_rast CHECK (st_height(rast) = ANY
(ARRAY[100, 24])),
  CONSTRAINT enforce_width_rast CHECK (st_width(rast) = ANY (ARRAY[100,
24])),
  CONSTRAINT enforce_srid_rast CHECK (st_srid(rast) = 4326)
);

-- create an empty raster
INSERT INTO test_raster(rid,rast)
VALUES(1, ST_MakeEmptyRaster( 100, 100, 0.0005, 0.0005, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4326) );

Hi,

Same here. The raster loads, but it ask again for the login credentials.

Maybe this is related with the authentication configurations, but I have
no idea.

I confirm the issue.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing doc - sphinx - anchors
Message-ID: <1173835b-ecfa-503f-e89f-3a6d81950366@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

for those of you that followed the discussion you know we have some
issues with the sphinx anchors and the name of the algorithms in the
code if the name of the algorithm has more than one word (e.g. count
point in polygon)

We were able to manage it by putting an anchor with the exact name of
the algorithm (e.g. `.. _countpointsinpolygon): this creates a span tag
in the html that behaves like an anchor.

Future issues will appear if we have the same anchor name for different
algorithm, e.g. slope of GDAL and slope of QGIS. Sphinx does not accept
2 anchor with the same name, even if in different files.

One proposal would be to change the name of the algorithm in the code
and put the name of the provider before the name of the algorithm:

`gdalslope` vs `qgisslope`

then we are sure to have unique algorithm names.

Feedback are very welcome, but I think this should be fixed (of course
also in other way, maybe sphinx side?)

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Matteo,

well, previously it worked in the exactly this way, link was created
using algorithm id which eventually is a concatenation of the provider
name and algorithm name. But on requrest from documentation team
this behaviour was changed to current approach.

So now you want to go back to links like this

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectoroverlay.html#qgisintersection

Is this correct? Just want to clarify before implemeting it to avoid yet another
round of discussions and "fixing".

according with Richard, we think that having the link

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectoroverlay.html#qgisintersection

so provider name concatenated with algorithm name is the way to go. To
avoid any other future issues with hyphens vs underscores etc I think it
is smart to have a single string like `qgiscountpointsinpolygon` instead
of `qgis_countpointsinpolygon`.

This way the name of the algorithm should be always unique even among
providers.

I'm sorry that we did not face these issues before, but nobody thought
we can have this sphinx troubles with anchors.


Thanks Alex for taking care of this

Matteo

right now?

yes please! would be great to have for the 3.0.1!

I found also another small small issue with just the GDAL Help button
and I reported it here:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18198#change-87424

it might be a really small issue.


Many thanks Alex

Hi Patrick,

You are correct, this data is stored in the project file. If the project
hasn't been saved prior to the crash, this configuration is lost.

There is definitely a good reason to report an issue, because the app
crashed. Please provide as much information as possible that can help as
a lead why this happened (a backtrace of the crash being the most useful
one; and an exact description of at what point and after what actions it
happened being inevitable).

To avoid loss of work, there is an autosaver plugin
(https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/autoSaver/) that regularly saves the
project configuration. I'm not sure it's updated to QGIS 3 yet.

Regards

Matthias

Hi devs,

I opened a PR on the doc repo some time ago

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/2261

the idea is to have a comparison between the done vs todo tests of
Processing. IMHO this could help advanced users to pick up some missing
algorithm and make tests.

Feedback are welcome!

Here we go.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/598b8a9c41e3788962778039adcc30f2912d822f
Currently only for master, not sure if it is safe to push to
release-3_0 right now.
Will backport it a bit later.

Help link now looks like
https://docs.qgis.org/3.1/uk/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/interpolation.html#qgisidwinterpolation

Hope this solves your issues.

thanks Alex, I'm testing it and it looks great.

I saw a small drawback when the provider is `native` and not `qgis`. For
the moment I'll change all the anchors to the correct provider (e.g.
`nativepackage`, `qgisimporttospatialite`). Do you think that it would
be smart to rename native to qgis automatically?

Cheers

Matteo

yes that's right, but with was for groups and not single algorithm
names. With your fix of some hour ago the link of native algorithm looks
like:

https://docs.qgis.org/3.1/uk/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/interpolation.html#nativepackage

and not

https://docs.qgis.org/3.1/uk/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/interpolation.html#qgispackage

but that's alright. I'm changing the names manually. So I'll leave this
as it is and I think we really need to add a chapter to the
documentation guidelines for Processing (I'll do that).

Thanks

Hi,

while QGIS algorithm, despite all the anchors issues we are solving,
some GDAL button links to the GDAL page and not to the QGIS page. I
found these:

* Clip raster by extent
* both algorithm in "Vector conversion"
* all algorithms in "Vector geoprocessing"
* Import vector in PostGIS database

I think all of them should point to QGIS webpage and there we can add
links for gdal official documentation

Cheers

Hi All,

I am looking at

but cannot find "the appropriate network installer (32 or 64 bit) for

(I still can only get v2.99)

Does anyone have a link for me?

Thanks & regards,

Nope, packaging & packagers still busy...

Have an eye on qgis.org, we will update site when packages are available.

Message-ID: <CAJEy1xXcD3SbyK0uxNXaoPYBMe_sJU1_9Zb9wyPWqYDbx_ug+w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear community,

we are QGIS (GIS) teachers at the University of Presov (Eastern Slovakia).
We are Open Source fans and now we have become a great opportunity from
World Bank which wants to help us to create a GIS department based on Open
Source GIS technologies and Open Spatial Data Infrastructure in Presov
Self-governing Region (NUTS 3; 600,000 inhabitans).

At the moment we are creating a team and searching people who have
experience with the deployment of this kind of infrastructure in regional
self-government. We need people who help us with the implementation and
training of our staff. Project is funding by World Bank.

Gidday all

According to the download web page I should be able to install 2.18.17 
or later using the https://qgis.org/debian-nightly-release repository.

However at the moment these repos don't appear to contain packages later 
than 2.18.16, for any platform like stretch, unstable or bionic

The roadmap says 17 should be imminent so is it just delayed a little?

Well, packaging takes some time (according to Juergen Debian
test/build/packaging without errors is 24 hours), it is weekend, some
builds had (test) problems, packagers are volunteers too, etc etc :-)

Future is near, but sometimes takes some time...

Hi devs,

thanks to Alex work we have know solid anchors and url for Processing

BUT, it seems that when the help button is clicked within the Processing

Wrong from modeler:

vs correct from Processing toolbox:

Message-ID: <88450360-354e-bbe7-06d1-47dd3d062faf@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Just heard from Regis that we have have this beautiful Ctrl-Tab, which
hides the west, south and east panel from QGIS to have a clean map.

My question is what the reason is to not hide the toolbars.
Was it too difficult because you have to remember all active toolbars?
OR was it because the idea is that users still have to be able to reach
the toolbuttons?

Because if it is the latter, I would ask a feature request: maybe
Shift-Ctrl_Tab to also have the toolbars hidden :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I've noticed on Mac the shortcut is actually fn+cmd+tab. I guess that is
because on Mac cmd+tab brings up the application switcher. Would be nice to
change this to ctrl+tab like windows and LINUX.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Vector tiles
Message-ID: <1519643680759-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

Congratulations to everyone for an amazing release. Massive.

Now looking forward, are vector tiles under consideration in the future?
There is a plugin for 2.x which has been partially migrated to 3 (as I
understand it). However, Even also announced on gdal-dev that native OGR
support for MBVT was now implemented.

So, do we have any thoughts on timescale for upping GDAL/OGR to a release
which will include this new support? And what development is required in
QGIS beyond what OGR gives us?

Thanks

Tom

Message-ID: <b1ff16c137b8cf8cd0675a259b959fe6@carto.net>

Hi, 

We would like to see transaction support in QGIS 3x for geopackages. We
want to hand out geopackages and QGIS project files, for external
parties to edit data for us - without the need that the third-party has
PostgreSQL installed. The projects all use relations. 

Before we test ourselves, I thought it might make sense to ask what the
status or plans are for transaction support in Geopackages? 

Should it already be supported? If not - is someone planning to work on
it? 

Thanks for your replies, 

Andreas

Hi Radim,

All those wiki pages were in the old Redmine instance that we run on our
old server.

Because of spam troubles in that wiki, we decided to NOT create the wiki
in the new updated Redmine instance which we run on our current server.

If it is really important, we can resurrect pages for you from the
database dump that we have from the old Redmine.

Please let me know if you want that.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Andreas,
by transaction support, you mean "transaction group" support  ? The one
that allows to edit all the layers in one unique transaction and evaluate
triggers on the fly?

If not, I'm not sure to understand what is lacking currently for your use
case.

Nothing is planned here however.


Regards!

Hey all,

The changelog page for 3.2 is now active.  Would be good if we can start
adding entries as we make changes so we don't have to wait until right at
the end like 3 :)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Rasterization of a polygon
Message-ID: <B5DC5E504CA5244FAD46F7E6F536AB4B3131B79C@PEXMB400B.vu.local>


Dear QGIS developers,


I was having a shapefile of polygons with integer numbers between 0 and 33122 (33123 elements of long integers of arcgis). Then I was applying the rasterization function (raster>conversion>rasterize) and I was discovering that the numbers over the output raster were between 0 and 32767 plus other 354 clusters of cells with negative values (between 0 and -32768).

as is explained in this python documentation of;

https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/user/basics.types.htmlhttps://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/user/basics.types.html

the int16 arrays only can contain numbers between -32768 and 32767, reason why the cells of the polygons with numbers higher than 32767 were negative.

I was searching over the rasterization tool previously mentioned and there was no option to change the output format (to choose an int32 or higher format).

My question is: is there anyway to prevent this error?  Can it be possible to add this option over the tool rasterize in order that the user can choose which format will be the output?.

Thank you very much,


Andres Diaz
Fan of QGIS

Thanks Nathan,

good idea.

@allDevs: please add some (preliminary) text (and if possible picture
there there) for every new feature you code.

OR

In case of a new feature a new issue is automatically created here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues and tagged 'QGIS 3.2'
Please always add some information/screenies/hints for doc writers when
you add a new feature. It is MUCH more efficient if a doc writer can
take some text and rewrite it, then guessing what the new Feature was
and is forced  to ask the dev halve a year later...

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Régis, 

Yes - I mean the "transaction group" support. Meaning that multiple
layers can be edited together. Most important issue for us: ability to
link related tables to newly created features without asking the user to
manually save the parent table first. 

This all works for Postgis now, but I think not for Geopackages - right?


Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,
ok, that's clear. You are right, that feature is only for the postgreSQL
provider currently.

I didn't see any missing requirement in SQLITE v3 - the requirement for
GPKG - maybe Matthias knows more about that. We also use GDAL provider
here, so we might miss some features there and have to implement or fix
things upstream. We should check that with Even Rouault who implemented it
in GDAL 2.0 (see
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc54_dataset_transactions)

If we go that way, we should add it to spatialite too, but the state of the
provider could make it terribly hard to do, so I would set as a
prerequisite that we get rid of the current provider and rely on GDAL
only.

We  also have had hard time to consolidate some transactional glitches in
the PG provider with SQL syntax errors and failing transactions, I expect
even more work with SQLITE since it is less used and polished, and also
rely on GDAL in which we probably we have

Last point to note is that at OSLANDIA we have been using a lot SQLITE -
spatiaLITE to push some business logic in it (the thick database practice).
It revealed way more complex to write and maintain than in postgreSQL
because of SQLITE limitations. So complex that it finally revealed faster
to rewrite all the logic to PG, then package an embedded / no  install
postgreSQL application which is launched as a process when opening a QGIS
project. We called that PGLITE and is one of the reasons of getting
involved in OSGEO4W packaging to easily deploy that. It is very
experimental currently however. Just to say to porting the same application
made with PG to a offline / on field identical application is not easy at
all.

So if your use case is to have simple triggers, that would do, but if you
have complex procedures, developping that is not at all a straightforward
port from PG code.

That said, I would love to have that supported in QGIS!


Regards ,
Régis

Hi, +1 with Richard.
I spent some hours polishing the changelog on Sunday and the task is huge,
I'll try to continue tonight.

Maybe also we should explicit some tips:

- Use Markdown syntax for a more readable changelog
- Even is the feature is for developers, try to write something
understandable for non developpers
- Link to a more detailed resource (blog post, QEP, detailed PR) instead of
writing long entries
- Think also to ease the work of translators

Cheers !

Big +1 from me if we choose that route ^

That would make it easier to maintain the browser tree too and remove a lot
of code duplication.

Just a quick note, I think I will deploy some updates (and some fixes !) on
the changelog.qgis.org in 1 hour and 30 minutes. So don't edit around that
time. Thanks

>> that we get rid of the current provider and rely on GDAL only.

With the 'current provider' I assume you mean the Spatialite-Provider.

Please remember that the Spatialite-Provider was never designed to support
GeoPackage.

Please also remember that Gdal/Ogr does not support all aspects of
Spatialite
- writable SpatialViews are not supported

The present QgsOgrProvider does not support Spatialite-Tables with more
than 1 geometry properly.

'that we get rid of the current provider' would then mean for me (and no
doubt other) that Qgis would become fairly useless.

That the present Spatialite-Provider is sadly underdeveloped and in no way
will be able to deal with the upcoming Spatialite 5.0 changes is well known.

A new Spatialite-Provider is being actively worked on and is earmarked for
Qgis 3.2, that will deal with the present problems as well as supporting
the extra functionality of Spatialite 5.0.

Would it be possible to add these to the QgsOgrProvider, or are there
some limitations ?

Yes, that is what I was looking for. If it was moved here, the old
wiki page is irrelevant.

I have fixed the link in

Hi Mark, I didn't say that. My suggestion was to activate transaction
groups for all DB providers allowing that. And spatialite would be one of
them, aside from geopackage-gdal.

Do you have a link to the issues? Does it ignore them or worse?

mmmh, you already know of the previous discussions and the issue of having
overlapping providers, which mean both don't receive as much love as they
deserve and users get in confusion having two ways of accessing the same
datasource. The same happened for shapefile provider, and still happens for
delimited file. The cleaner option is always to merge effort in Open Source
model, when it's possible. Why not fix GDAL limitations, so that all other
clients will benefit from those improvements?

My point above. In my knowledge, less than 3-4 dev are involved in that
area, and are working on two different providers. Having you all on the
same code base is a neat solution I think.

Ok good to know, and let's make that happen if the work is mostly done.
In my recording, the amount of work to review the massive PRs was a
limiting factor to have that merged. And the QGIS reviewing process is
still remaining on unpaied volunteer work. Do you have plans to ease that
review process?

Best regards,
Régis Haubourg

Hi Hugo

Some technical opinion are available in related PR done by Mark to
propose a new Spatialite provider.
The general opinion is to check before if it make sense to remove
spatialite limitations in the gdal provider to sqlite.
There are also opinon that the PR is actually not so simple to review,
for the complexity and extension. Oslandia can do it if apport more to
his business.

IMHO I can't see any problem to merge it after review and have a new
or parallel spatialite provicer.

In any case, the Oslandia work related with custom osgeo4w packaging
(see madeira hackmeeting presentations in the event wiki) can simplify
the need to create a custom package with a packaged experimental
spatialite provier. This was the intent of the "extra" folder if I
well remember.
I invite Mark to give it a look.

>> Do you have a link to the issues? Does it ignore them or worse?

The original report was 3 years ago and is still active:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/12479

It was also a topic of a QGIS Grant Applications - August 2016
'Correction of QgsOgrProvider implementaion of GDAL 2.0'

A pull request was offered about Oct/Nov 2016 for Qgis 2.18 so that the
corrected code would be used for the start of Qgis 3.0 - but refused
because it was considered an api change.

Around April 2017 I saw that in Qgis 3.0 had still not been corrected,
despite the many changes that had been made.

Up to then I had been using a gdal version adapted to support writable
SpatialViews, that had not been accepted by gdal. But due to the evolvement
of gdal was becoming to difficult to maintain.

Around June I started work on the Spatialite-Provider, with consultations
with Alessandro Furieri (Sandro) of the Spatialite project about the future
needs, of what is now being termed, as Spatialite 5.0.

>> Having you all on the same code base is a neat solution I think.
Not when the 1 Provider (Ogr) will only offer partial results.
Writable SpatialView has existed since Spatialite 2.4 (we now have 4.3) and
there is no sign that Ogr will support this in the near future.

With Spatialite 5.0, where the world of Vector/Rasters, with Se/Sld Styles
are being brought togeather, this will become more difficult to deal with
with the separated gdal/ogr providers for all aspects of what can be done.

>> the amount of work to review the massive PRs was a limiting factor to

>> Do you have plans to ease that review process?
At the moment I am completing the last stage (of originally 4 stages) of
development (Database Maintenance, adding/renaming of columns etc.).

I have also started work on a Pdf which should help as an orientation as to
what the changes are and the reasons why.
One point I wrote this morning is: 'The Spatialite 5.0 Layout is similar in
nature to WMS/WFS 'getCapabilities', combining Vector, Raster and
Se/Sld-Styles.'

One goal is that such a Pdf should assist any reviewer who is willing to
work through this.

A major problem is also, that since Spatialite 5 has not yet been release,
it is difficult to understand why these massive changes are needed. So the
reluctance it is no surprise to me.

But the facts remain:
a) The present Spatialite-Provider is better than the Ogr support for
Spatialite
b) The present Spatialite-Provider will not be able deal will with what
Spatialite 5 offers

Although I myself am not a co-developer of Spatialite (more like a
collaborator), I intend to keep this up to-date with future developments.
It is also likely that Sandro will take a closer look after the present
development phase is over.

 I do not feel that long entries are bad. You do not have to click here and
there to find more information and see the global picture: all is there in
one place. all is then needed is to copy-paste and clean/adapt to the
context.

Thanks to all those involved in changelog writing; it'll be of real help to

Hi


Great inputs below - we also have an open ticket to use a GitHub hook to auto-add feature entries which should make the process a little less tedious…..

Thank you so much Regis and everyone else who has been helping with the changelog!

Regards

Tim

Well, I do: I think that unless there is an overwhelming technical reason
to take a different route, QGIS should not create alternative providers
where OGR/GDAL can do the job.

The reason is both in how open source works: building wonderful
applications on top of wonderful libraries (GDAL/OGR in this case) and in
how we should avoid to enlarge the code base without a valid reason.

The right approach in this particular case is IMHO to work with OGR/GDAL to
add the missing features in the base libraries or to improve the existing
QGIS providers if the problems is in them, this will prevent duplication
and lower the maintenance efforts on the shoulders of QGIS developers.

Tom,

This has been somehow discussed in https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/7228
Bottom line is that the multi-scale approach of vector tiles doesn't fit well with the 
traditional scale-agnostic vector layer approach. So somehow you need to assign each 
vector tile zoom level to a cartographic scale range.

Another thing not covered by the OGR MVT driver is the merging of the geometries of 
identical linear and area features split over several tiles (when iterating over a high zoom 
level with many tiles, doing that would have serious memory & processing time 
implications. When doing that for typical display purposes when you have just a few tiles 
opened at a time, this is something that can be done more reasonably).

The OGR MVT driver will appear in GDAL 2.3.0, expected to be release around May.

+1.

I strongly believe it would be a dangerous mistake for the QGIS
project to invest further development time and maintenance burden by
extending the spatialite provider, and I've made that view clear on
every discussion related to the spatialite provider over the 3.0
development cycle.

Alessandro has summed up my thoughts exactly.

Hi all,
still trying to polish the changelog here.

The entry for OOTB and lidar tool removal is really dry

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.0.0/#removed-otb-lidartools-providers-from-processing

Could anyone explain the rationale and perspective of plugin provider.
Sorry, I didn't follow that meeting and its conclusions at the hackfest,
it's better if someone more up to date writes the log.
Thanks!

Thanks Alessandro and Nyall,
that said, it means that two reviewers are probably not found of having
those PR integrated as is. Our community is based on consensus I think,
Could we raise that topic up to the PSC level?
Thoughts?

For display only, I guess merging is unnecessary - only cropping is
required.

I believe it would be necessary for proper display of areas at 
least. Otherwise you get ugly straight lines cutting your 
geometries.

Hi

I also think as generally policy supporting OGR is a better way to go where possible.

I don't quite see why that would be the case, but I don't want to waste your
time by implying that you should explain it to me. I'm new to vector tiles
myself, and have a lot to learn. Really pleased to have the Trac link, and
to hear that thought is at least being given to the idea.

Thanks again

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Is the apps\qgis folder cleared before installing

Message-ID: <CAB28Asi0QNi2WK1YmdvJ2--EtnvPXC0RDK+dMShbXG4oQi7jrQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, (but specifically Jürgen!)

I'm wondering if the existing content of the apps\qgis folder is
removed before a new QGIS version is install via osgeo4w?

My suspicion is that it is not -- at least on a desktop which
previously had 2.18 installed via the qgis package and which was just
upgraded to 3.0 I see some old content present. Specifically, the
fTools and GdalTools folder is left in apps\qgis\python\plugins.

This report leads me to believe I'm not seeing an isolated issue:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/272679/gdaltools-core-plugin-missing-metadata-file/272682#272682

Does osgeo4w have support for preinstall scripts which we could use to
wipe the python/plugins folder prior to an install?

Hi Tom, 

Areas in vector tiles are artificially cut into pieces. If you want to
stroke the outlines of the areas you would not only get the wanted
outlines of the original feature geometries, but in addition, also the
unwanted, artificial, borders. 

And even if you just fill and don't stroke, you would get rendering
artefacts (depending on the antialiasing settings of the rendering
library). qt, for instance, does not a good job to avoid rendering
artefacts of adjacent polygons who have a shared outline. You would
still see fine white lines. 

If you want to label areas, it would also be a problem. Similar
problems, if you want to label LineString data. 

There just so many unsolved issues with vector tiles (if they aren't
connected properly back to the original geometries by the client) - that
personally I don't bother working with them.

Hi all, 

Thanks all for the discussion around Geopackages, SpatiaLite, etc. 

Not sure if the PSC can help here? 

To me it seems like many people would prefer that we invest into OGR to
improve the Geopackage support - right? Isn't there consensus on that
already? 

So - it would be a matter of improving the geopackage support in OGR, so
QGIS can profit from that. 

Who would be a good developer to ask for this? Even? Or others? Which
dev knows about OGR, Geopackage/SQlite and transaction group support? 

Or would we need a small group of devs and/or other contributors to
better specify what we need and then look for a suitable dev to
implement our requirements? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Yes, so you buffer the tile during rendering, so that this "internal" stroke
falls outside the actual tile boundary, then clip back to the correct
dimensions.

Would require experiment, but since tile boundaries are always
horizontal/vertical, antialiasing issues should be less severe than
otherwise. Again, the buffer-then-clip approach above might result in a
non-antialiased tile boundary.

100% - labelling is problematic, but an approach is to label all fragments
of features, and rely on label collision settings to produce workable
output.

Sure, but many do work with them.

I guess the points you raise might make the plugin approach the right one -
I was just aware of the OGR work, so I thought it should be investigated. At
the end of the day, vector tiles exist, and do render correctly in other
clients.

Thanks for all the info

Tom

> Not sure if the PSC can help here?

Hi Andreas,
I think we can because it is not a technical decision, but a strategic one
about not dividing workforce, and how to not have such situations occur.
I think Mark (and maybe others) have made huge efforts for the new
spatialite provider, that is not merged because of some issues we could
adress at the PSC:

- explain and spread the word better of how to bring huge changes in the
codebase. ie how to get involved step by step, when to submit QEP before,
if it's tedious, come to hackfests and make meetings dedicated to that
change
- explain that open source succeeds because we always try to merge efforts
by working upstream when possible

Now we have to handle the fact that a huge serie of PR is here, and the
most active reviewers are reluctant to merge it as is.

So I think we could do something here to have contribution guidelines and
support to the reviewers.

Cheers
Régis

I agree about GDLA/OGR, and are the positions already expressed in the Mark's PR

but take into account that:

1) maintainer could be Mark (as for other core plugins e.g.
MetaSearch). I agree that having only a maintainer for a complex core
part can be dangerous for quality of the overall project => agree with
Regis, could be a PSC decision.
2) The code is already there and should overpass some sqlite
limitations not present in spatialite giving professional opportunity
right now (but also reducing the hability to rise funds for a OGR
solution :( )
3) It can be compiled or packaged optionally
4) Marks seems not focusing on work on GDAL/OGR

btw without reviewers it's hard to have any merge

Hi Luigi,
I think you summed up things right.

For the sake of the thread readability, I re-post Mark's answer that for
some reason was not considered a response to this thread by the mailman
list.

------

Feb 27, 2018; 1:47pm

>> Do you have a link to the issues? Does it ignore them or worse?

The original report was 3 years ago and is still active:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/12479

It was also a topic of a QGIS Grant Applications - August 2016
'Correction of QgsOgrProvider implementaion of GDAL 2.0'

A pull request was offered about Oct/Nov 2016 for Qgis 2.18 so that the
corrected code would be used for the start of Qgis 3.0 - but refused
because it was considered an api change.

Around April 2017 I saw that in Qgis 3.0 had still not been corrected,
despite the many changes that had been made.

Up to then I had been using a gdal version adapted to support writable
SpatialViews, that had not been accepted by gdal. But due to the evolvement
of gdal was becoming to difficult to maintain.

Around June I started work on the Spatialite-Provider, with consultations
with Alessandro Furieri (Sandro) of the Spatialite project about the future
needs, of what is now being termed, as Spatialite 5.0.

>> Having you all on the same code base is a neat solution I think.
Not when the 1 Provider (Ogr) will only offer partial results.
Writable SpatialView has existed since Spatialite 2.4 (we now have 4.3) and
there is no sign that Ogr will support this in the near future.

With Spatialite 5.0, where the world of Vector/Rasters, with Se/Sld Styles
are being brought togeather, this will become more difficult to deal with
with the separated gdal/ogr providers for all aspects of what can be done.

>> the amount of work to review the massive PRs was a limiting factor to
have that merged.
>> Do you have plans to ease that review process?
At the moment I am completing the last stage (of originally 4 stages) of
development (Database Maintenance, adding/renaming of columns etc.).

I have also started work on a Pdf which should help as an orientation as to
what the changes are and the reasons why.
One point I wrote this morning is: 'The Spatialite 5.0 Layout is similar in
nature to WMS/WFS 'getCapabilities', combining Vector, Raster and
Se/Sld-Styles.'

One goal is that such a Pdf should assist any reviewer who is willing to
work through this.

A major problem is also, that since Spatialite 5 has not yet been release,
it is difficult to understand why these massive changes are needed. So the
reluctance it is no surprise to me.

But the facts remain:
a) The present Spatialite-Provider is better than the Ogr support for
Spatialite
b) The present Spatialite-Provider will not be able deal will with what
Spatialite 5 offers

Although I myself am not a co-developer of Spatialite (more like a
collaborator), I intend to keep this up to-date with future developments.
It is also likely that Sandro will take a closer look after the present
development phase is over.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QEP 113: Allow injection of "label blocking
	regions" into QgsMapSettings
Message-ID: <CAB28AshXpWcBmc8hRs3i7y7ctgw7JCozkzLkEszMLqO2sK+-Gw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Please see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/113
for a new proposal covering proposed changes to the labeling and
QgsMapSettings API to allow for specification for "label blocking"
regions in a map render.

Label blocking regions will be useful for discouraging labels from
falling within "hidden" areas of a map. E.g. when a map annotation or
scalebar is displayed over a portion of the map, QGIS should attempt
to avoid placing labels in the obscured area below these annotations.
Similarly, within a print layout, if a map item has additional items
placed over it (such as a legend or north arrow), it is desirable that
labels should not be placed in map areas below these obscuring items.

(This proposal covers adding the API calls for supporting manual label
blocking regions only -- it is left to a future work to implement
automatic creation of these blocking regions for map-obscuring
elements.)

Comments and suggestions welcome!

Message-ID: <4703e373000bc9772b1cea5eb0f3d96a@giscan.com>

Hi, 

I tried to migrate from plugins in Qgis 2 to Qgis 3. 
I took the usefull group stats plugin as my main example to make
transition. 

Unfortunatelly, _Plugin home page_ and _tracker_ links for this plugins
are dead ( http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/GroupStats/ ), my apologies
if I'm not posting in right place. 

So I downloaded plugin and tried to converted it with changing Qt4 to
Qt5 in py script, using 2to3, rebuilding with pyuic5 and pyrcc5 under
linux. But now I'm stuck on a QMainWindow error. Where could I have help
to solve and understand how to solve it ? 

Sincerely, 

Sylvain

You can follow these steps:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Plugin-migration-to-QGIS-3

Don't change from PyQt4 to PyQt5, you can switch to "from
qgis.PyQt.QtWidgets import QMainWindow" or similar import.

The files installed by the previous package are removed and the
package preremove script is run.

postinstall,  see ms-windows/osgeo4w/postinstall-desktop.bat, which removes old
pyc.

Could we add a category for map tools?
Or do you see where it should belong too? general?
Maybe rename digitizing to map tools?

Thanks Chistophe and Etienne. Useful links. 

What I did is : 

- adding in groupstats.py : from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QAction,
QMessageBox
- Change QgsMapLayerRegistry to QgsProject
- adding in GroupStatsDialog.py : from PyQt5.QtWidgets import
QMainWindow, QTableView, QWidget

I could clic on icon now without vector loaded but stop on it : 

warstwy.sort(lambda x,y: cmp(x[0].lower(),y[0].lower()))
TypeError: must use keyword argument for key function 

I have to check python3 lambda and cmp usage ... But even with that,
variables in code are difficult to handle due to polish language.

Hi Sylvain,

You are posting to the right place :-)

I would first try to contact the original author, either to ask if he is
maybe already busy porting, OR to offer help to him OR to ask him (in
case he lost interest) if you can take over maintainership.
You can find his email address in the metadata.txt

In case you just want to port yourself for fun or quick use: just ask
your questions here, pasting the error messages and preferably pointing
to code which you put online somewhere: github.com, gitlab.com or
https://git.osgeo.org/gitea.

In general I do not think it is wise (anymore) to try to be compatible
in one plugin with both 2.18 and 3.x QGIS.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Richard Duivenvoorde
