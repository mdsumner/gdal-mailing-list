Hi Paolo

Well I've pondered these issues for QGIS too as I'm sure others have.  
Perhaps we should have put our idea of hiring a bug fixing developer  
to the vote first? I think there are numerous issues around gathering  
funds and then allocating them to one developer to do work. At the  
same time as long as QGIS is always a purely hobbyist project we will  
always struggle to get releases out -especially as QGIS grows in  
complexity.  Does anyone have any unhappiness towards the idea of  
hiring a bug squasher to get this release out? Personally I'm happy  
that we do this so that we can get this release out of the way and  
march on towards 1.0 release. I have this feeling that 1.0 is the  
'magic' time when existing developers can start to make a living as  
QGIS developers for hire....

Life always gets complicated when money enters the equation....

Regards

Tim

Hi.
I think that DT (Dunc Tank) is quite different from what we proposed for QGIS.

1) They hired RMs (release managers) while we want to hire experienced
    developer working on code.
2) They do not define well what work is payed exactly. We want to fix bugs
    from bug tracker.
3) They dont measure the work which was done. We expect regular
    reports from the hired developer saying which bugs were fixed and
    we will be able to calculate at least price per bug (obviously it does not
    say much but we have at least something)
4) It is not clear to me how they have chosen those 2 RMs. We opened
    the possibility to apply for everybody and we are going to vote
    to choose one.

If there are any objections we should definitely vote (gang of 13)
1) If we want to hire somebody
2) If so, vote about the process, especially if PSC or G13 should vote
    on applicants.

So far, my impression was that we have general consensus to hire
somebody to fix bugs and release 0.8 as nobody said nothing
against this idea.

I think paying someone to fix bugs is a great idea. The flap over
Dunc-Tanc surprised me. However those 2 devs were chosen, I know at
least Steve Langasek is one of the hardest working and most
knowledgeable devs in Debian. He is very no-nonsense and appears to just
do work rather than bicker over this and that. Although perhaps if I had
made a huge time investment in Debian I would feel, "why not pay me?"
But regardless of who gets paid, I think it's pointless to be upset
about it if you're not being paid. You can continue to contribute to the
project the way you always have, because presumably it is fun for you.
And it is pointless to worry about how people are chosen to be paid or
how their performance is being measured, since the people paying the
money will certainly look after their interest in that matter.

Hi Mateusz

Nice article - thanks for the pointer! I've read some of Zacks before
and its nice to know there is someone thinking so much about graphics
rendering performance since qgis depends so heavily on it.

Message-ID: <20061102160038.4CE2F2BB5A0@smtp2.nildram.co.uk>

I'm writing a plugin for QGIS that will require its own plugins. I'd like to
know if anyone has any advice/preferences on the use of either QLibrary as a
means of loading plugins (as used by QgsPluginManager) or the Qt plugin
stuff using QPluginLoader. I know that I'm resticted to extern "C" stuff
with QLibrary. It would also appear that the Qt plugin framework has its own
restrictions with regard to binary compatibility for the versions of Qt used
for the plugin and the hosting code.

Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
David Willis

Hi,
If you get an email saying you have been unsubscribed from qgis- 
developer, it is referring to the old mailing list hosted on  
SourceForge.net. This list has not been used in nearly a year and  
since SF doesn't remove mailing lists, the only solution is to  
unsubscribe everyone and disable future subscriptions.

Never fear, your qgis-developer subscription at lists.qgis.org is  
still intact.

Thanks,

Greetings,

As you are likely aware, we are soliciting donations to fund work on  
the QGIS 0.8 release. If you haven't heard, see the Sponsors page at  
http://qgis.org/content/view/131/105/ for more information. We will  
be contracting with a qualified developer within the next two weeks.

To date we have had 16 donations totaling $769 US. This is a great  
start, however it represents participation from only 1.6% of  
registered QGIS users.

The donations have come from five countries:
Italy (7)
Canada (4)
Poland (2)
France (2)
Portugal (1)

We would like to be able to fund a developer beyond November and to  
do that we need your help. All funds donated are used for  
development. There is no overhead or administrative charge, other  
than that assessed by PayPal. All charges are shown on the Sponsors  
page.

If you use QGIS I would like to encourage you to help in this effort.  
There are recommended sponsorship levels on the Sponsors page,  
however you can donate any amount you like. Every little bit helps.

Lets get some more flags on the page!

Thanks for supporting QGIS.

Hi Tim,

some time ago (when getting CMake to work) I've managed to build GRASS
using msys, I can take a look on it again.
Regarding Postgres, I've found out that it's easier to use pre-built
binaries than building them by myself:
http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/binary/v8.1.5/win32/

Hi Martin

Many thanks. First prize would be if you can give a patch /zip to
merge grass binaries & headers into the msys image I have on the
qgis.org download page. Second prize would be some notes to follow to
get it to build here. :-) Ill grab the pg sources so thanks for that!

I'll try to look at it in the evening when I come back from school, I
guess I will target the first prize ;-) I think I was building grass

Btw. is this archive your latest msys environment?

Excellent news! Thanks for the update! Martin did you encounter
similar issues? Perhaps there is room for a quick mutual brain dump
here? :-)

I don't remember any problems with sockets library - could you be more
specific about that?

Btw. I also haven't tried compiling it with GDAL ...

Hi

>From my very limited knowledge of GRASS I would say the most likely to
affect us would be the PNG driver problem - but even that I think wont
affect all users. I would suggest we stick what you have into the
msys.zip in the mean time and continue on with getting the rest of
QGIS working and then come back to this (perhaps a cvs update in the
future will resolve it anyway?).

Id like to get the preview3 out in the next week or so so with GRASS
in place and pg from the ftp site we should be able to move past those
issues and see what if any other things we need to resolve in order to
make a useable installer....

Nice going!

Regards

Tim

Hi

http://wms-sites.com/ has a catalogue of around 3000 layers if anyone
is interested....maybe one day we'll have access to this kind of
service integrated into QGIS.....

Not important. Display drivers are not used at all and
i.* modules are not supported because i.points/i.vpoints
need monitor. These modules should be implemented in
GRASS plugin, then we should think about other i.* commands.

Hi,
the problem is that somebody changed
  myRasterBandStats.bandName=QString::number(i) + " : " + myColorQString;
to
  myRasterBandStats.bandName = myColorQString ;
and  because
    QString myColorQString =
           GDALGetColorInterpretationName(
                     myGdalBand->GetColorInterpretation());
all bands has the same name.
Anybody remember why the change was done (it was before SVN)
and if there is any reason for it? I am going to revert it back to
use also the band number.

Hi all.
Would it be a big issue to release a preview3? I think current svn is
much better than preview2 already, and we would have better feedback
from users, especially on Windows, where users cannot easily compile for
themselves (and are not used to).
All the best.

Hi Paolo

I am going to put together another preview release based on the native
windows build that Godofredo and I have been working on. I need a
little more time to get it all working and packaged and then we will
go ahead with preview3...watch this space....

Hi all.
Because we want too release 0.8 soon and we have too many bug,
I think that we should only focus on bugs causing crash or freeze.
To get better overview of current state and progress, I suggest
to mark all crash/freeze bugs in the tracker as critical.
Any objection, can I do that?

Yes, that's a good idea. I thought also that names of
platform-specific bugs could be prefixed with something, e.g. [WIN],
[OSX], [X11] so we could distinguish them more easily.

Hi everyone!

I know this is way off the topics discussed lately by QGIS developers
and perhaps not even a QGIS-specific question, but I would really
appreciate any insight.

Overview:
I have created a QGIS plugin with two widgets, using the plugin
template: i.e. 1 plugin menu item with two menu items. The first widget
is a simple 1-layer layout with a push-button, all in 1 group box. The
second widget has three group boxes and two separate buttons. The one
button opens another widget (with text box inputs and a save button) and
the other button starts an algorithm.

The problem:
The first widget works fine, the second, however, displays everything
double (error->dialog boxes(another on OK), button->the widget(x2)
etc.). The gui part for both widgets is logically similar and I have not
any gui objects repeated in my *.ui file.

I have included the more important code at the bottom of e-mail...

Please, I have a final project demo next Wednesday!

Schalk

Hi

Im not sure if this will help your problem at all buy why not use the
new autoconnect mechanism of qt4. Since you seem to be using the
multiple inheritance approach to implementing your dialogs anyway...

Once apon a time in a galaxy far away I wrote this:

http://qgis.org/content/view/81/65/

Which sort of explains it a bit....then you can get rid of this kind of stuff:

       // signals/slots mechanism in action
       connect( pbnDBConn, SIGNAL( clicked() ), this,
SLOT( on_pbnDBConn_clicked() ) );
       connect( pbLocate, SIGNAL( clicked() ), this,
SLOT( on_pbLocate_clicked() ) );

In fact I am almost certain if you just delete the above lines your
problem will go away since you are using the implicit slot naming
convention of qt autoconnect they will almost certainly cause your
double popup issue...

Hope that helps

Groete...

It works with all of 8.x and did work for the 7.x series. Gavin may  
be able to give you more details.

Hi All

Well its been an interesting few weeks with the launch of our
sponsored developer programme. You can see a nice pie chart showing
where all the money has come rolling in from here:

http://qgis.org/content/view/131/105/

In the around 2 weeks since we started the sponsorship drive we have
already received $1152 in donations.

I've set up a poll on the QGIS home page and would be greatful if
existing QGIS contributors and users could take a moment to express
your views on the sponsored developer programme.

Best regards

Great.
Any news on how this money will be spent?
We contributors are anxious seeing the outcome of our efforts, of course!
All the best, and many thanks.

Hi

We (the PSC) will announce the chosen developer in the next day or two
and then it will all and only be spent of getting critical (i.e.
application crashing) bugs fixed, followed by less critical bugs if
there is still time & money.

Regards

Tim

Hi.
I have checked all tickets and set all and only those
causing crash/freeze to priority critical.
We have currently 15 open critical tickets:
https://svn.qgis.org/trac/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&priority=critical&milestone=Version+0.8+Release&order=id

We would like to release 0.8.0 once all critical bugs are fixed.
We are going to hire one developer to work intensively to fix these
bugs but I would like to invite every developer to take and fix at least
one of them.  If you are willing to fix one in coming days, please
send here the number.

I'll try to fix #248.

Thanks
Radim

Hi,
I have updated Qt to 4.2.1 and QGIS starts with terrible fonts.
All fonts (menu, dialogs) looks like raster fonts. I can change
family with qtconfig but all fonts look awful. Ather applications
(mostly Qt3 - KDE) are OK. Mandrake 10.2.
Do you know why and what can I do?

Message-ID: <28C67302-D942-48B9-9FB1-C73A81335841@mrcc.com>

I have added a "Must-fix" field to the bug tracker. This field should  
be set to "Yes" for all bugs that must be fixed prior to a release.

Why add a field? To me the priority fields define the severity of the  
bug rather than its relationship to the release. There are critical  
bugs (crashers) that must be fixed, but there are also other less  
severe bugs that should be fixed prior to release. This field allows  
us to tag those and consider them for resolution prior to release.

We have done similar things in the past, listing issues that are must  
fix. This just formalizes that a bit without making torturing the  
priority field in trac.

That said, marking everything as must fix for the initial 0.8 release  
will just delay things. Lets use the field to mark those bugs that  
are easily fixed and will close some long standing issues.

Hi all.
Apparently a postgis view is only visible if the primary key for the
table is int4. Is this confirmed? If yes, is there a reason for this? It
seems an unnecessary limitation.
Should I fill a bug?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Debian files for svn Qgis?
Message-ID: <20061111080357.GA14839@rigacci.org>

In the past few days I played packaging the current svn Qgis for 
Debian Testing. I was somewhat successful, and the repository 
debian.gfoss.it is providing the package.

I used the Debian files from
svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/debian
but I had to patch something to let compile the 0.8 svn version.

I ask Tim Sutton and Steve Halasz (the ones which done the 
debianization work) if those are the latest Debian files and if 
it is possible to discuss the patches I did.

Thanks

Message-ID: <08F03FE2-719D-4207-9811-0BEECE022A2E@linfiniti.com>

Dear QGIS users and developers

We are pleased to announce that Martin Dobias has been appointed to  
work on getting QGIS 0.8 ready for release as part of our sponsored  
developer programme. From Slovakia, Martin is an established  
developer on the QGIS team, having contributed the new canvas system  
for QGIS 0.8. He is also working on Python bindings for QGIS (see  
http://blog.qgis.org/?q=node/29) which will be available in a future  
release of QGIS.

We would like to thank the many people who have already contributed  
to our funding drive (http://qgis.org/content/view/131/105/) for  
their generous support.  If our funding drive continues to be so  
successful, their is always the option of hiring additional bug  
squashers. So if you are interested please send Gary a note  
expressing your desire to be considered.

Martin's main job will be to kill bugs in the QGIS bug tracker marked  
as 'critical' and 'must fix'. Once these bugs have been resolved QGIS  
0.8 will be released.

We will post regular reports on Martin's progress.

Best regards

Hi

Steve was working on the debian stuff (making separate packages for
each lib). I mentioned to Steve that some of these libs woud probably
be unified again (but still with the source organised in separate
subdirs) in a future version of QGIS. So I dont know if he is going to
wait for that to happen further....

In the mean time you are welcome to forward any patches to me and I
will apply them to SVN.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] msexport dumps core
Message-ID: <17752.40534.790618.875756@viola.nmsu.edu>

I have compiled qgis (checked out a couple of days ago) and am having
problems with msexport dumping core.  The gui presents itself, but
after I fill it in it crashes with the following sequence of messages
on the terminal:

   >>>>>>>>>>>>> Python initialized <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
   Reading setttings
   Writing setttings
   Python scripts directory: /usr/pkg/share/qgis/python
   Importing module
   Getting Qgis2Map constructor as python obj
   Creating args to pass to the constructor
   Initializing all options
   Segmentation fault (core dumped)

The gdb backtrace from the core dump is listed below.

I am unfamiliar with this tool, so perhaps I have filled out the form
wrong.  Even so, dumping core seems like the wrong response.

I would appreciate any help to fix this that you can offer.  Thanks
alot.

Cheers,
Brook

Subject: [Qgis-developer] not able to downCast to Custom class
Message-ID: <39f4276e0611140313ya8ca66dlea32ce4545853aff@mail.gmail.com>

greetings,
I know this doubt is more of C++ but i am out of sources and it
involves a lot of QGis classes.
Scenario is such:
I have custom canvas element class MyMapCanvasItem ,child of QgsMapCanvasItem.
A tool , MapCanvasTool , child of QgsMapTool. These are implemeted in
different plugins. One plugins accepts pouints from a pipe and display
on map background.
MapCanvasTool plugin is intended to do operation on these canvas
items, such that changing shape and color.

I am able to get mousePressEvents over custom canvas item. In
CanvasMousePressEvent() i am checking for collision of objects. So i
am having a list of Q3CanvasItems.
By checking their rtti() i know which class object it is and depending
on that i am making menu and signal-slot connection.
Hard part for me comes now. For doing any operation over the canvas
elements, i need a refrence to respective one in that slot. So i am
having a member pointer for refring to that.
Since on collision i am getting a list of Q3CanvasItem objects, i need
to downCast it to my class MyMapCanvasItem, but it returns null. I am
using dynamic_cast for that. This cast is happening perfectly for
QgsMapCanvasItem. Is there any way, i can avoid downcast  in such
scenarion???Also, is this way of doing peration is correct, as it look
to me since i have no control over QgsMapCanvasItem.

here is souce code::
//  my custom tool
class MapCanvasTool: public QObject,public QgsMapTool
{
	Q_OBJECT;
public:
	...........
	//!overidden functions for mouse movements and events
	virtual void canvasPressEvent(QMouseEvent *e);
......
	virtual bool isZoomTool() {	return false;}
// signals:
// 	void pointAdded(QgsPoint pt);

	void changeColor();

	{
		for( Q3CanvasItemList::Iterator it=il.begin(); it!=il.end(); ++it )      {
       		
			if((*it)->rtti()==12345)
			{	
			//	if(select=dynamic_cast<QgsMapCanvasItem *>(*it))
				//	QMessageBox::information(mCanvas,tr("Hello"),tr("Safe select

				//selection of item for doing operations over that
			if(!(item=dynamic_cast<MyMapCanvasItem *>(*it)))	{ //cast fails here
				QMessageBox::information(mCanvas,tr("Hello"),tr("Coudn't downcast "));
				break;
			}

If rtti() of your canvas item is correct, it should be safe to use
static_cast instead of dynamic_cast (which is also much slower).
However I don't know what's the reason why dynamic_cast doesn't work,
but it may be caused with the fact that you're creating a library...

thanks martin,
ya static_cast<> did provide some comfort. I will search more in this
field. Currently i am not bothered about optimization but later  i
will.
Also i am not creating a library. What made you feel i am creating
library or u were refring to library created for my plugin.

I attach a "diff -Naur" from the original debian files and mine, 
but I am far to be a Debian mantainer, can someone revise the 
changes?

I summarize:

debian/rules

    Changed ./configure with ./autogen.sh
    Added --with-wfs and --with-python
    Leaving all the other parameters the same


debian/libqgis0-dev.install
debian/qgis.install
debian/qgis-plugin-grass.install

    Updated the list of installed files (new plugins, etc)


debian/control

    Updated Depends and Build-Depends

greetings,
i have got some strange error.
Scenario is: in my plugin i want to have a popup dialog come up . So
put a new button in tool bar and connected its signal witha slot
responsible for generating or setting this dialog-ui.
But this resulted in similar error
qgis: symbol lookup error. unable to find symbol
:-Z123finddialog23QWidget32( not completely accurate but wit same
wordings).
What sense it make to me is library is not built corresponding class.
So i made an entry in makefile.am in  my plugin directory at line
libqgis_plugin_oprtool_la_sources:..
here oprtool is name of plugin.
But when i compiled program from here, Plugin menu donot lists my
plugin. So i can't activate it.
I have no idea what made it happened??

while studying comments on terminal , qgis gives error:

error in dlopen():/usr/lib/qgis/libqgis_oprtool.so:undefined symbol

later it couldn't resove it.
We display the dialog of plugin very similar way. Cn anyone

Niccolo

Many thanks for this! One thing - the wfs I dont think is going to be
part of 0.8 so we should apply that change only after 0.8 goes out.

Steve do you want to review and commit Niccolo's changes? Otherwise
Ill be happy to (but Im no packaging guru like Steve).

Regards

Message-ID: <39f4276e0611162319p5f1c5ce6i590e2ff82a557a52@mail.gmail.com>

greetings
For conversion of user units to canvas QgsMapCanvas class provides
mupp(), getscale() .
i want to convert 10km distant in equivalent of that. What i am doing is

10000 * mapUnits()
-----------------------------
mupp()* getScale()


Is it correct since ouput donot look like what was expected.
Also i am not able to undestand what scaleBar plugin denoted there. It
has a combo box letting user to specify size 30m/km etc. Wjat it is
exactly trying to convey .I went through code also but confused.

The wfs source code will not be part of 0.8 tarball?

I tested just an "hello world" wfs example and it worked. I think 
that compiling the plugin in the package, will let users to know 
that wfs exists and test the basic.

Very few people compile from sources just to try a new feature.
If the plugin is instable, we can just write it in the README.

Hi

It will be in the tarball but set to not build by default. And it
should not be in the binaries. Unless Marco feels its ready for
production use - though the last time he discussed this he felt it was
not ready.

Regards

Tim

It is not rock solid but it may already be of use to some people.
I could make a note in the wfs dialog saying that it is not considered stable 
and usage on own risk.

this seems the best option to me.
unless it is likely to crash the entire qgis, such an interesting
feature should not be omitted.

Must be a local/regional DNS issue. It works from here.

Hi all.
I have been reported some bugs for the win version. I cannot test more
thoroughly (non having windows); could someone check?
Bug #1
- -->Plugins-->Grass-->Open mapset

C:/QGIS/Dati/datigrass
Toscana_gauss
PERMANENT

- -->Add Grass vector layer

C:/QGIS/Dati/datigrass/
Toscana_gauss
PERMANENT
ACQUA_acque_marino_costiere_poly
1_polygon

- ---CRASH---
It might be a corrupted vector, but qgis should not crash anyway.

Bug #2
- From GRASS toolbar:

- -->Create new vector area map with current region extent
- -->Options: Output map "aaa"
- ---Successfully finished---
- -->View output

- ---CRASH---

Furthermore, it seems that after several crashes further crashes become
more likely: might it be some leftover? Where should I look for?

Hi Paolo,

I'll try to check it once I have my development box set up again.
However these actions should work normally - thus I guess that
something might be wrong with the data. Is it possible to pack it and
send it to me (or put it on web) ? And what version is it - preview2
or latest Tim's qmake builds?

Martin

Hi Freddy

(Im copying in to the dev list as there may be other folks out there
who can help)

One thing - which qt4 version do you have? I had a similar problem
with some openModeller code and I just upgraded to qt4.2.1 and *didnt*
build the qt4 debug stuff and then compile my openmodeller stuff in
release only mode and it fixed my plugin issue. Im wondering if that
will cure the postgres provider issue too. I will try to build qgis in
the same way later today.

Did you have a chance to think about why your pro patches for plugins
could be causing my build to fail?

Regards

Tim

Hi there,

recently I've found a nice page doing statistics for open source projects:
http://www.ohloh.net/

how does such statistics look like:
http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3238

What about adding QGIS there? It's free :-)

Thanks Gary!

94 000 lines of code, project worth 1,3 million USD, wow :)
There's an interesting pike in January 2004 in project's history.
Anybody knows what has happened?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qt Minimum Version
Message-ID: <4567AA8B.1080801@comcast.net>

Hi all,

Would it be a problem to make Qt 4.2 the minimum version for QGIS 8.0?

The API has been changed to provide better Mac-compatibility. Moving to 
Qt4.2/Mac without using the new API, however, results in a decline in 
the appearance of Mac buttons.

In Qt4.0/Mac, adjacent buttons that ought to have the same size don't. 
This has been fixed by adding a QDialogButtonBox layout class. Using 
this class, however, will make QGIS unbuildable for < Qt 4.2.

The QMessageBox API has also been changed to support cross-platform 
button layouts. In addition to better looking button sizes on a Mac, 
QDialogButtonBox and the new QMessageBox automatically swap the 
affirmative and cancel buttons so that the affirmative button is on the 
right for a Mac (where it belongs :) ).

Another benefit of Qt4.2/Mac is that a Mac crash when closing the QGIS 
Attribute Table window has been fixed. There is a new Mac crash, 
however, when opening the Vector Properties dialog. Since Raster 
Properties opens ok, it may be a case of needing to update something. I 
have found that removing Qt3 compatibility calls sometimes fixes 
Mac-only problems. Perhaps obsolete Qt4.0 routines are now causing Mac 
problems as well.

Hi,

I've also been thinking that Qt4.2 should be the minimum for Qgis 0.8. It
fixes a number of non-Mac problems as well.

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0611261253y68fb0959p479bf4042523eeed@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

using prepared msys environment I've been trying to build debug
version of QGIS, but when linking qgis.exe I've encountered error
regarding missing WinMain function. This is because when building it
doesn't link to qtmain and mingw32 libraries (however for release
build it does).

A solution for this problem is to add
LIBS += -lqtmain -lmingw32
to the qgisapp.pro file, but I'm wondering whether someone else has
the same problem (or compiled debug version without problems).

It appears that the "Save as shapefile" menu option (File menu and  
legend context menu) was stubbed in but never implemented. We talked  
about having this a feature long ago. I propose to remove the menu  
items for 0.8, and move the ticket to 0.9 where we will implement it  
for all data stores.

Any objections?

Hi Gary,

The bug in the legend context menu was that the menu entry was shown for all 
layers. After the last fix, it is only shown if the data provider of a layer 
declars the capability 'saveAsShapefile'. It seems to me that ATM delimited 
text provider is the only one supporting this. I remember that postgres 
provider did once, but I cannot find this operation for postgres in the 
current version. Where has it gone?

In general I agree that having a provider-independent shapefile export would 
be best. What about a 'export to shapefile' plugin? I think it wouldn't be 
hard to write.

cheers,
Marco

Same for me, Ubuntu 6.06, QT 4.1.4.

Gary,

Maybe it is about your X setup? I had severe problems with vectors
rendering speed until I tweaked my X configuration.

Hi Freddy,

I've downloaded qt 4.2.1 and installed it. It doesn't contain debug
version of Qt libraries. So I had to run:
(qt_path)\bin\qtvars.bat compile_debug
to compile debug versions of qt libs as they're necessary for debug
version of QGIS.
When compiling QGIS application as release version, everything is fine
(both libraries mingw32 and qtmain are used. But when compiling debug
version linking fails because these libraries (because of some reason)
are not included.

I hope this describes my situation with enough details.

Martin

GRASS shell is using MSYS terminal, i.e. qgis/msys/msys.bat
but some variables must be set previously by the plugin (GISBASE,
GISRC).

The plugin is looking for modules in GISBASE directory. Normaly
you dont need to specify the directory especially on windows where
it attempts to use qgis/grass directory. If a directory with GRASS
is not found in the expected path you are asked to select a directory.
In that case the path is stored in QGIS settings and it is used
in future if the directory is valid. If that directory was removed
you should be asked to select another one.
The only way to change GISBASE if previously dir still exists
is to edit QGIS settings manualy.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Overwrite GRASS raster on Windows
Message-ID: <340505ef0611280735md74fce9l1f361e339d46f03@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.
I found a strange (but desired) thing. I can overwrite a GRASS raster
layer which is open in QGIS on Windows (NTFS). It should not be possible
because it is not possible to delete/move a file which is open
by another application on Windows. And AFAIK it was not possible some
month ago.
Now I can overwrite an open raster without problems on XP Professional SP2.
I cannot delete the file from file manager but I can see that the time
was updated
if a GRASS module was run!!!
Can you confirm, explain?

Radim

The status after OPEN request in Filemon is 'SHARING'.
So it seems that CopyFile() can overwrite a file which is used
by another program. I thought that impossibility to delete
a file is Windows/NTFS, but it is probably only on application
level. Interesting.

Great, I will try it also and commit that. Looks much better than my
solution by adding the libs manually.

IMO native cmd/command is absolutely useless. We have to use MSYS
shell, I dont see other possibility.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] call for translations
Message-ID: <200611290859.39644.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Dear qgis users and developers,

The QGIS sourcecode moves slowly but steadily to 0.8 release state. This is a 
good time to update the translations for qgis dialogs such that many qgis 
users may enjoy their favourite gis program in their native language.

If you already did a translation or feel to become the maintainer of a 
particular language, enter your name at 
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/TranslatorsCorner. Or send me a mail and I will 
enter your name. This is important to avoid duplicated work if several 
persons work on the same language.

To do translation work, you don't need to be a programmer or care about the 
translation mechanism of qt (of course you can do this if you like). The 
simpelst case is that you just download the Qt version for your platform and 
install it (http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/index). You need 
the tool called 'linguist'. I will send you a .ts file, you open it with 
linguist, fill in the translations, save it and send it back to me. I will 
then commit the file to svn.

The following output shows, which translation are pretty much finished and 
which not.


cheers,
Marco

I will hand you in the updated german translations by the weekend, because 
currrently I am very busy... I will base my work on a fresh SVN-HEAD 
checkout.

Erm, tried it now again with updated SVN without my hack (LIBS += ...)
and with settings.pro still set to CONFIG += release and now also
debug version of qgis.exe builds correctly - without the need to use
CONFIG +=...

I'm a bit confused with this - looking at recent commits by Tim I see
that he's been altering only providers and plugins project files, thus
I don't understand why does linking qgisapp work now :-)

Any ideas?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Windows native build snapshot
Message-ID: <d368056f0611290434m791cb266q99e9edffb2e60a14@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I've uploaded another windows build snapshot (release version only)
which includes fixes to make the grass shell work again. Can someone
who knows more about grass than me have a quick test to see if the
shell works as expected?

Note for the shell to work QGIS still needs to intall in a base dir
with no spaces. i.e. installing into c:\Program Files\QuantumGIS will
not allow shell to work as the path has spaces in it.

The snapshot is available here:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/qgis_setup.exe

The snapshot also includes a few other fixes like plugins showing up
in the plugin manager properly. The win build still has some issues so
its not building everything in the codebase properly yet. Thanks to
Martin, Freddy and Phillippe for the ongoing help! Anyone else who
would like to help (even if its just testing and filing bugs) please
contact me. I'd be particularly interested to hear from someone who
can help get python setup in the msys environment and test the
ms_export tool.


Regards

Hi (Radim! :-)

I've build a gdal_grass.dll driver for gdal to read grass rasters in
msys. What I cant work out is where in the application bundle it
should go to be found and used properly at runtime? I tried looking in
the xcompiled prev2 zip and dont see it ther. How did you get rasters
to work in the xcompiled versions? Any other tips?

Thanks

Hi there,

I diagrammed the data model currently used by the lib_refactoring branch. 
While trying to understand the interaction of the classes and their purpose, 
I saw that some classes share similar functions (e.g. nextFeature in layer 
and provider classes), at the same time some classes could be further 
refactored. 

So, I went ahead and created a proposed data model, the way I would have 
designed it. The idea behind the model is that we have two main classes:

- QgsDataSet: used for data manipulation on a feature level (e.g. adding, 
deleting, etc.), used in QgsMapLayer for rendering. This class would contains 
methods such as nextFeature(), deleteFeature(), updateGeometry(), 
createPyramid(), etc.

- QgsDataProvider: used for data manipulation on a dataset level, e.g. 
copy/deleting an entire dataset, format conversion, select subset of 
features, etc.

The QgsMapLayer classe(s) would only be used for rendering purposes, and 
methods such as nextFeature, etc would be remove from the class.


Please let me know what you think. If folks think this approach makes sense, I 
would be happy to continue developing the model and post my progress for 
comments on the wiki site.

cheers,
Christoph

I recompiled GDAL with GRASS support, it was not stand alone module.
I'll ask in gdal-dev list.

Hi,

you're right, this is a bit pain - they are nearly the same, just
QgsVectorLayer adds support for added / changed / deleted features
that haven't been propagated yet to provider. Really bad is that for
getting features we usually use getNextFeature() from provider, not
from layer - result is that with some operations you're unable to work
with newly added geometries etc.

If I understand your design correctly, data provider should stay just
as low-level data stores for different backends, data sets should
provide most of the functionality that currently vector/raster layers
implement and finally layers should work just as 'presentation' of the
data set. This design look good to me from the first sight. Map layers
can interface only with data sets, without having to use data
providers directly. Data sets can organize data, probably adding
functionalities that  provider doesn't implement (e.g. attribute
indexing, spatial indexing, caching).

Another big thing that's waiting for better design is QgsRasterLayer
class. It's huge class with great amount of functions and very hard to
catch up. Also it needs to change its architecture to enable raster
data providers (similar to vector ones). Yes there is some kind of
support already but it's quite weird and full of hacks.

I'd really happy to see some more investigation on this - possible
problems, benefits, interfaces, diagrams, example use cases etc. :) go
ahead!

Martin

Radim,

Looking at the code, it would appear that you can out plugins in a
gdalplugins subdirectory of whatever directory the current executable
comes from.  If you want to put it somewhere else, you will need to
define the GDAL_DRIVER_PATH environment variable or config variable
to point to the directory to be searched.

Best regards,

Radim,

2 days ago I have posted an update regarding bug #345 you were trying
to fix. Unfortunately it is till mostly valid - no crash, but still no
file created.

I also have the "Cannot find BoundingBox" error Henning mentions.
Moreover I still get the "Cannot find translate" error.

I also can't print to a printer.

And the weird thing is that the printing to a file actually tries to
create a pdf, not and eps! And it even almost succeeds :).

For details see my most recent message in
https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/345

Maciek

P.S.
I saw you were assigned to this bug, so I didn't CC you. Now I see you
propably didn't get the message. Are the bug owners CCied?
