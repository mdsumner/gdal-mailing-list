Hello,

In 2.14 Changelog, there is a comment in one description:

" Is it not a duplicate http://changelog.qgis.org/en/entry/update/441 ?"

Does someone could remove it and check that there is no duplicate? I can't 
have access to this entry number!

Thanks,

Hi,
Yves, the changelog is now available at
http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog214/index.html and this
text is no more available.
However, I think the concerned feature ("New options for filtering legend
elements") should be under "Map Composer" chapter.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] twkb (Tiny WKB) in QGIS?
Message-ID: <1456907041.2342.40.camel@jordogskog.no>

Hallo all

I have seen this question raised before some time ago on QGIS list.
That made me glad :-)

But I think maybe time is more right now, since twkb is suppoerted in a
released PostGIS version.

For anyone not knowing what twkb is:
TWKB is a geometry format with similarities to wkb, but uses compressen
the same way as MapBox Vector Tiles.

I started to work with this format maybe 4 years ago. 
I added encoding support in PostGIS trunk some time after PostGIS 2.1
release.

I will not tell the whole history here, but last spring, in 2015 the
format went through quite a big face lift. Since CartoDB was interested
in using the format between their database servers and rendering
servers, Paul Ramsey looked into the format and did some great
improvements. He wrote a blog post about the result for CartoDB
http://blog.cartodb.com/smaller-faster/

Also Javier Santana at CartoDB should be mentioned here since he was
part of the discussions.

Then with PostGIS 2.2 we now have encoding and decoding of twkb in
PostGIS.

I have all the time thought that twkb should be a good fit for the
communication between PostGIS and QGIS.

There is some things to consider though.
TWKB doesn't preserve the precision in the coordinates. Because of that
it is not suitable for writing back to the db.

But the increased size (often about 7 times) compared to wkb would give
a real boost to QGIS. Especially Encoding and decoding is fast. For
example, writing a table inside PostGIS to a new table like:
CREATE TABLE foo AS
SELECT ST_Binary(geom) FROM table1;

is slower than encoding and writing as twkb
CREATE TABLE foo AS
SELECT ST_AsTWKB(geom) FROM table1;

But, as mentioned, then decimals is removed. 
The encoder in PostGIS takes a second argument that defines how many
decimals that should be included. Default is 0 for meter based
projections and 6 or 5 (I don't remember) for 4326. The precision value
can also be negative which results in reounded integer values, like -1
means 10 meters precision (on meter based projections)

So here is my suggestion how to handle things.

As an option for people using PostGIS >= 2.2 as backend, they can switch
to twkb as transportation format. When zoomed out QGIS asks PostGIS for
0 or -1 decimals precision. When zooming in QGIS requests more
precision. But meter precision is enough for quite deep zooming.

So, the editing issue. When the user opens a layer for editing QGIS will
have to switch to wkb format. If not the whole geoemtry that is edited
will loose precision when sent back. 

It could be possible of course to edit and accept less precision. For
GIS-professionals that know how accurate their data is, they know that
storing 10 decimals is no gain. They could decide that their data set
only have cm precision and work both ways with twkb with 2 decimals.

The compression is worse with 2 decimals than 0 decimals of course, but
still smaller than wkb. So one approach could be that there is an option
to decide with what precision to edit and use twkb as return format too.


But as a first step I think decoding at QGIS as a client is a big step
forward.

I don't have the skills to write this in C++ myself, but everything
needed exists in C, both in PostGIS and in a small standalone library
that I have been playing with https://github.com/nicklasaven/twkbC.

But to make things as fast as possible the decoding should of course be
done directly from twkb into QGIS internal format, with no other
representations in between. 

So, if anyone is interested, I will do all that I can to help. But I
don't think it would be much faster to get someone on board that knows
the QGIS code base and know C++, than me trying to do things myself.

So, what do you think?
Could this be interesting?
If so, what next? This shouldn't be a very big thing if we find a way to
work. 

I guess if it is interesting it is a candidate for QGIS 3.0


Best Regards

Nicklas Avén

Hi Nicklas,

This is indeed a great idea, and will go on further on the step already
done here [1] with PostGIS 2.2 backend. QGIS 2.14 now uses
ST_RemoveRepeatedPoints as described by one of the optimisations we can use
with PostGIS

As you said, we could only use this format for rendering purpose, and not
for spatial analyses or writing back to the PostgreSQL server.


I do not personaly know how much work is needed to achieve this, but this
would be a great step further to lower bandwich usage and improve
performance.

Cheers
Michaël

	in QgsGeometry
References: <1680104985.3351062.1456917243633.JavaMail.yahoo.ref@mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <1680104985.3351062.1456917243633.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Hi guys, QgsGeos class wraps the QgsGeometryEngine interface of a QgsAbstractGeometryV2 geometry. It is used massively for many spatial functions (IsGeosValid, contains, crosses, intersects....) in QgsGeometry.But testing perfomance I see that all operations create in QgsGeos a new GEOSGeometry instance from the current QgsGeometry object.It is a performance bottleneck (e.g. labeling), We can test....QgsGeometry a = ...
QgsGeometry b = ...

for (int  i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
  bool contains = a.contains( &b );
}
The current code creates 200 GEOSGeometry objects.
I am right ? Is there one reason for this behavior?

I created a pull ( https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2859 ) for discussion or review. If I am wrong, my apologies, I delete the pull.
Thanks in advanceAlvaro

Hi,

This is interesting.

But I am pretty sure the possible gain in speed greatly depends on
multiple other factors. In some scenarios, computing deltas in geometry
coordinates may take time compared to a direct access to numbers
represented by raw doubles.

That would be an interesting addition to the postgres provider, but it
has to be an option for advanced users and should probably turn the
layer read only. It could probably be started by adding a geomFromTwkb
in GeometryFactory and an option to the postgres provider

Just out of curiosity: I am not a dba, but I would be surprised if there
is no way to optimize the bandwith usage of a postgresql server. I am
pretty sure postgresql network exchanges can be tunneled in ssh. So
there might be a way to tunnel them with gzip for example. That would be
interesting to compare the overhead of tinywkb compared to the overhead
of gzip. Did you run some similar benchmarks ?

But I agree with you that the real gain will be when data is transported
over the net. 

But I also think as QGIS becomes a more and more respected player in the
GIS-world, the usage is also moved out from single machine usage. Me
myself now have a scenario when we are designing a system running in the
cloud. We will use QGIS-server for rendering wms-service. Then I have to
administrate the data and qgis-project on the server from my office. 

I also know local authorities here around starting to use QGIS against
central PostGIS databases.

So I think the need will increase as the usage gets wider.

I don't know anything about the internals in QGIS, but I think that it
is an important point to reduce the handling of uncompressed data. THat
is one of the key features that makes encoding so fast at PostGIS side I
think, that it is encoded more or less directly when read from disk. THe
number of memcopying of the uncompressed dataset is low.

I have not benchmarked gzip in that way. But I have compared those three
scenarios 
1) Inside PostGIS, encode to twkb and write the result to a new table
2) encode to wkb and write it to a file outside PostGIS and compress to
zip and tar.gz
3) encode as geojson without decimals. Export to a text file and
compress to zip or tar.gz

I compare point 1 one with the compression time in point 2 and 3. The
wkb/geojson encoding and export from db is of course irrelevant.
geojson with 0 decimals takes approx the same size as wkb with full
precision (Makes no difference in wkb how much precision (well with
zeroes it would probably compress better) .

I haven't done this for a while, but the typical numbers is for a table
containing 300 mb of geometries as wkb is that the twkb option above to
encode and write a new table in PostGIS uses about 3 seconds.

Number 2 and 3 uses at least 20 seconds to compress and write result to
disk.
These tests is on the same machine, and the fact that number 1 writes to
a database table shouldn't give any benefit as far as I know. 

The result is also smaller for twkb, than the compressed files produced
in 2 and 3.

So, for rendering a dataset with 300 mb of geometries as wkb, qgis would
in total have to wait less than 3 seconds for the encoding (one one
thread since PostGIS uses only one) . And then get only maybe 60 mb
transfer. 
And since the database starts spit out the first row more or less at
once, the whole have to be rendered on the client in 3 seconds before
PostGIS will be a bottleneck. 

About decoding it should be slightly faster than encoding if done right
I think. And since QGIS can use many threads...


I believe it can be a great boost in many situations.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] copy/paste with Z/M values and new geometry classes
Message-ID: <56D6E6E1.2060108@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I noticed that we have troubles while copying from 2d layers to 3d layers.
While investigating, I realize that we have new geometry classes that 
are not yet used here.
I thought I would update the code to use new classes, but it appears 
that some functionnality covered in old qgsgeometry is not yet covered 
in the new classes.

So, my questions are:

* What is the plan for old geometry classes, will they be removed 
whenever 2.x dies? Or will they live together for some time?

* What happens if there was a functionnality in old classes that is not 
present in new geometry classes?
I am speaking about conversions from type to type (line to/from 
polygons, line to/from multipoint and so on). These were developped in 
old classes and used by the copy/paste mechanism in qgis app. It seems 
all these conversions were not ported in new classes (yet).

Thanks a lot,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Questions/Suggestion on virtual layers
Message-ID: <87143cf2bae2640d646583a8fb51fb41@carto.net>

Hi, 

I am experimenting with the virtual layers. They are quite cool! 

I have some suggesions/questions: 

 	* It would be nice to have a preview of my query results. Currently it
is either it works - or not. If it works, but the results are wrong you
have to start from scratch. I would suggest that when you press on the
test button you would not only display "No error" or the error message,
but maybe the first 10 rows of the result.
 	* Updating the virtual layer: it would be really nice if I could
edit/improve on my virtual layers without having to start completely
from scratch. --> Oh - now I found out that if you select an existing
virtual layer and then use "Layer" --> "Add Layer" --> "Add Virtual
Layer", that you can refresh an existing virtual layer. This is really
not obvious. I think this is more a usability issue.
 	* it is not very obvious how you can reuse an already existing
geometry column. I discovered it by accident, that you can use
layer.geometry (regardless of the original name of the geometry column),
but I think that it is not obvious. A better hint in the the tooltip
would probably help.
 	* Unique identifier column: If you join several tables, you often have
the issue that you need to create an artificial primary key. Could we
offer a preconfigured builtin pkey - something like a rowid  for such
cases?
 	* What is the exact purpose of the "Embedded Layers" where you can
add/import/remove layers? I noticed that existing layers of the project
work anyway without adding/importing them first. Is the idea that you
can work on layers that aren't in the project?

Should I open feature request tickets for these or are there already
plans to address one or the other of the above issues? 

Thanks anyway for this interesting new feature! 

Andreas

True.
Note that you can also create a virtual layer using the DB Manager where
it can display the first rows of a query, as it is the case for other
databases.
I am not sure to love having these two very close but slightly different
dialogs. If anyone has a better idea in terms of usability, do not
hesitate to propose :)

Yes ... I am more used to click on the addition icon, which makes it
more direct, but you are right, this is not perfect.

An entry in the right-click menu ?

Edit - you can also use the drop down menu of the creation dialog to
switch between different virtual layer definitions, as mentioned by Yves

Indeed it appears to be not documented.

Good point. An autoincremented id is already generated on the feature.
That may not be a problem to add a "rowid" column in that case.

Yes it is.
You can for example embed layers from the project, save the virtual
layer to a QLR and reload it in a new project, the referenced layers
would not need to be already loaded.
There may be some documentation needed as well here.

Unfortunately, no plan yet.
Thanks for your tests and feedback !

Hi all,
is anybody aware of an application of QGIS to the planning, design, and
management of optical fibre networks?
I have find this:
http://www.comsof.com/blog/planning-fttx-networks-with-qgis
which appears to have a QGIS plugin to manage an external program.
Anybody knows more?
All the best, and thanks.

Andreas,

In the layer toolbar, after the "Add a delimited text Layer" icon you have the 
"Add a virtual layer" tools. In the panel you can choose a virtual layer name.

If you create two virtual layer, when you come back to this windows, the 
dropdown list will show you the two layers that you can edit.

But you are right, if there is an error, the virtual layer won't be saved.

Ah - now I see what you mean. Thanks - so with this drop-down box I can
access the definitions of all the existing virtual layers in the
project. Nice. 

The only usability problem is that you have to go throuhg "Add a new
virtual layer" in order to edit the definition of an existing one. I
think this is quite confusing. 

> But you are right, if there is an error, the virtual layer won't be saved.

Well - if we had a preview of the results - this wouldn't be much of an
issue. I can understand that virtual layers with an error in the
definition shouldn't be saveable. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Can one create new virtual layers in the DB manager? I know that I can
do queries on existing layers and load it as a new layer - but is this
the same thing like a virtual layer?

ah ok - the button works as "edit" if you have the layer selected. Maybe
then we should rename the tooltip from "Add Virtual Layer" to "Add or
Edit Virtual Layer" 

> An entry in the right-click menu ?

Yes - that was my first idea - to look for an entry in the layer context
menu. Of course this entry should only be there if it is a virtual
layer.

yes - now I found it - thanks!

This would just require an additional sentence in  the tooltip of the
Query panel, after the sentence "Any functions from SQLite or Spatialite
can then be used in the query.: 

To add or access existing geometries of a table, you can use
"tablename.geometry", regardless of original geometry column's name.

That would be cool to have.

Maybe we could add another tooltip here, explaining that one can add
layers that are not in the project - and that you need to "embed
existing layers", if you want to save to a qlr and load it in a
different project.

Ok - I will open feature requests for the above, where useful.

Andreas,

I though that you can edit the request of your virtual layer. In the drop down 
list you c an choose the one to change.

Am I wrong?

Hi Paolo,

I am indeed worrking with a client on improving a project done here in
France which is called grace-thd.
http://gracethd-community.github.io/

They have made a great job on creating a data model with real-case need.
This model is approved by french standardisation organization for public
entities.

I am working justright now on several improvement that I will give back to
the project:
* use relations
* improve layers fields ( aliases and add more form field types )
* use a project in Lizmap to publish it
* Create a dedicated module in Lizmap to edit some layers with a specific ui

I will have somthing in beta version ( QGIS Side) in about 10 days.

Cheers
Michaël

Hi Paolo,

Indeed it will be available : the project itself is opensource, and my
improvements will of course be open-source too.

We will also need to localize the layers fields aliases and comments.
Perhaps will you agree to help in this area ?

Dear All,


Following the acceptance of OSGeo as mentor org also this year, we are
now recruiting mentors! Remember that mentors are the building blocks
of GSoC: we are not going anywhere without you! [1]

There is nothing like automatic mentors renewal. If you are available
for mentoring this year (again), you need to fill in this simple form
[2] and read and commit to the mentors’ responsibilities here [3]. If
you’re not yet subscribed to the soc ML [4], please do so. Remember
that we require two mentors for each accepted idea: so please spread
the word among your community and recruit mentors!


Looking forward to build a strong team of geo-mentors!


Madi and Anne

your OSGeo GSoC admins

Hello,

There is also some work on a QGIS project for visualisation with postgis view.

I don't know if this is the same work as Michael talked about.

This is funny because I am working on this project also for one customer, not 
on QGIS side anyway for the moment.

Y.

Quite interesting, thanks for now. I'll be back to you all if thing
become more concrete.
All the best.

Sorry, I see this now.

FYI: I created that plugin some years ago. It has been in their own
private repo for some time and in my github repo untill very recently.

It was actually a pretty light plugin: all button bars which actually
called via cli their java programs which then did calculations, created
shapes, which were saved in a standard directory which were then loaded
by QGIS.

Not sure what the status is now, but there was no network-calculation or
whatsever in the plugin itself.

Regards,

Richard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Changelog for processing API ?
Message-ID: <CAKT=1=AJRM=poh0fgUcA0n6Hf3N11foA0ks+DEF_QLUWFDr1zw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

After upgrading to QGIS 2.14, some of my processing script doesn't work
anymore. It seems there are small changes for some algorithms call.

For example 'gdalogr:rasterize' add a new parameters named EXTRA and change
the order place of the parameter TFW.

Not a big deal, but is there a place that list this kind of changes ? I
haven't found anything whereas it would be a great help to quickly update
processing scripts.


Thanks for any help

Hi Andreas and all,

sorry to hijack your thread but my question is related as I am also 
trying to evaluate the new feature virtual layer.

My first tests resulted in QGIS freezing upon clicking "Test" or "OK" 
(2.14.0 on Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit). It finally turned up it was the layer's 
names containing dots (e.g. "schema.table" as they come from PostGIS). 
Double quoting any layer and field names containing dots solved this 
issue. However I had joins containing field names with dots, too because 
of the prefix I used ("table.") which could not be resolved but at least 
threw an error on testing. So I would propose to at least add a notice 
in the tooltip that if one runs into problems, double quoting layers' 
and fields' names might solve issues. Better would be to already have 
them double quoted if inserted from the pop-up list.
Should I open a ticket?

Very cool feature, though!

Bernhard

Hi,

Adding double quotes when the table name contains dots and is inserted
from the completion dialog would help, sure. Thanks for the feedback.

We can as well add something in the documentation about dots in the
query. But this is not specific to virtual layers. The same is true for
postgis / sqlite.

I'll try to look at the documentation and small usability issues listed
in this thread soon.

You are right but PostgreSQL e.g. is not case sensitive whereas the 
virtual layer's SQL is case sensitive (I have no idea if this is the 
same in sqlite)

Indeed, that's better.

Hmmm, actually sqlite is case insensitive, but the virtual layer is case
sensitive when looking for a loaded layer. I probably should change this
to be more consistent.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server sending UPDATE... WHERE NULL to
 postgis in a WFS layer
In-Reply-To: <1454077269578-5248023.post@n6.nabble.com>

UPDATE 03/03/2016 

I updated to QGIS Server and QGIS Desktop to 2.12.3 both and the problem
continues.

After many days of tests I finally found when the issue occurs. I happens
when I save edits of the layer in QGIS (via WFS-T) and at the same time a
[Lizmap Map][1] is being loaded by another user. Lizmap also uses
qgis-server.

Looks like when loading a map, Lizmap makes the server busy and when a WFS-T
update request is recived, QGIS Server is not capable of building the UPDATE
SQL query correctly.Example:

 If there is a Lizmap loading at the time the WFS-T post is received, the
PostgreSQL query generated in qgis-server is:

    2016-03-03 11:47:30 CET LOG:  00000: sentencia: UPDATE
"public"."getxo_alumbrado_tendido_canalizacion" SET "diametro"='22' WHERE
NULL


On the other hand, if qgis-server is not serving data to a loading Lizmap
when the WFS-T arrives, the PostgreSQL query generated is:

    2016-03-03 11:46:21 CET LOG:  00000: sentencia: UPDATE
"public"."getxo_alumbrado_tendido_canalizacion" SET "diametro"='111' WHERE
"id"::text='1' 


Note the diference in the where clause. The first one it does nothing. The
second one works ok.

I don't know if I can tune Apache or any config files for qgis-server to fix
this issue. 

I tried giving much more hardware to the server (4 cores and 16 GB RAM) with
no chnage.

--------


I am making all the software updates using OSGEO4W. Ia read somewhere that
Apache and PHP packages have not been updated for years. I'll try to update
them manually and check that the apache or php version is not the cause of
the problem.

Hi all,
currently I get replicable crashes on QGIS 2.8.6 (Debian Sid) when
activating a QMS layer, with OTF on a projection different from 3857. It
was working until recently. QMS has not been upgraded recently.
Anyone confirms?
All the best.

Hi Stefan,

Sorry for the delay in reply. OAuth should be able to be implemented as an
authentication method plugin for the new system, thereby making it
available for WxS connections, as well as other HTTP connections.

I have a proposed talk and workshop on auth method plugins for the QGIS
conference in Girona (no word yet on whether they are accepted).

In the meantime, you could review existing auth method plugins and
formulate some psuedo-code on the steps needed to intercept the request and
work with OAuth:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/src/auth

This is the base plugin class:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/auth/qgsauthmethod.h

The last thing I did was add auth method plugin support to the system,
which allows a C++ plugin to be built, then dropped into an existing 2.14
install, etc.

Hi Larry

your 4h  workshop on new Qgis Auth System is "unufficially" approved
(you'll receive official confirmation soon)... I suppose most of
developers working with public institutions will are interested in it.

so Stefan... prepare your trip to the Qgis International conference in
Girona (Es) :)

cheers
Luigi Pirelli

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Moving styles from and to db and shp
Message-ID: <56D94F44.4030701@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
we designed a project based on a db, then saved all layers to shp. In
the process, the names of the columns were obviously truncated, so the
styles are no longer working, and have to be fixed by hand.
I do not see an automated way to solve this - am I missing something? A
possible longer term solution could be to use column aliases to define a
style: could this be a reasonable enhancement?
All the best.

IMHO the only reasonable enhancement would be to get rid of shp as default  
intermediate working format within QGIS, but discussions about possible  
candidates still end nowhere.

Sorry for advocating this this again ;)

Oh, sure, a never-ending question.
I think we'll have to live with it for long enough to make an alternative solution necessary.
Thanks.

QGIS 2.16 will come with Processing instead of ftools in the vector menu.
And in processing, we can already set the default output to sqlite,
geojson, geopackage ... so the answer is coming slowly ;-)

Hi guys, I do not know to what degree this will affect anyone, but came
across this snippet:

"Fellow GIS-ers,



As you may be aware, Microsoft dropped dbf support from the newest versions
of Access (2013 & 2016).  Their reasoning?...dbf is an antiquated and/or
dead file format.  They either did not realize or ignored that dbf is the
tabular format behind all shapefiles and very much still in use throughout
the entire GIS industry.  It is the universal format for, at the very
least, GIS data exchange.



Unfortunately, this means one can no longer link to a shapefile dbf table
from within an Access database to work directly with the data (neither
manually nor through VBA).  I’ve been on the phone and exchanged numerous
emails with Microsoft’s support personnel over the past couple of weeks,
building a case for bringing back dbf support. The best I can get (without
a “Premier” support ticket) is the suggestion to continue using Access
2010, or some other registry hack-type workarounds…all of which are
unviable in the long-term.



So, I’m pushing for a “grass-roots” campaign, if this problem directly
affects you…please consider voting for the current “bring back dbf”
suggestion in the online Access suggestion box:"

I'm sure there are other dbf editors out there outside of excel. I don't
think it will have any impact on the GIS world really

Message-ID: <B2CAB232-6E35-4B26-8F66-DDB2581ED0F2@gmail.com>

I'm trying to compile QGIS on OS X with Homebrew and create a Homebrew formula as a result.
I get an error when running make install:

-- Installing: /usr/local/Cellar/qgis-214/HEAD/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/plugins/GdalTools/./GdalTools.py
CMake Error at python/plugins/GdalTools/cmake_install.cmake:31 (file):
 file INSTALL cannot find
 "/tmp/qgis-21420160304-35396-19lc7z/build/python/plugins/GdalTools/resources_rc.py".
Call Stack (most recent call first):
 python/plugins/cmake_install.cmake:32 (include)
 python/cmake_install.cmake:143 (include)
 cmake_install.cmake:41 (include)

I guess this line in a MakeFile is causing the trouble:
PYQT_ADD_RESOURCES(PYRC_FILES resources.qrc)

Should the file be named resources.qrc or resources.rc?

When compiling 2.14 release, this same error looks slightly different (I guess fTools and GdalTools are virtually the same):

CMake Error at python/plugins/fTools/cmake_install.cmake:31 (file):
 file INSTALL cannot find
 "/tmp/qgis-21420160303-19666-1qyvi01/QGIS-release-2_14/build/python/plugins/fTools/resources_rc.py".
Call Stack (most recent call first):
 python/plugins/cmake_install.cmake:32 (include)
 python/cmake_install.cmake:143 (include)
 cmake_install.cmake:41 (include)

What should be changed to get rid of this error?

libreoffice has good dbf support.

Besides, it is really time to retire Shape files ... if we all focus on improving geopackage support we can soon have a real alternative.

Hello all,

There are lots of SVG files that do not seem to not render in the Print
Composer, and they are not visible in the display section of the items
properties.

Anyone confirm this?

Can confirm - I filed a bug report a few days ago -

I haven't checked any of my windows installs - just Ubuntu 15.10.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS crashes when doing a rollback after modifying
 values of an user-added feature with pyQGIS
Message-ID: <9C9E35A883C74941B55C4798458F250206D441BC98@WSMAILBOX.egmasa.es>

I'm developing an add-on for QGIS that needs to assign a UUID to any feature as soon as it is added to the layer.
I'm using the featureAdded signal to write the UUID in the corresponding field of the feature.

This is the code that I am using (as simplified as possible):

    def run(self):
        self.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer().featureAdded.connect(self._debug_onFeatureAdded)

    def _debug_onFeatureAdded(self, fid):
        layer = self.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
        layer.beginEditCommand("Set UUID")
        print layer.changeAttributeValue(fid, layer.fieldNameIndex('guid_pol'), 'some_random_uuid') # prints True
        layer.endEditCommand()

(I created a new plugin with the 'Plugin Builder' add-on and that above is the only code I have added to it.)

Unless I'm missing something, this follows the guidelines from the documentation in the QGIS developer cookbook: http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/vector.html#modifying-vector-layers-with-an-editing-buffer

When I edit the layer, if I add a feature the field 'guid_pol' is set to 'some_random_uuid' as expected. I can commit the changes without a problem, however if instead of committing the changes I try cancelling them QGIS crashes with error 0xC0000005 (Access Violation).

Interestingly, the command 'Set UUID' doesn't get added to the undo/redo stack (at least, not to the Undo/redo Panel) and if I try to undo it crashes as well.

I'm using QGIS 2.14 but I observed similar behaviour with QGIS 2.12.

I'm having a hard time getting this to work. Any help would be appreciated.

Yes, I can confirm this. I get the same problem with QGIS Master on 
Ubuntu 15.10 64 bit.

Apparently your flex is too old.  Not sure when those options were introduced.
I think the oldest version we use to build is 2.5.35 from Ubuntu precise.

I've had a look at this, and it was actually a really old commit which
caused it (12 Oct last year)... Strange that no one's picked this up before
now!

The fix will be for someone to implement http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13326,
and then get permission to backport this feature as a fix to 2.14.

I did some changes and recompiled the code but the same error still
persists.
After doing some reading and research I came to know the processing toolbox
do not support optional parameters (please correct me if I am wrong).

Then i thought of deleting this line from the code:link
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/description/v.reclass.txt#L5>
and recompiled it, but different from expected I still get the
argument (coloumn
name ) drop-down box in v.reclass function. Attached is the screenshot of
the option whose corresponding line is deleted.

Can you help me with that. :)

I saw the list of the projects and found them really interesting.

The first 3 are based on processing toolbox on which I am currently working
on and I am enjoying working on them and the last one is on importing OSM
data which was my last year’s GSOC project so it will be easy for me to
start working on it.

Please tell me your opinion on my interests and help me with choosing the
project.

And also could you provide me with some reading material so that I could
proceed in the same direction.

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi guys

I would like to use R scripts in  QGIS 2.12 from Kyngchaos and am unable to.

I have installed the R package from r-project, and all  dependencies.

When I run the R scripts that I have downloaded, I get the missing
dependency problem.

How do I go about rectifying it?

Hi,

I am wondering which QGIS version is current LTR.

Changelog says that 2.14 is LTR :
http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog214/

But QGIS home page says current LTR is 2.8.7 :
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/

Do I miss something ?

Sorry I didn't reply to your earlier email.

I think it depends on how your scripts interact with R.  I have an R plugin for the GDAL framework.  I also have an R plugin for the GEOS framework, but that's for an old version of R.

You can run R scripts from the Processing plugin, but I don't know how that links R and QGIS data unless it's through GDAL.

There is also rpy2 for using R from python, supposed to be a simple instal with pip, but requires Xcode tools to compile.  I have a package for an old R version, but I could update it.

2.14 becomes LTR when 2.16 is released, I believe. A chance for 2.14 to bed
in.

As a workaround fix before the implementation of that feature, could we add
some default values to the transparency values, as it was done with the
colors?

At the QGIS PT user group, I provide the old SVG files for people to use in
the meanwhile.

Unfortunately this is currently a limitation of our current editing
system... When an editing signal (like "featureAdded") is emitted,
doing some extra editing actions will corrupt the undo stack because
the undo command of the previous action is not yet finished. A
possible workaround could be to use queued signal/slot connection
instead of direct connection (which is the default), so the slot
execution will be delayed, and the undo stack will get to a consistent
state.

Hi,

I know it's very early after release but I was wondering if we can do a
2.14.1 release.  There was a major bug in SQL Server causing labels,
attribute tables, features forms, etc to all play up.

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14402

As there is a lot of SQL Server users this is a pretty major thing to not
have working.

If there is some resourcing that needs to happen for a 2.14.1 release let
me know and I will see what I can do.

Regards,
Nathan

Just a note - I'd appreciate a day or so warning before a .1 release -
I'll see what kind of workarounds I can do for the composer svg issue
(unless someone wants to volunteer to fix this properly by

Here's a PR which fixes it:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2876

But it's also a feature, so not sure if it's suitable for backporting
to 2.14. In any case extensive testing would be very much appreciated!

One last thing... since this switches the composer picture to use the
SVG cache for rendering svg files, it opens the composer up to
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13565. I'm not sure if that's an issue or
not.

Feedback welcome!

Hi Nyall, 

The SVG cache problem is a minor issue in my opinion. I'd rather have
SVG files render correctly in print composer and support overriding of
graphics properties. 

Thanks a lot for researching/dealing with this!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Can not Run function when item selected in comboBox
Message-ID: <56DD30A5.90208@gmail.com>

Dear list,

I'm writing a plugin, I want to change the content of a comboBox 
(fields) depending of the content of another comboBox (layers).

My plugin is a dockwidget. I can populate the fields comboBox just 
starting the plugin in the /def run(self):/ function, and it's working fine:

|layerNom =self.dockwidget.comboBoxErrores.currentText() #Getthe text 
value of the comboBox forlyr 
inQgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers().values():#Get layers 
iflyr.name()==str(layerNom):fields =lyr.pendingFields()#Get 
Fielsfield_names =[field.name()forfield infields]#Field 
Listself.dockwidget.comboCampos.addItems(field_names)#Add to the comboBox|

But when I try to update the content of the fields comboBox I really 
don't know how to do it.

In my "pluginName_dockwidget.py" file, in the *init* function I have 
created the connection with the function that will repopulate the 
comboBox with the new content:

|self.comboBoxErrores.currentIndexChanged['QString'].connect(self.pueblaCampos)|

In the same file I have a function that get the value of the layer name 
of the comboBox and emit it with the signal created previously:

|sennalComboIndex =pyqtSignal(str)...defpueblaCampos(self):layerName 
=self.comboBoxErrores.currentText()self.sennalComboIndex.emit(layerName)|

In my main file, I have the rest of the function:

|defpueblaCampos(self,layerName):forlyr 
inQgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers().values():iflyr.name()==str(layerName):fields 
=lyr.pendingFields()field_names =[field.name()forfield 
infields]self.dockwidget.comboCampos.clear()self.dockwidget.comboCampos.addItems(field_names)|

When I change the slected item in the layers comboBox, nothing happens. 
What Am I missing?

Ask for more detail info if you think it's needed. Thank you very much!!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing algorithms and API breaks
Message-ID: <CALuHMPBO8aJoZygpzg07qryiKTHfO_x-R+Tx7ffvj8uubs5Z0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Processing, became an important part of QGIS. More and more users use it
and rely on it, especially when they developed their own models and scripts.
So we should keep Processing algorithms as stable as possible and don't
change their descriptions.

On other hand there are many bugreports and feature requests which require
changing algorithms description to be fixed/impelemented. This can be considired
as "API" break, as scripts and models which use affected algorithms
and were developed before such changes will not work. For example,
there were many
PR about fixing GRASS and SAGA algs, which change their descriptions. Time
from time we also fix bugs in native QGIS algs and also need to change
algorithm description, e.g. by replacing one parameter type with another or
adding new parameter.

I see only two solutions:
1. Postpone such changes for next major QGIS release when API break is
allowed. In this case all existing scripts/models will work. But we
should live
with bugs and without some features, even if fix already available and keep the
code of this fixes in sync with master until next major release.
2. Allow "API" breaks in Processing. In this case we create additional pressure
on the authors of 3rd party models/scripts and force them to follow Processing
changes and update their code accordingly.

What do you think, which approach we should choose?

I would say that the "agrresive" approach (introducing API breaks
without waiting for next version) is a better option. Changes are
small and will be easy to adapt to (in most cases, it will happen that
an algorithm that changes is not used in any model, or just by a
handful of users). So the improvement-vs-annoyment ratio is high...

My 2 cents

Hi Manuel,

I struggled with a similar problem.  Another possible workaround is waiting until the user has saved their edits.  You can then catch the commitedFeaturesAdded signal and update the layer directly using the provider.  This method has the advantage that the fid that refers to the feature at this stage is the final one and does not change.

See this Stack Overflow page for more info:

Unfortunately this is currently a limitation of our current editing
system... When an editing signal (like "featureAdded") is emitted,
doing some extra editing actions will corrupt the undo stack because
the undo command of the previous action is not yet finished. A
possible workaround could be to use queued signal/slot connection
instead of direct connection (which is the default), so the slot
execution will be delayed, and the undo stack will get to a consistent
state.

Martin

Hi,

I once improved an algorithm but rolled it back afterwards because of [1]
So I fear that users become frustrated easily if things break every now 
and then which has further disadvantages:
1) QGIS (processing) is perceived as being unreliable
2) there will be tickets to be coped with addressing these issues

Nevertheless I would vote in favor of the "aggressive approach" but this 
has to be clearly communicated.

Agreed. IMHO it's mainly a matter of communicating to users.
All the best.

Hi Alex,

Thanks for raising this issue. I also think that the interface to the
processing algorithms should stay as stable as possible, but slowing
down development speed also does not sound very appealing.

Isn't it often possible to add a new parameter as optional with a
default value that conforms to the previous behavior? If developers keep
an eye on keeping their changes compatible this way, that should already
help a lot.

Another idea is that the algorithms are versioned, so that with
incompatible changes an old model can still use the old algorithm. I can
imagine that the maintenance overhead for this is a bit high. The
lightweight approach for this can be done ad-hoc when introducing an
algorithm with a new name and keeping the old one in place.

Hi Matthias,

when new parameter added and it is possible to declare it as optional,
I definitely do this. But sometimes parameters also removed or replaced
with another (e.g. string with point, or several numbers with extent). In
such cases algorithm semantic changes.

Regarding versioning. Victor and me already discussed this approach.
Seems this can help with 3rd party models/scripts. Maybe we will work
on this at hackfest.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] create geometry less memory layer
Message-ID: <56DD632C.4090406@gmail.com>

Hi all,
a very simple question (which I cannot find an answer). Is it possible
to create a geometry less memory layer?

In both cookbook there are all the 'geometric' options available for the
memory provider (Point, line, polygon and their multi part options) but
not a 'table' option.

Thanks

Best,

Matteo

I did some changes and recompiled the code but the same error still
persists.
After doing some reading and research I came to know the processing toolbox
do not support optional parameters (please correct me if I am wrong).

Then i thought of deleting this line from the code:link
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/description/v.reclass.txt#L5>
and recompiled it, but different from expected I still get the
argument (coloumn
name ) drop-down box in v.reclass function. Attached is the screenshot of
the option whose corresponding line is deleted.

Can you help me with that. :)

I saw the list of the projects and found them really interesting.

The first 3 are based on processing toolbox on which I am currently working
on and I am enjoying working on them and the last one is on importing OSM
data which was my last year’s GSOC project so it will be easy for me to
start working on it.

Please tell me your opinion on my interests and help me with choosing the
project.

And also could you provide me with some reading material so that I could
proceed in the same direction.

Looking forward to your reply.

Cheers,
Sarthak

To me it looks like it will be still available in repo, but it is

Hi Richard,

FYI, I am currently working on getting a python3, pyqt5 and qt5 travis
build running (need to build lots of dependencies myself because travis
still runs 12.04 with very old deps).
If everything goes well, that should be ready this week (fingers
crossed) and then we can run some scripts that allow to update the
current codebase to be compatible with everything (py2 and py3, qt4 and
qt5) and everybody will be happy and distros can ship whatever they want
and we are prepared :-)

Cheers
Matthias

Hi Matteo, 

Which version of QGIS? 

Starting from 2.14 you can uncheck the checkbox "Geometry tpye and CRS"
and the result will be a scratch layer without geometry. After creation,
you can add additional attribute columns. 

Hope this helps, 

Andreas

awesome! I didn't know that!

Is there also a way with python trough QgsVectorLayer to do that?

Use "none" as geometry type:

QgsVectorLayer("none", "layer", "memory")

Subject: [Qgis-developer] symbolForFeature(feat) causes minidump in
	converted 2.5d layers
Message-ID: <1457364923006-5254907.post@n6.nabble.com>

The following code works for a layer which has the 2.5d renderer selected:

feats = layer.getFeatures()
for feat in feats:
    symbol = layer.rendererV2().symbolForFeature(feat)

This still works if I change the layer to a single symbol renderer. However,
if I change it to a categorized symbol renderer, and classify on one field
(random colours, nothing else in the style changed from the 2.5d), the last
line above causes a mindump.

Can anyone help?

Hi everyone,

I had build Qgis successfully using source code 2.8.3 in visual studio 2010.

Now i want to create exe of this built.

Hello,

I am in my sophomore year pursuing Btech and MS in CSE from IIIT-Hyderabad,
India.
I am good at C/C++, python, hrml, css, JS and mysql.
I am interested in the following project:

   - Improve and cleanup QGIS Algorithms in proccessing

I also had a Data Structure and Algorithms course, so I think this project
will be good for me.
It would be great if someone could tell me how to get started.

Regards,
Dhruv Khattar

Hi

Also I guess it won’t be much of a hardship to just make it a QGIS package dependency - I think they are only thinking of removing it from the default install, not from the repos themselves.

Hi

Personally, while I like new features, I would really like to encourage you to find a way to maintain a stable environment for processing users. For users of single algorithms the issue is probably less noticeable (although event then small changes may mean updating documented workflows etc.). But for users with complex models it is a real pain if their models break from version of version of process.  So finding some way to support ‘write once, work always’ for processing is I think really important if you want people to broadly adopt it for all the powerful things it can do.

Regards

Tim

I honestly think 1 is the only valid approach here.

I'll preface this opinion by saying that I HATE frozen API with a
passion. It makes development harder, slower and more expensive, and
prevents new features landing and bugs from being fixed [1]. With my
totally selfish developer hat on I'd love nothing more than for us to
adopt a non-frozen, do-whatever-the-heck-you-want API and with no care
for compatibility with old projects ;)

BUT

The decision has been made for the project that QGIS has a frozen API
between major releases, and now that processing is part of the core
QGIS install it also needs to abide by that rule! Yes, it's a freaking
horrible PITA, but the alternative (breaking user's scripts and
models) is far worse for the project. And with my non-developer, QGIS
user hat on I would hate for scripts and models which I've invested
time into creating to get broken between releases.

I'd suggest following the same approach as is taken by the c++ code:
make a versioned copy of the algorithm so that existing scripts/models
can still use the old version BUT it's not exposed anywhere in the GUI
and new models will transparently just use the new version. That's
what we've done for labelling (heck... even the old label engine is
STILL in QGIS on that extremely rare case that someone opens a pre 2.0
project!), symbology, various composer items, etc. It results in
duplicate code and fills the codebase with a lot of deprecated cruft,
but that's the price of a frozen API :)

Just my 2c! ;)

Hi Tim, Nyall,
while in principle I agree, I think this would be rather pointless in the current situation.
Many algs break often anyway because of changes in the backends. My suggestion:
" first put in place a complete set of tests
* only after that implement a versioning system
* provide clear instructions, possibly also tools, to help upgrading models to new versions (only power users actually build models).
IMHO a current major stumbling block for users is the lack of documentation for hundreds of algs, many of them quite obscure. Better address this first.
All the best.

Hi Tim, Nyall,

I understand your points. While new features in most cases can wait
for next major version, do we really want to miss bugfixes, especially
for algorithms, which depends on 3rd party backends, e.g. SAGA or
GRASS [0]? BTW, most PR with such fixes contributed by community
members. I'm afraid if PR will be unmerged for a long time, we will
distract users from further contributions.

I don't know how many users create models and scripts, but in our
QGIS-Processing repo there are only small number of them. Maybe
this is because nobody wants to create scripts/models because
of unstable Processing API. But also this is can be an indicator that
very limited number of users create scripts/models.

Not sure if complete test coverage is possible. There are more that
200 algs only in SAGA backend (and I don't take in account different
SAGA versions)

> * only after that implement a versioning system

IMHO versioning make sence only for 3rd party scripts/models. If we will
version Processing algs, we quickly end up with a mess, as each commit
which fixes alg will produce new alg version inside same Processing version.
So, for example, inside QGIS 2.16 we will have Processing 2.16, some algs
just with 2.16.0 version and multiple versions of other algorithms, e.g 2.16.0,
2.16.1, 2.16.2 and so on.

Documentation is another importand topic. There is some movement in this
direction, but again unfortunately we can not cover all Processing algs with
documentation. Reusing existing documentaion (e.g GDAL, SAGA, GRASS)
can help, but as many Processing algs implement only subset of options or
even split one tool into multiple... existing documentation does not match
Processing algorthm

I think this can be done if we:
* reuse as much of the existing docs as possible (done for grass and
gdal, TBD for saga)
* allow power users to add their content, possibly also small images, in
an easy way.
There was some succesfull attempt at the beginning, by Matteo Ghetta (48
saga algs, if I remember correctly), but unfortunately this work seems
to have been lost.
All the best.

That's what we started with. I do not why Matteo work was apparently

Hi Paolo,

That would be nice to include, thanks for pointing out.
Do you know if they require us to do anything to acknowledge their work?
On the page they state

These are "free for use". Whenever possible please  credit as follows:
“Source: OCHA & MapAction".

I think it would be good talking to them and ask if this can be added to
the visual changelog or if something more is required (like a note on
the style page where the icons appear).

Matthias

Thank you very much for your help!
I'm going to make a research about "queued signal/slot connection instead of direct connection" since that is completely new for me :-)
Meanwhile, now that I know the reason of the error, my workaround consists in delaying the handling of the feature addition using the editCommandEnded slot. This is the relevant code:
      
def onFeatureAdded(self, fid):
    if fid < 0:
        self._addedFeatures.append(fid)

def onEditCommandEnded(self):
    while self._addedFeatures:
        fid = self._addedFeatures.pop()
        self._handleAdded(fid)

def _handleAdded(self, fid):
    guid_pol = str(uuid4()) # RFC 4122 UUID v4
    try:
        self.layer.beginEditCommand(u"Assign UUID")
        self.layer.changeAttributeValue(fid, self.layer.fieldNameIndex('guid_pol'), guid_pol)
        self.layer.endEditCommand()
    except:
        self.layer.destroyEditCommand()
        raise

So far seems to work.

Unfortunately this is currently a limitation of our current editing system... When an editing signal (like "featureAdded") is emitted, doing some extra editing actions will corrupt the undo stack because the undo command of the previous action is not yet finished. A possible workaround could be to use queued signal/slot connection instead of direct connection (which is the default), so the slot execution will be delayed, and the undo stack will get to a consistent state.

Martin

Asked. Will let you know the outcome.
BTW, I have opened a ticket with several other nice sets, but I cannot
find it back now (never liked Redmine, yes).

that's exactly where we started..
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/tree/master/source/docs/user_manual/processing_algs

with the new help tabs some help files have been lost.. at least all the
SAGA ones (not many, but some of them have been documented)

IMHO, a single and easy editable github page for the algorithm is the
best solution.
We can also think to add some pictures to show in a super immediate way
to the user what the algorithm does.

For the backends (always IMHO :) ):

* GRASS is perfect with its own guides
* GDAL/OGR algorithms are redirected to their homepage.. super
documented with all the additional parameters but not so comfortable for
the user
* OTB super nice
* SAGA super painful..

If we find a way I can contribute by adding some help of the main modules..

Actually, something is better than nothing..

Cheers,

Matteo

It happened this morning, on 3 different machines.
Should we try again?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Inconsistent WFS layer requests
Message-ID: <C6BE00E0E4E1A547B4E1E360B18256D784A1DE14@NPT-EXCH2010P1.neath-porttalbot.gov.uk>

Hi

I am trying to troubleshoot a problem we're having with a WFS service in QGIS 2.14. I am loading in a layer with 'Only request features overlapping the current view extent' and have tried cached and uncached. The layer loads only 1 feature and that is not within the map canvas. I have used Wireshark to capture the requests and can see that QGIS is making the GetFeature request with no bbox parameter and a maxfeatures parameter set to 1.

In QGIS 2.12.2 the GetFeature request with no bbox and maxfeatures=1 is still made but then it is followed up with another GetFeature request with the correct bbox and all features are loaded onto the layer as expected. I am wondering if the maxfeatures=1 request is a probe to test that valid features are being returned before making the proper request but in 2.14 the proper request never gets sent. Looking at the layer metadata in QGIS the layer source shows the correct request URL.

It's confusing as we have other WFS services which are working fine in 2.14. If I can narrow the issue down to being a problem with the service itself I can approach the supplier.

It's a commercial WFS but if anyone is able to test I can provide the connection URL.

Below are details of the packets being sent from QGIS.

Thanks very much

Tom

I got that far, but xxxx had me baffled. What is a QgsRenderContext, and do I
need an existing or a new one in this case? If an existing one, how do I
retrieve it?

This is where the API docs are no use, in my opinion: for high-level
descriptions of classes. One has to rely on someone having blogged about the
less common ones, I find.

Thanks again for the help.

I don’t want to miss bug fixes, but I’d also like to see an architecture in place that limits how bug fixes break existing workflows. In core we manage that by making small wrappers around new methods to keep old API methods working. If a bug fix breaks something else that used to work isn’t the net gain zero? If the bug fix fixes something and doesn’t break something else then the net gain is 1 (good!).

I think think a more likely hypothesis is that most models are probably highly specific to individual peoples workflows and not good candidates for general sharing.

Just to clarify my previous posting, I am not against doing some big overhaul to improve the situation but I would prefer to see that it :

a) happens with 3.0 when we are breaking a bunch of stuff anyway and
b) moves in a direction where the underlying architecture is able to provide a longer term stability of algorithm interfaces so that we can provide our users with some assurance that the work they do today won’t be undone tomorrow.

If the backend provider changes are causing our processing stuff to break, surely having some middleware in place to translate new backend interfaces to expose their inputs and results so that they function like the old interfaces on the user facing side of the algorithm should give us a way to deal with that?

Thanks for all the great work you guys are doing with processing, I don’t mean to detract from your efforts, only to lend a sense of user perspective to your planning.

Regards

Tim

Hi,

I know it's a pain but this bug with SQL Server in 2.14 is going to hurt a
lot of people that update which use SQL Server, which is most clients of
mine.  I also have a QGIS presentation next week for 100 or so people so it
would be good to be able to tell them a plan.

Mainly just looking for a plan on when we can do a 2.14.1. Work has told me
I can allocate my time as needed on QGIS so I'm happy to help fix any bugs
found for 2.14.1 if that speeds up the process.

Regards,

Maybe that's a good opportunity to be encourage people to test before the
release. ;)

2.14.1 is scheduled for 25.03.2016.  And in the meantime there are the
nightlies of 2.14.  Isn't that enough?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Usability of searches
Message-ID: <56DFF6E5.5050102@faunalia.it>

Hi all,

perhaps I'm missing something, but I find usability of current search
mechanism a bit cumbersome. AFAICT, to search a set of features, the
user should:
* select on the legend the layer to be searched
* open the attribute table
* select the Column filter button, selecting one column
* insert the condition
* click Apply
* click on Zoom to selection.
Alternatively, one can use the Select by expression tool.
Is there a more straightforward way?

I would suggest a simpler mechanism:
* click on a dedicated Search button
* select the layer to be searched from a dropdown of the layers in legend
* show a form (with the dropdowns etc., as defined for the layer) where
the user can select or type (with autocompletion and automatic selection
of ranges) the search criteria
* automatically zoom to selected items.

Alternatively:
* add a Search entry for each layer, besides the Filter one, in the
legend > Right click.

Would this make sense?

All the best.

Hi Jürgen -

The 64 bit version of the OSGEO4W distribution doesn't include the 
apt-get package. Is it possible for you to include it ?
In a test situation it would be really handy to do something like this:
http://nathanw.net/2013/05/03/installing-qgis-using-apt-on-windows-osgeo4w/
(Which rely on apt-get)

(And an apology to Jürgen for first sending this posting to his private 
email instead of the QGIS developer list)

Regards
Bo Victor Thomsen

Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP57262F313AA332861522D0A7B30@phx.gbl>

Hi all,
after a fresh install of W10, I'm not able to install QGIS without 
having the "Missing entry point..." (see attachment) error.
In the past I already had frequent errors with qgis-bin.exe icon being 
obliged to change path to qgis.bat, but with this error it's the first 
time. I saw that even with past releases there have been some cases 
(e.g. minoru).

I tried both Osgeo installers (32/64) on W10 64 bits (in the 32 bit 
version it calls ...\bin\qgis_app.dll)

is there any suggestion on how to solve? shall I open a ticket?
I'm actually without any possibility to use qgis

Thank you in advance!

all the best,

Niccolò

Hey Jurgen,

Thanks. Yeah I know it was annoying that it slipped though testing, bound
to happen at times.  I guess that is why Nyall followed with a unit test.

Thanks for the date.  That is enough for me to put on the slides and tell
clients.

Well, I normally use the select by expression button, which (obviously) 
saves a lot of clicks

I would vote against this because
1) it breaks with the standard behaviour "make layer active - press 
button for action with this layer" (information button, make-editable 
button...)
2) with many layers in the project you will hate it :-)

I implemented these in my plugin DataDrivenInputMask (for PostGIS layers 
only) on a user request, and I use it a lot, so I reckon this would be 
interesting for other users (and data providers), too

+1 (a lot better than the universal search button and in line with e.g. 
the make-editable button)

You can also do that using osgeo4w-setup.exe:

osgeo4w-setup --arch x86_64 --advanced --root d:\your-osgeo4w --local-package-dir %TEMP%\osgeo4w --site http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w --autoaccept --quiet-mode --packages qgis-dev

(Parameter descriptions and more parameters see osgeo4w-setup --help)

Hi Paolo,

I wouldn't say it is bad usability that you have to go through the 
attribute table to search for features - because usually you want to see 
the results in the table or form anyway - or you want to do something 
with the filtered or selected features - such as viewing or modifying 
their attributes.

For QGIS 2.16, Nyall will work on the multi-attribute editor and there 
will also be search directly from multiple attributes in the form. So 
there is already work going on for improving search from the form with 
multiple attributes. If you have any input on that, please tell us.¨

There are quicker ways to get on the bright side.  That would be a pretty long
detour. ;)

Users working on an highly predictable environment (a vertical solution,
with a few tables they work on for years) will certainly find this useless.

Great news. Do you have a plan to share? Will this solution be much
different from what Bernhard and me suggested?

All the best, and thanks.

I just created a new issue on Github for Nathans ascii gis:

and was able to add a zip file of 4 Mb to the issue in Github!

I think not being able to add test data to an issue was (besides the
migration of the issues) one of the problems we had with moving to github?

Hi Paolo,

The multi-attribute edit is already specified and ordered - I am copying 
from the quote below:

==================
*
****Proposal – Allow simultaneous editing of attributes for multiple 
features through the attribute table**“form” view*

*Background*
Currently, QGIS attribute form only supports graphical editing of the 
attributes for one feature at a time.
There is no way to set the attributes for multiple features at once 
through the form view. Limited editing
for multiple features can be achieved using the “merge selected feature 
attributes” tool, but this tool is
geared toward statistical calculation for multiple feature attributes 
and it is cumbersome to edit large
amounts of attributes using this tool. Furthermore, the tool only 
provides for simple “text entry” of
attributes, and cannot be used with all the advanced editor widgets 
which are possible to use in QGIS
attribute forms (eg date/time widgets, relation widgets, unique value 
widgets, etc).

*Proposal*

Implement a multi-edit mode for QGIS attribute table “form” view, where:

  * Multiedit mode is initiated from the form through a “Multiedit”
    button on the attribute table toolbar. It will work on the existing
    selection done through the general QGIS selection tools.
  * When multi-edit mode is activated, QGIS will scan all selected
    feature to determine whether each feature holds different values for
    a given attribute or whether all features have the same value.
  * If an attribute holds mixed values across the selection, the widgets
    will be update to reflect this. For widget types where it is
    applicable (Eg text edits), the initial value for the widget will be
    set to “mixed values”. Other widget types may indicate this state in
    different ways, eg for checkbox widgets the mixed values state will
    be indicated by the “partially checked” state. This will not be
    possible for all widget types, eg sliders and dials. For these
    widgets the value from the first selected feature will be shown instead.
  * For all widget types, when in multi-edit mode, a tool button with
    icon will be shown to the right of the widget. Initially, the button
    will show an icon indicating whether the selection has mixed values
    for the field (possibly the mathematical “not equal” symbol). If the
    field does not have mixed values, a tick icon will be shown instead.
    When the field has mixed values in the selection, clicking the
    button will show a popup-menu with a single action “Set [field name]
    for all selected features”. Activating this action will force the
    field value for all selected features to match the current widget value.
  * When the value for a widget is changed, the icon next to the widget
    will change to a “!” alert icon. The tooltip for this icon will show
    “Value for [field name] for all selected features will be
    overridden”. Clicking the button when in this state will show a
    popup menu with a single item “Reset to original values”.
  * Read-only widgets will stay disabled in the form and will never be
    changed. These widgets will either be shown in their “mixed value”
    state, or the value for the first selected feature if no mixed-state
    exists.
  * When saving multi-edits, only attributes that have a changed widget
    state (“!” icon) will be applied. Attributes which remain at their
    mixed value state will not be altered. Before applying the new
    attributes for all selected records the user has to confirm that
    they really want to change the attributes for all selected records
    and changed widgets.
  * All changes will be applied as a single edit command, so pressing
    undo will revert all changes made to all selected features at once.
  * The attribute table section (left panel) of the dual-view dialog
    will be active while multi-editing features. If the selection
    changes, the user will be prompted to save any current changes made
    to the previous selection.


*Important Notes on the Proposed Changes*

  * Multi-edit mode will only be enabled for auto-generated and drag and
    drop forms. Custom forms will not be supported, due to the extra
    complexity added by custom layouts and python logic which could be
    present in these forms.
  * “Relation reference” widgets will be editable in multi-edit mode,
    however “relation editor widgets” will NOT be editable whilst in
    multi-edit mode.
  * The proposed changes will be accompanied by regression unit tests
    covering the non-GUI portion of the changes to ensure that they are
    stable and will not break in future QGIS releases.

This project will be financed by the Kanton Basel Stadt in Switzerland.

===================

For multi-attribute search/selection/filtering there is only a very 
rudimentary idea yet - you can help finalize the specification: see 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBis2-WM95PJEKJ-V9VA4NDx_kyHFWAsoLfl2s-MApw/edit?usp=sharing 


For now you can view and comment the document. If you want to help edit, 
please let Denis or me know and we can add you to the list of accounts 
who can edit the document.

Hi,
Thanks for this new feature which will help most of us.

> The proposed changes will be accompanied by regression unit tests
covering the non-GUI portion of the changes to ensure that they are stable
and will not break in future QGIS releases.

What about documentation? Given that there are many cases/combinations of
the behaviour of the tool, it might be interesting to have them documented
in QGIS doc (within the quote).

DelazJ

This is geat news!
I think that this solves the biggest issue we discussed in Las Palmas.
I would suggest to put as soon as possible Redmine in read only mode
and start using right away the github bugtracker. We can then also
migrate all the wiki pages.

cheers!

Huh?  Didn't we discuss other platforms to solve this?  I thought the biggest
problem was to migrate the tickets.

Do we have a plan to try not breaking tickets references in commit
entries ? Any idea on how to handle this issue ?

There were some ideas, but I think nobody did the effort to successfully
test them.

FYI, we already have 2892 collisions (e.g. #777 [1], [2]) now. And they
are getting more and more.

Some were proposing to use github API to port all the issues to github
using the same order.
Since github uses the same increment for issues and PR, we would only
miss references to the first 3000 issues (which would point to existing
PRs).

Hence, the idea would be to port issues from number_of_github_PR + 1.

Hi DelazJ, 

I am not the contracting organization - so I can't decide on the
documentation. I would assume though that it will be quite logical/self
explanatory to use. I think it sounds more complicated in the
specification than it will be to use ;-)

I believe it would require a final approval of moving to github.
There were some voices (not mine ;) ) against it!

>From my understanding in Las Palmas, the idea was
* move to github if we can port
* updagre redmine otherwise

Moving the whole code hosting was discouraged because many plugins are
hosted on github, people have their account there and so on.

I'm sorry, I'm -1 for this.
The GSOC project should offer something interesting, scalable and
visible as instead of working on the development infrastructure. I am
afraid that this job is rather small and will not help a participant to
get to know our codebase and get some traction within the project.

I would do the migration if I would care for the migration.
But as said before, my proposal would be:
 1. make redmine readonly for reference
 2. enable issue tracking github
 3. enjoy the clean slate

I've shortly tested some migration scripts (just after Las Palmas), but
those failed because of (I think) an older (api) version of our Redmine
install...

For recurrent searches on a project, Quick Search Plugin can very handy.
You can set it to search in specific layers as fields.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] make install fails on GdalTools/resources_rc.py
Message-ID: <FBD7AF16-EA65-424E-92FF-210456EFCDA2@gmail.com>

I'm trying to compile QGIS on OS X with Homebrew and create a Homebrew formula as a result.
I get an error when running make install:

-- Installing: /usr/local/Cellar/qgis-214/HEAD/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/plugins/GdalTools/./GdalTools.py
CMake Error at python/plugins/GdalTools/cmake_install.cmake:31 (file):
file INSTALL cannot find
"/tmp/qgis-21420160304-35396-19lc7z/build/python/plugins/GdalTools/resources_rc.py".
Call Stack (most recent call first):
python/plugins/cmake_install.cmake:32 (include)
python/cmake_install.cmake:143 (include)
cmake_install.cmake:41 (include)

I guess this line in a MakeFile is causing the trouble:
PYQT_ADD_RESOURCES(PYRC_FILES resources.qrc)

Should the file be named resources.qrc or resources.rc?

When compiling 2.14 release, this same error looks slightly different (I guess fTools and GdalTools are virtually the same):

CMake Error at python/plugins/fTools/cmake_install.cmake:31 (file):
file INSTALL cannot find
"/tmp/qgis-21420160303-19666-1qyvi01/QGIS-release-2_14/build/python/plugins/fTools/resources_rc.py".
Call Stack (most recent call first):
python/plugins/cmake_install.cmake:32 (include)
python/cmake_install.cmake:143 (include)
cmake_install.cmake:41 (include)

My assumption is that resources_rc.py file doesn’t get build in both cases. Can I change something in Makefile to get it built before installing?

Thanks Alexandre. I'm aware of the plugin. I just think this should be a
core functionality, and there should not be need for a configuration.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,
 very interesting topic. 
IMHO, a good generic place or feature finder could be a native plugin or
native feature. 

Just to share some ideas, please find here a video demonstration of our
internal place finder. 3

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ1uCb6DxrA
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ1uCb6DxrA>  

The plugin is a close cousin of Nominatim search place plugin, but we
plugged it on internal postgis database, and we enable full text search so
that it can search in different tables at a time (ie, hydrography entry
looks for lakes, or rivers, or underground waters.. )

what does it do?:

 - Sends a sql query to postgis that returns a set of objects with ID,
source table, geometry
- Displays results in the list with ordering by pertinence (can be raw fts
or a mix with geographical size. An administrative region will be shown
before a very small place name)
- on mouse hover, we display a rubberband so that user can see where is the
result
- on double click, zoom to the place
- an option allows to filter result falling in map extent only
- output options can produe different memory layers (a layer with the
object, a layer calling mask plugin to highlight that place only)

One could imagine having an internal sqlite db with full text search
enabled, and a config panel to collect layer objects and fields to index,
push it into sqlite DB, and then activat a similar search panel)

We can share source code (but it requires some code tweaking to plug it on
another database)

my two cents. 

Régis

Quite interesting, thanks. This confirms me that the need for simpler
query is shared, so I'd be in favour of adding something similar to core.
Does anyone have a good example of the UX from other software we could
adhere to?
All the best.

The best UI for search is the simplest.. Google does that well :). A simple
text widget, and filtering options in the results (facets / coloring) is
enough I think. All the intelligence must be in the indexing full text
search engine IMHO, not in the UI. 
 Why not a bar, just like command line bar of Processing + a shortcut to
raise it ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin translation
Message-ID: <56E196A1.6030902@gmail.com>

Hi all,
I did not found something in the pyqgis cookbook so I'll ask here.

I'd like to translate my own plugin in some languages. This are the the
steps I made (plugin has been built with the plugin builder):

* in the i18n folder I have created a my_plugin.pro file
* run lupdate my_plugin.pro to generate the my_plugin.ts file
* translated some string with Qt Linguist
* run lrelease my_plugin.ts to generate the my_plugin.qm file
* recompile the plugin: pyrcc4 -o resources_rc.py resources.qr

* in QGIS I have the language options in the same language of the
translated file (so locale setting are overwritten)

But the plugin UIs and menu are still in English, so translations are
not taken into account.

Am I missing something?

Thanks to all


Best

Matteo

Like always, my fault.. in the my_plugin.py under the locale settings
there was a capitalized letter..

Anyway, can I add a small section to the cookbook on how the developer
can generate the pro, ts, and qm file?

Is it worth it?

Cheers and sorry again for the noise..

Hi Matteo,

yes, please. I've done this myself for 2 plugins and I always have to
try some things out. It would be great (for others) if you write down
something. Also because the average plugin writer probably do not even
know what *.pro, *.ts and *.qm files are :-)

Thanks in advance!

Regards,

Richard

A big +1 from me. These steps are not really easy to figure out. I'd have
liked to have such documentation available when I also translated my plugin.
This will also encourage multilingual plugins
Thanks Matteo

I'd really like to know about this. Are these commands in the OSGeo shell? In
other words, will it work on Windows? I stripped out the translation code
from plugin builder after I could not get the translation test to pass
Travis, but ideally, I'd like to add it back in.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Ubuntu build dependencies
Message-ID: <56E1B803.4040303@adtechgeospatial.com>

Using sudo apt-get build-dep qgis finds/installs many dependencies but 
there were still some missing like libqca2-dev and libqca-plugin-ossl.

Running ccmake, /usr/lib/libqscintilla2.so is not found.  What package 
is this in?

A while back, someone pointed us to a page that had QGIS dependencies 
for different versions of Ubuntu but I seem to have lost the link.

Is there some simple place to figure out how to get all needed 
dependencies and to set various ccmake values that need to be added/set?

Also I think they will anyway fail because Pull Requests occupy the same numbering space as issues in GitHub so you won’t be able to allocate the same ticket numbers.

The only reason I can see that people might have for not moving to GitHub is that the GitHub platform is not FOSS. Personally I don’t think that is enough reason not to take advantage of the platform that GitHub provides. While of course it would be nicer if it was FOSS, I think the benefits provided by GitHub outweigh the cons. Were there any other noteworthy reasons?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with GRASS Region Extent and Region
	Cellsize on Processing
Message-ID: <CAMCJChtZA8SSnoR7t6gFApFMj5Bnp93B5F6hmhe1RYU-V8nGUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been doing some tests on Processing and found something strange with
the GRASS tools, using GRASS Region Extent and Region Cellsize options.

These options work well when doing an operation that aligns the result to a
raster with a smaller extent. Please see this screencast:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5772257/qgis/Processing_grass_region.ogv

The result is perfectly aligned with the base raster.

However, doing the reverse, i.e., performing an operation on a raster,
aligning it to a raster with a greater extent, and a lower resolution, the
resolution fits well, but the pixels are not aligned. It seems that has an
offset exactly the equivalent of half the pixel size. In fact, the
resulting raster gets a greater extent than the reference, by the
equivalent of half the pixel size. Take a look here:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5772257/qgis/processing_grass_region_desviation_half_pixel.avi

I've tested and this happens both on Linux and Windows.

Could this be a bug? In which tool?

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro

Message-ID: <CA+Ei1OdtnsPUuxRTkfJQ1O5r6nRA99d3kPjRKwBwP=9xbcBQXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

recently I installed QGIS on Windows to test GRASS 7 support. To my
surprise QGIS put 5(!) icons to my deskop. I don't know any program
which installs so many icons to the desktop. Even program such ArcGIS
puts only one icon ;-) I wouldn't be surprised that some newcomers can
be confused when trying to understand which icon to use the first time
;-)

BTW, uninstall procedure do not remove these icons from desktop.

Hi Martin,

I think this was discussed in January here[1].  I don't know what came 
out of that discussion though.  Even though I am aware of the importance 
of good docs explaining these icons, in this case for new users on a 
Windows system, sitting in a confusing long workshop, one single icon to 
"QGIS Desktop 2.14.2" would be very pleasing, for both the workshop 
instructors and attendees.

(I remained quiet on this issue earlier because I didn't want to seem 
negative, ha)

That because we repackage OSGeo4W packages for the standalone installer and
their postinstall scripts install the icons.  So you also get icons for GRASS
and SAGA for instance.  Not sure if that's bad.

That might be because the packages' preremove scripts don't remove the icons in
OSGeo4W either.

+1 for this as an issue. Adding icons to the desktop should be optional.
Also, on Windows, the OSGeo installer leaves a folder with a very
non-user-friendly name ("http%" something or other).

In my memory the reasons were:

-1- the effort of migration from redmine to github (including links to
issues, mapping osgeo-users to github users etc)

-2- the fact that we could not attach data to an issue

-3- the fact that github is not FOSS itself

Current status:

Point 2 is not valid anymore.

Point 3: stays valid but as our source is already in github we could in
my view also do the issues there. IF needed it is easier to move from
Github to for example GitLab (= FOSS) easier (as the latter provides a
good migration path ...)

Point 1: migration is hard. Other projects also choose to enjoy a clean
sheet ( as Matthias calls it :-) ).

So we can discuss is here a little more and try to force a decisions
next PSC meeting (21) ... ?

About migration, or at least migrate as much as possible, what about the
following plan:

- make redmine read-only (note that we run an older (some say vulnerable
version), so better to just close it at a certain moment).

- add a comment to all issues asking the owner to take the following
action (IF they find the issue still valid/important):
1) create a github account for theirselves, and add that user id to the
issue (so community has a cross user link)
2) move the issue to github issues (including attachments and
discussions? meaning some copy pasting of others comments... but at
least we do not loose discussions then)
3) OR ask community to do this (by adding a tag or message)
- not sure what to do with closed issues and the info in there though
4) close the issue, or at least tag it as 'migrated' or so.

What about this plan? We then have only issues that users find
important, and we can off course go over issues after a while an migrate
ones that we think should too...

Anybody is against the move, or remembers other arguments?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python 3 and existing plugins while still in 2.x
Message-ID: <56E27CEF.60006@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just saw Matthias' work about compiling QGIS 2.x with Python 3 and I
was wondering what's gonna happen if I build it and open it with already
many installed plugins. I suppose, it will a be a succession of error
messages....

What is the plan there:
* add a new line in plugin metadata to tell if it supports Python 3,
false by default
* run 2to3 dynamically (is this possible?)
* do nothing
* ?

If I understand correctly QGIS 3 will be built with Py3, so this problem
will disappear. Although, if we want early testers of Py3, it'll be good
to have a proper support of existing plugins.
Also, it can encourage people to start upgrading their plugins
progressively.

Any opinion/ideas?

Glad to see this moving, good job Matthias!

Denis

Régis, All,

QuickFinder does it like this. Denis is the main author of this plugin.

It can plug to osm, internal layer and GeoMapfish. You can even add more search 
engine to it.

I was going to recommend Denis' QuickFinder plugin. 

It doesn't work with zero configuration (as Paolo expects it), but is
quite easy to configure and also flexible.

You can control  what the algorithm  is doing by viewing  the resulting files

-  /.../.qgis2/processing/grass_batch_job.sh (or .bat) for GRASS 6.4.x
-  /.../.qgis2/processing/grass7_batch_job.sh (or .bat) for GRASS 7.x

They are created by the scripts 
/..../python/plugins/processing/algs/grass/GrassUtils.py and
/.../python/plugins/processing/algs/grass/Grass7Utils.py

The scripts use the  subprocess
<https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html>   module to execute
these  GRASS commands

1) They first create a temporary GRASS LOCATION (temp_location) and two
temporary MAPSETS (PERMANENT and user) 
2) They fix also a temporary REGION and write the desired GRASS commands
3) They execute the resulting GRASS script with subprocess


Example of a grass_batch_job.sh  script

      g.proj -c proj4="+proj=utm +zone=30 +ellps=intl
+towgs84=-87,-98,-121,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs"
      v.in.ogr min_area=0.0001 snap=-1

format=ESRI_Shapefile output_layer=output --overwrite
     exit

What happens when you fix the GRASS Region Extent and Region Cellsize option
? 
You can also run this script directly in GRASS GIS

Hi Yes, 
Wonderful! I had only tested in first versions, this is so good now! 
Maybe we should just improve fuzzy search / full text search capabilities, (it doesn't bear typos in my tests).. 
Very nice work

Agreed. Adding fuzzy search and autoindexing (thus reducing config
needs) would make it a very good candidate for inclusion in core.
All the best.

R2gis,

I know that Denis is open to PR as we (camptocam) worked on his plugin in the

Hi all,

Thanks for the good feeback!
Indeed, I am totally open to any contribution.

This discussion made me think that a first step to bringing to core
would be to port to core the widget (search combobox), the base class
for searching thread and to have a searching engine registry (like layer
registry).

Hence, any plugin or whatever could add their own searcing engine. The
UI would be kept consistent, and the searches centralized in a single place.

Nice project for the next HF ;)

Denis

Does Redmine have voting on bugs/feature requests, and if so, does QGIS use
that facility? That's the main thing I've found lacking in Github.

Der developers

During the last PSC meeting 
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1arzcgoU0NErm8yiqDvCeasFUdr9zt-8JUx15f3ivTdw/edit?pref=2&pli=1), 
Andreas brought up the topic how to improve coordination between 
developers, avoiding two devs doing the same thing at the same time. 
After a short discussion, the PSC decided not to maintain a list with 
ongoing projects. Instead, developers should write a QEP for larger 
changes. For smaller changes, do as in the 'good old days': write a 
short mail to the developer mailing list to announce your plans.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Nathan, 

There wasn't any list. The list was just a proposal. 

The list would have the advantage that one could have a good overview
without having to dig through the e-mail archive. Imagine you, as a
developer or a customer of a developer, are absent 2-3 weeks. In that
case you probably don't read all mails in the dev mailing list and such
a list would be convenient. 

But it was decided that a simple announcement on the mailinglist is good
enough (less bureaucracy). It is still recorded in the mailing-list
archive. If the subject of the mail would have a meaningful or maybe
even standardized title, it would be easy to find. 

Or maybe: if the subject of the mail is standardized, such a list could
even be generated automatically ;-)

Hi René,

this is a cmake 3.2 issue. If you are able to up- or downgrade cmake
(they even offer a portable version on their homepage[1]) that will
solve the issue.

For a quick workaround you can temporarily rename some tests as can be
seen here [2].

Cheers

Hi,

Cool.  Yeah it's a tricky one.  I guess the QEPs help there for the massive
stuff, but yeah even then it's tricky.

Maybe we just tag mails with [FEATURE] like PRs then we can search then out?

Hi, 

I would also think in case someone creates a QEP, that an announcement
of the QEP in the dev mailinglist would help, because not everyone
checks all the repositories every day ... 

Anyway - it would be great if devs and customers could inform each other
better about their plans - which wasn't always the case in the past.
Suddenly, a cool new feature appeared in master - but maybe someone else
had a similar idea at the very same time and it would be a waste of time
if people don't know from each others plans.

+1. There is a lot of traffic on the list, so a [FEATURE] - tag will 
certainly help.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] make install fails on GdalTools/resources_rc.py
Message-ID: <404CDA7F-4ADB-4307-8758-58CECA508FCC@gmail.com>

Thanks a lot Matthias, this flag worked for me.
However, when starting QGIS from this build I get an error:
"Couldn't load plugin 'processing'
ImportError: dlopen(/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyspatialite/_spatialite.so, 2): Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/geos/lib/libgeos-3.4.2.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyspatialite/_spatialite.so   Reason: image not found" 

I have a geos version 3.5.0, so it seems like pyspatialite gets build against geos version 3.4.2 somehow. Reinstalled it with pip and still have this error. I’ve checked geos and can confirm 3.4.2 is not present on my system. Is it possible to overcome this one and have processing plugin working?

       Try specifying WITH_STAGED_PLUGINS=TRUE in cmake

What are the next steps to move this forward?

We have tested using the Python and QGIS GUI interface which have been 
successful so far.  Draft documentation updates have been submitted in 
PR 876.

There have been some error on the Travis builds but it isn't clear that 
they have anything to do with our code updates.

Ok, looking at the code, it seems to be actually using full text search. 
I will check further why some I had the feeling it was a simple like search.. 
To be continued..

Yeah it's using SQLite FTS.  I use the same thing in Roam and it works
really well.  The only main suggestion I would add is just index the search
data + fid to lookup. Currently it stores the geometry information at that
point which blows the size out a lot for large data sets.  In Roam I just
went with the id and search data only and most indexes are ~2MB which is
fine for that.

Apart from that we should core it, although I would say make it C++ and
expose it via the API so plugins can just plug it into other maps, etc.

Yep, we could have an option to store only bboxes or simplified geometries.
In my Use case, I would like to keep them so that we can call mask plugin
action from a polygon output by search.

Hi all,

within a project at the university, students of mine developed QGIS
plugin to work with cadastral data in Czech exchange format (VFK). We
would like to publish the plugin in QGIS plugins repository.

One of conditions says "supports English language". The plugin is
currently in Czech language. My question is: do we need to rewrite all
messages to English even the plugin is useful only in Czech Republic.
Sure, there can be people which do not speak Czech and need to work
with VFK format (GDAL supports this format). We will probably do
transition to English in the future anyway (but not now). Or it's
enough to write metadata in English and keep plugin in Czech? Then we
could publish plugin within few days (users asking us for that).

Thanks for clarification, Martin

Even bounding boxes can be heavy, n case of millions of records.
Would this require a QEP? In case, should we start writing it?
All the best, and thanks for your thoughts.

Hi Martin,
this is a common issue, especially for other cadastral and gazetteer
plugins. I understand in these cases the requirement may seem odd, but
generally the extra work to make a plugin international is quite limited
(how many strings do you have?), and will make reuse of the code, when
needed, much easier, so I'd gently push in that direction.
All the best.

Just for the record: there are already several plugins for cadastre that
are in local languages only.
All the best.

I would say it'll be the liberty of the implementation of engine to
provide full geometry or not.
It won't affect core design.

Hi Martin, 

This may be a good case where you can set up your own local plugin
repository. 

Maybe there is a Czech FOSSGIS user group that can host it. 

Hosting a QGIS plugin repository only requires a webserver with an XML
file and the plugins as zip files. It is really simple to set up. 

And it is very simple to add an additional repository to the QGIS plugin
repository. Just add the URL and your done. 

Many larger organizations have their own in-house plugin repositories.

I discussed this with Arnaud at lunch and he said that he has some ideas to 
improving performance. Maybe he will work on this at the next hackfest.

@martin, if you want, I have examples of those.

But in general I think it would still be good to stick to the plan: a
big international repo, which every body can find, which can be used to
find examples and example code etc.
And preferably(!) english/multilingual ( and code/tags/description ), so
Paolo keep pushing, but please keep the plugins coming (even in
chinese/persian) :-)

Maybe a feature for the plugin repo: languages used, so you can filter
on it?

Regards,

Richard

Hi,
Martin, note that few hours ago (
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/plugin-translation-td5255634.html),
Matteo Ghetta has committed in QGIS-Doc repository a description of steps
to have a plugin translated.
It should be available at
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html
tomorrow. It may be of help for your team to get the plugin translated more
easily. (Feedbacks are welcome)

Regards,
DelazJ

I noticed that there are a lot of plugin approval notifications sent to
the developers list.
While it is amazing to see how many new plugins are being developed, I'm
not very interested in them personally and I think this list already has
enough traffic.

Could we move them to another (read-only?) list, rss feed or something else?

Regards

agreed, sharing is better than forking IMHO. after all, many of these
cadastral plugins will have points in common, and will be easier for a
new one start from existing examples.

no worries, new plugins are coming almost every day :)

> on it?

it would be nice, but complicated: a tag for every language? what if the
plugin is only partially translated?
IMHO: let's make al plugins ready for internationalization, so anyone
can contribute with their translation file.
I think accepting exceptions like these (as we have already done in
similar case), and keep the general rule, is the simplest and more
reasonable option, at least for now.

All the best.

Hi Tom, I agree that this is an issue, an important issue for new users 
on Windows.  This is one of those blockers for new users, something that 
seems minor to developers on Linux but can really set the initial 
impression poorly for new QGIS users on Windows.  Will you file a ticket 
for this so we can track this change?

beside SAGA and GRASS the QGIS alone will create 4(!) different icons.
So 4 (QGIS) + 1 (SAGA) + 1 (GRASS).

I wanted to say, none of QGIS icons (also SAGA) is removed from
desktop after uninstalling QGIS. Martin

I agree, at least QGIS should create not more than one icon on the
desktop (and not 4 + 2 as now). Martin

Hi Martin,

Thank you very much for the hint.

So, runing an operation and aligning the result to a raster with a smaller
extent:

g.proj -c proj4="+proj=tmerc +lat_0=39.66825833333333
+lon_0=-8.133108333333334 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80
+towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs"
r.external input="/home/pedro/SIG/MDT_JAG/dem_80m.tif" band=1
output=tmp1457733840723 --overwrite -o
g.region -a n=137550.0 s=112250.0 e=100125.0 w=74200.0 res=25
r.relief input=tmp1457733840723 altitude="30" azimuth="270" zscale="1"
scale="1" output=outputcb4f43647d7f428091f6b2971f87b214 --overwrite
g.region raster=outputcb4f43647d7f428091f6b2971f87b214
r.out.gdal --overwrite -c createopt="TFW=YES,COMPRESS=LZW"
input=outputcb4f43647d7f428091f6b2971f87b214
output="/tmp/processing72b78383106b4767bf4af0e1b207fc0a/fd0523aeda4f47ef87e79b1ea6afe0ae/output.tif"

and the result is ok.

Running the same operation, but aligning to a raster with a greater extent,
and a lower resolution:

g.proj -c proj4="+proj=tmerc +lat_0=39.66825833333333
+lon_0=-8.133108333333334 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80
+towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs"
r.external input="/home/pedro/SIG/MDT_JAG/raster_1.tif" band=1
output=tmp1457734497734 --overwrite -o
g.region -a n=154440.0 s=92680.0 e=114680.0 w=64040.0 res=80
r.relief input=tmp1457734497734 altitude="30" azimuth="270" zscale="1"
scale="1" output=outpute2696cc0c7194a6f80fb2494dd0a97ff --overwrite
g.region raster=outpute2696cc0c7194a6f80fb2494dd0a97ff
r.out.gdal --overwrite -c createopt="TFW=YES,COMPRESS=LZW"
input=outpute2696cc0c7194a6f80fb2494dd0a97ff
output="/tmp/processing72b78383106b4767bf4af0e1b207fc0a/02a931bb96124de49723ceacb4e18c46/output.tif"

the extent of the result raster is: w=64000.0 e=114720.0 s=92640.0
n=154480.0
The difference is 40 (half size of the original raster resolution).


So I suspected of the -a flag of g.region

"""
-a: Align region to resolution (default = align to bounds, works only for
2D resolution)

After all updates have been applied, the current region's southern and
western boundaries are (silently) adjusted so that the north/south distance
is a multiple of the north/south resolution and that the east/west distance
is a multiple of the east/west resolution.
With the -a flag all four boundaries are adjusted to be even multiples of
the resolution, aligning the region to the resolution supplied by the user.
The default is to align the region resolution to match the region
boundaries.
"""
from https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/g.region.html

I removed GRASS_REGION_ALIGN_TO_RESOLUTION (-a) from
../python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/Grass7Algorithm.py and the result
was correct

g.proj -c proj4="+proj=tmerc +lat_0=39.66825833333333
+lon_0=-8.133108333333334 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80
+towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs"
r.external input="/home/pedro/SIG/MDT_JAG/raster_1.tif" band=1
output=tmp1457735611533 --overwrite -o
g.region n=154440.0 s=92680.0 e=114680.0 w=64040.0 res=80
r.relief input=tmp1457735611533 altitude="30" azimuth="270" zscale="1"
scale="1" output=output4b1c7211268b4cf79133e876ba2cb133 --overwrite
g.region raster=output4b1c7211268b4cf79133e876ba2cb133
r.out.gdal -c createopt="TFW=YES,COMPRESS=LZW"
input=output4b1c7211268b4cf79133e876ba2cb133
output="/tmp/processingeb0423f9b07f4ef899d08e44b22d61bc/4acf63406c634f7297db9e65f4beebeb/output.tif"
--overwrite

The extent of the result raster was: w=64040.0 e=114680.0 s=92680.0
n=154440.0

Is there any reason to use the -a flag in Processing g.region?

Thanks!

Pedro

To keep the raster resolution.

In the book "OPEN SOURCE GIS A GRASS GIS Approach Third Edition",   p.57

"It may happen, that region boundaries lead to a modified, non-integer
raster resolution. If this is not desired, the -a flag can be used to align
the region to resolution. It adjusts all four boundaries to be even
multiples of the resolution by slightly enlarging the current region. To see
the effect, compare:
g.region res=15 -dp
g.region res=15 -adp" 

Look also:

-  suggestion for g.region -a
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/suggestion-for-g-region-a-td4014517.html>  
(Michael Barton)

"Currently, if you use the -a flag with g.region it will align the region
exactly to match the resolution of a map (e.g. g.region -a rast=myrast will
set the region to exactly the resolution of myrast regardless of the
extents) or the resolution specified in the res or ewres/nwres fields (e.g.
g.region -a n=523 s=15 res=10 will adjust the extents a little to make sure
the resolution is exactly 10)"

- or in  proposal: make -a flag the default behaviour for g.region
<https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/ticket/1745>  (Moritz Lennert)

"In my experience, when working with raster, having a precise resolution is
the most important issue, while exact extension is less important. I often
use existing vector data or bounds coordinates to determine the extent, but
then have to use the -a flag to make sure that the desired resolution is
kept. 
I would like to propose that in grass7, the behaviour is switched, i.e. to
make the -a flag (Align region to resolution) the default behaviour, and
"align to bounds" the option"

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsFeatureRendererV2.symbolForFeature() in 2.14 -
 how many arguments?
Message-ID: <1457776941844-5255961.post@n6.nabble.com>

I am struggling with QgsFeatureRendererV2.symbolForFeature().
QgsFeatureRendererV2.symbolForFeature(QgsFeature) does not throw an error,
but the API docs say that is deprecated. The non-deprecated syntax is listed
as QgsFeatureRendererV2.symbolForFeature(QgsFeature, QgsRenderContext).
However, in my case, that throws "TypeError:
QgsFeatureRendererV2.symbolForFeature(QgsFeature): too many arguments".

Am I doing something wrong? My use of this is here:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/master/utils.py#L205

I'm also not getting the overall results I want from this if I use the
deprecated syntax, so I'm getting nowhere at the moment.

Oh, and both deprecated and current syntaxes say "To be overridden" in the
docs, but I don't know what that means.

Apologies. Just found this in the docs for the non-deprecated syntax:
"available in Python bindings as symbolForFeature2". Grrr.
symbolForFeature2() works with the extra argument.

I still can't get my code to do what I want it to, but that's a different
(and as-yet unknown) issue.

Many apologies for the noise.

Was just about to point you that way! It's an unfortunate side effect
of the python bindings. I couldn't find anyway to keep the same name
as the c++ method without breaking existing python code which uses the
deprecated method.

In 3.0 I'll remove the deprecated method and rename the non-deprecated
one back to symbolForFeature.

That's only relevant if you're subclassing QgsFeatureRendererV2 (ie,
writing your own renderer). If this was the case you'd need to make
sure your subclass implements it's own overridden version of this
method.

I think the folder contains all necessary data for the installation
and is not created on the desktop but you can choose where you want it,
the installer should not be launched from the desktop but from a regular
file system folder if you like your desktop cleaner;
it is also a very useful folder because you can use it to perform
several OSGEO4W installation in other PC without having to download all
the needed stuff again and again, so not a folder to get rid of IMHO.

Betreff: Re: [Qgis-developer] Problem with GRASS Region Extent and Region Cellsize on Processing

To keep the raster resolution.

In the book "OPEN SOURCE GIS A GRASS GIS Approach Third Edition",   p.57

"It may happen, that region boundaries lead to a modified, non-integer
raster resolution. If this is not desired, the -a flag can be used to align
the region to resolution. It adjusts all four boundaries to be even
multiples of the resolution by slightly enlarging the current region. To see
the effect, compare:
g.region res=15 -dp
g.region res=15 -adp"

Look also:

-  suggestion for g.region -a
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/suggestion-for-g-region-a-td4014517.html>
(Michael Barton)

"Currently, if you use the -a flag with g.region it will align the region
exactly to match the resolution of a map (e.g. g.region -a rast=myrast will
set the region to exactly the resolution of myrast regardless of the
extents) or the resolution specified in the res or ewres/nwres fields (e.g.
g.region -a n=523 s=15 res=10 will adjust the extents a little to make sure
the resolution is exactly 10)"

- or in  proposal: make -a flag the default behaviour for g.region
<https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/ticket/1745>  (Moritz Lennert)

"In my experience, when working with raster, having a precise resolution is
the most important issue, while exact extension is less important. I often
use existing vector data or bounds coordinates to determine the extent, but
then have to use the -a flag to make sure that the desired resolution is
kept.
I would like to propose that in grass7, the behaviour is switched, i.e. to
make the -a flag (Align region to resolution) the default behaviour, and
"align to bounds" the option"



I guess it depends a bit what the most suitable solution is... There is also the "align" option which aligns the resolution to an input raster. Personally, i only use tha a-flag only in combination with the res option...
Cheers,
Stefan

Thanks, Nyall. Way beyond my knowledge, I'm afraid (when someone starts to
say overloading or subclassing, my eyes tend to glaze over. Not to worry -
at least I've got rid of that error...

I run it from the Windows start menu, so I'm not actively specifying a
directory. I think that will mirror other non-dev users' behaviour, so I
still think this is an issue. I can't remember how I first installed the
OSGeo installer itself, but I can't imagine I changed any installer
defaults.

The line:

where range is (I trust) a QgsRendererRangeV2 is dumping QGIS for me. Does
anyone know what circumstances can result in this? Fuller code snippet:

elif isinstance(renderer, QgsGraduatedSymbolRendererV2):
    classAttribute = renderer.classAttribute()
    attrValue = feat.attribute(classAttribute)
    ranges = renderer.ranges()
    for range in ranges:
        if (attrValue >= range.lowerValue() and
                attrValue <= range.upperValue()):
            symbol = range.symbol()

Hi, what i mean is that the "http%..." folder is useful and not to be
removed after install; btw i'm talking about the **OSGeo4Win network
installer** witch defaults the cache dir (http%...) in the position
where it is launched, also the cache dir can be customized if used in
advanced mode.

I totally agree that icons and start menu shortcuts could be handled
more graciously :)

That is also what I was saying Roy: there is an issue with the number of 
icons on the desktop on Windows.  (I have no issue with the cache "http" 
folder)

Yeah, my first reaction usually is to delete all icons.

Which icons would you add by default? Only QGIS Desktop (skip Browser and
all the dependencies)?
I guess this will require e​xtra installer logic because the installer
needs to know that the user is really only interested in QGIS and not all
the other stuff that gets installed as well.
Or would you suggest to present the user with a dialog to chose which icons
should be added to the Desktop?

Thanks for the discussion!

Best wishes,
Anita​

Hi Matthias,

How can I check whether my test works before I create a PR?

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

Is the feature form dialog creation from users settings (choosen widget in
fields properties or drag and drop), exposed in pyqgis? If so, where should
I look for it?

I wanted to add a few more buttons and functionality in a plugin.

Thanks,

Hi Martin and Stefan,

I understand, if we do not use the -a flag, we can not ensure that the
resolution is the set.

What if there is another option, "align=", as Stefan suggested, which
allows to choose a raster from the canvas? This would ensure that the
region would be aligned with a selected raster?

Thank you very much!

Pedro

I would have the standalone installer only add 2 shortcuts on the desktop:
  - one shortcut for "QGIS Desktop 2.14.1" (that starts QGIS Desktop)
  - one shortcut for "QGIS All Start Items" that when clicked opens a 
folder containing shortcuts to all of the other items (GRASS, Browser, 
Qt Designer, SAGA, Setup)

If you want to get fancy (and have the time to modify the installer 
scripts) then you could add a dialogue to allow the user choice of what 
shortcuts to add.

Message-ID: <38497AD9CA059C42AA3451EFEFF0378E0118AA17FC@P2KITMBX04WC02.unicph.domain>

Hi
Just installed a fresh 2.14 Essen at Windows 64 bit.

Trying to use the Processing Filter it freeze for min. 2 minutes. At a workshop last week I saw the same problem at some of the participants new installed computers, but mine was fine. At that time mine was installed parallel to previous versions.

Any suggestions what might be wrong.

Actually, maybe even make it more simple for the new user:

- one shortcut for "QGIS 2.14.1" (that starts QGIS Desktop, as only 
experienced QGIS users know the difference between desktop and browser)
- one shortcut for "QGIS All Start Items"

if you have a build environment on your pc you can do something like this from in your build directory:

ctest -R Processing

If you don’t have a build environment you could set up travis to work against your own repo too so that it builds against your master branch before you make a PR.

​Thanks Tim!
That's what I feared ... no so simple for Win-based power users after all. ​

Hi,

GRASS adjusts the resolution to the bounds (extent) you specified, either as n, s, e, w coordinates (like in Processing) or using the “vector” or “raster” option. This can conflicting with information provided through the user specified resolution; meaning that either bounds or resolution has to be adjusted. By default priority is given to the bounds (and resolution is adjusted if necessary) in GRASS, while setting the a-flag gives priority to the resolution (and bounds are adjusted).

However, if one wants to align the cells with a specific raster map, the “align” option should be used where only the resolution and placement of the cells (not the extent) is picked from the provided raster map. See: https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/g.region.html

Personally, I would say the “align” option (e.g. as “align to input”) is more suitable for modules like r.aspect (and the resolution option could be removed) ...
Specifying a resolution can make sense for modules like v.to.rast. However also here alignment with a specific raster (e.g. a DEM might be even more desirable).

There was another thing in Grass7Algorithm.py that surprised me: The use of r.out.gdal.
Using r.external.out befor running the algorithm, should be able to save you one read- and write step: https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/r.external.out.html
Was it not applicable in Processing?

Cheers
Stefan

Hi Martin and Stefan,

I understand, if we do not use the -a flag, we can not ensure that the resolution is the set.

What if there is another option, "align=", as Stefan suggested, which allows to choose a raster from the canvas? This would ensure that the region would be aligned with a selected raster?
Thank you very much!
Pedro

Betreff: Re: [Qgis-developer] Problem with GRASS Region Extent and Region Cellsize on Processing

To keep the raster resolution.

In the book "OPEN SOURCE GIS A GRASS GIS Approach Third Edition",   p.57

"It may happen, that region boundaries lead to a modified, non-integer
raster resolution. If this is not desired, the -a flag can be used to align
the region to resolution. It adjusts all four boundaries to be even
multiples of the resolution by slightly enlarging the current region. To see
the effect, compare:
g.region res=15 -dp
g.region res=15 -adp"

Look also:

-  suggestion for g.region -a
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/suggestion-for-g-region-a-td4014517.html>
(Michael Barton)

"Currently, if you use the -a flag with g.region it will align the region
exactly to match the resolution of a map (e.g. g.region -a rast=myrast will
set the region to exactly the resolution of myrast regardless of the
extents) or the resolution specified in the res or ewres/nwres fields (e.g.
g.region -a n=523 s=15 res=10 will adjust the extents a little to make sure
the resolution is exactly 10)"

- or in  proposal: make -a flag the default behaviour for g.region
<https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/ticket/1745>  (Moritz Lennert)

"In my experience, when working with raster, having a precise resolution is
the most important issue, while exact extension is less important. I often
use existing vector data or bounds coordinates to determine the extent, but
then have to use the -a flag to make sure that the desired resolution is
kept.
I would like to propose that in grass7, the behaviour is switched, i.e. to
make the -a flag (Align region to resolution) the default behaviour, and
"align to bounds" the option"


I guess it depends a bit what the most suitable solution is... There is also the "align" option which aligns the resolution to an input raster. Personally, i only use tha a-flag only in combination with the res option...
Cheers,
Stefan

Any folder installed to the Windows desktop is extremely irregular. In fact,
I'm not sure I've ever seen another application do it. 

1. Install to C:\Program Files

2. Add all shortcuts to new Start menu folder

3. Ask to add QGIS shortcut to the desktop

4. Some installers also ask if you want quick launch shortcuts

All options can be overridden. But this should be in the standalone, not
just the OSGeo installer. It's what users expect. 

Tom

I don't have a windows installation near right now to check the
situation there.
But you can just make a pull request and we can follow up from there.
The testing infrastructure is still pretty young, so I'm interested too
in seeing where potential pitfalls are.

Yes, I know. I was replying to Jeff. 

We just need to remember the reason for this discussion and ticket. The
behaviour might be ever so slightly irritating for experienced users. It's
less experienced users, though, that any proposed changes are intended to
benefit. Martin's original point is about not intimidating first-time QGIS
users. As I say, such users will almost certainly choose the standalone
installer. Improving this could result in increased usage of QGIS.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] save layer as dxf
Message-ID: <56E68566.8040301@jena.de>

Hi,

I decided to post this on the dev list and not on the user's list.
Problem description: task is to export a single layer to dxf, CRS of 
both, the project and the layer is EPSG:25832 (units = metres). Using 
layer - save as with dxf results in a dxf file with units = inches 
(although exported coordinates are EPSG:25832 coordinates, i.e. units 
should be metres). Digging into this I found the description on the ogr 
side [1] explainig that the default is "English - Inches". To use other 
units one needs to use a different header file. But there is no way to 
tell QGIS to do so (except I am missing something). IMHO this behaviour 
is very counterintuitive, leeds to wrong results and is not really 
solveable from a user's point of view (change the header file being 
installed with QGIS, or change the resulting dxf with an editor).

I see these possible solutions
1) delete this option completely as we now have the dxf export function
2) enable the user to choose a header file and use the default only if 
left blank
3) automatically change all units in the resulting dxf file to the ones 
used in the chosen CRS

I would opt for solution 3 if we do not follow solution 1

tested with QGIS 2.8.3 on Win7 and QGIS 2.14.0 on Ubuntu

is this worth a ticket?

No, it's not that. I already have startRender() and stopRender() either side

Here's a fuller code snippet. 

# cleanedLayer is a memory layer with the extra fields added for height,
roof, colour, and wall colour
# i is the original layer
# canvas is obviously iface.mapCanvas()

fields = cleanedLayer.pendingFields()
renderer = i.rendererV2()
renderContext = QgsRenderContext.fromMapSettings(
        canvas.mapSettings())
feats = i.getFeatures()
context = QgsExpressionContext()
context.appendScope(QgsExpressionContextUtils.layerScope(i))
expression = QgsExpression('eval(@qgis_25d_height)')
heightField = fields.indexFromName("height")
wallField = fields.indexFromName("wallColor")
roofField = fields.indexFromName("roofColor")
renderer.startRender(renderContext, fields)
cleanedLayer.startEditing()
for feat in feats:
    context.setFeature(feat)
    height = expression.evaluate(context)
    if isinstance(renderer, QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2):
        classAttribute = renderer.classAttribute()
        attrValue = feat.attribute(classAttribute)
        catIndex = renderer.categoryIndexForValue(attrValue)
        categories = renderer.categories()
        symbol = categories[catIndex].symbol()
    elif isinstance(renderer, QgsGraduatedSymbolRendererV2):
        classAttribute = renderer.classAttribute()
        attrValue = feat.attribute(classAttribute)
        ranges = renderer.ranges()
        for range in ranges:
            if (attrValue >= range.lowerValue() and
                    attrValue <= range.upperValue()):
                symbol = range.symbol()
    else:
        symbol = renderer.symbolForFeature2(feat, renderContext)

As I say, this works for single symbol and categorized renderers, but dumps
QGIS for graduated renderers, crashing on the line:

symbol = range.symbol()

What's the cause?

Message-ID: <7208D119001E804CA9A367B852EF63A0457BB1E8@POSEIDON.eftasgmbh.local>

Dear developers,

we want to use QGIS in a bigger project in our company this summer. As it is a digitizing project it would be nice to have feature http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12667 (pause snapping) and maybe http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13803 (color of selection) working quite soon.
Can anyone estimate the time and maybe cost of developing these features? For only #12667 and for both?

Personally, I would like to support the project with either donation or pay for developing. But I am not in the position to spend money so I have to discuss that with my boss. This is why I'm asking, because we need it in the next two months.

Thanks and best regards

I'm not sure how, but that line is no longer crashing. However, I am now
getting a crash on a subsequent line:

wallColor = symbol.symbolLayer(1).subSymbol().color().name()

What is interesting is that it crashes not immediately, but on the third
feature it loops to in "for feat in feats". Simplified code snippet:

for feat in feats:
    classAttribute = renderer.classAttribute()
    attrValue = feat.attribute(classAttribute)
    ranges = renderer.ranges()
    for range in ranges:
        if (attrValue >= range.lowerValue() and attrValue <=
range.upperValue()):
            symbol = range.symbol()
    wallColor = symbol.symbolLayer(1).subSymbol().color().name()

What could cause that last line to crash for some features but not others?

Tom, I think people find it hard to follow your messages as you don't 
include the previous thread in your response; meaning, we have no idea 
what/who you are responding to.

I think symbol is probably getting deleted by the renderer. I'd try
making a copy of it, eg

symbol = QgsSymbolV2( range.symbol() )

@Nyall You're completely right. Thanks so much! Couldn't use your method
precisely (throws "TypeError: qgis._core.QgsSymbolV2 represents a C++
abstract class and cannot be instantiated"). However, this did the trick:

symbol = range.symbol().clone()

Thanks again, and sorry about all the questions on the mailing list. I
absolutely don't mean to flood.

Message-ID: <CAES-DZTRhy9i1VwskvW2dfRAFQH0z0qrqbBMwkTJn8sKNQM96A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All


I just wanted to invite the QGIS communities to join us at #floodhack2016
on April 2 and 3, 2016. You can join us either by attending in person in
Jakarta, Indonesia or by participating virtually if you are far away. If
you attend in person you can hang out with some members of the QGIS
community including core developers, plugin writers and power users! We
will be there ready to hack code, data and floods!

It is a great opportunity to use your elite QGIS skills to show how QGIS
and open spatial data can be used to reduce the impacts of floods in
Jakarta. Every year, floods have an adverse impact on thousands of lives
and the problems are an interesting exercise for spatial analysis.

If you wish to participate in person (or wish to find out more), please go
along to http://floodhack.org and register. Attendance is free  (but you
need to register) and we will provide food, power, internet access and lots
of geek stimulation as you hack for a good cause! The venue will be open
for the entire event and you are welcome to fall asleep at your keyboard,
wake up and keep hacking right through the night :-)

If you wish to hack virtually, we will be uploading the open data and links
to various open API's that you can use onto the http://floodhack.org web
site. Share your work using hashtag #floodhack2016 on your favourite social
media platform.

For your diary: The event will be held on 2 and 3 April 2016.

For your browser:  http://floodhack.org (includes venue details and
registration)

Thanks all, hope to see you showing off QGIS there!

Regards

Tim

Apologies to all. A combination of using Nabble to avoid our massive
corporate signature files, trying to reply on mobile, and a desire to be
brief, are evidently combining to make my messages confusing, along with the
fact that there is both this thread and the Redmine issue. Sorry, everyone.

My last reply was intended as more of a general description of how I think
the QGIS installer should handle shortcuts.

No problem Tom, sorry for being direct, I meant it more of a helpful

Hi Christian,
my suggestion is to hire one of the top QGIS developers, directly.
All the best.

Hi Larry and Luigi

You're putting high social pressure on me :-) but it's hard for me to
travel during academic semester time.
It's somehow weird that public institutions are pushing this.

Anyway: Speaking of OAuth 2.0. Are you also aware of OpenID Connect?
It's on top of OAuth and specifies a RESTful HTTP API with JSON and
it's supported by quite some big companies.

Any objections to making this "[WIP]" instead? It's possible that work
includes refactoring or fixes which aren't new features.

I'll get this started by announcing all the stuff I've got in the
pipeline. Hope I'm not out of line by using WIP here :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [WIP] Data defined rework to a flexible properties
 system + data defined diagram properties
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiADMchfXt6QSo2G0FYsB8-s=FGxr7hJVZ0Mc6LRGZt7w@mail.gmail.com>

(Apologies in advance for spamming the list!)

Given the recent decision by the PSC to have developers announce work
they are doing to avoid overlap or clashes, here's the first of my
current work announcements:

Please see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2857 and
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/38 regarding
work which is underway in reworking how QGIS handles data defined
properties.

This work intends to deprecate the existing QgsDataDefined class (+all
the multiply duplicated code for handling collections of data defined
objects) in a more structured, flexible and powerful manner.

Benefits will include:

- setting the framework for inheritable property collections (eg live
layout templates, labeling presets).
- much simpler code for handling data defined properties (current code
has many issues, is very complex, not many tests)
- upgrades QgsScaleExpression and adds an easy interface for creating
other assistants like the current size assistant (the PR includes the
framework (no GUI yet) for a "color assistant" which interpolates
colors from a ramp).
- sets a framework where parts of time manager can be ported to core
(eg, an "animate property" assistant)

Please touch base with me if you have any work planned involving
QgsDataDefined, QgsScaleExpression, QgsDataDefinedAssistant, diagrams
in the near future.

I'm hoping to land this for 2.16, and start by introducing it to
diagrams. API break will be required to port it to labeling, symbology
and composer so that will be deferred to 3.0.

Announcing some planned improvements to diagram rendering targeted to 2.16:

- paint effects for diagrams
- additional diagram types
- legend improvements for diagrams
- refactor diagrams to use a registry

Please note that these improvements are NOT yet confirmed but please
contact me if you are planning any work involving the diagram classes.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [WIP] Coordinate formatter class + registry for
 plugin based coordinate formatters
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjgRHFDjRW-9q7G=yKY1zLWKFxYmTc87gi3PqpU-HR+cw@mail.gmail.com>

Announcing work in progress regarding pulling the coordinate
formatting methods out of QgsPoint into a more flexible coordinate
formatter class.

An initial prototype is available here
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2586, but based on feedback from
that PR I intend to extend the work and create a registry of
coordinate formatters so that plugins can provide custom formatters
(eg specific local coordinate formats).

The work is NOT definite yet, but I'll be continuing to hack on it
while I have spare time.

Announcing WIP regarding a new "cluster" renderer for symbology. The
cluster renderer does the opposite of the existing displacement
renderer and instead collapses nearby points into a single symbol,
much like the cluster markers which are common in web mapping
libraries like Leaflet.

Note that the work is NOT definite yet, but please contact me if you
have work planned involving QgsPointDisplacementRenderer.

	geometry editor widget
Message-ID: <CAB28Asg57hr8U-ZcSjVx+vx3DiVYN7N_ZT3-aEGtupN8w86HyA@mail.gmail.com>

Announcing work-in-progress regarding adding support for handling
multiple geometry columns from providers (ie, keeping the additional
geometry columns as proper QgsGeometry objects rather then converting
them to strings).

A part of this work also involves creation of a new "geometry editing
widget" used as a delegate for additional geometry columns in the
attribute table. The widget allows for copy/pasting the geometry
attached to a feature in a variety of formats (wkt and geojson), and
for clearing the geometry attached to a row.

It's in early experimental stages (just a fun hack for me for now),
but please contact me if you are planning related work!

Message-ID: <CAB28Asje1YV1OBg3Rtgrz5LZ7677LRz3X1s1OdMA8iDsmDQ0AA@mail.gmail.com>

Announcing a WIP "mask" effect for layers. This is a new layer effect
(alongside the existing drop shadows, blur, etc) which allows for
modifying the alpha channel of a rendered symbol/layer. Options
currently include gradient style masks (eg fade from top, fade from
left) and source in/out style composition masking.

I'm hoping to add a "mask from image" and "mask from symbol" option
before merging this.

Hi Christian,
for only #12667 you can use am experimental plugin called QAD (Quantum 
Aided Design).
code repository is here:
https://github.com/geosim/QAD

download zip from here:
https://github.com/geosim/QAD/archive/master.zip then unzip in
<home>/.qgis2/python/plugins then remove the "-master" suffix
(otherwise you'll have python invalid syntax during loading plugin
module) and restart QGIS.

During digitalization press F3 to toggle snap mode on/off and F8 to 
toggle orthomode on/off.
Note: QAD has its own snap options.

 From QAD Documentation:

OSNAP
The F3 key activates/deactivates the osnap mode.
To change the osnap mode:

- When a command ask for a point press CTRL + right mouse button to 
choose a different snap mode.

- When a command ask for a point type in the text window:
"NONE" = no snap
"END" = endpoints of each segment
"END_PL" = endpoint of the entire polyline
"MID" = midpoint
"CEN" = center (centroid)
"NOD" = point object
"QUA" = quadrant point
"INT" = intersection
"INS" = insertion point
"PER" = perpendicular point
"TAN" = tangent
"NEA" = closest point
"APP" = apparent intersection
"EXT" = Extension
"PAR" = Parallel
"INT_EXT" = intersection on extension
"PR" = progressive distance (may be followed by a number to set a 
progressive distance different from default)

- Run DSETTING command

Fixes for some issues discussed here are coming
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2915)

About inserting double quotes around table names, I did not find how to
do with QScintilla. This would require to look for a completion without
quotes but that inserts quotes. Any QScintilla experts around ? :)

About the rowid generation for joins, it is not that easy. There is no
equivalent to the postgresql "row_number() over ()" with SQLite. I am
thinking about introducing "sequences" so that you could do "select
nextval('my_id'), ... " but that would be an incrementing value changing
each time ...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Processing] access output layer as QgsVectorLayer
	object
Message-ID: <56E82FA3.8040801@jena.de>

Hi,

I am currently rewriting a processing alg. What I need is
- either a temporary layer (I could do that with QGIS Python api but 
wondered if there is a helper function for that)
- or (prefered) get the layer created by output (and modify it further) 
I cannot access it, this is my code:
output = self.getOutputFromName(self.OUTPUT)
writer = output.getVectorWriter(provider.fields(),
     provider.geometryType(), inLayer.crs())
output.layer and writer.layer are both None

any help appreciated

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Aggregates within expression engine
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiqM_kogOAVS5t0L7_snuSevyv0k5qheiaKZU64HFwrjA@mail.gmail.com>

This has been discussed a few times in the past, but a possible
funding opportunity has arisen and I'd like to get things moving on
implementing this for 2.16.

Before I start a QEP I thought an informal discussion concerning the
approach is a good idea.

My thoughts are:

- Calculation of aggregates is done when a QgsExpression is first
evaluated (and the aggregate is required). The calculated aggregate
will then be cached within the QgsExpressionContext the expression has
been evaluated against. This means that additional evaluation of the
expression will not need to suffer the cost of recalculating the
aggregate multiple times (eg using the field calculator to calculate a
field value / sum that fields values in the layer = sum is only
calculated once). This approach will also avoid the possibility of the
aggregate's value changing mid-way through updating multiple features
(eg using field calculator to change a field's value to "field"/sum).

- Create a new class QgsAggregateCalculator with methods for
calculating aggregates from a QgsFeatureIterator and field name. This
should make it straightforward to calculate aggregates for either an
entire layer, selected features, or using related features.

- For numeric fields the existing QgsStatisticalSummary class will be
used to calculate the statistic. For string fields a new
QgsStringStatistics class will be created which will operate on
QStringLists and calculate statistics such as the max/min and
concatenations of these strings. Similarly a QgsDateTimeStatistics
class will be created for date/time statistic calculations. (Note that
these classes could also be reused in the statistics panel for showing
stats for string/date/time classes).

Alternative wild ideas:

- Add handling of arrays to the expression engine, and calculate the
aggregates from arrays, and then add methods to the expression engine
which iterate through a layer and returns an array of values?

I'm also torn regarding the best syntax to use for aggregates within
expressions. I'm unsure if the traditional SQL "group by" clauses
would be a good fit within the existing QGIS expression syntax (eg
"sum("some_field") group by "some_other_field"). To me it doesn't fit
with the existing functional approach that the expressions take. But
on the other hand, trying to implement this as functions would result
in some very clumsy expressions: "aggregate('sum', "some_field",
"some_other_field")" or "sum("some_field", "some_other_field") ". Has
anyone got any other ideas for syntax which would be a good fit?

Given how useful these will be, and the wide variety of possible uses
they will have, I'd like to gather everyone's thoughts on how
aggregates should be added to QGIS and all the potential use cases
they'd like me to address with this work.

So, thoughts and feedback welcome, no matter how off-the-cuff they are! ;)

Good news, thanks for sharing.
IMHO having a syntax that is easy to use for the average user is a
crucial point. I think using SQL is a no go. Why not using the
spreadsheet syntax? Not that I find it particularly attractive, but at
least everybody is more or less familiar with it.
All the best.

Hi all,
the flow of new plugins keeps on steady, and I do my best to check and
publish them. With the growing number (over 600 now), it is practically
impossible to do any serious code analysis by hand.
I would therefore ask for a tool that scans the code for the most common
possible issues, especially related to security. This could be
integrated in the plugin web app, or a standalone tool that I can run
locally before publication.
The same tool (or a similar one) could be extended to help migrating
from py2 to py3.
Anyone has interest in doing this?
All the best.

Hi Paolo, 

Thank you for your feedback.  

Why do you think SQL aggregate syntax (e.g. as outlined at
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/interactive/functions-aggregate.html)
is a no-go? Can you explain this in detail? QGIS is much closer to a
database then it is to a spreadsheet - in fact for most serious QGIS
work you store your data in a SQL database. 

It was my impression that QGIS tries to maintain expression syntax
compatible with SQL wherever possible. I think it would be a good thing.


The question is how we can specify grouping. I'd like to see support for
the following grouping mechanisms: 

 	* whole record set
 	* given grouping field or expression
 	* current selection
 	* grouping based on relations (very important to my employer) - also
our initial trigger for funding this work
 	* current set of symbology rules or classes (not so important to me,
but maybe useful to some)

Hi Andreas,
based on my lengthy experience with courses, I'm pretty sure SQL
commands are out of reach for most "normal" GIS users.
It is fine to have access to SQL for power users, but aggregate
functions should IMHO be available to anyone.
All the best.

Sorry, I'm not familiar with the spreadsheet syntax. Can you make some
examples so we can compare the advantages and drawbacks in detail?

Hi Paolo, 

And what would be the alternative syntax that is easier than SQL syntax?


Please try to be more specific rather than just saying SQL syntax is
complicated. Syntax that allows to use aggregate functions and grouping
for the following use cases: 

Aggregate functions: 

All data types: 

 	* Count
 	* Count distinct
 	* Count missing values (null)

Text data types: 

 	* string_agg/join: with delimiter and sort option

Numeric data types: 

 	* Sum
 	* Mean
 	* Median
 	* Minimum
 	* Maximum
 	* Range
 	* St dev(pop/sample)
 	* Minority
 	* Majority
 	* Variety
 	* Q1
 	* Q3
 	* IQR

Date/Time types: 

 	* Minimum date/time
 	* Maximum date/time
 	* Range between minimum/maximum date/time

-------------- 

Grouping options: 

 	* All records in the attribute table
 	* A given grouping field or expression
 	* Currently Selected features
 	* Selection based on table relations (e.g. aggregation of all owners
of a parcel)
 	* Optional: have the same function grouped by each symbol category or
rule

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi,
just my 2 ct:
I agree with Paolo that normal users do not know SQL, on the other hand 
there might be users that do not know spreadsheet syntax either (e.g. me 
:) which spreadsheet BTW: Excel? LO? or do they use the same syntax? SQL 
would be a standardized approach (and is the syntax already used in QGIS 
expressions). On the other hand if it is possible to "click together" 
the expression it doesn't matter which syntax is used, good 
documentation and direct help is a must here. If you e.g. choose a SUM 
function a GROUP BY woould be added automatically at the end (if not 
already there)
SQL is used at so many places in QGIS: layer filters, labelling, 
rule-based renderer... I would not mix this with different syntax.

 In R (stats programming language/package) these things are done with
functions, so you can get expressions like:

   means = summarize(group_by(filter(data,"Outcome"=="fatal"),"Disease"),
mean=mean("Age"))

where "Disease" is the name of a column in the "data" dataset. This
expression would return a vector (like a python "list") of the mean
ages for people who died with each disease. Now, once you get a few
more expressions in these things get messy, so people implemented a
new operator to express these like a pipeline. The above can be
written:

  means = data %>% filter("Outcome"=="fatal") %>% group_by("Disease")
%>% summarise(mean=mean("Age"))

which reads much more naturally from left to right than trying to
unwrap nested function calls. (Note the ugly-looking operator with
%-signs is because user-defined R operators have to be demarcated in %
signs). So if I wanted to know the range of the mean ages by disease
I'd just add:

   %>% range()

on the end of the above expression, rather than sticking `range(` at
the start and then going to the end and putting the closing `)` next
to, quite probably, a bunch of uncountable closing brackets.

 The operator works quite simply by rewriting the expression `foo %>%
bar(x,y,z)` as `bar(foo,x,y,z)`.

 This pipe operator has divided R users a bit, and it has been
overused and abused greatly. Its also slower than direct function
evaluation because of the re-arrangement of the expression, but its
unlikely that any pipeline chain will spend much of its time doing
that compared to doing the actual work of the pipeline.

 Anyway, if something like that might be useful in QGIS, take a look
at the documentation for R's `dplyr` package, or tutorials with it.

I'm not saying it is complicated. I like it and use it a lot.
What I'm saying is that for our average users, based on my sample of
over 350 courses * ~15 participants, it is out of reach. I'm happy to be
proved wrong.

best if you have a look to LibreOffice help itself.
BTW, we already used the LO help for the description of many basic

Are you sure that

Hi,

Just for me to understand: why not considering improving a bit the
virtual layers ?

There is already a support for user defined aggregate functions. Caching
of the computed aggregate is already done by the engine (I guess). And
we could add some functions to restrict the query to the selected
features of a layer or deal with relations ...

And using something like the "query builder" found in db manager (and
inspired by mapinfo), it may ease to deal with the SQL syntax ...

I think the use case is quite different. Having aggregates in
expressions is useful for things like embedding the values in
composers and atlas prints, or in data defined overrides.

Sure, but "extending" a layer by a virtual layer that adds new columns
computed by aggregate functions could also be a solution.

Hi, 

Yes, the use cases that triggered this project are: 

 	* print composer
 	* atlas printing
 	* tables and forms (virtual fields): aggregates on related tables
(e.g. show all owners of a parcel, or the count or mean age of all trees
in a parcel)

Who knows, it could even be useful in labelling, symbology, etc. - e.g.
using the above example with the trees: color the parcels based on the
mean age of all trees in the parcels. 

I guess there are many more use cases we don't even think about
currently.

UPDATE 16/03/2016

I updated Apache and PHP packages and the problem continues. After several
tests I found that if I save edition changes (via WFS) while I am loading a
Lizmap Map, the saving fails, but some other times keep failing although
there is no Lizmap loading ( on lower volume ). It is a problem in QGIS
Server (qgis_mapserv.fcgi.exe).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Changes to a newly created memory layer are
 affecting the original layer from which it was copied
Message-ID: <1458121398791-5256690.post@n6.nabble.com>

Sorry about the convoluted subject line. qgis2web is built from @volaya's
qgis-ol3 plugin (thanks as ever, Victor). That exported layers by making
temporary memory copies of them, in order to manipulate them pre-export
without affecting the original layer and corrupting the user's data. This
worked perfectly.

However, in building the 2.5d export functionality, something has gone
wrong, and I've introduced a very nasty new bug. Somehow, changes I make to
the memory layer (the copy of the original) are being written back to the
original user's layer. What have I done wrong?

The function which creates the memory copy layer is:

def writeTmpLayer(layer, popup):
    usedFields = getUsedFields(layer)
    if popup != ALL_ATTRIBUTES:
        uri = TYPE_MAP[layer.wkbType()]
        crs = layer.crs()
        if crs.isValid():
            uri += '?crs=' + crs.authid()
        if popup != NO_POPUP:
            usedFields.append(popup)
        for field in usedFields:
            fieldType = layer.pendingFields().field(field).type()
            fieldType = "double" if (fieldType == QVariant.Double or
                                     fieldType == QVariant.Int) else (
                                        "string")
            uri += '&field=' + unicode(field) + ":" + fieldType
        newlayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri, layer.name(), 'memory')
        writer = newlayer.dataProvider()
        outFeat = QgsFeature()
        for feature in layer.getFeatures():
            outFeat.setGeometry(feature.geometry())
            attrs = [feature[f] for f in usedFields]
            if attrs:
                outFeat.setAttributes(attrs)
            writer.addFeatures([outFeat])
        layer = newlayer
    return layer

The snippet which calls the function above and is meant to add the fields to
the memory layer is:

if (layer.type() == layer.VectorLayer)
    cleanLayer = writeTmpLayer(layer, popup)
    if is25d(layer, canvas):
        provider = cleanLayer.dataProvider()
        provider.addAttributes([QgsField("height", QVariant.Double),
                                QgsField("wallColor", QVariant.String),
                                QgsField("roofColor",
                                         QVariant.String)])
        cleanLayer.updateFields()

When the plugin runs, the new fields height, wallColor, and roofColor are
appearing in the original user's layer. Each time the plugin is run,
additional copies of those fields are created. Hence, a very nasty bug.

How is this affecting the original layer, rather than the newly created
cleanLayer?

The actual code is here:

Hi, 

I know - I am a bit late about it - but next Monday there is the

http://2016.foss4g.org/news-entry/call-for-submissions.html 

Who is going to present on behalf of the QGIS project? I guess someone
should provide an update on the QGIS project - what we achieved in the
last year and provide any plans/updates/insight on QGIS 3.0 - if any ;-)


And how about workshops? 

Did someone already submit something on behalf of QGIS and if yes -
what? 

Thanks for sharing, 

Andreas

I plan to propose two presentations: one about a plugin for running
self-paced tutorial within QGIS (so something not general or about the
QGIS project itself) and another one about Processing and future plans
for it.

Cheers

If popup == ALL_ATTRIBUTES then your writeTmpLayer function is returning
the original layer.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Intersection of two lines design
Message-ID: <56EB2D7C.4070305@gmx.de>

Hi,

I've frequently stumbled upon the problem that several functions (like
geomentry().intersection(geometry2), geometry().touches(geometry2) only
return something useful if BOTH geometries have a vertex at the meeting
point (which is inherited from GEOS)

My expection: they do intersect or touch if they share space.
I am Getting: Only a result if they share at least a vertex.

This results in tools like geoprocessing:intersection or clip giving
strange/unintuitive outputs.

Is it a design decision or just never discussed? It could be solved
quite easily, (see https://hub.qgis.org/issues/14504#note-2)

Ah, I see it! Thank you so much. And apologies for not spotting that one
myself. I blame Python and its semantic white space... Fix will follow as
soon as I can.

Hi,

I use QgsGeometry.intersection() and QgsGeometry.difference() in the 
DigitizingTools plugin (cutter/clipper) and I did never experience any 
errors in these functions no matter if the geometries share a vertex or 
not (neither during my tests nor during courses I gave nor in the bug 
tracker). So I wouldn't say this is generally true. I wonder, however, 
why it seems to be a problem in processing.

Last follow-up on this, I hope: is there an accepted method for
cloning/duplicating a vector layer? Examples online seem to involve manually
creating a new layer and then iterating over the source layer's features to
add to the new one. Anything simpler?

Apologies - I meant how best to do it in Python.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Issue with Shapefile creation algorithm
Message-ID: <56EC001F.3060103@thelis.be>

Hi QGIS Developers :-)

I asked some help on QGIS support, but they told me that I don't ask my 
question at the right place, and that I should go througth developers 
email list.
That's why I'm here. So let me explain what's going on.

I developped an application with a class able to read data from an 
Oracle database with MapXtreme (MapInfo), and convert them in Shapefile.
This class follows the ESRI specifications from here : 
https://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf
You can find in attach 2 samples that I tried to open in QGIS :
- 4480___S12_060_4 : there is only one polygon, but it is not displayed 
on the map
- 4480___327550 : there are 8 polygons in this one, and all of them are 
well displayed
The strange thing is that the polygon from "4480___S12_060_4" is common 
with "4480___327550", but in one case it is not shown, and in the other 
case it is shown.
I have no problem when I open these files with MapInfo.
I don't have ArcMap to check on this side.
The support told me they were not able to open my files with SAGA, but I 
downloaded SAGA GIS 2.2.3 and was able to open the file without any issue...

According to QGIS support, it looks like an issue in my creation 
algorithm, but I really don't see what's wrong, it seems to follow well 
the ESRI specifications.
I'm not a "GIS expert", so maybe some of you could help me to discover 
what's wrong.
Or if you have any GIS tool that can tell me what's not correct in my 
shapefile, it could really help me.

You can find in attachment the source code of my class in VB.Net.

Many thanks !

Regards,

JCB

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Issue with Shapefile creation algorithm

For the one shape I get 7 valid and one "none" geometries (the last
feature).
for the other shape, just a "none" geometry

It seems that some "end of file" is off.

Function I used with the python console in QGIS:

layer = iface.activeLayer()
for feature in layer.getFeatures():
    print feature
    print feature.geometry()
print layer.featureCount()

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS PDF export options
Message-ID: <1458315070866-5257213.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi
I would like to see a few options when exporting a layout to PDF:

- PDF version, such as archive PDF/A-1a
- Support for layers/geospatial PDF as discussed in
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/9362
- Resolution, compression
- Password protection
- Disable printing
- Enable/disable content copy
- Fit window, fit visible etc.

Any thoughts? Should I open a ticket for each one of the above or a general
ticket?

Regards,

Magnus

Hi Andrea,
welcome. I would suggest you to start from some smiple bug (we have
many), especially those tagged as "easy", then you can see hot to proceed.
Al the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Important: Feedback about composer svg changes in
	master vs 2.14
Message-ID: <CAB28AshpYN8kagFxF01dJzVngU9ERvwU_NTh=uJxFR7HK6eWCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to request feedback if anyone has experienced any regressions
in master since I moved composer to use the svg cache and added
support for parameterised svg files.

I'd like to backport this for 2.14.1 (scheduled for next week), but
I'll be on holidays next week so only have today/tomorrow to do the
backport in time for the point release.

Has anyone encountered any issues in master which and thinks I should
NOT backport this fix? If so, please let me know asap.

This relates to the regression in 2.14
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14385, which prevents the SVG files
included with QGIS from displaying in composer. Pretty serious bug, so
would be nice to have the fix in 2.14.1.

Nyall

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Dockers for QGIS
Message-ID: <56ED11E4.8010008@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I'm using several versions of QGIS:
* 2.8 for production, especially on the server side
* 2.14 for normal work
* dev for experimenting and early qt5-py3 testing.
I do not want to mess up my clean Debian, so I only use packages.
As a possible solution to my problem, I'm trying out Tim dockers for QGIS:
http://kartoza.com/qgis-desktop-in-docker/
but I have not much success. Is anyone using it?
Are there simpler, yet clean, alternatives?
Thanks a lot.

Hi Paolo,

It is relatively easy to have several parallel QGIS versions on Linux, 
if you compile it yourself. You can set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to 
wherever you like, e.g. in your home directory.

You would install into several independent directories and introduce a 
3-line shell script to start the specific version. Something like:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/an/qgis/qgis_2_8/lib
export QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=/home/an/qgis/qgis_2_8
/home/an/qgis/qgis_2_8/bin/qgis

Note that /home/an/qgis should be replaced to wherever you have chosen 
to install.

This is really easy and it helps to work with and test versions directly 
from github.

Greetings,
Andreas

Thanks Andreas,
I know of this possibility, but in the past I did have bad experiences,
and I'd prefer to keep things clean.
One reason why I'd like to have things in separate environments is that
being on sid base libs change often, so I always have to recompile all
versions to avoid crashes. This may get difficult when qt4 support in
Debian will be removed. That's why I explored the docker alternative.
Thanks again.

I assume you mean exporting a layout from the composer to PDF? In that
case QGIS uses the Qt's built-in print-to-PDF support, and as the
sometimes/former maintainer of print support in Qt5 I know that none
of those options (except resolution) are supported in Qt so QGIS is
unable to provide them. All those features would be very welcome
contributions to Qt 5 though, it's just we lack someone with the PDF
standard knowledge and time to do so. If anyone here has those skills
I'd be happy to help guide them through the process (or be paid to
find the time myself!).

Rather than raise tickets on QGIS, you'll need to check if Qt already
has tickets open (I think most do, see bugreports.qt.io) and if not
raise them yourself, then perhaps open a single QGIS ticket pointing
to the upstream issues so they can be tracked?

John.

As it is "*QGIS *Wein 2.8.3" and I want to change it to "*TEST *Wein 2.8.3".

I had changed the the Wein and version by making changes in CmakeList.

But I am not able to change the first one, i.e QGIS.

Please help how to change the same.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qt5 python3 build?
Message-ID: <56EDCA91.7020304@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

I see a lot of qt5/py3 related commits passing, nice work, thanks.

Knowing Tim has some build/run dockers for different QGIS versions [0]:
I think it would be nice to have a docker build for qt5/py3 too. That
(at least for me) would make it easier to test in parallel with other
versions (and other distro version).

So my question: if I want to build in a Debian Jessie Docker, are there
any extra instructions or packages needed? I see in the Travis yaml
soemthing about an environment var: QT_VERSION=5
But we probably also need other libs too?

Or am I too eager and is it just too early to try this out yet...

Regards,

Richard

ps: anybody running a decent Linux and has Docker running. Try out the
docker build/run scripts from [0] :-)

I think I will probably get a master build against Qt5 in docker over the next couple of weeks (probably not this week as I am on holiday for the week). If someone wants to make a patch it will be most welcome. Also if there is interest, I can move my git repo referenced below to an official QGIS repo. My biggest problem, at the moment is that docker auto builds are not working as it always times out fetching packages. I’d like to have auto builds for all recent versions so that you can use the containers in production.

QGIS Desktop is mainly interesting for testing on your desktop, but there are also some other interesting use cases:

* Providing a sandboxed build on a network server with all packages etc then making it available to thin clients.
* QGIS Desktop is used directly by the QGIS Server docker recipe - which makes it really really easy to spin up a QGIS server instance on a server.

Regards

Tim

I mainly had bad experiences when trying to mix packages and hand build QGIS on the same system. Since I don’t use packages I have every version of QGIS installed for the last 6 or so releases in a pattern like this

/usr/local/qgis-<version>

I have little launcher scripts and .desktop files so that you can simply launch whichever version you want from gnome (or whatever DE you prefer). This all works seamlessly without any issue. I also have docker launchers set up in a similar way. Although I am a huge fan of docker, I actually think building multiple binaries into different prefixes gives you a better experience and would be my recommended approach if a user is able to compile themselves. I’ll make a little repo with my start scripts and .desktop files if that is useful to anyone (you just need to ensure you use the same INSTALL_PREFIX convention I do.

Regards

Tim

Personally I use qgis from the build dir, but I understand it only
works when you compile it yourself, and still shares the home
directory for plugins (which may or may not be wanted).

Hi Magnus,

What you list below is a LOT of work and won't just "happen". You would 
have to find a developer with profound PDF know-how to do the work.

Besides, some of your ideas even contradict with the values of the QGIS 
project.

Why should the QGIS project encourage or include technology that:
- disables printing and
- disables content copy ?

I would be against having such technology in QGIS.

QGIS is about enabling content and technologies, not about disabling and 
restricting the users rights.

Other stuff you list would be very useful to have. But as said, you 
would have to get active to get it implemented. It won't just happen ...

Greetings,
Andreas

OK, I'll follow your recommendations then.

Please do share it. A very short howto on what your install approach is
will be useful.

All the best, and thanks.

Hi all (again),
as I'm continue to working on the translation of the plugin I've find
out a little problem.

All the DIALOG windows of the plugin are translatable (and I can easily
do that with Qt Linguist) but all the plugin MENUS (and submenus) don't
appear to be in the my_plugin_it.ts file.

All this "voices" are in the my_plugin.py file (so the main plugin file)
under the *initGui* function, for example:


self.actionProgramLocations = QAction( "&Program &Locations",
self.iface.mainWindow())

even if in the my_plugin.pro file within the i18n directory I specified
that the main file should be included: (that's my pro file):

FORMS = ../ui/*

SOURCES = ../my_plugin.py

TRANSLATIONS = my_plugin_it.ts


Am I missing something? Or should I specify more details in the .pro file?

Thanks for your time

Matteo

OK, I've pushed this to 2.14. If any issue pops up over the next week
then please feel free to revert these commits from the 2.14 branch.

Hi Matteo,
does your plugin have something as a helper function like this one
(created by the plugin builder):

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/sectorplot/blob/master/SectorPlot/sectorplot.py#L174

This is the 'magic' that makes it know to Qt that a certain string is to
be translated, see for example:

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/sectorplot/blob/master/SectorPlot/sectorplot.py#L275

Without this your ts file will only contain the strings from your ui
files I think.

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

> (created by the plugin builder):

actually yes.. the plugin has been created with the plugin creator..
I have both the code lines you posted.. but it seems that the ts files
doesn't read all the Menu and Submenus..

I tried to do something like that:

* old string

self.actionProgramLocations = QAction(u"&Program &Locations",
self.iface.mainWindow())

* new string (with self.tr)
self.actionProgramLocations = QAction( self.tr(u"&Program &Locations"),
self.iface.mainWindow())

re-run lupdate but in Qt Linguist I cannot see the new entry...

should I investigate in this way or do you think I am completely wrong?

Thanks for the help!

Matteo

Hi,

just to add another thought: In the past I bypassed disable print 
settings in pdf documents by using a pdf viewer other than AdobeAcrobat 
Reader (gsView in that case) and thus was able to print. So setting 
flags does not necessarily mean that all pdf readers out there honor them.

Given that using SQL is maybe "harder", and that Mr. Paolo also have a 
good point
aiming to ease to use:
i would like just to remind what the very nature of a G.I.S. is,

namely a Database,

usually with an extra column that happens to be a geometry.

I can understand that inexperienced users can be a little confused by 
the SQL syntax
but if they want to do some *real work they will have to use QGIS as a 
database* so i would think
of a syntax that is closer to SQL than to anything else because sooner 
or later they will have to
learn SQL if they want to grow up.

I think that using anything else would in fact add an extra layer of 
complexity,
something pointless to learn and that conceals what's going on under the 
hood.

just my 2c,
best regards, Roy.

Thank you for the answer Maximilian

Indeed, the Python console shows me None for some geometries.
Do you know any tool that can analyse what's wrong with the shape ?
Maybe something that can translate the shp file into a readable format 
according to specifications from 
https://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf ?

Hi, 
Hi, I remember having had such a discussion with Hugo and matthias when
choosing what could be the best way for doing aggregates and relational
queries in QGIS. 

At that time, we chose to test virtual layers path because all database
query planner stuff seemed too much work to recode in QGIS core, and because
demand from French ministry was to allow users to do advanced relational
queries without having a full DB (many users are not granted to do that in
by organisations). 
Anyway, I agree with Paolo that query layers certainly are for advanced SQL
users, and are clearly not a straightfull path just to compute a max value
in an expression engine.. 

I have two concerns: 

 1 - Having aggregate functions in expressions would be very handy. What I
fear is that having expressions syntaxes between two worlds could be strange
for new comers. "CASE WHEN" instead of "if(condition, value)" but aggregate
expression instead of GROUP BY... Don't you feel so? Should we offer both
syntax for SQL fans and spreadsheet fans (with some info in documentation
panel pointing that both expressions are equivalent) ?

Anyway, any of the two syntaxes wil still be clearer than having to put a VB
code bloc like in Arcgis :) 

 2 -Question for the future: Is aggregates with expression the beginning of
a relational engine in QGIS? If yes, what should be the future for virtual
layers? Still use SQLITE with its pros and cons, or switch to a pure core
API (less caveats, but lot of work for sure)? 

Thoughts? 


Cheers
Régis

I just found the "checking tool" of geometry in the Vector menu of QGIS.
It tells me "Unknown geometry type 0", "The geometry has 1 error".
But in my algorithm, I put 5 as type, as explained in specifications.
 From where comes this 0 ? ...

Hi, 
moreover, you can still reprint PDF with PdfCreator and add a lot of such
options outside of QGIS. Such demands happen but must probably not be the
most common (except if you work for defense or security ?)

Hi
Thanks for the feedback. I am not saying that implementing my suggestions is
easy or that I need those features today. To me, options for resolution and
layer control are the most interesting features to add. However, I still
feel that security options might be relevant in some cases and I do not see
why QGIS shouldn´t support that, if that is what users want. For example,
both LibreOffice and Scribus allow document security, and a lot of other
additional options, follow the links below.

I will have a look at https://bugreports.qt.io and see if I can find any
related tickets. Hopefully, there are more users that would like to see the
PDF export improved and, somewhere down the road, funding will be allocated
for this work.

Best regards,

Magnus

But many of us, if not most, frequently have to work with datasets which
have licence restrictions. That would merit the features requested. Also,
though many of us share your feelings about openness, surely we need to
promote QGIS to potential users who do not share this view?

Hi,

Marco, does this "QGIS - what's new" presentation cover
plans/directions/wishes for QGIS 3.x or is it more focused on the last
features added recently ?

That would be a good thing to have a talk about the future of QGIS, as
mentioned by Andreas. We may propose something if nobody takes it.

The presentation is about new features in 2.12 / 2.14 / 2.16.

+1, an additional presentation about the future of QGIS makes sense.

Hi!

I am completely with Andreas here.
QGIS is able to produce PDF. That should be enough. I will not repeat
the arguments brought by Andreas but rather found another piece that
fits here:

https://forum.qt.io/topic/30725/qprinter-write-password-protected-pdf/2

So if it is really necessary to create password protected PDF please
use any specific PDF tool for that.
I too don't see password protection as a "main" function in a GIS program.
I'd rather promote openness to users that do not share this view than
support their laziness to open a dedicated programm for that.

Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Diagrams and labels
Message-ID: <5aa71e46aae384284a68f3312a3e4b41@oslandia.com>

Hi,

I'm going to work soon on adding some tools for diagrams. The aim is to 
provide features in a specific toolbar such as those in "Label Toolbar", 
but for diagrams.

Before doing that, in order to ensure that I implement the same type of 
thinking, I studied the behavior of the existing features for labels 
(like "Highlight Pinned labels", "Pin/Unpin Labels", "Move Label" and 
"Rotate Label"). By now, I have a couple of questions.

Firstly, I have noticed that a label can be moved even if it's 
"unpinned". If I do that, then the label is automatically "pinned" at 
the end of its move. However, the behavior is different for the 
rotation. Indeed, a label has to be "pinned" to be rotated. Why is there 
a difference between the "move" action and the "rotate" action?

Secondly, I have noticed that when we "unpin" a label previously moved, 
it backs to its initial position. But, the rotation is kept. I thought 
that when a label is "unpinned", then it backs to its starting position 
AND its original rotation (ie no rotation). Could you clarify this for 
me?

Thank you.

Paul

Message-ID: <B1BDA7B93091A044A4878A686846FDB7010ABE8671@SRVEXMB11.master.local>

Hy devs,
   my python plugin needs to use a contextual menu on canvas (on right click). I have a strange behaviour: after the menu is displayed the keyPressEvent event doesn't receive segnals.
If I click on the canvas window after the popup menu is displayed the keyPressEvent event works normally.
How can solve this problem ?
Thanks

An example

class MyMapTool(QgsMapTool):
   def __init__(self, plugIn):
      QgsMapTool.__init__(self, plugIn.iface.mapCanvas())

   def canvasPressEvent(self, event):
      if event.button() == Qt.RightButton:
         popupMenu = QMenu(self.canvas())
         popupMenu.addAction(QAction("test", popupMenu))
         popupMenu.popup(self.canvas().mapToGlobal(event.pos()))
         return

   def keyPressEvent(self, event):
      pass

If a layer in the browser panel is double-clicked to add it to the map

Where does this information go?

When the database provider constructor is called, it isn't given this

Hi,
I did just hand in a workshop proposal with a case:

Workshop QGIS from vector to raster and back again
The Scenario is autumn, storm and high tide. The area is a small village near the costline. The houses in the village are in risk of getting flooded. With Free and Open Data from The Danish Geodata Agency, we will find the buildings in the risk zone for 2 different sea levels.
How can we do this?
At first we create an elevation model from the Pointcloud. For better visualizing we create a Hillshade and Colorize the Elevation modelmap. Viewing in web with QGIS2ThreeJS. With the webmap we can see the sealevel increase a view the buildings. But it is only a view.
To find the exact buildings we have to make calculations for a scenario with 2 different sea levels. To find the buildings within the flooded area, we Convert the calculated Raster into Vector and perform a spatial query.
The buildings are then categorized and colorized. The flooded area calculated. Finally the map are presented in an Atlas and uploaded to the web.

Regards
Lene

Hi,

I know - I am a bit late about it - but next Monday there is the submission deadline at the FOSS4G conference: http://2016.foss4g.org/news-entry/call-for-submissions.html

Who is going to present on behalf of the QGIS project? I guess someone should provide an update on the QGIS project - what we achieved in the last year and provide any plans/updates/insight on QGIS 3.0 - if any ;-)

And how about workshops?

Did someone already submit something on behalf of QGIS and if yes - what?

Thanks for sharing,

Andreas

Hi!

Sounds like there is room for improvement. Would be nice to have
everything working consistent.
Probably ask on the UX mailing list if there is some reason for this
behaviour. But I guess (and IMHO) it should all work the same way.

Hi Richard (and all),
I'm still fighting with the menu translation of the plugin..

I read the Qt Documentation and other related questions in forums, but
I'm still struggling.

It seems that, as you said, the tr function should do the magic, but it
won't..

I found out that with the main menu the method
QCoreApplication.translate is used while with the submenus nothing is
used.. for example:


#main menu
self.menu.ModelSetUp_menu =
QMenu(QCoreApplication.translate("my_plugin", "Model Setup"))

#submenu of menu "model Setup"
self.actionProgramLocations = QAction( "&Program &Locations",
self.iface.mainWindow())



I tried to add the tr function in both, like

self.menu.ModelSetUp_menu = QMenu(self.tr("my_plugin", "Model Setup"))

#submenu of menu "model Setup"
self.actionProgramLocations = QAction( self.tr("&Program &Locations"),
self.iface.mainWindow())


and then updated pro file.. but in the final ts, these strings are not
taken into account..


I also tried to find other plugins that maybe have implemented this menu
translation function, but I did not find anything (just the UIs and
their strings translated, but not the menus)...

Somebody has an idea on how to implement that?

Thanks for the help

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposed plan to fix issue with concurrent opening
	of OGR datasources (aka QGIS and MapInfo)
Message-ID: <201603221031.47995.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi,

I'm considering addressing an issue that mainly involves concurrent use of a 
MapInfo TAB dataset by QGIS and MapInfo, as described in 
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/14378, although the planned fix would be a bit more 
general.

The problem is that when QGIS opens a OGR datasource it tries to open it with 
the update mode of the OGROpen() API, which in turn opens the underlying 
file(s) with a mode (dwDesiredAccess = GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE and 
dwShareMode = 
FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE with the Windows CreateFile API()) that is 
incompatible with the mode with which MapInfo tries to open files in read-only 
(dwDesiredAccess = GENERIC_READ and dwShareMode = 
FILE_SHARE_READ). Hence MapInfo cannot open a MapInfo dataset already opened 
by QGIS in update mode.

The solution I'm considering would be to modify the QGIS OGR provider to :
- try to open the dataset in update mode as currently, but if it is 
successful, go back to re-opening it in read-only mode. (we need to try to 
open in update mode so as to have appropriate capabilities)
- for operations like addFeatures(), addAttributes(), etc ... that need update 
permissions, check the current open mode, and if not update mode already, re-
open the OGR datasource in update mode
- go back to read-only mode when the user exists the edition mode (this would 
need a new method in the QgsVectorDataProvider API to warn about that, since 
the provider has currently no way of knowing that)

There would be of course a cost to pay due to this open / close operations, so 
I think I would limit it to shapefiles and mapinfo for now, since the opening 
of such datasets doesn't involve a lot of I/O ( the most costly is for 
shapefiles where the whole .shx is ingested into memory ).

Another related fix would be to implement reloadData() in the OGR provider so 
that the user can resynchronize its QGIS session for a dataset modified by 
another software.

Thoughts ?

Hi Matteo

The pieces to put together a functional translation are:

* Use a tr() function to translate strings in your app and "mark" them
as translatable for lupdate
* Let lupdate find the strings
http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/linguist-manager.html#lupdate
* Translate the strings (.ts files)
* Let lrelease compile the translation file
http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/linguist-manager.html#lrelease
* Load the compiled translation file in your app with a QTranslator
http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qtranslator.html#details
* tr() will now return translated strings instead of the original (menu,
label, whatever...)

Some of these jobs can be done by a Makefile or by qmake (.pro) but in
the background, the above steps are what actually happen

I hope this helps,
Matthias

I think the postgres provider already has a similar concept for
connection pooling. For read-only operations, a shared r/o connection
from the connection pool is obtained. When writing is required, a new
"transaction" connection with write capabilities is opened for the
duration of the r/w session. Maybe this concept can be mirrored by the
ogr provider?

Concerning the reloadData() method, there is already a forceReload()
method which reloads a changed dataset (on request) in QGIS. Is your
plan to implement a "change detection" and trigger this action
automatically?

It's good to see somebody as experienced as you with ogr taking care of
these issues.

Hi Matthias,

the last week I have updated the pyqgis cookbook with the the
translation chapter

http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html#translation

that should describe all the steps you described..

It seems the problem is that the strings "marked" with the tr() function
are not read by lupdate..


# mark the "Program &Locations" as translatable
self.actionProgramLocations = QAction( self.tr("&Program &Locations"),
self.iface.mainWindow())


# run lupdate
lupdate my_plugin.pro

but in Qt Lingust "Program &Locations" is not there.. I also looked
inside the file with a text editor but the string isn't there either..

Am I missing something?

Thanks Matthias for your time

Matteo

Thank you for taking care of that.

Could you elaborate on the last item ? Does it mean adding something
like beginEdit() / endEdit() on QgsVectorDataProvider ?
Is it an API break and if not how does it work for existing code that
does not call begin/end edit ?

Hi Matteo,

I was never very happy with qmake/.pro and try to avoid it, but this may
be a subjective thing. I'm normally using the scripts/update-strings.sh
script with a Makefile.

Here is also something to read regarding pylupdate

Hum, I've just looked at QgsTransaction / QgsPostgresTransaction and it is 
really meant at providers that can implement a real SQL transaction mechanism 
with BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK which most OGR datasources don't support, and 
in particular the MapInfo driver does not. In QgsVectorLayer::startEditing(), 
if there's a transaction returned by the provider, it goes through "pass-
through" mode instead of the edition buffer that gets "committed" only when the 
user saves its edition session. So I don't think the postgres way can be used 
in the OGR provider.

Hum, there's indeed a forceReload() method, only implemented by the OGR 
provider AFAICS and only used by qgsattributetabledialog (when you hit the 
Refresh button in the attribute dialog), that refreshes the read-only 
connections, but not the main connection maintained by the provider.

There's also the reloadData() method implemented by the WFS/WCS/WMS providers, 
and called by QgsVectorLayer/QgsRasterLayer::reload(), for example when you 
refresh the view with F5.  By implementing that one, I'd also close and re-
open the OGRDataSourceH ogrDataSource member of the OGR provider.

The existence of both API is a bit confusing. I guess the implementations 
should do the same thing. Hum.

I've considered this, but this is not in my immediate plans. With GDAL 2.0, 
GDALDatasetGetFileList() could be potentially used for that (since GDAL 2.0, a 
OGRDataSourceH can be cast as a GDALDatasetH).

From what I can see in QgsVectorLayer, you cannot call addFeature(), 
addFeatures(), changeAttributeValue(), deleteFeature(), deleteFeatures(), 
etc.. if there's no mEditBuffer active. And the only way to have one active is 
to call startEditing() before. So unless I'm missing something, it doesn't 
look like you can do changes to a dataset without doing them between 
startEditing() and commitChanges()/rollBack()

True.
But you can also directly access the provider update methods without
edit buffers and without startEditing / commitChanges.

... but after all ... if I understood correctly your intents, for
existing codes that use this direct provider access, update functions
will reopen the source in write mode and they will always stay in that
mode because the endEdit() method will never be called ?

Good point. I didn't think at that use case of direct access to the provider 
API.

Yes.

One possibility would be also to go back to read-only mode with a timer. For a 
write operation, outside of beginEdit() / endEdit(), that lead to re-opening 
in update-mode, after X seconds without write activity, the dataset would be 
re-opened in update mode.

Hi Matthias,

> script with a Makefile.

I did not find the script you are talking about (is maybe
scripts/update_ts.sh or scripts/update_ts_files.sh ?)

Anyway, I found out something that might be a little bit weird (at least
for me):

* if I run lupdate the menu(s) are not taken into account, while all the
dialog yes

* if I run pylupdate4 the the menu(s) voices are there..

the only uncomfortable thing with pylupdate4 is that you have to write
manually all the files that have to be read. So for example, my
my_plugin.pro file is:

FORMS = ../ui/*

SOURCES = ../my_plugin.py

TRANSLATIONS = my_plugin_it.ts


this file fits for lupdate, while with pylupdate4 I have to add each ui
file manually, like

FORMS = ../ui/dialog1.ui \
 ../ui/dialog2.ui

SOURCES = ../my_plugin.py

TRANSLATIONS = my_plugin_it.ts



it's not a real problem (it just takes a little bit time...) :)


Is this the expected behavior of lupdate and pylupdate4?

If yes, I can update the cookbook and change the command..

Thanks!

Matteo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS3: getting rid of Load layer toolbar?
Message-ID: <56F1299D.4020600@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I know it's early, but maybe we can start thinking about it: IMHO one
important target for Q3 will be to get rid of as much duplication as
possible. IMHO, loading layers is much more efficient through the
Browser than through all the single buttons; removing these will give a
much cleaner interface, and more predictable behaviour.
Unfortunately, there are still tasks that can only be done with the
buttons (e.g. loading PostGIS layers without an explicit PK is possible
through the button, fails through the Browser).
Should we start a list of missing functions, so we know what should be
done, and when we can drop the toolbar? Or does someone already have the
list? Anyone working on that?
All the best.

Is it true that a common criticism of QGIS versus Arc is the multiple "open"
buttons? Is trying to combine all open functionality (vector, raster, WFS,
WMS, dB, QGIS project, etc, etc) into one "open" button the best approach?

I'd also be careful at removing the toolbar.

I mostly rely on file based vectors & rasters, and I _love_ that the open
vector and open raster buttons are separated and each one remembers a
different last-used folder.

IMO there's a difference btween UI shortcuts (ie the buttons) and the
uniformity of layer loading UI. It'd be great to have a unified UI for
server-based layers, but I see no reason to kill the toolbar.

We could just ship QGIS with a different default configuration:

layer toolbar: hidden

what would the "single add data button" do? open a browser window? that
would be pretty easy.

regardless of this discussion, I like the ideas of:

 * fixing (or creating a list of) things that are missing from the browser
 * unifying the dialogs for adding layers

I'm a +1 on fixing this.  I have tried a few times in the past but I have
never come up with something that I like.

IMO I think having a single dialog (or not if we can) + the browser is
good. I have some tickets open with concepts but I'm not sure I would do it
like that now.

The browser is a powerful tool so I'm really +1 for finding any holes and
fixing those first.

This topic was discussed several times.

I remember, Nathan created nice mockup and description
for new unified "Add data" dialog, which can handle all data
types and supports their features

I am not sure to like this timeout ... I prefer when the state of
objects does not silently change in background :)
Doing nothing would be ok: existing (plugin) codes would lock under
windows, which is already the case, and would have the opportunity to be
safer by calling endEdit().

What about adding the re-open file code at the beginning and end of the
dataprovider functions (QgsOgrProvider::addFeatures etc.)?

If we're afraid that there is too little control this way, we could
still add a controlled "update state" to the provider and in case this
is already set, the re-opening will be skipped.

That could be done for sure, but wouldn't there be performance issues if the 
editing API of the provider are called multiple times in a sequence ? Although 
the methods that change the features take multiple features at once, so the 
effect of re-opening at the beginning and end of the provider functions might 
be limited.

That's a bit equivalent to the beginEdit() / endEdit().

We could have as valid scenarios :

1. beginEdit() ( or setUpdateMode(true) )
2. addFeatures() 
3. endEdit() ( or setUpdateMode(false) )

or

1. addFeatures() --> re-open implicitly to update mode if not already done, do 
the operation and let it in update mode

or

1. addFeatures() --> re-open implicitly to update mode if not already done, do 
the operation and let it in update mode
2. endEdit()  ( or setUpdateMode(false) ) --> go back to read-only mode

Anyone confirms?

Hi Matteo,

this Makefile also comes from the plugin builder:

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/sectorplot/blob/master/SectorPlot/Makefile#L183

In that line it points to scripts (also from the builder plugin):

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/sectorplot/blob/master/SectorPlot/scripts/update-strings.sh

which I used to update the strings. I realize these are all shell
scripts indeed, but you can use them to find the logic used to do all stuff.

Regards,

Richard

I've got something rather badly wrong in qgis2web. The plugin has a
/templates folder, and users are encouraged to add their own templates.
However, a user has just rightly pointed out that because /templates is
within the plugin folder, changes are lost when upgrading the plugin to a
new version. He has therefore lost his work.

How can I solve this? Does the plugin install process have permission to
write to a user's home directory as well as to the plugin folder?

You should not store stuff with the plugin itself. Store it in .qgis2 and
make a folder there.  There is API for resolving that folder path.

Yes, see here as an example to use that API.
https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe/blob/develop/safe/gui/tools/minimum_needs/needs_profile.py#L296

I would also suggest to use 'naming' there, for example make 'qgis2web'
directory there and create 'templates' folder under that dir so that it
won't mess up with other probable templates folder from other plugins.

The list of missing functionality of browser is rather long compared
to the individual 'load layer' dialogs - and some advanced
functionality is not well suited for handling in browser at all (e.g.
composition of WMS layer using multiple sub-layers and styles,
advanced PostGIS loading options, usage of more complex OGR drivers,
...). It is fine to keep improving browser capabilities, but there are
IMHO limits to it.

As others say, a unified load layer dialog should handle the more
advanced cases that browser cannot cover. It will be however a greater
undertaking to integrate everything nicely, as the individual dialogs
are quite diverse. Nathan's older mockups are surely a good start on
how to tackle that. It would be also good to put the functionality
from the standalone 'QGIS Browser' app to such 'load layer' dialog
(especially optional layer preview would be very helpful) and possibly
get rid of 'QGIS Browser' app altogether.

It is something I would like to address, but have not found enough
time for it yet. Recently I was thinking of starting a crowd-funding
campaign to do the transition - and QGIS 3 looks like a good
opportunity to do that.

Cheers
Martin

Thanks Martin and all. As usual, things are more complex than expected.
If it is so complex, probably we have more urgent and important tasks in
dealing with the Q3 migration.
All the best.

weird that I don't have any makefile there.. but that's sure not plugin

oh, tough stuff (for me) ;)
anyway, I see that in the update-strings.sh script, at the end, it has
been used the command *pylupdate4* and not *lupdate*.. and that was
exactly the problem I have reported (lupdate does not take the tr()
function into account)..

as I said, the only annoying thing I have to do is to write manually all
the UI files in the .pro one.. but that's not a problem at all..

I can change the cookbook with this new stuff.. what do you think about it?

Thanks guys for all the help

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Matteo,

Yes please.

Not sure if you are on Linux or Windows, but I thought to create a
feature request to move the Make/shell scripts to Paver/python:

https://github.com/g-sherman/Qgis-Plugin-Builder/issues/46

I'm ok with Make/shell as I use Linux, but maybe from the Windows/Mac
community somebody can pick this up.

Regards,

Richard

Hi Matthias,

> http://sergey.vlasov.me/2013/03/expanding-wildcards-with-qmake.html

thanks for the suggestion! I tried and tried but I get always the same
error:

pylupdate5 error: cannot open UI file '(../ui/*.ui)': No such file or
directory


can this be related to the fact that for the command is confusing that
the UIs are in the subdirectory ui?

Thanks again!

Matteo

Not sure, I thought that qmake would already expand the wildcard. And
the brackets look a bit strange in the error message.
But I've got no experience with it, so I'll have to leave it to you to
figure out the details, just wanted to point you towards a possible
solution to make your life easier.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New CSS for API documentation site
Message-ID: <1458744329323-5258016.post@n6.nabble.com>

I've had a go at improving the CSS for the API docs site
(https://qgis.org/api/). We've looked into how the changes might be
incorporated, and think we know how to proceed. However, it would be good to
get the changes tested - I've only tested it on Chrome/Win7 and IE11.

What would be the best way to do this? It's three CSS files, which replace
these:

https://qgis.org/api/doxygen.css
https://qgis.org/api/tabs.css
https://qgis.org/api/search/search.css

I can post my altered files somewhere, but thought I'd ask where I should do
this in the first instance.

Message-ID: <af2422a98c592e1636251da6c83bebd4@carto.net>

Hi, 

Sorry about my provocative e-mail subject ;-) 

In the current master master version, with the OSGeo4W installer, the
installer complains about: 

Package Unknown package 

python-future.bat exit code 1 

python-httplib2.bat exit code 1 

python-mock.bat exit code 1 

python-nose2.bat exit code 1 

When I start QGIS master, I get:  

ImportError: No module named future 

After that - everything based on Python is disabled ... 

So - is the installer looking for a package called python-future and
can't find it? 

Any hint would be welcome. 

Thanks and greetings,
Andreas

The packages are thin wrappers around pip, that actually installs or uninstalls
the package.  So they involve downloads from pypi - I guess it's a proxy issue
that blocks that for you (%OSGEO4W_ROOT%/var/log/setup.log(.full) should have
more details).

I guess I should come up with some script that installs the files locally an
produces a package from it.

That needs to be done anyway, because the "standalone" installer would
currently just include the wrappers and in turn download from pypi too...

Currently only master depends on the above...

Hi!

The "future-problem" is not only in the OSGeo4W or windows specific.
I also currently have it with my self compiled QGIS (master) on debian.

Did not find out yet what package I am missing.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in
  File "/opt/qgismaster/share/qgis/python/qgis/utils.py", line 20, in
    from future import standard_library
ImportError: No module named future

Any hint here?

regards
Werner

Hi!

FYI
There is no "python-future" in debian stable. python-future is currently
only available in sid.

There is a package called python-concurrent.futures but thats not THE
future package.

So all one can do is a "sudo pip install future" which works.

kind regards
Werner

"There is no "python-future" in debian stable"

I don't understand your problem. This is not the traditional way to install
Python modules

1) simply go to the  Python Package Index (PyPI)
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi>   and find  future
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future>  

2) the package documentation ( Python_future
<http://python-future.org/index.html>  ) says that "python-future is the
missing compatibility layer between Python 2 and Python 3. It allows you to
use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible codebase to support both Python 2
and Python 3 with minimal overhead."

3) and you can find the  future.standard_library Interface
<http://python-future.org/reference.html?highlight=standard_library#module-future.standard_library>  

4) Now, how to install the package ? -> simply with  pip
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/8.0.2>  , ( installation
<http://python-future.org/quickstart.html#installation>  )

    pip install future 

This is the modern procedure to install  Python modules for all the OS (and
not apt-get install python-future or other commands)

Hi

Thanks for the explanation and describing exactly the way how I have
done it. I dont have a problem with it :)
Still it is not the "standard" way to install python modules inside
linux distributions - and that was all I wanted to say with it.
(beside that installing it with pip installs the modules in
/usr/local/lib whereas a distribution package installs them to /usr/lib)

Of course you can always assamble it somehow. But still (as a lot of
other modules are packaged for distributions) one would expect to have a
distribution package ready - which is not the case for debian stable
(only for testing and unstable)

So while it is easy for "us" installing it - some people might have
never used pip and expect everything coming installed with the QGIS
package. And for now I doubt the QGIS package installs the future module
with pip. That was all I wanted to point out.

kind regards
Werner

Thanks, both. I've just implemented that. In documentation, what is the best

I suspect just say {userhome}.qgis2.  I might add a shortcut to open it in
the options dialog in QGIS as a shortcut.

I've consolidated my changes into one file, which hopefully contains changes
only from the original files above, and if included after them, should
overwrite the relevant rules. For the moment, I've put the file here:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/QGIS/blob/master/doc/api_custom.css

No idea where it should live, so I'm not going to issue a PR.

It needs proper testing, and as mentioned elsewhere, we'll either need to
drop the link in manually (no thanks...) or upgrade Doxygen to enable
HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET (yes please).

Just wondering - why a separate toolbar rather than extending the existing
labeling tools to be fully compatible with diagrams?

Our interface is already very cluttered with toolbars, I'm not sure another
new one which basically duplicates an existing one is a good idea.

Indeed, a label has to be "pinned" to be rotated. Why is there a difference
between the "move" action and the "rotate" action?

Should already be fixed - but takes new packages to land in the repository to
get visible.

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_HVouK3aMP-7vLX2WiqH8tW0yi1KW7NHQdWGrZGkQjSzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Can anyone tell me how can I, using Python, access to the "Add New Feature"
QgsRubberBand methods? Or maybe point me to same sample code?

I don't want to create a new rubberband, I would like to access the one
that is created by the drawing/editing maptools.

I can reach the current mapTool with,

iface.mapCanvas().mapTool()

But I'm not understanding how to from there

I wanted to use removeLastPoint() (or the undo() in ). The idea is to
simulate the backspace key functionality with a button to use in a tablet
device (Windows).

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Hi Alexandre,

The rubberband belongs to the internals of the maptool. As long as you
don't want to subclass the maptool I think the easiest way is to send
the backspace event to the maptool instead. And I would even say that
this is semantically the correct thing to do.

Hi matthias,

I thought about that as well, but was unsure about what would be the best
approach. Since the rubberband approach is not available I will try the
backspace event then.

Thanks!!

Hi, 
agreed with Nyall, currently in QGIS, diagrams are labels, using the same
collision engine and being drawn like labels, not layers. We could merge
labeling toolbar with diagram toolbar, probably without having to add any
new button (there are so many).
We need new to modify actions and tooltips, and not forget to keep it
readable in API doc. 
Cheers
Régis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] strange GetCapabilities caching
Message-ID: <1459189002.18093.31.camel@jordogskog.no>

Hallo all

First, Thanks a lot for QGIS and QGIS Server. It is  amazing software.

But now I have had a very frustrating problem for the last 5 hours.

After setting up a working QGIS server a few weeks ago, I now returned
to see everything working after some major refactoring at the database.

Nothing worked, and after some hours I started to get really frustrated
since we have just a few weeks until we go in production and I really
don't want to replace QGIS Server because of unpredictable behavior.

The error I had was:
Invalid Layer: WMS provider Cannot calculate extent Raster layer
Provider is not valid (provider: wms, URI:
contextualWMSLegend=0&crs=EPSG:4326&dpiMode=7&featureCount=10 ...

on all layers but one. 

I saw this question was asked several times at the net, but no one
seemed to have had any answer:
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/10634
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/7712
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/qgisserver-problem-td5095165.html


The last link solved it by a fresh install and now I understand why.

Finally I found the answer
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/WMS-provider-Cannot-calculate-extent-td5250516.html

But the OP didn't get an answer of his follow up question: Why the h...
is the GetCapabilities cached?

I ask the same thing, especially since a new version of GetCapabilities
is also fetched.

This is what made me use 5 hours on debugging (including turning the
server inside out, both database and uwsgi, nginx and so on).

The layers presented when connecting to the wms server was fresh and
new. But it seems like, when I tried to add the layer it used a cached
GetCapabilities, which didn't correspond to my new setup on the server. 

I could also sniff the GetCapabilities request. But I also saw that no
request was made when I tried to add the layer. So, now when I see the
whole picture I look rather stupid, but I couldn't imagine that I had
fresh data when connecting, but old data when trying to add the map.

Another thing that made things bad was the error message just flashing
on the top of my map. It didn't write anything to the log windows from
what I could see, and the message was shown in a too thin box. So I had

text in the too thin box to be able to read it.

Sorry for my frustrated tone. I still really love QGIS. But software
(any software) can drive you crazy sometimes.

I also suspect that I might get into exactly the same trap after a few
months when i have forgotten this. I hope I find this mail then on my
googling :-)

hi dev

Can any body explain why the qwt5 had removed from OSGeo4W installer???

It is required for build using older source codes.

How it could be downloaded.

Thanks

I feel your pain Nicklas.

I too recently battled this, for many many hours.  I was setting up a 
WMS service (through MapServer), with thousands of layers, but QGIS 
would quickly display an error of "WMS provider Cannot calculate extent 
Raster layer Provider is not valid", but only for the last layer in the 
list (?).  And yes, I was also having trouble copying this error, as it 
only flashed on the screen for a few seconds :)

I likely spent over 10 hours on this.  I have much WMS/OGC experience, 
but this odd error (only returned in QGIS) really tested me ha.

I was not aware of clear cache settings in QGIS options, darn.  I must 
have rebooted and it went away finally.

I hope this discussion helps others, so that they can debug their WMS 
issues faster.

Hi Jeff, Niklas,

Message-ID: <1459249248736-5258674.post@n6.nabble.com>

Currently, I detect the geometry type of input layers (which the user
supplies, so they could be anything) with layer.wkbType(). This fails
(returning -2147483646) if the input layer has z/m values (and will probably
also fail with eg curved geometries).

Is there a way to "flatten/simplify" newer/more complex geometry types into
simple point/line/poly types?

I've now locally tested running doxygen against QGIS master source,
specifying this file as HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET (I've changed which directory
it's in):

https://github.com/tomchadwin/QGIS/blob/master/cmake_templates/api_custom.css

I've made some additions and changes as a result. Most importantly, I've
removed all the colour declarations, instead setting the doxygen parameter
HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE to 113 (QGIS green). I've edited my fork's Doxyfile to
specify those two paramaters:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/QGIS/blob/master/cmake_templates/Doxyfile.in

Is Doxygen run as part of the build process, or is it run manually? In other
words, can I bump Doxygen in my fork, or do I just make a PR now with the
changed Doxyfile and additional CSS file? I can't find the Doxygen run
script in the repo.

The output definitely needs more testing and second opinions.

Hi Tom,

I think the api docs are built and updated nightly on an external server.
It's best to just do a pull request and include some screenshots. This 
way everybody can have a look, give feedback and review the changes.
Doxygen will probably be at an appropriate version on almost any builder 
out there. And for others it will be easy enough not to build docs or 
update their doxygen.

@Matthias OK, I'll do a PR tomorrow, and attach some screenshots. 

@Marco, yes, of course. I'll post some screenshots here tomorrow as well. A
couple of people saw some work in progress on Gitter, but this should be
more complete now. If you're concerned about major/crazy changes, please
don't worry. You're more likely to be disappointed that the changes are
small. 

It should give enough for people to work with and improve on. Hope it's of
use.

-2147483646 is actually QGis.WKBLineString25D, so this is the right
answer :)
But this is going to be removed in the future in favor of QgsWKBTypes

You can also convert a QGis.WkbType to a (new) QgsWkbTypes with
QGis.fromOldWkbType and have access to QgsWkbTypes.flatType()

Oh! The other values I'd come across having been in the range 0-6 or so,
that value totally misled me, though I did work out that it looked plausible
as a value in binary... Theme for the other methods - hopefully just what I
needed.

@Marco Here are a couple of screenshots:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/n9utuezb5h2zw0y/Screenshot%202016-03-30%2010.50.45.png?dl=0

As I say, this is just from my running Doxygen locally, with the two
parameters discussed above set. I don't know what settings the live Doxygen
for QGIS uses, so there will be some differences.

Hi List,

Can we remove plugin approval notifications from the qgis-developer
list? There is already enough traffic on this list. We could have a
dedicated plugin-announce list if there is a demand for this.
Is this ok for you?

Thanks

Hi Matthias,
IMHO it is useful to know what's going on. We all hate useless traffic,
but it happens fairly often that people redo already exixting plugins
just because they do not know they are available, so spreading the word
a bit further is useful.
You can easily filter out these messages if they are disturbing to you.
All the best.

I'll add more noise to the topic...

If we follow this logic we should keep only one list and not many (usr,
dev, ux).
I don't see the reason of not creating one dedicated to plugin approval,
testing, whatever.
If one wants to keep track of it, he can easily subscribe.


My 2 cts,

Denis

IMHO this is neither efficient nor adequate for this particular purpose.
In comparison with the nice search engine on plugins.qgis.org which
supports tags and descriptions and can be used at an appropriate time,
this channel here does seem to be a rather badly targetted tool with the
side effect of deteriorating the SNR.

All the best

one could argue that a "developer" that does not take the time to check
what is already in the repo will not take the time to go through tons of
emails to see what has been approved.

agree with Paolo and Anita,

we recently changed this, so it was more clear who was approving and
which plugins are being approved. The idea is also to make the dev
community a little more aware of which plugins popup etc

@Marco: the problem is that plugins are not in 1 repo (as they are in
separate owner repo's), so not other way to have a little sight on this
then in this way.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

do we get approval notifications from user own repos?? I didn't mean
code repo (github, SF, ...) , I mean http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/

Why on qgis-developer?  Shouldn't this be a least on qgis-user to also let
their potential users know that there is a new plugin?

I don't care much about these messages, my procmail moves them out of sight.
Anyone have a clever idea how to do the same with this and future threads on
the same topic? ;)

Maybe we could install procmail just behind mailman and have a community

The messages would also be a lot more useful if they included the plugin
description and changelog. Without those, I've no idea what the majority of
the plugins do, or whether the new versions are of interest to me. +1 for
getting them off the dev list, though.

That's just a click away, the notification contains the plugin detail page
url.

IIRC this notification was also added to prevent some plugin developer's
bad habit to send an mail to this list on every new plugin or version they
published.

​Because the idea was​ to keep the developers informed about which plugins

But I (and I imagine most people) am not going to click through, because of
the volume of approved plugins.

Hi, 

I agree with Tom. 

Either the mails contain more information or they should be moved to a
separate mailing list. 

It is a waste of time having to click on every plugin link just to find
out what the plugin does. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

For notification about new plugins that could probably be useful.  But then
it's more useful for users than developers.  So it should at least be moved to
qgis-user.  But for that a RSS feed on plugins.q.o might be better.  Doesn't
the plugin manager also have a opt-in notification mechanism for new plugins?

For the purpose to avoid duplication of plugins it seems quite useless to me.
People intending to write a plugin should be capable to search in the plugin
manager or on plugins.q.o if there is already something similar they can use
instead or base their work on - and if they aren't, they probably didn't manage
to subscribe to qgis-developer either.   And even if they did, they probably
already missed the approval of the plugin and are still doomed to reinvent it.

Is there anyone that actually finds this mails useful?  AFAICT so far there
were only voices that didn't find it useful or just thought it might be useful
to others - but no one said "keep it, I use it".

Hi all,
In gdalwarp Processing interface, in the console call, there is what it
seems an inappropriate message:
Invalid value for parameter 'SR di destinazione'
both when the parameter is empty, and when it is correctly filled.
It disappears only when changing some default options (e.g. resampling,
compression, etc.), thus displaying the command line.
Should I open a ticket?

Hi Jürgen, 

I agree that an RSS feed would be more appropriate than an announcement
on either the developer or user mailing lists. But also then, the RSS
feed should contain more than just the plugin name and link to be
useful. 

You are also right, that the QGIS plugin manager already contains a list
of new plugins - and dev/users can search on the plugin website. 

Moving the plugin approval notification mail to qgis-user would probably
annoy even more users than on the qgis-developer mailing list and would
probably result in a lot of unsubscriptions. 

So +1 from me to get rid of these messages. There are enough ways to
stay informed about new plugins (the plugin manager and the plugin
webpage). If that's not enough, the RSS feed idea or the QGIS blog would
be a better place to publish information on new plugins and their major
updates.

I didn't had other answer about my thread.
Nobody here can tell me if there is any tool that can analyse my

Many thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multiple calls to PyQGIS QgsServer instance causes
	segmentation fault
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=y_voDOOsfGcw7sZL=VqN4OiQttocam7-pLRAuR_VLYDg@mail.gmail.com>

I cannot give more informations because I don't have a debug environment
right now.
We're using QgsServer in a Python server app.

The basic use is:

server = QgsServer()
headers, body = server.handleRequest(q.urlencode())

We are facing this problem with GetLegendGraphic requests, we haven't
tested with GetMap or other request types.

it works fine with single requests but when multiple requests arrive it
crashes with segmentation fault.
Could it be a thread safety issue?

IMPORTANT: this happens only if we use QgsServer. Proxied calls to
qgis_mapserv.fcgi work fine.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Save Processing model outputs in SpatiaLite
Message-ID: <56FD5CB7.7070005@gmail.com>

Hi all,

from the Las Palmas HF it is possible to save the QGIS algorithms of
Processing in databases (both SL and PostGIS).

I've seen that these option is not possible with other providers
(gdal/ogr, SAGA...) and it is not possible with Modeler outputs even if
in the Modeler one uses only QGIS algs.

I think this is a super great feature.. Are there any plans to extend it
also for other providers and for Modeler outputs?

Thanks guys

Matteo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin metadata.txt icon directive
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.11.1603311523220.9600@www.localdomain>

Hi all: MetaSearch's metadata.txt [1] icon points to a .png file which serves
as both an icon representation on plugins.qgis.org [2] and an icon for
MetaSearch itself in QGIS.

We are updating the MetaSearch icon [3] to an SVG file.  While this works for
QGIS proper does the plugin metadata.txt definition allow for an SVG file?  Or
just, say, PNG (the documentation in [4] is not clear).

Any idea (I'll update the developer cookbook with the clarification)?

Thanks

..Tom

My guess is that it won't work well, if at all, in the plugins repo site.
>From memory, SVGs aren't embedded with an   tag, and a fallback raster is
needed anyway for browsers which struggle with SVGs. Perhaps the Django
handles all of that, generating a fallback PNG and writing the markup
required, but I'd guess not.

True, looks like it's not supported [1] [2] [3], given it's rooted in
Django image handling.

I'll update the dev cookbook to articulate image formats (png, jpeg, etc.).

Cheers
