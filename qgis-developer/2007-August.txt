Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 0.9 on
	windows:QgsApplication.setPrefixPath() has an invalid type
In-Reply-To: <004d01c7d3a5$4af60450$1b34d080@cseresearch.cs.washington.edu>
Message-ID: <20070801064359.E462C20874@spunkymail-a9.g.dreamhost.com>

Well, I have confirmed (on a new XP box) that after installing Python 2.5.1,
QT 4.3, SIP 4.7, PyQt 4.3.0, and QGIS from Tisham's zip file that QGIS works
(even the python console), but I can not get things to work with the simple
example I suggested below including the python bindings... that does work on
my linux dev box and my other Win dev box.  I get exactly the same behavior
as Jesse below when using the new preview zip.

To me this suggests that there is something amiss with the new preview build
that Tisham produced... but I am too tired to try and figure it out tonight.
So in summary:

1) On a fresh XP box and fresh installs of supporting libraries and the new
0.9 preview from Tisham I am not able to get the python bindings to work.

2) On XP, Ubuntu, and Mac OS I am able to get the python bindings to work
with a svn build of qgis and the same set of support libraries (also built
from source).  

I will try to work on this more tomorrow and see if I can work with Tisham
to get this issue resolved...

This is a freshly formatted Windows XP install.  It has

Python 2.5.1
PyQt 4.3.0 (from here http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php)
QGIS 0.9.0 Preview 1 from here
(http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis0.9.0preview1.zip)

Installed in that order, and that's it!

Hi,


how did it work? I mean: if they managed to use NVIZ only for image
rendering and QGIS for image display, this could interest also other
people (like me) who are searching for something like this for Web
interface

I didn't change anything and the lines should be displayed black. It happens
only on my debian debian installations (I tried stable and testing).
With opensuse 10.2 and it works fine as expected. 

The GRASS & QGIS installation is the same (qgis0.9.0pre1, GRASS 6.2.2)

does someone using debian have the same problem with any GRASS vector files?

 thanks

i dont know for oracle, mysql, postgresql but ogr supports that if the
fileformat allows it.. cf. e.g. the GRASS OGR driver..

http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_grass.html

(note however layered files are not that common in the standard use of
GRASS GIS)

that sounds reasonable..

that's not such a good idea. before any layer is created QGIS the
user should have the possibility to select the layers s/he wants.

Message-ID: <46B0356A.9060307@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
AFAICU, the spit plugin uses ogr2ogr to convert shapefiles in pg_dumps.
This often throws errors, whereas the equivalent shp2pgsl (from postgis)
performs much better.
I understand using ogr2ogr is much more general, and it could allow
conversion between many different formats, but I believe the efficiency
improvement could justify this switch.
Any thoughts?

I remember somebody reporting a similar problem; it seemed related to

Have you searched the bugtracker for this?

Hi,

we seek (commercial) QGIS support for this considerably urgent issue (3 
week deadline) concerning georeferencing in QGIS (ie Helmert 
Transformation on Gau?-Kr?ger2 coordinates). Find below a thread from 
qgis-dev.
The bug is fixed in 0.9, but svn commits in georeferencer plugin do not 
reveal where that happened or who has done that. Tim Suttons explained
> .... but one thing is that the QGIS library itself has undergone many 
> changes between 0.8.1 and 0.9 and as such it may be difficult to pn

Is anybody able to offer the service of extracting the bug fix from 0.9 
and backporting it to a patch for 0.8.1? If so, please do swiftly.

Cheers

Sebastian

Fortunately I do have access to clean XP machines to test with, so although
I may not be much assistance in solving the problem at hand, I can certainly
test future builds.  So keep them coming and I should be able to test
them....

It doesn't use ogr2ogr, but rather the OGR libraries directly.

SPIT was written as part of a student project and has never been  
revisited, although I made a few improvements to it. It could be  
worked on, or just turned into a front-end for shp2pgsql, although  
that tends to get messy when dealing with process calls for multiple  
platforms. My hunch is that it wouldn't take too much to solve the  
problems and make it more robust.

Any chance you are accessing your Debian boxes by remote X11 session

yes, and it seems to be a hardware problem as Paolo described. Can this be
solved somehow, except with another video card?

Hi all,
I developed a series of QGIS-GRASS modules that are tested on QGIS vers
0.8 and vers 0.8.1 with good results.

In the new vers (0.9) I see that there are some problems, when the same
modules must show the fields of table linked to the chosen vector. For
example the module that use the GRASS command v.to.rast with the option
to convert a vector to raster using attribute values is:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE qgisgrassmodule SYSTEM "http://mrcc.com/qgisgrassmodule.dtd">

<qgisgrassmodule label=" v.to.rast - Convert a vector to raster using
attribute values" module="v.to.rast">
    <option key="input" layeroption="layer"/>
    <field key="column" layer="input" type="integer,double"
label="Attribute field" />
    <option key="output"/>
    <option key="use" answer="attr" hidden="yes" />
</qgisgrassmodule>

The string:
    <field key="column" layer="input" type="integer,double"
label="Attribute field" />

show in the module window a string where you can choose the field to use
as cell raster value between all the integer or double field of the
linked table.

Now in the vers 0.9 the same module, and the similar ones, don't
work because the string where you could choose the field is now empty.


There is same changes in the relation with GRASS?
Or something to explain it?

Thanks.

Leonardo

I think so; have a look to the track, I think something has been noted
down. otherwise, try google.
It would be good if you could report it to the list.

Hi

Regarding access to clean xp machines here is a simple (and free  
assuming you already have an xp license) way:

- get virtual box from http://virtualbox.org/
- install a copy of xp in it
- clone the image and save it as a read only 'master'
- test and roll back as needed by making copies of the master

Regards

Tim

Tisham,

So I was diving into the weird behavior on the python side of the win
preview build and have not come to any definite conclusions this evening.
One thing of note is that PyQt4.3 was just released on the 30th of July.  It
is the first build to officially support QT 4.3.  Since your build was on
the 28th (or before) I assume you built PyQt 4.2 with QT 4.3.  I suspect
this is why you had to hack qmake.conf and might explain our strange
behavior.

On win, I have 2 boxes.  The first has QT 4.2, PyQt 4.2 and qgis svn from
about 3 weeks ago.  It runs fine and does not exhibit any bad behavior.  The
second has QT 4.3, PyQt 4.3 and the preview build and it does exhibit the
bad behavior.

To test, I am building first on my Linux box with QT 4.3 and PyQt 4.3 and
svn qgis just to verify that the problem is or is not their.  I prefer Linux
and will start there.  This will be the first time that I have built with
4.3, so it will be an interesting test.  

Next, if the Linux build does not exhibit the behavior I will build on my
win machine after updating to the latest of all projects and see if I can
reproduce there.

My gut tells me we are seeing a side affect of having PyQt out of sync with
QT and that if we get all of our versions lined up (with the newly released
pyqt) we will be ok... but that is yet to be seen!

More to come soon...

Hi all,

I have the final windows build ready. binaries and python bindings.

As well as grass and python.

The Python bindings will require an extra step of installing PyQt if  
not present. This can be quite tricky given the above patching of  
qmake needs to applied. Any suggestions are appreciated. Here is a  
summary of improvements needed in the installer, someone with  
experience in NSIS can help me out.


1) Python Install-Download Python, Locate Python location

Just a thought - would it be possible at least to make the point
symbols be rendered at much higher resolution than currently? That
would improve the map look enough not to notice the issue and be able
to produce proffesionaly looking hardcopies/PDFs. It would be a decent,
highly appreciated workaround until a fix is possible.

I don't think so, since the same rendering functions are used to get the
point symbols for the map canvas.
However, that gives me an idea for a workaround:  Set the symbol size to be
much larger, and in the print composer, set the symbol scale to be much
smaller.  I doesn't work perfectly, but it might help until we can implement
a better fix.

Message-ID: <46B1D52A.2020903@wheregroup.com>

Hi,
we run QGIS 0.8.1 on a KNOPPIX (debian-based) liveCD.
0.8.1 still has a bug in georeferencing that is fixed in 0.9. Asking for 
someone to create a patch for 0.8.1 resulted in silence so far.
The other feasible option would be to upgrade to 0.9. To what extent did 
library dependencies change from 0.8.1 to 0.9?

Cheers

Sebastian

Hi all.
We have several sets of symbols:
http://gfoss.it/drupal/simboli
they are free (now in CC, but this can be changed if necessary for their
inclusion in GPL programs) and in svg.
More will probably come.
The descriptions are mostly in Italian, but I guess most of you can find
their way around.
Enjoy!

Hi All,

I have made a fresh build with the PyQt4-Qt4.3 binary release and  
latest code in the release tag instead of my hand compiled and hacked  
release. I have also started automatic detection of Python and PyQt4  
work. It is preliminary now , if anyone has NSIS snippets that might  
assist me please let me know.

Here is the latest zip for people(Racicot and others) to test:
http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis0.9.0preview1.zip

This was what I tried to use to detect Python:
http://www.3dtree.com/ev/e/sbooks/leo/Leo/Examples/Books/D2_A_NSIS_Installer_for_Python_Applications/slide04.htm

Did not work so well.

Regards,

Hi,

you've pasted only a small snippet of code, so I can't say what's
wrong just from it. But I would guess that you're either not calling
initQgis() (which loads vector providers) or you set invalid path to
qgis in setPrefixPath()

If this is not your case, please provide the whole source file.
Regards
Martin

Hi,
python bindings really need sip 4.5 and pyqt 4.1 or later version.
That's because QGraphicsView started to be supported from pyqt 4.1 and
it has sip 4.5 as a dependency...

I'm not aware of doing any fixes related to the problem. There might
be another reason: it just got broken in 0.8.x releases.

Sebastian, could you test whether the problem is there e.g. in QGIS 0.7.4?

AFAIK change of the behaviour was part of fixes by Magnus Homann who
added this way possibility to measure distances and areas in degrees.
In my original concept I've expected that when measuring, everyone is
interested in measuring only in real distances/areas e.g. in meters,
making the design simpler.

I suggest to file a ticket for measure tool with ideas how it should
work in ideal world, what's needed there and what's not needed etc.
We'll try to fix current problems until the release of 0.9, if there
any ideas how to further improve measuring we can add them in some
future version since we're already in feature freeze.

Hi,

you should get QString from QgsApplication.prefixPath() - so I'm quite
surprised what happens for you... I didn't have time so far to try
Tisham's build, but to make sure that the problem isn't in the build,
could you test whether this happens also with my (slightly older)
windows build?
http://www.mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/qgis-trunk-070619-grass.zip

Or maybe something went wrong in the latest (4.3) PyQt release...?

Hi,

AFAIK there are no new library dependencies, neither need to upgrade
any libraries - in case you won't mind not having support for python
bindings. Their inclusion is optional, if used you'll need SIP >= 4.5
and PyQt >= 4.1

Which is quite unfeasible in your setting, I believe.

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0708051249u646cfe2qa39bc39e99b6510a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

with the removal of automake files, root of qgis files became cleaner.
I think we could do some more cleanups:
- remove INSTALL.svn - contains old information, all important is in
INSTALL file
- remove TODO - it not being used at all
- remove NEWS - file that has been never used
- remove ChangeLog ?? - it's not up-to-date anymore, makes impression
that last change has been done one and half year ago, many important
changes in history are missing, changelog can be fetched easily from
SVN
- remove qgis.spec.in - 3 years old specification file for RPM package
- I don't think anyone uses it
- move Doxyfile and qgis.man to 'doc' subdirectory
- there are two nearly identical files containing GNU GPL: one is
COPYING, other one is LICENSE.txt - the latter is a bit newer, I
suggest to copy it over file 'COPYING'

What do you think? Any objections?

Unfortunately both Tisham's newly posted build, and the one linked to below
result in the same thing under PyQt4.3 and Qt4.3.  I tried uninstalling
PyQt4.3 and Qt4.3, then installing older versions (PyQt4.2 and Qt4.2.3) with
the same results under both of Tisham's recent builds and the one linked
below.  I tried an older version of PyQt (4.1.1) also with the same results.

I am open to suggestions on what to try next.

Hi,

you should get QString from QgsApplication.prefixPath() - so I'm quite
surprised what happens for you... I didn't have time so far to try
Tisham's build, but to make sure that the problem isn't in the build,
could you test whether this happens also with my (slightly older)
windows build?

Or maybe something went wrong in the latest (4.3) PyQt release...?

I'm affraid that something's wrong with your Qt / PyQt. Regarding to
the Qt docs, QStringRef class has been introduced in Qt 4.3, thus it's
hard to believe that older versions of Qt and PyQt could have the same
behaviour. Please check whether the older versions (Qt4.2.x) are not
mixed with newer (qt4.3) somehow.

However, it should be possible to use string() or toString() member
functions of QStringRef classes that will return a QString.

Success!  I went to a fresh XP machine, installed Python 2.5.1, PyQt4.2,
Tisham's latest 0.9.0 windows build and the basic main window tutorial
loaded.  There is obviously some PyQt version problem with that other
machine I was using earlier, but now I know what is needed.

Thanks all, now we can start testing here!

Jesse,

Great news... I was just about to send out an email as well, as I was able
to get the latest what_nick build to work on my dev box with the old 4.2 set
of tools as well.  I was just verifying that it also worked on my clean box
after uninstalling all 4.3 related packages and reverting back to 4.2.

So out of this whole thing we have learned a few things:

1) We need to be very careful about how we document what versions of these
libraries the win binaries are built against so people can match them up in
their environment for custom development.

2) There are issues with the PyQt4.3/SIP4.7 combo with the tip build of
QGIS.  We need to track down what it is with the sip bindings that needs to
be changed to get these new packages to work.

Anyway, I am glad we have finally seen the light and got the combo that
works for you.  Oh, I guess there is one more lesson in all of this... it is
all much easier on Linux ;-)

thanks a lot for this info, so at the moment one has to compile sip and
pyqt from sources to get python binding support for debian etch and currently
also for debian testing. 

There exists a NOTE for this in INSTALL.t2t and I hope there will be
package updates soon to make it easier to provide python binding support for
debian and other linux distributions. I think current opensuse 10.2 has the same
problem.

thanks
 Otto

Hi,
and thanks a lot for reply. I'm sorry for my many questions but I'm
little "disperate"!
My first problem is how to set under UNIX the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (exist
it, under Mac OS X?!!!).
The code is the same of your 2nd tutorial: 2_basic_main_window, and
I've modified the python path and the qgis_prefix variable.

Hi Marco and Sebastian:Sorry for my late answer, I was out for a week.> > Is it possible that oracle, mysql, postgresql in ogr have multiple layers per > > datasource?The answer is yes, oracle, mysql  and postgresql can have multiple layers per dataset  in fact a ogr dataset points to a database.I have made some tests and I found some details:1.- URIS for diferent database servers use different syntaxis, ej: for mysql    the connection string is "MYSQL:dbname,user=username,password=secret" for OCI    is something like this "OCI:user/password@database" and for Postgresql is something    like this "PG:host=server user=user password=password dbname=databasename".2.- The ogr plugin uses a visual form to connect to the dataset and show a list of    available layers in the dataset, the user selects one and then the connection string    is sended to ogr provider constructor via qgis interface          mIface->addVectorLayer(URI , layername, "ogr");    but only the URI is passed to ogr provider constructor.could it be possible to add an alternate constructor to ogr provider that gets URI and layernameso we could do a simple test for "PG:", "MYSQL:" and "OCI:" in URI and if true, use the layernameparameter?Best regardsGodofredo Contreras > Date: Wed, 1 Aug 2007 09:17:16 +0200> From: scb@lo-res.org> To: qgis-developer@lists.qgis.org> Subject: Re: [Qgis-developer] about ogr provider> > Mon 30 Jul 2007 19:38, Marco Hugentobler wrote:> > The ogr provider is mostly used for reading shapefiles and GML.

I've installed sip4.7 and PyQt4.3 on my linux box (with Qt4.2.3) and
got also some errors during the compilation of QGIS bindings. They
should be addressed in r7129.

Message-ID: <46B8063E.8070109@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I have seen a recent commit:
http://svn.qgis.org/WebSVN/listing.php?repname=Quantum%20GIS&path=%2F&rev=7126&sc=1
which deletes the "third" dimension from a shp during import. It is much
welcome to avoid any crashes, so I welcome the fix very much.
However, PostGIS does support 3D vectors, so I guess we should fill a
wish for preserving all the info contained in the original file?
All the best.

To support 3 or 4 dimensions, we would need to use another PostGIS
function for import of geometries and I didn't want to unintentionally
break something in SPIT with such changes. So yes, you can file an
enhancement for this...

Done:

Perhaps it would be better to explain this, by showing "Import
Shapefiles as 2D layers in PostGIS" as a flag on the button?
This way the user is warned.
All the best.

Message-ID: <46BAD571.4090408@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
sip 4.7 is now in debian (unstable, but can be installed on testing
without problems). Tested, and it seems to work well.
So, one less thing to do to compile qgis from svn now.
Unfortunately, python-qt4 does not work (maybe the version [4.3]? my
hand-compiled 4.1.1 works).
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis 0.9.0 preview for Debian Testing (Lenny)
Message-ID: <20070810111811.GB26132@rigacci.org>

Hello GIS enthusiasts!

After some months of silence the repository debian.gfoss.it is 
back with some news. Our target switched from Debian Ethc (now 
stable) to Lenny (testing).

We packaged only Qgis with Pyton, because several packages 
(Grass, Proj, Ogdi) are already in good shape in Lenny.

We recompiled sip4-qt3 and python-qt4 for Lenny, because we are 
so impatient and cannot wait them from unstable.

Qgis was compiled from a SVN checkout dated 2007-08-07, we hope 
to make periodic build of Debian packages.

The resulting Debian package is named qgis_0.8.1-3_i386.deb, 
because I'm too lazy to figure out what should be the proper name 
(something like 0.9.0~svn ...?). Every dependency is satisfied by 
our repository and the standard Debian Lenny.

The Debian files are based on the work of Frankie Paolo Lovergine 
and hints from Otto Dassau.

As always we are standing on the shoulders of giants: we are not 
Offical Debian mantainers. We just hope to provide a quick way to 
use this piece of software with the easy of apt-get.

Refer to http://debian.gfoss.it/README

It would be great, also to align versions with the grass plugin of qgis
(0.9 should also be ready for FOSS4G).

Message-ID: <46BD9346.3090801@faunalia.it>

Hi.
Tim uploaded our new GRASS modules-thanks!
Now QGISsers can do *a lot* of stuff with GRASS. Especially (but not
only) for win users this is, I think, a big step forward.
A couple of things remain to be fixed, however:
- the very frequent crash while loading grass layers (a regression)
- attribute fields are not shown in the module window
I think these should be fixed before releasing 0.9.
All the best.

Please also keep in mind silly bug #738 which basically
renders GRASS on native Win32 useless for any
professional level work involving vector attribute
data.

I have tried finding the cause of this for weeks,
but in vain. Guess my Win32 system API skills are
just not good enough.

Btw., Cygwin versions of current GRASS 6.3.cvs run
just fine.

Has anyone here ever tried to get QGIS 0.9 running
with Cygwin based GRASS binaries?

Hi all,

I have just been churning out builds and installer without versioning  
them, this build is against SVN head , since tim merged the release  
tag back and the name in the Qgis run window is Ganymede now. The  
installer features Python 2.5 and PyQt4 detection. Should I automate  
the install of Python and PyQt4 if not found or leave it up to the  
user to install these first? comments are welcome.

Please test these:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] multiple inputs options in GRASS Toolbox
Message-ID: <46BF795D.4000601@ufg.uni-kiel.de>

Hi all,

trying to extend the QGIS GRASS Tools dialog, I am wondering if
QGIS 0.9 supports GRASS modules with multiple input
maps (such as r.patch).

In QGIS 0.8.1, GRASS Tools supports multiple layers options for
v.category. But the module dialog for v.patch seems pretty pointless
since multiple vector input maps are not supported.

Has support for GRASS modules requiring multiple input maps (like
r.patch, v.patch) been added to QGIS 0.9 or is this planned?

Is the GRASS plug-in still actively maintained?

Thanks,

Benjamin

I don't know of any plans about this. If you have the possibility to improve 
the GRASS module into this direction, I will be happy to apply the patches.

Hi

As far as I remember there have been no changes in teh GRASS stuff
since 0.8.x but it may be worth having a look at the svn log command
and see if you can find something.

Would it be possible that you somehow extend the URI string with the table 
name? E.g.: 'MYSQL:dbname,user=username,password=secret,table=roads' or 
similar? In the ogr provider class, you could then analyse the string and 
change it to strings that OGR understands. 

In my opinion it is better to stay with the constructor of 
QgsVectorDataProvider that takes only one string. The advantage of this is 
that you are compatible with the interface of the other providers. Is this 
possible for the ogr database plugin or did I overlook something?

Marco

Hi Tisham,

I've tried to use the compiler, seems to work. Just a note about
grass: all grass libs are doubled in the build, e.g. libgrass_gis.dll
and libgrass_gis.6.3.cvs.dll etc. - is that really necessary? Moreover
you should ship the whole grass installation with the installer -
otherwise the grass support won't fully work!

Regarding Python stuff, I think that we should make two different
installers - with python and without python. Only the installer with
python will check for presence of python2.5 and PyQt4. Doing this
differentiation in one installer seems to be more complicated to me as
the installer would need to come with two versions of qgis.exe.

Regards
Martin

Hi

I hevent tried with cygwin - but if they prove to work reliably with
QGIS and they are official GRASS products we should certainly consider
using them as a drop in replacement for the ones we currently have in
QGIS-win. To my mind it would be the most ideal situation if the QGIS
folks were not trying to maintain a separate build of GRASS binaries -
its a waste of effort and I think a source of numerous bugs and issues
since we are not experts in GRASS.

Tisham how will dropping in cygwin for you?

Regards

Tim

Hi

Do these errors look familiar to the GRASS folks at all? Theres not
even any reference to any QGIS libs or files so its difficult to know
where to begin....

Does QGIS segfault? I think on IRC you said it does but the stack
trace also showed showed no qgis calls. The grass thread / qprocess is
probably dying and bringing QGIS down with it...

Yes, it is possible. I made a test with a similar
approach and it seems to work with mysql and
postgres. This approach needs only small changes
to the actual constructor.

Hi Tisham

The help->about box should have the version of SVN used for the build.
Perhaps you could rename the installer .exe to some predictable format
such as:  qgis_preview1-snapshotyyymmdd.exe

Hi All,

I will 
1: tag with revisions 
2: cut down on the grass dll's.
3: make installer by default with python,  if preinstalled PyQt4 is not
detected the python bindings will not be installed.why are separate
builds of qgis needed for with-without python ?

Luca,
I am developing some custom apps with the python bindings and ran into a
similar issue with the ogr provider on OSX.  I never investigated fully as
we do most of our work on Linux and Win and I don't have the problems there.
There has to be some issue with getting the provider .so's to load after
using Williams frameworks stuff, but I don't know OSX very well.  I will
re-look at this again in the future, but don't have time right now.  Maybe
some of the Mac guru's of the group can try to run the python based tutorial
and see what they can find out...

I started Polish translation and I spent 2 days on it (a year ago).
I think there are more strings to translate now, especially form
big plugins like GRASS.

OK, I have attached my notes about trying to compile and run
QGIS 0.8.1 on Windows with Cygwin. It's messy (thanks to Windows)
to say the least.
But I managed to get everything to compile. However, trying to start
QGIS just resulted in a completely silent crash.
Maybe someone with more expertise on Windows C++ development could pick
it up from there and just get it to the point where QGIS (0.9?) starts
and runs with GRASS Cygwin.
I would then produce an up-to-date set of GRASS 6.3 binaries.

-------------- next part --------------
Installing GRASS 6.3.cvs with Cygwin on Win32

Everything works slower under Cygwin than native Win32, but the 
unix environment provided but Cygwin is very complete and robust 
so that it is easier to get things running the same as under 
Linux.

The most detailed instructions about GRASS on Cygwin are still 
here: [http://geni.ath.cx/grass.html]. Also, see this old Wiki 
page with lots of hints: [http://geni.ath.cx/wiki_cygwin_grass.html]
.

The most up-to-date instructions and Cygwin packages are here: [http://grass.itc.it/grass62/binary/mswindows/]
.

These installation instructions are for users with administrator 
privileges that can do system-wide installations of the software. 
I have not tested this for restricted user accounts.

You will likely need a good text editor that can also handle Unix 
EOL characters correctly. Download and install PSPad from [www.pspad.com]
. It will make your Windows life much easier!

  TODO

??? Explore the possibility to install Cygwin with normal user 
  privileges for current user only (setting ``Just Me'' in 
  Cygwin's setup.exe options).

??? User home directory is per default in c:\cygwin\<username> but 
  this can be changed! Change it to the regular Windows home 
  folder? Problem: this has spaces!

??? Add SQLite support: get sqlite.exe to compile!

??? Test PostgreSQL support

??? Add ODBC support (possible?)!

??? Motif support for GRASS?

??? MySQL support?

??? Freetype support for GRASS.

??? Python bindings for QGIS 0.8.1 (see INSTALL file in QGIS source 
  dir).

1 Cygwin Installation<sec:Cygwin-Installation>

Cygwin DLL version 1.5.24-2

1.1 Installing the base system

Download setup.exe from [www.cygwin.com] to ``inst''.

Run ``setup.exe''

Select ``Download without Installing'' and download packages to 
directory ``inst\cygwin-packages''.

Adjust Internet Connection settings if necessary.

Choose a Download site (http://linux.rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de).

In addition to the default selection, add these packages:

??? Archive

  ??? unzip

  ??? zip

??? Database

  ??? postgresql

  ??? postgresql-devel

??? Devel

  ??? autoconf

  ??? automake 1.9

  ??? binutils

  ??? bison

  ??? byacc

  ??? cvs

  ??? doxygen

  ??? flex

  ??? gcc

  ??? gettext

  ??? gettext-devel

  ??? libfreetype2-devel

  ??? libiconv-devel

  ??? libncurses-devel

  ??? libtool1.5

  ??? libxml2

  ??? libxml2-devel

  ??? make

  ??? nasm

  ??? patchutils

  ??? pcre

  ??? pcre-devel

  ??? pkg-config

  ??? readline

  ??? subversion

  ??? swig

??? Editors

  ??? mc

  ??? nano

  ??? nedit

??? Graphics

  ??? ImageMagick

  ??? gd

  ??? ghostscript

  ??? ghostscript-x11

  ??? gnuplot

  ??? jpeg

  ??? libgd-devel

  ??? libgeotiff

  ??? libgeotiff-devel

  ??? libproj-devel

  ??? libtiff-devel

  ??? netpbm

  ??? proj

  ??? tiff

??? Interpreters

  ??? python

??? Libs

  ??? gsl: Runtime

  ??? gsl-devel

  ??? libgdbm4

  ??? ncurses

  ??? popt

  ??? sunrpc

??? Math

  ??? fftw3

  ??? fftw3-dev

??? Text

  ??? gv

??? Utils

  ??? screen

??? Web

  ??? wget

Now download the packages. If the download should be incomplete: 
it can be restarted from another source. The package selection 
will be preserved.

Now run setup.exe again to install all downloaded packages: 
Select ``Install from Local Directory''.

Next, choose the Installation Directory. A wise choice is 
C:\cygwin (default). Make sure that ``Default Text File Type'' is 
set to ``Unix/binary''.

Next, set the ``Local Package Directory'' to where the packages 
where downloaded to ``inst\cygwin-packages''. Set the ``All'' 
category to ``Install''. All downloaded packages should now be 
selected for installation. Install them! If the installer 
recommends to install additional packages (dependencies): just 
confirm.

The installation may take a few minutes as a lot of Unix software 
will be installed.

Also add C:\cygwin\bin to the Windows Environment Variable ``Path''
. This way you will be able to run the many useful Cygwin Unix 
tools from anywhere on the command line.

1.2 Updating and adding packages<sub:Updating-and-adding>

Just rerun setup.exe and select ``Download without installing''. 
You will be able to download more packages. Then rerun setup.exe 
again, this time ``Install from Local Directory'''' and make sure 
to select the newly downloaded packages. Keep all other 
installation setting (path!) the same: the new software will be 
added to your installation.

Once you are done installing Cygwin, update the binutils (linker 
and friends) if you plan to compile any software yourself. Create 
a directory binutils, change into it, then do:

cvs -z 9 -d :pserver:anoncvs@sourceware.org:/cvs/src login 

Enter "anoncvs" as the password.

cvs -z 9 -d :pserver:anoncvs@sourceware.org:/cvs/src co binutils

Compilation of binutils:

cd src

automake

./configure --prefix=/usr

make

make install

1.3 Cygwin usage hints

Nothing so far.

2 Installing GRASS and dependencies

UPDATE THE binutils PACKAGE (see [sub:Updating-and-adding])!!! 
Otherwise linking GRASS' Vlib with the GDAL lib will fail!

All required source code packages need to be downloaded to the 
Cygwin home directory of a user with admin privileges (if Cygwin 
has been setup for system-wide usage).

Windows only looks for shared libraries (DLLs) in executable file 
directories or in the same directory where the application was 
started! This is a heavy design flaw that Cygwin is unfortunately 
also subjected to. So remember to copy compiled DLLs (e.g. GDAL!) 
to /usr/bin as well!! If some program just dies w/o any error 
message, it's usually because of some DLL that's not in the path. 
You can use cygcheck.exe <program> to test for such problems.

The C compiler supplied by Cygwin is GCC version 3.4.4.

2.0.1 SQLite

TODO: does not work yet (see below), so for now no SQLite 
support!

Version 3.4.0 from [http://www.sqlite.org].

SQLite only works as a static lib under Cygwin and the 
configuration script is a bit buggy:

./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-tcl

make

Warning appears: 

libtool: link: warning: undefined symbols not allowed in 
i686-pc-cygwin shared libraries

Even though shared libraries were disabled in the configure 
script!

This leads to a failure when attempting:

make install

Error message:

It is possible to produce the sqlite3 shared lib, however:

make clean

./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-tcl

make sqlite3.dll

cp sqlite3.dll /usr/bin/

Copy DLLs to /usr/bin (see general notes at start of this 
section) as well!

We also need to copy the C development headers by hand:

cp *.h /usr/include

Now we have all we need from SQLite in order to compile GRASS and 
QGIS. Unfortunately, the command line program to manage an SQLite 
database (sqlite.exe) is missing. But might be possible to 
download and use the Windows binary for sqlite.exe from the 
SQLite homepage!

2.1 UnixODBC

Tested version 2.2.12 from u[www.unixodbc.org]:

./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-gui

make

Aborts with: 

gcc -g -O2 -DENABLE_INI_CACHING -o isql.exe isql.o 
../DriverManager/.libs/libodbc.a -ldl /usr/lib/libiconv.dll.a 
../extras/.libs/libodbce

dline -lpthread

isql.o: In function `OptimalDisplayWidth':

/home/Administrator/unixODBC-2.2.12/exe/isql.c:236: undefined 
reference to `_SQLColAttribute'

/home/Administrator/unixODBC-2.2.12/exe/isql.c:237: undefined 
reference to `_SQLColAttribute'

...

2.1.1 GEOS

Version 2.2.3

Get it from [http://geos.refractions.net/].

./configure --prefix=/usr

make

make install

2.1.2 GDAL<sub:GDAL>

Upddate the binutils PACKAGE (see [sub:Updating-and-adding])!!! 
Otherwise linking GRASS' Vlib with the GDAL lib will fail!

Version 1.4.2 (and gdal-grass 1.4.1) from [www.gdal.org].

Install GDAL w/o GRASS support. Some configure options need to be 
set to produce shared DLL libraries:

./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared=yes --without-libtool 
--without-python

IMPORTANT: Make sure you do not create a static version of GDAL 
by accident. If there is a libgdal.a lying around in /usr/lib 
already: make sure to delete it, otherwise, you probably not even 
be able to configure GRASS correctly!

This should enable support for PostgreSQL and GEOS but not GRASS. 
GRASS support will be enabled later using gdal-grass.

make

make install

Make a copy of libgdal.dll.1.4.2 and call it libgdal.dll.

Copy DLLs to /usr/bin (see general notes at start of this 
section)!

2.1.3 GRASS 6.3.CVS

We need a GRASS version that runs w/o X11 and Tcl/Tk so we have a 
GUI-independent core that we can connect with QGIS.

For GRASS, we use latest CVS sources (Fri, July 13th 2007), as 
these are most extensively modified to work on Windows.

Change into home dir.

touch .cvspass

export 
CVSROOT=:pserver:grass-guest@intevation.de:/home/grass/grassrepository 

cvs login

Password is 'grass'.

cvs -z3 checkout grass6

This will put the most recent sources into the directory grass6.

Subsequent updates:   

cvs up -dP

We cannot configure GRASS w/o GDAL anymore, as GDAL is now a 
mandatory lib. 

Change into grass6 source directory. 

./configure --with-readline --without-nls

(NLS enables language localizations resulting in horrible GUI 
strings.)

This should enable pretty much the full GRASS feature set 
(except: see TODO section at top of this document. Also BLAS and 
a few more things are missing that are useless, anyway).

make

This should create all enabled modules currently in CVS w/o 
compilation errors!

make install

will put everything into /usr/local/grass-6.3.cvs inside your 
Cygwin install directory.

Now we need to install the GRASS driver for GDAL. Version 1.4.1 
of gdal-grass should work fine:

./configure --with-grass=/usr/local/grass-6.3.cvs/ 
--with-gdal=/usr/bin/gdal-config --prefix=/usr

make

make install

This concludes the basic GRASS setup.

2.2 Cygwin tuning

Make a copy of c:\cygwin\usr\X11R6\bin\startxwin.bat as 
c:\cygwin\GRASS.bat.

change 

%RUN% xterm -e /usr/bin/bash -l

to

%RUN% xterm -e /usr/local/bin/grass63

The X server will keep running after GRASS was exited. However, 
this just gives an annoying error message when running GRASS.bat 
again without first manually quitting the X server.

2.3 Bugs and pitfalls

??? MAJOR BUG: Resizing an X monitor sends it into an endless ``
  Redraw'' sleep state (but only if some d.* was sent to it 
  before). However, gis.m monitors work.

??? The instructions assume that Cygwin is installed in C:.

??? It does not seem to go well to have two different versions of 
  Cygwin running on the same machine.

??? Many problems with the Tcl/Tk login GUI

  ??? The TclTk login screen complains about ``invalid mapsets'' if 
    the location is stored on a network drive and there are 
    permission problems (?). However, text login works fine.

  ??? Clicking on ``Exit'' in the TclTk login GUI still starts 
    GRASS!

  ??? Clicking on ``Projection Values'' to define a new Location 
    just gives an error message ``Invalid switch -''/usr''''. The 
    problem originates from this line:

  exec -- cmd.exe /c start $env(GISBASE)/etc/set_data

  in the file etc/gis_set.tcl. Apparently, the ``start'' command 
  interpretes the GRASS installation path as a command switch 
  because of the leading ``/''!

  HOTFIX: replace with

  exec -- xterm.exe -e $env(GISBASE)/etc/set_data 

  ??? This line is actually meant for MINGW GRASS! It wrongly 
    assumes that Cygwin GRASS works just the same, so this fix 
    cannot go into CVS. Instead, we must differentiate between 
    MINGW and Cygwin here.

  ??? Also, the set_data text screen checks for the path of the 
    database starting with ``/''. This makes sense on a Unix 
    system, but in the case of Cygwin it just forces uses to 
    learn about the /cygdrive/drive# convention, which is a 
    nuissance.

??? Browsing documentation: not clear how to invoke the system's 
  HTML browser. For now, users can just open the local index.html 
  file with their favourite browser.

2.4 TODO

??? Get NVIZ to work: 

  ??? nviz lives in etc/nviz2.2/nviz.exe. However, there is also an 
    nviz.bat in bin!

  ??? complains about not being able to find init.tcl in a (pretty 
    dumb) searchpatch. Linking /usr/share to /share helps, but 
    nviz still crashes after showing some initial GUI elements. 
    Cygcheck

  ??? nviz.bat complains: ``The system cannot find the path 
    specified''

??? Compile with SQLite support.

??? Compile with UnixODBC support.

??? Compile with MySQL support.

3 QGIS with Cygwin GRASS

This is really tricky. Basically because Windows is a horribly 
designed operating system with minimal support for standards such 
as Posix and compilation of complex software is a nightmare. The 
problem is that we need to compile a mix of Cygwin libraries 
(i.e. with a Unix emulation layer that includes sockets etc.) and 
``pure'' Win32 API and C runtime. It can be done but you must pay 
attention to every detail as described below.

QGIS and Qt4 are compilable on Windows using the free MinGW. As 
opposed to Cygwin, MinGW just links binaries to the original 
Win32 runtime libraries. It does not provide a Unix emulation 
layer like Cygwin does.

3.1 Preparations

Download QGIS 0.8.1 sources from www.qgis.org. Unpack the sources 
into your Cygwin home folder. The INSTALL file has notes about 
compilation on Windows using MingW.

Download the Qt open source edition for Windows including MinGW 
from here: [http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows]. 
Run the installer and install the Qt software (default: 
C:\Qt\4.3.0). Select to download and install MinGW into c:\MinGW. 
This installs a version of MinGW that Qt is sure to work with.

To make your life easier, also download and install MSYS 
(1.0.11-2004.04.30-1.exe) from [www.ming.org] and install to the 
directory C:\msys. The install script will try to ``normalize'' 
your MinGW environment. Just answer ``y'' and supply the path to 
your MinGW installation (c:\MinGW). NOTE: You need to remove or 
(better) rename sh.exe (the Unix shell) in C:\msys\bin as this 
will interfere with the CMake build process later!

To complete the MinGW environment, you need the flex and bison 
utilities. THEORETICALLY, they should be availabe here: [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=82724]
. THEORETICALLY, you should just have to download the packages, 
unpack (e.g. with [www.izarc.com]) and add the contained files to 
the same folders (bin, lib, ...) in your MSYS directory (not 
MinGW!). BUT THIS WON'T WORK!

The problem is that bison will not find its macro definitions and 
always spit out a message like this: 

/msys/share/bison/m4sugar/m4sugar.m4': No such file or directory

Bison only works if you start MSYS via it's own startup script 
msys.bat. This will set the path correctly. HOWEVER, this will 
also attempt to start sh.exe and since we can't allow that (see 
above), we are f*****!

The current solution is a bit awkward: rename Cygwin's shell 
(c:\cygwin\sh.exe) to sh.org, then finish the QGIS compilation 
process, afterwars rename it to sh.exe again to get it working 
again (sorry...).

For compilation to work, we must add some folders to the Windows 
PATH environment, so linking to DLLs can be done. Edit 
C:\Qt\4.3.0\bin\qtvars.bat and add the following line to the 
sequence of ``set PATH'' statements (in this order!):

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin;C:\cygwin\bin

set PATH=%PATH%;c:\cygwin\lib

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\cygwin\usr\local\grass-6.3.cvs\lib

Also add C:\Qt\4.3.0\bin to the Windows Environment Variable ``
Path''. This will make it easier to run the basic Qt tools from 
anywhere.

You can skip all the other tools mentioned in the QGIS INSTALL 
file as you already have the Cygwin versions of these available 
at this point.

Now we need Cmake, a tool to configure multi platform source 
codes that is needed by QGIS. Download from [http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.4/cmake-2.4.6-win32-x86.exe]
 and install. The installer suggests a path with spaces by 
default, so you might want to change this to something more 
simple like c:\cmake just ot be on the safe side. This is a 
special Windows version with GUI. Let the installer add it to the 
system PATH if you like.

Again, edit C:\Qt\4.3.0\bin\qtvars.bat and add the following line 
to the sequence of ``set PATH'' statements (adjust path if you 
chose to install Cmake somewhere else):

set PATH=%PATH%;"C:\Program Files\cmake\bin"

3.2 Compilation of QGIS

Start a regular Windows command line (cmd.exe). Then cd into your 
Cygwin home dir and to the dir where you have previously 
downloaded and unpacked the QGIS 0.8.1 sources.

Execute qtvars.bat to set environment variables correctly.

Configure the source: create a directory for the build inside the 
QGIS source dir and change into it. Then run CMake:

md build

cd build

cmakesetup ..

The GUI should show correct source and build dirs. Press ``
Configure'' and choose ``MinGW Makefile'' (works on Windows XP; 
use ``MSYS Makefile'' for Windows 2000).

The configuration should find everything OK except some libraries 
and include files which are in the Cygwin dir and must be 
specified manually (SELECT ``Show Advanced Values!''):

BISON_EXECUTABLE = C:/cygwin/bin/bison.exe

CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = C:/MinGW/bin/g++.exe

CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS = '-Ic:/MinGW/include'

CMAKE_C_COMPILER = C:/MinGW/bin/gcc.exe

CMAKE_C_FLAGS = '-Ic:/MinGW/include'

CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS = '-Lc:/MingW/lib'

CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM = C:/MinGW/mingw32-make.exe

CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS = '-Lc:/MingW/lib'

CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS = '-Lc:/MingW/lib'

FLEX_EXECUTABLE = C:/msys/bin/flex.exe

GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR = C:/cygwin/usr/include

GDAL_LIBRARY = C:/cygwin/lib/libgdal.dll

GEOS_INCLUDE_DIR = C:/cygwin/usr/include

GRASS_PREFIX = C:/cygwin/usr/local/grass-6.3.cvs

PROJ_INCLUDE_DIR = C:/cygwin/usr/include

SQLITE_INCLUDE_DIR = C:/cygwin/usr/include

Press ``Configure'' again. Some more dependencies will not be 
found and must be set manually:

EXPAT_INCLUDE_DIR = C:/cygwin/usr/include

GSL_INCLUDE_DIR = C:/cygwin/usr/include/gsl

GSL_PREFIX = C:/cygwin/usr

POSTGRES_INCLUDE_DIR = C:/cygwin/usr/include

Press ``Configure'' again. There should be no more missing 
critical dependencies. Make sure that:

WITH_BINDINGS = OFF (Python disabled for now)

WITH_GRASS = ON

Select ``OK''. When the configuration is done, compile and 
install with:

make

make install

Create a folder grass in the qgis install dir. Copy all files 
from the GRASS installation compiled under Cygwin (located in 
/usr/local/grass-6.3.cvs) in there. Move all files from the 
grass/lib directory into the QGIS main installation dir so 
Windows will find them.

Copy GDAL DLLs and executables from the Cygwin installation into 
the QGIS main dir:

proj.exe:

Copy Cygwin DLLs (from c:\cygwin\bin) into the QGIS main dir:

cyggeos-2.dll

cygwin1.dll

cygproj-0.dll

cygpq.dll

cygcrypt-0.dll

cygcrypt-0.9.8.dll

cygintl-3.dll

cygiconv-2.dll

cygssl-0.9.8.dll

libgdal.dll

cyggeos_c-1.dll

cyggeotiff-1.dll

cygtiff-5.dll

cygz.dll

cygjpeg-62.dll

cygjasper-1-701.dll

cygpng12.dll

cygintl-8.dll

sqlite3.dll

Also, remember to rename Cygwin's sh.org back to sh.exe so you 
will have a shell to work with!

Message-ID: <200708151620.20186.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Dear qgis devs,

In the psc, we recently talked about having more formalised processes and 
clearer responsibilities in the qgis team.

From the development side, I'd like to have code maintainers for different 
parts of the code, e.g. for the different plugins and providers and parts of 
the qgis libs. A code maintainer would review patches for the corresponding 
part, coordinate the efforts of interested developers, answer questions and 
make sure the code is in a clean and up-to-date state. I hope that such an 
organisation will help us to better coordinate our efforts and make it 
clearer for new developers where to ask for guidance. It would also be 
visible which modules currently lack a maintainer (e.g. in my opinion GRASS 
module).

The code maintainers would add one or more lines to their e-mail signature 
such to make it clear for everyone, e.g.

Tim Sutton
.....
Maintainer QGIS raster module
... 


I could imagine the following parts of code:

- raster: Tim
- python bindings: Martin
- core lib: Martin
- gui lib: Martin
- app (dialogs): Tim
- mapserver export: Gary
- delimited text: Gary
- print composer: Steven
- wfs, wms: Marco
- renderers: Marco

and other parts that need maintainers:
- GRASS plugin/provider
- postgres provider
- ogr provider
- gps plugin/provider
- georeferencer plugin
- project file


What are your opinions about this this in general? Do you like it too or is it 
just unnecessary complication?

For the areas of code, I'm sure I missed a lot of things. And probably there 
are even volounteers for the second part of the list...


Regards,
Marco

perhaps Peter Ersts will 'volunteer' to assist with raster stuff? :-)

Hi all,

New builds for 0.9 release are up, i cleaned up the duplicate grass  
stuff. Other than that no major changes.
They are tagged with date:
http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis0.9.0preview1.16.08.2007.zip
and
http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis_setup0.9.0preview1.16.08.2007.exe

With regards to resposibility and patch approval I think that's a very  
good idea. I need someone to bother and send some ossim integration  
patches to for raster support extension.

Meanwhile I am working on Eclipse and Visual C++ Express as IDE's for  
Qgis development. Qt4 works fine with Microsoft compilers just the  
CMake files need a bit of fixing up, anyone done any progress on this ?

Cheers,

Tisham.

Hi Marco,

I like this idea... I'm also wondering what should we do with code
without a maintainer...

In my opinion this is not really needed, I would just prefer keeping
the list of maintainers somewhere on wiki page...

I'm fine to maintain these parts of code.
By the way, we should start calling qgis python bindings just shortly PyQGIS.

Message-ID: <200708162005.16097.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Hi,

In QgsRasterLayer::drawMultiBandColor there is a section of code (line 2463) 
that is problematic for some files:

if ( myRedValueDouble == noDataValueDouble || myRedValueDouble != 
myRedValueDouble)
      {
#ifdef QGISDEBUG
        //	QgsLogger::debug("myRedValueDouble", myRedValueDouble, __FILE__, 
__FUNCTION__, __LINE__, 1);
        //	QgsLogger::debug("noDataValueDouble", noDataValueDouble, __FILE__, 
__FUNCTION__, __LINE__, 1);
#endif
        continue;
      }

I have a file where the noDataValueDouble for the first band is 0, so the 
method does not set pixel colors where red component is 0. This results in an 
image displayed in wrong colors. Is it ok if I replace the if-statement with:

if(myRedValueDouble == noDataValueDouble && myGreenValueDouble == 
noDataValueDouble && myBlueValueDouble == noDataValueDouble)
?

My example image shows correctly like this.

Regards,
Marco

Marco,

Just to clarify are you saying that the no-data-value is different for 
each band/channel in your image?

If the bands use the same nodatavalue then technically checking just the 
red channel should be sufficient, though there is a question in the code 
regarding whether all channels should be checked. Additionally, with the 
QgsRasterLayer in trunk you can not manually set the no-data-value. This 
was updated in the raster transparency branch, so that you can manually 
set the nodatavalue.

If you want to make the change anyway, then I would suggest
if((myRedValueDouble == noDataValueDouble || myRedValueDouble != 
myRedValueDouble) && (myGreenValueDouble == noDataValueDouble || 
myGreenValueDouble != myGreenValueDouble) && (myBlueValueDouble == 
noDataValueDouble || myBlueValueDouble != myBlueValueDouble))

if the nodatavalue is NaN, I believe that NaN==Nan always returns false.

No, all the bands have 0 as nodata value.

In the case of my example, checking all the bands seems reasonable to me.

It may however be a problem for other cases, if e.g. nodata value is -9999 and 
only red band has nodata value. Though that case may not be very likely.

That's a good suggestion, I didn't consider NaN.

After a few more minutes of thought on this I think all three channels 
should always be check. For straight image data that are from, say a 
satellite, the nodatavalue areas would typically overlap exactly so any 
pixel in the channel stack could be used. However, the user could in 
theory create their own composite multichannel image from data layers 
that have nodatavalues at any location, and may appear in only one, two, 
or all three of the displaying channels/bands. So

if((myRedValueDouble == noDataValueDouble || myRedValueDouble != 
myRedValueDouble) &&
   (myGreenValueDouble == noDataValueDouble || myGreenValueDouble != 
myGreenValueDouble) &&
   (myBlueValueDouble == noDataValueDouble || myBlueValueDouble != 
myBlueValueDouble))
{
  continue;
}

requires that all three values be nodata and will work fine with typical 
image data but not well the the user created composite image where as

if((myRedValueDouble == noDataValueDouble || myRedValueDouble != 
myRedValueDouble) ||
   (myGreenValueDouble == noDataValueDouble || myGreenValueDouble != 
myGreenValueDouble) ||
   (myBlueValueDouble == noDataValueDouble || myBlueValueDouble != 
myBlueValueDouble))
{
  continue;
}
requires only one value in the channel stack to be nodata to skip the 
current pixel and would be the most robust case

In your situation where you want 0,0,0 to be 'nodata', but 0,255,255 to 
display that would best be done by setting 0,0,0 as transparent pixel 
rather than saying 0 is the nodatavalue.

What do you think?

I posted a patch for this a few weeks back. I've not updated my source since 
then but I assume that it all still works. If you want I can repost it.

Hi David,

sorry I wanted to write you earlier - I wanted to commit your patch
but I had compilation problems with it due incompatibilities between
MinGW and MSVC compilers. Have you been successful with MinGW
compilation?

I've not tried. Could you let me know what the compilation problems were? I'm 
guessing that I've missed out a #ifdef _MSC_VER somewhere. I should probably 
check it on Linux too. I'm currently in the middle of getting Linux up and 
running on my laptop so that should be a good workout for it...

I agree that the second version is more robust.
My image example is created by the QGIS georeferencer. Maybe I could change 
something there that it uses NaN as nodata value instead of 0. Currently, it 
uses the same nodata value as the input image for georeferencing.

This is the error I get:

In file included from c:\Martin\dev\qgis\src\core\qgsapplication.cpp:17:

Then when I tried to remove CORE_EXPORT from defiintion of enum
ENDIAN, qgsapplication.cpp compiled successfully. But then when
compiling gui library I get another error qgsprojectionselector.cpp

I haven't investigated further...

Btw. now I've managed to setup MSVC++ Express Edition, using these notes:
http://bfilter.sourceforge.net/doc/vc2005express.php
But this allowed me to use only "NMake Makefiles" cmake generator. To
use also "Visual Studio 8 2005" generator, I had to do these steps:

I've removed it from the enum definition in my version of qgsapplication.h 
without any ill effect.

Not sure what's causing this. If you use the unpatched version of 
qgsapplication.h (dllexport entire class), does that work? You may need to 
remove the CORE_EXPORTfrom the four private static members at the bottom of 
the file. Bizarrely, this works fine for me. Previously I got various 
compiler errors when exporting the whole class.

I would think also maintainers for packages (win, mac, various linux

I found that the georeferencer sets 0 as nodata value itself. So I changed the 
georeferencer behaviour and I will commit the second (more robust) version of 
the if-statement to svn.

Hi Paolo,

Yes, it is. Packaging is part of release management, and I think Tim already 
assembles a team of package maintainers.

Martin and Tim,

Thanks for your feedback and for the willingness to maintain the code. I will 
adapt the draft organigram accordingly.

Gary and Steven,

Is it ok for you to be code maintainer for the code parts mentioned in my 
previous e-mail?

Best regards,
Marco

Yes, I think I can do that.  I assume this would cover everything in
/app/composer, but not anything else at the moment?

Yes, correct. Of course you may volunteer to also maintain other parts if you 
like.

OK, I've finally got this building with MinGW and MSVC. The resulting patch is 
attached. Note that I haven't been able to get Python support built in yet 
and I've not tried building in GRASS support either

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS project brochure
Message-ID: <20070824093359.39dafe56@localhost.localdomain>

Hi, 

there is an updated version of the 2-sided qgis brochure available in svn. It
can be used as QGIS promotion material and provides an overview about the
capabilities of Quantum GIS 0.9 for fairs, conferences etc in english. The
brochure is done with scribus (you need a current version).

A tagged brochure version is available in svn (checkout as guest):
svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis_docs/tags/0.9.0_brochure

We will also provide a pdf on the qgis.org documentation website within the next
days, I guess.

A translation branch is planned as well.

You find more information about the QGIS brochure and how to contribute here:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/QGIS_Brochure

At the moment we are trying to improve our project management process and 
spread the load more evenly between people who each have a specific area of
resposibility. Therefore we would like to encourage you to help! Any
contribution you have to make will be greately appreciated.

BTW: We also added a 1 page description of the QGIS project to the OSGeo VisCom
brochure. We hope it will be available for upcoming conferences (foss4g,...)
http://www.osgeo.org/visibility

regards, 
 Otto

Hi all

Just a final appeal to get your last minut bug fixes and translations
in before we release. The release was scheduled for Sun 26th but Ill
be away till mon, so it will now happen on the evening (Brazil time)
of Monday the 27th.

Immediately following 0.9 I plan to have a follow up with 0.9.1 which
(assuming all are in agreement) will merge in the raster transparency
branch and any other pending (subject to approval). I will aim to have
0.9.1 ready within around a month from the release of 0.9.

Many thanks for all those contributing to the QGIS development effort.

Kind regards

I was curious if anyone had a chance to look into the library installation 
problem on 64 bit architectures.  Should I create a bug for this issue?

Hi Tim.
Good to hear that. A couple of questions:
- what about the current 114 bugs currently opened (1 critical, 51
major), and especially the 7 mustfix?
- will the advanced_editing_branch also be merged?
All the best.

Hi all,

I was away for the weekend camping, the builds as of 22/08 are here:
http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis0.9.0preview1.22.08.2007.zip
http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis_setup0.9.0preview1.22.08.200
7.exe

I will do fresher ones if needed. The installer has Python/PyQt
detection and does not install python bindings if these are not found. I
am leaving the Python install to the user's discretion till I perfect an
autoinstall.

Hi

The 0.9 release will be delayed at least 24 hours while I try to get
debian build stuff sorted. Niccolo - do you already have a working
debian/ dir with build stuff that you can share? It will save me a lot
of time....

Thanks

Last time I compiled QGIS (svn 200708071155) I used the 
Frankie's Debian files (http://people.debian.org/~frankie/qgis/) 
with some changes. A summary of my changes:

- removed dpatches that do not apply
- add some build depends
- declared cmake GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR
- changed some *.install files so that
  the actual files were installed.

I attach the archive of my debian dir.

Hi Niccolo

Ok so you havent done any cmake based debian packaging (qgis 0.9
previews etc) yet? I think my cmake deb build is almost working but
was hoping someone out there had already solved the problems...

Since no one is fixing these in time for the release, the fixes will
have to wait for a future QGIS release.

No - post 0.9 we will consider which branches can be merged for 0.9.1

The Debian files I attached build the package using cmake.

The version number 0.8 is misleading, they work on 0.9. 
The main work was by Frankie, however.

Hi Tim,

I would suspect that the problem lies in linking PyQGIS to QtSql.
Could you try to remove QtSql from python/configure.py.in - line 13?
I'll try that on my own later in the evening.

Hi

You can find a little info here:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/TranslatorsCorner

And you can contact Otto Dassau if you would like more inforation
about becoming a translator. Others on the list may be able to give
useful information on how long the process will take, but if you are
starting from scratch Im guessing its probably at least a week of work
if not more. Once that is done the process demands a lot less time
since updates can be done incrementally.

Best regards

Tim

I've tried this on both linux and mingw and both compiled well... and
the mysql dependency on linux has gone (windows build was okay also
before).
Not sure if that's alright also with mac...

Thanks, Tim.

Otto please add me   a coordinator to work on the translating Qgis for
Lao language.
It looks like we will start from the scratch. What about other plugins
like GRASS? Does anyone have any information on how long will it take
to translate that part?


Thanks
Anousak

Hi Anousak, 

I would also suggest it is about one week. A Translation into Polish last
year needed 2 days:

http://www.nabble.com/Translations-of-QGIS-tf4268187.html

... but there is a lot more to translate now. If you need help to get started,
just contact us. 

Also a good idea is to subscribe to the qgis-doc mailing list: 
http://lists.qgis.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/qgis-doc

regards,
 Otto

I just tried to build debian packages on sid amd64 without any obvious
problems.  The plugins are found fine.

Where are the plugins installed?  Into /usr/lib, or /usr/lib64?  Does Debian 
install 64-bit libraries into /usr/lib64?

Were you using qgis 0.8.1 or the SVN for 0.9?

The core+gui shared libraries are installed to /usr/lib and the plugins
to /usr/lib/qgis

Ah, that's probably why things are working fine.  Some distributions like to 
install 64-bit libraries to lib64 so that 32-bit and 64-bit libraries can 
co-exists side-by-side.  Fedora is one of them.

This was fixed back when qgis used autoconf in ticket #27 
(https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/27).

If you look at the bug I'm working on for Fedora (bug #27549 - 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=247549) you'll see that 
although the patch I attached earlier moves where the libraries are installed 
at, it doesn't seem that qgis finds them when starting up.

Hi

If it doesnt find them on start up its probably a case for adding an
USE_LIB_64 option or similar to cmake and then ifdeffing the bits of
qgis code that are searching in lib to use lib64 if that option is
enabled. (its just a few places so should be a minor job).

Regards

Tim

Recently I've been taking a look a the vector layer source code and trying to 
find with the help of valgrind and kcachegrind where most of the time was 
spent. With the files I took I started playing a bit and it seemed that most 
time was spent in the drawPolygon function. Not a big surprise given the 
sample data, but a good place to start.
	I looked at it and tried to redo some things to find if I could do something 
to improve performance. The result, no performance gain, at least no user 
perceivable difference, but the code seemed much clearer because path is 
filled in the first loop. However, to achieve that I removed the code 
responsible for clipping values that don't fit into 16-bit signed values as 
it seems that was a Qt 3 limitation and Qt4 possibly has an internal 
solution/workaround for that. (At least I see no warnings in Qt4 docs). If 
that code is correct, then something similar could be done for drawLineString 
and drawFeature.
	Please, see attached a diff for current trunk. Of course that's working fine 
in my tests.

	By the way, as I said what I wanted to find is a way to improve performance. 
For example with the map of spain I've been playing it takes 4 seconds to 
repaint the hole map with 3 layers (1 with polygons and a couple with lines). 
Looking at the code a possible solution that comes to mind would be to try to 
keep the generated polygon (or line or whatever) path from one call to 
another, maybe adding polygons in the path on demand when the user moves. I 
imagine that would mean redesigning the the way zooming and scrolling is 
handled. But probably I'm also ignoring many other aspects, as I've only 
worked with a very little part of the source code.
	Any way, I was interested in knowing how it all worked and try to find out if 
there've been some discussions regarding theses performance issues.
	Comments?

Hi Albert,

more than a year ago, I've made also some tests to see where we could
gain some more speed when working with vector layers:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Rendering_Performance

These tests were done back in times of Qt4.1.x, so drawing times might
be different now. Also Trolltech was announcing that in Qt4.3 they've
increased performance of drawing to OpenGL, but I haven't tried it
yet.

The tests were done by simply measuring overall time with QTimer calls
inserted into the code. From the tests I would say that the biggest
bottlenecks is data retreival from data providers. We don't have any
caching mechanism so the data are usually always re-read from the data
store (well, there are disk caches but they're at much lower level).

That clipping code has been added to overcome a nasty bug with Qt3 on
X11 platform where we were getting freezes of the whole system. But
also for Qt4 we had to leave it there - in Qt4.1.x QGIS was crashing
sometimes at greater zooms during the rendering. Maybe it's not a
problem anymore with Qt4.2 or 4.3 as Trolltech devs tried to make the
drawing routines more roboust, but I don't know if this was fixed too.
Anyway, the clipping amgorithm is pretty fast and IIRC removing it was
just about 1-2% performance gain - not a big deal...

I've seen the patch, but as I've said I'm not much a fan of removing
the clipper as it doesn't make a big difference and there's
potentially still the problem with a crash. There are surely other
places that need some optimizations more. The elimination of those
intermediate arrays for rings is good though...

I've been thinking about this - mostly about where to put the caching
mechanism. There are generally two options:
- cache objects ready for painting (as you suggest) - e.g. save
ready-made QPolygonF instances
- cache objects fetched from data provider - e.g. save QgsFeature instances

I like the second option more due the fact you're mentioning - when
scaling or scrolling we would need to recalculate the coordinates
somehow. More clean way seems to me to cache the features with their
map (not screen) coordinates.

It's great to see that some people look into the QGIS code and try to
improve it! I'm looking forward to see here some more discussion about
the rendering performance.

Regards
Martin

P.S. nowadays I'm moving to my new place so I'll be probably less
responsive until I settle down.

I also like the idea of a feature cache. Btw, it seems that the Java folks 
already do this, and there will be a presentation at the FOSS4G conference:
 
http://www.foss4g2007.org/presentations/view.php?abstract_id=151

Hopefully they will upload the slides later for those who cannot join (like 
me).


Additionally to a cache on feature level, it would also be good to have 
smarter zooming and panning as this enhances the user perceived performance. 
Similar to OpenLayers, a background thread could already render image pieces 
adjacent to the current view so that panning is a very fast operation. For 
zooming, I like the way of udig, where the image is scaled first and the 
rendered tiles appear successively.

Marco

That talk looks very interesting...

I wanted to implement rendering in a background thread some time ago
to allow some features we really miss, like:
- interruption of rendering
- GUI interaction during rendering
- prerendering of areas near the border (as OpenLayers or GMaps do)
This needs a deep analysis of how it would work, where to put
synchronisation etc. and it will need also some architecture changes -
e.g. data providers do not provide thread-safe access, so concurrent
reads from providers would end up with incorrect results.

Yes, it would be much work and is quite difficult.

Wouldn't it be possible to have only one rendering thread so that thread safe 
providers are not needed (at least as a first step)? 
But yes, on multiprocessor machines, it would be really cool to have different 
threads rendering different tiles. Do you have an idea how providers could be 
made thread safe?

I suppose that, with the creation of the release branch, the feature freeze

Hi Marco

Yes my apologies for not emailing anything out in this regard - I was
planning to do that this weekend since Im bogged down at work.

Yes I think submitting patches is fine. As per our previious
discussions any new features should happen in branches and be cleared
with psc before being incorporated so we can keep trunk in a near
release ready state.

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 0.9.0 bugfix delay
Message-ID: <d368056f0708310810q5fe85144i3c9e4f077ec5c7b9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Some of you may have noticed that I tagged 0.9.0 two nights ago. I
have not yet made any announcements regarding 0.9.0 release. Because
of the number of bug reports coming in
and since there seem to be so many issues with the code base as it
stands, I would like to suggest retagging 0.9 as 0.9preview2 and delay
the release for another 2 weeks to allow for more bug fixing.

Could I ask everyone who has pending stability patches to please apply
them and motivate those who may have been itching to do some bug
fixing to give it a go! We really need everyones help if we are to
produce a stable product!

We would also like to remind you that we have a small amount of funds
donated by our user community available to support bug fixing, so if
you are a student or otherwise looking to make a bit of spare cash,
this is a great opportunity to support the QGIS project and at the
same time get a little less poor! If you are interested please email
our project steering committee chairman:

Gary Sherman <gsherman [at] mrcc.com>

Please use the subject line: BUG FIXING

Yours sincerely,

Thanks for your response Martin.

With Qt3 I've seen it documented but not with Qt4. I'd be nice to know if 
they've solved that, maybe not a problem for performance but quite ugly 
anyways...

I've been thinking about this and I've found that maybe the most intuitive 
thing I had done is to consider every polygon or groups of them (that is the 
result of drawPolygon for example) a new item in the QGraphicsView scene. 
Indeed, Qt4 has the QGraphicsPathItem class which holds a path and its brush 
(i think nothing else is needed). So qgis should only worry to create those 
items on demand and leave them created once they have been shown once. (Some 
enhancements could be done by removing some with some cache heuristics, but 
you get the idea). This way, no real cache is created, indeed QGraphicsScene 
holds the item for you and draws them when needed, and can make it's internal 
optimizations which is stuff that QGis won't have to worry about.

In this case I don't quite see why zooming and moving should be a problem, as 
QGraphicsView has been designed exactly for this kind of things. Even for 
dragging and clicking the items if needed. You just create the paths 
(polygons, lines, ...) in QGraphicsPathItem's and Qt will handle translations 
and zooming etc. With the small view of all the architecture I have, it seems 
that QGis should only translate layer coordinates to scene coordinates. 
Rotation, zooming and translation should be handled in scene/view coordinates 
by Qt scene/view arquitecture.

Of course, I'm only talking about vector layers, not bitmaps.

Is all that reasoning feasable or am I missing something?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Birds of a Feather session at FOSS4G2007 Conference
Message-ID: <F1CC21C2-4961-4E93-A538-12742E4B77B4@mrcc.com>

Hi all,
I have scheduled a "Birds of a Feather" (BOF) session during the  
conference. It will be held on Tuesday from 1645 to 1900.

More information can be found here: http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/ 
FOSS4G2007_BOF_Sessions

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU: If you are attending the conference and will  
attend the BOF session, please just drop me a brief email (sherman at  
mrcc.com).
If there is not enough interest, I'll release the room so it is  
available for another group.

Thanks,
-gary
