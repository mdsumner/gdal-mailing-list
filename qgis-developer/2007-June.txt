Yes, it takes care of everything. With CMakeSetup you set all
dependencies and other configuration stuff. Then you just have to hit
'build' button in VC++. Ideally everything builds, but as noone takes
care of compatibility with VC++ probably some tweaks in sources will
be needed.

Hi all.
When digitizing grass vectors from qgis, closing the v.digit window
crashes qgis, without error msg in the console.
Does anybody have the same problem?
All the best.

Martin,

Sounds great!
Then I believe it's better to stick to CMake instead of manual
hacking of Visual C++ projects.

Do you still have the problem?
Can you check whether also qgis.gui module loads well?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] windows packages: who is wanting them?
Message-ID: <46606CEE.7020509@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Windows is unfortunately still widespread, and many qgis users prefer
that OS. Maintaining Windows packages is proving difficult, time
consuming and boring, especially because a number of ancillary packages
have to be included in a single installer. This is subtracting dev time,
thus slowing development pace.
The right solution is obviously to have each package maintained
independently, but in a coordinated way, through a msys-geo repository.
The packages are at least: grass, gdal, proj, geos, expat, postgres, xerces.
I believe we could launch a specific sponsorship program for this, as
many are interested in having such stuff (also in professional settings).
Of course we should provide a reasonable roadmap (N of human resources
needed, infrastructure, etc.), not just asking for money and then seeing
what to do with that.
Sounds reasonable?

Message-ID: <46A5D38E-53BF-453B-AC9B-AA15F8584D2C@kyngchaos.com>

OK, so I had some time today and broke down and tried the cmake thing  
on OSX.  Here are a few notes about Tim's wiki instructions after a  
quick run thru (I tried 0.8.0 first, but moved on to 0.9 trunk).


- Python - for a universal build, add the -n flag to the SIP  
configure.  PyQt picks this up and automatically builds universal.

- I wasn't too keen on the cmake binaries installing in /usr (that  
should be left alone, for system stuff), so I built from source using  
the default /usr/local.  Pretty simple:

./bootstrap
make
sudo make install

- the Subversion requirement could be removed, to simplify for those  
who just want to build Qgis.  Use the web SVN interface to Qgis  
source and download tarballs from there.

- it would be nice to list variables for configurable dependencies.   
I have some static libs in non-standard locations.  Or maybe the  
ccmake interactive configure can take care of this?

- The autodetect for GRASS needs work.  The way I set up the OSX app  
build in the GRASS source (so it's official now) the major.minor  
version is now in the name (so people can more easily have stable and  
CVS versions side-by-side).  ie GRASS-6.2.app.

So, it should try a versioned GRASS.app first, but how to pick which  
one I don't know (it can't really tell which is stable and which is  
not).  Maybe one of those cmake variables that the user can set?

Otherwise a manual GRASS_PREFIX setting is needed.

- I see some universal flags in the resulting cmakecache.txt, though  
just my architecture is set.  I tried editing cmakecache.txt to set  
both architectures, but it's not adding those flags to compile and  
link.  How do I turn on a universal build?  Or do I need to manually  
add the flags for now?

- and then I get stuck at:

cc1plus: warnings being treated as errors
...
/Users/Shared/src/qgis/qgis-svn-070604/src/core/qgsgeometry.cpp:2511:  
warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions


PS. thanks for the tip about the FIXMEs in the GEOS 3 headers.  I'll  
comment those out for an update to the framework release.

For multiple values in a cmake setting, use semicolon, not space:

CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=i386;ppc

Ok - in the instructions I suggested to build in your home dir like this:

cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/apps/ ..

Where does ./bootstrap come from?

Right I think Magnus Homann has done similar on the CMake backport he
did to 0.8. branch. Ill take a look.

I think you can set pretty much everything in ccmake or by editing
CMakeCache.txt (==hack I think). Did you have probelsm with gdal.so
etc? Will be nice if we can get the mac version to use .dylib rather.
In openModeller I edited cmake/FindGDAL etc scripts to achieve this
but I dont know if thats the best way...

Hmm Im not sure how it can tell either. Martin? I guess we could scan
for /Applications/QGIS* and then do a little scripting to get the
highest version no....(in cmake/FindGRASS )

specify CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES as i386;ppc

I havent been able to successfully make a universal binary yet - I
guess some of my deps need to be compiled as unoversal too. Did you
see in my wiki notes where I should have done this for gsl etc? Or
does it happen automagically?

Ok this is fixed in SVN. By default the pedantic flag is on and all
warnings are treated as errors. You can turn the pedantic flag off in
ccmake (though I recommend you keep it on and let us know if you get a
similar warning).

Great thanks!


Many thanks for your fantastic work once again getting those
frameworks done! They really do make getting up & running on the mac a
doddle....

I noticed that some of the dependency checking is broken - fixes in  
0.9 haven't been backported.  It sets .so extensions for some:

-- Found GDAL: /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/unix/lib/libgdal.so
-- Found PostgreSQL: /usr/local/pgsql/lib/libpq.so

You mean like the above 0.8 problem I mentioned?  Seems to be OK in  
0.9 trunk.

Since I was talking about universal-ness, I should have looked at the  
extra deps you mention ^_^

GSL is a bit tricky.  First, for all universal building where it  
isn't a builtin option, this nifty trick helps a LOT:

http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20061025213851279

Install it as /usr/local/bin/ccub and c++ub

Then, configure GSL with (prefix defaults to /usr/local, BTW):

./configure --mandir=/usr/local/share/man CC=/usr/loca/bin/ccub

BEFORE running make, take care of a couple PPC/Intel configured  
options.  Edit config.h and replace the HAVE_DARWIN_IEEE_INTERFACE  
and HAVE_EXTENDED_PRECISION_REGISTERS settings with:

#ifdef __BIG_ENDIAN__
	#define HAVE_DARWIN_IEEE_INTERFACE 1
	#undef HAVE_EXTENDED_PRECISION_REGISTERS
#else
	#undef HAVE_DARWIN_IEEE_INTERFACE
	#define HAVE_EXTENDED_PRECISION_REGISTERS 1
#endif

then make

For expat, the simple way would be to require X11 installed and use  
that one - the universal SDK has it for building universal.

Otherwise, it's similar to GSL, using ccub.

./configure CC=/usr/loca/bin/ccub

BEFORE make, edit expat_config.h and lib/macconfig.h for these options:

#ifdef __BIG_ENDIAN__
   #define BYTEORDER 4321
   #define WORDS_BIGENDIAN 1
#else
   #define BYTEORDER 1234
   #undef WORDS_BIGENDIAN
#endif

Bison doesn't need to be universal.

The order of version is simple enough to look for.  But the .cvs is  
not a part of how I set up the app build (and it would have been  
GRASS-6.3.cvs.app - always .app).  If the cmake macro for GRASS can  
poke around more, I do have "cvs" in the Info.plist of the app, in  
CFBundleVersion.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using Request for changes (RFC) in QGIS project
Message-ID: <200706051726.04509.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Dear QGIS community members,

In the last PSC meeting we agreed that QGIS needs a more formalized 
development model. One idea was to use Requests for changes (RFC), similar to 
the what UMN mapserver does (http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/development/rfc).

If you are also in favour of RFCs, we need to agree on how the procedure 
should be for the QGIS project. To start the discussion, I wrote down some 
initial ideas (see below). Please comment them and bring your own ideas. 
After the discussion, I'm going to make a document that describes the RFC 
procedure for QGIS on the Wiki.


-A QGIS Request for comment (RFC) describes a major change in technology, 
major additions to functionality, or changes in the direction of the project. 
It is published on the developer and user mailing lists and community members 
vote about it.

-It is necessary in the following cases:
Change that breaks API compatibility, merge of a branch, change in development 
model

-Procedure: 
Author publishes RFC on qgis-developer and qgis-user lists
Community votes in the next 5 working days with -1, 0, +1
Finished RFCs are stored and are available on the website, together with the 
voting result


Regards,
Marco

Some more universal notes.

- Strickly speaking, the universal SDK is only needed when building  
ON PPC.  The system on Intel is already universal, so the SDK isn't  
needed for linking.

But, when I removed the SDK path from CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT, cmake still  
inserts the -isysroot flag, just without a value.  This breaks GCC.   
So, it's a bit of a bug in cmake, and the SDK path is always needed.

- So, a problem with the SDK (and it is still needed when using the  
ccub trick, unless you hack the ccub source and remove it) is that  
only the system paths are in the SDK (it's kind of like chrooting  
everything).  Anything installed in /usr/local or other non-standard  
locations, and even /Library/Frameworks, will not be found.

The way around this, if the SDK must be used, is to symlink those  
into the SDK (one of the rare times I mess with Apple-installed stuff).

For /usr/local:

sudo ln -s /usr/local /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/local

For /Library/Frameworks:

sudo mkdir -p /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/Library
sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/ 
Library/Frameworks

And others similarly.

Once school of thought says all warnings should be treated as a bug,
and that we should not allow code into SVN that has warnings. So
instead of doing svn checkout and turning pedantic on, you should do
checkout and turn pedantic *off* if you are disinclined to use them.
If you are doing dev work and you have unused vars etc then just turn
off pedantic while developing, then turn them on again for a final
build before committing,

If warnings arise on different compilers etc we should treat these as
bugs too.  I thought at one stage pedantic was turned off in SVN -
maybe one of us (me turned it on and committed again without
realising. Ideally the warnings in WFS plugin can be resolved and we
can remove that warning. In summary, I prefer to keep pedantic on...

...what do others think?

Regards

Tim

Hi


It would be good to make an rfc template on the wiki and store all the
rfcs on the wiki - then keep all the commentry on the wiki. IMHO email
is not a good medium if you want to go back and look at the discussion
surrounding an RFC. By all means of course we should advertise the
rfcs on the mailing lists etc.

Hi

Yes thats pretty much the gist of what I was trying to say in the
meeting. I think more than sponsorship, we need someone to drive the
process - aproach the msys project and the different projects and
coordinate teh process.

My concern was that it's hard to ensure that some piece of code won't
emit warnings on other compilers. It's less convenient for users when
the warnings block their compilation... Of course I'm not insisting to
turn in off, only thinking about possible problems :-)

Hi

Yes that may help for an initial body of work but this needs ongoing  
maintainership, not just a once off effort. We have already done the  
work of a once off effort - what we need more is a long term plan to  
have the current FOSS GIS related packages always available in some  
kind of msys-geo repository.

Hope I'm making sense. :-P

Tim

I'm also in favour of turning pedantic off by default. Because people which 
are familiar with C++ compiler but not familiar with QGIS code don't know 
that pedantic flag exists. So they will have frequent problems if they don't 
use the same compiler versions as QGIS developers.
But I agree that it would be good for developers to turn it on (I promise to 
do so in future :-) ).

Looks like I stirred up a bit of a debate.  But I agree here - either  
turn it off by default, or leave it on but prominently mention it in  
the INSTALL readme (which is WAY out of date BTW).  From a developer  
view, the second choice makes more sense, and this IS development  
source.

At the moment its on for both. Another idea is to turn it off for
source releases, but keep it on during development process.

Ill take a look at the INSTALL notes...Im tempted to just point people
to the wiki, but i guess that doesnt help offline users....

You mean that people directly insert their votes into the wiki page? I made a 
RFC wiki page (http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/RequestForComment) and a 
template that can be copied. Individual votings would then be separated with 
=== vote === at the bottom of the RFC. Links to the RFC instances would be 
inserted below 'Existing RFCs' on the RFC wiki page.
@all can you agree with this? Please have a look at the wiki page and write 
your opinion. Are five working days enough as a voting period or should it be 
longer?

cheers,
Marco

I like the template, five working days seem OK to me. Author of the
RFC should also add a FAQ section and fill it with questions and
answers based on the discussion on the mailing list. In case that RFC
is changed based on the discussions, the voting should get another
five days.

Also what about the cases when later the dev finds out that he needs
to do things differently? Change the RFC and start voting again? Or
create a new RFC ...?

BTW. That new template on wiki looks cool :-)

Good point. Maybe it should be possible to update an RFC and start voting 
again (also with five days voting period). To not loose discussion history, 
it should be done in a new document titled e.g. as update of RFC #15

Hi all.
While testing the RC, it seems that gdal was compiled without grass support.
Are there plans to prepare a final version?

I think he should defer to our technical lead (Marco) to see if the
adjustments merrit a new RFC.

Glad you like it. Im also trying to get the front page a little more

Hi

I've made a ?final? windows test build here:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/qgis_setup0.8.1.rc2.exe

Please test today if you can as I want to get the release done
tonight. I had some probelms using some of the grass raster tools in
the grass toolbox, but they work ok from the command line. Im not sure
if Im just doing something dumb or if there is some issue with the
grass tools.

Regards

Hi Lami

Thanks for checking - was it rc 3 you tested? As I said (or thought I
said) in the email for rc3 I think the grass raster issues that I had
were resolved. Many thanks for checking. The problems were in rc2 with
r.in.gdal (gui grass tool).

I second this. As of now, most printing functionality in QGIS 0.8.1
(current SVN) is cumbersome, so that producing a decent map takes much
time and knowledge about how to workaround the present bugs.

QGIS print composer has great potential, and I'm recommending it to
people who who want to print their GRASS data, also because there is no
alternative GUI map composer for GRASS data currently. However, I must
say that users I know complain about the QGIS map composer usability.

On [1] there are 348 votes for "Improved map printing/layout" - the
most wanted functionality, 16% overall. Is this realistic that the
known QGIS map composer bugs will be fixed in QGIS 0.9? How about 0.8.2?

Hi Tim,
I've tested latest rc2 and there is still bug which immediately terminates 
QGIS if there is some problem during writing project file. It is caused by 
missing try{}catch{} construction in QgisApp::fileSaveAs so if an exception 
is thrown, there is missing "catch" mechanism and it result to terminating 
QGIS.
There is also problem with displaying translated messages extracted from 
exceptions. It is neccessery to use QString:fromLocal8Bit method to convert 
all characters to viewable form.
I've prepared patch to fix these bugs 5 days ago (see ticket #725). Could it 
be used already in 0.8.1 or is there some reason why should be moved to later 
release?

Lubos

Hi Lubos

Thanks for the email ad the patches. I will be aplying a few selected
patches before making the final release - first I was just
concentrating on getting grass issues out the way.

Many thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Final test builds before QGIS 0.8.1
Message-ID: <d368056f0706102214sba57c75oe7dc8d9c22dd0896@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

Tonight (11/6/2007) we will finally tag the 0.8.1 release. We were
hoping to do it this weekend but various issues prevented that. Before
we do the final tag, could I ask all of you with your varied operating
systems and distributions to make a quick test build and verify that
it compiles. If it builds successfully please just reply to this email
with a one liner e.g.

Ubuntu dapper i386 -- compiled ok

or (hopefully none of these) e.g.:

Windows 3.11 for Workgroups - compile failed

svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/Release-0_8_0 qgis0.8.1

Please note that we will not be fixing any more bugs for this release
and all currently open bugs will be pushed forward to 0.8.2  / 0.9, so
really all I want to know is if what we have in SVN  builds for
everyone or now.

Separately to this, I would like to ask people who are able to help
with packaging  to please enlist yourselves here:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PackagingHelpers so that we can
coordinate packaging efforts. I saw some debian packages for the
preview versions of QGIS 0.8.1 floating around - were these made using
cmake or auto* for the build. Is there anything that needs to be added
to svn prior to tagging for packaging purposes?

Many thanks for your patience with the emergence of this release....

Regards

What about backporting the auto-finding fixes from 0.9 for OSX GDAL  
framework and postgres dylib?  I still get:

-- Found GDAL: /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/unix/lib/libgdal.so
-- Found PostgreSQL: /usr/local/pgsql/lib/libpq.so

Otherwise, after manually setting those correctly, builds and starts  
up on OSX 10.4.9.

Great job!

Many thanks once again for your packaging work!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 0.8.1 Tagged
Message-ID: <d368056f0706112058h544b2875l59b97a88a6c29e73@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

Release 0.8.1 has been tagged in SVN. If you are a packager please go
ahead and make packages using this.

svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/tags/Release-0_8_1 qgis0.8.1

If you are able to build a package please add yourself to
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PackagingHelpers indicating which
package you are building. If you are building a package that includes
qt (mac / win / linux application bundle), it would be great if you
could build against Qt4.3.

I will make the public announcement  on this coming Thursday (15 June
2007) so if packagers could get their work to me before then it will
be great to be able to announce with binaries already available for
download. You can send me the url to the package on your own server
(please supply md5 checksums too if possible), or you can send me the
file using the free server 'you send it' at:

http://www.yousendit.com/

I have made windows and source packages and these will be uploaded and
generally available tomorrow from the official
http://download.qgis.org

Many thanks for all the people who dedicated a *lot* of time and
effort into making this release possible - your work is greatly
appreciated!

Regards

FreeBSD 5.5 - compiled OK with the  cmake line.

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/qgis \
-DGRASS_PREFIX=/usr/local/grass-6.3.cvs \

Glad I'm not the only one.
How about using the resources we have for this? Could we have a sort of
"qgis summer of code" aiming at a better map composer?
Alternatively, why not using it for bug bounties?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Custom raster drawing
Message-ID: <466E88F0.5080505@lancaster.ac.uk>

I want to display some rasters with a very specific colour scheme:

  values from 0 to 0.9: gray (or maybe green. Something neutral)
  from 0.90 to 0.95 : gray to yellow
  from 0.95 to 0.99 : yellow to orange
  from 0.99 to 1.00 : orange to red

  its a sort of 'alert' system, the values are probabilities.

The current raster colouring system won't do it, so I've looked at how I 
can extend it to do so. I've tried a couple of things:

  I wrote a new Python class that extends QgsRasterLayer, and wrote an 
overridden 'draw' method.

  QgsRasterLayer has two draw methods - one with five arguments 
(although in the docs this is called the '4 argument' method) and one 
with three. The five-arg method does some calculation and then calls the 
three-arg method. The drawThumbnail method also calls the three-arg 
method directly. The three-arg method is then a big switch statement on 
the drawing style.

  What I wanted to do was to override the 3-arg method with my new 
drawing code - it just has to paint on a QImage and return. But my 
Python class method got called with 5-args. When I just called the 
parent 5-arg method from my Python method it never called it again with 
3-args. You can only have one method per name in a Python class, so 
maybe there's some trick with SIP to get this to work. I couldn't. The 
simple solution here would be to rename the 3-arg draw method in the C++ 
code, then I could override that and have it called. Let's call this 
solution #1.

  Solution #2 is to have a new drawing style, lets call it 
CUSTOM_DRAWING_STYLE - then the big switch would have another case which 
would then call drawCustomStyle - which would have a null definition for 
a QgsRasterLayer by default, but which could be overridden by other 
classes. I'd override one of the current drawing routines, probably 
drawSingleBandPseudoColor, but they are private and so can't be accessed 
from Python wrappers.

  Solution #3 is to rewrite the raster drawing code to use renderers. I 
think this is outside my timeframe though - I'd like to get this done in 
a matter of weeks.

  On top of all this there are still problems since to draw a raster on 
screen I think you need access to adfGeoTransform, which is declared 
private and there's no accessor method.

  I know I've probably gone on about raster drawing before, but this is 
the last thing on my Todo list for my project. I'm willing to spend time 
on Qgis for this. Solutions #1 and #2 are pretty quick hacks that 
shouldn't take long, #3 would require working with the rest of the team 
to get it right. The problem with the private adfGeoTransform (and 
possible other private members needed from Python) could be solved with 
writing some accessor methods and associated SIP code.

Thanks,

Barry

O wow! Nothing. I didnt even realise we were printing that string
there. Simon was about 5 zillion releases ago :-P Ill have to fix it
for the next release and add it to the release checklist.

Hi Barry

The long term solution to this is that QgsRaster needs some mjor
refactoring. There is ongoing work on this in the transparency branch
but it does not yet adress your needs. My suggestion is that you join
our effor for getting qgsraster refactored. We have a roadmap for this
here

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/RasterTransparencyBranch

which I see you have already had a look at. Other things I would like
to do is move out all data format specific into its own subclasses and
make qgsrasterlayer an abstract base class. Also I would like to
suport custom color ramps and palletes  whose logic is separate to the
core raster drawing code. This means the pseudo color, rgb etc etc
code would come out of raster layer. Instead as each pixel is rendered
the layer value will be looked up from the data source and passed to
our colour mapping class which would return a qcolor which we then
draw onto the canvas. This would provide an extremelyfelxible aproach
and for writing custom colour maps all you need to do is implement a
subclass of QgsColorMap (in python or c++).

Another thing I would like to do fairly urgently is get an ossim data
provider implemented.

There are many other things I would like to do with raster, so I would
like to suggest that we hold an online irc or skype meeting for all
those interested in raster.  The goals of the meeting would be to firm
up a road map for raster with the aim of getting it merged into the
release after 0.9, and to divvy up the work to make this happen.

If you are interested to participate that would be great! I'd also
hope to see Marco and Pete Ersts there and perhaps one of the ossim
folks?

Tentaively Id suggest this friday as a date for the meeting.


Regards

Tim

Hi Barry and Tim,

I agree with Tim that the raster code in QGIS needs a complete redesign. The 
IRC meeting on Friday would be fine for me.

But can't you just use the raster transparency branch to do this? The solution 
there is not nice from a design point of view, as it adds just a new drawing 
mode. But it should do for the short time.
Load a raster, open the properties dialog, set 'Color Map' combo box 
to 'Custom Colormap' and go to tab 'Colormap'. Then set number of entries to 
5, set 'Color interpolation' to 'Linearly' and press 'Classify'. Then double 
click on the values to enter 0, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 1. Then double click on the 
color boxes to set 0 to gray, 0.9 to gray, 0.95 to yellow, etc. and 
press 'Apply'.

cheers,
Marco

  Ah ha! This looks like what I need. I haven't checked that there's 
Python bindings so I can set this up from my plugin yet though...

Right, python bindings for that functionality are missing. If you want to add 
them, the functions QgsRasterLayer::setCustomClassificationEnabled, and 
QgsRasterLayer::setValueClassification need to be exposed and also the struct 
ValueClassificationItem.

Howdy all,
I too am all for splitting the QgsRasterLayer into modular components as 
it is rather cumbersome in its current state. I think it is clear that 
we are all in agreement that this needs to happen, but there should be a 
clear rational decision as to when/how it will happen. I would rather 
see a major change done with some thought rather than quickly and 
haphazardly to meet one persons needs and deadline **no offense Barry, I 
got involved because I too needed additional functionality in the raster 
class, but your ideas are great and I think a lot of people would be 
interested in them!

Currently we have been working under the idea of first getting what is 
there working then making it is much more of the way it should be. I am 
all for splitting the class now if that is the way everyone is leaning, 
as it may actually make progress move much faster because there will be 
far less duplication of code.

The stretching and transparency would be easily and effectively 
implemented as separate classes. Another thing that also needs to be 
done is to have the raster stats stored to a file so they are not 
calculated every time the layer is reloaded (I will add this to the wiki)

One thing that have come up recently related to the transparency is that 
there is a need for  a way to reference an external raster layer loaded 
on the map canvas from with in QgsRasterLayer and also a way to know 
if/when that layer is deleted/removed. -- This allows for the an band in 
another layer to be used as the input for the transparency. A problem 
arrises when layer Y is selected as the transparency input for layer Z, 
then the user delete/unloads layer Y. In a working version (not 
committed to svn yet - I will probably commit it later this evening) I 
added a signal that is emitted when a raster layer is deleted. Thus when 
Y is deleted, layer Z knows to clear/forget about the current 
transparency layer settings. However, this is not a perfect solution 
because Qt does not guarantee the order in which signals will be 
processed. There have been a couple of suggestions about guarded 
pointers, which may be something to investigate further when the major 
refactoring is considered - but this issue has broader implications that 
reach outside of the raster transparency branch.

Unfortunately, I will not likely be able to participate in a conference 
call/chat this Friday, but pretty much I will be good with most anything 
that is decided!

  No offense taken - the joy of open source being that I can do a quick

  And then change it to the neat elegant solution that we will work out

Thinking about this once again, this is probably doable. The reason of
this behaviour is that the 5-args method is virtual, while the 3-args
one isn't. My guess is that if you set also the 3-args method virtual
(in both header file and SIP file), you should be able to override it.

But... well, I don't like this hack either.

Yeah, this one would be nice. When refactaring, there will be probably
need of two main stages:
1. break raster layer into renderers
2. design a good raster data provider interface and move gdal specific
stuff there

Um, quite a lot of work :-)

Is there any reason for not using signals emitted from QgsMapLayerRegistry?

You only have to load all plugins the first time your run qgis. It  
will remember after that and load them automatically the next time  
you start qgis.

Gary can you add / link them to the site? I guess Otto probably
prefers we put them on qgis.org since if I recall correctly he doesnt
have very fast internet connection. Otto which do you prefer?

Hi Jachym

Ok I thinnk this is fixed in 0.8 branch - but unfortunately outside of
the release tag. We are considering whether to move teh tag (my
preference) or to retag with a minor version change (Gary's choice I
think).

Are the packages here http://les-ejk.cz/ubuntu/ ready for general use?
Can Gary add that link to the download page?

Many thanks

Tim

Hi all

I will be making the press announcements for 0.8.1 tomorrow (thurs)
evening. If you are able to create packages please send us a link to
them so they can be included on the download page. Tom and William are
you able to whip up some mack packages again?

Many thanks

Tom, if you build with my frameworks, since it's in the wiki builds  
instructions now, I can probably let you handle it.  Bundling the  
frameworks could work, if you want, though it would be extra work,  
and would make updates more frequent when I have framework updates.

Definitely bundle extra libs, like pq, and others not in the frameworks.

The python extras might be trouble - I don't know how Qgis will like  
having python modules moved outside the Python site-packages folder  
(maybe you've thought of that already).  Which Python do you plan to  
build with?  Apple's 2.3?  or the 3rd-party 2.4 or 2.5 universal?

I guess linking would be enough, except you would prefer to put them on
qgis.org. The packages are at the moment on a server with fast internet
connection and together with all depending packages (so no problem).

I'm doing this release using the old autotool build system, primarily 
because my scripts which copy libraries and update the embedded library 
paths are all based upon the old build system.

When the scripts get updated or rewritten for 0.9, they should support 
your frameworks so that, as you mention, one person can produce both a 
lightweight release which assumes frameworks are already installed as 
well as an all-in-one drag-n-drop bundle containing copies of the same 
frameworks.

Until that happens, I'm only able to replicate again the same 
distribution image I've produced in the past.

I haven't looked into Python at all. Your questions about module 
locations for 0.9 needs to be investigated. I'm using Apple's 2.3. I 
think this is good enough for 0.8 and no extra packages are needed.

Tom

OK.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to get to a framework build for at
least a few days - just today I took my MacBook to the shop for a screen
twitch (quite a spectacular one), and my spare PowerBook doesn't have the
space to install the dev tools.

Hm.  Well, all Python features available in my frameworks (GDAL) and other
builds (MapServer, Postgres) use Python 2.5.  I think Michael's Python GUI
work for GRASS requires at least 2.4, if not 2.5.  So many Qgis users will
have 2.4 or 2.5 installed, and/or won't mind the extra requirement.  I
like using what Apple provides, most of the time, but in this case they're
way behind, and there are ready-made binaries for many Python modules for
2.4 and 2.5.

Steven,

Great, just great news!

The problems in print composer I know about are:

1. line widths in the legend in the map composer happen to not
correspond to those on the printout
2. labels placement and size in the map canvas not always corresponds
to that in the map composer and printout
3. vector point symbols get rasterized in the printout
4. irregular letter spacing in the printout

Are you planning to fix them in the 0.8 too or 0.9 only?

Bad wording. Should read:

1. in the map composer, line widths in the legend and in the map happen
to not correspond to each other

Hi all

Since Pete Ersts and now myself cant make it to a meeting today, could
we do this next week? Barry I realise your needs are already mostly
met by the stuff Marco did in the raster branch but it would be great
to get your input still - and any other interested parties. Can
someone nominate a new date/time for the meeting?

Regards

  Now that I've SIP-wrapped the functions I need for my purpose I think 
my work here is done :)

  I'm going to submit a patch to Marco for him to commit. It was fairly 
straightforward:

  * replace std::vector with QList in a few places

  * fix up getInterpolatedColorFromValueClassification which was 
accessing an iterator that I think wasn't initialised properly.

  * write appropriate lines in the sip file.

  I think some of it needs a bit of tidying up but it is essentially 
complete.

  I'm okay most weekdays GMT 1000 to 17:00 for meetings (we're on GMT+1 
at the moment, so that's 11:00 to 18:00 London Time).

Barry

>>Would it be good to start fixing the existing bugs?
I plan to fix the current bugs first, as that alone would greatly improve
the print composer.  We'll see what I have time for after that, assuming I
even manage to fix most of the bugs.

>>Are you planning to fix them in the 0.8 too or 0.9 only?
I was assuming I would fix them for .9 only, but if others think it would be
better to fix them for .8.2, I can do that too.  Is there a release date
planned for .9?

It seems like most of the current bugs are related to scaling issues, which
are caused by the change from QT 3 to 4.  Is this correct?  Where do I need
to start, and how would I go about fixing the bugs?

I won't be starting on this right away, as I still need to finish my work on
custom fill styles.  Hopefully that will be done in a few days.

Hi,

I also had a chance to build QGIS 0.8.1 packages for fedora core 5. If you like,
you can add them to qgis.org as well.

It would be good to have both, but if your time is limited, I suggest

AFAIK yes. I think Radim introduced a 1.4 scaling factor for printing.
Radim is the one who knows.
Thanks a lot!

I for one think that fixing these issues in 0.8 stable branch will be
much appreciated by business/production users. When I deploy QGIS for a
client who pays money I don't want to take chances with unstable 0.9.

What do others think?

Thanks again Steve for willing to look into this. All good luck!

 I need to draw a straight line from a plenty of points ( 10 000 - 100

 If I use QgsMapCanvasItem:: paint, it too long.
 I used method Douglas-Peucker (

quickly.
 How to increase speed of drawing?

Hi Sploid

Im probably not the one who would be able to help you, but I can say
that you are unlikely to get much help without giving much
information. I would suggest you post annotated some code so that we
can see where the problem is occurring...

Message-ID: <255b57430706181912u708e043cled28dfabe3104f65@mail.gmail.com>

I think I'm finished implementing custom fill styles.  It works with the
single symbol, unique value and graduated symbol renderers, and appears to
correctly save and load the fill styles.
I have filed an enhancement in trac, and attached the patch:
#731<https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/731>.
Sorry if I should have filed it as a patch instead.   I'm just learning a
lot of this, so if I should have done something differently with the code or
patch, let me know and I'll be glad to fix it.

Tim,

This is nice, very clear. Thanks for putting this together, but I think 
there also needs to be a "stretching" class. In the current flow of the 
UML, it would be step 3.5

Ah good point I completely forgot about that! Ill add it! Heres an
updated diagram:

http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=570171302&size=o

By the way did we set a time for tomorrow? How about the same time we
hold the PSC meetings - 12h00 brazil, 11h00 for Pete, 4pm Barry, 5pm
Marco...(hope I got that all right?). Is anyone else interested in
attending?

Message-ID: <255b57430706191059s118ba8a3wb4ecfa593d659880@mail.gmail.com>

  Today, I've started looking at fixing some of the bugs in the print
composer.  I don't know much about it yet, but I'm guessing that bugs #279,
#548, #590 and #668 (and probably some others) are all similar scaling
problems.
  For now, I'm looking at the rendering of the legend fonts.  You can see a
screenshot of the mess here:
http://img466.imageshack.us/img466/4026/legendtextjy1.png

Could someone give me some clues on where to start fixing these bugs?

Also, Tim mentioned on IRC that there was a discussion about significantly
redesigning the print composer.  Are there plans underway to work on this?
If so, are there other areas of QGIS where I might be able to do more good
than I would fixing the current printing bugs?
Thanks,
Steven

Hi Tim,

12h00 brazil, 11h00 for Pete, 4pm Barry, 5pm switzerland is ok for me. Do we 
meet on irc or skype?

I like the UML diagram. For the naming of the classes, it seems to me that the 
QgsRenderer is more a filter than a renderer.

Hi Marco

Lets meet on IRC on qgis-raster as there are possibly some others who
might like to attend. For the naming of the classes yes I was also a
bit uncertain what to call that one. I think QgsRasterFilter sounds
good to. In case I wasnt clear in my UML my idea is that these filters
would be plugins that would let us do things like
http://www.geog.ubc.ca/courses/idrisi/s_tools3.html on the fly.

Regards

Tim

Hi all,

finally I took a look at the UML and also some materials about the
raster algebra / analysis. I've got some thoughts about that, some
might be worth considering:

- raster function interface - in my understanding, renderer (filter),
transparency filter, strecher are essentially functions doing
operations on raster data matrices. Does it make sense to create a
common interface for them and then create a chain of these functions
that will give input for a pixel shader? In this case any custom
raster functions could be added to arbitrary places in the chain.

- introduce one more abstraction: let's call it "raster data set" and
put it between raster layer and raster provider. How should that work:
Provider takes care of data acquiring from a specific backend. Data
set is the place where the main processing takes place. Raster layer
just accesses data set and draws it with its pixel shader. I see the
benefits in possibility to share data sets between layers, simpler
implementation of raster algebra, possibility to do some caching
already on data set level and more... (Well, a nice UML diagram would
describe the situation better)
btw. I'd like to use this approach also for vector data where all
vector editing / indexing / caching etc. would be done in vector data
set class - vector layer would only access data set for drawing and
maybe some more operations.

- raster algebra with two or more layers (data sets) - are we going to
support this?

- projections - are we going to support them?

- usage of properties for data providers - this is just a technical
thing - I think it would be good to use a mechanism of properties,
e.g.:
  void setProperty(QString name, QVariant value)
  QVariant property(QString name)
This means that provider-specific stuff could be set/get with an
unified interface, so we could avoid having e.g. setProxy() function
in QgsRasterLayer as we do have now just because WMS provider needs
it.

I don't know much about the rasters so excuse me in case I'm totally off :-)

Cheers,
Martin

Hi Martin (and others interested in raster)

General:

I made an RFC page for the work we are planning since I think it falls
into the category of 'major overhaul' and would be good to have a
formalised work specification. (Marco I took the liberty of tweaking
your rfc template a little - hope thats ok!). The rfc includes an
updated UML (created before I read Martins comments below) and the
ArgoUml sources for the UML.

Martin:

Good comments! Yes chaining of filters was something I had in mind.
Which also gets me to thinking the stretch operations could jjust be
implemented as a kind of filter. The transparency too, though we would
need to ensure that they were run in the proper place in any filter
chain. We also need to evaluate how much filter type stuff we need
since if we go ahead and eventually incorporate OSSIM functionality
into QGIS we get a lot of image processing bundled in. I guess the
same goes with grass raster processing facilities. Its something to
think about anyway. Martin could you tweak the UML to include your
ideas? I need to reread your ideas below a few times to properly
digest what you are suggesting. Will be great if you can attend the
meeting to discuss further...

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster Filters
Message-ID: <46796048.9000202@amnh.org>


Just after ending the raster refactoring chat, I had an idea, rather 
than trying to integrate the QgsRasterFilter idea into rendering 
processes itself, why not treat the QgsRasterFilter as if it were a data 
provider?

Just an idea.

  That's what I was hinting at during the IRC session:

(12:45:26) mcoletti: timlinux: So would the data pipeline for a chain
		     of filters look like this: first filter is
		     attached to raster data provider.  Then a second
		     filter gloms onto the first.  The second filter
		     does all data requests through the first filter,
		     which may or may not ultimately pass requests on
		     to the data provider.  The second filter doesn't
		     know it's not talking directly to the provider.


But I infer through my cold induced fuzzy thinking is that some of the
proposed filters would require a tighter coupling to the data
provider.  OTOH, maybe some of the information that those filters
would need from the data provider could just be propogated as needed
down the filter line?  (Although that might add unnecessary overhead.)


Cheers,

Mark

Subject: [Qgis-developer] a little python confusion and problem
Message-ID: <8CC82A03-DD93-4A3D-9B61-1020B47FB32F@kyngchaos.com>

I am a little confused about Python support in Qgis.  In building  
Qgis 0.8.1, SIP wasn't found for some reason, yet msexport still  
built.  So, it seems that there is a basic Python dependency (this  
one I remember from 0.8.0) for MapServer export, and a separate  
dependency on Python + SIP and PyQt for ? -- direct Python bindings  
to Qgis itself?

If that's the case, it should be made more clear in the install docs,  
so I don't rack my brains too much over why SIP wasn't found.

I can't figure out why SIP wasn't found.  The cmake --debug-output  
option doesn't tell me any more than without it.  I don't see a log  
file with anything useful.

Hi  William

Right so we probably got something confused in teh cmake stuff:

0.8.x needs python but not sip (for mxexport)
0.9.x will need python, sip and PyQt if you want python language bindings.

So your macbook is alive again? :-)

I thought it might be something like that.  Yes, cmake for 0.8 is  
looking for SIP and PyQt.  At least I don't have to worry about how  
to deal with bundling PyQt or SIP.

Not yet, the local repair center is sending it off to Apple today.  I  
did some creative cleanup on my PowerBook so I could install Xcode.   
Sheesh! - 867 PPC vs 2Gx2 Intel.  It took hours to build PyQt  
(universal), then I let the Qgis build run overnight.

Message-ID: <26761AF5-F0AB-43E3-B9B4-39C3F05F6BF8@kyngchaos.com>

I almost have an OSX binary ready.  One question about gpsbabel - the  
gpsimport plugin says it needs gpsbabel "where Qgis can find it".  I  
would like to bundle gpsbabel in Qgis, so is the Contents/MacOSX/bin  
folder added to the PATH within Qgis so that it could be found there?

Maybe it would need a similar treatment like the msexport.app and  
qgis_help.app in the bin folder?

Message-ID: <255b57430706211752h4ba79488o672c7646fc009019@mail.gmail.com>

After some more research, I'm guessing that at least some of the print
composer bugs are related to the switch from Qt3 to Qt4.  Fonts are rendered
correctly with version .7.4 on Ubuntu, and with .8 on Windows.  With .8 on
Ubuntu, I get things like this:
http://img466.imageshack.us/img466/4026/legendtextjy1.png

I propose to modify the print composer to work with the new Graphics View
framework, which will hopefully eliminate these issues.  Are there
significant issues with switching to Graphics View which would make it
difficult?  Are there other things related to the print composer and drawing
I should know about?
Thanks!
Steven

Hi Steven,
I've ported QgsMapCanvas from Q3t canvas classes to graphics view
framework and I don't remember any major problems with the port - I
can only recomment doing that - some things can be done simplier with
graphics view, moreover we don't want to stay with qt3 support library
forever...

	WEEK
Message-ID: <207CF949-EB99-47C2-95E0-BB4C1CA81593@mrcc.com>

June 29 is the close of the Call for Presentations for FOSS4G (Free  
and Open Source Software for Geospatial). If you plan on giving a 25  
minute presentation at FOSS4G, make sure you get your abstract in  
before the deadline!

http://www.foss4g2007.org/presentations/

FOSS4G 2007 presentations are 25 minute talks, with 5 minute question  
and answer sessions at the end. Presentations cover the use or  
development of open source geospatial software. Anyone can can submit  
a presentation proposal and take part in the conference as a presenter.

Some topics of interest for this year are:

     * Case Studies: Relate the experiences of you and your  
organization using open source geospatial. Where do things work well?  
Poorly? What problems did you solve, and at what cost? What do you  
recommend for others? Why?
     * Benchmarks: Comparisons between pieces of geospatial software.  
How do features compare? Speed? Ease of use? What do you recommend  
for others?
     * Visualization: Tell about your tips and tricks for effective  
visualization. How do you present information in a compelling way?  
3D? Cartographic tricks? Labelling and naming ideas? Graphs and  
hybrid map/data combinations?
     * Development: What are the new developments in your open source  
geospatial software product? How does it work, how do people use it,  
what are the technical issues you are running into?
     * Hacks and Mashing: Have you put together something novel or  
cool this year? What did you stick together, how did it work, show us  
your gizmo!
     * Collaboration: What techniques are you using to improve  
collaboration between organizations and between individuals. Public  
geodata, collaborative data collection, data sharing, open standards,  
de facto standards, and more!

If you have an open source geospatial story to tell, we want to hear it!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mac OS X build 0.8.1 avail + notes
Message-ID: <7994387B-1C31-4444-A3BE-F0FDEE96EEDD@kyngchaos.com>

My MacBook is back (almost a new mac: they replaced screen, logic  
board, inverter, a couple case parts).  Some other problems on the  
PowerBook distracted me, so I decided to rebuild today on my MacBook  
for practice (the PB build worked fine).

I have a binary on my site now that you can link to the download page  
(linking the site page, not the dmg, would be best, so people can see  
and easily get to the framework and GRASS download requirements).

Summary of the package: Qgis 0.8.1, requires my frameworks, also  
GRASS 6.3 app for GRASS support, and Python 2.5 for MS Export, all  
other needed libraries bundled in the app, includes gpsbabel  
universal binary.

Some notes:

- One small problem with the msexport linking - it links libqgis_core  
from the source dir, not from the relative @executable_path/.....

- for the build instructions, after a little experimentation with the  
interactive cmake mode, I figured out how to easily get the new  
GRASS.app builds with the version numbers in the name (ie  
"GRASS-6.3.app"):

cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Applications -D GRASS_INCLUDE_DIR=/ 
Applications/GRASS-6.3.app/Contents/Resources/include -D  
GRASS_PREFIX=/Applications/GRASS-6.3.app/Contents/Resources ..

- another fine tuning for the build instructions: I found that the  
default build type isn't quite a release build.  When I explicitly  
specified a release build, the binary sizes came out much smaller:

-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Hi William

Thanks for this!  I have added your hints to the install notes in
INSTALL.t2t and will commit shortly.

You are getting the same mileage out of your macbook as me (2 for the
price of 1 :-). When mine died they replaced the motherboard,
keyboard, hard drive and who knows what else. Been working great since
then though....

Regards

Tim

One more note, on the binary - there appears to be some problem with  
opening shapefiles.  Same as was discussed at the end of May, I'm  
just catching up.  But I've narrowed down a more specific case: when  
the GRASS app that Qgis was build with is missing (or renamed), when  
you try to add a shapefile Qgis crashes in QgsOgrProvider::loadFields().

It may apply to other builds (like Tom's all-in-one, when he finishes  
it).

So, it kinda makes GRASS required for now...

I was talking with Gary off-list about it (he relayed the problem to  
me).  Here is what I sent him most recently (get this into list  
discussion):

One more test: I could finally get Qgis to load a shapefile without  
GRASS present by completely removing the grass plugin/provider from  
the Qgis bundle, so it doesn't try to load it.

Somehow, the failure to load the GRASS plugin/provider because the  
GRASS libraries were not found is causing the OGR provider crash.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Build version 0.8.1 with Visual C++ 2005 Express
Message-ID: <op.tunkotopvq3qvo@pezzy.belkin>

For anyone who's interested, I now have QGIS 0.8.1 building with the
express edition of Visual C++ 2005. Code and cmake file changes are in the
included patch. If anyone has any suggestions for making this neater, or
anything at all really, let me know.
This includes all the standard plugins bar GRASS. I've not tried any of
them properly yet but the GPX and GPS plugins load their GUIs ok.

Notes:
Of the various dependencies, only the ones that required work beyond
simply installing are listed here.

Visual studio set up using the instructions in the QGIS wiki.

Qt 4.2.3 built using instructions in the QGIS wiki.

GDAL 1.4.1 from http://vterrain.org/Distrib/gdal.html
	Also need to add the following include dirs to gdal_rasterize project:
	..\..\gcore;..\..\port;..\..\alg;..\..\ogr

GEOS by svn from http://mateusz.loskot.net/projects/geos/
	Also need to copy capi\geos_c.h.in to geos_c.h

GSL from
http://david.geldreich.free.fr/downloads/gsl-1.9-windows-sources.zip

PostGIS from PostGIS website. Needed to add .lib extension to libpq.a and
libpostgres.a

QGIS: Need to find stdint.h and unistd.h. unistd.h comes with GnuWin32
version of flex & bison binaries. stdint.h from
http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/pstdint.h.

Once the solution is generated with cmake, the properties of the qgis
project need to be modified as follows (for the debug configuration only):
Open project properties and go to Configuration Properties --> Linker -->
System. Change Windows to Console.

I added the various dependency dlls (GEOS, GDAL etc) to the installation
bin directory by hardlinking with the dlls in their original directories
(fsutil hardlink create). It might be better to do this by adding them to
the path...

Debugging QGIS currently needs to be done by running from the install
directory and using Debug --> Attach to Process...

July is fairly open for me, and I hope to get most of the printing bugs
fixed by then.  After that, I'll be off to college, so I don't really know
how much time I'll have.

Now for a quick update...
I've gotten most of the print composer working with GraphicsView now.
Printing and image export are not working yet, but I'm hoping it won't be
too difficult with some of the new printing stuff in Qt 4.
As it turned out, porting to GraphicsView did not make the text
problems<http://img457.imageshack.us/img457/2640/fontmessiz6.png>go
away. :-(  However, I think GraphicsView does make some things
simpler,
and is worth doing.

If some other Linux users could run my font test program below, that would
be helpful.  Let me know your Linux distro, Qt version, and whether the text
came out garbled.
A Linux binary is here: http://botsnlinux.googlepages.com/QT_Fonts , and
source code is here: http://botsnlinux.googlepages.com/QT_Fonts.zip


After I get the port completed, I hope to move onto some other
improvements.  Should I just work on some the the bugs and enhancements
listed in trac<http://svn.qgis.org/trac/query?status=new&status=reopened&component=Printing&order=priority>or
is there another list somewhere?  Should there be an e-mail and/or
forumpost asking for ideas and most wanted improvements?

  I have this terrible compulsion to convert Qt C++ code into Python/Qt 
code, so my Python version of Steven's code is here:

http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Geog/Qgis/QT_Fonts_Python.zip

[files unzip into current directory so unzip this in a sub-folder of its 
own. there's only three files in it]

  unzip, run "python main.py" and if you have PyQt4 it should do the 
same as Steven's C++ example - ie on my Ubuntu box show text badly when 
scaling small point fonts up to large pixel sizes.

I'm using kubuntu 7.04, Qt-4.2.3. There is no problem for me with the font. 
The text looks as it should.

Great! Looking forward to the patches.
And even if it turns out you don't have much time after July, some casual 
bugfixes then may still be very valuable for the QGIS project.

In my opinion, fixing bugs is one of the most important things for qgis. So 
the bug tracker is the first point to look at. 

There is also the poll about most wanted features for 0.9:
  http://qgis.org/component/option,com_poll/task,results/id,15/.
