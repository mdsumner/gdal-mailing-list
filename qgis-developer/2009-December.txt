+ 1 for include QtWebKit a build requirement.

This feature is good for make help in plugin?s.

Just now i am using this feature in my plugin under construction, where, 
need make requests one site.

I think this problem can be avoided by emitting signals when there are

But it would be good to avoid usage of QTreeWidgetItem instances so

Hi all,

I've some remarks with the WFS service management loading a WFS layer
from? http://webgis.regione.sardegna.it/geoserver/wfs?version=1.1.0.
I loaded a WFS layer named "uso suolo 2008" in my map extent but I
didn't see any objects I think because Qgis don't manage WFS
functionality in a "dynamic way", I mean for example like Udig. I
Think this is very important feature with WFS layer with hundred
thousand objects.

best regards
Michele

Hi,

@Giovanni: how did you done?? I would see the Cagliari area but Qgis
load, in a static way, only 2000 polygons in the north.
There is some configuration that I'm missing.

As you said you didn't see "any object" I supposed that the 2000
features were the whole layer.

By the way I don't know if is a qgis problem, I just tested to serve
trough mapserver/wfs the corinne land cover layer of Portugal (47000
features) and it worked like a charm.

cheers

And you need CMake 2.6 or later - otherwise it won't find QtWebkit.

Hi All

Isn't it much redesign work to make a model class out of QgsVectorLayer?

Probably it would be enough to have a function in QgsVectorLayer that fetches 
features by attribute value. Then, at runtime, the layer that joins others, 
would call those functions and making the join transparent to users of 
QgsVectorLayer.

For performance reasons, there should additionally be the possibility to 
create indices on vector layers for certain attributes. Such an index would 
not store the feature itself, only the relation between attribute value and 
feature id(s), ideally with the possibility to store large indices on disk.

Just and idea...

Regards,
Marco

Hi,
Big performance issues are usually solved by setting the relationship inside
the DBMS architecture.
IMHO we could give the user two options:
1- Creating a method in the vectordataprovider to build database-based
relationships (as does ArcGIS, building relationship tables) and it wouldn't
change the already existing code. The only difference would be that the user
would load a view or a query, depending on the DBMS. QGIS already support
some queries on it's data fetching.
2- Creating on-the-fly relationships. These are a bit nasty as they eat up
much memory and system performance. AND, I don't think it would be easy to
implement as it would change how our vectordataprovider reads it's features.
This relationship should be qgis-based as it must allow the user to relate
data in different DBMS. I don't have a clear solution on how to implement
this. Maybe changing the attribute methods inside vectordataprovider so that
it also shows the other attributes.
With the two options the user would be able to join data from the same DBMS
with high performance and data with mixed DBMS with low, but easy,
perfomance.
What do you guys think?

 I think if you don't allow joining of map layers with arbitrary
tabular data sources then you'll not handle a lot of useful use cases,
such as shapefile to CSV data.

If performance is an issue in a particular case, the user could have
the option of saving the map with the joined attributes as real
attributes to a new shapefile/postgis table/ whatever.

BTW, I noticed that in Windows loading a GML layer takes ages; I suspect
this is related to the cost of parsing XMLs (thanks Furieri for noticing!),
as it is the case for WFS loading (I always thought it was slow to load
because of bandwidth, but it seems that is parsing who is the heaviest
part).
Can anyone confirm? Would it be useful to open a ticket?
All the best.

Hi all.

- actions: what does it mean the option "Generic/Windows/Unix/"etc.? I
quickly tried, but apparently win did not work
- Spatialite: apparently current trunk cannot load SL files (all well on
Linux though)
- dropdown menus for editing database values works well, but if the
"modiable" checkbox is checked, it apparently stops working
- field calculator seems to work, but after switching editing off all
fields are 0; after that, I cannot open field calculator again
- if I use the new symbology, vertex markers are not shown during
digitizing (both on win and on lin)
- if we select an impossible reprojection, we get an error message for
*each* vertex to be reprojected, and the only way to escape seems to force
quit QGIS
- topology is not honoured when moving a feature over another
- apparently it is not possible to merge two polygons when one of them has
an island
- I got occasional crashes, in one case when clicking on a node with the
node tool, in another when clicking on "New project"; in the second case
the terminal said: ERROR 1: Attempt to write non-polygon (MULTILINESTRING)
geometry to  type shapefile.

Can anyone confirm/open tickets?
All the best.

Although I havent looked at the code too much, I recall Martins table
updates wrapped providers in a model. I was thinking we could use the
same approach and then select the joined records dynamically as each
model page is accessed....it was just a thought anyway....

r12113:
attribute action improvements
- add python bindings for attribute actions
- support actions as context menu in feature form (ui)
- add action types:
    * generic: commands that should work on all platforms
    * windows, mac, unix: commands that should work and are only shown on one platform respectively
      (eg. vim on unix, notepad on windows and textmate on Mac)
    * python: python strings to be executed instead of a command
      (eg. qgis.utils.pluginsapluginname?.amethod('[%someattribute%]'))

Do you use a spatialite 2.3 dataset?  My 2.2 dataset doesn't seem to work as
the provider queries a field named "read_only" which doesn't exist in
"geometry_columns".

Seems to work here, too.   The edit field allows using new values, but allows
completition of the edited value to a value that is already used in the
column.

Message-ID: <143023C1-994B-4716-BE87-62F74CB37029@hailmail.net>

Martin,

Using the new symbology/rendererV2 from python how do you get access  
to the classification value and its upperValue/LowerValue?

layer.renderverV2() returns a 'QgsFeatureRendererV2', whose type()  
returns the string name of a specific renderer, like  
'categorizedSymbol' (is that the same as the old 'Graduated Symbol'?

But, how do you get that specific renderer object?

Also, I can't figure out how to get upper/lower value from either  
rendererV2.symbols() or their symbolLayer(s).

And I can't see the the classification info in the renderer like I  
used to do be able to get with the normal renderer:

idx = layer.renderer().classificationAttributes()[0]
class_field = layer.dataProvider().fields()[idx]

Pointers __greatly__ appreciated.

Lastly, it appears like the docs are not working for symbology-ng:

http://doc.qgis.org/head/search.php?query=symbology-ng

I am making plugin to write Field Date in Shapefile.

The QGis (1.3) don?t permit create field Date.
I am use GDAL/OGR to make this field (creating the Layer).
I populate with QsField.addAttribute(id, QVariant), but when i open in 
QGis the value of Date field is NULL.
The layer in QGis show field type Date, and i try change value, don?t 
have success, the value back to NULL.

Can work format Date in QGIS ?

For categorized symbol renderer use categories() to get list of
QgsRendererCategoryV2 instances. Then use category's value(), symbol()
and label() methods.
For graduated symbol renderer use ranges() to get list of
QgsRendererRangeV2 instances. Then upperValue(), lowerValue() etc.

"categorizedSymbol" renderer is equal to unique symbol renderer
"graduatedSymbol" renderer is equal to older grad. symbol renderer
there's no equivalent for continuous symbol renderer - graduated
symbol renderer can be used instead


> But, how do you get that specific renderer object?

Ah, it returns always QgsFeatureRendererV2 instance? Maybe I've
forgotten to add conversions to python bindings...

symbols() method is actually designed to be used when overriding
symbol layers rendering order (aka symbol levels).
As stated above, you should use categories() or ranges() methods,
depending on the renderer type.

There's classAttribute() method returning attribute's name used for
classification - both for categorized and graduated symbol renderer.

Seems like the classes are not tagged to be included in the docs. I'll
take a look at it.

Hi Tim

I think the model/view approach is only appropriate when going to use
some of the Qt view classes. For the rest of the uses I don't see any
benefits.

As Marco has written, a way to achieve table joins will be to
transparently add further fields when iterating the vector layer. But
first of all we need some support for tables - basically it's the same
data type like vector layer but doesn't include a geometry, only
attributes. With ability to open and work with separate attribute
tables, we're half done (IMHO).

Yes, that's also something I (shortly) discussed with Marco on the hackfest.

A vector layer would have multiple data providers.  A primary with geometry
and ids and secondaries for joined attributes along with an expression that
connects an primary attribute with an secondary.

The vector layer would report the attributes of all providers as fields.

A nextFeature on the vector layer would trigger a nextFeature on the primary
provider and for each secondary provider a setSubsetString with the expression
from the primary provider and load the secondary attribute via select,
nextFeature and add the secondary attributes to the feature.

The question is how poor that will perform.

Message-ID: <2E95F75EDC25D54999387A1E2E6EF62741FFF74DE8@MBX02.cgcent.miami.edu>

Hello Group,

I have been trying to capture points from my PyQgis application canvas (1.0 Kore OSGeo4W), either using:
- A mapTool to click the point (QgsMapToolEmitPoint) , or
- A straight signal to get the mouse scroll (xyCoordinates)

and I see that whatever I do my application executes BUT closes after the first couple of clicks (or scrolls). It has happended repeatedly and it should be the easiest thing! I understand that QgsMapToolEmitPoint also calls xyCoordinates at some point... Is this a bug or not-implemented of 1.0 Kore?

What other options are available to display coordinates in a textEdit (just what Aaron does in the tutorial, but that snippet also closes my application!)

Thanks very much,
Angelica.

Hi Luiz,

currently in OGR provider there's support only for strings, integers
and doubles. However it wouldn't be much work to add date (or
date+time) support - so if you have some c++ knowledge you might want
to give it a try and prepare a patch...

Right, sounds like a way how to proceed.

Btw. are we talking only about left "outer" join or also inner joins?

Naive table join implementation (i.e. for every feature find joined
table's row) will be probably usable only with very small layers and
tables. A good speed improvement (in exchange with some memory) would
be to keep the joined tables in memory. In future we probably end up
with a simple query scheduler that will recognize provider's
capabilities and indexes and choose an appropriate execution strategy.
Additionally we'll need an indexing structure (B-tree) for simple
providers (e.g. delimitedtext, gpx).

Hi all,

the matter of the fact is that in same condition of the web service
(2000 features) I can see the objects (of "usoSuolo2008") lacated in
"Cagliari Area" both Udig and gvSIG.
I mean these software can load only the '2000 features' of the current
map extent.

I cannot either create a SL datasource using the 2.3 sample dataset.
Tested on both linux and windows using the latest qgis dev code.

I already filed a ticket.

With shapefiles (in qgis?) is not possible, as in not possible merging
non overlapping or non adjacent polygons.

This merge operations are possible with postgis and spatialite layers. 

But here the strange thing: I actually noticed that with postgis and
spatialite layers (type multipolygon) I cannot merge adjacent or
overlapping polygons... 

the message is:

"The union operation would result in a geometry type that is not
compatible with the current layer and therefore is canceled"

the same message when you try to merge non overlapping or non adjacent
polygons (or with islands) in shapefiles.

Moreover in trunk -buth not in 1.3- when I merge in postgis two non
adjacent polygons, after toggling editing I obtain the following

"ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "regions_pkey""

and then

"Could not commit changes to layer regions
Errors: ERROR: 1 feature(s) not added.
SUCCESS: 2 feature(s) deleted."

If the same is done on a spatialite layer only the latter message is
shown (again, only in trunk, not in 1.3).

To test I used the layer "regions" you can find into the spatialite
sample dataset and the layer "world borders" you can find googling the
net.

Seems to me something is wrong, let me know if you want me to file a
ticket.

Hi Giovanni

Please fill 2 tickets:

1. merging of multipolygons

2.  > "Could not commit changes to layer regions
> Errors: ERROR: 1 feature(s) not added.
> SUCCESS: 2 feature(s) deleted."

(probably this is because QgsVectorLayer adds features before deleting.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QtWebKit config issue
Message-ID: <20091203093207.M84015@lqt.it>

Hi,

I've just discovered a QtWebKit related issue while 
building on Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron [SVN trunk r.12315]
I got the following fatal error:
---------
In file included from /usr/include/qt4/QtWebKit/qwebpage.h:24,
    from /usr/include/qt4/QtWebKit/qwebview.h:25,
    from /usr/include/qt4/QtWebKit/QWebView:1,

make[1]: *** [src/helpviewer/CMakeFiles/qgis_help.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
---------

this one seems to be a well-known issue; please see:
http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/2008-05/thread00222-0.html

Accordingly to this, I've then modified -/src/helpviewer/CMakeLists.txt
-------
SET (QT_USE_QTWEBKIT TRUE)
IF (WIN32) 
  SET (QT_USE_QTMAIN TRUE)
ENDIF (WIN32)
FIND_PACKAGE( Qt4 REQUIRED )
INCLUDE( ${QT_USE_FILE} )
-------

after I've applied the above changes I'll finally be able 
to get a clean build on Ubuntu 8.04
I suppose this CMakeLists.txt patch is required anyway,
but I'm not too confident on this ...

Please, can any cmake/Qt 'guru' check and confirm this
before I commit the above change to SVN ?

best regards,
Sandro Furieri

Does r12319 also do the trick?

Hi,

I created a ticket with the patch. (https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2185)
I'm sorry if there are any bugs or if something else is not okay with it.
Now I will add some additional functions and look for bugs I didn't see so far.

Hi J?rgen,

Yes, I confirm: Ubuntu 8.04 can build
r.12319 with no problem at all, so
this issue seems to be definitively
resolved

thanks a lot,

Hi All,

I need transform geometry of one feature to other reference system.

The API of geometry show the method transform
int QgsGeometry::transform(const QgsCoordinateTransform)

But in the Python, this methdos not exist.
Console Python QGis
 > from qgis import
 > core geom = core.QgsGeometry()
 > print dir(geom.transform)
exceptions.AttributeError: 'QgsGeometry' object has no attribute 'transform'

I tested with:
Ubuntu 9.10, QGis 1.3.0-Mimas code revision "exported"
Windows XP, QGis 1.3-Mimas code revision 11638

Do someone use this method in Python ?

Thank you Luiz.

 I think you need to use QgsCoordinateTransform - here's a snippet
from the GeoCoding plugin that transforms a point 'point' from
whatever proj4string is to EPSG:4326 to 'pt'.

   t=QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem()
   t.createFromEpsg(4326)
   f=QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem()
   f.createFromProj4(proj4string)
   transformer = QgsCoordinateTransform(f,t)
   pt = transformer.transform(point)

Sure, it's a method, but you use it as an attribute...
There are missing parenthesis and method argument.

Barry,

Thank?s your menssage.

I can use this :

pt = transformer.transform(point)


But i need change all point in Geometry object, then, i would like make 
this with direct core QGIS by
feat = self.__createFeature(dicAttribute) # function return Feature
coordTrans = core.QgsCoordinateTransform(coordRSLyr, coordRSIntersects)
feat.geometry().transform(coordTrans) # QgsGeometry::transform Not 
Implement in PYTHON!

Hi All,

May be useful to someone this function.
I make a function to change reference system of geometry.
It was used to substitute the lack 
QgsGeometry::transform(const QgsCoordinateTransform)
for Python.

def __transformGeometry(self, geom, coordTrans):
  """
  geom: core.QgsGeometry to be Transform by coordTrans
  coordTrans: core.QgsCoordinateTransform
  """
  for i in range(geom.exportToWkt().count(',')):
    vertex = coordTrans.transform(geom.vertexAt(i))
    geom.moveVertex(vertex.x(), vertex.y(), i)

Message-ID: <5d854a700912041054p50a15758p414a266ad63d30ae@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,

I'm using QGIS with C++ and Qt to develop an application to show radar
information, in the case, georreferenced rasters and layers.

Studying the App example that comes with QGIS, I've already reached this
goal, including with some other capabilities that the requirements
demanded, like Zoom, Coordinates and Layers, but in a "Offline" way.

Now, what I really need is to know if there is a way, using the QGIS API to
render the raster information in a real-time, like that radar applications,
which shows a line (like analog clock second pointers), and draws the points
while the line passes on a section of the mapcanvas.

Thanks in advance, and sorry about my poor english.

Best Regards

Since our plugin version 0.5 many things changed.
Now we have a bug tracker, an svn repository and 2 coders.
Fred Laplante gave a huge contribuition to the project and now it's
usability is extended with the bearing/azimuth possibility, spatial
reference recognition, new user interface, decimal/dms recognition, saved
configuration, extended export/import data and magnetic deviation
correction.
I hope everyone likes it as the plugin is growing and becoming more usefull.
I'd also like to invite anyone to sugest new features and report bugs on our
tracker.

Message-ID: <1260011856.3475.31.camel@lost>

Hi All (and especially translators)

Please note that we are entering string freeze on 14th of December for
the run up to the next release. There might be small changes in the
strings up to that date but i promise there will be not too much.
 
For developers if you are committing bug fixes please avoid changing any
strings and do some only if it's really unavoidable.
Translation .ts files have been updated in SVN so please update your
local svn checkouts.

The period for translations will close 20th-December-2009 (i.e. about
two weeks from now) and then we will be branching for release. Any
translations submitted to us after that time will only be included in
the next release, so please submit what you have by then even if it is
not complete.

As always you can track the release plans via the checklist at:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist1.4.0

If you have any questions about the translation process, please see the
following page which includes instructions on how to generate a .ts file
for a new locale. http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Gui_Translations

Many thanks to all the translators out there for the great work you do! 

Regards, 
Werner

P.S.: The list of Translation Progress is here 
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/GUI_Translation_Progress#QGIS_Current_trunk_Version_Progress
and I'll try  to update it frequently as more and more translation files
come in

Hi Guys,

people start putting mapserverexport-issues in trac on my name (and Erik 
and Stephan, I consider them your problem also  now  ;-)  )...

see https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2189

what's the general opinion on this one?

Should we NOT quote the datastring? I think that is actually more safe 
to do then quoting like we do now ...
Quoting should only be needed when people deliberatly use spaces or 
ampersends in their tablenames...

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0912051157i674d73b0x7baaaaea24952435@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just stumpled upon a nasty problem with dynamic linking: I'm
getting a crash when trying to use GPX provider with current GDAL
trunk. The reason is that there's a new GTM driver for OGR. This
driver however uses the same "Track" and "Waypoint" class names as GPX
provider does in its code. When opening a GPX file in QGIS, virtual
destructors for these classes are overridden by the ones from the GTM
driver and causing crashes.

Can anybody confirm this problem? (I'm on Linux)
Any opinions how to cope with this? The simplest thing that comes to
my mind is to rename the classes in GPX provider, but maybe there's
some better solution...

Regards
Martin

Message-ID: <c422d6cd0912061152m69cce271pd7a545e2afdb42f3@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list
I have been given a university assignment of applying Furnas's DOI[1]
function in a GIS. I'd like to do this as a Qgis plugin :)
The plugin will basicly perform some filtering on the visibility of
the features that get displayed on the map canvas, according to a
defined Degree of Interest Function. This function combines an A
Priori Interest function for each feature, as well as a distance
function, that will probably be based on the last mouse click over the
canvas.

I am still just trying to wrap my head around this task, but have
started to explore the Qgis API.

I'd like to ask some questions:

1 - Can I subset a vector layer so that only some features get loaded?
What I mean is using the same kind of functionality that the "subset"
text area on the "general" tab of the "layer properties" dialog
allows. I have searched the API for something like this, but couldn't
find it. Maybe I'm not well familiarized with it yet. can someone
point me to the right classes/methods?

2 - Alternatively, can I selectively hide some features from the
canvas? I have seen that there is a class called QgsFeatureRendererV2
that has a renderFeature member function. Will I be able to use this
through the python plugins interface?

I hope my plugin turns out to be not very crappy and that I can
release it to the world!

Thanks for your help

Message-ID: <1fef7d9b0912070608n1ca7c0bdpb1d26304f1b04193@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a GRASS lib conflict between the QGIS 1.3 packages installed
from the Ubuntu PPA and my locally compiled GRASS. My self compiled
GRASS works and QGIS 1.3 from the PPA works with GRASS support. QGIS
trunk compiles, but throws a G__no_gisinit error on startup. The GRASS
paths all point to my self compiled version in cmake. How do I prevent
QGIS trunk from finding the PPA GRASS libs, while maintaining a
working QGIS 1.3?

The file /etc/ld.so.conf contains:
include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
/usr/local/lib
/usr/local/src/grass6_devel/dist.i686-pc-linux-gnu/lib

and the file /etc/ld.so.conf.d/grass.conf contains:
/usr/lib/grass/lib

So it seems that the PPA GRASS lib gets preference. Thanks for any pointers,

Craig

PS I'm on Ubuntu 9.04 and GRASS 6.5

If you install the grass plugin /usr/bin/qgis becomes a shell script that sets
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which overrides you ld.so.conf.

Thanks for the tip J?rgen! Solved by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH first and
then launching QGIS trunk in a script.

A short follow up note: I've removed the usage of exceptions within
QgsProject in r12349 and r12350.
Now you should be able to do something like this:

if !QgsProject.instance().read():
  print "Error:", QgsProject.instance().error()

Yes, you can use QgsVectorLayer::setSubsetString() string. That's
exactly what's used for setting subsets in vector layer properties
dialog. It however works currently only with layers from PostGIS,
SpatiaLite and OGR providers.

Hiding features by not drawing them is also an option, though I
wouldn't recommend it to you as it would bring many new problems (e.g.
there are currently two implementation of vector layer renderers -
QgsRenderer and QgsFeatureRendererV2). I think you don't want to go
this way...

Good luck and don't forget to give us a note about the plugin once it's ready!

Martin,

Fantastic, thank you.

I also just noticed http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/12347 which I  
figure might help too.

Cheers!

Hi Richard,

from my point of view we need more details e.g. the complete broken and
working mapfiles including the used DBMS in order to reproduce the
behaviour because according to me (and your quote says the same) the two
data statements:
      * "way" FROM "osm_polygon"
      * way FROM osm_polygon
are treated as exactly the same by PostgreSQL.

In the FILTER example I only see the deleted space at the end but I
guess it was meant to change following:
      * "nature"='water' or "landuse"='basin' or "landuse"='reservoir'
        or "waterway"='riverbank'
      * nature='water' or landuse='basin' or landuse='reservoir' or
        waterway='riverbank'
Then the same argument as above applies.

Unless we can reproduce an error I opt for sticking with the quoting
because it is a lot safer and should not make any difference in
PostgreSQL if you only use lower case but give the correct result used
with upper case identifiers.

Hi Ming Xing

The problem is that it does not properly link with gdal and sqlite libraries. 
I think it is necessary to include the library name into the definitions. So 
something like:

-DGDAL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libgdal.so
-DSQLITE3_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libsqlite3.so


Regards,
Marco

No problem at all.  I'm sure there will be enough interesting tasks to be done 
in the GRASS plugin also in 2010 ;-)

Message-ID: <48d9b78e0912080522q2993dc28xb4c8668e186183fa@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

I have a lot of DTED data slice.
I want to load them in qgis and use the elevation data to do some
computation in a plug-in.
Inside the plugin I would want to get the elevation data specifing the
lower-left and upper right corner(in lat/lon) of a grid of elevation data.
My problems are:

1) the points of the grid can, in general, belong to different layer (each
dted slice is a layer), so how to correctly select this points from the
layerset.
2) For a data grid of elevation point I would want also specifies the number
of points for each side of the grid, so probably an interpolation is needed.


Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance
Luca

Hi Everyone,

I was wondering if there is a timeline for getting the new labeling engine in the map composer. It is great to be able to improve labels in the canvas, but not being able to visualize and print them in a fully developed map from the composer is unfortunate.

I ask because I have some current projects with a near-term deadline. I will need to switch to something else for my map output if there is no expectation to deliver this anytime soon.

Thanks,
John

Hi John

We are working on making the new symbology printer friendly right now.
Labels will come next I guess. But if you need a solution real soon, it's 
probably saver to use something else in the short term.

Hi Marco,

Thanks for the update. I'll work on an alternative approach for now, but keep my eye on the composer commits and test as they are applied to trunk. Keep up the great work!

Hello Guys,
Any Ideas?
Just plot a single pixel at a specific coordinate?

You can add annotations to your print composer in the trunk version of qgis, so 1.4.0, due to be released around the end of the month will do that for you. You might see if a nightly build is available on your platform.

Alternatively, you can create a new vector point layer and add a point to the desired location.

Map annotations would be a nice addition. You can look in the bug tracker and create an enhancement request if it is not already there.

Cheers,
John

Hi Sergio.

Take a look at the QgsVertexMarker class. This way you can add points to the
map canvas.

Sergio,

Also, you can use "Temporay Layer" to not create layer in file.

I'll study the class. Do you know where I may find some sample of its usage?

Hi Luiz, thanks for your reply, too.

Exactly, they will have to be temporary, because I want to create a
lot of points. :)
As you suggested before, I've tried using the QGsRubberBand, but it
only draws lines and polygons, not just points. But thanks anyway.

Best Regards,

I guess this can help you:

*self.marker = QgsVertexMarker( self.canvas )
*
*self.marker.setCenter( QgsPoint( x, y ) ) *
*self.marker.setIconType( 1 ) *
*self.marker.setIconSize( 10 ) *
*self.marker.setColor( QColor( 255,0,0,255 ) ) *
*self.marker.setPenWidth ( 1 ) *

As you see, just define the marker with your canvas as parent and set the
properties.

Regards.

I guess QgsVertexMarker just works with the current map canvas reference
system.

I don't know if this is what you ask.

Germ?n! It workerd great!
As I'm using C++ with Qt, the code to draw just a white point is here:

 QgsVertexMarker *marker = new QgsVertexMarker(m_qgsImage);

 marker->setCenter( QgsPoint( -51.235, -16.9316 ) );
 //marker->setCenter( QgsPoint( -51.235, -16.9316 ) );
 marker->setIconType( 3 );
 marker->setIconSize( 10 );
 marker->setColor( QColor( 255,255,255,255 ) );
 marker->setPenWidth ( 1 );

I was very happy...Until I zoomed the area. As a vector, obviously,
when zoomed, it remained as a small point. And, as I need to draw a
lot of points to draw a larger image composed by them, I needed that
this zoom to escale the point like a raster file. Is there a way to
plot the point onto the rasterfile?

Atenciosamente,

This caused #2270.  E.g. OGR was returning a MULTIPOLYGON with 2 POLYGONs
instead of a POLYGON with 2 rings.

Changing OGR_ORGANIZE_POLYGONS to ONLY_CCW in r12414 cured that.

Message-ID: <baea77b10912111633o320dbf62q2833fbd595a1fdfe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

in this moment the GdalTools-plugin (written in python)
opens the online GDAL documentation.

I would change it behaviour to open the local gdal doc if
available (people either may not be ever connected or may
not have installed the last gdal version), but I don't know
how to retrieve its local path so as it works in every os.

Do you have any ideas to resolve this problem?
Thanks.

I think the same problem has been approached (and solved) for the GRASS plugin: can
you have a look to it?
All the best.

Hi

Try to update and compile again. When you get this type of error you
can always try to run ccmake .. then press g to regenerate the
makefiles. Then compile anew.

Hi Sergio,

what are you actually trying to do? Draw an image on the canvas at
some specified place? You might want to create a class derived from
QgsMapCanvasItem that would do the rendering in a way you want it to
be.

After a short talk with Sergio, we found that what he wants is to set the
points size in map units, just like QGIS does it.

So he is looking at the setPointSizeUnits method from QgsSymbol class. This
way he can't use QgsVertexMarker (I guess), so he should use a temporal
layer.

Hi all.
An icon (Settings>Options>Overlay) look ok in EN, but is moved to the right in IT

Fixing this should be quick.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Simplify tool dialog
Message-ID: <20091215104601.GE23203@keybit.net>

Hi all,
I've had problems using the simplify tool due to inadeguate range
of the slider being used. I've seen qgis tries to compute this range
automatically ( QgsMapToolSimplify::calculateSliderBoudaries() ).

Now, I've no idea what that calculator does but for me any position
not touching the left side was too much. If you accept a suggestion
I think having a numeric field, in addition to the slider, would
help in these cases (ie: allowing me to enter a precise number).
Hopefully qt has neat widgets for this kind of things.

Hi,
the idea behind the slider was that it is more intuitive to use than
requiring a numeric tolerance parameter (that might be complicated for
users to figure out empirically). So we will calculate the boundaries
of slider for each simplified shape. On the left side the shape should
stay untouched, on the right side the shape should be reduced to
minimal number of vertices (two for lines, three for polygons).

The slider range should be probably logarithmic instead of linear to
avoid the kind of problem you have.

I also understand that power users might want to specify the tolerance
precisely, so adding a spin box with tolerance (connected to slider)
makes sense. Please file an enhancement ticket for this.

I understand it. Just saying that if (for any reason) the simplified interface
strikes back (as in my case) it is nice to have an *additional* manual control.
In my case the slider was simply unusable.

Yes, a spin box is likely the one I was looking for :)

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0912150429m4093b293y3a86d89684b9e150@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

the default "new symbology" style with symbols and color ramps (see
menu Options > Style Manager) is pretty boring. It would be great to
enhance the default style with a wider spectrum of general purpose
symbols. I'm sure early adopters have been adding some nice symbols to
their style, if you're one of them please send me (or to this list)
your style file (~/.qgis/symbology-ng-style.xml). My target is to have
~50 symbols and ~20 color ramps in the release. The symbols can be
simple, but they should have a correct label.

Thanks
Martin

You forgot attribute based rotation (and position / offset ?) in the TODO
list :-)

hm - I see the same problem in other languages (e.g. german) whenever the
text is to long, f.e. "Beschriftungen" instead of labels.

It seems like the icon is centered on the text, but I agree with Paolo
that left-aligned icons would look better. Is this possible?

No I didn't :)
It's fourth item (data-defined rotation and size)

Hi Giovanni,

but there's not (yet) a support for external ramps, so one has to live
with what we have: gradient ramps, random color ramps and colorbrewer
ramps.

Hello everybody:

I'm working in a simple application that shows the bearing and distance from
a reference point to the cursor position, but when I'm trying to calcute
them, distanceArea of MapRenderer returns a NaN
I've checked the configuration of mapcanvas and every thing looks fine. This
is a chunk of code where I do the configuration:

QString fileName = "config.xml";
        configMgt = new ConfigMgt(fileName, this);
        QgsProviderRegistry::instance(configMgt->sPluginDir);
        QgsApplication::setPkgDataPath(configMgt->sPkgDir);
        QgsApplication::setPrefixPath(configMgt->sPkgDir);

        // Add Map Canvas
        mpMapCanvas = new QgsMapCanvas(0, 0);
        mpMapCanvas->enableAntiAliasing(true);
        mpMapCanvas->useImageToRender(false);

	installation
Message-ID: <baea77b10912151025g34faa836y809e98968db496ab@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
I've installed the OSGeo4W on Vista to close a GdalTools-plugin
ticket (https://trac.faunalia.it/GdalTools-plugin/ticket/31).

The error instead is that there are 2 gdal_contour.exe, one in
"%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin and the other in
"%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\gdal-16\bin.
Their size are also different!

In the qgis.bat file there are 2 lines that adds both the 2
gdal_contour.exe paths:

call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\o4w_env.bat
    that add to PATH the \bin
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\gdal16.bat
    that add to PATH the \apps\gdal-16\bin

By the way, the first work fine, the second no and, after it creates
the output, it crashes.

Why are 2 and, mainly, why are different?
Thanks a lot.

Sure they are:
"%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\gdal_contour.exe is from GDAL 1.5 and
"%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\gdal-16\bin is from GDAL 1.6.

QGIS uses GDAL 1.6.  And GDAL 1.6's bin preceedes the general
OSGeo4W bin that has GDAL 1.5.

You need to source gdal16.bat to use GDAL 1.6 (which is what qgis-dev.bat
does), otherwise you might mix GDAL 1.6 executables with GDAL 1.5 DLLs.

I've already called the gdal16.bat, but nothing. So I've reinstalled OSGeo4W.

In this moment I've installed qgis-dev and only gdal-16 executables, but the
gdal_contour.exe yet crashes. It seems to works fine on XP, but crashes both
on Vista and Seven.

Could this be a gdal issue? What do you think about?
Thank you.

Hi All (and especially translators)

As of today please note that we are entering string freeze for the run
up to the next release. If you are committing bug fixes please avoid
changing any strings. Translation .ts files have been updated in SVN so
please update your local svn checkouts.
The period for translations will close ~Dez-21-2009 (i.e. about one week
from now) and then we will be branching for release. Any translations
submitted to us after that time will only be included in the next
release, so please submit what you have by then even if it is not
complete. As always you can track the release plans via the checklist
at:

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Release_Checklist_1.4

If you have any questions about the translation process, please see the
following page which includes instructions on how to generate a .ts file
for a new locale.

Many thanks to all the translators out there for the great work you do!

Hi all,

Does someone use rasterlang plugin?

It appears that its use breaks raster loading of QGIS under
Win/OSGeo4W. Can someone confirm?

1. Install new pyparsing package (packaged today by Juergen)
2. Install rasterlang plugin
3. Restart QGIS
4. Try loading any raster (even if plugin is switched off) -> error

5. Deinstall rasterlang
6. Restart QGIS
7. Load raster -> all fine now

This might be related to pyparsing also. It seems strange, that a
plugin would block important core functionality of QGIS just by being
present on the harddrive.

Dear All,


I posted two plugins for worker with INPE catalog (http://www.dgi.inpe.br/CDSR/), where, brazilian peoples can make
download free images satellites.

These plugins are used to selected area(mapcanvas, active layer and selected features) and obtain the layer of catalog
INPE, after, you can see quicklook the imagens and make order to download (need have login in INPE site).

The idea is to attract brazilian's users GIS for know QGIS.

The year is ending, then, merry christmas and happy new years.

In others word, the plugin load the layer and set the UniqueValueRenderer.
 From now on, the user can, throught a form, show or hide one o more

This menu is empty because you haven't created any print composer elements
in your project. If you have one or more print composers saved, they will
appear in this menu.

I find this menu quite useful and wouldn't remove it.

Hi Paolo,

I've fixed it today in version 0.5.6.
In fact it wasn't that easy stuff as it's a result of different C
runtime DLLs on windows (bad file descriptors).

The detection of shp2pgsql / pgsql2shp tool has not been done so far,
you need to have those tools in default path.

Cheers
Martin

Hi Oscar,

to get some help, you should simplify the code you've posted: the
longer the pasted code is, less likely that someone will take time to
compile it and check for the problem. If you'll be able to isolate
your issue into few statements, there's higher chance you'll get some
advice.

Even better if you translate the code to Python code so that people
can try it directly e.g. from qgis python console...

Hi Michele,

this should be possible. Having a layer, get its renderer:
r = layer.renderer()
Then get list of symbols:
syms = r.symbols()

Check QgsSymbol documentation to see what's possible to do with
symbols - you can query the symbol properties, upper and lower value
of range for symbol or also set the properties, e.g.:
syms[0].setLineWidth(3)
(will set line width to 3 mm)

One small warning: from the next release (v1.4) there will be
additionally a new symbology implementation. For more information
about the topic, see: http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Symbology-NG

Message-ID: <C227AF6F-FB90-419A-BA47-63997DF4084F@wildnevada.org>

Hi Marco,

Do you have any plans to make the display of longitude/lattitude grids with degrees-minutes-seconds labels possible? It would be a useful option as most people read those better than decimal degrees as that is the traditional format. Also, it would be nice to even be able to toggle between UTM and DMS when the coordinate system is a projected coordinate system, such as UTM. I'm not sure how feasible that latter request is though.

One other thought on grids. It would be nice to be able to have another option beyond lines and cross marks for grids. This other option would be to have tick marks on the map boundary. Perhaps they could even be user-selectable as to whether they occur on the inside or outside of the boundary, kind of like the labeling options.

Cheers,
John

Hi All

I would like to postpone the branch for release of QGIS 1.4 to 28 Dec
to give us a little time for final polishing and bug fixing. The
string freeze and feature freeze would remain in effect. Any
objections? If there are a significant number of -1's I will go ahead
and branch tomorrow night.

Hi William,

Context help works great in the xcode build system you have provided. For some reason, it is not working with cmake builds. I wondered if there was some customization code that needs to be included in the cmake process that can be gleaned from your work on getting it built with xcode. If you have any thoughts on this, that would be great.

Thanks,

install_name_tool is an automatic thing with cmake during the install step.  It sees qgis_help.app executable as on the same dir level as qgis itself, so it can't backtrack dirs.  You would have to hardcode an install_name_tool *after* install (somehow) in the cmakelists.txt.  The other solution is to create symlinks in qgis_help back to libqgis_core.dylib, and not worry about the install_name.

Looking over William's comments on the thread he pointed out, I ran the following command and got the help system working for my setup. Perhaps someone else can figure out how to get this into the cmake build system so it will be done automagically:

install_name_tool -change @executable_path/lib/libqgis_core.1.4.0.dylib @executable_path/../../../../lib/libqgis_core.1.4.0.dylib /Applications/qgis1.4.0.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/qgis_help.app/Contents/MacOS/qgis_help

Hi all,

Faunalia and GIS-lab communities create an experimental version
of GDAL Tools plugin for QuantumGIS. The main goal of this branch is
to enhance a existing tool than recreate a new one.

At this moment we have a new Info tool (gdalinfo), localization support and
some minor improvements in Merge tool. Also we working on other improvements.

The experimental version available at Faunalia plugin repository
http://www.faunalia.it/qgis/plugins.xml

Please test and report.

I haven't tested it yet (not time currently) but what I would need is a 
gdal2xyz.py somewhere - probably it's already a button somewhere..
is that easy to integrate or rather difficult?

Hi,
My Python doesn't like the hyphen in the module name:
1. Plugin Installer  can't recognize this plugin as installed,
2. I can't import it manually.
3. Qgis can, but only if the old GdalTools are uninstalled.

So I suggest at least to rename is to gdaltools_experimental. 

But why not to merge it with the old GdalTools, as an experimental version of 
the same module? Users will be still able to choose between them and there 
will be only one plugin directory. I prefer to keep users' harddisks clean 
rather than create directories designed to being abandoned in a few weeks.

1. Rename the directory to GdalTools (exactly the same module name)
2. Rename the zip file to GdalTools.experimental.zip (module name DOT suffix DOT 
zip - it must be a DOT)
3. Set the <experimental>true</experimental> tag in the repo
4. Keep the version number always higher for the experimental one.

Then, Plugin installer will always prefer the experimental version, as long as 
experimental plugins are allowed. Otherwise, the stable one will be choosen.

Hi Luca.

I guess you have troubles with qgis_prefix. You should set it to point the
QGIS dir.

e.g.   qgis_prefix = '/usr'     (On Ubuntu it works)

Then all the users who have already installed the first version will be asked 
for removing the depreciated directory. So better to do it sooner then later

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Composer legend labels
Message-ID: <46BD1E67-8CB3-4A17-A9CB-8B422FCBFD5C@gmail.com>

Hi Marco,

I am so impressed with all the great enhancements to the print composer. So much so that I use it for production work quite regularly, happily jettisoning the use of mapserver.

With this additional use, I discover possible enhancements that I want to send your direction. I hope you don't mind the suggestions. I tend to send these as I discover the need. Here are a couple new ones, I think.

I really love the way text is automatically wrapped for text labels. It would be very useful if legend text items would similarly wrap when adjusting the width of the legend. I don't know if this is something that can be readily accomplished or not, but it would be helpful.

Another legend consideration: Layer items are shown with the layer title above the vector/raster symbol. It would be nice if layer titles could be placed directly to the right of the vector symbol with a user-configurable option. This makes the most sense for single symbol vector layers, but no sense for categorized layers. The legend would need to be smart enough to distinguish between the two and label accordingly.

An additional text box enhancement would be to allow user-selectable justification of text. Options for both horizontal and vertical alignment would be ideal. Vertical: top, bottom, center of text box. Horizontal: left, right, center justified.

Cheers,
John

Maybe I miss something important, but now I think that
integration of new tools is not much difficult.

It should be very easy in fact: after the refactoring, most elements are shared among
command, so only command specifics should be added.
All the best.

I'm not sure. I do use this to set the qgis_prefix:
-----------------------------------------------
*    if os.name == "nt":
        osgeo4wDir = "C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis-1.3"
        basicDir = "C:/qgis"

        if os.path.isdir( osgeo4wDir ):
            qgis_prefix = osgeo4wDir
        else:
            qgis_prefix = basicDir
    else:
        qgis_prefix = "/usr"*

*    if not os.path.isdir( qgis_prefix ):
        raise RuntimeError, "QGIS dir not found!"*
-----------------------------------------------

Even better is to copy the plugins and resources dirs from QGIS installation
to your application dir. This way you can set the qgis_prefix to '.' .
(Tested on Windows)

For single symbol layers, it is already possible to place the layer title next 
to the symbol. Just enter the layer name to the symbol item and remove the 
layer level string. Then the layer item will disappear.

This is a good idea. It would however need a bit extension to the legend item 
to change it to a table structure where the user may resize the columns and 
rows.

True, this would be very usefull and could be added easily (since QPainter 
provides all the necessary options). So once the feature freeze is over...

An ah-ha moment! Thanks for pointing that out. This is exactly what I was looking for.

Indeed, the feature freeze prevents these changes. I just wanted to get my thoughts your direction to add to your list of possible enhancements.

Hi all.
Today I played with Maemo, a potential platform for bringing QGIS to mobile.
Everything quite nice and smooth, you end up quickly having a full virtual Debian
machine on your desktop, where you can install and compile.
Obviously, to compile QGIS there we have to bring a lot of dependencies in - I
started with geos, and got stuck because of an unfilled dep (debhelper >= 7; 5
available on maemo). So the road is more difficult than it should be, but
nevertheless interesting.
Anyone willing to share experiences and join forces?
All the best.

Hi Marco,

Another quick idea presented itself to me just now. It would be nice in the composer if you could duplicate a map composer item. In my current workflow, I have to create two virtually identical maps. It would be ideal to simply duplicate the first and then make the minor changes to viewed layers.

Cheers,

Hi Paolo,

did you test with a software emulation or an actual mobile device, such 
as the N900? I ordered an N900 and would be interested in getting QGIS 
to work on the Maemo platform. I didn't get the device yet.

Hi Andreas.
I think the sane way to go is to do everything on the SDK, and install the packages
on the physical machine only when ready.
No, I did not buy the N900 (no need for it now), but I promised myself I will,
if/when I'll be able to compile and run QGIS on it ;)
All the best.

Just a quick question because I am curious.  Is the next version (1.4) going
to have support for 3D points?  I see a Point3D class in the documentation.
Right now my app uses OGR dirctly for this but I didn't want to do it that
way.  Also, what is the difference between a Point25D and Point3D?

I'm sorry if it's in portuguese, but my blog's main audience is my brazilian

Anyway, the screenshots says everything one needs to configure it so that
eclipse uses osgeo4w python and imports qgis and pyqt4.
I hope it helps.

Well, after some testing I found out that qgis now can open dbf files as
vector layers. It's enough for me to create the "relate" implementation.
As far as I can see, it's possible and won't take too long to implement.
Will it be usefull? Is anyone already working on a full join implementation?

Hi Matthew

There is already support for 3D points. I'm using it e.g. in the interpolation 
plugin / analysis library to do interpolation from 2.5D shapefiles. I haven't 
tried it with postgis, but suppose that it works too.

But afaik, you cannot access the z-coordinate with QgsPoint. You need to check 
if the geometry is a 2.5D type and parse the WKB to get it (see e.g. 
qgstininterpolator.cpp:204)

Point3D is a point type in the interpolation code. But it comes originally 
from external code, so cannot be used together with the core classes.


Regards,
Marco

The idea behind this plugin is that it would use qgsvectorlayer  (that
supports shapefile, postgresql, grass, dbf, etc) and would join only a
single feature attributes.
So i'm proposing that the user would select a feature and would be able to
find everything related to it. Every relationship could be stored in a
relationship file so that you could reproduce it for a given data model.
It's a major problem in Brasil because we defined a new spatial model and
qgis is not able to read relationships. At least, the user should be able to
build them to look for non-spatial relations of a given feature.
Well, as soon as I have a working plugin i'm going to release it. If anyone
have interest in it, please tell me so I can continue working without
loosing my time. :P

Subject: [Qgis-developer] scaling points size according to attribute values
Message-ID: <c422d6cd0912271232v4779f915jd4b2484f2da2e5a1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list
How can I change a points' size according to the values of one of its
attributes programatically? What I mean is achieving the same effect
that the GUI allows in layer properties -> symbology -> area scale
field ?

I have been trying to use the setScaleclassificationField method of
the QgsSymbol class, but it doesn't seem to work...
Here is a piece of my python code, where I try to scale the symbol
according to the gid attribute of a postgis layer:

...
renderer = layer.renderer()
symbols = renderer.symbols()
symbols[0].setScaleClassificationField(provider.fieldNameIndex("gid"))
layer.triggerRepaint()

Instead of what I wanted, this piece of code will reset the symbols'
size to 1 and it doesn't scale them according to the "gid" attribute
at all.
thanks for your help

Hi Marco,

Thanks for your input.  I took a look at your code in
qgstininterpolator.cpp.  That looks like a pretty good way to do it,
but is not exactly what I was hoping for.  It would be nice if we
could access the z-coordinate with QgsPoint.  I know there has been
some discussion of this on the list in the past; maybe I will have to
look into this more.  Maybe I will switch over to using a code similar
to yours instead of using OGR which does have access to the
z-coordinate but is not part of the QGIS API.  In fact, the code I am
working on is very similar to yours; it adds points/lines to a
Delaunay triangulation (CGAL library) which supports exact arithmetic.
 Anyway, thanks again.

Matt

Hi all.
Please remember that one of our users is available to donate some money 
to implement table joins.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] addendum to SRS db
Message-ID: <4B385F46.8020702@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Standard EPSG code for Italian projections (3003 and 3004) do not 
include datum; as a result, reprojection is always wrong by about 100 m. 
Can we add 4 more projection definition to our SRS database?
It should  only be added the +towgs84 parameter so that we'll have:

3003 corrected, mainland: same as 3003, with
+towgs84=-104.1,-49.1,-9.9,0.971,-2.917,0.714,-11.68

3004 corrected, mainland: same as 3004, with
+towgs84=-104.1,-49.1,-9.9,0.971,-2.917,0.714,-11.68

3003 corrected, Sardinia: same as 3003, with
+towgs84=-168.6,-34.0,38.6,-0.374,-0.679,-1.379,-9.48

3004 corrected, Sicily:  same as 3004, with
+towgs84=-50.2,-50.4,84.8,-0.690,-2.012,0.459,-28.08

In GRASS this has been solved by a similar approach:
http://freegis.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/grass/src/libes/gis/datumtransform.table?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain
I think this can be done now, as it does not impact anything else, and 
it would make life a lot easier for Italian users (remember, the second 
largest QGIS user community!).
Details in http://www.crs-geo.eu/
Thanks a lot.

Very interesting! But, when I have set those options, how can I run QGIS

Well, I still am not able to run qgis from inside pydev. I think that it's
possible, but I still don't know how. Maybe pointing the qgis binary as
executable to run...
As far as I'm testing, I've wrote qgis applications to test my plugins. Just
like a new qgis python application.
It's a workaround, but as soon as I hear something about debuging with qgis
binaries I will report.

Great.
I think we can also chat on #qgis channel. I'm not planning to work intensively on
this, but if we can share the load, we might end up with something useful.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I don't have the nokia n900 yet but I would be interrested to help you 
to get qgis working on it. I'm going to dowload and install the SDK 
later today and see what I can do. You can contact me off-list or via

CRS ids larger than 100000 are reserved for user defined CRSes in QGIS.

Any other code >32768 and <100000 would do then.
Anyway, I see Tim has already branched - too bad for us poor Italians :(

Message-ID: <b2de29ac0912281420r77f3d098lb5b04861864a971f@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

--- Note to casual readers ---

Please do not pre-announce this release - give the packagers and
release team a chance to do their thing so that people hearing about
the release have a fair chance of finding a package, reading all our
press material etc.

--- End note ---

Today I have branched QGIS 1.4.0 'Enceladus' for release. It would be
great if you can assist by making packages for your preferred
platform. The branch can be checked out at:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_4_0 qgis-1_4_0

Source tarballs can be obtained from here:

http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.4.0.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.4.0.tar.gz.md5


Please do not commit anything to the release branch except packaging
related tweaks.

If you make a package please be so kind as to send me an email with
details of where I can download the package. Please make sure the
package is wgettable since I do not have the bandwidth to first
download all packages to my home pc and then up again to the download
server.

If you are able to make packages for unlisted platforms / distros
please let me know so that we can avoid duplication of effort.

I would like to make the release announcement around the 7th of Jan,
so it will be great to have as many packages as possible ready by
then.

SVN (Trunk) is open again for general commits - please seek guidance
from Marco Hugentobler (PSC Code Manager) if you are planning any
major code changes.


The timeline for our future releases will, as always, available here:

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/roadmap


Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS a
reality.

Lastly can I call on the release team to put together visual
changelog, press announcements etc. ready for the release date? I will
send you an email when the packages are ready and you can start
broadcasting announcements.

Best regards

Small detail - release name was still "Trunk".  I updated cmakelists.txt and the xcode project.  You should repack the tarball.

Sorry it missed the boat...lets address if for the next release - the
optimal way would be to submit your corrections to epsg and then we
update our db to match the official defs. See previous threads /
arguments / discussions about this topic e.g.
http://www.mail-archive.com/qgis-user@lists.osgeo.org/msg00218.html

Thanks William, I've replaced the source tarball with your updated version.

Jim could you rebuild your package with the updated tarball if poss so
that the release name is correct?

Thanks

AFAIK, EPSG does not accept multiple +towgs84 parameters for the same projection,
that's why they are not included (and why GRASS is applying local changes too).
If someone have different evidence, I'm ready to submit the stuff to EPSG.
For now, can you please apply the addendum to our resources/crs.db ?
I think IDs of 39031, 39032, 39041, 39042 should be ok.
Thanks.
All the best.

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

Hi all,
I recently seen a few new plugins available in the qgis contributed
repository and among them there are a couple that seems to have
problems.


*) "export to mysql", author "tantos", the plugin returns the following
python error

Traceback (most recent call last):

Python version:

*) "zoom to village", author "Ketan, Akash", the plugins simply freezes
qgis (1.4 installed on Ubuntu 9.04).

 Yes, but when a plugin is hardcoded to connect to a host by IP number
on a private network I wouldn't expect it to really function:

ZoomToVillageDialog.py:56
 self.conn=psycopg2.connect("dbname='tehsil' user='postgres'
password='biond123' host='192.168.1.103' port='5432'")

 Suggest you contact the author:
ZoomToVillageDialog.py:9
    email                : ketanbiond@gmail.com

Message-ID: <3B9F063A-65F0-4FF7-97A3-A13CBED632FA@mrcc.com>

Greetings,

As you know QGIS has been developed primarily by a wide ranging group  
of volunteers, including developers, translators, web maintainers,  
artists, and documentation writers.

One of the most beneficial events has been the face-to-face developer  
meetings. These events provide a venue in which major issues can be  
sorted out and new features planned and prototyped. The developer  
meetings thus far have been very productive in advancing QGIS.

We are currently planning a developer meeting in Pisa in the spring of  
2010. The sponsorship goal for the event is 10,500 Euro ($15,000 US).  
This will allow us to bring 15 developers together. Please consider  
donating for this worthwhile event.

You can find information on the sponsorship program, its benefits, and  
the developer meeting at http://qgis.org/en/sponsorship.html.

Thank you for supporting QGIS!

-gary

Indeed. I know that there is some way to make pydev search everything and
build autocomplete, but I haven't looked much into it. I don't really use
autocomplete... And eclipse is a really demanding IDE. It takes a really
well tuned PC to make it worth the processing and memory cost. It's one of
the main reasons I looked for better PCs... (sadly)
On this post I wrote about how to debug a python plugin running qgis and
watching variables and breakpoints from eclipse's pydev.
http://mauriciodepaulo.blogspot.com/2009/12/pydev-e-qgis.html
As it's written in portuguese i'm going to explain a bit here.
You have to call the pydev daemon from your python script and start the
eclipse debug server.
Whenever the script is run, it will try to fetch the server and will debug
it.
If the server is not on, the script fails.
Hope it helps.

Sorry for the wrong information.
On my ubuntu 9.10 eclipse already found Qt. I think that if it's recognized
in the PythonPath on PyDev's Preferences it loads the API. Eclipse takes a
looooong time trying to index the APIs available for a given python
instalation.
I'm going to try it on windos vista later.

Mauricio de Paulo

Message-ID: <4B3B69E3.8040408@gmail.com>

Dears all,

I?m tested the QGIS (1.4.0-1 unstable release) from OSGEO4W

First i see the name of  window's title, Quantum GIS rexported, i 
believe the name would be Quantum GIS plus number of version.

The raster layer don't accepts "on the fly", then, i suggest a few 
features:
1) By default the project could have enable with "on the fly"
2) The dialog box "Project Properties" Coordinate Reference System(CSR) 
could have the listbox with
coordinate system of all layers(if have CRS) to select CSR of project
3) If raster layer CRS in project QGIS have different of projection CRS 
then checkbox this layer could show unable.
If user click in this checkbox, could show the information message box 
with the projection will change for CSR raster layer

Ok, working also for windows vista.
Maybe you misconfigured something. If the interpreter has the module loaded
PyDev will load it's API.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Re: scaling points size according to attribute
	values

Hello list
Having fixed my problem, I'm going to reply to myself, leaving this as
a reference for someone who may stumble upon this in the future.

In order to get the size of the points of my vector layer scaled
according to some attribute's values I had to:
- create a new symbol object
- set its graphical properties, including the scale field
- create a new renderer of type QgsSingleSymbolRenderer
- add the symbol to the renderer
- add the renderer to the vector layer

so, the working python code is something like:
...
symbol = QgsSymbol(layer.geometryType())
symbol.setBrush(oldSymbol.brush())
...
(set the rest of the symbol's properties)
...
symbol.setScaleClassificationField(provider.fieldNameIndex("gid"))
newRend = QgsSingleSymbolRenderer(layer.geometryType())
newRend.addSymbol(symbol)
layer.setRenderer(newRend)
layer.triggerRepaint()


To be honest I was amazed that this worked. The reason for that is
that the class QgsSingleSymbolRenderer is supposed (as shown by the
online API docs) to have an updateSymbolAttributes() method. This
method is in fact mysteriously missing from the python bindings... I
don't know how but it seems there is some other method that updates
the symbols' properties and my code is somehow calling it. I guess its
the triggerRepaint() slot of QgsVectorLayer that originates this
updating of the symbols' properties...

I also didn't understand why it was needed to create a new
QgsSingleSymbolRenderer instead of just changing the old one, which
didn't work...

Can someone clarify this in a kind of a newbie-friendly explanation?
Thanks
