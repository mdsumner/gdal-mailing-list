Hi all,

I would like to know if it would be possible to fill some features already
in the changelog for 3.14?
or do we have to wait for a first automatic fill up from the PR list?

Cheers,
Denis

Let me do autofill first. It would be great if those interested will tag
any pr with a new feature as 'feature' so that when I harvest the entries
they all come through nicely.

Hi,

I've been toying around with QGIS Server Python plugins and it seems like `allowMethod` in QgsService does not get executed. A simple `git grep allowMethod` on the master branch shows few definitions but not sure if it's actually called from anywhere (maybe some external lib does actually invoke it, don't know)

Is this method actually used and how does it get called? Maybe it does work in C++, but not in Python?

Thank you,
Dražen

By the way I was intending to do the feature halves on the day after feature freeze (Time until freeze 2020-05-15 12:00:00 UTC 12d 20h 26m) - if that is ok. If you want to populate your own specific features in the meantime it is probably fine to do so - I have created the 3.14 version on the changelog site here:

https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.14/

Hi Dražen,

I think that you actually spotted an API leftover. I don't think that
that method is needed, the best place for all checks is probably
executeRequest where  the service/API can decide if a request is valid
according to its internal logic.

But of course if we want to keep it we should at least check for the
HTTP method before we accept the request.

Would you please file a ticket?.

Looks like it hasn't helped, and now the test fails all the time. I'm
blacklisting it for now because it's adding no value and no longer is
actually testing anything.

Would be great if one of the server team could look into this and fix
-- I suspect it's revealing a real memory corruption issue occurring
within the server code (and not just a test issue).

Hi Alessandro,

if `allowMethod` is simply going to be removed, QGIS-documentation has to be updated. I've created the issue https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/36163

If it's going to be removed I could probably create an PR for QGIS and QGIS-documetation :)

Hi Sachin,

You probably used different compile options and then it would be logical 
to me that the size of the exe is slightly different.

Why do you worry?

Hi,
qgis.exe and qgis-bin.exe are not the same beasts. Qgis.exe is a wrapper
for the real exe file, passing additional .var values to the exe.
IIRC it was done by Nathan to allow QGIS to be pinned in Windows taskbar
correctly.

Please correct me if I am wrong

The same thing just depends on the build options.  For the windows nightly
builds, you will end up with stuff like qgis-dev-bin.exe  and qgis-bin.exe
depending on what versions you have installed.  I started the work Jurgen
finished it off for me.

Like Andreas said the size difference is simply the different build
options, one thing different and it's going to be different.

The Could not load qgis_app.dll normally means it can't find something that
qgis_app.dll is needing to load, could be Qt, could be GDAL or anything
that is loaded really.  It's a tricky one to debug and I have never run the
package scripts for QGIS on Windows so can't help there sorry.

Did you meanwhile include the postinstall scripts to create the .env file on
install?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Google summer of code project - Improving QGIS 3D
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFcPqSQ+2RGEec8VJygO8Do5TF-=tmJZuJpO6WALHV41GA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am happy to announce that there will be a summer of code project
this year dedicated to improvements in QGIS 3D. Please join me in
welcoming Belgacem Nedjima to our community! I hope this will be yet
another successful project for QGIS :-)

Peter Petrik and myself will be serving as mentors for Belgacem, but I
am sure that other developers will be happy to help him whenever
needed.

Starting today we are entering community bonding period which will
last until the end of May - during this time students are expected to
familiarize themselves with the community and the development process
within the project. Then from the beginning of June until the end of
August students work on their projects.

If everything goes well, you can expect exciting new features in QGIS
3D, such as support for textured objects, export of data from QGIS 3D
scenes, directional lights and more 3D rendering techniques! The full
proposal is here:

Yay! Seems like just yesterday we were in Bucharest with me telling you how nice it would be to have my buildings in my models painted with nice textures … so at least one enthusiastic tester here waiting to cheer you on from the sidelines Belgacem. And thanks so much for mentoring him Peter and Martin!

Regards

Tim

Hi everyone,
I am Belgacem Nedjima and I will be working on improving QGIS 3D during
this year's summer of code project.
I am thrilled to become a part of this community and contribute to the QGIS
project.
Thank you all for welcoming me into the QGIS community and giving me such
an opportunity.
Best regards

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Request for comments: saving features with
 GENERATED columns on PostgreSQL 12+
Message-ID: <CAEvhHDnJd6pafyDKO1XqhuAprc9B1WDbBnu0TosCsd90sHEFHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I've just submitted a PR (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/35995) that
allows QGIS to manipulate features from PostgreSQL tables with GENERATED
columns. Those are a new feature introduced by PostgreSQL 12 (
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-generated-columns.html ), useful for
common vector operations such as storing areas or centroids of polygons
without having to resort to triggers - which have a performance impact on
their own.

Since GENERATED columns only work with PostgreSQL versions equal or newer
than 12, I've changed the script that populates the database with test data
(tests/testdata/provider/testdata_pg.sh) to check for the database version,
and only load 12+ data if the test server is running that version.

For the Python tests themselves, I've also add a query to check the server
version, and if it is older than 12, the tests are not run.

Since Travis currently uses PostgreSQL 11, those tests won't be run on the
CI environment, but they did pass on my local environment (PostgreSQL
12+Postgis 3.0.0+Python 3.8.2).

The changes in the source code themselves are actually simple, they follow
the same line as the handling of ordinary DEFAULT values, with the
difference that GENERATED columns cannot be overriden by the user as per
the PostgreSQL docs, so we enforce the use of the DEFAULT clause when QGIS
writes to the database.

Any thoughts? Reviewers?

Thank you all.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Geoserver WFS serves deformed data when store is
 4D (at least postgis and shp)
Message-ID: <1b967d98-8436-8869-0fa6-bf3602a17ac1@duif.net>

Hi devs,

In short: having a 4D (3D) coordinates vector store like shp or postgis,
Geoserver (Geotools?) uses the 3rd and 4th coordinate to create 2D
coordinates, giving rise to huge sliders (to zero) in this case...

Seemed easiest to create an issue,
so I could add some screenies and example data:

https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-9605

I know it is a data issue, but I think it would be better if this is
handled in a nicer way?

Also the discrepancy between WMS and WFS is confusing for users, in my
opinion.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Virtuel Fields are apparently stored as part of a
	style?
Message-ID: <1588681710311-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

I am working with virtual fields in Field Calculator as I need to have
columns updated based on data from a dbf file present in the project folder
whenever I open the project.

I have two different styles set up for the layer with virtual fields and
after having edited some of the formulas for the virtual fields I was very
puzzled on what was going on?

Until I realized that the formulas had only been changed for the style that
was used for showing the layer when I made the edits. For the other style
the formulas were not edited.

Is this intentional or an error?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Cannot restart jobs on travis
Message-ID: <aa15d58b-23bd-0396-bf46-12fabafb5d5b@opengis.ch>

Hi,

For some time now, I am no longer able to restart jobs on travis. I 
believe this was caused by some changes on their side, not exactly sure 
what.

We had the same for our own opengis.ch repos, and "fixed" it by 
migrating them to travis-ci.com (from travis-ci.org). This shouldn't be 
a big thing, apparently travis wants to move everyone there 
(https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-05-02-open-source-projects-on-travis-ci-com-with-github-apps).

I wonder if

- others can still restart jobs on travis?

- others have better ideas to "restore" the situation

- If someone should/could pull the trigger and migrate (here: 
https://travis-ci.com/organizations/qgis/migrate)


-- In an ideal world we would never have to restart any jobs, because 
they all run stable. Unfortunately we are not there yet. Meanwhile I'll 
just continue to restart failing jobs manually. If I can. --

Matthias

I can - but things seem rather broken/fragile on Travis' side at the
moment. Matteo and I get stuck recently with the DataPlotly repo
refusing to "connect" to the Travis jobs, even though they still ran
on Travis. Then it randomly fixed itself again after a week or so.

> - If someone should/could pull the trigger and migrate (here:

I tried to do this for a plugin repo I manage, and just hit a bunch of
cryptic errors in the process. Apparently travis isn't ready for
non-paying repos to migrate yet -- that was their official response.

The repos we migrated are public, non-paying ones.

We migrated a month ago (Beginning of April). They announced it as beta. 
But it has been at least as stable in this month as the .org one for us.

I am in the same situation as you are - I used to be able to restart
jobs, but more recently I am unable to do that anymore...

Message-ID: <CAGKduJ3ZDWfakQA5s-eRipbt+DiG4BVNmwxY=vMK34QWtzSZ0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

In my organization we have machines with obsolete OpenCL.DLL in their
\windows\system32 (they have 1.x version, while QGIS needs at least 2.x).

The solution is to restore the OpenCL.dll into %OSGEO_ROOT%\bin from the
QIGS standalone installation package, that is removed by the setup
installer after checking the existence of C:\windows\system32\opencl.dll.

The problem is that with that obsolete version QGIS refuses to start with
this error:

Unable to find the entry point. clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties from
OpenCL.dll library

QGIS-Devs

I'm forwarding this thread from QGIS-users mailinglist to this list.

This is about a crash report (aka severe bug but also a show stopper)
regarding GeoPackage - even read-only.

Goal should IMHO be that 1. QGIS does not crash, 2. QGIS supports
read-only multi-user access, and 3. QGIS prevents users to open
GeoPackage as write access unless it's sure the resource is locked.

I did not find any open issue on this topic except [1] and [2] which
are from 2017 and 2018. But perhaps I'm missing something.

=> Is there any dev working on this long known and outstanding issue?

Hi Stefan,

Thanks for the forward.

We are definitely aware of these issues and you can expect further 
discussion on the QGIS and GDAL developer lists in the near future. 
Several key QGIS users already identified this as a major hurdle when 
migrating data from Shp to gpkg.

Hopefully a good solution can be found.

Andreas

Hi,
Thanks to everyone for solution.

I had compiled using QGIS version 3.10.5 using 'package.cmd' on MSVC 2015
and successfully created *QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.10.5-1-Setup-x86_64.exe* using
creatensis.pl.
Till here it correct, above underline version comes from
C:\xxxx\QGIS-release-3_10\CMakeLists.txt. After installation I get a folder
QGIS 3.10 at desktop contains files:
1. QGIS Desktop 3.12.2 with GRASS 7.8.2
2. QGIS Desktop 3.12.2
3. Qt Designer with QGIS 3.12.2 custom widgets
4. SAGA GIS (2.3.2)
5. OSGeo4W Shell

Why this " QGIS Desktop 3.12.2 " comes here instead of " QGIS Desktop
3.10.5 ". Unable to trace this.
Please suggest solution to this.

Regards

You didn't package your build, but the regular default, which is qgis-full,
which is currently 3.12.

Extract your packages to addons and exclude those packages when calling
calling creatensis.pl (ie. qgis-full qgis- qgis-common- …)

We did some tests with Nyall and it seems that it's related to 
permissions on github, where at least "maintainer" permissions are required.

With this rectified, I don't see a reason any more to switch to 
github-ci.com for now.

I asked for a permission change for you too.

Great, thanks for looking into that! I can see that Restart build
button appears for me again on travis.

Hi Matthias,

I don't see the restart button. Probably because I'm not a maintainer.

I was able to trigger another build with:

git commit --amend --no-edit
git push -f

This doesn't change anything, so it looks like a good workaround for
contributors with maintainer privileges.

Regards,

Jorge

Yes, that works as well.

Or simply closing/reopening the pull request also works (in 90% of the 
cases, i.e. only when a commit has been done on master in between).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] icons for temporal controller
Message-ID: <106e196a-2997-1580-1908-fef5eaf3e75f@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

/me playing here with Temporal Controller for vector data (THANKS
NYALL!!) super cool.

One thing... I click the wrong buttons everytime :-)

There is a << button, to rewind to start
And a |< button, to go back one frame

But my intuition is to see those the other way around...
The little vertical symbol to me is an 'end' or 'start' symbol..

Googling "icon next frame" and "icon rewind to start" was not very
conclusive...

So: just wondering what others intuition tell them?
Sometimes by brain is not working as other people's :-)

For reference I add a small screenie

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GeoPackage - where are we -where do we go
Message-ID: <4432048f-efef-5d9c-51cc-7a50af2ab443@opengis.ch>

Hi list,

I wondered about the state of GeoPackage. Personally, cince it has been 
introduced to qgis and evenmore since it has been selected as the 
default format, I have never grown to fully and completely.

I do not want to trigger a evangelical discussion here. I'd like to see 
where we are and what we can reasonably do to have a default file format 
which can be recommended with no bad feelings.


Here follow a couple of observations over the years, some of them 
properties of the specs I believe:


* The fid requirement

   I sometimes want my features to be identified by uuids or others. 
They also tend to accumulate if derived datasets are created (through 
processing etc). If I need some pseudo stable primary key there is a 
rowid builtin into sqlite, we don't need a second one.

   Possible mitigation: alter the ogr implementation. possibly alter the 
standard (required?)

* The modification on r/o open

   Has caused too much pain on git.

   Possible mitigation: a) switch to journal mode=delete (not an easy 
option because of https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15351) b) only switch 
to wal mode when layers are put into edit mode (I have strong doubts 
this is a safe thing to do)

* The network share freeze

   Our default file should play nicely with (windows) network shares. 
It's clear to everyone that we can't expect concurrent writes. But it 
should "just work" for concurrent read by many.

   Possible mitigation: switch to journal mode=delete for network shares 
(we are looking into this)

* The wal file appearing next to the file

   It is confusing to newcomers and looks almost like a sidecar file. I 
would care less if it was put into some system cache folder instead of 
just into my data folder. Or at least if it was a hidden file.

   Possible mitigation: switch to journal mode=delete (not an easy 
option because of https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15351)

* The couple of corrupted files I have received over the years which 
could only be repaired by a command line "dump contents as sql and 
execute into new file"

   I have not found a way to reproduce this. Some of them were produced 
by older qgis versions making it easy to violate foreign key constraints 
and hard to recover. This has been fixed.

   Possible mitigation: offer a "repair" option in qgis. Through 
processing or "on the fly" upon detection.

*Default value magic replace values on insert (with no possibility to 
pre-evaluate them)

   E.g. a global sequence like on postgres would be nice. Can be worked 
around through default values in qgis though.

   Possible mitigation: a)add it as a feature to sqlite. b) use qgis 
default values. c) live with it.

*The requirement for a single geometry column per table

   I just don't see a good reason to forbid that

   Possible mitigation: a) alter the standard. b) ignore the standard 
and patch the ogr implementation.


I wonder how others feel about these topics.


- Are there more pain points I forgot to list?

- Do you see more approaches to mitigate these problems?

- Is someone already working on these issues?


It would be great to have a standard file format that we can fully 
trust. Let's make a reality check if GeoPackage can be this format.

Best regards

Hi Matthias,

May I add another pain here?

Storing gpkg in the cloud means syncing even after the file was only opened
in QGIS and nothing has changed inside - it was only opened to view
something.
On very large gpkg files this is also not really nice.
(Maybe I am just using gpkg wrong, but at least this happens on my
installation)

regards
Werner

Hi MAtthias,
thanks for this very good review. Agreed on all points. As Werner
mentioned, the issue also impacts on incremental backups, causing lots
of wasted disk space.
Cheers.

Thanks for starting this discussions, we clearly need a path forward.

I just added a note on one of the topics (and cut the rest):

If I'm not mistaken, the fix was to disable foreign key constraints
altogether for the whole QGIS application for all GPKGs, no questions asked.

This was IMHO a bad decision because it may turn a correct GPKG into a
corrupted GPKG.

A better approach in case of corrupted files would have probably been to
disable foreign constraints only in case a file is corrupted and restore
the constraints after the file has been repaired or, as you already
mentioned to offer an automatic or semi-automatic repair function.


Kind regards.

Hi Matthias,

Thank you for listing all the open issues/problem with gpkg that you 
know of. It really helps.

If we don't like gpkg as default format - the question is: what is the 
alternative?

a) stay with ESRI shapefile (I think noone would like this)
b) work with the SQLite, gpkg/OGC community to fix the gpkg issues (my 
preference)
c) use ESRI FGDB format (then we are at the mercy of ESRI)
d) invent something new (risky, if only QGIS uses that, interoperability 
would suck)

I would prefer option b) a lot, and if that is not feasible, then maybe 
d). d) will also be risky.

a) would equally suck as the current state of gpkg - I've seen far too 
many corrupt shape files, people complaining about interoperability 
issues (ArcGIS would show features that had been deleted in QGIS, ) and 
I don't need to repeat the list of the numerous restrictions of ESRI shp 
format.

In some cases you may be able to work around this by using geodiff from our fine friends over at Lutra. It will let you extract just the changes (if you have the original and the changed copy locally), then upload them to the server.

I think the main issue here is that we expose the FID as a normal column in QGIS. This is a 
QGIS only behaviour, that could be easily removed.
Keeping a integer primary key column is indeed a requirement of the standard, and can be 
useful in circumstances where you run VACUUM on the DB, which would alter rowid in case of 
deleted features and possibly confuse QGIS identification by feature it if that happened after 
a layer has been loaded (but that's a bit of a edge scenario).

That should be investigated/tested, but indeed it's not compleletely obvious that a 
connection that has been opened in the default journal mode=delete will "see" that it has 
been turned to WAL by another. I believe I looked in the SQLite doc about that scenario, but 
didn't find anything.

I don't think journal mode=delete wil prevent SQLite3 from creating locks (or trying to do), to 
detect potential writes. I'm not sure if that can result in deadlock scenarios if they are 
network issues. One possibility to avoid all (deal)lock issues is to use the 
SQLITE_USE_OGR_VFS=YES env variable that will use GDAL I/O layer instead of SQLite3 built-
in one. The side effect of this is that as GDAL I/O layer doesn't implement locking, no locking 
attempt is done. So it has been obvserved in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/
27899#issuecomment-535413602 that it actually resulted in speedups.
Alternate implementation with identical effects&drawbacks: use the SQLite3 uri syntax with 
the immutable=1 or nolock=1. See https://www.sqlite.org/uri.html 

Of course, in such case, edits should be disabled, or enabled only with a big big red warning, 
since database corruption would occur for sure if 2 people tried to edit the DB 
simulatenously. I also thing that in a scenario 1 writer, other readers, the readers could 
possibly see inconsistant/broken state in a transient way. That could actually arise if there's a 
single machine editing & viewing the database, for example if a rendering thread reads 
during the time the DB is written.
(but the same could probably seen with some editing scenarios on shapefiles)

By overriding sqlite3 I/O callback, I'm wondering if we couldn't move the .wal file somewhere 
else in the filesystem (of course that would only work for OGR enabled consumer, but 
probably good enough). That said, the modification of the first 16 bytes of the main .gpkg 
file, which cause issue for file synchronization, would remain, as it is a design constraint of 
WAL.

> option because of https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15351)

I was wondering if we could consult the SQLite3 main author (http://www.hwaci.com/drh/) 
on all those locking and concurrency issues, as he has probably experience with similar 
scenarios.

I don't think the Geopackage OGC SWG would be keen to change that. I believe I floated the 
idea around a few years ago, but they wanted GeoPackage core to remain simple and adding 
multiple geometry columns goes against that.
That said, GeoPackage has an extension mechanism, and it would be possible on the OGR 
side to define one to flag tables with multiple geometry columns as extended (I've just 
verified for exemple that the definition of the gpkg_geometry_columns system table has a 
unique constraint on the tuple (table_name, column_name), and not just table_name, so this 
is a provision for that extension). The OGR Spatialite driver handles several geometry 
columns fine, no reason this couldn't be done on GPKG side too.

The old situation was: it's possible to change a value without checks. 
It's not allowed to open a broken gpkg. I.e. easy to break, impossible 
to recover.

The new situation is: It's possible to open a broken gpkg, so it's 
possible to recover).

There may be space for further improvements on the "editing" side. This 
needs to be carefully tested (i.e. make sure it plays well with deferred 
checks, like on postgres, and incomplete transactions are fully rolled 
back without entering into a broken state of gpkg again).

Bests

Hi Andreas

Thanks for also pointing out this question. I would like to completely 
focus on b) for now to not disperse the discussion too much.

If it comes down to unresolvable problems we can still go for d).

But let's keep that for later.

Thanks for mentioning that. This might indeed be good for very 
controlled environments but adds quite a bit of additional requirements 
on logic and services. In those cases you are often better off setting 
up a postgres database directly.

In this thread, let's focus on "how to get things to work properly for 
our standard geo container file."

Can we still turn this road now?

Many will meanwhile depend on this behavior (it's not always bad). So if 
we treat it as a system attribute and hide it away on provider level we 
risk breaking workflows. Also I'm unsure about further processing, do we 
remove these columns from resulting files or not?

Also, will it then be possible to add another "user id column" with 
autoincrement (I couldn't get sqlite to create a second autoincrement 
coolumn here in a quick test).

Maybe we need a gpkg extension "fid_is_visible" to make this cleaner? or 
allow creation of gpkgs out of spec?

I think we can accept these constraints. It's our job to do our best to 
prevent users to shoot themselves in their foot. But not at the expense 
of preventing valid use cases.

I.e. it should be clear to everyone that a file based format is meant 
for single write access only. As you said, it's probably the case with 
shapefiles as well (hmm, I wanted to keep them out of this discussion) 
and the limitation is obvious to most of us.

I'm sure we are not the first ones to hit this. And having someone with 
experience and deeper understanding involved sounds very good.

Does someone have a contact there?

(I also noted the sqlite consortium, but the pricing there sounds like 
it's out of league for the qgis project.)

Good to know we have a possibility her. I have also heard similar 
desires from other software manufacturers, I guess this extension will 
be implemented in a couple of applications.

Two downsides of GPKG, which I've experienced with many users, who
worked with Shapefiles in the past:

1. A GPKG can contain multiple layers, but has one filename only. This
confuses many users. They're expecting single files, like
"houses_poly.gpkg" and "houses_point.gpkg". When they only see
"houses.gpkg", they think they're missing anything. From the normal
Windows Explorer (don't know about Nautilus etc.), you also cannot watch
inside the GPKG file to check its content. It would be nice to make
Windows parse GPKG's/sqlite3's metadata.

2. As pointed out in the past, a big downside of GPKG or sqlite3 is the
huge bloat. I often have single table GPKGs, which are 12 GiB. When
compressing them with zstd, I can get it down to 3 GiB or even less in
about no time.

VACUUM doesn't help here and isn't reachable easily using a button in
QGIS. Seems like there's much empty space in the db scheme. Perhaps
anyone can explain this?

So I think you are right, the buttons should be swapped:

The icons themselves show this - |< == go back to start

You can right-click on the gpkg file in the file browser panel and you can
see the `Compact Database (VACUUM)`.

Hi Ismail,

thanks for the hint, but I've disabled QGIS' file browser in our
environment (research department of University) and at home. Let me
explain the reason:

QGIS' file browser by default tries to scan ZIP files and other (big)
files. This had an noticeable effect on our network traffic and the
client performance. Via VPN (home office right now) this effect got even
worse, since the VPN performance is degraded, too. Also, we had some
crashes on student laptops while scanning many shapefiles in a
directory. I'm very afraid that someone will try a VACUUM over the
network (or over the VPN).

Our users normally browse the directory by Windows Explorer, drag & drop
the file into QGIS or copy it to the local system first. This also has
to do with GPKG's bad network performance.

Best regards,
Tobias

Please don't forget about Björn's FlatGeobuf:
https://bjornharrtell.github.io/flatgeobuf/

Since I'm not a fan of the bloat sqlite3 has, FlatGeobuf is in heavily
use on my systems.

Hi Richard,

Yes we definitely need to have commonly used  icons in this scenario.

The way we thought about this is |< and >| icons would mean "rewind one step
then pause and play forward one step then pause, respectively".

I think the improvement should be on the << and >> icons changed to |<< and
>>| meaning "rewind to start then pause and skip to end then pause,
respectively".

Some little explanation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_control_symbols


Best,

Samweli

Could the upstream action be configured NOT to even try to run

To me, this is not a downside, but a big, big plus! Fewer mess on the 
file system.

And it is the whole point  of a Geopackage, to package many data sets 
into one file, so it can be easily shared.

I  think we should concentrate in this discussion on the real technical 
issues, and not on philosophical differences or different workflows, 
which certainly have their pros and cons.

If you want to discuss this, please open a separate thread on it.

Thanks,

Andreas

Hi all,

Interesting discussion!

Standard does not care (and should not care to great extent) about use
cases. Creating revisions and incremental changelogs is a common use case
(unless you work with
my-spatial_data_v010_final_draft_final_002_really-final_005.gpkg :) ), you
have those common use cases.

Providing a tool similar to geodiff or Detect dataset changes
algorithms can help users to overcome the limitation of standards...

Regards
Saber

Did so in the past, that's why I'm using FlatGeobuf. But I'm quiet now.

You can also have multiple sheets in an excel file. I normally don't. 
But as long as this doesn't get into my way, I don't mind.

Flatgeobuf is indeed a very nice concept. For my understanding it has 
one design decision which makes it unusable as everyday default file 
format (unless I'm missing a point)

Thanks for raising this Matthias! But I think we should not try to
create a silver bullet here. One should use gpkg where it fit's (and
that is apparently NOT in networked environment, that is where db's are
a better fit?).

About Tobias' flatgeobuf: instead of a shp/gpkg file alternative, would
this not be a very good candidate to store our intermediate processing
steps in (which was shp, not shure what it is now?)?

May I second the above mentioned good thing about gpkg: that you can
have more (related) sets of data in one file, that you can create joins
in these to create views, that you can save styles and projects in it
etc etc

The fact at most people use some programs/formats to do things they
equally can do with a txt/csv file does not make a more advanced format
a bad format :-)

Today I actually hit an issue in which selection first seem not to work:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/36291
from which my conclusion is: views are cool but be careful with primary
keys!

So in the case of gpkg we should probably have a dialog like we have for
Postgis/Oracle in which you can define a Primary Key, etc etc?

Which brings me to: we should handle gpkg as actual databases and not as
simple files? Maybe we/ogc are actually trying to mixup concepts:
databases vs simple files?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Actually that might be just my past reading of the below blog post that Jeff Yutzler, the 
editor of the spec just reminded me about:

http://geopackage.blogspot.com/2015/10/one-geometry-per-table.html

The link to the modeling guidelines in this post is now dead. They are at:

I've been a part of the FreeCAD project for the last three years or so,
focusing on developing Civil Engineering-related functions (specifically,
transportation engineering).  On occasion, discussions emerge regarding GIS
integration into FreeCAD, QGIS being the natural go-to.

Recently, the GIS thread on the FreeCAD forum pointed to a github issue on
the QGIS repo about FreeCAD integration.  It was closed in late April,
citing the developer's mailing list as the place to continue the discussion.

I cite the URL below as it contains links to relevant threads on the
FreeCAD forum:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/21623

The issue was five years old and not much discussion has happened.
Admittedly, I think it's one of those "seems like a good idea, but what can
we really do with it?" kind of things.

I'm not really posting here to start a discussion on any particular topic
or advocate for any sort of development effort.  I'm merely bringing it to
the developer mailing list to give it the proper exposure.

That said, I should also mention that I and one other transportation
engineering professional are actively working on developing transportation
engineering tools for FreeCAD, specifically geomatic (survey) and highway
alignment design tools at the moment.

Good shout!

I would love to see someone systematically test it with processing.

Not sure this makes much sense. Now Processing stores temporary
results as memory layers and uses .shp/.geopackage as intermediate
format because these formats are compatible with wast majority of 3rd
party tools.

If we will use flatgeobuf, we will need convert back and forth all the time
when 3rd party tools are involved, this may significantly increase processing
time. Also as flatgeobuf does not provide random write capability it can be
slow in some cases.

I'd suggest we shelve this discussion and revisit in ~12 months. While
I'm excited by the potential of flatgeobuf, I think any widespread use
of it right now would be premature. I'd rather see it stabilise and
mature before we start recommending it for use by end users
(implicitly or otherwise).

As long as you have enough memory, that's a good approach. When your 
system starts paging, you better have a backup plan.

I dare to guess that those flexible enough to have picked up geopackage 
in the last years are likely to pickup flatgeobuf in the near future too.

In which cases does processing do random writes? I think in most cases 
it streams data from/to feature sources or to feature sinks.

Hi Matthias,

In some cases it does random edits, for example in some in-place
editing workflows.

Right. But in those we don't use a temporary storage, so that's a 
completely different code path?

A few insights of the GDAL implementation (CC'ing Björn):
- the default behaviour is to generate a flatgeobuf file with the spatial index
- to do so, a temporary file is created with the features serialized as soon as they are passed 
to GDAL
- the bounding box of each feature is added in a in-memory vector (40 bytes / feature)
- this vector is sorted with the Packed Hilbert R-Tree sorting order
- the final FlatGeobuf file is written with the features also sorted accordingly (doesn't require 
bring them all into memory, so not an issue)

One potential issue could be for huge files (> tens of millions of features), where the size of 
the vector storing the bounding box could become significant (10 millions features = 400 
MB), especially on 32 bit processes.

So probably not going to be a limitation for common usage (and someone really eager to 
limit the RAM usage could probably use a merge sort, with the array split into sub ones, 
stored onto several files on disk, and bringing into RAM only chunks for final sorting. That 
would be fun to write !!!)

If not writing a spatial index, the writing is done in a streaming way in the final file, without 
storing in RAM the bounding box of each feature.

Hi Folks

Just a reminder / request: 3.14 is going into freeze in 5 days. When freeze starts we are going to use the new automatic harvesting logic in the changelog platform to fetch all the PR titles and descriptions from the PR queue. If you want your work to be included in the visual changelog please do:


1. Label your PR with the ‘Feature’ tag.


2. Ensure you have a nice clear description in the PR.

3. Wait for the Release freeze and I will harvest the new entries

4. Go to the changelog site (https://changelog.qgis.org) and check that the content generated for your shiney new feature looks nice.

Regards

Tim

Hi Joel

Since years ago a lot of new features can support a better integration. I
did a rough investigation about integration and stopped due to the fact
that data model were (or is) too different to imagine an integration.
BTW probably now is more simple (at least from the qgis point of view)
thanks to the possibility to bridge different data models using a python
data provider [1] [2].
I would give a try/look.

cheers

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] A toast to our community
Message-ID: <7ec870ec-35c0-fdb5-3090-ee86728d5005@qgis.org>

Dear community,


First of all, I would like to thank Paolo for his work during the last
two years as Chair and for the years before that, and years to come in
his role as PSC member. I’m looking forward to keeping up the good work
with him.


Secondly, I would like to thank all the community voting members for all
the great inputs during the discussion phase of the AGM and for the
fantastic participation in the voting process where we had more than an
80% turnout.


It is a pleasure to see that besides approving the more formal points
(annual report, financial report, budget and auditors), the AGM approved
all matters arising:


  *

    We now have two new honourable voting members: Harrissou Sant-anna
    and Nyall Dawson. Honourable members are specially designated voting
    members, whose position does not need to be affiliated with a
    country user group. Congratulations, and thank you, you are both
    such an inspiring example to our community!

  *

    Many QGIS users and contributors are geoscientists or geoinformatics
    specialists. As such, we need to act responsibly and serve as role
    models. Thanks to the approval of our new environmental policy,
    QGIS.ORG and the QGIS community committed ourselves to act
    responsibly regarding our actions and activities where it has any
    relevant influence on the environment. This will mainly affect our
    server infrastructure and our physical contributor meetings. The
    complete policy can be found in appendix 1 of our AGM minutes or on
    our website [1].


Beyond thanking Paolo as outgoing chair, I’d especially like to thank
Tim, Andreas, Anita and Jürgen for the great work they are doing in the
PSC and in general the incredible drive they have in helping to make
QGIS thrive. I’m sure that with the help of our new Vice-Chair
Alessandro Pasotti we’ll be able to take QGIS to even greater heights.
Welcome, Alessandro!


Last, but definitely not least, I’d like to thank every single member of
this amazing community for all your help documenting, coding,
translating, testing, designing, teaching, supporting and in general
spreading the QGIS love.


I never thought, when I first started using QGIS 0.6 in 2005 that 15
years later I would be given the honour of becoming the official face of
such an amazing heart.


Have a great week, rock on QGIS!


Marco Bernasocchi

Incoming Chair of the QGIS.ORG Board

Hi Joel,

Just a note on the QGIS-CAD-BIM "converging" roadmap everyone dreams about.
What we see here is that many organisation up to now where using CAD
software to manage city maps and assets management, where GIS - as a true
database system - is far more accurate.
We even see public entity allowing public grant only if data are
transmitted in GIS exchange format in the end. So we see many CAD users
switching to GIS - wether they like it or not.

As a consequence, and thanks to funders who understand that free software
allows to be active contributors, QGIS as a project is influenced a lot by
CAD needs, at least for 2D editing.
We have some construction tools allowing to play with angles, parallels,
build some inference temporary lines, and a lot of new shape editing tools.
We still miss a lot of what user require, such as interactive snapping for
instance or advanced 3D computation libraries. We also reach a point where
geospatial standards draw a line with CAD world, for instance handling
spline curves is at the limits.

Concerning 3D and BIM buzz, we have a lot of questions from users, and
sometimes even from national mapping agencies. And up to now, 3D plans for
QGIS are focused on viewing datasets mainly.
We miss a lot 3D editing capabilities and FreeCAD is in my opinion the best
candidate to provide an open source solution for this.

The first bridge would be to ensure that FreeCAD deals with the main
interchange standards to be able to edit BIM data. That would probably be
cityGML and all the standards supported by the OGC, plus the main de facto
standards like STL. I think we already have a challenge here to deals with
those large datasets in reading and editing.

FreeCad being able to edit those, we could already answer to the 100% open
source BIM use case. Then an interoperability at API level between FreeCad
and QGIS to easily open a dataset or a specific feature in QGIS<>Freecad
would rock!
I would love as a user be able to view my city in 2D or 3D with QGIS, click
on a building, open it in FreeCAD, update it, go back to QGIS, refresh,
done.

Hope it helps

Best regards

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] The curious case of GeoPackage on exFAT
Message-ID: <dff03255-2f20-d875-5474-15485b099714@gmail.com>

Hi all -

I have a strange problem. I'm have 3 different disk on my windows based 
system on Mac hardware

 1. My system drive. Formatted to NTFS.
 2. A flash-drive. Formatted to FAT32.
 3. A data drive. Formatted to exFAT. The last is my primary data drive
    and is shared between my Windows partition and my Mac partition on
    my MacBook Pro. Hence the use of exFAT.

I have a QGIS plugin, which copies a template of a GeoPackage file to 
"where-ever the user wants it placed" and afterward make some content 
changes in the copy using the PyQT QSQL module with the QSPATIALITE driver

This work if the Geopackage  file is copied to either disk no 1 (NTFS) 
or disk no 2 (FAT32). However, it doesn't work if the file is copied to 
disk no 3 (exFAT). The process leaves the WAL files even after the 
database is closed properly.

And even more strange: If I reformat the flash-drive to exFAT and repeat 
the experiment using the reformatted drive it too works without a hitch.

The normal "divide et impera" method tells me that my exFat data disk is 
bork'ed. However this error *only* occurs with the QGIS/GeoPackage 
creation/modification scenario. Everything else is working OK.

The disk is not shared on the network. Has anyone experienced the same 
type of problems ? And have a solution ?? Just asking before I begin to 
clean up / reformat my 100 GB data disk

System setup: MacBook Pro 2014 / Windows 8.1 OS /QGIS 3.10.5 (the same 
problem occurs with 3.10.0 , 3.10.2 ...3.12.2)

Regis,

This is probably one of the more common use cases that comes up on the
FreeCAD side when GIS integrations are discussed.  There has been some
effort in the past in this regard.  One forum member, microelly, is very
much interested in this topic and has made efforts to build geospatial
support into FreeCAD.  His work has been merged into our "geomatics"
workbench more recently.

As for BIM support, one of our lead developers, yorik, is an architect by
trade and has worked on BIM support at least at the architectural level.
That, I'm sure, provides a suitable beginning point for a larger scale
application of BIM.

Much of this is beyond my scope of work, but I'm always interested in
seeing something happen.  Perhaps if we can establish a use case or propose
a basic, functional integration, it may make it easier to get something
done.

In all honesty, I don't use FreeCAD in the way that it's typically
intended. :)  I'm not the most experienced at seeing the issues in the
integration, so I can't easily predict the complications...

Hi Joel, 

 

Just a note on the QGIS-CAD-BIM "converging" roadmap everyone dreams about. 

What we see here is that many organisation up to now where using CAD software to manage city maps and assets management, where GIS - as a true database system - is far more accurate. 

We even see public entity allowing public grant only if data are transmitted in GIS exchange format in the end. So we see many CAD users switching to GIS - wether they like it or not. 

 

As a consequence, and thanks to funders who understand that free software allows to be active contributors, QGIS as a project is influenced a lot by CAD needs, at least for 2D editing.

We have some construction tools allowing to play with angles, parallels, build some inference temporary lines, and a lot of new shape editing tools. 

We still miss a lot of what user require, such as interactive snapping for instance or advanced 3D computation libraries. We also reach a point where geospatial standards draw a line with CAD world, for instance handling spline curves is at the limits. 

 

Concerning 3D and BIM buzz, we have a lot of questions from users, and sometimes even from national mapping agencies. And up to now, 3D plans for QGIS are focused on viewing datasets mainly.

We miss a lot 3D editing capabilities and FreeCAD is in my opinion the best candidate to provide an open source solution for this. 

 

The first bridge would be to ensure that FreeCAD deals with the main interchange standards to be able to edit BIM data. That would probably be cityGML and all the standards supported by the OGC, plus the main de facto standards like STL. I think we already have a challenge here to deals with those large datasets in reading and editing.  

 

FreeCad being able to edit those, we could already answer to the 100% open source BIM use case. Then an interoperability at API level between FreeCad and QGIS to easily open a dataset or a specific feature in QGIS<>Freecad would rock!

I would love as a user be able to view my city in 2D or 3D with QGIS, click on a building, open it in FreeCAD, update it, go back to QGIS, refresh, done.

 

Hope it helps

 

Best regards

Hi Joel

 

Since years ago a lot of new features can support a better integration. I did a rough investigation about integration and stopped due to the fact that data model were (or is) too different to imagine an integration.
BTW probably now is more simple (at least from the qgis point of view) thanks to the possibility to bridge different data models using a python data provider [1] [2].

I would give a try/look.

 

cheers

I've been a part of the FreeCAD project for the last three years or so, focusing on developing Civil Engineering-related functions (specifically, transportation engineering).  On occasion, discussions emerge regarding GIS integration into FreeCAD, QGIS being the natural go-to.

Recently, the GIS thread on the FreeCAD forum pointed to a github issue on the QGIS repo about FreeCAD integration.  It was closed in late April, citing the developer's mailing list as the place to continue the discussion.

I cite the URL below as it contains links to relevant threads on the FreeCAD forum:

The issue was five years old and not much discussion has happened.  Admittedly, I think it's one of those "seems like a good idea, but what can we really do with it?" kind of things.

I'm not really posting here to start a discussion on any particular topic or advocate for any sort of development effort.  I'm merely bringing it to the developer mailing list to give it the proper exposure.

That said, I should also mention that I and one other transportation engineering professional are actively working on developing transportation engineering tools for FreeCAD, specifically geomatic (survey) and highway alignment design tools at the moment.

Hi Samweli,

Sorry for my late reply. So after seeing your wikipedia page it looks
correct what we have now... So maybe leave it as is.. I have to
reconnect some wires in my head I think :-)

I like your refinement though. I think adding the | tot the go to
start/end would help (me at least)

Thanks & Regards,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Iterate over layer features in a model -
	get_feature_by_id
Message-ID: <CAMCJChvzaHj3wJbS9J47iAeisd65Ths0NSN6DoGqsh4mmGokCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm creating a Model to use with r.viewshed from GRASS, just to avoid the
manual introduction of the coordinates parameter.

https://grass.osgeo.org/grass78/manuals/r.viewshed.html

So, to get the coordinates from a points layer with just one point
(viewpoint), I can get the coordinates with this expression (input layer
has already etrs89_x and etrs89_y as coordinates fields):

concat(attributes( get_feature_by_id(@viewpoints, 0))['etrs89_x'], ',',
attributes( get_feature_by_id(@viewpoints, 0))['etrs89_y'])

This works good:
r.viewshed input=rast_5eb9d9fb8f9a633 *coordinates=88260.003,118942.526*
observer_elevation=1.6 target_elevation=10 max_distance=5000
refraction_coeff=0.14286 memory=1000 -c -r -b
output=output8e7ee6e47dcb4d4fb287eb65c9698cad --overwrite


However, I was trying to give a more generic use to the model, and so I
added the 'Add geometry attributes' algorithm to it. With this, I cannot
get the coordinates anymore with the expression:

concat(attributes( get_feature_by_id(@Add_geometry_attributes_OUTPUT,
0))['xcoord'], ',', attributes(
get_feature_by_id(@Add_geometry_attributes_OUTPUT, 0))['ycoord'])

r.viewshed input=rast_5eb9dac74eca034 *coordinates=0.0,0.0*
observer_elevation=1.6 target_elevation=10 max_distance=5000
refraction_coeff=0.14286 memory=1000 -c -r -b
output=outputfb2e779533a541c4bbcf2bd6f7773eb1 --overwrite

They always pass as 0.0,0.0.

This can be due to the fact that the intermediate result of 'Add geometry
attributes' is a memory layer? Is there any possibility of doing this in
another way?


Another issue is when I have a points layer with several points
(viewpoints). In this case, I tried to use the 'Iterate over this layer'
option, but it always get 0.0,0.0 as coordinates. Of course I need some
incremental operator get_feature_by_id (I also do not know how yet), but it
should work at least to feature id 0, but it does not work. Running it
without the Iterate option, it work for the feature id 0.

Any hints about this?

Here is some sample dataset and the models (the one that is working and the
other that has the 'Add geometry attributes' algorithm and doest not work):

No -- it's a limitation in models, that expressions CANNOT access
layers which have been created during the model execution. Only layers
present in the project at the start of the model execution can
(currently) be utilised by expressions in a model.

The fix is not trivial -- e.g. for myself I'd budget about 3 days to fix this.

Message-ID: <CAJcxt0KMCZGZ_1ENA9TNv5eDNmCAvo_nQUqRtJe4d8qzsr8ArA@mail.gmail.com>

To whom It may concerns,

Hello, I'm having my End of Degree Project at the Politechnical University
of Valencia and I wanted to solve some doubts about the Isochrones that are
in ORS Tools. I want to calculate the isochrones for ambulances in Valencia
so I need to know the next questions:

1. When are the isochrones calculated by ORS Tools, what does it take into
account? The road traffic? The maximum speed (limit speed) on the road?
What things?

2. Depending on the time you calculate the isochrones, will it give you a
different result, or is it not in real time?

3. I've seen that exists one tool on qgis called iso4app that calculates
the isochrones too, but it calculates them in another way. What's the
difference within this two tools? What's better for my case (ambulances)?

My QGIS version is 3.10.5.

Thank you so much in advance.

Best regards,

Miguel Ángel

Hi Nyall,

Thank you very much for the clarification! It seems a must have for the
next crowdfunding round!

I believe that the issue is the same or similar with the Iterate over the
layer, right?

Thanks again Nyall!

	for 3.14?
Message-ID: <CAB28Asir7h+nvLhBAWqL0ZPYw=7D67UJ+wmmQbKWt=X8BCDxHg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Thanks to some funding from geoProRegio AG (www.geoproregio.ch), I've
recently had the opportunity to add support to QGIS labeling for
formatting label contents using HTML color, underline, strikethrough
and overline tags. See https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/36283 for
some pretty demo pictures of this in action!)

Partly, this work was intended to be a research project to determine
what further changes would be required to support a greater subset of
HTML tags (e.g. bold, italic, font size and family, super/subscript).
(These particular tags were initially selected because they do not
modify the shape or size of characters, which simplifies the text
layout calculations greatly!)

I'm now wondering if any organisation is interested in funding some of
these additional formatting tags, such as bold and italic. If you're
interested (and would like to see these supported in 3.14), please get
in contact with me ASAP. Feature freeze hits this week, so we'd need
to move quickly...

Cheers,
Nyall

Hi Alexandre,

I agree with your words, but this media-model does not fully map to the
timemanager model OR it kind of does and then the icons fit:

'>|' now IS go to next video/chapter (in anology of a time step to a
song/chapter'.

If you want  |< and >| as "go to start or full end",
you only have << and >> as "do one time step", so this does in my view
not fit the 'fast forward/backward' analogy from media.

That is why I think Samweli's proposal to add a pipe-symbol ('|') to the
fastforward to end and start: '<<' and '>>' as a best fitting proposal:
'|<<' and '>>|'.

Richard

Dear Miguel

For your ORS questions, you are probably going to get more useful advice by speaking to the ORS developers. I will put you in touch with someone I know from the ORS project to see if she can point you in the right direction. (Separate private email)

Regards

Tim

An alternative might be <| and |> which sometimes takes a next/previous
frame role in vid editing/playing software.

Does some some general UI inconsistency on this, blender for instance uses
|< & >| as move to start/endpoints but I'm sure I've seen it as other uses
elsewhere.

regards,

James

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Appending Features to a layer
Message-ID: <CAPqby8kt+v2mY_wWrTVgT--iscZF7To9bqmV7wnD7q=n2OHXzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm seeking a way to append features to a layer when exporting into a
PostGIS layer.

For now I'm using the tool QgsVectorLayerExporter.

I'm doing something like this

QgsVectorLayerExporter(uri, "postgres", fields, layer.wkbType(),
utils().crs, overwrite,{}).addFeatures([feat for feat in
layer.getFeatures()])

Inside the curly brackets I know I can place the options, but I can't find
where are these options documented. Or wether these options can help me in
my task of append features to a QGIS layer.

Can anyone point me in the right direction in this task of appending
features?

Kind regards.

Hola Luís,

The options are quite simple. You can see them in this SO question:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/87404/how-to-write-a-new-layer-to-postgresql-from-qgis-plugin/360270#360270

You should create a temporary layer with the original one, plus the
features you want to append. Then you write it to the database.

Does it help?

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Hi Luis,

if you are fine with a plugin solution, then there is one called "Append
Features to Layer" [1] that adds a new algorithm to QGIS Processing.

If you run it once via Processing Toolbox, then in the Processing History
you'll get the Python command, which you could use in your code to append
features to layers.


BTW, QGIS Processing will come with an append features to existing layer
out-of-the-box. It's planned for QGIS 3.14. See it in action [2].


Regards,

Germán

The GDAL export o postgreSQL tools in processing allows you to append
features to an existing layer. Disable the overwrite option, and enable the
append option.

https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/gdal/vectormiscellaneous.html#export-to-postgresql-available-connections
.

If needed in a script, you can call that algorithm too. No need to reinvent
anything.

Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] crossing the antimeridian
Message-ID: <CAKuFJPo2p8avZCSRRg4yiAuxyT24tp=Jo4qKXTS9q=U75pDJmA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I have a question about the QGIS algorithm to calculate the lines that
cross the antimeridian.
Looking at the code I see that it uses the value 120 or -120 to know if
we're going west or the east.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/cdc9a841c9caf308d24448597dfa8a2aea48fac3/src/core/qgsdistancearea.cpp#L464

 I think this algorithm is based on qgis-shapetools-plugin which also uses
that value.

https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/qgis-shapetools-plugin/blob/master/utils.py#L43

My question is, why 120 degrees? Why is that value used and not another one
like 170 for example?
Is this algorithm based on any paper? Is there any documentation?
On the other hand, is there any paper, or implementation to calculate the
lines that cross the poles?

thanks and regards

Message-ID: <6e2ec9f4-dca6-8545-0c4c-365775141c37@carto.net>

Hi,

After upgrading from Ubuntu 18.04  to 20.04 I have now troubles 
compiling QGIS with 3D.

during "ccmake -GNinja .." I get the following error message:

-------------

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:427 (FIND_PACKAGE):
    By not providing "FindQt53DExtras.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this 
project
    has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
    "Qt53DExtras", but CMake did not find one.

    Could not find a package configuration file provided by 
"Qt53DExtras" with
    any of the following names:

      Qt53DExtrasConfig.cmake
      qt53dextras-config.cmake

    Add the installation prefix of "Qt53DExtras" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
    "Qt53DExtras_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
    "Qt53DExtras" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
    has been installed.

------------------

I checked my packages and the package "libqt53dextras5" is installed, 
but it doesn't contain the requested file "Qt53DExtrasConfig.cmake".

Does someone have an idea what package I might be missing or what config?

Thanks,

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

Could you try (change /usr/local/src/QGIS_master with your path to checked
out repo):
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/src/QGIS_master/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake
-DQT5_3DEXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/src/QGIS_master/external/qt3dextra-headers
-DQT5_3
DEXTRA_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt53DExtras.so -G Ninja
-DWITH_3D=TRUE

Kind regards
Saber

Hi Saber,

Thanks for the hint. And now that you write about it, I also found the 
same hint in the build instructions  
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL), section 3.8.1 - 
should RTFM ...

Seems to work.

Many thanks,

Andreas

Message-ID: <CACfnYnSKe1pCyagqpSUgLdgNjA+boArMMuYa4kUq-OZ8=Frnbg@mail.gmail.com>

HI all,

I just noticed the following:

installed a machine with fresh copy of Ubuntu Server 20.04, headless
added the qgis.org repo and installed qgis-server

I noticed that the list of dependencies to be installed was weirdly very
long, and in fact after finishing it was also installed Gnome... is this
normal now?

cheers

It is when you install Recommends, which now enabled by default.

The list is shorter when using:

 apt install --no-install-recommends qgis-server

When installing QGis Server on Windows using the OSGeo4W installer its 
actually the only way. Trying to install only the server part and you 
will not get all dll:s to run the application. Desktop is needed.

Hi Denis,

I'm still receiving these messages.

This workflow applies to old PR or just for the ones submitted after
your fix?

Regards (and thank you for looking into this)

Emails are coming your fork Jorge.
So either disable github action on your fork or I think you might need to
have this commit in your fork (so in your branch)

Although, we do have failing jobs since about 24h
see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Auto+set+milestone+on+PR%22

I don't get the issue at all, it reports this error:

end of the stream or a document separator is expected at line 2, column 19:
      repository(owner: "qgis", name: "QGIS") {


Nothing has been changed lately and the error is a non-sense to me.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] phasing out OSGeo4W QGIS/GRASS 32bit
Message-ID: <1589542649035-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

in the GRASS community, we're thinking about to phase out winGRASS 32bit
versions in 2020, see [1].

in [2] Upgrade Qt version to latest 5.12.x LTR, I saw following comment:

------------
The current idea is to switch to 5.14 and use the occasion to upgrade
compilers and drop 32bit (according to the latest qgis survey only 7% of the
participants still use it).
------------

related:
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/rip-microsoft-to-drop-support-for-windows-10-on-32-bit-systems/

"Microsoft to drop support for Windows 10 on 32-bit systems:

Microsoft has stated that future versions of Windows 10, starting with the
May 2020 Update, will no longer be available as 32-bit builds on new OEM
computers."

all in all a good moment to phase out OSGeo4W 32bit.... :-)

any schedule to drop 32bit QGIS on windows by the QGIS community/devs?

I think a joint announcement about dropping 32bit by both communities
(GRASS/QGIS) whould be good.

any ideas?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer]  Backporting fails if using organization repo
Message-ID: <CAPtRYtCtyobMApqrg-a+GMdGBTk1-dgc0OXnk_stHCmr6LB6Jg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I created PR https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/36153 which got backporting
labels and was merged yesterday. When I checked about backporting I saw
error in backport action:

git clone ***github.com/uprel/QGIS.git
9
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/runs/677324133?check_suite_focus=true#step:2:9>Cloning
into 'QGIS'...

<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/runs/677324133?check_suite_focus=true#step:2:10>remote:

<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/runs/677324133?check_suite_focus=true#step:2:12>##[error]The
process 'git' failed with exit code 128

Problem is that I was using QGIS fork from organization and not my
personal. This backport bot is looking only into personal repositories and
does not check where PR come originally.

This is probably some known issue, right? Anyway, next time I will use
personal repo and for this commit I will prepare backporting manual.

best regards

Please see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/176
for a proposal to kill the unmaintained legacy evis plugin for QGIS
3.14.

It's completely unmaintained and full of legacy code, with zero
integration between the plugin and the rest of QGIS. If we kill it for
3.14 then it gives organisations time to adapt (and possibly develop a
3rd party plugin version if desired) prior to the next LTR release
(3.16).

There has been NO changes made to this plugin (aside from fixes to
avoid breaking QGIS compilation) for over 10 years. In 2010 a bug fix
was made to this plugin. In the following 10 years the ONLY changes
have been compilation fixes.

We've previously put out calls for interest in community members
stepping up to maintain this plugin, with zero interest.

Let's officially kill it and move on :)

How about we contact Peter Ersts (original author, I’ve put him in blind CC here) and see if he has any thoughts on this? There was actually some nice functionality in it’s day but maybe better managed by using plugins. It would be nice to have an inbuilt workflow in QGIS where you can just open a folder full of images, view them as a time sequenced track, maybe with some nice Temporal Controller integration that lets you play the images back in sequence, panning the map along from photo to photo.

Regards

Hi all,

During my modernization of my underlying OS (Ubuntu 18.04 --> 20.04) I 
am also modernizing my self-compiled geo libraries.

I am struggling with libspatialite. What libspatialite versions are you 
guys using?  I am trying to compile libspatialite-4.3.0a, but it 
complains about not finding "proj_api.h" (although this file is 
available at /usr/local/include). I tried both with proj-6.3.2 and 
proj-7.0.1. libspatialite-4.3.0a isn't happy with either proj version. 
Is there a newer libspatialite available somewhere? I noticed that there 
hadn't been a lot of activity with this library in the past months/years.

On a related question: could I build QGIS without libspatialite? I 
failed to do so, but maybe there are some tricks.

Thanks for any hints,

Andreas

For 4.3.0a:

CFLAGS="-DACCEPT_USE_OF_DEPRECATED_PROJ_API_H -O2 should help:
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/gdal/docker/alpine-normal/Dockerfile#L248

You can also build against the development repository of Spatialite:
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/gdal/ci/travis/ubuntu_1804/install.sh#L27
(you could probably drop the "fossil update 90180e065d" which must have been a
workaround against a regression, and the other peculiarities), so mostly:

fossil clone https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite libspatialite.fossil
mkdir sl
cd sl
fossil open ../libspatialite.fossil
./configure [...]

> I noticed that there

Yes, I've tried to maintain a communication channel with the developper, but with
moderate success only. The development is not abandoned, but only at a rather slow
pace.

I don't think you can without some surgery in the code base.
FWIW, the WFS provider depends on it for caching (could potentially be replaced by
something else)

Good idea :-)

So: just point to a dir: let QGIS create an index geopackage by reading
the exif info about time and gps location...

Because (I'm not 100% sure) but did the evis plugin not read the exif
info from images? Or am I mixing up plugins now...

Richard

Hi Even,

Thank you for your help!

I went with the 4.3.0a version and the CFLAGS telling it to use the old 
API version.

That seems to compile fine. Fingers crossed that gdal and QGIS also like 
this approach.

Thanks again,

Andreas

Looks like the certificate for feed.qgis.org needs to be updated - it's
giving an error on startup.

Hi Bo,

Looking at the WAL docs for SQLite (https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) 
(what geopackage is built from) I see this:

"The WAL file exists for as long as any database connection has the 
database open. Usually, the WAL file is deleted automatically when the 
last connection to the database closes. However, if the last process to 
have the database open exits without cleanly shutting down the database 
connection, or if the SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL file control is used, 
then the WAL file might be retained on disk after all connections to the 
database have been closed."

So it sounds like whatever the last process is to touch the GeoPackage 
may not be closing the connection cleanly on exFat.

Cheers,

Jonathan

For clarification: evis doesn't do this (import photos). It just shows
photos linked to a table manually (i.e. the exact same behaviour as
the native "external resource" widget).

However, the processing "Import geotagged photos" algorithm DOES do
all this, except for the temporal configuration.

Richard, Tim, Rohmat (from kartoza) and apparently me.  I don't think I have
been on that machine before.  It's one of the cloud VMs from hetzner.

Anyway - now resolved.

I also noticed this as Giovanni wrote. It does not make sense to install
all this on Linux server (no desktop). Can anyone explain why was this
change necessary?

Should we change documentation on setup part?

thanks

I do feel responsible for the certificates on 'my' servers, but for what
I know have never updated/created a cert on this VM. And at this moment
does not know how to login there.
If someone provides info about logging in, I will do it in future.

Richard

That was also my excuse.  But as I figured is out yesterday (well, today), I
cannot claim that anymore ;)

> If someone provides info about logging in, I will do it in future.

You should be able to logging as root with your key - but there already was a
cronjob, that was supposed to take care of it.

The cronjob and the script it wanted to run just disagreed about dashes and
underscore in the script name.  I would have taken sides with the cronjob and
used dashes in the script name, but as we recently changed scripts in QGIS in
the opposite direction, I changed the cronjob.

Running the script once manually fixed the issue.

Next time I see a notification about the cert of feed.qgis.org, I'll also keep
an eye on that.

The problem seems to be:

 qgis-server Depends:
  python3-qgis Depends:
   python3-qgis-common Depends:
    libqgis-customwidgets Depends:
     qttools5-dev-tools Depends:
      qt5-assistant Depends:
       libqt5webkit5 Depends:
        libqt5positioning5 Recommends:
         geoclue-2.0 Depends:
          libnotify4 Recommends:
           gnome-shell | notification-daemon

And via gnome-shell you many more gnome packages installed.

The change to install Recommends by default was announced in October 2007:

 https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/08/msg00000.html

This makes sense because the Debian Policy documents Recommends as:

"
 The Recommends field should list packages that would be found together
 with this one in all but unusual installations.
"

 https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#binary-dependencies-depends-recommends-suggests-enhances-pre-depends

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi all,
thanks Bas for the explanation. I believe the default should be no DE -
how can be the chain of deps be broken?
Cheers.

Hi !

As far as I can see the solution is in the Link Bas added in his previous
mail.

"To turn this feature off, pass --no-install-recommends to apt or set,
in your apt configuration, APT::Install-Recommends=False."

regards
Werner

Isn't this the underlying source of the issue? I don't see why the
python package is dependant on the customwidgets package. Rather that

Talk to the Ubuntu people.

In Debian libnotify4 only Recommends notification-daemon.

It looks like Canonical did not want to support notification-daemon, the
version in eoan has this changelog entry:

"
    - generate the notification-daemon recommends with some hacks,
      this allows notification-daemon to be demoted to universe
"

In bionic notification-daemon is the only Recommends as well.

Hi

Thanks for pointing it out, but I think we should install server as we did
all the time. No need to look into ubuntu for this. We should look at
dependencies and why some core stuff needs some optional things like Nylan
pointed out. I can see problem might be connected to point where server got
dependency to python3-qgis and then all the rest came in.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/bf31ce1d8cf2e24e3d2ef499a15afa44f9eb5780#diff-3a8967c9c7449446ddcdc76faa20bfaf


I think main question is does QGIS Server needs dependency to python?

If you want to install qgis-server as you did all the time, then you
need to get Ubuntu to revert their libnotify change.

That is the cause for the gnome packages now being in the dependency chain.

Note that every package which depends on libqt5webkit5 has that same
dependency chain, this includes most binary packages built from the qgis
source package.

That is a separate issue to the gnome packages being installed when
installing qgis-server.

How are you going to make qgis-server work without the libraries that
depend on libqt5webkit5?

Bas

Given we haven’t heard from Peter for so long I guess I am +1 for ditching it.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Ugly dialogue on a fresh install
Message-ID: <d4e319331292e6c6501cc1a211ea72f4@carto.net>

Hi, 

For testing purposes I installed the current LTR version 3.10 on a
fresh, snapshotted virtual windows, to make sure it is a virgin virtual
machine. 

On the first run I came across this strange dialogue 

I guess most of long-time QGIS users will never see this dialogue
because they usually don't install on a fresh machine ... but let's say,
this dialogue doesn't look too good to me: 

- The link to the visual changelog is wrong. It points to version 3.4
and not version 3.10 

- it really looks ugly, with lot's of empty space and a non-aligned QGIS
logo with the title 

- Do we really need this dialogue now that we have the news feed section


Or maybe that dialogue was already removed in versions 3.12 or 3.14? 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Unless you want to kill server plugins. Maybe it could be a separated
qgis-server-python package. but as Bas said, it seems a different issue.

Server plugins is nice but do one really need the Qt5 dependency for 
this on the server side? When installing on Windows using the OSGeo4W 
installer you get that too.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Globe Plugin
Message-ID: <CAEvhHDkRRX8n+WYCeQhaG0o-rJH7Ao+jFMD8NY18DCdPBoMQng@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've taken a shot at building qgis with the globe plugin enabled on a
current Gentoo. I've found that the plugin must be built against
osgearth no newer than version 2.8 (which was released 2016-09-15),
because newer versions remove features needed by Globe (osgearth 2.9,
released 2018-02-07, removes the osgEarthUtilModule, and osgearth
2.10.1 - which is the latest release, from 2019-04-19, removes Qt
support altogether).

So, I find that the plugin is unbuildable on a modern system, unless
it drops the need for the osgearth library. Should it be kept in the
qgis tree even so?

Of course.  QGIS - including the server - is based on Qt.  But that doesn't
mean it requires a full desktop environment.

Hi,

Maybe I did open different question with Python support, but I still think
default setup of QGIS Server should be as light as possible for running
standard OGC requests. If you have demand for specific tasks then you will
know what to do to enable Python support and go with plugins. It used to be
like that before.

So then we have this issue with installing bunch of unneeded packages. I
would open issue about that for start.

best regards
Uroš

As one of the grandfathers of the original Globe plugin, I'd say ditch
it - BUT... let's see what Matthias,  Martin and  Sandro think since
they probably are the ones that are most up-to-date on can now be done
with the 3d map canvas and globe

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] The curious case of GeoPackage on exFAT

Hi Jonathan -

Thanks for the "heads-up" regarding wal files. The technical problem is 
using the xFAT file system  - when xFAT gets corrupted, it will partly 
be write-protected. This will inhibit QGIS in making the 2 wal files (or 
updating or deleting them).

But QGIS has an issue here: When the situation occurs, QGIS will quietly 
tell you about in the relatively obscure log system. And it will show 
you an *empty* GeoPackage - no layers. That is not smart. It will upset 
users (It certainly did upset me :-) . They will believe, that their 
precious layers in the GeoPackage has disappeared. However, the layers 
is perfectly alright. If you copy the GeoPackage to another filesystem, 
QGIS will happily open the layers from the copy.

IMHO, a better approach would to have a big fat error message informing 
users that they have a problem with the underlying file system. (I plan 
to write a feature request about this later today)

Hi,

Qgis server is built on top of the Qgis codebase. Qgis  require Qt. Qt 
packages come with all the dependencies, needed or not, to run Qt 
applications in the large.

The problem is mainly Qt packaging, and there is not much you can do 
about this (you may ask why Qgis desktop need gstreamer on linux !)

I am personally +1 to remove it:
- native QGIS 3D view has most of the functionality + a lot more to offer
- there have been no real updates besides compilation / code style fixes in
last ~4 years
- dependencies on OpenSceneGraph and osgEarth have always caused troubles
- we have been on the road to kill any internal c++ plugins in QGIS source
tree

The only major piece of functionality that's not in the native QGIS 3D view
is the "earth as a globe" view - so there may be some users that may be
missing that functionality.

So if we decide to remove the plugin, the question is whether to remove it
ASAP or wait until QGIS 4.0 or wait until globe support is in native QGIS
3D...

Regards
Martin

No objections to removing on my part.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsRasterMarkerSymbolLayer
Message-ID: <1590004603024-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,

I am working on some modification to the Raster Image Marker class
QgsRasterMarkerSymbolLayer.
In the process I noticed some strange behavior of the original class.

I created a new test project with a layer containing a single Raster Image
Marker.
In the source file gqsmarkersymbollayer.cpp I added a global variable for a
QgsRasterMarkerSymbolLayer class instance counter. It increases in the
constructor and decreases in the destructor of this class.
Ideally (in my opinion) this counter should always be balanced. But when I
close and open the project again (with no extra action) the counter is
incremented by 3 each time in the iteration.
If I do something after opening the project, for example, changing the size
of the image, and then after closing and opening the project again, the
counter increases by 8 or more.
Almost the same behavior with the QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayer class.

Is it some sort of leak or something else (normal)? Does this behavior
require further investigation?

Hi all,

please see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/179
for a proposal to add `pip` and `conda` support to QGIS, i.e. turning
the current plugin management into actual package management.

Message-ID: <84F889D9-421E-487E-9C40-3A26B9791537@kartoza.com>

Hi All

Thanks to Anita’s nice import script I have loaded the changelog for 3.14 with all the new features:

https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.14/


There is still a bunch of work to do to categorise the entries, combine entries where having them together makes more sense, clean up text etc.

Toto you so kindly helped us last release - I wonder if I could ask you (a nice beer on me when we meet at a hackfest one day) to help again?  I guess you are a bit familiar with the workflow now.

It would be great to get more volunteers to help as 3.14 is a real whopper of a release with many many new features.

All of the entries are in the ‘General’ category at the moment. My proposal is that as you review an entry also assign it an appropriate category and we treat the General category as the ’TODO’ list so that anyone who wants to help can just dive in there and find and unreviewed entry.

If anyone wants to help but does not have the needed permissions - just contact me offlist and I will set you up.

@Richard do we need to do some tweaks to make the importing of in-content images smoother this time?

Regards

Tim

Hi everyone,
I have seen changelogs and they seem to me to be few,
I extracted all the features from the repository using this filter:
is: pr is: closed label: feature merged: 2020-02-22T00: 00:
00Z..2020-05-15T12: 00: 00Z

and there are 130:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afeature+merged%3A2020-02-22T00%3A00%3A00Z..2020-05-15T12%3A00%3A00Z

how to proceed??

I make myself available !!

here I have collected and classified the features:

Hi Tim,

Please have a look at Toto's script:
https://pigreco.github.io/changelog314/
it also looks very nice!

I will have a look this week. It would be nice to end up with a very
simple way of loading small images whey you enter the page (and see/load
them all) and when you click on them (to see the full image). Not
talking about a fancy lightbox here, just a clickable image for now in
which the image itself is the (small) preview and the link is to the
real image (which then will open in the same window).

I just tested, and at this moment the rst does not hold any images?

If there is a version with enty images, I will have a look at:
https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/images
https://sphinxcontrib-images.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

As it looks like that is what we want?

Not sure what to do with the nice animated gifs: keep these full or also
create a (then static) preview of them...

Regards,

Richard

and maybe others

they are part of previous versions and not of the 3.14 Pi

Hi Toto,

Thanks for this work! My personal opinion would be: skip these in 3.14
(or add them by hand in 3.12...)

We never promised to have 100% coverage of features in the visual
changelog.

And developers/community are in some way responsible to have their new
features listed (or not), so a dev could have removed maybe a new
features as he/she does not find it fit in the changelog?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Devs,

I happen to see a little 'clock' tab in the 'dev tools' in master on
Debian, and see it is some kind of startup profiler...?
The dev tols are getting better and better :-)

I do have an issue with long startup times on Windows at a client
working with a cytrix setup (though I guess it is a general
python/startup issue there), but was wondering if this would come to the
Windows world too... (technically different?)?

To be honest I never had issues on Linux, but that is a rather beefy dev
laptop...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Oh wait that is my bad, I didn’t tag all the items to import properly. I am going to remove the entries and reimport.

Thanks - let’s keep our focus on the changelog site so that we can include things like sponsor links, tidy up text etc.

Hi

Toto: I re-ingested the Changelog entries now.

Richard: For the entry images that are linked to GitHub embedded images we either need to import them over or just link out to them in the generated RST. If you tell me which you prefer I will ask Anita Hapsari to help make that happen before the release.

Regards

Tim

Yeah! Full credit goes to Nathan Woodrow here, this panel just exposes
a profiling tool he added a while back.

This is EXACTLY the kind of issue this was added for! I also see
occasional 5 minute+ startup times on Windows (bare metal installs)
and would like to get this resolved for 3.14. (It's a bad experience
for users, and when things are working correctly QGIS should startup
in a couple of seconds at most. Our (usual) speedy startup is
something which differentiates us from a certain other desktop GIS
application ;)

It will, it's just that the Windows nightly builds are too old to have
it. It looks identical to your screenshot.

On that note, 12 seconds is a long time for the plugin load I see in
your screenshot. Can you expand that out and see if it narrows down
the culprit?

Do not worry about that one, that was QGIS starting up during my
'make -j8' build of QGIS master :-)

As said on Linux startup times are just much better.

I will wait for this profiler to show up in windows and report back...

Thanks all!

I did not know that. Amazing tool.

@Richard How does your Citrix setup / architecture look like
(approximately)?

@Nyall If this has anything to do with Python stuff - and it probably
might - can you elaborate on the kind of bare metal setups where you are
observing this?

I am troubleshooting "pure" (i.e. unrelated to QGIS) Python setups for
clients on their Windows boxes on a regular basis. There are multiply
typical culprits for slow load/import times. My #1 favorite is a certain
"security software" typically found in large deployments, but it is a
problem that applies to most "security tools" with varying degrees of
slowdowns. #2 on the list is a mix of NTFS-related issues (rights
management, shadow copies). #1 can usually be identified by
(temporarily) deactivating online scanning of every accessed file. In
some cases, you can only rule it out by deactivating the entire
"security" tool *and* re-installing Python (QGIS in your case) - because
the "security" stuff digs itself deep into the import mechanism. In some
cases you can actually observe changed hash sums of critical Python
libraries ... #2 can be ruled out by installing the entire stack with
*minimal* user rights only (really, really important) onto a clean NTFS
partition / disk without shadow copies. You might not be able to run a
setup.exe with user rights depending on the system configuration -
you'll then have to work around by copying an existing installation into
a user's directory (followed by manually adjusting configurations,
paths, rights and owners). #3 on the list is (SMB/CIFS) network shares.
If your (Python) software is running from there, your best (bad) option
is playing with the buffer configuration of this mechanism, which
usually is not an option in large deployments. Your second best (bad)
option is deactivating the scanning of network traffic in the "security"
tool.

I'd add that I would also like to understand why loading just the Python
support itself requires 1.5 seconds.

@Nathan & @Nyall Where in QGIS' source can I find the profiling tool? I
just searched and could not locate it ... Would you consider adding
support for a Python profiler to it, e.g. [1], [2] or [3]? The relevant
code could (conditionally) be injected somewhere around here [4] or here
[5]. I have played with this idea a while ago. It works in principle,
but a proper integration into your GUI would be great ...

Best regards,
Sebastian

I'll ask around for more details, as I'm there just as a user of that setup.

But I did try a lot of things: and exactly what you tell: their virus
scanner was pushing some hash version of all python files to some online
service. So I disabled it...
But still... And off course they are working with some network shares,
so I will try out some of your other idea's

In my debug build, using
export QGIS_DEBUG=5

I see:

../src/core/symbology/qgssymbollayerutils.cpp:3936 :
(svgSymbolNameToPath) [0ms] Svg found in alternative path
../src/core/qgsruntimeprofiler.cpp:80 : (end) [0ms] PROFILE: Load

Correct. QgsRuntimeProfiler is the tool that can do it.

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsRuntimeProfiler.html

In Python you can access it using this:

 QgsApplication.instance().profiler()

An example:

   QgsApplication.instance().profiler().start("my_thing")
# long expensive stuff
     QgsApplication.instance().profiler().end()

Hi, this is great!

I reopened this very long standing issue (5 years) of windows slow startup
phenomenon: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/20061

Hi Tim,

I think I prefer these images IN the export. Then at least the 'old' way
will just work.

If that is in place I can have a further look at using for example

https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/images

Or if that fails (as it does now with me), then I can have a look at
generating thumbnails myself and add some ::target to them to the real
image or so

I also tested current export, and besides the usual little hick-ups
(because of content of the items) there are some new bigger ones, of
which I created issues:

https://github.com/kartoza/prj.app/issues/1186
https://github.com/kartoza/prj.app/issues/1187
https://github.com/kartoza/prj.app/issues/1188
https://github.com/kartoza/prj.app/issues/1189

It would be great if Anita could find some time before the release to
have a look into these.

TIA & regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Ah great, thanks for filing those. @anita can you take a look through those?

@Frank last release you were wanting to help out with the changelog - will be great if you are available to pitch in.

@Richard for now I think I will manually just move the images into the entries which should fix the issues with embedded images.

Regards

Tim

Hey Tim,

Myself and Andrew from Chartis Technology have some work time this week we
can spend on helping a bit. Not sure what day yet but will fit a few hours
in between other tasks.

Or the newer, more Pythonic  way:

   with QgsRuntimeProfiler.profile('loading something'):
      # do some stuff

I'd encourage plugin authors to use this in their plugins
initialisation code as much as makes sense!

Hi Tim,

Thanks for setting up the changelog. I'll proofread the entries and will 
also check the grammar.

Regards, Frank.

Hi devs,
I don't know if this helps as well or is related with the Profiler subject
but Michel Stuyts share a QGIS plugin  Plugin Load Times that measures the
load time of qgis plugins (not the core but measure all the others).
More info in here:

*If QGIS takes long to start, it is probably because some of the plugins
you installed take a long time to load at startup. This plugin shows the
latest load time of each plugin (QGIS startup, plugin installation,...). It
does not give you information about the speed of plugins when they are
used. With the information provided by this plugin you can easily decide
which plugins to disable, to make QGIS start faster.*

This plugin adds a toolbar button and an item to the plugin menu to see how
long each plugin loads in QGIS 3. It shows the QGIS python variable
*qgis.utils.plugin_times
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/b1b647349ac5d43a6f0b1a308dd7480f11dded63/python/utils.py#L358>*
in an easy to understand window. It's possible to sort the results based on
plugin name or on load time. In the latest version it also has a pie chart
with the data visualized.

Some core plugins are not available in the QGIS Python Variable, so they
will not be shown in this plugin. For the following core plugins no
information about the load time is available in "Plugin Load Times":

   - Coordinate Capture
   - eViz
   - Geometry Checker
   - Georeferencer GDAL
   - GPS Tools
   - GRASS 7
   - OfflineEditing
   - Topology Checker



https://gitlab.com/GIS-projects/Plugin-Load-Times

Search in plugin manager for Plugin Load Times or

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/PluginLoadTimes/

Cheers,
João Gaspar

Hi

@Nyall - I remember once you proposed a set of guidelines for the way that changelog entries should be written - can you possibly dig up your list again - I will add it in the changelog site.

@Frank and others reviewing entries - I would like to remove developer technical jargon from the entries if possible - e.g. “This PR” and similar references to PRs and git workflows which will probably be meaningless to most users.

Regards

Tim

ah, ok - this was not *quite* what I meant.

It's actually possible to use Python's cProfile for better understanding
the *entire* QGIS Python mechanism and its issues - e.g. on startup on
"interesting" Windows deployments. I have just injected cProfile into
QGIS' startup code and visualized its output (on Linux), see here:

http://static.pleiszenburg.de/qgis/qgis_startup_cprofile.png

I'd be *very* interested in seeing something similar coming from Windows
boxes with slow QGIS startup times. If I had to bet, I'd expect
anomalies (i.e. high runtimes) in the CPython interpreter's module
import mechanism.

Best regards,
Sebastian

Actually the biggest culprit seems to be parsing all the processing
grass/saga .txt description files. There's hundreds of these, and
Windows' slow file access makes reading them all very expensive.

I'm going to experiment with concatenating them all to a single file
to see if this helps...

Hi Anita,

We clearly have a few submissions which definitively fall into the
"new feature" category. Shouldn't these be rejected outright?

Thanks Anita.
Glad to see such a wealth of high quality, very useful proposals, some
pretty exciting.
Is #7 ready for discussion?
Isn't it compulsory to submit a QEP? If so, #10 should be moved. What is
#14?
Cheers.

Probably best to ask on the QEP.

Yes it is compulsory. I included all submissions here for complete
transparency.

I don't know more than what you can also read in the submission form
results. :-)

Hi Anita,

Thanks!
I added the missing tags.
Could you ask 10 and 14 to provide a proper QEP on the github repository to
have a place to discuss technical details?

Cheers,
Denis

I included all submissions here for complete transparency. During the
next two weeks, it makes sense to discuss if the proposals fulfill the
requirements. Only valid submissions should move forward to the voting.

Regards,

Anita

Ok - it's just that the openlittermap proposal is clearly a new
feature and doesn't even have anywhere to comment on the proposal!

Hi all,
Recently I made a wiki page on the OSGEO website that you can find here
<https://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php?title=Improving_qgis_3d>
I will be reporting my progress there and on the mailing list on a weekly
basis from now on.
Starting from 1st June I will start implementing the features on my
proposal starting with the vector layer texturing support for displayed 3D
buildings.
If you have any suggestions please let me know. If you want to discuss the
project I am also available.
Best regards,

Hi Nyall,

I had a brief look in the grant proposal form, to double check what we 
said in the "call for grant proposals":

It says:

"This year, we will not accept proposals for the development of new 
features. Therefore, proposals should focus on improving the QGIS 
project infrastructure and polishing existing features."

 From this statement it should be clear that new features shouldn't be 
put forward for voting.

I think it makes sense to rediscuss this decision every year, as in the 
future we might be in the position that we also fund new feature 
development - who knows ...

Greetings,

Andreas

Hi everyone,
according to my script the new features introduced in QGIS 3.14 Pi are 133
against the 125 present in Changelog 3.14.

One way to compare changelogs is to use the PR number, so I kindly ask if
it was possible to have a detailed list of features with a PR number.

I tried to use the description, but in some cases it has been changed.

thanks and good job

Hi Tim,

I've had a look through the changelog and have allocated each entry to a 
category. Authors might want to check that their entries are allocated 
correctly as I might have classified some of them incorrectly. I've also 
replaced "PR" with words like "update", "feature" or "change" and have 
removed references to github and QEP where I came across them.

Regards,
Frank.

Hello Paolo,

Yes I'm still maintaining graffiti tests (even if it would need more love)
on qgis4 server.


> whereas the latest comparison with other engines are one year old:

MSperf ran on a dedicated C2C server then reports was pushed to finally be
available on http://test.qgis.org/.

However, I think that the C2C server is down for several months now. At that
time there had been an attempt to add MSperf on qgis4 by C2C but it has not
been achieved.

Paul

Hi,

Due to popular demand, we have decided to reopen the submission form and
to extend the deadline to allow for submission of missing QEP links.
Please note the new and final deadlines:

* Proposal submission: Friday, May 29 (end of business day CET)
* QEP discussion deadline: Tuesday, June 9 (instead of June 7)

Proposals without QEP will not move forward to the voting.

Regards,
Anita

Thanks for preparing the wiki page - it will be useful to track the
progress and I am sure many people will be happy to read about the
fancy new features during the summer :-)
And especially if you include some nice screenshots - everyone loves
screenshots of cool 3D graphics :-)

Message-ID: <CAECJsSrie1JcBsXBpT0wtYFZGkEUsry_qyPKJDD2eb5C4wwZcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

This is a request to fix an annoying bug we are having with Travis in docs
repo for almost a month. Pull-requests are sometimes reported as failing
while they shouldn't; restarting the build usually fixes it. I have opened
a report at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/5398 but it
does not seem to get attention so I wanted to bring it to your attention ;)

Thanks to anyone looking into this.

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi,

I can have a look, but I can't promise anything: Travis CI is
sometimes totally not deterministic.

Message-ID: <CAEDrt3_WfgLmQ+cYTKFVOFSK=VyF9smspv7ASiGScW_0xKNAjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I can't find gdal 3.1 in OSGeo4W, but only gdal 3.04 and 3.2 (gdal-dev).
QGIS master depends on gdal-dev (3.2), but since QGIS 3.14 supposed to be
released in less then a month, won't it make sense to test it against gdal
3.1 as gdal 3.2 won't be released before QGIS 3.14?

Kind regards,
Idan

according to the bug tracker, the mentionned bug has been fixed.
@Nyall Dawson <nyall.dawson at gmail.com> do you know about any other blocker
on PROJ side that would justify to stick with 6.x versions in OSGEO4W?

How do I get pyqgis or how do I setup pycharm to code for QGIS under Linux
there are several pages but no one has some clear instructions to achieve
this

I appreciate any hints

Hi,

Did you see
https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins/ide_debugging.html#debugging-with-pycharm-on-ubuntu-with-a-compiled-qgis
?

I think only the path must be adapted.
 You can follow
https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins/ide_debugging.html#making-eclipse-understand-the-api
to get the path.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Oracle spatial compound (2004 SDO_GTYPE
	collection) objects
Message-ID: <CA+y4WrToRv7iUerKwX+nsqqF7Rs+iUAzhi=Dq0aT1yKR3g0_6w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,



I have "collection" objects (2004 SDO_GTYPE) from an Oracle spatial DB,
that I wish to display using QGis. As far as I understood, this isn’t
possible and I would like a confirmation, or some workaround, if ever
possible.



The following is an example of an object found in my “shape” column:



MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY(*2004*, NULL, NULL, MDSYS.SDO_ELEM_INFO_ARRAY(1, 2, 1,
5, 2, 1, 9, 2, 1, 13, 2, 1, 17, 2, 1, 21, 2, 1, 25, 2, 1, 29, 1, 2, 33,
1003, 1, 41, 1003, 1), MDSYS.SDO_ORDINATE_ARRAY(700518.829, 5156838.484,
700520.831, 5156822.663, 700516.342, 5156903.685, 700540.45233515,
5156890.95679796, 700505.811693905, 5156881.54926549, 700516.297,
5156888.439,  [ . . . ]



Trying to add this as a layer results in an error like:



“Tipo geometria e SR non definiti per la colonna vuota SHAPE” (translated:
“undefind geomeotry type and SR for the empty SHAPE column”)



I also tried downloading latest 3.12.3 release, as I read in the change
logs there was an added support for “Oracle compound polygon”, but I guess
that wasn’t exactly what I needed.



Thanks for any help

It's not possible indeed, your vector layer need to have a more precised
geometry type so QGIS could handle it correctly. When you create a new
geometry from "collection", what do you expect? a point, a line, a poly?

Actually, for now, QGIS accept layer with mixup of single and multi geometry, line
and circular string but there is this PR [0] that try to get rid of this
because it leads to some issues (arc being segmentized in edition for instance)

[0] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/34358

As a workaround, you should make some Oracle view to expose the
different type of geometry so it could be loaded gently on QGIS (you'll
have several layer)

No, it's for polygon which are made of lines and arcs.

Ok, I've updated to QGIS nightly now on those machines.
Note it's VM's with network disks and virusscanners... (and QGIS itself
is on the networkdrive...)

This is an image of the plugin loading times:

Now you got my attention since Lat Lon Tools was one of the plugins that
was flagged. A number of my tools are initialized when they are first used,
but I guess I need to take a closer look at what might be slowing it down.
Suggestions are welcome.

I don't know if it helpful or not but here are my results on QGIS 3.12 with
the Plugin Load Times plugin. This is on a Windows 10 laptop. I can cut off
a little more time with Lat Lon Tools, but not much more. It looks like I

No blockers that I know of. I've been tracking proj/gdal master and I

Sorry for digging up this old thread, but as after upgrading QGIS, my
normal install on Linux Mint is (again) gone, so a I fell back on the
flatpak version which I installed recently to try.

Now I luckily found this thread dealing with missing python modules in
flatpak.
I tried to install "Distant measurement styles" via the Resource Sharing
plugin.

This did not work, cause "urlib3" is missing.

Could someone elaborate more on that python wheels stuff and where to
install what (exactly) to add missing python dependencies to the flatpak?
 From what I read, I only understood half and I would like to keep at
least one functional QGIS version.

Cheers,

Bernd

Hi Bernd,

I do not know how to fix this, but I would create an issue at the
flatpak repo:

https://github.com/flathub/org.qgis.qgis/issues

They are rather responsive.
In here:
https://github.com/flathub/org.qgis.qgis/issues/28#issuecomment-587224383
It looks like you can run python (so pip?) command within your flatpak
environment (which is different then your default qgis profile envirnoment).

If you find out, please report back so we can update the flatpak
instructions on the download page.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

actually, I do not intend to fumble myself deeper in this stuff, but
have the hope that some more enlightened people could give some more
detailed instructions how to proceed the before-mentioned workaround.
So, maybe 5 sentences on the matter might be better than only the one
given so far.

Cheers,

Bernd

Wow,

thanx a lot!

Umh, just reading https://github.com/flathub/org.qgis.qgis
Seems I can just reinstall the flatpak with the needed module

|flatpak run --command=pip3 org.qgis.qgis install scipy --user Will give
it a try! Cheers, Bernd |

Ah, YES, that is it. Apparently without the --user it flatpak will try
to install it in the non-user space of it's environment.
So THAT works:

flatpak run --command=pip3 org.qgis.qgis install urllib3 --user

Then I was able to download "Distant measurement styles" successfully!

Thanks! Will add it to the docs

Really great!

Worked liked a charm.

Beginning to like Flatpak :)

So, more or less, sorry for the noise. The solution was right there, it
would have only taken to read it ;)

Cheers,

Bernd

Hi devs,

I have added a WMS layer as a QgsRasterLayer to the map canvas and would like to add an attribution overlay text "Copyright blah..." fixed to the bottom right of this layer (and only this layer).

How could this be achieved? The WMS belongs to a third-party.

Regards,

Could you expand out those two slow plugins? (processing and lat long tools).

My suspicion is that you'll find that the lat long tools plugin is
importing some processing modules and causing them to be initialised
prior to the main processing plugin starting (which is perfectly fine,
there's no issue with doing that). I expect that if you expanded out
lat long tools you'll see that it's caught up in the processing module
imports.

But I'm keen to see the expanded view to see where the hotspots still
are and where we need to add more granular logging. (Should probably
think about adding an "export to json" option here!!)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Search/filter boxes in service dialogs
Message-ID: <26ae0f9a-c008-e8d7-17d4-b4bdf4d8ec0e@duif.net>

Hi List,

One of my longtime wishes comes true:

https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.14/#allow-filtering-wmts-list-source-dialog

I did not even notice it at first because the search input is so small.
Had a little chat about it with Denis, and thought to bring it here.
We have a lot of different search/filter inputs:

We have several service/connection dialogs, and all have different
search/filter boxes:
- WMS has (now) a small one above the table
- WFS has a large one aboven the table
- Oracle connection has a set of fields below the table
- Just like postgres
- Network connection tree has one above the tree (with 'Filter requests')
- browser has one above the tree, but hidden (you have to click the
litte Y (funnel/filter sign?) first) with 'Type here to filter visible
items...)
- Options has a small one above the left column telling 'Search ....'

etc etc

Would it not be nice to streamline those to more or less the same
size/icons/text in it? There is also the normal input and the qgis input
with the 'clean input' icon.

We have: https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/hig.html

Anyone enough into this (or has a strong opinion) to create some guidelines?
Some of my preferences but I'm not so strong, happy to change:

- I would be ok with a hidden input(set_ over the total length of the
filtered widget) showing itself when clicked on the filter-icon and
preferably 'rembembered' (some tables I really like to always filter)
- always above the widget to filter
- I'd say: always a little 'magnifying glass'-icon in it
- no pref with me about the 'clean icon'
- always with 'Filter...' unless you need to give more info so: 'Filter
visible items....'
(not sure if 'filter' is the same as 'search' though)

I think with all the features flying in, we have to try to be a little
consistent in what it looks like?

(mmm, sorry, did not want to make it this long :-( )

Regards,

Richard Duivenvorode

Hi Michał,

I was waiting for any of the QGIS developers to comment on this ... A
collection of common, bad approaches can be found here [1]. Bottom line:
There is no clean way to do it. I recently wrote a summary of the
situation and those approaches, see here [2]. I also released an
official QGIS enhancement proposal which is currently being discussed.
It addresses this issue, among other stuff, see here [3]. I'd appreciate
if you could describe your desired use-case and put it as a comment into
the discussion. It would help to support the proposal.

Best regards,
Sebastian

Dear Devs,

I would like to use the SVG symbology files of QGIS (e.g., those located at ../OSGeo4W64/apps/qgis-ltr/svg) in a web Map.

Is there any copyright or license that I should be aware of?

Best regards,

Hi all,

I am organizing a small online Q&A plus discussion session for QEP 179
for actually *talking* about this proposal *next week*. If you are
interested in joining, please let me know what time is best. Proposed
times are in Central European Summer Time (CEST):

Thanks & regards,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] pyqgis doc build broken?
Message-ID: <CAECJsSpHTBhgok31HV6c=-Bnvt5yBMfyq8fVzEN-Jx7O0RC+4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

Looks like the pyqgis doc did not build for quite some times.
When you go to https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master, the last update time is
today but there are some changes that I'd expect to see there and they are
not:
eg
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/36566/files#diff-70971f0e258f54410aca383bd4af0942R272
still in master code at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/core/auto_generated/geometry/qgspoint.sip.in#L272
should not render like this
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsPoint.html?highlight=distancesquared3d#qgis.core.QgsPoint.distanceSquared3D

Regards,
Harrissou
