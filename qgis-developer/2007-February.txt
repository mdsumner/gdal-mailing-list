I think that taking one row from legend for the buttons is not such a
waste of space. I was focusing mainly on usability - mixing global and
item-specific menu items IMHO is not very good, using a toolbar
instead of global menu items seemed to be a good solution for me how
to split them.

Giving user a choice to select which approach suits better his needs
might be good...

Isn't legend in separate window somewhat less user-friendly? Usually
software tries to have everything in one window rather having multiple
windows for one application (e.g. Gimp), or am I wrong?

On what linking does it fail? When building qgis_core lib or qgis application?
When you add pthreads library to linking, does it compile and run well?

Is it really a Qt dependency and not a dep of another package? I'm
asking just because it seems that people build KDE4 successfully on
FreeBSD with CMake and I haven't found any problems mentioned on
mailing lists.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GPS plugin in QGIS 0.8
Message-ID: <a9fa15490702010546u284cf82cq6f9690f39670f944@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
in the latest package generated with help of debian configuration
files the GPS plugin does not work:

I have sources of qgis 0.8 from svn
I have debian directory from qgis svn (current version of the conf.
files is 0.8-2)

I build the package using dpkg-buildpackage command

When I start qgis, I get following error message:

Failed to load /usr/lib/qgis/gpsimporterplugin.so
Reason: QLibrary::load_sys: Cannot load
/usr/lib/qgis/gpsimporterplugin.so
(/usr/lib/qgis/libgpsimporterplugin.so: cannot open shared object
file: No such file or directory)

And really, libgpsimporterplugin.so is not in my system.

When I go to qgis_08/src/plugins/gps_importer and run "make"
everything seems to compile fine, but apparently now libgps* is
generated.

Could you help me please to get QGIS with GPS import plugin running?

Thanks

Jachym

Hi Martin

One other comment I have about cmake (although I think it may have
applied to automake too) is that it doesnt copy over the headers for
qgis needed for writing third party apps etc against the qgis libs. My
install log below illustrates this:

The failure is in the link of the qgis application:

According to the error messages, it's Qt that needs the threading libraries.

It may well be that KDE4's CMakeLists.txt file has calls to the
FindThreads package or some similar trick.

That's interesting that the linking fails for qgis_gui library - thus
qgis_core library must have compiled well.

Just to make sure - do you use CMake in version 2.4.3 or later?

In FindQt4.cmake module it's already used to search for the threads
library for UNIX systems:
FIND_PACKAGE(Threads)
SET(QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY ${QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY} ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT})

Can you check your CMakeCache.txt file in root of your build to see
what is the value of qgis_gui_LIB_DEPENDS variable? Mine looks like
this - pthread is there.
qgis_gui_LIB_DEPENDS:STATIC=/usr/lib/libQtCore.so;-lpthread;/usr/lib/libQtCore.so;dl;/usr/lib/libQtGui.so;/usr/lib/libQtGui.so;-lSM;-lICE;/usr/lib/libX11.so;/usr/lib/libXext.so;/usr/lib/libQt3Support.so;/usr/lib/libQt3Support.so;/usr/lib/libQtNetwork.so;/usr/lib/libQtNetwork.so;/usr/lib/libQtXml.so;/usr/lib/libQtXml.so;qgis_core;

Also can you try to add this line at the end of CMakeLists.txt in root
dir of qgis sources?
MESSAGE (STATUS "Threads: ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT}")
And see what value will it show when you run CMake.

Hi Tim,

you're right, installation of headers was not included in install
phase. I've took a look on the changes you've done and it seems to be
OK. Just a one note - it's probably not needed to include
${QGIS_CORE_MOC_HDRS} or ${QGIS_GUI_MOC_HDRS} as those headers are
already listed ${QGIS_CORE_HDRS} resp. ${QGIS_GUI_HDRS}

cmake --version reports:
cmake version 2.4-patch 4

according to the tarball that was used to build it it's 2.4.4

Ok, so it seems like there's a problem in CMake's FindThreads.cmake
module. Do you have some time to find out what goes wrong there? This
should be possible by inspecting some other variables (with the
MESSAGE command) that this module sets, e.g. CMAKE_HAVE_SPROC_H,
CMAKE_HAVE_PTHREAD_H, CMAKE_HAVE_THREADS_LIBRARY

grep Threads /usr/local/share/Modules/FindQt4.cmake shows nothing of
the sort --- there is no FIND_PACKAGE(Threads) (or FIND_PACKAGE of any
sort) in my FindQt4.cmake file.

Hmmm, it seems that thread detection has been changed. Here's how it
looks like in CMake 2.4.3 in FindQt4.cmake:

  #######################################
  #
  #       System dependent settings
  #
  #######################################
  # for unix add X11 stuff
  IF(UNIX)
    # on OS X X11 may not be required
    IF (Q_WS_X11)
    FIND_PACKAGE(X11)
    ENDIF (Q_WS_X11)
    FIND_PACKAGE(Threads)
    SET(QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY ${QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY} ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT})
  ENDIF(UNIX)

Newer versions (I've looked into 2.4.6) use qmake's QMAKE_LIBS_THREAD
variable to find this out. Please try this:
- create a file, e.g. x.pro with this content:
message($${QMAKE_LIBS_THREAD})
- run: qmake x.pro
- it should report the threading library which will be use, for me it shows:
Project MESSAGE: -lpthread

No joy.

$ cat > x.pro
message($${QMAKE_LIBS_THREAD})
<control-D>
$ /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.2/bin/qmake x.pro
Project MESSAGE:

My cmake is direct from the FreeBSD ports collection, which is installing 2.4.4

My Qt-4.2.2 is built from source, because QT4 isn't in the BSD ports
collection at all.
I configured and built it with no special options.

Looking in my FindQt4.cmake for something like what you posted I find
no block that's like that, and no "IF(UNIX)".  But I do find this:

  ###############################################
  #
  #       configuration/system dependent settings
  #
  ###############################################

  SET(QT_GUI_LIB_DEPENDENCIES "")
  SET(QT_CORE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES "")

  IF(Q_WS_X11)
    # X11 libraries Qt absolutely depends on
    QT_QUERY_QMAKE(QT_LIBS_X11 "QMAKE_LIBS_X11")
    SEPARATE_ARGUMENTS(QT_LIBS_X11)
    FOREACH(QT_X11_LIB ${QT_LIBS_X11})
      STRING(REGEX REPLACE "-l" "" QT_X11_LIB "${QT_X11_LIB}")
      SET(QT_TMP_STR "QT_X11_${QT_X11_LIB}_LIBRARY")
      FIND_LIBRARY(${QT_TMP_STR} NAMES "${QT_X11_LIB}" PATHS ${QMAKE_LIBDIR_X11}

    SET(QT_CORE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES ${QT_CORE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES} ${QT_LIBS_THREAD})

    QT_QUERY_QMAKE(QMAKE_LIBS_DYNLOAD "QMAKE_LIBS_DYNLOAD")
    SET (QT_CORE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES ${QT_CORE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES} ${QMAKE_LIBS_DYNLO
AD})

  ENDIF(Q_WS_X11)

That does sure look like it's trying to get the QMAKE_LIBS_THREAD
stuff out of qmake, but isn't getting anything.

Strange, though, I've tried to augment your "x.pro" file with an
additional message:
message($${QT_X11_LIB})
and that, too, prints nothing but "Project MESSAGE:".  I'm suspicious of that.

Ok, so let's try to track down the source of the problem further. Take
a look on configuration that your qmake uses. For me, it's in
/usr/share/qt4/mkspecs/linux-g++/qmake.conf
When looking into mkspecs/common/linux.conf (included from the former)
there are following lines (exactly the vaules that qmake reports):
QMAKE_LIBS_THREAD     = -lpthread
QMAKE_LIBS_X11        = -lXext -lX11 -lm

What values are there in your case? Is that empty?

I think I know what's going on here - on FreeBSD, QMAKE_LIBS_THREAD is
empty and there's another variable used instead: QMAKE_LFLAGS_THREAD =
-pthread
So it seems that FindQt4 macro is not ready for this situation. If so,
we should report it to CMake developers - but could you please check
first whether this problem stays also in latest CMake release?

And for the current situation - will setting CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS
in ccmake to "-pthread" help to continue the build?

Yes, that is what I see in
/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.2/mkspecs/freebsd-gcc++/qmake.conf

Adding "-DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-pthread" to the cmake line does
indeed allow the compile to continue past where it was dying earlier.
Now, instead of getting linker errors in making the qgis_gui library
at 30%, it gets to 59% and complains so:

[ 59%] Building CXX object src/app/CMakeFiles/qgis.dir/moc_qgspythondialog.o
Linking CXX executable qgis
/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.2/lib/libQtCore.so: undefined reference to
`pthread_cleanup_pop'

and so forth.

Good, so please try setting also CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS and
CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS variables to -pthread and I hope it will
build everything.

Message-ID: <d368056f0702020333k16218ec9p159debe511120163@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

For your info, I have created a new branch raster_transparency_branch
in which Peter Ersts and I (mainly Peters work!) are implementing
improvements to raster transparency handling. The branch can be
checked out using:

svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/raster_transparency_branch

If Peters work is stabilised in time, we will merge it into trunk
prior to the 0.9 release.

Peter: the branch includes your patch sent to me last night.

Regards

Yes, indeedie.  So the necessary cmake command line for FreeBSD 5.5 was:

cmake -DGRASS_PREFIX=/usr/local/grass-6.3.cvs
-DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.2/bin/qmake
-DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-pthread
-DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS=-pthread -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-pthread
.

This got everything to compile and link.  I haven't tested whether it
runs properly yet, because I'm not near the machine and can't run it
remotely over dial-up.  I'll report later if there's any problem
running it.

I don't have any machines currently running FreeBSD6, so can't check it there.

Great to hear it finally compiles! Could you please check whether this
is still a problem also in CMake 2.4.6 ? If so I would report the
problem together with some other smaller issues we've hit previously.
In that case I will also check in a workaround for this problem - it
seems that all *BSD platforms are affected.

I think adding the section below to root CMakeLists.txt should solve
the problem without the need to specify -pthread explicitly. Could you
try it?

IF (CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME MATCHES "BSD")
  SET (CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS ${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} -pthread)
  SET (CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS    ${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS}    -pthread)
  SET (CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS ${CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS} -pthread)
ENDIF (CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME MATCHES "BSD")

Hi Tom and William

I got my dead MacBook restored to life last week. They replaced the
motherboard, hard drive and keyboard. This presented me with a nice
opportunity to set up my Mac OSX development environment from scratch
while documenting the process.

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingOnMacOsX (added in above the old notes).

The notes document what I have done so far. Now when I run cmake .. I
get the following:

tims-computer:~/dev/cpp/qgis/build tim$ cmake ..
-- Found Proj: /Library/Frameworks/proj.framework
-- Found Sqlite3: /Library/Frameworks/sqlite3.framework
-- Found GEOS: /Library/Frameworks/geos.framework
FindGDAL.cmake: gdal-config not found. Please set it manually.
GDAL_CONFIG=GDAL_CONFIG-NOTFOUND
-- Could not find PostgreSQL
-- Could not find Expat
FindGSL.cmake: gsl-config not found. Please set it manually.
GSL_CONFIG=GSL_CONFIG-NOTFOUND
-- Could not find GRASS
-- Python libraries found
-- SIP not found!
-- PyQt4 not found!
-- Python bindings disabled due dependency problems!
CMake Error: Some dependencies were not found!
-- Found Qt-Version 4.2.2
-- Configuring done


So my questions are:

1) What was the trick for getting cmake to find gdal properly?
2) Do you know if GSL is available as a framework?
3) If I install your (Williams) Grass installler without X will cmake
pick it up and will Grass work properly in QGIS?
4) Whats the neatest way to get SIP support?

My goal is for everything to be done with maximum ease for potential
new developers of QGIS on mac, avoiding building dependencies from
source and leaving minimum clutter / duplication of libs on the
system. Ie it should look nothing like my last development environment
looked :-p


Thanks in advance for any tips!

Regards

Tim

Is that cmake changing those to lowercase, or is it the way you  
configured it?  It doesn't really matter on OSX with a normal HFS+  
file system, but it would if someone was foolish enough to try using  
a HFS+ case sensitive file system, or UFS.

> So my questions are:

I've been afraid to dive into this new cmake thing, so I don't know  
how to configure it.  The GDAL framework 'unix' style path is / 
Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/unix, so gdal-config is /Library/ 
Frameworks/GDAL.framework/unix/bin/gdal-config.

I tried to make gdal-config as unix-friendly, like the original, as  
possible, but there is one -framework flag in the --dep-libs for  
SQLite3 (I did that so it wouldn't accidentally pick up the system's  
sqlite).  If the new cmake configure uses dep-libs to test link GDAL  
(it probably shouldn't), and can't handle -framework flags, it could  
fail to find GDAL.

I've been considering making a second, purely OSX-savvy, gdal- 
config.  It would return all framework flags where available for  
dependencies and linking.

> 2) Do you know if GSL is available as a framework?

I haven't made one.  It's one of those one-off things - only Qgis  
uses it in all the software I package and/or use - so I just bundle a  
dylib with Qgis.

> 3) If I install your (Williams) Grass installler without X will cmake
> pick it up and will Grass work properly in QGIS?

That should work fine - the only direct X11 dependencies in GRASS are  
the XDRIVER and the bundled TclTk, and Qgis doesn't use GRASS display  
drivers.  Only NVIZ will not work without X11, as that uses the TclTk  
libraries directly.

New to Qgis?  I don't think I've heard of it.

Ah, the eternal quest to organize one's Mac ^_^


A question on cmake - how well does it handle universal flags?  That  
is, how easy is it to add the flags the the right compile and link  
commands?  (ie GCC complains if there are multiple -isysroot flags,  
which could easily happen if CFLAGS and LDFLAGS were included in  
linking.  Then, depending on the libtool version, you had to do weird  
prefixing so it wouldn't drop those flags.)

Or are you adding a builtin universal build option to Qgis?

I don't know if you've seen this trick, but I use this now to get  
universal builds (besides making Xcode projects):

http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20061025213851279

No need to mess with CFLAGS/LDFLAGS or hacking makefiles.  You can  
customize the source to leave out the -isysroot flag if you are on  
Intel, where it's not needed.

I think you have to specify the path to gdal-config with ccmake.

I edited the path in CMakeCache.txt. The default CMake behavior is to 
find frameworks before traditional libraries. I have both and CMake 
passed over the gdal framework and chose the library.

For gdal and pgsql, there is a hardcoded so extension so if it chooses 
the library, you still have to edit CMakeCache.txt.

> 2) Do you know if GSL is available as a framework?

Don't know. I built it from source.

I have both William's GRASS and my own built from source. CMake finds 
neither. Another edit for CMakeCache.txt.

In addition, HAVE_PTY needs to be set to 1 after running with a valid 
GRASS path. I tried editing the code to check the right header on a Mac 
but had no luck.

> 4) Whats the neatest way to get SIP support?

I built sip and pyqt from source. CMake finds it and and compiles our 
code. The link stage has problems with Qt frameworks however. This one 
was beyond my CMake skills and, after a week of getting everything else 
to run on a Mac, I retreated to c++ for awhile.

I haven't tried this but adding additional architectures by editing 
CMakeCache.txt is supposed to work.

CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=ppc;i386

My file currently contains:

/Build architectures for OSX
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=ppc

//isysroot used for universal binary support
CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT:STRING=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk

Hi

Thanks for the replies Tom / William / Magnus

I bit the bullet and built expat / gsl / sip / pyqt from source. For
some reason SIP does net get found though:

Grass does seem to be found ok from Williams GRASS.app using the
configuration option shown above. Tom any idea what to do to get SIP
detected properly?

Hi Tim,

I guess Magnus had similar problem on windows and I think that changing
qgsspatialindex.cpp line 23 from
#include <SpatialIndex.h>
to
#include "SpatialIndex.h"

hope that helps!
Martin

Hi,

in case that these paths are somewhat "default" for Mac, it's no
problem to them to add them to detection routines... as I see at least
/usr/local should be supported for GSL, what about the others -
GDAL_CONFIG and GRASS_PREFIX ?

Hi

Yes I think this would be a good idea since my wiki docs (which will
hopefully becme the official guide for buildng on mac) make use of
williams gis frameworks which I think make sense for anyone
considering building on mac to use. Even adding GRASS.app path might
not be a bad idea.

Regards

Tim

I've added the paths so you shouldn't need to specify GSL_CONFIG,
GDAL_CONFIG and GRASS_PREFIX on Mac anymore.

I wonder if cmake can handle -framework flags, then it would be even  
simpler to have that as an option (but leave a unix gdal-config  
option as a choice).  Have it use:

-framework GDAL

instead of checking with gdal-config or hardcoding paths.  Same for  
other of my frameworks used in Qgis.  A choice of unix-style dylibs  
or Mac frameworks, if available.

The latest change still finds the library even though the framework is 
present. Also, the library filename is libgdal.dylib not libgdal.so.

It now will find /Applications/GRASS.app but will not find (if 
/Applications/GRASS.app is removed) /usr/local/grass-6.2.1 which I think 
is standard for a self-built GRASS.

All tests were done on an empty build directory.

I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're asking for but there is a 
CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK variable which defaults to FIRST. Other values are 
LAST, ONLY and NEVER.

Making this a configuration parameter would allow someone with both to 
choose without specifying pathnames.

Hi Martin

When building SIP bindings for core GEOS frameworks arent being added
to the include path and so I think the build is failing when geos.h
etc are not found.

See below.

There doesnt seem to be a CMakeList.txt in python/core - where are the
requirements for SIP set? I looked in python/CMakeList.txt but couldnt
work out where geos find should be added.

Regards

Tim

CMake searches first directories in PATH, then the additional
specified directories - that's why it has chosen GDAL in /usr/local in
your case. Regarding dylib/so - are there both of them or only .dylib?

Adding /usr/local/grass-6.* directories to search path shouldn't be a
big problem also, however it would be needed to be checked with a
wildcard since there are more possible versions.

Btw. I've seen a commit from you to correct python bindings for mac -
do they build and work correctly for you?

Hi Tim,

there's configure.py.in file which runs SIP utility and then creates
custom makefiles. This file is first configured by CMake to obtain the
correct paths. The way how to add GEOS would be:
1. in top part of the file create a variable with include directory
(like gdal_inc_dir):
geos_inc_dir = '@GEOS_INCLUDE_DIR@'
2. below, there are statements which specify include directories that
will be used in the makefile (search for extra_include_dirs) - just
add geos_inc_dir to that list.

There are copies of proj, sqlite3, geos and gdal in both /usr/local and 
/Library/Frameworks. Why wouldn't the search path be the same for all 
searches?

If I set CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORKS to LAST, it will find all four in 
/usr/local. Leaving it unspecified (the default is FIRST) should find 
all four in /Library/Frameworks.

> Regarding dylib/so - are there both of them or only .dylib?

There are only .dylibs. On a Mac, a library is always a .dylib and a 
module or plugin is a .so.

The commit fixes some link problems. I now get a "Python console" item 
on the Plugins menu. The menu item doesn't do anything and I haven't 
checked the code to see if it should do something. On Ubuntu, the 
bindings don't build because sip is too old and I haven't built anything 
from source there.

My Mac build probably compiled because my primary build has everything 
except Qt in /usr/local. Using frameworks usually exposes additional 
problems so I like to build using traditional paths first to minimize 
porting problems.

The FOSS4G (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) conference is
pleased to announce the Call for Workshops for the 2007 conference,
being held September 24-27 in beautiful Victoria, British Columbia,
Canada.

FOSS4G is the premier conference for the open source geospatial
community, providing a place for developers, users, and people new to
open source geospatial to get a full-immersion experience in both
established and leading edge geospatial technologies.

This is your chance to showcase your favorite application, integration
solution, or other topic. You will use your superior classroom skills to
lead a group of attendees through your chosen topic in either a half-day
or ninety minute lab or classroom format. Half-day workshops will be
delivered on Monday, September 24 (the Workshops day), while the ninety
minute workshops will run concurrently with the presentations during the
remainder of the conference.

While we are open to workshops on a wide range of topics, we strongly
encourage workshop submissions on the following topics:

Practical Introduction to ___________
Interoperability
NeoGeography and NovelGeography
Using a Software Stack
3D Worlds
In the tradition of previous FOSS4G events, we expect that the majority
of workshops will be "hands on", with participants seated in front of
computers and able to follow along with the instructor, working directly
with the software and applications under discussion.

Be prepared to spend considerable effort in creating your workshop.
Past experience has shown that a high quality workshop requires about
three days of preparation for each hour of presentation time. As part of
this preparation you will be expected to develop material for attendees
to take away with them, such as handouts, a 'workbook', CDROM, etc.

In recognition of this effort, workshop presenters will receive a
reduction in the price of conference registration:

free registration for delivering a half-day workshop
half-price registration for delivering a 90-minute workshop
Because of limited space, you may want to consider submitting two
versions of your topic, one for each length format.

Please visit the workshops page on our website to download the
submission templates and instructions for sending them in:

http://www.foss4g2007.org/workshops.html

The deadline for workshop submissions is February 28, 2007. Submit
early, submit often!

Python console is now working. moc_qgisapp.cxx needed to be manually 
deleted so that it would be regenerated with the signal enclosed by 
HAVE_PYTHON.

The iface.zoomFull() example worked. help() sent output to the terminal 
however.

Message-ID: <d368056f0702070830k663aec5y9459dcbc4df8a69c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I'm trying to get my openModeller stuff (which uses qgis libs for map
display) to compile against trunk built with cmake. I use
QgsApplication as the base class for openModeller Desktop but there is
a hiccup when compiling (see below). Its using the headers put into
/usr/local/include/qgis after doing a make install in qgis. Does
anyone have an idea whats potting here?

Thanks

Tim

Current SVN works fine for me, however I did have to set  
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to my qgis libs and the Qt4.2 lib dir:

gsherman@madison:~/qgis_09$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/home/gsherman-dapper/development/qt-x11-opensource-src-4.2.2/lib:/ 
home/gsherman/qgis_09/lib

Probably because search for GDAL works differently - while some other
packages search directly for libs and include dirs, GDAL search looks
for gdal-config. So if you modify PATH to search in frameworks first I
think it will work well.

Great to hear it's working. I'll have to change that slot
showPythonDialog() will be unconditial to stop the problem with
non-existing slot.

help() or print commands output directly to terminal since I haven't
done any redirection of input/output to the python console. It will
show only the resulting values or nothing if 'None' has been returned.

There are surely many ways how this console could be improved, this
one serves currently as a proof of concept.

You're right, Tim. I just forgot to announce this. It's the hack for
correct windows linking, Qt uses a similar one. One possibility would
be to #define CORE_EXPORT and GUI_EXPORT in 3rd party apps, other
possibility is to create a small header that will handle this
automatically and all headers will include it. I think the second
option sounds better as it's not very kind to user to demand #defining
something he doesn't know about.

Please consider however that the presently most advanced editing tool
for qgis (ie through GRASS plugin) will be heavily modified upstream in
the near future. It would be good, in my view, not duplicating efforts,
and joining our (limited) forces as much as possible.

Could you elaborate on this a bit? This sounds promissing. What are you
planning in the near future?

Hi,

I think this is due some of the recent commits which were made to fix
compilation with 'MSYS Makefiles' generator and probably has broken
'MinGW Makefiles'.

I think Tim has a definite and much better solution for showing SVN
revision, with that fix we should be able to forget all these
problems.

If you're asking for an immediate solution, just edit qgssvnversion.h
and delete the backslashes.

It's not my plan; Markus can let us know more about the future of GRASS
development. From my side, I can tell working independently on different
tools for digitizing could only slow down the overall development pace,
and give the user too many different (ie confusing) alternatives.
Thus ideally, the progresses made for GRASS digitizing upstream should
be incorporated as much as possible in a unified qgis digitizing tool
(dreaming?).

So this sounds like theory, since upstream changes in the GRASS
digitalisation-stuff does not mean that the QGIS-GRASS_plugin gets
updated accordingly. So no concrete plans made to include more
digitizing stuff into QGIS-digitizing?

Hi,

I don't think that Tim's suggestion for replacing qgssvnversion.h would
work. Having some special text in a file that svn automatically replaces
with the version number (aka $Id:$ with cvs) will result in something that
only gets updated when that file is changed. For example, if a commit is
made to a separate file, svn won't update the file that contains the
special text.

As far as I can see, running the svnversion command and placing that
output somewhere where qgis can see it (at compile time or run time) is
the only way to get an up-to-date version number.

Urg! You are completely correct. I just tested to verify in a small
project Jason and I are working on and it behaves as you stated. Sorry
to be a spreader of FUD then! :-(

Yes, definetly. I realy like a general editing tool inside QGIS for all
types of vector layers. But at least the GRASS-part is somewhat
different from the simple feature stuff OGR implements, its topological
(and this is good!:-)

Anyway, and steps for consolidating the editing parts are highly
appreciated (and I volunteer for testing!).

Then I think we could use SVN hooks that would ensure that on every
commit qgssvnversion.h would get updated with the current revision.

Or on the other side - is knowing SVN revision important? I think
users usually know which SVN revision they use in case they're
building from SVN...

Martin

Martin is correct.

There is a README_windows.txt (since 10 secs) which mentions that you 
should use sh.exe to compile, after configuring in cmd.exe.

Alternatively, run cygwin shell.

Hi
Hi

Since no one else has responded I will take a look at your patch. Many
thanks for your contribution. In future it could be helpful if you
include a small description of what the patch is for, what problem it
solves and which branch of QGIS it should be applied against.

Many thanks

Message-ID: <d368056f0702090102l7112211er8a533f9450df0cd5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Magnus Homann has backported the CMAKE stuff to 0.8 branch for the
upcoming 0.8.1 release. I would like to release by  Sunday 18 Feb
barring objections from the floor.

There are a small amount ( < 10 I think) of string changes that need
the attention of translators.

Tom I am having a small problem building under Mac OSX with the cmake build:

Linking CXX shared library libqgis_core.dylib
ld: Undefined symbols:
_CFRelease
_CFURLCreateWithBytes
_LSOpenCFURLRef
_kCFAllocatorDefault
/usr/bin/libtool: internal link edit command failed

I recall we had the same problem before but I cant remember how we
resolved it :-(

Those who would like to get in last minute bug fixes can check out the
sources here:

svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/Release-0_8_0 qgis0.8branch

NOTE:  ONLY BUGFIXES !!!

Regards

Tim

Why  map units per pixel axis X is equal map units per pixel axis Y?
It is planned to change?
I have a raster map with other sizes, but I cannot show it correctly.

earlier in the week. The web page can be found at: http:// 
www.foss4g2007.org/workshops.html

It would be good if several of you (developers/users) submitted a  
proposal. I think workshops that illustrate the application of QGIS  
in real-world situations would be good, however they would have to  
have a broad enough scope to appeal to a wide audience.

Developer focused workshops are also of value. In particular,  
something along the lines of plugin development, application  
development using QGIS libraries, and plugin/application development  
using Python would be of interest. I'm sure you have more and better  
ideas.

Read the call for workshops to see the focus areas the organizers are  
interested in for this years event.

I have a favor to ask. If you are planning to submit a workshop  
proposal, please email me with a few details. I would like to not  
only be aware of what is being proposed, but also be aware of any  
overlap and possibility for collaboration. If you want to share your  
plan with the list, feel free to do so, otherwise just email me  
directly. I have set up a wiki page that can be used to document  
conference plans as they evolve:

    http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/FOSS4G2007_Conference

If you need write access to the wiki, create an account and then  
email me or <tim at linfiniti.com>.

Finally, we are hoping to be able to offer a subsidy for folks  
presenting a workshop or paper at the conference. This would apply to  
those that lack any corporate/academic funding. The amount of subsidy  
will be decided on a case by case basis and will offset some of your  
costs, not cover them all.

Thanks for your participation in QGIS!

It looks like the build process has decided you are not running on a Mac 
and is therefore not adding Mac libraries to the link process.

When using the Qt pre-built binaries with the old build system 
(--with-qtdir=/usr/local/Qt4.2), you need to create three symlinks in Qt4.2:

ln -s /usr/bin /usr/local/Qt4.2/bin
ln -s /Library/Frameworks /usr/local/Qt4.2/lib
ln -s /Developer/Applications/Qt/plugins /usr/local/Qt4.2/plugins

Ok but with the cmake backort that homann has done does this still
apply? I would have thought that if trunk builds then 0.8 branch
would....? Although obviously there will be some differences between
the two cmake configs since the lib refactoring wasnt backported....

Because the message was about 0.8, I responded (autoresponded? ;) ) with 
info for the old build  process. I haven't tried cmake with 0.8 because 
it doesn't fix anything for 0.8/Mac and, as has happened for you, may 
raise new problems to be solved.

Regarding your error, if you are using cmake, the advice is somewhat the 
opposite of the previous message. Cmake may be finding Qt headers 
somewhere in the /usr/local tree. Finding Qt headers outside of a 
framework on a Mac seems to confuse cmake. In this case, you don't want 
an include symlink (and one isn't necessary even for the old build system).

Hi Horst, Paolo, Stephan

In an ideal situation, the GRASS vector provider would hide the details of the 
topological data model and change requests like addFeatures, deleteFeatures, 
changeGeometryValues etc. from QGIS to grass specific editing calls. Of 
course this is not a trivial task. And some concepts (like centroids), which 
do not exist in QGIS at all could made provider dependent (buttons 
deactivated for providers not supporting it). But in my opinion, the benefits 
of having a unified GUI for digitising would be enormous and therefore worth 
the effort. And the GRASS users would automatically have the benefits of 
rollback changes with the start editing/stop editing buttons.

cheers,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WMS Design Problem and Mac Crash
Message-ID: <45CE7B51.8070201@comcast.net>

Hi all,

I'd like to fix a Mac crash and some redraw problems which involve a 
change extending through several layers of QGIS so I am putting this out 
for review before proceeding. The redraw problem can be seen using a WMS 
layer when resizing the window and sometimes when zooming. Only 0.8 
crashes but the redraw issues are the same in 0.8 and 0.9.

The WMS provider calls processEvents to fetch a remote image while 
inside a draw event. processEvents is needed to receive the network 
event containing the retrieved image, however, calling processEvents 
during a draw event on a Mac can result in incorrect drawing or a crash.

The problem occurs because processEvents may process other draw events 
while waiting for the remote image and, at least on a Mac, draw events 
cannot be interrupted by other draw events.

To a lesser extent, odd redraw artifacts also remain in Ubuntu after 
resizing a WMS layer.

One fix is to add a loadImage routine to the provider so that the canvas 
can notify all layers about what is needed beforehand and not call 
QPainter::begin until all images are locally available.

For local layers, loadImage does nothing. For remote layers, loadImage 
initiates a transfer if the cache is invalid. The canvas then needs to 
wait until all layers signal ready.

Tom

There are some projection related fixes and other cleanups from Magnus
and others in 0.8 which should affect all platforms.

Im pretty sure this isnt the problem since I only have the dmg install
on my system and no othere Qt stuff anywhere else. I kinda wanted to
keep my system clean and avoid any post install hacks on Qt to make
things work - hence my interenst in cmake. Also since we are not sure
how long 0.8.x is going to be around I thought it might be nice to
have the cmake build process available for developers wanting to use
cmake since in my opinion the build process is much simpler and
cleaner using cmake (not to mention faster).

I will try diffing the various cmake files to see if I can spot any
mac fixes in trunk that didnt make it into Magnus's backport to 0.8.

Hi

It seems to me that if we could coordinate our efforts we could try to
get the following presentations together:

Presentations:

 - QGIS 'nuts & bolts' - all about the Quantum GIS open source desktop
GIS application project.
- Using QGIS libs in your application


Workshops:

- plugin writers workshop ( we should get feedback from Marco on
whether there was a lot of demand on this )
- QGIS and GRASS
- Programming QGIS with python

Hi

I support this idea. In fact it might work well with and idea I had
some time ago for creating a caching and composition manager for QGIS.
The idea being that when a scene is rendered and the extents havent
changed (e.g. one layers visibility was toggled) the compoistion
manager renders the layers directly from the cached copy rather then
redrawing every aspect of the scene. In addition to that we can gain
on performance by not rendering part of the scene that were rendered
in the last draw event. For example if the user pans, we can just
fetch the new area of the scene and stitch it onto the still visible
parts of the last scene. For things like WMS I think this could
provide an especially good performance benefit. Also for network
intensive layers like PostGIS it should provide some benifit. Letting
the user allocate a certain amount of memory (or disk space like
google earth does), we could in fact store numerous previously
rendered layers scenes and pull them straight from disk. If course we
would need to flush the cache for a layer if its symbology changes
etc.

So adding loadImage() to the mapLayer interface would be a good first
step in that direction.

Regards

Tim

Hi again Tom

SO I spent some time comparing the libs and frameworks that are being
linked to in trunk and 0.8 branch build with cmake. They are listed in
full at then end of this email. The main difference I noticed is that
the following OSX specific frameworks are not being linked:

-framework Carbon -framework QuickTime

Some browsing on the web suggests maybe I need these too?

-framework CoreFoundation -framework CoreServices

I tried using the advanced option of ccmake and adding the above
frameworks which added the following to CMakeCache

     77 //Flags used by the linker.
     78 CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=-framework Carbon -framework
QuickTime -framework CoreFoundation

But that didnt seem to help. I notice they arent in the  linker flags
section of CMakeCache generated in trunk. So my question is: do you
remember what you did to get Carbon and Quicktime linked in on trunk?

Many thanks

Tim

we can provide the openoffice slides from the QGIS workshop in Lausanne, if s.o.
wants to use parts of it. There were about 20 - 30? people watching the
workshop.

Dear Magnus and Martin Dobias,

Thanks a lot for your kind reply and advice. My compilation process was
successes when I use shell (sh.exe) and 'MSYS Makefiles' generator option. 

Best regards,

Martin is correct.

There is a README_windows.txt (since 10 secs) which mentions that you 
should use sh.exe to compile, after configuring in cmd.exe.

Alternatively, run cygwin shell.

If you can convince the cmake Qt detection code that you have a Mac, 
these items will be added automatically.

I tried cmake in the 0.8 branch and it didn't think I have a Mac either!

-- Found GRASS: /Applications/GRASS.app/Contents/Resources (6.2.1)
-- Looking for openpty
-- Looking for openpty - not found
-- Python libraries found
-- SIP not found!
-- Python bindings disabled due dependency problems!

-- Looking for Q_WS_MAC
-- Looking for Q_WS_MAC - not found.
-- Looking for Q_WS_WIN
-- Looking for Q_WS_WIN - not found.
-- Found Qt-Version 4.2.2

I then set Q_WS_MAC:INTERNAL=1 in CMakeCache.txt to help it out. It then 
complained about an undefined openpty variable so copied the current 
FindGRASS.cmake to the branch. It now believes I have a Mac.

-- Found GRASS: /Applications/GRASS.app/Contents/Resources (6.2.1)

There must be other things that are different in the 0.8 branch becase 
in trunk, I had QGIS and the GRASS plugin built and running (without 
pty) before I fixed FindGRASS.cmake.

I'm not sure this is the right place to discuss thsi, but it would be 
good to have a way to dra partial rasters, that is no reading the entire 
file into memory. Good for *huge* rasters and *very zoomed in* rasters.

See ticket #574.

Is this related in any way?

And this composition manager could render a scene in QGIS in tiles such that 
the progress is better visible for users. If the system is idle, it could 
render the tiles around the visible area such that pan actions in the future 
are very fast (also see google & co. for an example).

cheers,
Marco

For the plugin writer workshop, the number of participants was also about 
20-30 persons (similar to the QGIS user workshop). A plugin writer workshop 
is good to get people starting with QGIS coding. I would appreciate if there 
is was also one in 2007. The slides and code example from last year are 
available from:

Yes..of course there will be a couple of gotchas like making sure that
labelling behaves well when rendered across tile boundaries etc...

My understanding of gdal is that it does not read the entire file into
memory in these situations:

I asked Frank Warmerdam about this over on GDAL and his answer was
basically that performance is basically a factor of:

- presence of overviews ('pyramids' in QGIS)
- the file format characteristics

So in these situations where an overview exists the IO required for
e.g. a very zoomed out image is substantially less. I'm guessing that
simple formats like ArcInfo ASCII grid are not very effiecient in this
respect since they dont have pyramids or scanlines.

One thing I noticed while looking at the docs is that performance can
be dramatically improved for some drivers by using AdviseRead prior to
performing read operations:

http://www.gdal.org/classGDALDataset.html#03a02a76682d883b378a2241528775c7


Peter perhaps another goodie to add to our todo list for raster
revamping if you are interested...?

I went through and addded misisng includes all over and now Im as far

Hi

Its better to write on the qgis-dev mailing list (and to search on the
mailing list before you write!). This question has already been
answered on the mailing list, but since I still need to update the
tutorial here is a work around:

QString myLayerPath = "/data/gis/mylayer.shp";
QString myLayerBaseName = "mylayer";
QString myProviderName = "ogr";

QgsVectorLayer * mypLayer =
      new QgsVectorLayer(myLayerPath, myLayerBaseName, myProviderName);

Search the mailing list for 'myLayerBaseName' for more details..

Regards

Tim

Dear QGIS users and developers

The mail service on our server thew a wobbly today.The mail was
offline for most of the day. The issue seems to be resolved and the
mail server is functioning normally again.

If you sent any email to the list today please consider resending it
as it most likely got lost in the ether! Please let me know if you
have any further issues! I hope the issue did not cause too much
disruption.

Happy QGISSING!

Message-ID: <20070215121348.2e20848b@thoe.hq.intevation.de>

Dear Qgissers,

while working hard with the qgis 0.8.0 win32 binaries from
download.qgis.org I found some oddities. Perhaps you are aware of them,
if not I will create a bug-entry in the tracker:

* Query-Build inside the metadata-tab does not open for PostGIS-layers.
  It works on GNU/Linux though. Using the Querybuilder by
  double-clicking the layername inside the open-dialog, everything
  works fine though.
* SPIT: once starting the import of a shapefile the 'cancel'-button
  does not work anymore. It would be nice to cover the import into a
  transaction block that 'cancel' could be easily rolled back.
* The OGR-driver where GRASS is linked against does not support
  PostGIS. This should be changed so that GRASS can export to PostGIS
  directly using v.out.ogr. (Is it save to exchange the gdal|ogr.dll
  with one with postgresql-support, perhaps from fwtools for win32?!)

The next 'problem' appear on both windows and linux-systems:
* Snap-Distance for editing PostGIS-layers does somehow not work
  correctly. Also 2 Error-boxes appear with the hint to the place to
  change this.

Some suggestion:
* GRASS toolbox: The module-name should be prompted somewhere on the
  tab, perhaps directly over the first entry-fields of the module-tab?
  This would make it easier to see which module is open.


As always, thanks for your hard work on QGIS though.

Best regards
	
	Stephan

This is a known issue e.g. http://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/507

Ok I think this needs a feature request filed so we dont forget it.

Ok good suggestion. We will need to rebuild gdal in the msys anyway
which I am planning to do for the 0.8.1 release so we can be using
gdal 1.4. I will try to build it with postgis support. I dont know if
its safe to use the one from fwtools - all I can suggest is to try
yourself and see if it works...

I also had problems with this when trying to move vertices....another
one for the bug tracker.

We will address what we can in 0.8.1 and continue with 0.8.2 etc if needed.

Hi
Thanks for making the bug reports / feature requests.

> Sounds wonderfull. Any timelines when 0.8.1 will be available?!

We were hoping to get 0.8.1 out (well at least tagged) this weekend.
That is dependent on a few cmake issues to be resolved still.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Compiling against geos-3.0.0rc4
Message-ID: <45D4B7E9.2070602@alumni.uwaterloo.ca>

Hello list,

I know that GEOS 3.x is not officially supported yet, but I've been able
to compile the released qgis 0.8 against geos-3.0.0rc3 without any
trouble - the patch that was posted in December, or something similar,
must have been applied before it was released.  I just tried compiling
against rc4 of GEOS, and produces some new problems.  The first error
(below) seems to be an issue with the linker.  After getting that error,
if I make clean then make again, I get a different error (also below).
Since the problem only happens with rc4 of GEOS and not rc3, I checked
with the geos-devel mailing list first, but so far no answers seem to be
jumping out.  Can anyone make sense of what's going on, or offer some
ideas that I could try?

Regards,
Mike

Message-ID: <878976.56189.qm@web35011.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello There
 We have been building several plugins for Hydrology to be integrated in QGIS. When we started the project (aroung 9 months back), QGIS version used was 0.7.4 and Qt version used was 3.3. The plugins work ok on linux. Now we plan to make .dlls corresponding to each of the plugins to be used on windows by users. 
 However, mingw32-chroot provided by you (Tim and Radim) is based on Qt4. We tried converting the plugins' .ui, .mocs etc.  from Qt3 to Qt4 using qt3to4 converter unsuccessfully. The problem was related to various functions used in the earlier version had different argument structure. Then we tried compiling the linux version code (which was based on qt3.3) with the Makefile.win and other mingw-chroot binary utilities (like winmake, i586-mingw32msvc-g++). This effort was also unsuccessful. 
 I was wondering if anyone has mingw-chroot which was used for compiling qgis0.7.4 (based on qt3.x) for windows. Or atleast Makefile.win.rules and Makefile.win.rules files for compiling qgis0.7.4.

Regards
Muks

Message-ID: <741364.49365.qm@web35001.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

This may sound trivial (and may be it is) but I was wondering why a QGIS package with all the associated software sources (like gdal, proj, grass etc.) put together with relevant scripts files are not made available as a single entity which will make it a lot easier for the linux qgis users. 
    I have built few plugins for qgis .....but it seems that the users are more inclined to use and install it only if I could give them just one .zip file etc.(with all qgis,pluging, associated libs) and then they have to run lets say one makefile (or a couple) to get the software running. Users don't want to browse the internet and graplle with dependencies and paths etc. Why this is not often done....or am i missing the point big time. And if it is/can be done, what the easiest way to do it.

Hello,
        I am trying to develop a interface which just displays shpe files. I
followed one of the tutorials on qgis.org webiste and i was able to do that.
Now i want to change some of the display features.
let's consider , i displayed shape file with some point data and that point
data is related to gas stations in particular place, i want to replace those
points with some picture.
could you please tell me which class or functions i have to use to do this.
thanks in advance

Tim,

I can clarify that without any patching, both 0.8.0 and the svn trunk
will compile and run fine with geos-3.0.0rc3.  If I then uninstall rc3,
install rc4, and add a symbolic link that points from libgeos-3.0.0rc3
to libgeos-3.0.0rc4, QGis will still run.  So it's binary compatible at
least.  It just doesn't seem to like compiling against rc4.

When the svn trunk is compiled against rc4, the output is essentially
the same as the first error I was getting with the release 0.8 version.
 The only difference is that if I make clean then make again with the
svn trunk doesn't give me a different error (as the release version had
been).  So...does this then point to a problem with some changes with
geos-3.0.0rc4?

P.S.: How do you set the install libdir to /usr/lib64 with the cmake
setup?  With the ./configure script, I would just add
--libdir=/usr/lib64.  I tried using -D LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH=/usr/lib64,
but unless I got something wrong, that option seems to put the libraries
there during make, rather than make install.  I also tried
CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR and CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH, but neither of those did
the trick.

Mike

Hi

I have been working on this exact thing. See my detailed notes here:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingDistroIndependentLinuxBundle

I just need to package grass into it....

You can download an example here:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/qgis_linux_bundle.tar.bz2

The above is just a test build. In addition I have an installer like
the one here (which actually contains a more up to date copy of qgis
than the above bundle, although the user is only shown the
openModeller link):

http://downloads.sourceforge.net/openmodeller/openModellerDesktop-1.0.4-linux-installer.bin?use_mirror=ufpr

I'd like to have one day something like http://extensions.joomla.org
where people can upload, search for and download QGIS extensions. If
you or anyone else are interested in contributing some time and effort
into this it would be most welcome. Considering the effort that has
gone into making QGIS extensible via plugins, making the plugin
builderscript, writing tutorials and giving demos, QGIS has had
precious little contribution back in the way of plugins.

Anyway thanks for the suggestions and interest - we look forward to
your contributions!


Regards

Tim

Hi

I dont have a solution for this yet, except to turn off SIP bindings.
If you are specificaly trying to use the python bindings that
obviously doesnt help. If  you dont need the bindings, just do

rm -rf build   (if you have it)
cmake .. (may not need to do this step)
ccmake ..
scroll right down
toggle the bindings option
press c to configure
press g to generate
press q to quit

If you are on the OSX system you need to edit CMakeCache.txt and
change gdal.so to gdal.dylib

If you are on linux the SIP bindings should build assuming you have
installed SIP and PyQt.

This topic is better discussed on the qgis mailing list since there
are people better able to help there.

Tim

There was no such thing since qt3 does not support mingw. QGIS 0.7.4
was built using qmake and the non commercial edition of Qt3 (from the
back of the Blanchette and Summerfield book). Getting it built was a
real pain and the build environment was not easily replicable.

Porting from qt3 to qt4  is fairly trivial and I suggest you follow
this route, using the qt3 compatibility libs to start with until you
have removed all remnants of qt3 specific logic. One ip is that for ui
files I found it easiest to simply open the ui file in designer4 and
save it out again - that will convert the ui fairly painlessly
(assuming you are using qt3compat libs). Lastly check out the article
I wrote some time back on adjusting your paradigms for qt4 here:

http://qgis.org/content/view/81/99/

For building under windows with qt4 you can now use Qt4 with the msys
archive that Tisham, myself and a few others created, which makes
building QGIS on windows pretty painless.

Tim

Hi

I suggest looking in the source code of qgis at the vector properties
dialog (qgsvectorpropertiesdialog.cpp from memory) as it should give
you some useful hints on how to proceed.

Hi

I should also mention the spiffy new build notes I written on the wiki for osx:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingOnMacOsX

Maybe they will help you (and if you find any problems if you use them
let me have your corrections!).

Regards

Tim

Hi


here is a short snipet that may help:

    914   if (mypVectorLayer->isValid())
    915   {
    916     qDebug("Vector Layer is valid");
    917   }
    918   else
    919   {
    920     qDebug("Vector Layer is NOT valid");
    921     return;
    922   }
    923   QgsSymbol *  mypSymbol = new QgsSymbol(mypVectorLayer->vectorType());
    924   mypSymbol->setFillColor(Qt::black);
    925   mypSymbol->setColor(Qt::white); //outline
    926   mypSymbol->setPointSize(5);
    927   mypSymbol->setFillStyle(Qt::SolidPattern);
    928   QgsSingleSymbolRenderer *mypRenderer = new
QgsSingleSymbolRenderer(mypVectorLayer->vectorType());
    929   mypRenderer->addSymbol(mypSymbol);
    930   mypVectorLayer->setRenderer(mypRenderer);

There is a change between GEOS 3.0.0rc3 and rc4 that requires either an 
edit to GEOS or a new compile flag to QGIS in order to compile.

I made the following edit to rc4 in order to provide the missing 
routines to QGIS. Change line 30 of source/inlines.cpp from

#if defined(__MINGW32__) && !defined(DLL_EXPORT)

to

#if !defined(__MINGW32__) || defined(__MINGW32__) && !defined(DLL_EXPORT)


Some routines, including four that QGIS needs, can be defined either 
inline or linked from the GEOS library. If you define GEOS_INLINE for 
QGIS, the functions will be defined inline and you won't need external 
copies of these routines.

A MINGW user was getting doubly defined errors when using GEOS_INLINE 
and therefore submitted a patch which removes the library routines. The 
patch was probably intended for MINGW only but actually affects all 
platforms. I'm surprised no one else has noticed. Perhaps everyone is 
defining GEOS_INLINE.

No worries I was half asleep when I responded to your emails too, so
it could just have been me not reading your messages carefully enough.

The wiki is where I started

Good idea I'll try to do that on the weekend...of course its a wiki so
if you create yourself account and let me know your UserName I can
give you write access and you can just tweak the notes directly with
your additional thoughts & observations (they would be greatly
appreciated).

Yes its stil neccessary if you are building using Williams frameworks.

I could do or perhps just link off to another page on using svn (I
suspect we already have this documnented somewhere - we certainly have
some svn centric pages).

Thanks - I need to go through all the existing ones and check they
still work with the changes in api in trunk. But I have many more
planned if I can just find the time....


I look forward to monitoring and taking

Good. One last comment is that it would be better (for both of us) if
you communicate via the developer and or users mailing lists as:

1) if you have questions I can answer others may be able to
2) I dont have to answer the same questions many times when they are
asked and answered in a public forum
3) My time is limited and dont always have the ability to answer
individual queries

Best regards and happy QGISSing

I was afraid you might say that. If I set up an account later, it  
will be username jctull. I will try to do that before noon my time  
(PST).

I agree with your suggestion. I emailed you directly because I was  
following the wiki and saw that you had communicated the same error  
without a clear response, but it might have been better directed at  
the dev list.

Anyway, I see that we have made the forums so it all is archived  
where it should be now. I have joined and am cc'ing this last  
response to the de forum as well.

Cheers,
John

Hi Gary and Tim,

Yes, it is only for Shapefiles through OGR.

> Hmm, then shouldn't it be disabled for other data stores ? :)

I thought it would, but you are right it is enabled also for others. I will 
change that soon. It will be easy, because QgsVectorDataProvider states in 
its capabilities if it supports that or not.

cheers,
Marco

Message-ID: <200702171024.59967.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Dear qgis developers,

You may have noticed my activities in the diagram branch in the last time. My 
progresses are quite good and I hope that it can be merged into svn head 
before 0.9 release (whenever this will be). If you like to try out the new 
feature, you may download the sources with:

 svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/diagram-branch

I'd like to give some information here about what I'm doing there. I'm also 
preparing a pdf with detailed technical description and I'll send a link to 
it to the devel list as soon as it's available.

The main technical change in the branch is the class QgsVectorOverlay. A 
vector overlay is anything on top of a vectorlayer which relates to the 
position of the features. An example of a vector overlay are diagrams placed 
on a map (for which there is an early implementation in the branch). Another 
example would be labels (but the branch still uses the current label 
implementation). 

In the diagram branch, there is the interface QgsVectorOverlay and a subclass 
of it QgsDiagramOverlay. A vector overlay stores a multimap of 
QgsOverlayObjects (basically position, bounding box and feature geometry) and 
is able to draw those objects (which is specific to subclasses). It is a 
multimap because multitype objects may have several overlay objects.

To manage the positioning of the overlay objects, there is the interface 
QgsOverlayObjectPositionManager and the subclass 
QgsCentralPointPositionManager. The idea of the position manager is that it 
may evaluate the overlay objects of one or more vector overlay together with 
the feature geometries to achieve an optimal placement. E.g. if there is a 
diagram overlay and labels at the same time, it would be great if they do not 
overlap each other and not the labels/diagrams of other features. The current 
implementation in the class QgsCentralPointPositionManager implements the 
simplest behaviour by placing the objects on the center point of a feature 
(without considerating other vector overlays). But the architecture in the 
diagram branch makes it possible to implement sophisticated placement in the 
future.

The implementation of the diagram overlay in the branch is done as plugin. For 
this, a new plugin type has been introduced (QgisPlugin::VECTOR_OVERLAY). 
Vector overlay plugins are subclasses of QgsVectorOverlayPlugin and provide a 
method for the vector properties dialog to request an input dialog suitable 
for the specific vector overlay type. So QgsVectorLayerProperties checks if 
there are any overlay plugins loaded and inserts a new tab with the specific 
dialog for each. Vector overlays could of course also be implemented as part 
of the core.

The current implementation of diagrams provides support for pie- and barcharts 
and for linear scaling of the diagram size according to a classification 
attribute. These behaviours are also extendable by implementing interfaces, 
but I don't want to bore you here with the exact details. The implementation 
does not yet support loading/saving to/from project file and does not yet 
generate an entry in the qgis legend. Once these points are solved, I will 
try to request permission for a merge to svn head. From my explanations above 
you can see that the impact of the changes on qgis core stability are minimal 
because most of the actual actions are done in the diagram plugin.


All the best,
Marco

Hi Marco

Ah I been wondering what youve been up to in that branch! So can you
generate pie charts based on the attributes in a layer? Any chance of
a screenie? :-)

	branch
Message-ID: <d368056f0702170227k5ebd45cfsa04863199f131a08@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Ive still been trying to finish getting 0.8 branch to compile under
Mac. As a recap, I am stuck with an openpty error.


/Users/tim/dev/cpp/qgis0.8/src/plugins/grass/qgsgrassshell.cpp: In
constructor 'QgsGrassShell::QgsGrassShell(QgsGrassTools*, QWidget*,
const char*)':
/Users/tim/dev/cpp/qgis0.8/src/plugins/grass/qgsgrassshell.cpp:115:

Error 1
make[1]: *** [src/plugins/grass/CMakeFiles/grassplugin.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2


The FindGRASS I am using in the branch is exactly the same as the one
in trunk. Both trunk place the following line in CMakeCache.txt:

640 //Have function openpty
641 HAVE_OPENPTY:INTERNAL=1

A diff between qgsgrassshell.cpp in trunk and the 0.8 branch shows
only this minor difference:

tims-computer:~/dev/cpp/qgis0.8/build tim$ diff
../src/plugins/grass/qgsgrassshell.cpp

Finally both CMakeList.txt 's in the plugins/grass folders have:

ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DHAVE_OPENPTY=${HAVE_OPENPTY})

Do you have any idea how I can resolve this? My apologies if you
already told me and I missed the answer!

Regards

My guess is that you are picking up util.h from geos instead of system.

Hi all

I have added -Wall  -Werrors to svn cmake now. That means that if you
are getting any warnings during build process they will be treated as
errors and the compilation will halt. Kirk (a year or more ago) and
Gavin  and I (Kirk and Gavin the main part of the work) have removed
all warnings in the source code. I've also added logic to ignore
warnings as errors behaviour for generated sources from lex / swig
etc. This has been done on a file by file basis. There were three
directories with unfixed warnings:

providers/wfs
providers/grass
plugins/grass

There is a nasty message at teh start of the comile process added by
myself to remind that these dirs at some stage need to be cleared of
warnings too. Please post back to the list if you have difficulties
compiling. You can remove this behaviour temporarily by taking out
-Werror from the top level CMakeFile.txt

Regards

Compiling with QGISDEBUG is now impossible as there are "debugger 
probes" in the code (which only exists converts to text for the 
debugger), which is now "unused variables". I propose to remove this, 
there are functions available for displyaing QStrings in gdb.

Ah good point I didnt try compiling with debug. Yes we can remove it
or use a null assignment just to ensure the var has been 'used' once.

     67      // XXX - debugger probes
     68      //const char * scope_str = scope.toLocal8Bit().data();
     69      //const char * key_str   = key.toLocal8Bit().data();
      +         scope_str = 0; //avoid compiler warnings
      +         key_str = 0; //avoid compiler warnings


But I agree we can examine these things in gdb as strings and have
less debuggy stuff floating around in the code...

Hi

Ok I resolved the issue evntually by changing the include to:

     39 #ifdef Q_OS_MACX
     40 #include "/usr/include/util.h"
     41 #else

In qgsgrassshell.cpp (in the 0.8 branch). Now 0.8 builds for me! Next
I need to work out how to run your (Toms)  scripts to make the bundle
self contained....

Hi Marco,

that's interesting work! I will surely try it out soon and investigate
the possibilities of connecting it with label placement in future.

Just to make sure if I understand well how does it work: every vector
layer has its own overlay to which it can receive some objects from
outside. Then position manager looks at the objects in overlays and
creates a placement from the information obtained from them. Is that
correct?

Do you draw the vector overlay directly to the rendered map or do you
use map canvas items?

For labeling I'd like to use this algorithm: from every feature you'll
get a set of label candidates (also with priorities). Then a conflict
graph of overlapping candidates will be created (candidate = vertex,
conflict = edge). There's a good heuristic for solving this conflict
graph, resolving in a set of labels to be drawn. Does the current
implementation fit well to this?

Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Library search paths on Linux/CMake
Message-ID: <45DA0CA3.5020406@homann.se>

The best way to set paths to libraries on Unix is using LD_LIBARY_PATH 
(when installed in non-standard place).

CMake gives another option, writing compile time search paths into the 
binaries (and libraries). I have a small patch that includes paths both 
for libqgis_core and for any other library in a non-standard place that 
is used in compiling.

I'm not sure which is the proper way to do this, so I wont commit it.

The 'old' behaviour can be had by setting 'CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH' (adv. 
option) to on in ccmake.

Above according to my tests with 0.8.

yes, overlay objects are created depending on view extent, then the method 
findOptimalOverlayPositions() of the overlay manager is called. Then all the 
overlays are drawn. This is done in QgsVectorLayer::drawOverlays.

At the moment, the objects are directly drawn on map using 
QPainter::drawImage. Though canvas items may be better for collision 
detection and manually move items around. I'm not experienced with canvas 
item, so I'm wondering if the layer order is maintained if feature geometries 
are drawn on the map, then overlay objects as map canvas items and then again 
feature geometries.

The current impementation does not yet do any collision detection or 
intelligent placement (just center point placement and drawing diagrams). But 
I hope that this algorithm can be done in future in a more sophisticated 
subclass of QgsOverlayObjectPositionManager. As this class has all the 
information about the overlay objects (basically the bounding box of the 
object and the geometry of the corresponding feature), I think it should be 
able to implement this algorithm.

Tom,

That did the trick.  QGis 0.8.0 compiles/runs fine now.  Should this be
mentioned on the geos develper list as a bug then?

I was also able to compile the svn source for QGis too, but I still have
problems with the destination libdir (cmake keeps installing to
/usr/lib, rather than /usr/lib64 as it should in my case).  I'm sure
this can be fixed somehow with the cmake configuration, but I can't seem
to figure it out.  Anyone have experience with this?

Thanks for the help,
Mike

	pluginregistry
Message-ID: <200702192221.38768.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Hi,

In svn head, qgsproviderregistry.h is in core/ directory and 
qgspluginregistry.h in app/ directory. I wanted to ask what the reason for 
this is.
Backgournd of my question is that I'm trying to restore the diagram overlay 
from project file. For this, QgsVectorLayer needs to have a pointer to the 
diagram plugin (in case it is loaded). From a pure technical point of view 
this is similar to QgsVectorLayer using QgsProviderRegistry to restore a data 
provider from project file. But because plugin registry is in app, vector 
layer is not allowed to use it, as code in core should not depend on code in 
app.
Is it possible that QgsPluginRegistry could be in core? Or is there a more 
intelligent way of getting the plugin pointer?

Thanks,
Marco

Hi

I recently changed the search path (in qgsaplication.cpp) for
resources (share, lib/qgis etc) to be relative by default and if not
found there to fall back to the prefix specified during cmake. The
reason I did this is that for the linux bundle I have been working on
the user needs to be able to install the bundle to any location and
run it. Also on mac the aplication needs to be relocateable. Is it
possible with RPATH to use a relative path for libs rather than an
absolute one? For mac I think we can reset the paths using otool
anyway. For linux bundle the launcher script sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH
prior to starting the app. So if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is still used even
with your change below I guess it should not cause any problems...

I will test a bit here on mac and see what happens after aplying your
patch and then e.g. renaming qgis.app

Tim

Hi Marco

Its no doubt because plugin registry depends on gui classes since I
recall it passes a copy of qgisapp pointer to the plugin.

Message-ID: <d368056f0702200451p44ccf0f9h2b64863f9b4d87f4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I have started a new area on the wiki at the bottom of the developers corner:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DevelopersCorner#head-6ad36d47fc9198cd4dba7c2af8f7ee858ba406b8


The idea is to document the whole process of getting a release out -
covering what needs to be done prior to tagging the source, building
source and binary packages, press notifications etc. I'm looking for
help and contributions to get this section of the wiki written. There
are a few sections:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PreReleaseChecklist
=======================================
This document will be a 'things to be done before release' checklist.
I am hoping that you will contribute your thoughts (directly to the
wiki please). I am looking for timings too so that we can e.g. get the
level of detail like this:

 1.) 1 week before release notify translators for final updates
 2.) 1 day before release email developers list with notice of intention to tag

etc. The above are bogus examples but hopefully give you the idea of
what I am looking for.  We need to document any files that need to be
modified with e.g. version number updates, changelogs etc.


http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/SourcePackagePreparation
===========================================

This page will contain the steps needed to do source code release
including naming convention for the source code release and the
commands needed to generate the release. I am looking at using cpack
extension to cmake for this which I will try to implement today.

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BinaryPackagePreparationForWindows
=====================================================

This page will document the steps needed to produce a nsis installer
package on windows (I believe this can be done with cmakes cpack too).
I will fill this in.


http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BinaryPackagePreparationForLinux
==================================================

I will document the bitrock installer bundle creation here. I am
looking for contributors to describe the exact steps to be followed
for creating rpms (various distros), debs (various distros) and
ebuilds etc. Of course we have the problem that debian stuff (and I
assume rpm stuff too) is all auto* centric so we need to somehow work
out  how to get backages build using cmake. Anyone who is building
rpms/ debs / ebuilds / ports etc please document the steps you follow
here. Creating a new distro specific page for the purpose and just
adding the link will also be fine.

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BinaryPackagePreparationForMac
================================================

I am hoping Tom and William can document the magic you do when you
create the OSX binaries. I think Tom has described the process before
on this list by I cant locate it in my archive.

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DocumentationReleasePreparation
=================================================

Otto and Stephan can you document what needs to be done to get the
documentation released? Also can you add any documentation related
dependencies to the release checklist page?

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PostReleaseChecklist
=======================================

In this page I would like to list all the web sites etc where we
promote the releases of QGIS


It will be really great to have all this info in a readily accessible
format and I thank everyone in advance who can contribute to these
documents.

My plan is to allow labels (and possibly other objects like the
diagrams) to be moved by user, so adding support to draw objects as
canvas items at later time would be good. Canvas (graphics view)
maintains Z-value for every item so items have always correct order.

Hi,

provider registry is in core library as it's needed to lookup
providers used for opening layers. But plugin registry isn't something
that we want to give to users of the libs - at least I don't see any
purpose. Moreover plugins are connected also with gui library - they
might need to access map canvas etc.

In my opinion, accessing plugins directly from core library is not
good. There must be other way how to do it. How to solve it - imagine
that the functionality is implemented directly in core library and not
in a plugin - that's also a possible case.

What about creating an interface e.g. QgsMapLayerMetadata which would
have methods readXML() and writeXML() and maybe some more. Some
classes would implement this interface to enable reading/storing some
data. Every layer could have a list of metadata - e.g. labeling
information, diagram information etc. Vector layer would not need to
care about what exactly they are, just call read/write XML function on
layer load/save. Do you like this idea?

Ok, third party apps can do QLibrary::open themselves if they need the non-gui 
functionality of a plugin.

I agree with this. Maybe we should have GUI plugins and non-GUI plugins 
somewhen in future? But for the diagram plugin now, your suggestion below 
seems to be the best way.

So the interface QgsMapLayerMetadata would be in core, but the implementation, 
let's say QgsDiagramMetadata would be in app and load the plugin in the 
method readXML()? This sounds good to me.

Thanks a lot,
Marco

Hi all,

I noticed that the function QgsSpatialRefSys::epsg() returns strange values 
for layers with user defined CRS (probably mEpsg not initialized). What 
should we do in such cases? Is there an EPSG number for unknown crs or user 
defined crs?

Thanks,
Marco

This makes sense. Providers are also an example of non-gui (or 'core'
) plugins. That way, also core library should get some kind of plugin
registry, but it's important to differentiate between the two types of
plugins (first ones would depend only on core library, second ones on
both core and gui libs).

Now, when I'm thinking about this again, I see you were right - to
avoid bad design we probably can't avoid using registry of 'core'
plugins (it would be good to find a name for them) that would be
initialized the same way as providers are and once metadata are to be
read QGIS willl look at plugins registry that will provide read/write
and some other functions.

This opens the question how to modify plugin registry handling to work
well with core/gui plugins or core-only plugins, make no difference
between C++ and Python plugins etc.

Hi (Martin)

I get the following warnings (and thus error) building trunk under windows:

In file included from C:\dev\cpp\qgis_trunk\src\gui\qgsmapcanvas.cpp:45:
C:/dev/cpp/qgis_trunk/src/gui/../core/qgsmaptopixel.h:162: warning:

Does it mean anything to you?

I think it's because this function (and some others) are defined as
inline and that doesn't make much sense - to have a function in
library and it should be inlined. In my opinion we should change them
to normal functions (and move the implementation to qgsmaptopixel.cpp)
- they're not time critical to require them to be inline.

Hi

(ubtested but should work...)


mypSymbol->setNamedPointSymbol( "svg:full/path/to/symbol.svg" );

The symbol should be one of the symbols under QGIS_PREFIX/share/qgis/svg/


Have fun

Tim

Hi

Hmm perhaps we should check if 0 is used by epsg and if not initialise
to that... Magnus do you have any thoughts on this?

Message-ID: <200702221543.47002.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Hi,

After svn update, compiling under Linux stops with an error:

/home/humarco/src/qgis/src/providers/grass/qgsgrass.cpp:424: error: ?status? 
was not declared in this scope

and in qgsgrass.cpp, there is:

#ifdef QGISDEBUG
    int status = process->exitStatus ();
    std::cerr << "status = " << status << std::endl;
#endif
    delete process;


// TODO WIN32 (lock.exe does not work properly?)
#ifndef WIN32
    if ( status > 0 ) return "Mapset is already in use.";  ---------> line 424
#endif

Can we remove status or should we just make an #ifdef QGISDEBUG around #ifdef 
WIN32?

cheers,
Marco

Hi Marco,

sorry, my bad. Should be fixed now in r6663.

Hi,

that wiki page is a bit outdated and doesn't reflect transition to
CMake build system. Good news is that CMake supports generation of
KDevelop projects. The process of creating it is similar to build
process. I will assume out-of-source build - if you're in qgis sources
dir, type:

mkdir kdevelop
cd kdevelop
cmake -G KDevelop3 ..

In that directory you'll find qgis.kdevelop project file. You can use
this in both 0.8 and trunk.

Message-ID: <d368056f0702231831n71ed25du33284dc685fab83b@mail.gmail.com>

Dear users

As you may be aware we are working on getting QGIS 0.8.1 bug fix
release out the door.  I have put up a preview build for windows at:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/qgis_setup0.8.1preview1.exe

This file will be removed again at the time of final release so please
do not make any permanent links to it. QGIS 0.8.1 will be the first of
probably several bugfix releases up until the time that QGIS 0.9 is
released. I would like to ask that your feedback about problems you
encounter is done only via the bug tracker since it is difficult to
keep track of issues when they are posted to the mailing list in an ad
hoc manner. More specifically if you encounter any new bugs please
file them against Version 0.8.1, Milestone 0.8.2 since we wont be
making any new changes to the 0.8.1 codebase (barring major show
stopper issues). The primary reason for making this preview available
is to get the installer tested and make sure everything is generally
working out the box. There are still two issues that I will try to
address before the final release of the windows installer:

- support for silent installs
- placing shortcuts into all user accounts

If you were generally able to install and use the preview release
without issue, that feedback will be most welcome on this list.

Many thanks for your ongoing support.

Regards

Dear Martin,

Thank you very much for helping to me. Your advice is working fine. 

Just I working make some UML diagrams which will be outline QGIS fundamental
mechanisms such as vector and raster layer initialization and processing
within related data provider's interactions (interoperations) and etc...
Therefore I need to debug QGIS source codes for reverse-Engineering. Are
there any interaction diagrams available (like as sequence and activity
diagrams) for QGIS core functionality?

Thanks again for your valuable hints and advices.

Best regards,
Byambaa Mendbayar

I'm not aware of any (sequence or activity) diagrams of QGIS
internals. If you'll manage to create such diagrams, that would be a
great contribution! I would advise you to use SVN trunk as it
incorporates quite a lot under-the-hood changes.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

All,
As you know, we have funds donated towards development work. We had  
planned on hiring a developer but due to schedule conflicts and  
timing, he was unable to devote much time to the release.

  I therefore propose to use a portion of the funds to award all  
developers who contributed to the release of 0.8.0. QGIS is developed  
on an entirely volunteer basis and developers have spent countless  
hours of their own time on the project. I therefore think it is  
appropriate to recognize this devotion of time (over many years for  
some folks) with a modest award.

Though imperfect, the amounts are based on the number of commits.  
While this isn't a good indicator of total time spent, it does  
represent the amount of effort an individual has put into the release.

The proposed awards are listed below (using commit name or IRC nick),  
along with the commit information:
commits |   username   | amount
- ---------+--------------+--------
      452 | timlinux     |    500
      430 | g_j_m        |    450
      307 | rblazek      |    350
      220 | mhugent      |    250
       51 | morb_au      |    100
       66 | telwertowski |    100
       76 | wonder       |    100
       16 | homann       |     50
        2 | larsl        |     50
        8 | mcoletti     |     50
        4 | perrygeo     |     50
        5 | shalasz      |     50
      187 | gsherman     |      0

The award amount is the number of commits, rounded to the nearest  
$50. All amounts are $ US.

For those committing to the documentation of QGIS, I propose $100  
each to sholl, odassau, and morb_au.

The total amount of awards is $2,400, leaving approximately $1,900  
for work towards the 0.9 release. This is a one-time award. The PSC  
must meet and decide how to use the remaining and future funds.

If you have any comments or suggestions, please submit them to the  
qgis-psc mailing list rather than qgis-dev -- or you can email me  
directly. You can find information about joining qgis-psc mailing  
list at http://qgis.org/content/view/115/96.

I plan to make the awards March 3, 2007.

Hi all.
Thanks to Leonardo Lami and Massimo DiStefano we now have quite a few
GRASS modules added to the qgis-grass plugin. They have been tested and
no issue has been found. You can download it from:
http://www.faunalia.it/download/qgis_grass_0.tar.gz
It would be good if they could be added to the next release of qgis.
All the best.

Hi Tim,

It seems as EPSG 0 is reserved for RT90 coordinate system. But we could use -1 
for initialisation.

EPSG = 0 was chosen by accindent for RT90. I'm not sure it's a good idea.

Ther are some new projections with epsg > 1000000.

It's a mess, really.

Should we stick witl epsg only?
Should we allow any proj-string without worrying about epsg at all?

Hi Martin,

I thought about gui/core plugins again. Although I like the idea from a 
conceptual point of view, I found a problem with it. If we have separation of 
gui/non-gui plugins, then a typical plugin is split into core parts and gui 
parts (in a way similar to e.g. wfsplugin/wfsprovider). But then the gui 
plugin has to know about the corresponding core plugin, and this seems to be 
a problem for portability (see 
http://lists.qgis.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2006-October/000896.html). It 
works for provider plugins because qgis core does everything related to data 
providers, so the plugin is not directly linked to the provider.

For the diagram plugin I found a solution how to read from xml without plugin 
registry. I used the signal QgisApp::projectRead(), which gives plugins the 
possibility to read plugin specific settings from project file. The plugin 
creates the diagram overlays and adds it to the corresponding vector layers 
(they can be accessed through QgsMapLayerRegistry). A problem with this 
approach is the notification of the legend that the layer symbology has 
changed. I created the method QgisInterface::refreshLayerSymbology(QString) 
for this. Maybe there is a more elegant solution for it?

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

I think this has some possible solutions:
- implement shared stuff in a library and let core/gui plugins link to
it - this seems to work with GRASS provider and plugin
- or another possibility is to develop an interface for core plugins
that would be versatile enough that it could be used by other parts of
QGIS (or other plugins) without the need to use directly the class
you're working with. As there's interface for providers which we can
consider as core plugins, there might be more interfaces for plugins
with different purposes.

I think more elegant solution might be to let map layers emit a signal
when they think their symbology has changed. Legend can connect itself
to this signals and change itself appropriately when signal has been
emitted. Do you like this idea?

This works, but it has the disadvantage that for each plugin there must be a 
piece of code in qgis core. This does not fit well with the idea of plugins.

You mean to have e.g. a plugin interface for analysis plugins? I prefer this 
possibility over the first one.

Ok, this has the advantage of keeping the interface for plugins cleaner. On 
the other hand, too much signals and slots create dependencies which are not 
explicitly visible in the program code. And this makes a program harder to 
understand. In QGIS, I find myself often doing 'grep -r -n slotname * | grep 
connect' to find out what's going on. Or I have to place a debbuger 
breakpoint to see by which signal something has been triggered. In both 
cases, it would be easier to see a method call in the program code.

Marco

Actually it doesn't have to have a piece of code in qgis core - that
shared library can be distributed separately. But I would also prefer
the second option.

Yes I mean there should be a different interface for every kind of
functionality that could be implemented by plugins. So plugin will
specify which interfaces does it implement and for every implemented
interace it will have a factory method which will create the object
and return the pointer to the interface. This means that also when one
plugin would want to use functionality of another plugin, it will ask
for the interface and will get it (or won't get it if the plugin is
not available).

You're right that usage of signals/slots make the code flow harder to
track. And probably the best would be to avoid them completely in core
library. I hope we could find some nice design patterns which are
well-suited for this situation.

One thing that comes to my mind is the usage of some of hooks. Let's
say we have a set of actions that might happen - loading a project
file or rendering progress notification might be one of them. When
plugin gets initialized, it might register itself to some actions.
Once an action happens, it goes through the list of hooked plugins and
calls them. Implementation could be done as a hooks registry which
will register and deregister the plugins for different actions. The
hook would be an interface, that would be implemented by the plugins
e.g.:
class QgsHookProjectRead
{
  void hookProjectRead( params ) = 0;
};

I don't have much knowledge in design patterns but if the amount of
hooks won't get big, this might be good solution.

The observer pattern seems to be a perfect replacement for signal/slot (see 
below)

This is a good idea. It reminds me of the 'observer' pattern in the design 
patterns book. Observer classes (in QGIS the plugins) may register at a 
subject class and they get notified by the subject when something happens. 
The book discusses several variations and it will be interesting to see what 
suits best for plugin notification.
