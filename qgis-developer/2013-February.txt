Hi Martin,

Good to see this plugin is getting some love !

Le 2013-02-01 01:26, Martin Dobias a ?crit :

Did you had a look to the OGR driver made by Even Rouault ? The use of 
PBF is possible (wayyyy smaller and faster to import) and the 
performance are quite good when working on a big osm dataset.

Yes, it's mainly used to convert the data from/to mif, tab or shp. The 
low speed is the biggest problem. Josm is powerfull but I would not 
advice it to a normal gis user as I would not for emacs, potlalch is 
limited to online editing.

hi list,

A friend of mlne warned me about the need to patch the rails engine for
security reasons. I have not checked further, as I no longer run a redmine
instance on my server, but I think it is safer to have a look for the Qgis
redmine server ?

Message-ID: <1359712999.53630.YahooMailNeo@web194705.mail.sg3.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

I am looking for some example implementation of setEditType in QGIS python plugins. The enums that do not need any additional information is just fine. However, it is unclear when it comes to enums like?ValueMap, EditRange, CheckBox etc., I want to use strings 'true' or 'false' for checkbox in place of default (1,0) and similarly want to be able to set ValueMaps and EditRanges which I am not sure how to do.

Any help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Rukmaj

Hi Robert,

I also created a standalone version of the filter symbol [1][2] but I'm 
not yet happy with it. It looks a bit "blocky" to me. Maybe the lighter 
part of the background is too intensive?

I also thought, that for the expression combined with something else, 
the "something else" part should be in the center and the expression 
icon itself could be smaller, as it's just a helper to accomplish the 
main task of selecting/filtering/defining the preview.

What do you think?

Regards,
Matthias

PS: I'll be out of office next week, so don't expect any answers from me 
then. I'm sure the two of you will make good decisions.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Dual View: Call for feedback
Message-ID: <510BCCF5.2090101@gmx.ch>

Hi everybody,

I'm pleased to announce that I've pushed the current state of dual-view 
to github [1]

Anybody interested in having a look at it is kindly requested to do so 
and share his thoughts concerning the development.

Anybody who does not want or can't compile the branch can easily have a 
look at the slides from this presentation [2] which should cover the 
basics as well (There's a small sample video to show the live filter 
inside).

Any feedback is appreciated.
If there is no strong rejection of these ideas, I'd like to request a 
merge in two weeks, after I cleaned up the code and reviewed the code 
for layers with no "feature by id" capabilities (which need to be fully 
cached).

I will be out of office next week, so please bear with me, if I only 
reply to your feedback in the second week of February.

Kind regards,
Matthias

Hi,

I am a plugin developer who was bitten by this API change. It's easily
worked around with a try...except... structure, but that becomes unneeded
clutter. I am working on a plugin that I want to work in the future API and
the stable API at version 1.8, so right now I need that clutter to make it
work in both versions.

I also have the opposite problem, that there are features in the dev API
that I want to use, but they are not in the stable API. I am thinking of
the QgsLayer.diagramRenderer() call, which is not found in the older API,
even though it is in the docs... :-)

So, I second your adding the addMapLayer() call back in, if only to keep my
code clutter down :-)

Cheers,
Angus Carr.

I wonder why this was marked as deprecated in the first place...
supposedly for keeping devs from calling addMapLayer() multiple times,
when more than 1 layer is added?
Is there a way we can make this suggestion visible, other than adding
it to the api docs?

actually it's probably easier doing something like:

if QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT < 10900:
  <use old api>
else:
  <use new api>

Message-ID: <CA+TxYvMa_=LCs-jiO3p2hA+2akt8Y=EMVq=vCwdrNm-4KdjBxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

just did a fresh build with apidocs enabled, and came across the
following warnings. I don't know enough about doxygen to fix these,
could someone look into this?

cheers
Etienne

There is now.  Apparently since python 2.7 all deprecation warnings where
disabled by default.  The messages now appear in the message log.

Hi,

I have restored addMapLayer() to the API but it is still deprecated,
so hopefully new plugins, and any updated ones, will use
addMapLayers() instead.

Cheers

I only know that it exists, I do not know much more about it. Compared
to OGR support which only allows fetching of processed features, my
approach is to allow also low-level access. With low level API you
could access the underlying topology, fetch all tags of a node/way or
access relations - I guess none of that is possible with OGR. It seems
that the main use case for OGR is just to allow conversion to a
different (more friendly) format.

And yeah, I have thought about PBF format, too. Maybe later...

Hi all,
i have a problem with new class QgsFields:

in my code i wrote:

TypeError: arguments did not match any overloaded call:

Right, the low level concepts of OSM model are not exposed through the OGR 
API, because it doesn't have support for topology.

However you could "import" ogr/ogrsf_frmts/osm/osm_parser.h, 
ogr/ogrsf_frmts/osm/osm_parser.cpp and ogr/ogrsf_frmts/osm/gpb.h in QGIS in 
order to benefit from a parser that does the parsing of OSM XML and PBF in a 
transparent way from the user point of view. If you pursue that route, I'd 
suggest that you rename (or #define) the public symbols of 
ogr/ogrsf_frmts/osm/osm_parser.h so that they don't conflict with the ones of 
OGR (in case there are later changes in OGR for example)

You should replace QgsFields with QgsField

Hi Matthias, I can't test your branch by myself (I don't have time to compile
it ), please consider many testers will give you feedback once this will be
merged in master branch and osgeo binarys. 

All this sounds very good to me, especially preparing relations 1 to many. 

I have some questions about global QGIS governing and 2.0 feature freeze
roadmap.

Before recent API break, joins really needed work to make them rock stable.
It still seemed experimental when using it a lot, and it is a critical
feature for basic cartography.  Users often give me feedback on quite hard
to reproduce-bugs (not systematic, dependant of providers also..):
 - joined table seems to be not used by graduated/category analyses
 - advanced rotation and proportion field neither.. 
 - attribute table shows NULL or ERROR values.. 
 - graduated classification process seems to lose correct min max bounds for
classification process.. 
 - an maybe more (I did create ticket, but recent API break.. broke it all..
)

So, as Paolo said recently, users really need a stable release in 2013, and
as we keep on adding features, and modifying API in the same time, this make
me anxious on future releases we rely on. We already fund bug fixing in 1.9
, I hope I will have a release that won't break those, and that won't add
mor bugs than we corrected previously. I voted For API merge without a 1.9
release with warnings on the fact that we needed to keep big new features
for 2.1. 

I would like that PSC crew gives a clear roadmap of feature freeze for 2.0,
so that we can put $$ to consolidate release candidates during spring. I'm
just asking if dual feature and 1-n relation for 2.0 or 2.1? 2.0 is OK, but
we need to clarify a 2013 roadmap (I need it as I rely on it for 300 users..
) 

If next stable release comes by the end of 2013, it will be very long for
those who already switched from proprietary worl to QGIS and still waits for
all improvements made in 1.9. And I will have trouble against people that
don't like OSS in my corp (yes they exist).  

I'm always ok to fund things and participate, but sub contracting process
prevents me to react quickly (3 months is good).. So I feel a bit incapable
to help when all goes fast out of written roadmap.. 
My 2 cents 
R?gis

Hi Even

thanks for your hints. At first I was a bit surprised that OGR
implements PBF reading without protoc compiler - I guess that's just
to avoid dependency on protobuf library, right? The small size and
high reading speed of PBF look quite promising, so maybe later I will
look at import from PBF.

attributeMap() has been replaced by attributes(), but there's
additionally an easier way how to access attributes by indices:
>>> idVar = inFeat[0]

And now there is even easier way for accessing attributes - directly
by field name:
>>> idVar = inFeat["name"]

Yes, I wanted to avoid that dependency as protocol buffer is very simple to

During the hackfest in Essen, we migrated hub.qgis.org to the Redmine package 
of Debian squeeze. Debian has released security fixes for all recent Rails 
issues.

Hi,

I did filter icon and try of placement change (select-expression) [1]. 
If we decide to follow this way I will add more of this.
At the moment I have no strong preference, which option is better.

regards,
Robert

Hi

Martin I also support your ideas. From my experience the biggest
frustration when working with OSM plugin is the unpredictability of
whether you will be able to fetch al the data in your current extent
before hitting the OSM API download ceiling.

Have you looked at using the overpass api rather?

http://overpass-api.de/

Its designed for read only applications and is very fast and reliable,
even when fetching large areas.

Regards

Tim

At the moment we are in 'standby mode' while all the side effects of
the vector provider branch are dealt with. As soon as Martin and
Juergen (who seem to be doing all the heavy lifting in this) give me
the green light that everything is 'new api' ready, I will lay out the
time table for the release.

I appreciate your desire to get 2.0 our (we all want it out sooner
rather than later), but at the same time it is a major release and it
is going to take longer to get out into the wild than a normal
release. With regards to new features coming in to the master branch,
if the features are stable and useful I think we should not discourage
people from introducing them (but accompanying unit tests would be
great!).

Hi Tim

yes that's exactly what I wanted to use for downloads :-)
Apart from not having the limit on downloaded data, it allows various
filtering options.

Hi Nathan,i tired with the name of the field:


p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; field    idVar = inFeat[field]
KeyError: 'type'

field is the name of field (in this case 'type').What am i wrong?Thanks

You need to pass the name of the column not the the index:
idVar = inFeat["somefeildname"]

	file
Message-ID: <CAPzumuG_pF3o=eCOHyrMJzWyoHrNhxCDVpc0+QLZhuVgOnPo7w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear everyone,

Are there plans to integrate some of the documentation manual into a
Qt help file?  I noticed that some of the QGIS dialogs have a help
button and others don't.  The contents in the manual is more than
sufficient to be included as a Qt help file.
I found rst2qhc [0] that converts the rst files into a qhc files.  Is
this something the dev are planning to include?

Any guidance on how to do this?  I'm familiar with rst and
documentation project but not the main QGIS application development.

Both access by index and by field name should work - if not, the
attribute is probably not loaded. How do you get the feature - what is
the select() / getFeatures() command?

You cannot use getFeatures() like this: it returns a feature iterator
which you need to use for accessing features - the state of iteration
over features is not held there, not in the provider. This is the
easiest way to use it:

for feature in vproviderA.getFeatures():
  type = feature["type"]
  # do something with type

Hi all, Werner,
I can take care of this, and some of the web site.
I would appreciate if:
* someone could mass-save all the pages, and make them available as text
somewhere, so in case of unwanted change or deletion recovering will be easy
* all pages authors would let us know which pages are still necessary.
I plan to complete this in Valmiera, if we are unable to do it before.
Thanks.

So lets sit together and do a little cleanup .. I will bring my feather

Hi Martin,
your code works fine. I used :

features = QGisLayers.features(vlayerA)
for inFeat in features:

from SEXTANTE module and it is not works properly.

so below code:


for inFeat in vproviderA.getFeatures():
       idVar = inFeat [ index ]

working fine.

Thanks

Francesco

Message-ID: <374F2A33A0F46242B3A1F52EB8A1E8B4ECDDFE35A7@EXCHMBX-V.cg67.fr>

Hi,

I'm trying to load a big ecw (36 go)  into Qgis (1.8)
The file is loading but canvas doesn't display anything (still white)

A french user told me having similar problems with ecw files larger than 4 Go still QGis 1.7 release

He has solved these problem with downloading erdas sdk ecw and replacing QGis vc80 dll's by those resulting  from erdas sdk.

Does anybody know anything about these problems and proposed solution?
Thanks

Sylvain

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to get Provider default values for each
	attribute using Python
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GCy7t5VNtoQ-K+dw9c7hmfcXg4mH1vWjs=NL3C=1gmDQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this kind of questions, has
all I see in here are much more complex debates about the actual
developping of QGIS.

I'm not very proficient neither with Python or QGIS API, but i'm trying to
create a plugin that allows one to transform a selected multipart feature
into singlepart features while editing in
QGIS?<http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/44799/how-to-transform-a-selected-multipart-feature-into-singlepart-features-while-edi>,
a very simple but useful tool while editing.

So far I manage to create the code that works with regular shapefiles, you
can see it at the end of the email.

My problem now is to make it work with Postgis layers due to the unique
values sequences. I toke a look into
QgsVectorLayer::splitFeatures<http://qgis.org/api/1.8/qgsvectorlayer_8cpp_source.html#l02334>
for
inspiration, has the objective is mostly the same, but I'm not being able
to correctly translate the code to Python that checks for a provider and
when possible replace the original attribute by the providers defaultValue

02412         //use default value where possible (primary key issue),
otherwise the value from the original (splitted) feature02413
QgsAttributeMap
<http://qgis.org/api/1.8/qgsfeature_8h.html#a54fb9a5ab4cfae301a0415ce490f08c8>
newAttributes = select_it->attributeMap();02414         QVariant
defaultValue;02415         for ( int j = 0; j < newAttributes.size();
++j )02416         {02417           if ( mDataProvider
<http://qgis.org/api/1.8/classQgsVectorLayer.html#aa84c4fb5f4fb69cbfb706403ebe5109a>
)02418           {02419             defaultValue = mDataProvider
<http://qgis.org/api/1.8/classQgsVectorLayer.html#aa84c4fb5f4fb69cbfb706403ebe5109a>->defaultValue
<http://qgis.org/api/1.8/classQgsVectorDataProvider.html#ac5390ce5f17903e642d4659b9a3ea091>(
j );02420             if ( !defaultValue.isNull() )02421
{02422               newAttributes.insert( j, defaultValue );02423
        }02424           }02425         }


I'm not being able to check for mDataProvider or getting the
mDataProvider.defaultValue(j). So far I could get to "see" the attribute
default value with the code below but I'm not sure what to do with it.

layer.dataProvider().defaultValue(0)

<PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant object at 0x0DEC5BC8>



Thanks for the help,

Alexandre Neto



My actual plugin code is this:

------------------------------------------------------------

layer = self.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
new_features = []
n_of_splitted_features = 0
n_of_new_features = 0

for feature in layer.selectedFeatures():
    geom = feature.geometry()
    # if feature geometry is multipart starts split processing
    if geom.isMultipart():
        n_of_splitted_features += 1
        #remove_list.append(feature.id())

        # Get attributes from original feature
        new_attributes = feature.attributeMap() ### Change to work with
Postgis

        # Get parts from original feature
        parts = geom.asGeometryCollection ()

        # from 2nd to last part create a new features using their
        # single geometry and the attributes of the original feature
        temp_feature = QgsFeature()
        temp_feature.setAttributeMap(new_attributes)
        for i in range(1,len(parts)):
            temp_feature.setGeometry(parts[i])
            new_features.append(QgsFeature(temp_feature))
        # update feature geometry to hold first part single geometry
        # (this way one of the output feature keeps the original Id)
        feature.setGeometry(parts[0])
        layer.updateFeature(feature)

# add new features to layer
n_of_new_features = len(new_features)
if n_of_new_features > 0:
    layer.addFeatures(new_features, False)

print ("Splited " + str(n_of_splitted_features) + " feature(s) into " +
str(n_of_new_features + n_of_splitted_features) + " new ones.")

Hi Devs,

I used the following in a python plugin to select features:

self.provider.select(self.provider.attributeIndexes(), mapCanvasExtent, 
True, True)

is there somewhere an example how to do this in the new api using

QgsFeatureIterator QgsOgrProvider::getFeatures( const QgsFeatureRequest& 
request )

and python?

If provided, I could add the info at: 
http://documentation.qgis.org/html/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/03_vector.html#iterating-over-vector-layer

(or maybe someone can update that pages instead of replying :-) )

I haven't updated the examples yet, sorry. Here we go in Python:

for f in layer.getFeatures():
  print f["name"].toString(), f.geometry().exportToWkt()

This will use give you all features from a layer with geometries and
attributes. If no request is specified in the getFeatures() call, it
will use default request which fetches everything - equal to calling
getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest()).

The getFeatures() call returns QgsFeatureIterator instance. Python
bindings of this class support python's iterator protocol [1] so you
can use it directly in a 'for' cycle as shown above. Of course it is
still possible to original C++ API style, but it does not feel very
pythonic:

f = QgsFeature()
iter = layer.getFeatures()
while iter.nextFeature(f):
  print f["name"].toString(), f.geometry().exportToWkt()

I strongly recommend the former variant - it's easier to write and
understand, so less prone to errors.

Access to attributes: there is no f.attributeMap() anymore, because
attributes are now stored in a vector (Python: list) instead of a map
(Python: dict). QgsFeature class emulates python container object [2]
so you can access attributes as if QgsFeature instance was a list or
dictionary, with keys being either field indices or field names:
f[0]  ... first attribute
f["type"]  ... attribute named "type"
It is still possible to get all attributes: f.attributes() returns a
list of values.

Attribute values are returned as QVariant's as before, so in order to
access a string attribute you need to do something like
f["name"].toString(), for integers it is the cryptic
f["speed"].toInt()[0]. At some point (before the release of 2.0) I
would like to switch QGIS to use newer PyQt4 API that does automatic
conversion of QVariant to python objects. This will cause that
f["name"] or f["speed"] will directly return a string or int without
the need to call toString()/toInt() methods).

Currently we have three types of requests: 1. no filter (default), 2.
filter by rectangle, 3. filter by feature ID.

Fetching of features within a rectangle is done this way:
rect = QgsRectangle(-10,-10,10,10)
request = QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterRect(rect)
for f in layer.getFeatures(request):
  # usual stuff here with the feature

For the sake of processing speed, some providers may return features
that are not in the rectangle (only their bounding box intersects the
rectangle). Usually this is not a problem (e.g. for rendering), but
for some cases such as identification of features in particular
rectangle this is not wanted. In old API, setting fourth argument of
select() to true returned only features that really intersected the
rectangle. In new API this is done with a flag:
request.setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.ExactIntersect)

Another type of requests are requests for a particular feature ID. In
these cases we expect just one feature so we could directly fetch just
one feature from the iterator:
request = QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFid(14)
f = l.getFeatures(request).next()

In case feature with given ID does not exist, python exception
StopIteration is raised.

If developers would like to optimize the requests to avoid fetching
things that are not required, it is possible to:
- avoid fetching of geometry: request.setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.NoGeometry)
- fetch only some (or no) attributes - e.g. fetch just first two
attributes: request.setSubsetOfAttributes([0,1])

Even though API allows that, it is currently not possible to have
concurrent feature iterators on one layer or data provider, something
like this:
iter1 = layer.getFeatures()
iter2. = layer.getFeatures()
# do something with both iter1 and iter2
This will NOT work - in the second getFeatures() call the iter1 will
get closed and it will not return any more features. In the future
some providers will support concurrent iterators, there will be
probably another provider capability that would determine if a
provider supports that.

I hope I haven't forgotten any important use case. If more examples
are necessary, I will try to provide them. Please do not hesitate to
ask if things are not clear yet.

Regards
Martin

Quick question about the support for tiled servers in QGIS. 

My first question is if data published by map box is available for use in QGIS (not sure if this is permissible under the license they provide, the website tends to talk only about javascript access).

And the second one is how you sorted out the license side of the equation for google maps access, do users fill in a google id or something?

Hi !

I've been doing some work on the Improved Polygon Capturing plugin. It now
allows to enter the angle numerically also (along with some other
enhancements).

I've contacted the original author who seemed enthusiast about the changes,
but now I've got no news of him since about one month... So it seems he's
not actively maintaining the plugin anymore.

I asked on the IRC what to do, they said it is possible to transfer the
plugin ownership.
- Can someone do that ?
- Do you think it's rude to the original author ? (since I haven't got his
clear agreement)
- How/where should I leave his name as the original author ? (is it
possible to have 2 authors in the metadata?)

Here's the plugin repo :
https://github.com/olivierdalang/improvedpolygoncapturing

Best regards,

Olivier

Hi Alexandre,

I recently used provider default values in a plugin like this..

provider = layer.dataProvider()
        f = QgsFeature()
        
        #On the Fly reprojection.
        if layerCRSSrsid != projectCRSSrsid:
            geom.transform(QgsCoordinateTransform(projectCRSSrsid,
layerCRSSrsid))
                                    
        f.setGeometry(geom)
        
        # add attribute fields to feature
        fields = layer.pendingFields()

        # vector api change update
        if QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT >= 10900:
            f.initAttributes(fields.count())			
            for i in range(fields.count()):
                f.setAttribute(i,provider.defaultValue(i))
        else:
            for i in fields:
                f.addAttribute(i,  provider.defaultValue(i))

Ok, I've looked into fixing this (and have a couple of ideas), but need a
clarification first:

Is mFields[i].originIndex (where mFields is a QgsFields vector) the same
index used for the keys in QgsFieldMap?

In other words, will this new method, QgsFields::toQgsFieldMap(), function
correctly [0]? If so, I can use it to attempt to auto-convert
QgsFieldMap-index-based data defined properties over to field-name-based
properties, without having think about reintroducing any QgsFieldMap
functionality at the provider level.

If adding that method is a reasonable approach, do I need to filter the
added fields in any way (e.g. by FieldOrigin)?

No, it's not the same thing. "originIndex" is a mapping from layer's
attribute indices to provider's indices. That's needed when one or
more fields have been removed in layer's editing mode (and also used
for identification of joined attributes). For example, if you have a
layer with attributes attr1, attr2, attr3 and you decide to delete
attr2, the index of attr3 will change from 2 to 1, but the originIndex
will stay the same. Before new API merge, if an attribute was deleted
in editing mode, indices would not change (because holes were
allowed).

That wouldn't help, because the numbering of fields has been changed
on provider level (e.g. a provider used to return indices 0,1,3, now
it returns 0,1,2), so I am afraid there's no simple way to establish
mapping of attribute indices from old API providers to new API
providers (because some have changed, others haven't).

Hi Martin,

THANKS! for this very thorough answer! I think it would be a pity to let 
it rest here in the dev-list, we should put it somewhere in he 
cookbook/wiki I think.

Bringing me to the question: how to handle the versioning in the 
cookbook. As it is mostly your book (isn't it?) what do you prefer.
Leave current cookbook in 'manual_en_v1.8' branch as is, and REPLACE the 
old vector select way in the 'master' branch?
Or should we write up both ways in one cookbook?

At the moment it seems to me that we are only building the manual_1.8_en 
branch (on documentation.qgis.org) (I will discuss this in a next email).

And thanks for you vector work also!!

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

No stretch for this ecw.

What tool did you use to generate your 92 Go ECW file?
We used ER mapper, and smaller files generated with are loading perfectly...

It makes sense to branch 1.x cookbook off master and keep in master
only what is valid in 2.0 to avoid further confusion. Then we will
just need a second instance of the cookbook for online viewing. To
avoid breakage of links from other sites, cookbook for 1.x should stay
at the same URL and cookbook for 2.0 should get a new URL.

Thanks for the explanation. Figured it wouldn't be that simple. So, is it
worth the effort to fix this (the 1.8 to 2.0 index issue)? I think many
users will find manually updating their data defined mappings, for every
layer in a project that has them, very annoying. This has the potential to
become a very large time-sucking problem for many users.

Could a lightweight QHash<old index, field name> be populated inline with
the current building of the attribute vectors; only for those providers
that would be different than before? The only-used-for-reads QHash could be
used to create an auto-update routine for data defined mappings. Is
something like that reasonable to implement? Is there another approach, or
any at all?

Larry

As far as I know, it should be a problem only in data-defined new
labeling - field names are used in other places.

I think a real problem is there just with postgis layers - if I'm not
wrong, the holes in 1.x are appearing when geometry column is not at
the end of the list of fields, so for a layer with columns geom,
attr1, attr2 you would get attribute indices 1,2. As you can see,
implementing such mapping would be dependent on table structure. The
problem is that the stored indices get broken even with a change of
table structure - so even if we implemented some backward
compatibility for postgis (that would take table structure into
account), it might still cause problems.

Yes, definitely they should be moved to field-name-based data defined
mappings. Even doing that, though, will require a means of auto-conversion
(like with api change) to properly map the old index value to its field
name, only once, to migrate over.

I understand, as this is the case with most of the labeled layers in my
PostGIS projects. Many are created from shapefile imports, then the
specialized labeling fields are added. Geometry column is basically never
the last one. All of those layers are at least partially messed up, data
defined-wise.

My thoughts are to use that QHash in
QgsPalLayerSettings::_readDataDefinedProperty to convert the stored field
index property to its field name when the value is found to be an integer
(indicating old-style index stored). I would also be saving the new field
name mapping in a different property built off of the enum's literal string
value, e.g.

key="/labeling/dataDefined/Bold" value="label_bold"
  instead of
key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty1" value="9"

erasing the old index-based property on successful write of the new one. If
the QHash is empty, then the current stored index value can be 'trusted' to
map to the proper field name, i.e. provider never had holes to begin with.
Does that make sense to you? Any ideas on adding such a backward
compatibility QHash to the base data provider and implement it in just the
postgres provider (unless there are others that had QMap hole issues)?

Of course, regardless of adding an auto-conversion, if the user adjusts the
table structure before the conversion is done there will be messed up field
mappings, just like before. Since the conversion should only happen once on
the first opening of the <2.0 project file (only time the QHash is used),
there is a high likelihood the auto-conversion will transparently work with
no issues. Then, the QHash fix can be deprecated sometime in the future.

Also, moving to field name-based data defined mappings should allow join
tables to function better for such mappings.

Regards,

Larry

Dear Nathan and Marco,

For a client I'm looking at the options for collecting data on a Samsung
Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 (Android), for later use in Qgis. I'm new to mobile
devices (other than gpses...) but comfortable with Qgis. What they would
like is a survey form that lets you:
1. take a picture at the location
2. capture the coordinates
3. enter some additional observations
It should be suitable for use by people with NO computer experience apart
from using a simple mobile phone (Tanzanian farmers).

I got the impression that Natan's Qmap should be able to do this, but is
not yet available for Android, am I correct? And that this depends on when
Marco gets Python to work with Android? When could a working version that
can do what my client needs to do be expected? (To speak with the
Tanzanians 'any time from now'?)

If it would help/speed up things by having the client contribute, what kind
of contribution would they be looking at? They might have some budget, but
I have no idea how much.

I'm willing to help test intermediate and more final versions myself and in
the field.

If this is not going to be available in the near future, does anyone have
alternatives (apart from entering the data manually in qgis later)?

Thanks,
Janneke

 couple of hours of work. I would assume I am not the only one. Luckily, 
 the cadastral map is just linked (embedded layers) and not duplicated.

 The more annoying thing is that QGIS crashes frequently because of 
 these bad mappings. I had projects where QGIS crashed before I had an 
 oppurtunity to fix the mapping. I went into the .qgs file, fixed it in 
 the text editor and it was fine.

 So I would really appreciate if the data-defined labeling and symbology 
 could use the column name instead of a numerical index. This way one 
 could also more easily change the underlying tables should it be 
 required.

 Thank you - Larry and Martin for fixing these issues!

 Andreas

I implemented this in a very simple manner in a feature branch [0], which
is also available as a patch [1]. Using the following in PyQGIS console,
with a PostGIS layer selected:

pv = iface.activeLayer().dataProvider()
pv.palAttributeIndexNames()

returns for my test layer...

{0: PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'id'),
2: PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'Label_Text'),
3: PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'Label_FontSize') ... }

which matches previous index-to-name mapping (geom column is index #1) and
can be used to fix the issue with QgsPalLabeling, make an auto-updating
function, and move to field name mappings. If run on a layer not PostGIS,
it returns an empty QHash, implying the fix is not needed for the provider.

However, I don't want to mess with data providers without sound advice from
those in the know. :^)  Please let me know if such an approach is a
reasonable solution, I'm missing something, or you have a better idea.

Janneke,
for what you want to do, Qgis is total overkill. YOu need something easy to
use and much smaller. Have a look at the Open Data Kit
(http://opendatakit.org/) especially the collect application which run on
Android  The ODK was made for exactly the purpose that you have in mind.

Regards,
Devdatta

As I see it, it seems to be ok!

Just pay attention, I pull another request
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/421
I changed the behavior of the identify methods: it returns the results 
instead of saving them in a private attribute.

I think I will just need to use the merge tool one more time.....

Also, your changes to the raster result structure made me think that we 
could use a single struct for both vector and raster result.
It might be easier to look into the results.
Any opinion on this? Nathan?

Well, the idea is that the first mode of identification (i.e. active 
layer) should not be used if a list of layers is given as argument. 
Indeed, if a list is given, the method will look in all the layers.

I don't understand why you added an identify method in 
qgmaptoolindetifyaction in app.

are you on irc or something so we can discuss?

Hi,
I have a problem with nightly version of QGIS... After update there are no 
EPSG coordinate systems, but only IGNF. 
When I downgraded QGIS to version 1.8 - then everything was ok - there were 
EPSG CS.. So I thought, that problem were solved and I installed version 
1.9... And EPSG changed with IGNF...

Does anyone have same problem? I don't know is it some bug or is it problem 
with my computer?

(I'm on kubuntu 12.10, 32 bit)

I am merging your changes with the pull request.
I can't finish that now and will restart tomorrow morning.

Please do not change anything in gui/identifymaptool and 
app/identifymaptoolaction, it's quite the mess to solve the conflicts.

Better, I think.

I believe, that It would be better to pass results to the dialog in
the original hierarchical structure instead of splitting them to
individual results and then reconstruct the tree searching for the
layer it should go into. For rasters the logical structure may vary
form one level for raster values (I would prefer to put band values
directly into layer item instead of adding additional level "feature")
to four levels for WMS with layer-sublayer-featuretype-feature.

Maybe some parts of QgsMapToolIdentify::identifyVectorLayer and
QgsMapToolIdentify::identifyRasterLayer, those related to creation the
tree in dialog should better be moved to QgsIdentifyResultsDialog?
I'll possibly add QgsRasterIdentifyResult and the dialog could work
directly with that or to use current QList<QVariant> returned from
raster identify().

It somehow appeared there during the merge because you have moved
qgsmaptoolidentify.h to qgsmaptoolidentifyaction.h my changes in
qgsmaptoolidentify.h were merged to it, I think. Removed.

I have not checked for that, but you can exchange the srs.db with all 
CRS information between the QGIS versions without having to de-install 
the whole version.
On Windows it is in apps/qgis/resources, might be similar on linux.

Hi Radim,

I just finished the work thanks to Jef's debugging ability!

Here is the pull request
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/421

The identify method now returns directly the IdentifyResults instead of 
using a private attribute.
Also, IdentifyResult is now a single struct (no RasterResult and 
VectorResult)

Everything compiles fine and I tested it.
However, could you check that everything is ok regarding to the 
rasterChanged?

Also, could you take care of accepting the pull request?

Thanks,

Denis

Hi all.
Just finished a presentation on QGIS server, Web Client, and LizMap on 
http://geomorfolab.arch.unige.it/genova2013/
Apparently well received.
Thanks to the devs.
I think they'll put the slides online soon.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] FW: Geometric Network Analysis Tools
Message-ID: <005701ce053c$dade4720$909ad560$@com>

Dear List,

After doing some extensive search on Geometric Network Analysis (GNA) FOSS
Tools and software, I can say that I stand a bit confused. Not so much about
what I am capable of doing, but more so about what is the best way to do it.

To start, I am posting my latest Q&A to the list:

Hello,

 

> Given a Point Cloud (either a file or a stream) that represents 

> positions, speed and direction of a vehicle fleet (TAXIs in my case), 

> and a graph (geometric network) that represents roads and 

> intersections, I want to be able to do the following:

 

Your problem will probably be best answered through PostGIS queries, which
you can then visualize with QGIS, and/or a custom web-based application.

 

Let's say you have a table taxi_position like this, where position is a
point geometry :

 

| gid | taxi_id | speed | pos_time | position |

 

>     1. Track down the route of any single vehicle, as a succession of 

> points on the network.

 

Group by taxi_id, order by pos_time and make a line with the resulting
points.

 

>     2. Calculate the total passes of vehicles through any given point or 

> segment of the network.

 

Join your segment (or node) network with your taxi_position table, allowing
a tolerance around the segment/node (st_dwithin will do the trick), then
group by taxi if you want to consider each vehicle only once.

 

>     3. (Not as urgent as the above) Find the nearest TAXI to a random 

> point on the network.

 

With PostGIS > 2.0, use KNN-search to do it fast as light. Otherwise, use
st_dwithin with growing values for the search radius.

 

> All of the above need to be FOSS-based solutions.

check.

 

> Although I am willing and ready to program plugins or algorithms to do 

> the above tasks, I am not really into re-inventing the wheel, so my

>     A) Are there any libraries or plugins that handle the above tasks?

That would be a few SQL queries then.

Use QGIS as visualization tool, and PostGIS as a backend, and you're set for
hundreds of millions of positions without problem (well, do not visualize
everything at once).

You're welcome

 

Vincent

The above answers cover most of my questions, but trying to be more specific
to my task, which includes network attribute callibration, it is essential
that I get a better knowledge and understanding of the following concepts
that I need for my work to be considered excellent:

1) Geometry extraction: Given a random point (either vehicle signal node or
checkpoint), I want to be able to connect it to the network, but only after
doing some tests, like proximity ("What is the distance of the point from
the nearest edge?") and direction ("Is the orientation of the vehicle's
movement compatible with the orientation of the network edge I am trying to
connect to?" - this only applies to vehicle signals). So the questions that
arise are:

- How exactly are new points/nodes, which generally don't belong to one of
the edges, connected to the network?

- After they are connected, can we somehow (eg. with a query or
programmatically) get the geometry of the edge at the specific point where
the connection actually happens (coordinates of the point and tangent
direction of the edge at the specific point could do the trick)?

2) New point (temporary) connection: In QGIS's Network Analysis Library it
is possible to "tie"/"connect" new nodes to the graph/geometric network.
What is exactly (or even approximately) the mechanism, under which this is
done? How do other GNA libraries handle this? I am trying to figure this out
in relation to the analysis I am trying to do (and which is explained
above).

3)A short list of what I am trying to do: The program I am trying to design
should be able to do the following, given a stream of vehicle signals and a
geometric network of the roads of a city:

                - Read a new vehicle signal. Decide if it is "legitimate",
then "assign" it to the network ("Assign" = Determine a point on a network
edge, where the vehicle most probably is moving - "Legitimate" = Signal that
contains correct position information and complete information on the rest
of the attributes of the vehicle's movement (speed, direction, Vehicle ID
etc.)

                - Log the above information as persistent data, that can be
retrieved eg. using SQL.

                - Calculate, log and visualize the movement of each vehicle.
This could be done eg. by successive routing between "assigned" signals of a
particular vehicle.

                - Given a point on the network (either original node or a
"new" node on an edge) determine if the route of the taxi passes through
this point.

I know this is a lot, and maybe I am posting in the wrong direction, but I
think this can benefit all of the GIS community. If some work has already be
done on the above issues (which I am sure it has), I would like to know in
what direction to search (eg. I am sure trivial car navigator software
covers the first issue from 3). If not, I am willing to do the relevant work
and research, but as I state above, I don't need to reinvent the wheel, and
thus I need some starting points.

If all goes well, I hope I will be able to publish a relevant toolbox/plugin
to share with the community.

Always at your disposal and thank you in advance,

PS: I am always open to discussions and/or prospective cooperations. Feel
free to drop me a line, though I think the list is the best place for
technical discussions.

PPS: Through my research I have come to the conclusion, thought it might
only be a personal conception of the state of the art, that although many
FOSS tools handle the concept of network analysis, they mostly focus on the
graph analysis part, and neglect the geometry part. Do you feel this is so
or do you think I am missing something? I am sure the building parts are all
out there, but some engineering work has to be done to bind them all
together. I will do (among others) some research and modeling work and will
let you know if and when I come to any conclusions.

Paolo,

Tonnes of thanks for fighting the good fight.

During the past three week we successfully installed QGIS Server, Web
Client and Desktops with the PNG Power Limited in Papua New Guinea. On
the same  note the same setup will be implemented with the Solomon
Islands.

Best regards from the Pacific Islands,

Edwin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Dual View: Call for feedback
Message-ID: <CAJg9Up6jegr31T+vaTE_6XE-vf+xiSC1snR51awT0XgLUEwDwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Matthias

I wanted to see how custom edit forms will be integrated with the dual
view, in particular a few forms that I use quite a lot (see [1] and [2]).
Therefore I tried to build qgis from your dual-view source but I must have
done something wrong. I got qgis running but when I load a vector layer I
get these warnings:
Warning: Object::connect: No such signal QgsVectorLayer::layerModified(
bool )
Warning: Object::connect:  (receiver name: 'QgisApp')

When I try to open the attribute table an exception pop-up says "Syntax
error, unexpected $end". The terminal shows:
Warning: Object::connect: No such signal QgsAttributeTableView::progress(
int, bool & )
Warning: Object::connect:  (sender name:   'mTableView')
Warning: Object::connect:  (receiver name: 'QgsAttributeTableDialog')
Warning: Object::connect: No such slot QgsAttributeTableDialog::finished()
Warning: Object::connect:  (sender name:   'mTableView')
Warning: Object::connect:  (receiver name: 'QgsAttributeTableDialog')
Warning: QLayout: Cannot add null widget to
QVBoxLayout/mAttributeEditorLayout

I guess this is my fault not being able to build correctly from source and
I will probably not spend more time trying. Still, I thought I would give
you this short report and also point out that we are a few users that are
highly interested in how the dual view will integrate with custom edit
forms. Perhaps there could be an extra slide in your presentation that
gives an example of that?

kind regards
Josef

Just a quick note to let you know I've committed work on this [0] and it
functions for my PostgreSQL/PostGIS project layers, as well as others.
Pre-2.0 projects should now open with data defined fields still correctly
mapped. I also implemented the field name-based properties for
QgsPalLabeling and updated several tools.

Please test with some of your pre-vector api project files and let me know
if you still get any crashes, or there are any data defined-related issues.
If so, please make a ticket and I'll work on it ASAP.

NOTE: Save As... when testing. Overwriting you older project files will
lead to loss of the old-style data defined properties (and their related,
though probably broken, field indices).

There may be some other labeling tools that need updated to work with the
new name-based properties or vector api. Along the way I noticed there are
now issues with the Unpin/Pin and Show/Hide label tools. Will work on those
next.

Hi all.
When drawing a rectangle from the Clipper from GDAL Tools, the top line
is not shown.
If confirmed, I can open a ticket.
Thanks.

I haven't really followed this, but I assume this does not affect
existing plugins which use  QgsRasterDataProvider::identify() such as
e.g. the value tool plugin?

Thank you Vinayan.

Based on your code, I was able to make it work like this:

new_attributes = layer.pendingFields()
for j in new_attributes:
    if provider.defaultValue(j).isNull():
        new_attributes[j] = feature.attributeMap()[j]
    else:
        new_attributes[j] = provider.defaultValue(j)

And I will try to use On Fly Reprojection too.

Thanks again,

Alexandre Neto

Hi Josef,

Thank you for testing

Custom edit forms should integrate nicely with dual view (Custom 
.ui-forms or Drag and drop forms).

You can ignore all these warnings, they shouldn't harm. As far as I can 
see, the exception points to the real problem connected to qgsexpression.
In the feature list, the preview text uses qgsexpression and tries to 
display by default (in this order)
- display field ( vector layer property )
- primary key (in case of multiple pk's separated by a comma )

Maybe your display field name has special characters (spaces...)?

Would it be possible to let me have a look at the qgs-File you loaded?

Regards,
Matthias

Hi Josef,

I fixed an issue which could be responsible for the problem you described.

The mentioned popup also appeared if there is a) no display field 
defined and b) no primary key defined. In this case the list will now 
display all fields, separated by a comma.

Regards,
Matthias

Hi Olivier,
godd you're keeping this useful plugin alive.
IMHO you can go ahead leving the original author name, and listing yourself as
maintainer.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Extra map canvas redraws
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-ORgvKd8ANL8Y55g3CuoGzz0oD+ojC9eLt8F2ZpAv3pQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In an effort to help debug and reduce excessive canvas redraws, I added an
option to Options->Rendering (at bottom) to show canvas redraw events in
the Log Message panel [0]. It times the redraw as well.

Also useful for basically debugging issues when users note long redraws, by
helping to determine if it is the redraw or something else by comparing the
timed redraw to the actual wait.

There are currently quite a few possibly unnecessary canvas redraws [1][2]
and maybe more. It would be good if someone started in on fixing when these
redraws should occur.

Should I rename the log output and option to canvas 'redraw' instead of
'refresh'? I think maybe so.

Hi,

Sorry for jumping in on this old thread. Wouldn't it be a really useful
addition to QgsGeometry class? The current union is extremely slow when
large number of geometries are processed. I also think this could be the
real issue in slow dissolve in ftools.

I recently used this on my plugin. Roughly it is around 10 times faster then
normal union. I hope we can introduce a new union method without breaking
the existing union.

Thanks
Vinayan

I assume, you are talking about the gradient color ramp here. I tried
setting 95% and 100%. Both worked out fine. The classes had different
colors as expected.

If it is something else, kindly post how to replicate.

I confirm this. I am working on a fix for this one. Should be in master in

Hi all.
Sorry I know little about Windows; I think if possible keeping the possibility of
installing without admin rights would be very good. In many corporate environments
installing as admin requires lots of complications, so the non-admin install proved
an effective tool for QGIS success in these situations.
Has this been changed recently? In case, can this be reverted?
All the best.

 Replying to [comment:9 lpinner]:

 -http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/304 which likely causes permissions
 issues when not run as Admin on an existing OSGeo4W install where all
 files would require Admin privileges to modify.

 thanks for the hint.

 I suggest some short note about this somewhere in website/wiki/trac and
 then to close the ticket.

Please see the attached xml: I hade a green to blue ramp; I added firsta a 50%
(orange) stop, then a 100% (yellow) one, and the 50% is overlooked.

Hii
I'm using osgeo4w installer running from .bat file like this:

@echo off
set __COMPAT_LAYER=RUNASINVOKER
start "" "C:\path\to\osgeo4w.exe"

But I agree that this is not optimal solution and osgeo4w should run without
admin rights.

No. Not yet. I am still thinking about some class for identify results
instead of QVariant but I  want to keep it KISS at the same time.
Unfortunately the results may be really varied: double value, list of
feature lists, html, text.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Dual View: Call for feedback
Message-ID: <CAJg9Up67MhZ2h5ogQOUBHybcRF-cJdYrkCKgJE45js4Gk0CqKA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Matthias

It works fine now. The warnings remains unchanged but I can open the
attribute tables for vector layers without a defined display field.

As you said, custom edit forms integrate quite nicely, at least if they are
well designed to start with. I had a few forms which did not fit too well
into the dual view window but I will just change from horizontal to
vertical layout and everything will be fine.

My overall impression is that it looks nice and that the dual view will be
a great enhancement.

One thing that confused me a bit is that my selection in the map, which
corresponds to the same selection in the classic attribute table, is not
seen in the new 'feature list vew' (what is it called?). I can see there
are advantages with this approach but I think it would cause less confusion
if there was the same selection in all three 'vews': map-attribute
table-feature list. See this [1] example where a user may be mislead to
fill in data for well02 since that is selected on map, or well01 since that
is highlighted in the list.

I also thought of another possible enhancement related to non-spatial
tables. When I have a table loaded into qgis as a non-spatial vector layer,
then I use the plus sign in the attribute table to add features - and an
edit form pops up. I think it would be nice if that edit form showed up in
the new attribute table feature list view instead. Because, when it comes
to non-spatial data, I see no reason to have that edit form pop-up on the
of the map view. (But of course this is the preferred behaviour when adding
new features to a spatial layer.)

Anyway, the dual-view seems like a great improvement and I appreciate that.
Thank you!

Regards
Josef

Confirmed,

but it doesn't need to be a point layer or to use an empty field,
it is pretty easy to replicate the issue also with other geometries, where
for example in one field there is just one value and the rest are nulls.

I still call it "feature list" but if you have a good idea, please let 
me know. (In code the name QgsFeatureList is already used for 
QList<QgsFeature>, so it would be good in order to prevent confusion)

Yes, it seems that there is still a problem and room for discussion.

Problem:
It seems, that the selection on the map and in the list is not always in 
sync yet. So in your case either well01 should be selected in the list 
and the map or in either of them. I'll have a look at this asap.

Discussion:
The selection and the currently edited feature both need to be 
highlighted in the feature list. The icon and selection could be 
switched (so, as the icon indicates the selection status and the list 
selection the currently edited feature).
My feeling was, that the blue selection should be used to indicate the 
same thing in the table and the list. But opinions are divided here.
Another reason for keeping it that way is, that all the complex 
selection handling (mouse-drag, ctrl-press, shift-press etc.) is done by 
Qt for the list selection, while for the icons it has to be reimplemented.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] featureAtId replacement
Message-ID: <5118FE46.2040101@gmail.com>

Hi Martin, hi all,

Having a feature ID, I'd like to get the corresponding feature. Here is 
what I wrote in python:

         freq = QgsFeatureRequest()
         freq.setFilterFid(myID)
         features = []
         for f in layer.getFeatures( freq ):
             features.append( f )
         if len( features ) != 0:
            return features[0]

which quite heavier than the previous

f = QgsFeature
if layer.featureAtId(self.subset[i],f):
    return f


Is there anything I missed? Anything lighter to write?

Thanks a lot,

Denis

if this issue relates to http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6817, the crash happens
with any kind of vector layer. I attached a patch there which has worked
for me !

Paolo,

You should not add a stop at 100%. In this case, the final blue color
(at 100%) is masked by your custom stop at 100%. Try with a smaller
value (75, 95), it works as expected. See attached screenshot

I understand this, but:
* we should prevent an user to insert a wrong value
* why is the intermediate stop (@50%) disappearing?
Thanks.

I'd write:

f = QgsFeature()
if layer.getFeatures( QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFid( self.subset[i] ) ).nextFeature( f ):
  return f

I would like to add a convenience QgsFeatureRequest constructors that
would save people some typing - one for filtering by FID, another for
filtering by rectangle, so it would get a bit lighter:
layer.getFeatures( QgsFeatureRequest( fid ) ).nextFeature(f)
-or-
f = layer.getFeatures( QgsFeatureRequest( fid ) ).next()
(StopIteration exception would be thrown if the FID wouldn't exist)

I have been thinking also about providing convenience getFeatures()
call, for even shorter syntax:
layer.getFeatures( fid ).nextFeature(f)

For a direct replacement of featureAtId() calls I have thought also
about adding getFeature() convenience call, that would return first
feature of a request:
f = layer.getFeature( fid )

Opinions?

Martin

I would welcome short-hands for common use-cases.
The only thing is, that for layer.getFeatures (plural) passing an array 
of id's seems more natural to me, while layer.getFeature( fid ) returns 
one feature only.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Saving to a DBF
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7yZZN1wp5=ew8dff5=4EjB_74Lhf3vveYGPyVhBhyXtBg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have been trying to find out how to programatically save the
attributes table of a vector layer to a dbf from QGIS, since this is
likely the best option for an intermediate format between SEXTANTE and
external applications. Anyone can give me a hint about it? It should
be possible, since shp is supported

Some plugins export to csv, but I haven't seen any of them exporting to dbf.

Thanks in advance!

Hi Victor,Why not to save attributes to CSV format? I think it's more
portable format. If you want to save also field types you can use  .csvt
<http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_csv.html>  file.RegardsPiotr

Piotr

thanks for the suggestion. The reason why I want to save to dbf is
mainly because that is what SAGA uses for tables, so if the input is
not a shapefile, it has to be exported to it before passing to SAGA
from SEXTANTE (currentyl, it won't work with tables in a different
format)

CSV is much easier to implement, and better as an exchange format
probably, but some apps are limited in that, and SAGA is one of the
main providers behind SEXTANTE, so it would be good to have that
conversion implemented

Anyway, many thanks!

Hi, csv huge drawback is that it can't deal with fields with carriage return
inside..  I agree, dbf is the only, but very old, database typed file
format, with indexes support. sqlite is a great alternative, but it is not a
import - export format known in spreadsheet or other desktop tool dealing
with datas. 

but, great drawback, it requires very short field names (10 chars) and 9
char on file name (for the most restrictive tools.. like the old xbase in
Office 2010 tools..

Save the table like you do for shapefiles (I suppose Sextante uses the
QgsVectorFileWriter
class with "ESRI Shapefile" as driver)
but pass NoGeometry  as geometry type (or maybe the wkbType
for NoGeometry).

It should create the DBF without the associated SHP.

Cheers.

Looks good.  I would like to propose that once this in merged in and tested
that we move into the core as a built-in function not as a plugin.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Several errors
Message-ID: <33B0DFB8-14E5-4DC7-A548-47D3716930C5@gmail.com>

Dear all,

OSGeo Korean chapter carried out a 5 day open source GIS training program including 1.5 day QGIS training several days ago. 

During training, I found several errors &  like follows.

1. Plugin installation failure occurred when user account name is in Korean. With Korean user account name, we couldn't install any plugin. If user account name is in English, that's ok. 

2. In GDAL Georeferencer plugin, if output raster file path includes Korean path name and then this pop up the info window showing "Failed to compute GCP transformation: Transform is not solvable" If file path is in English, that's also ok. 

3. QGIS Master version stil doesn't reflect the current EPSG info, that is very essential to Korean QGIS users. So, Korean users had to update the qgis.db & srs.db manually during the training. Actually I raised this issue and opened a ticket around 2 month ago. http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6820 However nothing updated so far. As far as I know crssync should sync with GDAL automatically during installation, however it seems not to work. Is it a bug of crssync?

We used QGIS master version released in January mainly on Windows and Mac, Ubuntu. 

regards, 

Sanghee

+10 ;)

f = layer.getFeature( fid )
getFeatures( [fids] ).nextFeature( f )
  getFeatures( rect ).nextFeature( f )

I think these 3 would be really welcome!

Hi GSoC mentors and org admins,

We've announced that we're doing Google Summer of Code 2013 [1]. Yay!

If you would like to help spread the word about GSoC, we have presentations [2],
logos [3], and flyers [4] for you to use. Please host meetups, tell your friends and
colleagues about the program, go to conferences, talk to people about the program,
and just generally do all the awesome word-of-mouth stuff you do every year to
promote the program.

The GSoC calendar, FAQ, and events timeline have all been updated with this year's
important dates, so please refer to those for the milestones for this year's program.
NB: the normal timeline for the program has been modified for this year. You'll
probably want to examine the dates closely to make sure you know when important
things are happening.

Please consider translating the presentations and/or flyers into your native language
and submitting them directly to me to post on the wiki. Localization for our material
is integral to reaching the widest possible audience around the world. If you decide
to translate a flyer, please fill out our form to request a thank you gift for your
effort. [5]

If you decide to host a meetup, please email me to let me know the date, time, and
location so I can put it on the GSoC calendar. Also, remember to take pictures at
your meetup and write up a blog post for our blog using our provided template for
formatting [6]. If you need promotional items for your attendees, please fill out our
form [7] to request some; we're happy to send some along. We can provide up to about
25 pens, notebooks, or stickers and/or a few t-shirts. Please keep in mind, though,
that shipping restrictions and timeline vary country-to-country; request items early
to make sure they get there on time! If you have questions about hosting meetups,
please see the section in our FAQ [8].

Please consider applying to participate as an organization again this year or maybe
joining as a mentor for your favorite organization if they are selected this year.

We rely on you for your help for the success of this program, so thank you in advance
for all the work you do!

In your bug report, you should specify which EPSG-code you want to use, 
and why the EPSG-codes available are not useful for you. We have over 
55000 EPSG-codes, and most of the developers have never worked with 
Korean data. So they need a bit assistance from your side.

Normally, crssnc should synchronize QGIS database with GDAL's csv-data. 
If the setup breaks at some stage, this synchronisation will fail. For 
QGIS Lisboa Windos standalone, this happens when there are blanks in 
installation folder names. Maybe Korean user names have the same effects.

Look out for postinstall.log for error messages. If successfull, you 
will find:

Hi Paolo,

Is there a resume of last year achievement ? I remember one GsoC about 
vector simplification, what was the output ?

Hi Jean,

if I'm not wrong, three projects were successful (symbology
improvements, threading support and other improvements in sextante
and QGIS Android) and one failed (vector simplification).

Confirmed here. However, my feeling is that last year was less
successful than previous ones, so I'd suggest to keep a keener eye on
the process this year.
All the best.

Creating the QgsFeatureRequest implicitly in getFeatures blocks the other
options (restricting the attributes, no geometry...).

I like the explicitness of the new interface.  No more "what was this
true/false for again"?  Optionally adding those to getFeatures, would
reintroduce that.

Maybe the current interface just takes a bit of getting use to?

Having multiple constructors for QgsFeatureRequest (rect, fid, fids) however
sounds acceptable ;)

Why not keep featureAtId with the old interface on top of the new api then?
And we still need to know if that feature actually exists...

Message-ID: <CABKNoMdWxdD4LMuZD_PVu=_Q0mJ1j6nJ0v8dPEapKXSD0T7CGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all.
Is there a way to call a C++ plugin function from a python plugin?
I have a python plugin that I want to have do something that is already
implemented in one of the C++ plugins.

I just don't see any examples to copy from.

Cheers,
Angus Carr.

Basically I don't think it's the problem of Korean SRS but I believe it's the problem of crssync. Anyway I would like to answer to your inquires. 

1. Current srs.db missed EPSG code from 5167 through to 5188. This means current srs.db missed at least 22 newly updated EPSG codes from EPSG ver 7.9 or ver 8.0. When I run 'epsg_tr.py 5167 5188', I can clearly get the full CRS information from GDAL. However I couldn't see those CRSs from QGIS. Would you please test it out whether your QGIS contains EPSG code from 5167 to 5188?

2. Actually we already got many issues regarding this SRS info from inside & outside of Korea. And we distributed patched srs.db & qgis.db through our web page for the people in need. 

>

I tested it with QGIS 1.9.0 Alpha master nightly build version on my Windows, Mac OSX and Ubuntu. And got the same result. And there is no blanks in installation folder name. For example on windows, c:\osgeo4w\... is my default folder name.  So I believe that this can be a bug of crssync. 

I tried to find postinstall.log but I couldn't. However I found setup.log showing this kind of error.

Any idea on this?

Hello all,

great to see already some feedback to Google's announce!
To be precise, OSGeo will be able to apply in March, so until then I
suggest to focus on drafting ideas and contacting potential students.

Feel free to ask more information by emailing me and/or OSGeo SoC
mailing list:
http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/soc

and of course contacting previous years' mentors and students.

Kind regards
Anne

Message-ID: <CAExk7p27vZ8nEZHH13rCn4QxUGTcvwrevpi+_FHnFmVPje=ALw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

I've made a pull request that induces some changes in the Composer's items
GUI.
If you are interested, please have a look (feedback is of course welcome) :

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/426

Best regards,

Olivier


####################################################

The differencesQToolBox replaced by QCollapsibleGroupBox(es).

*before*

   - a lot of wasted space
   - unpractical (you must toggle back and forth to edit elements on
   different pages)
   - not very good looking (it looks messy and it's hard to distinguigh
   from QDockWindowss)

*after*

   - QgsCollapsibleGroupBoxes look great and provide a nice outline of all
   features when folded
   - Easier to adapt to your needs and screen size

QToolBox replaced by QCollapsibleGroupBox(es).

   - so you can dynamically reposition/resize the items without having to
   open a modal dialog.
   - also provides a nice feedback on element's position

Harmonisation and optimisation of widget layouts

   - most of the widgets had uneven spacing (looked a bit sketchy)
   - some widgets where uselessly big
   - better hiearchy and grouping of similar options

Duplicate/Ambigious/Unclear functionalities

   - QgsComposerShape had duplicate implemtation of frame and background

Changes

The work was mainly done in the .ui files, but some classes are a little
more modified :

   - QgsComposerShape (clean duplicate frame/background implementation)
   - QgsItemPositionDialog was merged into QgsComposerItemWidget, which
   also makes some change

Screenshots

Here are screenshots of all modified widgets :
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gkte3o126doe4ue/YfN_iVxRKx
Todo

   - I think it would be nice to integrate the atlas' widget into the
   composition's widget
   - It would be nice if there was a collapse/expand all button (or a
   shortcut (alt-click ?) to collapse all other QgsCollapsibleBoxes)
   - Use color buttons wherever possible

So...

What do you think ?

Well, thats not normal, and might be the reason for not syncing. There 
is also a setup.log.full, which might give further information at this 
points.

Anyway, your ticket on hub.qgis.org should be updated. It has nothing to 
do with new or old EPSG codes.

Hi,

I updated my ticket and also attached setup.log.full there for your digging. 

I just wonder whether there is any similar post-installation log file in Mac OSX and Ubuntu.

Thank you.

Looks like a QT dll version problem:
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11293337/qt-exited-with-code-1073741511>
http://www.qtcentre.org/threads/26213-exited-with-code-1073741511
http://www.qtcentre.org/threads/26604-Runtime-problem-in-Release-mode

Do you have any other version of QT on your system, which brings a false 
dll into the Windows path?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] creating a windows build out of a git branch from
	ubuntu
Message-ID: <1360725603081-5033834.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

I would like to create a windows installer from my git branch. I am
currently developing on Ubuntu 12.04 and would like to know if it is
possible to do this from linux itself. My previous attempts at building in
windows never succeeded. I checked Tim's article about using the nsis
script(http://linfiniti.com/2012/05/quick-tip-build-the-latest-qgis-nightly-build-as-a-standalone-installer-for-windows/).
But i think this article is about creating installer for the latest qgis dev
version.

Anyone got ideas?

Regards
Vinayan

Hi, 

I run crssync manually and I found that crssync tried to update srs.db in wrong path. So for my testing,  I created folder and put the srs.db there and re-run the crssync. Finally I got the updated srs.db successfully. Wow!

I think it's not the problem or bug of crssync but the problem of post-installation process in master version. 

I'll test more.

Thanks.

I prepared new clean windows and installed master version there. Finally I found that srs.db was successfully updated and got all SRSs that I needed. 

I assume that old environment settings like path & others from old QGIS or other FOSS4G affected the post-installation process. 

Do I need to cancel the ticket?

Maybe it is better to close that, and open another for the installer fault.

This is definitely the wrong path. I wonder how you got the 
C:\Programme\ in there. Thats the german language folder name for 
Windows XP C:\Program Data\
For OSGeo4w setup, it should be C:\Osgeo4W\

Hi,

Well, as I read it, this should work in any branch. Have you tried the 
procedure in yours?

Hi Denis,

I tried and got a few errors..If it works in any branch, i will explore
more.

http://pastebin.com/H7rrdid1

jef told me it could be due to broken downloads..not sure how i can fix it..

Thanks

That's just because QGIS_PREFIX_PATH wasn't set, when running crssync manually.
It is set to the right path when run in the postinstall batch job.

Hi all.

While attempting to access an Oracle DB, Test connection returns:


Driver not loaded Driver not loaded


What should I test?
Thanks.

Um, how did you build with Oracle without having libclntsh?

RPMs of the instant client are downloadable from Oracle[1] and can be turned
into .deb using alien.

gosh, tens of different zips: could you point out the most suitable?
unclear if the resulting deb can be made available according to the licence - if so,
I'll be happy to.

OK, you can avoid that, if you start the OSgeo4w shell, type in
qgis-dev.bat manually, and close the starting QGIS Master.
Then type cd \Osgeo4w\apps\qgis-dev\ to change into the directory where
crssync.exe is, and type crssync.exe. No problem to start it if not
necessary.

That way I successfully updated my SRS database when installation broke
due to blanks in path.

@J?rgen: Do you have an idea why the setup breaks at Sanghee with a QT
error code? And QGIS Master starts without complaining about missing DLL
entry point?

Greetings,
Andr? Joost

Hi Juergen,
dowloaded, installed trhough alien, recompiled QGIS, exported LD_LIBRARY_PATH, still
same error: anything else I can try? Or, is there something to be changed in
compilation options from standard debian/rules?
If the oracle package is redistributable in windows, I suppose it so also for Debian, or?
Thanks a lot.

Set the distribution to sid-oracle (in changelog), then the source package will
be built with WITH_ORACLE enabled (otherwise you shouldn't have oracle at all)
and have a binary package qgis-oracle-provider.

Yes, those are my concerns, too. At the same time, it would be good to
simplify API where it makes sense. I am aware of the fact that such
convenience functions would block using other options - but with
default options being "with geometry, with all attributes" people
typically should not need to use more options. Finally, I would be
opposing reintroduction of "true/false" arguments for getFeatures() as
those are really advanced options that "average" users should not need
to used (e.g. until recently OGR always fetched geometry and all
attributes).

Maybe, but IMHO we should provide simple API for simple cases to not
scare potential users :-)

Good :)

featureAtId() accepts those true/false arguments which I consider
evil. Regarding existence of the feature, I guess checking f.isValid()

Hi Juergen,
sorry ot bother, but I tried to recompile, and got no qgis-oracle-provider package.
Anywhere I can study how to do it?
All the best, and thanks.

You shouldn't try to do that - plugins are simply not designed for
that. There are various reasons why this would be a bad idea (e.g. no
public API, binary compatibility problems and different handling of
plugins across platforms).

If any QGIS c++ plugin contains some code that is worth using in other
plugins, it makes sense to move such code to QGIS libraries and
generate python bindings. Like this, calling c++ code from python is
safe and free of headaches.

No idea how you did it.   If I do a clean build using

dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -j8

on unstable I end up with a package without oracle support (as expected).

If I use

debchange -p --force-distribution -D sid-oracle -l"~oracle" "qgis build with oracle support"

to produce a package with oracle support and then run

dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -j8

to build it, I get it with oracle support.  One small issue is that the oracle
entry is there even if the oracle provider package isn't installed (but only if
the package is built with oracle support).

JFYI

MS-Windows is broken by design. It uses three(!) different ways how to
encode non-latin letters - OEM, ANSI and Unicode at same time. To make
things worse - it's hard to tell them apart unless You (developer)
know where string comes from. Generally problems arise if QGIS is
using anything that runs trough CMD (.bat files etc).
+ to make things worse, add / and \ issue in path separators. In some
places /\ mixture works, in some - not.

As Korean users aren't the only ones affected, my advice is to have a
user with latin-only letters in username.

GRASS GIS ML archives have some nice discussions about those problems.

I do not know if this has already be mentioned, but if the layer drawing order is
activated in a project (as it is in the naturalearth project) some of the layers are
not visible.
Hope this helps.

Just for the record, the parameter is:

<     <legend updateDrawingOrder="true">
---
>     <legend updateDrawingOrder="false">

The first works.

Looks good. Just ask Tim he will add it for you.

A tip for your plugin code you can use the new PyQt signal slot style

Canvas.mapToolSet.connect(your method)

And

yoursignal = pyqtSignal(str)

self,yoursignal.emit("hello world")

Hi Natham,

Thanks for the tip.
It is obviously more pythonic! Although, I liked the fact that the 
signal was a string, so it was easily found in lines of code...

I'll ask Tim for the blog.

Cheers,

Denis

I noticed that I didn't mention the devel package.  You also need that.

Message-ID: <31DED77E-7E21-4F80-8C64-7093574F22CB@student.gsu.edu>

Hi all,

I am a graduate student looking to contribute to QGIS.  Specifically, I am looking to tackle a project that requires parallel computing techniques.

I'm somewhat new here; from reading the archives it looks like there is multithreading support in QGIS, maybe some support for OpenCL, but it doesn't look like much has been done with it.

Frankly, I don't know where to start.  If someone could point me in the right direction, or if they have any insight into parts of the codebase that could benefit from parallelization, I'd appreciate it.

Ben Adcock

Please try --configpath command line option to avoid problems. :-)
e.g. (in qgis.bat)
start "Quantum GIS" /B "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\qgis\bin\qgis.exe --configpath
D:\qgisconfig

Hi,

I wanna close my ticket however I don't think I have enough privileges.

Anybody who has enough privileges, please close my ticket http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6820. 

And I'll check more what caused the failure of crssync during post-installation process. 

Thanks.

Starting --noplugins, no segfault, but I get:

Cannot get Oracle select dialog from provider.

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib/
does not help.

Hi,

I'm almost at the point where I will submit a pull request.

Main changes:
* The vector layer cache is integrated with the new vector layer API 
architecture... It's not yet absolutely bullet proof, but works pretty 
nice already and everybody can write an own cache index for it (this 
means, if somebody wants to write a geometry based caching index, you're 
ready to go. GSOC maybe?)
* I added some tests as well
* Ported over as much as possible to GUI, so it's available in the lib 
(and hopefully soon in python, once the API seems more stable to me)

In case somebody wants to have a look before it gets into master (I hope 
it gets accepted...) now is the last call.

Regards and have a nice weekend,
Matthias

Some time ago (within GSoC 2010) I have been experimenting with
multithreaded rendering of map canvas [1]. That work has not been
merged back to master branch, but in recent months I have started
again with some preparations for introduction of multithreaded
rendering. The basic idea is simple: instead of drawing layers one
after other, we can start rendering of several layers at once. For
that we have already tried using QtConcurrent framework which is quite
convenient way to get the threads running.

Apart from rendering, there are surely various other tasks where you
could use multithreading - I'm not sure what exactly is of your
interest. You have mentioned OpenCL - how would you like to apply it
in context of QGIS? There are other OSGeo project that have started
experimenting with implementation of some algorithms on GPU - I know
of GDAL (and maybe GRASS).

First of all you should get familiar with QGIS application, then start
looking into the code, especially the qgis_core library which lays
ground for most of the other code. You may find Sextante plugin
interesting as it defines a framework for various processing
algorithms - some algorithms are used from other processing libraries,
others are "native" to QGIS (e.g. coming from fTools plugin) and they
could see some speed improvement. However often a reasonable
optimization is to use more sophisticated algorithm (e.g. with
complexity N*logN instead of N^2) than paralellizing naive algorithm.

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_Fsy_D2542fd1H_JKNRDypdVofLr8NpE2C+GUEuSNiDvg@mail.gmail.com>

In order to create a Project page for my Multipart Split plugin, I followed
the instructions in http://plugins.qgis.org/, and created a new project.
but now I can't find how to make it a subproject of "User Plugins".

>From some search on google, I found that it could be done directly by using
the following link
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/new?parent_id=qgis-user-plugins. That would be
the correct way to do it, but I can't find how to delete the Project I
created.

Can someone, with the right management powers, make my project a
sub-project or simply delete it?

Thanks,

Those are not strange values, the srs id is the primary key that reference
to SRS in sqlite db.
You should use authid() [1] to get EPSG code or description() [2] to get a
textual description of the SRS.

Hi Paolo,

The layer drawing order only works if you have a newer release of QGIS
server - one that does support and use the GetProjectSettings command
(instead of the GetCapabilities command before). Only if you use that
server version - and also have GetProjectSettings enabled in the QGIS
webclient - the layer drawing order should work.

Can you please check and report back? I can only check it it on Tuesday,
when I am back at my workplace, but I can tell that the layer drawing

Dear all,

thank you for your prompt replies last week, and in the meantime I have 
worked out how ODK can be used for our purpose without relying on an 
internet connection. If anyone is interested in the set up instructions 
for laymen let me know.

Thanks again and greetings,
Janneke

Hi Andreas,
thanks for your reply. We are using qgis master, so this should not be
an issue.
Can you see all the layers switched on on the demo Natural Earth
project, out of the box?
A minor annoyance anyway.
Thanks again.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Composer item's IDs
Message-ID: <CAExk7p0GFeUSFMSrZ2yKkPKs2SamYmhk964s_D0FV9OfAz7P6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

I'm developing a plugin which needs to attach some custom data to some
Composer Item's instances.
Thus, I need a way to identify the instances.

I saw that there's an ID attribute in the ComposerItems, but don't
really know how it's supposed to work. It seems for now it's only an
user defined value, which remains empty when the user doesn't provide
it and which also can be duplicated.
So it seems I can't use this as an unique ID.

What's the best way to do that ?


More globally, what is this ID good for ? Is it's behavior not fully
implemented yet ?

I think it would be useful to auto-assign unique which the user
couldn't change. If needed, another attribute ("name" or "tag") could
be added to replace the current "ID" behaviour, allowing the user to
define custom data.

What do you think ?

Thanks !!

Olivier

OK I've got something which seems to work well using QUuid.
It's easier with QUuid than an incremental id since there's no need to
store the last key.

It already works more or less, I'll make a pull request soon.

What do you think about the other attribute ? (which would be called
smthg like "Internal name", and would replace current id's behavior)
I'm not sure this is useful though. Maybe it will only be confusing to
the user...

Should I add this attribute or not ?

Personally I'm not a fan of using a uuid unless the user doesn't need to
enter them.

For me a composer item only needs a id or name not both.  You can just
store a counter on the composer the item belongs to as only has to be
unique for that composer. I would just auto name them "composeritem_n" and
have the composer assign the name/id when the item is added to the
composer. If the user wants to change it later he can.

Thinking about this. There really isn't a reason to force item names/id to
be unqiue . if I want to have three items named the same then that is
really my choice.  If I have say three map windows that I want to set all
to the same extents then I could just call them all "maps" and just loop
over all the items with that name.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Update to staged plugins
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_pG9G0XC-s2S6qpXBT22rAnqq6UOU2nACXOuHouEF1GQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've committed an update to python/plugins/CMakeLists.txt [0] that changes
how staged plugins are built (resources generated and copied to [build
dir]/output/python/plugins). Staged plugins allow plugins to be available
when QGIS is run from the build directory and was originally coded by
Sandro Santilli.

When staging all plugins, use the following make targets after a regular
QGIS build:
*  staged_plugins - stage plugins (usually after repo pull/build and
project make)
*  staged_plugins_pyc - stage and byte-compile all Python scripts
*  clean_staged_plugins - removes the plugins directory and all contents

When developing on a plugin, use the following make targets:
*  staged_[plugin_dir_name] - stage specific plugin, regenerating any
changed resources
*  clean_staged_[plugin_dir_name] - removes the plugin directory and its
contents

CMake options WITH_STAGED_PLUGINS and WITH_PY_COMPILE are still valid and
just run 'staged_plugins' or 'staged_plugins_pyc' respectively (if
WITH_STAGED_PLUGINS=TRUE) at the end of a regular project build.

In the newly available workflow for running QGIS from build directory,
leaving WITH_STAGED_PLUGINS=FALSE (should be as default now?), all above
targets are still generated, but not built as part of ALL target. This
allows a developer to set up their IDE with custom build process steps like
so:

* make
* make staged_plugins (optional)
* make install (optional)

with 'make staged_plugins' capable of being built anytime after project
build, making those project builds as fast as possible, as done here with
QtCreator project setup [1].

If you work on core Python plugins, please let me know how the new workflow
for making staged plugins works for you.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multicolumn legends in print composer

Radim,

Following up on your implementation of the nice legend's multicolumn
feature. I've noticed two regression (one of which I've filed a bug
already).

1) The right-side box spacing is now miscalculated as it fails to add the
icon label space value. Issue 7099 (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7099) has
been filed with more details and a accompanying screenshot.

2) There also was a regression in the way vertical spacing is calculate
between layer items and layers. An old issue, 3605, highlighted a similar
visual problem which was fixed in revision 08c88575 (
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/08c885759bd280339605ea07a221ab20f7dfdb75/diff/).
Long story short, layers with no titles are often used as part of a group
of layer items. As such, the solution found in the cited revision was to
take into account the layer item vertical spacing to the layer vertical
spacing. The multicolumn appear to have regressed this. I can open an issue
with screenshots if necessary.

Message-ID: <51233009.1040500@faunalia.it>

Hi all.

for the next HF, my aim would be to setup and publish our new rst based website, and
cleanup all the obsolete stuff, in wiki and elsewhere. Please let us know:
* who is willing (and have time) to cooperate in this effort
* do you see any blocking factor?
One issue that I see could prevent publication when content is ready is about
styling: are we going to publish it as it stands now in http://docs.qgis.org or do we
want some fancy-looking stuff, html5 and the like? How to make styling more uniform
with the (rather dull IMHO) ones used in hub and plugins?

Also, I would like to consolidate the lengthy discussion about the logo. I think we
mostly agree our logo needs at least a cleanup and revamp, possibly a brand new one.
Now would be the right time to do it. I see two possible roads:
* start a contest among users (many of our power users have graphic designers in
their staff)
* seek a professional designer, and start a bid about it.
Opinions?

All the best.

There is use for both unique names (or auto-incrementing numbers) and 
user-defined names. And both cases are already used:

- auto-incrementing number in QgsComposerMap::mId. Needs to be unique 
within the composition because other elements may refer to it 
(north-arrow items or overview maps)
- user-defined names: QgsComposerItem::mId (unfortunately with the same 
attribute name as the composer map int id).

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQt VectorLayer signal
Message-ID: <51233C32.7000005@jena.de>

Hi,

for a plugin I am trying to connect a slot to QgsVectorLayer's 
commitedFeaturesAdded signal (I assume this signal is emitted when the 
user toggles the editing status and any features have been added and are 
written back to the data source)

This is the code I tried

# old connector style, I tried both with and without "const" and "&.."
QtCore.QObject.connect(self.documentLayer, 
QtCore.SIGNAL("committedFeaturesAdded(const QString &layerId, const 
QgsFeatureList &addedFeatures)"), self.featuresCommited)

# new connector style 
self.documentLayer.committedFeaturesAdded.connect(self.featuresCommitted)

#this is the slot, I tried with and without slot decoration
@QtCore.pyqtSlot(QtCore.QString, list )
def featuresCommitted(self,  layerId,  addedFeatures):
     QtGui.QMessageBox.information(None, "featuresCommited", \
         str(len(addedFeatures)))

However my slot never gets called
any hint or running code examples appreciated.

I am using current master on Linux if that matters

Bernhard

INSTALL is the canonical resource:

In case of troubles, please write to dev list here (though there are not 
so much people compiling themselves on Window)

+1 too.
The current doc website is simple and good looking, but the logo is not on 
par. Some html5 and fancy stuff could be a good idea, as you say, if it is 
coherent among the other qgis websites.

Hi,

This has been worked on some more, tested on Ubuntu 12.10, Mac 10.7 and
Win7, then committed [0]. If you find any issues with the new layout please
let Olivier or I know.

Along the way we fixed some issues with the new collapsible group boxes,
which are prominently used. If you see any issue with them (even small
ones), please let me know. Try Ctrl(or Alt)-clicking them to toggle synched
sets of group boxes.

Thanks to Olivier for initiating and working out the redesign!

Regards,

Larry

I think we mostly agree with that, the issue is which route to take to find a better
one: contest or bid?

Would it be acceptable to do this from the PostGIS data provider,
at construction time ? Or is there a callback/event that is dispatched
when user enters editing mode ?

Should be no problem to do it from PostGIS provider (no GUI involved). 
However, as the property is stored in the project, it could be changed 
if the user loads a new project or goes with a new empty project.

Marco

My topological editing plugin broke due to attributeMap() being replaced
by attributes() in the python API. If I change to use attributes() it won't
work with 1.8 anymore. Is there any important reason to require changes in
all plugins ?

I faced the same problem with SEXTANTE (and there were a large number
of calls to replace), and decided to go ahead and break compatibility
with 1.8. Should be better in the mid-term, but it's true that it is
not nice to leave a plugin depending now on an yet-unreleased
version...

If it is not a big work, maybe you can keep two versions, more or less
synchronized

Hi Sandro,

I also had to update my plugins to reflect the api changes we go through 
in 2.0 Although it is some work (for us plugin devs), I think it is good 
te clean up and make a better api.

Here are the changes in the wiki:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/API_changes_for_version_20

with on the bottom a way to handle it in plugins to handle both 1.8 and 
2.x QGIS versions.

Martin wrote a lengthy email about the select and attribute changes, see:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2013-February/024278.html

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I can try that. How do I encode that one version does NOT work
with a newer QGIS ?

I see there's a qgisMinimumVersion setting,
is there also a qgisMaximumVersion ? Would it be used by plugin fetcher ?

The ideas in the document that Richard mentions, about how to make it
compatible for both versions, are maybe a better idea. I do not know
if a maximum version can be set in the plugin metadata. :-(

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Unloading a layer in Sextante script crashes QGIS
Message-ID: <CAOJAE5qneE3wk+_VKG8JBcSf=4y1gv_c821rRpbBcKUr-FvmHg@mail.gmail.com>

I've put together a Sextante script to automate the production of
grid-based species distribution maps (png image output) by modifying [1]
and [2]. It takes a vector layer of point localities (with species name as
a field) and a grid layer as input, and produces output maps by selecting
grids based on point localities.

For each species it creates a distribution shapefile, which consists of the
grid polygons where the species occurs. As far as I could tell, this layer
needs to be loaded to the canvas before it can be included in the layerset
to be rendered for the output images (is there a better way?). Sextante
includes a function for loading layers, but not removing them. From what I
could find, "QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayers(taxon_layer.id())"
should remove the layer, but it crashes QGIS when I try (current git
version). If I comment out the line, my canvas gets clogged. Any idea where
the problem lies? Script below.

Thanks,
Rudi

Why not just hide it using Python method overriding:

QgsVectorLayer.attributeMap = QgsVectorLayer.attributes

Then you can just call attributesMap()[] and it will call
QgsVectorLayer.attributes for you.

I guess you meant QgsFeature.
Didn't work, anyway:

line 102, in doRemEdgeModFace
    edge_id = feature.attributeMap()[edge_id_fno].toInt()[0]
TypeError: QgsFeature.attributes(): first argument of unbound method must have type 'QgsFeature'

is attributes() a free function rather than a method ?

Ok, sounds better. I'll revert my change as I don't have time now to implement
a proper way to hook that.

Interacting with the canvas or any other elements in QGIS is not a
good idea from SEXTANTE. It might cause that freezing you mention,
since you are calling GUI methods from a different thread and that
might result in strange behaviour.

Ideally, a SEXTANTE algorithm should just take data and produce new
data, and then, if it is declared correctly as algorithm output, it
will be loaded automatically by SEXTANTE. I am afraid that your
algorithm might go beyond what SEXTANTE expects....

Anyway, the problem might be that you are trying to remove the layer
and maybe it is not there since the load method in SEXTANTE does not
add the layer to the canvas, but just open it so SEXTANTE algorithms
can use it if it is not loaded.

Hope this helps

To answer the question of why it was changed.  I was changed because
attributes() is now a list not a map like before when it was called
attributeMap().  You no longer have to do the index look up and just just
do [index] or [name].

Thanks Victor... I tried a few other ways to load the layer, but none of
them seem to work.

Another approach would be to somehow render the layer without loading it to
the canvas first. Is it possible to add a layer to a QgsMapRenderer() layer
set without it being loaded in the project's QgsMapLayerRegistry? I guess
not since it requires a layer id, which I guess is provided by the
registry. Is it possible to have more than one QgsMapLayerRegistry? If it
is, I could create an output registry for each map... if not, looks like
I'll need to make a full plugin.

Thanks,
Rudi

Hi,

I managed to get QGIS compiled from source using mostly binary packages
from the default Fedora 18 XFCE spin. Any suggestion on where do I add the
Fedora 18 section to the INSTALL document?
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/INSTALL

Basically, do the yum install's and you are done. I found them using a
ccmake ../Quantum-GIS and fixed the build errors.

Thanks

This mechanism has to not been implemented yet - neither in the plugin

Another approach is to test qgis version and use appropriate API. Many
plugins do this. e.g. value tool

        if QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT >= 10900:
            mapCanvasSrs = self.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationCrs()
        else:
            mapCanvasSrs = self.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationSrs()

I have updated the wiki page with that information.

Of course this may not be practical if there are many places to do
this. Other solution is to call a function which uses appropriate api
calls.

Another option could be to just use one of the existing proposals.
I don't think there were any negative comments when the one at http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6688 was proposed.  
It would be your "cleanup and revamp", rather than "a brand new one".

Hi all,

This is a great case example. I wonder if the custom plugin development is heavily based off of the Atlas plugin or is uniquely derived. Having the plugin available as a code example might be useful for others.

Hi Luca, did you ever get this working?
I'm trying with QGIS WPS against Geoserver and having no luck still :(
Not sure if Geoserver or QGIS issue.

Is Geoserver using or supporting GML as inputs format if you are

GeoServer does support GML, provided you mark the inputs with the
appropriate mime
type (it can't recognize GML from a schema reference yet).

Message-ID: <5124BEDA.8020208@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I may be missing something, but I do not understand the meaning of the advertised
extent in OWS tab of Project properties, and its relation to qgis-web-client: I
assumed the start (or max?) extent for the web app would be taken from this, but from
my tests it seems that the extent is the bounding box of all the layers of the project.
Is there some explanation on how it works?
Thanks.

Message-ID: <103d2570b195aad2ccab340e3d6ffd79@carto.net>

 Hi,

 With the recent modifications in print composer, while I agree that the 
 UI has much improved, there are unfortunately also some side-effects. 
 Here are two problems I have detected:

 * legend boxes which had a white background now have a transparent 
 background
 * Basic shapes (like rects, ellipses, triangles) that had a black 
 border now have either no border or a white border

 For organizations like us, with a lot of QGIS projects with a lot of 
 different layouts, this is quite annoying if we have to manually change 
 each of the projects.

 But I am also aware that we are using master / unstable and that there 
 are modifications. I can live with such changes but I assume that other 
 users will have similar problems if backwards compatibility breaks.

 Just to let you know - thanks for the improvements in the UI!

 Andreas

Message-ID: <59465a7faa150917d18da9ad0f51f6e8@carto.net>

 Hi,

 With the OSGeo4W nightly from yesterday I cannot open a .qgs-File from 
 Windows Explorer with a double-click. QGIS open, opens the project and 
 crashes immediately. This behavior is on two machines, one on XP one in 
 Win7.

 When I open QGIS without the project and then open the project, it 
 works fine. I can also drag and drop a .qgs File without crashes.

 Can someone else confirm if it works for them to open a .qgs File by 
 double-clicking it in Windows Explorer?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Message-ID: <5124E5E1.8020407@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I found a few issues:
* when starting a new layout, the item properties tab is not shown entirely, and it
has to be enlarged; I'd suggest developers to design taking int account small screens
* now Transparency is used intead of Opacity, thanks; however, I think the scale more
obvious for the user should be in percentage (0-100%) instead of 0-255.
Moreover, on Gnome3 (this is not related to recent changes) when clicking on Composer
Manager, then on the desired layout, the popup stays upfront, and to access the
layout one has to close it, and click on the composer window.
Surely there is a better behaviour.
Thanks.

Hi !

Those change appear because some properties have been added and some
removed to make the UI and the code more consistent (removing
duplicate border color settings for Shape item, for instance).
Upon opening an old project, the added properties will be set to
default, while the duplicate one will take the old unused property.

I'd say there's no easy way to avoid such side-effects (without coding
some dirty compatibility code). One way to handle such changes would
be to implement a kind of "old version file converter" to allow
backwards compatibility without making the code too complex.

But I'm not sure that if it's worth it. A general rule in software
usage is to keep the same version of the software throughout a
project, an to use new versions only when starting new projects.


However, it is possible to discuss if which composer items should have
a background and/or frame by default. (in your case, this could change
whether composer items should have a background by default)

For now, I think all the composer items have a white background and no
frame by default, excepted the ComposerShape which has also a frame.

Might be related to the collapsible check box in composers.  It might be
already fixed with cc0c2b1853 - 

Most of my projects work - the first that didn't was an old one, which has a
composer crashed with the nightly, but not with a current build.

 Hi Olivier,

 Thank you for your reply. For me its fine. I had to change other stuff 
 in my layouts anyway (new email address, etc.). I am almost through all 
 the changes.

 My projects have to stay on the current version all the time. They 
 should live for several years and improve gradually - along with 
 improvements in QGIS. It is not an option to have older QGIS versions 
 around for older projects. But that's our problem.

 So basic shapes (rects, ellipses, triangles) should have a black stroke 
 by default - a stroke-width of 0.2 mm, in my opinion. All other elements 
 probably without a frame and background by default. Does this make 
 sense?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Hi !

So I've been working on this ID stuff and got a proposition (which
I'll post as pull request after testing a little more) :

https://github.com/olivierdalang/Quantum-GIS/tree/ComposerItemsUniqueIds


The idea is to following (this concerns QgsComposerItems)   :

1) ID : this property is unaltered. It is still a user-defined QString
which is not necessarily unique. Only thing changed : all
QgsComposerItems now show the ID as a ToolTip. (same behaviour as
current QgsComposerMap)

2) UUID: this is a new property, which is not modifiable. It consists
of a QUuid geneated QString (looking like
{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000} ). The Uuid is generated on
creation. It is kept when cut/paste, but regenerated on copy/paste and
on template loading. This way, the Uuid should always be unique.

So this induces no API changes.

3) But then, as Marco Hugentobler said, there's QgsComposerMap which
implements it's own ID which are unique integer inside one
composition.
I removed that implementation, so the normal QgsComposerItem's ID
implementation is used. The QgsComposerMap only overrides the setId()
method to ensure the ID is unique inside one composition.

This induces an API change, since the ComposerMap's ID now is a
QString instead of an int.
If this is a major problem, 3) could be let as it is now.

Regards,

Olivier

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Print composer: problems with thin arrow lines
Message-ID: <cc2fac1261717907fd4bf1abe4e0377d@carto.net>

 Hi,

 In many layouts I use thin lines (e.g. as divider lines). Mostly they 
 are vertically or horizontally. For some reasons these lines are not 
 visible when in page zoom, but appear if I zoom in to the layout. 
 Usually they have a line-width of 0.2mm. If I increase the line-width 
 these lines get visible.

 This is purely a preview problem. When printing or exporting these 
 lines are exported or printed properly.

 Is this a qt rendering problem of thin lines? Is there some setting 
 that would make sure these thin lines are always visible?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

The thing a like with having a frame by default is that you still see
the element even if its blank. Currently, when creating a map which
displays nothing (no visible layer) you can loose it on the layout.

 Hi,

 When dealing with these ID changes - can you please make sure that the 
 QGIS server GetPrint command still works? These IDs are used in QGIS 
 server to identify e.g. text labels that can be replaced by the client. 
 Or to identify maps that need rotation or map extents.

 It would be nice if this functionality would stay intact.

 Other than that, your proposal sounds fine to me (not knowing the 
 technical implications).

 Andreas

 Yes - there is a problem of "lost" elements in the print composer.

 A while back I suggested to introduce a tree view in a separate panel 
 where one could see all items present in the composer layout. Similar to 
 the object tree in Illustrator or the XML tree in Inkscape. So far, 
 noone had the time or finance to implement this.

 Through such a tree one could select, rearrange and remove items and 
 groups.

 Some idea for the future ;-)

To be honest, it's implemented in the installer years ago. Anyway, AFAIK the 
repo doesn't uses it.

You can publish two versions, the higher with a higher qgisMinimumVersion:

version 1.0 for qgisMinimumVersion = 1.0
version 2.0 for qgisMinimumVersion = 1.9

The installer always fetches the highest available version sutiable for 
current QGIS.


The downside is that people having 1.8 and 2.0 side by side (what is quite 
common), need to set separate plugin directories for both versions.

Personally I implelent both APIs in my plugins:

    if QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT >= 10900:
	foo()	
    else:
	bar()

even if it means almost duplicated big blocks of code (someday the old version 
will be removed anyway)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Print composer: dimensions of arrow/line objects
Message-ID: <23188de5b346c450145c110f764999a0@carto.net>

 There is also a strange behaviour with arrow elements.

 If one explicitly sets the lines to a certain width. Say I set a 
 horizontal line to a width of 130 (through "Position and Size"), then 
 QGIS replaces this value by a value of 130.001 or sometimes to 129.999 
 or so. Is there a reason for this behaviour? I think it is quite 
 disturbing if one explictly sets a value and then QGIS uses something 
 else - even if the value is very close to my original value. Is this 
 sort of a rounding problem or a bounding box problem?

 I think this problem existed for a long time already - maybe even from 
 the beginning when the arrow object was introduced.

 Thanks if anyone knows how to correct this behaviour.

Hi all.
I'm consistently getting a segfault on startup, due to some plugin (starting with
--noplugins avoid the crash). The question is: I have lots of them, is there anybody
knowing which one can cause the crash? Or a way to find it, better than trial and
errors, or removing all and reinstalling?
All the best.

I'm not familiar at all with QGIS Server...
I looked in the source, found some reference to the composer map id in
qgsconfigparser.cpp:432, but I don't really understand how it's used.
I think this is probably affected by 3). Any help on this would be
welcome !

Hi all,
this morning I was playing with inkscape for a new splash screen for QGIS
2.0,
and the result is the attached image [1], I like it, but I am not sure if
it looks good to you!

Here the video that shows QGIS on startup:

What you think about it ?

Hi Andreas,

I noticed the same issue when testing Olivier's GUI changes. Tested on 1.8
and it exists there as well. Seems to be the only item whose position input
is not functioning properly, so probably a simple code fix. A bit odd,
though, since one would expect such a transform to be abstracted out of the
individual composer item code (maybe it is). Please make an issue ticket,
if you have the time.

Yes, that's what that commit was about. For some reason my test projects at
home (when testing the new Composer GUI) did not exhibit that crash. When I
got to work, several of my projects consistently crashed the app on open,
especially if the project was opening at launch. I no longer get crashes
after that commit.

Andreas, please build with that commit included [0]. If you see any more
crashes, please let me know and I will look into it right away.

Yes, I noticed this as well. There are three things that need addressed
here:

1) Slim down all options so their width is a set reasonable minimum (some
item properties are unnecessarily wider than others)

2) Ensure the Item Properties panel starts with appropriate width to
accommodate the width of all individual item properties (this means either
defining appropriate splitter size for the panels area, or having something
in that panel fixed at the defined width)

3) Test on laptops to ensure reasonable defaults (Olivier has already
mentioned having more collapsed options, like he initially designed)

Please make an issue ticket for this, if you have the time.

This is the same on Mac. I've fixed this locally. But the current behavior
allows for opening multiple composer windows (even if multiple selection
isn't supported in the list widget). So, maybe this shouldn't be 'fixed.'

Also, I noticed there is no access to the Composer Manager or Print
Composers menu from within a composer instance. Those are easy enough to
add (just pull in the current QActions from main app window).

Larry

I don't think there is a set policy. It's seems to be more case-by-case.
However, with 2.0 there are many changes which affect plugin developers and
some that affect users. IMO those that affect users should be kept to a
minimum, and ideally, transparent.

I think ensuring users can at least open the previous version's project
file should always be considered a top-of-the-list goal when doing a
redesign of code or the GUI. Version 2.0 is going to upset users if it
forces them to make updates to many preexisting project files, especially
if the only reasoning for the change is 'to make the UI and the code more
consistent.'

There has to be a good reason for making a change that forces users edit
many of their current project files upon opening them in the next version.

Thanks !

I don't think that's a general rule at all.

Users expect (rightly so) to be able to open their project files in the
next version of the program. Some of my software projects are over 10 years
old and have migrated through many versions of the software. This is also a
design goal of even companies like Adobe (who always ensures backward
compatibility of 1 version). As a user nothing aggravates me like needing
to find a user who has an Adobe Creative Suite version 4 to open a version
3 project, so it can be saved as version 4, so I can open it in version 5
(I skipped CS4 for financial reasons)... but, at least I can.

Larry

Hi Bernhard,

I stumbled upon this also today.

It seems, that this signal is emitted nowhere, while the same signal is 
emitted by the edit buffer behind the vector layer.
While something like connecting your slot every time layer editing is 
started (needed, because the edit buffer gets deleted/created based on 
editing state) or connecting to featureAdded, which is also emitted may 
work, I've just issued a pull request to fix this [1].

Cheers,
Matthias

Hi,

I absolutely agree about the fact that one should be able to open and
use file coming from a previous version.
What I wanted to say is that IMO minor glitches when doing so are
tolerable, and that if one cannot afford to spend some time correcting
those glitches (be it because it's a huge file or because there's an
urgent due), he'd better stick to the current version until he's ready
to take that time. And I also meant that as a rule for the user, not
for the programmer...

I think aiming at perfect backwards compatibility may prevent from
doing some necessary updates to keep a clean, understandable code and
thus a coherent and bug free user experience.

A good compromise would be to implement a "File version converter"
class which takes care of that without polluting the code, and
eventually telling the user what will be lost if passing from one
version to another. But that would be a huge work and hard to
maintain.

I also hate how Adobe manages that. I think they do it for the very
reason that they can't admit those glitches at all, but still change
their file format quite a lot. And it's particularly irritating since
you have to pay for each version, where in FOSS you can always
download and install any version you want.

I was asking because the same kind of question occurs often (see
Composer item's IDs for example), and since I'm a newcomer here I'll
adapt (of course :) ).

Regards,

Olivier

Recently, Nathan wrote up a very nice git workflow for QGIS [0]. IMHO, it
should be included as a 'best practice' workflow in CODING, or maybe a new
document named CONTRIBUTING, in the QGIS source distribution, as a
reference for people looking to contribute.

Larry

To confirm, it apparently works using the open layers plugin ? no word on if the map box usage agreement supports this use :-)

Hello

I've upgrade qgis to 1.8.0.5, since then my plugin dxf2shp is not working.

I insert the source (dxf ) and the destination but when I press OK nothing
happend.

I've installed a fresh, stanallone qgis version (the last one) on another
station. The same.

It is possibel to be from gdal version?

Thanks for the any help

 Dear Larry and J?rgen,

 The crash is gone now. I tested again with the nightly and projects

One problem might be if the user changes composer map ids and other items depend on it. Therefore it would be good to use the uuid for the references to the maps (from image item or overview map) but present the name in the selection dialog.

Nice workflow indeed.
Another good one, specially for bug fixing and new feature

i observe also a regression regarding attribute table in print composer.
the table is not shown but you can see only the countour box: inside it's
all white.

Hi Matthias,

I also connected a slot to featureAdded but this also never gets called :-(
Connecting to editingStarted works, though. But in this plugin I need to 
do something for each feature that is added to a layer so simply 
catching editingStarted/editingStopped is not enough.
I will wait for your pull request to be accepted and retry then.

thanks

Bernhard

I got the script to work using
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(taxon_layer) to load and

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayers([taxon_layer.id()]) to
remove the layer. The main error was that the remove command needs the
layer id in a list.


I also made a plugin out of it, so if anyone would find it useful it's at
https://github.com/rudivs/DistroMap. I must say that writing it first as a
Sextante script was a great help in working out the logic. I could then
look at the code from the algorithms and adapt it to my purposes.

Regards,
Rudi

Message-ID: <CA+3oMjuR+LLwbhGjM5wDnf9q0G4973jybZbont0p8scrhGZQ8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Devs!

Just a short Question..
When I load a Rastermap and go to Properties -> Style ..
Whats the meaning of
Render type -> Paletted

I cannot find any "add value" button or something like that ..
Seems to me that I am missing some more buttons there ..

Or am I just misunderstanding the "Palleted" type?

Is this a bug? Shall I file a report for it .. Or is it meant to be so?

Clearance to my sight is welcome

kind regards
Werner

Hi all,

I shared my notes about downloading data and live tracking from/with
GPS units/dataloggers and QGIS on both Linux and Windows.

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Gps_units_download_data_and_live_tracking

It would be great if someone else will add  notes for other devices (I
tested 3 different models) and/or other OSes like OsX.

Message-ID: <012b01ce1028$33642360$9a2c6a20$@wanadoo.fr>

Hi, Paolo, OK?
I think that there is a problem with the field calculator in QGIS-dev 1.9.0
:
When you create a field with calculator (i.e. test, char(32)) and you apply
a formula like 'test',
Only  the 35 first rows are OK! Others = null!
With an integer field, 59 rows only?
That seems random... sometimes, it's OK
Tested with QGIS-dev Ubuntu 12.04 64b and W7 64b
No problem with QGIS 1.8!
How and where to post this kind of problem?
Thank you, Regards
Fred

Thanks Larry.  Just to note that there are a few shortcuts that one can
take that I didn't have in my work follow, things like git rebase -i master
rather then giving it the commit.  I didn't do this in the blog post in
order to show the logic of rebasing onto a commit.  If people have better
cleaner ways to work then I'm happy to update the post.

I would also like to see a  CONTRIBUTING file made, happy to make a start
on that if anyone wants me to.  Even if it's just my git stuff then we can
add stuff later.

Yes, menioned, possibly already solved.
The dev version is now broken better wait several weeks to have it stabilised.
Sinon, ici tout bien - et toi?

Rudi,

Thanks for pushing the limits of SEXTANTE a bit further :-) This is a
good example, and if I have time I will try to investigate on that
line, since it can open the field for other similar "unusual"
algorithms

Thanks again

Nathan,

Will you please post how to update your git fork after you issue a pull
request? I am getting Merge warnings in my fork and applying the same
branch fix again and again in the commit log.

Thanks in advance

This has an issue ticket:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7071

Still very much an issue, since around the new vector API merge (though
that may not have caused the issue).

+1 for starting CONTRIBUTING right now and adding to it as needed. It will
hopefully help ensure pull requests are set up, ready to merge. Good for
the requester and the commit access devs having to look over lots of
requests.

Would also be good to discuss, for the requester's benefit, how to manage a
feature branch in an ongoing pull request. For example, it is common for
the requester's github branch to become outdated, no longer capable of
being auto-merged by github.com. Luckily, the pull request feature at
github.com works off of that branch in a 'live' fashion, i.e. the requester
can pull qgis upstream master branch into theirs as a rebase and do a
'force push' back up to their github repo. The pull request will then show
the branch as viable for auto-merging again.

Here's what I do in this regard (on my feature branch):
  git rebase -i HEAD~2
  (2 being 2 commits back to rebase)

Then, after finishing rebase:
  git push -f origin HEAD
  (where 'origin' is the remote name for my github.com forked repo of QGIS)

Obviously there are potential issues with doing a force push (if others
have already pulled it), but it helps in this scenario when the feature
branch is more than likely a dead end development branch, to be abandoned
or deleted after the merge into master. Those devs testing the requester's
branch can always pull to a new local branch after the requester force
pushes.

The benefit of this approach is that the pull request stays the same, with
all request comments (not sure about per line comments, though), and the
eventual commit(s) are more concise. Process should be tested for any flaws
before writing anything up, though.

Or, we can recommend always creating a new pull request in the case of a
requester's feature branch needing rebased again.

Another issue is 3-way merges. When asking a requester to rebase their
branch via pulling from master, the project is relying upon that individual
to properly 3-way merge any conflicts (potentially messing it up and
deleting parts of other, previously committed code). Not sure the best
approach there, other than carefully going over any pull request that has
been subsequently rebased.

Lastly, we might want to consider disallowing merge commits in pull
requests. Requiring only clean, rebased commits on top of current master,
or at least merge-able into master.

Regards,

Larry

Hi guys, 

one point - 

I generally install QGIS on OpenSuse & Ubuntu Linux from the relevant package repositories, so you won't see any downloads. I would guess that this is pretty common for Linux users, but I have no idea if you are able to get numbers for this?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding a WMS layer via python
Message-ID: <CAB28Asg05ByYXvXxA=MU2UDpSgSQQ+uf_6WU5PC+tq3mQ4gGhQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm wondering if someone can help me out here - I'm trying to add a
WMS layer via a python plugin, but I'm having trouble with two
settings I need:

1: setting a username and password to use for the layer
2: setting a tilesize for the layer

(obviously both these options are available when adding a WMS layer
via the GUI).


My code at the moment looks like this:

uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
uri.setParam("url", "http://images.land.vic.gov.au/ecwp/ecw_wms.dll?")
uri.setParam("layers", "AERIAL_MELBOURNE_2009JAN03_AIR_VIS_35CM_VG94")
uri.setParam("format", "image/jpeg")
uri.setParam("crs", "epsg:3111")
uri.setParam("styles", "")
uri.setParam("width", "512")
uri.setParam("height", "512")
uri.setUsername("x")
uri.setPassword("x")

print uri.encodedUri()
wms_layer = self.iface.addRasterLayer(QString(uri.encodedUri()), layer, "wms")

However, I'm still prompted for a username and password, and the
tilesize width/height parameters are ignored.

One thing I've noticed is that the uri.encodedUri output looks strange:

crs=EPSG:3111&format=image/jpeg&height=512&layers=AERIAL_MELBOURNE_2009JAN03_AIR_VIS_35CM_VG94&styles=&url=http://images.land.vic.gov.au/ecwp/ecw_wms.dll?&width=512

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong on this one?


Kind regards,
Nyall

That's a really good point. Download counts are not a very accurate gauge
of overall install base. I suggest the following.

Add a user profiler tool to QGIS. This might work in the following manner:

* User installs a new version of QGIS (say 2.0) and launches it for the
first time
* Profiler tool sees from main QSettings that it has not sent a user
profile report yet
* Profiler tool shows a simple dialog with revealable gathered info on
their profile (see below) that kindly asks if it is OK to send the info to
the project, with buttons like 'No Thanks' and 'Send to QGIS Project'
* Profiler tool saves user choice, and if sending profile generates a
simple UUID for the user and saves that as well, to QSettings
* Profiler tool sends info to a project server that looks up user's UUID
and if not present adds the profile to a database
* If data was successfully saved to remote server, user is notified and
thanked
* On any following launch of same QGIS version, if UUID or No Thanks choice
is in QSettings user is not asked to send profile info

Possible generated profile info:

* OS (flavor, version, etc.)
* Computer profile (cpu, ram, etc.)
* Supporting software versions (like in About Dialog: Qt, GDAL, etc. +
Python, and maybe others)
* Qt style used (cleanlooks, plastique, macintosh, oxygen, etc.)
* Screen resolution (maybe number of screens)
* Whether device is touch enabled
* Probably more...

Optional info the user can provide via the dialog's interface:

* Listing of installed non-core plugins and which ones are active (of all
plugins)
* App's font and size (and maybe other helpful main Options settings)
* User's info (very limited: name/nickname, title, web address, etc.)
* Choose from editable combobox for work discipline (hydrology, geology,
cartography, student, general gis, etc.) with option to input 'other' type
* Choose their generalized location on a world map (gathers info like for
QGIS user's map)
* Probably more...

The dialog shown by the profiler tool could concisely explain how this info
will help the project make QGIS better. This is a fairly common approach in
software development for gathering non-intrusive and non-sensitive user
profile info. If implemented, it needs to be done in a discrete and
not-annoying manner, with the option (maybe in Help menu) to run the tool
and send the profile info at any time to the project.

Since this is an open source, community-driven project with very
active/helpful users, I think we may find many users opting to send the
profile info.

Regards,

Larry

I also believe a nice workflow should be in the qgis website somewhere.

We have a brief one here at
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/GIT_Workflow

Probably someone could update the above page and link it to the developer
help pages..

Below mentioned link mentions my workflow..what i observed with this is that
I no longer need to do a force push..

Agreed - we have been talking about that during the Zuerich HF.
Of course someone will object, but if we leave a clear and free choice there should
be no problem (think to Debian popcon for instance), and it will be very useful to
understand our user base.
One additional feautre would be to allow registered users to upload styles and SVGs,
possibly also (optionally) autoregister as osgeo user, to be able to open tickets.
Could you please open a feature request for this, so we'll remember your detailed specs?
Even better if you can start coding straight away, of course ;)
All the best.

Wow, I guess we are close to the first million of users in total!
In many administrations and enterprises usually only one copy is downloaded, and
centralized installations are done for tens of users.
It would be good to have a live query linked on our web site.
All the best.

Personally, I don't like prompts like that and I respond always NO,
just on principle, to discourage programmers to disturb me that way.

Even if you implement that and will be annoying users for a while,
what will be a result? Info about people willing to respond, which is
very limited group. No overall statistics about QGIS user base at all.

I also mostly behave like this, but for instance I respond YES to Debian popcon
because I trust and love Debian, and I understand providing anonymous data can help
the project.
You're right, we'll get data on the users that trust and love us, not on all.
Neverhteless, this is an important part of our user base, and we'll be able to
understand global trends anyway.
All the best.

I agree with Radim please don't make this a popup at the start of the
application. That would be really annoying.

If you would like to collect this information then I would happy to
have something that lives in the About menu that people can optionally
use and is non intrusive.

Right - why not adding it to the installation procedure instead?
This will work on windows, not on Linux though.

We can do that, but I guess very few people will use it.

Hi
Just out of Curiosity ..
Why are Download Statistics so important? Just to compare with "commercial"
Software and their selling amounts?
Personally I find download numbers interesting but .. well - we will never
know how many users we really have.
I also agree with Radim that such a question is annoying (but at least you
are going to get asked - and not just raped like with other software ;) )
Do we really have to counterfeit our own statistics?
I think we do have a lot of Users.. Isn't that enough?
Of course it would be interesting how many people are using it under MacOS
or Linux but .. what are we doing with that numbers?
Regarding the Windows downloads we have an increasing number of downloads
.. isn't that enough to know?
It's not that I am against such polls but .. what's the real benefit?

and this is not meant offending - I am really only interested why it would
be important to know exact numbers ..

kind regards
Werner

No offence. I think:
* exact numbers are not important
* distribution and trends are
* knowing better our user base will let us understand how we are doing, identify
potential opportunities, weakness and strengths - in short, to market QGIS; I know
that's a Bad Word among devs, and perhaps more generally in the Open Source
environment, but if taken sanely, it can help us expanding even more, e.g. locating
important local communities that can be involved in the project with specific actions
(yes, I'm thinking to my recent visits to Korea and Japan), and much more.
Having data helps understanding, and this is always good IMHO.
All the best.

For me I don't see it being worth the effort or annoyance to users.  You
might get some useful stats, but then again you might not. I'm not a guy
that hates having stats but I just don't think we should do it to users.

Would the plugin installer be able to give us a good idea of users as it
has to connect to the plugin repo and you could map IP address from there.

Dear list,

I have now tested the possibilities to integrate R Processing in Q-GIS. I
think it closes the huge gap in R of interactive visualization and also
gives the possibility to use R-functionality to non-R people!

I saw that a raster/vector file is loaded through rgdal and there is no
possibility to do it in the own way, such as the almost standard 'raster'
package that handles also out of RAM data!
In order to maintain the flexibility of R I think that arguments should be
passed as they are (path+file) and everybody would be free to benefit from
the entire R repository of functions.
Thanks Matteo

here an example for extracting and plotting pixels based on vector, point
or polygon shp file:

##[MyScr]=group
##vector=vector
##raster=raster
library(raster)

s <- shapefile(vector) % high level function from raster package, the
argument should be only the file path+ name
r <- brick(raster) % high level function from raster package, the argument
should be only the file path+ name

v <- extract(r,s)
##showplots
for(u in seq_along(v))
{
    val <- v[[u]]
    if(u>1) X11()


plot(x=1:ncol(val),ylim=c(min(val),max(val)),type="n",main=paste("Extraction
line",u),xlab="Band",ylab="Spectral")

    for(i in 1:nrow(val))
    {
       lines(val[i,],col=i)
    }
}

Matteo

Thanks for your ideas

you can tell SEXTANTE to use the raster package by using

##myraster=raster|R.Raster

instead of

##myraster=raster

This is already documented, but only in the github version of the
documentation, as it is something that is implemented only in the
development versino of SEXTANTE.

Anyway, your proposal seems interesting. I tried to save all the possible
effort from users developing R algorithms in SEXTANTE, but it's true that
you will have more flexibility by just getting the filename.

Honestly, I am not an R expert, so I will implement whatever you the R
users think is best. My goal is to make it easier for anyonen with a good
knowledge of R to adapt their algorithms to SEXTANTE and be able to call
them from QGIS. I am opne to all kind off suggestions, since, as I said, I
am not an R user and my knowledge of R is very limited.

Let's discuss this here in the list.. Hopefully other people using R and
SEXTANTE will give their opinion and we can decide what to do

Many thanks again for your help

Victor

Same here.

I would say that the web stats already give quite good idea: the
number of downloads of standalone installer give a rough idea of the
absolute number of installations, the other stats like geographical
distribution and clients' operating systems will probably copy the
real user base.

Sounds great!
I could imagine to have a default method (for raster/vector) to facilitate
the transfer of the data into R. I think rgdal is a quite low-level package
that is also used by the raster package. I think that at least for raster
data the package raster is the most advanced and most user-friendly package
at all and also the most diffused in the community.

to load a raster-file it has 3 function:
raster # used for single layer raster data
stack # used for multiple single- or multi-layer files loaded as 1
multilayer file (requires identical extent, proj and resolution for all
files), comparable with a BSQ file with separate sources
brick # used for a multi-layer image (tipically BIP, BIL)
# the problem could be here that the user has to know in advanced which one
to use. In most of the cases its fairly simple, or the function stack()
could handle every input, but I'm not sure it it is the best solution.

to write a raster file:
writeRaster
Normally the raster package writes everything to a tmp folder, writeRaster
is basically the function to move the file from the tmp to a definitive
location handing datatype, filename, driver etc.

For reading and writing vector data it presents some limited facilities,
but very simple to use, could also be suitable as a default method, and if
required it will be easy to amplify its functionality.
shapefile # uses readOGR/writeOGR and can handle only ESRI shapefiles....

>From my point of view I could imagine to have such default, but I think it
has to be easy to modify (as you wrote me!). I will try to mobilitate some
R-SIG-GEO members for this discussion.
I have tried:
##myraster=raster|R.Raster
and also
##myraster=raster|R.raster
but I was not successful. I'm using the developer version from git but I
don't know how to get to the documentation... Actually every time a script
has some non-conform values it disappears from the list...

Thanks!
Matteo

If you are using the latest version, you should have an example R script
called Advanced raster histogram, with the following code

##Classification=group

##Layer = raster|R.raster

##no_data_value = number 0

##showplots

Layer <- raster(Layer, 1)

NAvalue(Layer) = no_data_value

hist(as.matrix(Layer), breaks=100, xlab = basename(filename(Layer)))


It uses the raster package


What do you think of this solution? Leaving the current types "raster" and
"vector", which create the object in R, and then two additional ones
"rasterfile" and "vectorfile", that create the same interface but skip the
process of creating the obejct and pass the filename string to R. That woul
be more flexible, and not to complex.


For the latest docs, have a look at the QGIS doc repo:
http://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/tree/master/source/docs/user_manual/sextante

Hi All, 
as a user, I don't really like tools that collect info over the net. Even if
I trust QGIS community and it is Open Source, I know that some could find it
suspicious. 
Estimated stats on server side are sufficient to me. Quality, stability, and
maybe a way to reference how much fundig/ bid efforts   grow up could be a
perfect approach of QGIS health and maturity. I must say that on french
geomatics forum, QGIS thread have be growing so much these times, i don't
have any doubt. 

As a GIS administrator, I would really like to be able to collect stat of
what my users do, what datasource they use, plugin, how much projects, how
often. That would help me to target courses, data adminsitration efforts and
fundings for improvements. *Do you think I can achieve that with a python
plugin? *
I would also like to monitor qgis processes, (memory, cpu, write and read
files, web access stats...), but I think my sys admin is the good guy to do
this

*One thing maybe missing is crash automatic report to help diagnosing
recurrent crashes.  Thoughts? *

With the addition of "rasterfile" and "vectorfile" for me personally there
are no more wishes open. I think it is absolutely required as it makes
every individual solution possible. The same for the saving of the files.

Thanks again!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Shipping SAGA with QGIS
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7yYvD+kXZquED8S5imbZC+MWEDnWMYmG-xLGZ+_90sEDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Here is a question I want to raise up and that I think is worth discussing

The SEXTANTE-SAGA bindings are working more or less fine, and it's by
far easier to ensure they work correctly than the GRASS bindings,
since SAGA doesn't have so many "uncommon" features as GRASS and
integration is much more straightforward. For this reason, SAGA is my
first choice as the main algorithm provider in SEXTANTE. However,
still many people find confusing that you have to install SAGA
separately, and I think that should be solved.

Only with SAGA and the python algorithms, SEXTANTE would have more
than enough for 90% of all users, including advanced ones. The current
toolbox shows by default a list of algorithms divided by providers,
but there is an "easy" mode that shows just one group with categories,
and I have been working in manually classifying the available ones in
a set of homogeneos categories.

Having SAGA shipped by default with QGIS will allow to set that simple
mode by default and completely remove the need to install anything or
even know which application is computing the results (the interface
does not show any distinction between algorithms). I believe that is a
huge step in making SEXTANTE more accesible to everyone. A working
SEXTANTE that is enough for the vast majority of users would be ready
with a fresh QGIS install. The current interface would be available
for more advanced users (and with SAGA already available in it,
without having to do anything else)

Adding SAGA in windows is trivial (just unzip it and you are done),
and in linux it might be a bit more complex, but it should not be a
problem. Mac might be the biggest problem here.

I would like to know the opinion of everyone about this. From my point
of view, as I said, it will mean a great improvement.

Thanks in advance!

Victor

Hi,

Thanks for the feedback on my suggestion. Personally, I rarely send in info
like that as well (especially not to Apple!). So, I'm not exactly excited
about such a 'feature'. Just thought I should mention it as a means of
collecting data.

Couple of notes:

* An annoyance is something that happens often and users have to tolerate
(see Windows). I clearly proposed that such a tool only launch once on
first run of a new version (i.e., a major version like 2.0, not 2.0.1).
Users would probably not see the dialog again for at least 6-12 months, not
exactly annoying.

* Data like this is very useful. For example: there has been a couple of
attempts to define what the base required Qt version should be for 2.0
(still unresolved). Research on different versions shipping with different
Linux distributions was done, but there is zero data on how many users
actually use QGIS on those platforms. If we knew less than 1% (even from
the profiler's sampling) used Qt 4.5 or 4.6, it would weigh on whether to
set the base requirement to 4.6 or 4.7.


However, +1 for R?gis's idea of having a crash reporter, or at least a
means of generating an output text file with anonymous app data for
manually sending to developers or the issue tracker to help debug user
issues.

Regards,

Larry

Well so it's not 100% true that we don't know about the Ubuntu install
base at all. I have written a script to scrape the data from Launchpad.
Tim has a copy of this (It's actually publicly available). We also have
a good idea from the logs on our own server how many people pull debs
from qgis.org

The only people that leaves out is those who use the stock version that
ships with a distro. So it's not perfect but I bet you can get a rough
minimum guess at the number of Ubuntu/Debian users. Based on the mailing
lists and IRC I actually think Linux is a significant portion of our
user base.

I also think the logs of how many unique IPs trigger a fetch of
available python plugins is reasonable number too, those requests may or
may not (but could be modified) have a different agent get logged.
That may be the fastest, unintrusive solution.

Thanks,
Alex

PS: I'll go dig up and run the script to see what the numbers say.

I'm in favor on Linux of making it a recommended package, and the same
for osgeo4w. QGIS at least on Ubuntu can and will install without GRASS,
SAGA should behave the same way. It just usually does get installed.
This is a simple change to the packaging rules.

I have no opinion on if to bundle it in the standalone installer for
windows.

Thanks,
Alex

As a separate installer from a standard QGIS?

In which case what about a SAGA for QGIS download package & an R for QGIS as well?

Users can download the core QGIS, then add R &/or SAGA, already set up for QGIS, if they so desire. R/SAGA users who have already installed their software wouldn't need to.

Hi all

Here is a question I want to raise up and that I think is worth discussing

The SEXTANTE-SAGA bindings are working more or less fine, and it's by
far easier to ensure they work correctly than the GRASS bindings,
since SAGA doesn't have so many "uncommon" features as GRASS and
integration is much more straightforward. For this reason, SAGA is my
first choice as the main algorithm provider in SEXTANTE. However,
still many people find confusing that you have to install SAGA
separately, and I think that should be solved.

Only with SAGA and the python algorithms, SEXTANTE would have more
than enough for 90% of all users, including advanced ones. The current
toolbox shows by default a list of algorithms divided by providers,
but there is an "easy" mode that shows just one group with categories,
and I have been working in manually classifying the available ones in
a set of homogeneos categories.

Having SAGA shipped by default with QGIS will allow to set that simple
mode by default and completely remove the need to install anything or
even know which application is computing the results (the interface
does not show any distinction between algorithms). I believe that is a
huge step in making SEXTANTE more accesible to everyone. A working
SEXTANTE that is enough for the vast majority of users would be ready
with a fresh QGIS install. The current interface would be available
for more advanced users (and with SAGA already available in it,
without having to do anything else)

Adding SAGA in windows is trivial (just unzip it and you are done),
and in linux it might be a bit more complex, but it should not be a
problem. Mac might be the biggest problem here.

I would like to know the opinion of everyone about this. From my point
of view, as I said, it will mean a great improvement.

Thanks in advance!

Victor

On the page you referenced above, step #13 will probably return something
like the following:

$ git push origin branch-test
 To git at github.com:dakcarto/Quantum-GIS.git
  ! [rejected]        branch-test -> branch-test (non-fast-forward)
 error: failed to push some refs to 'git at github.com:

behind
 hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
 hint: before pushing again.
 hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Regardless of whether the feature branch is part of a pull request, if you
locally rebased it (from master in this case) and have already pushed it to
your github fork, I believe you will always then have to do a force push.

Regards,

Larry

I think the plugin call backs + repo are a good idea. The IP address are 
a little sensitive info.
But he plugin is already connecting to our servers already, so if we 
maybe add a little info like:
- unique uuid, generated during instalL (in .qgis, just for counting)
- QGIS version used
- OS (and maybe type of installer?)

(if that is working, maybe we can add some more stats?)

Or is this too simple?

Richard

Hi,

If the developers dealing with bugs think that the data of a
crash-reporter is useful for debugging I would also think it is good
idea to include a crash reporter.

In Autodesk software there are crash reports. Depending on the patterns,
users even get a message that the problem got fixed with a hotfix or
service pack.

Hi,

If we do collect data, we should clearly inform the users about this
data collection (and what data is stored) - and add an option to opt out
from this data collection.

It is hard to build trust, but easy to loose trust.

Of course I would also be curious about the stats ;-)

I totally agree with Andreas. Open Source drains people who like freedom. We
take a risk of loosing some trust with collecting stats. 
If dev's agree that a crash reporter is important, could we start another
thread to have a more precise idea of what we need? (crash, but maybe also
python error execution) 
I'd be happy to help funding this, since I think 2.0 will require an
important testing effort to reach a stable state. If you want me t help on
that, help me to write some specs ;-)

Cheers

Hi victor, i agree with you. 
I do prefer to use sextante also for basic operations already present in
qgis menu.
It seems to me it is faster and i  more appreciate  temporary results
instead of the duty of creating definitive layers.
I don't know if it is correct, but could it be possible to include saga in
osgeo installer package?

Hi!

Although I have to say that I'd like to have an easy install, I am against
including everything in the installer ..
Wouldn't it be possible to just write something like an automated
downloader and Installer..
Something that asks: "Would you like to download and install also SAGA?"
Probably that can be done generally to include more than one external
programms there?
Nevertheless it will always be an "Installer" problem .. So maybe it's
enough to give hints where to find the programs and let the users install.
I think as the User found QGIS - he will also be able to find SAGA (with
small hints) and other programs.

That's just my 2?

kind regards
Werner

Thanks for the feedback

I agree that it is better to keep things separate, but at the same
time, the easier it is to have it all installed, the better for the
final user.

I am planning to improve the checkings that are performed before an
external algorithm is run, not just to check if the software is there
or if a folder is configured (which can be a wrong folder), but to
actually run a small algorithm, like a unit test. Maybe the first time
that a SAGA or OTB algorithm is run, we can show the user a notice
saying "Do you want SEXTANTE to check that the external application is
correctly installed and configured?". and in case it is not, tell the
user how to install it.

I think this will avoid having users trying to run an algorithm that
is not prepared to be run. From all the questions and reports I get
about issues in SEXTANTE, some are caused by bugs in SEXTANTE or some
data problem, but most are due to wrong setting of external apps or,
in most cases, people not even knowing that you have to install them
separately. I do not know how to easily solve this, but it clearly
should be a priority...

Thanks again

It seems very strange coming from OpenBSD to split packages. In OpenBSD
packages are bundled together as far as possible which makes sense (less
hassle to maintain).

IMHO, the plugins and functionality which is thought to be core, should be
included in a default install. But not for something whose target audience
is very small. This way it keeps it simple for most users.

However, if a plugin install is complex, and it can be solved by installer,
the plugin should be pushed to default install. This is very helpful for
testing and less hassle for development, you will also avoid emails hitting
the mailing lists about such issues.

>>Mac might be the biggest problem here. 

On Mac, SAGA should be distributed and installed as a normal OS X framework,
the way GDAL and PROJ are done. Mac users already download and install the
GDAL Complete.dmg package separately in order to run QGIS, so doing the same
with a SAGA.dmg package would not be a problem.

Currently you have to build SAGA 2.1.0 yourself to use it on Mac, so it's a
matter of someone creating the framework package and making it available
somewhere. It's also possible to create a package that installs saga_cmd and
the SAGA libraries in the standard Unix locations (/usr/local/bin, etc.),
but the Mac way would be to place them in a framework instead.

http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20SAGA%20on%20Mac%20OS%20X

I tried installing SEXTANTE just now on a Mac but it crashed with a missing
"psycopg2" error message. This is not a standard Python package on Mac.
Probably installing this psycopg2 would be a bigger issue than installing
SAGA. It looks as though there are two ways to do it: compile it from
terminal command line or install via fink or MacPorts - neither of these is
likely to be something a non-developer QGIS user would be comfortable doing.

Thanks.

-Phil

I see now that psycopg2 is also provided as a Mac package here:

http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/python

Installing Psycopg2-2.4.5-2.dmg allows the SEXTANTE installation to complete
successfully.

However, SEXTANTE doesn't seem to know about my SAGA:

"It seems that SAGA is not correctly installed in your system.
Please install it before running SAGA algorithms."

Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bounty on DXF output
Message-ID: <51296DEA.90501@productivewaterservices.com.au>

Hi Team QGIS,

I would like to offer a bounty of sorts for further work on the ability 
of QGIS to export dxf. In the first instance, I would be interested in 
replies on what is able to be reasonably achieved.

The bounty is a Motorola XOOM Android tablet with accessories, bluetooth 
keyboard with touchpad, OtterBox case and cables.

http://www.motorola.com/Support/AU-EN/Consumer-Support/TABLETS/MOTOROLA_XOOM
http://www.otterbox.com/MOTOROLA-XOOM-Defender-Series-Case/MOT2-XOOM1,default,pd.html

It has been used briefly but I think it represents an attractive bounty, 
equivalent ~ US$450 ~$900 new. Free shipped to any reasonable address 
(maybe even the hackfest at Valmiera). It is surplus to my requirements 
(didn't get that project) and I hope it is a match with the desired 
improvements in the code.

The dev work:-
As far as I know;
QGIS has not exported useful dxf's for some time, owing mainly to the 
OGR/GDAL driver, see
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5451
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4973
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4381

This proposal is at least for the Windows build and ideally a plugin 
ASAP for the stable release, but will be satisfied with 2.0 if the 
roadmap matches. The test case would be outputting 2 shapefiles (point 
and line) with 2 attributes and 20 features being able to be read by 
AutoDesk DWG Trueview. Another resource is DoubleCAD (it is free and can 
read current dxf's from QGIS) but it will not be the testbed.

My impression is that templates play a role in dxf export. Perhaps a 
dialog could be used to point the driver to a template and in the case 
of this bounty one template would be available. Other workers would 
build there own templates and the dialog would allow them to select these.

My interest does not extend to dxf import,
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5383
however the bounty hunter is free to explore the requirements there. Nor 
is there any specific requirement for DWG export.
http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/spike/dxfdwg/drv_dxfdwg.html

I have little awareness of the issues on the GDAL side, but these might 
be start
http://fwarmerdam.blogspot.com.au/2010/07/ogr-dxf-upgrade.html
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/4369

And of course will be support all beta testing etc. Please let me know 
if the scope of this request is reasonable.

Bill,
A humble user

If your backend (backend: Qt4Agg)  is not specified in the file matplotlibrc
(see  Customizing matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html?highlight=matplotlibrc>  )

you must first open a matplotlib figure/window:

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   fig = plt.figure()
   ax = fig.gca()
   plot([1,2,3,4])
   plt.show()

or use pylab

   import pylab
   pylab.plot([1,2,3,4])
   pylab.show()

Hi

Any particular reason you are using mingw rather than msvc 2008 (which is
well supported)?

So I guess you want this:

License should be free, I guess.

Well - we've been in Hannover, Vienna, Pisa, Z?rich and Essen without
naming the release after the town..
And by the way there will be a new release there will be Valmiera among
them ..
So we have plenty of choices ;) ..
It seems that either we should release more often or meet less often *gg*
No, just a joke ..
But I think there is no policy about which place to choose .. so will we
always take the name of the latest hackfest town?

I think for 2.0 we should really think about it ..
(personally I would vote for Z?rich because swizerland it very active in
using QGIS an promoting it)

But what is the release plan anyway? Is there already a date - or shall
we discuss in Valmiera?

kind regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Unencrypted login to QGIS hub.qgis.org !
Message-ID: <20130224113129.GA15767@jive.mgras.de>

Hi,
I planned to report a bug concerning building QGIS trunk on my (my
wife's) PeeCee at home and while loggin into "hub.qgis.org/login" I
noticed that this site:

a) Apparently authenticates against OSGeo LDAP, but
b) is not capable of properly retrieving the real name and EMail
   address from OSGeo LDAP,
c) does *not* enforce HTTP SSL encryption at login and, moreover
d) does not even *permit* HTTP SSL encryption at login.

While b) just lets you *look* bad, c) is very bad style and d) is very
bad overall, because you're compromising OSGeo passwords.  Please
*always* add proper encryption whenever authentication is affected.

Thanks,
	Martin.

To be honest there's no particular reason, but I will let you in on how
I/we decided on Mingw64

We are developing a cross platform application with GIS as one of the
application's modes.
We decide to use QGis libraries to provide the GIS functionality.
I played around with your(Tim Sutton) examples to use QGis widgets in a Qt
application, and with that created a Qt plugin that i tested in a sample
application to load the plugin, display the map canvas on a QFrame, to load
a geotiff , and to use the various maptools.

All this was done on a Ubuntu 12.04 64bit environment with Qt.

We would like to the same for Win7 64bit.
So I thought while i am going to use Qt 64bit on Win7 with Mingw64 i might
as well try to everything in Mingw64.

I hoped that the Qgis libs would already be available in 64bit for windows,
after reading mailing list postings of Nov 2012
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/64bit-Windows-version-td5016852.html ,
but it looks like it did not materialise. According to the mailing
list thread it looks like there is interest for a 64bit version on Windows
for QGis.

So that's how i decided on Mingw64 and to be honest i have no experience in
the MS development tools, will it be possible then to build Qgis 64bit
 version with msvc 2008 and use the libraries in Qt64 bit?
I have no idea.

Suggestions will be appreciated, thank you.

Regards
Theuns Heydenrych

Hi

For the InaSAFE plugin upcoming release I have implemented a sentry[1]
client that pushes all tracebacks to [2]. Its totally opt in via the
options dialog and it allows us to gather useful metrics about where
and how often certain exceptions are raised. Of course its python only
but it would be great to provide the same functionality from within
QGIS directly (see code at [3]).

Regards

Tim

The porblem is that typically you need ALL dependent libs compiled as
64 bit which is a big chore if you are trying to focus on your app. My
suggestion would be to go with a 32 bit build since a) you will be
heading into uncharted waters running QGIS  and its dep stack on win
as 64 bit and b) osgeo4w provides all the dependencies for you as 32
bit binaries already so thats going to save you hours / days of work.

The INSTALL.txt [1] document provided with the source provides a
detailed step-by-step guide guide that to be honest does not require
much windows knowledge and will give you the compilation platform you
need to build your own  custom QGIS binaries.

By the way there are also a couple of articles on my blog (e.g. [2])
describing how to package up QGIS for Windows as a standalone
installer when you are done.

Hope that helps!

Regards

Tim

Phil

Thanks for you help. Unfortunately, I do not use Mac and cannot test
SEXTANTE in Mac.

The psycopg library is used by algorithms connecting with PostGIS, and
I (wrongly) assumed it should be in all computers where QGIS is
installed. I will add some checking to ensure that it is found and, if
not, disable the corresponding algorithms but not the whole SEXTANTE
plugin

Regarding the error you see when executing SAGA, In Mac it is
performing the same check than in Linux, but it seems that it is not
working fine, even if SAGA is actually installed. Making SEXTANTE run
a small test algorithm and check the result sounds like a better
option, which would work for all OS's

Thanks again for your help.

Victor

I would be very much in favour of shipping SAGA bundled in with the
OSX and Windows standalone installers. It creates a much better 'out
of the box' experience and works better in environments where there is
little / no internet available.

I agree that Linux should maybe be considered differently than Windows
and Mac OSX, and that in these two the experience would be much better
and much easier for the average user (that's basically why I was
proposing this) if SAGa is included by default.

In case we decide to move in this direction, what is needed before we
can package SAGA with QGIS? I guess some expertise in Mac OS is
needed, and some extra testing for SEXTANTE. The Windows part is much
easier, since, as I metioned, there's nothing to do but copying the
executable in a folder know by SEXTANTE.

Cheers

:-( I was not aware of that decision on splashes,
anyway I'd like very much see a different splash
in the new release slightly more elegant and if possible
with squared borders, keeping the same logic.

I also issued a new topic in the bug tracker [1],
so everyone may leave any feedback on it.
I will put there the SVG version of my proposed.

BTW, thanks for your replies !

A few questions/comments, and a big problem.  (I've been sortof paying attention to all the SEXTANTE discussion and development)

Is saga a requirement for sextante or optional?

Saga appears to be an application on its own, with an optional Python interface.  I'd rather not bundle this IN the QGIS app, though it would be OK bundled alongside QGIS in the distribution.

Does sextante use only the Python interface to Saga, or does it also run Saga command line tools and/or Saga GUI tools?

The Problem: Saga needs wxWidgets.  QGIS runs 64bit on OS X.  To get a 64bit wxWidgets on OS X you need to use the Cocoa APIs.  Support for this is only in wx 2.9 (in development, but mostly complete).  The latest stable Saga, 2.0.8, does not support wx 2.9.  The dev Saga sources (2.1) support wx 2.9, but it's only a beta at this time (I need to figure out the autotools stuff to generate configure to be able to try it).

SAGA is optional, but adding it makes a huge difference, so somehow,
you can say it is not so optional if you want to do serious work with
SEXTANTE.

SEXTANTE does not use the Python interface. It only calls SAGA on the
command line. GUI tools are not used at all, and there would be no
need to include them.

> The Problem: Saga needs wxWidgets.  QGIS runs 64bit on OS X.  To get a 64bit wxWidgets on OS X you need to use the Cocoa APIs.

The GUI tools are not needed, so, if the command line tool does not
use wxWidgets, that wouldn't be a problem. But I think it might use
some non-GUI classes from wxWidgets, we should check it

>>But I think it might use some non-GUI classes from wxWidgets, we should

Correct. saga_cmd and the SAGA libraries are linked against wxWidgets, just
as QGIS and its framework libraries are linked against Qt - there's no
getting away from wxWidgets with SAGA, just as there's no getting away from
Qt with QGIS.

I looked into why SEXTANTE's shelling to saga_cmd fails. For some reason,
the path that QGIS's Python environment sees does not include
/usr/local/bin, whereas a simple Python script like this does include it and
shelling works fine:

import os, subprocess
print os.environ['PATH']
subprocess.Popen("saga_cmd", shell=True)

I don't know why this path is different in QGIS than in Python launched from
a Terminal command line, but that's the fix: either add the full path to
saga_cmd or figure out a way to get the full environment path.

Thanks.

-Phil

Yup, I've been aware of it and have been constantly asking the qgis PSC
to sign up for a free SSL cert from StartSSL. I can sign up for the cert
and just have it emailed to me but much preferred that the qgis admins
had the account it was under.

Thanks,
Alex

If you are talking about OS X, then `.app` bundles don't inherit
environment variables from the same places Terminal apps do (i.e they don't
pay attention to `~/.profile` and such). There is a good answer on
StackOverflow that runs through the possible places to set environment
variables:

Hi Alex

I tried again to go in to startssl to get a cert but the site just
times out all the time for me. Could one of the other PSC members look
into this and provide Alex what is needed?

You are correct, sir, although in testing I see that it's not really a
difference between .app GUI apps and console apps, but rather how an app is
launched. So starting QGIS by double-clicking QGIS.app means that
/usr/local/bin is not in the env. path, but starting it from the Terminal
like this means that /usr/local/bin _is_ in the path:

open /Applications/QGIS.app

Another fix might be for a future SAGA package to create a symlink to
saga_cmd in /usr/bin - that's always on the env. path regardless of how QGIS
is launched.

Thanks.

-Phil

The procedure for windows I would use...
Add it to osgeo4w as a separate package. Change the QGIS express
installer rules to include it. After that we can easily include it in
the standalone installer which is repackaged from osgeo4w.

Thanks,
Alex

Bad wording on my part. The difference I was pointing out is indeed between
"stuff that is launched through the desktop, including methods like double
click" and "stuff that is launched through the command line, including
methods like running open".

Just another point: Openstreetmap just recently crossed the border of
2^31 Nodes, which spoils the use of the current plugin.

See:

Is it worth opening a ticket?

No, putting symlinks (or anything) in /usr/* (other than /usr/local of course) is bad form on OS X.  /usr is for what Apple puts there.  User-installed stuff should be installed in /usr/local.  (Unfortunately, Qt does put some tools in /usr/bin, oh well).  The default PATH on OSX does include /usr/local/bin, for the shell at least, maybe not for apps.

There is a new feature in QGIS to set environment variables explicitly designed for stuff like this.  But it's not in 1.8, so it won't help sextante there.  Maybe to be sure, sextante needs its own env prefs, like the GDAL tools has.

>>Unfortunately, Qt does put some tools in /usr/bin, oh well

As do Java and Mono, but I agree: /usr/local/bin should be good enough.

Perhaps SEXTANTE could just check for the existence of the saga_cmd file in
a couple of logical places, for example, in /usr/local/bin or, if not found
there, look in (per GDAL convention, etc.):

/Library/Frameworks/SAGA.framework/programs

With Windows, a peek at the registry would give the install location for
systems where the InnoSetup installer was run to install SAGA. This would
avoid the need for the user to configure the SAGA folder in SEXTANTE. For
example, with 2.0.8, the InstallDir value under this registry key could be
used:

SOFTWARE\SAGA User Group Association\SAGA GIS\2.0.8

Thanks.

-Phil

Hi Andre

No, it's not really worth opening a ticket. I will be pushing new OSM
implementation to master in the following days. The new implementation uses
64bit ids,. The current provider+plugin combo will be removed.

Thanks everyone for your help.

As far as I see, the following sounds like a good solution.

- In Linux, let users install SAGA independently and assume the SAGA
folder is in PATH (That is, leave it like now)
- In Windows, the user should configure the SAGA folder, but SEXTANTE
will try to infere it by looking at the registry (or, if we ship SAGA
with QGIS, by pointing it to the folder where is can be found)
- In Mac, since there seems to be problems, I would let the user
select the folder itself, and not infere anything from the system or
assume any path. It seems that SAGA is not easy to install in Mac, so
if someone can do it, probably he can configure SEXTANTE correctly.

Anyway, since I know absolutely zero about Mac OS and do not have a
Mac to test, I would need someone to run some simple analysis in SAGA
using saga_cmd and send it to me, so I can see exactly how to do it.
That includes setting any environment variables (as it is done now for
the Windows version), or any other thing that might be needed, so I
can set it to run on Mac (or at least, try to...)

I have included a test before a SAGA algorithm is run, which actually
calls SAGA and computes voronoi polygons for a tiny layer, so it takes
almost no time, but if it passes that test, it means SAGA can work
from SEXTANTE. This way, it is now impossible to get a "Layer not
found" error due to SAGA not being installed and configured, since the
algorithm will not even launch. The test is not run everytime an
algorithm is run. Once it passes, SEXTANTE will not test for that
anymore and assume it is correctly configured from that moment.

I will add similar checks for the other algorithm providers

Thanks again for you help!

With a prepared package distribution, SAGA will be simple to install, like
GDAL.

You don't need to set any environment variables to run saga_cmd.

Note that some of the saga_cmd commands may have changed. For example, SAGA
Wetness Index now has several new params and the old "t" param is gone.

What would you like run and sent to you?

Thanks.

Hi Nyall,
I haven't had need to tweak the tile size so I can't offer any advice there.However I have had success adding authenticated WMS layers to 1.8 with this code:
if len(self.user) > 0 :	connectionString = "username=" + self.user + ",password=" + self.password + ",url=" + self.urlelse:	connectionString = self.url
crs = self.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationCrs().authid()
layer = QgsRasterLayer(0, connectionString, self.title, "wms",[self.layername], ["default"], "image/png", crs)
if layer.isValid():	QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layer)
This code manually adds the username, and password parameters to the connection string, you may want to try something similar with your URI.

I looked at it today.  They have a good wiki page on compiling for OS X, and I got it compiled with minor tweaks.  Now that I understand how Saga is used in Sextante, and how Saga in installed, I think Saga could be bundled with QGIS.  The saga_cmd would be in the app package bin/ where it would be found automatically by QGIS, and the libraries in lib/.

If saga_cmd loads command libraries by relative path (ie ../lib/saga, as they are installed), this would work simply without any environment settings.

But if saga loads them by absolute path (ie the configured --prefix), and there is no env setting to set a different path, this would be bad since it would lock down the whole QGIS app to the build path (a Mac app should work if the user moves or renames it, though it is kindof discouraged since it confuses installers).  I could try an easy test outside of sextante/qgis by renaming my saga install folder and trying to run a simple command.

Does it look like something worth creating as a framework? Having the
commandline saga might be useful for some if it is not nontrivial.

Thanks for this -- I've managed to solve this one now. Turns out the
username and password can be set through QgsDataSourceURI() by:

uri.setParam("username", "xx")
uri.setParam("password", "xx")

(rather then setUsername/setPassword).

The tilesize are set by the parameters maxWidth/maxHeight:

uri.setParam("maxWidth", "512")
uri.setParam("maxHeight", "512")

Cheers,
Nyall

Well, the OS X build wiki page says you can package it as an app, which makes sense, though it's not part of the standard make install.  The saga_gui program is what gets launched in that case.

Hi Bill,

The problem around DXF export is a known-issue and work has already
started (in QGIS master) to solve the problem. However, it is a
time-consuming and complicated task. Most of the improvements have to be
done in QGIS, some fixes/additions would need to be done in OGR.

The following sub-items have to be developed:

1. Translation of QGIS styling to OGR feature styling. As good as
possible (more complex symbols do not translate well - or need to be
export the same feature multiple times). Honoring style rules and map
scales for the export (one keeps the original coordinates, but still
exports with the rules of a particular map scale (e.g. for a 1:1000 scale))

2. Allow to specify the DXF layer to be used for the export by -
requires an attribute called "LAYER" - not sure if this can be any
attribute or would be limited to the attribute called "layer".

3. Allow to export multiple QGIS layers into one DXF file with multiple
layers.

4. Text label export from both manual and automatic placement - OGR
feature styles allow text label exports. Export functionality should
build around it.

5. Conversion of simple markers and SVG markers to DXF blocks

All of the above means a development effort of approx. 200 hours. I can
tell you the exact numbers if you are interested. Part one - one of the
larger chunks is already financed and implemented by company Sourcepole.

The Swiss QGIS user group (and some Austrian QGIS users) have a strong
interest in fixing these issues and started funding it. Part 1 is
already done.

We are still looking for sponsors for parts 2-5.

Please note that DWG is a totally different thing than DXF. All of the
above applies only to DXF, but also partially for other formats that
support OGR feature styling, like DGN, MapInfo and KML.

This is to let you know that development efforts are under way and that
we are looking for financing of parts of it. The work is done by a
professional company with contracts - so the hardware bounty is
unfortunately not an option here. Of course, the work items / contracts
can be split up to different amounts.

IMHO the Good Way would be to split saga_gui and saga_cmd packages, and include only
the latter. We have been discussing about this in the saga ML, and my understanding
is that this is feasible, but may require some work upstream.
Bringing wxpy requirement in qgis package is likely to create some trouble so bettar
avoiding it if possible.
All the best.

You mean wxWidgets?   wxpython is already used to GRASS.

Right in OSGeo4W (and in turn in the standalone installer).

It is bundled in the OS X GRASS, but *inside* the package for GRASS use, not alongside as a global install.  Having an app use libraries from another app is messy and fragile.  (I know QGIS uses GRASS libraries, and this has always bugged me)

If saga_gui and saga_cmd can be split (I assume that means saga_cmd would not need wx?), that would be great.

saga_gui is just one file, so leaving that out wouldn't save you much.
saga_cmd and the module libraries do depend on wx libraries. You could try
building wxWidgets without monolithic enabled and then see if any of the
individual wx .dylibs can be omitted. I would guess that wouldn't save you
much either.

Python bindings are not needed to run saga_cmd from SEXTANTE.

Thanks.

Hi all,

I have been asked to make some test with the new Oracle support and I
have been granted access to a DB, but before I had to connect to a
(Cisco) VPN.

I found the overall performances very slow if compared to PostGIS, but
I'm not really sure it was qgis fault.

Any feedback?

cheers!

The current definitions are ok for saga 2.0.8.

Once 2.1 is out, I think a review of all of them should be made.
Hopefully, by that time we will have unit tests for all algorithms,
and we will be able to check that automatically

Just any SAGA algorithm, to see how it is executed in the command
line. A valid command line that, if run in a batch file created by
SEXTANTE, would execute SAGA correctly

If there is no need to set any variable, how do I use the config path
entered by the user? As I said, I think it is OK to keep than config
parameter as in the Windows version, but with that prepared package,
maybe better to go for the unix-like configuration and assume SAGA it
is already in PATH? In windows, PATH is changed before executing the
batch file.

Sorry for my ignorance about Mac :-)

Thanks again!

Cheers
Victor

could we use that with an old map?
It would be great

Hi Andreas,

thank you for your reply, now I am wiser. So there is a roadmap?
I find the parallels with the improvement of exporting to kml 
interesting. For me, export to DXF puts the output in the hands of a 
specialised user who will apply their own styling or manipulate the 
output in some way. Export to kml on the other hand is to generally 
create a package for presentation.
I see a focus on integration of an existing QGIS map into a dxf, a 
process to transport the complete diagram. These are understandable 
aspirations. But could you comment on the compliance with the dxf 
format, a more elementary requirement considering the current state of 
dxf output in stable QGIS?
I acknowledge the prerogative of those dev's who are working on it, but 
I am in search of wisdom!
I note that in many cad packages, the workflow to ingest point data and 
produce a dxf (or to create a "terrain") is not trivial. There seems to 
be reliance on the purchase of additional functionality for the cad 
system. There is some value in QGIS being able to deliver such a simple 
type of output in a compliant way.

regards
BillW

DXF output Message-ID: <512B218F.9060300 at carto.net> Content-Type: 
text/plain; charset=UTF-8 Hi Bill, The problem around DXF export is a 
known-issue and work has already started (in QGIS master) to solve the 
problem. However, it is a time-consuming and complicated task. Most of 
the improvements have to be done in QGIS, some fixes/additions would 
need to be done in OGR. The following sub-items have to be developed: 1. 
Translation of QGIS styling to OGR feature styling. As good as possible 
(more complex symbols do not translate well - or need to be export the 
same feature multiple times). Honoring style rules and map scales for 
the export (one keeps the original coordinates, but still exports with 
the rules of a particular map scale (e.g. for a 1:1000 scale)) 2. Allow 
to specify the DXF layer to be used for the export by - requires an 
attribute called "LAYER" - not sure if this can be any attribute or 
would be limited to the attribute called "layer". 3. Allow to export 
multiple QGIS layers into one DXF file with multiple layers. 4. Text 
label export from both manual and automatic placement - OGR feature 
styles allow text label exports. Export functionality should build 
around it. 5. Conversion of simple markers and SVG markers to DXF blocks 
All of the above means a development effort of approx. 200 hours. I can 
tell you the exact numbers if you are interested. Part one - one of the 
larger chunks is already financed and implemented by company Sourcepole. 
The Swiss QGIS user group (and some Austrian QGIS users) have a strong 
interest in fixing these issues and started funding it. Part 1 is 
already done. We are still looking for sponsors for parts 2-5. Please 
note that DWG is a totally different thing than DXF. All of the above 
applies only to DXF, but also partially for other formats that support 
OGR feature styling, like DGN, MapInfo and KML. This is to let you know 
that development efforts are under way and that we are looking for 
financing of parts of it. The work is done by a professional company 
with contracts - so the hardware bounty is unfortunately not an option 
here. Of course, the work items / contracts can be split up to different 
amounts. Andreas Am 24.02.2013 02:33, schrieb Bill Williamson:

In the U.S. the color aquamarine (the blue you have used) is heavily
associated with the 1950's-60's, and generally not in a flattering way. As
such a color, IMHO it brings up connotations of being out-of-touch with
modern values and design idioms. Please try the splash screen with a
different base color, which has deeper, richer tones, and maybe a very
slight gradient, if you have the time.

Also, a redesign of the main 'Q' logo may dictate what complimentary or
background colors are used in the new splash screen. So, maybe that logo
redesign needs to be addressed or finished before more definitive work on a
new splash screen.

Best regards,

Larry

I assume you would want to suppress all but error messages. Example to
create a SAGA grid:

saga_cmd -f=s io_gdal 0 -GRIDS dem.sgrd -FILES dem.asc

If an error occurs, saga_cmd still outputs it even with s (silent) switch.
For example, if input grid does not exist:

ERROR 4: `dem.ascx' does not exist in the file system,
and is not recognised as a supported dataset name.

error: Dataset creation failed: `dem.ascx' does not exist in the file
system,
and is not recognised as a supported dataset name.

error: executing module [GDAL: Import Raster]

Thanks.

-Phil

Thanks for using my idea. I had the same intention, and accidentially
saw that you used a quiet new (openstreet)map of Essen already in your
first try ;-)

For your new proposal, I would prefer to see the main text away from the
interesting parts of the picture, for example more to the bottom.

Greetings,
Andr? Joost

Yes, same here, going for non rounded and modern look is super, but the 
aquamarine breaks it all a bit. and mybe have the map a bit more saturated.

Hi,

I agree with Larry's assessment that the color feels out of touch with
modern style unfortunately.
On the other hand, I really like the squared corners as I've already
written in an answer to http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7211.

Do we keep the discussion here or should we rather move it to the bug
tracker where it could be recorded together with all evolutionary
steps of the design?

Best wishes
Anita

Without knowing more about your particular programming background, I
suggest you look through the open tickets that have no one assigned to
them. Make a short list of things that sounds interesting to you that
you think you might be able to solve, then ask for more details about
those if you need.

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues
(Search for open tickets Assigned to none)

Thanks,
Alex

	2013)
Message-ID: <20130226111954.2e1ae0df@nature.speedport.ip>

Dear QGIS Community,

as you probably know, the FOSS4G conference 2013 will take place in
Nottingham from 17th - 21st September and we are happy that we are able to
combine it with the 10th QGIS hackfest.

Saber Razmjooei and Peter Wells from Lutra Consulting offered to host the
hackfest in Brighton from 12.-16. September 2013 right before the FOSS4G
(17th-21st September 2013). 

For people who are interested in going to FOSS4G afterwards it is not a long
trip from Brighton to Nottingham and we will try to organize the transfer.

As usual you will find all information in the wiki (not much to see yet):
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/10_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Brighton_2013

We will start planning after the hackfest in Valmiera, which will take place
soon from 11th - 14th of April 2013:

Ok, I dropped the aquamarine color and I changed something (not much).
Here the new look: http://lrssvt.ns0.it/img/splash_simple_new.png

Yes, you're right, I started the topic for that reason !
I just added there the SVG version so everybody can work on it !

Thanks for your feedback!

5 of the configuration guide (https://github.com/qgis/qgis-web-client)
I'm using this rule:

RewriteRule wms/([^/]+)$
cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/var/www/qgis-web-client/projects/$1.qgs

It works well: when I browse http://THE_HOST/wms/example on firefox the
server returns the cgi script result whit parameter
map=/var/www/.../example.qgs
Then I've set

var serverAndCGI = "http://THE_HOST/wms/"

in GlobalOptions.js instead of the full url.

The problem shows up when Qgis-web-client trys to use the cgi script:
instead of call /wms/example/?params it calls /wms/NOTHING/?params. (as you
can see)

[16:09:20.950] GET
http://THE_HOST/wms//?&_dc=1361891360854&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3&REQUEST=GetProjectSettings[HTTP/1.1
404 Not Found 126ms]

What am I forgetting to configure?
Thanks in advance.

Hi,

You always have to specify a project path and project name with QGIS web
client. Regardless whether you use URL rewriting or not. The client does
not work without project path and name.

So a correct URL to start the client would be:

http://hostname/maps/projectpath/projectname?optionalParameters

Of course this all depends on your setup.

This whole URL rewriting is a bit complex to set up. Before you do it I
would recommend you test the client without URL rewriting, e.g. with a
URL like:

http://hostname/qgiswebclient.html?map=/home/web/qgis-web-client/projects/naturalearth_110million.qgs&format=image/png&visibleLayers=Rivers,Glaciated%20Areas,Lakes,Land,Ocean

For 'var serverAndCGI = "http://THE_HOST/wms/"' I recommend to not
specify the servername, in case you move the whole thing to another
server. Better would be:

var serverAndCGI = "/wms/"

Hope this helps a bit?

Andreas

Thanks for your answer.
First, I'd corrected serverAndCGI value.

Without any redirect rule all works perfectly.
Currently I have only one RedirectRule that redirects any
*/wms/project*request to
*qgis_mapserv.fcgi* script),

 <Directory /var/www/qgis-web-client/site/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride all
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteRule wms/([^/]+)$
http://vega.faunalia.it/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/var/www/qgis-web-client/projects/$1.qgs[QSA,L]

  </Directory>


so I access to QGIS web client at this url (the actual one):

http://vega.faunalia.it/qgis-web-client/site/qgiswebclient.html?map=/var/www/qgis-web-client/projects/candela.qgs


Is it correct? It has full project path with project name in *map* request
parameter.
Bye,

Hi,

If you do the redirects, I recommend to always do two redirects:

* one for the WMS
* one for the HTML/JSS/CSS files

Here is what I use (modified to hide my paths):

----------------

#Rewrite Rules for QGIS webclient
# Map /wms to qgis_mapserv.fcgi
RewriteEngine On
RewriteLog /var/log/apache2/webgis_rewrite.log
RewriteLogLevel 0
 #handle WMS requests to QGIS server
RewriteRule ^/wms/(.+)$
/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/www/projects/$1.qgs [QSA,PT,L]
# Map /maps to /qgis-web-client
# First handle the mapping of the starting html file - works for 1 to 7
levels
RewriteRule ^/maps/([^/.]+/{0,1}){1,7}$
/qgis-web-client/qgiswebclient.html [PT,L]

Hope this helps?

Andreas

AFAICT that doesn't mention a primary key.  QGIS might resort to using the
ROWID as primary key (check the medadata tab in vector layer properties), which
is mapped to a integer using a QHash, which is quite expensive.

BTW you can also use Oracle Express Edition to test the provider[1] - no need
for tunnels...

Hi !

So here's a pull request about that :
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/443

This contains only the UUID part, so there's no API change (and no
modification on the QgsComposerItem::id() vs QgsComposerMap::id() problem).

Regards,

Olivier

Ok, now I have one rule for wms

RewriteRule ^wms/([^/]+)$
> /cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/path-to-projects/$1.qgs [QSA,PT,L]

(it works, you can see it in action here
http://vega.faunalia.it/wms/candela?REQUEST=GetCapabilities)

one to have a short url with the project name

RewriteRule ^maps/([^./]+)/?$
> /path-to-qgiswc/qgiswebclient.html?map=/path-to-projects/$1.qgs [PT,L]


and one for html/js/css

RewriteRule ^maps/(.*) /path-to-qgiswc/$1 [PT]


running the webapp with an example project I get an error about some
not-well-specified missing parameters (i think the only one is missing is
the project full path)
you can try here:

http://vega.faunalia.it/maps/candela


Do you think my rewrite engine configuration is right or not?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] non integer ID and python
Message-ID: <512DA765.3070805@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a small problem in my quickfinder plugin (finds a feature by its id).

For postgis layers, I have no problem to find a feature using its id. 
But, I can't achieve this with shapefiles for example.

I understand this as the IDs of shapefiles are store in strings.

Apparently, in the SIP of QgsFeature, QgsFeatureId is defined as a qint64.
Also, in the SIP of QgsFeatureRequest, the setFilterFid method takes 
qint64 as argument.

So my question, is there a way to look for a feature by its ID in python 
if it's not an int???

And if not, do you consider it easily changeable??? How?

Thanks a lot!

Denis

I don't know that plugin.  What does it actually do?

Shapefiles don't have a attribute for the the id.   The feature id is simply
the index of the feature in the file.  In QgsExpressions you can use "$id" to
reference the id (also works for postgis) - if that's what's you're after.

Otherwise feeture ids are always integers -  so you can use QgsFeature::id() to
get the id of a feature and use QgsFeatureRequest::setFilterFid() to retrieve a
feature by id.

Message-ID: <512DC782.5030206@carto.net>

Hi,

I used the new print composer UI a bit more and came across a problem,
esp. on Ubuntu:

The "Position and Size" section in the item properties: first there are
the line inputs for x,y,width,height and to the right there is the
choice of the reference points. However, the line inputs of
x,y,width,height are way too wide (they could be a quarter or third of
the size) and one has to scroll to the right to see the choice of the
reference point.

See http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/print_composer_ui_problem.pdf to
see the problem.

Do you think that his problem can be fixed?

Thank you a lot for your efforts!

Andreas

Hi Martin and Richard,
I'm just teaching some plugin stuff and I remembered that somewhere in 
the dev list there was a super nice email by Marting explaining 
everythin, it took me about 10-15min to find it by skimming the archives.

Would it be possible for either of you to temporarly put the link to it 
[0] in the cookbook (1.8) mentioning that if working with master that is 
the way to go? I think I'm not the only one developing for master.

I'd do it myself, but I never edited the cookbook, how to do it?

ciao

I see that QgsVectorColorBrewerColorRampV2 is missing from SIP bindings. Is

Message-ID: <512DD959.5050106@carto.net>

Hi all,

We are looking for a replacement for the current map tips in QGIS web
client. The ExtJS 3.x tooltips are sort of buggy and limited, the
OpenLayers popups are not too great either.

Do you know any flexible (and lightweight) JS or CSS based tooltip
libraries that you would recommend?

Necessary features:

* follows mouse when not clicked
* dynamic content
* show/hide
* click fixes tooltip at a given position - allows user to interactively
use tooltip content and click - should disable moving tooltips when open
* different styling - nice defaults

If you have good examples, example code, experiences or recommendations
regarding these maptips/tooltips - please let us know.

Alternatives I found are:

* ExtJS tooltips - currently used
* OpenLayers tooltips - Bernhard Str?bl is currently testing them
* QTIP2: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/
* Opentip: http://www.opentip.org/
* Tipped: http://projects.nickstakenburg.com/tipped

Can you recommend any of the above?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi,

this is just a clarification not recommendation.
How is with jQuery and Ext mixing or that is unimportant? Some of the 
alternatives are jQuery plugins or in relation with jQuery.

Hi,

ExtJS is our main framework. As the ExtJS 3x tooltips do not meet our
demands we are looking for an alternative.

I believe it should be possible to mix ExtJS and jquery - from what I
learned on Google.

"Tipped" seems to be commercial (licensed per domain) - so we cannot use
that.

Hi Andreas,

I think, you can do what you want to do with OpenLayers Popup, just hack 
it ;-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Issue with creating new feature
Message-ID: <20130227150636.9c64f8ae221f985ddd5357f9@gmail.com>

Hi all,

during plugin update to new vector API I found some strange
behaviour with creating new features in vector layer/file writer.
There is nice description about how to retrieve features and
attributes from existing vector layer, but I can't find any
information about creating new ones.

Here is my test code for Python console:

>>>from PyQt4.QtCore import *
>>>fields = QgsFields()
>>>fields.append(QgsField("id", QVariant.Int, "", 20))
>>>fields.append(QgsField("value", QVariant.String, "", 255))
>>>fields.append(QgsField("area", QVariant.Double, "", 20, 6))
>>>fields.append(QgsField("perim", QVariant.Double, "", 20, 6))
>>>w = QgsVectorFileWriter("/home/alex/test.shp", "utf-8", fields, >>>QGis.WKBPolygon, None)
>>>f = QgsFeature()
>>>f.setAttribute("id", QVariant(0))
False
>>>f.setAttribute(0, QVariant(0))
False

It is impossible to add attribute by its name or index. In API docs
I found method setFields() that used to "assign a field map with
the feature to allow attribute access by attribute name". But when
I assign field map to feature

>>>f.setFields(fields)

and try to add attribute again by name or id I get crash
(stacktrace attached).

It is possible to set all attributes at once using

>>>f.setAttributes([QVariant(0), QVariant("text"), QVariant(2.3), QVariant(100.456)])

Is this correct or maybe I miss something?

Thanks

Alex,

You can also set the field using this syntax:

f = QgsFeature()
f['id'] = 0
f[0] = 0

That has worked for me in the past unless something has changed since I
tested it last.

I've solved with my own implementation. A compact ColorPalette custom class
was enough to reproduce the logic behind
the QgsVectorColorBrewerColorRampV2 and the categories calculation.

This is a known issue on all platforms [0]. Essentially, the forms widths
need to be reduced for some of the item property panels, and a reasonable
default width needs set.

I'll be working on it today after I finish an issue with slow composer
duplication. If you see anything else that's a problem with the new
composer GUI, please report it and I'll try to make sure it is addressed.

I think my Distribution Map Generator plugin (
https://github.com/rudivs/DistroMap) is at a stage where it can be added to
the plugin registry for those who would find it useful. I tried doing so
via http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/add/, but it gave the following error:

========
Error 500: internal application error.

An email message with all error details has been sent to our staff that
will fix the issue ASAP.
========

I'm not sure if I'm adding it in the wrong place, or if I should try again
later? I set up the framework using Plugin Builder, so is the included
'plugin_upload.py' script the recommended way to share the plugin?

Thanks,
Rudi

Hi,

the QGIS-documentation repository should be ok again. Unfortunately we
lost/removed the repo some hours ago. I updated it from a fork I did this
morning again. I hope nothing is lost - but please check.

If you are a translation maintainer, please create a new fork and organize
with your translators, that they update/fork their repo again as well.
We are sorry for the inconvenience and please ask on the community-team
list, if there are any problems or questions.

Regards

Message-ID: <SNT002-W135CD293A9C08388EBA2CAEA0FE0@phx.gbl>

Hello,


I am building a python plugin for QGIS 1.8 and am trying to manipulate the map composers.

The goal is to load a template, customise a few elements, and then leave the composer window up for the user to modify / print / etc.

I know that current composers can be listed by calling qgis.utils.iface.activeComposers().

However I have been unable to create or destroy composer windows without resorting to spoofing user input to the composer manager dialog!

Is there a technique by which I can add/remove composers programmatically?

Thanks,
Kelly Thomas

Hi Kelly,

I am doing something similar for my company but I am developing it for 
the next release, because master has QgsComposition::loadFromTemplate 
method, which 1.8 has not.

However to get a new printComposer you can use
self.iface.actionPrintComposer().trigger()
which adds a new composer to the project's list of composers. But AFAIK 
you can not load a template into it with 1.8

Call for OSGeo projects and mentors for Google Summer of Code 2013


Hello all!

like past years, OSGeo is applying to become a mentoring organisation
during Google Summer of Code 2013 [0,1].

As part of the application process, I welcome developers from every
OSGeo project to update the relevant Ideas pages (see past years' Ideas
pages for guidance [2]). I welcome every project to choose a
representative, in order to make communication more effective.


I am extending the call to OSGeo-Edu mailing list, as many open
geospatial labs would like to spread the news among their students, and
professors can consider to apply as mentors.


The deadline for OSGeo application is end of March [3]. Thanks in
advance for your contribution!


== For developers and potential Mentors ==

Is there a feature that your pet project would benefit from, and can be
developed by a student in roughly three months under your supervision?
It's time to describe it in the Ideas page of your project, write about
it in the usual communication channels (mailing lists, forums) and
unusual (university pinboards!) and look for the student who will

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Print composer feature request
Message-ID: <1362068226217-5037542.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi All, 
before creating a ticket, I would like to discuss a small new feature with
you. 

Setting a map extent to current MapCanvas extent is not quite simple for
users that want to open a map composer, rezoom it and print. The question is
frequently asked to me. 
 User has to select the map with the select tool first, then find the item
properties tab, then scroll to find the right button in the extent
collapsible group. 

I'm wondering how we could have some kind of shortcut to 'Set to map canvas
extent' somewhere. 
Could we imagine button in the toolbar next to select and navigate tool,
greyed out if no map object is selected? Any objection to that?

I was also thinking of starting to enable right clic contextual menu on
objects, but that would need to some more options.

 +1 for such a shortcut in the toolbar (with a drop-down menu if there 
 are several maps?) or with a right-click context menu.

 I also find the current way of setting the extent quite complicated.

In master branch, and in the last week, the actionPrintComposer() (i.e.
QgisApp::createNewComposer) action will now present the user with a dialog
to help choose a unique composer title, before the composer is created.
Since iface.actionPrintComposer().trigger() still appears to be the best
means of programmatically creating a new composer, this presents an issue.

There are a couple of possible solutions:

* Expose Qgis::createNewComposer in iface (which returns pointer to new
composer). Maybe adding duplicateComposer, deleteComposer and
deletePrintComposers, as well. Makes the most sense to me. New PyQGIS code
would be different from 1.8.

* Add a preference in Options for turning it on/off (e.g. [x] Prompt for
composer name), and maybe simple get/set methods to QgisApp and iface. New
PyQGIS code would require a couple of lines of additional code if the
prompt was not to be shown.

* Use a different action in the GUI than actionPrintComposer(). Might lead
to some confusion, having semi-redundant actions. New PyQGIS code remains
identical to 1.8.


But AFAIK you can not load a template into it with 1.8

I think this is possible. QgsComposition has readXML and addItemsFromXML
exposed in 1.8 [0]. If you look at loadFromTemplate [1], the initial
routines are for clearing a composition's existing items (btw: I think that
is bad. IMO loading from a template should always be in a fresh composer).
Not a concern if you are starting with a fresh composer anyway. After that,
there is substitution replacement (not sure if relevant to 1.8), reading of
the XML doc, then adding the items, all of which should be doable in
Python, unless I am mistaken.

hmm, my master dates from Febr. 21, have to update...
Is this a needed feature? I mean any text processing software creates 
"document1" or "unknown1" if you hit the new document button

the actionPrintComposer().trigger() thing is not so straightforward

Not neccessarily, I sometimes happen to work on a composer (created from 
template) but I somehow screw things up and then it is nice to restart 
again without leaving the composer. This is the behavior of QGIS, so 
IMHO it is ok if loadFromTemplate behaves in the same manner.

I did not fiddle with those 1.8 methods, but thinking about it it should 
even be possible to do substitution using PyQt methods, i.e.
1) read file
2) do substitutions
3) create the XMLDoc
4) load into composer

I will check and report back

IMO, yes. With the text processing software you note, it creates the
"document 1" with the understanding that the user will eventually have to
save the file, thereby prompting the user to change the default name.

With composers there is no prompted saving; they are automatically saved
into the project with the default name. This causes the user to have to
find a means of changing the name later, e.g. in the Composer Manager, and
in the meantime they have no hint at what content "Composer #n" contains.
With a prompt, the user can define the name up front, using existing names
to build on (from editable combobox) and use the Manager later, only if
needed.

Again, we can add a preference in Options for turning it on/off (with a
default of on), but that would have to be checked and turned off
programmatically in scripts if there is no other means of generating a
blank composer.

Maybe a parameter option to the function, or a new function, and a new
action in the menu, e.g. New from Template, to accompany Load Template? I
think 'load' should always mean 'replace existing'. I envision a user
accidentally clearing all their work in the current composer, when they
thought they were getting a fresh composer based upon the template.

I don't think "template load replaces existing" is the behavior of QGIS at
the QMainWindow level, maybe with styles, etc. For example, when loading a
project template, the menu action is New Project from Template (there is no
load option). I think we need the distinction, and option, between new and
load with templates, especially when they are auto-saved, or users may lose
work.

Larry

Hi all

so finally I have pushed my initial work on OpenStreetMap integration
to master... d'oh I have missed The Open Data Day (Feb 23) by few
days! The idea is to completely replace the current OpenStreetMap
provider and plugin. As announced in the list before, the new OSM
support is read-only and right now I have no plans to add editing
functionality. Editing would mean a _lot_ of work - map tools,
tracking of changes, conflict resolution - and there are already great
programs for editing OSM data.

If you would like to test the new stuff, go to menu Vector >
OpenStreetMap. No need to enable any plugins. The workflow should be:
0. get OSM XML file (from web or download in GUI)
1. import XML file to a SQLite topology database (once)
2. export SpatiaLite layers from topology with a fixed set of tags - attributes

Integrated download uses Overpass API, so you should be able to
download data from any extent size. The download server in GUI is
currently fixed to overpass-api.de. When using download, make sure to
set high timeout (Options > Network > Timeout for network requests) -
currently there's a problem with QGIS network manager - it will time
out after the fixed time even if the data is being continuously
received.

The work is by no means complete, there are various pieces missing,
though it should be already usable. Some features I would like to add:
- advanced download queries (e.g. filtering by tags)
- filtering on export (e.g. export only railroads, only restaurants)
- python bindings
- support for relations
- identification GUI (e.g. see all tags, even those not exported)

There is a low-level API in qgis analysis library which should allow
3rd party tools/plugins do some work with OSM data (currently
QgsOSMDownload, QgsOSMXmlImport and QgsOSMDatabase classes).

Please let me know what do you think about it or if you encounter any bugs.

I will be removing the OSM provider+plugin very soon. This is another
piece from the master plan for removal of old symbology (OSM provider
implements a renderer based on old symbology).

Instead of a just a link it would be better to have the explanation
directly in the cookbook. For 2.x release we should start another
branch of the cookbook so that people will not get confused by many
"before 2.0" and "after 2.0" sections.

I should have done that already, but I am somehow late with these
updates of documentation :-/
(unfortunately I'm faster typing in c++ than in English)
At some point I will eventually update the cookbook, but now I am
mostly focused on code updates for 2.0. Anyway I would highly welcome
any activity by others to bring the cookbook up to date.

> I'd do it myself, but I never edited the cookbook, how to do it?

The cookbook is now located in the QGIS-Documentation repository:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/tree/master/source/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook
It is in RST format for sphinx, like the rest of the documentation.

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7w150aN6p2QJwGvWA9a6-qpwa6+ei4tfcEgir5ioj3BSQ@mail.gmail.com>

hi all

I am trying to make it easier to generate unit tests for SEXTANTE
algorithms, so this task can even be outsourced to non-programmers.
The idea is that, having an example dataset, an user should be able to
run an algorithm and then check if the results are as expected. If so,
SEXTANTE would generate the corresponding code for a test checking
exactly that, and we could add that to a test suite.

I would like to know if  someone knows about any good and small
dataset that is available to be used for that, to avoid having to
create it. It should be some synthetic dataset dat covers all test
cases that might appear.

Thanks in advance

Victor

Wow, great! 

Unfortunately seems it doesn't work with Wheezy's Spatialite 3.0.0. Tomorrow 
I'll try to compile a newer version and test it.

Anyway, it would be nice to have it in Debian working out of the box. Maybe 
updating the very outdated internal Spatialite (what is its current status and 
purposes?) would solve the problem?

I have 3.1.0-rc2 on my computer - what's the problem in your installation?

I would like to have it working with any reasonable SpatiaLite version
- with more details on the error I will try to fix it.

First, InitSpatialMetadata() doesn't accept any parameters (AFAIK before 
version 3.0.2). After removing the crs string from there the conversion went 
with no errors, but the created db has no geometry columns. 
Here are the osm & db files: http://tmp.borysjurgiel.pl/testosm.tar.gz

Awesome to see this updated! Thank you, Martin.

Unfortunately, on Mac with Kyngchaos supporting frameworks, I get the
following compile error:

Quantum-GIS/src/analysis/openstreetmap/qgsosmimport.cpp:18:10: fatal error:
'spatialite.h' file not found
#include <spatialite.h>
^

Funny thing is, spatialite.h is definitely in the specified include
directory. The CMake options I'm using are:

WITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE=FALSE
SPATIALITE_INCLUDE_DIR=/Library/Frameworks/SQLite3.framework/Headers
SPATIALITE_LIBRARY=/Library/Frameworks/SQLite3.framework

So, not sure what's up. Will investigate more...

Regards,

Larry

Ok, just had to add the following to
Quantum-GIS/src/analysis/CMakeLists.txt:

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(
  ...
  ${SPATIALITE_INCLUDE_DIR}
)

Evidently needed for external spatialite libs, or just on Mac? Should I
commit the change?

Once compiled and launched I get the following error when trying to
download data [0], and again if I try to manual enter the extent [1]. The
layer is in EPSG:26913 - NAD83 / UTM zone 13N for a fairly small area (15
ha).

I would say do it.  Not specific to OS X, but missing include dirs often show up here.

Ok, I've added these (excepting deletePrintComposers) to iface [0]. So you
can now do the following:

cv = iface.createNewComposer('test')
cv2 = iface.duplicateComposer(cv, 'test2')

for c in iface.activeComposers():
  iface.deleteComposer(c)

Like the existing iface.activeComposers() they work via QgsComposerView,
not QgsComposer directly. Not sure why, but QgsComposer is unavailable in
the API/bindings (I figure for a good reason, e.g. like QgisApp). Please
test, if you have the time.

I've added New from Template to the Composer menu [1]. I think the
distinction between the actions is very clear now. Btw, Composer Manager
also only adds templates to new composers, but with no clear indication on
where those templates are located. They are in
QgsApplication::pkgDataPath()/composer_templates/ (inside bundled app on
Mac) instead of under say ~/.qgis/composer_templates/. I think that needs
adjusted.

Martin,

Nice, glad the OSM download/import support is being worked on.

I've just tried to import two OSM files: one which I had saved through
JOSM, and the other one downloaded just now via your Download OSM Data
dialogue. With both files, QGIS fails to import data with this error:

Failed to import OSM data:

Error executing SQL command:

wrong number of arguments to function InitSpatialMetadata()

SQL:

SELECT InitSpatialMetadata('WGS84')


Running on a osgeo4win master build (revision 3e8be6c).


Best,


Mathieu

Ah, right, I have forgotten to implement transformation from
layer/canvas CRS to WGS84. Will fix soon.

Hi Victor,

there is a QGIS sample dataset [0], that contains data (both vector
and raster) in different formats. There are shapefile, kml, csv and
even small grass location. Maybe it makes sence to extent this
datased by adding necessary files?

Also there are some test data in QGIS sources [1], that used by QGIS
unit test. You can find them under tests/testdata directory in your
sources.

And finally there is a demo dataset called Geosample [2]. This
datased was created by GIS-Lab community and currently a bit
outdated (uses old symbology, project files have old version). In
case if you decide to use some data from it I'm available to help
with reviewing and updating it to latest master.

Hope this helps

Do you have any tip?

Hi all.
I would be in favour of having just one comprehensive sample dataset, used for all,
including tests.
I can also help if necessary.
All the best.

I was not meaning it is the general behaviour of QGIS but its behaviour 
in the composer window. So my point was that the api function should 
behave as the button with the same name.

Your DB file looks good: it has all the _topological_ tables fully
populated. Now you just need to export data you need (with tags you
need) to SpatiaLite tables.

That's presumably the problem Borys had - should be fixed in master now.

The first part looks like sqlite library should be added to link
libraries for analysis. Could you please try adding this to
src/analysis/CMakeLists.txt

IF(NOT WITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE)
  TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(qgis_analysis ${SQLITE_LIBRARY})
ENDIF(NOT WITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE)

And see if that helps?

Hm... this seems to be unrelated. Was it compiling for you before

Nope. Still have the same ouptut.
(I added the lines in src/analysis/CMakeLists.txt, and ran make clean, 
ccmake .. and make)

Great News, this will make things much neater.

At the moment I'm using the current location to my advantage.
Loading templates from pkgDataPath allows template distribution on a per-machine rather than a per-user basis.
It might be desirable to support both options much like the current situation with two locations for python plugins.


I'm thinking it would be nice to have the composer titles exposed directly.
Currently I believe python code would only have indirect access like this: 
iface.activeComposers()[0].composerWindow().windowTitle()
