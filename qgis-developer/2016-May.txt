Hi Piotjr,

While I have seen the approval message, indeed it is not visible for
normal users.

When I log in as 'approver' I can find it:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/DiviPlugin/

you have two version. I installed one version to check and see that you
need a login to use it. Maybe Paolo (in cc, who does most/all of the
approval work) asked for a login, so he was able to check more what this
plugin is doing?

Is there also some 'public' login? To some public service(s)?

I leave this to Paolo, but just ask again if there is no news within a
couple of days.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Piotr,

This plugin had no public version. Now approved.
Please note the ticket I opened.
All the best.

I think you need to delete "sp_layer" before calling exitQgis(). The
call to exitQgis() will invalidate the whole QGIS environment, so
later when sp_layer is auto-deleted by Python at the end of the
script, that will cause segfault. So simply try to add "del sp_layer"
line before exitQgis()

Cheers
Martin

Deleting the layer works around the crash. I feel somewhat silly for
not trying such a simple solution :). Instead I tried removing the
layer from the map registry before closing, but it still segfaulted.
Thanks for the help!

Though it works without crashing now, the behavior for spatialite is
still different from other data sources. If I connect to a postgis
layer, check that it is valid and then call exitQgis(), it doesn't
crash.

Message-ID: <2b045726b9db329-0000f.Richmail.00044436101406400867@139.com>



I can't find the INSTALL guide on how to compile QGIS from source for Centos platform with Qt4 dependencies for development. If I just do this on Centos 6 platform according to the guide for Fedora Linux, such as: 





dnf install qt5-qtwebkit-devel qt5-qtlocation-devel qt5-qttools-static qt5-qtscript-devel qca-qt5-devel python3-qt5-devel python3-qscintilla-qt5-devel  qscintilla-qt5-devel python3-qscintilla-devel python3-qscintilla-qt5 clang flex bison geos-devel gdal-devel sqlite-devel libspatialite-devel qt5-qtsvg-devel qt5-qtxmlpatterns-devel spatialindex-devel expat-devel proj-devel qwt-devel gsl-devel postgresql-devel.




Then what are the substitutes for these packages ' qt5-qtwebkit-devel qt5-qtlocation-devel qt5-qttools-static qt5-qtscript-devel qca-qt5-devel python3-qt5-devel python3-qscintilla-qt5-devel qscintilla-qt5-devel python3-qscintilla-devel python3-qscintilla-qt5 qt5-qtsvg-devel qt5-qtxmlpatterns-devel' with Qt4 dependencies? For example, I can't just relplace qt5-qtsvg-devel by qt4-qtsvg-devel because there does not exist qt4-qtsvg-devel.

Hi,

Richard, thanks for your answer!
Afaics, I have only one python installed, through osgeo4w. I tried setting
the pythonhome as "C:\[PythonDir]\DLLs" and then as "C:\[PythonDir]"
without success.
I then tried docker but to be honest I find it not that straightforward (at
least on Windows) and it seems that it requires more knowledge on
virtualisation matters (what i lack). So I gave up!
I then come back to paver set osgeo4w directory as path environment
variable for the user and it works like a charm! i can build docs and
website ... don't know which changes really work but now it works (won't
check further :) )

I'd like to fix some issues in docs pdf version but when i generate doc, I
can't find a local pdf. The one i get is linked to the official online one.
Any idea how I can build a pdf doc locally? Trying _paver pdf_ complains
about missing gdbm and a pip install gdbm states:
*could not find a version that satisfied the requirement gdbm (version: )
No matching distribution found for gdbm*
and internet is no more prolific

Thanks for any other help..
Harrissou

Hi H,

I do not think you will be able to create pdf's on Windows with Paver.
Never really tried, but for pdf generation (also on Linux) you need A
LOT of dependencies: Latex stuff, special fonts etc etc

IF you want to create pdf's I think you either have to try the docker
way (because then the images you download from QGIS will contain ALL you
need), or you to find a Debian machine to work on...

Sorry,

Richard

HI William,
I removed the newly created __init__.py which was created by the command 'sudo
touch /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/
Extras/lib/python/mpl_toolkits/__init__.py'.
Then ran your matplotlib package install and __init__.py was not created.

What's your sys.path from within a QGIS python terminal (with my matplotlib
> installed)?

This is all on OS X 10.11.4 - not sure what 'matplotlib-override' is about
- might anaconda have messed with things?
Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] python/ogr problems reading large gml file
Message-ID: <57275865.2010307@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

(below all via python/plugin on Debian/Linux):

Via a WFS I retrieve 10000 features as GML as data.gml
To be able to read (attr+geometry) the GML I copy a data.gfs next to it.

Now all seems ok, untill the number of features returned is > 1500.
Strange errors like:

ogrinfo -ro data.gml reports a (None) geometry
BUT if I 'touch' the data.gfs ogrinfo, then suddenly all is ok
Seems like ogrinfo does not like the copied gfs at first?
Permissions are ok. A 'touch /tmp/foo/data.gfs' is enough.

Off course the same holds for QGIS, if I open the retrieved and saved
gml file as a gml-vectorlayer, a 1000 feature containing one is probably
ok, but <1500 often fails and the 10000 one ALWAYS fails (untill I
'touch' the gfs file).
IF something goes wrong: there is no exception, and 'layer.isValid()'
returns true, but geometry/attributes are None at such moment.

I'm pretty carefull with closing/opening the files (I think), but it
smells like either files that are still open, OR python loosing it's
handles or so?

Anybody some idea on what I am doing wrong?
Sorry, cannot sent you a wfs-url it's an internal service here.

Thansk for any pointers

Richard Duivenvoorde

The OGR GML driver only uses the .gfs file if its modification time is equal or 
greater than the the one of the .gml file (to avoid using an outdated .gfs 
file). If you run ogrinfo with --debug on, you'll see a message about that. 
Should probably be a more verbose warning.

matplotlib-override is from my package.  I do that to make it simpler to get matplotlib and its dependencies (ie the problematic mpl_toolkits) to load before the system matplotlib.  

The installer does not do anything to the system matplotlib.  The override mpl_toolkits has the needed __init__.py.

Thanks Even!

so
 os.utime(os.path.join('/tmp/foo/data.gfs'), None)
fixed all my strange problems :-)

apparently it was a some race-problem of the closing time of the gml
file on disk and the modification time of the gfs: smaller files just
worked etc etc..

anyway: thanks!
Maybe a warning about ignoring the 'old' gfs would be nice...

I tried:
$ ogrinfo --debug data1.gml
but that did not show me more info

Then I did:
$ ogrinfo --debug
ERROR 1: --debug option given without debug level.

Should I be able to use --debug from cli anyway?

Regards,

Richard

The syntax is "--debug on" to enable all debug messages. And "--debug 
component_name" to enable only the ones in component_name

Subject: [Qgis-developer] timemanager plugin + show feature count
Message-ID: <5727675C.6020203@duif.net>


When using Timemanager plugin on a layer with the right time settings,
it nicely updates the 'feature count' in the layer manager (as a
'filtered' layer).

But when stepping using the time slider I noted that the feature count
is only updated when I hover out of the timemanager panel, or into the
layerlist panel...

Should I consider this an issue and create an issue for it.
And if so, is this to be considered a plugin or a qgis issue?

Regards,

Richard

That's a good question. You can certainly create a ticket on the plugin's
tracker. I've no idea how to fix the issue yet though.

Hello Richard,
Yes feel free to add this to the issues. I do call
iface.mapCanvas().refresh()
and
layer.triggerRepaint()

every time the time is refreshed, so if this doesn't refresh the feature
count, then that means refreshing the feature count needs another QGIS API
call. If anybody knows this off the top of their heads, please let me know.

Bests,
Karolina

Hi Karolina,

What do you change except for this? setSubsetString?

I guess we could expect this to call layer.triggerRepaint() (no need for
mapCanvas.Refresh() AFAIK) and the update for the feature cout
automatically. It's probably a simple matter of connecting some slots.
So it could be considered an upstream issue.

Thanks. So apparently I have a problem:

Hmm. While your browser seems to support WebGL, it is disabled or
unavailable. If possible, please ensure that you are running the latest
drivers for your video card.

Maybe I'm missing a package.
Sorry for the noise.
All the best.

I just found another issue related to the feature count (in combination
with expressions): https://hub.qgis.org/issues/14758

Maybe this feature needs some more love ...

Best wishes,

Hi everybody,

is there any changelog for the bug fixes from 2.14.1 to 2.14.2 ?
I only find the visual changelog for 2.14 and in the bug tracking system I can only choose 2.14 too.

Thanks Christian

I've just submitted a pull request so that RPC are used to automagically warp 
the imagery :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3056

You can workaround this by doing :
gdalwarp your.nitf your.nitf.vrt -of VRT
and opening your.nitf.vrt

You can also create a real GeoTIFF for a more smoother experience after the 
initial conversion:
gdalwarp your.nitf your.nitf.tif

Subject: [Qgis-developer] pyqgis: parallel QThreads to services possible?
Message-ID: <57290BC1.80203@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

my plugin needs to fire as quick as possible:
- 24 (hourly) WPS requests to service A, resulting in a dir with shp/zips
- >3 (slow) paging WFS requests (30000 features) to service B resulting
in 3 gml files
If all this is finished, show all the results in QGIS

mostly using this page:

https://snorfalorpagus.net/blog/2013/12/07/multithreading-in-qgis-python-plugins/

I created 'workers' for the services, and two different QThreads to be
able to move the workers to.

BUT when testing/running: I do not see 2 parallel service processes: I
see first all 24 WPS request, and then the 3 slow WFS request (or the
other way around if I change order of starting the threads...

Anybody a clue or idea IF what I'm trying to achieve should be possible
in this way? Or should I use other PyQT-machinery for this?
Note that the gui-update is not even my biggest challence, I just want
these two "slow" processes to run in parallel.

Regards & TIA,

Richard

It's not an answer to your current predicament, but

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3004

is designed to handle cases like this. I'd very much value it if you could
read over the comments on the PR and confirm that the PR design would meet
your needs (or not!)

Hi Nyall,

had not seen this before, nice ( movies ;-) ) and good ideas

yes, I think this could absolutely work for my problem, though for
general use we should
- document, document, blog, blog, write, document it clearly
- make the api so clear/clean that even I can use it

I think in the comments about processing it is already mentioned, but
the 'chaining' of tasks would be possible/easy.

Like in my case:
- when task-1 (WPS) is finished start task-3
- task-3 (merge all the shp files and do some magic with attr)
- task-2 (WFS) is finished start task-4
- task-4 do some magic with the gml
- if all those are done: show the results...

Which off course looks a lot like processing modeller...

Anyway: nice work and also a good example of discussion/communication
between devs. Thanks all!

Regards,

Richard

I'm targeting this to after 2.16 so there should be plenty of time to make
the design rock solid :)

That's already implemented. You can set task "dependancies", and the
manager will magically handle the rest. This includes things like auto
cancelling any remaining tasks when one of their dependancies fails (or is
cancelled).

It will basically run as many tasks as possible (given available threads),
and whenever a task finishes it looks through the list for any tasks which
were waiting on that task and fires them up ASAP.

Hmm maybe your problem is with the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in
Python. Even though Python supports multi-threading, it does not allow
multiple threads to execute Python code at the same time. In various
cases this is not a problem really. For example, thread #1 asks
operating system to do some I/O that may take some time, so Python
releases GIL from thread #1, and thread #2 can be resumed and acquire
GIL to run Python code, while thread #1 is waiting for the OS.

Now the question is how things really work in your code. If you use
some libraries for WFS/WPS access, they should probably handle GIL
correctly... it is a bit difficult to tell the exact reason without
seeing the code.

If things start to look complicated with threads, maybe you could try
python's 'multiprocessing' module instead:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html

Message-ID: <38497AD9CA059C42AA3451EFEFF0378E012F578735@P2KITMBX04WC02.unicph.domain>

Hi,

I have lately had trouble with Processing>Clip and the plugin Clip Multiple Layer
It give an error “Input layer has unsupported geometry type -2147483645” – which refer to a z-value. My data doesn´t initially have any z-value.

But after a long research on the process, I have realized that I have savede my dataset using “Save As” to a SHP file there is Geometry>Geometry Type ‘Automatic’ and then (greyed out) ‘Include z-dimension’
I has never been aware of this function – which apparently gives problems using the above functions.

Why is the Include z-dimmension On as default ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS3 features and wishes?
Message-ID: <5729A636.7000909@duif.net>

Hi,

Are we somewhere collecting ideas for QGIS3 yet?
I remember seeing such a page somewhere but cannot find it.

Personally I was for example hitting some issues with pyqgis:
- creating a VectorLayer from a ogr-file by a new user will popup a crs
dialog (see [0] for a workaround).
Nicer would be to be able to add the crs to the constructor, either as
param or as query-param in the uri (which currently does not seem to
work either).
- I always disliked the fact that the provider keys are sometimes
lowercase ('ogr') and some are uppercase ('WFS').

I would like to add this to some list, but can off course also create an
issue for it with 'milestone 3.0'...
Not sure if we can hold the horses though if we start a wiki page ;-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

on github there is a repository qgis3.0_api which is only there for its
issue tracker.

Concerning your ideas, I think are not necessarily tied to QGIS 3, they
are easy to implement in a backwards-compatible manner, so feel free to
make a pull request for 2.16 already.

There is a github repo I think now that tracks stuff as issues. Those are
bugs that could be fixes in 2.16 though

Ah, yes that was the one, thanks:

I was thinking these were api changes, as maybe we could have a second
thought about for example the use of the uri in the constructors etc...

Hi,

I have just published a post with the state of Python 3 and Qt 5 migration.
http://www.opengis.ch/2016/05/04/qgis-qt5-and-python3-migration-current-state/

In general I am very happy with what we have achieved so far.

There is one problem that I think needs broader discussion which is an
issue about the handling of NULL values in PyQt5. With the equivalent to
the SIP API V2 we don't have PyQtNullVariant up to PyQt 5.6. This
basically means, no NULL for python plugins. And I consider this a blocker.

We could

 * Switch to another API (sip.enableautoconversion(false), similar to
SIP API V1). Resulting in countless lines of code in plugins requiring
to be updated.
 * Bump the minimum Qt version to 5.7 (and hope that PyQtNullVariant
will be fixed there, chances are good, see
https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2016-April/037336.html).

I tend towards Qt >= 5.7 - on Windows and Mac we control the
dependencies, so that should be ok anyway, on Linux we can say "if you
want a recent QGIS, get a recent distro". And by the time we actually
ship QGIS with a Qt5 dependency there should be a number of distros with
Qt 5.7.

Any opinion on this?

This rules out backports for Debian stable, so I'm not in favour of this 
option.

The next Debian stable release may support Qt 5.7, but packaging is not 
on the horizon yet. Qt 5.5.1 is currently in testing/unstable (and 
Ubuntu xenial) with 5.6 in experimental.

I'd like to keep maintaining backports for the most recent LTR because 
that's in the interest of our users, if dependency requirements make 
that impossible it's unfortunate but not the end of the world.

Kind Regards,

Bas

I don't see any.
QVariant is extensively used in the API but python (and the conversion
tool) lacks this type knowledge and with this approach .value() (or
.toInt() / toString() etc? not sure) would need to be called on every
one of them.

Just to be carefull: what's an easy 'automation' is for a dev is a big
hurdle for some plugin authors... And we have a lot authors already...

But authors have to update their plugins anyway isn't it? So how
countless is countless?

And we knew that we would break stuff anyway....

I'm in favour with 'looking into the future', but let us now walk too
much in front of the distro's. Packaging Qt will be the next step, and I
understand from Debian packagers it is a lot of work to do....

But how 'new' is 5.7?

Debian Jessie: 5.3.2
Debian Stretch: 5.5.1
Experimental has 5.6...
(we still need the building structure working)

Ubuntu?
Fedora?
Others?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Strange. Why wouldn't they just convert to None. 0 is a valid value.

Every feature attribute which is accessed, every QSetting which is
handled...
Countless!

I think the question is, do we risk many plugins not being updated (like
you wrote above it can be hard for some plugin devs). Or leave some
users behind with QGIS 2.latest for some time.

Instead we could also ship them with their dependencies via an
infrastructure such as

 * http://linuxbrew.sh/
 * https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/build-apps/
 * https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/SandboxedApps

Feel free to join the discussion at the pyqt mailing list. I'm happy to
get more opinions there.

Sidenote: I prefer the PyQtNullVariant over None because this leaves
None available for QVariant::Invalid. But I think it's safe to say that
the current situation is broken.

Wouldn't there be the possibility of shipping Qt, QScintilla and QWT in
/opt? I acknowledge that this is not the best solution but it could be a
temporary fix.

It's a PyQt issue, not a Qt issue.

For the upstream QGIS packages this may be an option, for the official 
packages in the Debian archive it is not.

Understandable.

I had a look at past Debian releases, extrapolating the release cycle we
can expect the next release to happen in about a year.

I don't expect a first QGIS release based on Qt5 to happen considerably
earlier. The first LTR based on Qt5 will certainly not happen earlier.

Just to make sure we talk about the same order of delays. (Note: this
timeline has not been officially approved)

Debian will switch to Qt5 with QGIS 2.16, otherwise there will be no 
QGIS in the next stable release.

The Qt4 builds currently still work because the Qt maintainers didn't 
want to break QGIS before Qt5 support is available, but the Qt4WebKit 
removal changes have already been committed and will be included in the 
next upload. The upload may happen sooner than we'd like if important 
bugfixes need to be uploaded in the near future.

The changes affecting QGIS is the next stable release will arrive 
earlier than a year from now. The freeze was planned for 5 November 
2016, but has been moved two months to align with the expected 4.10 
kernel release. [0]

With the full freeze in February 2016, I expect the release to happen in 
Q3 2016, may be even Q4. The Qt4WebKit removal will happen before the 
transition freeze on 5 November 2016.

Based on the QGIS release schedule as it stands now, the plans for QGIS 
in Debian are discussed in the "QGIS 2.14 & Qt5" thread on the 
debian-gis list. [1] That is switching to Qt5 with the 2.16 non-LTR, and 
switch back to the 3.x LTRs for unstable/testing & backports.

The choices for the upstream QGIS packages are not really relevant for 
Debian, it just makes the packaging changes in Debian less relevant to 
forward upstream.

Hi,

Matthias, awesome amount of effort you and Jürgen have done here. Thank you
very much.

I have started in on a complete rewrite of the CMake bundling for Mac
(leveraging BundleUtilities) that can utilize a Homebrew backend of
dependencies and generate a completely bundled app directly from a Homebrew
formula. When would be a good timeframe to start releasing a Mac Qt5/Py3
nightly?

Also, what would be the best nightly configurations for Mac to offer?
Qt4/Py2, of course, but what other combinations make sense, i.e. Qt?/Py?,
for testing? Or, should we focus only on offering two: Qt4/Py2, Qt5/Py3?

More below...

Thanks for the clear and concise summary of this dependency issue. Do you
mean "February 2017" and "Q3 2017" here?

Yes, obviously. Only the transition freeze still happens this year. 
Everything else in 2017.

I don't want to prevent you from doing that, the worst that could happen
is that you will need to set a CMake flag to void the non-existent
warranty. QGIS will happily compile and run with any Qt5 version (for now).

Just be prepared that:

 * Almost every plugin will fail (most of them with import PyQt and
python 3 related errors)
 * Even if they are migrated anything related to NULL values will still
fail because of the issue under discussion
 * This will be the case regardless of the approach to overcome this
problem (Qt 5.7 or sip.enableautoconversion(false))

I'm happy to have Debian users as guinea pigs - but if you want to give
the best UX instead of the latest bleeding edge code with known
problems, you probably better continue shipping the current Qt4 builds
wherever possible.

I can try to see if there's another solution which only requires a sip
update and not a Qt5 update which could possibly increase the number of
possible target platforms.

That is great news Larry.

I would stick to Qt5/Py3 (and Qt4/Py2) to keep the matrix small and
avoid plugins developed against strange combinations. In the case of OSX
a combination of Qt5/PyQt4/Py2 may also make sense because I think there
are Qt4 compatibility issues with OSX which this combination may
overcome while still offering support for the current plugin ecosystem.
But that's just a guess.

What I am really interested in is a Qt5/Python3 OSX build on travis. The
sooner we can have this the better. It could even have an on_success or
deploy step to upload master builds from the test infrastructure.

And I just realized that this combination may also be a possibility for
you, Bas.
Or another approach would be to compile with -DWITH_QT_WEBKIT=OFF to
continue shipping Qt4 based builds. That would leave most plugins usable
but at the expense of limitations in other parts of the application
(most notable HTML based functionality in annotations and composer).
Just for the sake of completeness of the available possibilities.

Yes, that Qt5/PyQt4/Py2 make sense during the migration period (6 to 12
months?).

I think having Qt4/Py2, Qt5/PyQt4/Py2 and Qt5/Py3 nightlies for Mac is not
unreasonable. This will help plugin authors and core testers migrate code,
since all three could be installed on a dev Mac at the same time.

That sounds great, if we can find a way to do that on a nightly basis.
Seems a bit excessive to do per Travis test build, i.e. per every commit
and PR. Well, at least for full bundling, which takes a while and might
clog the Travis queue.

Another option is to do a minimum bundled build (just qgis libs/frameworks,
Python modules and plugins). Then a user would need to have a Homebrew
dependency install to work with the artifacts. That might be the simplest.
It would be equivalent to the QGIS.app inside of the Homebrew qgis-214
prefix install, or ~58 MB compressed. Note, I do something similar at work
already, though via Jenkins builds. Would make it VERY easy/fast to
functionally test PRs on Mac.

It will require the minimum Mac OS to be 10.9 (Travis-supported OS) instead
of the current 10.7, but I was going to bump the nightlies to 10.9 anyhow,
since anything less than that is not supported via 'bottles' upstream by
Homebrew. Also, it's a totally reasonable minimum OS for a nightly.

This seems like a good plan to me:
* New Homebrew-based Mac bundling CMake routines have two bundling outputs:
minimal and full
* Travis Mac build produces a minimally bundled app as an output artifact,
which requires a Homebrew install of deps to use
* Generate fully bundled Qt4/Py2, Qt5/PyQt4/Py2 and Qt5/Py3 nightlies for
local isolated testing of plugins and core

This is close to the current qt5 branch [0] for the Debian package, it
uses Qt5/PyQt5/Python2. But because QGIS server is mostly non-functional
with Qt5 in 2.14 it's still just a testing branch.

The initial switch to Qt5 will be painful for users no matter what,
simply because the full Qt5 support is very late to arrive in QGIS.

I'm not sure if not shipping qgis in stretch is preferable over a Qt5
build which doesn't support most plugins.

Newer LTRs will be provided via backports, so eventually a fully
functional QGIS will be available to stable users.

Kind Regards,

Bas

I would only add the deploy step to master branch (and release
branches?). As long as we don't run into a travis timeout, I don't care.
(And if we do, we might look into getting a ccache setup although it
will be more complicated than what we can do for the linux builds at the
moment)

If we find a way to do that for PRs, it would be a nice enhancement.
A few things need to be sorted out first like file storage and how to
easily provide a link from the PR.

If possible (timeout) I'd go for the big ones for master builds in a

I really like this plan.

Hi,

just noticed a recent strange behaviour of the attribute table in table mode : 
it displays the right number of columns, but their name and content is the one 
of the first attribute. It affects several providers so it seems to be really an 
attribute table issue. I indeed see a number of commits in that area in the 
last couple days.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Call for nominations for voting members of the
	QGIS.org board.
Message-ID: <7533472A-BC0D-49AD-BD81-F8DBF5952C97@qgis.org>

Dear QGIS Community members

As many of you will be aware, in this last year we have been embarking on the process to transition from a loose-knit community organisation to a more formal organisation. This new organisation ‘QGIS.org <http://qgis.org/>’ will be a legal entity and will afford us a greater amount of flexibility in how we manage funds, legal agreements and so forth. You can read the statutes for the QGIS.org <http://qgis.org/> organisation at [0] below.

Under the statutes of the new organisation, there will be one user group voting member put forward for each registered user group (user group registration page is here [1]). For each user group voting member we will have a community voting member elected. In addition there will be one voting member from the OSGEO leadership. It is probably best explained by way of a simple (contrived) example:

1) The Martian user group puts forward Joe Alien to be their QGIS User Group Voting Member.
2) QGIS committers put forward nominations for a matching Community Voting Member from within the community. Community member with the highest number of nominations is elected. Only people with git commit rights to an official QGIS repository or write access to the QGIS translation platform on transifex can put forward nominations. Nominated person can be any person from within the QGIS community who is willing to serve as a voting QGIS community member.
3)  The Moon user group puts forward Janet Luna to be their QGIS User Group Voting Member.
4) QGIS committers again nominate a matching Community Voting Member
5) OSGEO puts forward one person to act as the OSGEO voting member.

Voting members will elect the QGIS Board, Board Chairman and approve budgets and the annual report. Once elected, the board will make day to day decisions on behalf of the project as needed. The OSGEO voting member will also serve to ensure that there are always an odd number of voting members to avoid deadlocks. Voting members will be confirm their 

Since we are bootstrapping the QGIS.org <http://qgis.org/> organisation, we have not yet elected any voting members. Currently there are 10 QGIS User Groups registered [3], thus we would like to invite all people who have Git commit access to any official QGIS repo, or transifex write access to make their nominations for their community voting members. The 10 consenting nominees with the highest number of nominations will be appointed as community voting members. 

We will close the nomination period on Wed 11 May if at least 10 unique persons have been nominated, otherwise as soon as 10 unique persons have been nominated.

We will maintain a list of the QGIS Voting Members on the web site for public viewing.

After all of the voting members have been elected they will be asked to elect the members of the board. Board members need not be voting members, any QGIS community member can be elected to the board. For formation of the new board, existing PSC members will automatically be nominated and the community voting members can also put up additional nominations. We would then put the election of the board members to a vote (maintaining the same number of members as are currently in the PSC for now). Once the board has officially been elected, the voting members can then select a chair for the board. Note that all voting will be done electronically via an online form.

By this process we will have a democratically elected board entrusted with stewardship of the new QGIS.org <http://qgis.org/> Organisation. 

Each year we will hold an annual general meeting and voting members can elect a new chair, or re-elect the existing chair. Similarly on a rotational basis, board members will be up for re-election each year. If things are a little unclear above, I have made a simple diagram which hopefully clarifies things (see [4] below). Note that Gary Sherman (QGIS project founder) is board member emeritus and this will not be up for re-election as he has life long tenure on the board.

So if you are eligible to nominate voting members (i.e. you are a committer on any official QGIS repo or a Transifex author), please head over to the link provided in [2] below and make your nomination!

Can you open an issue and assign it to me? Can you try to reorder the
columns (there's a button on the right side of the toolbar) and check if
that fixes the issue.
I'll be out of office though the next days, so I'm sorry that I can't
handle it before the weekend.

You can only install apps provided by the store.

Not at all, that's the problem: you basically break OTA updates and
probably many other things.

But technically, you can probably compile QGIS on that device.

Keep me posted: I also have one of those.

I'm just returning mine: I would never call that a "Linux tablet".
It is "linux based", but totally different from a little linux box.
A RPi is much closer to my needs.

Do you have an example table that works in 2.8 and does in 2.14?

e.g. this

SELECT a.id, a.geom, b.inizio
FROM tab1 a, tab2 b;

where the id is not unique.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] closestSegmentWithContext
Message-ID: <1845b515-fbc4-bd48-29bc-1dd69d6812b0@mindspring.com>

I'm trying to use "closestSegmentWithContext" method of QgsGeometry in a 
plugin. I don't seem to be getting what I'm expecting.

Comparing 
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsGeometry.html#ac09505a6a8a29f244a37c6f336cd98e7

with the following from: 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/core/geometry/qgsgeometry.sip

     /**
      * Searches for the closest segment of geometry to the given point
      * @param point Specifies the point for search
      * @param minDistPoint Receives the nearest point on the segment
      * @param afterVertex Receives index of the vertex after the 
closest segment. The vertex
      * before the closest segment is always afterVertex - 1
      * @param leftOf Out: Returns if the point lies on the left of 
right side of the segment ( < 0 means left, > 0 means right )
      * @param epsilon epsilon for segment snapping (added in 1.8)
      * @return The squared cartesian distance is also returned in 
sqrDist, negative number on error
      */
     double closestSegmentWithContext( const QgsPoint& point, QgsPoint& 
minDistPoint /Out/, int& afterVertex /Out/ ) const;


When I try:

    results =
    self.selectedStreetSegment.geometry().closestSegmentWithContext(point)


I get a results as:

    (2560.365846544, (2106395, 746610), 1)

I take this to be (sqrDist, minDistPoint, afterVertex ).  It does not 
seem to be returning "leftOf" which is the value I'm looking for.

Is something missing in that "sip" definition?  I do not know what I'm 
looking at so I may be looking at the wrong thing. In any case, I cannot 
seem to find the results I need.

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] deprecated methods
Message-ID: <3c360db6-cedb-842b-e6e8-26b72cd6935d@mindspring.com>

Hi all,

I've run into a problem with some plugins I'm writing.  I am using some 
methods which are showing up as deprecated.

When trying to convert to the suggested new methods, they seem to not be 
available.

for example:  Q_DECL_DEPRECATED void QgsVectorLayer::setEditorWidgetV2  
suggests "Use editFormConfig()->setWidgetType() instead".

The method, "editFormConfig", does not seem to be available in QGIS v2.8 
on my Ubuntu machine.

Is there documentation on when methods are added?  In other words, what 
QGIS version has what new stuff?

MapServer has in their documentation "added in v5.4".  This helps me 
know the minimum version needed to use that method.

It would be nice if QGIS has similar information in the documentation.  
This would help in setting the minimum required QGIS version in plugins.

I do not expect someone to edit all the documentation to add this 
information. :-) It would be nice to see this included in future 
additions to the code.

Thanks,
-- 
*Worth Lutz*

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Strange attribute table behaviour
Message-ID: <CAJvo+18RvW2o0VF1C-WM5KTHx7dHWujhxDncRzpjcfwMF1ReDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have some tables with a primary key but without the typical "nextval(...
sequence...)" definition:

CREATE TABLE nplso_2495.chcantoncode
(
  itfcode integer NOT NULL,
  ilicode character varying(1024) NOT NULL,
  seq integer,
  dispname character varying(250) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT chcantoncode_pkey PRIMARY KEY (itfcode)
)
WITH (
  OIDS=FALSE
);

I can load the table in QGIS but when opening the attribute table it only
shows three times the "itfcode" column.

It works with tables with a primary key like this:

t_id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('nplso_2495.t_ili2db_seq'::regclass),

Can anybody confirm? I'm on master on ubuntu 16.04.

regards
Stefan

setEditorWidgetV2 is not deprecated in 2.8 [0] it deprecated in 2.14 [1] and
there editFormConfig() is available [2].   There should be a "added in" note -
but that's apparently missing for editFormConfig().

Yes, I'm still using  setEditorWidgetV2()  in my plugin because of v2.8 
being in use.  I was just trying to determine what minimum version would 
be necessary to start using editFormConfig().

  Looking at your links, I think I see part of my problem. Google is 
taking me to:

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorLayer.html

Note no version number after "/api/".

This page is also 'green' not 'blue' like the pages you referenced. I 
wondered about that color change. :-)

Thanks for confirming that the "added in" note should exist.  Those help 
in setting the minimum required QGIS version for plugins.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Images and button in Qt Designer
Message-ID: <572C5005.4040708@gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I'm facing a very annoying problem. In some UI of a plugin I need to add 
some icons in a QPushButton.

Qt Designer allows to add icons in 2 ways (I think):

1. by choosing the file in the computer (so a simple image)
2. by adding images of a resource file

The 1. method doesn't give any trouble with QGIS but the icon is not 
visible once the plugin is loaded.

With the 2. method I have some problem in QGIS. Once saved the UI, Qt 
adds the following lines to the code (interface.ui file):


<resources>
   <include location="resources.qrc"/>
</resources>


and I've compiled the resource file with:


pyrcc4 -o resources.py resources.qrc


without any errors.
but this causes a crash of the plugin once loaded:


ImportError: No module named resources_rc


am I missing something?

Thanks to all

Cheers

Matteo

You could try :
pyrcc4.exe -o resources_rc.py resources.qrc

Hi Tom,

> http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/139625/qgis-plugin-problems-importing-resources-resources-rc-file-plugin-doasnt-l

yep, I read it but all the solutions listed did not worked for me..

1. deleting the <resources> lines in the UI is useless.. each time you 
edit the UI again you will get the same error

2. recompiling with pyrcc4.... did not worked

3. the long answer (that explains the problem) suggests to get back to 
the previous method of the plugin building.. and that's, IMHO, not the 
best idea.. :)

So I'm looking at a method that works with the new method of the UI 
importing without breaking the code

Thanks for the answer!

Matteo

I'm on a Linux machine (my fault I did not say anything in the mail).

But I think I already tried what you suggest with

pyrcc4 -o resources_rc.py resources.qrc


but I get always the same error..

Thanks!

 Hello, friends,
I am looking for an external Python which uses QGIS.
For instance, it uses intersection, takes in 2 files, and generate and save an output file.
Is there a Python script available for just doing this?  Or, is there something similar?
It is out of curiosity.  I would like to see how external Python can use QGIS resources.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Regards.
David

Dear Friends,
As I understand, Zonal Statistics works like a vector layer overlaying a raster layer and produces statistics.
I tried.  However, it does not produce any statistics.
Can any one help?

I did but I don't get it..

The resource.py and the resource.qrc files are by default present in the 
plugin folder.

If I add an icon with Qt Designer (I put the icon in a icons folder in 
the plugin tree) and I choose the existing resource.qrc file as resource 
file.. after the compilation command

pyrcc4 -o resource.py resource.qrc

the loading fails with the cited error of above..

have I to edit in some way the resources.py?

Thanks again

Matteo

This is a complicated problem. As you may notice, I was part of the 
thread mentioned below.

I have found ways to work around this problem.  I will see if I can put 
together a lengthy explanation of the problem and some of the solutions 
this weekend or early next week.  (Today is too booked up :-().

I have seen this problem several times with the plugin-builder plugins...

Not sure what exactly the problem is, but I solve it by adding the
following just below the import lines in __init__.py

import os
import site
site.addsitedir(os.path.abspath('%s' % os.path.dirname(__file__)))

the actual problem is the name of modules/classes...

Regards,

Richard

Hi Richard,

thanks for also your support.. It seems that in some way the problem has 
been solved.

For sure in all my attempts I mixed some files and other stuff.. So what 
seems working is:

1. when adding a new icon in Qt, I choose to load it from the existing 
resource file of the plugin. In the menu click on the arrow and -> 
Choose Resource

2. edit the resource and add the other icons (even in other folders, 
mines for examples are in plugins/plugin_root/icons/)

3. save the UI and run the compilation of the resources as suggest by 
Ginetto

pyrcc4 -o resources.py resources.qrc

now the plugin shows the icon in the pushbutton..

I don't know how/what I did.. If I mixed some commands..

For the moment it seems working.. (tried to add other icons, reload the 
plugin, make some changes in the dialog.py)

So thanks to all the feedbacks.. (maybe it is worth to add this part in 
the cookbook?)

Cheers

Matteo

Thanks for that link.  That's the direction I'm headed.

I posted here to find out if this is an error in the python 
implementation or documentation and see if I should submit an issue.

You have stumbled on a temporary solution.  If you open the resources in 
QT Designer again, you may see the problem again. Running pyrcc4 will be 
necessary.

I'm finding that I'm spending lots of time trying to figure out method 
parameters in Python.

The documented QGIS API apparently does not match the Python API. See 
question in email below.  Compare the documents with the statement I 
ended up with and you see the differences.

It seems that I'm having to experiment to figure out what to do for many 
objects.

This is frustrating and I wonder if I am just missing something.

Hi David,
This kind of question is for the User list.
Secondly you have to write more:
What have you tried with the function (ex. Created a shape polygon, Drawing polygons, Saved polygons, Run Zonal Stat…)
Version of program (ex. 2.14.1),
Platform (ex. Windows 7)

If we don´t get that kind of informations – it´s  impossible to help.

Dear Friends,

As I understand, Zonal Statistics works like a vector layer overlaying a raster layer and produces statistics.

I tried.  However, it does not produce any statistics.

Can any one help?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Why is QgsCoordinateTransform a QObject?
Message-ID: <CAB28Asjq3qLF99gv+guN3Kg3recFCoHxuzi1R1qG3ke8HnF4ew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm wondering if anyone can shed any light onto why
QgsCoordinateTransform is a QObject? I can't see any good reason for
this within the QGIS code itself, given that:

- the slots initialise(), readXML() and writeXML() are never used as
slots, but instead just called directly
- there is only one signal, invalidTransformInput(), which nothing connects to

Given this, it seems unnecessary to make QgsCoordinateTransform a
QObject subclass, and in doing so it complicates copying/assigning
QgsCoordinateTransform objects.

Can anyone explain this? Any objections if I change this for 3.0?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [plugins] python 3 support
Message-ID: <57304FA3.8000408@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am raising this again....

Now that we can build QGIS with Qt5, Python 3, PyQt5, an open question
remains: how do plugins will handle with this?
Starting a QGIS built with PyQt5 using enabled plugins will probably
report a lot of Python crashes.

Right now, there is an option to port plugins when building QGIS.
This solution is fine at the moment although it requires a rebuild every
time you install a new plugin.

But later on, whenever QGIS 3 arises, it would be perfect to offer a way
to plugins to support both 2.x and 3.x, or not?

I believe plugins should tell if they handle python2/pyqt4 or
python3/pyqt5 or both (probably using qgis.PyQt package).
If we choose this path, it should be included in next QGIS release.
I started a PR on this topic [0] but it only propose to the plugin to
say if they support Python3/PyQt5 and assumes that it can support only
one. This would need to be updated so plugins could support both.

What do you think?
Should we stick to the port-plugins and offer nothing else?

Cheers,

Denis

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6HgY5vYYN6PV_EAymMNt7aE5biRdJULOkZQJ55Nu5CTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I have just found a memory leak in QGIS Desktop (and server) with the
project available in [1] ( a 20Mo tar.bz2 )

This is a very simple project with only one buildings Shapefile ( SHP
68Mo). This layer has been exported from PostGIS from a query wich aimed to
simplify the building for fast rendering.

The geometries have been simplified ( I used SnapToGrid, then
(St_Dump(St_Union(a.geom)))  to remove as many nodes as possible )

The layers has ~ 700 000 features.

Has anyone encoutered such a leak ?

I forgot to mention the steps to reproduce the bug, and the precautions to
take :

* open the project in QGIS 2.14 ( I have not tested with older versions)

* open a terminal and use this kind of command to monitor QGIS memory
consumption : htop, or ps with
watch -n1 'ps -aux --sort -pmem | head -5'

* Navigate through the project by zooming in and out, pan, etc. I think you
emphasize the memory leak by displaying the layer at small scale ( with
many buildings displayed)

* Be aware that this will increase the memory, so keep an eye on the memory
consumption so that your system has enough free memory to work properly.

This only ports core plugins, so this does not help at all with 3rd
party plugins.

I would like to see flags for

py2pyqt4
py3pyqt5
py3pyqt5-experimental

The last one will allow plugin authors to start porting and receive user
feedback while not yet promoting their plugin as stable under this version.

Normally a dev should manually run scripts/2to3 on his plugin, fix
remaining issues and flag as compatible (or experimental if he wants
broader testing first).

Hi again,

I also forgot to mention that I have no memory leak when using the same
dataset in PostGIS ( tested by importing the Shapefile in PostGIS with
shape2pgsql )

Have you tested with either the latest 2.14 nightly or master nightly?
An issue with OGR connection pooling has been resolved recently. And I
wonder if that could be related.

Hi Matthias,

Not yet, I need to build QGIS master before being able to report back
Thanks for your answer

Subject: [Qgis-developer] "Best"/most used tileserver layer method
Message-ID: <1462808061693-5265395.post@n6.nabble.com>

Am I right that there is no native way to add a tileserver
(http://blah.com/x/y/z etc) layer in QGIS? Is there one overriding method
people use - one plugin preferred over others? I want people to be able to
add tileserver layers easily to qgis2web webmaps, but I have to know what
form they will take in QGIS in order to achieve this.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsFeatureRequest::FilterFid and
 QgsFeatureRequest::FilterFids do not retrieve the same Feature
Message-ID: <5730B41B.1000104@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I have an issue in QGIS Server with features filtered by FeatureId. I 
can reproduce the issue in Python console.

With a vector that has joined attributes and virtual attributes, the 
QgsFeatureRequest::FilterFid retrieves a feature with all the attributes 
values but just the layer fields.
With the same layer, the QgsFeatureRequest::FilterFids with 1 featureId 
retrieves a feature with all the attributes values and fields.

You can test it in the Python console with that code wher `l` is the 
vector layer
```
fr = QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFid( 2 
).setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.NoFlags)
fit = l.getFeatures( fr )
for feat in fit:
   len( feat.fields().toList() )
   len( feat.attributes() )

fr = QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFids( [2] 
).setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.NoFlags)
fit = l.getFeatures( fr )
for feat in fit:
   len( feat.fields().toList() )
   len( feat.attributes() )
```
In the first case, the len will be different, in the second case it is 
the same.

Does some one know how to fix it ?

Regards,
René-Luc

Hi

I just tested with a freshly built QGIS release-2_14 , and the issue
remains.
The easiest way to reproduce is to zoom back and forth from big scales ( ~
1:25 000 ) to layer extent scale ( ~ 1:600 000 )

Good evening/morning
Michaël

Today me and my collegues were experimenting with a QgsApplication instance
within a python web application.
While doing some tests on concurrency a question arised in my mind: is QGIS
Server supposed to manage concurrent requests when run as FastCGI?

Probably it's a noob question but I haven't been able to give me a clear
answer...

Should be fixed by
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/6b80518a5b55ab30fb19493266d5626d0f89d26b

There was a leak in the OGR provider when a feature had null geometry
and a filter rect was set on a feature request (such as when rendering
a map).

I also fixed another (potentially huge?) memory leak in the python code.

Would appreciate testing and feedback on whether this has made a big
difference for you!

Hi Giovanni

No, the server classes (same as most QGIS classes outside of data access 
/ rendering ) are not thread safe. The server handles multiple requests 
in different processes.

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Any chance we could delay freeze until after the
	Girona hackfest?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgCh32f+QNkC-O3e5iqHToU5a=h2s8z272vJmEoT9jdsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all (specifically Jürgen),

I'm just wondering if there's any chance of delaying the feature
freeze for 2.16 until after the Girona hackfest?

It seems a shame to freeze a week before, when there's likely going to
be some cool new stuff developed during the hackfest (which would then
need to wait until the indefinite 3.0 release to be available in a
stable release).

(Apologies for bringing this up so late - I guess I hadn't realised
how close freeze + the hackfest were until now).

Hi all,
this seems reasonable to me. On the other hand, one could argument that
freezing before the HF will help people at the HF to concentrate on the
migration, our big challenge ahead.
So in short it's a 0 from me.
Thanks Nyall for raising this.
All the best.

Good catch - fixed in

Message-ID: <1fd03621e9f4123b3055a004b2b3d28b@carto.net>

Hi QGIS devs, Hi Nathan, 

I would really like to see the work of the aggregate expression
functions land in 2.16 - if possible. We are also the funders of this
work. 

Is there a chance that this can be commented/agreed/disagreed by more
devs and then hopefully accepted? See
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/59 

Thank you very much, 

Andreas

Hi Marco, thanks for the reply.
I imagined that but I couldn't find where QGIS Server spawns new processes
to handle the incoming requests. Could you point me to the lines where it
happens?

QGIS Server do not spawn any process (it *is* the process), apache FastCGI
or whatever you are using does.

QGIS Server does not spawn the new processes itself. This is done by the 
apache fcgid module (https://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/).

Right, thanks.
I didn't know fastcgi was conceptually designed to do single threading, and
that apache mod_fcgid spawns a new process for each single request. That's
wht I was looking into QGIS Server itself.

We usually use different deployment means, but it's important to have a
clear answer on QGIS Server non thread safety.

Thanks,
giovanni

I imagined that but I couldn't find where QGIS Server spawns new processes

happens?


QGIS Server does not spawn the new processes itself. This is done by the
apache fcgid module (https://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsFieldExpressionWidget return the results of the
	expression
Message-ID: <573208E1.8020901@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm struggling with a maybe simple issue..

In a plugin I have added a QgsFieldExpressionWidget connected to a 
QgsMapLayerComboBox..

What I am currently trying to do without any result is to get a list of 
the field values filtered with the result of the expression added

In a *normal* QgsFieldComboBox I achive it as follows:

# QgsMapLayerComboBox
lay1 = self.Field1.layer()
# QgsFieldComboBox
lay1_f = self.Field1.currentField()


# create the list of the selected fields
f1 = []
     for i in lay1.getFeatures():
     f1.append(i[lay1_f])


so f1 is a list of the selected filed..

In the API I saw that QgsFieldExpressionWidget returns a tuple 
(Expression text, if expression is used, is expression is valid)..

the expression text is accessible with the currentText() method.. but if 
I add an expression the above method doesn't work (e.g. if I try to 
divide by 10 the field AAA:

KeyError
'AAA / 10'

so I'm not able to combine the expression added as filter for the field

Someone has any suggestions?

Thanks in advance

Cheers

Matteo

You’re doing feature[field_name] which is fine, but doing feature[expression] is not valid because there is no index corresponding.
You need to evaluate the expression.

So basically, just test if currentField returns an expression or not.
If not, keep your line.
If it is, evaluate the expression 
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsExpression.html#a279785f0a59cc4ac977022797599bdc6 <https://qgis.org/api/classQgsExpression.html#a279785f0a59cc4ac977022797599bdc6>

I hope this helps!

Awesome!

Thanks for the tip!

This is the way I solved the problem (not sure if it is the best one, 
but it seems working):

if self.expField.currentField()[1] == False:
     for i in lay1.getFeatures():
         f1.append(i[lay1_f])
else:
     filter = self.expField.currentField()[0]
     exp = QgsExpression(filter)
     for i in lay1.getFeatures():
         f1.append(exp.evaluate(i, lay1.pendingFields()))


Thanks again!

Matteo

Hi Stefan,

Did you already try to start with a complete new build directory? And
in case of using ccache delete the compiler cache?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] update QgsDataDefinedButton with
	QgsMapLayerComboBox
Message-ID: <57332878.3070709@gmail.com>

HI devs,

sorry to write again.. but I'm fighting (again) with Qt and QGIS widgets..

In the UI I have a simple spinbox and I'd like to add the chance for the 
user to use the data defined properties to update the value in the spinbox.

Unfortunately I'm not able to update the QgsMapLayerComboBox widget to 
the QgsDataDefinedButton one.

With a QgsFieldComboBox I found the easy way signal - solot:

layerChanged(QgsMapLayer*) -> setLayer(QgsMapLayer*)

that updates the QgsFieldComboBox (same thing with 
QgsFieldExpressionComboBox).

But I did not find something similar in the QgsDataDefinedButton API.

Am I missing something?

Thanks to all

Cheers

Matteo

look at QgsDataDefinedButton::init

That should set up the button for a layer.
It is not a slot though, not sure if you can connect this directly, you
might need to create an intermediate method.

Hi Denis,
thanks (again) for the answer..

ok so you think something like

self.dataDefined.__init__(vl=self.LayerCombo.currentLayer())

to put in the __init__ method of the class right?

Thanks again

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SIP 4.18 and ConvertToSubClassCode
Message-ID: <711822ad-a351-508e-1b37-20af6f392269@gmail.com>

Hi

Fedora has updated to SIP 4.18, and I'm now seeing some issues with 
subclass conversions, in particular

composerView.composition().getComposerItemById("aQgsComposerLabel")

does not anymore return a QgsComposerLabel instance, but rather a 
QgsComposerItem instance.

Does anyone familiar with SIP know how to debug this? I've tried playing 
around with the ConvertToSubClassCode code in qgscomposeritem.sip, in 
particular changing sipClass with sipType (having read that the former 
is deprecated [1]), but no improvements. I actually don't even see that 
code executing by setting a breakpoint in sip_corepart0.cpp.

So, any ideas?

Thanks

Sandro

Hi Sandro,

Just to be sure, did you also try with the non-closed upstream QGIS code?

Hi Matthias

Ah, forgot to specify: this is with the latest qgis master:

c.composition().getComposerItemById("Text")
<qgis._core.QgsComposerItem object at 0x7f83eb945808>

Hello,

I've made a pull request to add annotations in canvas image export here:

This is a small change and we would like it to be merged before freeze.

Could someone make a review ?

Hello,

I've open a pull request to output tables without geometries using 
VectorWriter and OutputVector classes.
This correspond now perfectly with the input ParameterTable which takes 
all layers, regadless of the geometry column.

Using this, I've improved "Refactor fields" algorithm so we can now 
"refactor" the same way tables with or without geometry.

It also and permit to save tables without geometries in several formats 
using native QGIS providers.
Note that for now, tables can only be saved in "csv" format.

I think it would be good to merge this before freeze.
Could someone take a look at it.

Best regards

Subject: [Qgis-developer] (generic?) sanity checks of files
Message-ID: <57341F59.4010906@duif.net>

Hi,

I downloaded a osm shape + some osm style files, to find out (actually
needed Nyall for this: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14804 ) that QGIS
freaks out trying to paint stuff in Map Units while the shp is in
degrees....

I'm wondering IF this is a very seldom occuring case and keep it like it
is now, OR if there is a need for such checks (maybe more general checks
for validity or sanity of the different conf files (qlr, qml, symbol.xml
etc etc) that can be loaded nowadays in QGIS)?

Regards,

Richard

Hi Richard,

Good idea.
What kind of compatibility checks would you propose?

Compare the CRS for which a style file was generated and the target
layer and warn if they mismatch? That could potentially be annoying, but
it might give a hint in case something goes wrong.
Or do some measurements (but since measurements are a function of units,
map CRS, zoom level and potentially attributes this may be a very
unstable science)?

We could possibly limit the pen width to a reasonable size (in painter
units). Qt tends to freak out when a pen width is overly large....

That would fix the original issue, in any case.

Hi all

Firstly my apologies if things are not all as clear as they should be for the community voting member nomination process - please bear in mind that we are bootstrapping the QGIS.org <http://qgis.org/> and the governance of it and we can certainly expect some teething troubles along the way. I would like to respond to some of the queries that have been raised and extend the deadline (new deadline is Friday 20 May 2016) for voting to accommodate those who still have doubts. I am going to write mainly in bullet points to keep things as clear as possible.

Eligibility to nominate:
=================

If you fall into one of these groups you can make your nominations:

* all people with commit rights to any official QGIS repository on GitHub : https://github.com/orgs/qgis/people <https://github.com/orgs/qgis/people> (note that page is paginated so check the subsequent pages if you are not on the first page)
* language maintainers and admins for any officially translated language on transifex for any of these transifex projects: QGIS Desktop, QGIS Documentation, QGIS Website - https://www.transifex.com/qgis/ <https://www.transifex.com/qgis/>

Nomination process:
================

* if you fall into any of the above groups you can nominate UP TO TEN persons from the broader QGIS community who you consider to be good candidates to be QGIS Community Voting members
* once all of the nominations are in, we will count the nominations and elect the community voting members based on the number of votes they have received.
* in the event of a tie breaker (e.g. the number of nominees exceeds 11 nominees with the lowest number of votes have the same amount of votes so we cannot determine the ’top eleven’), we will provide an opportunity to do another round of nominations for the contested places.
* Make your nomination using this form: http://goo.gl/forms/vkoYZkE03C <http://goo.gl/forms/vkoYZkE03C>
* PSC members may also participate in the nomination process but are not eligible for nomination
* I encourage you to be diverse in your nominations - QGIS aspires to be a welcoming community to people from all walks of life and we do not discriminate based on coders, non-coders, religion, race, gender, sexual orientation, geographic community etc. See our diversity statement: https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/codeofconduct/diversitystatement.html <https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/codeofconduct/diversitystatement.html> and code of conduct: https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/codeofconduct/codeofconduct.html <https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/codeofconduct/codeofconduct.html>
* You do not need to contact your nominee first to determine if they are willing to serve as voting member. We will verify each shortlisted nominee is available to serve  as a community voting member and remove them from the master list if they are not.
* The deadline for nominations has been extended until Midnight CET, Friday 20 May 2016

User groups:
============

* User groups may replace their voting member at any time
* User group voting members are NOT eligible to elect the community voting members unless they are also in one of the groups listed above in ‘eligibility to nominate'
* The following representatives of user groups will automatically be assumed to be the user group voting member representatives:

Contact person		QGIS User Group name
——————————————————————————————————
1 Brent Wood		NIWA QGIS USer Group
2 Anibal Alarcon		Lima Perú QGIS User Group
3 Paolo Cavallini	Gruppo degli utenti italiani di QGIS
4 Lene Fischer		QGIS Brugergruppe Danmark
5 Ross McDonald	QGIS UK - Scottish User Group
6 simon miles		England
7 João Gaspar		QGIS Portugal
8 Kevin Williams		Wales (Cymru)
9 Thomas Schüttenberg	QGIS Anwendergruppe Deutschland e.V. (QGIS-DE e.V.)
10 Andreas Neumann		QGIS User Group Switzerland
11 Milena Nowotarska	Polska Grupa Użytkowników QGIS

What happens next?
================

* After the nomination process for the QGIS Community Voting members there will be 23 voting members consisting of:
  * 11 User group voting members
  * 11 Community voting members
  * 1 OSGEO board voting member
* The voting members will elect the board
* All current PSC members will (unless they request otherwise) be candidates for election to the board
* Voting members may nominate additional candidates for the board election
* The candidates can be ANY QGIS community member (i.e. not only those identified in the eligibility to nominate section above)

* The PSC currently consists of 
   * 1 Tim Sutton (Chair), 
   * 2 Paolo Cavallini (Vice chair), 
   * 3 Otto Dassau
   * 4 Marco Hugentobler
   * 5 Anita Graser
   * 6 Andreas Neumann (treasurer)
   * 7 Richard Duivenvoorde
   * 8 Paolo Cavallini
   * 9 Jürgen Fischer
   * 10 Gary Sherman (project founder, honorary member for life)

* The voting members will elect the Board consisting of 9 elected members + Gary Sherman by electronic vote
* The Board, when elected, will elect a chairman
* We are going to move the first Annual General Meeting of the Board to Bonn later this year
* We will announce the election results at the AGM meeting in Bonn later this year
* If you would like to discuss anything about the Verein procedures, join us at the Town Hall Meeting on 26 May 2016 at the QGIS User conference - http://www.sigte.udg.edu/jornadassiglibre/en/international-qgis-user-and-developer-conference/conferencia-qgis/ <http://www.sigte.udg.edu/jornadassiglibre/en/international-qgis-user-and-developer-conference/conferencia-qgis/> (details still pending on that page)

* The voting members will be asked to approve the QGIS.org <http://qgis.org/> budget each year (by electronic vote)
* The voting members will be asked to approve the project status report from the chair each year (by electronic vote)
* The voting members will be asked to vote on board member elections
* Voting members will NOT be required to attend meetings in-person in order to vote, but will be expected to vote and stay informed about the QGIS project in order to make a meaningful vote.



This is all rather complicated...
=======================

Yes I know and I can only apologise for that! We are trying to keep things as simple as possible whilst still keeping it democratic and fair. Its not easy to balance these things and we expect to iteratively improve and refine the process over time. As an organisation there are various statutory requirements we need to adhere to and various procedural requirements that we need to follow if we are to change our 	voting system etc. I expect that we will do a revision to the above process based on your (constructive) feedback, but we need to limit these amendments to as few as possible because it is a high administrative overhead to deal with changes to the QGIS.org <http://qgis.org/> statutes.


Please feel free to contact me if you have any queries, I will try to help / address your concerns.

With thanks,

Maybe I miss something with the release process. I wonder why QGIS 2.14.2 (
b3e642c <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/b3e642c> in Osgeo4W) doesn't
contain Processing updates like this:

That was merged to master and not the release branch.

Hi all,

I'd be in favor too. We have a few things in the pipeline and if are
going to get the last 2.x it means a long time without release.

Regarding this, is there any official decision made? If not, I think we
are losing a bit of credibility here. As people pointed out last time,
it is required for organizations to plan in advance the releases.

Cheers,

Denis

Dear list,

Using QGIS 2.14.2 on Windows 7 I get the following error message when 
zooming out on a shapefile layer that has labels switched on:

GEOS
Exception: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of points in 
LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or >= 4

It seems to be an old bug (https://hub.qgis.org/issues/9375) that was 
fixed 2 years ago.

It doesn't seem to cause any problems otherwise. Anyone else have this 
issue? Should I file a new bug report?

Regards,
Janneke

Hi, I think this pull https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2900 fixes the error.
But it is pending to merge, It needs to fix some tests to be accepted finally.Meanwhile you can disable the on-the-fly simplification of the layer.

Using QGIS 2.14.2 on Windows 7 I get the following error message when 
zooming out on a shapefile layer that has labels switched on:

GEOS
Exception: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of points in 
LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or >= 4

It seems to be an old bug (https://hub.qgis.org/issues/9375) that was 
fixed 2 years ago.

It doesn't seem to cause any problems otherwise. Anyone else have this 
issue? Should I file a new bug report?

Regards,
Janneke

Hi Janneke,

Best thing to do is file an issue at http://hub.qgis.org/issues with a
copy of your data + sample project. If you do that this bug should be
easy for us to squash!

Thanks,
Nyall

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Feature-request/idea: timely data-source updates
Message-ID: <5735EBCF.1060405@duif.net>


Hi,

I got a question from somebody to write a python plugin which retrieves
features via a (simple) WFS-request.
BUT, data being moving items, IF it was possible to update that layer
once every x minutes.

Off course this is in this case pretty easy (I think) doable via a
python plugin...

BUT I was wondering if there would be interest into making this maybe an
integral part for every dataprovider or maplayer?

For example for every layer  in QGIS there is an option in the
properties (and an api-call via layer.setUpdateTime(onlyVisiblePart) or
layer.setValidity(onlyVisiblePart) or so) to let the layer update it's
data every x minutes..... (if possible via some fancy graphic
visualisation like fade in the new one / fade out the old one ;-) )

This would voor example make it possible that a QGIS window stays open and:
- a database is updated
- a raster file/source is updated everytime
- a vector file is updated
etc etc

Anybody thinks there is an interest in this (or do I just miss something
and is this already available???)?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce that we found a way to integrate proper NULL value
support for also for pre-PyQt 5.7 versions.

This fix has been sponsored by OPENGIS.ch - like many others to pave the
road towards proper python 3 and Qt5 support.

Hi Nyall,

I have just tested it with today's master, and there is no memory leak any
more. Thanks a lot for helping solving this nasty one.
Could you please backport the related "memory leak" commits to the 2.14
release branch ?

Cheers,
Michaël

Thanks for the confirmation. I'll backport sometime next week (got a bunch

Hi Nyall,
I'm working on it. Alvaro's answer pointed me in the direction of 
potential issues with virtual fields containing geometry, and while 
testing this I'm running into some other issues. Trying to investigate 
and will come back with data and a way to reproduce the issues.
Thanks!
Janneke

We get this a *lot* using 2.12 on OSX, and possibly on 2.8 as well.
I've not been able to consistently pin it down to any one geometry
though so haven't been able to open a bug report. Will be really
interested to hear of any solutions.

John.

Hi all,
is there some documentation for the new Edit widgets? Especially

I have not found anything on the manual.
Thanks for any hint.

Hi Alvaro,

How do I disable the on-the-fly simplification?
Do I understand it correctly that the error causes problems with a 
virtual field with a geometry calculation in it? Would that also be 
solved by disabling on-the-fly simplification? Or should I avoid the 
issues by not making it a virtual field - if I know that the polygons 
won't be edited?

Thanks for your insights,
Janneke

Hi Matthias!

Sounds very nice! Thanks for investing so much effort into it.
I think QGIS with Qt5 and Python3 will be great!

Nice!

Any plan to maybe write a nice blog on opengis.ch about it?  I'm curious
about the way you integrated it (it seemed a big puzzle isn't it?). I
would also be much helped by some info about the possibility to compile
(and run) both a python2/Qt4 and a python3/Qt5 version (on Debian :-) ).

But again: thanks for your efforts in this!

Regards,

Richard

Ah, now that would make sense why I could never find a bad geometry in
my data if if was the simplified geometry that was in error. Won't
waste anymore time chasing that one then :-)

Hi Janneke, you are right. The simplification process is executed just when the original geometry is read from data source and it can create invalid geometries. These invalid geometries will be used in subsequent processes using geometry calculations.
You can disable the simplification of a layer from its options menu -> properties -> rendering -> uncheck the "simplify geometry" CheckBox. Or you can disable the simplification by default from -> settings -> options -> rendering -> uncheck the "Enable feature simplification by default ..." CheckBox.
This pull request moves the simplification just when the geometry is rendered, the geometry remains unchanged from the data source in order to avoid these problems.

 Hi Alvaro,
 
 How do I disable the on-the-fly simplification?
 Do I understand it correctly that the error causes problems with a virtual field with a geometry calculation in it? Would that also be solved by disabling on-the-fly simplification? Or should I avoid the issues by not making it a virtual field - if I know that the polygons won't be edited? 
 
 Thanks for your insights,
 Janneke

 Hi, I think this pull https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2900 fixes the error. 
  But it is pending to merge, It needs to fix some tests to be accepted finally. Meanwhile you can disable the on-the-fly simplification of the layer.

 Dear list,
 
 Using QGIS 2.14.2 on Windows 7 I get the following error message when 
 zooming out on a shapefile layer that has labels switched on:
 
 GEOS
 Exception: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of points in 
 LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or >= 4
 
 It seems to be an old bug (https://hub.qgis.org/issues/9375) that was 
 fixed 2 years ago.
 
 It doesn't seem to cause any problems otherwise. Anyone else have this 
 issue? Should I file a new bug report?
 
 Regards,
 Janneke

I'm thinking about it.
The commands to build with Python3 and Qt5 are at the bottom of this
blog post:

http://www.opengis.ch/2016/05/04/qgis-qt5-and-python3-migration-current-state/

Apart from this, dependencies need to be installed (pyqt5-python3,
qwt-qt5, qwtpolar-qt5 (optional), qscintilla2-qt5, qt5 -> look for dev
packages for all of them)

Thanks for this. I agree that having a practical way of installing
packages for both versions on Debian (which I believe is the platform we
receive most feedback from) is important to ensure proper early testing.
Ready to help if useful.
All the best.

 Good day Devs, 

While discussing the merit of retaining the 'Colour Scale Bar' plugin in
the repo with Paolo (see email trail below) I've raised the following
points because I do not know if this is possible at present in QGIS
(didn't find how to do it!): 

 	* How to control the number of displayed decimals in the raster scale
bar other than manually?
 	* It seems that decimation of long colour bars is done when the scale
bar is created but cannot be modified afterwards, implying that resizing
of the legend is not possible other than changing the symbol height. Is
this the correct behaviour, or do I miss something?

Regards,
Benoit de Cabissole 

-------- Original Message -------- 

Bonjour Benoit,
I think what you mention is already possible. Would you mind discussing
about this on the mailing list?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PostgreSQL table with column-specific insert
	permissions
Message-ID: <CANFg2AW5onyX8oSGPNpHRz=G8-BYnUec-5+xn7nUaL7Sihrg8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

Our team has recently found that whenever we define a PostgreSQL table with
column-specific insert permissions (see [1]), QGIS does not allow the
option to save a new feature, although it seems that is possible to update.

We checked that there are previous issues filed regarding this topic (
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/2468 and https://hub.qgis.org/issues/2689).

We would like to ask if there are any plans to support this PostgreSQL
behaviour in the future.

Thank you for your time,

Kind regards!!

Ps. I´m not sure if this is the right channel to communicate issues. If
there is another one better, please, tell me.

QGIS doesn't support attribute level permissions.   A provider can only return
layer level capabilities
(https://qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorDataProvider.html#a1a360c9e78933697b9f9be334cfcaf7a)

In the postgres case column permissions are only evaluate on the geometry
column as that can be mapped to the ChangeGeometries capabilities (ie. layers
only have that capabilities when UPDATE on that column is granted).

The interface of the vector layers would need to enhanced to make this
possible.  The INSERT case would probably mean that new features are missing
attributes or are readonly and need be skipped when adding features.

	switching
Message-ID: <CAMB2qw1TYVAYzDn=KwgB4fubxcA93R7qJ39DOzz_tHpqjYdr1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

occasionally I have problems with QGIS Server 2.14.0-2 (but not in 2.8.x).

When I switch from a project to another from QGIS Web Client, when it
calls the qgis server (WMS GetProjectSettings) I have a segmentation
fault as you can see in the below GDB backtrace. It seems that it's a
problem in QgsServerProjectParser that didn't exist in 2.8.x.

This problem occurs when I switch from a big project to another, with
inherited layers from other projects.

Dear list,

In a polygon shapefile I'm seeing inconstistent behaviour in virtual 
fields. The attached project and shapefile has reduced it to it's 
simplest form: the shapefile contains two virtual fields, the first one 
containing the expression 1 (integer) and the second the expression 2 
(integer). However, when I want to edit the expression for the fields, 
the first field does not give a problem. For the second field I click on 
the 'expression' to open the expression builder, but the expression 
shown in the expression builder equals 1. I have not been able to find 
any pattern in when it happens/for what type of expressions. This 
example is the most simple form of the unexpected behaviour, but I have 
seen it with more complicated expressions as well. Sometimes after 
trying to edit one of these 'erratic' expressions QGIS closes with a 
minidump being written error message. Again, not always.

Anyone have any idea why this might happen and how to work around it?

Looking forward to some thoughts...
Janneke

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing - current status of "in-between" layers
	while running models
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO5FxApHaTGQqsksf-Z4j3nz1Focg0zCrGaB9UWjX43Jcg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all !

I was wondering what was the current status for layers created as ouput of
algs and used as input in child algs ? I remember reading some new feature
in this area, but I cannot remember what was the conclusion. Is there some
options allowing to do the following :

* use memory layers for all intermediate layers -> could be very fast, but
there should be some way to prevent bloating the computer if the input data
is too big ( the user would prefer to avoid memory layer if it leads to
swap )

* use a unique spatialite database to store the intermediate layers. In
this case
  - create automatically spatial indexes ( it is fast )
  - use rasterlite to store raster layers ? Or use a kind of foreign data
wrapper for sqlite ?

* For both options, obviously keep the long field names along the process,
and the complex data types ( and do not restrict to the 4 datatypes
available in DBF )

* I am aware that the use of Grass or other rich algs provider (Saga,
Taudem) can lead to using their internal format. What are the possibilities
and limits in this case ? For example for vector, Grass needs to import the
data, but what about for raster like GeoTiffs ?

Thanks in advance for your sharing your opinions and knowledge on this.

Regards,
Michaël

better keep on using r.external wrapper here.
all the best.

I hope this isn't irrelevant, but I wonder if change here might help me with
an issue I've had with using processing algorithms in sequence in Python. I
never got any answer to my SE question
(http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/175952/pyqgis-save-raster-as-rendered-image-then-use-gdal-tools-on-it),
and I've never been able to solve the problem.

If file-locking is the cause of the problem, moving to either memory layers
or Spatialite could potentially solve this. But I could be completely wrong.

I started with a new project, added the tst shapefile again, repeated 
the process of adding the virtual fields. The problem persists. Am I 
overlooking something?
Thanks for your help!

Hi Janneke,

Your build is a bit older than Matthias fix - please try again with 
tomorrow's nightly build or compile yourself.

Matthias fix is at 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/c0214bc30148b7da272917d73afc1820b78c1d3e 
(7h ago) - your build is 22h old.

Greetings,
Andreas

Hi Richard,

Seems your binaries try to pick up something related to Qt4 (suspects
are qwt, qca and qscintilla).
Are you sure you did "cmake -DENABLE_QT5=ON" in an empty build folder?
Once a folder is configured for either Qt5 or Qt4, this cannot be
changed later on.

Some comments also inside

There's a lot of python2 and qt4 stuff left in the above list. I'd
uninstall all of this.
Then you'll probably get cmake warnings telling you what's missing
(hint: qwt, qca and qscintilla are installed in their qt4 incarnation,
look for their qt5 equivalents).

Uninstalling is only for debugging purposes. Once you have it up and
running you can also reinstall all of this and make a second build
directory for Qt4, you can have both on the same system (I do).

If you have to specify libraries manually, that should make you
suspicious ;-)

Ah thanks for the answer.

Yes, I'm pretty sure I have -DENABLE_QT5=ON, though I use ccmake. I also
tried cmake now (see below for full command + output used).

But crux indeed is that for qca and libqwt, that apparently not have
install candidates in a clean Debian Stable. See below for current
status of those in different Debians.

Next try will then be on compiling on Debian testing...
Not sure if Bas knows if there is a chance that those qt5 version will
come into Jessie. But I understand Jurgen also has been busy to create
packages for the time (Qt4-)Webkit is removed from repo's. So for normal
installation there is a solution too.

My point is I just try to be able to compile/install/test from source on
a (if possible) vanilla Debian (be it Jessie or Wheezy is both ok for me).

So: testing/Wheezy will be next for me!

Regards & Thanks for putting time into all this,

Richard

Hi Andreas and Mathias,
Tried it again this morning, and indeed, it works!
Thanks a lot for the quick solution!

The Qt packages are highly unlikely to be backported to jessie.

For the qt5 build of the Debian package maintained by the Debian GIS 
team, I'm using the Python 2 dependencies for Qt5 which seem to work 
quite nicely.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] is it possible to use virtual fields that depend
 on other virtual fields for styling and labeling?
Message-ID: <573B248A.8070809@gmail.com>

Dear list,

First, I'm not sure this is a question for the user list or the 
developer list so I send it to both.

In the attached project with test shapefile I have a shapefile with 
three virtual fields (integers). The first two virtual fields (vTest and 
vTest2) contain expressions to assign integers, the third virtual field 
(vTest3) multiplies the values of vTest and vTest2. I can use vTest and 
vTest2 in Styles and in Labels, but not vTest3. In styles it will not 
categorise, and the labels will just not show in the map. The values 
show correctly in the attribute table and with the information tool.

Is it a bug? Does anyone else have this issue? I'm using today's nightly 
build on Windows 7. As a work around I can create a non virtual field 
and use the field calculator to set the values to the values in vTest3.

kind regards,
Janneke

Personally I'm ok with moving to rst / docs with the following arguments:
- it can be translated
- it is easier searchable (google)
- it will hopefully kept uptodate by more people because they try the
instructions and report back

Only reason NOT doing it was because in an earlier hackfest (when I
already put them to rst), I thought Juergen told me something about
scripts which kept the files uptodate.

IF only the apt-get lines are truely updated in that way, I'm ok with
moving.

Plz others speak out.

Regards,

Richard

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR9_iNsSPrB4-2MsEXREVCHbEBMRcnGfSvzekCECeAH0Yw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to backport the following commit to the release-2_14 branch
(adds compatibility for some GPS units in mobile devices):
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/88bddb8

The issue is that it has been classified as both a bug fix and a feature:
Bug report: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13330
Feature request: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12980
Feature PR: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2867

Any objections to backporting it?

IMO bug fix as it can stop some new GPS working correctly.

Hi


After rereading the thread I think I am +1 for moving to RST in the QGIS Docs repo with the following thinking:

* all the good stuff Junior mentioned like translatability, visibility etc.
* when we hit release freeze we could copy the latest output from sphinx (maybe generated as plain text file?) to INSTALL.txt and remove the sources for the install docs from the QGIS code tree. That way the QGIS sources always contain the current notes for that release and the doc sources contain only the most recent procedure.
* we could add a note in the docs sources saying ‘these instructions are for the current state of the develop branch only, for version specific install procedures, please see the INSTALL.txt in the source tree for that release’

I think that workflow is not too much different from the current system. Of course someone needs to volunteer to get all the processes above into place :-P

@Jürgen regarding your comments below, I used to use apt-get build-dep too but I actually like the explicit package list your script generates more in some ways because it is deterministic compared to build-dep which will only reflect the deps from the current latest package in apt sources.

Regards


Tim

The dependencies of the latest automatic nightly are probably more up-to-date
than the list from the latest manual INSTALL update run.

* QGIS Website is always translatable, so can easily show the most recent
procedure in different languages. It also provides a chapter on development
steps, might be worth having this beside.
* Using website, we have a unique hyperlink (to use in our communication if
needed) instead of having to update it after each released doc
* testing doc (which in the ideal world, is related to master) is not to be
translated
* not all QGIS versions are/will be documented: the last doc provided is
2.8. The next should be 2.14 (btw, still looking for volunteers to write it
- around 80 issues remaining and not the least) but when will be the
release?

It's the content on April 15th. Don't however know the steps to keep this
up to date nor automate some changes (like date of doc).

I fixed that today in bbaef371. The code which should close the map
was commented, which resulted in keeping the file open and
impossibility to delete the vector on Windows. Please test with the
next build.

There was a comment about possible dead-lock, so please pay attention
to possible freeze when a GRASS vector is deleted and fill a new bug
in such case. I hope it is OK however.

Agreed. Also my reasoning for the backport, since 2.14 will be the LTR.

Devs, if there are no objections, I'd like to backport this by the end of
the week.

I'm ok with both, but personally think docs is better, because
compilation instructions are docs, and not website :-)
But I agree with your points too.

Next docs release is when doc writers decide it is enough :-)
At that time I branch a new '2.14' and create the translation files and
push them to transifex.
Maybe try to finish after Girona? Ask as much people as possible to
help, pick the 'most important' issues first, and then just call it a
day (leave the other issues open)?

Hi
Since 2.14 it has not been possible to georeferencing an image.
There are a bugreport on the issue http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14551 with a priority: Blocker.
There is a comment •  Target version changed from Version 2.14 to Version 2.16
What does that mean?

The dependencies of the latest automatic nightly are probably more up-to-date
than the list from the latest manual INSTALL update run.

Hi Lene,

While I acknowledge that this is a bug and should be fixed - why do you 
have to use the projective method and not any of the other ones? In fact 
I never used the projective one, but either linear or helmert for raster 
content that is not distorted within the image or thin plate spline for 
raster content that needs a lot of control points and needs a lot of 
local adjusting.

What is the specific reason to use "projective" as opposed to the other 
methods?

Why the target was moved to 2.16 I don't know. 2.14 is a LT release and 
I think/hope that there will be several updates to 2.14 in the future. 
Or maybe it was meant that it will be fixed in 2.16 and then backported ...

Greetings,
Andreas

Using osgeo4w64 I installed several packages, there is no GRASS Plugin:

QGIS 2.15 nightly with grass 7.0.4

QGIS 2.14.2 nightly with grass 7.0.4

tried also to revert back to GRASS 7.0.3 but there is no GRASS Plugin;

so for this reason, sadly, i cannot test your patch Radim, i'll do ASAP.

### P.S.

I notice that this "GRASS Plugin not being present" issue

is quite annoying, so i wonder what is the policy of

osgeo4w package update/upgrade? Should we consider the

network installer a developer tool and use the sandalone installer

for QGIS regular use instead?

QGIS and GRASS along with GRASS Plugin have became powerful

tools and I understand that ***a lot*** of work is done by developers to

develop, maintain, package, document and release the software, **a lot 
of valuable work(!)**;

sadly IMHO this random behaviour does not give justice to all the good 
dev work.

I think a bit of well delivered information should make things better, 
something

like the LTS release policy, now we normal users know that we can rely 
on it to do

normal work, and we can use regular release to get the newest 
functionalities.

Thanks again, Roy.

AFAIK, there was no GRASS 64bit in OSGeo4W, thus no plugin in 64 bit
version. Try 32 bit build.

Hi, there is in fact GRASS 7.0.3 and 7.0.4 64 bit in OSGeo4W64
i'm indeed using QGIS 2.14.2 with GRASS 7.0.3, there is also
GRASS 7.0.4 but I reverted to GRASS 7.0.3 so that I can use
GRASS Plugin.

So with osgeo4w64, GRASS Plugin works with the current QGIS point 
release (2.14.2)
provided that you revert GRASS to 7.0.3, but it does not with nightly 
builds.

again I do not know what to do (somehow) ... should i stick with 32 bit ?
is OSGeo4W64 to be consitered unstable/experimental?

thanks, Roy.

No problem - as said more headaches with something else.

Feature freeze and release moved two weeks.   Tomorrows point releases kept.

Hi all,

Thanks Paolo and Tom for your interest in this topic !

Anyone has any idea about the current status : spatialite, memory, etc. (cf
my first email) ?
Sorry for answering again, but this is still not very clear for me.

Thanks in advance

Michaël

Basically, layers are generated in the default format supported by the
algorithm (that is, the first one in the list returned by
getSupportedOutputVectorLayerExtensions() from the corresponding
provider)

Forcing a format for all intermediate layer will have some advantages,
but also some drawbacks (for instance, if chaining 2 SAGA raster
algorithms, using any format other than the default SAGA sdat will
involve extra conversions)

The issue with the attribute names can be fixed if the defautl format
for native qgis algorithms is switched to someting like geopackage (i
think this wont have any side effect), but it wont help if using an
external tool like SAGA, since SAGA requires shapefiles.

Not sure that solves that question. Let me know if you want more
detail about this. I will be glad to discuss this in detail if you are
coming to Girona. Ideas and feedback are of course welcome

Cheers

In fact, it would be good to avoid exporting and reimporting files as
much as possible. This is an especially serious problem for GRASS algs,
where import can take longer than the actual analysis.

See you in Girona soon.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Fix cpt-city color ramps?
Message-ID: <573ECAC0.3050103@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I think we could improve the UX for creating new colour ramps by:
* setting the default to cpt-city instead of the gradient
* renaming cpt-city (it is nice to pay tribute to the original creator
of the set, but the name is not understandable for users)
* possibly removing other options (I think they are mostly included in
cpt-city, e.g. ColorBrewer).
It would be an easy fix, and IMHO it would streamline the user experience.
Opinions?
All the best.

I was looking to the new virtual layer function and found
a possible bug:

Load a shapefile (or a spatialite layer or a postgis layer)
make a virtual layer ( select * from layer_name)
browsing layers in DBManager ( table, preview) will
remove layers from the Layer Panel (crearly an unwanted behaviour) 
corrupting the project
also QGIS will ultimately hang

Thanks, Roy.

Expected. They are exposed as virtual layers so you can query them

Hi all,
I'll arrive 23.5 at 22.50 at the Girona airport. Most participants did not
indicate their arrival time[0]. It would be good if we could share a
taxi to reach the Monastery: anyone available around that time?
All the best, and see you soon.

Moreover, reinstalling 2.14 is impossible, because gdal-abi-2-0-2 is
missing (gdal-abi-2-1-0 is available instead on sid, the usual moving
target issue).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Removing overlap creates records with NULL geom
Message-ID: <573EE312.7090300@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
when digitizing with the Avoid intersection function, if a new polygon
is completely contained in an older one, a record with a NULL geometry
is created. I'm not sure this is a good idea, maybe better to remove the
record and/or warn the user?
All the best, and thanks.

Launching with gdb (apt-get install gdb) and getting a stacktrace might help 
understanding where the issue is

$ gdb qgis
run
(and when it crashes) bt

and/or with Valgrind (apt-get install valgrind)

$ valgrind qgis

Thanks Nathan,

so I understand that regular layers have to be exposed
(at database level i guess ...) but I think they should not be
listed as virtual layers, it's confusing.
I don't know maybe if it's difficult to hide them, but
*they are not virtual layers*.
Just my 2c feedback, Roy.

Hi Paolo

Both autotrace plugin and tracing functionality since 2.14 should work
fine... not sure which one you are referring to - and what is the
snapping configuration you have used.

Hi Andreas,
I have always used the projective… and didn´t try out the others…
The Linear gives in my project a huge error too, but the Linear works fine
Thanks!!!

Emne: Re: [Qgis-developer] georeferencer projective transformation in 2.14

Hi Lene,

While I acknowledge that this is a bug and should be fixed - why do you have to use the projective method and not any of the other ones? In fact I never used the projective one, but either linear or helmert for raster content that is not distorted within the image or thin plate spline for raster content that needs a lot of control points and needs a lot of local adjusting.

What is the specific reason to use "projective" as opposed to the other methods?

Why the target was moved to 2.16 I don't know. 2.14 is a LT release and I think/hope that there will be several updates to 2.14 in the future. Or maybe it was meant that it will be fixed in 2.16 and then backported ...

Greetings,
Andreas

Since 2.14 it has not been possible to georeferencing an image.
There are a bugreport on the issue http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14551 with a priority: Blocker.
There is a comment •  Target version changed from Version 2.14 to Version 2.16
What does that mean?

Hi


After rereading the thread I think I am +1 for moving to RST in the QGIS Docs repo with the following thinking:

Is the Doc repo a better candidate for this (if we get the go!) than QGIS website?

Sorry yes, you are correct, the Web site is the better place.

Regards

Tim




* QGIS Website is always translatable, so can easily show the most recent procedure in different languages. It also provides a chapter on development steps, might be worth having this beside.
* Using website, we have a unique hyperlink (to use in our communication if needed) instead of having to update it after each released doc
* testing doc (which in the ideal world, is related to master) is not to be translated
* not all QGIS versions are/will be documented: the last doc provided is 2.8. The next should be 2.14 (btw, still looking for volunteers to write it - around 80 issues remaining and not the least) but when will be the release?


* all the good stuff Junior mentioned like translatability, visibility etc.
* when we hit release freeze we could copy the latest output from sphinx (maybe generated as plain text file?) to INSTALL.txt and remove the sources for the install docs from the QGIS code tree. That way the QGIS sources always contain the current notes for that release and the doc sources contain only the most recent procedure.
* we could add a note in the docs sources saying ‘these instructions are for the current state of the develop branch only, for version specific install procedures, please see the INSTALL.txt in the source tree for that release’

+1 though the copy would be from the website repo (as suggested above)

I think that workflow is not too much different from the current system. Of course someone needs to volunteer to get all the processes above into place :-P

I'd RSTed the install doc and opened a pull request at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/343/files. Might need correction. It's the content on April 15th. Don't however know the steps to keep this up to date nor automate some changes (like date of doc).

The dependencies of the latest automatic nightly are probably more up-to-date
than the list from the latest manual INSTALL update run.

This is what I did:
* load a polygon layer
* set the snapping options to 10 pixel, vertex only
* start editing
* click on Enable tracing
* click on Add feature
* first click outside current polygons, second close to it (I see the
pink cross indicating snap)
* I move close to the border, but no polygon is traced.
All the best.

Hi Andreas,
I have always used the projective… and didn´t try out the others…
The Linear gives in my project a huge error too, but the Linear works fine
Thanks!!!

Emne: Re: [Qgis-developer] georeferencer projective transformation in 2.14

Hi Lene,

While I acknowledge that this is a bug and should be fixed - why do you have to use the projective method and not any of the other ones? In fact I never used the projective one, but either linear or helmert for raster content that is not distorted within the image or thin plate spline for raster content that needs a lot of control points and needs a lot of local adjusting.

What is the specific reason to use "projective" as opposed to the other methods?

Why the target was moved to 2.16 I don't know. 2.14 is a LT release and I think/hope that there will be several updates to 2.14 in the future. Or maybe it was meant that it will be fixed in 2.16 and then backported ...

Greetings,
Andreas

Since 2.14 it has not been possible to georeferencing an image.
There are a bugreport on the issue http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14551 with a priority: Blocker.
There is a comment •  Target version changed from Version 2.14 to Version 2.16
What does that mean?

Hi


After rereading the thread I think I am +1 for moving to RST in the QGIS Docs repo with the following thinking:

Is the Doc repo a better candidate for this (if we get the go!) than QGIS website?

Sorry yes, you are correct, the Web site is the better place.

Regards

Tim



* QGIS Website is always translatable, so can easily show the most recent procedure in different languages. It also provides a chapter on development steps, might be worth having this beside.
* Using website, we have a unique hyperlink (to use in our communication if needed) instead of having to update it after each released doc
* testing doc (which in the ideal world, is related to master) is not to be translated
* not all QGIS versions are/will be documented: the last doc provided is 2.8. The next should be 2.14 (btw, still looking for volunteers to write it - around 80 issues remaining and not the least) but when will be the release?


* all the good stuff Junior mentioned like translatability, visibility etc.
* when we hit release freeze we could copy the latest output from sphinx (maybe generated as plain text file?) to INSTALL.txt and remove the sources for the install docs from the QGIS code tree. That way the QGIS sources always contain the current notes for that release and the doc sources contain only the most recent procedure.
* we could add a note in the docs sources saying ‘these instructions are for the current state of the develop branch only, for version specific install procedures, please see the INSTALL.txt in the source tree for that release’

+1 though the copy would be from the website repo (as suggested above)

I think that workflow is not too much different from the current system. Of course someone needs to volunteer to get all the processes above into place :-P

I'd RSTed the install doc and opened a pull request at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/343/files. Might need correction. It's the content on April 15th. Don't however know the steps to keep this up to date nor automate some changes (like date of doc).

Harrissou

Hi,
Paolo, afaics, you need from time to time to click to confirm the shape of
the polygon. The autotrace shows you, according to your mouse position
(near a snappable node) what your poygon will look like, following the
shortest path; it doesn't really draw it unless you click.
For what i've experienced, the tracing helps you save a lot of common nodes
click (Thank you, Martin) but you still need to click from time to time to
make human choice.

Lene, the direction is where your mouse goes. If the autotrace doesn't
really goes where you want (because it's not obviously the shortest one for
it) then you need to create an intermediate node where direction should
change.
Maybe, mixing it with the Advanced digitizing panel can help you force
direction however. Never tried.

Regards,
Harrissou

Thanks Harrissou. The point is that the digitized polygon in my case
never follows the border of an existing one. Maybe I'm missing something
obvious here.
All the best.

Ok i'm testing OSGeo4W in 32 bit virtual machine, GRASS Plugin is not

Message-ID: <8CB03684-83EF-47B9-871E-66F967F03ED5@linz.govt.nz>

Hi All,

QGIS is now starting to support GDAL 2.X capabilities in a few places (e.g Curve geometries, 64bit integers, better Geopackage creation). Windows QGIS 2.14 is now shipping with GDAL 2.0, however MacOSX builds, both release and nightly dev builds, are still shipping with only GDAL 1.11. Are there plans to upgrade the MacOSX GDAL framework anytime soon?

Cheers
Jeremy

Hei Paolo,

In fact, it would be good to avoid exporting and reimporting files as much as possible. This is an especially serious problem for GRASS algs, where import can take longer than the actual analysis.

See you in Girona soon.

Hi,
Even though
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/getting_started.html#command-line-options
first sentence lets think that launching QGIS with command line tools is
only available on Linux, this seems also possible on Windows (at least).
While I'm able to execute some commands like:
* qgis
* qgis --noplugins
* qgis --lang it
...
I'm unable to get any result using qgis --help.
Any reason?

Thanks,
Harrissou

Hi,


A short update on porting plugins, python 3 and qt5. Today I had success
with running the processing tests on a py3/qt5 build. For the qgis
algorithms for which tests exist, there was just one single small
difference, where the py3/qt5 version offered an increased precision in
some statistics. Apart from this, everything (what is tested) works fine.


This is very good news. The py3/qt5 version of the plugin is produced by
the 2to3 update script and the update script therefore is doing a quite
good job already if it's able to migrate a complex plugin like processing.


Apart from this, it is yet another set of tests that prevents us from
introducing regressions while working on and updating the (python) API
in the migration process.


I'm looking forward to seeing more processing tests being introduced to
guarantee for a smooth transition.


All the best

Awesome!!

Definitely, having a good test suite will help with that. Maybe that
should be one of our work priorities for the hackfest.

Great work!

ggod idea; r.external is already used instead of import, using it also
for export will make things smoother

> Does not help for vector data, though...

yes, the main problem is with vectors: v.external only supports a
limited set of commands (those not requiring topology), so reverting to
real import is generally necessary, and that's the time consuming step.
ideally, Processing should check the command sequence in a model, and
avoid export/import when two consecutive commands are from the same
software, particularly GRASS.
All the best, and thanks.

Have you tried to use some other layers? I can imagine there could be
a problem if the geometries are invalid... Anyway I am happy to have a
look at it in Girona if the problem persists.

have a (small) rental car and could squeeze 1 (or 2 with little luggage)
peeps on the backseats for the drive to Girona. Private email me if

But that’s not what the MacOSX offical (http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis) or nightly snapshot (http://qgis.dakotacarto.com/) use.

No.  The grass plugin is include in qgis-dev.

	Calculator
Message-ID: <de1c8e0c71850db6971eba46e6e4164f@xs4all.nl>

I have a start-datetime (string) and a an end-datetime (string) in the 
attributes of my vector data.

I can use the  to_datetime(str) function in the Field Calculator to 
create DateTime objects from these.

But now it would be cool to check the time-difference between those two 
(called timespan?).
I did not find a function for those...

Any hints?

If I did not miss something, I think there is not even a Qt function for 
this...

A function to add could be: 'to_timemillies', then the user could create 
timemillies from the DateTime-objects, and do some calculation on those 
him/herself...

Would that be usefull?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Use the age() function. That takes two datetimes and returns an
interval length between them. You can extract the
seconds/minutes/hours/etc from an interval type using the seconds(),
minutes(), ... etc functions.

Hope that helps!

Correct, though I manage both the nightly build and OSGeo4Mac. However,
pretty soon, like shortly after the upcoming QGIS hackfest in Girona, the
nightly build will drastically change to multiple versions that not only
support GDAL/OGR v2, but also variants of Qt 4/5 and Python 2/3, and all
based upon Homebrew formulae (specifically those currently in OSGeo4Mac).

This is to aid migration of core code and third-party plugins to QGIS 3.0.

Of note, the OSGeo4Mac project will also be morphing into an installer
project, while its Homebrew formulae are migrated to the new Homebrew
Geospatial tap (repo) [0]. This will allow for using Homebrew Geospatial as
the basis for creating an new type of package installer for Mac. Whether it
becomes an 'official' QGIS package remains to be seen. First it needs to
become stable.

Message-ID: <CAKWoFMJKJ+pUE3-gh8Nh-HWeEqW2T57ChhmCpF1OF7QaNsKxgA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

When creating a new relation between two layers in project settings I
accidentally pressed enter after giving just a name of the relation. QGIS
crashed and I got the minidump window.

Can you confirm?

I think the OK button should be disabled until all needed parameters are
given.


I filed a bug http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14869


Thanks,

Lauri

Hi Lauri, 

I had the same just recently. I would also appreciate if QGIS would not
crash in this situation. Can you please provide a bug report? 

Thanks,

I know that a QGIS plugin has to be open-source for the plugin to be included
in the QGIS plugins repo. However, are there any further
requirements/limitations on which open-source licence to choose for plugins?
I was leaning towards MIT, but Riccardo (author of qgis2leaf) rightly
suggested that I clarify if there is any position from QGIS on this?

Thanks

Tom

Hi Tom,
we do not ahve any special position; we stick to the original licence
(GPL2), so if in your plugin you import qgis, the plugin must have the
same licence. So in our case MIT is not an option.
All the best.

Hi Tom,

QGIS is GPLv2+
A a Python import is considered being equivalent to a dynamic link, it
triggers the "share-alike" clause of the GPL.
Therefore all QGIS plugins must be licenced as GPLv2+ if they are
distributed.

Vincent

FYI - as of https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/8ddcf76 you can now
just directly calculate date/time/datetime differences using "-", eg

to_date('2016-03-04')-to_date('2016-03-01')

This will return an interval object which you can then use seconds(),
minute(), etc on.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ownership of QgsMessageBar(-items)
Message-ID: <0bb667045e8dfae9004368faf982e88e@xs4all.nl>


Busy with a plugin which retrieves (in separate threads) a lot of data 
from 2 w*s services.

I thought to use the QgsMessageBar to show progress of the (two) 
download processes, but stumbled on (I think) a problem:

- from api docs: https://qgis.org/api/classQgsMessageBar.html#details
The message bar will take ownership of the item...

My problem now is that (I think) my progressbars (which were place in a 
QgsMessageBar-item-widget) are sometimes deleted although I still want 
to use them...

For example: an user can click the little 'x' button in the messagebar 
to clean up all messages.
Or a python dev can call 'clean all widgets'.

BUT at that moment a progressbar part of a messagebaritem is (at least 
in cpp world) apparently deleted.
Meaning, if (in the python world) I set a progress value on it, I get a 
nice clean segmentation fault....

I managed to work around this by NOT putting the progress bars in the 
messagebar (but put small ones in the plugin toolbar), but as several 
examples flow around on Google, I thought to speak out.

Should we just not let people do this?

Or was I using the messagebar for things I was not supposed to use if 
for?

Or should we make an option to add a 'special' widget to the messagebar, 
which is NOT removed using clearWidgets() (either via Python or via 
x-button)?

Regards,

Richard

Hi all,

I'm having trouble using the parameter:
## crs

in my rscripts. I always get an error message when I includ this parameter
in my rscripts. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04, Qgis 2.8.9-Wien and Python 2.7.6.
I'm sendin the error message attached.

Any help would be really appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

I use message bars in theads there and never had issues.

maybe it helps.

Marco - interesting stuff! Have you seen this PR yet?
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3004

Looks like we share some common implementation details, so I'd be keen
to hear your thoughts on that proposed design.

IMO I don't think this is the right use case for the message bar and could
see the user getting overwhelmed quickly.

Is there another place these.  Even consider adding something to the status
bar if you have to but not into the message bar.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Processing][Rscript] Use Extent Parameter
Message-ID: <574459E5.2030100@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

Has someone already created a Rscript for processing which use an extent 
in input parameters ?

By reading the code, I understand that extent parameter is not set in 
the RScript.
In the method 'getImportCommands' of the 'RAlgorithm' class, 
ParameterExtent is never transform to an R command.
Can someone confirm it ?

How to pass translate ParameterExtent to RScript ?

         # Try to install packages if needed
         if isWindows():
             commands.append('.libPaths(\"' + 
unicode(RUtils.RLibs()).replace('\\', '/') + '\")')
         packages = RUtils.getRequiredPackages(self.script)
         packages.extend(['rgdal', 'raster'])
         for p in packages:
             commands.append('tryCatch(find.package("' + p

install.packages("' + p
                             + '", dependencies=TRUE))')
         commands.append('library("raster")')
         commands.append('library("rgdal")')

         for param in self.parameters:
             if isinstance(param, ParameterRaster):
                 value = param.value
                 value = value.replace('\\', '/')
                 if self.passFileNames:
                     commands.append(param.name + ' = "' + value + '"')
                 elif self.useRasterPackage:

Hi René-Luc,

extent and some other parameters/outputs currently are not available
in modeler and scripts. I plan to add support for missed params/outputs
at hackfest.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Set plugin minimum QGIS version to LTR?
Message-ID: <1464111466408-5268032.post@n6.nabble.com>

My plugin works with QGIS 2.4. Despite that, is it worth setting it to
minimum 2.8 to align with the idea of the LTR? If so, is this idea worth
extending to, for example, the default minimum version set in the plugin
builder?

Hi Tom,
I don't see a practical advantage in this. Maybe I'm missing something?
All the best.

Hi Paolo

The idea is to add more encouragement for users to upgrade to LTR if they
are lagging. It could have an effect if more plugins did this. 

Thanks

Tom

Message-ID: <005701d1b627$aba96440$02fc2cc0$@realtimetech.co.kr>

Dear QGIS-Developer.

 

Hello. My name is Sung-Hoon Jung.

I’m team manager at Realtimetech company in South Korea.

 

We have Spatial DBMS called ‘Kairos Spatial’.
(http://www.realtimetech.co.kr)

Now, we are trying to link the Kairos Spatial and your QGIS like PostGIS or
Oracle Spatial.

However, the task is too difficult works.

Can we linked to QGIS our own work? I’m worried about it.

Or, Can you provide a guideline to the linkage?

 

If, you can this task, I will provide all our product information.

I’m sorry to ask you to work hard.

 

Please send your reply.

 

Thank you.

This is an open source project mostly driven by either volunteer work or
via sponsored development. It's very unlikely someone will do this work for
you for free, so your options are either to do it yourself or find a
commercial QGIS supporter to implement it for you (see
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/commercial_support.html)

If you're wanting to develop this yourself, then have a look at:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/5fe19c5f15c7ffd9a5b83f9db9060ef0aac3afa1

You'd need to make similar changes, implementing a new vector data provider
for your database.

If you want it to be merged into the QGIS codebase you'll need to make sure
it's done under the same license as QGIS, gplv2 or later.

Of course, since qgis2web is middleware, its licence also has to be
compatible with Leaflet, Openlayers 3, and their respective plugins, none of
which are GPL. Since the plugin bundles and distributes these libraries, I
would say complying with their licences is of greater importance than
complying with QGIS, which is not distributed with the plugin.

Not trying to start an argument - I just want to do the right thing by the
creators of all the software on which mine is built.

I'm sure you have much choice when it gets to GPL. Your plugin is still GPL
regardless. It does get a bit slippery once you include other libraries but
I think it's fine in this case.  They are all open source so no harm
really.

Same as use using GDAL with it being MIT

I may be wrong, but if qgis2web is like qgis2three, it generates
projects containing OL3 or leaflet code ?
In this case, there is no code link between the Python plugin and
Leaflet nor OL3, and therefore no compatibility problem. You can keep
the original licences for these libraries and their respective plugins.

But the Python code for your plugin has to be GPLv2 as soon as you do an
"import qgis.core" and you distribute the plugin.

Furthermore, since OL3 and LeafLet are BSD-licenced, there actually is
no issue since this licence is compatible with GPL. You can link GPL
code to MIT or BSD without problem.

Yes, this is how it works. However, the code it generates *does* link to the
other libraries in code. I think it would therefore be egregious to say no
link exists between the Python code and the third-party JS libraries. Also,
as I say, qgis2web redistributes those other libraries.

I appreciate that, as you say, the other libs are largely licensed more
permissively, and compatibly with QGIS - MIT/two-clause BSD.

I guess I am just sceptical that GPL's requirement for GPL licensing of a
product, purely by virtue of importing the first product as a library, is
likely to hold much legal weight.

Anyway, to clarify, the advice is that GPLv2+ is the only acceptable licence
- not even v3+?

Thanks for your patience and opinions

Tom

We asked for legal advice, and that was the official response.

That is one of the main things with GPL and why a lot of people do tend to
avoid it I guess.  Not much we can do for it now all plugins are GPL.

Hi,
Can we have a page on the website explaining the licensing of plugins and the reasons behind it?

We have come across a couple of plugins all with pyc and no code provided to the end users. 

I understand at the beginning the GPL licensing of the plugins was not enforced as it potentially discourages the uptake of QGIS amongst uniformed users/organisations. But I think it is the right time to have a clear guideline on that before things get out of hand.

Cheers,
Saber

<my ow opinion, not pretending this is the project one>

Technically you could licence the plugin with any license you want, but as 
soon you execute it against QGIS, it must be compatible of GPL v2+, since it 
is a derived work of QGIS GPLv2 code, and thus it must convey the same rights 
and obligations offered and constrained by the GPLv2 license.
So you could also licence it under X/MIT, BSD 2/3 clauses or which ever other 
free licences that are compatible with GPLv2+.
It cannot be under a proprietary license, because GPLv2 would impose to have 
access to the source code.

The only cases where it makes sense in practice to have a plugin under a 
permissive license are :
- imagine that someone would reimplement a QGIS alternative that would have 
the same API as QGIS but would be more permissively licensed, then it could 
make sense to have your plugin under that permissive license.
- a more reasonable use case would be a plugin that would be compatible of 
QGIS and another proprietary GIS through some abstraction layer of their 
different APIs. The core of your plugin could then be permissively licensed to 
be compatible of both licensing models.

Apologies Tom, my comment was a reference to a discussion a number of years ago when the same topic was raised.

Not sure the answer to your question about licensing of your plugin. In your case, you are still making the source code available. The ones I have in mind are distributing the closed source version of their plugins.

Cheers,
Saber

Actually this point is quite interesting since for example NVidia claims that 
their proprietary code for their video drivers is not a derived work of the 
Linux kernel since it is used in the drivers of other OS. So only the 
adaptation layer between their generic driver and the Linux kernel is GPL. 
This is of course a much disputable point of view, but nobody has cared enough 
to challenge NVidia in front of a court. What it shows is that the concept of 
what is a derived work or not can be somewhat fuzzy.

I do agree with this analysis.

Note that as for the Nvidia case mentionned, the Linux kernel has an
exception to GPL for proprietary modules. Not sure it plays a role on
the issue you mentionned, but it may be a strong difference with other
software which do not have this exception.

The term "link" is very subtle, and is key to the issue here. There is
absolutely no "link" in the sense of the GPL between your Python module
and the code you generate. The generated code can be considered as data
for your plugin ( template, replacement values).

For compiled code, the definition of a link is quite easy, and much more
complicated for script languages. The Plone project has done a deep
analysis some time ago and concluded that a "import" in Python is
considered a link in the sense of the GPL.

A grey area would be for example if you were using a QWebEngine
component in your Python Plugin, directly calling javascript functions
of the Javascript library from your Python code.
In that case I really do not know if it would be considered a link in
the GPL sense.

But for your use case with code generation it is really clear.

No problem neither, keep them with the original licence.

Yes, this leads to much lesser complications.

As even noted, you could use a more permissive licence ( MIT, BSD ), but
the real use cases are rare.
As for using GPLv3 ( or later, which is the same right now ), it is more
complicated. QGIS being GPLv2+, it would be compatible. But you would
not be allowed to distribute that package ( QGIS & your GPLv3 plugin)
with any other piece of software which would be GPLv2 only, as GPLv2 and
GPLv3 are not compatible. Bad idea therefore.

Usual disclaimer : I'm not a lawyer, but still studied these issues a lot.

A QWebView is used in the GUI as a preview window, and loads in the
libraries. So it directly uses them, in that the generated output JS is
loaded by Python into the QWebView. That sounds potentially like a "link" to
me (apologies for not thinking of that before - I didn't appreciate its
relevance).

I would say that while you just load the HTML in a QWebView, this is not
a link : the embedded web client loads the HTML file and interprets it,
independently of your code. I'd say you are still safe here, and I would
still consider the generated pages as data for from your plugin point of
view.

If you would call a javascript function from Python through a direct
code binding I would say it may be considered a link. But this is my own
personal interpretation. This is where we enter a grey zone, and I do
not have any online resource to point to in this case.
If you want to know more on this, I know some IP lawyers specialized in
OpenSource who may help.

For me your use case is still safe and non-binding. Furthermore, it is
pretty common with all softwares loading HTML documentation from within
an embedded browser, and I have never seen any licence trouble arising
with this.

Vincent

Are you really sure of that ? If that was the case there would not be all 
those debates regarding whether proprietary kernel modules are allowed or not.

My understanding of 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#Loadable_kernel_modules is that all 
the subtelty resides in whether a module is a derived work of another one. 
There's no special explicit exception. The folks that put proprietary modules 
say they are not derived works from the kernel, hence not bound to GPL.

Another thing to keep in mind is that PyQt is also GPLv2.
Therefore if you want to make any call to PyQt, you would also have to
do the same work of having an abstraction layer on top of it, which
would be a pain.
This use case therefore makes less sense when you base your work on
PyQt. Or you have to buy a commercial licence from Riverbank for PyQt.

Using PySide to ease licence issues in this case may be something we
would have to think about, now that there will be support for it again.

Programmers focus on link, but it's really not the point.  The question
in copyright law is "derived work" or "a work based on the program".  So
the typical view among hard-core licensing nerds is that the source of a
plugin -- because it is fundamentally an extension to the main program
-- is a derived work.  Thus one needs permission from the original
copyright holders to distribute it.  The GPL only grants such permission
if the plugin is licensed under the GPL.

As to being derived works of multiple things at once, yes, that may well
be true.  One needs permission from all.  That doesn't mean matching
license.  It means that given the plugin license, the copyright holders

Implemented the solution with disabling the ok button until all required
fields are there.

Can you check and give a feedback?

If it's ok, I'll backport to 2.14

It took longer than expected, because the Qt maintainers were waiting
for QGIS to move away from its reliance on WebKit in Qt4.

Because that wasn't going to happen before the WebKit support was
actually no longer available, I asked the Qt maintainers to stop waiting
for QGIS and go ahead and break it with the python-qt4 upload initially
planned for earlier this year.

QGIS now shows lovely stacktraces informing the user about the missing
QtWebKit modules.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Is the plugin available as Open Source / GPL? If it is there is actually no reason (even if it is not very sympathetic with our community norms and values) that I can think of why a company can’t do this. Though I guess circumventing their key restriction would then be trivia?

Hi Paolo,

Is this in our main public plugin repository?

I think we shouldn't have such plugins in our main repository. If it is 
in a private repository, there is not much we can do, probably.

As far as I understood the recent plugin licensing discussion on this 
list a plugin importing qgis.core or qgis.gui (or OS-pyQt) needs to be 
licenced compatible to GPL2, so even in a private repository a plugin 
author cannot claim a plugin to be for private use only(?). One could of 
course publish a limited-use plugin under GPL and sell the full blown 
plugin, but as it has to be GPL, too, after some sales it might be 
available for download somewhere.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

Bernhard

Reading the description on their github page, I think the "private use"
clause refers to the poi data that the plugin downloads. In that sense,
it's not much different from plugins that fetch tiles with different
licenses

Best wishes

Good news !
Do you have a Vagrant file we could use (and publish) to generate the VM
directly ?

I have not seen any release announcements lately and my OS X packaging is way behind, 2.8.4 and 2.12.2.  I only noticed the 2.12.2 update when someone asked on the lists about a changelog for it and then someone emailed me asking about it.  Now someone is asking about 2.12.3, which I find was released 5/20 (according to the source zip date stamp), and when checking saw that LTR is now at 2.8.9.

What's going on?

Sorry, done by hand. The crucial point however is the list of packages;
with these it compiles, installs and run:

  apt-egt install git build-essential cmake flex bison pyqt5-dev
qttools5-dev qtpositioning5-dev libqt5svg5-dev libqt5webkit5-dev
libqt5gui5 libqt5scripttools5 qtscript5-dev libqca-qt5-2-dev grass-dev
libgeos-dev libgdal-dev libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev libqt5scintilla2-dev
pyqt5.qsci-dev python3-pyqt5.qsci libgsl-dev txt2tags libproj-dev
libqwt-qt5-dev libspatialindex-dev pyqt5-dev-tools qttools5-dev-tools
qt5-default python3-future python3-pyqt5.qtsql python3-psycopg2 python3-gdal

Processing and MetaSearch still give errors on load, probably another py
package or two are missing. If someone find them please report back.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS: do WMS and WFS providers use
 QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance()?
Message-ID: <1464348249072-5268513.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
The main goal is to access to WMS/WFS exposed  behind Shibboleth
authentication page.  
I made many tests and partially I have success with a workaround: not sure
but if I'm not wrong then I could signal a strange behaviour of wms provider
with QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance() 

The problem is complex, I try to shortly explain:

I need to load WMS/WFS layers that are exposed behind Shibboleth (SAML2)
authentication page.
>From a web browser, the authentication system consists of these steps: 
- call the url 
http://example/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities
- the system redirect to main authentication page https://secure/login.jsp 
with many options
- the user indicates a valid PKCS#12 certificate 
- only after success it redirect to the first url and the user could see the
wms response.

In QGIS 2.14.3 I imported certificate but when I try to load that WMS layer,
it shows an error: it expected wms capabilties response but it receive an
html from main authentication page.

Workaround:
Thus, to achieve the goal, I replicated in Python the authentication process
with a custom QWebView and extended QNetworkAccessManager with SSL support
to use certificate.
After succesfully access, the script dump cookies from the CookieJar and
transfers them to  QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance().
In that situation, the instance is authenticated and i can manually load
layers and Shibboleth trusts cookies. 

That workaround works fine for WFS , but it fails for WMS.

When i try to connect to WMS manually it have success and it shows a list of
capabilities , but when i select a layer and  i try to load it shows an
error: in error logs there are html tags from the main authentication page.
It seems that WMS provider uses QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance() only for
get capabilities but not for loading each layer.
 
Instead, the same solution works fine for WFS:  from the dialog that show
capabilities I can load a layer in QGIS and I assume that it uses
authenticated QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance().

That different behaviour of wms and wfs providers is correct?
It is a bug or I misunderstand something?

Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.
If necessary for details I will attach code snippet.

TIA

The dates for the releases are fixed [0].  Point releases are not announced

Hello,

One of our customer want this ticket to be done : 
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/14547
For myself, I agree that the actual behavior of layer tree groups is a 
little disappointing.

When I uncheck a layer group, I expect children to be hidden but not 
unchecked.
On the same way, when I check a layer group, I expect checked children 
to be shown, but not those who are'nt checked to be checked.

Does anyone have an opinion on this ?

Hi Enzo

AFAIK Shibboleth it's still not (still) supported by
AuthenticationManager, and Auth Manager have to be better integrated
in QgsConnectionManager class.

thanks for the workaroud, but a good procedure would be:

1) Create a Shibboleth authentication plugin for Auth Manager (in a
while will be available the single sign-on OAuth authentication).
Larry Shaffer by Boundless just did a proof of concept during these
days in Girona Hackfest that can be used as development base.

2) Support the complete integration of the AuthManager in
QgsNetworkAccessManager that would become THE way to use any
connection. Future QGIS will have PyQGIS access to AuthManager almost
removed to leave the auth access only managed by NetworkManager.
This integration will request a refactory of OWS providers that
actually use directly AuthManager (and also PostGis provider)

btw code snippets and use cases are always really useful :)

I'm just investigating how to integrate AuthManager and NetworkManager
(Qt) with Windows key store (Credential Management). If you have
suggestions are really welcome :)

regards
Luigi Pirelli

Ho!... I forgot to say that future removing of PyQGIS access to
AuthManager api would be removed to have a better security model in
QGIS. No one would be able to create a plugin to export qgis_auth.db
stored credentials or certificates.

Message-ID: <CAMCJChsgM=R6MpfQnyxjQeo90drqEe5G-8vCigC_VqXMRtUH2g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When I try to sort the columns in the attribute table, with qgis-rel-dev
2.14.3-5 (OSGeo4W 64 bits), nothing happens.

Doing the same with qgis 2.14.3-1 or qgis-dev 2.15.0-72, the sorting works
fine.

Can anyone confirm this behavior?

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Processing] Parameters and widgets refactoring
Message-ID: <57487CD4.5090601@camptocamp.com>


Here the idea to create some class to get processing UI more modular, 
flexible and more user friendly.

Actually in processing all parameter's widgets are hardcoded in 
ParametersPanel, depending on parameter types. This is not flexible to 
create custom parameters and related panels.
On top of this, we have a lot of code duplicated between :
     Standard algorithm dialog/panel
     Batch dialog/panel
     Modeler dialog/panel

A more modular vision could be to create a widget class for each 
parameter type.
ParametersPanel would only have to iterate over parameters and create 
appropriate widgets.

Using this, it could be easy to create new parameter types and related 
widgets without creating a custom dialog and panel class for each case.

Proposed design:
     Parameter class would have a new "widget" attribute (name as 
string) and optionally widget options.
     Existing parameters will have a default widget name already given.
     Processing UI will maintain a global a registry for widgets (name 
=> class)
     Each processing plugin could register it's own parameters types and 
related widgets.
     Each algorithm could override the default widget for a given parameter.

With this design, we have a dissociation between the parameters that are 
core related and widgets that are ui oriented. Widgets could be easily 
extended without altering the core.

For example, in postgis related algorithms, it could be possible to 
create custom widgets, capable of database introspection using existing 
GeoDB class to propose drop down lists of schemas and tables or primary 
keys and geometry column detection, without altering existing parameter 
types.

This is a draft, your comments are welcome.

Hi,
I often used the group to group layers about same thematics and perform
layout by simply checking the group (or viewing maps about that thematic).
This was before preset and multi styles land in QGIS but I suppose I may
not be the only one doing this.

Arnaud, I'm not really able to link your comment below to the proposal in
the issue.

> When I uncheck a layer group, I expect children to be hidden but not
unchecked.

With your proposal, would that mean that you can have a layer checked, but
because he is under an unchecked group, none of its features is displayed
in the canvas? Wouldn't that puzzle users?
If I understand Franck report, with a simple click on group level, layers
are all unchecked but next click only checks the previously checked, not
all the layers.
Do I misunderstand something?

Hi DelazJ,

Thanks for raising the difference between my proposal and Franck's ticket.
But this not seems really different.
The ticket says that when unchecking a group all layers should be unchecked.
IMHO another visual sign should be used (layer grayed, like when the 
layer is not visible due to scale).

Regards

I do not have a strong opinion on this and as far as we do not visually
offer something that puzzles the user, i'm ok and grayed representation can
be a solution.

Then, considering an unchecked group, how would layers (and group)
visibility behave if:
- I check a not previously checked layer in the group?

Hi all,
I'm revising the list of featured plugins[0]. I found the meaning
ambiguous: do we mean good plugins, or interesting ones? I mean, is the
list a way of promoting particularly interesting plugins, perhaps less
known than what they deserve, or those of highest quality, possibly
useful to everyone? I think the current list is a mix of both, and as
such not extremely useful.
In addition, in the list we have old stuff, sometimes superseded by core
functionality; I'd appreciate your suggestions on what to remove.
Thanks.

I like this design a lot. That will give us a cleaner structure and a
code that is easier to understand.

Definitely this has to be in 3.0, although it will be quite a bit of work.

Any additional comment from anyone?

Arnaud, will you at camptocamp be able to dedicate time to this task?
Let's see how we can better organize it

Thanks!

Is this list displayed in the plugin manager, as well as on the repo website?
If not, it should be. 

My vote is for Quick Map Services, to get more people to stop using the
Openlayers plugin, given the issues with the latter.

Hi all,
for those who are at the HackFest: this morning from h 10, in the main
room, we'll have a series of short talks about the many cool things we
are doing here. We have already on the pipeline:
* Ghetta+3liz: PlotSomething plugin
* 3liz: Lizmap in main repo?
* Denis: a library for plugin settings
* Matthias: testing Python API
* Nyall: QGIS task manager framework and generic properties framework plans.
You are most encouraged to to show what you are doing. We are too many,
most of us do not know what others are after.
All the best.

agreed: either display it in PM, or remove it (not many people visit the
website directly, I guess)
would you mind opening a ticket on this, or even better start coding?

already featured

Hi Nathan,

The styling dock was mentioned several times at the QGIS conference as 
one the next cool features.

However, the audience of the conference and dev meeting is slightly 
different.

Greetings and thanks for your improvements!
Andreas

Hi all,
is anybody busy getting weather data in QGIS?
There is interesting stuff, e.g.
http://www.digital-geography.com/cloud-gis-getting-weather-data/
but it would be good to make it more automatic. It does not seem a lot
of work, and it may open interesting options, both for live data and for
analyses.
If anybody is interested, I'm available for discussing and collaborating.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

The problem can be split into 2 different parts:
- Data discovery and retrieval 
- Data visualisation

The data discovery and retrieval can be implemented as a plugin using MARS API for example for ECMWF data:
https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/WEBAPI/Accessing+ECMWF+data+servers+in+batch

Data visualisation can be done using Crayfish plugin.

I am not aware of a way to display live data. For example, you can have WMS with time component, but for displaying the data you need to extend WMS support in QGIS to be able to display the data.

Cheers,
Saber

We have seen this recently:
https://github.com/IHCantabria/THREDDSExplorer
and I'm pretty convinced this should become a core feature.
Anyone interested? In case, perhaps worth a QEP.
Thanks.

I've started the work to define the common widget interface and 
ParametersPanel short methods.
The branch is there : 
https://github.com/arnaud-morvan/QGIS/commit/f28898b181e99b082f7f999a8de4d90430349c40
For now this is a draft, openned for discussion.

Not sure I will have a lot of time to spend on this immediately after 
the hackfest, fortunately 3.0 is not for next week.
I could take some time to keep it alive, and I will probably have some 
time to finish the work in Bonn.
Not sure it will take so much time, the functionnality is there, all to 
be done is dispatching code from ParametersPanel to Widgets, and for 
sure make some tests and bugfix (specially for batch and modeler dialogs).

Hi all,
sorry for the noob questions, but I’m struggling to find a solution to some simple issues.
I’m working on the Processing interface with a 3rd party software (i.e. FUSION). I’m not a programmer , so be patient!


1.       TEMPFILELIST: when I select more input files, a static method is called to write a temp list (to be used as wildcard). Actually the code says “filepath = userFolder() + os.sep + filename” and it doesn’t work, but if I set up a specific folder instead of userFolder, it works fine. Does it lose the way of the temp path?

2.       ACCESS TO SHAPEFILE: if I use a shapefile already opened in qgis for a clipping operation, the software (FUSION) has problems to access to it (and stops working); if I do the same operation with a shapefile not loaded in qgis, it works fine. Does qgis block files while reading them (as arcgis does with “.lock” temp files)?

3.       MODELER: Building up a model with FUSION tools, I’m obliged to fill also optional parameters to make the algorithm work, otherwise I receive the error “Wrong or missing value”. How can I solve this?

4.       OPTIONAL PARAMETERS: In the graphical panel of each algorithm, some parameters (i.e. input) automatically appear as “…[optional]” while they clearly aren’t. Where is it possible to change this behaviour?

I specify I’m using QGIS (2.14.3) on W10 64 bit.

Thank you VERY much in advance for those who have time&willing to answer  😊
Keep up with the good work!

All the best,

Nic

Hi all,
for those who are at the HackFest: this morning from h 10, in the main room, we'll have a series of short talks about the many cool things we are doing here. We have already on the pipeline:
* Ghetta+3liz: PlotSomething plugin
* 3liz: Lizmap in main repo?
* Denis: a library for plugin settings
* Matthias: testing Python API
* Nyall: QGIS task manager framework and generic properties framework plans.
You are most encouraged to to show what you are doing. We are too many, most of us do not know what others are after.
All the best.

Hello devs,

I am developping for QGIS under Debian Stretch and I have tested the 
qt5/Python3 port of QGIS.

But I am facing a problem with python3 plugin ports:
* I use PORT_PLUGINS CMake parameter.
* With this parameter, plugins are "auto-ported" to Python3 with 2to3 
tool.
* The result of the "port" is made in the output directory of the build 
directory (output/python/plugins).
* But it seems that `make install` takes directly files from the code 
directory instead of the build directory.
* This leads to install python2 version of the plugins instead of 
python3 version and plugins just crashes at QGIS opening.

I am a CMake newbie so I would like to check if I have not forgotten 
anything.

Do you have the same behavior ?

Cheers,

PS: I can't find something that installs/copies python3 plugins files in 
install prefix directory in python/plugins/CMakeLists.txt...

Hi Médéric,

This is very well possible, I always run from the build directory, so I
didn't check the install instructions and the PORT_PLUGINS functionality
has been introduced relatively recently and not widely been tested.

Hi All,

Here is my report for the first week of GSoC


*What did you get done this week?*
During community bonding period and 1st week, I spent my time discussing
with the community about the idea. We had a long email and comment
discussion even before we met in QGIS Hackfest. Right now the way I will go
is to use directory based for the repository. So this week I spent my time
mostly on shaping the idea with my mentors (Anita, Ale), Tim, Richard,
Martin, and other developers in QGIS Hackfest.


*What do you plan on doing next week?*
Next week, I will start implementing the UI.


*Are you blocked on anything?*
Yes, I couldn't build QGIS on master branch on Ubuntu 16.04 (it's fine with
other release branch), I've tried to remove the build folder (even
completely cloning it again - I am desperate enough). I'll look more into
it. You can see the error log here:
https://gist.github.com/akbargumbira/4221338b4b3042dcc144cd78aeb6ca69

I also made a blog post here

Luigi,
Thank You for the response and the interesting informations about future
improvements of QGIS Authentication System. 

I will wait to see documentation and proof of concept.

Sorry, for now I don't have suggestions how to integrate AuthManager and
NetworkManager with Windows key store , but  if I will know something then
sure I'd like contribute!

A clarification for my use case: a customer asks if he could use QGIS in
order to connect to OWS services behind Shibboleth page, if it does not work
then he will not use QGIS and will consider other solutions.
In that forced scenario I evaluated also other ideas in QGIS.

For the object of this thread, I attach experimental Python code sample:

As per subject the advanced digitizing tool warps
the geometry when used, e.g.

draw an orizontal line and rotate till it's vertical or almost vertical
confirm the action and the line will be much longer; this will
happen also with areas.

I've searched in the bug traking system and could not
find this possible bug, if you can confirm i'll open a ticket

thanks, Roy.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Geometry generator crashes QGIS if it encounters
	invalid geometries
Message-ID: <CAFFV8FhmpJwWyP4wpJOjyEzSY3P-ac69DjXR28=VzZhnrTBpog@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have client data with invalid polygon geometries. When I style the layer
with a geometry generator to create points at the polygon centroids, QGIS
crashes.

Of course I should fix the data, but on the other hand, it would be good if
QGIS would only throw an error instead of crashing.

Can anyone confirm?

Best wishes,
Anita

I'm currently undergoing an experiment of viewing lidar in GRASS. Its
completely doable and works well - I'm just trying to use all the correct
commands in the proper sequence. It ingests las files as well as ASCII.

Hello,

a few days ago I have taught a two hour workshop with the LAStools and
LAStools Production toolboxes using QGIS 2.14.1 Essen at the QGIS
conference in Girona. We did two different processing workflows and used it
across the15 different laptops of the attendees running three operating
systems without any major issues. So it certainly works.

An updated version of the LAStools and LAStools Production toolboxes was
created during the following hackfest to include more features and new
tools including the Potree based 'laspublish' [1] ... but more on that
later.

Regards,

Martin

We've been actively working on that, this kind of report is useful only if

This morning the plugins.qgis.org was showing nginx because of a config
change we did to speed up the downloading of plugins.xml

Last 2 days site was often down because some new functionality generated
a lot more cpu-power, and the download of plugins.xml was not cached
(anymore).

Alessandro implemented a caching mechanism, so NOW:
- plugin.xml's are cached (so should be retrieved much faster)
- site should be much faster because the (live) generated xml's are now
cached for 10 minutes.
- server is now almost sleeping compared to last few days
- it is good (and scary) to seem the amount of plugins.xml that are
downloaded...

Please let us know when still down.

Regards,

Richard

What does NOT work for you?

I basically rewrote nginx conf to serve cached xmls, I might have
misconfigured some other endpoints, please let me know if something does
not work.

This would be the other caching point, we are currently serving the
downloads through Django so that we can increment the download counter.

If the figures continue to grow we will eventually serve them directly.

I notice that this only happens if you are using a
geographic coordinate system for the layer,
it seems ok with projected systems

HI Massimo,

Thanks. Now I can build it. Anyway, we decided to make it as python plugin
first and make it similar like Plugin Manager later.

Cheers

For anyone experiencing this issue:

the problem is now fixed but you must use a fresh XML file or you will
still try to download the plugins from the wrong URL stored in the old
broken XML.

In the plugin manager settings there is a button to reload all
repositories, that will probably fix your problem.

Hi,

Thanks, Alessandro.

Don't know if it's related to recent changes (never checked that before)
but my plugin manager settings currently show 2 repositories listed, both
linking to the official repo url. The only difference is their name ("QGIS
Official Plugin Repository" and its translation "Dépôt Officiel des
extensions QGIS" in french). The system locale is french but I'm currently
working with an english localized QGIS version.
I can simply delete one row but wonder if I should file a ticket...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WFS question in QGIS master
Message-ID: <e4e4b3bb66a2eabf25e8af4ebf825f0f@carto.net>

Hi all, Hi Even, 

I am testing the new WFS improvements in QGIS master. 

We have a WFS service offering 1.1 and 2.0: see
https://www.zg.ch/behoerden/direktion-des-innern/geoportal/geodaten-einbinden/web-feature-service-wfs


The direct URL to the WFS is:
http://webdienste.zugmap.ch/landwirtschaft_naturschutz_wfs/service.svc/get
 

When I connect, I force it to version 2.0. The layer listing appears
fine - but when I add a layer, I get the following error message: 

------------------ 

Layer gmgml:LW_Bewirtschaftungseinheiten: Download of features for layer
gmgml:LW_Bewirtschaftungseinheiten failed or partially failed: Server
generated an exception in GetFeature response: Value
urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::21781 provided for a parameter SRSNAME is
invalid.. You may attempt reloading the layer with F5 

----------------- 

Is this a problem in the WFS server or in the client issueing an invalid
request? Can QGIS do something do be more tolerant and display this WFS
layer? 

I would very much appreciate if you could have a look at this service. 

Thank you very much, 

Andreas

Hi,

I posted an issue about once month ago about SpatiaLite layers not 
displaying in QGIS 2.14 whereas they do in QGIS 2.8 :
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/14626
This issue has been corrected by Jürgen - thanks so much to him - but 
the target version is 2.16.
As 2.14 is meant to be next LTR, I wonder if the patch could be 
backported in next 2.14 point release  ?

Hi Andreas,

There are several issues :

- the server doesn't like srsname of the form urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::XXXXX, but 
only EPSG:XXXXX. This is a bit a mix of the fault of the client & server here. 
The client does some internal normalization of the srsname when parsing the 
capabilities to store them in the form EPSG:XXXXX so that QGIS projection 
selector like them. And when issuing WFS requests, for WFS 1.0, it keeps 
EPSG:XXXXX and for later versions it uses  urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::XXXXX which 
is supposed to be the "new" way of specifying them (one could expect the 
server to return urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::XXXXX in WFS 2.0). Here it seems the 
Intergraph server doesn't like at all the new way. Some robustness could be 
added in the client to retry with the alternate way (and probably first try 
with the variant that was given in the capabilities)

- the schema returned by 
http://webdienste.zugmap.ch/landwirtschaft_naturschutz_wfs/service.svc/get?request=describefeaturetype&service=wfs&typename=gmgml:LW_Bewirtschaftungseinheiten&version=2.0.0 
is a bit too complex for the QGIS client and so it doesn't understand that 
"gmgml:Polygon_Surface_MultiSurface_CompositeSurfacePropertyType" is a 
geometry field (hence a geometry less layer reported). That could potentially 
be improved to hard code that this type is a polygon geometry (I see it is 
done in OGR GML driver)

- the response to GetFeature returned by 
http://webdienste.zugmap.ch/landwirtschaft_naturschutz_wfs/service.svc/get?SERVICE=WFS&REQUEST=GetFeature&VERSION=2.0.0&TYPENAMES=gmgml:LW_Bewirtschaftungseinheiten&SRSNAME=EPSG:21781&COUNT=1
is not conformant with the WFS 2.0 spec. It should be a wfs:FeatureCollection 
and not a GML feature collection as in WFS 1.1. The QGIS client is robust 
enough to handle that however... But this is clearly a non conformance to the 
spec

- in the geometries returned, there are constructs like gml:CompositeSurface 
and gml:Arc that the QGIS GML importer will not handle. Falling back to the 
OGR GML services to parse them could potentially be done as it is able to 
handle them (just tried with 'ogrinfo 
"WFS:http://webdienste.zugmap.ch/landwirtschaft_naturschutz_wfs/service.svc/get" 
-ro --debug on gmgml:LW_Bewirtschaftungseinheiten -al -q' )

SAGA dev team have changed (2.2.7) once more a crucial parameter [0], so
raster commands (probably all) are broken in QGIS/Processing.
IMHO it is infeasible to chase breaking changes in point releases, so I
suggest either saga devs stop breaking compatibility, except for major
releases, or Debian stop upgrading the package not to break qgis support.
Opinions most welcome.
All the best.

My opinion about this (and getting stronger each time, since the
situation is getting worse...) is that we have only two solutions:

1) fork SAGA and have QGIS depend on that forked software, which we
will (in principle) not upgrade.
2) embed a fixed version of SAGA, and use only that one. SAGA should
be treated like a library: we support a given version, and not all
version of it. If you want to use a different one, you cant (just like
QGIS uses Python2 and a user cannot use Python3)

I will be happy to discuss about this.

Yes I chatted with Victor about this at the HF and if we want processing to become something everyone can depend on to work reliably in their workflows then his way seems like a very good approach. Same approach for SAGA etc.

It is a great plugin, but isn’t THREDDS very domain specific? IMHO not very good candidate for core plugin status based on that. Or did you mean to say crayfish should be a core plugin?

Hey,

+1 for just bundling it on a fixed version. Moving targets are not ideal
and in this case seems to be pretty bad.

We will update it when the time comes.

Not knowing *anything at all* about the internals of SAGA... but how
feasible an option would it be to port the routines across to QGIS
classes? That'd have the benefit of avoiding the need to use
shapefiles as intermediate storage for SAGA algorithms.

Hi all,

thanks for your replies. IMHO:
* the current situation is unsustainable
* the best option would be for saga developers to adopt a more standard
approach, e.g. avoid mixing up bugfixes (in point releases) and
changes in the parameters (only in major releases), and keep backward
compatibility for previous parameters in all life cycle of minor releases
* if this is not feasible, the approach by Johan (maintaining a saga
LTR) seems the best one, as it is a general solution, provided it is
also followed by an appropriate versioning and dependency management for
packages
* bundling is an option mainly on windows; not generally feasible on
most Linux distros
* forking and embedding involves significant maintenance costs; I'm
unsure it would be acceptable for more rigorous packagers, and it should
be kept as a really last resort
* another beautiful option would be a complete merge between the two
projects, unifying the code base, but probably I'm dreaming here :)

All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Installing qgis 2.15 > errors
Message-ID: <449bd467-9367-5ae1-7cdc-da35f28c1254@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
installing the current dev version from deb packages returns errors:

===
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qgis/utils.py", line 20, in
    from future import standard_library
ImportError: No module named future
===

Installing python-future solves the above - I think this should be added
to dependencies.
The following are related to my installation (starting from a clean
configpath does not show this). Of course I do not want to miss my
configs, any hint?

===
An error occurred during execution of following code:
import pyplugin_installer
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe3' in
position 59: ordinal not in range(128)
===
An error occurred during execution of following code:
pyplugin_installer.initPluginInstaller()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in
NameError: name 'pyplugin_installer' is not defined
===

Thanks.

Hei Jim,

Without knowing some relevant details of your system I would guess you are facing this
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/493
issue in liblas on Windows...

Cheers

I know that the programs are installed with the GRASS 7.0.3 of QGIS 2.14 but they don't show up in the Processing Toolbox.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Refunds for Girona Developer Meeting
Message-ID: <284f2d4eaca47154c28c23d89142a82e@carto.net>

Hi, 

Because the refunds of expenses at the hackfest are a significant amount
of work, I'll post here some rules that I kindly ask you to follow: 

 	* Please send me a single (multi-page) PDF file containing all
necessary information. Please do not send me xx jpeg files taken from
some smartphone camera and let me do all the work. Please also don't
send me xx PDF files. Do package it nicely into one single PDF file!
 	* Please send me one single request for all of your expenses, not
multiple ones containing only xx items
 	* Refunds are made only for expenses where I have some proof:
scan/picture of invoice
 	* The PDF with the refund request needs to contain

 	* Your full address
 	* Your bank name
 	* Your bank address
 	* Your IBAN account number (or equivalent if outside of Europe)
 	* The Swift Code (or equivalent of outside of Europe)
 	* A list of all items
 	* THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ALL ITEMS IN ONE SINGLE CURRENCY (preferably
EUR)

 	* All items need some proof (e.g. scan/picture of ticket or invoice,
or print out from webpage if you ordered online)

I would very much appreciate if you follow the above rules, as it will
make my work much more enjoyable. 

Please also note that accommodation prior or after the meeting should be
paid privately - of course the night before or after the meeting will be
covered - but we won't pay for your extra days off before or after the
meeting. 

Thank you for your cooperation and thanks again for your active
participation at the dev meeting! 

Andreas

Sorry I was too quick: I meant that the capability of handling time
series data, as done in that plugin as well as in Crayfish, should
become a core feature.
Thanks for helping me clarifying.
All the best.
