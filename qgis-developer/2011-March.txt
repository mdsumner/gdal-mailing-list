Hi all especially Martin and Pirmin and those actively working on new features

I am just wondering how things are looking in terms of merging
branches. Is a merge of threaded rendering + 3d globe on the cards for
1.7 assuming we have a code freeze of around March 15? I'd like to get
1.7 out before the hackfest (oops QGIS Meeting) so was thinking along
the lines of :

- code freeze 15 march
- string freeze 21 march
- release branching 1 April (yes I know its a cool date to release the
code on :-)
- release announcements 7 April (or when packages are available

Are there any other major features people are working on that should
be considered for the release timeline? If the threading + globe
branches arent ready we can hold them over till 1.8, though it would
be nice to get them out there now to keep all the slathering fans
happy!

Regards

Tim

Well, of course the raster provider/reprojection branch.
All the best.

Sorry we already discussed that a little on this list so I excluded it
above as I was trying to get a handle on the other branches. Of course
we will merge Radims excellent work!

I briefly tested the raster provider branch today and it works great. The 
performance seems to be fast now even with reprojection turned on. The only 
thing with my test rasters that didn't work was the 'zoom to best resolution' 
function. However, this is a detail and I'm in favor of merging the branch to 
trunk soon and fixing the minor issues there.

Hi,
I have to do the code cleanup definitely in the branch + wms fix.
Then I'll let you know before merge.

Hi all,
regarding globe, we have a pretty stable gui, controls and functionality 
but we also have a major speed issue that we didn't really investigate 
since we where waiting for OSGearth 2.0 (out now and packaged 8h ago by 
Pirmin -thanks ) to make globe run with it (should solve plenty of 
stability issues).
So, i'd say it looks good, but Pirmin has to confirm and of course we 
rely on threading...

ciao Marco

Great. Looking forward for the merge. As soon as it will be merged, I'll
test it and prepare packages for Debian unstable amd64 for wider
testing.
Thanks a lot to Radim.

(I guess you mean _feature_ freeze on 15 march)

Let's see how much time I will find during this weekend to start
merging the stuff. I'm not sure how long that will take - depends on
the amount of conflicts that have to be resolved manually. I wonder if
git could be a more productive tool than svn for such big merges, but
given that I am still a beginner with git, I will probably stick with
good old painful merging with svn :-)

Tim,
I will need a few days after the treading branch merge for adding the globe 
plugin. But packaging for Windows and Mac will require some work, which isn't 
planned yet. Either J?rgen does the Windows packaging (OsgEarth and 
OpenSceneGraph libs) or I'll try it with his assistance. And I will support 
kingchaos building the needed libs for Mac. The needed ubuntugis packages will 
be up-to-date tomorrow and I will do another attempt to bring the packages 
into Debian.

trivial in git. But there is no free ride in life an you still need to
deal with conflicts either way...

What makes git also easier is you just do:

git checkout master
git merge foo_branch

Assuming no conflicts, its job done. But sticking with svn for now
probably is a good idea...

I will probably raise the idea of SVN - GIT migration again at this
hackfest now that we have more of a critical mass of devs who have
actually used it. I've been using it almost exclusively since Pirmin
brainwashed...er...taught us to use git and on the whole its been a
change for the better even if some procedures are more complicated.

Ok lets wait and see how Martin gets on with his merge and then

Hi Devs, 

It seems that QGIS Trunk does ignore the content of the
'prj' file for a shapefile. Instead it seems to only recognise a 'qpj'
file to allocate CRS for that shapefile. 

Is it intentional in order to
render import of shapefiles generated from other packages very difficult
and lock users into QGIS? Or is it a bug?

Benoit

I tested with a shp that I use in training courses I give. For me if I
rename the qpj, the prj is still recognised correctly.

I think I can speak on behalf of myself and the other developers and
categorically state that this *never* would be our intention. We
embrace openness in every way and have nothing to gain by locking in
users to our software.

So given my comments above, yes, if it doesnt work for you it may be a bug.

Just checked: a shp with a prj, no qpj is recognized and reprojected
correctly.
Could you please share the shp that gives you trouble?
All the best.

 Let me comment a bit more:

 Create a new project and set its CRS to the same CRS the shapefile is 
 in and enable OTF
 In Settings/Options, CRS tab, select "Prompt for CRS"
 Rename the qjp to prj
 Load the shapefile into the project
 You will be asked to defined its CRS.
 Remove the shapefile from the project

 Rename the prj to qjp
 Load the shapefile into the project
 You are not asked to defined its CRS.

 Can you replicate that behaviour?


 Even worse:
 Have a shapefile defined in a projected CRS (e.g. WGS84 UTM30N) with a 
 prj file and no qpj
 Create a new QGIS project and set its CRS to another projected CRS 
 (e.g. Google Mercator) and enable OTF
 Set Settings/Options, CRS tab, to "Project wide default CRS will be 
 used"
 Load the shapefile, you are not asked for its projection but QGIS 
 assumes that it is Google Mercator (the project CRS) not the shapefile 
 CRS.

 Can you check that as well?

 BTW: I'm on Win7 - OSGeo4W - Trunk

 Sorry, I was just cynical!
 I find QGIS very easy to use and love it, simply, the latest glitches 
 with CRS drive me mad.

 Hi Paolo,

 Please see attached zip file (small 2KB file)

 It contains:
 - A point shapefile with its CRS set to WGS84 UTM30N (prj file only) 
 and a single point (located over the town of Kumasi in Ghana)
 - A QGIS project in Google Mercator CRS.

 When you load the shapefile into the project and then use the google 
 plugin to display the satellite image around the point you could note 
 that the satellite image is not what you expect (if you know the area).
 Also, double click the shapefile layer and go to the General tab. The 
 CRS is set to Google Mercator, not UTM30N.

 Quit QGIS, rename the prj to qpj and do the above process again, and 
 all is correct now.

 I hope you can reproduce this behaviour.

 Regards,
 Benoit

Hi Benoit,

I created a new shapefile by QGIS with same CRS of Town (EPSG 32630).

The QGIS created two files of projections: PRJ and  QPJ.

The PRJ have the same value of yours (Town.prj) but the QPJ don?t have
same value (see below):

1) Default -PRJ :

PROJCS["WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_30N",GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",-3],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["Meter",1]]

2) Create by QGIS - QPJ :

PROJCS["UTM Zone 30, Northern Hemisphere",GEOGCS["WGS
84",DATUM["WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS
84",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY["EPSG","7030"]],TOWGS84[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],AUTHORITY["EPSG","6326"]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY["EPSG","9108"]],AUTHORITY["EPSG","4326"]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",-3],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["Meter",1]]

The QGIS read CRS only by QPJ value.

You can put this value(QPJ) inside in PRJ file for work with QGIS.


The questions is:
Why, QGIS have two different values for "WKT CSR"  for same EPSG 32630 ?
One for PRJ other for QPJ

Hi,
What about open tickets (bug fixes) that are not in branches? What is
the timeline for them? Now that New Symbology  is the default, I guess
the following should be fixed before release, or am I missing something?

 Hi Luiz,

 Thanks for your comments.

 Yes, there is a CRS definition difference between prj and qpj.
 But, if you only have a prj file you can rename it to qpj. QGIS does 
 not complain and displays the shapefile at the correct location.
 So the way to go forward, at least for me, would be to rename all the 
 shapefiles *.prj to *.qpj in order to use them in QGIS.

 Note that in doing the above, loading the shapefile into QGIS and going 
 to Layers properties, General tab, the CRS is specified as below:
 " - * Generated CRS (+proj=utm +zone=30 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m 
 +no_defs)"

 It seems that QGIS recomputes its own CRS from the qpj (= renamed prj).

 Another question is why does QGIS now need a qpj file when a prj file 
 exists?

 Regards,
 Benoit

This is not the correct behaviour: QGIS should use qpj when present,
otherwise prj, if nothing is available it should apply the default, as
chosen by the user from the menu Options.
If the behaviour you describe is confirmed (in my case it is not), then
it's a bug.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I agree with you.

Furthermore, the behaviour should depend on the option selected in
Settings/Options->CRS tab:

Option: "Prompt for CRS" should ask the user to define the CRS of the
loaded file if, and only if, it is not defined. Unfortunately if you
only have a prj file, QGIS asks you to define the CRS. QGIS only
recognises the qpj file.

Option: "Project wide default CRS will be used". Here again the prj file
is not recognised and the shapefile is given the project CRS. It is fine
when both have the same CRS but lead to wrong location if they don't and
"on-the-fly" projection has been enabled.

Option: "Global default CRS displayed below will be used". Again, the
prj file is not recognised and the shapefile is given the global default
CRS.

I have this problem when I want to import a shapefile (in a projected
CRS) into a project having a Google Mercator CRS and OTF enabled.

Can this be confirmed by someone, or am I doing something wrong?

Regards,
Benoit

Hi Benoit,

I can confirm this behavior for me as well. It seems to have crept into trunk in the past month or two. I have been banging my head on this as it is very frustrating. Shapefiles with associated prj, gdal recognizes the CRS, but QGIS seems to ignore it.

Let's look at the OS we are using. I am on OS X with William's frameworks. I build following the OS X build instructions. Any chance you are on the same build environment or is it another OS?

Cheers,
John

Hi John,

Thanks for your report and confirmation of this behaviour. 

I'm on windows7 64bits at work and winXP 32bits at home. On both it is OSGeo4W trunk. So it seems it is not OS dependent. 

Regards,
Benoit

We usually try to make sure there are no show stoppers when we release
and remaining tickets get carried over to next release. I dont think
we will ever be able to be in a situation where there are no open
tickets left at the time of a release.

This is a great list / wiki page. The wait / when to release
discussion is one that comes up periodically. I agree the items in
your list should get attention - and no doubt more items will be
raised when people are using symobology-ng by default. However these
are not things I believe we should put a hold on the release for. If
there is a general unhappiness about the situation, we can reinstate
old symbology by default, but if not, lets put what we have out there
for people to test and use, and march on towards 2.0.

Tim

I checked using QGIS 1.6 on Ubuntu, just one shapefile, after renaming 
the *.qpj - leaving only the *.prj - and it behaved as expected. i.e. 
the correct CRS was recognized without asking any questions. In the 
Options->CRS I have global default set to EPSG:4326, and that was not 
used, so QGIS found the correct CRS from the *.prj .

Hi everyone,

I somehow sent this to the old sourceforge list by mistake :(

I'm not a developer, but I saw this:

 

 

>>> it would be nice to be able to

>>>would the diagram's placement be persisted? In the same way as labels

for me at the moment.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but it seems to me that a much better 

solution would be to enable editing of joined tables in the table joins 

branch.  

Instead of being saved in the project file, label information could then


be saved in a joined table.  This would have the following advantages:

 

- The project file would not become bloated with label information

- Label information could be easily reused between projects

- The work done to implement it would benefit not only labelling, but 

also other uses of writable table joins.

 

I also guess that it might result in less of an increase in code 

complexity, and therefore be less of a burden for code maintenance... 

but I could well be wrong about this :)

Alister

Hi Gary,

Thanks for our work.

By the way, I want to know how do you organize the QGIS source. I mean  
when I SVN a branch and have a new directory created in my home, I can't  
even get an entry to start to read or learn.

I was told that QGIS is developed with QT. Then what I can do to project  
the QGIS source files with QT Creator or something else.

Could you please explain it with your experience? Thanks in advance.

Hi Micha,

I believe this bug has cropped up since the 1.6 milestone, although I am not certain. I believe the issue is in the current development trunk, so building that and testing would be helpful if you have the ability to do so.

Cheers,
John

 Not yet. Will do it now.

 And to confirm, yes, it only appears in Trunk (since at least the last 
 15 revisions, not sure exactly). Versions <= 1.6 works as expected.

Hi all,
we are developing simple PyQGIS PostGIS viewer [1], [2] and having
troubles to get antialiasing working. Code is the same as in PyQGIS
Cookbook, but not working with current QGIS trunk version (
self.canvas.enableAntiAliasing( True ) in QMainWindow class ).

Can somebody look at code [1] (line 137 in 'postgis_viewer.py' ) and
confirm that I should fill bug report?

Yes, true. In fact, in many cases where the data defined labeling positions are 
in use, it comes from db tables joined by a view.

The code of the table join branch is in trunk now, but without editing 
possibility for joined fields (unfortunately even without indication that 
joined fields cannot be edited). I agree it makes sense to enable editing for 
joined fields too.

Regarding the question of storing label / diagram positions in attributes or 
in project file: there are good use cases for both and one does not exclude the 
other. While storing in attributes is already implemented, it would be good to 
have in future a user option to select wether to load/store in data columns or 
in project file.

Btw., I'm progressing with the diagrams, so hopefully I can publish a patch 
soon.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] bug queue
Message-ID: <1299085035.2983.118.camel@ursus.ufficio.net>

Hi all.
As you may know, we are preparing for the release of 1.7. Our bug queue
is very long. I'm cleaning it, removing duplicates and presumably
invalid tickets, but it's a mammoth task.
We currently have:
Build/install 10 tickets
C++ plugins 36
Data Provider 36
Digitising 33
Documentation 7
GRASS 55
GUI 83
MapCanvas 36
Map Legend 20
Printing 53
Projection 30
Project load 21
Py plugins 68
Rasters 25
Symbology 82
Translation 4
Vectors 55
WMS+WFS 19

I would ask:
- to user, to check the tickets (both their own, and those that they can
understand) and add their notes, checking if they are duplicated,
invalid, misclassified, or fixed; I'm finding several very unclear
descriptions, so your help to clarify and check is very useful
- to developers, to have a look (I know, the long list is confusing and
intimidating) and see if there are patches to be applies, solved issues,
and the like.
Many thanks to all.

Message-ID: <2047654687.7220481299085310825.JavaMail.root@zimbra7-e1.priv.proxad.net>

Hi,

(This follows this thread: Branch status for merge and release timeline proposal)

Thanks for you answer Tim! I found the clarification useful and I appreciate your sense of diplomacy. Here are a few thoughts.

You wrote: "I agree the items in your list should get attention"
Just to make sure: most of the list (including links to my patch) was written by users Neumann and Anitagraser.

Among those fixes, we are several developers to believe that symbol levels in rule-based rendering should be fixed, even with a temporary fix. A fix was proposed in August 2010 by mhugent, see:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2832#comment:8
His patch was applied except for the symbol level lines (about 10 lines of code).

I made improvements to this code and my patch was somehow applied, again without the few symbol level lines of code.
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222#comment:15

I agree with Martin that it would be better to have a final solution than an incomplete one for symbol levels. But since the rule-based rendering is currently in an incomplete state, why put it in the renderer stable release anyway? I believe symbol levels make a huge difference in rendering lines. With them, I have a rendering similar to Osmarender or Mapnik in QGIS which gives QGIS a definitive bonus with respect to many other desktop or server GIS.
(for a rendering sample, see:
http://www.qgis.org/qgiswiki/images/f/fd/Lago_di_varese.png
which is compared with the OSM python plugin rendering here:  http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Using_OpenStreetMap_data  )

Also, QGIS rule-based rendering is definitely more powerful than what you can achieve on ArcGIS with queries and scale-related visibility, but ArcGIS users who need symbol levels will not want QGIS's rule-based rendering.

Ideally we should be able to have any combinations of the following:
-symbol levels ON or OFF
-apply first matching rule or apply all rules
(That's 4 combinations)

With a few lines take from any of the two patches proposed by mhugent and myself, we can have either:
-symbol levels OFF and apply all rules
-symbol levels ON and apply first matching rule

With the current version (since r15217) we only have:
-symbol levels OFF and apply all rules

Adding the extra capability provided in the two proposed patches does not prevent working later on having the missing two combinations:
-symbol levels ON and apply all rules
-symbol levels OFF and apply first matching rule

What do you think?

Mayeul

We usually try to make sure there are no show stoppers when we release
and remaining tickets get carried over to next release. I dont think
we will ever be able to be in a situation where there are no open
tickets left at the time of a release.

This is a great list / wiki page. The wait / when to release
discussion is one that comes up periodically. I agree the items in
your list should get attention - and no doubt more items will be
raised when people are using symobology-ng by default. However these
are not things I believe we should put a hold on the release for. If
there is a general unhappiness about the situation, we can reinstate
old symbology by default, but if not, lets put what we have out there
for people to test and use, and march on towards 2.0.

Regards

Tim

Hi Ivan,

right now I am working on the plugin and I have finally gotten the
antialiasing working as expected with these two lines:

-------------------------------
self.canvas.useImageToRender( True )
self.canvas.enableAntiAliasing( True )
-------------------------------

I am not sure if that is the appropriate way to get it working but... it
works.

I plan to release the plugin soon, but I need to do the
multi-layer-properties stuff before.

Regards,

Germ?n

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to debug and unit test Python plugins outside
 QGIS (e.g. in Ecplise IDE + PyDev)
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=cHic2XwFojZ5mJE3jLfKL4zvsVHdBXjThXuYL@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to writing Python plugins for QGIS and I like to debug and
unit test theses outside QGIS runtime but don't see any instructions
on how to do this.

Of course, the ultimate test of any plugin is to run it inside QGIS.
But I'd like do that outside QGIS for example in Eclipse IDE (+ PyDev)
in order to get code-completion, to debug it and to write unit tests
on it.

The problem is that one gets "ImportError: No module named ..." with
mostly PyQt4/qgis modules which (of course) cannot be imported.

This post mentions "Forced builtin libs" and reports a similar
problem: http://www.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2010-February/009182.html
... and this PyDev documentation explains "Forced builtin libs" and
"Predefined completions":
http://pydev.org/manual_101_interpreter.html#id1

I can't imagine that I'm the first trying to debug and unit test
Python plugins for QGIS.

Can anybody give me a hand on this?

Yours, S.

I've been meaning to write this up for some time. The only way I've
found to Debug a QGIS plugin is using a debugger hook in python. While I
have only tested this method with SPE's Winpdb (No Win does not stand
for MS Windows - SPE is python cross platform) debugger it theoretically
should be possible with other tools if they support the same kind of
debugging method.

Basically I insert something like:
import rpdb2; rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger("testing")

just below the main part of my plugin:
class MetaEditPlugin:
    def __init__(self,iface):
        #Only turn on to use winpdb debugger
        import rpdb2; rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger("testing")

Then the procedure is to start QGIS, Launch the plugin, switch to SPE's
winpdb, then do File attach, put in the same password "testing".
It will then show you the running apps you can connect to, once you
select and connect the plugin will continue to run.
At this point you can set breakpoints and catch errors. If/When it stops
at such a point you can interact with the app in a way similar to
Python's pdb sending eval and exec snippets, and inpecting all your
variables in the list.

Make sure to comment out that line for production use otherwise your
plugin will always stall and wait for the debug to connect.

Basically I think this falls under the term "Remote Debugging" if you
want to try and find ways to do it with other apps.

I'm not sure there is any other practical method as most plugins rely on
the QGIS built in stuff to be in an active session, so I wouldn't waste
too much time trying to do it without QGIS running at all.

Enjoy,
Alex

Hi Alex,

Many thanks for your reply. I'll try this.

But: So you say implicitly that its impossible to run unit tests
(PyUnit) on QGIS plugins?
I still hope there is a way to make PyGt4 module interface accessible
outside QGIS. At runtime its there, so it should be somehow possible
either by "Forced builtin libs" or by extracting the information by
hand with dummy stubs...?

Yours, S.

It might be possible, I'm not super familiar with units tests yet.
The big issue I see is that most plugins rely on the main QGIS app
providing data to the plugin or interacting with the plugin. If you can
design the test to provide what the unit test needs then it should be
doable. After all you can build standalone python apps with the QGIS api.

Thanks,
Alex

Many thanks also for the hint to standalone apps.!
I still hope there is a solution to unit test QGIS plugins.
This would make QGIS programmers even more happy :->

Yours, S.

 Couldn't this be a GSoC idea?

 Creating a developer-friendly Development environment for Python 
 Developers? With a nice debugging solution, code completion, possibility 
 to do unit tests, integration with the plugin repository, etc.?

 I would guess a lot of devs would gain productivity through such 
 improved developer tools and a student could learn quite a bit in 
 putting these together.

I still hope this should be an issue to be solved within reasonable
time given Eclipse as IDE.
However, yes, it could be that this turns out to be a larger endeavour.
I can imagine that one solution could be that Python stubs have to be
generated out of PyGt4/QGIS libs?

Yours, S.

Hi Stefan

I think most of the relevant information is covered in the cookbook:
http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/intro.html#python-applications

I hope PyDev has a configuration dialog where you can add your custom
python paths to avoid these import errors.

The only difference when running unit-tests (i.e. standalone apps) is
that you cannot access QGIS interface (qgis.utils.iface) since there
is no QGIS running. But that should not pose a big problem. In case
you really need access to that interface you can create your own
implementation of QgisInterface class and assign it to
qgis.utils.iface.

Regards
Martin

Oh Yes, it is working. Thanks.

What about doing further development in Github repository? I can give
You commit permissions to my repo or You can fork yourself.

I wonder if this is official way how to enable AntiAliasing. I so, we
should add it in to Cookbook.

This seems to be caused by the trackgps plugin (not shipped as part of
QGIS) so please contact that plugin's developer (or disable the plugin
if you dont use it).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsLegendInterface
Message-ID: <4D6FB366.50204@bernawebdesign.ch>

QgsLegendInterface::groupLayerRelationship() returns this:
[group0, group1, subGroupOfGroup0]
BUT
QgsLegendInterface::groups() returns:
[group0, subGroupOfGroup0, group1]

notice the difference in the order, is this done on purpose? or a bug? I
spent couple of ours digging for the problem in my code today and it
turned out to be because I was using the indexes from groups().

as well, if you want to have all the groups name, now you have to
iterate on groupLayerRelationship() like this:

groups = []
for group in self.legend.groupLayerRelationship():
                    groups.append(group[0])

and then groups is an array with all the group names (like groups()) but
in the same order as the groupLayerRelationship().

I think that it would be sensible to have a method like groups() that
returns the same as my iteration above. what do you think? I would of
course do it if it is needed.

ciao

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GPLv2+ files and GPLv3+ files
Message-ID: <201103031652.12755.marco.hugentobler@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs

Following up on ticket 3432 (License conflict with GPLv3+ libs), I had a 
discussion with Volker about it . The conclusion was that there is no conflict, 
but the only way to distribute QGIS currently is under the terms of the GPLv3. 
This is because most of the source files are under GPLv2+ (version2 or any 
later version). However, PAL and the sqlanywhere plugin/provider sources are 
GPLv3+.

In my opinion, GPLv3 shouldn't be a problem for the project. From the GNU 
page, the major changes seem to be a clause that forbids discriminatory patent 
deals and one that does not allow sueing DRM hackers.

Regards,
Marco

Hie,


Today I was using Qgis..Something very general took my attention. In order
to show the layer or make the layer visible you want , you click on the box
near the layer and  "x" appears on it. Isn' t that icon has the meaning of
closing something.. and not related with opening or showing.. Just a
question I wonder...And just an opinion of course, tick icon could
be better there not to confuse...

The way that the checkbox is displayed is a function of your operating
system and, if applicable, the desktop environment theme you are
using. For me under ubuntu / gnome, I get nice little tick marks as
shown in the attached screenie[1].

No, I did not manage to get GPS signal from the Android phone to my laptop.

Is your Nokia phone has GPS? And are you able to get the GPS signal to QGIS?

Yes, it was pretty easy. I roughly followed this guide:

http://www.rokip.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=78:nokia-
n95-als-gps-maus-symarctic-extgpsubuntu-910tangogpsgpsd&catid=39:n95&Itemid=10

It is in German, but you might manage to get the meaning or translate it. I 
can also translate for you, if necessary.

It should work also if useImageToRender is False. Fixed now in trunk (r15324).

Volker,

Thanks for the link.

I can read, understand and speak German a bit. I was in Germany for 1
year in 1988.

The hardest thing for me now is to write in German.

Danke Schoen.

Noli

It seems that the semantics has slightly changed recently with the
merge of table join branch. Now the fields are stored in the layer
when the layer is created, so when the provider adds new fields in the
meantime, they're not propagated automatically to the layer. You have
to call explicitly:
layer.updateFieldMap()

Probably this could be considered as a bug.

Ok I had a read through the ticket. Martin is the maintainer of this
code so while I share your desire for symbol levels in rule based
renderer, I think we should give Martin the space to implement the
solution in his way if he has a better approach. I know Martin has  a
lot of other things on his plate so lets give him some time. If coming
up to the release we need to apply a band aid fix (that doesnt break
any compatibility) to get 1.7 out with symbol level support, we could
apply your patch to the release branch and keep trunk untouched for
Martin to implement it in his preferred way. Martin, Marco that sound
ok for you?

Very nice - I also have someone working on building rendering rules
for OSM here at Linfiniti and have been reading your notes and the
discussions on OSM symbology here on this list with interest.

Yup those all sound useful - the idea being that you could create a
sequence of symbol layers based on rules offers powerful
possibilities. By the way did you figure out the correct syntax for
the modulus operator? I was trying to make a simple rule to make every
contour % 100m a bit thicker. Eventually I settled for contour in
(100,200,300....) which is ugly but worked...

Yes personally I would like to see these options too.

Hi all.
I'm trying to import layers from the canvas into R using manageR, but I
cannot:

In the first case it was a WFS layer, in the second a plain shp.
Loading the same shapefile and exporting it to the canvas works
smoothly.
BTW, loading a shp misses the Browse... button.
Any hint welcome.
Thanks.

Apparently the Offline editing plugin is broken: it produces the

I notice the new record has the gid missing (no serial in the db, I

The plugin is unmaintained, and has several bugs. Given that all its
functionality, AFAICT, is available through the handy "Save as..."
contextual menu, why not removing it? The only feature one could be
missing is the possibility of converting non loaded layers, thus saving
some time, but I do not see this as a major drawback.

Thanks for the positive response: from 691 to 657 tickets in 1.5 days,
let keep on.
I'm adding notes to old tickets that may have been solved, asking to
check again (some of them require special data or settings I do not
have): please help checking, and confirm or close the tickets.

By this, do you mean loading it via say readOGR?

Is the shapefile in a projected CRS? Sometimes R doesn't like it when
manageR tries to import an un-projected layer for some reason?

This will be available in the next version, which is still a ways off
at this point unfortunately :-(

Hi,
Thanks a lot for the answer, for your comments and for your proposal! If needed, I can try and work on XSLT to convert the styles between the different qml versions that might appear in this process.

Here is my answer with respect to your question on level curves:

No, I use external modulo: First I wrote an R script which connects to the .dbf and adds a column with 4 different values values like:
|type |
-------
(NULL)
100
500
1000

Later on I did the same under postgresql.

Then in QGIS I defined four rules with different thickness, using scale-based filtering as well.
It would be great to know exactly what are the operators that can be used (what is the underlying language?). I found a few simple regexp that I use for instance for altitude range (to display mountain summit points depending on their altitude, even if the metric unit "m" is included - which is contrary to OSM standard).

Ok I had a read through the ticket. Martin is the maintainer of this
code so while I share your desire for symbol levels in rule based
renderer, I think we should give Martin the space to implement the
solution in his way if he has a better approach. I know Martin has  a
lot of other things on his plate so lets give him some time. If coming
up to the release we need to apply a band aid fix (that doesnt break
any compatibility) to get 1.7 out with symbol level support, we could
apply your patch to the release branch and keep trunk untouched for
Martin to implement it in his preferred way. Martin, Marco that sound
ok for you?

Yup those all sound useful - the idea being that you could create a

Hello again,

can someone clarify, what is the plan to make progress with the new repo?

For instance, there is a bug causing the "Last modified" field to be
updated on every plugin download. The bug was fixed 2 weeks ago in
qgis-django GitHub repo, but it was not deployed to the server.

I understand that QGIS is opensource project based on volunteers' work
so the development is not as fast as we would like to see. However,
this new plugin repo seems to be very promising project, not far from
being ready to launch, but I am missing a clear roadmap. I think it
would be nice to add the repo to the list of repos in the upcoming 1.7
release, even being disabled at the time of the release.

Thanks

Hello,

I developed the plugins app but I have no "deployment rights" so all that I
can do is develop and fix, but somebody else must push it online.

I'm going to join the next hackfest and I will dedicate all my time there to
further develop, improve and fix the new plugin site, so I believe it would
be really useful if during the following month, the new system could be
tested and new feature/bugfix requests added to the ticket system.

Regards.

Hi again,
I mentioned regexp in rules.
In fact you can use them in place of the modulo operator when you want to test "some_number modulo 100 = 0", as it is trivial to test if the last two characters are zeroes.

I have not tested this but it should work from 100 to 8900 meters:
height like '%[1-8]*[0-9]00'

You could also have this I guess for main curves every 200 meters:
height like '%[1-8]*[02468]00'

* is for optional previous character (not tested when previous character is a regexp)
% is for any number of characters
[a-c] for range

I have tested the following rules and they work fine to display mountains from OSM data according to their height:
tags like '%"natural"="peak"%'  AND (tags like '%"ele"="[1-9][0-9]m*"%'  OR tags like '%"ele"="[1-4][0-9][0-9]m*"%')
tags like '%"natural"="peak"%'  AND tags like '%"ele"="[5-9][0-9][0-9]m*"%'
tags like '%"natural"="peak"%'  AND tags like '%"ele"="1[0-4][0-9][0-9]m*"%'
tags like '%"natural"="peak"%'  AND tags like '%"ele"="1[5-9][0-9][0-9]m*"%'
tags like '%"natural"="peak"%'  AND tags like '%"ele"="2[0-9][0-9][0-9]m*"%'
tags like '%"natural"="peak"%'  AND tags like '%"ele"="3[0-9][0-9][0-9]m*"%'
tags like '%"natural"="peak"%'  AND tags like '%"ele"="[4-8][0-9][0-9][0-9]m*"%'

Hi,
Thanks a lot for the answer, for your comments and for your proposal! If needed, I can try and work on XSLT to convert the styles between the different qml versions that might appear in this process.

Here is my answer with respect to your question on level curves:
"By the way did you figure out the correct syntax for
the modulus operator? I was trying to make a simple rule to make every
contour % 100m a bit thicker. Eventually I settled for contour in
(100,200,300....) which is ugly but worked..."
No, I use external modulo: First I wrote an R script which connects to the .dbf and adds a column with 4 different values values like:
|type |
-------
(NULL)
100
500
1000

Later on I did the same under postgresql.

Then in QGIS I defined four rules with different thickness, using scale-based filtering as well.
It would be great to know exactly what are the operators that can be used (what is the underlying language?). I found a few simple regexp that I use for instance for altitude range (to display mountain summit points depending on their altitude, even if the metric unit "m" is included - which is contrary to OSM standard).

I understand it may be difficult for developers to navigate in the
hundreds of thickets. Would it help to move group of tickets to finer
categories, and attribute them to the developers that deal with them?
E.g. GdalTools could go to brushtyler, fTools to cfarmer, etc.
If you have suggestions, I can make the new cats and move the tickets.
All the best.

Well, since it was me and Borys who started the concept of a new
plugin repository, probably we are the ones to blame. Not having
Alessandro on board, there would be probably zero lines of code of the
repository (kudos to him!). Speaking of myself currently I have other
stuff to do with higher priority, probably the same for Borys.

Therefore anyone interested in making the new repository a reality is
welcome to contribute: we need an updated roadmap, we need to find and
resolve bugs, we need a bit nicer webpage interface and we need a
means for simple uploading of plugins (I have been raving about that
in one thread recently).

Nice !
Will it make its way into the binary packages (more exactly the 
libqgis-dev package) ?

In external projects, I'd like to do find_package(QGIS), but i don't 
want to include the FindQGIS file in the external project sources.

For example, this is what we do for an application written on top of OTB :
http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/Monteverdi/file/f4f1c170dec6/CMakeLists.txt#l74

The OTB exports these main CMake files in the dev package :
/usr/lib/otb/UseOTB.cmake
/usr/lib/otb/OTBConfig.cmake

The INCLUDE(${OTB_USE_FILE}) command is used to add the include dirs, 
compiler definitions, etc...

The idea of separating the find_package and the actual 
include_directories/add_definitions seems nice to me.
With all the possibilities offered by QGis, there might be different 
"use file" (for plugins, for applications built on top of QGis lib, ...)

I just seen it after an source update, I'll test it soon.

But what I would have expected is different : something like a 
ld.conf.so.d directory, where simple text files contain paths to other 
directories.
If we manage to have a working otb-qgisplugins debian package, I'd like 
it to just drop a file in this directory, containing something like 
/usr/lib/otb/qgisplugins.

The advantages I see :
- at install time, the package would just drop a file in this directory, 
and would not install all the files inside the qgis plugin dir.
- uninstalling the package would be just a matter of deleting this 
little text file
- those steps would be run for all users automatically

Having two layers (one system layer/ one per-user layer as you 
implemented it) seems useful at first sight.

Do you think it could complicate things too much ?

No problem. Drop a mail on our list and we will try to help.

Thanks Martin,

IMHO the best thing to do is to upload the latest code (Tim is going to do
it soon) and start to test and collect bug reports, feature requests and
proposals in the hub: http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-django .

I cannot dedicate much time to this task right now, but I will certainly do
it during the hackfest.

Moreover, when I try to change my details, after typing my email I get:

There's been an internal error on the server; it probably wasn't
anything you did, so don't worry too much about it. The site
administrators have been emailed with the details, and they'll probably
get it fixed real soon.

BTW, could we integrate the plugin bugtracker, moving it from
http://qgis.osgeo.osuosl.org/ to a more appropriate name
(dev.plugins.qgis.org or similar)?

We did move it, there was an on list conversation to pick the new url -
hub.qgis.org

Though if a better name comes up later it can be adjusted.

Message-ID: <1299267443.19811.99.camel@ursus.ufficio.net>

Hi all.
The new infrastructure for plugins seems essentially in place, at:
http://plugins.qgis.org
I would suggest everybody to test it, and report issues on:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-django/issues

In general, the bugtracker for plugins is:
http://hub.qgis.org/

As soon as it has been tested, I would suggest to discover it to the
wider public, linking it from the main qgis page, and moving the plugins
there, and making it the default repo.

All the best.

Exactly, I'm completely stuck with a few paid jobs :( I'm reading the related 
discussions, but can't join yet and probably won't be able to be helpful this 
month. I'm going to focus on it (especially on the Installer side) in Lisbon 
and do some progress.

However, if the repo is going to be included in 1.7, of course I'll find some 
time to implement an initial support in the Installer before the freeze.

For pyplugin related tickets, I divide them among authors, so it's kinda two-
step classification: a general category -> maintainer. I wonder whether higher 
number of precise categories is better or worse solution and can't find the 
answer...

I tried Eclipse with Pydev years back and felt that it was a dead end
for Python programming (Also a bit of a resource hog). Partly because
all the useful stuff wasn't in the open source version, and partly
because Eclipse was a huge memory hole for something as simple as python.

Eric, SPE, and Spyder all seem like better options - 2 of the 3 are
written with PyQt also and I've gotten at least 2 of them to work with
OSGeo4W installs (Requires launching via a batch file).

I'm not so sure this would be a QGIS SOC project, however if it's just a
task in say creating unit tests that would make sense.

Thanks,
Alex

To me this is very simple: a category has a meaning as long as there is
a maintainer for it.
Therefore, please developers stand up and tell which area is of your
interest, and I'll move the tickets as appropriate.
Of course this does not guarantees in any way a faster resolution of
tickets, but at least it will be easier for devs to know where the
problems are. While cleaning up the queue I found several tickets
already solved, which polluted the queue, increasing the noise.
Can I proceed with fTools and GdalTools?
All the best.

Let's try to understand what is needed.

For a developer, a command "Publish my plugin" that:
* adds the plugin to the standard repo
* publish a web page with basic info on the plugin:
  * description
  * user comments and rating
  * number of downloads
* optionally adds the plugin to a code revision system (git or svn)
* adds a system to autopublish the plugin, at every commit or through a
specific command
* creates a bug tracker instance for the plugin

For an user, just a button "More info" for each plugin, redirecting to
the above described page.

And of course we all want to manage all this through QGIS, without any
need for external programs (i.e. a browser).

Do we agree on this? How far are we from here?

All the best.

Hi,
Maybe you are right so I'll speak for myself alone. Or maybe I did not
even understood how the "Publish my plugin" command will receive its
parameters. A thought: Maybe some rare administrative tasks should be
left to do from a browser otherwise we end up rewriting complex code
(encrypted authentification?...) that already exist in all browsers and
in all web frameworks.
Only my 2 cents!

I agree with you Mayeul: creating a new plugin in the new repo is
straightforward: just a matter of uploading a zipped file, all metadata are
read from the package itself.

I cannot see dramatic advantages of an uploading function from within QGIS.
BTW this could be quite easily done with a RPC call (RPC4Django handles this
quite well).

Instead, I would like to see a packaging and validating function for plugins
from within QGIS, this could really save some time and headaches.

Imagine that while developing a plugin, I go through the classical
code-test-code-test cycle and when the plugin is working fine I decide to
package and upload it. Personally, I use Makefiles to automate the packaging
steps, but since I've already coded a validating logic inside the new
plugins app [1], the same logic could be applied to a QGIS plugin that given
an installed plugin name can validate the metada and create the zipped
plugin, ready to be uploaded on the repo. The upload process itself could be
also automated but it's really just a click away.

are some Django dependencies but they can be easily removed.

Hi,
WMS reprojection should be fixed in sense that you get it rendered in
the right place, but quality and even content is not the same like for
not project on the same scale. Of course.

To find the best resolution coefficient is one thing which has to be
done. Higher resolution in WMS request can give you (really gives?)
slightly better image but the content becomes inappropriate. Currently
th QgsRasterReprojector is using just nearest neighbour, another
resampling methods should be considered.

Another issue is, that WMS driver does not automatically switches to
projection requested by QGIS even if it is supported by WMS server.
You have to manually select the right projection when layer is added.

Preferably, the WMS driver should not only to switch to the right
projection, but also automatically
select the most similar projection offered by server if no one exactly
matches. Anybody is aware of an algorithm or ready for use method
doing that?

Raster rendering appeared to be infinite entertainment.

I agree this is not the main point. The main thing is to have to do only
one operation to publish a plugin, not a series (preparing the zip,
uploading it, adding a redmine project, adding a git project, etc.).
Could you please add your thoughts to the roadmap, not to be forgotten?

Hello Devs,
A user (Dr. Jos? Carlos Guerrero) has contacted me recently with a
problem that appears to stem from Qt dialogs on MacOS:

Jos? is unable to specify output files from several of the fTools
tools where a save dialog should be popping up.

His install came from here: http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis and
the relevant particulars are here:
MACOSX 10.6.6
QGIS 1.6
ftools: 0.6.1

Any thoughts?

Which tools?  Is the Browse button missing for the output, or nothing happens when you click it?

I've seen odd Qt issues with different Qt versions and I have a couple builds I can test.

Thanks for the update on this, Radim. I see that there will be some challenges to work out with wms and reprojection. Thanks for you hard work and great dev efforts,
John

But since the rule-based rendering is currently in an incomplete state, why put it in the renderer stable release anyway? I believe symbol levels make a huge difference in rendering lines. With them, I have a rendering similar to Osmarender or Mapnik in QGIS which gives QGIS a definitive bonus with respect to many other desktop or server GIS.

Short version of my brain dump below: I don't see a reason why we
should support "apply first matching rule" because it would complicate
the whole renderer with virtually no added value. And I am not yet
sure what to do with the symbol levels issue. Interested readers
please continue reading :-)

Recently I have been thinking about the rule-based renderer a lot. The
symbol levels is not the only thing that needs our attention. I think
we all agree that ultimately we want to have some kind of
compatibility with SLD and/or Mapnik which (to my knowledge) are quite
compatible between each other. To summarize how they work:
- each (vector) layer is assigned one or more styles
- each style consists of a set of rules
- each rule consists of a scale range, a filter and one or more symbolizers
- a filter either matches all features or matches only features
according a query. There's also "else" filter that matches only if all
other rules do not match.
When rendering a vector layer, styles are rendered in the order they
appear in the input file. When rendering a style, for each feature
each rule is checked and the symbolizers are applied if the rule
matches.

Now let's face what we have in our rule-based renderer:
- a symbol layer is basically a symbolizer, a group of symbolizers
makes a symbol
- rule has the same meaning as in SLD/Mapnik, but there is no else filter
- there is nothing like style in the sense of SLD/Mapnik

So if you are drawing roads with outlines (our typical use case) in
SLD/Mapnik you can do this:
Style1
- Rule1
  - Line symbolizer1
  - Line symbolizer2
This will have the same effect as drawing without symbol levels
enabled: the rule is rendered at once for each feature. To get "symbol
levels" effect you need to do this:
Style1
- Rule1
  - Line symbolizer1
Style2
- Rule2
  - Line symbolizer2
First style1 is rendered, then style2 is rendered, getting the expected effect.

I wondered if we shouldn't introduce the notion "styles" in the
meaning of SLD/Mapnik for the rule-based renderer. That would mean
that the rules would be grouped into "styles", which would have
several implications:
- there would be no need to explicitly define symbol levels since the
effect would be attained in the way described above.
- this would also make possible to have just one painting algorithm
that would be the same as in SLD/Mapnik, so probably it would be
easier for users to understand how it works. Import/export would be
simple, with no complicated transforms
- we could also implement the "else" filter which is hard to achieve right now.
- it could solve various small issues with the GUI that pop up when
one thinks about ordering of the rules (which makes sense if not using
symbol levels, but unnecessary when symbol levels are turned on) and
other things like grouping.
- the upside of the "styles" would be also that they would allow
natural grouping of the rules, e.g. one style for roads at scale 1:10K
- 1:50K, one style for POI, one style for rivers.
The only downside I see here is that the symbols which are going to be
use the effect of overpainting - like the roads with outlines - have
to be split to bottom and top layer and applied in two different
styles. But I think that is a relatively low price given the
advantages. Finally, there are not that many symbols that would need
this effect.

Looking forward for your comments.

Martin

Hi Carson,

I am working through the tools to see where there might be problems on my end, but a list of the specific ones that gave him trouble would be helpful. 

The only problem I had was with Merge Shapefiles. If I tick the 'Select by layers in the folder', I cannot choose a folder in the dialog. The Ok button never becomes available when trying to select a folder. I can select a shapefile and the OK button is available. I might be misunderstanding what this option is intended to do. When turning it off, I can select a folder, but the tool crashed qgis. This was because my folder had mixed geometry types. See output below. I suppose this crash should be avoided somehow.

One random thought arose as I tested the tools. Why is the random select tool limited to 30 features?

Also, I have qt-4.7.1 and was using a current trunk build.

Cheers,
John

Hi John, I believ Jos? had problems with:

- Geoprocessing tools available as Intersect two layers
- Data management tools as Export to projection

The Ok button never becomes available when trying to select a folder. I can select a shapefile and the OK button is available. I might be misunderstanding what this option is intended to do.

Hmm, ok I'll look into this one, thanks for the update.

What? It shouldn't be? Unless your layer only has 30 features?

I don't find it as a usability problem. The present symbology is unusable 
unless you understand symbol levels, and the "sld" approach is as 
simple/complicated as the present one. And is of course more flexible. 

+1 for compatiblity with the way SLD chose.

Works for me.

Also works fine for me.

>> The only problem I had was with Merge Shapefiles. If I tick the 'Select by layers in the folder', I cannot choose a folder in the dialog. The Ok button never becomes available when trying to select a folder. I can select a shapefile and the OK button is available. I might be misunderstanding what this option is intended to do.

I hope it is easily solved.

Ok, tested again and it worked fine. I must have been working on a layer with only 30 features and did not make the connection there. It works as it should.

Cheers,
John

Why not :) I think also OSM Plugin deserves its own category (as many tickets 
as fTools).

Yes folks its our favourite time again - the time when we get to argue
about a name for the release and a topic for the splash. Of course
usual rules apply - if nobody comes up with good suggestions, I'll
just pick something :-) Now I've become kind of partial to the splash
screen in trunk. It includes many people from the developer community,
is aptly shaped as a Q to represent QGIS, and its kinda fun. Also, I
had a great time in Wroclaw. So in honour of our Polish hosts, I want
to suggest we call this release 'Wroclaw' and leave the splash screen
as it is. If those who couldn't make it to the hackfest feel too left
out, we can use a nice aerial picture of Wroclaw assuming our Polish
colleagues are able to dig up something nice for us....

Best regards

Tim

Hi,
Thanks all for sharing your thought on this. I find this discussion very
stimulating! Obviously each solution has some advantages and some
disadvantages. Here are my comments on Martin's answer.

kind of
compatibility with SLD and/or Mapnik"

I can understand the benefits of technical convergence. Still I do not
fully agree. From my personal point of view, my aim is not to have a
software compatible with Mapnik (usable only by expert users?), my aim
is to let less advanced users easily define their graphic semiology, to
bridge the gap between map makers and map users (one reason is that OSM
data is so rich that you can do thousands of different custom maps).
That's why I started working on a set of QGIS styles for OSM: I found it
too difficult to rewrite quantumnik styles to fit my needs.

In more general terms, the QGIS philosophy is somewhat different from
Mapnik's. Mapnik is aimed for expert users who do not mind defining
thousands of parameters in XML code. If I understood the aims of QGIS
correctly, QGIS is also for intermediate users who need to understand
how to use the software in a reasonable amount of time, and will use it
predominantly with the mouse.
Current osm.xml mapnik stylesheet has more than 7000 lines and about 640
filters.
There are 35 filters for [highway] = 'secondary' alone; those 35 filters
are in 7 different part of the osm.xml stylesheet. I suspect that only
developers say that Mapnik and osm.xml files are easy to understand, use
and modify. But QGIS should be useful for non-developers as well.

Anyway, I believe that there is some compatibility between the symbol
levels approach and the mapnik approach. The symbol layers are just a
way to organize the superposition of layers (drawing order information
is gathered in one place); the mapnik way is linear (order in file
defines drawing order), but ultimately (during the actual rendering)
both are translated into operations that follow the same logic. Thus it
is possible to convert a stylesheet from one system to the other and
vice versa.

In terms of usability, I think symbol levels win:
-----------------------------------
With symbol levels, rules are defined this way:

rule 5: [highway] = 'secondary' or [highway] = 'secondary_link'
- draw black road outline as layer 1
- draw orange road line as layer 12

-----------------------------------
Mapnik works this way:
rule 17: [highway] = 'secondary' or [highway] = 'secondary_link'
- draw black road outline

rule 18: [...]
....

...
rule 313: [...]
...

...
rule 314: [highway] = 'secondary' or [highway] = 'secondary_link'
- draw orange road line 
...
-----------------------------------
There is a 1-to-n relationship between a feature and its symbol layers;
this idea is simple and translates directly into the symbol levels
system. Mapnik model is redundant: it has to repeat the rule for each
symbol layer. (To make a comparison: in a relational database, this
would be considered bad practice).

My final comment on "we want to have some kind of compatibility with SLD
and/or Mapnik": If Mapnik were the best ever possible renderer and if it
would be possible (and easy!) to achieve every imaginable graphical
effect with it, then maybe it would be more efficient to build a
quantumnik GUI to modify those stylesheets, and use the Mapnik renderer
as the default QGIS renderer, instead of building a new renderer (or
trying to modify the existing rule-based renderer to make it resemble
mapnik).

##################
"implement the "else" filter which is hard to achieve right now."

My understanding is that a different type (but still useful) of "else"
logic is achieved with "apply first matching rule".
I described a useful extension to the "apply first matching rule" logic
here:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222#comment:16
(see bullet 1. in comment:16: For each rule, let the user say whether
(if this rule is matched) it should be the last rule tested)
####################

"The only downside I see here is that the symbols which are going to be
use the effect of overpainting - like the roads with outlines - have
to be split to bottom and top layer and applied in two different
styles. But I think that is a relatively low price given the
advantages. Finally, there are not that many symbols that would need
this effect."

My experience with OSM data is quite different. I currently have about
70 rules for OSM linear features. More than half of them use 2 to 3
symbol levels with overpainting across features. So for me using
overpainting is the rule, not the exception, if you want to have a
beautiful rendering. (And it is not limited to road outlines).

####################
Here are some additional comments and questions.

1. While designing the architecture, we should work with real cases:
pick up a mapping problem (for instance a region with some OSM data) and
see what kind of graphical effect we need there. Then, see which
solutions allow to do this easily, and which do not. I followed this
approach for the proposal I made here:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222#comment:16

2.There are two more things (related to this discussion) that I cannot
do currently with QGIS; ideally future improvements should solve those:

2a- simply use the OSM "Layer" tag (roads above other roads, etc.):
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Layer
To do this, currently 11 layers for each feature type are needed. One
solution could be to use symbol levels with a level modifier defined
based on a field.
The final symbol level could be defined as:
(Layer+5)*1000+[original symbol level]
(or simply Layer*1000+[original symbol level]   if we accept negative
levels or if the user modifies the Layer attribute first)
For instance, all roads with 'Layer'='-5' would be rendered with symbol
levels from 0 to 999.
All roads with 'Layer'='0' would be rendered with symbol levels from
5000 to 5999.

2b- define symbol levels across feature layers (for instance: most
linestrings should be ABOVE polygons, but some river linestrings should
be BELOW lake and riverbanks polygons, while still being above forest
polygons where relevant). Shapefiles cannot store heterogenous
geometries but postgis and spatialite can. Still if I'm correct QGIS
cannot take advantage of this yet.

3. An additional comment about the comparison with Mapnik:
The slippy-map mapnik rendering of OSM shows results at a limited number
of fixed scales. We want continuous zooming, so some of the problems we
are facing are not major problems for OSM Mapnik.

4. Probably it is possible to learn a lot from Mapnik to improve current
QGIS rendering. My question is: when shall this be available to the
users? Could that be for QGIS 1.7? Maybe not if there are no clear
answers on those questions so far. Still, today, with symbol levels, we
can have quite nice results.
I have uploaded a bigger example of rendering with symbol levels here:
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/QGIS
(QGIS wiki is not responsive right now).
Although not perfect, I believe it shows that QGIS could give fair
enough rendering with symbol levels. Without symbol levels, we will
probably not give QGIS users the opportunity to create "professional
maps" using rule-based rendering, to use Martin words:

Right, but I do not think there is a dev who wants to take this (which
is a problem on it own, BTW). Am I wrong?

Hi all.
The cleanup is going well: almost 10% less tickets in just a few days.
The list of bugs that must be fixed for release appears unclean:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&must_fix=Yes
Of course every reporter wants his bug to be fixed, but many of these
are not really showstoppers. In the few days left we cannot fix all
these.
Please have a look to the list, and remove what is not really crucial
for the release to happen. To me e.g. #3537 should be fixed.
Thanks.

My aim is not to create a copy of Mapnik. I just say that the way how
rules are defined and ordered in SLD / Mapnik makes more sense to me
since there is no need to make difference whether symbol levels are
on/off or whether just first rule or all matching rules are applied.

But QGIS is armed with a GUI which can simplify the editing greatly
and help with things like making copies of rules, refining the rules
etc. Therefore IMHO it _is_ useful also for non-developers. I hope we
will agree that rule-based renderer is _not_ for average users. It is
for power users. I believe one needs to be a power user when willing
to create sets of rules for rendering - average users should be fine
with simple classification into categories and/or ranges.

There are cases where the conversion wouldn't be 1:1, e.g. else
filter. In SLD/Mapnik you can define one or more else filters for each
style. So having a style for roads, you define a rule with else filter
for all roads that are not drawn otherwise. Then the same with a style
for railroads. In current design of rule-based renderer there's no
other way of implementing else than having a filter "not (filter1 or
filter2 or ...)".

I am aware of this disadvantage. Still I think it makes sense. For me,
setting symbol levels is much more cryptic task, because one has to
explicitly assign the rendering pass number for each symbol layer,
while this is done automatically in SLD/Mapnik by the order of styles.

And then is the confusion with the order of rules: with symbol levels
on, the order of rules can be arbitrary, since the rendering order is
defined by symbol levels. (However if we were going to apply only
first matching rule, the order would be important, but still
irrelevant from the rendering order!) If symbol levels are disabled,
the order of rules is important. Isn't this confusing? :-)

I am not saying that SLD/Mapnik is a solution for everything/everyone.
But for advanced symbology it works well. And if we are doing
something very similar it makes sense to make it compatible. Using
Mapnik for rendering in QGIS is not very interesting - we have all the
required functionality in place. I am not that interested in Mapnik
anyway, the thing that matters to me is SLD support.

Umm... doesn't this complicate the things even more? Imagine that you
have several dozens of rules and something does not render properly
just because "this is last rule" checkbox would be in wrong state. I
do not like this at all. I want something simple. Simple to implement,
simple to understand and simple to use.

OK, but OSM data is an example of very complex data. It's hard to find
any more complex rendering task than to render all OSM data nicely in
any scale. I think GUI for the rule-based renderer could simplify the
symbolization of line features with overpainting: first you would
create the rules you need for roads and assign symbols with multiple
layers. Then you would tell the GUI to take the style containing roads
and split it so that rules would be duplicated in new style(s),
getting the desired effect.

Yes this is welcome. It is however important not to consider only OSM
data as the only use case for rule-based renderer.

Ouch. I understand that this would help you a lot, but I am quite
reluctant to add such functionality. That would complicate the symbol
levels concept even more and just very few people would still

Neither QGIS is able to work with heterogenous data in one layer. I
would suggest splitting the data into several layers.

I believe the mapnik rendering of osm works with any scale, though
just few fixed scales are used for better performance.

It will be available once the concept is clear (a consensus among the
developers is reached) and someone implements it. There's no timeline.

I have seen some samples from you, they all look great!

Oh I see ;) I just thought about a technical solution: to make the category

'Select by layers in the folder' checkbox allow you to select and
merge only some shapes not all available in folder. This can be usefull
when in folder many shapes with different geometries or when you need
only to merge only certain files.

When this checkbox turned off tool will work with whole folder, but note
that there is no geometry checks and output file will have same geometry
as first pocessed file. This behaviour is fixed in separate MergeShapes
plugin from GIS-Lab. I'll port it to fTools soon.

Also there is a ticket http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3077 related to
Merge shapefiles tool crashes

=> Which useful stuff so you mean?

Eclipse and PyDev are open source and my Eclipse starts in about 5
seconds on my laptop (Win XP with an Intel Centrino and uses 200MB
memory i.e. less than Firefox).

The requirements of my "modern SW developer environment" are syntax
highlighting, autocompletion, unit testing und debugging. Eclipse
seems to deliver that. We also tested Eric4, SPE, PythonWin (Windows
only), IDLE and PyPE where Eric and SPE seem to be most promising.
Spyder, JEdit etc. are to me rather text programming editors, not
IDEs.

Eclipse and probably all other IDEs/Editors can set PATHs to external
libraries.
=> With which software did you get problems?

@all => What Python IDEs/Editors are other QGIS developers using?

As Martin said, it must be possible to get external compiling,
debugging and unit testing with QGIS to work since there QGIS
libraries can als be used for developing custom applications based on
QGIS API. I'll report on that.

Yours, S.

Tom, are you still active for Mac QGIS programming?

Or are there any other Mac programmers out there that can look at it?

I think I figured out why double-clicking a project file or GIS file won't open in QGIS (though it activates QGIS) (bug http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2793), but it's way beyond me to do anything about.  See last comment in the bug.

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

Hi Alexander,

Thanks for the explanation. Yes, the improved plugin would be beneficial for many, I suspect. How does your plugin handle mixed geometries? That led to a crash with the ftools plugin.

Cheers,
John

Message-ID: <AANLkTimNX_rX-bk7cGDkA3D3wSanTJTGB=9uA2e7tdCj@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
am I right that repeating - copying comments of reimplemented virtual
methods in data provider header file is not desired? Currently it is
common practice to do that, but once I have heard somewhere, that
duplicating data is not the best practice...

Is it possible in docs to get description from parent class virtual
method comments if a method is not described in child? At this moment
providers are not included in docs
(http://doc.qgis.org/head/classes.html) but they could be in future.

I know that the Value Tool is a 3rd party plugin, but it would be nice if
the raster-provider could work with it.  All of my rasters are reported as
being "out of extent".

In MergeShapes plugin there is a combobox that allow to select shapes
with which geometry type should be merged. E.g. when selected 'Polygon'
only polygonal shapes from folder processed all other are ignored.

The Value Tool is using layer.identify(mapPos). The layer itself knows
nothing about the srs set in canvas. The easiest way to fix it is to
transform mapPos in Value Tool from canvas to raster layers crs
(attention, may be different for data source crs if assigned by user).

I think that it may be fixed after the merge to trunk, because it will
have to check QGIS version to decide if mapPos has to be projected or
not. Right?

I tested your updates in the raster branch today. Things look real good from my examination of the WMS capabilities. I did have a problem with the extents occasionally jumping to some very different location, but I would not consider this a show stopper. Again, this was with a WMS layer being reprojected, but no other rasters.

Cheers,
John

Hi,
To help  the use of OSM data in QGIS:
I created a bash script to automate the installation and configuration
of postgresql, to create a database (with postgis and hstore), to
download and run osmosis, load the data into postgres and process them
for displaying them on QGIS. The first steps are optional.
The script is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/osm2postgresql/

The idea came from kimaidou's comment below.
It's not yet for linux beginners. It still needs some improvement but
with it I can do all the above in one command line. Ultimately I would
like to incorporate it somehow into QGIS to have a new OSM viewer. (I
discussed this with spatialite's developer but some postgres functions
are missing in sqlite.)

Hi again Martin,
Thanks for your notes. Below is a proposal for a compromise.
I see the long term advantages of converging to something compatible
with SLD and you gave good arguments in favor of this approach. Yet,
since I find a few advantages in the other approach, I cannot say that I
prefer one solution over the other in the long term (I will only be able
to tell which I prefer after testing intensively the SLD approach with a
GUI). So I've nothing against it as a long term direction, except for
one comment (with a proposed fix) and one question:
-----------------
Comment about:
"I think GUI for the rule-based renderer could simplify the
symbolization of line features with overpainting: first you would
create the rules you need for roads and assign symbols with multiple
layers. Then you would tell the GUI to take the style containing roads
and split it so that rules would be duplicated in new style(s),
getting the desired effect."

Your suggestion is to create SLD rules in two steps (instead of one),
the second step being non-reversible. After the second step, there is no
preview anymore of the multiple layers of a given symbol.
Imagine you create a rule for a road (with outline), then split the
rule, then you are not satisfied with the result and you want to
fine-tune the symbol.
You would need to do the following:
1. open the style of the inner line
2. Click "change..."
3. Make the changes
4. Close the style of the inner line
5. Search for the style of the outline (corresponding filter for the
same road) and open it
6. Click "change..."
7. Make the changes
8. Close the style of the outline
9. Click apply.
10. Wait before the map is refreshed. Search for the result directly on
the map.
11. Start again from step one since the result is not what you want.
It would be very tedious to design multi layer symbols without the
symbol preview.
In the current symbol layer implementation: the following steps are
unnecessary: 4,5,6,8,9,10; and the steps 1 and 4 need to be done only
once even if you need ten trials.
So, if you have 2 layers for a line and you need 5 trials (that's quite
conservative), your proposal requires you to you make 33 mouse clicks
more than with the current implementation (5*5 + (5-1)*2). (Only if you
can do step 5 in one single click).

You could keep your proposal the way it is ("SLD view"), but have a
radio button to switch from the SLD view to another view which would be
similar to the current "No grouping" view (which in fact would be "group
by filter and scale"): for a given scale range, it would group all rules
that have a common filter; double-clicking on one row would allow to
open a window identical to the "Rule properties": you would then modify
all the layers in single window, and define the legend as well. The
changes will be saved in the different underlying rules (the ones
displayed in the "SLD view").
This way, the different views will reflect the different tasks, while
being consistent with the underlying SLD model. What do you think?


----------------
Question: I'm not sure about how SLD behaves.
There are two tasks that the user want to performs:
1. assign the desired symbology (all levels) to a given feature
2. assign the drawing order to all symbol parts
Both tasks are separated with the approach I suggested (symbol levels
with rules saying if rules later in the list should be tested). So a
rule near the bottom (a rarely matched rule then) can end up drawing
something *below* all the other layers. My understanding is that SLD
cannot do this (or might only if you put many AND NOT conditions in the
previous filters?).
Question is: Is it possible (and easy) to separate those two tasks with
the SLD approach?

I think this question is related to what you wrote:
"However if we were going to apply only
first matching rule, the order would be important, but still
irrelevant from the rendering order!"
That's an advantage if it means it separates tasks 1 and 2 mentioned
above.
---------------

This discussion is for long term plans as you said. In the short term,
if possible, Tim's proposal of committing the patch in the release
branch only would be great ;-) This would allow me to share my OSM
rendering and let users modify it.

You wrote:"I have seen some samples from you, they all look great!"
Thank you! I'm glad you like them.

All the best,
Mayeul

Paolo,

It seems like your thoughts are quite different than mine.... IMHO it would
be sufficient to create a QGIS plugin that helps in the packaging and
uploading phase.

But it seems you want to go further and have a mechanism to automate the
initial creation of a plugin development infrastructure (git, redmine etc).
This is a much more complex task and implies some (to be carefully
evaluated) interaction with other components (like git or redmine) with all
security and system-level problems.

So, I will add a note on the wiki about the first phase but it's better if
you add a detailed description about what's in your mind about the second
phase. I remember a discussion in September about this, but I cannot
remember that we reached a decision about where to go.

I agree that having an easy way to setup all the stuff will stimulate people
to use it. But are we sure that every plugin author will be willing to use
all the machinery (git, redmine etc.)  ?

Can we use this time (before the hackfest) to talk about and reach a
decision about this further improvements of the plugins website ?

If we do not reach a firm conclusion about this before, I think the HF
is our best chance.
All the best.

Hi

By the way I just wanted to add that the process of registering a
plugin from within QGIS can easily be achieved just by popping up a
QWebView control with url pointed to the appropriate page. I am using
this same technique for a 'first run' wizard I am working on that will
allow the user to register on the users map.

Regards

Tim

Perfect, I have pushed Your work to 'master' branch in Github repo
(with some changes: see git log) and also added You to contributors,
so You have write permissions. Push Your further work there or fork
me.

Yes, I have fixed that few weeks ago.

But the problems I am facing now are related to compatibility - I was
unable to reach 100% compatibility with vector layer API until now.
The functions select() and nextFeature() in both QgsVectorLayer and
QgsVectorDataProvider may cause various problems with threading. I
have implemented a new approach with QgsFeatureIterator class which
encapsulates these methods and they should be safe. We need to support
those original API methods, but they may cause havoc when they are run
while rendering in threads. QGIS application can be simple modified to
use just the new (safe) API using QgsFeatureIterator, but what about
all the plugins??

Therefore I wonder if the merge shouldn't be postponed until we start
transition to 2.0, otherwise we may end up with either deadlocks or
data corruptions. (Yes, threads are evil.)

Other possibility would be to merge just stuff that is safe to merge
(various optimizations and refactorings) and keep back the threading
until we can break backward compatibility.

Comments?

Hi devs

recently I wondered why we still have the whole QGIS app gui
construction (actions, menus, toolbars) in the QgisApp class. I
remember that in the early Qt4 days this was necessary since there was
no support in Qt Designer to create menus/toolbars. But nowadays it is
perfectly possible, so for me it makes sense to move that part of code
to a .ui file and use the usual setupUi() call for the main window.
That could save up to 1000 lines of code in the QgisApp class!

Any objections?

+1 for moving it all to the ui file.  Would make things a lot nicer and

The value tool plugin is so useful (and fundamental) when doing raster
analysis that I wish to see it become "core" one of these days.

Is it not possible to reimplement the old methods as thin wrappers
around the new QgsFeatureIterator class and at the same time mark them
in doxygen as deprecated? Sorry I havent looked in the code itself so
it may be a dumb question.

With regards to API backwards comptability, we have been pretty good
at maintaining it to now, though its a thing we strive for and not
absolutely guarantee and if our docs / wiki etc say otherwise we
should adjust them. The one time we broke it in the 1.x series was
because we had no other choice IIRC. For me getting your work into
trunk now is important as it will give us a window of around 6 months
for it to be 'gorilla tested' by 100k+ users out there before we
release it in 2.0.

An alternative option is that we just freeze our 'stable' releases at
1.6 (or maybe a last 1.7 release with no threading) and jump right on
to doing 1.9.x releases in the run up to September. However I would
rather put the things we are developing into mainstream releases since
(I know some people hate this idea) our users are also our testers.

Thanks for information, great that You solved GIL issues. On the other
hand, I see Python plugins as killer feature in QGIS, so any un-user
friendly breakage there is really bad idea, even if it will move on
development.

I think keeping big features like threading for version 1.9-2.0 with
long testing period will bring better light on QGIS project than
featurefull, but problematic version now.

Thanks for Your great work.

This is how it is already done in the branch.

But that's not enough for the compatibility. The iterator classes
always lock their source of data (layer/provider) in order to make
sure that only one thread accesses the data. So far so good. Now
imagine that we are running rendering of several vector layers (A,B,C)
in a separate thread. The rendering of A and B is in progress,
rendering of C is waiting. Now the user triggers an action in GUI that
starts iterating over layer C (using nextFeature() calls). If it
iterates just over few features, the layer C will stay locked
(expecting that more features will be fetched). Rendering of layer C
will therefore get stuck waiting for the lock - infinitely.

This is probably not the most common scenario, but having cases like
this might severly disturb the vector access in some cases.

I am not sure where to go from here. I think recently we had quite
decent releases with mostly stable features. This is a bit different
situation where we are one week before the feature freeze for 1.7
release - merging such amount of changes in core libraries seems quite
risky. I think if the threaded rendering appears in early 1.9.x
releases it should get quite a lot of testing anyway. Anyway, my
impression is that 90% of bug reports are from people who use the most
recent version (if not svn trunk).

Well, microsoft has been always beta-testing software on their
_paying_ users for more than two decades - and look how successful
they have been with that strategy :-D

One more thing: I would also suggest removing status bar tips from the
actions - they have exactly the same wording like action text /
tooltip in most cases. And I wonder who would actually look into
status bar for some help for the actions :-)

This is planned - I dont know if it will be for 1.7. I plan to add a
new menu called 'Map' where such things can be accessed - and they
will be moved into core functionality.

I suggest then if we are unsure, that we leave it out for 1.7 unless
you want to make a renderer2 to go with symbology2 and
labelling2...heheh :-) Only kidding.....

Based on the preceeding discussion I would then suggest we make 1.7
our last stable release before 2 and embark on 1.9.x unstable releases
running up to sept.

We already have a number of new features for 1.7 (hopefully including the 
raster provider branch). So for me it would be ok to have 1.7 as the last API 
compatible release and doing the threading branch merge just after the 
branching for 1.7.

Anyway, it would be good to merge the changes from trunk into the threading 
branch already now. Like this, people who need e.g. the globe plugin could 
work with the threading branch sources until 1.7 is branched. Additionally, it 
is easier to test the threading branch in productive work with all the fixes 
and new features from trunk.

Marco

I thought I will do it the other way round: to create a new branch
from trunk (e.g. threading_branch2) and merge the commits from
threading_branch there. Looks easier to port those few dozens of
commits rather than porting nearly 2000(!) commits from trunk back to
the branch.

Btw. what functionality from threading branch is required by the globe plugin?

Hi Devs,

One of my favorite outcomes from developing fTools, is actually when
one or two fTools functions become redundant due to new features in
base QGIS. The reason isn't because that means one less tool for me to
worry about, but rather because it means things are progressing... and
with QGIS things are progressing big time! In that vein, I would like
to propose several tool 'retirements' from fTools. While I tend to
feel that several ways to do the same thing is helpful/good, it can
also get confusing if those different procedures produce varying
results. As such, I think it would be appropriate to retire the
following tools:
- Export/add geometry columns (this can now be done quite easily from
the field calculator, and my version appears to have issues with
certain vector formats)
- Export to new projection (this can now be achieved by "Sav[ing] a
layer as...")
- Join attributes (this was never really meant as a 'solution', but
rather a temporary 'hack' to allow for table joints, but it is slow
and combersome, and requires the creation of a new field, whereas the
new join capabilities are excellent, fast, and excellent!)
- fTools information (nobody needs to know what fTools is anymore, and
frankly, this info should really be part of the help system and
documentation... also, I think this dialog often interferes with
help/about on macs?)

Some other potential 'retirees' are:

- Select by location (I think there is a 'Spatial Query' plugin which
has this functionality plus much more, and appears to be quite fast)
- Define current projection (Is this covered by the new 'Set CRS of
Layer(s)' tool? I haven't had much of a play with this one yet, but it
sounds like it should, and is more convenient being part of the main
GUI)

Let me know what you think. Should these be completely retired, or
should they perhaps just be wrappers around their replacements to keep
things familiar? I think I'd be leaning more towards full retirement,
which should hopefully promote doing things 'the right way' (i.e.
using the new core QGIS functionality).

Regards,

Carson

the field calculator misses to compute the perimeter of the polygons.
Once it will do it you can retire "Export/add geometry columns" ;)

I find your solution more intuitive for newbies, and I would like to
keep it, at least for now. Can calculator extract x and y from points?

Agreed.

It is a piece of history, and it is nice to give credits to your work,
but it is true that now it seems a bit out of place.

Right, even though the spatial query is more complex to use.

AFAIK, the properties define a projection at runtime, whereas your tool
actually writes a prj file. Am I wrong?

BTW, I think now fTools could often avoid writing new shapefiles, just
adding the new info on the existing layer instead (e.g. points in
polygons, etc.).
Would this be hard?
All the best.

No it can't, and perimeter calculation seems to be an issue as well.
Ok, well then I might change this to be a wrapper around the field
calculator, that way it will be intuitive for beginners, and still
have the added functionality of x and y values and perimeter.

I'll just move all the 'credit' related info to where it belongs in
the main QGIS about dialog I think. I don't like how it looks the way
it is now, and for the most part, fTools is now referred to as the
Vector menu, so beginners probably don't even know what fTools is....

Hmm, yes I tested it just now. It is a bit more complicated, but not
overly so... thoughts from others?

True, it does write the prj file, but I'm talking about the new

I crazy?

Not overly hard no, and there are really only a few tools that this
would apply to.

One thing I'd really like to do is add the capability to output other
formats besides shapefiles (I'm not a big shapefile fan these days,
field name limitations are a hassle). I might try move over the
geometry and geoprocessing tools first, as they seem to be the most
frequently used tools.

Yes, but your join by location feature is exceptional and needs to remain. I don't know of any alternative to that. It has been a life saver on several occasions for me. (Think grass v.to.rect, do something r.*, r.to.vect --> oops, I know longer have attributes!)

Thanks for your great contributions, as always.

Agreed, this could be easier than the other way round.

osgEarth requests a lot of tiles from the maprenderer and it is very easy to 
conflict with the rendering of the qgis canvas. So afaik the main feature it 
needs from the branch are the feature iterators in the providers.

Hi Martin

I'm also in favour of a rule based renderer that follows closely the logic of 
SLD. It would be a big plus for QGIS server too. Currently, it's SLD 
capabilities are built on top of the old renderer, so no overpainting, etc.

And yes, with a nice GUI, it will be as user-friendly as the other parts of 
the symbology.

Marco

The globe plugin reads the layer list and calls the QGIS to render tiles and 
draping them on the globe. Since this is done in a separate window, a refresh 
in the 2D map window crashes QGIS as long as parallel rendering is not 
supported.
Using locks during rendering is more difficult than e.g. from the print composer 
because there are many more calls and the globe engine is running multiple 
threads itself.

Maybe it is better to create in-memory layer and let user to save it in
some desired format using Save As... option from layer context menu?

Just a thought - x and y in the field calculator require a couple of clicks. 
In the ftools you can do it by one click...

Hmmmm implementing other file formats to the QgsVectorFileWriter is quite 
easy, while AFAIK writing to the memory layer requires another approach. Maybe 
we should encapsulate the QgsVectorFileWriter to provide an universal class 
for the 1.7 API? Just a thought - it's late and my brain is busy with a few 
other threads ;)

My preference would be to add the capability to write to other
formats. Writing to a memory layer can become unwieldy when working
with large layers (which is common with geoprocessing operations).

Actually I think there's no simple answer what is better. I prefer to use 
memory layers as long as it's possible. So I'd prefer to see three options:

- save to memory layer [...name...] and add to the canvas
- save to file [...path...] and add to the canvas
- save to file [...path...] and don't add to the canvas

Btw. When saving to files, kinda garbage collector would be extremely usable:)

Garbage collector? You mean memory-wise, or temporary file type garbage?

I would like to see one more option on that list:

   - Save to current selected layer

This would write straight back to the current selected layer.  I don't
always want a new layer when doing things like buffers etc.

+1 And it should be probably implemented in qgis libs for easy use in plugins.

So a tool to delete vector(s)/raster(s) and associated files.
Something like a open file dialog where you can select x number of
QGIS supported vector/raster files, and delete them all in one go?
That *would* be handy...

Yes please to this option (fTools writing to a memory layer)!! 

I was thinking of coding for a couple of the fTools functions I used myself.  It would be great to have it in fTools by default :-)

Note: I've uploaded a memory saver plugin that allows memory layers to be persisted alongside the project file (MemoryLayerSaver plugin).  

In discussing this before I've suggested that this should really be a core function .. The memory layers shouldn't disappear without warning when you save and reopen a project.  This provoked some discussion and different points of view.  For example where and in what format should the memory layer data be stored.  

I also think that if you save a memory layer to a persistant format, then at least optionally the saved layer could replace the existing memory layer (ie replace the memory data provider with the provider for the saved version and retain the symbology and z order placement).  

Perhaps replacing the provider in this way should be option whenever any vector layer is saved, as memory layers don't look different to  any other to the user.  

Moving to using the memory layers as a working layer for tools would make this a much more valuable enhancement.

Cheers
Chris

Maybe it is better to create in-memory layer and let user to save it in some desired format using Save As... option from layer context menu?

Ok, but we have to be careful here... because overwriting a layer that
we are currently working on could lead to problems when the data
provider tries to access features that have been overwritten/erased.
Also, what about the case where we have a line layer that we are
buffering?

Hi Stefan, All,
coming from webdesign I use Aptana (eclipse derivation) with pydev with
success. Eclipse itself always managed to drive me crazy for some
reasons... I tried as well spe and erich and didn't like the feeling.
Ggeany and gedit with many plugins are very light but Aptana/pydev is
what suits my needs best.

Ok, I'm getting the overwhelming feeling that people want to be able
to 'write' to memory layers. I'll try to add this functionality.
However, I really don't think this should be the 'default' or
primary/sole output type. I think what I'll probably do is simply add
'output options' to the current output file dialog, such that users
can choose memory layer (this might require some work on a more
generic vector file writer), shapefile, kml, whatever...

The legend interface has been evolving a bit ad-hoc. I believe first
there was just groups() function, then groupLayerRelationship() has
been added for some other purpose and probably after all that support
for sub-groups has been added. So the result is not a bug, they just a
traverse the tree in a different way.

I have no strong opinion on that.

But I think that it would be much better to implement a method that
would return the complete tree.
For example, there would be a class "legend node". A node could be
either a layer or a group. Layer node would reference layer (or its
ID) and group node would contain a list of all children (again layers
and/or groups). Legend interface would then just return a list of
top-level nodes. Nothing complicated, simple for traversal and no need
for extra methods.

Yes, exactly :) Nobody says it should be the only option. But about the 
default... well ;)

Yes. And also a reverse possibility: to select a few layers to save and remove 
everything else. Of course, for a safety, it shoud sort and filter files by a 
timestamp (like clearing data in Firefox).

There are only few things in this world that I hate. One of them is saving to

I think overwriting an existing layer in memory is not a good practice.

?Updating existing geometry or attribute data would be great, such as when one merges two themes, and when the second theme is only contributing matching attribute. But overwriting should at least not be the default behavior.? 

While using Python, I always feel it is not good that it wants to create a new even if the data I am adding is a dbf file. I think that is not helpful, there should be an option to append the data (this may apply to both the geometry and attribute) or make an new one.

Thank you,

Maaza

Where is this "spatial query". I updated a Win XP machine last 
night to the latest 1.7 with OSGeo4W setup, and I don't find 
any spatial query?

In any case, I like your suggestion to put wrappers to all 
these new plugins (C++ also) under the "Vector" menu. THere's 
been a lot of discussion regarding consolidating plugins under 
categories /menu topics to make things easier to find. Any 
spatial query tools should, in my opinion appear under the 
Vector menu.
In fact, the new Join Attributes option, which is now a tab in 
the layer properties window might also find a place under Vector.
Furthermore, there's the MMQGIS set of vector tools, some of 
which duplicate fTools functions (i.e. merge shapefile). 
Perhaps an effort to organize all these tools in one place 
would be worthwhile.

Thanks,

Hi devs,

I agree with Marco and Martin : following the SLD logic would be great. It
would help a lot people used to SLD to understand the logic of Qgis styling.
I also think we should keep the logic easy to understand while not loosing
too much power.

Talking about SLD import/export... Using Qgis as a wysiwyg tool to create
and share great styles would be awesome. But we must keep in mind SLD
specifications do not cover all the features we could imagine/have in Qgis.
If we go toward the SLD way (+1 for me), and be able to export/import
from/to SLD we would need to have kind of a "table of features" to compare
what can be done in Qgis and not trhough SLD (and the way around).

For example, the new labelling engine allows to write labels following
lines. As described in the SLD Cookbook (see [1] and [2]) we would need to
mimic geoserver "vendorOptions" tag when exporting from Qgis to SLD.

By the way, you must have seen the new SaveAsSLD plugin made by Adrian
Weber. He told me he will now focus on supporting new symbology. I am trying
to help him and will when I find time. While reading this post, I was
thinking it would help a lot if Qgis logic followed the SLD one :)

Oops, perhaps I was misleading here. I do not intent to 'wrap' any
*plugins* within the Vector menu! Only some of the new *core*
functions. The Vector menu is a set of 'out of the box' functions
based on the QGIS core library functions, and as such only contains
code that I can 'vouch for'. I think it is important to separate the
plugins from the core functions for many reasons, the primary reason
being that if we wrap plugins into the Vector menu, we will get a
bunch of bug reports on tools in this menu that should really be
reported to the plugin author, or using the new plugin web interface.

I haven't had much luck with the MMQGIS plugin myself, but it would
certainly be a good idea to organize the plugins in general. I know
there has been a lot of talk about this, but again, it is my feeling
that the 'plugins' should be organised separately from the core
functions/menus, like the Vector and Raster menus.

Agreed. That's why I insist (sorry, I know I'm bothering) we need a
common development platform for plugins, so that developers can
collaborate in reorganizing menus and fix each other.
Comments?
All the best.

This could be a fairly simple addition to QGIS file browser plugin.
A very useful one, BTW.
Could you add a wish to the trac?

Are you talking about my FileBrowser plugin, if so I was thinking about
adding support to delete and rename files some time in the future just have
been super busy and haven't had a chance.  If someone wants to try it for me
the code is up on https://github.com/madmanwoo/QGIS-File-Browser you can
just fork and do what you need.   I will happily take any help.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GdalTools: allow to set output size for those
	tools that need it
In-Reply-To: <459642382.7541.1299586982297.JavaMail.root@mail.thehumanjourney.net>
Message-ID: <1058438701.7560.1299587085980.JavaMail.root@mail.thehumanjourney.net>

Dear all,

I just noticed that there is no way to set the output cell
size (resolution) in GdalTools and QGIS 1.6.
Unfortunately, this renders tools like "gdal_grid" and
"gdal_rasterize" unusable.

I found a discussion of this issue here:

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2941

And it ends on a note setting of "extents" has now been
implemented. But it seems that setting the output
resolution (cell size) has still not been implemented.

Would it be possible to implement the setting of GDAL
output resolution for QGIS 1.7.0? It should be as
straight-forward as the extent setting.

Best,

Ben

Thanks for the patch greatly appreciated, I have applied it and have pushed
a new branch (https://github.com/madmanwoo/QGIS-File-Browser/tree/renametest)
to my github account while I test and add some things, mainly error
handling, to it then I will make merge and release.

Thanks again.

BTW: QGIS File Browser plugin seems to forget about its setting at every
startup of QGIS. It would be good to have it always in place, memebering
folder state etc.
Thanks.

It compiles now.  But something is wrong, I think with that whole ui file change - crash for me on OS X:

The following workaround may shed some light on the source of the problem:

Comment out the first line of retranslateUI in ui_ggisapp.h 
(MainWindow->setWindowTitle)

This suggests to me that something needed by setWindowTitle for this 
object may not be initialized yet.

Hmm... would it help to completely remove windowTitle property from
main window in qgisapp.ui file?

Removing the windowTitle property from qgisapp.ui works for me. The 
title after startup is "Quantum GIS r15387M" so it's still being set 
somewhere later.

Dear hackers,

As a member of the Orfeo Toolbox "core" development team, I propose to 
join you at the next HackFest in Lisbon.

This would be a great occasion to discuss with you about :
- the image processing needs in QGis, and how they can eventually be 
fulfilled by OTB.
- the UI / end-user application needs of OTB users, for which we feel 
Qgis is a very serious option.

I could show to those interested what we've done with QGis recently, and 
will be glad to get some direct feedback.
Also, I know there is currently a huge initiative on raster providers, 
and that it's been an idea to have an OTB implementation supporting 
streaming, in memory images, etc... .
We did not follow the latest devs very closely, but that would be a good 
occasion to exchange ideas, and maybe get my hand on some code around this.

As OTB is primarily a C++ library, I'm also particularly interested in 
the C++ plugin functionnalities of Qgis, so if you need some help to add 
functionnalities to them, this might also be something I can work on.


Does the idea suit you ?

Regards,
Julien

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Icons disappearing when opening attribute table
Message-ID: <AANLkTin7GrSorRLL7ZZCHR0asNZtnHz5b+XomyoEYx8=@mail.gmail.com>

Hi can anybody confirm following behavior ?

Would You please configure Your QGIS to "Open attribute table in dock
window", load this example data [1] and choose Layer -> Open Attribute
Table ?

In my case attribute table window is opened with blank buttons without
any icons. Icons will appear when moving mouse cursor over. The same I
can reproduce when resizing attribute table window. It seems that this
behavior occurs when some bigger shapefile with longer rendering time
(> 5 seconds) is loaded. When using attribute table in separate window
(not in dock window), icons are loaded correctly.

Software details:
OS: Debian Squeeze - Gnome, standard Clearlooks theme using Clearlooks buttons
QGIS: Trunk (I remember this behavior for versions in last few weeks)

If somebody can confirm, I will open ticket.
Thanks, Ivan

hi Ivan!

Testet and confirmed.. no Icons appear - only when you move mouse cursor
over it ..

Tested latest trunk version r15392

so you can open a ticket..

Finally! :-) It's impressing. I observe two issues only:

1. Histogram stretch doesn't work with OTFR enabled (both tools: the one in 
layer context menu and the one in toolbar). By the way, why there are the two 
tools for stretching? The one in toolbar works with grayscale rasters only, 
while the one in the layer context menu seems to work always.

2. GDAL TMS layers don't work. I get a warning messageBox:

Cannot ChunkAndWarpImage : Integer overflow : nSrcXSize=1048576, 
nSrcYSize=1048576

This is, for example, a TMS source that doesn't work any more:

Works beautifully (I'm looking at a reprojected alaska landcover test
dataset as I type this)! One comment though: The Debug output is
*extremely* verbose... as in... it looks like the matrix screen with
numbers running down my console ;-) Is this necessary?

Sounds like a plan, I'll add that to the TODO list not sure when I'll get to
it though.

Of course if anyone else would like to have a go at it I would be quite
happy to take it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to handle errors when loading the project
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E06DA9F6033@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All

I've recently had problems with loading project files and think it would be good to change the handling of this a bit!

First a bit of background.

My problems originally came from the changes to the delimited text provider to use Qurl.fromLocalFile as the datasource.  I think this is a great change - but it does break existing project files.  Also it isn't consistently implemented where the datasource is used in QgsMapLayer and QgsHandleBadLayers.  I've submitted a patch to fix this http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3570

But then I had problems with missing symbology information in my project files.  I've no idea why this was, but the result was that the layer failed to load, and I got the bad layer handler dialog (great improvement on the original one by one handling BTW).  The problem is that this only lets me reselect the file to load into the layer under the assumption that the layer isn't loading because the file has moved.  So in my case I can browse and reselect the correct file, but the layer still doesn't load as the symbology is still bad.
This is very confusing from a user's perspective.

There are certainly valid cases, apart from the apparent corruption in my project file, when a symbology won't load.  For example a user may have removed a renderer plugin.  

I've proposed a short term "fix" in http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3572, which is to revert to a default symbology if the layer cannot be loaded.

End of background.

This raises the question of how to deal well with project load errors.  Ideally the user should get a message indicating what the problem is, and some options as to how to deal with it.  And this requires a means of recording this information as the project is loading, which is independent of the GUI, and then displaying it and handling it in the GUI.

Where should this be stored?  

Thinking aloud now, one option would be to add error/warning status information to the projects and layers.  Say a QgsErrorStatus class (StringLists for errors, and warnings?).  The QgsProject and QgsMapLayer could have mLoadErrors members with this information (slight problem with layers if the object is deleted when it fails to load!).  

So far fairly easy!  The question I then have is how to handle the errors.  Maybe it needs something more sophisticated like a base error class, and subclasses which can override a handleError method?  How would this interface with the GUI? With the project? Or with the project DOM?

Any thoughts on good implementation patterns?

Cheers
Chris

2) Enable   "on the fly" with CRS WG84/Geographic (EPSG 4326)
3) Zoom to layer extent * Crash

I can confirm this with this data.

It is further than I get with my datasets. I usually only get to step 2, and the datum is unimportant.

It's quite annoying because it means that any dataset I have with a raster, and "on the fly" selected causes qgis-dev to crash.

-ramon.

Hi,
a bit more verbosity is necessary in this stage, I have commented the
matrix output however.

No idea. Each one is calling different method :
toolbar -> QgisApp::localHistogramStretch()
c. menu -> QgsLegend::legendLayerStretchUsingCurrentExtent()

It should use just one method and it should be moved to QgsRasterLayer.
But which one? QgsLegend::legendLayerStretchUsingCurrentExtent() may
also change drawingStyle and there is a comment in the code:
// Note: Do we really want to do these next clauses? The user will get

I will update the toolbar to use the same method - it should work for
multiband imagery too. I think I copied the context menu one when I
did the toolbar but maybe I am wrong....I'll update it.

Hi

really impressive! What is the behaviour with WMS layer reprojection? It
seems that QGIS is still doing some reprojection/resampling when OTF
reprojection is enabled but the server is able to serve the desired
projection.

regards
Stefan

Hi all.
I added some details to the topics:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/5._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Lisbon_2011#Topics
It started as a simple thing, but it may now be a bit too much - feel
free to move it elsewhere.
I quickly reviewed our web infrastructure, and I think it is getting
*really* too complex. Any thoughts?
All the best.

Looking forward to it. If you are interested in maintaining it, I would
suggest to include it in trunk, otherwise the installation of C++
plugins is out of reach for most users.
See you in Lisboa then!
All the best.

Does it crash if you open an old qgs project or if you start qgis and
add new layers manualy?

Hi all!

I  tried to load a simple jpg (without any projection information) into
QGIS just to test ..
It unfortunately leads to a segfault ..
Then i thought to georeference the file first ... and opened the
georeferencer plugin .. but it seems the georeferencer plugin uses the
same mechanism to load the jpg as qgis itself .. so nothing showed up
and I were not able to georeference the raster file ..

It seems that there whould be some defaults for rasterfiles without any
projection information. Otherwise it is not possible to create
georeferenced files any more..

Anyone can confirm this?

best regards
Werner

I've just found that Map tips do not work (values not displayed) for a
utm layer that is displayed
within a project in another projection (i.e., google Mercator) with
reprojection on the fly activated
(the actual display of the layer is correct).
Map tips works fine for the same layer on its original projection.
Using qgis 1.6 on ubuntu 10.04. Could anybody else also check this problem?

confirmed: in reprojected rasters the value tool returns always "out of

I think there's actually a logical reason to not move the main qgis
tracker at this time. It's well established where it is and we don't
want people confusing the main core app with the plugins. I'm also well
aware that hosting on our platform is a suggestion (a strong suggestion)
so we should really just lead by example and see if developers like the
idea enough to move, or start a tracker.

Pooling all the plugin tracking to Hub was why I pushed so hard to get
it installed, so yes feel free to start moving stuff over. The only
feature not implemented yet is https login, but I think that will only
take an hour or two if we ask Pirmin.

Thanks,
Alex

I'm not sure about that but will look into it. Redmine seems to have
some funny thing about not allowing anything to be deleted (Projects,
users etc). I think it has something to do with the data integrity of
related tables. My guess is that it's intended to prevent the orphaning
of related code repos.

Thanks,
Alex

I can open an existing 1.6 or 1.7 project, or I can work through Luiz's process below.

-ramon.

Hi all,

I added "Python plugin development tools" among topics of next code
sprint. I'll try to get some debugging/testing tools working for that
moment. Here are what we have so far:

I do not confirm this on Ubuntu 10.04 r15395. It works fine here.

But the crash is confirmed (also) under Windows Seven, Osgeo4w.

The qml with the same name is not read automagically, it has to be
loaded by hand.
It seems to load everything in 4326, ignoring the layer projection.
On the other hand, the speed is impressive.
All the best.

This is not correct: the raster (generated by the interpolation plugin)
does not seem to have a projection associated; this could be a bug in
itself.
Keeping on the exploration...
All the best.

Regardless their CRS, GRASS rasters are always added to qgis with WGS84
CRS.

Changing manually the CRS to the correct one allows to reproject as
expected.

The region is not reprojected (I don't know if this should be expected).

Hi all

There's a patch now that adds diagram support using QgsPalLabeling 
(http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3583). It tries to change the labeling 
classes as little as possible to not introduce additional issues.

Currently available are pie diagrams and text diagrams. My plan is to also 
support bars (and maybe proportional svg symbols) and to remove the vector 
overlay classes after 1.7.

What do you think, is it still ok for those changes to go into 1.7? Looking 
forward to your comments.

Regards,
Marco

Yes, but there seems some resampling going on when requesting a CRS
which the server supports (with enabled OTF):

http://www.catais.org/otf_off.png
http://www.catais.org/otf_on.png

e.g. QGIS set to EPSG:4326 and requesting an EPSG:4326 image from a
server that supports EPSG:4326.

Stefan

I get some Messageboxes with warnings when adding a TMS [1] with GDAL
minidriver:

"Cannot ChunkAndWarpImage: Integer overflow: nSrcXSize=8388608,
nSrcYSize=8388608"

The image is completely black or just fuzzy. OTF is disabled. Can this
be confirmed?

Thank?s  Devs,

I had some  files did not recognized by SVN. They are files of
"spatial query plugin"  when i worked them.

I removed these files and did download again from SVN.

At now, we can see "the on the fly"  Raster with google's image by
Openlayers Plugin:

Hi,

On Tue, 2011-03-08 at 20:17 +0100, Radim Blazek wrote:
> Merged to trunk.


I'm testing the new raster capabilities of QGIS and I would like to have
your opinion on a certain matter before eventually filing a ticket.

I have a bunch of big tiff rasters (> 1gb, sometimes > 2gb), with
internal tiles and/or overviews.

What I'm seeing is that now those rasters take quite a *lot* (making
qgis not responsive for a while) to be rendered, before the merge it was
all much quicker.

As exemple:

on QGIS 1.6 a 1.7gb geotiff with tiles and overviews opens in (more or
less) 1 sec., in trunk now takes (more os less) 1 minute!


After the raster show in the canvas, also opening its properties take a
long time. Before the merge was immediate.

Zooming and panning it is also much slower than before the merge.

Overall it seems like that tiles and overviews are ignored or not read.,
but to me seems that also opening big tiffs (> 1gb) without internal
tiles and/or overviews takes a *lot* more than before the merge.


anyone experiencing the same?


cheers

Ok, so removing lines 13-15 in qgisapp.ui worked. I had to run "make clean" to get it to stick.

Hi,
thank you a lot for your help and recommendations.
The problem seems to be in GDALCreateGenImgProjTransformer2 in the
block which begins on line 1072 (alg/gdaltransformer.cpp) current
trunk:

    else if( (pszMethod == NULL || EQUAL(pszMethod,"GEOTRANSFORM"))
             && GDALGetGeoTransform( hSrcDS, psInfo->adfSrcGeoTransform )
             == CE_None
             && (psInfo->adfSrcGeoTransform[0] != 0.0
                 || psInfo->adfSrcGeoTransform[1] != 1.0
                 || psInfo->adfSrcGeoTransform[2] != 0.0
                 || psInfo->adfSrcGeoTransform[3] != 0.0
                 || psInfo->adfSrcGeoTransform[4] != 0.0
                 || ABS(psInfo->adfSrcGeoTransform[5]) != 1.0) )

here it excludes all source data sources which are not georeferenced.
If I comment the psInfo->adfSrcGeoTransform check, everything works
OK. Is there a good reason to not allow to transform images which are
not georeferenced?

I  can get around also setting for example
psInfo->adfSrcGeoTransform[0] = 0.00000001;
in my code, but that is not nice of course. Is there a better workaround?

The reason is, that GDALCreateGenImgProjTransformer() does not accept
source data sources which are not georeferenced. As an ugly
workaround, I set the first item in GeoTransform (x offset) to
DBL_MIN. In theory it can cause a shift in georeferencing. I don't
believe however that it could be really a problem. The shift is
2.22507e-308.

Se also cc from gdal list.

Hi,
yes that is the mail reporting the error.

Thank you for explanation. I see that I have to reintroduce all the
staff for GDALRasterIO()

Hi all,

I can't seem to open ecw files in the latest trunk build, I get a can "not
open GDAL dataset {ecw name}" I was able to open them before the new raster
OTF projection merge.

Running XP, QGIS r15395

Can anyone else confirm?

You got an error message! Congratulations! You did better than me.

(Are you sure it's not just that QGIS has forgotten where to look for the ECW libraries or GDAL plugins?)

Pretty it knows where everything is; this is my qgis-dev.bat:

@echo off

SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=M:\TEMP\QGIS
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\o4w_env.bat
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\grass-env.bat
@echo off
path %PATH%;%GISBASE%\bin
set GDAL_DRIVER_PATH=?%OSGEO4W_ROOT%?\bin\gdalplugins\1.8
start "Quantum GIS" /B "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\qgis-dev\bin\qgis.exe %*

Exactly the same as before the update.

That looks a lot like mine, which is loading ecw rasters so long as I don't turn OTF on.

Sorry, I'm not able to help more.

I seem to have got it working now.  It was a incorrect " dam file encoding
stuffed me up.  Although now it seems to be very slow at loading them.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimPAA2cDr4aJFCNYsW3FeGNPcaA9+HiUoqtZg2d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

This maybe a real noobish question.  I'm trying to get qgis r15395 to show
debugging info in the console window on windows; if I check the about dialog
it says "This copy of QGIS write debugging output" but nothing is shown when
I launch from the command line.   I have tried calling qgis-dev.bat and just
setting up the variables and calling apps\qgis-dev\bin\qgis.exe but still
nothing.

On linux I normally just call qgis-dev\bin\qgis on the command line and it
will show me the debug info.

Anyone able to help me?

Ramon,

Try to tweak your Osgeo4w installer and install the experimental
releases. Look for the rt15395 or later built. This is the new raster
provider that Radim just committed.

Can you do something about this?  Should I make a bug report?  (maybe it affects other system differently and needs testing?)

Luiz, thanks for the update.

I am not in Windows 7 or Ubuntu 10.04 right now, I am working in Mac
OS X 10.6.4 few days trying to figure out Route-Me and
Spatialite2.4.0.RC5.

I hoping for new r built for OS X.

The debug info doesn't go to the console on windows.   Use the VC debugger or
DebugView[1].

Under Windows (Seven) it seems to crash always that the reprojection is
active. I tested also WMS and GRASS. It is not necessary to actually try
reproject the raster, it is enough to turn on OTFR while having the
raster and the project in the same CRS.

Hi Radim,

We don't have 64bit builds on Windows (at least I don't).

Anyway, r15416 might fix the issue.   Looks like mCoordinateTransform was
deleted twice.  One time just after the QgsRasterProjector was copied to
myProjector and another time when myProjector went out of scope.

Message-ID: <4a9ee53d0bc036093fe75dc12a3c8cfa@localhost>

Hi all.
In some (but not all) Windows machines (both seven and xp) we are getting
crashes in gdaltools (contour, buildvrt, possibly others) [qgis 1.6,
standalone]. I noticed that there are 2 gdal app folders (16 and 17).
Anyone can confirm the problem?
Any idea of what we can test?
All the best.

I can confirm the r15416 fixed that problem (windows 7 32bit).
I'm doing test on a 21698x24674 ArcInfo Binary Grid raster.
It took minutes to load, and several seconds for each pan/zoom...

I have changed how GDAL provider reads the data, it should be fast again.


BUT! I am not absolutely sure that resampling is perfect and the
nearest neighbour is alway nearest. I dont think however that anybody
could notice that in normal work. I would appreciate however if
somebody with fresh brain could check the alignment fiddling.

Most of the gdaltools would crash for us with QGIS 1.6 from the OSGeo4W
installer.  There are no crashes with the 1.7 Osgeo4W builds on 32 bit 
XP, but I have not yet tested on our 64 bit Windows 7 machine.

Radim, the round() you added in qgsgdalprovider causes problems for me on
VC++ (
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/qgis/src/providers/gdal/qgsgdalprovider.cpp#L664
).

Should we add something like:
#define round(dbl) dbl >= 0.0 ? (int)(dbl + 0.5) : ((dbl - (double)(int)dbl)
<= -0.5 ? (int)dbl : (int)(dbl - 0.5))
?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster provider - need to define 'round' on Windows
Message-ID: <AAFD34025E073F47B5F892A97BAFFCAA474737@aklserver02.Synergine.local>

Hi everyone,
Sorry if this has already been covered and I missed it.
Building Trunk on Windows I had these errors, and when trying to load
any 
raster file I got a message that it wasn't a supported raster source:

The problem was resolved by adding the following:

#ifdef WIN32
inline double round( double d ){    return floor( d + 0.5 );}
#endif

Hi Paolo,

I've jsut checked the Contour on the two standalone 1.6 in the office and can confirm the inconsitent behaviour.

On both machines, I used a registered jpeg in MGA94 zone 51, and set the contour interval to 100.
On the winXP 32bit machine it completed with out problems.
On the win7 64bit machine, it displayed "The process crashed sometime after starting successfully" after creating the shape files but before asking what CRS to use.

The created shape files from the two machies are however, identical. (I can put them up somewhere if it helpful)

I can't rule out the different operating systems. 
I have a recallection of updating the 1.6 install on the win7 machine, but no recallection of doing the winXP. Was there a revision 1.6 installer released?
If there was, how do you tell the different instalations apart?
I have a suspicion that these are slightly different 1.6 installs, but can't see a good way of confirming this. Everything on the Help->About page is the same.


As an aside, the other win7 machine in the office is the osgeo path, and is clearly showing influence of the side-by-side trunk install. It completed the task successfully.
-ramon.

Jef fixed that by qRound.
Thank you Jef and sorry for various problems I am introducing.
How do you indent the code? If I run scripts/prepare-commit.sh (which
existence I just noticed) it does too many not desired indentations.

Hi Radim,

thanks for the fix! it works very well. I tested (under both Linux and
Windows) a 2.7GB image with internal tiles and overviews. It opens in a
blink of an eye and it reprojects just as fast!

What it does not seem to work correctly now is the "zoom to best scale"
menu in a reprojected image: the raster disappear as QGIS probably try
to zoom using the wrong crs?

Cheers

Hi Tim,

I was curious too, I had a look and finally I was able to connect to the
service, but there is something strange.
The problem seems to be that the 'Add' button in the wms-dialog is not
enabled in the right way.

What I do to make it work now:

1) add the service url:
http://raster.tnris.org/lizardtech/iserv/ows?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS&

2) accept the 'advertised url' (by clicking yes)

3) click on the first layer 'BEG_GAT_250K_WGS84' and note that in the
status line of the dialog is: 'No CRS selected'

4) click on the 'change' button and select the (only available) crs 'WGS
84' and click OK

NOW the Add button should be enabled (I should think...)

I can get the layer loaded now by clicking on the 0-layer (with title
Top Layer)...
As soon as I click that layer, the Add button get's enabled...

Don't know what the source is of the error

I do not see errors in debug or so.. Maybe jef has an idea?

I opened an issue for this, because it is so easily reproducable:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3591

Hope somebody can have a look at it.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi devs,

Martin have changed the wiki [1] yet, but some plugins still use the old
code to put
a plugin to the DB menu.
The old code throws an error on windows OS due to the new sip version used,
I think.

Please, update your plugin with the new lines of code.
Regards.

QGIS r15426 for Windows by OSGEO4W is working one simple image (CBERS
satellite image).

I will continue testing with a lot of image (example PALSAR with diferent zone).

+1 from me too, both for name and Q-splash.

Why not making a picture like this at every hackfest? Also, if a group
of users wants to do the same, it could be proposed as splashscreen. I
quote Paolo about showing people behind and around QGIS.

Artwork splashscreens could also fit - for example, a map with Q-shaped
clusters of features, or with "Q" point markers, or even QGIS
bakery... :)

cheers!

When printing to large formats (most evident in A0), the size of the

Hi Radim,

unfortunately the "temporary? ugly fix for not georeferenced images", as
you call in the commit, does not seem to work fine with the
georeferencer.

If you open a non-georeferenced image in the georeferencer it will not
show in the tool window.

Cheers

Possibly related, but not the same thing: the effect I am describing is

Hi!

I'm not sure if this is a problem of the tool o of the inout layer.

Hi Agustin,

I created the single part making adjust of code.

I have two observations

1) The projection of your data is not  recognized by  by QGIS (see the PRJ file)
It is not problem for run the process from multi to single part

2) The fTools have one BUG in method of  "multi_to_single":
2.1) Source:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/qgis/python/plugins/fTools/tools/doGeometry.py

2.2) Line 357/358
writer = QgsVectorFileWriter( self.myName, self.myEncoding,
             fields,  vprovider.geometryType() , vprovider.crs() )

Obs: The layer to be create need be single part, it is what you want, but
the define of type the geometry for new layer is the same of original
( vprovider.geometryType() ).

2.3) Adjust in code:
2.3.1) In line 354 put:
geometryTypeWriter = vprovider.geometryType() - 3
2.3.2) In line 358 change:
 vprovider.geometryType()  to geometryTypeWriter

Please, open the ticket to Carson make the best solution for BUG

Regards,
Luiz Motta

If you haven't already opened the ticket, don't bother, this has now

Yes, this is a known problem, that IMHO should be fixed before release.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] geometryless tables
Message-ID: <AANLkTimtLM7HUCyO+JHFwUhvYpn3eanVdgmZ7DjJkUtO@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

Does anyone know if it's possible to (programatically) load a layer as
a geometyless table? In other words, say I have a shapefile named
foo.shp, is it possible to load foo.dbf without the spatial
information? I know I can open PostGIS tables, and even csv files this
way... but if I try this with a dbf file that has an associated .shp
file, it automatically loads the shp files as well.I see from the
QgsOgrProvider source that there is a setRelevantFields() function
which looks to do what I want (uses OGR's SetIgnoreFields, where we
can use the special "OGR_GEOMETRY" specifier), but it is protected,
and my initial attempts to alter things to get access to it do not
seem to have worked... Any suggestions? Ultimately, what I'd like to
be able to do is white a simple plugin to load geometryless tables for
joining etc in QGIS. I'm about 90% of the way done (it already works
for csv files, and lone dbf files), but I'd like something a bit more
generic so it could work with pretty much any ogr supported format.
Has anyone else already done such a thing?

Cheers,

Carson

Not that I know.   But what's the problem adding the layer with geometry and
not to use it?

Well *technically* nothing, but what I'd really like is for it to show
up in the layer list as a table (i.e. with the table icon), and more
importantly, I don't want it to be rendered at all, especially if it
is a particularly complex layer (geometry-wise). Currently, if I do
manage to import a geometryless table via org, I get the exact
behaviour I describe here, which is good. Now I just want to 'ensure'
that this happens when I want it to. Anyway, I'll obviously have to
have a look at QgsOgrProvider a bit more...

Hi again,

not totally true. It does not have immediately effect even if you hit
the "refresh" button. But if you remove the raster and then add it again
the new colormap will show ok. Not very handy.

	interpreting CRSes
Message-ID: <201103140055.10051.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

Last days we made really huge progress improving CRS handling. One of the 
changes was JEF's less restrictive CRS interpreting: 
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/15361 . If nobody disagree, I'd propose 
to extend it also for the +towgs84 parameter.

In the resources/srs.db we have added a number of CRSes in both versions: one 
with +towgs because of reprojection accuracy and one without because of 
compatibility with layers produced by most software. For example: 
epsg 2180 and 42180. 

It would be much simpler for users if we could keep the full projStrings (with 
the parameter) only and Qgis was able to recognize layers with missing 
parameter as them.  We would be also able to remove the odd CRSes and decrease 
the difference between our crs database and the original proj4 one.

Hi,
I've just released version 0.2 of osm2postgresql. The result is now
easier to use with QGIS, thanks to a "class" field in each table
(polygons, ways, nodes_with_tags) on which you can build your symbology.

Other features:
# Fixes small streams, canals... on riverbanks (nicer rendering with
QGIS, and labels from rivers no longer go in the middle of lakes!)
# Keeps [almost] ALL tags (in two fields: 'tags' as text and
'tagshstore' as hstore): you may fine-tune your rendering with the
'tags' field using QGIS's rule-based renderer.
# Optional: installs a postgres server and configure it; create a
database (with postgis and hstore)
# Loads OSM data into the database and process it; creates and fixes
polygons

This is still a work in progress. Hope it helps.

Hi all

Just reminder that there is just today and tomorrow to get your last
features in before we go into feature freeze. If there are patches
still outstanding please bring them to a developer's attention and try
to get them in before Wednesday.

I'm also proposing to delay the release process by one week to allow a
little more time for testing and bugfixing the new raster code. So the
revised timetable would run:

March 15 - Feature Freeze
March 21 - String freeze (although it would be great if translators
could get started already)
April 7 - release branching
12 April - Release announcements (or when packages are available)

Regards

I have looked at the patch and it seems fine to me. Some comments:
- does this imply a complete removal of diagram overlay plugin?
- does it make sense to you to remove the "overlays" tab in the
options dialog? It only allows changing the PAL algorithm, I guess
barely anyone knows what those options mean (and they don't make any
difference anyway unless you have a very dense set of label
candidates)
- I wonder if it wouldn't better to move QgsDiagramLayerSettings
instance from QgsVectorLayer to QgsDiagramRendererV2. If I understand
the code correctly, the diagram layer settings make sense only if
there exists a diagram renderer, right?
- please do not forget to add notes to the new classes and new methods
that they have been added in 1.7, if possible update also the bindings
(I could help you if necessary)

Otherwise +1 from me to apply before the feature freeze.

still not working, the GUI would need an overhaul because it renders bad
under linux and it doesn't have a "close" button.

Try writing to the author and/or opening a ticket in the plugins bug
tracker (if already working).

meanwhile you can use r.los in the GRASS toolbox

 My QGIS doesn't crash with the URL, but nothing is shown on the screen. 
 Just everything white.

 I tested on QGIS trunk, Ubuntu 64bit.

Hi Duarte,

under window Seven 32bit and r15470 it doesn't crash and I can see
correctly the layers.

I updated to r15470 and still crashes for me.

I don't set any CRS. Setting to 4326 still crashes.

I wanted to get some confirmation before opening a ticket.

I now have contradictory results. Some work fine, 1.6 crashes, I'm the only one that has a crash in latest trunk.

So I'll open a ticket.

2)      Connect, and answer twice "No" to questions about ignoring advertised url (I supposed this always happens with wms-c services?)

Agree,

there are problems with the georeferencer

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3596

with the "zoom to best scale"

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3609


and with GRASS rasters

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3582

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3603



plus this that is really a stopper

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3602

Hi

I have some problems with the zoom to full extent functionality with
posgresql layers. It seems that it is always selecting the estimated
extend and never the real extent from postgresql even with an unchecked
"Use estimated table metadata" checkbox.

Hi Martin

Great. I'm going to commit probably tomorrow evening.

> - does this imply a complete removal of diagram overlay plugin?

At the moment, the diagram overlay plugin has more options (bar diagrams and 
the proportional svg symbols). Therefore I'm planning to remove overlay code 
and plugin after 1.7 because of backward compatibility.

+1 (going to do this for 1.7)

Conceptually, it is the other way round (renderer is a part of the layer 
settings). But agreed, there is no need to keep both variables in the vector 
layer. Keeping only the settings variable should work too.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Radim

I found some issues with new raster providers (tested on r15453).

1. Applying a style to layer triggers statistic calculation. If I apply
one style and then another statistics calculates twice.

2. In Metadata tab (Layer properties dialog) there is no raster
statistics even when it calculated.

3. On Histogram tab progress bar is inactive during statistics calculation.
This is a bit confusing especially when raster has many bands

Thanks

LS,

We are using Quantum GIS for our wardens. I have a question of which I don't know where I can put it so I'm hoping one of you can get me into the right direction.

On our clients we have Windows XP sp2 as Operating System and on our fileservers we have Microsoft Server 2003 as Operating System.
We store our data files (shape files and raster files (ecw)) on the central file server.
For a shape file with a .shp file (size 3 MB) and a .dbf file (size 155 MB) it takes 7 minutes and 30 seconds to get the shape displayed on screen. Between the two locations there is a WAN of 10 Mbps.

Other applications (MapWindow, ArcGIS, DIVA-GIS) only take 40 seconds to do the same.
My presumption is that Quantum GIS first downloads the entire shape file onto the client before rendering. The other applications seem only to download the .shp file and to approach the .dbf file on the file server.

I have observed that it is the .dbf file that is taking the time because when I deleted a number of fields in the specific .dbf file time dropped to about 3 minutes (and the size of the .dbf file dropped to 85 MB).
The other applications still gave the same result of 40 seconds. 

Can someone of you please tell me how Quantum GIS handles shape files on a remote file server and if / when Quantum GIS will be able to get the same results in performance as the other applications mentioned above?

I'm looking forward to receiving your answer.

I updated to r15470 and still crashes for me.

I don't set any CRS. Setting to 4326 still crashes.

I wanted to get some confirmation before opening a ticket.

I now have contradictory results. Some work fine, 1.6 crashes, I'm the only one that has a crash in latest trunk.

So I'll open a ticket.

Duarte,

I can see OMS layer.

Enviroment:
Windows XP
QGIS trunck R15470

The problem is the on the fly.
It is need use the  same CRS of the OSM (EPSG: 4326) to work with others layers.

1)      Add wms server http://osm.omniscale.net/proxy/service?tiled=true

2)      Connect, and answer twice "No" to questions about ignoring advertised url (I supposed this always happens with wms-c services?)

3)      Select "osm" layer

4)      Click Add

5)      QGIS crashes

Using Win 7 32bit, QGIS 1.7 r15458.

Agree,

there are problems with the georeferencer

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3596

with the "zoom to best scale"

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3609


and with GRASS rasters

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3582

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3603



plus this that is really a stopper

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3602

Hi

I have some problems with the zoom to full extent functionality with
posgresql layers. It seems that it is always selecting the estimated
extend and never the real extent from postgresql even with an unchecked
"Use estimated table metadata" checkbox.

Hi Martin

Great. I'm going to commit probably tomorrow evening.

> - does this imply a complete removal of diagram overlay plugin?

At the moment, the diagram overlay plugin has more options (bar diagrams and 
the proportional svg symbols). Therefore I'm planning to remove overlay code 
and plugin after 1.7 because of backward compatibility.

+1 (going to do this for 1.7)

Conceptually, it is the other way round (renderer is a part of the layer 
settings). But agreed, there is no need to keep both variables in the vector 
layer. Keeping only the settings variable should work too.

Marco

Hi QGIS-devs,

please also take into account this annoyance:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3263

Currently it is impossible to add groups from PyQGIS without nesting them.

Hi

I just made an upgrade of the Postgis SQL Editor plugin on
http://plugins.qgis.org/. Unfortunately I dont have publishing access to
the repository. As the result the old wrong plugin is still published
although I could upload the new revision of the plugin. What is the
procedure to get permissions to publish or upgrade plugins in the repos?

Hi all.
I had a few issues during a course; I would be grateful if someone could
check and open tickets if appropriate.
1. load vectors: the GML filter does not seem to show GML files
2. add to overview does not work properly (it does not add the full
content, the bounding box is wrong, sometimes it does not add anything)
3. http://www.qgis.org/en/documentation/manuals.html does not show up in
IE (do not know which version)
4. text annotations are not reprojected on the fly (they hang around)
All the best.

	crashes
Message-ID: <AANLkTin8CBbzSixryv+kii5sZcGV7yPJMusSssRCP1uY@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!
I've been given a shape file with the following prj:
PROJCS["WGS_1984_Complex_UTM_Zone_26N",GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator_Complex"],PARAMETER["False_Easting",500000.0],PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-27.0],PARAMETER["Scale_Factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",0.0],UNIT["Meter",1.0]]

that makes qgis crash leaving the following message in the console:

ERROR 6: No translation for Transverse_Mercator_Complex to PROJ.4
format is known.

Apparently, there is no difference with the parameters I was geting
until now for the same type of layers:
PROJCS["WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_26N",GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["False_Easting",500000.0],PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-27.0],PARAMETER["Scale_Factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",0.0],UNIT["Meter",1.0]]

but the "WGS_1984_Complex_UTM_Zone_26N" is actually listed in
http://resources.esri.com/help/1200/arcgisexplorer/componenthelp/index.html#//0003000002tw000000

1. As qgis crashes, can I safely modify the prj file and use
"WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_26N"? (As far as I can tell, yes, but would like
confirmation)
2. Does anyone know why this "WGS_1984_Complex_UTM_Zone_26N" has been
introduced?
3. Are we going to have support for "WGS_1984_Complex_UTM_Zone_26N" in
QGIS in the near future?

Thanks

Hi Giovanni,

Thanks for your input. The author is in the email list as madchuckle. I was hoping he would be able to weigh in on this. Meanwhile, I am trying to get r.viewshed running, but g.extension and OS X do not play well together... Running r.los is terribly slow for my analysis of interest.

Cheers,
John

Since we are using gdal/ogr for reading shapefiles, this is probably a
question better asked on the gdal mailing list. Let us know if you get
some interesting response from them!

By the way for such a client / server environment, it is *much* better
performance wise and logistically to put your data into PostGIS.

That fix is was already superseded by complete
QgsGdalProvider::readBlock rewrite.

I'll look at it.

You have already reported that problem and I have already explained
where the problem is.

That is on my list and I'll let you know once i fix that.
I am trying to fix and response all related bug reports.

Hi all
As Tim suggested to bring a patch to a developer's attention, I recall
here what he suggested (and Marco's positive comment): "to apply [my]
patch to the release branch and keep trunk untouched."
(In fact: it's Marco's patch proposed 7 months ago, see
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2832#comment:3 )

This does not prevent us to work towards SLD in the long term. Still,
for now, all NG renderers (Single symbol, categorized, graduated) have a
working "Symbol level" button, except the rule-based renderer; the patch
will give similar behaviour on all renderers.
It "kills" me to write this, but if those few lines of the patch are not
applied, IMHO it is better to remove the "Symbol levels" button from the
rule-based renderer (because users will try to use it otherwise).

Hi Radim,

> QgsGdalProvider::readBlock rewrite.
> 
> I'll look at it.

the problem seem to be incorrect / inconsistent
handling of geotransforms with positive y-axis
scale. I have the feeling that at some place the
raster extent calculation is performed using
a negative y-axis (probably because the CRS is
not valid), but some other routines from
the gdal raster provider use the directions given by the 
geotransform.

I'd have to take a closer look though to confirm.

cheers,
	Manuel

this seemed indeed to be the case, I have commited a
fix in r15481 (just adjusting the geotransform to
have negative y axis if no geotransform is available).

(should fix #3596, but please test)

Hi German, all,
I m dealing with the same problem in my multiview plugin (
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/multiview/repository/revisions/master/entry/temporalrasterloaderdialog.py)
and i noticed that if i create a group and then load a layer the groups get
created at the end of the list (look for the hack in the link). So maybe it
is a different issue/bug. In general I feel that the legend interface could
need some love... Unfortunately i ve no time right now.

Ciao
Marco Bernasocchi (mobile)

Hi QGIS-devs,

please also take into account this annoyance:

Currently it is impossible to add groups from PyQGIS without nesting them.

Hi Paolo,
I confirm bug 2 and 4 and I'm going to open 2 tickets.
I cannot test bug 3.


I cannot reproduce bug 1:

I did (on Linux shell):
touch /tmp/test.gml
touch /tmp/test2.GML
I saw (live) the two files created instantly in the vector import window
(with GML filter).

Hi again Paolo,

For bug about overview there was a ticket #2243 which said the bug is
only with docked overview. I modified the ticket (having the pane docked
or floating does not change anything: the bug is still there) and found
counter-examples to http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2243#comment:3

For the annotations I created ticket #3618. I selected
component=MapCanvas  but I'm very unsure...

Paolo, Mayeul,

I've checked 1 and 3 using QGIS 1.6 and win XP and 7.

Bug 3: IE8 does not have any problems with that page.

I can not reproduce 1 either, using an windows-ish equivlent of Mayeul's method.

-ramon.

I actually dislike the Annotation layer method that said products use
because it unlinks the data from the labels and leads to one-off
labeling that may break themes. I would propose that with table joins
becoming possible a table join to a write-able table could be an
alternate solution that would continue to use the current system.

Overall +1 on being able to detect/placement amongst all types of map
mark up.

Thanks,
Alex

Unfortunately we experienced last Friday's earthquake and tsunami disaster.
My room was littered with books and crockery shelf collapses.

Our mappers to make maps of the Japanese disaster situation are using 
the QGIS.
Many peoples useing QGIS for make a georeference to aereial photo or
Satellite Photo of disaster area.
And those photo will be use for sharing disaster information in the net.
In this case QGIS is great !!!

 Well, that is normal - it is not a complete URL. You need to specify 
 the service (WMS) and the command 
 (GetCapabilites,GetMap,GetFeatureInfo,GetLegendGraphic,GetPrint) with 
 some additional parameters, depending on the command.

 The link you provide below is not complete and will in any case trigger 
 an error.

Yes, but from within QGIS I get this (I'm pretty sure it worked a few
weeks ago):

Could not understand the response.  The wms provider said:
Could not get WMS capabilities: unexpected character at line 1 column 50
This is probably due to an incorrect WMS Server URL.
Response was:

Message-ID: <201103152022.58668.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

Hi, All interested in new repo.

Actually I'm not able to focus on this task now (and still have over 200 mails 
in related topics to read), so I can't decide wheter to add the new repo to 
the installer today or leave the 1.7 with the old repo for and use the new one 
only for the 2.0. 

If most plugins is going to be incompatible with 2.0, adding the new repo now 
makes no sense. Better to separate the repositories. Otherwise, adding the 
repo would prevent authors for uploading the same work twice.
    
The safest solution is to wait for HF and then decide what to do. It's no 
problem to release an Installer update. What do you think? Or maybe there is 
already a decision?

When using the identify features tool with Spatialite, the status bar shows "No features at this postion". Tool works with shapefiles and postgis database. Using SQLite 3 framework v3.7.4-2 from KyngChaos on OS X 10.6.5. Problem with both QGIS 1.6 and 1.7 dev builds from KyngChaos. This was working with QGIS versions from last fall.

Installed the older SQLite3 3.6.23-1 framework and this fixed the problem. Is Spatialite 2.4.0 RC4 in the latest framework not compatible with QGIS?

Hi

My opinion is that we should wait for 1.9.x releases....

Message-ID: <AANLkTinmwJG48ubY31gNXwFVqwt_z6+dOvXeX8cHvbFW@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In QGIS we were able to save a vector layer as MapInfo tab. In r15470 (and
before) we are able to save as MapInfo mif only.
If you try to force the file extension by inserting "name.tab" you will get
"name.tab.mif" in the end anyway.
Using win7 and osgeo4w.

Just use the functionality listed in help - comparision operators:

Hi Royce,

I've just performed a quite thorough test using
the latest QGIS 1.7 'nightly build' coming from
OSGeo4W
And I was completely unable to detect any anomaly
related to the Identify tool & spatialite
I've checked (using the Python console) the actual
spatialite supported version: and for sure this is 
v.2.4.0-RC4

So (at least on Windows) there is no issue at all;
can anyone confirm this problem on Mac Os X ?
(or on any platform ...) ?

bye Sandro

It seems that our grammar is slightly flawed: the comparison operators
in qgis can be used only on "top level" e.g. "field_1 > 0 or field_2 =
0". So they work if you are doing a search in the attribute table, but
they don't if you're trying to use them in an expression. I see you
have already opened a bug for that. The parser and evaluation code
definitely need some love (and unit tests!!) in order to keep up with
increasing demands from the users :-)

So what about removing it from the Help in 1.7? Or better creating a help for 
raster calculator and moving them there ;-) I believe promising non-existing 
features is not goo for QGis.

Help geeks, are you here? :)

Hi all.
Sorry about my deep ignorance about OSX. In a course, one of the students
installed QGIS on her mac from http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis.
Everything went well, but when starting to use rasters she is getting
constant crashes.
Any special thing one should do to fix this?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] color table: labels missing?
Message-ID: <6f692b7085f9810b42b437367a8ca010@localhost>

Hi all.
At EEA they were so kind as to add my CORINE color table to the standard
data distribution:
http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-2006-raster
so our QGIS users see the land cover in the right colors.
The problem is that the labels (very important to interpret the data) are
not shown in the layer properties>colormap. This is how the color table is
written:

# QGIS Generated Color Map Export File

INTERPOLATION:DISCRETE

1,230,000,077,255, 111 - Continuous urban fabric
...

Any explanation or suggestion as to what should be changed? I tried
putting '' around label, but it does not work.

Thanks.

Milena,

I confirm yours comment about write file in format TAB.

I read the source and i believe has a procedure inconsistent in file:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/qgis/src/core/qgsvectorfilewriter.cpp

I would like that Tim could see the method
QgsVectorFileWriter::driverMetadata(Line 895):

else if ( driverName.startsWith( "MapInfo File" ) )
{
  longName = "Mapinfo File";
  trLongName = QObject::tr( "Mapinfo File" );
  glob = "*.mif *.tab";
  ext = "mif" ;
}

This method set the ext(extension) equal  "mif".

In method QgsVectorFileWriter::QgsVectorFileWriter in line 134:

if ( QgsVectorFileWriter::driverMetadata( driverName, longName,
trLongName, glob, ext ) )
{
  if ( !vectorFileName.endsWith( "." + ext, Qt::CaseInsensitive ) )
  {
    vectorFileName += "." + ext;
  }
}

We can see that  extension is "mif" (always), then, the output format
is the MIF.

You can open the ticket about this.

Regards,
Luiz

 Perhaps, using a qml file based on your colour palette (csv) would do 
 it?
 Please try one of the attached qml files:
 - GRID_CODE.qml for classification of colours in function of the grid 
 code (1-44)
 - CLC_Code.qml for classification of colours in function of the CLS 
 (111-523)

 Unzip the attached file.
 Open QGIS
 Load the Corine raster
 Open its properties dialog box
 Set the Style->Color map to 'Colormap'
 In the Colormap tab, load the CLC_Code.qml. You should have the labels 
 displayed alongside the colours.

 Does it work for you?

 Regards,
 Benoit

 Paolo,

 Sorry, wrong procedure!

 In the raster properties dialog box, simply "Load style..." and 
 navigate to the qml file.
 Then go to the Colormap tab and the labels should be displayed.

 Sorry again.

Hi Paolo

Because there is no unary minus in the raster calc grammar yet
(%left UMINUS  // fictitious symbol (for unary minus)  ).

As a workaround, (diff@1)* (0-1) should be ok.

Please fill a bug.

Does it mean users should also wait with testing the repo?

I tried to start using is it to generate some feedback to you and
other developers rather than as a production tool. However, the split
between people who do the development in github, deployment and server
administration makes it quite difficult. Having some experience with
Django I thought I would help with problem I encountered but the
project has so many dependencies that I did not have time to setup my
development environment yet and I just filed a bug instead
(http://hub.qgis.org/issues/25).

However, today I found out that my plugin was removed from published
state and it was marked as featured (don't know why, it's more kind of
experiment than generally usable plugin).I don't know if it was
administrator's intention, a mistake, or bug in the site code.
Therefore it is a bit difficult for me to help with testing the site.

I'd love to see it in 1.7 but I don't feel it's ready yet.

Of course not! I only mean to not add this repo automatically to the 1.7 and 
postpone the decision for the hackfe...eeting (where I plan to put all my time 
and forces into this task).

If you add the repo manually, you know what you do and you can remove it if we 
decide to put only 2.0 plugins there. But if I add it now to the "Add 3rd 
party repos" list, and users around will install it, we won't have such choice 
and will be forced to keep mixed plugins in the repo.

Actually I must admit I haven't put any labour into the new repo yet, I'm 
going to join the developers in Lisbon... :(

No, please test it and report. My account was set to not receive project's
notifications so I did not receive your ticket. Now I see it.

It wasn't me so I can't tell you. But, generally speaking, "featured" and
"published" are two boolean independent flags, so a plugin can be both
"featured" and not "published".

This is the intended behavior:

The public view for "featured"
    Shows only public featured stable plugins: i.e. those with "published"
flag set
    with one "stable" version and "featured" flag set

The public view for "published"
    Shows only public plugins: i.e. those with "published" flag set
    and with at least one version ("stable" or "experimental")


If you see something different, please file a ticket.

Thanks

It may be related to GDAL version (AFAICT 1.8 in that package). Maybe
paths are not found? Also GdalTools are not working.

Hi, 

 

Is there any development projection including functionalities for access control in Quantum? I mean, for example, role based access control or something.

 

I?m aware the actual code doesn?t take care of this aspect ?cause of the actual objectives of Qgis application, but maybe someone have made steps on this direction and could share ideas.

 

I want to personalize Qgis for an specific business and security will be a priority aspect around.

 

Regards,

David

This is actually an error from the (auto) generated ui file. Have you
recently updated your Qt/PyQt version?

What does the crash log say?  If you don't get the crash dialog popup (no need to send to Apple), you can find the crash log with Console.app, and look in the ~/Library/CrashReporter section.

I am using both QGIS 1.6  and QGIS 1.7 r15108 from KyngChaos with the latest frameworks (GDAL 1.8) and have not had a problem with GRASS rasters, geoTIFFs, MrSIid, and Surfer GRID files. QGIS 1.7 does have some issues setting colors. This is fixed with new raster provider. This is using OS X 10.6.5.

I never got a chance to package the PPC QGIS for the new GDAL 1.8, so make sure you install GDAL 1.7 for now (look on my download archives page).  I'm afraid my ability to package the PPC QGIS is rapidly deteriorating - running off a 867MHz Mac at work, where I don't have much spare time these days to compile.

For GdalTools, make sure the path setting is:

/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.7/Programs:/usr/bin

Message-ID: <7BD44272-8B71-4E45-A413-F841FBD5C64D@nd.gov>

A problem I am having with QGIS 1.7 loading old projects I have tracked down to SpatiaLite. QGIS 1.7 was taking over 3 minutes to load a large project and over 12 minutes to quit QGIS. 

To test, I created a project with 124 layers from a SpatiaLite database. QGIS 1.6 took 3.9 seconds to import all 124 layers from the database. I then saved the project. QGIS 1.6 will open this project in 4.15 seconds. Quitting QGIS takes less than 1 second. QGIS 1.7 r15108 takes 33.4 seconds to load this project and quitting QGIS takes 2 min. 32.5 sec. With QGIS 1.7 importing the 124 layers into an empty project tool 35.6 seconds. I get similar results with GGIS 1.7-r15490 that I built from trunk. This is on OS X 10.6.5 with QGIS and latest frameworks from KyngChaos.

Any idea what has changed with SpatiaLite between v1.6 and v.1.7? What would cause QGIS to take so long to quit after loading the project?

 Well, security is usually about access to data, and any application
should defer that to the operating system. So for example, if your
data is on shared drives, you'd control access via share permissions.
If your data is in a PostGIS database, you'd just use PostgreSQL user
access controls. Qgis doesn't enter into it.

 What sort of thing did you have in mind?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Advice on VRP plugin development
Message-ID: <1300297383659-6178156.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hi all!

I would like to create a QGis plugin to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem
(VRP) using Evolutionary Computation techniques (Genetic Algorithms and
stuff like that).
I have some initial questions, so if someone can help-me, I'll appreciate it
very much.

1. What programming language should i use? I know that there's the
possibility to create plugins in Python or C++, but the Python Plugin
Installer, as the name states, can only be used for python plugins.
The problem of using python is about speed/performance, because VRP is a
very hard problem, especially when is solved using Evolutionary Computation
techniques.
There seems that i have 3 options:
a) Do all the work in python, using some libraries to speed up the thing
(like scipy).
b) Build the interface in python and the core library in C++. I don't know
if python and C++ can integrate well. I don't know either if this can be
done, because C++ has to be compiled for the client machine (that can be
windows, linux, ...)
c) Build the interface in python and the core library in java. I don't know
if python and java can integrate well too, but java can run in almost every
platform and is fast.

2. For the plugin to work, i need to find the shortest path between any two
points on a POINT layer, using a LINESTRING layer for the road network. In
the new QGis development version there's a plugin/tool named "shortest
path". Can i use it to calculate this distances from a python plugin?

Any help or advice is very appreciated.

Message-ID: <12B5237A-E964-4D17-BAED-874AEE616B1A@wildnevada.org>

I added a bug to the queue that has been confirmed on linux and osx:

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3622

This one is a real problem for carto output in QGIS. I'm not sure if this is a result of a change in the raster handling or something in the composer itself, but it appears to be the former. I was able to get a successful map produced with rev 15382, but nothing beyond that (there were separate crash issues for OSX not resolved on my platform until rev 15412, so it may have cropped up anywhere in that span of code updates).

Thanks for helping get this resolved.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikQrp2O9EmK3-3fOQ4cGGrg_QAcjcv9uZ0rhvr8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I've noticed something with CRS comparison that (I think) bears
consideration. Below is an example from the QGIS Python console:

>>> mc = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()
>>> first_layer = mc.layer(0)
>>> second_layer = mc.layer(1)
>>> first_layer.crs().toProj4()
PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'+proj=tmerc +lat_0=53.5 +lon_0=-8 +k=1.000035
+x_0=200000 +y_0=250000 +ellps=mod_airy +units=m +no_defs')
>>> second_layer.crs().toProj4()
PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'+proj=tmerc +lat_0=53.5 +lon_0=-8 +k=1.000035
+x_0=200000 +y_0=250000 +ellps=mod_airy +units=m +no_defs')
>>> first_layer.crs().toProj4() == second_layer.crs().toProj4()
True
>>> first_layer.crs() == second_layer.crs()
False

Ok, so that seems funny, so I checked further, turns out one is a user
defined CRS:
>>> first_layer.crs().authid()
PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'EPSG:29902')
>>> second_layer.crs().authid()
PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'USER:100000')
>>> first_layer.crs().toWkt()
PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'PROJCS["unnamed",GEOGCS["unnamed
ellipse",DATUM["unknown",SPHEROID["unnamed",6377340.189,299.3249645999944]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",53.5],PARAMETER["central_meridian",-8],PARAMETER["scale_factor",1.000035],PARAMETER["false_easting",200000],PARAMETER["false_northing",250000],UNIT["Meter",1]]')
>>> second_layer.crs().toWkt()
PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'PROJCS["unnamed",GEOGCS["Modified
Airy",DATUM["unknown",SPHEROID["mod_airy",6377340.189,299.3249373654873]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",53.5],PARAMETER["central_meridian",-8],PARAMETER["scale_factor",1.000035],PARAMETER["false_easting",200000],PARAMETER["false_northing",250000],UNIT["Meter",1]]')

Ok, so they aren't technically *exactly* the same... but for all
intents and purposes, they are equivalent. According to the docs, the
'equal()' function "use[s] OGR isSameCRS() or isSameGeoCRS() methods
as appropriate. Additionally logic may also be applied if the result
from the OGR methods is inconclusive." Has any additional logic been
applied? Would it perhaps be more appropriate to check for similarity
on multiple levels? I.E. something like:
if not crs1 == crs2:
    ok, but they might still be equivalent...
    if crs1.toProj4() == crs2.toProj4():
        return see, I told you!
    else:
        return fine, you were right all along
else:
    return aha, I knew it
return nope, sorry they aren't the same

Hi,

it was gdal 1.7 missing, we installed 1.8 before.

I want a Qgis personalization where qgis must take care of socioeconomic
data for multiple users with different access level for both geographic and
socioeconomic data. For example an Analist just view and calculate areas and
stadistics, but a Map-Administrator is responsible for updating new elements
on maps, or modifying attributes. 

For this typical scenario I prefer to apply control anywhere possible, so,
just show the user the permitted functionalities, just allow executing
related methods and just perform source-data access/modify right operations.

But, for example, qgisinterface is too open and will always be a restriction
about security while it's strength for extensibility.

Regards,
David

 Well, security is usually about access to data, and any application
should defer that to the operating system. So for example, if your
data is on shared drives, you'd control access via share permissions.
If your data is in a PostGIS database, you'd just use PostgreSQL user
access controls. Qgis doesn't enter into it.

 What sort of thing did you have in mind?

Hi

Is anybody experiencing problems with the grass plugin in Qgis ?

I'm building Qgis out of the svn trunk. I'm doing all the configure without
any problems and GRASS included. I'm compiling the code without errors. When
I open Qgis I cant find GRASS anywhere within the program. Any hints where I
might be missing something ?

I'm building GRASS 6.4 also from svn if that matters and there I included
both c config and python binding.

Hi David,
Barry is right and his answer is much better than what you could get
with any client connecting to the data.
You can define read-only access for some users and write access to other
users both at the database level and at the shared disk level. All the
examples you gave (below) are normally managed this way. This is the
only safe way to do it: if you create a new client software managing
access restriction, you may always face users using other clients to
workaround those restrictions. On the contrary, whatever the client you
use, nobody will break a well designed database or shared disk security.
The only part of the access restrictions that a client as QGIS should
take care of is to ask users to provide a correct username/password, and
this is implemented.

Hope it helps.

Unfortunately. At this moment you can not use the code Road Graph plugin in Python. I will do it later (on QGIS 1.8).

 The thing you might want to do with Qgis (and this might be what
you're getting at) is to build a simplified interface so users can
only see the things they need to see. It might not stop them running
Qgis-proper and seeing everything, but access controls should always
be implemented at the server or system level. Qgis is a great platform
for building simplified GIS applications (such as data collection
applications where all you want is for someone to click on a map and
add some text/graphics and not have a cluttered UI with hundreds of
other bits n bobs).

 Case in point. Our central IT guys developed a complex database
system for managing all the users over the entire campus. Departmental
IT reps were given access to manage the users in their department. But
the access was checked by the fancy front-end database client they
built. But I could just connect to the database using either a command
line tool or something like MS Access and do what the heck I liked
with all the tables. I didn't, of course, but this kind of security
fail is a possibility...

 So, control access and permissions on the system/server, improve
usability in the client.

I am preparing to do a presentation on QGIS to a GIS users group meeting in Brandon on Friday. What can I say about when 1.7 will come out? Will it have the Raster-on-the-Fly capability that is being tested at the moment?

I have been doing some testing with a polygon file of contours have 54614 polygons and it is 770 Mb in size and an getting draw speeds of about 30 seconds on my DELL T3500 system running Windows 7 with 4 Gb of RAM. The contour polygons are at 5m intervals. (I have some screen captures of some of the draws if people want to email me directly for them) This seems like a pretty fast response time and I was impressed that QGIS could handle such a large dataset. Any comments?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SpatiaLite very slow with QGIS 1.7

Hi Noli, hi Royce,

I've just spent several hours attempting to build the
current QGIS-Trunk SVN snapshot on my cheap and old
second hand MacMini (incredibly slow hardware, really
an extenuating time consuming process ...).

Anyway, these are my personal findings:

- Mac Os X 10.5 Intel
- not using frameworks at all (only the Qt one)
- using MacPorts libraries instead
- and using INTERNAL SpatiaLite (2.4.0-RC4)

+ QGIS on Mac Os X runs exactly as it run on Windows
+ I was completely unable to observe any issue about
   the Identify tool
+ opening an 80+ layers DB takes an absolutely
   reasonable time
+ closing the same DB is a quite immediate process

So, I'm completely unable to tell you why the 'standard'
QGIS distribution for Mac Os X shows so many problems
related to SpatiaLite 2.4.0-RC4 as you've reported.

At this point I strongly suspect that something is
broken or misconfigured in the most recent SpatiaLite
Mac Os X framework, because simply avoiding to use
this one and building so to use the INTERNAL spatialite
instead fixes any issue.

bye Sandro

Here are some comments about the second part (which is more a user issue).
>"draw speeds of about 30 seconds"  "I was impressed that QGIS could handle such a large dataset. Any comments?"


You might gain speed gains doing some or part of the following:
- put your dataset in a database (suggested: postgis or spatialite)
- simplify your dataset for visualisation at small (overview) scale; try to draw non-simplified data only at detailed (large) scale
- if you insist on shapefiles, make sure you created the spatial index (there is one button in QGIS for this)
- probably it does not make sense to display all the data at all scale. Depending on semantic needs, optimisation is possible here. In addition, polygons with a very small area can easily be ignored at small scale (they would probably be displayed with a single pixel anyway): pre-compute the scale of each polygon, and create a scale based rule in rule based renderer. (or use a query at the layer level).
When you say "contour polygon" do you mean level curves (elevation data) [hence: might be linestring, not polygons]? Then at small scale you could show only main level curves (every 100 m).
Doing this I can browse the Openstreetmap dataset + level curves/contour for a European country (>1Gb of data) with a rendering time of less than 1 second.
If you have several layers, you may want to try and build the threading branch for even faster rendering (multicore).

Raster reprojection already in trunk and AFAIK will be available in
upcoming 1.7 release.

Alexander,

I already made a post  in QGIS Brazil community about Raster on the Fly:
http://qgisbrasil.wordpress.com/

Sorry, it is in Portuguese.

I wrote, this a new feature will appear in release 1.7

Ups... That's a pity.

The problem is just some missing bindings? Or other thing?

Thanks for your help!

Usually this means that Python could not find the PyQt module or could not
load it for some reason.  Check your environment variables---specifically
PATH and PYTHONPATH.

Shortest path tool is a QGIS plugin. It isn't QGIS core.

Hi

Sorry for toppost:

Yes on the fly raster projection will be in 1.7.

Expected release *announcement* date around the 7th April (but subject
to change).

Regards

Tim

Some tests here, OSX 10.6.6:

QGIS 1.6 with Sqlite/Spatialite 3.6.23/2.4rc3 framework

add 20 spatialite layers: 2s
quit: instant
reopen: 2s

QGIS 1.6 with Sqlite/Spatialite 3.7.4/2.4rc4 framework

add 20 same layers: 2s
quit: instant
reopen: 3s

QGIS 1.7 r15455 with Sqlite/Spatialite 3.7.4/2.4rc4 framework

add same 20 layers: 2s
quit: instant
reopen: 3s

I'll try updating my SVN and rebuilding and see if there is a change.

Hi Jean Roc,

ticket #3002 isn't related at all to SpatiaLite
and/or to the QGIS own SpatiaLite data provider.

I've just attempted to save a (quite small sized) 
Shapefile as a SQLite DB following the procedure
reported on ticket #3002.

Yes, I can confirm, you are perfectly right: the 
export process is incredibly slow (> 10 minutes) 
and strongly inefficient (spatialite_gui performs 
the same identical task just in few seconds).

Anyway, at the end of the process a basic SQLite 
DB was generated. 
Please note well: this is *not* at all a SpatiaLite 
own DB; this one is an OGR/FDO own DB (a completely 
different thing, using an independent code base). 

So for sure this issue is entirely caused by OGR,
and has absolutely nothing to do with SpatiaLite.

Just as a working hypothesis: during this painful
export I noticed a very low CPU activity, and an 
impressively huge disk traffic.
This is exactly what I'm expecting from a badly 
implemented process attempting to perform lots and 
lots of SQL INSERTs without declaring a corresponding
BEGIN and COMMIT ... and such a condition notoriously 
is a real "performance killer" for any transactional 
DBMS. my 2 cents :-)

bye Sandro

This is a preferable approach.

Python and C++ integrate well, it's relatively easy to build python
modules in C/C++. There's also 'ctypes' module which allows you to
access shared libraries with C API directly from Python. Several years
ago I have done a simple routing application [1] using PyQt and
PyQGIS: the routing backend has been done in C++, the GUI in Python.
The downside is that you have to build the library for each platform
separately.

I wouldn't recommend that since java means a bunch of more dependencies.

Hi,

Thanks for instant reply...

I copied following files to my qgis folder in Python folder as shown below
_init_
analysis.pyd

Sorry for the mistake, I didn't knew there was a difference in the ouput.

Can you confirm that it is due to OGR ? ogr2ogr with SPATIALITE=yes is 
faster than QGIS 'save as'

Is this possibly a 64 bit issue. I am assuming Sandro's mini is an original core duo and therefore his build is 32 bit. Probably his test of the Identify Tool and Selection tool was on 32 bit Windows. If so, this could be the differentiating factor.

Not really sure about this: I personally ignore any 
implementation detail for this QGIS feature.
Anyway FDO/OGR is strictly related to OGR (as the
name itself tells).

May well be some other developer can help you
better than me on this specific topic :-)

I tried running QGIS in 32bit mode with no difference in times.  And my QGIS 1.6 (assuming you're using that) is 64bit also.

You could try it on your 1.7 build, if you compiled 32+64bit - Get Info on QGIS.app in the Finder, check Open in 32-bit mode.

Well, I'd say that QGIS has very poor performance with large/complex 
vector datasets.  Have you ever compared it to other software?
But performance should improve significantly when the threading 
branch is merged to trunk (after 1.7).

Did further testing. The problem is a power function of the number of layers. 

QGIS 1.7 r15529M. 
# layers        load time       quit time
40 			2.3s 		1.6s
60			3.6s 		3.4 s
68			4.8s			5.3s
76			6.2s			8.9s
84			7.9s			19.6s
92			10.9		36.7s
100			14.1s		57.7s
108			18.8s		82.2s

QGIS 1.6
# layers        load time       quit time
108			3.6s		instantaneous 

Both versions of QGIS using the same frameworks. Layer differences should not impact the times. The layers are in sets of 4 with the latter layer datasets added being very similar in the data they contain to the first layer datasets added.

Oh yeah, that makes a difference.  I didn't have a spatialite DB with 80 layers, but I added the same 20 from before 4x.  While I couldn't test loading all 80 at once, I could test the quitting aspect.

QGIS 1.6-1, spatialite 2.4rc3 (should be same as the 1.6 that's working for you)

- quits instantly

QGIS 1.6-2, spatialite 2.4rc4

- quits instantly

QGIS 1.7 r15455, spatialite 2.4rc4 (same binary as above)

- takes 11s to quit

So, this points to a QGIS problem.  I'll work on an updated SVN build and try that...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How do I enable ecw when building on Windows
	agains gdal-1.8?
Message-ID: <AAFD34025E073F47B5F892A97BAFFCAA4C9192@aklserver02.Synergine.local>

Hi everyone,
I have side by side installs on Windows of the OSGEO nightly build (in
C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-dev) and trunk compiled from source (in
C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-trunk).
The OSGeo build can open ECW files, but my own build says these are not
a supported data source.

If I swap the copies of gdalprovider.dll between the two installs, then
the OSGEO QGIS says ECW is not supported, and my QGIS can open ECW.

Also, if I install gdal 1.7 (and its ECW driver), compile against that
instead of against gdal 1.8, and change GDAL_DRIVER_PATH in the .bat
file, then my build can open ECW files.

Is there something extra that needs to be done when building QGIS
against gdal 1.8?  Perhaps I need to set the GDAL_DRIVER_PATH in the
batch script that I start cmake-gui and vcexpress from, or something
like that?

Thanks,
Alister

Hi All,

I wrote a blog post a couple of days ago about opening MS SQL
Spatial geometries and it worked fine then but the latest revision can't
seem to display them.

It opens the table correctly, detects the geometry type right and I can even
browse the table but no geometries are displayed.

This is the code I use in the Python console to open the layer and then test
to see if the geometry is there.

When I run  can.currentLayer().select(1) QGIS says in the status bar that
there is 1 feature selected and I can zoom to the correct spot on the map
but nothing is displayed.

Would anyone have any idea what's going on here?

Hi Luiz.
My suggestion is to package it instead of simple compiling it. The
controls in trunk (tnx jef) should take care of all dependencies etc.,
and in my experience make compilation smoother.
All the best.

Carson,

I think that requiring all layers to be on the same CRS for processing makes
sense,
we can live with that. Perhaps this fact should be stated in the
documentation and
even in the menu where the user selects reprojection on the fly (for
example, adding
"only for display of vector layers") and/or in all fTools menus (and/or
fTools could actually check that
CRS is consistent across layers and warn the user (rather than preventing
him/her of actually performing the operation).

Thanks!

Yes it is intentional. In fact, all fTools functions (where overlay is
relevant) behave this way. When I first created these tools, this
seemed like the best option. I am now starting to think that using 'on
the fly projection' coordinates might be a good feature to have. I
will have to evaluate this further, but for the time being, they do
both have to be in the same (or equivalent) CRSs.

I think I'll opt for the warning in fTools functions, however, does this not
already happen? I'm pretty sure the dialog that pops up after the operation
has completed says something like "Warning: Non-matching CRSs detected,
results might be unexpected" or something to that effect (I don't actually
have my result computer here to check)?

I have not filed a ticket. It appears to be an OS X issue and I am waiting to see if William is able to resolve the issue. Is it better to file this issue and the Identify Tool problem as one or separate tickets as they are both QGIS 1.7 SpatiaLite issues?

William was able to recreate the problem with his own SpatiaLite database, so it is not unique to my databases. To recreate the problem, get the sample SpatiaLite database files samples.tar.gz<http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-2.4.0/samples.tar.gz> from http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-2.4.0/index.html. There are four layers in the db3.sqlite database. Repeat loading these four layers into QGIS until you have a total of 80 layers. Save the project and quit QGIS. There will be a long delay quitting with GGIS 1.7 while QGIS 1.6 quits are instantaneously. The more layers you add to the project, the slower opening the project and quitting QGIS become.

Tested on Debian GNU Linux amd64, quitting takes a few seconds (I have
many plugins installed, this may influence it), not much longer than
closing it with no layer loaded.
All the best.

Hi Benoit.
Thanks for this. GRID_CODE.qml, but the labels are not complete (they
miss the code [e.g. 111]). If we can get the correct qml, I can send it
to the guys there, to have it included in the CORINE distribution.
All the best.

Strange...
Please check that the attached qml is correct?

Also, see picture at [1] showing the effect of the qml on the corine
dataset.

Thanks Martin for your help.

Can you, please, explain these words?

By the way, referring to my second question about the shortest path plugin,
can you advise-me about the best way to obtain this shortest paths between
any two points on a POINT layer, using a LINESTRING road network? 

Thanks a lot for your help.
David

Yes, this is what I get: colors are correct, labels are ok, but they
miss the CORINE code. IMHO, they should be:
111 - Urban...
instead of
Urban...

Thanks.

Sorry, I've misunderstood you.
Attached should be the correct qml, finally!

Please note that the 999-NODATA value is set to RGB(0,0,0). This is also
the value of the N/A (or transparent value) for QGIS (as defined in this
qml).

Best regards,
Benoit

Hi,
I compiled QGIS without problem earlier this week without any problem on
the exact same architecture (except the window manager):
KUbuntu 10.10 64 bits, Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Sep 15 2010, 16:22:56).
Could you share the exact sequence of commands you are doing? It might
help.

I can really only look into compilation possibilities.  The only other thing I can think of is Qt - my QGIS 1.6 is based on Qt 4.6 Cocoa, while recent dev builds are with Qt 4.7 Cocoa.

Mayeul we will apply this after we branch for release (probably around

Try to remove any existing install of QGIS first - if you have an
older install of QGIS alongside a development install, it can cause
such errors.

I have the problem with your QGIS v.1.7 r15108 dev build from Jan. 30 which uses QT 4.6.3. Since your QGIS 1.6 build of Jan. 29 also uses QT 4.6.3 and the same frameworks, doesn't that indicate it is not a QT problem?

Also, it would appear that the Identify tool problem is not a QT problem since it does not work with either QGIS 1.7 QT 4.7.2 or 4.6.3 and QGIS 1.6 QT 4.6.3 all using the SQLite framework with SQLite 3.7.4 and SpatiaLite 2.4.0 RC4. Since installing the older SQLite3_Framework-3.6.23-1.dmg fixes the Identify Tool and selection problem, this would indicate a problem with the SQLite3_Framework-3.7.4-2.dmg. However, this does not fix the slow load and quite times with QGIS 1.7. I tried building QGIS 1.7 against SQLite3_Framework-3.6.23-1 and the build failed, so I am concerned what side effects installing it may have.

I will pull comments from both threads and create bug reports for both problems later today.

The problem also occurs in Windows. I used the OSGEO4W installer to install QGIS 1.6 and QGIS 1.7 r15533 into a VMware virtual machine running Windows XP. I created an 80 layer project file by duplicating the 4 layers in the db3.sqlite sample database. With rendering off, QGIS 1.6 loads the project in 4.3 sec. while QGIS 1.7 takes 19 sec. QGIS 1.6 quits instantaneously while QGIS 1.7 takes 36 sec.

I have added progress signal to GDAL provider. Histogram progress is
updated only when histogram is calculated, stats progress is displayed
in main app status bar, that did non change with respect to pre
providers state however, I believe.

The status bars are not updated as frequently as the value on them is
set. I have no idea why. I have left debug output in
QgsRasterLayer::onProgress, you can compare it.

Yes, it works for many days (I believe I was reporting it's fixed). Thanks!

I think I got it.  There was a change in the Spatialite code that I missed in my Sqlite framework.  At some point multiple different uses of OMIT_GEOS and OMIT_PROJ were introduced.  In the past, tests in the code were like:

#if OMIT_GEOS == 0
  # code for *including* GEOS support
#endif

But now there are also tests like:

#ifndef OMIT_GEOS
  # code for *including* GEOS support
#endif

If I set OMIT_GEOS=0, then OMIT_GEOS is still defined, and the second test form fails.

QGIS compilation doesn't set OMIT_GEOS or OMIT_PROJ.  The only thing that's missed in the first form then are the GEOS and PROJ headers, which still seems to work without errors, so maybe they aren't actually used in the spatialite code.  There is also an OMIT_EPSG, but that still only uses the first test form.

I updated my SQLite framework and now Identify/Select works, and I think also the speed issue may be solved.  Download is online (still uploading the GDAL Complete, so download the individual Sqlite framework).

The install of  SQLite3_Framework-3.6.23-1 must be enabling a feature not enabled in the current SQLite framework.

Hi William,

all this makes a perfect sense, and fully 
explains the elusive "Identify tool" issue 
reported by Royce and Noli.

Where declaring OMIT_GEOS SpatiaLite will then 
be built ignoring at all any GEOS-based function.

i.e. the ST_Intersects() SQL function will be 
unsupported under such conditions; and consequently 
the QGIS own Identify Tool will obviously fail,
reporting a fatal "Undefined function" SQL error 
while attempting to execute the corresponding query.

Unhappily any error message raised by the QGIS 
SpatiaLite data provider is handled by the QgsDebugMsg() 
C++ function.
And consequently no message at all was shown to the 
user under ordinary release conditions.

Hi List,

while debugging the above issue noticed by Royce,
I casually discovered a major issue affecting
any recent (1.7.0) QGIS version.

Please note well: such issue affects any operating
system, and isn't at all specifically related to 
SpatiaLite: it's a much more general flaw affecting 
Map Canvas and Map Layer Registry handling. 

I've prepared a very small test suite you can use to
reproduce this issue in the easiest way: 
http://www.gaia-gis.it/merano_shp.zip

----------------------
shortly said: the test suite contains a SpatiaLite
DB storing some 110+ layers; anyway each single
layer simply contains one or two features only, 
so it is an ultra-light weighted dataset.
and I've included Shapefiles as well, exactly
corresponding to DB layers.

the same identical slowness affects both SpatiaLite
and Shapefiles (and I strongly suspect, any other vector
datasource): it looks like an exponentially increasing 
time is required to add (or remove) any further layer.
so adding very few layers requires a quite unnoticeable
time: but adding several tenths (or hundredths) layers
at the same time requires an intolerable time.

please note: the number of features actually stored into 
each single layer has very little effect.

I'll inform you about any further advancement.

can this be the reason why the user find qgis trunk generally slower

I undestand that.  But, what I'm saying is that there are 2 inconsistent uses of OMIT_GEOS and OMIT_PROJ.

#ifndef OMIT_GEOS makes sense (this may have been a recent change or I may have just not noticed it because I found ...==0 first in the code).  #if OMIT_GEOS == 0 is the one I've been using as a guide, and is more confusing to think about.

For #if OMIT_GEOS == 0 to work, I define OMIT_GEOS=0 (at least I had to do this in the past), which logically is the same as saying use GEOS.  But now USE_GEOS is defined, even though it's the 0 that means use GEOS.

The way they are used in the spatialite code (same goes for OMIT_PROJ):


#if OMIT_GEOS == 0
#include <geos_c.h>
#endif

...

#ifndef OMIT_GEOS
define Spatialite GEOS functions
#endif

Thanks for the testing suite. I have run it with a profiler and found
out that it is (surprisingly) caused by QgsSnappingDialog. It is
created on application startup, each time when a layer is added to map
layer registry it updates itself: creates tree widget items, combo
boxes etc. Disabling the update slot connection it takes ~3s to open
all the layers and quitting is instantaneous.

I wonder what would be the best fix for this. Probably a change from
tree widget to tree view+model: an added layer would only update the
model, not (re)create all the stuff. I will leave the fix for someone
else :-)

I've finally been able to identify the actual reason causing 
QGIS 1.7.0 to be intolerably slow when quitting or opening any
project containing several tenths (or hundredths) layers.

Here are timings I've measured *before* applying any patch:
project loading / map canvas update: 54 seconds
exiting from QGIS: 110 seconds

and the following ones are timings measured *after* patching:
project loading / map canvas update: 3 seconds
exiting from QGIS: instant

--------------

I've prepared a full-scale test DB (and related QGIS project):
http://www.gaia-gis.it/merano.7z 
- 18MB (compressed)
- 110+ layers
- about 100,000 total features
(may well be you need to manually adjust the QGIS project file
so to arrange paths accordingly to your specific test platform).

Timings reported above were actually measured using this sample.

-------------

Post Mortem analysis:

each time QGIS 1.7.0 adds (or removes) a single layer, an
attempt is performed in order to update the MapCanvas (and
related toolery).
So, when adding (or removing) several layers at the same
time, the following actions are actually performed:

step #1: adding the layer #1, updating the MapCanvas
         (containing 1 layer)
step #2: adding the layer #2, updating the MapCanvas
         (containing 2 layers)
step #3: adding the layer #3, updating the MapCanvas
         (containing 3 layers)
.........
step #50: adding the layer #50, updating the MapCanvas
         (containing 50 layers)
.........
step #100: adding the layer #100, updating the MapCanvas
         (containing 100 layers)
.......... and so on .............

this fully explains why the time required to open some project
grows exponentially as the total number of layers increases.

my "experimental" patch simply defers actual MapLayers insertion
(or deletion), so to perform a single massive operation instead
of many distinct 'atomic' operations.

-----------------

Please Note Well: I'll *not* commit my "experimental" patch to the SVN;
my own understanding of QGIS MapCanvas (and related) is really
rudimentary and approximative :-)

I suppose some other developer can design a much more
effective and elegant patch: anyway, just for studying
purposes, you'll find my SVN DIFF here:
http://www.gaia-gis.it/svn-diff-patch.zip

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS plugin problems with vectors under Windows
Message-ID: <1300655444.1869.25.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

today I was reviewing my exercises I use to teach in QGIS courses and I
found that with qgis 1.6/trunk under Windows there are serious problems
with vectors operations like a simple v.in.ogr.

This is confirmed also by Paolo who gave a course last week and pointed
me to these problems.

I the spent a few hours today doing tests on XP/Seven with 1.6/trunk
installed with osgeo4w, 1.6 standalone and 1.5 standalone and the
results are resumed here

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3646
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3648
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3650

The only usable version at the moment seems the 1.5 standalone, but I
can also confirm that a month ago at another course I didn't noticed the
problems described in 3648 and 3650 with qgis 1.6/trunk.

If the release of the 1.7 is going to be delayed I suggest also to
backport in 1.6/osgeo4w the fix of this bug

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3602

as at the moment is likely that qgis 1.6/osgeo4w will crash during the
mapset creation process.

Under Linux it seems to work all fine.

cheers

The code "updating" the layer list in the snapping dialog was constantly
removing everything and recreating all entries.   Fixed in r15545.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] rendering behavior options not available
Message-ID: <793D3C40-E17F-4A22-9A94-27DEF5E42D06@kyngchaos.com>

I wanted to test the recent [spatialite] loading speed issue by turning layers off before saving a project.  There is a QGIS render preference to turn on/off layers by default when adding them to a project, but it is greyed out (and checked on), along with the other render behavior options, # features to draw and render cache (unchecked).  I think it's always been greyed out as far back as I can remember.

Why are these options present if they can't be changed?  Do I need to enable something in compilation?  Is it dependent on another option?  If they can't be changed at all, they shouldn't be shown in the application preferences.

Hi William,

I believe this all can be traced back to this:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/8421

Although I am not sure if that is true of the option to turn the on/off when loaded. I manually turned on the 'qgis.new_layers_visible' in the plist file and it seems to work fine.

Ah, it appears that the "fix" for Mac rendering redraw problems was to disable the entire groupBox_5 in the qgsoptions.cpp file for Mac systems.

Here is a patch to allow that option to be set on OS X systems. It does not get at the root concern about unavailable items being present in the gui.

And speaking of gui issues on OS X, can you confirm if the Help menu item is not showing up as the third item from the right in the menubar? That is so for me, but it should be the rightmost item.

Hi,
I have noticed that I was set as tickets owner, but I am not
QGIS-GRASS maintainer. It is better to leave owner blank, so that it
is clear that nobody is working on that.

Confirmed; more generally, we badly need a GRASS maintainer, otherwise
problems will accumulate to the point of rendering the plugin unreliable
(we are close to this, for vectors on Windows).
Any taker?
All the best.

Yes, you were the maintainer long ago. Your ticket should be edited.

Hi William,

thanks a lot for noticing this inconsistencies.
For sure I'll restore them to a fully consistent
state in the next SpatiaLite release.

Looks like this is the only workable solution... I'll go with this for now,
though it seems that the first solution should really work...

Oh, I wonder if it was the moving menu setup to the UI file:

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/15383/trunk/qgis

That would put plugin menus after the main app menus, including the Help menu.

I don't have a mac in order to try that out - what has changed on mac
after that commit? It contained quite a lot of changes, so I have
missed something mac-specific.

Hi,

Great!
In the meantime, to test the compatibility of the symbol levels patch
with commits made since r15217, I just proposed a  patch against r15538
adding symbol levels in rule-based renderer (on top of r15217). It is a
minimalist patch which adds a quick fix for symbol levels and a
"Priority column" (instead of "ID" in previous patch) which is necessary
to know what is the, er... priority of rules when symbol levels are used
(since only first matched rule will be used).
It's there:  http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222
patch_on_r15538-rbr_with_symbol_levels.diff

I'm testing it and I'll put on trac any issue I might find.
Regards,
Mayeul

Hi All

Just a reminder that we will enter string freeze from tomorrow. I will
put in the 'whats new' strings some time today and then I am done with
string changes from my side. I'll post another note tomorrow reminding
everyone that string changes are in effect. If you are a native
english speaker and have noticed any oddities in the text anywhere in
the user interface, please let us know asap so we can fix it before
the strings go into freeze!

 Thank you for reporting this bug. I'm aware of it and should fix it as 
 soon as I find time to do it.

 In the meantime, could I ask you to check that a file with the same 
 name as your raster and with extension bccPAL1 exists in the same folder 
 as your raster and then delete it? It should sort out the problem.

 Best regards,
 Benoit

Hi, 
excuse me for "intruding" your developers list . Since last week I am
watching the news from Japan and also found forwarded message from japan
qgis translator. I came to this idea. I know that the last version was named
after the mine in Chile, where the accident happened. What do you think
about naming the following QGIS version after some Japanese town ? maybe
Minamisanriku (the most damaged town with tsunami ? almost wiped out) ? just
as a gesture of solidarity? Just an idea ...

regards

Jan

PS: nothing against Wroclaw  - we can keep this for next QGIS version

 I don't want to sound cold-hearted but wroclaw has the advantage of 
 being related to a qgis' event, we didn't change the name for 1.4 after 
 Haiti.

hi!

at times of 1.4 we did have the scheme of naming after moons of planets ..
to my knowledge showing support for desasters started with 1.6 Copiapo

So 1.7 would be the next ..

the only thing I probably dislike is that .. releases of QGIS will get 
always connected to desasters .. Is this good? ;)

But if we could do some useful things with our splash screen - and it 
fits .. I'm still +1 for supporting the Japanese people..

Agreed. I also wouldn't like to link every version of QGIS to a
different disaster. Once started, it would be difficult to stop.
All the best.

I would strongly prefer to use names that connect QGIS releases with
some positive feelings.

Hi all.
Thanks for the suggestion. However, IMHO requiring the installation of a
WPS server, plus the configuration of all modules, is a rather heavy
requirement, and it will make the installation of the whole beast much
more cumbersome.
Furthermore, 52N is in java, which will make things only worse.
In addition, this does not seem a short term solution, and I think we
need something working smoothly *now*.
All the best.

 +1 - I wouldn't like to connect the QGIS name with disasters all the 
 time.

 I think there are other ways to declare our solidarity with the 
 Japanese people.

 I thought we already decided on 'Wroclaw' as the next name?

I just dug thru my Time Machine backups and have an r15395 with the buggered Help menu order.  So that narrows it down.

It's just a general change, nothing Mac specific that I can see, other than some Mac blocks that are changed like all the rest.  But maybe it affects Macs differently for the menu ordering.  Note that it needs r15387 to compile on a Mac (some bits were missed).

So, where does the Help menu appear on other systems?  Now and before r15382 (if anyone can remember)

Hi all.
When clipping an ECW, I get a clipped layer that is shifted and of lower

not take into account the correct georeferencing.
Anyone confirms?

Hi all.
Apparently, adf files are filtered out by the plugin, even if "all
supported files" is selected, and adf files are supported by current
GDAL installation: is this a local problem?
All the best.

"Copiap?" had nothing to do with negative feelings... on the contrary it
was suggested because after all it was a location know everywhere for
positive reasons... the miners were rescued :)

Exactly. I didn't want to say that "Copiap?" was a bad name, quite contrary!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Print Composer question & Batch print multiple maps
Message-ID: <50474.38682.qm@web30004.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,
 Perhaps you can point me in the right direction. I have a very 
detailed map and would like to create say 20 zoomed in maps for print, 
say 36" x 48" 

  This is an article for arcmap which demonstrates
 similar functionality "HowTo:  Print a large map as panels or tiles 
with ArcPress or ArcMap"
http://resources.arcgis.com/content/kbase?fa=articleShow&d=25292


If
 I were to manually create multiple print composers, I guess I could 
potentially use the "multiple compositions helper plugin"  and print all
 of them in one click. How would I ensure that the print composers are 
on the same x and y axis? Is there an easy way to copy or clone print 
composers?


 Or even better, If I were to deliver a shape file
 with boundaries for each 36"x 48" print , could I use a batch process 
and print the map inside each boundary? For Example If I have a list of 
neighborhoods, or a shape file with contains a grided boundary, couId I 
create an output from each boundary?

I used to do this with an 
arcview script where it would select the layer with the boundaries and 
clip the map inside the boundary and send to print.

  Thanks,
  -J

Hi Paolo,

I always see a small shift when I clip rasters with gdaltools,
regardless of the format.

Not sure about this, but in my tests the clipped image has the same
system of the input one.

I used trunk on both linux and windows with the latest gdaltools version
available.

For me on Windows it shows up to the left of the Raster and SelectPlus
menus,
and to the right of the CadTools, Vector and Database menus.
I'm currently running r15490; I noticed it change some time ago, but I'm
not sure exactly when.

Hi

I also feel deep empathy for the Japanese people affected by the
quake, but I think that we should avoid a slippery slope of calling
QGIS after world events. Sooner or later political sensitivities will
enter into the equation and we are a multinational, non-partisan,
independent, bring a little light into your life kind of project :-)
So lets go with Wroclaw and celebrate the kind folks who put a lot of
work in to make the last hackfest happen.

@marco I could only find one trademark referencing Wroclaw here:

http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/cntcTrademarkSearch?check.x=1&check.y=1&companyName=Wroclaw&pageIndex=1&refineSearch=false

The company seems to operate in a different market sector and it isnt
clear from their logo that Wroclaw is the principle part of the name.

http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/cntcTrademarkDetails?trademarkId=E8276305

Granted I'm not a trademark lawyer, but it seems to me safe for us to
use the Wroclaw name.

Of course we would probably need to search like that on every
trademark database in the world before we really could be sure...

I think even a future 'Lisbon' release would probably be fine unless
there is competing GIS software also called Lisbon....

Regards

Tim

Thanks I had left if ASCII-fied (can I say that? :-) because I
remember last time we had issues with unicode, and also I have no idea
how to make that funny 'l' on my keyboard. Lets leave it with the
'proper' spelling until we encounter a problem.

Speaking of this tool, why not use gdal_translate with srcwin or
projwin parameters rather? Using merge to clip is quite unintuitive.
In my courses we often run into issues where users have more than one
raster layer visible when using the clip tool and then they get a
merge of the two - not at all what they were expecting! The merge tool
is still nice to have (but called 'merge') rather :-).

Just something to think about for the future.

Also any chance to include Frank's hsv_merge.py tool in gdal tools?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <AANLkTimce_cyQ5Dvs2xK4v0F3ExV4M6cNBJwLKqg7Y5i@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Please note that string freeze should now be in effect. Werner if you
could update the ts files and get the translators to do their thing
that would be great!

Bug fixing can continue in trunk (but no string changes please),
planned branch for release date remains at 7 April.

We'll aim to get the release announcement out by 13 April so that we
can start the hackfest....developer meeting...with 1.7 behind us....

Release team (Anita & Anne I'm looking at you! :-) and anyone else who
is interested, could you help by turning the whats new list (see Help
-> About -> Whats new?) into a visual changelog with fleshed out
descriptions and lots of nice piccies? It would be nice to take the
screenies all with the same desktop theme for visual consistency. We
can just use wiki formatting as per 1.6.0 release and direct users to
that wiki page on release.

The release checklist on the wiki is up here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Release_Checklist_1.7

And the visual changelog is here: http://www.qgis.org/wiki/VisualChangeLog1.7.0

Tim

Actually we do already. Well, at least please remember about it making the 
splash screen:)

Did you fix the plugin installer to cope with utf-8 in the release name on
Windows?

If so please fix the release name again - otherwise I just fixed it ;)

Hi.
If I understand it correctly, you can just print to pdf and let your
print manager split the large pdf into one series of pages, deciding how
much overlap between pages etc.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Immediate crashes when touching docked panels
Message-ID: <4D8997E4.4010606@gista.sk>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi, I have reported two tickets (#3655, #3579) against latest trunk
version about segfaults when doing something with docked panels
(attribute table, layer tree ...).
In my case, moving with any docked panel can crash application.

It seems that it is more case with older Qt versions (for example 4.4.3
which is in Debian Lenny).

Can somebody look at it, or at least confirm?

Hi Charlie,

I have check the environment path variables and everything is properly set.
On further R&D, I found that it is not able to find core.lib, gui.lib in
QGIS_INSTALLATION_DIR/PYTHON/QGIS.

I want to know that how do we generate core.lib and gui.lib ? Which project
is responsible for generating these library files. The project
"python_module_qgis_core" generated only core.pyd, it don't generate
core.lib.

Please let me know how do I generate above files ????

thanks in Advance.
QGIS Learner

Hi all.
With current trunk, if I load a vector which has in the same folder a
style (.qml) with the same name, classified by graduated symbol (old
symbology), this is not automatically shown. I have to go to Layer
properties and choose the classification field.
Is this a local problem, or a genuine bug?
All the best.

Sure. Who will create the screenshots (or which desktop theme should we
use)? Should we also put some new screenshots on the website? If I recall
correctly, most of them are still from 1.0 or even pre-1.0.

At the risk of causing a mass migration from the hairy hordes when
they see how beautiful linux is, lets use maybe gnome clearlooks or
something distro agnostic. I think its ok to use mac/linux/ubuntu
screenshots but standardised for each platform. eg.

Linux: Gnome Clearlooks
Win: WinXP 'toys r us' look
Mac: ok no choice here :-)

It would be actually nice to have on the front page the same project
loaded on each platform and the three screenshots superimposed to give
the user an immediate impression of 'this thing runs everywhere'.

Btw. Is there a bug I'm not aware? The installer should now cope with unicode

If you can handle someone with a clearly untidy mind, I'm willing to help.

If there are packages, I really don't mind what platform you want screenshots from.

-ramon.

Great, looks perfect. Now I'll try to convince people at EEA to add it

I have found somebody else with the same problem, different sw:
http://groups.google.com/group/linux.debian.bugs.dist/browse_thread/thread/16160a5506c0a7a6
Apparently it is related to KDE; I removed kde-full kde-plasma-desktop

Any hint?

Hi,

does the new symbology engine support to create complex double boundaries as
shown in the attached image (see arrows). 

a) A Dash Dash Dot boundary and inside a blue line
b) A boundary with Dashes and inside a line with Dots

Thanks a lot

 yes - both cases are possible. You can use the line offsets, custom 
 dashing and marker lines. Maybe you can even do without the markers.

 Let me know if you need help.

This may be a solution, although would like to create individual images which i can save.  Also the original image would be almost 12 ft x 16 ft, which would probably create a massive file and freeze my computer.  I am willing to give it a try! 

What about a tiling solution? When you render and precache, could i control the starting point and scale? Do you have any suggestions?

I'm experiencing a crash similar to the one described in Ticket #3326.
The ticket is closed and states "Fixed in r14934. "
How can I know if r14934 is 1.6 or 1.7? If it's fixed for 1.7 it's ok,
but if the comment claims that the ticket is solved for 1.6, then it's not true,
as I'm getting a crash every time I change the color of one given
symbol on 1.6.0.1

The ticket I have open was an enhancement one and it has a low priority.
If for you it is an essential feature you may want to consider support
its development

Hi all,

I would recommend building something with the spearfish6 dataset, available with GRASS or from their website, I believe. You can create something fairly complex in appearance there. Just make sure everyone is working from the same projection now that raster OTF is implemented.

I helped several people with this a few weeks ago. In almost all cases
it was due to KDE updates from KDE-Backports. Rolling back all
KDE-backports seemed to fix it.

There's something about the new version of KDE (4.6?) that gets the sip
version out of sync with something else and QGIS doesn't like the combo
of them. I don't know the full details.

Thanks,
Alex

Thanks I think I got it (I'm waiting for the compilation to finish).
No backports here (I'm on unstable), but this should be the bug:

Hi.
If I understand it correctly, you can just print to pdf and let your
print manager split the large pdf into one series of pages, deciding how
much overlap between pages etc.
All the best.

Hi Andreas,

thanks a lot for the hint. I almost managed to create a) and b). But I
don't understand exactly how to create a new Dash Dash Dot line with the "use
custom dash pattern" function. Can you give me a hint, how to do this?

Thanks a lot
 Otto

Oh sorry I was mixing it up with Maverick/Natty ubuntu users. Though you
are probably running into the same issue since Debian unstable probably
has the same stuff that's in kubuntu's KDE-backports - latest sip & qt.

That bug seems to be on the right track. FYI, this has been seen to
effect Fedora and Suse builds too if people are using really new
versions of sip.

Probably just an issue somewhere in the sip python bindings to qt.
Guess that highlights why "unstable" isn't always suitable for daily
desktop use.

Thanks,
Alex

On my system Help menu appears as the last one in the menu bar in both
svn trunk and threading branch (which has been forked off trunk about
9 moths ago).

Yes, but someone has to test everything out, anyway.

Hi Otto,

I would use three elements in pattern:
Dash	Space
5	5
5	5
1	5

This effect you are looking for?

Hi Andreas and Robert,

thanks a lot for your hints! The pattern is almost what I am looking for. I
will try to "improve" it a little more and send the result then.

 Otto

Hi Jordan
I read the ticket
In the "Scenarios tried" the following has not been tested.

I just tried with success an AO export to svg. I opened in Inkscape then
saved as PDF. Here you can print as poster in small pieces.

Also you can try the print as postscript function in the composer.

I have tried with middle size maps; tell me if it works for you.
Regards,
Mayeul

Message-ID: <28964343-5111-4102-9AA5-97634D5C482E@westnet.com.au>

Hello,

Is it possible to get the following files included in the projections folder (/usr/share/proj or equivalent).
http://www.icsm.gov.au/icsm/gda/gdatm/national66.zip
http://www.icsm.gov.au/icsm/gda/gdatm/national84.zip

To work properly they need to be unzipped and renamed to agd66.gsb and agd84.gsb respectively.

They are licenced under the CC by A (Australia), as confirmed below, requiring only attribution to the ICSM.

This should then close ticket 3099 [1,2,3] and result in a bundle of happy Australians that would then roam across the country extolling how wonderful QGIS is :)

If they're too big to go in the distro, let me know and I'll rig some instructions into the wiki.

-ramon.
[1] http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3099
[2] Something roughly like this has been added to the ticket
[3] If it ends up that we're having trouble getting resulting QGIS generated AGD shape files recognised in other GIS packages (to Brett and myself the .prj files look a little weird, and Brett is currently checking this out) then we should use a new ticket for that.

I can't find it now, but I thought someone on the forum a while ago had
posted some scripts making a start towards this.

These are the only related threads I can find now: 
http://forum.qgis.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&p=12401
http://forum.qgis.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&p=14382

Does anyone else remember someone working on this?

Hi Ramon

Isn't this something that should be done by the proj.4 project? Or by 
distributions such as osgeo4w?

This should probably be better added to proj.4.  I've just added links to the
frontpage[1].

 Improper vertical spacing in legend (Ticket #3605), need to revert
 changeset 15242 (by mhugent) to fix issue

Greetings,

Few weeks ago, QGIS trunk started rendering composer's legend with
odd/unneeded vertical spaces (see http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3605 for
a screenshot of issue).

I believe the problem is caused by changset 15242, applied by mhugent 4
weeks ago. The changset pulled the "currentYCoord += mLayerSpace" code out
of the "if ( !layerItem->text().isEmpty() )". This goes against QGIS' logic
allowing for empty layer title string to skip the layer title printing in
legend.

It'd be good to revert this change prior to the release of QGIS 1.7.

Regards to the QGIS team, you're doing a great job.

Hi Mathieu

I'm going to look at it soon. Changeset 15242 was actually a fix for another 
bug, but maybe it introduced a new problem.

Marco

Thanks J?rgen and Marco,

I know a little about QGIS (although a bit more every day), and less about proj.4.

It's now also in as ticket 101 (http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ticket/101).

Do all of the CRS definitions that QGIS uses derive from proj.4?
Would that include names of CRS that are used in prj files?

Hi Marco,

thanks for replying... It was able to find SIP and PyQt. But it is not able
to find core.lib, gui.lib from Python/QGIS directory. How do we build these
files? Where is source code to build these files ? These files are available
with default Quantam GIS Installation Setup. I want to build them so that
they are compatible with Python 27. I am not able to find any documentation
about these files.

thanks in advance,
Afzal

Hi all.
While translating, I found a sting:
Date defined position
Should this be:
Data defined position?
All the best.

is there any way to define an arbitrary CRS in QGIS?
For example, based on rows and cols of a raster layer.

I'm using it and do not experience crashes, but

In label old generation there is already:
Data defined placement
Data defined properties
Data defined buffer
Data defined position
in qgis r15554.
I do not know where the "Date defined position" is but I guess this
should be "Data".

have corrected it here and will commit it as soon as 1.7 is branched ..

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=xSL8+5X=s3wXaZLHMUGm2oAeHX=689+gL2kE7@mail.gmail.com>

In Reference to a Google SoC project idea from 2010, What if any progress
was made on this project idea last year?
Basic Vector Conversions, Manipulations

   - Implement a suite of basic semi-automated topology editing tools that
   are commonly missing from most GIS packages.
      - Points <-> Lines
      - Points <-> Polygons
      - Lines <-> Polygons (ftools does have Polygon to Polyline)
      - New Point based on distance and bearing (include option for
      automatic declination calculation)
      - Create new points along a line at specified distance, or by sample
      quantity.
   - These are all aggregation or disaggregation based on common id fields.
   - Similar in function to the ET Geowizards tool published for ArcGIS by
   3rd Party

Thank you,

jackie

I think a couple of them have been partially implemented as multiple
plugins. It would be great to bring them all under a common menu and to
make the interface consistent and robust (ie be able to choose a column
to group features by).

Here are the plugins I know about related to this:
Point2One
MergeShapes
JoinLines
qgsAzumith
Split Feature
spatial operations (appears obsolete, I can't even load it to see what's
in it)
ftools has Polygon to Lines

I look forward to you applying to working on this task as much of the
original description was written by me and I'd be happy to co-mentor
under someone else who's closer to the QGIS core dev.

Thanks,
Alex

Wouldn't this be a bug? Wouldn't it be better to fix it before release?
I also found Slop instead of Solpe in GdalTools.

Hi!

As it does not affect any function i would not consider it as a "bug"..
It's an annoyance and should have been cleaned out before string freeze 
(IMHO).
Of course - if the release manager gives his ok to adjust this strings 
to the correct writing i will do it. And surely I'd like to see all 
strings correct in the release. (in which file of gdaltools is the 
second misspelling?)

But that also means a (of course rather small) string update in all 
languages leading to 2 new "untranslated" strings .. Of course they are 
already translated but point to the wrong original ..

Tim? Think you are the one to decide that ..

kind regards
Werner

Works here without problems also ..
Using latest (Self compiled) trunk and gentoo linux as base..

The only thing not working here (which i currently use) is the
Spectral Analyses plugin. If anyonw can tell me where to search when i
get such an error:
 File "C:/Users/macho/.qgis/python/plugins\spectral_profile\spectral.py",
line 164, in finished
    symbols = vl[contador].renderer().symbols()
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'symbols'

would be nice ..
But vuale tool is working on all my computers..

Hi,

I have build the QGIS for MS Visual Studio 2008. But I am getting problem
when using OpenLayers Plugin.
When I try to add "Google Satellite" I am able to see only labels but not
map. Instead of map I am getting message as "Sorry, we have no imagery
here".
I am able to see the map and labels when I add "Google Streets" map.

Please help me with this....

thanks in Advance

FYI: fTools now also has lines to polygons, and it also has an
'extract nodes' tool, which extracts nodes from lines and polygons as
points.
>> ? ? ? - Create new points along a line at specified distance, or by sample quantity.
This will likely also be added to fTools soon.

Hi Barry and Stephan,
Any news about extracting data from mxd ?

Building on your "strings -e l" I am able to extract list of shapefiles from
mxd but I wonder how to expand this to the other layer types in an mxd, of
if by now there are OS tools to do this.

My current, limited code is:
grep -A 2 "Shapefile Feature Class" foo.mxd  | sed -e ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/\t/g' 
-e 's/\t--\t/\n/g' | sed -e '/^Shapefile Feature Class\tShape\t/d' -e
's/^Shapefile Feature Class\t//g' -e 's/\tShapefile Feature
Class\tShape\t/\t/g' > foo_shapefiles.csv

 All I've discovered at the moment is that if you dump it using
"strings -e l foo.mxd" on a Linux box you can actually see the file
names of shapefiles and geotiffs - they're stored as UTF-16 strings.
But being able to locate where in the whole mush of strings that whizz
past so you could automatically strip them out is another problem.

 If I actually had this problem on a one-off, say someone gave me a
MXD with two layers and the accompanying shapefiles, I'd probably just
do it manually - start Qgis, load two layers. With a hundred layers
I'd probably get the filenames and make a Qgis project file
programmatically. But given that extracting anything other than the
layer file names and ordering (styling, for example) is just about
impossible I'd probably do it from the filenames rather than the MXD
itself. But anyway, for me the break-even point for automating this is
about 20 layers, and that might only happen once in my lifetime...

Can you tell us, which versions of QGIS and the OpenLayers Plugin you're 
using?

Hi Paolo,

This is "normal" behaviour. It is the same situation than with the 
label. They are two generations of diagrams. The second generation uses 
the PAL library for diagram placement that integrates with the label 
engine. It avoids overlapping between labels and diagrams. Furthermore 
you can combine manual with automated placement in the same layer. The 
reason the old diagram overlay is still there, is that the bar charts 
had'nt yet been ported to the new diagram engine. Simply a lack of time. 
With QGIS 1.8, only the new engine will be present.

I know - it is not ideal.

Hi!

Ok i fixed both typos - I also think it's better to have a clean
original english interface ..
But usually those things should get fixed before the freeze ;)

Message-ID: <AANLkTinSpDA8zEQ7Yv-pwj1GDvm4wimAt6s8aC5QjudZ@mail.gmail.com>

I would like feedback on these ideas for fTools, and some information about
what the current activity is with fTools.


Documentation - Improve the ftools_help.xml files by filling in the 'inputs,
parameters and additional information'.

Plugins - Develop a plugin for fTools, based on suggestions from the fTools
developers regarding what is currently needed/wanted.

Vector Menu - Integrate existing plugins so they can become part of the core
qgis plugins, included in the 'Vector' menu.

Help Button - Add help buttons to each tool vector tool UI which link to the
fTools help file.


Thank you,

Carson, would you be interested in mentoring Jackie for GSoC to work on
adding more stuff to ftools and improving things. Since ftools is your
baby you're probably the best qualified and this might be a good chance
to get your wishlist taken care of in addition to things mentioned in
the previous thread.

Thanks,
Alex

How does the QGIS community think about organizing the QGIS plugins as drupal organizes their modules with their community?

We could even borrow the drupal framework to organize the QGIS site.? I would be willing to contribute some time to develop the site.

? This could potentially allow:

?? A web-based location which is search-able through google
?? Module documentation and comments to grow
?? Better support from more community members

We've already started down being able to organize plugins with
plugins.qgis.org (not 100% done). If you have ideas about how to create
order to that via tagging/searching by all means feel free to suggest
and work on the code for the site.

Message-ID: <6709b59dfaeacabae6b9ad47a4f15e2f@imap.gis3w.it>

HI all,

I'm workin with 1.7.0-100 trunk-vers of QGIS on Windows XP platform

When I try to remove a GRASS vector (with g.remove or with an overwrite),
the first time I have this error message:

Unable to delete file
'C:/datigrass/Toscana/PERMANENT/vector/battenti/hist'


If I replicate the command a second time, it works perfectily.


Anyone have the same error?

Hi devs,
Can anybody confirm that
self.connect(self.iface.legendInterface(), SIGNAL("groupIndexChanged(int,
int)"), self.testSlot

does it actually work as expected?

i'm connecting this way to that signal but i get no slot calls...
i've no problems with other signals.

thanks a lot
Marco

Yes. As I wrote recently, the GRASS plugin on win has serious problems
with vector support. We badly need a maintainer of it. Unfortunately, my
appeal did not raise enough interest.
Anybody who needs GRASS-QGIS on windows is strongly suggested to come
and help.
All the best.

Hi All,

> Documentation - Improve the ftools_help.xml files by filling in the 'inputs, parameters and additional information'.
Yes please, fTools documentation is definitely in need of
improvements. However, I would prefer to 'leave behind' the
ftools_help.xml file in favor of the more integrated help system that
QGIS uses (see comment about help button below).
> Plugins - Develop a plugin for fTools, based on suggestions from the fTools developers regarding what is currently needed/wanted.
This is also a great opportunity to add some of the features that
users have been requesting. It might also be nice to have a vote, and
simply build the most sought after tool (within the parameters of your
(or whoever ends up building it) interests of course)
> Vector Menu - Integrate existing plugins so they can become part of the core qgis plugins, included in the 'Vector' menu.
This is always something people are looking for, but we always need to
make sure we are only explicitly adding plugin that have a strong-ish
track record for stability, are general enough that most everyone will
want to have them as part of their vector arsenal, and that someone is
willing to maintain/bug fix the tool(s). Because the Vector menu is
installed by default, I would recommend only stable and/or extremely
useful/universally applicable tools make it into this menu as part of
the QGIS core plugins. However, I don't see a problem with making it
easier to 'add' plugins to the Vector menu as additional 'add-ons'
that users can install themselves after the initial QGIS install.
> Help Button - Add help buttons to each tool vector tool UI which link to the fTools help file.
Again, yes please! Help buttons on all the tools would be excellent.
However, as I mentioned above, a proper integration with the existing
QGIS help system would be much better, and would facilitate
translations etc, which simply isn't feasible with the (very basic)
XML file I am currently using. As an additional note, the XML file and
about dialog have been removed from trunk in favor of the main QGIS
about dialog. So this is obviously a good time to re-implement the
help in a more integrated fashion.
A short help page for each tool, with a simple diagram, explanation,
parameters and their uses, plus links to relevant cites (wikipedia
atticles, OGC for each tool would be great. See
http://jaspa.forge.osor.eu/ST_Buffer.html for a nice simple example of
what could be done within the QGIS help framework.

I would be more than happy to mentor Jackie for a GSoC project, and
fTools/Vector menu could really use the attention :-)
Please also see my comments to the suggestions/points above.

I am not really familiar with drupal plugin organisation, but I should
mention that we are busy overhauling the plugins web site and various other
web infrastructure elements. There will be further work taking place on this
at the hackfest. If you have specific requirements, discuss them on the
mailing list and get them added to a wiki page which can be brought to
Martin, Alessandro and Borys' attention.

Hi,

I'm translating the Tips, this sentence caught my eye :

"The GPL places a restriction that any modifications you make must be 
made available to the Quantum GIS project"

This is misleading, you only have to share your modification if you 
distribute the binaries to somebody else. And even then you only have to 
give access to the source code to the receivers, you don't have to send 
your changes directly to the project.

For example if an geographic institute called *** made a client based on 
QGIS supporting its in-house DRM access protocol, it would only have to 
make the code available when distributing this version outside of the 
institute.

Jean Roc

Hi Jean Roc,
I would suggest to change this tip to something widely accepted, for
instance:

----------------------
Quantum GIS 1.7 is released under the GNU General Public License
[version 3, am I correct?? or "version 3 or above"?].
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to

software for all its users.
----------------------
The above sentences (after the first one) are the first three sentences
of the Preamble of the GNU GPL v3, here:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html
This is already translated in many languages here:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/translations.html
so this should help have have it translated by QGIS translators.

For reference, I copy below the message on QGIS' license posted by Marco
3 weeks ago:

Hi devs

Following up on ticket 3432 (License conflict with GPLv3+ libs), I had
a 
discussion with Volker about it . The conclusion was that there is no
conflict, 
but the only way to distribute QGIS currently is under the terms of the
GPLv3. 
This is because most of the source files are under GPLv2+ (version2 or
any 
later version). However, PAL and the sqlanywhere plugin/provider sources
are 
GPLv3+.

In my opinion, GPLv3 shouldn't be a problem for the project. From the
GNU 
page, the major changes seem to be a clause that forbids discriminatory
patent 
deals and one that does not allow sueing DRM hackers.

I tested/used the plugin extensively on both windows (seven) and linux
(Ubuntu 32bit) in the last days and no crashes (qgis trunk and older
versions).

It works pretty good with *non* GRASS rasters, while with GRASS rasters
is very slow (on Windows, acceptable on linux) and has another problem:
when passing the mouse outside the extent of the raster it does not says
"out of extent" and it doesn't show correctly the NULL pixels, as it
continue to show the value of the last non NULL pixel where the mouse
passed over.

Do you want me to open a ticket?

cheers

I think we should stick to Python as much as possible for non-core
plugins. Our experience of non-core C++ plugins has never been
especially brilliant: they fall very easily in the shadow, they are very
difficult to have in many different platform, to keep in synch with
changes in trunk, and they end up being much less used than they would
deserve.
In brief, my suggestion is: either a non core Python plugin, or a core C
++ one (including the dependency on OTB).

Yes, I would suggest to have a look to this; in case it does not solve
it entirely, it would be a good idea to further improve the raster
provider to add support for this.

All the best.

Explanation for GRASS list: he is talking about "Value tool" which is
displaying a raster value under cursor.

In the GRASS provider, I have followed the recommended use of GRASS in
applications, that means, if a value on certain pixel is requested, it
runs GRASS module (executable) with coordinates as parameter and
receives a value from stdout.

If a user moves cursor over the whole map, it may run the GRASS module
some 1000 times on medium size screen. If there are 10 maps open in
QGIS, it starts 10000 executables in about 1 second. That is probably
a bit slow.

We could add some delay in the Value tool plugin to avoid too many
requests, but that is not solution if the values have to be logged
somehow, for example to draw a chart.

It seems that instead of running the GRASS module each time, we have
to keep it running and send coordinates to the module via stdin.

Can GRASS developers give us any suggestion how to solve this?

maybe a little :)

I do not suggest this as a correct solution, but fyi r.what can
take multiple input maps in a single call. It can also take
multiple input coords in a single call, so you can at least
queue you queries into bigger sized chunks if you like, which
would ease the pain a little.

as a long term solution, would a from-scratch LGPL native GDAL
driver help? ... Possible Summer of Code project for someone?

That is impossible in QGIS, where the functionality is implemented in
data providers, one per layer, which know nothing about other layers.

Maybe, but probably source of other problems, because it has to be
implemented in GRASS provider, and that means to add a little delay to
find if there are more values requested and that is not desired for
all tasks.

BTW the Value Tool with WCS via GDAL or WMS in QGIS (currently
disabled right?) could also be interesting, anybody tested? Does GDAL
WCS cancel running requests if another comes? Does it keep list of all
opened requests with an id?

Do you mean de facto new GRASS raster library? Thread safe, exceptions
support etc... That could help.

That would be possible. Do you mean a cache on driver level? Is it a
cache used  in QGIS for rendering somewhere at this moment? Is it
desired? 1000x800x8 = 64MB / layer, 10 layers ~ 0.6GB. What about
threads (map composer, globe)?

Rasters in fact, are not drawn as a single block, the picture is split
into more pieces, and that would also complicate caching.

The layer has a cacheImage(), which the map renderer fills if render caching is
enabled.  identify could probably use that - if the data is available in the
raw image at all.

Just a thought. However I wasn't obvious to me however - on a quick look - how
we know the current extent of the cached image.  It might be still worth
exploring.

In the rendering branch I have already deprecated that cacheImage()
method: it causes various bugs with multiple map renderers in use
(they overwrite the cached image) and with threaded rendering it gets
completely wrong. I have implemented caching of map layers that is
handled by map renderers.

But there is still a problem that cached layer image does not contain
the original raster values.

To be honest I doubt there's much point in queuing a burst of
queries, but a 100-500ms delay between individual queries would
both greatly cut down on the number of process calls and not be
very noticeable to the user. Doesn't totally solve the problem,
but it would help to mitigate it.
what tasks is that not desired for? It can't be restricted to the
mouse-over bits?

Not really, I mean re-writing the GDAL grass6 raster plugin from
scratch to not depend on the existing GRASS GPL libraries.
We want this in place anyway so we change change the raster
format/file structure in GRASS 7 but still allow users to access
old GRASS 6 maps seamlessly using the r.external module (which is
a live frontend to GDAL). Also, it has been a long-time wish to
donate such a thing to GDAL but under LGPL license so that GDAL
could in future have less trouble with competing plugin licenses
(see  http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc34_license_policy).
If it happened to be tread safe, etc, well, all the better.

Howzit Terence

The c++ version of what you are trying to do is something like (you
need to have already teh myCRSID variable defined):

QgsMapRenderer* myRenderer = mMapCanvas->mapRenderer();
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem srs( myCRSID,
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::InternalCrsId );
myRenderer->setDestinationCrs( srs );\
myRenderer->setMapUnits( QGis::Meters );
myRenderer->setProjectionsEnabled( true );


I'm not a python guru but you can probably replace those :: and -> 's
with '.' and it should mostly work.

Tim

You probably need trunk / nightly builds to use this the above call
was missing from the python interface and Martin has just added it.

Hi All. 

Thanks for the help got it working... 

This seems to work, Note used setDestinationSrs not setDestinationCrs 

myrender = self.canvas.mapRenderer() 
myrender.setProjectionsEnabled(True)  
myrender.setDestinationSrs(crsDest)

Jordan, if you are willing, please come and help. Please note that we
already did substantial work on this, setting up a Django webapp
http://plugins.qgis.org/ and a shiny new bug tracker
http://hub.qgis.org/ 
We need help especially to integrate the whole suite in a way taht is

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SAGA Interface
Message-ID: <AANLkTikBTtnL1Jn7d3ymd-n9WnbLc3Cii8goJM0jLpXd@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am considering implementing this idea:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/SAGA_Toolbox_for_QGIS
I use SAGA often and would like to see a modern interface to it. I
have no experience with the QGIS code, though. The last few days I
have been coding a little, just to get a feeling of how difficult that
integration would be and get to know the QGIS code. So far the plugin
only fumbles a little with qguis' GUI and loads SAGA libraries. The
next step will be to display a list of modules and their parameters.

I'd like to do this in context of GSoC 2011, for that purpose, and if
you're still interested, I'll submit a proposal during the week.

I started using SAGAs Pyhon interface, which I am more familiar with,
but switched to C++ now. I think the whole C++ -> Python -> Swig ->
C++ route is too complicated. C++ to C++ is just cleaner. What is your
opinion?

Do you believe that it is feasible to do the whole implementation
during 1 GSoC? Else, what aspects should I focus on? (And what could
be left to post-GSoc)
GUI: Any ideas? So far I think I'll just clone SAGA's. Distribution:
Would SAGA's modules and/or the SAGA API be distributed with QGIS?

Finally, which do you think will be greatest hurdles or pitfalls I
would face in this project? Any particularities of qgis I should be
aware of? (Data formats?)

Thanks for your comments,
Camilo

Ok thats actually a bug because *Srs methods are to be deprecated in favour
of *Crs. I'll update the bindings.

Ok the Crs flavours of those methods are already in the 1.7 python API...I
guess you are still on 1.6. Just bear in mind your plugin may need tweaking
come the release of 2.0 (when deprecated methods will be dropped from the
API).

What about: https://github.com/qgis/qgis
Is that repo official/maintained? It was updated a month ago. I forked
from that, should I rather switch to Francesco's, then?

I think Tim was going to bring up moving to git officially at the next
"hackfest", or what ever it is called now, not sure where it would then be
hosted but I really like github.  I like the forking and pull requests
interface which I think would work well with coding efforts.

Please do: I think this is quite interesting. Please note that Gianluca
Massei has started some work on this, so he may be able to start
quicker.
All the best.

I think a C++ plugin has limited chances to be successful, because it
would either require a dependency of QGIS on SAGA, or the recompilation
of the plugin for each distro. Previous experiences in this direction
resulted in wonderful plugins used by very few people.
Python is the way to go IMHO.

I think you should be able to complete the interface at least. Adding
all the modules may be postponed, if it proves too long. See the
GdalTools approach for this. Also the GRASS plugin should give you
insights.

> GUI: Any ideas? So far I think I'll just clone SAGA's. 

I think it would be good if you could follow either the GdalTools or the
GRASS plugins approach.

> Distribution:
> Would SAGA's modules and/or the SAGA API be distributed with QGIS?

See above.

All the best, and thanks for your interest.

Thanks, i have bug reports enough, no need to much more. The second
one is known. I know that all those bugs were introduced with new
raster providers and I am willing to fix them. Anybody's help is
welcome however. The second one for example has to be fixed in
qgsmaptoolidentify.cpp, I believe, just to reproject the point back to
raster source CRS, like it is done for vectors.

Hello, Paolo, and thanks for your swift answer.

Has Gianluca published his code? I'd like to see his approach and
maybe work together. Mine is at github, BTW, but is completely
unusable right now. Just experiments.

I may be wrong, but wouldn't a recompilation of the saga modules and
saga API be necessary either way? Unless you install the full SAGA
package. Even then, I am not sure if saga packages for all distros
include the python bindings. These would have to be generated (SWIG)
and compiled, too.
Anyway, I was thinking more of a low level approach, dynamically
loading the libraries and taking care of data structure exchange,
which means this plugin wouldn't have the same requirements as most.

I'll try to identify the most used data structures and formats, see if
there are some I can skip for now. Also I may leave out interactive
modules, if necessary. Just to simplify things in the beginning.

I will take a look at that, considering that I have to generate the
interface on-the-fly based on module parameters and input data. I find
specially SAGA's handling of interactive modules a little confusing:
often it is not clear to the user (me, at least) what he is expected
to do next.

One of the difficulties I have faced is generated by SAGA's
documentation. I thought I knew the API more or less well, but this
new project as forced me to use parts I hadn't looked at before.

Well, thanks again for your comments.

Regards,
Camilo

I think it would be good to postpone the release of 1.7, after critical
bugs have been squashed. How about having a bug squashing party during
the HF?
All the best.

Why this HF could not be fully dedicated to bug fixing? I know that it
is boring.

I didn't mean this: I was just suggesting dedicating one day (or half of
it) to a BSP.
I also do not want to get bored.

Given that 1.7 release will be probably the last one in the 1.x series
it deserves some more polishing. As of now in Trac there are 300+ bugs
and ~300 requests for enhancements. With some effort we could maybe
close up to 100 bug reports during the hackfest.

That would however require us to shift the release and move the string
freeze to a time after the hackfest (otherwise the string freeze might
be a limiting factor in closing various tickets).

Hi Camilo.
I agree with your approach. I already expressed it in past emails on this
topic.
Even if working at low levels requires some more overhead (cross platform
builds and support), it would bring a higher level of usability.
A first step could be the design of data structures wrappers/bindings
between  ones.
I think that true integration between QGIS and SAGA internal native data
structures.
Here [1] we started a discussion page. I couldn't go on with this project
because the company decided to not invest on it now, but I'm still
interested on it.

Hi

I would like to propose we hold another 'townhall meeting' at the
hackfest where we can discuss any broad ranging issues pertinent to
anyone involved in the project. If you have other agenda items (or
don't like the starting list I added), please update the wiki page
accordingly. I added a 'Town hall meeting' [1] section to the Lisbon
meeting page and added 'moving to GIT' as an agenda item. I also
started this page [2] , where I encourage other proponents of moving
to git to add their thoughts (and those who don't like the idea to add
theirs).

Personally I think it would be good to dedicate some or all of the
hackfest to polishing too. If we can get Juergen to tell enough funny
jokes I don't think it will be too boring :-)

I would also propose to allow gui changes during the HF so that we can
polish up the raster dialog and various other parts of the UI that
need attention.

+1 for post Lisbon release.

I know that you didn't, that's why I suggested that. Once it wasn't irony.

Hi Tim

What is your new release schedule considering a possible bugfix session in 
Lisabon? New string freeze just after the hf?

hi camilo, I'm working to make a qgis-saga interface me too,  but with a 
"python approach". I haven't published my code because it's very 
experimental and really not usable. Anyway, at moment I can access from 
QGIS to saga via a simple menu. After the call, each  module print to 
stdout the "help" output (like "saga_cmd library_name module name -h"). 
I'm working to build GUI "on the flay" with pyQT but progress is really 
slow.
If you think to use python  I'm happy to work togheter  and I'll put my 
rough code on GitHub. Otherwise,  don't know C++ enough to really 
contribute at the develop of plugin.

Hi Gianluca,
I can't say how much I could dedicate to that, but if you could put it on
GitHub I could find some time to contribute.
I don't think I can invest time on the low level development, but with
Python I think I could give some time.

Thanks for your comment. For those reasons and the ones I mentioned in
the original mail, I think I'll be going the C++ route. The single
argument that seems to favour Python is the greater availability of
coders. Giovanni and Gianluca have responded to this mail saying they
would work on a Python version. No other C++ coders interested, yet :(

So, I have roughly divided the work to be done in a list of smaller
tasks. These I have sorted in a way that would allow me, I hope, to
reach one goal by end of the first GSoC term and other by end of the
second term. This list is at the end of this message and would apply
with minor modifications to a Python module, too.
The intention here is to come up with a timeline and to identify what
the hardest parts of the process are going to be, possible pitfalls,
etc.
Please let me know if you have identified tasks I haven't considered.
I think this is a good exercise, even out of the GSoC context.

When its better formulated and if there are no objections I'll add it to

So far I havent changed the schedule - we should probably take a vote
on whether we would like to extend the release time frame or press
ahead with the current schedule. I think this discussion may be buried
in this thread and people may bave missed it. I will post a new
message in its own thread with a proposed updated timeline and
proposing that we spend some / all of the hackfest tidying up 1.7.

	schedule
Message-ID: <AANLkTikSjVjUAxrChMPPL6fZiru1BwHqUMHhLttj_dfn@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

There has been some discussion on this list about extending the
release schedule for 1.7. The proposals are:


1) Continue with release schedule as is (aiming for mid-april release
announcement with branching on 7 April)

2) Extend the release schedule and lift the string freeze until after
the hackfest. We would then spend **a day** of the hackfest tidying up
QGIS 1.7 and then branch at the end of that day and finalise
translation in that branch while we continue to hack new features into
trunk for the rest of the hackfest. Planned tag for release would be a
week after the hackfest.

3) Extend the release schedule and lift the string freeze until after
the hackfest. We would then spend **all** of the hackfest tidying up
QGIS 1.7 and then impose a string freeze straight after the hackfest
with a planned branch for release a week later.



Please cast your vote and have your say.

My vote: option 3

Regards

Tim

Although I'll be not at the Hackfest and would have to communicate the 
postpone to the translators ..
I vote also for 3 ..
Like to see all relevant issues cleaned out..

Hi Tim

3 for me too (assuming there is still space to discuss future development 
directions at the hackfest).

+1  for suggestion 3.

I'm just a translator, so I wont be able to help during the hackfest, but I
feel it's in everyone's best interest to clean 1.7 as much as possible.

Sorry to insist, but I think this is not a good choice. We already had
experiance with several non-core C++ plugins, some of them extremely
useful, and all of them are essentially unavailable to users. On the other
hand, it is probably unfeasible to add a dependency on SAGA.

This should mean something, even though it is not the crucial issue.
All the best.

I understand your point Paolo, and I can't contribute to C++ coding now, so
I can't support it practically.
But:

 - if Camilo can do it, he's welcome. I suppose he's conscious of what it
means, also from a lon term support point of view... With GRASS module we
have the same issues, am I wrong?

 - without a low-level interactions between QGis and SAGA, what is the real
usefulness of this plugin? SAGA needs to be installed anyway (and it's
easy), we already can import/export between the two's... Ok all the effort
would be directed to avoid opening the SAGA interface. Mmm, I don't see such
a great gain to justify the effort.

Just two cents to share opinions. I'm just wondering....

For me, QGIS sets CRS to raster's CRS but some info seems to be lost
in createFromWkt().

GRASS gives: GEOGCS["wgs84",DATUM["WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137,298.257223563],TOWGS84[0.000,0.000,0.000]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]]

QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.createFromWkt().toWkt() gives:
GEOGCS["WGS 84",DATUM["unknown",SPHEROID["WGS84",6378137,298.257223563],TOWGS84[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]]

QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.authid(): EPSG:4148
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.description(): Hartebeesthoek94

Everything for CRS QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem created from WKT given
by GRASS above.

Here I am only QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem user, can anybody knowing
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem explain what is happening and what is
wrong? I have added more debug output, you can grep everything
importing with grep -i crs.

Region should be reprojected of course, but that has nothing to do
with rasters, please fill a ticket for GRASS plugin.

That shouldn't be a problem projectionwise.

It found EPSG:4148 because that has the same projection parameters as EPSG:4326
and the WKT string doesn't have any information about which EPSG is desired.
Otherwise the description and authid would change, still that wouldn't change
the projection.

Or am I missing something else that is lost?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS webclient into svn
Message-ID: <201103311153.52672.marco.hugentobler@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs

An extremely useful thing when using QGIS server in a real project is to have 
a standard web client at hand that provides a set of standard tools and 
supports the extensions of QGIS server out of the box (e.g. web based printing 
).

Andreas Neumann wrote a very nice client with java script based on the GeoExt 
framework (http://gis.uster.ch/).  He would be available to put it into the 
QGIS svn and to maintain it.

For me that would be a great and very useful addition.
What do you think about it? 

It could be placed at https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgis_webclient. Like 
that, the desktop user would not have any overhead for svn checkout. 

Regards,
Marco

OK. Giovanni, can you verify if the problem is still present? Check
also layer's metadata and debug output as missing EPSG can lead to
confusion described above.

I saw this client some time ago and I wanted to ask similar question. I
think, it will be very valuable addition to QGIS Mapserver (even more if
it would be maintained). Please add it :).

What I don't understand is: we'd have the same problems using python.
There are, as far as I know, no Python-saga packages.
Debian's libsaga[2], for instance, does *not* include python bindings.
That means we'd have to compile & ship the python-saga binding
ourselves, anyway. Or am I missing something?

Are you, Gianluca, using the command-line interface to saga or the
python bindings? That former is very interesting as a compile-free
option, but ultimately is limited to certain tasks and to having
saga_cmd installed. Both options (command line and API) are not
exclusive.

Regards,
Camilo

You're right Camilo,
python-saga bindings are available in source, as ready-to-use batch commands
(saga_api_to_python_linux.sh and saga_api_to_python_win.bat):
http://saga-gis.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/saga-gis/trunk/saga-gis/src/saga_core/saga_api/)
to compile them through SWIG
It means we have to provide them along the QGis-SAGA plugin by ourselves

+1 From me. As we have discussed offlist, a future development could
be to autogenerate a client project configuration for each QGIS
Mapserver project you publish.

Hi,
My preference: option 3 + Marco's suggestion

Still, there are more people "voting" than people going to the hackfest!
There were at least 2 messages saying that debugging is not fun (and,
no, it is not fun!). And Marco is right about discussing future
development directions. For me those taking the time to go to Lisbon
should do what they prefer to do, not what the majority of developers
prefer.
My preference is still option 3 (+ Marco's suggestion), but whatever the
decision of participants would be, thanks in advance for the good work
and have fun!

+1; a great addition. One question: does the printing widget takes the
layout from the project print composer?

Hi Paolo,

Yes - the printing widget takes the layout from the print composer 
layouts in the .qgs project files.

It is a QGIS proprietary extension to the WMS standard - a GetPrint 
command where you can specify the layout, scale, map extent, rotation 
and grid interval for the graticule.

QGIS exposes print composer information in the GetCapabilities response.

The widget itself is taken from the GeoExt project.

This is addressed in trunk, although it requires the font and color dialogs to use qt widgets rather than native dialogs. I believe this is a qt bug, ultimately.

It's currently a part of:

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3497

I've only partially fixed this (a workaround).  There are many color pickers and I didn't want to either workaround them as problems are found, which would create a mix of color pickers, or do all of them, which would be a chore to find, and to revert when it's fixed in Qt or QGIS.

For the color pickers at least, it looks like it is possible for the native picker to work, I just don't know enough to figure out why.  I'm hoping a Mac programmer can figure this out.  But if it comes down to it for release, I'll do the workaround.
