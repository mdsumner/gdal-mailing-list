I think the debian/ tree in the QGIS repository is ready for this.  The
jaunty packages in my ppa[1] are built from it.

It's certainly possible.  I messed around with a Qgis Xcode project  
once upon a time.  There are 2 approaches:

- quick-n-dirty: run the configure/cmake + make + make install from  
Xcode.  This doesn't realy gain much over doing the same from a  
Terminal, but you can run post-processing and bundling scripts in it,  
and it helps to standardize some configuration options that will not  
change for OSX.  Very easy to maintain, since all configuration and  
compilation is external.

- the-right-way: completely redo configuration and compilation to  
Xcode methods.  This is what I tried for Qgis.  It requires keeping  
the Xcode project in sync with the cmake method - which source files  
to compile, names of targets, ...  Xcode doesn't have a wildcard  
source specifier - all sources must be explicitly listed in the  
project (Qgis may already do that in cmake?).  There is no way to use  
a list of files from a text file (such as the cmakelists file), except  
to create an amalgamation source to be compiled.  And a non-Mac  
developer couldn't edit the Xcode project file to add or delete  
sources, it's a big XML mess.  This is what made me drop the Xcode  
method.

Dependency configuration is tricky.  I came up with a pretty flexible  
method to specify dependencies, including handling variations of  
framework vs library and static vs dynamic libs, but it still requires  
some manual editing of a configuration file.

The Qt stuff could be messy.  Custom rules could be made to do the Qt  
processing (might be some info in the Qt docs).  Or simply use inline  
scripts (quick-n-dirty but messy).

But it's much easier to do the packaging (automatic), and could take  
care of some of the problematic bits (like bug #768) more reliably.   
Bundling of external stuff like the Qt frameworks would also be quite  
simple.

For developers, the debugger GUI might be of interest.

Other interesting possibilities are 'frameworkizing' the Qgis  
libraries, and otherwise organizing the application package in a more  
Mac way (though some of this would require source changes to account  
for the paths).

If there is interest, and someone willing to maintain it (requires  
keeping track of new/deleted source files), I could work on an Xcode  
project.  (I might be persuaded to maintain it)  Now that the dust has  
settled with 1.0, it may be easier to keep an Xcode project maintained.

One problem would be Xcode versions.  Each OSX system version has its  
own Xcode version.  Early versions are importable into later versions,  
but I don't know if there is an export feature to go back.  I'd be  
doing this in Xcode 3 on Leopard, and at a minimum we should support  
Xcode 2.5 on Tiger.  Though, with their backward compatibility plan  
when they released Xcode 2.5 (it will run on Leopard), it's possible  
v2.5 can open v3 projects.

Did you try ccmake -G XCode (from memory) ccmake --help to verify exact 
keyword)? It generates an xcode project but I never had much joy with what it 
produced....

Possibly a way to start, to get all the sources and targets setup,  
then clean it up and tweak it.  But I'm talking about maintenance  
really - I wouldn't want to do that every time there is a new or  
deleted source.

I believe it's really important to have fTools working properly in QGIS 1.0.0, 
so I would prefer to implement such stuff in fTools rather than wait for future 
qgis releases... Even if it isn't optimal... :)

Jurgen, that is great news.

Do you know what steps are required to get QGIS into Ubuntu now? (I'm 
not sure)
Are you already working on this?
Do you need help? (There are a couple of people on the Ubuntu and FOSS4G 
lists that have mentioned an interest in Ubuntu and the LiveDVD who may 
be interested).

the plugin package contained a wrong named directory.
Please search the list of installed plugins. I'm nearly sure you'll find
the plugin there, but I just can't determine which of them it is. It

Ops, I didn't test the package. It's now fixed, so please reinstall once again 
and remove the ~/Pulpit/borysowe directory manually. I'm sorry!

Hi all,


I have a problem with WFS on windows XP.  When I load a layer with only one
multypolygon  it is painted in different colors.

someone knows what could be the problem?. It only happend in windows, on
Linux not.

I work with qgis 1.0-previo2, and qt v.4.3.0.

Hi Florian,

I saw QGIS printing in formats >A4 on an A0 plotter.

I suppose that your problem with A3 is not related to QGIS but rather to your 
printer setup and the Qt printing system. Maybe it also helps to look at the 
printing dialog carefully as there are usually several places to set the paper 
format.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <18144.193.246.86.39.1233563655.squirrel@webmail.customers.iirc.at>

Hello Borys and other QGIS developers,

I have a suggestion for the python plugin installer and the plugins.xml file:

Wouldn't it be useful to have a "release_notes" tag, next to the
"description" tag, indicating what changed from the last release(s)? It
would be useful to see if a problem I had might have been fixed with this
release of the python plugin, or what new feature is now available.

The python plugin installer could expose the release notes in a separate
dialogue, if the "release_notes" tag is present.

The question is if such a tag should be just unstructured text or if there
should be further child nodes for each release.

What do you think?

Andreas

Hi Alex,

An ossimPlanet Plugin would be really great!

about your progresses.

All the best,

No.  If there is a debian/ubuntu maintainer willing to pick this up,
he/she is free to do so.  If there are any problems with the debian/
tree, he/she is also free to file tickets in the QGIS TRAC.

I see the debian/ tree in our repository primarily as a means to produce
packages for launchpad for our users and for my local use - and I'm
going to keep it up-to-date for that purpose.

I will support any efforts to get this into Debian/Ubuntu again, but I
don't plan on doing it myself (ie. jumping through NM hoops).

Well none of the solutions we've come up with so far can really be

Hi Ana,

Try it with qgis-1.0 release on windows. If it still does not work: is it 
possible to access the WFS for testing or is it behind a firewall?

At least from my side, it's still untouched. Nobody else was confessing to work 
on it so feel free to go on, it's really an essential tool!

It would be great! Maybe not the most elegant solution, but I believe it still 
will be quite fast :)

I second Borys' comment... I haven't heard much of anything on the list, 
and a front-end to ogr/gdal would be fantastic. gdal has lots of tools 
and functions for raster data that many would find useful!

Good luck, and please feel free to send questions to the list, there are 
lot's of python folk available to help you!

Cheers,

Carson

A separate dialogue is good solution for now. In the future I can put a text 
(html?) browser to the main Installer window. It would display plugin details: a 
longer description, clickable links, the changelog, screenshots etc.

I believe that it's essential to keep metadata as simple as possible. A chain of 
separate nodes for each release causes a need of storing obsolete metadata. It's 
of course feasible, but complicates the repository structure.

Much simpler is only one node designed for a longer description (say one or more 
paragraphs) + whole changelog. It would accept html formatting. Author just has 
to extend the changelog. It's also easier to correct old entries. Of course it's 
also less automagic...

I am printing in A3 from multiple different programs - The point is
that i get the correct paper from the printer (Its an A3 sheet) but the
output is of size A4 in the middle of the A3 page. And its only part of
the print preview.

I'm interested to at least give it a try and see if it is something  
worth maintaining. If it simplifies bundling and debugging it would be  
worth it to me for my efforts.

Second try...
I created an Xcode project like this, using latest cmake (I believe)  
with Qt 4.3.3 and Xcode 3.2. Xcode says it can't load the project file.

it is not a plugin for qgis, but a standalone project.

This project is actually specifically focused on ogr2ogr, so I still 
think you're Ok here Florian. The tools in gdal and some of the other 
ogr functions would still be a valuable contribution I think.

Isn't the OGR part covered by the ogr converter plugin already?  It's
said to be inspired by ogr2gui.

Yes, I guess ogr *is* covered, you're right... I was thinking there were 
other ogr tools? In any case, that still leaves quite a bit to do with 
the gdal functions...

Hi Florian,

strange - I don't seem to have these printing problems. I print on
linux/windows on various paper sizes.

What Windows version are you using? I tested on Win2000 and WinXP. I never
had your problems and it seems like Marco cannot reproduce either. I
assume he is on XP.

Are you sure you set the page format correctly everywhere? Note that under
Windows you have to set it at various/multiple places:

* in qgis (print composer, "General" Tab --> paper size)
* in the printing dialogue of Windows/QT
* in the preferences of your printer (if the two dialogues don't
synchronize themselves)

Usually those dialogues know nothing about each other, thus you have to
set it multiple times.

The other question is: can other people reproduce the strange behavior
that happens on Florians PC?

Not sure if I'm "that user" but, in any case, I think
that a menu driven interface for plugin utilities in QGIS

I can dust off my old Xcode project, and it shouldn't be too hard to  
update it to try it out with the 1.0 source and Xcode 3.  I have a  
Tiger Mac also with Xcode 2.5, so I can test project backward- 
compatibility.

Message-ID: <eb2cc3420902030923k700fb299h3e8d32a1c8edbfe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi the list.

I have been browsing the API searching for a way to add some custom metadata
to a QgsVectorLayer. It seems there is no way to do that.

Here is why I wanted to do that. Give me your opinion about this because I
am not sure I have a clear view of what QGis can already do about that:

Being able to add some layer specific metadata would allow the developement
of plugins that would be able to recognize the layers on which to act in
function of this metadata information. This would allow the plugins to be
designed for a generic type of layers that the user would "declare" by
setting the right metadata. Of course, the plugins can already check for
QgsMapLayer type, then for the appropriate geometry and QgsFields, but
having metada would also allow the user to specify he wants this layer to be
taken into account automatically for some handling (because the previous
elements can happen to match while the layer has nothing to do with the
custom feature you are interested in... bad luck happens...)

Typical example: I want to develop a plugin to implement S52 representation
of S57 maps. To do that, I must identify the layer type (as in S57 layer
type). Of course I get the layer type when opening the datasource from OGR
(the ogrsublayersdialog now displays this name). But once this has been
done, unless I get down to the QgsOgrProvider object, I have no way to
retrieve this information simply. Moreover, I can imagine designing my own
layers that I would like to render as S57 layers of such or such type and
therefore requiring some additionnal data that OGR wouldn't give me in that
case...

Is there anyway at this time to do this? Anyone confronted to this kind of
objective?

I hope that I made myself clear enough and that someone understands my idea
and my question.
Thanks for your comments.

Florian

 You can do this, depending on how much control you have of the layer
loading process...

 Python lets you add attributes to just about any object. So if you
create a new menu option 'Load My Special Layer' which lets the user
choose a shapefile or other data source, you can create a
QgsVectorLayer and then set something on it. Load a vector layer and
then try this in the python console: l = iface.mapCanvas().layer(0)
followed by l.fnord = "hello world". The .fnord attribute is now set,
and other python code can check for presence of this. Any decent
object-oriented programmer would throw up at this point at the way
you've violated their object...

 So you can subclass QgsVectorLayer to keep them happy. You do (something like):

class SpecialLayer(QgsVectorLayer):
   def __init__(self,file):
      QgsVectorLayer.__init__(self,file)
   def setFnord(self,value):
       self.fnord=value

 BUT (and it's a big but) none of this gets saved in project files.
You could write a writeXML method on your layer which could save the
metadata, but when it is read back Qgis will just create a plain
QgsVectorLayer and throw away your extra information.

 It would be nice to have a userMetadata object saved and restored
with layers which would be some key-value structure accessible to
Python and C++. At the moment such a thing doesn't exist.

 A possibility is to save it in the project settings (see QgsProject)
which is separate from the layers. I'm thinking about this for the
thing I'm working on.

Hi Barry.

Thanks for your quick answer and your ideas.

Your solution was already in my mind. Thanks for confirming my idea.

Your last point is particularly interesting because as you said, it would be
nice that the metadata are saved with the layer. I think that a "simple
modification" (meaning not a profound rewriting of the current API) could
allow this feature to be added either to QgsMapLayer or to QgsVectorLayer or
even in the QgsVectorDataProvider class... Bu I know the API is currently
"frozen" to allow for stability.

I've tried to see if OGR already provides some way to handle metadata but
this doesn't seem to be the case (It could have been a partial solution...)

Ticket https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1399 was opened 3 months ago about
this particular question. I would like to know if anybody from the core
developers can give me directions about this particular problem. Although I
am not sure I can develop this, I would need some wider point of view so as
to start looking in the right direction...

Thanks a lot.
Florian

Subject: [Qgis-developer] XML Metadata editor Plugin - FYI
Message-ID: <4988BD01.3040403@wildintellect.com>

Just wanted to let the devs know, for a class project my group is
developing a new plugin to edit xml metadata files commonly included
with shapefiles according to ISO 19115:2003 and FGDC(past and upcoming)
standards.

For those who don't know these files contain the who, what, where and
why of a dataset and is extremely useful for publishing and cataloging
datasets online.

It's currently in the planning stages and in about 5 weeks when the term
is up, however far we've gotten we'll welcome additional developers.
Suggestions are welcome at any time.


We made a sourceforge project to handle svn/documentation.
http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/qgismetaedit/

This raises the question of whether there should be a qgis plugin
collective for unofficial plugins and new ideas?

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 2 new plugins... very alpha
Message-ID: <12aa01c9864c$a292dca0$e7b895e0$@com>

Hey folks,

 

I got an itch the last couple of days to play with some plugin ideas that I
have been thinking about.  Neither is complete, but more of a proof of
concept.  I would love some folks to try them out and let me know if they
work for you and if you have any initial thoughts on future direction for
them.

 

1) RefMap - This is a plugin that is utilizing WebKit within QT (version
4.4+) to display web maps from (currently) google, OSM, (and potentially in
the future) MS Virtual Earth, Yahoo, etc.  The interesting thing is that I
have tied events from the webkit browser (JS actions) to PyQt methods, and
PyQt methods into injected JS.  Basically you can do things like pan a web
map and have the qgis canvas track, and pan the qgis canvas and have the web
map track.  

 

The gui contains a "configuration" button and corresponding dialog, but
nothing is really hooked up there yet.  Projections are expected to be in
epsg 4326 (WGS84 Lat Lon) for the data layers in qgis. there is no
on-the-fly reprojection yet.  While the web map and qgis canvas will track
each other, the zoom levels are not tracking yet. so you have to manually
zoom each of the maps.  Again this is just a prototype.  You will need qgis
1.0+ built with QT/PyQt 4.4+ for things to work.

 

2) MirrorMap - This is a plugin to split the map canvas area into two
distinct map canvas's. the original map canvas on the left and a new map
canvas on the right.  When you launch this tool you will see a small pop-up
dialog with buttons to load a vector or raster layer, remove the mirror
canvas, or close the dialog.  This dialog is tied to the right hand canvas.
Layers added to that canvas intentionally do not show up in the main legend
and the user currently has no way to change preferences of the layer in the
right panel.

Like the RefMap plugin, there are no reprojection going on, so layers in the
left and right panel need to be in the same projection.  The left panel (the
main canvas) can pan and zoom like normal and the right panel canvas will
track.  

 

One note is that I am still playing with getting the resizing of the panels
to behave, so there is a side effect that once you click the plugin button
to get the dialog, the main window area where the canvas is gets a
"minimumsize" set to the current size.  From that point on (even after going
back to one canvas) the window will not resize smaller until qgis is started
again.  Annoying, but not a show stopper and I will try to fix that asap.

 

So, I would love to get some feedback on how these work, if they show
promise, or make you think "ah, it would be great if we could do xxxx with
this plugin".  

 

My repo is at:

 

http://qgisplugins.z-pulley.com/

 

Thanks for testing!

 

Aaron

Any info would be welcome.

Hi all.
Massimo Di Stefano has done some work on this, but apparently a major
problem is compilation od ossim on anything different from OSX. I think
you could contact him.
Another option would be to join efforts with GRASS devs, and use some of
their code/approach for the new wxpy nviz.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CC197224AC75CE4DB23F739B16891B86E34122@tikka.haapa.mmm.fi>

Hi,
This message has been lying for some days in QGis forum and now I was adviced to send it to mailing list.
-Jukka Rahkonen-
 
Forum message follows:
"The Georeferencer plugin is pretty nice to use. However, I have found that the result of georeferencing with world file is not always satisfactory. Therefore I have used the fine user interface for collecting ground control points and done the rest of georecerencing with other tools. However, I believe that it should be rather easy to modify the Georeferencer plugin so that it could do georeferncing also with this alternative way. As a result QGis would have a georeferencing tool of professional quality both when it comes to easy of use and accuracy.
The work flow would be like this:
1. Ground control points are collected with the existing plugin. It is gathering all the information that is needed for the next step (mapX, mapY, pixelX, pixelY)
2. Ground control points are fed for gdal_translate program as -gcp parameters. Gdal_translate takes them in this order:
[-gcp pixel line easting northing [elevation]]*
The whole gdal_translate command line would be
gdal_translate -of GTiff -gcp [params_1] -gcp [params_2] -gcp [params_3] .... input.tif temporary.tif
3. Third step is to warp the temparary image that contains now the ground control points. It is done with gdalwarp, for example like this:
gdalwarp -of GTiff -s_srs epsg:4326 -t_srs epsg:4326 temporaty.tif warped.tif
Command lines are presented as working examples which can be repeated with gdal utility programs. For the plugin it would be better to call gdal funtions directly, use virtual raster format as temporary format instead of tiff etc. I cannot say very much about how it should be done because I can't program myself. However, in the very end of this link http://www.scangis.org/scangis2007/papers/r3_rahkonen.pdf there is python code that might be useful and that can be used freely. That script is doing basically the same thing, it takes ground control points from external source and warps image automatically with gdal components."

Hi Paolo

Proxy support should work for 1.1. At least I have positive feedback from the 
proxy user that tested.
It is even possible to give strings of urls that don't go through the proxy. 
Every request starting with such an url string is then excluded from proxy 
settings. This feature already works for WMS and WFS and plugin installer will 
follow soon.
Postgis request have no proxy support yet.

Marco

Good news. BTW, what about releasing 1.0.1? I think several bugs have
already been fixed. Can the diagram branch be considered stable?

Nearly. I still need to implement loading/saving of the diagrams from project 
files. The second problem is that the PAL library for placement needs geos3. 
Either we set the minimum requirement for geos to 3 or we try to insert some 
macros similar to what has been done in QgsGeometry (but that is a bit ugly).

Marco

I think geos3 is a reasonable requirement nowadays. Probably other
features and some plugins don't work with older geos anyway, so I think
it is safer to require vers. 3.
But does this have to do with diagrams, or with labels only?
I think the addition of diagrams warrants a 1.1 version number, so
labels should go in 1.2.
All the best.

Alex:
 
I think metadata is very important and I was wondering
if it is possible to integrate this functionality into qgis app
directly. This way metadata info could be seen in metadata tab
of layer properties dialog. For file based layers metadata could
be an xml named as layer and some information could be updated
automatically, for example when was last modified.
 
What qgis developers think about this?

Dear Jukka,

this functionality is already implemented in new Georeferencer plugin.
You can grab a copy for Ubuntu from svn mentioned here [1] or wait for new 1.0.1 (?) release
of QGIS, where it will be part of standard distribution.

http://gis-lab.info/qa/qgis-georef-new-eng.html

Meanwhile, we'll be glad to hear from you regarding any problems with
this plugin.

Hi,

Great, that was fast!  I have a few scanned historical maps which I have not yet warped with the manual way so I will for sure test the plugin immediately when I can get it for Windows.

Jukka,

Please try downloading dll for windows from the same page, I've
updated it. Please note, it might be unstable, so use at your own
risk. No viruses, I promise ;)

To other QGIS developers,
We'd greatly appreciate if someone can try to help us build a new
C++ based georeferencer-gdal for Windows for testing. I should admit we suck with
building our plugins for Win lately, nothing works as needed :(

This is a shortcoming that I have run into headlong this week as I am  
trying to provide some data to an organization that has strict  
metadata compliance requirements. My solution has been to hand edit  
xml files, but this is not at all ideal.

I strongly agree that this is an important tool that will improve qgis  
considerably. In fact, the ability to edit metadata would provide qgis  
with capabilities that are rare or absent in the majority of the GIS  
software that is currently available. Such a tool would automatically  
fill some fields, like geographic extents and projection information,  
dates for creation and modification, and perhaps contact and  
organization information through a set of defaults that can be  
assigned as application-level defaults that will persist across  
projects. Additionally, the ability to choose various standards would  
be nice; also, being able to load an existing xml file and having it  
serve as a template could be useful.

I look forward to seeing your success on this project.

Regards,
John

As several others have mentioned, this is an extremely useful 
contribution, and I look forward to seeing what your group comes up 
with. I can't stress the importance of meta-data enough, so a tool to 
properly manage it is extremely helpful. Also, the fact that you are 
going to keep the format ISO compliant is great, nothing worse than a 
bunch of meta-data that no-one can access/use ;-)

Good luck,

Carson

Just an idea, 0.01 PLN worth - it would be great to use this approach in
the georeferencer plugin. This would allow for better workspace
utilization and more convenient user interface.

This sounds like a good classification - perhaps Frank or others have more 
thoughts on this,

My personal feeling is that if we can open every supported format that the 
particular OGR/GDAL on the users machine was compiled with it would be first 
prize.

In the few minutes I had to look at your list you classification seemed right 
to me. Does this imply we will need to create a programmatic master list for 
QGIS to read and associate with GDAL formats? Perhaps indicating wich category 
the format fits into would be something Frank would consider adding to the next 
iteration of GDAL/OGR so that we always have a current classification list 
regardless of which >= current  version of gdal the user has.

I'm really looking forward to your patch!

I would very much welcome a 1.01 release including Marcos Proxy fix - so
we can offer our Windows user WMS and plugin access. We are behind a proxy
and QGIS 1.0 is of limited use without proper internet connection.

Also, we still have printing problem, esp. on Windows. On Linux it works
better, but it seems that qt has bigger printing problems on Windows than
on Linux ...

Hi

A metadata plugin would be great - builing it directly into QGIS would
be even better! This is the kind of cross cutting functionality that
everybody wants and needs, and that would be great to be able to
access via the QGIS core API.  With it added to the api other plugin
writers coulld make good use of the metadata too. Of course that would
prbably mean doing your work in C++ - not sure if you are up for that.

Metadata standards often vary among agencies, so ease of customization
is a necessity. I think a python plugin is more flexible and more
appropriate in this context.
All the best.

Message-ID: <68a7e9ea0902050447q5730ecd7ha92273a6597acf4e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to the QGIS API and have explored it very briefly. I am trying to
write a c++ plugin that will take in the locations of approximately
*100 vessels
and render their current position* (which varies with time)on top of an
underlying map. I used polygons to represent those vessels on a vector layer
using the memory provider. Each update involves deleting old features and
adding new ones followed by refreshing of mapcanvas triggered when changes
are committed. As there is a need to render updates at a high frequency for
real time display, with *positional data coming in at about 1-2Hz*, the
application was *too occupied refreshing the canvas*. This makes the
application unresponsive to subsequent user commands. I tried
using update(Rect of changedExtent) for localized painting/canvas refreshing
but the rendering is still too taxing. Can you provide some advice on how i
can go about rendering this huge amount of data in real time?

I also tried using rubberbands and they work much better but i need to
display text attributes beside each vessel which i do not know how to
achieve without labels. Any alternative to rendering text at specific map
location that i can update in real time?

Your help is very much appreciated. Thank you.

Yesterday marked thee end of voting. Given that RFC got 4 accepting

Not reproducable here.  ui_qgsprojectionselectorbase.h should be
generated by moc during build in your build directory.  Are you building
inplace?

At the beginning of the compilation process I do get some messages like
this:
...

Is there a correlation with my error message?

Message-ID: <498B0B31.5060408@nuim.ie>

Hi list,

I am wondering what the policy is on naming conventions in terms of 
tools, the QGIS interface, and map items. For example:
I suggest that the text 'Legend' above the layer list should be changed 
to 'Layers'. Technically this isn't a legend: "A map legend can be 
defined as the reference area on a map that lists and explains the 
colours, symbols, line patterns, shadings, and annotation used on the 
map." The legend of course, it what we add to the map in the map 
composer, but what we are currently calling the legend is, in actual 
fact, simply a list of layers .

I know this is really just a matter of semantics, but it has been 
mentioned before, and I think it's important to get these things right ;-)

 Last time we had this discussion Tim suggested we open a Trac item. I
just had a few general enhancement ideas which didn't seem suited to
trac items at the time, including rearranging menus and getting rid of
other bits of UI clutter.

 Howabout we have a qgis-enhancements-discussion wiki page or forum
post that can feed items into Trac once they get enough +1s.?

Custom map canvas items are perfectly suited for this type of task.
They don't require map to be re-rendered when the item gets updated.
You can subclass your own class directly from QgsMapCanvasItem or you
can create specialized class from QgsRubberBand that will additionally
draw text labels.

You can also take a look on some brief documentation for map canvas:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/MapCanvas_API

No, that's normal.  That seems to be just a harmless warning related.

I dont agree - the api can return a standard document which can be transformed 
using xslt by plugins that need a different representation. Having the metadata 
in the core means we can show it as part of standard vector and raster 
properties tabs.

Of course all this is moot if the authors are only interested in a python 
implementation.

Tim

Hi Guys

As GUI lead I would suggest that these changes (legend -> Layers, Capture -> 
Create) are trivial enough that we should just go ahead and change in them in 
trunk. I prefer to leave them as is in stable branch since changing them has 
cross cutting effects on docs, screenies and translations).

Regards

Tim

Yes, it is neccesary to create the list. Actually the ogr provider constructs
file filters according to drivers compiled in ogr. I can reuse this method and 
construct a list with type of driver, driver identifier , and driver name. This way 
when new drivers are added to ogr only the list in ogrprovider have to be updated and
no changes will be needed in the dialogs.
 
Is there any other way to access provider in execution time other than providerregistry methods?
this question is because I want to delegate the connection string creation to ogrprovider
but I don't want to add other method to qgsproviderregistry.

Unfortunately our team doesn't have the skill or time to learn C++, but
I think the concept could be reworked at some point. We are really
laying the groundwork for how the plugin will work and implementing as
much of that as we can.

As for standards, we have an idea for a window that you can load 2 xml
schema's into and then do a 1 by 1 mapping of tags in order to setup a
translation between them. This will allow for people to use whatever
standard they want in the end.

Hi Martin and others working on the symbology work,

I am wondering if you are also considering to support SVG based vector 
patterns in the future? The current pattern set is too limiting and 
raster-based textures aren't good/nice enough. It would be great if one 
could specify vector patterns for area fills in SVG format.

Thanks for your info if you are considering this,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,

this feature has not been planned, but once the basic implementation
is done, adding svg fill patterns will be very simple (a matter of
implementing new symbol layer and its GUI - few hours at most).

Hi,

I downloaded georeferencer-win.dll and dropped it into my QGis plugins directory but plugin manager do not list it.  Perhaps plugin needs something higher than 1.0.0 from OSGeo4W installer?

Jukka,

Please try downloading dll for windows from the same page, I've
updated it. Please note, it might be unstable, so use at your own
risk. No viruses, I promise ;)

To other QGIS developers,
We'd greatly appreciate if someone can try to help us build a new
C++ based georeferencer-gdal for Windows for testing. I should admit we suck with
building our plugins for Win lately, nothing works as needed :(

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0902051451h7bf84b2i7fa4724e1c226009@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce on the behalf of our qgis-mapper team a new
attribute table implementation for Quantum GIS. For those impatient,
the source is available here:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/beata-snapshot-090502.tar.gz

To install it, copy it to your svn trunk (1.0.0 source should be fine
too) into src/plugins/ directory. Then just edit
src/plugins/CMakeLists.txt, add there directory "beata" and that's it
- just compile and run!

The new implementation (called beata - short for better attribute
table) features:
- using Qt model/view design
- faster startup - the model fetches only features in the window
- fallback model that caches everything in memory (for layer that
don't support random access)
- cursor in table independent from currently selected row
- better usage of available space

We'll be happy to hear some feedback from you!
I hope there will be enough interest to put the plugin into SVN, and
in case that everyone's confident with new implementation, it could
replace the current implementation.

Regards
Martin

Excellent work guys, the speed-up alone is fantastic!

The only thing I would suggest is that you add a minimise button to the 
dialog (the older version has this). It is often quite handy to 
temporarily minimise the attribute table when performing some quick task 
such as panning or zooming... also, will there be keyboard shortcuts for 
the actions? Having to click the actions menu to bring selected features 
to the top or zoom to selected features is an extra step I'd like to 
avoid...

In any case, nice work. This is a major improvement and I hope it makes 
it into svn soon!

Bug https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1527 details the problem. It  
appears when you save a project, all layers get a geometry type of  
Point. While the saved qgs file can be loaded back in to qgis with no

Point layers.

Ok - sounds good. Having it as a plugin is better than having nothing!

The old version of my "threading" plugin strikes again.  Talked with Gary on
IRC and removing the plugin resolved the issue and ftools installed fine.
There was a naming conflict with the pre-QGIS1.0 version of the plugin that
causes this issue when installed.  If you have that old "threading" plugin
installed on your system I suggest you remove it.  The new plugin is called
threading_demo to avoid this conflict moving forward.  Thankfully not many
people played with that one ages ago...

I made some tests and I believe that the error is caused by the combination of PyQt-4.3 and Qt-4.4. When I compile QGIS-1.1 r10110 against PyQt-4.3 and Qt-4.3 the compilation process wirks fine.

Do you mean

Hmm, works for me but SIP is
not my forte. What if you do a fresh build?

Hi Martin,

Your plugin compiles fine and the speed is much better than the previous
standard-attribute table. Good work!

I have two remarks though:

1: I am not so sure if it is user-friendly to hide all "Actions" behind
the action button. It may be good for devices with small screens, but for
regular desktop-computers I think the previous solutions with
buttons/icons was more straight-forward. One could even think about more
functionality for future tables - and I think an extra toolbar for extra
table functionality wouldn't be too bad.

2: I tested with a Postgis table and your Beata table implementation did
not show a column with the Postgis data type "Numeric" correctly. It just
displayed a column with no header and all NULL values instead.

Should I add a bug-report to track regarding issue 2?

Thanks for your cool work,
Andreas

I am wondering if your Beata implementation could also handle other
widgets next to text input widgets?

In the layers' properties dialog, in the attributes tab one can define
which widget to use for the show info dialogue. Wouldn't it be cool if the
same widgets would also be used in the regular attribute table?

For performance reasons it might be good to first display a regular table,
but after a user selected a certain row for editing, the input widgets
would change to whatever the user defined in the attributes tab of the
layer properties, e.g. a range slider, selection list, etc. would be
displayed.

Do you understand what I mean or should I explain more clearly?

Andreas

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Legend vs. Layers 
 
Hi list, 
 
I am wondering what the policy is on naming conventions in terms of  
tools, the QGIS interface, and map items. For example: 
I suggest that the text 'Legend' above the layer list should be changed  
to 'Layers'. Technically this isn't a legend: "A map legend can be  
defined as the reference area on a map that lists and explains the  
colours, symbols, line patterns, shadings, and annotation used on the  
map." The legend of course, it what we add to the map in the map  
composer, but what we are currently calling the legend is, in actual  
fact, simply a list of layers . 
 
I know this is really just a matter of semantics, but it has been  
mentioned before, and I think it's important to get these things right ;-)

Hi Carson!

Adding minimize button shouldn't be hard :-)

Regarding the actions (this is also re: Andreas) - I have always found
the buttons somehow inefficient - the icons are small and I found
myself always searching the right one (using tooltips). So I thought
that putting them to a separate menu would be a better solution (as
the menu item have icon+text). But if more users like the original
solution, this can be changed. Shortcuts can be added too.

I probably know what's the problem. I think there's missing a mapping
of column indices. If the provider has 3 columns, they could be e.g.
0,1,3 - but the attribute table asks for 0,1,2. This is sometimes a
case with postgresql, as the indices for columns are not reused (you
can check in postgis manager whether there is a hole or the problem is
really related to Numeric type.

Not necessary, I'll keep it on our todo list...

 Given that the only things that can be in that dialog are map layers
then I think currently the term 'Layers' is the best word we've got
for it.

 However if other content types can be added to a project then perhaps
that dialog should be titled 'Contents' or 'Project Contents'. By
"other content types" I'm thinking non-spatial graphics (such as fixed
overlays like the copyright, scale, or north-arrow items) or even
non-spatial data. Maybe one day Qgis will be able to look at
non-spatial database tables and link them with spatial data
dynamically, or have basic table editing functions on non-spatial
grids (like the attribute editor).

 Then I think the 'Project Contents' dialog would have a tree with
'Layers', 'Annotations', 'Data' items. And maybe more. I'd like to
keep working notes with my project file, so maybe there could be a
'Documentation' item for adding text files, or web links, or a full
set of wiki pages....

 Have I totally flown off the handle now?

Petter, Francesco, Jurgen,
Are there any roadblocks to getting QGIS into Debian unstable?

It seems:
1. Jurgen has build .deb files for QGIS and has committed to maintenance.
I'm not sure what level of testing Jurgen has
2. Both Francesco and Petter have volunteered to upload QGIS debian 
untested if their is a maintainer.

My motivation is that I want to get QGIS back into Ubuntu universe, and 
also into an Xubuntu based Live DVD to be handed out to all delegates at 
FOSS4G 2009.

It seem that the most direct way to get QGIS into Ubuntu, is to get it 
into Debian untested first. (Ref: 
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages )
This will be a lot more achievable if we meet the FeatureFreeze, 19 Feb, 
as per: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JauntyReleaseSchedule

I have some time this weekend to do some grunt work, if that helps.

fTools is overriding the QGIS about dialog on OS X. It needs to be

Also I would like to see the menu item be "fTools" rather than "Tools"

Oh damn, I accidentally linked Qgis to a dev copy of GEOS.   
Suggestion: wait until I package a correctly linked Qgis.

Hmmm, I wonder if that's why I had the Python problem with the Tiger  
Qgis build, which I fixed by building it on Tiger - and with a release  
version of my GEOS framework ;)

Hamish,
I see from the ticket you have reference below that you have fixed a 
number of issues, and it looks as if you consider all issues fixed (at 
least for the release you were addressing).

Has someone detailed a list of issues to fix, or steps to be followed 
for qgis 1.0.0 to get back into debian unstable?

0.11.0 -> 1.0.0 and mainly defining a trustable - i.e. one that will not disappear 
at the first problem or after one month - primary maintainer in debian.

We are thinking of releasing an ecw (maybe also MrSid) enabled gdal
through debian.gfoss.it, at least as a temporary solution.
Any help will be appreciated.
All the best.

Hi Carson

I think the legend is more than a layer list because it shows e.g. the classifications of vector layers using classification attribute, symbols for the individual classes and their values. For me that already explains something about the 'colours, symbols, line patterns used on the map' and about their semantics.

I don't care too much about the label of the legend, so no problem for me if you want to change it to 'Layers' or 'Layer list'. I just don't think it is usefull to rename all the legend classes in QGIS (e.g. QgsLegendLayer -> QgsLayerListLayer ).

Regards,
Marco

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Legend vs. Layers
 
Hi list,

I am wondering what the policy is on naming conventions in terms of 
tools, the QGIS interface, and map items. For example:
I suggest that the text 'Legend' above the layer list should be changed 
to 'Layers'. Technically this isn't a legend: "A map legend can be 
defined as the reference area on a map that lists and explains the 
colours, symbols, line patterns, shadings, and annotation used on the 
map." The legend of course, it what we add to the map in the map 
composer, but what we are currently calling the legend is, in actual 
fact, simply a list of layers .

I know this is really just a matter of semantics, but it has been 
mentioned before, and I think it's important to get these things right ;-)

Sorry! I've tried the new qgis but I receive this message from plugin:

    from psycopg2 import *
ImportError: No module named psycopg2


But I have psycopg2 installed.

I work under mac os x 10.5 Leopard but this error don't happen with qgis1.0
for tiger.


Also, If you call sys.argv, python whithin qgis don't see the method
argv.Very very strange problem for me.


Bye bye

Hi John,

please try the updated version, it should hopefully fix linking problems:

Are you using the python.org Python on Leopard, instead of the the  
system Python?

If you use the python.org Python on Leopard, you must use the Tiger  
Qgis.

I don't know about this one.  Was this before or after my relink  
update?  Does it work with the Tiger Qgis?

I use Python.org, so I understand that it's correct if I use Tiger Qgis

I don't know about this one.  Was this before or after my relink update?
>  Does it work with the Tiger Qgis?

The problem was present before and don't work with any version.

I've realized a plugin and I want to separate alls my scripts into
subfolders; so I must to add the path in sys,path, and to maintain a cross
platform characteristic, I call sys.argv to pass the name of qgis path under
mac os, windows or linux. But sys.argv isn't present.
I asked about this on it.comp.lang.python list, but no one can help me.

Bye bye and thanks a lot

I agree, renaming all the classes would be a nightmare, and I don't want 
that on my conscience, the only thing that would be changed here is the 
label. The reason for this is really interoperability: most other GIS 
(open-source and otherwise) have this area on the interface labeled

be migrating...

Just my two cents...

Hello,

Thought I would wade into the discussion here, Layers VS Legends

Features are represented in Layers and Legends

The biggest discerning factors between Layers and a Legend are:

1.	Layers visually inform a user as to the specific "Level/Hierarchy"  
of a feature polygon, line, point, image, and/or file with respect to  
other Layers.
	A Legend visually informs a map reader of the graphical symbolization  
represented for a feature based on defining attributes and grouped not  
by the "Level" it is drawn, but by the grouping of its Like Attributes.

2. 	A Layers table must list all features contained within a map  
display.
	A Legend is not required to list all features contained within a map  
display.

3. 	Legends often contain more map/reader information than is  
contained within the Map View.

for example -

Point features are normally placed on Higher "Levels" than Polylines,  
Polygons, and Images and are grouped in a hierarchically manner in a  
Layers table.
However, in a Legend it may make more sense to a map reader to group,  
for instance, Lakes, Rivers, Well Points together under WATER, rather  
than groups of Polylines, Polygons, and Images.

I certainly agree with this point.  The Layer vs. Legend debate (I  
believe) is more for an End User UI than Developer codings.

It may be worth some thought though for future proofing the code, if  
ever a true Legend implementation is added to QGIS (like in ArcGIS).


just some thoughts,

Mars

Is it possible to add search capabilities to docs? Doxygen can do it

Hi Gary,

there are many places that contain links to the docs, moving all urls
from doc.qgis.org/ to doc.qgis.org/stable/ will break the links. A
better solution IMHO would be to keep the stable docs in root and
leave there a link to development version.

Seems like a real problem on Mac to access the application from a
plugin. To overcome this problem, I've temporarily disabled actions
copy selected rows to clipboard and zoom to selected. I hope now it
won't cause compilation problems:

http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/beata-snapshot-090207-2.tar.gz

This version also fixes the minimization button and saves window position.

If there are not any objections, I'll import the into trunk in few days.

Any place that has a link to doc.qgis.org still works. Until the  
change, the docs were always generated out of unstable. Now at least  
you know what version you are getting.  What links are you referring to?

I mean direct links to class documentation.

I'm aware of:
- plugin template
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/branches/Version-1_0/src/plugins/plugin_template/README.whatnext
- wiki

I've done some URL rewriting to address the existing URLs. In looking  
at the examples in the wiki there are a lot of broken/outdated links  
(not related to doc.qgis.org).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OSM intergration: first public release
Message-ID: <e8e7199c0902071417h14b130aav681f72810b8ddbad@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm happy to introduce another piece of software from our labs! This
time it's OpenStreetMap intergration which comes in two parts:
- vector data provider - implemented in c++
- plugin - implemented in python (requires the provider for proper
functionality)

How to get it working:
- download the provider:
    http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/osm_provider-snapshot-090207.tar.gz
- copy it to source tree into directory src/providers and add the new
directory in src/providers/CMakeLists.txt
- do make and make install
- install the plugin from my sandbox repository:
    http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/plugins-sandbox.xml

Features:
- open .osm files
- download data from OSM server
- upload changes back to OSM server

OpenStreetMap data model is topological and allows assignment of
arbitrary tags to any nodes or arcs (called ways in osm). This has
several drawbacks when doing the integration.

When an .osm file is loaded, the user can select whether he wants to
load points and/or ways (they're loaded as separate layers). Only
nodes that are not assigned to any way are loaded in the point layer.
Ways represent both polylines and polygons (closed way), however
they're (not yet) recognized and handled only as lines. Not all
editing tasks can be accomplished with current set of editing tools in
QGIS, such as joining a way to another with common node or actions
that work with both nodes and ways. Probably a real topology editing
should be added (i.e. topology created from one or more vector
layers).

The next problem are the tags. They can virtually consist of any
number of key-value pairs. This makes classical approach with fixed
attributes unusable. We've decided to pack all the tags into one
attribute (in format "key1"="value1","key2=value2"), in future
releases we plan to create a simple widget that will explode the list
and bring a convenient GUI for editing of tags. This also complicates
symbolization: primary roads are defined by "highway"="primary" tag,
rivers as "waterway"="river" etc. We've added a possibility to select
what tags should be accessible directly - if you select "name" and
"highway", you will be able to apply correct symbols and optionally
also labeling with the names.

OpenStreetMap file format is XML. We've decided to cache the parsed
data in sqlite database, so further loads will be much quicker. The
cached data is put in the same directory and same name as original
file, with suffix ".db". It contains also all edits you've done in the
file. There's also upload functionality, but it's still very
experimental, so I advise you not to use it yet. Anyway there will be
a switch to new API in about two months and the plugin doesn't support
it.

Download should work fine - you can download either current extent or
some specific extent by entering coordinates. The server has limit on
total number of features to be returned and area, so make sure that
you're not trying to fetch too big extent. The server sometimes needs
quite some time to process the query, so be patient :-) It's possible
to get .osm data also from database dumps, e.g. geofabrik.de.

I would consider this as alpha release, but it should be already
usable for some basic usage.

Any testing and comments are highly welcome!

Regards
Martin

Hi,

 I've updated my repository with the latest versions of my plugins. The URL is:

 http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Qgis/Plugins/plugins.xml

 Also, I've written a little python script that gets my plugins out of
SVN and makes the zip files and xml file. It might be configurable for
your use, so I'm making it available. Source is linked from here:

http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Qgis/Utils/

 Let me know directly if there's anything wrong with the XML or zip
files produced. If there's any comments on the plugins themselves, I
think you can file an issue here:

 http://code.google.com/p/bsrplugins/

Martin,

Another great addition! This is already quite useful.

Some quick thoughts after a brief test.

1) It would be nice to have the option to automatically load a  
retrieved osm file when using the download feature.
2) The loaded osm layers are assigned the CRS of the current project.  
It should be set to the osm default (EPSG 4326, I assume)
3) Because there is no apparent CRS transform when the server request  
is made, it appears from my brief test that the project has to be  
WGS84 in order to download OSM data for the canvas extents. Using a  
UTM CRS retrieved empty osm files.
4) Even though a dialog is presented to allow the user to overwrite a  
file from the download widget, when you hit the download button, an  
error is given saying a file of that name already exists.
5) If you are able to overwrite a file, the associated db file  
probably needs to be removed also.

Thanks,
John

I also just noticed that trying to identify or select a line feature  
shows or selects all features. Maybe you covered this in your email.  
This seems strange, because I can classify "highways" with unique  
symbology, but I cannot use the Identify Feature tool on those unique  
items.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Some concerns about QGIS on OS X, part 1
Message-ID: <470484F5-ACA8-43C0-8B63-8CCDBC3BCA36@fastermac.net>

Out of curiosity, has anyone actually tried the C++ examples in the  
1.0 user guide, particularly on a Mac? I'm finding them pretty rough  
sledding.

Chapter 14, C++ plugin example:

The SVN sources for this example looked pretty old (2006), so I just  
copied and pasted step 1 into .pro, .h and .cpp files, then modified  
the .pro file as best I could figure for my system. Then what? Well,  
it doesn't say. After some googling, I tried running qmake and then  
make - nothing happened. More googling. Okay, apparently qmake  
creates an Xcode project, so I opened the .xcodeproj folder in Xcode.  
 From there I was able to build the library, although it ignored  
the .pro file's DEST setting and also gave a couple of warnings.  
However, looking at the resulting .dylib with otool -L and -h showed  
that the .dylib was linked differently from the other plugin .so  
files in /lib/qgis and was not a "bundle" (filetype 8). So I decided  
to go back to basics and compile and link the plugin myself.

By the way, here's what I had tried for a .pro file:

QGIS_DIR = /Users/phil/Desktop/qgis-1.0.0/qgis1.0.0.app/Contents/MacOs
TEMPLATE = lib
CONFIG = qt
QT += xml qt3support
unix:LIBS += -L$$QGIS_DIR/Lib
INCLUDEPATH += $$QGIS_DIR/include/qgis
SOURCES = qgspointconverterplugin.cpp
HEADERS = qgspointconverterplugin.h
DEST = pointconverterplugin.so
DEFINES += GUI_EXPORT= CORE_EXPORT=


Here's what I came up with:

#!/bin/sh
# Force Bourne shell in case tcsh is default.
#

BASE=~/Desktop/qgis-1.0.0/qgis1.0.0.app/Contents/MacOs

INCLUDE1=$BASE/include/qgis
INCLUDE2=/Library/Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Headers
INCLUDE3=/Library/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Headers
INCLUDES="-I$INCLUDE1 -I$INCLUDE2 -I$INCLUDE3"

LINK1=$BASE/Lib/libqgis_core.dylib
LINK2=$BASE/Lib/libqgis_gui.dylib
LINK3=$BASE/Lib/QtCore.framework/Versions/4/QtCore
LINK4=$BASE/Lib/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui
LINKS="$LINK1 $LINK2 $LINK3 $LINK4"

DEFINES="-D GUI_EXPORT= -D CORE_EXPORT="

XLINKER="-Xlinker -executable_path -Xlinker $BASE"
PLUGIN=pointconverterplugin

if [ -e "$INCLUDE1" ]
then
   if [ -e "$INCLUDE2" ]
   then
     moc -o moc_qgs$PLUGIN.cpp qgs$PLUGIN.h
     CMD="g++ -mmacosx-version-min=10.4 $DEFINES $INCLUDES $LINKS qgs 
$PLUGIN.cpp -o lib$PLUGIN.so -fPIC -bundle $XLINKER"
     echo executing: $CMD
     $CMD
     otool -L lib$PLUGIN.so
   else
     echo "Can't find Qt frameworks -- need to install Qt"
     echo "Did not find: $INCLUDE2"
   fi
else
   echo "Can't find QGIS -- change location of QGIS in this script"
   echo "Did not find: $INCLUDE1"
fi

This script successfully compiled both the step 1 and step 2 source  
and the resulting .so loaded fine in QGIS once placed in lib/qgis.  
Note that since the Qt header files are not included with QGIS, I had  
to use header files from a separate installation of the Qt frameworks.

Also, something that really tripped me up for a long time was the  
need to create the "moc" file. I then had to insert this in the  
qgspointconverterplugin.cpp file:

   #include "moc_qgspointconverterplugin.cpp"

However, when I tried the script with the step 3 source, I got an  
error about a missing geos_c.h file. Searching my system for this  
file didn't turn up anything, so at that point I gave up.

Question: Did the folks who wrote and compiled the C++ plugins  
included with the OS X QGIS have a chance to review Chapter 14 in the  
user guide?



Chapter 16, C++ application example:

This time I started with the SVN sources, but the compile  
instructions on page 157 are not correct. There is no "cmake" on my  
system. So back to the drawing board. This is what I came up with:

#!/bin/sh
# Force Bourne shell in case tcsh is default.
#
APP=main
QTBASE=/Library/Frameworks
FWEXT=.framework

LIB1=Core
LIB2=Gui
LIB3=Xml

QGISBASE=~/Desktop/qgis-1.0.0/qgis1.0.0.app/Contents/MacOs
BASE1=$QTBASE/Qt$LIB1$FWEXT
BASE2=$QTBASE/Qt$LIB2$FWEXT
BASE3=$QTBASE/Qt$LIB3$FWEXT

INCLUDEQG=$QGISBASE/include/qgis
INCLUDE1=$BASE1/Headers
INCLUDE2=$BASE2/Headers
INCLUDE3=$BASE3/Headers

LINKQG1=$QGISBASE/Lib/libqgis_core.dylib
LINKQG2=$QGISBASE/Lib/libqgis_gui.dylib
LINK1=$QGISBASE/Lib/Qt$LIB1$FWEXT/Versions/4/Qt$LIB1
LINK2=$QGISBASE/Lib/Qt$LIB2$FWEXT/Versions/4/Qt$LIB2

DEFINES="-D GUI_EXPORT= -D CORE_EXPORT="

INCLUDES="-I. -I$INCLUDEQG -I$INCLUDE1 -I$INCLUDE2 -I$INCLUDE3"
LINKS="$LINKQG1 $LINKQG2 $LINK1 $LINK2"
XLINKER="-Xlinker -executable_path -Xlinker $QGISBASE"

if [ -e "$LINKQG1" ]
then
   CMD="g++ -mmacosx-version-min=10.4 $DEFINES $INCLUDES $LINKS  
main.cpp -o $APP $XLINKER"
   echo executing: $CMD
   $CMD
   otool -L $APP
else
# QGIS not in expected location or different version.
   echo "Can't find QGIS -- check location of QGIS in this script"
   echo "Did not find: $LINKQG1"
fi


The resulting compiled executable does work, but only if you create  
an app bundle for it and copy the QGIS libraries and Qt frameworks  
from the qgis1.0.0.app bundle, thus duplicating them on your system.

It seems like the C++ instructions in the user guide present good  
examples of the directions-to-the-wedding-reception paradox, where  
the directions only make sense to a local, who does not need them  
since he already knows the area. Same with these examples: anyone who  
can successfully compile them in short order probably doesn't need  
the instructions, whereas those who struggle need much more than what  
is in the user guide.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <8617B810-07F3-4C8E-B106-1125CB0918E5@fastermac.net>

Unmac-ish behavior:

- Non-native dialogs.

- Open dialog doesn't show other mounted volumes.

- ~/.qgis   This is a goofy Linux trick that unfortunately Finder  
honors, meaning it's difficult to browse your plugins with Finder  
unless you know the trick of entering ~/.qgis in Finder's Go | Go to  
folder. Why not put the plugins in ~/Library somewhere, maybe under  
Preferences or Plug-ins or something?

- Case-sensitive list in Plugin Manager. Only in some weird Unix  
world would I think to look for fTools at the bottom of an  
alphabetical list. OS X file system is case insensitive. Lists should  
be too.

- Too many Linux assumptions. See page 42 in user guide:

     Your action text now looks like this:
   firefox http://google.com/search?q=%NAMES

Wrong. On OS X, Firefox is an app bundle (folder) named Firefox.app  
which will not be in the path. Even if it were, this is the wrong way  
to launch any app with OS X. Instead, enter something like this:

open "http://google.com/search?q=%NAME"

This launches whatever the default browser is on the system, so you  
don't need to know its name or path.


Thanks.

Message-ID: <F0544BD4-F7EC-4EBD-94F1-6C0E58EAA8C6@fastermac.net>

Many programmers, particularly new programmers, prefer to use LWOHF  
(languages without header files). I'm thinking here of the .NET  
languages C#, VB.NET and Delphi Prism (nee Oxygene) or Object Pascal  
as implemented in Delphi and Free Pascal. Currently QGIS only  
provides two extremes for adding value, C++ and Python. If this were  
1999, in the heyday of desktop development, perhaps these traditional  
languages would make sense. But if we're living in 2009, or planning  
for, say, 2011, it would seem as though also having choices somewhere  
in the middle of the language spectrum would help QGIS adoption.

What about proceduralizing the QGIS API similar to the way Den Jean  
has proceduralized much of the Qt API?

http://users.telenet.be/Jan.Van.hijfte/qtforfpc/fpcqt4.html

This would open up QGIS to most languages that can import C libraries.

In my experience, C++ in the hands of even good programmers often  
results in unstable, fragile, difficult-to-maintain code, whereas  
Python is, well, a scripting language. Certainly Python has its uses  
and fTools and the Plugin Installer are excellent examples of how far  
you can take Python. But there are also many cases where Python is  
not appropriate and a compiled language is needed. (cf. the  
performance issues of the Python "Sugar" front-end and Python  
"activities" (apps) on the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) computers.)

Following Den's lead, an interface library written in C++ that  
flattens the QGIS API might look like this:

#include <qgsapplication.h>
#include "qgsapplication.hb"

QgsApplicationH QgsApplication_create(int* argc, char** argv, int p3)
{
	return (QgsApplicationH) new QgsApplication(*(int*)argc, argv, p3);
}

void QgsApplication_destroy(QgsApplicationH handle)
{
	delete (QgsApplication *)handle;
}

int QgsApplication_exec()
{
	return (int) QgsApplication::exec();
}

In Pascal, this library's functions can be imported like this:

function QgsApplication_create(argc: PInteger; argv: PPAnsiChar; p3:  
Integer = QT_VERSION): QgsApplicationH; overload; cdecl; external  
QgisIntf name 'QgsApplication_create';
procedure QgsApplication_destroy(handle: QgsApplicationH); cdecl;  
external QgisIntf name 'QgsApplication_destroy';
function QgsApplication_exec(): Integer; cdecl; external QgisIntf  
name 'QgsApplication_exec';

I've already tested this and it does work on OS X. I would follow up  
with more of this interface library, but I'm not sure I'm qualified -  
I'm not much of a C++ programmer, I have no GIS background, and I  
have no understanding of QGIS's architecture. Maybe there's somebody  
less error prone in this area who would be interested.

Again, the objective here is to make adding value to QGIS as painless  
as possible.

Thanks.

Do you plan to replace the current table implementation or add this as an 
additional plugin? Personally I think it will be better to replace the 
existing table. I havent had a chance to look at / try your code yet, but for 
me the ideal would be to have a qgstablemodel added to core and a qgstableview 
added to gui, and then the table implementation to use these on a form. Is 
that the way you planned it?

I plan to replace the current table with the new implementation when
we'll be happy with the new one. From the beginning I would leave the
table in app itself, later we could move it to gui library. Is there
any reason to put model to core library? Although it's not a gui class
I don't see benefits of having a model alone in core library.

Well, I decided to start from scratch.  My old Xcode project was pre- 
cmake and too many files and targets moved around.  And a change in  
the way Xcode processes C++ compilation made me think I had used the  
wrong project template.

I have the core Qgis libs and app, and all but one of the providers/ 
plugins, working.


For some reason, the north arrow plugin won't compile.  With  
moc_plugingui.cpp, plugin.cpp and plugingui.cpp sources I get:

plugingui.h:21: error: expected class-name before '{' token

I have found that Xcode (and when compiling in a Terminal) often  
quietly ignores missing headers, but I think that's OK here.  Same  
compilation command as in a cmake build (though I could be overlooking  
something), and same Xcode target configuration as all the other  
[working] plugins.  I don't know how to track down an error like this...


A couple questions about the documentation.

- What is help_viewer app needed for?  The "Help Index" from the Help  
menu opens said index in Safari.  The pdf userguide is linked from  
that index.  If the help_viewer is what is opening Safari, seems like  
that should just be done directly by Qgis.

- A suggestion: have the userguide pdf directly accessible from the  
Help menu - saves an application switch.

- I notice that the userguide.pdf is from v0.9.1.  Shouldn't this have  
been updated before the 1.0 release?

Try adding:

#include <QDialog>

after the line containing #include "ui_pluginguibase.h"

Yes, I noticed this too. The current 1.0 documentation should have  
been included, something that can't be fixed on the next maintenance  
release.

What is the format of this context help?  I'm just wondering if it  
could also be opened in a web browser, or the system help viewer.

Note: just found that the help_viewer in my binary has more of those

I suppose it could be, sinct the help files are in a simple HTML format.

That error is common to all the sources I mentioned.  I didn't mention  
some other errors that are also from plugingui.cpp:

/Users/Shared/src/qgis/qgis_1.0.0/mac/Qgis/../../src/plugins/ 
north_arrow/plugingui.cpp: In constructor  
'QgsNorthArrowPluginGui::QgsNorthArrowPluginGui(QWidget*, Qt::WFlags)':
/Users/Shared/src/qgis/qgis_1.0.0/mac/Qgis/../../src/plugins/ 
north_arrow/plugingui.cpp:24: error: 'setupUi' was not declared in  
this scope
/Users/Shared/src/qgis/qgis_1.0.0/mac/Qgis/../../src/plugins/ 
north_arrow/plugingui.cpp:26: error: 'tabNorthArrowOptions' was not  
declared in this scope

... and more

I figured these were just a byproduct of the first error, but they  
might help.  It's almost like ui_pluginguibase.h isn't getting  
included properly...

On a closer look, it would mean changing the context help setup.  They  
are just the body of html (and no .html file extension), qgis_help  
adds the <html> and <body> tags.  It also shows a help-not-found  
message.

It turns out you can generate an Xcode project with cmake, you just  
need to edit it afterwards to fix it up a bit.

cmake -G Xcode

Then edit the qgis1.0.0.xcode/project.pbxproj and replace all  
occurrences of \\ with a single \

The project then loads---now I only have 202 errors. Plus there is  
some serious namespace clash with the GDAL header files...

Ahhhh... rrgghh!  Some weird Xcode magic going on here.  Xcode makes  
use of header map (.hmap) files to locate intermediate and target  
headers, in addition to standard -I flags you may add to a target.   
One of these hmaps that is included in every target (!) is the  
location of ALL headers in the whole project.  hmap flags are all  
before the target defined header paths, so they are searched first.

Since many/most of the plugins use the same source file names, from  
the plugin template, there is confusion.  And for just this target, it  
was finding the ui_pluginguibase.h from the copyrightlabel plugin first.

I expect there will be more problems on a complete rebuild.  I was  
building targets for each plugin before creating the target for the  
next, so early plugins don't have ui headers from later plugins in  
their hmaps yet.


Possible solutions:

- rename plugin headers to include the plugin name. A big change in  
the source layout. But a test with the current northarrow plugin ui  
header worked.

- find an Xcode option to NOT include the all-project headers.  I'll  
dig around.  I may try that cmake xcode generator to see if it has any  
hints.

- add headers to the target, then they'll be added to the target hmap,  
which is searched before all others.  This did not work.

USE_HEADERMAP = NO

The one option I found in the Xcode docs that looked like it would do  
it, didn't do a thing.  I found USE_HEADERMAP in some discussion,  
indirectly off the Apple forums.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Compiling tutorials on windows
Message-ID: <498FFCED.1030803@nordcomp.ru>

Hello, mailing list!
I`m new in QGIS developing and trying to compile tutorials on windows. 
I`m checked sources from svn:
svn co 
https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/code_examples/1_hello_world_qgis_style
cd 1_hello_world_qgis_style
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

And CMake prints some errors:
CMake Error: CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to 
"Visual Studio 6".  CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set.  You probably need to 
select a different build tool.
CMake Error: Could not find cmake module 
file:C:/dev/1_hello_world_qgis_style/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeCCompiler.cmake
CMake Error: Could not find cmake module 
file:C:/dev/1_hello_world_qgis_style/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeCXXCompiler.cmake
CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)

  should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be 
lower
  if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
  information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

What should I do to compile this tutorial? I have MinGW, Qt4.4.3 and 
QGIS 1.0 installed

One more reason to release 1.1.
Maybe your boss could sponsor this release?
All the best.

Hi all!
Marco Hugentobler kindly fixed a bug in QGIS 1.0.0 I needed to be fixed, but 
now I'm not able to try it because building QGIS on Windows is beyond my 
possibilities.

Is there enough asking for a new build of QGIS in osgeo4w?
Is it already scheduled, so I can simply wait for it?

If not any of the two, may I ask someone to do it for me, giving him/her a 
reward for it?

I know it was discussed about knightly builds in the past.
Maybe could my boss sponsorship it?

Thank you for the good work!
Greetings,
Vito

	plugin (Windows)
Message-ID: <49903798.2080804@ija.csic.es>

Hi!

The following error only occurs if the R (2.7.2) session is started
from a GRASS shell opened through the QGIS GRASS plugin in windows.
The error does not occur If R is started form its own icon
or by double click in the .RData  object,  but then the spgrass6
package would not find the GRASS environment.

It also works in linux.
The involved  commands  are:

1. Start  QGIS
2. Star GRASS plugin and open mapset
3.  Open Grass Shell
4.  Run R and execute require(spgrass6)

We are talking about it, it would be our first step into the Open Source 
Community.

Personally I'd  like more he let me work for the Community on something like 
doc writing or translating, something where I can be of help right now, say 2 
hours a week.
But then it would be so easy to be taken from something else... 
maybe the sponsorship is better.

Let's see what the managers say.
Cheers,
Vito

Hi Andreas,

there is a missing #include which causes that the compilation fails on
some configurations.
Please use a newer snapshot with the fixed problem:

In this case, please join our manual translation team: Patti has already
done a fair amount of work.

I'd like to wait for a few more bug fixes to go into stable branch and then do 
the release in time for FOSSGIS & the QGIS hackfest.

I meant to say the release of 1.0.1 in time for  FOSSGIS & the QGIS hackfest. 
Perhaps 1.1 too if we can be ready for that...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Spell Check
Message-ID: <4990C4FF.2050901@wildintellect.com>

As part of the Xml metadata editor plugin we plan to inlcude spell
checking. I was wondering if such a library was included in QGIS already
or if people had suggestions about which library to use.

I'm currently looking into using the same library as OOo and Firefox
assuming I can find some way to easily import it into python.
I believe it's hunspell.

Thanks,
Alex

Go ahead and create all those interfaces if you like. Most people
I know, however, seem to be quite happy with C++ and Python.
Any language that does not have an open source implementation or
is not available for all QGIS-supported OS seems to be a waste of
time, though.

Hi

I dont have a windows dev environment to test on. But I suggest trying to use 
cmakesetup - the cmake gui application to configure before trying to build. You 
need to also have all the QGIS development libs and headers available.

If you do get it to build, please contribute your notes back to me so I can 
incorporate them into the tutorial for the benifit of other win users.

Regards

Tim

thank you - it compiles fine now.

Is this plugin Proxy-aware? Probably not - I tried the downloader at work
and it times out after a while. I will try again at home where I don't
have to go through the proxy ...

I'll report if it works from home.

Thanks,
Andreas

 +1 from me.

 And now for some comments for the OP:

 Wut? 1999 was they heyday of bad web development as I recall. <blink>
tag anyone?

 And all the better for it. Sure, I get less slacking off time:
[http://xkcd.com/303/]  but more python coding time
[http://xkcd.com/353/].

>> Certainly Python has its uses and fTools and the Plugin

 Most things done by Python in Qgis will be calling the underlying C++
API, and Python speed won't be an issue. Any speed-critical tasks can
easily be developed in Python and rewritten in C and compiled and
distributed as Python modules or native C plugins if necessary.
Knuth's "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of
the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil." applies.

 Writing python plugins is pretty painless - in fact it's a pleasure.
I define pleasure (partly) as something I wish I had more time for.

I've been trying to figure this bit out:

>> Many programmers, particularly new programmers, prefer to use LWOHF (languages without header files).

 "[Citation Needed]" as wikipedia would say. Google doesn't find
anything meaningful for 'LWOHF' and doesn't match quoted "languages
without header files". So either you made this up or the first rule of
LWOHF is 'Don't talk about LWOHF', and the second rule of LWOHF is
'Don't talk about LWOHF'.

Rather a Unix standard than a goofy trick, perhaps? Meaning: this is
what works just fine for perhaps a majority of the developers and users
on this list. I do agree though, that it would make sense to stick more
closely to Mac OS X conventions for that particular environment.
How about you put some work into fine-tuning the Mac OS X version?

Well, you did find it. So the system works. And for some reason it seems
to make sense to a lot of people, including myself.

In this case, rather an assumption that includes Linux and Windows and
pretty much any other OS QGIS runs on except Mac OS X. It is true
though, that the user guide needs to cover OS-specific details.
I suppose we simply don't have enough active Mac users around to
contribute all of those, so feel free to chip in.

Which means that you will no longer be able to exchange a QGIS project
that includes "action links" in an attribute table with users on other
systems. This may actually be a tough problem and needs some thought.
Just going the Mac way because it is presumably better is certainly
not the answer.

Hi Andreas,

you're right, we haven't included proxy support yet. Will be done in
some future release...

Gentlemen,
I'm encouraged by the breath of people who obviously see value in 
packaging qgis for debian and are prepared to commit to making it happen.
It seems that qgis will be back in debian soon, but not soon enough to 
meet the FeatureFreeze date of 19 Feb for the Ubuntu 9.04 release schedule.
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JauntyReleaseSchedule

It has also become apparent to me that my newbie offer of short term 
help is not what is required, and at the moment I'm not able to commit 
more than that.

I'm going to continue being very interested and encouraging from the 
sidelines, especially as I'm expecting to see qgis in the LiveDVD which 
will be handed to all delegates at the FOSS4G conference I'm helping 
organise this year.

Feel free to ping me if there are specific things you think I can 
facilitate, in particular to do with FOSS4G, the LiveDVD, or UbuntuGIS.

Unfortunately merging using svn is not a great idea, that's not git
or mercurial. I basically see not great advantage in respect with
lurking external repos from time to time to check for interesting
changes. BTW, the true problem is finding a maintainer who is able to
and would take responsability at long term, not repository location.

Yes, the standard file dialogs like Open.

A few apps that have been rudely ported to Mac, such as Gimp and  
Mono, do use a "." file or folder, but this is not the way truly  
native Mac apps do it. I see that QGIS does use ~/Library/Preferences  
for its .plist preferences file, so that's good to see.

I'm still evaluating QGIS and trying to figure out whether I belong  
here. Right now all I can do is report issues that I've encountered.

Let's test that assumption. You go into a bookstore to buy a book of  
poems by ee cummings. You can't find him in the "C" section and give  
up. Unbeknownst to you they had filed his books after "Z".

I don't think the example works on Windows either. Even if Firefox is  
installed, it won't normally be on the path, so something like this  
would be necessary:

"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" "http://google.com/ 
search?q=%NAME"

Note that QGIS 1.0 crashes if given anything invalid, so the quotes  
are required, as is the presence of Firefox in the C:\Program Files  
folder.

Actually, to shell to an external application, Linux is kind of the  
odd man out. With both Windows and OS X, you just shell to the  
document file and the OS launches the application that's associated  
with that file. With Windows, all files with a given extension map to  
a single application, so it's not perfect, but on Mac individual  
files can be associated with different apps, thus overriding the  
extension-based default app. Not sure why this doesn't work with QGIS  
on Windows - that is, if using the Win API ShellExecute function,  
only the URL would be needed and Windows will launch your default  
browser to open the URL. For some reason that doesn't work with QGIS.  
Maybe somebody could review how external apps are launched - maybe  
the assumption is that an app will always be specified, which makes  
sense on Linux but not on Windows or OS X.

Thanks.

"Most people I know" - hmm.

Free Pascal is open source and available on all platforms. Same with  
most .NET languages - VB.NET, C# and Delphi Prism apps run pretty  
well under Mono too on all platforms and the compilers too.

Thanks.

My current GIS is .NET based and so you write plugins in any .NET  
language. I had never done any .NET programming before but found  
plugin development to be a delight with both VB.NET and Oxygene  
Pascal. No complicated linking, no header files, mix and match  
assemblies (.dll's) from any .NET language without worrying about  
what language they were written in - a real breath of fresh air  
compared to GNU tools.

Where this is important is a couple of places. I've heard it said  
more than once that any programmer can learn GIS but that not every  
GIS person can learn programming. I don't think that's true, but in  
any case two groups that can benefit from a wider choice in  
development language are (1) non-GIS programmers who want to direct  
as much of their attention to learning GIS instead of learning the  
programming toolset, and (2) GIS types who may not yet be strong  
programmers and want to direct as much of their attention to being  
productive in their programming.

Thanks.

The best thing is, in my view, that one of the larger users of QGIS on
Debian or Ubuntu will decide this is important enough to allocate one
dev specifically to this. It is not a major commitment, probably a few
hours/month (Frankie: am I wrong?), so quite feasible.
All the best.

We don't support many other languages - no fun if you're into Haskell,
Prolog, Ada or Basic. We've chosen to add Python support in addition
to native C++ and it was a good choice. I don't want to go into any
kind of language war, but I advise you to check out language
comparison at Ohloh [1]. You'll find pascal in about 0.5% of monthly
commits, while python is somewhere at 7% and steadily growing.

Your posts seem to me more like trolling than some objective critics.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Segmentation fault while reading raster maps
Message-ID: <d924770902110759x2b308dd8uc079dfcd73e616f8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a segmentation fault with a python plugin when I do some
multiples reading of raster maps.
I can exhibit a small piece of code that can do it almost every times :
--8<------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import sys
from qgis.core import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *

if __name__ == "__main__":
   # initialize qgis libraries
   QgsApplication.initQgis()
   for f in sys.argv[1:]:
      print f,"..."
      rlayer = QgsRasterLayer(QString(f), QFileInfo(f).baseName())
   # clean qgis libraries
   QgsApplication.exitQgis()
--8<------------------------------
You have to call it with redondant maps, for exemple :
python testRead.py 7124_2.kap 7124_4.kap 7124_2.kap 7124_4.kap

I have this behaviour with :
- some personal bsb raster files
- the NOAA bsb maps
- with qgis 1.0 on ubuntu gutsy
- with qgis 1.0 on windows (osgeo4w build)

I've compiled qgis 1.0 with debug symbols and here's the backtrace of
the segmentation fault with my plugin :

I had posted on the forums but unfortunately without results. See
http://forum.qgis.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=4480

Is it a bug of qgis or a misuse of QgsRasterLayer ?

Thanks

I think your idea is interesting but would add a level of complexity to the 
QGIS project that we are not equipped to handle at this time. Our developer 
team is small and in most cases volunteer only, so for me it doesnt make sense 
to embark an additional major maintenance commitment at this stage.

Mac support is continually improving in QGIS but is subject to some 
limitations. In this last release Tom Elwertowski went to a lot of effort to 
improve QGIS to follow HIGs for win/kde/gnome/os x. Obviously there is still 
more to be done but short of maintaining a separate development tree for a Mac 
version of QGIS, building a cross platform application will invariably involve 
some compromises. At least until we have enough champions for each platform to 
ensure proper HIG compliance at any rate. As such we would welcome your 
contributions / patches to help improve things on the OS X platform.

Regards

That 0.5% is probably about the same as the desktop Linux share of  
the OS marketplace and you don't hear people suggesting that it's  
time to euthanize Linux.

Considering how much time I've spent working with QGIS and its API's  
and the 94 posts I've made on the QGIS forum in an attempt to help  
other users, that comment is more than a bit offensive.

Thanks.

Hello again,

2009/2/11 JJL <buggerone@gmail.com>:
> I have a segmentation fault with a python plugin when I do some

I still have the problem with trunk but I think I found the bug in
QgsRasterLayer class.

mColorShadingAlgorithm is used uninitialized in
setColorShadingAlgorithm() after the QgsRasterLayer instance is
created. So if it has the same value as theShadingAlgorithm the
setRasterShaderFunction() is not called on mRasterShader.

If I simply add :
mColorShadingAlgorithm = QgsRasterLayer::UndefinedShader;
to the QgsRasterLayer constructor, I have no more crash. I'm not sure
this is the right value to use for init.

Should I fill a bug in trac for this to be included in next
maintenance release ?

Regards
JJL

But you're comparing two different things.
While there's just little cost to maintain QGIS available for all
major OS (thanks to Qt), there's more maintenance cost for keeping
language bindings in sync.

Howdy JJL.

mColorShadingAlgorithm is an enum so it will always be initialized. Your 
suggested fix works because you have effectively just "turned off" 
shading. The little code snipped you sent in the previous message seems 
to work fine with valid rasters, three band as well as paletted.

I am inclined to believe that the problem has to do with your data being 
recognized as a paletted image, but the color table is missing, which we 
should be able to gracefully deal with no matter. Any chance that  one 
of your layers has a .qml associated with it?

If you possible, could you send me a link to where I could get a copy of 
one of your images that is causing the segfaults?

Hi Martin,

just wanted to report back that I could compile your plugin fine and I 
could the OSM data fine. Looking forward to your upcoming symbolization 
enhancements!

Thanks for your contributions,
Andreas

Hello,

Hum, sounds quite strange to me. If I dump the value of
mColorShadingAlgorithm at the beginning of setColorShadingAlgorithm, I
have 0 or very weird values (see attached txt file) Just before the
crash, its value is 3, the same as theShadingAlgorithm
Also the attached c++ code give me strange results.
But I'm not a C++ developer, only a C one. So I'm really lost with all
this C++ stuff (and qgis is huge). Surely I missed something.

I do not have the crash every run of the test. I have to read many
times the same file. When I found the "right" number of reading for a
file, it always crashes.

No I only have the .kap files.
Maybe you can find more details in the full debug output (qgis 1.0 in
ubuntu) available here :
http://kubuntu.free.fr/tmp/qgis_debug.gz

> If you possible, could you send me a link to where I could get a copy of one

Yes, as they're not freely available, I send you the link in a private mail.
I also have the same crash with kap files from NOAA, for example :
python testRead.py testmaps/11009_1.KAP testmaps/11009_1.KAP
testmaps/11009_1.KAP testmaps/11009_1.KAP testmaps/11009_1.KAP

Well, would you look at that. I stand corrected on enums defaulting to 
their first value.

I will take a look through, because regardless of whether the color 
shading algorithm is initialized/set or not, a default  shader exists 
and it should be stable in its initial "uninitialized" state.

Sorry to come in late to this thread. How much time is still left (if any)? 
I'm wondering if we have time to put a 1.0.1 bugfix release out and get that 
rolled into the next ubuntu release rather than 1.0.1

Hmm this example is indeed out of date since we have moved to using CMake for 
all build tasks and this plugin example does not yet reflect this. I have added 
a note in the manual sources that this section needs updating. For now I 
suggest using the plugin builder script to generate a cmakelists.txt if you 
want to build your plugin within the source tree, 

If you are looking for an example of a QGIS plugin that is built outside of 
the QGIS source tree I can suggest you take a look at Peter Erst's 'EVIS' 
plugin which I believe builds under OS X too:

svn co https://svn.biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/public/evis/trunk/evis

So, I looked into it a little more and I think the best solution is to
use Enchant, and in this case pyEnchant which allows for multiple
spelling backends: aspell, myspell, hunspell etc.

This brings me back to something that I've been wondering about, where
has the discussion gone on making python plugins python eggs.
I bring this up because if the plugin was an egg, making sure pyEnchant
installs would be really easy since it's normally distributed via
easy_install and the cheeseshop.

Also it would take the work out of packaging since distutil already
supports it.

Any thoughts?

Hi

I noticed that in the manual, there is a missing note on how to invoke qmake with the .pro file ('qmake -o Makefile pointconverter.pro', then 'make'). That should work also on Mac and replace the complicated script of Mac Programmer.

The example originally comes from a workshop (FOSSGIS 2006) but I updated the plugin to work together with 1.0 sources. In the workshop, I used qmake because it was the intention to make everything as simple as possible (only 2h time for the workshop). In the manual it would also be possible to use cmake or to add a note on how to make CMakeList.txt.

Regards,
Marco

Hmm this example is indeed out of date since we have moved to using CMake for 
all build tasks and this plugin example does not yet reflect this. I have added 
a note in the manual sources that this section needs updating. For now I 
suggest using the plugin builder script to generate a cmakelists.txt if you 
want to build your plugin within the source tree, 

If you are looking for an example of a QGIS plugin that is built outside of 
the QGIS source tree I can suggest you take a look at Peter Erst's 'EVIS' 
plugin which I believe builds under OS X too:

svn co https://svn.biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/public/evis/trunk/evis

Message-ID: <200902130814.06646.tim@linfiniti.com>

Dear all

Can we take a few moments to realign ourselves towards another release? 

Firstly I would like to put out a 1.0.1 maintenance release. If anyone has 
additional language updates, bug fixes etc please get them into the stable 
branch over the next week. I will branch 1.0.1 on Friday 19th. I will not go 
through the full checklist process, but simply call for new packages on the 
20th and announce the update when the release is packaged.

Secondly, I would like to get the release checklist timelines done for QGIS 
1.1 [2] and to do that I need to get a better idea of current status and 
plans. I am hoping that we can release by the end of March or early April - 
how does that work for everyone?

Could I ask all those who are busy with (or have implemented) new features in 
trunk the visit the checklist [2] and add your features near the top of the 
file and an estimate of the time you need to complete work on the feature.


Also a couple of reminders:

- If you append new methods to the public API (qgis_core & qgis_gui) please 
include a doxygen note like this:

/* This method makes coffee, tea and crumpets
 * @param int Number of crumpets
 * @return int Number of burned crumpets
 * @note This method was added in QGIS 1.1. Avoid using this if you wish 
 *             to maintain compatibility with the QGIS 1.0 stable release
*/                

- (especially for those who recently obtained SVN write access) that even 
though we now have a stable branch, in-progress features should not be worked 
on in trunk but in a separate branch.

- Please remember to port fixes from trunk to stable branch [1] or verca vica 
as applicable when you commit them. The simplest way I have found to do that 
is to generate a diff before applying your changes and then switch to the other 
version and apply the patch. Otherwise you can use svn merge....


Looking forward to the next release!

 Qt have a spell-checking version of QTextEdit which is currently
Mac-only because it uses the Mac OS spell-checking service:

http://www.qtsoftware.com/products/appdev/add-on-products/catalog/4/Widgets/qtspellcheckingtextedit

 perhaps it might be better to try and implement spell checking for
Windows/Linux on top of that, and contribute it back to Qt). Just
having a look at the code for that, it seems you'd have to implement
the mac-specific parts of the widget to call whatever spelling backend
you've got - but you'd need to do it in C++.

 If not, I'm sure a Python-based QSpellCheckingTextEdit would be very useful!

 I've not seen any discussion on this. But it would need rewriting the
plugin manager. I do like the idea of being able to get python
dependencies automatically though.

When do you estimate feature freeze?
Because I like to make the overlay (diagram) branch ready for testing next week. I hope there is still time for testing and merging before freeze.

One benifit that I can think of is that 3rd party developers could use the 
model in their own table view implementations. I think this will be especially 
useful if you implement delegates with widgets in your table view 
implementation as others have suggested - since 3rd party apps may want to 
implement more basic / different views.

Also I think for logical consistency it makes sense to put it into core since 
it is a non gui class.

I was going to let people populate the checklist with the features they have 
in queue and an estimate of when they think it will be ready, and then draw up 
a timetable for that. Certainly I will make sure to give you adequate time to 
merge and test before freezing. I was thinking of feature freezing in the first 
week of March and then we could use the hackfest to polish and bugfix. That 
said it may be nice to be able to add features during the hackfest -- in which 
case we could plan the feature freeze for late March, and a release in Mid 
April?

Releasing 1.0.1 in about a week sounds good.

I think that mid-April would be fine (so that svn trunk is open for hackfest).

Will do. I'd like to get improved attribute table and new symbology into 1.1.
Ideally also OpenStreetMap support, let's see what we'll manage to get ready...

I would also add a reminder that when modifying some class in
qgis_core or qgis_gui, the devs should make sure that they've synced
the changes with python bindings.

The ogr provider has two methods named fileVectorFilters()  one inside the class

and one as QGISEXTERN.

 

I added some more functions:

 

QString databaseDrivers();

QString directoryDrivers();

QString protocolDrivers();

 

 

Reviewing the code I found that fileVectorFilters is called through QgsProviderRegistry my question

is if it ok to add all these functions to ogrprovider and their equivalents in QgsProviderRegistry.

 

Also I would like to add a method to ogrprovider to create an ogr uri given its connection parameters

and type, this method needs to be called before an instance of qgsvectorlayer is created

but I didn't found a way to call this method without adding compile time dependencies.

 

I implemented the method directly in qgsopenvectordialog but with new drivers will

be needed to update both ogrprovider and qgsopenvectorlayerdialog.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis Xcode project test
Message-ID: <80336F4E-FCC5-42C0-BBD1-181438211BFB@kyngchaos.com>

My Xcode project is ready for some testing.  There is a readme in the  
project for configuration and building, and another readme for  
developers with some random notes on maintainance and the structure of  
the project.

http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/macosxport/qgis-xcode-2.0.zip


Comments and suggestions welcome.  Especially on the configuration - I  
tried to make it as painless as possible, but it's still not automatic  
like running a configure command to search out dependencies.  There  
are layers of configuration for dependencies, and I think most people  
will only need the first 1 or 2 layers.  (See the Qgis install  
document for details on installing dependencies)


Other notes:

- a single-architecture (ie native) build should run faster than a  
cmake build.  This is because Xcode compiles sources in parallel,  
fully utilizing all processors and cores.  A universal build will be  
faster than in cmake if you have more than 2 processors/cores, for the  
same reason.

- I figured out how to get the bundled Qt frameworks to not get  
confused with an installed Qt: bundled frameworks (in general) must be  
installed in an application's Frameworks folder, otherwise the OSX  
linker loads installed frameworks over bundled copies.

This also applies to the help viewer app.  To get around this, I  
create a symlink in the qgis_help.app bundle pointing to the Qgis.app  
Frameworks folder.  qgis_help.app also needs the empty qt.conf file to  
fix the problem of loading the installed Qt plugins.

- In addition to using a Frameworks folder, I moved a few other things  
around: share/qgis stuff is in Resources, qgis plugins are in the  
package PlugIns folder, alongside the Qt imageformats, includes are in  
Headers.  I left the qgis libraries in MacOS/lib because the dynamic  
loading of libqgispython is hardwired to this folder, might as well  
keep all libraries there.

- there's a debug configuration which can be used in the Xcode debugger.

William,
First thing I've come up against:
qgis_settings.xcconfig line 257: Unable to find included file  
"qgis_user.xcconfig"


I renamed the template per your instructions.

I forgot to note that the project also takes care of bundling the Qt  
frameworks and support libraries, and all the install_name_tool stuff.

All I can think of is - which Xcode version?  The project is saved to  
be compatible with Xcode 2.4 (2.5 recommended), but I haven't had a  
chance to try it in 2.5 yet.  I do remember problems with Xcode 2.3 or  
2.4 updating the targets when the config files change *while* the  
project was open.

Just figured it out: if you rename/duplicate the qgis_user-template to  
qgis_user.xcconfig when the project is open, the project will see that  
it's present, but the build still remembers that it wasn't found.

Close the project and reopen it.

Nice! So it spits out a read to use / redistribute app bundle?

Yep!  If you use only shared and static libraries (and set the  
bundling settings), it will be an "all-in-one".  If you use my  
frameworks where possible (default settings), it will be like my  
distro.  It won't bundle frameworks, though that's a possibility, I  
don't know if it would handle the GDAL and PROJ data files right.

Ok, that made a difference, but it still isn't building for me.
I'm using XCode 3.1.2 and the project is in XCode 2.4 compatible format.

Just compiling the core library results in:

I'm compiling from trunk. I wonder if there are some things in there  
that aren't in your project?

Hmm, this would be the maintenance part of the project - any *new*  
sources aren't automatically added to the project.  Any time a source  
is added to a cmake list, it would have to be added to the Xcode  
project and corresponding target in the project.

So I added the missing source files, now the only problem is the  
missing moc files that go along with it. Are those set up to be  
generated on the fly, and if so how do I add a new one?

mocs for core, gui and app are listed in the moc_sources.xcconfig  
file.  ui files for the app are listed automaticaly from the ui folder.

moc, ui and qrc files for providers/plugins are in each target's  
Generate Sources phase.

Ok, I'm making some progress getting TRUNK set up. Can you be more  
specific where to find where the moc files are specified for the  
plugins/providers? (If you haven't figured it out yet I'm a bit of an  
XCode idiot...))

Expand a provider/plugin target in the target list.  The Generate

Hi

Folks in order to have the very best version of QGIS in upcoming 9.0.4 release 
of Ubuntu, I have branched QGIS 1.0.1 tonight (a little earlier than planned).

This release is a bugfix release only.  If packagers could be so kind as to do 
their thing that would be great. 

The release can be checked out at:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_0_1


Thanks for your help all and apologies for the last minute shift of schedule. 
Bugfixing will continue in the stable branch towards the release of 1.0.2 in 
April.

The stable branch can be checked out from :

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Version-1_0

Note that all tickets open against 1.0.1 have been moved to 1.0.2. A summary 
of tickets closed in this release is available here:

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/milestone/Version 1.0.1

Many thanks and best regards,

Tim

In updating my Xcode project for 1.0.1, I noticed that  
QGIS_VERSION_INT is still 10000 (at the top of cmakelists.txt).   
Shouldn't this reflect the .1 version, since it's used for update  
checks?

Erk! You are quite correct! I have made the change in the branch and will 
ensure it is in the source bundles. Packagers please make sure you have at 
least r10177 as the basis for your packages.

My apologies for the oversight

Is it possible to generate the source tarballs and put them in their final
locations when the releases are ready to be built?  For Fedora, at least, I
prefer to build off of the final source tarball since it's easier to know that
I'm shipping the same code as qgis is.  Additionally, there are community
scripts that check that we're shipping the same code as upstream in our
packages that would most likely fail if I create my own tarball.

Hi William and Douglas

I will create the splash update and the source tarball tonight (about
4 or 5 hours from now).


Apologies for the hiccups....guess it doesnt pay to try to rush a
release out the door :-(

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <B5938989-6B0A-476D-A3F6-AEA903EC4AC3@me.com>

Carson,

I am trying to use the manageR plugin with qgis trunk. I believe I  
have the necessary dependencies in place, although I'm not sure if  
your plugin only works with rpy versus rpy2. I'm using the R 2.8.1  
binary for OS X.

Here is the output that I receive when I try to load a vector layer  
from qgis to R with the plugin:

An error has occured while executing Python code:

I propose we add William's Xcode project to the mac subdirectory of  
the source tree since there are at least two of us using it. It's a  
nice way to build a QGIS bundle...

Any comments/concerns?

Would it be possible for me to have commit access to svn to help  
maintain it, or at least get it going until other developers are  
comfortable with it?

It would be nice to add it to 1.0 when the project stabilizes.

Note: there are a couple internal files in the project bundle that are  
user-specific and shouldn't be added to svn.

Also, the reorganized layout of the app bundle should be OK'd.  And  
possibly mirrored in the cmake configuration, especially the  
Frameworks folder for the Qt frameworks, as this affects those who  
have Qt installed (loading Qt twice, Qt plugins cause trouble).

If/when the project is added to 1.0, I could leave the current layout  
for 1.0, in case there is a problem with the reorg layout.

Ok so r10177 has updated splash and web banner and the src tarball is here:

http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.0.1.tar.gz

checksum is here:

Gary,

If this gets added to svn, would you be willing to help detail the  
build instructions. I gave it a quick attempt yesterday, but gave up  
due to my lack of familiarity with XCode (I'm also using a newer  
version: 3.1.1). The developer instructions are useful, but seem to  
anticipate a level of experience with Apple's dev environment than  
many of us probably possess. It sounds like you were able to break  
through on that.

William: great job getting this working! I look forward to trying it  
out successfully.

Cheers,
John

Yeah, random notes in the developer readme.  needs much work.

I suppose I'm a bit terse in the main readme... that's mostly from the  
original readme when I played around with Xcode a couple years ago.   
At the time I guess I was assuming Xcode familiarity.

Suggestions for user-friendliness welcome.  One idea just occurred to  
me - a shell script to generate qgis_user.xcconfig.  I can use stuff  
from my build scripts for my frameworks.  Accepting defaults would  
really just make an empty file (Xcode complains if it's missing).  I  
should be able to get the different levels of configuration handled in  
a friendly way (those levels were meant to be friendly themselves, but  
require manual editing right now).

Now that I'm not rushing as much, I seem to be making some progress.  
If I can sort this out, I will try to take a stab at more detail. You

The main problem is sorting out silly things like how to properly add  
a source as a relative project to the Xcode project. I got past that  
one, but I'm not sure if the portion under "Adding core/gui/app moc  
sources" is necessary or not. That's where I'm at right now.

This is necessary, because of the convoluted nature of the generated  
sources.  Filling it out with reasoning is certainly a good idea.   
Short answer: Xcode needs _files_ in a target compile step, so  
generated sources need to be "pre-generated" to get the file  
reference.  I tried to do it with custom rules (moc, ui, qrc directly  
in the compile step), but Xcode wanted to re-compile them even when  
nothing changed.

I managed to get a build from trunk with one problem reported here:
http://rafb.net/p/a7vdJR82.html

I did not do anything with the core/gui/app moc sources myself, so I  
am assuming that the project automagically takes care of this issue.

A key to helping was Gary's suggestion to place the xcode project  
inside the mac folder within the trunk directory, i.e. 'sources/qgis/ 
trunk/mac/xcode. This allowed the sources to be found without having  
to load them into the project.

This is very useful. Thanks for the excellent work!

John

Yes, the userguide.pdf is missing from trunk.  The error shouldn't  
stop the build completing, but you can remove it from the project if  
you like.

Try the updated project I posted earlier this evening.  Some  
compilation issues fixed. release and trunk versions available.  But,  
your experience and comments with getting it working yourself are  
helpful.

I did see that email, and I used your trunk version for my build.

Another issue was my Qt setup. I have 4.4.3 installed from a Trolltech  
binary distribution. I had to go into qgis_settings.xcconfig and  
change the moc, rcc, and lrelease settings to /usr/bin/moc, etc.  
Although my installation has aliases for each of these in /Developer/ 
Tools/Qt, Xcode spit out an error related to moc before making these  
changes:

/Users/jctull/sources/qgis/trunk/mac/xcode/build/leo/Qgis.build/Debug/ 
moc.build/Script-729277F00F3A816100D9C992.sh: line 10: /Developer/ 
Applications/Qt/moc: No such file or directory

I changed all four references, and things then worked. Looking over  
things in more detail (and with a better understanding), I believe I  
needed to change QTDIR from /Developer/Applications/Qt to /Developer/ 
Tools/Qt in the qgis_user.xcconfig file. Is this correct (perhaps an  
oversight in your template)?

Cheers,
John

Odd... qgis_settings has it as /Developer/Tools/Qt, qgis_user-template  
has /Developer/Applications/Qt - oops.  But if you leave it commented  
in your qgis_user.xcconfig, it should use the qgis_settings value.   
You don't need to uncomment anything in your qgis_user.xcconfig unless  
you want to change a value.

But yes, changing QTDIR is all that's needed.  The name QTDIR is a  
holdover from older versions of Qt built from source.  QTBIN is a  
better name for it.

Hi

A big +1 from me for adding the xcode project to svn. I'm busy
installing xcode here - cant wait to try out your work. I am
particularly interested in trying out some of the profiling tools that
I believe are in the newer xcode releases.

Regards

Tim

Hi

Please provide more info:

 - what programming language you are using
 - what you have already tried
 - do you want to make these changes at compile time or run time?
 etc.

Assuming that you are using c++ something like this should work from the 
plugin api:

qGisInterface->layerMenu()->hide();

(untested code above)

Hello,

Just for future reference purposes.

This is now corrected in trunk : no more segfault. I think the
correction is in changeset r10172

Many thanks to Peter for his support and correction

Hi,

I am using python for programming. I want to load quantum gis (run time)
without the menus and i also want to add my own menu.

I will try to implement what option you have told.

Message-ID: <20090218095310.GB7635@rigacci.org>

Today I uploaded new QGIS and GRASS packages
to the repository http://debian.gfoss.it/

Packages are:

 * QGIS 1.0.1
 * GRASS 6.3.0.1

Both for Debian Lenny i386 and amd64.

Thanks to Frankie P. Lovergine, the one who really
do the Debian packaging.

We hope to have GRASS 6.4 and GDAL ECW plugin (non-free) soon.

WARNING: yesterday I uploaded the same packages but with wrong
filenames (an hyphen instead of a tilde); those packages had a
20090216 timestamp in their names. Remove then manually, to allow
for automatic upgrade in the future.

Is there a change log available for 1.0.1?  The ChangeLog file has information
about 1.0.0 (although the date at the top reflects 2004).

Message-ID: <499C58BF.6040201@silfreed.net>

Trying to build qgis 1.0.1 on Fedora 11 which has qt4.5 I'm getting the
following error:

lrelease error: duplicate messages found in
'/builddir/build/BUILD/qgis_1.0.1/i18n/qgis_mn.ts'

when the following build command is issued:
Generating qgis_tr.qm
cd /builddir/build/BUILD/qgis_1.0.1/i18n && /usr/lib64/qt4/bin/lrelease
-verbose /builddir/build/BUILD/qgis_1.0.1/i18n/qgis_tr.ts -qm
/builddir/build/BUILD/qgis_1.0.1/i18n/qgis_tr.qm

Running this allows me to finish the build:

lupdate-qt4 -no-obsolete -ts i18n/*.ts

Maybe these files should be pruned before generating the tarball?

The tarball is generated by doing an svn export. Did you have similar problems 
with the last build for 1.0.0 ?

Hello list,

Fedora 11 was just recently upgraded to qt4.5 which, from what I understand,
is what added this new requirement.

Can you just use this for the changelog.

Version 1.0.1 'Kore'
** This is a bugfix release in the stable release series. See
**  https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=closed&milestone=Version+1 for

Hi Maxim,

> explain?

The basic idea is to use the GCP-derived transforms to show the same
viewport in the qgis main canvas and in the georefencer canvas.

Now that I have reread Maciek's posting, I am also not sure anymore
he described the same, so sorry if I confused you all :-)

What I have currently done is encapsulating the different parametrised
transform methods (linear, helmert, the gdal based polynomial/tps) and
associated parameter fitting in GeorefTransformer classes - this is mainly
some refactoring to avoid code duplication and special cases for the
different transforms. A GeorefTransformer instances provide methods to
fit parameters to the GCPs, and then can be used to transform
either the main canvas viewport into raster coordinates or vice versa, based
on this parametrisation. I want to add checkboxes which give you the option to
link the georeferencer viewport to the main viewport (and vice versa). 

This is very useful if you reference a raster to a data source in
the main canvas (e.g. when referencing a scanned street map against a 
road vector layer), and already have a good approximation of the final
transform. Often you only need to add local refinements to bring the residuals
down (especially if you using local interpolation methods like TPS, or a high 
order polynomial), and such linked viewports will aid immensly in finding
correspondencies faster.
The transformer classes are also useful to report residuals for the
choosen parametrisation.

Is this the repository at http://svn.gis-lab.info/qgis-gdal-georef/?

I am currently developing against qgis trunk. Should I update
to your repository?  I will unfortunatly have a larger patchset than
anticipated - but given the small codebase, merging wouldn't present a problem 
I guess (if/when this feature is up for inclusion).

Hope I clarified the idea a bit.

bye,

	Manuel

yep, it is much clearer now, we're basically discussing immediate
review of the results of rectification. This sounds good, though can
hit performance for large rasters.

I agree we need to make this feature switchable. I think you should better
update our svn and ask Magnus to patch trunk again with the whole deal. If you're going to
keep working on this I also suggest we move all our stuff from our svn to
QGIS trunk.

Anyway - great job. Now we need to take care of point prediction and
cross-correlations and it'll be perfect.

.... but i've some problems (maybe related to my platform OSX)
specially :

1 - tring to print a map in pdf using A4, all works as aspected
      while changing the map dimension to A3 or other size ... it  
print a "truncated map"
      using "save as image" i haven't problems, it respect the size  
and resoluction i chosed.
      see :

2 - How can i reset the map composer ?
       if i've a qgis project file .qgs ,  open it
       try to print a map ...  then close qgis, reopening the  
mapcomposer
       i can see that it don't start from an empty canvas ... so :
      how can i reset it, to use a fresh composer in the qgs file i  
saved ?
      (simply :  "don't save the project if you used mapcomposer  
first ???")

thanks for any help,

Massimo

Qgis links its libraries relative to Qgis on OSX.  Which means  
qgis_help must be adjusted with install_name_tool to point back  
further to the core library.

The scripts in the mac folder can take care of this, Tom would have  
more details.  Or you can try my new Xcode project (check my download  
page).  It includes all the bundling and install_name_tool stuff.

Guys do I understand correctly that with Manuels patch you will be able to 
click on a known place on a already georeferenced map in main canvas window 
and then in the corresponding place in the georegister window and it will use 
the main canvas windows coords for that point removing the need for manual 
entry of gcps? If so that will be great!

If you need help getting your work into SVN please dont hesitate to contact me 
- though I assume Magnus is your contact point on this which is great!

Hi Maxim, Hi Tim,

before eveybody gets their hope up - this is really a quite unspectular
feature, unfortuately not a real-time reprojection of the raster data
(although output-sensitive warping shouldn't be hard to implement). 
The patch just adds the ability to display the same viewport in the main
canvas and the georeferencer canvas (by using the transform estimated from
GCPs). Very similar to Aaron Racicot's RefMap plugin.

In fact, the georeferencer already supports getting the map coordinate
from the main canvas (add GCP, then choose "From Map") - my patch just aims 
at improving/accelerating the workflow when referencing against against a
layer in the main canvas.

I'll give a concrete use-case to illustrate this:

Suppose you have a scanned map you wish to georeference against a vector layer
(e.g. containing street networks). Also, you are lucky to have a
dual-head setup, so you open the georeferencer plugin on a separate screen, 
and open the vector layer in the main canvas. The map features a lat/long
grid or some easy recognisable features, allowing you to add a few GCPs
quickly. Tentatively warping the input and placing it as a backdrop to the
vector layer reveals that while is a good approximation, you will have to add
maybe 50 more GCPs to get acceptable agreement with the reference. 

So you start to roam the main canvas for recognizable correspondencies (now
aided by your backdrop) and quickly spot one. But in order to place a GCP,
you have to find the same location in the plugin canvas. After ten minutes
of zooming, panning and swearing, you see this little checkbox called 
"Link Current View to Main Canvas" *click* and the viewport magically
jumps to the location you see in the main canvas.

Hope anyone can relate :-) At least for me this is a real timesaver.

I have attached a work-in-progress patch (against SVN), just as a crude little 
demo with the following
caveats:

	-does not yet report if there are insufficient control points to estimate the 
      transform
	-helmert transform is currently broken (but very probably also the case for
      SVN)
	-UI is terrible
		-Can anyone suggest a better description than "Link Main Canvas To Current 
	      View"?
		-probably ought to place the various dialog elements in a tab widget
		 to preserve canvas real estate
	-No refactoring for the warping code yet, so some duplication in the
	 interest of a "small" patch

I hope you are still interested in getting this into SVN.

cheers,

	Manuel

Message-ID: <1235219725904-2363523.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hi,

I just wanted to report that I was unable to load any postgis layers in the
QGis 1.0.1 binaries downloaded from http://www.kyngchaos.com. I can connect
to the postgis database that I was successfully using for QGis 1.0.0 and see
all the layers. But, when I connect I get

<layer name> =sql is an invalid layer and cannot be loaded

I am running with postgresql 8.3.5 and postgis 1.3.5. When I reverted back
to QGis 1.0.0 I can again load the postgis layers?

Any ideas?

Cheers,
Max

Message-ID: <D995F951-0FB7-4CFF-B93D-7F9F79C3FF89@mrcc.com>

I have created a web-based tool to build a minimal QGIS Python plugin.

Basically you specify the required parameters and it creates a ready  
to run plugin with an blank dialog. The tool compiles the resource and  
Ui files and packages it all up into a zip file for download.

You can try the builder at: http://pyqgis.org/builder/plugin_builder.py

The zip file contains a Makefile which can be used to recompile the Ui  
and resource files if you change them. The builder uses Qt 4.4,  
however the generated plugin should work on any QGIS 1.0 install.

If you've been wanting to develop QGIS plugins but didn't know where  
to start, this tool can get you started quickly by setting up the  
structure for you.

Comments and suggestions are welcomed.

My zip file didn't have a Makefile with it...

http://pyqgis.org/built_plugins/fnord.zip

Also, the fnordDialog.py file still has a comment relating to 'Zoom to
point' in it, which I guess is a hangover from your template plugin.
Needs substituting with the string from the web form.

Neat though.

 Of course!

 I also notice my output files are automatically GPL v2.  You could
add an option on the web form "[ ] Include License Text Note for [GPL

I see that the above hostel only has multiple room sharing. I am 
currently looking at a double room (two twin beds) at the Mercure for 
approximately 58 Euro per night, which I think is actually cheaper than 
the above hostel if divided between two people. Anyone interested?

If I don't hear back from anyone by tomorrow, I think I'll go ahead a 
book this room anyway though...

Hi Gary,

it works really fine now, thanks for that!

But your site is very helpful for prospectiv python-developers I think!

Unfortunately I wasn't that successful so far. Is there anybody who works

Hi list,

I customize the first tutorial of Tim Sotton's blog so that it almost
works under windows. I fixed every problem during cmake (a big problem
were the paths with their "\" and "/"), but now I am stucked in the make
process, which throws a huge list of errors which I can't solve on my own.
I already checked the paths and the dependings - they seem to be correct.
I hope that anyone of you can help me with that!?

Best regards,
Florian

What's the problem?  Did you test your setup by building QGIS?
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingFromSource

QGIS comes with a bunch of plugins, which can serve as examples.

Message-ID: <31f1d37d0902221320g606b46faj4ce32cc518dcea94@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to alls!!
I've realized a simple plugin to display data from postgres DB and draw maps
from postgis layers. Here a little movie of my
plugin<http://pyarchinit.altervista.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=34&Itemid=57>
.
Now I want display on my GUI only the data selected on canvas.
I've tried some functions of QqisVectorLayer but I don't understand how to
realize my goal.

Somes suggestions?? What classes or examples I must to study?

Thank you very much!!

Yes, permanently. There's a similar function in ftools now.

Hi, Hillen.

It seems you should add qgis_core and qgis_gui libraries to 
CMakeLists.txt, try this:
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(georefplugin
    qgis_core
    qgis_gui
)
or
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(timtut1
  ${QGIS_CORE_LIBRARY} 
  ${QGIS_GUI_LIBRARY}
)

Hi Jack R,

thanks for the answer.
I have something like that in the CMakeLists.txt:

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(timtut1
  ${QT_LIBRARIES}
  ${QGIS_CORE_LIBRARY}
  ${QGIS_GUI_LIBRARY}
  ${GEOS_LIBRARY}
  ${GDAL_LIBRARY}
)

The path to qgis-core and qgis-gui are valid (if I believe the cmakesetup
gui).
Do you have any other idea?

Thank again.

Florian

Great work and very very helpful for plugin developement. 

I found out one issue in conjunction with QT-Designer. When I open the
generated *.ui file with QT-Designer and save the file then the
UI-Classname is not set correct. P.e. when you call a class myTestClass
you will get a UI_myTestClass.ui with the corresponding class name. Open
the file with QT-Designer add a push button and save the dialog, the
dialog class is renamed in UI_Dialog but not the file of course. As the
result the plugin throws an error message "class not found". To solve
the problem you have to rename the dialog inside of QT-Designer from
Dialog to your desired class name.

Horst

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] New Plugin builder

I have created a web-based tool to build a minimal QGIS Python plugin.

Basically you specify the required parameters and it creates a ready  
to run plugin with an blank dialog. The tool compiles the resource and  
Ui files and packages it all up into a zip file for download.

You can try the builder at: http://pyqgis.org/builder/plugin_builder.py

The zip file contains a Makefile which can be used to recompile the Ui  
and resource files if you change them. The builder uses Qt 4.4,  
however the generated plugin should work on any QGIS 1.0 install.

If you've been wanting to develop QGIS plugins but didn't know where  
to start, this tool can get you started quickly by setting up the  
structure for you.

Comments and suggestions are welcomed.

Hey Richard,

thanks for the link, that's pretty extensive, you're right.
I'll still try to succeed with my environment, but I'll try that next.
Hopefully everything works out with the newest versions - I will see :)

Thanks again for your help!

Best regards,
Florian

Hi!

I've also already booked a room (thanks to Otto for his tip with 
http://www.studenten-wg.de/)
But currently I'm still waiting for confirmation..
If noone confirms my request for sure I'll probably also try the hostel..

An oversite in the template that generates the Ui file. It should be

Message-ID: <49A347C2.4060409@wildintellect.com>

Case and point as I mentioned the other day. Sometime the debs are
missing important things between upgrades.
I did an upgrade from 1.0 to 1.0.1 via the launchpad ppa repo.

python-qgis-common was not selected since it was a new package and
python-qgis did not have a dep to pull it.

The result was I didn't have the python plugin installer on my system
and had no idea why since all my previously installed plugins were still
there and the python console too.

Note for the future, if you end up splitting a package when people do
upgrades you need to pull the new packages too or at least add the
recommend so the user sees it, and properly remove all the old
ones(didn't always happen in the past). Otherwise the end user just
get's quite confused.

Thanks,
Alex

For those that didn't notice, I added the OSX Xcode project to trunk  
this weekend.  Build works.  Needs work on developer docs, for project  
maintenance.  I'll work on making the build docs easier to understand,  
and simplifying parts of the configuration.

It's in a "v2.4 compatible" format, so it should theoretically work on  
Xcode 2.4.  This makes Tiger (OSX 10.4) the minimum for building Qgis  
from the project (but Qt 4.4 requires gcc 4 to build on OSX, so  
Panther's not an option anyways, unless you're very adventurous).   
I'll test Xcode 2.5 when I get a chance.

William,

Will this work with Qt 4.5? I tried last week but hit some snags. I'm  
not sure if there is a configuration setting to change, or if it is  
more complicated than that.

Ok, now I've actually tried again to build using your latest svn code.  
I was hoping to report the error I was having last week, but now I  
have a ccache error cropping up repeatedly:

error: can't exec '/Developer/Library/Xcode/Plug-ins/GCC 4.0.xcplugin/ 
Contents/Resources/ccache gcc' (No such file or directory)

Any ideas on how to circumvent this problem?

Thanks,
John

I don't know about Qt 4.5 compatibility with Qgis.  I haven't tried  
it, so I can't say if there are some subtle installation changes in Qt  
4.5 that would cause problems in the project.  A quick pre-install  
look at Qt 4.5 shows a couple new frameworks, maybe there's some new  
inter-linking going on?

Sounds like something seriously wrong with your Xcode installation.  I  
don't have a "ccache" in my installation, so something is mistakenly  
trying to find it there. In fact, I can't find a ccache anywhere on my  
drive.  Which target is the error in?

William,

The ccache error is triggered in everything that is trying to be  
built, but I worked around the problem. I had manually installed  
ccache (http://ccache.samba.org/), so I disabled it (I had set  
CC='ccache gcc' in my profile, so unset this). All builds now.

Back to the compile... Using qt-4.5, everything builds and runs. These  
are the errors that I received using the latest source. We already  
covered them in emails last week and know that they relate to the help  
manual:

Ah, dangerous to mess around with CC/CXX in Xcode.  Is that set in  
your ~/.bash_profile?  That one isn't loaded by Xcode, but maybe  
others are (.profile, /etc/profile, ...).  Try setting CC=ccache in  
~/.bash_profile so it's only available in Terminal.

... grepping 'error' can take them out of context.  And I don't see  
any errors there anyways, just files with 'error' in their name, so  
you're good!  (I removed the manual pdf from the app target, until  
it's updated and added back to the source.)

Hi,

Just wanted to let you know that my changes are available via git
for the time being. Repository is accessible at:

	git://github.com/mmassing/georeferencer.git

I am tracking gislab and qgis svn, and currently developing
on the WARP_REFACTORING branch 
(http://github.com/mmassing/georeferencer/tree/WARP_REFACTORING)

Changes:
	-merge with gislab svn
	-fixed helmert transform and warp
	-fixed linear world file generation (was dead code for linear)
	-Unified warping implementation: removes a lot of code duplication

TODO:
	- better UI for map follow mode
	- Add cubic spline, lanczos to interpolation schemes

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Support for south oriented TM projection
Message-ID: <1fef7d9b0902250617l3fdf7b2axc3b11b3a8af4854e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Devs

My company is interested in funding support for south oriented
transverse mercator in PROJ.4, GDAL and OGR. The main motivation for
this is to have this functionality available in QGIS. My question is
this: Will the current development version of QGIS handle the new
functionality available through gdal and friends or should I be
budgeting for some QGIS dev time to have this functionality added to
my favourite desktop GIS?

Regards,

Craig Leat

Should I file this as a bug?  I don't know if this could be integrated into
any i18n build scripts so that others don't get hit by this problem with qt
4.5 ships for their distros.

It looks like this deletes old duplicate translations, but I'm not very well
versed in i18n things.

I think my version that worked was with rpy1, not 2. You should be  
able to do library(rgdal) in R to see if it is loading properly.  
Something like this should show up in the R console:
 > library(rgdal)
Loading required package: sp
Geospatial Data Abstraction Library extensions to R successfully loaded
Loaded GDAL runtime: GDAL 1.6.0, released 2008/12/04
Path to GDAL shared files: /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/ 
1.6/Resources/gdal
Loaded PROJ.4 runtime: Rel. 4.6.1, 21 August 2008
Path to PROJ.4 shared files: (autodetected)

It might be worth trying an older R binary, not 2.8.x. Perhaps the R  
update breaks something.

Cheers,
John

Example 1 and 2 give this same error to me. What is a different between
vectorType() and geometryType()? For your info,i'm using QGis 1.0 and run on
Windows platform. Please help me,i'm new to QGis.


Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python bindings for composer
Message-ID: <04DA676AA276F045B32D0F95783D78449487D8@EX6.d.ethz.ch>

Hi QGIS devs

I'd like to make Python bindings for the composer classes such that it is possible for plugins to automatically create and place items on the composer. I already did some tests about it (accidental commit yesterday :-( ) 

With the bindings for composer classes it should be possible to place QActions defined in Python plugins into the composer toolbar.
Therefore I propose the following additional function into the plugin interface (QgisInterface):

QList< QPair <QMainWindow*, QgsComposerView*> > composerList()

Like this, plugins can add gui elements to the main composer window and add items to the composer view. Not exposed is the class QgsComposer as that class manages the composer input widgets and I don't like to expose them to the plugin interface. It is a list because it is planned to allow several composer instances per projects in the future.

The following additional classes would be visible from plugins:

core:
QgsComposerItem, QgsComposerLabel, QgsComposerMap, QgsComposerPicture, QgsComposerScaleBar, QgsComposition, QgsLegendModel, QgsPaperItem, QgsScaleBarStyle

gui:
QgsComposerView

Let me know what you think about this or if you see better ways to expose print composer classes.

Regards,
Marco

First of all I would recommend you to add signals to QgisApp that will
announce newly created (and maybe also closed) composers. Otherwise
plugins willing to add some new features to composer(s) would have to
poll for list of composers to find new ones.

Additionally, I think using a pair of composer window and composer
view for the list is a bit redundant... isn't composer view a child of
the composer window? If so, plugins could just ask for parent and cast
it to QMainWindow. Otherwise I'm affraid we would have to add a
wrapper for QList< QPair<T1*, T2*> >. Nothing really hard but better
to avoid it.

Looks fine. I would have liked more if all classes were starting with
QgsComposer prefix, but I guess they're already a part of v1.0 API, so
there's not much we could do with it.

Btw. if you had some time, it would be really great if you could put
on wiki some simple examples ("recipes") for composer, e.g.:
- load a template and print the map
- put some composer items to the composition (and save as a template)
Prefferably in Python :-)

Agreed. I'm going to do this as soon as there is the possibility of having several composers

There are some more objects in between. The parent of QgsComposerView is mViewFrame, the parent of that mSplitter, the parent of that is centralwidget and the parent of that finally is the composer. So it would be possible to call parent()->parent()->parent()->parent() and cast that. But then someone might change the ui elements in designer and all the composer plugins would not work any more.

I already wrote a wrapper for QList< QPair<T1*, T2*> > today for the direction C++ to Python and it seems to work.

Yes, this is an important point (that people unfortunately usually forget to do). Which section is the right place for this? Probably a new page under 'Help on writing plugins' ?

Alternatively you could add a method to QgsComposerView that would
return pointer to its main window to avoid the need of QPair.
And maybe I would change the name of the function for qgis interface
from composerList() to activeComposers() but that's just a matter of
taste :)

It think the best would be to add a completely new page, something
like Coding Recipes or Developer's Cookbook that would list the
examples, each topic (geometries, vectors, rasters, rendering,
composer, ...) on a separate subpage. Then I would also like to
migrate much of the contents from PythonBindings page there
(PythonBindings has been originally created to record status and
compilation of pyQGIS, however now it contains mostly useful code
snippets).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQT4 binaries for OSX?
Message-ID: <49A704AD.6080406@carto.net>

Hi QGIS Mac developers,

I am still struggeling with my OSX deployment problems of PyQT based 
QGIS plugins (mainly QtSQL related) ... I am wondering if there are 
PyQT4 binaries available somewhere for download? The Riverbank PyQT 
website only offers binaries for Windows. There seem to be binaries 
PyQTMac  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt-mac/) - but the last 
update is from 2005 and thats not likely to contain QT 4.4 ...

Any hints would be most welcome.

Thanks,
Andreas

The Qgis install document, OSX section has compile instructions for  
SIP and PyQt.  It's simple.

There are a couple different combinations possible for a PyQt install  
(whether to use system python or python.org python), so packaging  
binaries would be a bit tricky (much like what I do - spearate Tiger  
and Leopard binaries).  Those old binaries from 2005 could get away  
with a single binary package because there was no Leopard with it's  
usable system Python.

Thanks for the hint. I'll give it a try. Currently I only care about
Intel-Macs with Leopard.

Dave,

I built it myself. But i got some errors while compiling so i made the patch 
(i has attached it maybe it will be useful). I suggest there is a problem in 
capability with libGL. Because when i built OSSIM, OSSIMPlanet and examples 
under Sabayon they works fine (libGL was later).

That sounds good. I'm going to add that method to QgsComposerView.

pressing keys (Alt + 5) together you should be able to click on the properties

Sandro, please let Gary know your OSGeo ID?
I think this would be a great addition to QGIS, so I would vote for
granting SVN access to Sandro.

Message-ID: <27475.193.246.86.39.1235739948.squirrel@webmail.carto.net>

Hi,

I am writing a PyQGIS plugin where I am using an editable QTableView. Some
of the columns should be editable, but some should be read-only (e.g. the
primary key column, or an automatically updated area or length column).

I didn't find a convenient way to set a single column read-only. Googling
for this topic led me to some posts from 2006 suggesting that I should
step through individual cells and set flags.

In Qt3 there was a convenient method
QTableView.setColumnReadOnly(colIndex,True) - but in qt4 this method is
gone ;-(

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQT: how to set a column of QTableView read-only

I define a method like this in the table model:
    def flags(self, idx):
         baseflags = QAbstractTableModel.flags(self, idx)
         if idx.column() == COL_CLASS:
             return baseflags | Qt.ItemIsEditable
         else:
             return baseflags

Ok, the bindings are in trunk now.

Btw. what about having a menu bar for the composer main window? I remember there was a discussion about this some time ago but I cannot remember what the arguments against were.

Regards,
Marco

That sounds good. I'm going to add that method to QgsComposerView. 

cheers,

The parent of QgsComposerView is mViewFrame, the parent of that mSplitter, the parent of that is centralwidget and the parent of that finally is the composer. So it would be possible to call parent()->parent()->parent()->parent() and cast that. But then someone might change the ui elements in designer and all the composer plugins would not work any more.

Alternatively you could add a method to QgsComposerView that would
return pointer to its main window to avoid the need of QPair.
And maybe I would change the name of the function for qgis interface
from composerList() to activeComposers() but that's just a matter of
taste :)

It think the best would be to add a completely new page, something
like Coding Recipes or Developer's Cookbook that would list the
examples, each topic (geometries, vectors, rasters, rendering,
composer, ...) on a separate subpage. Then I would also like to
migrate much of the contents from PythonBindings page there
(PythonBindings has been originally created to record status and
compilation of pyQGIS, however now it contains mostly useful code
snippets).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Many symbols in the same layer
Message-ID: <601102.68404.qm@web24202.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi QGIS devs

I'm developping a gis application with the pyqgis extension and I have some problems in docs so I hope you will help me
I want to make different symbols in the same layer,I found this while using Qgis but there is no code which explains how could I do this. There are classes that could be generated with qgis.I just want an example doing this with Python or C++

I wish you understand my problem
Thank you in advance

Hi Ahmed

You can do so by using a subclass of QgsRenderer and adding different symbols (QgsSymbol) to it. E.g. you may use QgsGraduatedSymbolRenderer to classify the features based upon attribute value ranges. There is a subclass of QgsRenderer for every option displayed in the GUI element of  vector properties -> symbology -> legend type. Then you add your renderer to the vector layer using the method 'setRenderer' of the vector layer class.

Regards,
Marco
