After building from source (qgis 2.3 checked out yesterday), following
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html#toc3
I try to start qgis from comand line, but on comand line I get
./qgis: symbol lookup error: ./qgis: undefined symbol:
_ZN17QgsLayerTreeGroup16staticMetaObjectE

This happens with a local build/ installation, while there is another
system wide installation of qgis. I use Linux Mint 13.

Any suggestions what to do? Thanks
Daniel

Hi Daniel,

You probably didn't set LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5859

You may also run from the build directory:
./output/bin/qgis

Best,
Matthias

Thanks Matthias, removing the system installation and setting
LD_LIBRARY_PATH solved the issue. But now I have the already known problem:

During start of QGIS I get a Python error "Couldn't load plugin
'processing' [...]" and after a message "Unable to load GdalTools
plugin. The required "osgeo [python-gdal]" module is missing.". However,
QGIS starts and in the plugin manager with GdalTools everything seems to
be ok, whereas processing plugin is marked broken and the reinstall
button is disabled.

Any suggestions what to do? Daniel

I attach the full python error.

Hi,

My plugin http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/simplipy/ has the tag "This

Thanks

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FjqKjgKzrFduSDdKtNt06TTndoRtZJ5fqi7Btx5EwHP0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a project with Spatialite and Shapefile layers and I found that
it's around 7times slower to render in the current test version than
in 2.2.

The project is online, so you can try it yourself:
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bwc-5JFVTnfIZkZOM3Y0Um9jOHc&usp=sharing

I've tried different rendering options including parallel rendering
but found no way to improve the rendering speed in Testing.

I'd love to know if it's a general problem or if I have misconfigured something.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi !

Similar (or same ?) issue reported on my layerCombination's issue tracker :
https://github.com/olivierdalang/layerCombinations/issues/16

Do your users by any chance use it ?

I haven't experienced the bug myself neither though... And haven't looked
at it yet.

Best,

Olivier

My students did the same? but it was because they had choosen ?Move item content? [cid:image001.png at 01CF7DB2.B21D0250] instead of ?Select/move item?. I was frustrated, because I couldn?t find the ?error?.
Can it be the same?

Hi Anita,

here in my testing Windows VM I does not see any appreciable
difference between 2.2 and master. How did you measured the
differences?

cheers!

very nice both sets of scripts! why not adding them into processing?

Hi all,
Sorry for the delay.

*Weekly Report 2*

*What was done this week?*

   - There is exampleprovider
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/plugins/processing/exampleprovider>
which
   is available in the Processing plugin
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/plugins/processing> as
   an example plugin to add algorithms to the Processing framework. This will
   be used as a base.

   - Have added the functionality for simplification using
   QgsTopologyPreservingSimplifier function in the above mentioned example
   plugin. Code can be found at this link </>

   - But this alone is incomplete/insufficient for simplification as there
   is a need to do pre-processing otherwise the output won't be as desired.


*What is the plan for next week?*

   - In the coming week I'll be tweaking with the models given in
   processing toolbox and using the algorithms already in it will implement
   proper pre-processing steps in the plug-in.


*Wiki page : *http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/nishithm

*Code repository : *https://github.com/nishithm/schematization

I have just added a busy indicator to the status bar when map canvas
is being refreshed - I hope that will help.

I am not sure to understand how is it different from the way DB manager
does with a query, i.e. opening a layer and passing a query as the table
name ?
I mean, AFAIK, it's always executed at the provider level, isn't it ?

Yes it is, however there isn't a generic interface for the providers to do
it, and that feels like a bit of a hack to me. And you also have to handles
escaping, and all that messy stuff.  Better to have a explicit method that
handles all the extra logic.

In my mind, we must not disturb the current way of loading data.

Using the SQL dialect of SQLite/Spatialite could allow to add powerful
features to poor data formats (shapefiles, csv, etc.)
But as discussed, it should not be considered as the unifiying SQL for
all SQL dialects (it is less powerful).
However, you could use it to offer a unifying view on a set of data
sources, including other DBRMS, if you really want to.

As discussed elsewhere
(http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Postgis-Caching-Enhancement-td5132383.html),
SQLite could also be used for caching. Not sure yet how it could be
mixed with the virtual table feature ...

Message-ID: <CALuHMPC83=AssD_zVw0iYn84Qjxqtxu0D-vtCV6xsnyqXkLO5A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I found that we have some plugins in plugin repository that doesn't follow
repository requirements but were approved by plugin site admins. For
example:
 - Cxf_in (non English description and UI)
 - geovallecvc (non English description and UI)
 - vectorGeoref (non English UI)

Maybe there are more.

I think we should change policy about plugins: lift some requirements that
doesn't affect plugin usability (e.g. requirement for plugin
repository can be not
mandatory) and make more strict requirements that directly affects plugin
usage.

>From user point of view plugin without information about repository is
still useable and can be used without any problems. While plugin that
doesn't have English UI is completely unusable if you don't know language
used by plugin author.

Also I propose to ask authors of mentioned plugins to add English UI ASAP
and unapprove plugins after some time if this is not done.

Hi all

Victor, thanks for your review, I will modify the scripts as soon as
possible.

Sharing scripts raises some questions :

* How can we categorize the scripts to help the users find one particular
among the many potential scripts that will be shared ? The "group" can
help, but any script writer can at present use the group he wants to. For
example, I used "3liz - Database" or "3liz - Vector", etc which makes sense
for me, but surely not for other users.

* How do we assure that the user has got the last version of each script ?
As proposed before, I think some "git magic" could help.

* Because it is more easy to create or modifiy, I usually create "scripts".
We could on the contrary "force" people who share scripts to use the
capability of Processing to integrate external algo via "provider". This
supposes to create a plugin for a set of scripts, which is more
complicated. But this would answer some of the questions above, for example
"how do we update the scripts", because QGIS plugin architecture would do
the job. I would also allow the user to temporarilly disable a set of
script (by disabling the corresponding plugin).

IMHO we should not add more plugins for sharing scripts, but instead use
the same architecture : we could have a new Processing sub-menu
"Manage/Install external scripts and models" which would show a similar
interface as the plugin manager, and similar features : tagging, vote,
categories, descriptions, etc.

I confess sharing my scripts had a double objective :
* share them :)
* begin a discussion about the future workflow to share scripts and
algorithms.

Cheers
Michael

Asking would be a good thing.

I'm not so sure about unapproving, as the plugin might still be perfectly
usable, the developer might not be able to translate it to English or the
plugin might have only local application and translating it might be of limited
value.

And English description should be feasible for anyone - at least something that
describes why there is no localization.  But IMHO the author should be open for
contribution - if anyone else wants to help with localization that.

Message-ID: <CAC2XbFfT56uCE+RLg3fiTOQbJUiCGt4dSc9EoncpnADOdf9tkA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have just found out there is a plugin "Vgi2Shp" in QGIS plugin
repository, all of its functionality is in a .pyc file - compiled
python module, with no source code (.py). Also the code repository on
GitHub is completely empty. I believe this is not allowed under the
terms of GNU GPL - and probably we do not want to allow such code in
the repository (basically it is an opaque binary blob). What are your
opinions?

I think we could create a list of unwanted python extensions which
should not be allowed, e.g.:
- .pyc (compiled .py)
- .pyo (optimized .pyc)
- .pyd (compiled module)

It is clear that this cannot serve as a real security measure as it is
easy for malicious code to work that around anyway - I think it should
be merely a warning to the developers that they may be doing something
wrong. (Packaging a .pyc file is normally useless and just inflates
package size - the .pyc will be created automatically by the
interpreter).

The question is whether to allow also other binary executables /
libraries, such as:
- .exe
- .dll
- .bat
- .com
- .scr (windows screensaver - same as .exe)
- .so

Thanks for all the great work.

When adding a new layer, the behaviour used to be that the new layer was
placed on top of the active layer. It is not the case anymore if I am
correct.

When passing a list of layers in a certain order to
QgsMapCanvas::setLayerSet(), the obtained order seems random (from
Python). Is it wanted ? (not sure if it was already the case before your
changes)

Is there a way to modify the order of layers in the legend (and in the
rendering) via the Python API ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Query layers are bad layers when empty
Message-ID: <CAExk7p2aUPABvB96SEZDsdME8TbEMiM6NDCrns4_rO2F+=-VFA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

I love the "query layer" feature !

But there's something which makes it unusable : as soon as it returns an
empty result set (which is absolutely valid), it is considered as a "bad
layer" upon file opening, and the layer is destroyed.

When working with spatialite, it triggers the "handle bad layers dialog",
which unfortunately is of no help.
When working with postgis, it shortly displays a message in the message
bar, which I sometimes miss, and I also loose my layers.


Here's what I found so far :

- when "filtering" a regular spatialite/postgis layer, if the filter
filters out every feature, the layer is still valid. (works as expected)
- when a query layer returns an empty result set, the layer is considered
bad (unexpected).
- when a query layer returns an non-empty result set, but the query layer
is filtered, the layer is considered bad (unexpected).
- empty views work well, filtered or not (works as expected)

So, views are a kind of workaround, but depending on the needs (for example
if you need to change your query very often), it's not really usable
either, because it's much longer to setup and it pollutes the database.


Does anyone have a workaround for this ? Why does QGIS have to consider
empty query layers as invalid, while they work perfectly well (as long as
you don't reopen the file) ?


I would definitely create a blocker issue for this (there are already
linked issues, see below, but it seems they aren't considered as blockers)
: it leads to loosing query layers very easily (and almost silently for
postgis). It would be great if this could be fixed for 2.4 !

Thanks for reading !

Olivier

Works for me exactly as expected - new layer is placed on top of the
active layer.

I am not sure if I understand what you mean.... order obtained from
where? from map canvas?

Not yet, I am about to add python bindings very soon (tomorrow probably).

Hi,
I was out for holidays.
Ok Tim, I will follow your suggestion ;)
I will split only the lines belonging to the same layer, unlike polygons'
avoid intersections which operate on all the layers having the option
turned on.

I agree that action seems odd. Maybe you accidentally got hit by a
recent audit. Your plugin does not appear to violate any of the rules
though.

Thanks for reporting, hopefully one of the repo managers will read this

Agreed:
+1 for asking (I'm doing it for new plugins)
-1 for making EN compulsory
+1 for asking a code repo: without it it is difficult to cooperate on a plugin,
including providing a translation; adding a repo is a matter of 5 min, I see no
reason why an author should avoid it.

All the best.

I had the same problem with the OpenLayers plugin some time ago. As far as I 
remember it was solved after removing "deprecated=False" from metadata.txt.

Thanks Marting for pointing this out. This is also mentioned in the updated guidelines.
During my approval process I regularly check the above, so I believe somebody else
approved the plugin you mentioned.
Of course an hard constraint on the Django application would be preferable.

BTW, I now cannot switch between
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/Vgi2ShpConverter/#plugin-details
and
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/Vgi2ShpConverter/#plugin-versions
etc.: anything wrong with the application?
All the best.

I have just uploaded a first version of a tool to manage Processing
resources (basically models and scripts)

You will find tools named "Get scripts/models from on-line repository" in
the scripts and models branches of the toolbox. They open a dialog where
you can select the elements to install/uninstall, similar to the plugin
manager

Scripts and models are stored in a repo named QGIS-Processing under the
QGIS organization. I recommend all people with scripts/models that they
want to share, to make pull requests against that repo.

I have added the scripts by Michael and Vincent there, to add some intitial
content (I haven't added any model yet). Please, let me know if you do not
want them to be shared there.

There is a list.txt with some info about the resources available. It's
created automatically by running the create_lists.py script, and it acts
like an easy to retrieve index, so there is no need to browse all the
content and extract metadata from the help files.

In the help files, there is now a ALG_VERSION element to indicate a
version, which is 1.0 if it is not provided. That allows the interface to
know if a script/model is up to date or not.

Notice that the format for help files is now json. That solves the issue
that some people reported, cause by trying to unpickle the help
description. I have converted the help files for the scripts that I added
to the repo, using the help_converter.py script. Feel free to use it for
your own scripts if needed (I might remove it from this repo, since i a not
sure it belongs here...maybe better put it as a gist)

Things to discuss from now: How do we classify the algorithms? How do we
allow people to add new scripts? The pull request mechanism might be too
complex for some people, and the GitHub API allows to add a new file and a
comit to a repo, so we can probably simplify it.

Ideas are welcome. This is just a first try done in a couple of nights so
there is plenty of room for improvement.

Thanks in advance!

Ah on this topic I dont know if we mentioned it in Vienna when you were
gathering requirements, but one thing I *often* get asked by users is why
when adding new layers (multiple at once) QGIS does not add them in
'natural z-order' with polygons below then lines in the middle, then points
above. Is this something you could do? I believe sorting should only apply
to the added layers (so adding the sorted layer above the current layer
rather than above the last layer of their geometry type). Though no doubt
somebody will think just the opposite....:-)

I will need to recompile QGIS to test this new feature. Hopefully I will
have time at the end of the week.

I fully agree to have my scripts shared in this repository. You should
probably add a licence file (and a message in the readme) announcing all
the scripts in this repository are GPL V2. Thank you for having already
added them there.

Thank you for converting the help files. I think you could keep the
converter here for a while, since it does not harm ;)   Or add a link to
the future gist in the README so that people can easily find it when using
QGIS-Processing repository.

I think someone must review the scripts put in this new repository, since
it is the "official" QGIS sharing script repo. Pull requests are good for
this. This way some checking could be done by the reviewer :
* the category could be checked among a pre-defined required list (to be
defined)
* the script must have a complete help file to be accepted
* the script should not duplicate an existing script (if so better improve
the existing script which does the same)
etc.

Another idea then ;)
It could be handy to be able to add other repositories, as we can for
plugins. This way anyone can have its own script repository , and share
some of the script when wanted. The script writers and the end users will
have the choice to add some repositories.

Although in principle nice, I think this can prove problematic. For Python plugins we
reverted to one centralized repo, to have more consistency and predictability.

Thanks Victor (and kimaidou), amazing! A long standing wish fulfilled.

I?m ok to share my scripts in the official repository (and thanks a lot for it).

In a previous mail, Victor Olaya encouraged the use of progress.setInfo instead of progress.setText and of GeoAlgorithmExecutionException. There may also be some other new programming tools available + some best practices. How late is the documentation and what could be done ?

Hi Martin,

We can add a rule in the validator.py to generate a warning when a
blacklisted extension is in the package. Checking if for each .pyc there is
also a .py is a bit more complicated but  also  possible.

Hello,

Is it possible to pass any parameters to script which I want to run by 
using --code option of qgis (qgis.bat on windows)?

Now I've managed to use temporary parameter file which I write by bat 
script and then I read it from my script in QGIS, but this is not elegant.

Do you know any better solution?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Editing groups of layers / edit buffer /
	transactions
Message-ID: <538D9A5B.6060309@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs

In the QGEP project (https://github.com/qgep/QGEP), we are trying to 
create a waste water application module based on PostgreSQL and QGIS. 
Other examples of application modules are GIS based solutions for water, 
electicity, gas, ... So what I'm describing here is valid for a large 
number of GIS based applications.

In an application module, there is usually a complex database schema 
consisting of many tables, views, triggers, foreign keys, constraints, 
sql functions. We found, that it is very difficult to do editing with 
the standard QGIS tools. In QGIS, we have an isolated edit buffer per 
layer. Once editing is stopped, the edits of a layer are commited to the 
datasource. For normal edit tasks, this is a great thing. However with 
many relations between the layers, it is almost impossile to work 
without triggering a lot of constraint violations in the database. Also 
adding or removing an object is usually done with sql functions, because 
it means changes to a lot of tables. In QGEP, we would more like to work 
within a database transaction and commit / rollback a series of changes 
at once (after all, a database snapshot can be seen as an edit buffer on 
database side).

A possibility to cope with such a special editing situation is to bypass 
the edit buffer in QGIS and redirect all the read/write access of the 
involved database providers through one connection (but only if this 
mode is activated e.g. by a plugin, normally edit buffer and providers 
will behave like now). I've submitted a pull request about that topic 
and there was quite a long discussion about it, but without a clear 
result. Therefore I'd like to discuss in a broader context (and 
separated from any implementation issues) the idea of bypassing the edit 
buffer (in special situations) and using a backend mechanism instead 
(e.g. db transactions).

What are your opinions?

Regards,
Marco

This is exactly for which I made the DataDrivenInputMask plugin 
(https://github.com/bstroebl/DataDrivenInputMask). The automatically 
created mask takes care of NotNull and foreign key constraints. 
Sometimes additional triggers are needed to ensure data consistency, though.

I faced the same problem and decided on using the edit buffer but 
immediately commit when the user clicks OK, which is suboptimal as data 
in related tables (n:m relations) are commited although the user cancels 
the main mask. The transaction approach would get around this 
limitation. A general problem is that you are not able to enter data in 
a related table for new features, altough there might be work-arounds 
with sequences and transactions (I did not look into that).

Would this be in api, only available to users through plugins? So why 
not. It would be the responsibility of the plugin developer to ensure 
the correct succession of the statements in order to not violate any 
constraints.

Thanks for your feedback. I'll check a second windows machine, maybe I
just screwed up something on the Win8 machine to cause these huge

Maybe you could send me a screenshot of the rendering options you are using?

After some more tests, it seems to happen when a layer is first removed.
To reproduce :
* start from a blank project,
* add a new layer,
* add another layer,
* remove the newly added,
* add another layer => it will be placed at the bottom, and if you do it
again, on top, and then at the bottom, etc.

Say, from a Python plugin, if you want to reorder layers rendered on the
map canvas. But what I observed might be linked to the previous issue.

Hi all.
According to
http://www.sourcepole.com/svg-symbols-in-qgis-with-modifiable-colors
to make it possible to change the colour of SVG symbols, a special syntax should be used.
Of course nobody wants to rewrite his symbols, so the question is: is there a
(semi)automatic way to convert symbols and make their colours modifiable?
It would be useful to make all current symbols modifiable, as well as adding new ones.
I attach a couple of examples.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Paolo,

I'm not sure that those are proper svg. They look like svg wrapped 
around something binary (a png?). I didn't know that was legal.

Either way they're lacking the "fill", "stroke", and "stroke-width" 
parameters that the sourcepole post needs to make things editable.

I did up a little shell script that worked on the examples I had, but 
given your examples I need to play with it a bit because it should fail 
for our examples better than it does. I can put that up somewhere if 
people are interested.

-ramon.

yes, the question is how to add them without redoing it by hand for potentially
hundreds of symbols

please, do. the first use would be to apply it to the existing standard symbols and
make them editable.

Hi Paolo,

yours are probably bad examples. These svg files have raster images
encapsulated, which is ok for svg, but I do not think you can ever
change color of those on the fly...

what you probably mean are true vector svg symbols, on those you can add
attributes to certain vector parts. Most symbols I find now in source
tree already have this attributes.

If you want to have the examples you have as true svg vectors they can
off course be vectorized.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsComposer-cleanupAfterTemplateRead() not used:
 composer template NOT refreshing map item
Message-ID: <538DDBDE.308@duif.net>


Hi,

somebody asked me when using Composer templates in another project, the
map item should not be refreshed by default.

Currently if you create a composer template(!) in project A (centered
around Europe), and then want to use that template in project B
(centered aroudn North-America), you will not see North America when you
load the template in project B.
You have to do several actions:
- click on the MapItem
- click 'Set to map canvas extent'
- click 'update preview' (hoping you have the Render option active)

In the code I found a method: cleanupAfterTemplateRead()

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/composer/qgscomposer.cpp#L3249

If I call that method in the on_mActionLoadFromTemplate_triggered like this:
on_mActionLoadFromTemplate_triggered()
{
  loadTemplate( false );
  cleanupAfterTemplateRead();
}

the template shows up in the way we think is logical: showing you your
map which you are viewing in QGIS.

Question:
- is this removed by accident, or deliberate?
maybe the loading of the templates is changed after adding the atlas
functionality?

Question 2:
- am I the only one who does not like the wording/concepts around
composers and templates?

There are 'composers' and 'templates'?
If I save a composer, what I actually save is a QGIS project?
There are 3 menu-items all to open a new composer (always needing an
extra 'title' step)
etc

Isn't the trick that a composer is actually a 'print layout', and that
you either save that one in the project (now called a composer then) or
as a separate file (then called a template)?
Or is a 'composer' actually a print layer with fixed layers/extent etc etc?
Not sure if it is easy to make this more clear. Maybe some UI people
have an opinion?
Otherwise, just ignore this question :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] dash in plugin folder name = big problems
Message-ID: <CAJJa6h9q_h24z4si--h-N1P6cAWQ+zJUExQQbwZqy3yemt1+Dw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

as described there (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3145), plugins cannot
have dashes in their folder name. I understand that this is related to
Python and not specifically to QGIS. However, the issue is that we are
asked to upload our plugin, so I created a temp folder (yes with a
dash) copied the relevant files that were asked and uploaded the ZIP.
In your system, the name of the plugin is not the name given in the
metadata.txt but the name of the folder inside the ZIP.

I simply suggest that you add a warning on the plugin help page, that
would be helpful to others since tracking the error is not that
simple.

Cheers,
Hugo

Hi Anita -

I've just tried your project on my win8 pc with QGIS 2.3 32 bit and 
compared it with my QGIS 2.0 set-up on the same pc:

Start-up times for the "annecy" project (QGIS already started with an 
empty project):

  * QGIS 2.0: 6.7 sec. every time.
  * QGIS 2.3: 1. time 6.9 sec.; 2. time: 7.5 sec.; 3. time: 8.4 sec.
    .... 7. time: 11.9 sec. I've loaded an empty project between each
    iteration.

It takes between 0.6 -  0.9 sec. longer for each reload of the project. 
If I restart QGIS and load the "annecy" project the load time falls to 
6.9 sec. again.

The QGIS Code revision number is  ca6d4d9.

Why not on QGIS2 or Adhoc.osgeo (that's where the mapserver demo also
lives).

It's quite rough - but should handle simpler cases.
It should also flag files that aren't suitable or probably have already 
been modified.

https://github.com/mewoch/mod_svg

./mod_sh file1.svg (files.svg)

and should generate file_mod.svg - but there's a commented out line to 
change this if you decide you trust it.

Thanks for the test case. Should be fixed now, please check again with

You can reorder layers in map canvas by simply reordering the entries
in the layer tree - the same way as done with drag'n'drop: 1. add a
new node(s), 2. remove old node(s). Simply get the layer tree from
project (QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot()) and then just call the
root group's methods to add/remove nodes.

Alternatively one could use the map canvas bridge class and set a
customized layer order in case the layer order in canvas should not be
the same as in the tree. The bridge class is currently not exposed
from QgisApp, though no problem to add it.

Martin

Hmmm this feature should be actually quite easy to add. I'm just
wondering where to put layers without geometry (to the top?) and
raster layers (to the bottom?)

I guess that should depend on whether the removed layer has labels or
not, right?

it happens regardless if the activated/deactivated/removed layer has
labels or not.

I meant qml, added to default styles.
I think it would be very good, especialy if we also add to sample data an OSM sample.
Thanks.

Does QGIS ship predefined qml files? I didn't know it, where are they?

I've delved a little bit further into the matter:

Anita's original project is a 2.2 project. If you convert the project to 
version 2.4 by simply saving it and then open the new version 2.4 
project the time to open it is reduced to 6.0 sec. Every time.

So the delays is due to QGIS 2.3 opening a version 2.2 project.

SQLite is here to stay, it is embedded in almost every portable device and a 
strong and mature piece of code. Probably the most deployed database in the 
world.
SpatiaLite is indeed a different piece of cake in term of contribution openness 
and community. We can hope that GeoPackage development will end up 
rationalizing and optimizing development efforts on spatial SQLite-based 
solutions. We can also be part of this effort if needed.

There is a question of user interface and a question of stable and technically 
strong development. Redundant technical ways of doing the same thing can be 
hidden through carefully designed UI so that the user knows what use case 
should be done which way (and even do not realize there are other ways).

Right.

I would not be shocked if QGIS had an "official" local data format, allowing the 
user to get all features when using it, and other formats for 
interoperability.
I do not think that this would disturb users as :
* almost all software do this
* QGIS already behaves like this, with read-only data formats for examples
It would almost simplify the situation as in "use the official format or accept 
limitations".

And of course having a GeoPackage-compatible format would be a win.
This kind of change could trigger a new major version though, to make it clear 
that this is an important change.

Hi Vincent,
while I see your point, and I agree that gpkg could be a good candidate,
I think there are two major issues in choosing a standard format:
* the need to import/export data will put an additional burden on users,
and will result in duplicate and possibly misaligned data
* users of DBs (and we support a nice variety of them) will not have a
choice of moving to "our" format, so they will be put on a disadvantage
compared to standard format users.
All the best.

Just to make things clear. Am I right that your -1 means that one can submit
plugin with non-English UI and it will be approved? So if someone submitted
plugin with, for example, Ukrainian UI it will be accepted and will be
available even
if author can not add English UI and nobody submitted English translation to it?

What about other stuff from instructions, what is compulsory and what is not? At
plugins.qgis.org we have this:

"For a prompt approval, please check that your plugin:
 * has no malicious code
 * goes to the appropriate menu (Vector, Raster, Web, Database)
 * has at least minimal documentation
 * does not duplicate of existing functionalities or plugin, unless
there is a good reason
 * has a proper license
 * does not contain architecture-dependant binaries
 * supports English language
 * provides a minimal data set for testing
 * has (in the metadata) a link to the code repository and to a bug
tracking system of
   your choice (you can use github or other infrastructures, including
   http://hub.qgis.org/projects"

Maybe it is better to make compulsory items more visible and separate them from
non-compulsory.

Hi Alex,
hereafter my thoughts (not an official position, however).

IMO this would make sense in special cases, e.g. a plugin to connect
with local resources only is justified in having a non EN interface.
However, I regularly encourage plugin writers to provide a translation,
or at least to make it translatable, so it is easy for others to
contribute a translation.

We never agreed on a list of compulsory items. I personally check all
the above, ask the author in case something is missing or unclear, and
do not publish plugins without a bugtracker and a code repo, because I
think they are necessary to assure the quality and make contributions
easy; other reviewers however, can always do it.

All the best.

Dear Cava san and all

I am one of the organizers of this event.

There was at the Tokyo conference of ESRI last Friday.
In the conference ,there was a presentation about ratio of the share
of the GIS software in Japan . Share of ArcGIS  is 51.4%  , and QGIS
is 28.8% !!.

QGIS users in Japan is growing rapidly.
So we need more people working with QGIS community in Japan.
I want to increase the people who applied to work to maintain the QGIS
in this event.

Best regards,
Yoichi Kayama

That's breaking news! Do you have an exact reference to it?

Agreed, that's very important. I suggest you to keep connected with the
core team, so as to share these initiatives, the methods to further
improve them, and the success stories. The example of the Swiss QGIS
association is, in our view, probably the best to follow, and adapt to

Hi Paolo,

thanks for clarification.

I was asking because my friend wants to share a plugin and asked
me about requirements. When I told him that UI and (if possible)
comments in code should be in English to allow other users to use
plugin with minimal issues he pointed me on several plugins that
doesn't follow this recommendation. This list contains also recently
approved vectorGeoref plugin which is a general-usage plugin.

That's why I raised this question.

I think we should not force people to do english (although I'm aware
that we do not have that much approvers for japanese, persian or korean
plugins :-( ). (The code and comments should be english though)

I created a dutch UI plugin to make it easy for beginner QGIS users to
connect to some national OGC services. Personally I could make it
translatable (but I think not so much non dutch people will be
interested in this plugin), but I think for a beginning coder it would
make it harder to code it like that (though the plugin builders now
alread add it in their boilerplate code...).

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde
ps: we have 'experimental' and 'normal' plugins now, could we maybe have
'experimental', 'normal' and 'first class' plugins? In which first class
plugins DO have translatable UI etc etc. And follow the guidelines very
strict. While the normal ones have some slack in that?

One additional note: the requirements are somewhat more relaxed when (as
in this case) the plugin is experimental, as an encouragement to help
authors to publish it.
IMHO we have to be more strict for regular (non experimental) plugins.
All the best.

above URL  is the photo .
There is a Pi chart.

Purple??      A??GIS   51.4%
Yellow          QGIS      28.8%
Yellow-green SIS          4.8%

If plugins are not made in English, there is no possibility to translate 
them as it's agreed to happen from English.
One idea could be some tag which marks that plugin has very local nature 
so it should not be translated ever.

Personally I classify all those which cannot be translated to 
experimental/not for production.
In this class goes easily also all those which don't have some kind of 
documentation.

Hi,

In the log messages I get a lot of messages like

"Unknown attribute editor widget 'LineEdit'"

I assume this is a side effect of the widget redesign?

Do others have the same issue? Should I file a bug or is this already

In QGIS 2.2 if you checked "Use render caching where possible to speed up redraws" in the rendering options WMT-S tiles were drawn immediately after download on the screen.  Under QGIS master this no longer happens - with or without MTR enabled

Is it possible to get this feature back? It really improves usability for users and makes the application seem more responsive.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] labelling issues
Message-ID: <CACfnYnRNYsPPoiOiyEGiyxDB1+JfAOYvg_AN22ta7hMzk_oJdw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm looking to confirm the following issues related to labelling:


*) when a layer has labels then when switching on/off any other layer
(with labels or not) the one with labels is always refreshed. This
does not happen if the layer does not have labels

*) data defined rotation works, but then the label "rotate tool" does
not work (does nothing)

*) if in addition it is defined the data defined position then the
data defined rotation stops to work and labels are rendered horizontal

*) if the position of a label is changed with "move label" tool then
the rotation is taken into account (just for that label) and the
"rotate tool" start to work

*) I'm not able to find what is the proper postgis datatype to be used
for data defined position of labels, I tested the one available wit
the qgis gui and then labels stop to render (is ok with shapefile
"decimal" data type).


cheers

Yes, but unfortunately not for 2.4. I would like to address this in a
future release. Previously the WMS provider used a trick for tiled
requests: if render caching was on, after some time it would return
image even if it wasn't finished yet, keep downloading, and later
request further redraws of canvas (which were cheap because other
layers were cached already).

Hi Matthias,

I don't experience any issues because of this. But there are a lot of 
such messages in the log windows and it looks like an error.

It seems if I save it under a different project file (with master 
version) and reload it again it seems to be fine. So I would assume this 
message only comes up when opening old project files.

QGIS would then convert it to the new widget type, correct?

BTW: what does the "level" column mean in the log message panel? The 
higher the more severe?

Well,
what I have here is
- data defined rotation does work only if XY data is not null. Rotation
tools works only on moved labels too.

Hi Andreas,

Commit b98c2fec [1] should fix this.
I think it was merely a cosmetic issue.
I guess level is connected to severity and can be interpreted the way 
you say, but no promise.

Maybe this is something related to this issue?

Because of this problem I found that using charvar in Postgis works better
than numeric fields.

Hi all,

I have come up with a mockup of an idea I had today about creating a new
export/save as workflow for QGIS.  I have opened for it at
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10454 and would be interesting in having some
feedback on the design.

Save having to write more here you can get more details on the ticket.

same author for both; asked to translate the description. as for the UI,
the cxf format is AFAIK an Italian peculiarity, so perhaps a translation
is not an absolute necessity.

>  - geovallecvc (non English description and UI)

this deals with a very local issue, so perhaps translating the UI is not
necessary; an English About has been asked

>  - vectorGeoref (non English UI)

English About asked

>  - geopunt4Qgis (non English description)

I see a double language (NL+EN) description, and an EN About. I think it
can be left as it is.

Comments welcome.
All the best.

Hi Yoichi,
could you please try to find the original reference, and in particular
the methods to calculate these figures?
Thanks.

Hi, 
another issue:  With old implementation, one could select a set of layers
(shift + clic) and activate/deactivate them in batch mode. It was very
useful, and I will miss it. And before 2.2, activating was possible using
space key. That disappeared from 2.2 but was useful too. 
Need a ticket?

Ok, I am trying to use it.
Some issues :

- passing 'false' to the 'addToLegend' parameter of
QgsMapLayerRegistry::addMapLayer (in Python) still adds the layer to the
legend, apparently

- QgsLayerTreeGroup.insertLayer( 0, layer ) gives strange things in
Python (crash of qgis). Doing insertChildNode( 0, QgsLayerTreeLayer(
layer ) ), or storing the object returned by insertLayer solves the
problem. It seems to be related to the way Python garbage collects (?)

Just a remark on the API : if layers must be added first to the
MapLayerRegistry before being added to the legend, then why removing a
layer from the legend makes it removed from the registry and only if it
is the only one remaining ?

Ok, no need for that yet for me, but that may be interesting.

I had a bit hard time finding a server where getLegendGraphic would
work with QGIS. My local GeoServer installation did not work either.
Do you have any examples of working servers?

Oh, that's a surprise for me, I never knew we had such feature. To me
the current behaviour makes more sense - the check boxes should be
independent from the selection. Still you may convince me the previous
behaviour was better. :-)

The space key still works. Just the in-place editing has often
overridden it - fixed.

Layers do not need to be added to map layer registry first. A layer
can exist in the layer tree even without being loaded.

> layer from the legend makes it removed from the registry and only if it
> is the only one remaining ?

Otherwise the layer would be removed from the layer tree and it would
never get deleted.

If you create your own layer tree, you will not have this behaviour
unless you use it with map layer registry bridge.

For the future (QGIS 3), I'd like to see the following:
- map layer registry will not be used explicitly by client code
(calling addMapLayer/removeMapLayer methods)
- all map layers will be automatically added to the map layer registry
when constructed - and removed when deleted
- if client code will want to add a map layer to layer tree, it would
do it by itself

Thanks for testing!

Cheers
Martin

Yeah that sounds about right. Of course these rules won't work in all
situations, but I think they represent a better default behaviour.

Hi


Another regression / change in behaviour between legend in 2.x and master
is that layers added in python are not focussed in the legend. This breaks
some of our InaSAFE stuff that expects this behaviour.

Good:

Bad:

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=zVoz69KTiz+YPRsz4ohTGt0kUSuUph24B5TZmNk=Z3rA@mail.gmail.com>

I've done some testing with fTools' spatial join and select by location
tools.
Whatever the geometry type it uses the "intersects" operator, which is true
even if geometries only touch.

I've patched my own version to distinguish the case the input layer (to be
selected) is a linear or polygonal layer. In that case I check if
"overlaps" or "contains" are true, but I reject the case the geometries
only touch. I keep the single intersects operator in case of points.

If you agree with the logic (I don't want to select or join geometries that
only touch) I will submit a pull request.

Both options should exist. Perhaps a checkbox to exclude those that only
touch?

Admittedly, in my own version I have three checkboxes:

 - include layers that only touch
 - include layers that only overlaps
 - include layers the are completely contained

and they are all checked by default (which is an intersects)
This let me take full control on the intersection matrix.

I think this behaviour can be added, but maybe it is not a good idea
to rely on the fact that newly added layer is set as current. The
behaviour wasn't documented anywhere, so it could be changed without
any prior notice. Also, there could be various circumstances when this
assumption may be wrong - e.g. plugins doing changes to the current
layer. Finally, even in 2.2, if the user enables "Add new layers to
selected or current group" and the selection is on a group, there will
be no change of selection, so likely breaking that part of InaSAFE
code too.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to change credentials using QgsCredentials and
	QgsNetworkAccessManager
Message-ID: <CAFO80_qq+9=oGTxSEn1y2AQE1XfPnh-+YoiPwOK_Ryc_jt9UjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to change credential after a successful login, but without
success, and I wonder it's not possible, so I ask to the community what's
I'm doing wrong.
The only way I found to login as new user is closing and opening again qgis
:|

the workflow it this one

first correct login

1) get a QgsNetworkAccessManager instance
2) prepare a request
3) auth is required by the server => QgisApp::namAuthenticationRequired is
called
4) in QgisApp::namAuthenticationRequired QgsCredential get(...) is used to
ask user and password that are set in the QAuthenticator

all proceed well... but at a moment my plugin need to be used by other
user, so next steps for a new requests are

5) get a QgsNetworkAccessManager instance
6) prepare a request
7) auth is required by the server, but QNetwarkAccessManager use cached
credentials and NO signal AuthenticationRequired => it doesn't enter
in QgisApp::namAuthenticationRequired => no credential are requested and
continue with the old credentials

QNetworkAccessManager reuse "old" QAutenticator so it is unuseful set new
credentials with QgsCredentials::instance().put(). QgsCredentials are get
only in QgisApp::namAuthenticationRequired that is called once (due the
fact that QgsNetworkAccessManager is singleton?)

next QT version (qt5) has a QNetorkAccessManager::clearAccessCache().
Method not available in QT4.

Should I use directly QNetworkAccessManager instead of then singleton
version forced by QgsNetworkAccessManager?

anyone know a way

Any help is appreciated,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] add rasterlayer to qgsmapcanvas
Message-ID: <538F8A7F.7020101@uni-weimar.de>

Hello everyone,
I try to load on signal, a rasterlayer to qgsmapcanvas. I try it like in 
the pycookbook:

@QtCore.pyqtSlot()
     def loadRasterImage(self):
     print "slot works"
         fileName = QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(None, "historical map", 
".", "Image Files (*.png *.jpg *.bmp *.tiff)")
         fileInfo = QFileInfo(fileName)
         baseName = fileInfo.baseName()
         rlayer = QgsRasterLayer(fileName, baseName)
         if not rlayer.isValid():
             print "Layer failed to load!"
         QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(rlayer)
     print rlayer.extent().yMinimum()
     self.canvasRaster.setExtent(rlayer.extent())
     self.canvasRaster.setLayerSet( [ QgsMapCanvasLayer(rlayer) ] )

self.canvasRaster is defined in the gui . I search for 8h but I dont 
find a solutionen, because there are no errors.

It load the rasterlayer to the main program of qgis, but not in my 
qgsmapcanvas. it is still white.

please help me.

yes that's it, I edited the ticker to reflect the fact that affects

Thanks, this helped! It should be fixed now, but it seems that
GetLegendGraphics support has some general issues:
- I have to explicitly choose a style for a WMS layer in order to have legend
- WMS provider adds redundant query items to the URL - e.g. URL [1] is
rewritten to [2]. Maybe that's why my local GeoServer instance has
problems answering the requests from QGIS

Martin

You can try our server:

http://webapps.comune.trento.it/ogc

with the layer "prg_vigente", it's a compley layer with many many
legend symbols...  enyoy with it :-)

Try setting the QNetworkRequest::AuthenticationReuseAttribute
of your QNetworkRequest to QNetworkRequest::Manual.

Hi,

Well, if someone works on improving the intersection functions it would
make sense to introduce a threshold value to allow to ignore area/area
intersections with very small overlaps (e.g. very small sliver polygons
overlapping).

But I doubt that all of this would happen by itself without someone
investing time or money into it. Certainly not for QGIS 2.4 where we are
in feature freeze already.

Hi Andreas,
I'm doing it :)
As you can see I've added the checkox options to have fine control on
spatial relations. I could add the threashold value as well.
I know we are in feature freeze, I'm doing it for the next 2.5/2.6. Should
I wait for 2.4 release before submitting pull requests with new features?

Hi Bernhard

I didn't try the DataDrivenInputMask plugin yet, howerver it seems to be 
a nice tool to work with related table on db side. If an application 
module is not highly complex (e.g. needs specialised map tools and 
functions), the plugin might already do everything needed on QGIS side.

limitation

Exactly, working in a transaction would allow to remove everything cleanly.

 >Would this be in api, only available to users through plugins?

Yes, it would only be available through plugins.

Marco

yes, it's not so intuitive user interface, but it has it's logic, because
for a specific layer server can render it in different way with different
legends

can be adjusted checking/parsing if parameters are already present avoiding
to add to the URL params.... or updating them (layer should be updated)

that's a pity :)
I just mentioned it because it addresses the same question and I had to 
deal with the same problems you do.

well, it does not matter if your plugin has special tools or not, you 
can call the mask at any time and you can customize the mask layoutwise 
(there is a tool provided) and by adding special functions to it through 
its api methods (at the moment only buttons, but would not e hard to add 
a tool, too, because it needs subclassing anyways).

I read the discussion on your pull request but can add nothing to the 
design questions risen there.
I would love to have something like that in api in order to support 
undo/redo for my plugin thus having the mask behave like any other edit 
in QGIS.

  I played (a little) with QGis-Master and I haven't bumped into that

Manual vs Automatic attribute...

Probably this behaviour match this qt bug:
https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-16835

I would use QgsNetworkAccessManager to hide qgis proxy parameters

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Is useasdefault column in public.layerstyles
 correctly handled when retrieving default style?
Message-ID: <CACw3ADjsMgXdARiKmscW-Mkjkn38PVcHw8_hk_BH6L_bmj8P7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

in QGIS (trunk updated from git to some days ago, but also in QGIS 2.2 and
2.0) I have seen a strange behaviour opening a postgis layer in with some
saved styles in table public.layer_styles.

All styles have useasdefault set to false (these styles only makes sense
within some projects, should not be used as default styles).

When I open the layer without any project, one of the styles is applied, in
particular the one with update_time more recent.

The exact query that finds the default style seems to be

SELECT styleQML FROM layer_styles WHERE f_table_catalog='mydb' AND
f_table_schema='myschema' AND f_table_name='mytable' AND
f_geometry_column='the_geom' ORDER BY CASE WHEN useAsDefault THEN 1 ELSE 2
END,update_time DESC LIMIT 1


In my opinion rows with useasdefault set to false should be completely
filtered out by the query.

If all styles have useasdefault set to false, current query retrieves the
most recent style while I think that no rows should be retrieved in this
case and a "random color" style be applied.

Thus I propose to change the query in

SELECT styleQML FROM layer_styles WHERE f_table_catalog='mydb' AND
f_table_schema='myschema' AND f_table_name='mytable' AND
f_geometry_column='the_geom'  WHERE useAsDefault ORDER BY update_time DESC
LIMIT 1

Would you like me to open a bug?

Regards,

Gabriele Monfardini

Well - if you do it now there is a risk of conflicts if you merge it
after the lift of the feature freeze. Typically, after the feature
freeze a lot of new features that did not make it into 2.4 are coming in
and there is a risk of conflicts. But in your particular case I don't
think there will be conflicts in this part of the code.

The other thing is that we should now be concentrating on testing and
bug-fixing ;-)

Thanks for you work anyway - no matter when you do it,
Andreas

NP, I will pull it after the release of 2.4. No hurry ;)
In the meanwhile I will give a look to the bug-fixing activity, in case I
find some time to contribute.

Message-ID: <1401969510541-5144205.post@n6.nabble.com>

I have a 64-bit QGIS 2.3.0-Master on Ubuntu with a Spatialite version of
3.0.0-beta.
On a Windows machine with a OSGEO4W QGIS 2.2 32-bit the Spatialite version
is 4.1.1.

Why is the Spatialite version older on the newer QGIS version?

thanks,
Jakob

Message-ID: <53906E5C.1000601@carto.net>

Hi,

I have a cool new Android (4.4.2) tablet and wanted to install QGIS on
it. I downloaded the QGIS installer and installed the nightly. The
install went fine and automatically installed the required Ministro II
libraries for qt-support.

After that I was really disappointed. I could neither load a TIFF file
nor a Spatialite file and the QGIS version is 2.0

Is there some newer version available that can at least load and display
layers the most popular formats as read only?

Thanks if you know something about QGIS on Android.

Andreas

Maybe Android can't compete with 27 summits[1] in Switzerland. ;)

Hello everyone,
I try to load on signal, a rasterlayer to qgsmapcanvas. I try it like in
the pycookbook:

@QtCore.pyqtSlot()
      def loadRasterImage(self):
      print "slot works"
          fileName = QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(None, "historical map",
".", "Image Files (*.png *.jpg *.bmp *.tiff)")
          fileInfo = QFileInfo(fileName)
          baseName = fileInfo.baseName()
          rlayer = QgsRasterLayer(fileName, baseName)
          if not rlayer.isValid():
              print "Layer failed to load!"
          QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(rlayer)
      print rlayer.extent().yMinimum()
      self.canvasRaster.setExtent(rlayer.extent())
      self.canvasRaster.setLayerSet( [ QgsMapCanvasLayer(rlayer) ] )

self.canvasRaster is defined in the gui . I search for 8h but I dont
find a solutionen, because there are no errors.

It load the rasterlayer to the main program of qgis, but not in my
qgsmapcanvas. it is still white.

please help me.

Felix

Is the layer loaded, showing in the legend but just not visible? Check the

The layer is loading in the legend and shown in the main window.
What do you mean, with the symbology. In front of the layer, in the 
legend, is a raster icon, if you mean this.

I copied the code from the slot to the building of the ui. so the layer 
is loading in the canvas by building the gui and not by clicking in the 
toolbar.

If I start qgis with this state of code, its starts and load load the 
layer, when I start the plugin the canvas is still white and when I 
clicked on the starting picture of qgis which is still there, the layer 
is shown in the canvas of the plugin.

It's confusing me.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Opinion on plugin named prepair (and possible
	likes)
Message-ID: <5390F3E4.6070802@pp1.inet.fi>

Hi,

there was some discussions during the spring of the plugin prepair. 
Problem was that it needs to have a compiled "kernel", c++, user UI is 
in python.
I've tested it now both in linux (openSuse 12.3 and QGIS 2.2 up2date) 
and windows (w7pro/64 and QGIS 2.3 nightly latest) environments.
In linux the program has to be compiled by user, this might cause some 
problems if user is not used to compile programs, check libraries etc. 
For seasoned user that only takes some 5-10 minutes to get it done. In 
windows there is precompiled package but only as zip not with any 
installer which may cause problems (e.g. where to place it).

Both installations worked with certain settings and included test case, 
results were similar, but further test settings caused  big problems in 
windows installation which I'll report after a good night sleep.

There will be real use for the plugin. But some development is needed 
also for UI.


Conclusions

Plugin is useful and thus very acceptable, but
- it can be installed only by person who knows what to do, those people 
who do digitizing are not always programmers (very seldom)
- to tell where the actual workhorse is situated is quite clumsy way to 
use it even the plugin remembers the site (but only in that same 
session), this should developed to some settings. Now You find it once 
and write it on paper not to need to find it again etc. otherwise you 
spend time and possibility to make error?.

- these kind of plugins should be marked always as experimental and with 
this I mean all similar "need-to-be-compiled" plugins


Cheers,
Kari

PS. I really liked the idea of this plugin and respect the developers. I 
also understand that maybe something I didn't understand why windows 
didn't work as expected.

Hi Martin


One other glitch I have found is that loading a QML style file in the
properties dialog sometimes (always?) does not refresh the legend when you
close the dialog. Saving the project, closing and reopening it does cause
it to refresh.

Regards

Tim

How old is your git checkout? I have probably fixed that issue
yesterday - #10469 had very similar symptoms as you describe.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ogr osm provider seems broken
Message-ID: <539165EB.5040006@duif.net>


Hi Devs,

to me the way qgis handles .osm files seems broken, see:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10000

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10427

apparently ogr returns -1 on the number of features, but more important
the feature interator seems broken

Problems: loading an osm file and viewing the attribute table only shows
2 records (while all points are shown on the map).
Iterating over the features with python also raises errors.

Not sure if we should make this a blocker, because I'm not convinced of
the importance of .osm files.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] scroll area in style page of vector layer
	properties
Message-ID: <53916636.80606@gmail.com>

Hi all,

To fix the issue of the expression widget being too large in 
categorized/graduated symbology pages, I had to remove the scroll area 
from the main layout.
I don't think it's a problem, and I believe that if a scroll area is 
needed it should be done in the next level (i.e. in the pages like point 
displacement, categorized, etc).

I made a pull request for this: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1428

I just wanted to be sure there was no counter-argument.

If not, I will merge this soon.

Cheers.

Denis

Hi Kari,
thanks a lot for your review. I agree, it could be better marking it as experimental
for now. Please let me know if someone objects.
I think once the plugin is well tested, we'll have to add the exe to the standalone
installer for Windows. In the meantime I'm trying to have it on Debian. If someone
can do the same for OSX, that would be great.
For specific issues, please use the bugtracker.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Editing groups of layers / edit buffer /
	transactions
In-Reply-To: <538D9A5B.6060309@sourcepole.ch>
References: <538D9A5B.6060309@sourcepole.ch>
Message-ID: <5391715C.3010408@gmx.ch>

Hi devs,

Being able to use transactions has a couple of advantages for users of
databases:

 * Databases are prepared for multi user access. A transaction handles
concurrent access on DB side.
 * Immediate feedback if a constraint is violated. With the edit buffer
in QGIS, constraints are checked on commit only and updates are
partially submitted.
 * The order of actions is considered (across multiple layers).
 * Triggers are executed immediately and possible effects on other
layers are visible to QGIS.
 * Feature ID's are stable across commits.

The edit buffer on QGIS side has the following jobs (if I'm right):

 * Buffer changes (insert/delete/update) for a single layer.
 * Offer undo support.
 * Broadcast (signal) changes when they occur to the QGIS system.

As some of these items are closely related to transactions the edit
buffer cannot be used in combination with transactions. So the questions
is how it is possible to still support undo in such cases (a system with
snapshots would be a possibiliity) and how to signal things (forward
actions on client side, when they are sent to the DB / push notifications).

On another note, I would be very happy to see support for a
layer-independent edit buffer for the relations. The current solution,
where a related layer has to be switched to edit mode from an embedded
form and when you turn off edit mode from the same place the whole layer
is saved, although the context of the button in the UI suggests that
only the related features are being committed. Another problem is, that
there a PK may be generated only on commit time and creating a foreign
key pointing to an uncommitted feature can not be correctly treated, as
the layer with the foreign key may be committed before the layer where
it points to. This does not need to be done via transactions, but any
kind of multi-layer edit buffer - either project wide or on groups of
layers - would be highly welcome.

I have not yet thought about all this in very detail and there may be
still some errors in the concepts outlined in this mail, but I hope some
of my thoughts on this topic are valid and constructive. It's an
important discussion on the direction to take in order to further enable
QGIS as a powerful database frontend.

Kind regards,
Matthias

Message-ID: <53918529.7050701@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
The new QGIS version will be released very soon. There are still 58 blocking issues,
growing. Some of them are quite nasty. I urge everybody, and especially those who use
QGIS in large organization, saving tons of money previously spent in licences, to
quickly invest a fraction of these savings into fixing some of these.
With >1 million users, this seems a feasible target.
Thanks.

Hi Paolo, 
I'm still searching a way to sponsor you, and have good hopes we will find a
way. but it won't make it for 2.4.
And we will probably be finding a solution only available for my
organization. I would have prefered to find a way that other public users in
France could repeat, so that we start a massive movement. 
Any feedback from current european sponsors is more than welcome.

that topic, and partial time only. Having longer release candidate period,
and a 6 months release cycle could help for me.

Hi Paolo,

I dont think that I can help on any developing issue with my insufficient
knowledge but I can help on any testing or similar things if needed.

Regards,
Necip.

One more issue I have found is that the commit below introduces a crash if
you add layers from different crs's.

Hi,

I kind of agree. I also think the one month testing phase is too short
to properly deal with all of the bugs.

Maybe a six month release cycle with 4 month development and 2 month
testing would be more useful in the future.

Furthermore, we would probably need at least one bugfix release.

But I know you have discussed this back and forth ... and there is no
single solution that fits for everyone.

---------

BTW: I believe our finances would allow to again sponsor 1 week of paid
bug fixing from the QGIS funds. Like with the past two releases. Has the
PSC discussed this?

I understand this. However, you are free to upgrade only if and when you have time
for it, e.g. skipping every second version will give you an 8 months time frame.
IMHO the fixed release cycle will help people planning in advance (yes, also the
investment for bugfixing :) ).
All the best, and thanks for your interest.

not yet. I'd be in favour of this, even though I'd like to see a more direct
involvement of power users.

The longer release time isn't for users its for us devs. After the feature
freeze is lifted features start going in adding more bugs. So a longer
release cycle with 2 months bug fix would allow for more polish.

This release was of course a major change adding some big stuff maybe we
just expand this one?

Hello,

Could we make a more visible RC release on the website, encouraging testing ?

I think that our user are not used yet to our new release cycle. We really 
should educate them, and lower the barrier to RC testing and bug reporting. As 
for now, even installing the RCs is complicated, so is bug reporting.

What about modifying the RCs so that :
* we have a bug report feature in the help menu, allowing to create an osgeo 
user, search for bug and report if not found ?
* we add a splash-screen or a first pop-up window stating clearly that there is 
a need for bugfixes, and therefore a strong and quick need for funding ?
Maybe even adding links to supporting companies as stated on the website, so 
that users/clients can contact them directly, in addition to the sponsoring 
informations ?
* we add to this popup a big "donate now" button linking to paypal / flattr or 
whatever simple system for micro-donation, and a bitcoin address
* we propose to optionnally subscribe to a specific qgis-newsletter mailing 
list, where we can reach our userbase with RC download links, and funding 
requests (with a privacy protection + no spam statement)

This is a bit late for 2.4 of course, but this is IMHO a way to enlarge our 
tester base, as well as our funders.
What we need is not a different release cycle, but more education. Adopting  
more push-oriented communication methods seams the way to go.

My 2 cents,

Vincent

I don't think the issue is just bug reporting for a RC though. As
mentioned, we've already got a very long blocker list, which is still
growing.

I think a bigger issue is development resources and developer's time
availability. At the current rate of bug closing we're very likely to still
have a large number of these issues outstanding at the end of the month.

I'm in favor of a longer freeze period for next release.

More bug reports, bug comments and better bug reports is already a lot of 
developer's time saved.
Having more testers (and regular testers) is as important as having developers 
to fix bugs.

My proposal was also more oriented towards getting users involved in all ways, 
and especially funding at Feature Freeze time.
Getting them to download, install and test more thoroughly the RCs, and using 
this media to incent them to fund the software do contribute to more 
developers time.

> I'm in favor of a longer freeze period for next release.

I am not sure that more non-paid developer time is a sustainable model.

Or it is a matter of going from a FF development model, to a more formal peer-
review commitfest model ( like http://rhaas.blogspot.fr/2011/03/commitfests-
and-meritocracy.html ).

There are many other ways to reduce bugs even before reaching feature freeze, 
some of them already discussed thoroughly here, I am just trying to find some 
easy, reachable and efficient means, which can of course be complementary to 
other means.

Thank you for your feedback Kari.

I understand that compiling is not for everyone, that's why we offer both
Windows and Mac binaries (we added Mac yesterday). No compiling required.
It is written on the website how to proceed for Windows: unzip to C:\
directly.

A windows Installer would be nice, but, Paulo, do you mean that QGIS would
add prepair? That would be tricky, since we use CGAL too. But that would be
great.

The plugin should remember the path of the EXE, it does on all computers
we've tested. Report bug on the issue page with details please.

Cheers,
Hugo Ledoux

We already have a big banner at main page about RC and testing. Seems most
users don't visit main page too often to notice it.

Sorry if I didn't word my original reply very well - I didn't mean to imply
bug reports aren't important or valued! I'm just unsure how we can clear
our current queue in time for release as it stands currently...

While testing and reporting is important without a doubt, the currently
outstanding issues could be fixed easily by the end of the month as soon
as resources are available.

The main point is, that we should start improving where there is the
biggest effect - and that's paid bugfixing time. There are some
extremely capable and effective core devs available for this job as has
been proven in the past.

That means: go out, tell your neighbours and social media buddies and
customers about the RC and testing. But if you want the bugs they report
to be fixed, make sure that there's somebody taking care of them. The
main problems normally are not the bugs not found while testing, but the
ones not fixed before the release. This in turn also means that I don't
think a two months bugfixing period will improve a lot. If there's two
months with developers spending time on other projects because there's
no funding available for bugfixing we haven't won anything.

Matthias

Yet another interesting option, already discussed, is to maintain a stable release,
backporting fixes to it. Some work has already gone in that direction, merging and
coordinating them would be a major improvements IMHO.
I personally think this effort should be funded by one or more of the many big users
we increasingly have, and cannot rely on our efforts only.
All the best.

agreed. please spread this word to users as much as possible, using the MLs, SNs, and

I tried with a "standard" user yesterday, watching him use the site to get 
qgis, and it was still _very_ complicated for him. He expected to click on a 
"QGIS 2.4 preview download" button and the download to begin immediatly, which 
is far from happening.

Instead, the small RC link leads to a page with a lot of links, he had 
difficulties to find the preview release (not knowing what a "release candidate" 
is), hesitating with osgeo4w download, then being redirected once again on the 
same page, lost in the web page, finally finding a small link to a dull page 
listing a lot of files (what the hell is a md5sum file ?? what is this 2.3 
version ?? where is the preview ?), of which he finally chose a random exe and 
installed it. Even I was totally lost trying to get the right file.

I think we can do much better.

Then it is a matter of advertising the preview at large : official "call for 
testing" from qgis project on osgeo mailing lists, twitter, linkedin, and if 
possible on a qgis-news mailing list where we have gathered a lot of user 
beforehand (with their approval of course).

Hi.
Hugo, would you object in tagging the plugin as experimental for now?
Yes, I meant to include prepair (the plugin+the exe+des) in the standalone installer,
as well as making it easy to install it in other OSs.
Are you willing to help with that?
All the best.

I'm not sure just adding it to QGIS like that is the best idea really, it's
a bit bolt on. It would be better to port the prepair C++ logic into QGIS
itself to use QGIS geometry rather then GDAL. We could then just expose the
API and wrap it in Python to expose in Processing.

Richard,

Jukka pretty much answered rightly the questions in the tickets. The OGR OSM 
driver is rather tuned to handle multi-gigabyte .osm/.pbf files, and due to the 
structure of those files, it is impossible to count efficiently the number of 
features without reading it entirely. Hence -1 returned as the feature count. 
If you issue an explicit SELECT COUNT(*) FROM, it means that you know what you 
want, and you're ready to wait for it...

And, also related to the structure of the data, the driver is a bit particular 
in the sense that the iteratation over features with GetNextFeature() might 
not work if the osm file is of a "sufficient size". See the "Interleaved reading" 
paragraph of http://www.gdal.org/drv_osm.html.

For such cases, it might be interesting to develop a new concept in OGR, a 
whole dataset feature iterator, that could return features from different 
layers as soon as they are available.

Best regards,

We've also advertised the release candidates quite heavily on Twitter.
I don't think there is much chance to reach those users which we
haven't reached so far.

My colleagues and I are willing to help if there is interest from the
community in having prepair included in QGIS.

However, I believe, like Nathan, that including the current version is
sub-optimal: we?re just calling the binary and pass the WKT of the
geometries, and read the WKT returned. Rather slow for big polygons.

I also agree with Nathan: would you like to cooperate with QGIS core team, and
incorporate your logic, possibly your code, in QGIS itself?
All the best.

I've not dived in QGIS code to know why it works for some stuff and not for 
others, but fundamentally the way the driver works requires special handling 
in the code using the driver. My recommandation would be to use ogr2ogr to 
convert the osm file into spatialite or postgis and work with the converted 
files

I have just written a blog post and added it to Twitter, Google+, Facebook.
 I have also updated the banners on all those sites to show the RC banner.

Blog post is at http://nathanw.net/2014/06/06/help-qgis/

Yes we?re willing to do that. It should be stressed out here that we
use CGAL (www.cgal.org, which is GPL) and its depends (GMP, MPFR,
Boost).

Hello all,

Not sure if this is how it works, but can we propose that the ?small?
donations gathered by the Portuguese Users Group (570?) be directed for
this bugfixing?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

	QGIS
Message-ID: <CABRzcz8hK6U+5vuDN=jDcvUBf3gugTYfGz9VE0EoSypSshA55Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

*Weekly Report 3*

*What was done this week?*

   - Solved tickets/issues
   <https://github.com/nishithm/schematization/issues?state=open> which
   were created by the mentor on GitHub. It included addition of progress
   update (in terms of percentage) while running the algorithm and also an
   option for user to set the threshold for simplification (instead of using a
   predefined value).

   - Have added the pre-processing steps of dissolving and converting
   multiparts to singleparts in the plug-in itself after testing the
   algorithms using models. These algorithms of processing toolbox are called
   within the  SimplificationAlgorithm
   <https://github.com/nishithm/schematization/blob/master/SimplificationAlgorithm.py#L115>
    file.


*What is the plan for next week?*

   - In the coming week I'll be trying to add the tests suites for the
   plug-in which will be helpful for testing the current features as well as
   for future testing purposes.


*Wiki page : *http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/nishithm

*Code repository : *https://github.com/nishithm/schematization


Thanks and regards,

Ok that works fine for me now. And you fixed the double click on the layer
thing which was driving me nuts when it was trying to edit the name all the
time.

I think I have actually run out of issues and the legend is working great
for me - thanks for all your hard work!

Tim

BTW, the server throws an error when layers are added from the browser:

seems a server issue, as other WMS are working fine.
the different behaviour is however unexpected, and deserves some investigation.

Hi Hugo,

About a month ago, I created a formula for prepair in the OSGeo4Mac
Homebrew tap [0,1].

I would appreciate it if you would review it, and possibly do any pull
requests for changes you feel are appropriate. Specifically, what options
you used to create the new Mac binary for your plugin, where it is only
linked to GDAL's lib (I haven't looked into it yet).

Boost is a very large extra dependency, indeed.

Is missing the image format declaration.

This work.

I guess the format is mandatory for wms.

I see that your URL has the parameter "FORMAT" with null value. If I
write FORMAT=png it works...

Managinng the CGAL dependency would be useful for (SF)CGAL too. Today it's
used only by PostGIS, internally, but maybe its use will extend in the
future (hopefully for 3D in QGIS too!).

SFCGAL is a real hard to compile piece of software. Use it on qgis mean to
transformer the qgis in a real hard to compile software .

cgal is packaged in all mayor OSs, AFAIK, so no need to compile it.

AFAIK it is noto available in debian stabile. Don't ?
Also surely it is not available in RH enterprise.

I guess surely it is available in ubuntu and fedora.

Message-ID: <CAGJMTBcHxPix4KbTUnL4zMx-2vuENrhFzaOMyi9WPX3m6+UFkw@mail.gmail.com>

I've noticed the new version of the Value Tool plugin (0.8.4) automatically
have the "Enable" button unchecked when another tool is selected.  What is
the rationale for this change?  I draw polygons on top of raster files to
be used during post processing and need the raster values for reference.
 This change breaks that functionality.

I'm running QGIS 2.2 on Ubuntu 14.04.

Thanks,

Jamie

CGAL is a prerequisite for SFCGAL. I'm not saying we should worry for
having SFCGAL, but analyzing the dependency for prepair is useful for
(eventually) having SFCGAL or whatever else based on CGAL.

Not on Mac. But, there is already a formula in Homebrew, and a new one for
SFCGAL [0,1].

My concern, Mac-wise, is the Boost dependency. Here are the minimal
Pros/Cons:

Pros:

* Adds prepair, which is awesome for repairing polygons.

* Adds Boost, which will offer a very robust framework to new devs, who are
not necessarily adept at Qt developing, for building new core algorithms
and features.

* Could *double* the number of devs working on project. For example, PDAL
and PCL already use Boost, and other 3D/Lidar tools may as well.

Cons:

* Boost is a very large compile and install. Since the Mac QGIS.app is
bundled, the more Boost is used, the more of it needs bundled, possibly
making the base install of QGIS on Mac balloon to over 1+ GB. Maintaining a
smaller internal src tree may be a good solution.

* The more Boost is used within QGIS source (beyond just prepair), then
there is more new devs have to learn to become accustomed to the codebase,
i.e. C++, Qt, and also Boost.

There are probably others; but, adding Boost into the QGIS source mix will
be a large change, IMHO. I think it would ultimately be beneficial.

Paolo,

just to understand better :
what do you mena as "our target for QGIS"
?

I don't gind any page in QGIS site say-inf the targets OS .
Instead I see the download page will offer:

Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSuse, RHEL (and various rhel like distro),
Mandriva, ArchLinux,
and ofcourse MAc, and Windows.

I guess this should be bettr explain to avoid mis-understanding.

Are you no speak of stables version of all this OSs ?

Thx for explain.

Andrea.

Dear Larry,

The prepair Mac binary was made by linking to static versions of CGAL, boost, GMP, GMPXX, MPFI and MPFR, and only linking dynamically to Kyngchaos? GDAL framework. The idea was that if people use Kyngchaos? QGIS package, they already have his GDAL framework since it is a requirement.

For Homebrew, I think the solution in your formula is the right way to go. Linking statically to the other libraries wouldn?t make sense.

All the best,
Ken

I have implemented this to be able to identify on a mouse click instead of
whenever you move the mouse (this is an optional behaviour). This requires
the tool being a map tool, and you cannot have more than one active map
tool.

However, when the mouse click option is not enabled, it is NOT used as a
map tool therefore it should not be deactivate when another map tool is
used.

If you uncheck that option (first in the Options dialog) and you still get
that behavior it is a bug, and you should file a bug report (I can't
reproduce with qgis 2.2).

Default is this option turned off, so if you didn't change the option
yourself that would be a bug also.

The mostly statically built binary would help for Mac bundling based off of
OSGeo4Mac within QGIS, where (currently) there is no dependency upon Boost,
CGAL, etc. The Kyngchaos.com setup for stable is the standard, but the QGIS
Mac nightlies will probably also soon offer ones built strictly off of
OSGeo4Mac. I that case, it would be ideal to offer a Homebrew 'bottle' of
prepair (~3.5 MB) that would only require the gdal formula. Then, users
would not even have to download/install the Boost bottle (~77 MB), let
alone compile it.

Will look at how to do this, when it comes to that type of bundling.

Thanks,

Larry

Hi Larry,

Maybe I?m mistaken here, but doesn?t Homebrew always compile from source? Because if so, I?d think that even the mostly statically linked binary would still need to download and install a Boost bottle (albeit one that creates a static version of the libraries).

But in any case, if it helps, I?d be happy to add the functionality to create mostly static versions of prepair to our CMake file, perhaps as a parameter.

Ken

I actually fixed this last month, and forgot to upload a new version. I've
been busy finishing my PhD the last few months which explains this!

I have just uploaded version 0.8.5 to the plugin repos.

Hi,

I open a ticket for this.
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10489

Also I do some tests.
Comparing the qgis-server response with the MapServer response.
The images I attach to the ticket show clearly where is the bug in the qgis
response.

Is wrong the position of GetLegendGraphics tag.

I need to resolve this because this mean that qgis-server is not compliant
with OGC spcs, and this mean also that it is not working with other client
rather than qgis itself This mean also that qgis wms client will not do a
test of validation and perhaps this explain because something it will crash
or dont'work perfectly.
;)

More important for me, this mean that qgis-server surely is not usable for
Inspire liek infrastructure, and this is a blocking question for any
european organization that plan to fund on qgis as a server for its
infrastructure (like us). I geuss this could be important also for other
european and inspire menbers of europe.

However I guess this is (perhaps) a simple correction.
But of course I should not break any other thinks.

Realisticly I don guess that there is a specific need to have the
getlegendgraphics in the actual posizion.
So move it in another position and resolve so this kind of invalidity
should be quite transparent to all other tools.

I like to know if this solution (change the position of GetLegendGraphics
in the Capabilites response) is an acceptable solution for others or it may
break something ?

Please also notice that I don't know if there is some other invalidity
because xmlspy is a DOM validator and stop to the first invalidity found.

I don't know if was able to produce directly a patch or use the support of
some expert.
But before to work on this I like to know any opinion.

Thx,

A.

Hi, I update the ticket.

The first problem is that the tag GetLegendGraphics is without a namespace.
This is pretty easy to resolve.

Unfortunately after resolve this there is two more complex problems.

The GetStyle and GetPrint tags.

The first is a dismissed tag from OGC available in WMS 1.1.0 and not
available in WMS 1.3.0.
Unfortunately the qgis declare its capabilities to be Version=1.3.0.

The second tag GetPrint seem to be a total invention f GetPrint.

AFAI it don't be include in a GetCapabilities response that is uniquely
dedicate to list standard elements.

If QGIS need to report this information it should be add another kind of
response something like:
"GetQGISCapabilities" and put inside it all the tags it need and are not
available in the standard WMS.

Regards,

Andrea.

Hmm, it works with OpenLayers, including GetLegendGraphic. I'm not
doubting that you may have found a validation flaw that should be fixed.
What version are you testing?

Thanks,

I understand the issue now. In order to be WMS 1.3 complaint you can
only use what's in the spec.

Looking at an analogy with html specs I find this limitation appalling
short-sighted. It means there can be no innovation testing new features
with the spec unless you manage to get it into the future spec. I find
it hard to comprehend that clients don't just skip tags that fail to
match a known tag. In html land its very common for some browsers to
know some non-standard tags, which are new features in testing to be
proposed or reworked into future standards. IE's policy of only adhering
to the spec and including no experimental tag support has been seen be
web designers as discouraging to any change. Why, because their is no
way to publicly test new ideas.

So from the QGIS side, in order to comply we would need to reply with
only allowed tags if a user requests WMS=1.3.0, we can reply with more
stuff like GetPrint if they don't specify that version. Or perhaps we
have to invent a 1.3.0+ variant specifically for when a user knows it's
QGIS server.

Anyone more familiar with WMS that can shed more light on the best way
to work around this issue and have both compliance and the ability to
add extra features that have no standard equivalent yet.

My point still stands, that EU agencies with this concern should be
funding compliance efforts, not removing funding for lack of compliance.

Thanks,
Alex

No, you can esperiment new functionality .

Simply you cannot put them in a standard response.
The right solution is what say Steafn in ticket.

QGIS has a request
QGISPropterySettings.

The new powerful but incompatible
features put them in it.
Don't abuse of standard responses.
.

Also:
You don't undestand.
I don't spaek the agency EU.
The inspire directive say:

that the europan menbers italy, france, deutch, and so on...
must recepit the directive them and all their sub agency national and local.

The directive don't say

fund to put a qgis to be compiant.

The drective say
use only compliant and interoperability wms product .

The EU put no money for this.
Every menber can use it want .
Commercial or Open product is indifferent.
The imprtant is that it is interoperability.

The Geoserver is interoperabilyt
The Mapserver is interoperability.

Why A public administration should choose QGIS-server ?
It mean lost fund when there is some one more and more copliant with
Inspire.
What is the motivation to spend public resource to have a a QGIS-server
comliant.

I guess this should be interest of who sell service on QGIS to have a qgis
compliant otherwise it has not a market in the public administrations.

Or better again.
Why there is a GetPrint and GetStyle s tags ?

In the response:

the more easy solution is remove these two tags.

I do it in few minutes and can give the patch at we ask me.

So why there is this two tags ?

They are put from someone. This someone has break the qgis wms
compatibility.
SO AFAIK should be it to fund for repair what it break.

Regards,

Andrea.

I just checked the WMS 1.3.0 specification document
http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=14416

Extended optional features are allowed. There is a specific way to
include them. See section 6.9.5 "Extended capabilities and operations"
<_ExtendedCapabilities> or <_ExtendedOperations>

So perhaps we just need to wrap those extra options in a specific tag
for them to pass schema testing.

Thanks,
Alex

Yes also this is possible,
but pay attention to use it correctly.
I guess it is no really simple to use (ie to define the extension).

In the SLD world this was allowed and a unfortunately and worst
understanding of it will born a lot of incompatible dialects.
Also in the metadata world (iso19115) the possibility to extend the specs
will produce incompatibility monster.
:)

I guess surely better and easy is put the new functions in in a distinct
and new kind of request.

Andrea.

It looks really simple to use according to the docs. If it works and
cascading WMS works with other WMS servers, and it passes the schema
check I see no issue.

This exists in the html world, over time there are winners. If you don't
care to use the extra features you are always welcome to use the base
which is 100% compliant. The winners or some compromise variant end up
in the next version of the spec.

After reading the WMS doc I believe using the tags I mention is the
correct way to do it. Technically the result is WMS 1.3.0 compliant.
Clients are free to ignore the extra functions as not using them does
not remove any required features.

As to why fund it? If QGIS provides other value to your organization in
some other way, total cost of operation may be lower to simply ensure
it's compliant rather than to switch software or have to use multiple
software.

Thanks,
Alex

Please add your specific list of current non-compliant issue to:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6520

I'll add in a note about the WMS 1.3 tags specifically created for
non-standard features.

I think this issue can be resolved.

Thanks,
Alex

This is not only a inspire need. This more important because is an WMS
invalidity.

I try to explain better.

The mapserver was not inpire compliant because it miss of something
metadata elements.
OK, but almost it was OGC WMS compliant.

The inspire specs say "take an OGC WMS compliant and on it add something
that I say to you".

The QGIS IS not WMS Compliant . This is worst than inspire non compliant.

Also inspire say "the interoperability" is the base to start all together.

The invalidity of qgis-server is due to the add of a proprietary tag that
fail the xsd tests OGC WMS.
So it is not interoperability with other products.

This is worst than :

To be more inspire compliant.

The question here is:
qgis-erver is not OGC WMS compliant.

However I say what is the problem:

The ticket is here:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10489

The problem are a worst definition of the Tag GetLegendGraphics,
but as report in the ticket the solution is described in the ticket.

The other two probles are the presence of a
GetStyle in the wms 1.3.0 response. The GetStyle was dismissed from OGC in
the 1.3.0 response.

And the presence of the proprietary tag "GetPrint".

My simplesolution was change the GetLegendGraphics.
This is a simply change in the code.
I have patched my server using "sld" prefix because is the standard.
But also the solution of Jef to use the "qgis" prefix is ok because is
valid for a good validator (xmlspy I use).
So If the qgis groups decide to adopt the "qgis" prefix namespace for
GetLegendGraphics, I have no problem to change my patch.
Otherwise I leave the standard name "sld".

The other two problems.

GetStyles and GetPrint.
They are not tags of the WMS 1.3.0 specs.
So they should not be present in the response.
The solution is remove them or put them in the specific dedicated section.
But obviously they are put correctly in that section.

Thx,

Andrea.

You are assuming a new deployment and one where QGIS is not used on the
desktop, where some groups may decide to use it for both in order to cut
down on IT staffing requirements. You are also assuming the choice is as
simple as picking a new one, there is plenty of people time involved in
deploying a different strategy and redo-ing all the styling to fit the
new way. Sure QGIS can push to geoserver now but running geosever means
running a JAVA stack. Switching to Mapserver would be more similar with
an apache setup but the QGIS export to Mapserver has long since fallen
into disrepair so now you'd need to make separate style rules for 2
programs.

I completely agree, QGIS should maintain compliance. My argument is that
organizations that are shifting money from proprietary licenses should
invest in ensuring an open source product meets their needs. To not do
so means at any time there be no options that fit their requirements.

I think I've also provided the links that show QGIS can be WMS compliant
and still have extra options, the spec provides for how to do it, we
just need to make the modifications and test it.

Thanks,
Alex

Sorry Alx,

perhapsyou don't know well the WMS specs ?

The QGIS server is really far from be a good WMS sErver.

It has not the multy style rendering.
It has not the "named groups" if don't allow to change the html response .
It don't allow to return a GML response to the user in a GetFeatureInfo 
if don't active the WFS ption.
This is obviously unacceptable.
Because there is some layer that a Public Administration cannot put in 
download as they are.

The GeoServer and MapServer are real WMS Server and they allow all of 
this and more other thinks.

The ONLY question good of qgis is The project qgis is the the same in 
the server.

You think really that ths is a killer advantage that could put an 
administration to choose an incopmaptible with the WMS specs piece of 
software instead of a fully compliant with the WMS specs ?
:))

Is really ore easy to invest on an author for GeoServer of for Mapserver 
rather than waste public fund in a Incompatible piece of software.

Because the laws deny to choose it.

I guess you can also hope to sell your service to someone .
But if it ask you:
Hey your software is compliant with OGC WMS ? This is a mandatory need 
for inspire.

You what say to your possible future client ?

Yes
or No but I hope you fund it to become.

We fund really many enhancement in qgis.
And fund also the repair when there was the break-api from 1.8 to 2.0

After funding the repair for 2.0 the compatibility was lost from 2.0 to 2.2.
And now we need to refund the repair of compatibility from 2.2 to 2.4

What credibility could have a fnd that point to grnt a compatibilit of 
qgis 2.4 on WMS specs.

Who put the GetPrint tags in the getprint ?

It has do this to have an advantage and probably to sell its product to 
someone.

I say :
ok you have your advantage, you have take your money, and now ?
You have destroyed the credibility of qgis as an WMS Server OGC.
You choose to eat the egg today instead of take the chicken tomorrow, 
and now ?
Are you happy of this ?

I guess who break repair.
So I guess the solution should be put and fund by who involontary or 
volontary (i don't know) break the WMS specs compatibility.

Or otherwise the qgis group say:

we don't care about the wms compatibility so choose other software for 
this work.

But I guess there many service seller that go around to sell service on 
qgis and say that it is a server wms compiant with WMS specs.

It is a really bad practice.
And is necessary to make understand to the reader of this miling list 
that they actualy are funding for a good desktop software,
but absolutely an incompatible server side component.

This is necessary to know ewhen a public administration choose a 
software instead of another.

Andrea.

 Sorry Alex,

As you certain know the
The QGIS server is really far from be a good WMS Server.

It has not the multy style rendering.
It has not the "named groups" if don't allow to change the html response .
It don't allow to return a GML response to the user in a GetFeatureInfo if
don't active the WFS ption.
This is obviously unacceptable.
Because there is some layer that a Public Administration cannot put in
download as they are.

The GeoServer and MapServer are real WMS Server and they allow all of this
and more other thinks.

I don't speak of velocity where the coparing is impossible.
But alsoin the rendering capable.
I guess the Mapserver (the one that I know very well), has monay point of
advantage on qgisserver.

The ONLY question good of qgis is The project qgis is the the same in the
server.
But this mean only that the  qgis-server is good for fast prototyping, no
more.

When go in production and the users grow the qgis-server will become
rapidly a bottle of neck.

So the investiment need to enhance the qgisserver to have a good and fast ,
fully complaince and affordable wms server are massive.
This could be ask to a public admiistration to fund.

But if it is not  a compliant wms server it could not never choose to start.

You think really that ths is a killer advantage that could put an
administration to choose an incopmaptible with the WMS specs piece of
software instead of a fully compliant with the WMS specs ?
:))

Is really ore easy to invest on an author for GeoServer of for Mapserver
rather than waste public fund in a Incompatible piece of software.

Because the laws deny to choose it.

I guess you can also hope to sell your service to someone .
But if it ask you:
Hey your software is compliant with OGC WMS ? This is a mandatory need for
inspire.

You what say to your possible future client ?

Yes (but you say that the real response is NO)
or say No hoping that it say no problemI fund it to became, using the
public money and rejecting other more compliance and also opensource
soltion as mapserver or geoserver.

As an exmaple:
We fund really many enhancement in qgis.

And refund the same think when pass from 1.8 to 2.0.
After the our product was break in the pass from 2.0 to2.2 and now go to
refund again to have them work in the 2.4.

Now the qgis release every 3-4 month.
These mean that a public administration should plan to refund all thei
product on qgis every 3-4 months ?

I guess this is an example clear of what mena affordable and reliability.

I guess no one public administration could fund an incompatible piece of
software to became compatible when there is other solution availables and
compatibles.

Returning to the incompatible qustion:

Who put the GetPrint tags in the getcapabilities response ?

It was the only to have a direct and immediate advantage. I dont know why
do this, but can expected that it sell its product to someone.

I say :
ok you have your advantage, you have take your money, and now ?
You have destroyed the credibility of qgis as an WMS Server OGC.
You choose to eat the egg today instead of take the chicken tomorrow, and
now ?
Are you happy of this ?

I guess who break repair.
So I guess the solution should be put and fund by who involontary or
volontary (i don't know) break the WMS specs compatibility.

Or otherwise the qgis group say:

we don't care about the wms compatibility so choose other software for this
work.

But I guess there many service seller that go around to sell service on
qgis and say that it is a server wms compiant with WMS specs.

It is a really bad
"ok qgis is not usable for an OGC WMS infrastructure."

If instead it is not happy of this it should repair what has break .

I guess an public administration should not fund this reparation, otherwise
every commite could think to have no proble to do what it like to do and
after ask to the PA to fund for the repair from its break commit.

Andrea.

You are assuming a new deployment and one where QGIS is not used on the
desktop, where some groups may decide to use it for both in order to cut
down on IT staffing requirements. You are also assuming the choice is as
simple as picking a new one, there is plenty of people time involved in
deploying a different strategy and redo-ing all the styling to fit the
new way. Sure QGIS can push to geoserver now but running geosever means
running a JAVA stack. Switching to Mapserver would be more similar with
an apache setup but the QGIS export to Mapserver has long since fallen
into disrepair so now you'd need to make separate style rules for 2
programs.

I completely agree, QGIS should maintain compliance. My argument is that
organizations that are shifting money from proprietary licenses should
invest in ensuring an open source product meets their needs. To not do
so means at any time there be no options that fit their requirements.

I think I've also provided the links that show QGIS can be WMS compliant
and still have extra options, the spec provides for how to do it, we
just need to make the modifications and test it.

Thanks,
Alex

 Hello,

but as long you, Public Administration, can choose among several
GFLOSS to implement your OGC services (that must be completely
interoperable with all the potential clients and other PA), why should
you choose a product that has choosen not to be interoperable?

The problem is not the product, but the people who doesn't mind to
write interoperable code: they are not reliable - so why a PA should
fund them and their products?

Qgis is an important product in the GFLOSS reality, but now more than
ever should take care to complethely adhere to all the international
standards, especially those which are at the basis for
interoperability.

I guess it is no really simple to use (ie to define the extension).

 It looks really simple to use according to the docs. If it works and
cascading WMS works with other WMS servers, and it passes the schema
check I see no issue.



 In the SLD world this was allowed and a unfortunately and worst
understanding of it will born a lot of incompatible dialects.
Also in the metadata world (iso19115) the possibility to extend the specs
will produce incompatibility monster.
:)

 This exists in the html world, over time there are winners. If you don't
care to use the extra features you are always welcome to use the base
which is 100% compliant. The winners or some compromise variant end up
in the next version of the spec.


 I guess surely better and easy is put the new functions in in a distinct
and new kind of request.


 After reading the WMS doc I believe using the tags I mention is the
correct way to do it. Technically the result is WMS 1.3.0 compliant.
Clients are free to ignore the extra functions as not using them does
not remove any required features.

As to why fund it? If QGIS provides other value to your organization in
some other way, total cost of operation may be lower to simply ensure

 I just checked the WMS 1.3.0 specification
documenthttp://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=14416

Extended optional features are allowed. There is a specific way to
include them. See section 6.9.5 "Extended capabilities and operations"
<_ExtendedCapabilities> or <_ExtendedOperations>

So perhaps we just need to wrap those extra options in a specific tag
for them to pass schema testing.

Thanks,
Alex

 I understand the issue now. In order to be WMS 1.3 complaint you can
only use what's in the spec.

Looking at an analogy with html specs I find this limitation appalling
short-sighted. It means there can be no innovation testing new features
with the spec unless you manage to get it into the future spec. I find
it hard to comprehend that clients don't just skip tags that fail to
match a known tag. In html land its very common for some browsers to
know some non-standard tags, which are new features in testing to be
proposed or reworked into future standards. IE's policy of only
adhering
to the spec and including no experimental tag support has been seen be
web designers as discouraging to any change. Why, because their is no
way to publicly test new ideas.

So from the QGIS side, in order to comply we would need to reply with
only allowed tags if a user requests WMS=1.3.0, we can reply with more
stuff like GetPrint if they don't specify that version. Or perhaps we
have to invent a 1.3.0+ variant specifically for when a user knows it's
QGIS server.

Anyone more familiar with WMS that can shed more light on the best way
to work around this issue and have both compliance and the ability to
add extra features that have no standard equivalent yet.

My point still stands, that EU agencies with this concern should be
funding compliance efforts, not removing funding for lack of
compliance.

 Hi,
I need to be more clear.
My english is tremendous.
:)

The Interoperability mean to have a small set of operation euals on

 EVERY

 Server WMS.

Equals mena same reqeust , same response.

So when a Cleit WMS send a Request of GetCapabilities, The response

 should

 be the same from QGIS-server or from GeoServer or From Mapserver.

The same response mean that every product use the same dialect the
same
tags and so on.


The XSD OGC is the dictionary that every wms client and server should

 use

 to know the right language and tags.

When the QGIS_Server response to a request GetCapbility with an XML
that
contains the GetPrint tags.
The client wms say "hey what is this ? It is not in the XSD OGC. This

 mean

 your response is wrong."

Of course there are some client wms that don0t do a validation of

 response,

 they HOPE that the response will be exactly as they exected.
If this is not true. They go in crash or other bad situation.

Again the resence of a Tag not compliant with XSD OGC will create
incompatibility.

Think to a client that will parse the xml response and say:

ok the GetLegendGraphics tag is passed now there is "this well know

 tag".

 Instead arrive a GetPrint tags.

The client wms become crazy.

Of course QGIS will understand it.
But this is because you (qgis group) manage it to work.

But other clients don't know that tag and so they are not able to

 extract

 all the information from Capabilities response.
This is a bad practice also because create artiiciosally an

 incopatibility

 with other products.
Instead Inspire ask for INteroperability from every product.

Interoperability don't mean use all the same unique product. (This is

 the

 microsoft philosophy)
Interoperability mean All the product must use the same little set of
command and the response at these command should be compatible
(interoperable) between all of them

Actulally this is not true for the response xml of qgis-server at a
getcapability request.

Hope to be better explain, now.

 Hi Alex,

The question is not the print capability.

The question is to LOST THE INTEROPERABILITY

If qgis response an xml that is not OGC complaint it is not

  interoperable

  with other product.

As example:

if an public Administration will eed to do a cascading wms with the

  server

  wms of another public administration.
The server before of all call for a GetCapability.

If the response has a tag proprietary. If fail.
This need Not Interoperable.

I dont say do not do a getprint.

I say remove tha tag GetPrint from the GetCapabilities response.
It is not a OGC tag and so that response is not interoperable as

  requested

  from Inspire specification.

 Hi,

AFAIK the qgis server is not complaint with Inspire.

This beacausethe Response to GetCapabilities is not responding to
the
requisite that the OGC will require for it.

Originally the qgis was simply generate an incompatible response
for

   the

   XSD of OGC.

The response is ncompatible for thre thinks:

1) the GetCapabilities is in the wrong namespace.
This is a silly question anc could be easily resolved.

2)
The presence of the GetStyle that is dismissed from OGC wms 1.3.0.
Please notice that the Inspire require the WMS 1.3.0 .
To resolve this the QGIS groups has copied the XSD of OGC and

   modifica

  it

 to redirect to a different XSD not in the OGC site.

3) The presence of a Proprietary tag inserted without any reference

   to

  any

 standard.
The GetPrint.
This is not present in any other product.

My question is for any person of a Public Administration that plan
or

 are

 funding QGIS.

In Europe the Inspire directive will ask to promove the

 Interoperability.

 The interoperability strategy ask that every produc that allow the

 inspire

 directive will speak the same language using the same tags and
functionality.

The QGIS solution to add a proprietary tag and to write a own

   different

  xsd

 that overlap the standard OGC xsd will create the presuppost
(AFAIK)

   to

   vilate the Inspire directive.

If this is true A Public Administration should not use the QGIS.

This is a realproblem for us that invest many fund on qgis.

So I like toknow the opinion of other public administration.

Before still fund a product that seem to violate the Inspire

   directive

   principles.

Thx,



 To me the question is flipped. What needs to be funded, probably by
EU
agencies to ensure INSPIRE compliance of QGIS Server?
It looks like you've put together the list of what needs to be
fixed,

  so

  the target should be easier. I am little puzzled about not allowing

  for

  extra functions that are not in the standard. Unless the WMS has a

  print

  standard an extra print add-on doesn't break any expectations. Who
knows, maybe that should be submitted as an extension to WMS.


Note, this should have no effect on funding and usage of QGIS
desktop.
Maybe Paolo has good numbers on if EU agencies are funding Server vs
Desktop features.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Mats,

QGIS server wasn't intentionally made incompliant.  It was just extended.

I don't know if any clients actually have problems with the service it offers,
but those extensions actually make the validation of the GetCapabilities
response fail.  But the validation is a expensive process anyway and therefore
most clients skip to validate and just use the response as is.  That should
work fine and so the invalidity of the response is probably a non-issue for
most applications - and therefore went unnoticed (by wms clients and us) for
quite a while.

But extending the GetCapabilities response it also covered by the spec, so that
itself isn't a problem either.   It's just that the response needs to include
another pointer to a document that describes the extensions and make validating
the response document possible again.  Only that part was missing in QGIS.

Currently QGIS server offers GetLegendGraphic, GetStyles and GetPrint as
extended requests.  I'm not an XML expert (the GetCapabilities response is in
XML), but including such an reference document seems to always introduce a new
namespace and therefore extended requests always need to have a (namespace)
prefix.  So eg. GetPrint should be qgis:GetPrint instead.  That's currently
also not the case.

So to fix this, we need to add prefixes, but that in turn might break clients
that currently rely on the prefixless version.  I don't know if there are any -
but it makes me hesitant to change it.

Anyway, the spec apparently allows to have the OGC schema at a different spot
and doesn't clearly state that the copy needs to be identical - just probibits
that "the normative content of the schema is changed".   The current solution
(which admittly has a smell) is that there is a document on qgis.org, that the
qgis server response references instead of the OGC original and that document
includes the original schema (by reference) and adds the extended requests the
usual way, but in the process avoiding the prefix.

If that complies with the quote above, we're fine now, although we might be
bending the spec a little - but we're not breaking any existing clients and
have validity now.

We can come up with something better once we more about affected clients.  I
suppose the actual players in the qgis server field will join next week.

Hello everyone, did anybody assorted my code and had an idea, where the 
problem can be located. I am so confused about the behavior of this 
plugin. The code you can also find on Github 
(https://github.com/MenschMarcus/HiBo-plugin)

  hibo.py:

# Import the PyQt and QGIS libraries

         # Save reference to the QGIS interface
         self.iface = iface
         self.gui = Ui_hibo ()
     self.gui.setupUi()

     def connects(self):
         #self.dlg.ui.load_button.clicked.connect(self.loadImage)
         pass

     def initGui(self):
         # Create action that will start plugin configuration
         self.action = QAction(QIcon("icon.png"), "HiBo", 
self.iface.mainWindow())
         # connect the action to the run method
         QObject.connect(self.action, SIGNAL("activated()"), self.run)

         # Add toolbar button and menu item
         self.iface.addToolBarIcon(self.action)
         self.iface.addPluginToMenu("&HiBo", self.action)

     def unload(self):
         # Remove the plugin menu item and icon
         self.iface.removePluginMenu("&HiBo",self.action)
         self.iface.removeToolBarIcon(self.action)

     # run method that performs all the real work
     def run(self):
         # show the dialog
         self.gui.show()
     #print os.getcwd()
         result = self.gui.exec_()
         # See if OK was pressed

Hi,
The last response of Jef in the ticket explain clearly what it the
strateguy of qgis.The important is tobe compatible with other software GS.
Thie mean the QGIS-server don't metter for real wms compatibility and
interoperability.

I guess is not really clear that the XML response to GetCapabilities is a
protocol tocommunication between system.
It is not only for other gis softwar.
It is for every system can need to ask to the server wms.
The response need to be aboslutely compatible tobe really interoperable.

As example:
this simplest case:
http://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/servizi/wms/OFC.htm
Tis html page is product autocatically from an our system Not gis that call
the mapserver and with an xslt that parse the XML response produce this
html page periodically.

also thi
http://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/servizi/wms/INFRASTRUTTURE_E_PRESIDI.htm
and this
http://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/servizi/wms/CTR.htm
and so on

Also we could use the same mechanism to implement a B2B colloquial betwen a
metadato system and other systems or to the wms server.

This mean to be interoprability. Mean grant to work with every other system
that work with the same specs (WMS spacs in this case),
not only with other GIS software.
The server wms is not only a "maps-dispenser".

This page
http://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/servizi/wfs/html/comuni.html

is product from another xslt proc that again parse a WFS response from a
TinyOWS system (please notice also the wfs of qgis-server is not complaint
to specs)

This is an automatically parse of a wfs request to a tinyows that return
the list of cadastral parcels and propose this page.
http://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/servizi/wfs/html/elenco_foglicat.html?com=047001

This is the list of street of a single comunity
http://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/servizi/wfs/html/elenco_strade.html?com=047001

And clicking on one of them you can jump to the system webgis to see them.

Or you can have the civic number of every street.

http://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/servizi/wfs/html/elenco_civici.html?com=047001&codtop=RT04700110007TO

or jump to a webgis to see them.
http://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/fototeca.html?codtpn=-91175&idtpn=21203

All of this mean to be interoperability.

It mean to use many system differents but all understanding the same single
set of informations and capable to exchange to each other the same
information.
Is not only a question betwen three or four software GIS.

When I say arcgis or autoca try to explain that could be more other system
that could be n difficult to operate with a qgis-server that resonse a non
standard XML response at getcapability request.

But if the response of qgis group is
we see the main GIS software work and this is sufficient for us.

This mean the QGIS-Server is not planning to be WMS compliant.

I test the response with XMLSpy and see it is not compliant WMS because it
fail when use the official xsd from OGC.

Instead other product (mapserver and geoserver) will pass the test.

If I report this issue and the response is:
"is all okay for us".

This response is more clearly of every other.

Bye.

Andrea.

I not the strateguy of qgis.   I just speak for myself.  So don't mistake
anything I say with what the "qgis group" is up to.

BTW the other ignorant guy you have apparently been talking to doesn't speak
for the group either. But it would still be nice if you wouldn't attribute his
statements to me. ;)

Sorry for the noise.  I'm not constructive enough to get a fruitful discussion
going, so I'll move on to other tickets.

Hi Andrea,

You bring up some valid points that should be fixed/addressed. Obviously
this can be fixed.

However, I would advise to not make a big fuss about this issue and stay
pragmatic and focused. Open individual bug reports for each of the
non-compliance behavior and back it up with references to the WMS spec.
Don't put more than one issues in the bug report but create several
reports for each issue. This way it is easier to address and discuss.

I can maybe help to understand how the GetPrint command ended up in the
GetCapabilities response. When QGIS Web Client was developed there was a
print command lacking. Since WMS did not provide a way to point to
certain pre-defined layout and specify the necessary parameters we
decided to extend the WMS capabilities of QGIS server. The spec (at
least in the days of WMS 1.1 when this was added) was not very clear
about these extensions.

Later, we introduced a request called "GetProjectSettings", which
actually is an extended "GetCapabilities" request - here we can now
extend according to our requirements without having to violate other
standard requests. The GetProjectSettings response contains a lot of
"non-standard" information that is used between QGIS server and QGIS web
client - things like layout information, widget information, data types,
etc.

Now that the GetProjectSettings command exists we could actually remove
the GetPrint from the GetCapabilities response or we could try to be
standard-compliant by using an extension mechanism.

It is not true that QGIS people do not care about standards - but it is
a lot of effort to make sure everything really complies properly and
works interoperable. Even if QGIS would be fully standards compliant it
does not necessarily means it is fully interoperable as the
specification does not answer everything.

You can help to make QGIS server more standards compliant, but you have
to properly document this (with links to specifications) and find a
developer willing to work on this.

I am quite confident that these issues can be resolved.

Andreas

Sorry Andras
thx for your attention to this question, but
I'm not able to do what you say.

The specs:
What specs are you say ?

I have the iso specs of WMS 1.3.0 but they are payable.
Not availables to no one for free.

Instead on internet there are the OGC specs that are pretty equals.
They are free and available to everyone.
I sufficient to goto OGC download and read.

>developer willing to work on this.

Also this is not clear to me.
:)

I have just patched my server.
Why I should pay another to do the same think ?

Probably the problem is that the solution I apply is not so graceful to 
others
:)

We don't need the GetStle and GetPrint command.So for us is absolutely 
not imortant to preserve them.

The GetStyles is not available on GGeoserver and on MApServer , and we 
plan to create a federation of WMS servers
where every users use the wms server it like better.
But surely not plan to use a not standard wms server.
So no interest for GetStyle and GetPrint
command.

So why I should pay to preserve them ?

We pay many really many money in these year for QGIS.
And just now start to pay again because after three month qgis 2.4 start 
with another break that break some plugin we realize some time ago.
And more probably at the next 2.6 release should be again to pay for 
another break.

And just now we have payed to our actual QGIS partner to resolve some 
serious bg on SVG managing and also to support better the SVG on
qgis-server.
These are all ok for us. We are happy to fund the resolution of these bugs.

And I suppose other public administration do as us.

Also we plan some other enhancement to QGIS.
(francly I guess it will be the last)

But I don't like to pay for something that is not interested for us.

I'm capable now to transform my server qgis in a compliant wms server.
I simpli remove the GetStyle and GetPrint from the getcapabilities response.
Is easy and cheap.

I guess the problem to move the GetStyle and GetPrint in an enhancement 
section of getcapabilites should be fund by
who has interest to have a compliant qgis-server but also interest to 
have and use a proprietary solution like GetPrint.

We are not interested to save the GetStyle and GetPrint.

Why I should pay someone else?
To do what I have just do ?

For who interest in my change to code it is easy.
in a unique file .c change three or four row of code and comment other 
7-8 row.

However I put the code sample in the ticket I opened yesterday .
So who interested find all on it.

regards,

Andrea.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] spherical trigonometry
Message-ID: <20140609001243.611b2adb@acerCF>

hi all,

I'm studying for my own amusement, and with the aim of deepening
coordinate transformations, the spherical trigonometry;

I'm building a tool to display the different configurations of
spherical models: point in spherical and / or Cartesian coordinates,
vectors, great and small circles, arcs, triangles, etc..

I follow in this study the text of I.Todhunter and J.G.Leathem,
Spherical Trigonometry, McMillan, London 1914

I think, at the end of the path, turn it into a plugin for QGIS
so that it can facilitate the use in the educational environment;

the code so far available (in standalone version) is published on
	github.com/giulianc/stalt4qgis;

all the advices, contributions and criticisms are welcome;


t.i.a., best regards, sfmbe(*),
giuliano


(*) sorry for my bad english :-)

I was wrong: in our qgis.org/debian-nightly repo there is qgis 2.3 for wheezy, so
most probably 2.4 will be ready for it.
I was writing about official Debian packages, which I think will not have 2.4 for wheezy:
https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=qgis&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all&sourceid=mozilla-search
All the best.

Is there any material about server in the docs yet? On first sight, I
couldn*t find anything.

yes, that was my point: why not having QGIS server docs on general docs?
I realize the scope and target are different, so it may be better to compile as a
different standalone manual, but I think keeping it on the wiki is not a good option.
All the best.

 Postgis and spatialite Layer Dialogs
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_FYsY+==Bkgt5FoMenzeYNWf51OG-8vckF1bYcWWM8fOQ@mail.gmail.com>

While translating the Help from add Postgis Layer, I realized that the
layer selection behavior is not according.

The help says that one needs to hold Ctrl-key to be able to select\add more
than one table, yet in the current behavior every selection is kept when
another layer is clicked.

On the other hand, Add Spatialite Layer Dialog, the Ctrl-key is needed to
select more than one layer.

This happens in both 2.2 and master

Should I open a ticket?

Homebrew builds from source, unless there is a 'bottle' (binary package)
available and the user has not specified special options to the package
(all bottles are made with default options). Homebrew has a great Jenkins
CI setup at github that allows bottles to be made on-the-fly when testing
builds from pull requests. So, essentially, new bottle binaries are
available as soon as changes are pushed to the main repo. Secondary
Homebrew 'taps' (like Homebrew-science, similar to a Linux ppa) will soon
have this integration as well.

Yes, please do. This will help instances where the QGIS.app bundle is
anticipated to be completely or mostly standalone and prepair executable is
bundled, e.g. libgdal.dylib also bundled, like with future OSGeo4Mac and
current Boundless distros.

Regards,

Larry

 From a quick look, maybe the destination CRS of the map canvas is missing.

In a code, I used:

mMapCanvas->setCrsTransformEnabled( true );
mMapCanvas->setDestinationCrs( xxx );
mMapCanvas->refresh();


http://qgis.org/api/classQgsMapCanvas.html#ab7cb4f74b2c21b77783bd1f49f5878d8

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Trouble compiling QGIS on Ubuntu Server
Message-ID: <eebdbde191f1a466d6b1f5dbc8d54a32@carto.net>

Hi,

I am trying to compile QGIS server on a new Ubuntu 14.04 server.

I have trouble around spatialite and ?gaiaVectorLayerPtr?.

The errors I get are as follows:

I set the option to use the internal spatialite in the cmake options. Do 
you have any idea how I may be able to fix this compile problem?

I work on Debina. stable.

I download the spatialite from home site and compile from source.

is surely easy and no problem at all.

I download and use the SL 4.2.0 RC1, but as reported in another thread of
this ML.

There a little bug that ask to resolve manually.
Add a define to spatialite source.

If you use the SL 4.1.1 all go without no errors.

And GQIS-server work very well.

regards,

Andrea.

Hello,

Would it be possible in any case to have the boost + CGAL dependencies 
Optional ?
These two libraries are really long to compile, and can therefore slow down 
the development workflow pretty hard.
As for having an internal boost / cgal source tree, there is a strong risk of 
divergence beetween the internal and external versions, and it makes bug 
reporting and identification much more difficult.

QGIS dependencies begins to be really huge, and this complicates a lot 
compilation and deployment.

Is there a chance for prepair to be refactored so that it only use C++/Qt/QGIS 
internals ? What part of Boost/CGAL is used in prepair ?

I like the modular approach much better, just as postgresql "stack builder" 
does. Having an independant prepair executable tool, which is command-line 
driven, can be really interesting for use outside of QGIS. And then it may be 
wrapped inside processing for QGIS integration ?

Keeping everything modular is really important Imho, and should not be driven 
by packaging issue, which can be sorted otherwise.

Vincent

Hi, furthermore, user experience starts to be impacted on windows by all
those library links. First opening on windows is looooong. Adding other by
libraries will lead to something similar to lauching adobe reader, or other
small tools based on enormous frameworks.. 
+1 for modular approach that loads ressources when the need occurs.

Hi,

With the self-compiled libspatialite (4.1.1) I am now able to compile 
QGIS server. It does not work with the internal spatialite library 
provided by QGIS and it also fails with the version provided by Ubuntu 
14.04 ;-(

Now I am running into the next issue that Apache does not find my 
Postgis-Service definitions. Maybe the Apache 2.4 environment variables 
have a different setup than in previous Apache / Ubuntu Server versions.

Thanks for the hint - eventually I will be getting there,
Andreas

Hm, the nightly builds for trusty apparently work fine.  Did you already try
those?   You could also try to build packages - as that comes with the
configuration options you need.

I guess we can remove the internal copy of spatialite...

I think I remember reading that there are others that were having 
problems shifting to 2.4. Does any of this thread help?

Hi  Giuliano,

I think this link can be useful :

https://code.google.com/p/gpsbabel/source/browse/trunk/gpsbabel/jeeps/gpsmath.cc?r=4619

expecially in  "GPS_Math_LatLonH_To_XYZ"  and the reverse
"GPS_Math_XYX_To_LatLonH"    functions.

... also if is C++  source code  :(


Regards

Roberto

I have tried it, but I work on 2.2 and I think I its only at 2.4. or higher.

I thought, that the changes I've done in the slot maybe not returned to 
the main, for whatever reason, because I work on the same object. But I 
try to change the color of the QgsMapCanvas in one slot and print the 
color in another one. This works. So its not refreshing although I use 
the Method refresh.

Hi all,

I've opened issue http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10523 proposing also a
solution.

May someone confirm this bug and have a look at the proposed solution?

Best regards,

Hi,

I was able to solve the problems.

Seems like only environment variables set by SetEnv in
/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/env.conf are respected.

Variables set in /etc/apache2/envvars or with the FcgidInitialEnv
parameter in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/fcgid.conf seem to be ignored.
Very strange.

My Apache does not behave like described in the documentation. The only
way to ensure that environment variables are seen by fcgid apps seems to
be SetEnv in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/env.conf

Maybe this helps someone who migrates from 12.04 to 14.04.

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Legend tree appears expanded, not closed in master
Message-ID: <53971B02.5030907@carto.net>

Hi,

I noticed that a project that had the layer tree in a closed state in
QGIS 2.2 appears expanded in QGIS master. In this project I have several
nested groups (up to 3 levels deep). The first two levels appear
expanded in QGIS master.

I would prefer if the groups would appear in a closed state as in
version 2.2.

This is probably a side-effect of the legend tree redesign? Is this a
known bug and can it be fixed?

Thanks,
Andreas

I found the problem. In the hibo.py:

             self.gui = Ui_hibo ()
             self.gui.setupUi()

Without the second line everything works fine. I had called two times, 
first in the hibo.py and also in the init-function of Ui_hibo.py .

Thanks for your help =)

It's disputable if the current way is not compliant.

Changing that might break clients that query the capabilities for the presense
of GetPrint if we'd applied a (less-disputable ;)) compliant prefix (ie.
GetPrint to qgis:GetPrint).

Note that this would only apply to the name of the operation element in
capabilities, the actual request wouldn't need to changed.

So it's unclear to me if there are actually any clients that would break.

At least some already use GetProjectSettings, others might just imply GetPrint
without checking GetCapabilities - both groups wouldn't be affected.

The clients that check capabilities would just need to look for qgis:GetPrint
instead or alternatively of GetPrint - and that should just be a trivial
change, when 2.4 is deployed.

Also there are probably not that many clients around that actually use
GetPrint.

I do not think a lot of clients are relying on getprint being in capabilities.

Probably the vast majority of users.

Hi

I agree that most clients will not be affected by a change in the 
GetCapabilities response. However, the release is quite close, therefore 
it will be good to not change the capabilities document now.

After release, we might remove the additional elements from 
GetCapabilities. When GetProjectSettings has been introduced, we did not 
change it immediately to give clients a bit time to catch up.

Speaking about OGC compliancy in general: I heard from developers in 
other projects that probably each product needs small tweaks before 
passing the compliance tests (and not only the validation of the 
capabilities response is tested). So if someone wants to look into that 
and provide (constructive) feedback, that will be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Split lines at intersection
Message-ID: <1402483352652-5145241.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

Using pyqgis I would like to split a line feature where it intersects with
another line. I have tried using the splitLinearGeometry function with no
success. 

new_f = geom_feat.splitLinearGeometry([geom_feat_sp])
AttributeError: 'QgsGeometry' object has no attribute 'splitLinearGeometry'

My end goal is to split a number of selected line features against each
other so that all the selected lines are split at all intersections.

Could anyone point me in the right direction?

thanks
Matt

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Opinion on an idea for plugin - Print composer
	guide manager
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_E5ZbD1fD6PAkQyK2bFw7CzXbFrxXDgOJuioo_K88oEUA@mail.gmail.com>

I have some difficulty in using print composers guides, not being able to
precisely set their position. Normally I zoom in the map to a point that it
really does not matter if it's the value is 10,0001 or 10,0002. But it
feels weird doing it.

My idea would be to create a plugin that would add a panel to print
composer, listing all guides positions (along with the page number and
vertical/horizontal reference).

If needed, one could then precisely set each guide, add new guides, or
remove existing ones.

What do you thing? Would it be useful?

Can anyone point me to API parts that I would need to check to complete
this task?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Hi Alexandre,

I agree that this would be a really useful feature - it's been on my
(lengthy!) to-do list for a while now. However, I think ideally this
should be implemented directly within QGIS, rather than as plug in.
I'm happy to work with you on this if you'd like guidance.

I think I could make it work with python, but unfortunately my C++ skills
are really nonexistent (to learn C++ is in my lengthy to-do list...)

Do you think making a python plugin would help future implementation in
QGIS Core? If so, then I will be happy to accept your guidance.

thank you very much for the info :-)

in fact, the transformation from geographic coordinates to geocentric
coordinates are well-documented in the literature (EPSG Guide 7, many
documents of US DMA and ACoE as TEC-SR-7);

Take note that the software that you have indicated is related to the
ellipsoidal field, while I'm working in the spherical field :-)

many thanks, best regards,

PS: (a scanso di castronerie che avr? messo nella 'versione' inglese
:-)
ciao Roberto, grazie dell'informazione; comunque la documentazione su
trasformazione fra coordinate geografiche <-> coordinate geocentriche ?
diffusa in letteratura, ad es. su molti testi, anche quelli che ho
indicato sopra;
nota inoltre che il software che hai segnalato opera in ambito
ellissoidico, mentre io sto operando in campo sferico;
comunque grazie infinite;

Hi,

I agree - this should go into core in version 2.6 - guidelines that 
behave similar to known drawing apps like Inkscape/Illustrator and a 
guideline manager that allows to create, change and delete guidelines 
with exact values.

Hi,

splitLinearGeometry is private, you won?t have access to it.
You shall use splitGeometry which is public

Hi 

I'm trying to solve this bug: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10520

As far as I can follow this issue there's a problem with mScaleMethod that changes randomly. Shouldn't the scale method treated like in QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayer? (Put it into the constructor and deal with it in the create() and properties() method?)

Hi !

Great initiative !

I agree about the need to be able to place guides precisely, but I'm not
sure if having a new panel in the print composer is the best way to
implement it from an UI point of view.

Composer Items all share the same coordinates input interface, maybe it
would be a good idea to use this same system for guides too. This would
mean to reimplement guides as a regular subclass of QgsComposerItem.

With this, we'd also win copy/paste, locking, etc...

I don't know if it's possible to subclass QgsComposerItem in python though
? (I always wondered but never tried)

Olivier

Works for me - looks like a local problem with your QScintila python bindings.

I have 2.8.1-2 from ubuntu 14.04.

Maybe a problem in the debian package?

Hi 

I set up a new relations in project properties and set the edit widget type to "Relation reference" and marked it as editable. It shows up in the form but I cannot edit the referenced layer (I can edit the layer normally). Can anyone confirm?

I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 and QGIS master.

Thanks for reporting that - there was a small bug when reading older

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Getting center of layer in lat/long
Message-ID: <CAHpqhBOY87Fkr0vC4YG6819+rn9zSZU6+stmnRYFWmf1L+JiXA@mail.gmail.com>

First, long time no see!  Been a while since I've posted to this mailing
list.  ;)

I'm developing a plug-in that will allow a user to use the Twitter REST API
to create a layer of tweets.  Yes, I already know of the articles on the
net regarding how to do that manually.  However, I'm wrapping that
functionality in a nice GUI to shield the lay user from messing about with
code.

I already have the plugin working with specified lat/lon coordinates and a
given radius.  That's the easy part.  What I'd also like to do is have the
user specify such things as "gimme the tweets for the current layer extent"
or "gimme the tweets for just the area in the viewport."  I *suspect* that
these are easy, but my first pass through the available high level
documentation didn't give me a whole lot to steer by.

For the first scenario, I would need to do the following:


   1. get the current layer
   2. get the MBR for said layer
   3. compute the centroid/midpoint
   4. project to lat/lon if necessary
   5. compute distance from midpoint to edge

Step #1 would, I presume, entail talking to the singleton layer manager to
get the currently selected layer.  Step #2 would presumably be available in
the corresponding QgsLayer object.  Step #3 I could use the GEOS geometry
ops to compute.  Step #4 would be a bit tricky since I'd have to first
determine if reprojection was even necessary, and if so then jump through
the hoops to get my lat/lon.  Step #5 I note the existence of QgsDistance,
which I could use to compute the distance from the centroid to an edge of
the layer MBR; doing a flat or ellipsoidal distance calculation would
depend on the CRS of the selected layer, natch.

My nagging feeling is "surely this, or a subset of these, is/are common use
cases" ... and that there'd be corresponding syntactic sugar for
implementing them.  The QgsDistance class is sort of an example since it
presumably handles projection and geometric distance headaches for you in
desired units.

So, does there exist such a set of convenience classes/functions?
 Similarly does there exist somewhere a set of corresponding code snippets?
 (The official online code snippets don't cover these, alas.)

Cheers!

Mark

Hey Mark

I think you are over thinking it ;)

Iface.mapCanvas().extent() will give you the event of the view.
Extent.center() for the middle.

You can transform this using the coordinate transformation classes.

*What was done this week?*

   - Have tested the algorithm of plug-in on various data-sets and the
   result are what we desired and have their topology preserved.

   - Tried to add test suites for the plug-in.


*What is the plan for next week?*

   - Try and complete addition of test suites so that we can focus on next
   steps of the project.

Message-ID: <539EA18B.9080001@carto.net>

Hi,

Marco H. and I are giving a presentation on the new function in version
2.2 and 2.4 (preview).

Is there already a splash-screen for 2.4 (Chugiak) available?

Is https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42637169/splash24_1.png the
latest or final version?

What is the state of the 2.4 visual changelog? If you still need
contributions for the 2.4 visual changelog I could probably also
contribute a bit.

Thanks,
Andreas

It's the latest but not the final version. Gary sent me another map
which I was planning to try and use as a background.

Maybe I'll get around to creating a draft with the new map in the evening.

Message-ID: <539EF492.9020400@carto.net>

Hi all,

I used the inverted polygon renderer for the first time. Cool!

Obviously this is very useful for the serial printing.

My question is: are there other use cases besides the serial printing
that the ones who ordered or developed this feature had in mind?

Perhaps, something in combination with more complex rules?

Just curiosity ...

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi!

You can rename the Layer but the original name still persists ..
So I assume this is the Layer "Name" displayed as "Changedname"

Hi Andreas, 
I'm the funder, Hugo Mercier from Oslandia is the developper. It's the right
time to do some teasing I guess ;-).

 The inverted polygon renderer idea appeared when writing specifications for
an improved mask tool . We will soon release new version of mask plugin that
allows the following:

- generate a ROI layer from current polygon selection, or from another
plugin's call.

- Label features of layers only for objects intersecting the mask region
(several spatial operators inside). Users wish that a lot to do professional
mapping. Unwanted side effect is that labeling is a lot more readable by
giving more affordable space to labeling engine. 

- Automagically reuse current mask style to generate a mask on the fly on
Atlas coverage feature. 

inverted style + shapeburst give crazy cool rendering!
Another positive point, instead of making a big bbox with a hole, as current
mask plugin does, an inverted style allowed a much cleaner solution, and
sounded a lot more reusable.  And now, it's much more clear for the user to
be able to zoom to the layer extent and not be zoomed out far away.

We were unsure about real performances of such spatial filtering, so we
decided to start with a plugin, and share with you..  And, we found that
filtering labels gives less work to pal engine, so the spatial intersection
seems to be less consuming than labeling, for average layers. 

Many thanks to Oslandia Team and Hugo for the hard work. We're about to
release the plugin, Hugo will launch a thread about this, and maybe a port
to core, if you like it.  

I already see what we could do next, like label features only on the parts
really intersecting that ROI.. 

Stay tuned! 
R?gis

A quick tip if you're using shapeburst with inverted polygons - you must
have the "shade to a set distance" option selected, and set a relatively
small distance. Otherwise you'll see shading from the canvas edges (refs
#10570, #9757).

Mathieu Pellerin also has some nice examples of inverted shapeburst fills
used to shade the exterior of polygons in a thematic map - i'm not sure if
he's posted them on the flickr group yet.

Hi R?gis,

this sounds great (I have not tried, though), especially the inverted 
style stuff.
Thinking about QGIS server: Would there be a chance to use what you 
describe to keep labels staying away from the edge of the requested map?

Hi Bernard, 
plugin is coming this week I think.

current implementation adds a In_mask(srid) expression, that can be used
anywhere in style or labeling settings. If QGIs server fill current mask
geometry with a bbox, slightly smaller than true extent, you will avoid
drawing labels to close from the edges. I'm not sure this is the best design
option, it sounds more like a hack to me.
I will let Hugo explain detailed implementation.

Here's a quick example of what the combination of inverted polygon and
shapeburst fill can do: http://i.imgur.com/7n6rxJx.jpg

Since shapeburst fill can use map-based units, the "outer glows"-like
effect of polygons can be spatially relevant, i.e. in the above map, the
glow could represent a specific distance, 2km, within which a growing
impact on local population is to be expected.

Yes, it is already available at https://github.com/Oslandia/mask_plugin
A 1.0 version for the official qgis repository is on its way.

Well, I don't know exactly what is the problem with the labeling part of
the server. This label filtering feature has not been designed for such
a use-case. The current implementation of "atlas with mask" relies on
signals that are catched within a plugin to update the mask layer.
We could imagine something similar for the server, but I agree that
would be a hack.

The problem you have might be somehow related to how qgis clips vectors
before rendering them, as Nyall pointed out
(http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9757)

Hi guys,

Is this issue present also for other languages?

Hi Hugo,

let me explain: I use mapcache to preproduce tiles of my background 
layers rendered by QGIS server. Thus sometimes labels get cut because 
they are rendered too close to the edge of the requested map.
I was attracted by R?gis "Label features of layers only for objects 
intersecting the mask region" and was thinking if one could use that to 
address my problem, especially if it goes into core (needs to be for 
server I reckon). There won't be a dedicated mask layer, of course, but 
I imagined server creating the mask feature otf from the bbox parameter 
of the GetMap request (minus a distance set in OWS server tab).
If you integrate this into core and there might be a chance to use it as 
I described I would be happy if you integrated it in a way that would 
allow to enhance QGIS server to use it.

Hi R?gis,

Thank you for the explanations and for funding it!

I think it is very cool, but as it is an "unusual" feature it probably
needs a bit of explaining in the manual. Esp. if you combine it with the
ShapeBurst fill.

People need to understand that they are styling anything but the current
/ selected feature.

Anyway - it is a powerful addition to QGIS.

I just released the mask plugin version 1.0 in qgis repository. I'll be glad
to have some feedback on it.

We still need to document it, what will be done in github dedicated wiki.

Documenting inverted polygon renderer should be done in qgis main doc. How
do we proceed to add sections in it? 

Cheers, 
R?gis

Hi Anita

I am a bit late to join the discussion, but anyway... I cannot really
replicate the slowness you are experiencing. I can see some slowdown
which I assume is mainly related to the labeling - in 2.4 there have
been some changes that will likely slow down labeling even more - e.g.
checking of validity of polygons (due to issues with invalid polygons
from simplification) and the subsequent fixing with buffer.

For a good comparison, I would suggest to have a look where the
slowness really comes from. Apart from labeling, there could be many
more factors affecting the speed - data-defined symbology, expressions
in rule-based renderer, used symbol layers, reprojections etc.

Generally speaking, we should try to handle the performance
regressions more seriously - in the process of adding new features it
is easy to introduce something that negatively affects the rendering
speed. Radim has done some effort to build a benchmarking system for
QGIS some time ago, maybe it is time to bring it back to life and
start watching it more closely.

Btw. nice project for testing purposes. The multipolygons layer
contains a bunch of invalid geometries, it helped to find bugs in some
of the new features :-)

Regards
Martin

	requirement to GEOS >= 3.1.0
Message-ID: <201406172237.42801.even.rouault@mines-paris.org>

Hi,

I've submitted the following (big in terme of lines changed, but mostly 
boring) pull request https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1461 :
"""
Currently QGIS uses the 'classic' GEOS API that uses a global context.
This can conflict with libraries that would also use the global context
and potentially finalize it whereas QGIS will still use it later.

See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spatialite-users/9YSU6c5AVQ4 for
such an example of such a recent issue with Spatialite.

The _r API is available since GEOS 3.1.0, which is already an ancient GEOS
version. For example, old-old-stable Ubuntu (Lucid 10.04) and Debian (squeeze)
ship with GEOS 3.1.0 or later.

Such move has also been done in GDAL 1.11
(http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2013-August/036877.html)
and MapServer 7.0 (mapserver/mapserver#4733)

There's no easy way unfortunately to check at compile time that you don't
use the non _r API. I have patched my geos_c.h header to #ifdef that API 
(quite painfull to do..). A postprocessing check can be done however with :

objdump -T output/lib/*.so | grep -v Base | grep GEOS | grep -v _r | grep -v 
"_ZN" | grep -v GEOSversion

It should return nothing.

To test the conditional branches on GEOS versions for advanced GEOS features, 
compile-tested by simulating GEOS 3.1.0 and GEOS 3.4.2
"""

One thing that comes to mind is if QGIS might use GEOS concurrently from 
multiple threads. If so, then this patch will not improve (nor worsen) the 
situation with respect to potential problems that might arise from that.

It is possible to assign colours to vector items taking the value (as

Message-ID: <1403087094734-5146477.post@n6.nabble.com>

Good day.

I am new to QGis.
Environment used: 
1. QGis 2.2.0
2. MS SQL Server 2008 R2

Scenario:
I have a thumbnail stored in a varbinary(max) column, that the user needs to
see.
For example: When the user clicks on a water source, they would like to see
the different images that are linked to that water source and the relative
information that goes with that selected water source.

I can get the information to display, but for some reason even when changing
the Edit widget (@Properties/Fields dialog) to Photo and assigning the
height and width to the image box still no image is shown.

I know that the encoding of the varbinary(max) column is correct, because if
I connect a different viewer to the table, the column is interpreted
correctly.

Could you please assist me with this matter?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Failing tests
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash+qJSb5P1rZqfJYJrXdvSkY_9e7=Tr25E5-1_QJbQFrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

It would be nice if we can get the test suite passing before the
upcoming release. As far as I can tell, there's two tests which are
currently failing (excluding tests which fail because of platform
specific font rendering differences):

- qgis_vectorlayercachetest - crashes with a fatal error
- qgis_dualviewtest - fails one of its tests

Are these expected failures?

(Please note - a number of composer tests may fail on some platforms,
but all is well. This is caused by differences in font rendering and
anti-aliasing between platforms. I've got plans on how to improve this
situation for 2.6).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Datum Transformation - parameters for mainland
	Portugal
Message-ID: <1403097219.59323.YahooMailNeo@web122303.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I have an update to the parameters that are in Datum Transformation for mainland Portugal.

After an analysis of the parameters that are currently inserted in srs.db, I think we should keep only the latest parameters that are provided by the Portuguese Surveying Authority (Directorate-General of the Territory), to avoid confusion among users.

So, we should keep only the transformation parameters of Molodensky, Bursa-Wolf, and two grids NTv2 that are in use here in Portugal, one from the Directorate-General of the Territory, and another from the University of Porto.

I already have the SQL queries with the changes that I suggest:


delete from tbl_datum_transform
where source_crs_code = 4207 or source_crs_code = 4274;


insert into tbl_datum_transform (epsg_nr,coord_op_code,source_crs_code, target_crs_code,coord_op_method_code,p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,remarks,preferred,deprecated,area_of_use_code)

Regarding the queries above, there are some codes (epsg_nr, coord_op_code) that I assigned with a sequential number, because I did not know what I should put. In coord_op_method_code, I put what seemed right to me, but please confirm.



Regarding NTv2 grids (http://goo.gl/jDhxJB) I have another doubt here. On Linux, these files are placed in /usr/share/proj. On Windows, using the OSGeo4W installer, they are placed in ..\OSGeo4W64\share\proj. With QGIS standalone, they are placed at ..\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\share\proj.
There is no possibility of copy the grid files, automatically during the installation? This will make it easier for less experienced users.



However I came across something quite odd. In the Datum Transformation window, automatically arise some strange transformations (red in the image http://goo.gl/iIWOuw). These transformations give huge errors, and I do not understand what they represent.

May it be a bug?

The transformation operation in question (epsg_nr 1571) uses as source_crs_code the 4258 (Geodetic CRS ETRS89), which is used in some target_crs_code transformations for Portugal. May it be an incorrect match between source and target codes? It is because this transformation, and these parameters, makes no sense to me.

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro

Hi Paolo,

I don't think you miss anything but I wonder how you would imagine the 
legend to look like. Besides from the color also e.g. line color and 
thickness can be set from fields or even expressions on fields providing 
potentially hundreds or thousands of combinations within one layer.

The second stage of legend refactoring should bring some ways that
will make it possible to display also data-defined symbology. Let me
emphasize that this work is not meant to implement such functionality,
it will just bring us closer to that goal.

	2.4?
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=zWjTZbcXFX77RFjoyCQVE6Rkf-=Gq=U-oPmruKSHgn_w@mail.gmail.com>

I'm investingating why QWC is giving me problems with QGIS Server 2.4.
I've spot a difference between QGIS 2.2 and the master code which seems to
cause problems during the GetProjectSettings response parsing.

In previous versions of QGIS Server addDrawingOrder worked for project
layers [1] while for embedded layers we had addDrawingOrderEmbeddedGroup
[2].
Now we have only addDrawingOrder which seems to work only for embedded
projects.
The result is that, without emdedded layers, the <LayerDrawingOrder>
element will always be empty.

This seems to cause some problems on the QWC side. In fact now QWC works
only with GetCapabilities, while it worked both with GetCapabilities and
GetProjectSettings before.

Is there a reason for this change?

it has little use to change the parameters in QGIS only.

All applications that use GDAL/PROJ use the same database of CRS. This 
is kept in sync with the official EPSG database at 
<http://www.epsg-registry.org/>

The EPSG database offers different transformations from local datums to 
WGS84. One of these is usually bundled to the coordinate system when you 
use QGIS/GDAL/PROJ. Other software like ARCGIS keeps coordinate systems 
and datum transformations separated.

Latest versions of QGIS allow to use a different datum transformation, 
but keep in mind that software that stores only EPSG codes (like 
spatialite) will use nethertheless the default datum transformation.

If you feel uncomfortable with the default datum transformation, and you 
have "official" sources, you might open a ticket for the CRS databases 
used in GDAL and PROJ. The parameters should be at least in the EPSG 
database.
QGIS syncs with that database after installation to avoid discrepancies 
on your own computer.

Greetings,
Andr? Joost

Thanks Marco.
Done in http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10625

In case the changed logic is only a side effect of the parsing refactoring,
the solution seems quite straightforwars, rolling back to differentiating
between embedded/not embedded layers.

As mentioned on June 3rd, the problem seems to be gone in the new
versions. Of course it would still be interesting to break the
rendering time down into it's different parts.

+1 for watching the rendering speed more closely when adding new
features. The standard settings shouldn't go slower if it can be
avoided.

Always glad to help with some invalid geometries ;-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Pyqgis - join a CSV to a vector layer
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO56n1rvAZbVxwBw9x84K9tyBkaaNicF4P-URaT8ekc66w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

I am trying to join a DBF to a vector layer via python . I can create the
QgsVectorJoinInfo() , set the parameters and add it to the layer :
https://pastee.org/fv55y

When I get vlayer.vectorJoins() , it is filled (3 times, because I made 3
attempts), but when I open the vector layer properties dialog, no join
appears in the Join tab.

Should I update something after adding the join via addJoin method ? Has
anyone a working example ?

Thanks in advance

Michael

Hi, 
this is something we have in our roadmap. 
We were waiting for the new legend refactoring to start something. I will
also wait 2.4 to be released, in mainly do courses and testing by now. 
The first idea is to have a working legend for diagrams both for colors and
size. We also need legend for data defined parameters.. and this is a
completely different approach than classical predefined legend. We still
need to investigate what is possible to do, total automatic on currently
displayed objects, semi automated parsing the whole dataset with manual
modifications.. I also discovered mapserver new legend filtered on displayed
objects..  As said before, we can have so many combinations, with both
continuous expressions on some parameters, conditional expressions, mixed
with several markers in symbols, and with overlapping datadefined parameters
on marker level, and advanced fields on symbol options... can be crazy
unreadable.. or not. 
We probably need to remove those overlapping features in GUI, and redesign
the GUI using labeling dialog model (small widgets with colors when
activated) to make room for that new dynamic legend.
So, if some of you have ideas on how to do that in a clean way, help would
be nice. We can start a wiki page if you want to.
Cheers all,  
R?gis

Hi,

I'm getting an error when trying to compile qgis master on Ubuntu 12.04 (32bits).

The day before yesterday I have compiled without any problem.

Hi Michael

your code works for me. Maybe you have not added the loaded DBF to the
QgsMapLayerRegistry before using it for the join? The main layer
otherwise does not have a way to resolve the reference to layer from
its ID.

By the way, it is not necessary to set "joinFieldIndex" and
"targetFieldIndex" members - they will have no effect.

Regards
Martin

Agreed, the work by Radim should be kept in use.
Anyone willing to do or support it?
All the best.

Hi Pedro

QGIS imports the towgs84 transformations from GDAL and adds a list of 
ntv2 transformations into srs.db.
So I'm going to add/modify the ntv2 transformations (if there are no 
objections from other portuguese users). For the towgs84 ones I agree 
with Andre that it is better to bring it to gdal/epsg level.

Regards,
Marco

Hi all.
The translation of command names and descriptions, and of the help, is available for
several backends (most notably GRASS). However, at least in my installations, the
English version is always used. Is this confirmed? If so, I think it should be
changed, as it is confusing for users.
Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Please give us more time for testing and bugfixing
Message-ID: <53A28312.9010104@carto.net>

Hi,

I hate to be the one asking for it - but I think we need more time for
testing and bugfixing.

We have a very good release feature wise - but there are still a number
of rather severe or annoying bugs to fix (some of them haven't even been
reported yet).

One month is not enough time for testing and bugfixing. People are not
always in the office, then obviously the bugs can't be immediately fixed.

I would propose to have two more weeks for stabilizing things.

Yesterday we had the Swiss QGIS user meeting. We had workshops with QGIS
master. While the features are great, there were still some issues that
need to be addressed. I took notes but did not have the time to do the
bug reports. Will do that today. I would hate to have a release with
these issues not addressed.

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Four month cycle too fast
Message-ID: <53A28469.1050405@carto.net>

Hi,

At the Swiss QGIS user meeting yesterday there were some discussions
whether people can cope with the 4 month release schedule and there were
a number of users who said that this way too fast for them. By the time
they could properly test a release, the next release is already there.

Bigger organizations (government organizations and bigger companies)
have to test a release, package it with IT, test again. They often can't
install QGIS themselves (don't have installation privileges) but have to
ask IT to do it for them. This is a time-consuming process.

I would propose to try a six month release cycle with two months feature
freeze for testing (see also my previous mail about a request for more
time for testing/bug fixing). Even a yearly release cycle would be fine,
if there could be a bug-fix release.

PostgreSQL has a yearly release cycle and it works really well I think -
both for them as a project and for us as customers.

Andreas

You are right. The names are taken from the descrition files, and are in
english. No mechanism is implemented for translating them later, but I
guess it shouldn't be difficult if the translate strings are available
already for GRASS ones.

Except Postgis does bugfix releases and doesn't cram as many new
features. As discussed in great length in previous threads, it's the
pace of new features that makes bugfix releases somewhat inplausible.

I'm not saying that 4 months is right, what about alternating
stable/experimental like GRASS? So that big orgs only think about every
8 months? Really a big org can decide to skip a release if they want.

Every 6 is also possible, the key is timing, right now is a very good
time to release to be ready for FOSS4g.

Thanks for the feedback, since this the first attempt at the 4 month
it's good to get some information from users.

Thanks,
Alex

Thanks. Please note this is also true for help, already available in many languages
for GRASS. This migh be even easier to implement.

They are both mine,

I'll have a look and see if I need to fix the tests or the code, they 
are not expected failures.

While talking about tests: Is somebody still considering / taking care 
of github integration? It would be very handy to have this connected to 
pull requests.

Best,

Message-ID: <CAMB2qw1KBzzO29Vgs93N+N1DY+e+UDdfQsYa2hPwiftdsm5oUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I discovered that if you use QGIS Server along two different project
that share the same layer name.

I.e.:

first project:
  "roads" layer name  ---> I use the postgis table name "roads",
filtered by highways

second project:
  "roads" layer name  ---> I use the postgis table name "roads", with
no filter (all road types)

If you first visit with Qgis Web Client the first project, then the
second you see only highways.
I think that this is due to QGIS Server WMS caching, or am I wrong?

Martin,

Thanks for your answer. Indeed I did not add the layer to the registry in
my foreach loop. I did it at the end (for better performance )
Now it is working, thanks a lot !

Hi Luca,

It is a known issue.

It is not an issue about the layer name, but of layer ids. You have to
make sure that layer ids in all of your projects are unique.

You probably copy/pasted projects and this does not upgrade the layerid.
It is not a problem to have two or more identical layer names, but the
layer ids have to be unique.

I agree that this is suboptimal and should be resolved in an upcoming
version. The layercache should have both the project name and the
layerid to form a unique identifier from both attributes.

Someone needs to either work on it or found this improvement.

Andreas

Hi all.
On behalf of Lene Fscher, from the University of Copenhagen, I'm inviting QGIS
developers to the spring 2015 hackfest in Danmark.
See below for details.
Thanks Lene!
All the best.

-------- Messaggio Inoltrato --------
This is an invitation to come to Denmark in May 2015 for Developers meeting and
Hackfest ? or what it is called J

University of Copenhagen would like to be host for this event.

Our department at the The Forest and Landscape College is situated in N?debo ? 40 km
north of Copenhagen.

In the week from 18.-22. May 2015

We have room for 34 persons and a hostel nearby is more persons would like to
participate.

We have a very good canteen which can provide us with food and coffee
https://www.facebook.com/SpisehusetSkovskolen

We have rooms for working

We have an organization for having arrangements like this

We have students for testing ? they are used to work with QGIS

We have ?Fl?kken? the students place for beer and relaxation

And place for time off in the forest?.

It is easy to get here from Copenhagen.

In April 2014, Victor Olaya and Martin Isenburg visited us for a workshop. Please ask
Victor for his opinion about our campus could be a place for this event.

Hi, 
again +1 with Andreas.

Alex, big corps are real people, trying to do their best to test qgis like
every other community member, and also having to do support, training,
packaging, deploying inside their corp. We often do not have teams of plenty
members on QGIS. Skipping a version for user deployement is an option, but
does not change anything in the fact that we have to closely follow every
version and test it. If not, we have the load reported on next version. 
A too fast release cycle leads to the fact that qgis community looses those
testers and contributors because they can't follow that.. Not sure we can
afford that. 

6 months or  8 months, with a longer Release candidate period is a good
compromise to me. Also, rc period should not fall during holiday periods.
For France, we have august, christmas and sometimes May to avoid. How about
others? Maybe access stats of the internet site could give us an global view
of those period of unactivity?

Cheers,
R?gis

Hi all.
I acknowledge the problem, and I understand well its implications. I think a proper
solution is not having longer release cycles (we had them before, without major
improvements over the current situation), but backporting fixes over to a stable
version, having more tests and QA.
IMHO, this effort should be covered by big corps, who have the power and the interest
to do it.
I'm available to help organizing this if someone is interested.
All the best.

Hi,

Thank you Giovianni and Marco for fixing this.

I discovered the issue as well but was too busy to act or even report in
the past couple days. I did not have time to investigate the problem.

I can confirm that QGIS server and web client (both master) work fine
together again.

Thanks,
Andreas

I'm going to learn more towards a longer dev cycle.  4 months open, 2 month
feature freeze.

Of course I'm also pro stable release but there is less need if you have
more time to fix bugs.

I agree with Victor. We had a great time there and the facilities seemed
perfect for a hackfest (in a nature setting surrounded by forest with a
lake nearby).

http://rapidlasso.com/2014/05/23/first-ever-lidar-processing-model-in-qgis/

Great canteen. Potential for evening bonfires. Green fields provide ample
opportunities for frisbee tossing or some friendly soccer (my deepest
heart-felt condolences to our Spanish friends (-;).

I am confident Lene and her team will make a great host ... (-:

late bugs will always be found, regardless of the time frame for testing. the only
stable solution is maintaining stable branches with backporting, for which we need
additional manpower (= money).
All the best.

Agreed. Bugs are found by users, and users of an official release are a lot
lot more than users of a development snapshot. Also, users of a "stable"
release are a usually more than users of "new" releases.

But the short release cycle is there to avoid the need of bugfix releases -
because we learned in the past that we don't have enough (interested and
skilled) people to maintain the backports and we also miss a scheme to test
them before we apply them.

And IMHO a year too long to wait for new features in a release anyway.

Four months is a compromise between avoiding bugfix releases and getting new
features released.

I'm not sure I really like the "just make new releases and avoid bug fixe
releases" kind of thinking.  There are some places that can't roll out a
whole new release due to possible bugs from major new features, and given
how fast we move this can cause some real issues.

We don't even have to bug fix until next release just do it for a short (1
month) period after the release, so you're dev cycle is like this:

6 month dev (including ~1 month freeze) -> release -> 1 month post release
freeze -> release a bug fix release if needed -> move on.

This means any bugs that might come up can be fixed, and we patch then we
move on.  There is really no need to make 2.x.5 releases, just one would
normally be enough.

I think the main thing is keeping the bug fix patches small so you don't
affect to much code and is easier to spot where there might be issues.

Packaging for each platform is up to that maintainer but that should be
automated as much as possible really otherwise making releases is too hard.

Agreed. When I spot a bug during development I often first fix it in the
stable branches and than forward-port to master, to keep the bugfix isolated
from the new feature.

Hi all,

I really think we are going blind here about the bugfix or not bugfix
release ! At present, it depends completely of the package maintainers. For
example:

* Under Windows : no bugfix
* Under Debian : bug-fixed via branch release-2_2
* Ubuntugis-unstable : not bugfxied
* opensuze : bugfixed I think
* Mac OX : I do not know
etc.
NB: I may be wrong for some, please correct me :)  And please note I really
do not blame any packager. I know time is not a unlimited resource.

I really think it is a pity not to have a bug fix release for some users,
but to have it for others.

I personaly tried the last week to create the build architecture under
Windows 7, and almost suceeded (but still have some build errors..). I
think once you have the architecture set up, it must not be so "manpower
demanding" to run a bash script under Windows, Ubuntu, etc. and create a
bug fix packages (but maybe I am wrong) ?  For example, a Windows build is
created automatically every week. I think the script can be used once every
4 months (or 6 ) to build the bugfix release, for example for release-2_2.

Perhaps we need more documentation on how-to build pacakges for the main
Linux distributions, Mac and Windows. It could be great to have a dedicated
documentation repository on Github about "building QGIS". The INSTALL file
is a good start entry, but does not (yet) describe all the possibilities,
and has no images, etc.
What about having a "packagers squad" for each main OS, and not rely only
on unique volonteers per OS ?

I think the manpower is more lacking about documentation, bugfix release
announce, communication about it, etc.

Michael

I'm agree about the quality of the copenhagen offer, but remember that we
(spain) loosed again the opportunity to host a hackfest due the fact that
none answered from Girona to the offer do the hackfest there!

:| we should plan to self-organize the hackfest using CENATIC (

If for a future edition you need help with organizing a hackfest in Spain,
i will be happy to help.

Also, the french QGIS community seems to be rather active, so if anyone
from it wants to do something here, I will be ready to help as much as I
can. Just let me know about what i can do. I think both options (France,
Spain) would be very good as future hackfest locations.

Until that happens, let's enjoy Denmark ;-)

I just want to clarify one thing about this discussion: we are not speaking
about delaying the 2.4 release, which users are expecting in the next 48
hours, right?

The current state of QGIS master could probably be better, but it's not
worse than 2.2 (of course, that's a perception based on my workflows). So,
please :), whether the release cycle needs to to be adjusted, or not, it
shouldn't be decided and change within 48 hours of a publicly known release
date. As much as bugs are a big issue for end users, being consistent with
the user base is also pretty important.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Redmine statistics
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFdK-UzuVw--TVket=Vf0amsgQN_kGVsMhK53z5y+dvMdw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Do you know if it is possible to have some stats in Redmine regarding
the bug counts? Especially:
- chart of number of currently opened bugs for every day past X months
(ideally displaying proportions of priorities)
- chart of number of bugs opened/closed every month/week/day
- stats about bug reporters - how many of them, how may new ones,
which ones are most active

That would help us to judge the current status of the release and do
some predictions/decisions based on it.

I am thinking of either a module in Redmine - or just to have periodic
dump of some parts of the database to create such graphs with a script
(probably more flexible as that would not limit us to functionality
provided by Redmine.

Who maintains the Redmine instance nowadays - Alex / Pirmin?

Regards
Martin

I said "compromise".  I'm sure that I don't like it.  It implies that it's not
optimal. But I didn't have a better idea - and apparently I also miss all the
new stuff in this discussion - feels like a dejavu.

That means packaging again and again - and that's what I want to avoid.

But I thought about an automated release build when there are new commits in
the release branch and a automated bugfix release after a some given period of
time without any new commits.

That period should be long enough to make it likely that potentially newly
introduced issues by the bugfix are spotted and fixed (thereby restarting the
period) before its over.

And that without further doing except for the backported commit.  But I didn't
find time to do that yet.

7 months is not good as that would move the schedule into undesireable areas
(like holidays) over time.

Um, but I've spoken to most of the debian, ubuntu, ubuntugis, windows
maintainers and they all agree with me - I think they already have don't a good
job to automated it a good deal, but it's still not fully automated and
therefore they are not comfortable with doing it again and again.  ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.3 credentials problem
Message-ID: <7A378D6A-06EA-4452-96EA-B7DDD3EA9A00@yahoo.com>

Hello,

Since 2.3 got out, QGIS asks the credentials for the database connection from time to time (sometimes, instead of credentials box the project simply freezes).
Is there an option to turn this off that I didn?t notice?

I see that no one else has reported this.

Another thing that I had noticed is that when I open the project with 2.3 Master I get asked for credentials at the beginning (normal) and right at the end (not normal). In Dufour I only get asked once ? as it should be.
I noticed that this happens after 60 seconds of not doing anything.

As an ultimate solution I will recreate all the project from scratch but it will take a big chunk of time.

All the best,

Tudor

PS. Windows 64, osgeo4w 32 bit, both 2.2 and master installed

Hi,

I'd like to add to the discussion that there will be more organizations
investing in bug-fixing in the future. Yesterday, a Swiss canton told me
that they will invest 5000 CHF each year in QA/bugfixing in the future.
I am pretty sure that more organizations will follow.

This means that more developers will be able to work on paid bugfixing
(e.g. 3-4 devs working each 1-2 weeks for each release). I think that
this will help a lot to raise the quality.

But it is important that we will provide bug-fix releases and that there
is a reasonable time available for testing. The short releases do not
help at all for organizations - because each new release introduces more
and different bugs.

We users need bug-free software more than a predictable release date. We
don't need QGIS at an exact specific time. But we cannot accept that
some features are broken that are key to our work.

Andreas

It's probably just the connection that is failing.  In that case QGIS shows the
connection error message and prompts for credentials.  But the error message is
not evaluated, so it might not be a authentication problem at all.

The above mentioned resources could be used for maintaining a stable branch, and
backporting.

Agreed fully: that's what Blocker category is for.
All the best, and thanks for this important discussion.

I understand.  Then why not go with 4 (1 month freeze) 1 month post release
freeze.  There only adds the extra month on the end to fix anything that
might come up after that is bad.

Of course I don't want to create heaps of more work for people but if

Of course I don't want to create heaps of work for people but if cutting a
release is a hard process then it really creates a sticky point in all
this.  We need to be able to release as easy as possible when ever we need,
be that be weekly, monthly, yearly.  It really should just be 1) point at
branch 2) package.  Even if the website lags behind.

What are the main problems/stoppers with having it fully automated?  Do we
need resources, VMs for each platform, etc?

Exactly. There is no point having a release if people can't use it.  It
will leave a bad taste, especially if it's rolled out to organizations.

Nothing will ever be perfect but any blockers (provided that they are) need
to be fixed before release. There was one the other day where you couldn't
add a new column which is pretty major.

Good to hear that there are organizations putting money into QA. Thanks 
a lot.

I think there are different categories of users, experimental early 
adopters and organizations going for stability at the expense of 
waiting longer for new features.

To get the best for both, LTS releases may be a good option. One LTS 
branch every 8 or 12 months which gets fixes backported and 1 or 2 
other releases in between which work the way we currently have it.

Advantages are
New features get tested in the in-between releases (they will get used 
because they are not called experimental or testing or rc).
Big organizations use the same LTS release (in comparison to the 
general advice of "take every second release" which will bring one org 
to use the Jun release and the other one the Feb release) and can 
collaborate with bugfixing
Backports of bugfixes have always to be done for one specific/defined 
version. (In comparison: if a company skips release 2.6 they are still 
with 2.4 in the 2.7 period, and nobody will backport to 2.4 at that 
stage)

Best,
Matthias

Hi all.
Apparently items whose classification name includes high ASCII (??? etc.) are drawn
and shown in the legend, but not on the map:

http://213.136.126.133:8080/www/index.php/view/map/?repository=abidjan&project=abidjan_demo

see e.g. Routes > Voies rev?tues

Unsure whether it is a server or a client (LizMap) issue.
Any hint?
All the best.

Hi,

I also think 4 months is too frequent (users on gis.stackexchange are still
reporting on 2.0 release!), but think anything longer than 6 months may be
too long.

What about this scenario (building upon Nathan's suggestion)?

1)  4 full months of development on master branch (currently is only 3
months)

2)  1 month of testing RC (during feature freeze)

3)  Tag release (e.g. 2.6.0), do NOT create a release branch; then, package
and release

4)  1 month (minus previous packaging/release time) of users testing
release and devs working on fixes directly to master branch (still in
feature freeze)

5)  Tag bug fix release (e.g. 2.6.1), create new branch for 'release-2_6';
then, package and do single bugfix release

6)  Repeat from 1), with any new fixes backported to 'release-2_6' branch,
when resources/funding allow


This allows for a decent amount of development time for new features, and a
good amount of time for testing (both as a RC and after the public
release). The 'stable' branch is not created until the bugfix release,
thereby keeping all devs/testers focused on fixes directly to master branch.

Essentially, it is a 6-month release cycle with a single bugfix release (if
needed) guaranteed to happen 1 month after initial release. The release
branch remains open to backported fixes, but packagers should only
expect/schedule to do one 'official' followup bugfix release. Any further
bugfix releases would be at the packagers discretion.

IMO, this may increase dev work on stability, while not detracting from the
forward momentum of development and not forcing maintenance of multiple
branches, unless sponsors step up to provide such help.

It will also show due diligence on the part of the dev team to focus on
user-reported bug fixes directly after the public release.

Regards,

Larry

You realize that I was just talking about me.   I'm doing all of that - and
that's also why I became RM - because I did't a lot of the release (namely
packaging) anyway.  I just don't do OSX and the non-deb linux distributions.

And it's also not like a package is a huge amount of work and has tons of
manual steps.  I already automated it a great deal (otherwise I would probably
not stand a chance) - but you still have to manually checkout new branches,
wait for builds, wait for the uploads, on multiple platforms and machines - and
not of all of that works flawlessly (sometimes this, sometimes that and always
something new - you know...) and sometimes something is brought up that the
nightly builds didn't show.

Same with the nightly builds, most of the time they works nicely, but every now
and again there's something going wrong that you didn't predict.

Some stuff was improved however - like the disk space issues on our osgeo vm
that made building the debian/ubuntu packages a pain (move to a new host).   I
also finally came to setup a single VM to do the windows (nightly) building
(before I had it one two separate machines).

But didn't find the time to setup nightly release builds in case of news on the
release branch.  Neither for osgeo4w nor for a not yet existing debian

See above.  Essentially it's just time (some larger chunks and a lot of small
ones).

I think that LTS is kind of a really good idea.

At some extent, it's what Sourcepole is doing with its QGIS enterprise.
If we have enough companies paying for such bugfixes & QA, that would be 
easily feasible, but someone should be in charge of handling this.

Then, the cycle is another discussion. It could be either 2 or 3 
releases a year, with 1 over 2 or 3 being LTS.

But I would definitely investigate the idea of the LTS.

Greetings,
Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Printing issues with rotated rasters
Message-ID: <53A2E0F2.80500@carto.net>

Hi,

I have a very strange problem.

I have a map with a transparent gray-scale raster image and transparent
polygons on top of it.

When I export as PDF the print looks fine. When I print directly to the
printer the raster is not printed at all. I tried with three different
printers to eliminate the possibility that this is a driver issue.

All three printer do not print the raster.

-----------

On the very same machine, with QGIS 2.2 - all of the direct prints are
just fine.

-----------

This is on Windows 7 64bit master with the last nightly build.

Can others with a Windows 64bit machine please check if direct printing
of transparent rasters with transparent polygons on top of it works fine
for them?

Thanks for checking,
Andreas

Sounds a lot like http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10599 to me.

Hi,

Yes - that is exactly the same behaviour I am experiencing. Vectors are
printing fine, rasters not.

Later I found out that it isn't linked to rotation. Rasters currently
don't print at all in Win64 - regardless of the rotation.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Getting access to atlas record
Message-ID: <53A2EC05.3060106@carto.net>

Hi,

With the atlas printing I can get access to the atlas feature id and
atlas feature geometry. This is already very powerful.

Question: is it already possible to get access to any attribute in the
current atlas feature record?

My use case would be the one of linked table. Given the atlas coverage
table has certain names or identifiers and a linked table has the same
identifiers. This way I could have simple relations in print composer.
The table could be filtered by common keys with the atlas coverage table.

Is this already possible in 2.4 and if yes how?

If it is not possible I'd like to propose this feature for the next
version. Would be really cool to have.

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Compiling QGIS 2.4 with GCC 4.4 (debian squeeze)?
Message-ID: <CAMB2qw0Smjfrk-BhitMPNG2hdwPAbatNKuadCJAP7v55dqqFYw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to compile QGIS git (after having success with 2.2) on
Debian Squeeze (6.0) which has GCC 4.4.2.

The compilations stops with an make error (see below for error trace).

In summary, GCC 4.4 doesn't like this line from
qgsvectorlayerfeatureiterator.cpp (line 87):

QgsVectorLayerFeatureIterator::QgsVectorLayerFeatureIterator(
QgsVectorLayerFeatureSource* source, bool ownSource,
 const QgsFeatureRequest& request )
    : QgsAbstractFeatureIteratorFromSource( source, ownSource, request )
    , mEditGeometrySimplifier( 0 )

in the corresponding header .h file we have:

    QgsVectorLayerFeatureIterator( QgsVectorLayerFeatureSource*
source, bool ownSource, const QgsFeatureRequest& request ) :
QgsAbstractFeatureIteratorFromSource( source, ownSource, request )
    , mEditGeometrySimplifier( 0 );


it seems that the left part ( from ": QgsAbstractFeatureFromSource to
end) is missing, but adding it returns a preprocessing gcc error.

It's possible to fix this?

If I could chime in as a Non-developer. I might be more of a 
non-standard user (given with all the things I'm trying to do with 
QGIS). I tried to keep up with all the thoughts in this email chain - 
The joys of sleeping in the GMT-5 timeszone (or is it +)...anyway......

I look at QGIS has having four operating systems it supports: Linux 
(debian and ubuntu because I am familiar with those), mac, windows, android:

  * The linux releases only seem to get release once with no bug fixes.
    Really that depends on the distro though...but for Ubuntu I think
    that is correct.
  * The windows release (using osgeo) is absolutely great - it seems to
    be getting bugfixes all the time.
  * I've only installed QGIS on a MAC twice - but from what I can tell
    it might be getting bugfixes between releases
  * Android - I have no clue.


Of course I have no clue how long it takes to release - I compiled QGIS 
once and that was an all day thing for me (adding libraries and things). 
I'm not a developer although I have dreams.

A 5 to 6 month release cycle would be fine for a user (at least for me) 
if there were bugfixes in between. In 2.0 there was a problem with 
spatialite - there was no fix until the next release. It seems (if 
memory serves me ) there was a fix that rolled out on the OSGEO side in 
windows at some point. I went against what I normally do and have been 
running 2.3 for production and it's great (at least from my standpoint). 
I've tried to respond in with reports and what not.

Really I say all of that and I think we (users) are good with whatever 
as long as you guys are happy with it. It seems like this email stirred 
up some uneasiness among your guys for release. Any user (in his right 
mind) isn't sitting there with everything waiting on 2.4 coming out in 
48 hours. You guys are the experts - make yourselves happy. Happy 
developers = better QGIS release.

If I could only add one thing - solidify the releases. Make each one 
mimic the other. Make Linux the same as windows the same as Mac. That's 
the joy of QGIS - it runs everywhere. Right now I thing the osgeo 
windows version (because mostly of sid and ecw support) is the best 
version released. I run xubuntu 14.04 on my main workstation and I think 
QGIS solid - but QGIS on windows seems to edge that one out just a bit. 
Maybe it's because most of the world runs on windows and mac and there's 
a few of use linux users out and about.

Anyway - my 2 cents worth.

Thank you for the work you are doing.

Randy

In Qgis 1.8 there was a blocking bug and thus it would require a
1.8.1, never released, I think, because for the switch from SVN to
GIT. This bug was the impossibility to split a feature stored in a
postgis table, because QGIS tried to duplicate the primary key. So we
remained to QGIS 1.7.4 and now we are still at 2.0 (but we will
migrate to 2.4 if it is all OK).

I'm still in love with 1.7.4.
No other release got so high in patch-level number :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis master very slow saving project & closing
	with several layers
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7yZRiF-e7ZNGRNCvveUEoT=FGQsHG642Ti7A=HVxr3WA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I have a projet with many layers (about 100). When I open it under QGIS
2.2, I can save it and then close QGIS quite quicky (about 2 or 3 seconds)
When I do so with today QGIS master, it takes 5 minutes to save, then 5
more minutes to close QGIS !

I tried with --noplugins option, with rendering turned off, and with no
layer checked in the legend.

Is it a known projet ? You can hardly see it with an average project, but
it is very noticeable when you have more than 20 or 30 layers/

Regards
Michael

Hi all,
IMHO, I agree with the idea of having a LTS (maybe once a year) and intermediate releases for development.
from my working experience, both with public institutions and privates, seems to be more comfortable not to shift from one version to the other very often; pretty appreciated is having one long lasting stable release.

btw: thank you very much for the good job you do every day!

Niccol?

Hi Randal,

Depends on the ubuntu version you have - and if there are packaging related
bugs.

For instance the trusty package was uninstallable (at least the python support)
as trusty (unreleased at the time of the qgis release) moved on and hence the
package was referring to package versions that didn't exist anymore.

To fix that there was a new build from the release branch to solve that using
the current release branch at that point.

Other Packages that didn't need to be rebuild, because they were for stable
releases weren't.

Debian itself also has 2.2 builds that get the backported fixes (and Bas also
backports some fixes we didn't backport and maybe stuff we didn't fix at all -
I believe).   But I Debian will probably stay at 2.2 and skip some upcoming
version.

The qgis 2.2 package wasn't rebuild there either (even when it/I switched from
GDAL 1.10.1 to 1.11).  If you're referring to the nightly builds, than the
ubuntu/debian argument argument above doesn't stick as we also have nightly
builds for those - that would also have the latest fixes.

Only ~20hrs.   Friday 12:00 UTC.

2.2 (or better put GDAL 1.10.1) in OSGeo4W currently doesn't have plugins for
MrSid and ECW.   The standalone installer was made from the same binaries, but
at release time when GDAL 1.10.1 was still default and still has ECW and MrSid
out of the box.  The nightly build however uses GDAL 1.11 which has those
plugins.  And 2.4 will be built with current GDAL in OSGeo4W and therefore will
also have ECW/MrSid support.

That's the point.  For the packaging it doesn't matter if you build a new
release or an old release with bugfixes (one or a dozen).  The effort
is essentially the same.

It just about building one state for a number of platforms.  The release or
bugfixes are already done at that point.

So a new release every four month w/o bugfix release between release is less
effort than a new release every six month with 2 bugfix releases.

Hey - thanks for the explanation.

Like I said - this is just from my perspective - A user who might know 
more than the average user or might be completely delusional (I vote for 
delusional). Youcan see what impressions I get from things - right or 
wrong.

I think whatever makes the most sense for the developers. The users are 
more or less along for the ride and all seem very happy with the 
software. I taught a class on QGIS last week and everyone was sitting 
there (these are all ESRI users) ecstatic that this previously unknown 
software exists.

Whatever is decided - put it on the website. Just let people know and if 
it's a 5 month or 4 month or 6 month everyone should be happy - if they 
aren't ask for donations to speed it up. All of you are packing a 
tremendous amount of time and effort into this - it's not unnoticed.

Again - Thanks for your efforts.

Randy

Hi all.
So, it is confirmed as useless? Should I open a ticket, or maybe even remove it from
the GUI soon?
All the best.

I would not say it is useless - if you have renamed the layer you
could find the original name (on load) there ..

Hi Werner,
sorry, I miss your point. Here the second string is always the same as the first one.
I must be missing something obvious.

I would like to add something else to the discussion, qgis is adding a lot of
new features and enhancements and don't get me wrong I love them, but it
seems bugs are not squashed at the same pace, I get that adding enhancements
and new features is nice and desirable but I would like one release being
just fixing bugs no enhancements and a release adding enhancements plus keep
squashing bugs

*Layer name* could be the name in a postgis table for example, *displayed as*
I would say should work more like an alias, in my opinion Layer name
shouldn't be editable and just be read only as this gives you the name of
the layer in provider, *displayed as* should be editable so people can use
another name if desired, of course by default it would echo layer name

As for hosting a codesprint in France next year (or later), it is clearly 
doable. We could do it in Lyon again quite easily. Paris could be an option 
but is expensive and not that convenient for such an event, even if well 
connected.
We could probably easily organize something in Nantes as well, dynamic city 
with good opensource commitment, 2h from Paris by train.
If interested in any of these places, just ask, and the OSGeo-fr team will 
start to see if something great can be organized.

I was one of the first to propose the removal of SPIT unfortunately is
net yet doable because many have the need to import a lot of layers at
once:

* db manager doesn't do it, and it is dead slow
* the tool in the processing toolbox can work in batch mode but 1) is
slow (if compared to SPIT) and does not auto-fill table names when
used as btach process.

the proposed transformations are OK and widely accepted and used in
Portugal. On the other hand it seems there is little interest from the
official authorities to contribute to the upstream projects/libraries,
so to help average Jane/Joe having those in QGIS will be very useful.

I gave a little overview on available Portuguese datum shifts in the 
EPSG database here:

<http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/45456/how-can-i-see-the-coordinate-transformation-parameters-in-qgis>

Unfortunately, the transformation with the least accuracy is implemented 
in GDAL/PROJ. It would not be much work to select one of the others as 
default. I could open a ticket for that, but I don't have any official 
reference data to proove the accuracy.

The values supplied by Pedro are similar, but they should go the 
official way into the EPSG database. This does not have to be done by 
local authorities. The EPSG registry website remarks:
"Change requests are accepted from any interested party. They should be 
made by electronic submission of the change request and comment form on 
the make change request."

I suggest to raise the topic on the GDAL or PROJ mailing list before 
making a change request.

But I would not encourage to delete any EPSG code and invent new ones 
inside QGIS as Pedro suggested.

Greetings,
Andr? Joost

I want to check with developers before raising an issue, I have a postgis

the updated fields to show up after I toggle editing but right now I have to
close the attribute table and reopen it to see the changes

Is there any use case where having the possibility of opening several times
the same attribute table for a layer useful? Right now when opening
attribute table on a layer you can open n attribute tables if you don't
previously close it.

I would think if you already have an opened attribute table for a layer and
then clic Open Attribute table it should open a new window unless there is
already one open, in that case it should focus the previously opened table
respecting any formatting on it

I think the current way it works is correct.  There have been times when I
wanted to compare the full table to a selection.

Hi, I have some project (saved with 2.2) with some edit widget
customization (hidden field, value map etc).
When opening the 2.2 project in current master the edit widgets do not work
anymore, i.e fields are visible even though they are set on hidden,
descriptions are not shown in the attributes even though the value map is
properly set up....

Anybody else confirms?

Hi Antonio

That would be a feature request for integrating push-notifications from 
postgresql to QGIS. I think it could be possible, but it would require 
changes on postgres side and QGIS side. At the moment to my knowledge 
none of the dataproviders supported by QGIS currently ever sends change 
notifications. Therefore any change in the datasource just appear when 
the data gets queried again. The attribute table makes use of caching 
to be responsive.

All in all: I think it could be possible, but it's not trivial and 
should not be treated as bug, but rather a new feature.

Hi Andre and Marco,

These parameters are outdated. The current and official parameters for Molodensky and Bursa-Wolf transformations are those which are currently in the Directorate-General of the Territory website [0], and which are those that I proposed. 

In addition, the Datum Transformation, at this moment, does not work for Lisbon Datum, because the code of the geographical system used by EPSG:20790 is not EPSG:4207 [1], but EPSG:4803 [2], as you can see here [3].

No doubt that the ideal would be to have these transformations in proj and gdal, but that should be much more complicated, because these projects should get the information from EPSG database, and almost sure that this update, even if it can be requested by us (portuguese QGIS user group), it will take time.

However, doing this update in Datum Transformation, would enable the use of NTv2 grids, and Molodensky and Bursa-Wolf transformations with the latest parameters, very easily (especially if we could place the grids directly in QGIS). I doubt there is another GIS software with this capability!

Regarding the possible bug that I spoke in the original post, what do you think?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro

Hi Salvatore,

did that just appear right now? The changes to the edit widgets have 
been merged a couple of weeks ago already. It would be good to open a 
bug report with a demo project.

Sorry I noticed that just now, I cannot remember the last time that it was
working.
I am going to file a ticket with a sample project!

Hi Andreas,

I've been working on this. I nearly had it ready for 2.4, but in the
end I wasn't comfortable pushing it late in the development cycle.
What I've done is:

- Add an "$atlasfeature" variable, which returns the current atlas feature
- Add a "$currentfeature" variable, which returns the current feature
which is being evaluated (unfortunately $feature is already used for
the current atlas feature NUMBER, which is an issue for a separate
email!)
- Add an "attribute( feature, column )" function, which returns the
value stored in the specified column for a given feature

This allows you to do an expression like:
"area_code" = attribute($atlasfeature, 'area_code')

Or, you can do neat things like label a column using an expression to
choose the column name!..
attribute( $currentfeature, "label_column" )

Hopefully I can push this soon after master is unfrozen.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Expression engine functions and naming
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiaygQ1Wv1JPyOCSJ+t_9s7H1UKEhiQZFNokqVkJFW9Tw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I thought I'd raise an issue which has been on my mind a bit lately,
and I'm not sure how to proceed with fixing it. At the moment there's
a huge lack of consistency in function names in the QGIS expression
engine. Here's some examples:

- Some functions use the naming convention of seperating lowercase
words with underscores, for example "format_number", "format_date",
"color_rgb"
- Others use all lowercase, no underscore, eg "tostring", "wordwrap"
- Still others use camel case, eg "geomFromWKT", "symDifference"

Basically, we've got a mix of every naming convention possible. I
think there's an urgent need for us to choose a convention and ensure
that all newly introduced functions adhere to this.

The follow up question is whether or not we can clean up this mess.
Can we rename functions in a way that doesn't negatively impact users?
Possibly we could have aliases for functions which evaluate ok so that
older projects can still work, but which aren't shown the the user in
the dialog.

There's also some function names & formats which really bug me, specifically:
- "$feature", "$numfeatures". Ideally these should be named something
more appropriate like "$atlas_feature_num" and "$atlas_feature_count",
since they directly relate to atlas variables. From their names it
seems more logical that these would return the current feature and
number of features in the current layer.
- I made a dumb decision when I created the "clamp" function and put
the parameters in the "minimum,input,maximum" order. In retrospect
these should be "input,minimum,maximum"

I'm guessing there's nothing we can do to retrospectively fix these
inconsistencies now?

Cheers,
Nyall

Hey Nyall,

I would like to revisit this with you at some stage and maybe explore the
expression context stuff.  Having one global variable for all this isn't
going to scale if we ever allow bulk atlas export.

Hi,

Yes. When I initially saw $feature and $numfeatures I thought - oh cool
- I can have access to the feature-record - although - as you said it
wasn't clear which feature this would be refering to. This naming is
really sub-optimal and hopefully we can still correct it.

When was this introduced? In 2.4? If yes, there can hardly be any
content using this and I would propose to correct this today before we ship.

As to the other cleanup: what you propose: adding aliases in 2.6 and
then deprecate the old inconsistent function names in a later version
sound like a plan to me.

Hi Nyall,

Cool that you had a look at this already. It would open up a lot of
possibilities.

Along the same lines I noticed that the table in print composer is not
updated correctly when iterating in the atlas preview mode (don't know
if it works when generating the pdfs).

My usage scenario was that I could filter a linked attribute table based
on a spatial query based on the atlas coverage table. E.g. my atlas
coverage table was a polygon layer with communities and my other table
was a point-layer with school and kindergardens. In the atlas I wanted
to filter the table with the schools and kindergardens with the
expression "within($geometry,$atlasgeometry)". The filter works fine,
but the table does not update when iterating.

I will open a feature request for the access to $atlasfeature and a
bug-report for the table update issue. Maybe, if we ever ship a bugfix
release, the table update issue could go in there. It would be very nice
if this bug were resolved.

Again - I really did not have enough time in one month to test all the
functionalities (old and new one). Impossible at least for me.

May I suggest an alternative approach: to introduce dot notation, e.g.
$atlasfeature.area_code - that looks much more like SQL syntax and it
is easier to remember and use. It would require small adjustments to
the parser and evaluator in order to support "nested" objects, but I
think it would be worth it. I could help with that if needed.

This would need some extra care: the expression tells in
referencedColumns() call what fields are going to be used. If we
support thing like this, we need to ensure that all attributes are
fetched.

What about evaluating a column name on the fly though? How could this
be handled? Maybe both ways should be supported...

That's exactly why I held off on this for 2.4 -- I've had to introduce
a "usesAllColumns()" function to indicate that all columns are
required, not just those from the referencedColumns() list. This
requires changes to a wide scattering of code throughout QGIS to take
advantage of this, and not just rely on referencedColumns to determine
the subset to fetch.

can't we use the same alias idea for this?

Regarding clamp, since this was added during developpement phase and 
nothing was released since, I would vote for changing it now.
People using master know this might happen. Just send a mail to the list 
saying this.

It's been around a long time - since October 2012. I think we're stuck
with it for the moment, unless anyone has any novel ways around this?

The function names are case insensitive, so the problem boils down to
with / without underscore. It seems that even in SQL function naming
there is not really a common rule which is the preferred option...

Yeah, we could do that. Later, in QGIS 3 we may remove them completely
and provide helpers for loading of older projects to transform the
expressions to newer syntax.

True. To follow up my previous mail, I would like even more to have
object $atlas with nested values, so we would use dot notation e.g.
$atlas.feature_count

And maybe we should just do more planning when adding new stuff to
expressions. Maybe some small RFCs...?

Actually I like the former syntax - although it seems that most of
APIs use the latter...

Not much I guess. This is very similar to API problems, with the
difference that expressions affect not only developers, but also
users.

Clamp was introduced in 2.2, so we can't modify it now without
breaking existing projects.

Actually the dot syntax would imply on the fly evaluation. When
parsing, it is not possible to decide what will be the content of an
object.

This would be similar to python: the expression x.y means that in
object x it should look up "x" in the dictionary of attributes and
return its value.

I see. Another option could be to have a special column name that
would indicate that all columns are needed - this special name would
be understood by QgsFeatureRequest. That would keep the usage of
QgsExpression same as before, without having to discriminate between
the two cases...

I mean column names which are themselves the result of an evaluated
expression. For eaxmple, if my table was something like:

id, label_with, label1, label2
1000, 1, 'a', 'b'
1001, 2, 'a', 'b'

I'd like to be able to label this with an expression like: attribute(
feature, 'label' || "label_with"). If the column name was evaluated as
a result of the 'label' || "label_with" expression, then the returned
feature attribute value would be 'a' for feature 1000 and 'b' for
feature 1001.  (Sorry for the confusing example!). Could this be done
using dot notation?

That sounds like it might be an easier approach, I'll give it a try!

No, with dot notation you would need to use a proper field name (could
be enclosed in double quotes though) The "attribute" method could
co-exist for these advanced cases - like in Python there is the
buildin function getattr(object, name[, default]) for the same
purpose.

also note that we are in the middle of pulling the atom feeds from Tim's
site and incorporate it in qgis.org:

http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog20.html

There are some todo's :-) But after incorporating the image url's and

I agree with Andreas. Can we postpone the release for a few days?
There is still quite steady flow of new bug reports worth addressing.
I would suggest max. 7 days (without affecting the schedule of the
next release).

Hi Pedro

Added two ntv2 entries and updated two entries, hope it is correct now.

I still feel uncomfortable to delete / update towgs84 entries in the 
qgis db only. I'm concerned this will get a mess over time if there are 
lots of updates (and the qgis.db is synchronized during install with the 
gdal table).
If the updates are very important, I'd suggest the Portuguese user group 
to provide a modified copy of srs.db for people to download.

>However I came across something quite odd. In the Datum Transformation window, automatically arise some strange transformations (red in the imagehttp://goo.gl/iIWOuw). These transformations give huge errors, and I do not >understand what they represent.

QGIS reads all possible combinations to get from one datum to the other. Seems to me these towgs84 transformations are all present in the transformation table (though I don't know the geographical crs related to 30004. Is it 4258?)


 >Regarding NTv2 grids (http://goo.gl/jDhxJB) I have another doubt here. 
On Linux, these files are placed in /usr/share/proj. On Windows, using 
the OSGeo4W installer, they are >placed in ..\OSGeo4W64\share\proj. With 
QGIS standalone, they are placed at ..\Program Files\QGIS 
Valmiera\share\proj. There is no possibility of copy the grid files, 
 >automatically during the installation? This will make it easier for 
less experienced users.

Maybe it could be done in the packaging (location is system dependent 
and there is not proj function call to get the right location).
Budling ntv2 files with the application is a frequent request. We can 
discus thiss further after the release. Problems I see are:
- too large install package if lots of files are present
- requires to check every file license

Problem 2 can easily be solved if a volountear steps up for maintaining.

Regards,
Marco

+1. Stability of QGis 2.4 should be a priority of first class. There's
no hurry to release it soon, since many people will go in holiday in
these days :-)

I didn't filed one yet, I'm trying to understand at what point the

Hi Paolo,

Does the issue still exist ?

I take a look at the map application and roads are well rendering.

Yes, the underlying issue is still there. I kind of solved for that application
simply using an INT field, and applying labels to it.
All the best.

It's probably due to different encoding in desktop (Latin1), server

good catch, thanks.
I think we should handle this more gracefully, however. For the end user this would
be very difficult to solve.

It's a windows issue ;-) but qgis provides the ability to specify data

There was an issue with the credentials - now fixed:

Hi Marco.

>> Added two ntv2 entries and updated two entries, hope it is correct now.

Great Marco, it is working now with ntv2 grids.
Since there is now a duplication, I think you can delete the grids entry with coord_op_code 100004 and 100007.

Yes, this is a possibility.

No, those parameters that have +towgs84=565.04(...) are not associated with any portuguese transformation. These parameters belong to epsg_nr 1571. The only point of contact between this entry and the portuguese entries, is that both uses 4258 (Geographic CRS ETRS89). epsg_nr 1571 uses it as source_crs_code, and some transformations for Portugal (ntv2 grids transformations) uses it as target_crs_code. 



>> (though I don't know . Is it 4258?) 

The biggest mess in my mind is precisely this. Is that, even the possible incorrect match between source and target codes does not make sense, because the geographical crs related to 30004 is 4326 (+towgs84). We only use 4258 for ntv2 grids.

So, these options in red in the image should not show up. I think this problem only happens with the portuguese transformations, right Giovanni?

I can check the portuguese grids license.


Thank you very much Marco!

With which other entries are they duplicated? Seems to me there are no two entries with same source_srs / dest_src / gsb file ?

Not sure what you mean.

transformation epsg:1571 says there is a transformation between 4258 and 
4326 with +towgs84=565.04(...). So this transformation can be used for 
all projections based on 4258 to transform to wgs84 ellipsoid (and a 
second transformation is listed to get from wgs84 ellipsoid to the 
destination datum).

Marco

I can now confirm that it is a conflict with epsg_nr 1571, because deleting this record

delete from tbl_datum_transform
where epsg_nr = 1571;


the problem disappears.

I have tried to create a project with ~120 layers from postgis and
both saving project and closing QGIS are quick. Tested on linux/64bit.
Maybe there is something specific to your project?

I have a project with ~100 layers and did not noticed such behavior.
Both on Ubuntu and Windows.

So apparently the testing phase works out better this time.  Thanks to all the
testers.

Please keep on testing for the coming week as I going to postpone until next
friday.

Maybe we should extent the testing phase to six weeks and use only 10 weeks for
development for 2.6 (or 10+5 or 9+6 weeks, as we're going to start one week
late).

Hi,

Thans for you help, I will try to setup the problematic project and publish
it somewhere whenever I find the time.

coord_op_code 100004 uses the same ntv2 grid of 100014 and coord_op_code 100007 uses the same ntv2 grid of 100015.

The difference is in source_crs_code. The older ones uses 4207, that does not work for Lisbon Datum, because the code of the geographical system used by EPSG:20790 / EPSG:20791 [0] is not EPSG:4207 [1], but EPSG:4803 [2].


So, I think you can delete 100004 and 100007.


[0] http://epsg.io/20790 / http://epsg.io/20791 
[1] http://epsg.io/4207 
[2] http://epsg.io/4803

?

Yes, but that transformation shows up with the following source -> destination:

4803 -> 4326;
4274 -> 4326;

witch does not make sense to me. Deleting epsg_nr 1571, the problem disappears. 

What do you think might be the cause for this behavior?


Thanks Marco!

tfm 1571 is a bug in the EPSG database. It should be "Amersfoort to 
ETRS89 (1)", but somehow the source CRS got wrong.

It was deprecated in 2001, and replaced by tfm 1751 (4289 to 4258) under 
the same name.
For some reasons, EPSG still keeps it in its database, marked 
"deprecated". The online version of the database does not show it 
anymore, so I think QGIS can drop transformations marked deprecated as well.

Usually, ETRS89 and WGS84 are concidered identical. There is another tfm 
1149 from 4258 to 4326 with all parameters to zero.

The transformation table inside QGIS only has those tfm from the EPSG 
database where the target CRS is 4326 (we want towgs84, right?)

So I suggest to set target CRS for all new portuguese CRS to 4326 as well.

For the other bug about Lisbon datum with prime meridian Greenwich vs 
Lisbon, I have to investigate a bit further. Maybe the low accuracy tfm 
now used applies to both within the range of accurancy.

@pedro: I really would encourage you to get this into the EPSG database 
as soon as possible.

Andr? Joost

Hi all,

I have a couple of doubts about diagrams:

* their scale dependent visibility does not seems to work

* while there is a "font" button, this seems to only work with text
diagrams but not for pie and histogram ones

anyone can confirm?

cheers

hello everyone

I really have a problem that blocked me long

I try differnt case (2 qgis PostGIS 2 pgAdmin8.3 postgres 9.1)

is that there is no possibility of installing Qgis and Posgis and postgres

+1 to drop all deprecated transformations.

Yes, I know Andre, in my proposal I put the transformations to 4326, except the transformations using NTv2 grids, since these have been prepared specifically for 4258, and do not use the "+towgs84" parameter, but "+nadgrids". What do you think?

The difference between them seems to me only the Prime Meridian, one is referenced to Greenwich and the other to Lisbon: 

[EPSG:4803] 

Anchor Definition:
Fundamental point: Castelo Sao Jorge, Lisbon. Latitude: 38?42'43.631"N, longitude: 0?E (of Lisbon). 

Prime Meridian [Lisbon]
Code: EPSG::8902
Name: Lisbon
Greenwich Longitude: 9? 7' 54.862" W


[EPSG:4207] 

Anchor Definition:
Fundamental point: Castelo Sao Jorge, Lisbon. Latitude: 38?42'43.631"N, longitude: 9?07'54.862"W (of Greenwich). 

Prime Meridian [Greenwich]
Code: EPSG::8901
Name: Greenwich
Greenwich Longitude: 0?


I also do not know if this has any implications on the accuracy of the transformations, but which I find more strange is that all the transformations are set from 4207. Would, in the past, EPSG 20790/20791 were using Greenwich Prime Meridian, and this was updated recently?

I will do that Andre.

Hi, 
I confirm the font button issue. This is more a GUI issue, this should be
shown only if text diagram is selected. I did not test the scale dependent
visibility issue.

Just use the UbunutGIS unstable PPA, despite it's name.
You'll use stock Postgres/PgAdmin from Ubuntu + whatever the newest
Postgis is 2.1.3 I think.

It's not necessarily more or less stable than other recent combos just
quite easy to install.

Enjoy,
Alex

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis-server will crash on a specific project
Message-ID: <CABqTJk9Ae6iM6E7QOGbtJUCG-KiA+0prUb6E=bpBp9VZEFDWRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a qgis-server that will crash on a specific project.

The qgis-server will run correctly with another project that seem
almost similar (both use the SVG symbols).

The project that crash my QG  run correctly and smootly on a qgis
desktop (qgis-dev) on a windows system.
The project use SVG symbols, but also the other project I test on
QSused SVG symbol
so I suppose the SVG engine is ok.
Also I check t have set correctly the SVG paths.
Also I update to the very last (about 4 hours ago) master version.

After all this check the qgis-server still crash.

So I try to set the logfile, but the log is always empty.
This mean that the cgi qgis-server will crash almost immediatly.

So I set an environment shell to run it manually and to test the cgi
with a gdb session.

The results are this:

The version of libQtCore.so.4 I run on the linux is 4.8.2.

Perhaps the 4.8.2 is too old for qgis-server ?
:/
But another project will run without any apparent problem.
?

Many thx for every hint.

Hi,

I do some other tests.

I take my project that give QG crash and split it in two compementary projects.
Of course I do this using qgis desktop to avoid unvolontary errors.

Testing both of them on QS there is no crash !

So:
The first plausible theory I can give is that Qgis-Server has a LIMIT
to the number of Groups or Layers it can have in a project.
A limit different (and less) than qgis desktop (osgeo4w version).

Is this a plausible theory ?

Thx,

Andrea.

Hi,

I confirm.

There is a layer limit in QGIS-Server

I do a huge test removing one by one all the layers from my project.
And after the removing of every single layer I retest the working.

Aftr a while of time. I reach the limit.

And the project begin to run.

I do other test to exclude that was the number of layer inside a single group.
All the test give the response that seem to be the max number of
layers in a project.

So the question is:

QGIS desktop allow to put more layers rather than how many are
accepted from qgis-server.

This not good for a WYSIWYG system.

Ok, I will try to patch my server when found exactly where is the problem.

Meanwhile,
Now the question is on what structure is this limit ?

I don't guess it is simply a layer limit but perhaps a more specific structure.

Now I have a project that crash , and a project with a one less layer that work.


Doing a DIFF beetween the two projects I see the possible structure
breakable are:

layer-tree-canvas -> custom-order -> item
maplayer
Digitizing -> LayerSnappingList -> value   (type QStringList)
Digitizing -> LayerSnappingEnabledList -> value   (type QStringList)
Digitizing -> LayerSnapToList -> value   (type QStringList)
Digitizing -> LayerSnappingToleranceList -> value   (type QStringList)

I check if in the code there is a limited array dimension for this objects.

Regards,

Andrea.

It is a problem with the layer cache. Will provide a fix for that soon.

Hi,
thx for response.

meanwhile,
I notice that the max allowed layers is exactly 101.
This mean (knowing C/C++) an array of 100 elements.

Searching for this particular value,
i find in the file "mapserver/qgsmslayercache.cpp"
is defined
        mDefaultMaxLayers = 100;

if not defined the environment variable "MAX_CACHE_LAYERS"

char* maxLayerEnv = getenv( "MAX_CACHE_LAYERS" );
  if ( maxLayerEnv )


So a possible solution could be to set this environment variable.

I try and report.

Regards,

Andrea.

This is a short-time workaround for users.

you have right,
it is not a good solution. Too project depending and resource consuming.

It should work now. Could you test with the current git version? My test 
projects are not large enough.

	QGIS
Message-ID: <CABRzcz_t+rODzw6-pV5zNkrGJNQig5gvyntP5Xo0teu7hme4ug@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

*Weekly Report 5*

*What was done this week?*

   - Successfully added a basic unit test for checking whether the
   algorithm is working by running it on the 'lines' data-set which is there
   in the 'tests' folder of the processing toolbox and checking whether the
   final feature count and field names are coming out what we desire.

   - Discussed with the mentors the next steps of the project.


*What is the plan for next week?*

   - To move forward to the next phase of the project, the implementation
   of direction/angular constraint. It would require the simplified lines to
   be oriented in one of the 8 directions (0, 45, 90 ... 360 degrees) without
   disturbing the topology or other characteristics.

*Wiki page : *http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/nishithm

*Code repository :* https://github.com/nishithm/schematization

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Simplify geometry affects $area calculations
Message-ID: <CAFFV8Fh8FZHAHjQP5ZAfqt4joBWx1pvig6DSCLugMUtG2bANog@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I noticed this issue because I had a choropleth map showing population
density (calculated dynamically using "population"/$area). Some of the
polygons changed color when zooming. Simplify geometry, which is
active by default, caused minor changes to the value of $area when
zooming. I think $area should always be calculated from the original
geometry rather than the simplifies one to avoid such issues.
Is this a known problem, or should I open a ticket?
Best wishes,
Anita

Just tried it with a project containing 111 layers here and the WMS 
server works fine for me.
Could you check the apache error log if you are running into a server 
timeout ( fcgid module kills process after some time ).

Hi again Andre and Marco,

I've been investigating and the latest version of EPSG database (v8.4) already incorporates a lot of changes compared to the datum_shift.csv from gdal.

Please take a look here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16FA-X3vkXHeOGPG9dXbIi5HPvUK3AdD_q-h6BwsBRWY/edit?usp=sharing 

And with transformatio parameters:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nBjWKjmz8MoRrQ9J2FAvUMumDMCYOMrbTftyKwvz7OU/edit?usp=sharing 

Is almost everything updated with same parameters that I've provided. The only difference is in tfm 1988.



As you can see, the most recent parameters (green background) use as TARGET_CRS_CODE 4258, but to use "+towgs84", we need to put 4326 as TARGET_CRS_CODE, right? If yes, we can not use the various codes exactly as provided in the EPSG database. We need to adapt them.

Regarding the transformations marked as deprecated (red background), I really think they can be dropped.


Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro

Hi Anita,

While I agree with you in general the difficulty is that if you do
serverside simplification QGIS does not even see the original geometry
anymore. So not easy to solve.

On the other hand you have several relatively easy workarounds. Either:

- disable simplification
- write the area to a new column
- calculate area in the database (e.g. Postgis, Spatialite)

Using $area in symbology isn't too efficient anyway. For each zoom and
pan you will calculate the same areas again and again.

Sorry that I can't give any better answers - just the recommendation
that you should not calculate areas on-the-fly for symbology purposes.

Andreas

Thanks for your answer Andreas,
I've one question though: If the data source is a Shapefile and
simplification is enabled, will the Field Calculator results be
dependent on the zoom? I expect they will be. Isn't that a big source
of potential confusion for the users?
And yes, I do understand that the problem is more
complicated/different when server-side simplification is performed.
Best wishes,
Anita

I guess it is not a timeout question.

To avoid the interference of the server web
I test it running into a shell (a cgi is always an executables)

I guess there is something else.

If I set the MAX_CACHE_LAYERS qgis server run and return the
getcapabilities (I ask it to test)
otherwise it crash.

My project seem to have 164 layers.
But perhaps I count wrong, because
if I set MAX_CACHE_LAYERS = 163 it run. Instead if I set =162 it crash.
:)

Hi,

As far as I can remember from reviewing the code, server side 
simplification is enabled on a per-request basis. So it should be 
possible to disable it when certain parameters (like $area required) 
are met.

Right. Another good piece of news is that when doing feature requests
with API, simplification must be explicitly turned on - so it does not
affect code that does not expect simplification.

My assumption is, that in this particular case the geometry is used in 
the rendering process (hence a simplified version).

It could be checked if an expression used in the rendering process 
requires the geometry (or $area and maybe others?) just the way 
attributes are only requested for rendering if they are used in an 
expression.

Apologies for cross-post from qgis-user - I thought -developer only dealt with QGIS core, rather than also with plugin development.

How do I determine in Python whether each field is hidden? I can't get editType() to work (and know it is deprecated). Does anyone have an example of this using editorWidgetV2Config()? I'm not getting it right:

canvas = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()
allLayers = canvas.layers()
for i in allLayers:
        fields = i.pendingFields()
        field_names = [field.name() for field in fields]
        for field in field_names:
                print(i.editorWidgetV2Config(fields.indexFromName(str(field))))

This just gives me lots of {}, suggesting perhaps that I am not setting the field index for editorWidgetV2Config() correctly. fields.indexFromName(str(field)) works as the *attribute* index for attributeDisplayName(), but the docs say attributeDisplayName(attributeIndex), while they say editorWidgetV2Config(fieldIdx). What's the difference between attributeIndex and fieldIdx?

Thanks

Tom

Hi all,

Does anyone have any thoughts about http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8359 -
specifically, is the warning which shows when exporting compositions
containing WMS layers still required? My gut feeling is that it's probably
safest to leave the warning, but thought I'd get a few more opinions before
closing off that report.

Hi Tom,

The following example should should print the type for all widgets.
editorWidgetV2ByName( fieldName ) will return "Hidden" for all hidden
fields, so for checking simply use string comparison.
editorWidgetV2Config can then be used to access further configuration
options for the editor widgets (where applicable, "Hidden" has no config
options)

canvas = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()
allLayers = canvas.layers()
for i in allLayers:
        fields = i.pendingFields()
        field_names = [field.name() for field in fields]
        for field in field_names:
                print i.editorWidgetV2ByName( field )


I hope that answers part of your question.

Best,
Matthias

Message-ID: <53A8282B.3060409@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Thanks mainly to the effort of Juergen and Giovanni, the bugtracker queue is now
being cleaned up considerably, removing issues resolved long ago, duplicates, and
unverifiables. Keeping the list tidy is crucial to focus the attention on important
issues: if the list is full of garbage, developers will not like to go through it,
and issues will be forgotten.
I'm therefore asking every bug reporter to check again their tickets, and close those
who are no longer valid. Anyone can join in add help us verify the whole lot.
I'm doing the same on my (quite long) list.
Thanks to all.

Hi Matthias

Many thanks for this. It's not working for me quite yet:

AttributeError: 'QgsVectorLayer' object has no attribute 'editorWidgetV2ByName'

Python version:
2.7.5 (default, May 15 2013, 22:44:16) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)]

QGIS version:
2.2.0-Valmiera Valmiera, c3a2817

Any ideas?

Tom

Hi Tom,

That works starting from 2.3 (master) / 2.4 (release/stable)

For 2.2 you will have to work with

i.editType( fields.indexFromName(field) )

This will continue to work with 2.4 (And it would be nice if you could
test and report in case there's a difference between 2.2 and 2.3 as
there's the last week of bugfixing before the release now).

Best
Matthias

Hi Matthias

Ah, OK. I didn't gather that from the API docs. OK, I can print out the editType() value now, which is 11 for hidden:

print i.editType(fields.indexFromName(field))

However, I can't test for it:

if i.editType(fields.indexFromName(field)) != 11

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

I've tried int() or str() to cast the value into another datatype, but with no effect. What am I getting wrong now?

Thanks

Tom

PS  And I shall keep an eye on this in version past 2.2 and report back.

Did you try to compare to QgsVectorLayer.Hidden?

The list of types is here:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing: module duplications
Message-ID: <53A85900.4000904@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
We are thinking about the future of Processing framework. The duplication shown among
modules is certainly a good thing, as it allows richer analyses and more control and
verification, but can be intimidating even for skilled GIS users.
We have been discussed this before, but I came up with the conclusion that a
reasonable approach would be to have three levels:
* basic - only one choice, no overly complex modules
* normal - all well tested modules, minimizing duplication
* experimental - out in the wild, all modules.
This would improve the user experience, and would require less maintenance by core devs.
Of course the selection of the modules for the second category is rather complex, and
would require much thinking.
Opinions?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,
I agree with you, a cleaner organization of Processing tools is advisable
to reduce the confusion in users.
It's rather difficult to teach them in a clear way too! :)

IMHO this reorganization should consider also the integration of other
sparse analysis/processing tools, like the ones under the Vector menu. I
know it depends on their implemention (and its feasibility in the present
Processing model), but it's one of the major sources of confusions or
users. A typical question: why we have the Processing toolbox and a Vector
menu, where some tools overlap, while other are only available under Vector
menu, and so not usable inside a Processing model/workflow?

I hope we will find time (=money) to close this gap and, hopefully, have
most of the analysis tools under the same structure. Well... all but the
C++ ones :(

I've given a look to the list of Processing QGIS geoalgorithms and I've
seen that all the tools from fTools seem to be there. I remembered that
someone was missing, but it seems not to be true anymore. I wonder if it
wouldn't be the case to drop fTools algorithms from Vector menu. It would
help in avoiding confusion, imho.

Paolo, that sounds good to me

The basic and experimental modules that you propose are the current
simplified and advanced modes. We should work on a normal mode.

Let's discuss it here and maybe create a spreadsheet that we can edit to
select the list of modules to include

Thanks for the suggestions!

Hi Giovanni,

some time ago not all FTools modules were available via Processing, but we add
at least part of missed modules to it (e.g. Random Points algs were added about
month ago with Faunalia support). Unfortunately if I'm not wrong
several algorithms
still missed (for example Vector Grid).

But I agree, when all FTools (and maybe GDAL Tools) algs will be
available via Processing
we should drop them and keep only Processing.

Getting to the post subject, I feel it would be more natural to distinguish
between "generic" and "specific" tools. The experimental section could have
the same categories:

- Generic
- Specific (I'm not sure this is the right word...)
- Experimental
     - Generic
     - Specific

With specific I mean an algorithm of interest for a specific domain (e.g.
ecology, hydrology, economy, etc.).
In the future these algorithms could be organized under sub menus, so that
a sociologist would be routed straight to the tools of its interest...

Maybe tagging support will help with this, as same algorithm
may be useful in different  domains

+1  However, I think the menu items should stay for at least one release.
The FTools/GDALTools plugins can be dropped and the associated menu items
in each menu can instead interface with Processing, triggering a call to
the appropriate algorithm's GUI.

In addition, there could be a non-blocking QgsMessageBar that quickly
notifies the user that some items in the menus will be going away, and to
start using Processing more.

Forcing everyone to immediately switch (by removing those menu items) may
be a bit harsh. (I can just see all the issue tickets about missing menus.)
Also, gives time for the docs to catch up with the change, before the menu
items are removed.

Regards,

Larry

That sounds like the behavior I would expect. Should I open a ticket for this?

Hi, I really like the idea to separate well tested modules from
experimentals. I loose lots of time each time testing every module before
finding the good one. Today, I struggled with spline surface interpolation,
some grass 6 modules do run out of memory after 3 hours computing, some saga
modules run with error, but data is quickly generated, some others run fast
and right. 
This raise the question of unit tests, and maybe of a vote/rating system. Do
we have that for processing modules?

Hi,
Using the raster layer provider's identify() function, I can get the
raster value at the specified location. Are there any convenience
functions to do bilinear or cubic raster sampling as well? Or does
this have to be done manually in the plugin code?
Thanks and best wishes,

I'm not aware of such functions exposed to QGIS API, and AFAIK there's
nothing useful under Qt neither...

Actually there is a reason. This release is timed to meet the OSGeo Live
feature freeze to ensure that 2.4 makes it onto the version for Foss4g.
That includes the version given to attendees and used in some workshops.

That said, while the freeze is the end of this month, as long as the
release is out in early July we should have no issue getting it in.
So yes please take another week to fix more bugs, but hopefully not much
beyond that.

For the record, previous Foss4g version ended up with 1.8 instead of 2.0
which is what we're trying to avoid this time around.

Thanks,
Alex

Message-ID: <CAC8_qeZJVtdLuka6uht8XVgqMegThYtWP-zgPMb_piw7nKvpZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Developers

Encountered a very serious problem, looks like this issue is there in 2.x

Ways to reproduce;

1. Add a world boundary shp file in wgs84 (you can use other files too)
http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php

2. Open the print composer, add a new map

3. add scale bar

4. close the composer, return back

5 remove the layer from layer list

6. boom, qgis crash


hope you can fix this soon, thanks


The scale bar issue

1. When a file is degree (wgs84), the scale-bar in print composer is
useless since its trying to use the map unit.

2. Its logical that, in map composer its always linear map unit as in
meter, feet, km, etc

3. using qgis in schools and this pose a serious issue, since the users
dont understand projection etc.

4. the expected behavior is, immaterial of underlying projection the
scale-bar should have the option to use linear map unit, specially meters,
km, mile

5. read in stackexchange, this is a known issue. hope the dev community can
help to fix this one.


thanks a lot.

hurt my fingers, not able to type proper :(

Hi Anita,

There's no such thing in QGIS.

But, you can have such functionality through processing or via plugins 
(e.g. Raster Interpolation).

Anyway, that would be an idea to bring such functionality in core!

Cheers,

Denis

There are QgsBilinearRasterResampler and QgsCubicRasterResampler
classes for bilinear/cubic resampling used for raster rendering. As of
now they operate only on the whole raster image, not with individual
points.

Hi Ted,

I'm not on Win, but if possible can you test this with latest release
candidates, see

http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#location-of-prereleases-nightly-builds

and if that one is crashing, please file an issue:

http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#bugs-features-and-issues

Current dev version has a lot of changes under the hood, but also an
awfull lot of fixes!
So please test the latest version and let us know if that crashes also

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Ted,

I don't get a crash here (Linux/latest prerelease). It would be much
appreciated if you could follow Richards advice for testing/reporting.

Concerning the scale-bar issue. I think, that one should always be
allowed to show a scale-bar, but that the units need to match with the
one in the projection, so in the case of WGS84, the units should be degrees.

Regards,
Matthias

exactly; I have opened a ticket for this:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5377
in fact, we could use tags more extensively, so one user could select all modules
that are, for instance, both stable and forestry-related.

all the best.

maybe we could add tags to modules, much easier to maintain than a separate spreadsheet?
first of all, however, I think we should agree on criteria for the inclusion in each
category; IMHO normal should be:
* well tested (ideally, modules without a test should not be included here, so we can
always guarantee normal modules are working properly)
* non duplicated (never have two modules doing exactly the same thing; choose the
faster and more reliable
* with a reasonable set of options, avoiding esoteric stuff (this may be the most

Exactly, that's what I encounter, and what should be avoided as hell.

Not (yet); IMHO Processing modules and models should mimic much of the structure of
plugins, perhaps sharing some of the same interface.
All the best.

Paolo, I'm not sure I fully understand the proposal. Do you mean to show
the "basic", "normal" and "advanced" groups in the GUI?
I'm not sure it's something a user will understand easily. What is a
"normal" algorithm? I understand your meaning, but I fear it's not
stragthforward, and it doesn't seeme to be the first criteria a user would
look for. Probably I misudnerstood you...

+1; very sensible approach IMHO. I especially like the idea of leaving the current
menu that will trigger the corresponding Processing module.

Please note however that GDALTools have a high end feature not currently available in
Processing: it produces the actual GDAL command, that can be edited by hand, copied
to a shell, and reused in a bas script. We do have in Processing a similar function
through Python scripting, but it is more complex to understand and use.

All the best.

Processing has simple test subsystem and every user can contribute tests to it.
Just run desired algorithm using test data (can be found in
processing/tests/data
or loaded via "Load test data" algorithm. If some data not exists ?
add them, but
try to keep it as small and generic as possible), then open History
and Log dialog,
select command and from context menu choose "Create test".

Unfortunatelly, this test subsystem does not intergrated into QGIS
tests, so tests did
not run at QGIS build time

Hi all.
Could someone draw a list of missing modules? This would help deciding further steps.
Thanks.

Hi, Ted, Matthias and all,

If you enable CRS transform on-the-fly, meter/feet/NM scales can be
shown in WGS84 projects.

About what Matthias said in

> Concerning the scale-bar issue. I think, that one should always be
> allowed to show a scale-bar, but that the units need to match with the
> one in the projection, so in the case of WGS84, the units should be degrees.

In my opinion, despite this is completely true from a formal point of
view, sometimes you need scales in 'real world' units just to make
possible for people to understand your maps. For the most of the people
I know that see my little work it makes no sense a scale in degrees (in
fact, they could have it in the grid labels) but a scale in nautical
miles (or whatever) makes sense inmediatly for them, even if it is not
accurate. So, providing that the person who is making the map should
know what he/she is doing, it is nice for the user to have the
possibility to show the scale in whatever units he wants. Maybe it could
be corrected just using a projection (I guess that's the proper way),
but sometimes it leads to "weird" (in the sense of people is used to see
*their geography* in a determinate way) maps which somehow annoy people.

All the best,

Jorge Tornero

I disagree, the Vector and Raster menus are the Basic algorithms.
Opening Processing is the Normal+Experimental as Paolo described.

Moving everything to Processing just makes it harder to find the simple
stuff. Another major GIS project many of us know took this approach and
it's extremely annoying to sift through 300 methods when you just want a
Clip. 1. Finding and remembering where the tool you want becomes harder,
2. Searching gets challenging with many similarly named things - wait is
that the raster clip or the vector clip?

Not saying a level filter in the Processing box won't be good, just
don't eliminate the simple menus even if it is a duplicate.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi,

IMHO a scale bar in degrees doesn't make sense at all apart from being 
unused to readers of the map. Because one degree in latitude is always 
(uhmm if I recall correctly) 110 km, in longitude this is only true for 
the equator, the closer you get to the poles the less km per degree in 
longitude (until 0 at the pole itself). If you display only a small part 
of the earth you migth manage with two scale bars (lon/lat) but how 
would you imagine a scale bar for e.g. north America?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing: error in v.clean
Message-ID: <53A93757.1020004@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I'm consistently getting an error running v.clean through Processing.
The error layer is not produced (in fact,
/tmp/processing/45d64e93dfee4b52a7229d3fdf2f84e9/ is empty).
The cleaned layer is loaded correctly on the canvas.
Any hint?
Thanks.

Hi Bernhard,

I wouldn't say no sense at all. It strongly depends on the context, but
if you have for example a lesson for geography students and are
introducing CRS/projections and their properties one could want to add a
scale bar in degrees. I agree that it's not very common and most people
are probably unused, but if you explicitly state the fact that the map
is in degrees you might even avoid confusion and prevent people from
trying to compare distances.

Best,
Matthias

Hi all.
Any palns to add http://nathanw2.github.io/qmap/ to master? I think it would be good
for our users to have it straight away, without downloading a different application.
I'm available to give a hand, in case it would be useful.
All the best.

Hi Matthias,

probably this is academical...

But would that scalebar show the degrees for lon or lat?
If the first (lon) for which latitude?
Either of the two: how do you want to tell people that this scalebar is 
only true for North-South (lat) or East-West (lon) measurements and must 
not be used in any other direction? IMHO a scale bar is to enable 
readers to use their ruler to measure a distance on the map in _any_ 
direction.

But adding a scale bar encourages users to compare distances! The fact 
that a map is suitable to measure and compare distances is not decided 
by the map units but by the used projection and the covered area. If 
your map is in degrees just enable the graticules and (if useful) add a 
scalebar in m/km/miles (does that work with degrees? I have not tried. 
If not this would be a feature request.)

BTW: for which point of a map is the scale bar currently created 
(thinking of non-distance-true projections and large areas e.g. continents)?

regards

Bernhard

Hey Paolo,

QMap is dead. I rebuilt it as http://dms-aus.github.io/Roam/

Hi Paolo,
Nathan will provide more information, but QMap has been superseded by Intramap 
ROAM, and is no longer developped. I think that Nathan still does some 
bugfixing for some people still using QMAP, but all new work is being done on 
ROAM  :
http://nathanw.net/2014/03/10/intramaps-roam---a-qgis-data-collection-app/
https://github.com/DMS-Aus/Roam
Not sure it would be a good thing to integrate it into core, as it is a 
separated application, and aims at specific platforms (tablets mainly).

The tagging system would be great, and in the future we can imagine a
system to let a user groups algorithms under its own groups (like favorites
links in the browser).

Vector and raster menus should at least point to the Processing tool
window, in case the algorithm is there too...

I still miss the semantics of the "normal" group. This word doesn't mean
anything to me as a grouping, but I see I'm the only one with this doubt :)

Hello all,

Sorry Matthias I didn't replied properly before to the list, I guess you 
have seen my message later in the list.

Anyway, my point about this is just:

Is QGIS able to add a scalebar to a map in the units "academically 
correct"? It looks like the answer is 'yes' --> COOL!!

Is QGIS able to add a scalebar to a map in **whatever unit** the user 
(of QGIS) wants to, for reasons X, Y or Z? The answer seems also to be 
'yes' --> COOL!!

is QGIS Composer scalebar improveable in many ways? Certainly!!

Look, maybe a nice improvement is make a real **whatever unit** work!!! 
I mean not just meters, feet, NM but also user-defined units. This would 
be nice for those who use QGIS for astronomy-related work, for instance, 
or as micro-GIS... Same should be appliable for mesaurement... just 
dreaming a little...

And, answering to Bernhard about

> If your map is in degrees just enable the graticules and (if useful) 
> add a scalebar in m/km/miles (does that work with degrees?

Yes, you can do it (wgs and CRS on the fly on): See the picture in

https://twitter.com/imasdemase/status/479189061975162880/photo/1

(Sorry I uploaded it to flickr and QGIS showcase but don't know why it 
doesn't show at all)

Best regards,

Jorge Tornero

I tried with province (21 results) the second click resulted in an error.
thanks.

Hi Tom,

I can reproduce it sometimes. Reading the mail I tested, and had Paolo's
error.

In the Log Console (tab 'Python warning')  I had a warning (sorry cannot
copy from the Log Console??):
... csw.py:356:UserWarning: CSW Server did not supply a nextRecord value
(it is optional), so the client should page througt the results in
another way.""

But NOW I cannot reproduce it anymore....
I tried both the latest dev and the latest stable version :-(

@paolo: is it still reproducable by you?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Maybe I am wrong, but I assume that there is no difference. One unit
(degree) will represent the same amount of pixels/points horizontal and
vertical.

It doesn't matter in degrees. But it really matters when trying to put a
scalebar in meters.

Doesn't really make sense to me. Graticules are just another reference
for distances (in degrees in this case) and an alternative or addition
to scale bars. What problem exactly would the combination of a grid in
degrees and a scalebar in meters solve?

No idea.
But if there should be proper support for scalebars in meters on
degree-based maps, then it has to be configurable. And also the two
different scalebars (horizontal vs. vertical) that you mentioned. Then
it could be that there is a small enough area that this can be
considered accurate enough to be useful. And there should be warnings to
inform the mapper that he might be misleading readers and should
consider to reproject.

Hi,
I'm having some trouble with qgis-server and the output in jpeg format.

The request getmap using the jpeg format as not response at all.

I try on two distinct debian machine but the result is the same.

So I guess the most probable theory is the lack of a library or a
library too early on Debian stable distro'.

So I like to know what is the used jpeg library and if there is a
minimal version for the jpeg library used.

Thx

Well, you should try to think about people which may receive positioning 
info in degrees but need to judge distances in "real world" units: on 
ships, for instance (sorry but that's my bussiness...). And remember, 
always taking into account that the area should be relatively small.

Grid in degrees --> Fast  positioning in the map.
Scale in whichever units but degrees --> Fast estimation of distances, 
travel times, speeds.

Of course you shouldn't trust this kinds of map to navigate... but for 
practical uses (survey planning (up to some extent), quick info, simple 
illustration) they are OK and appreciated.

To tell you the truth, in the actual state of the scalebar, all this is 
sort of tricky. It would be great to have it properly implemented, as 
you suggest. But maybe this maps are seldom used by the majority of QGIS 
users and it is not worth the effort and it may perfectly stay as a trick.

Hi,
I do some tests.
Using a shell environment to see any error returned.

I see using the
"FORMAT=image/png"
 the image is correctly returned.
Instead using the
"FORMAT=image/jpeg"
the image is not returned.
But no crash at all.
Simply the qgis-server request will end returning nothing.

Also using a debug session no error reported.
Only apparently return nothing.

... and close enough to the equator to have no horizontal/vertical
length mismatch problems.
In this case (comparing distances in real-world units) another
projection should actually be preferred. Putting the degrees-grid on top
of that in turn sounds very sensible.

Thinking about it. A warning for unsuitable scale bars would be a nice
feature. That could be the shown if the scale varies by more than a
certain threshold over the map. I expect that this would help a lot of
people to even be aware of the risk involved when choosing projections
and to make a conscious decision.

Hi Matthias,

In your mail I attached two files (not for the list). One is North 
America in a Lambert Conformal Conic projection, the other one in WGS84. 
Both show a grid with 10 degrees distance between parallels and meridians.

Well, you are wrong because one degree in lat is always ~110km whereas 
one degree in lon is ~110 km at the equator and e.g. in Zurich ~75km 
(for calculation see [1]). So how many pixels are 1 degree? Depends on 
the projection; in WGS84 it is the same amount no matter if for lon or 
lat, in Lambert it is not.

 >

It does also matter in degrees, depending on the projection. same in 
meters: 1 cm on the map represents always a certain distance in reality 
(though this distance varies troughout the map depending on the 
projection and the area covered). If you look at the Lambert map, you 
realize that the distance between two parallels (10 degrees!) increases 
towards the pole, although in reality it is always (10*110km =) 1100 km. 
In the WGS84 map the distance between the parallels is constant but so 
is the distance between the meridians, but this is false as the distance 
gets less towards the pole in reality. So a scalebar (in m) being 
accurate in the middle of the map becomes less accurate towards the 
edges. Hence my question on which base the scalebar is calculated.

a scale bar makes distances measurable while a graticule helps 
localizing a point. In certain cases (projections) the graticule could 
be used for measuring, though.

I cannot imagine any use case for measuring distances in degrees. If you 
look at either of my maps you see that the south of Greenland is 
apporximately 40 degrees north of Cuba and that Canada covers almost 90 
degrees in east-west direction. But why should someone measure this in 
degrees and not in km or miles? Would you measure the distance between 
your place and your favourite bar in degrees?

all the best

For Lambert neither one nor the other makes sense. The only appropriate
solution here would be some kind of "Lambert unit" whatever that may be.
But for the WGS84 map you sent the original statement above holds true:
the same amount of pixels matches the same amount of degrees everywhere
on the map (In terms of lat/lon, not in terms of degrees on the sphere
though). While a scalebar in km as provided is subject to distortion for
the exact reason you noted.

The question absolutely makes sense but I don't know the answer :)

You are right here. It's not a replacement but a bit of a different
thing (because graticules are not necessarily required to be straight).
So for the ship navigation example before, graticules in degrees for
localization (non-straight) combined with a meaningful scalebar (given a
suitable projection) make absolutely sense. My main point was, that a
graticule doesn't compensate for a scalebar on an unsuitable projection.

That's not the right question to ask. Instead it should be: "Why would
someone want to measure distances on an unsuitable projection, with a
ruler that he has no idea if it has any meaning for the location he
tries to measure?".
The result is the same as when a friend measures the distance to his
favorite bar, find out that it's 2.8 miles and then telling me that it's
2.8 km. I'd rather know that it's 2.8 "units" and therefore be aware of
the requirement to be careful with the interpretation of the result.
Or even better: have somebody warn my friend that he might be using the
wrong tool for the job he tries to accomplish :)

Agreed. But a scale bar is used to measure distances (and IMHO distances 
are in miles, km,..., not in degrees) If a scale bar makes sense depends 
on the projection and the area covered (as I stated some mails ago: "The 
fact that a map is suitable to measure and compare distances is not 
decided by the map units but by the used projection and the covered 
area."). If it does not make sense one should not put a scale bar on the 
map.

OK, total agreement, all is related to the projection, so the maker of 
the map has to use care to choose a suitable one.

Again, its up to the maker of the map to provide a scalebar if it is 
meaningful and none otherwise, same with the graticule.

My two cents, just add/leave the possibility to add a scale bar in m, km, Nm,
whatever unit. Let the user decide if it's right or wrong. A simple and
effective solution is to provide a message stating that scale bars in other
units than degrees are not accurate or something along that line, mainly
just as a reminder for people that may forget the data is unprojected when
in composer

I've been doing some tests and, in the case of NTv2 grids, using target_crs_code 4258 vs 4326, the difference is ~0.104mm, which is compatible with the coord_op_scope (decimetre accuracy), don't you think? In this case, we can simply put 4326 as target_crs_code, right?

Anyway, as Marco already inserted portuguese grids in srs.db, and the parameter used is +nadgrids, we don't need to put 4326 as grids target, because it is already in QGIS and the filter to the EPSG DB will prevent duplication.


Different situation happens with Molodensky and Bursa-Wolf transformations. 

Apparently, the latest transformation parameters are being made available for 4258. Nevertheless, if we use 4258 as target_crs_code, the error we get is huge, maybe because it generate some conflict with +towgs84 parameter.
So, simply changing the target_crs_code for 4326 (no further changes), it works ok.

I did some tests with tfm 5037, and with this same tfm but with target_crs_code changed to 4326. The results were these:
- Tmf 5037 (4274 -> 4258): more than 120m error! (this must be the problem with +towgs84)
- Tmf changed, using exactly the same transformation parameters, but with target_crs_code 4326 (4274 -> 4326): error ~0.292m. 

The question is, inevitably we have to put these latest transformations "manually" in srs.db, right? Otherwise they will be filtered out, because the target_crs is not 4326. There is nothing we can do with EPSG, right?

But then, why are the transformations referring to 4207 when the reference systems use pm=lisbon (4803) (except the new 5018)? This leads to this problem http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9614.

I've been watching this and I get it! The information in the EPSG DB v8.4 is in Degrees, Minutes and Seconds, and when I extracted it for the table, the data in DMS changed the format. The longitude of datum Lisbon 1937 is 9?07'54.862" W of Greenwich, which, transformed to Decimal Degrees, is -9.131906111111112.
When I extracted that field to the table, it did not convert anything, simply changed from 9?07'54.862 to 9.0754862! :)



Regarding the Datum Transformation window, whenever I want to convert something to 4258, through a transformation +towgs84, what is done is, again, a 2-step-transformation:
1) source_crs -> 4326
2) 4326 -> 4258.
The problem is that there are now two transformations in srs.db 4326 -> 4258: tfm 1149 (+towgs84=0,0,0); and tmf 1571, that as you explained already, is a bug in the EPSG DB, and is generating a lot of confusion in the 2nd step of the transformation.

I think all deprecated transformations should be dropped.


Thank you very much!

Pedro

Hi all.
What should be expected if many different users INSERT geometries on the same PostGIS
table? Would editing from one be expected to lock out all others, or?
Thanks for clarifying.

Depends on a lot of factors. Generally updates and inserts will be
serialized and there will be little contention.

Those members variables are just temporary and not meant to be used
publicly. I don't think there is a way to retrieve these groupings.

If the time will allow, I would like to do few improvements to the
point displacement renderer. It would probably make sense to actually
take the clustering out of the renderer and have a class just for the
clustering algorithm that will return the groups.

Right. That's an issue beyond the scope of the database. The database only
knows how to avoid state corruption not logical corruption of the contents,
although it can assist via careful specification of constraints.

Yes I agree, the bottom choice in the Vector and Raster menus should be
something like:
More tools and batch... and clicking it opens the Processing window.

True, but I would like to expand my profile from line script with
these interpolation methods so using other tools is not really an
option.

Exactly, something like those raster classes but working on individual
points would be great to have in core and in the python API. Do you
think this is a lot of work or is the raster code reusable?

Should I open feature requests for this?

Hi Andrea,

It sounds to me like your Qt, when loaded by qgis_mapserv.fcgi, is not
correctly finding the 'plugins' directory, specifically its 'imageformats'
subdirectory. If that machine also runs QGIS Desktop, you can verify your
Qt install has the image plugins by launching QGIS and checking the
Providers section in the About QGIS dialog.

Since Qt has native, built-in support for PNG, it should always be able to
render a WMS request to PNG. If Qt can not load the Qt JPEG image format
plugin, then JPEG will not be rendered.

Just guessing, but you may try setting the env variable QT_PLUGIN_PATH in
the FCGI environment to help Qt find the plugins directory [0]. If the
imageformats subdirectory is missing some plugins, then there is something
funky/missing with your Qt install.

Regards,

Larry

Hi Larry,

thx for hints,

I never suppose the jpeg was due to a plugin.
I check the existence of libjpeg, but never seen for a plugin folder
because I'm running only the qgis-server without any desktop
capability.

Now searching for this plugin folder,
effectively I see a broken symbolic link in the
/usr/share/qt4/plugins  forward a ../../lib/qt4/plugins

It seem like if I'm not install something....
:/

I choose to install many libs from debian repos
also these two:
pyqt4-dev-tools, python-qt4-dev

Perhaps I miss something other lib,
but I guess this should be report by the cmake routines.

Perhaps a missing check in the cmake ?

Now I need to understand what library is missing.
Unfortunately I'm not so skill with qt libs.

there is somewhere a list of all the need libraries ?

Thx,

Andrea.

It's calculated this way:

If you're working in a projected coordinate system (ie, map units are metres):

- Take the current extent of the map, calculate the width (x max - x
min), divide this by the width on paper of the map

If you're working in a geographic coordinate system (ie, map units are degrees):

- Convert the width of the map (map's extent x max - x min) from
degrees to metres, using a variant of the Haversine formula, and
treating the current latitude as the MIDDLE LATITUDE from the map's
extent
- Convert this distance to a scale by dividing by the width on paper of the map

So, yes, scalebars using m/km/miles/etc are only an approximation when
map units are degrees, and are very inaccurate when used with maps
covering a large area or for areas far from the equator.

Not sure what might be missing (or what Debian and Qt versions you are
using), but it seems the image format plugins are part of the QtGui package
install [0].

Probably not a lot of work, still not completely trivial (talking
about bicubic interpolation, bilinear is easy). I would probably use
scipy.interpolate module for the interpolation...

Hi Anita,

I don't know if it can be useful, but you'll find the python code here 
to do interpolation (nearest, linear, bicubic) on single points:
https://github.com/3nids/rasterinterpolation/blob/master/core/rasterinterpolator.py

Cheers,

Denis

if a scale bar is accurate or not depends on the projection and size of 
area (and unit if unit != degree and projection = EPSG:4326 (and maybe 
some others)), so the scalebar may (almost) _always_ be suitable or not 
so this message must be always visible.

Hi Nyall,

thanks for clarification!
However I would say that even if using a projected coordinate system 
(map units m) scalebars are not neccessarily accurate all over the map: 
if your map covers a small area this may hold true but not if you look 
at continents.

thx,
Larry,
your link is really useful for me.

Infact reading it I see that I was searching the plugns in wrong paths.
:)

So I set the right path in the environment var.

export QT_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/plugins

Also I check that in plugin there is available che jpeg library.

but still the map is not generate in jpeg format.

Now I'm investigating to see if there is a problem of plugins version.
Infact I read that qt is really sensible to the exact version of plugins.

Andrea.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugins sort order in page
Message-ID: <53AA96DA.6060901@gmail.com>

Hello all,

Sorry if it is not the proper place to post this issue, but I've noticed 
a minor issue in

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/

It is just that when it sorts the plugins alphabetically, it is 
case-sensitive, so first displays the plugin with initial uppercase and 
then the plugins with initial lowercase letter. While it is a nuance, it 
could annoy the user a little.

If this is not the correct place to post this, please let me know so I 
can post the issue where appropiate

Best regards,

Jorge Tornero

Agreed, it is annoying.
Please check here:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 2.2 project keeps crashing after load
Message-ID: <53AA97E0.7000104@carto.net>

Hi,

I have a 2.2 project that keeps crashing immediately after load - so not
much chance to investigate. The project has some PostgreSQL and a WMS
layer. Testing the last nightly on Win 64 bit build.

Can qgis-devs read something in the minidump file to give me a hint what
may cause the crash?

The minidump is available at
http://webgis.uster.ch/temp/qgis-20140625-112518-1784-4568-39eaff9.dmp

I have no idea what is wrong with this project. It is a rather simple
project compared to others.

Thank you for your help,
Andreas

Hi,

I have some related questions regarding my crash:

* What software are people using to analyze the minidump file?

* During the QGIS crash I see that there are 570 messages in the log
window - but because QGIS crashes I cannot access these log-messages
anymore. Are these log-messages also available somewhere in a file so I
can read them?

The other thing I found out is that I can open the project if another
project was loaded before. But if I open the project from an empty QGIS
session it crashes. This behaviour is consistent. It always crashes when
it opens as the first project and always works when another project was
loaded before. Very strange ...

Andreas

Hi again,

Just before the crash I see the following messages in the log window:

"QPixmap: It is not safe to use pixmaps outside the GUI thread"

same message repeated several times.

Does this ring any bell with someone?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,

Can you share the project? Even without the referenced data this would help.

Hi all.
I'm experimenting with this new feature, and I found some possible issues:
* the file is saved without default extension
* .qlr files are filtered out from the browser, so I do not see an easy way of adding
them.
Am I missing something, or should I open issues?
Thanks.

Nah all good. There is already a ticket for the browser one, and the

Sure. But, MS being part of core QGIS now, I'd feel more comfortable opening it on
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues
Please let me know if this is a problem for you.
All the best, and thanks!

Hi,

Yes - the .qgs file is here:
http://webgis.uster.ch/temp/administrative_grenzen.zip

I changed the credentials of the Postgis connection. The project
contains 5 Postgis layers and 1 WMS layer.

Thank you for having a look at it.

Andreas

It may be somehow linked to MTR, but I would need more info to track
down the problem. I haven't really managed to read anything useful
from minidump files yet - I would be happy to learn from others if
they can.

Andreas, could you experiment with the project file (in 2.2) a bit to
track down the source of the problem? E.g.:
- will it crash if you remove the WMS layer?
- will it crash if you remove composers?

I have just tried your project file on Linux/64 and I get no crash
(the Postgis layers get removed on load due to missing credentials).

Regards
Martin

The way we used minidump files at my previous workplace was to open 
them in Visual Studio, but as far as I remember, to do anything useful 
with it you need a .pdb file (for the particular .exe/.dll version that 
caused the crash), that contains additional symbol to sourcecode 
mapping information.

Best,
Matthias

Hi,

I believe it has to do with layers that have automated labeling on
polygon layers with free or horizontal label placement algorithm.

If I turn off these layers the crashes do not appear. I can then later
turn on the visibility of these layers and it will work fine.

I will try to create a test project with the same labeling settings and
the data in an sqlite db for testing.

When QGIS crashes, I always get the "QPixmap: it is not safe to use
pixmaps outside the GUI thread" message.

Andreas

two useful tricks

1) redirect log to file as stated here
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsLogger.html#details
export QGIS_DEBUG=<level> e.g. 3
export QGIS_LOG_FILE=./qgis.log
in the shell or add them in the settings->otions->system->environments ...
log will be produces using unix EndOFLine so under win you need to convert
log file using something like unix2dos executable.

2) attach qgis execution inside VisualStudio and it will stop at the
crash... but without debug symbols it's only useful to have an idea of the
calling sequence.

my 2 cents,

Luigi Pirelli (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it - luipir at gmail.com)

Hi,

I can only reproduce the issue on Windows (Win7 64bit). It does not
appear on Linux 64bit. Also on Windows it does not happen always, but often.

I have removed all composers, so this is definitely not a composer issue.

I also removed the WMS and it still crashes.

It happens with both PostgreSQL and SQLite as a datasource. It does not
happen with shapefiles as a datasource.

My project is here to download with SpatiaLite 4 as a datasource:
http://webgis.uster.ch/temp/qgis_crashing_project.zip

If someone on Windows could give it a try. It does not crash always, but
often.

Hi Gino,

Thanks for the hints. I will try the thing with the logging. I don't
have VisualStudio - will the free express version help?

I don't know if the windows nightlies have debug symbols enabled.

Thanks,

With the windows nightly build use DbgView.  All messages to the log
should also show there.

Hi J?rgen,

It should crash immediately after loading - if it crashes. No user input
required for the crash.

Here is the output from debug-view up to the crash:

For me for the first time, when I double-clicked on the project (qgs file)
it opens qgis and immediately crashed (windows 7 64 bit OSGEO latest
nightly). I then open the project from within QGIS, it worked fine. And
double-clicking on the project also worked subsequently.

Cheers,
Saber

Thanks for trying.

I just had J?rgen with Teamviewer at my machine and it is quite hard to
find out what causes the crashes.

It does not crash at every load. Maybe every third or fourth time in
average. Turning multit-threading off improves the situation a lot -
there are few to none crashes if multi-threading is off.

When I have layers with free or horizontal polygon labeling on it
crashes more often. So the labeling may trigger the crashes more often
but may not be the cause of the crash.

I'll keep testing ...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Regression in border stylization in a 2.0.1
 project, both in 2.2.0 and in trunk
Message-ID: <CACw3ADjUE4Hbs5=2xj0rUU6HpFHfkinCfOie9YtcLca89RJkiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've opened a bug regarding a regression in border stylization in a 2.0.1
project

https://hub.qgis.org/issues/10723

I've attached a small test case to the bug, in order to easily reproduce
the problem, and obtained results in 2.0.1, 2.2.0 and trunk.

I had several complex project made with 2.0.1 and this bug is a showstopper
to adopt a more recent version, since it would be time consuming to redo
the stylization.

Can someone have a look at it?

Thanks and regards,

Gabriele Monfardini

Hi all.
This: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10723 is not a new issue, and a significant one,
especially for larger user bases.
I think we should provide a migration utility, that takes into account all these
cases and handles them as smoothly as possible. Big users are welcome to fund such a
development.
All the best.

+1 It is not a critical bug in terms of code, but for users with complex
projects (many projects, many layers, etc.), this prevent them from
migrating to new versions because they cannot always find time to correct
everything by hand.

We could create a "quick and dirty" processing script "Fix border for old
projects" which will use some regex magic to read a project file, search
and replace, and then write a new version ? If someone knowing well the
problem could provide a diff between the 2 QML (or <maplayer> items), I
think I can find time to try to help a bit here

The processing scripts are not a real solution - they may help few
people that are aware of the problem and of the script - but the
majority will still run into the trouble. These things should be
solved by implementing project transforms in the QGIS libraries. The
mechanism is there already, just the transformation code for this
particular case is missing.

I agree this is far from the best solution. I was proposing in case we have
no time to debug this before the release. Better do it in core in the
QgsProjectFileTransform class.

Message-ID: <FA49BFC197A78E4D8E7F1200278E5F55D49BF070@fmexch2.fylkesmannen.local>

Hi all,

Just wondered if anything more has happened with this?

As it stands, I get an option for SOSI files in the file open dialog of 64 bit master, but not 32 bit. (SOSI is the data standard in Norway for those that don't know).

In 64 bit, when I select a file for opening, it comes up with another dialog (similar to when you open up a gpx file) where you choose the geometry you want to load from the file. After I have selected what I want and push ok, I just get an error message saying that the data is not a valid data source.

This happens on both mine and a colleagues machine. Does this affect others too?

I have also installed the gdal-sosi package in osgeo4w. I am using Windows 7 64 Bit, osgeo4w for install. Current QGIS version is d4b07a.

If SOSI files do not open in QGIS, we should remove the option from the open file dialog window. Otherwise I think people here in Norway will have a bad experience with QGIS and SOSI.

Regards,

James Stott

Hi James,

and sorry for not having answered your earlier email on that issue.

On Windows I can reproduce your issue too. However, given that it worked on Mac, I suspect this is a packaging problem...
In other words my fault. I shall try to fix it with an update of the gdal-sosi package asap.
Yet, the Norwegian mapping authority mentioned that a 64bit build of the OpenFYBA library would be very much experimental... So no success guaranteed.
If we do not get it workin,g we would probably have to remove the gdal-sosi package (until it works properly).

Cheers
Stefan

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg_J8p+YSTQRTi3k0Qmp4f7gUotKKjjV3qr=eEsgAd916A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

With the impending release in the next day or so I would just like to
clarify what the current plan is.

1) Are we planning on having packages ready to go before the official
announcement?

  Personally I don't think it looks good to have nothing ready for download
as soon as the email goes out because word spreads quick, people hit our
site, find nothing, get annoyed, then we tell them "ohh but you have to
wait until we make packages". A release to us is tagged hash, to users it
means packages ready to go.

2) Is the website going to be updated before/just after the announcement to
point to the packages?

3) Are we holding the feature freeze for a month/two weeks after release in
case something comes up that is a real hurt point to hold off on?

If 2.4 "release" on the 27 is going to be just a email to call for
packages, could it be just labeled as such, don't use the words "Release",
or "QGIS 2.4 is out" because it will go everywhere raising the issues in 1).

I guess that is all, if the questions could be clarified that would be
great.

Nathan

Hi all,

Is someone able to fill in the details for the remaining pending items
in the visual changelog? I've pushed a bunch of headings to the
changelog which have no detailed content. This was a result of a trawl
through the git log looking for things which should be highlighted for
the release. Unfortunately, I don't have time at the moment to take
screenshots or write proper blurbs for these, but I think these
features really should be highlighted in any release notes. Any
volunteers?

It would be quite unfair for us, translators, as we have been promised

No. Just like with 2.2.

When the package arrive the website is going to be updated.  Where necessary,
not all links have an explicit version number in them.  And we should probably
also get rid of those that do - so we don't need to change that just because
the current release version number changed.

No.  Once the release is branched and tagged, master is open for new features
again.  Just like with 2.2.   Fixes can be applied to the release branch -
although there still isn't an official plan if/when/how such updates would end
up in packages.

>>No. Just like with 2.2.

I think this is a real mistake and bad PR for the project.  If we want to
do it like this we need to refine out release plan better to have things
line up nice and smooth so people get what they expect.  The user isn't us,
we can build from source, they can not, nor should they.

dev cylce -> freeze -> no new strings -> 3 days out (or something) freeze
all non package code incl strings -> call packages/update versions/update
site code etc -> (on day) push website and packages -> announcement.

I suggest we need a calender on the website that shows using colors and
date ranges what is happening and when so no one gets a shock.

Here is what the current release feels like to a normal user who is coming
from the outside:

- Gets notified of the release (took about 10 seconds to go on twitter
after you sent the 2.2 email that it was "out" so it was not a hidden
thing, even on the weekend)
- Gets excited
- Heads to website
- "Ok banner still say 2.2 but there is a download link"
-  Click download.
- Run installer
- "oh 2.2. Didn't it say 2.4 was out?"
- *check back for later for you packages* "How long do I have to wait?"
- *........ please come again*
- (Never comes back) or is annoyed as heck
- *meanwhile*
- We push master forward, features flow in like normal.
- "Oh hi I found a major bug in 2.4 is there any planned patched release"
- "Meh"

This is bad PR, even without the patched release thing, a release is a
binary release to a user. A source tarball means nothing.

I remember having to respond to a heap of annoyed people on the QGIS
twitter/Facebook account with "we are currently building package, please
hold"

The close for translations pulled in is tomorrow at 11:30 UTC..
No changes in that.. As the source is released at 12:00 as 2.4..
Don't worry.. Your language updates will surely make it..

Hei Stefan,

Thanks for looking at this again.

Do you know why the SOSI option doesn't appear in 32 bit version?

With the release of 2.4 a day or so away, I wonder if its best to just remove the SOSI option from the file dialog box for the 2.4 release? That way people won't be under the impression that QGIS can open SOSI when it can't?

Don't know if anyone else agrees?

James

Hi James,

and sorry for not having answered your earlier email on that issue.

On Windows I can reproduce your issue too. However, given that it worked on Mac, I suspect this is a packaging problem...
In other words my fault. I shall try to fix it with an update of the gdal-sosi package asap.
Yet, the Norwegian mapping authority mentioned that a 64bit build of the OpenFYBA library would be very much experimental... So no success guaranteed.
If we do not get it workin,g we would probably have to remove the gdal-sosi package (until it works properly).

Cheers
Stefan

Why again a discussion on the last minute?  "The plans has been on display..."

The road map tells users what to expect.  The announcement told users what to
expect.   If they still expect something else, that's their choice.  But IMHO
it's nothing that we need to take responsibility for.

The current plan is easy. Just two dates: freeze and release.   development
before the freeze, testing, fixing, translating, release preparations after the
freeze, packaging and new the next development cycle starts in parallel after
the release.

I think that's easy enough even without a colorful layout.   Although the
roadmap is hard to find on the website (but it's nowhere near alpha centauri).


> The user isn't us, we can build from source, they can not, nor should they.

BTW the users are free to build from source, that's their choice, too.  I think
most of our users are pretty smart (and good looking) ;)

PS: "This must be Thursday" - and I put release on fridays intentionally to
    have the weekend for packaging...
PPS: I wanted to tackle #10703 instead of this - you could have done #10589 ;)

I would bet that most people building from sources are not the ones 
waiting for an announced release.

I agree with Nathan that it's a real bad idea to announce a release if 
people can't use it.
If packaging is done during the weekend, I don't see a real problem to 
wait two days before annoucement.
I would say that having the windows packages ready is a minimum before 
annoucement.

Although, I agree it's a pity that we discuss 1 day to annoucement.
This should be polished for next time, and I would vote for a more 
detailed calendar with
* Feature freeze
* String freeze
* Code + Translation freeze
* Packaging (at least win)
* Release

Cheers,

Denis

Hi

I have to agree with Nathan and Denis. It would me buch better to
announce a release when the packages are ready. I remember that last
time there was some confusion and disappointment by users reading tweets
that QGIS was available and then they could not install it on their
platform.

Sorry J?rgen that we discuss this at the very latest. I was already
happy that we got one week more time for testing/bug fixing.

At least for the next release we should have packages ready before the
announcement. Or only inform developers about the release and then the
regular users when the packages are ready.

Andreas

PS: hope J?rgen does not hate me now for all my requests/ideas ...

I agree too for announcing when packages are ready.
Right today, during a course, I was answering a partecipant wh asked be
about the next release. I've told him it will happen in a few days and I
ansewered: "I hope they don't do as for QGIS 2.2, when we had to go back to
the website more and mroe times, hoping to see the QGIS 2.4 download link
appear"...

That was the first time - it might have come unexpected to the user.  They'll
probably get used to it.

Which packages?  OSGeo4W? Windows standalone? Debian? Ubuntu? Ubuntugis?
Fedora?  RHEL/CentOS/SL?  OpenSUSE, Mandriva? Slackware? ArchLinux? OSX?
FreeBSD?  Android?  All?  Some/which?  How long do we wait?

I rather get the (source) release done, get my packages done (a good share of
the above) and then get back to master...

As said, I think Windows is the limiting factor.
I am not sure about Mac.
But that would be the only two.

For the rest, a "packaging...coming soon!" message will do the job!

Looks like announcing the (source) release on qgis-developer and announcing
individual packages on qgis-user would solve that problem.

I also don't like to have stuff on my queue, that I can't do anything about
than just be patient.   Actually that's exactly why I want the (completion of)
the packaging out of the release schedule.

To me there's not much point in having master frozen, while everyone is just
waiting for packages to be built.

Are you sure it is specifically QGIS that can't open the file? Have you
tried GDAL directly. If there are problems with GDAL on your platform for
SOSI, but it works on others, I don't see how this should limit what is an
available feature in QGIS. It would then require fixing GDAL, or its
packaging, in this regard.

Please verify.

IMHO:

1. do not change anything in the relase schedule just one day before
2. announcements should be clear: (a) QGIS 2.4 is out, wait for packages; (b) package
for {Debian|Ubuntu|whatever} is ready, go and download it from http://...

This should make everyone happy.
I like the idea our users understand more of the work it is being done, and do not
take tha packages for granted.

All the best.

Hi again,

Now I rebuilt the 32-bit package based on GDAL 1.11.0 which is the GDAL version QGIS is build against (the old package on OSGeo4W was built against GDAL 1.10) and tested in QGIS 2.3 (QGIS code revision  39eaff9).
The problem is now the same, James described for the 64bit version. However, ogrinfo gives no error messages and displays the content of the SOSI file and all layers just fine. So maybe it is not only a packaging issue?

James, what does your 64bit ogrinfo say when run with your SOSI file? And does ogr2ogr work for you in 64bit?

Cheers
Stefan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SOSI support in QGIS

Hi all,

Just wondered if anything more has happened with this?

As it stands, I get an option for SOSI files in the file open dialog of 64 bit master, but not 32 bit. (SOSI is the data standard in Norway for those that don't know).

In 64 bit, when I select a file for opening, it comes up with another dialog (similar to when you open up a gpx file) where you choose the geometry you want to load from the file. After I have selected what I want and push ok, I just get an error message saying that the data is not a valid data source.

This happens on both mine and a colleagues machine. Does this affect others too?

I have also installed the gdal-sosi package in osgeo4w. I am using Windows 7 64 Bit, osgeo4w for install. Current QGIS version is d4b07a.

If SOSI files do not open in QGIS, we should remove the option from the open file dialog window. Otherwise I think people here in Norway will have a bad experience with QGIS and SOSI.

Regards,

James Stott

Hi All, 
I agree with Denis and Nathan on the general idea, and also with Paolo on
"don't change things on day before". 
 From a user point of view, I can live 2.2 behaviour, since I already have
seen what "release" meant for qgis project in 2.2.  But, I think 2.6 should
go to a more common definition of "release", ie package release. 
 
Do we have download stats of packages to clarify the minimum list of package
to include in that release? To me , Windows, Ubuntu and MacOS should be the
minimal list. Advanced users of other distros are much more accustomed with
compiling process and are probably better understanding the difference
between source code and package . 

you're doing all great work, don't let the pressure rise ;-).
 Sorry for not having been able to support the final debug, release and
translation process that time... Hope I'll find a way to do that in the
future. 
R?gis

Also try disabling all plugins to see if it is perhaps a plugin listening

1. Surly it's not hard to build the package an two hours or so before the
release and have it ready go, even if this a last minute call. As much as
it pains people Windows is our biggest user base so they need to be there,
followed by Debian, then OS X.

2) There is no different for a user between a) and b) a "release" is a
binary release like I said.  Making it a two stage process is just
confusing and annoying to users.  Trying to make people understand the
"process" by doing this isn't really right IMO.  Users don't need to care
how packages are built or how long it takes, the people that know or need
too tend to be involved at the project level anyway. Users just need a
package to install on release day, a "source" release is like say "yay
release!....But no you can't have it because your just a user you have to
wait".

J?rgen,

Looks like announcing the (source) release on qgis-developer and announcing
> individual packages on qgis-user would solve that problem.


This will make no difference, people watch the dev list especially around
release time for news. Once you announce any kind of "release", source or
not, you have lost the ability to control where it will go and what people
expect. Just watch how quick it will hit twitter, and then watch as people
get confused why there is no download. It's mainly wording, it's all in the
wording.

People really like our software and some are super excited about the
release, to not have packages for download really looks bad IMO.

To me there's not much point in having master frozen, while everyone is just
> waiting for packages to be built.


That is why I said it would only be a day or so before release, it
shouldn't take more then day to build a package for any of the major
platforms and update the site. All we would have to do is branch the code a
day out, package, release.  If you push something non package related on
that last day before the release then it will just have to wait until next
release, or a patched release. People can't be pushing fixes last second as
that is just dangerous.

That was the first time - it might have come unexpected to the user.
>  They'll
> probably get used to it..


They shouldn't that is the point I'm making.  We don't expect that with
other things.  If I see a new release of Python is out and I go to the site
and don't see a binary package it will be a long while before I go back I
have other things to be doing.

I rather get the (source) release done, get my packages done (a good share
> of
> the above) and then get back to master...


I understand, just don't call it a "release". Branch it today and call it a
"call for packages" (don't use the word "out" or "release"), wait a few
days then binary release. You and I know what a source release is, users
don't care.  We really need some stats on our user base so we know what
platforms are our major target ones.

This raises the question how quickly are you expecting to have major
packages done?  If we source release tonight but don't have packages ready
by Monday, Tuesday, there is 4 days of people hitting our site with no way
to download the packages and this looks really bad.

Why not call for packages today, let people get sorted over the weekend,
update the site, release on Monday, Tuesday?

I know it sounds like a rant, because it kind of is, but I really enjoy
working on the project, the package is great, the people are great, but I
find this current release process stressful and I'm not one calling the
release.  Stressful because I know we have a lot of users who love our
stuff but can't get it when we say it's "out".

If you don't want to change it for this release, OK, but I think we need to
review it for the next release so everyone is on the same page.  There are
are other large projects we can steal the process from.

Hi,

Probably a low priority cosmetic thing, but I'm notice that when I select a label for a layer that previously didn't have a label, the cursor flashes red. 

I find this a bit disconcerting, as I read red as a warning colour - and I note red is being used that way in the expression builder. 

Does anyone else notice this?

Is it worth a ticket.

Hi Richard, Matthias, All

Yes, the crash problem is gone in master (nightly built) version. Thanks a
lot for the fix.  Tested it on Win 7 x64 and also Win XP x32.

Just for note, that issue is reported in v2.0.1 and v2.2 releases.

Will wait for the v2.4 release in July.

Hi Jorge Tornero, Bernhard, Matthias, Nyall, All

Thanks for taking up the scalebar issue.

I agree that in most cases, the scalebar is more of an academic /
customary. It hardly gives a "true" measurement.

Users generally use that as means of comparison and not to measure the
exact distance.

IMO, the scalebar makes sense when you have maps in large scales like 1:100
better. Otherwise, its just an estimation.

Hope QGIS can provide a solution.

Regards
Ted

You don't have to wait.
You can have it now if you want.

If you decided to give up your freedom for convenience, you can
wait for someone to also bring you a chair and a pillow.

Agreed about splitting the announcement, althought I'd also announce
source release on qgis-user. I don't think hiding existance of "sources"
brings any benefit in the users community.

I agree about wording being important.

Announcing source release should have a link to the source tarball.

Binary releases might even not need to be announced by the qgis team,
as serious package managers conveniently implement those announces with
user popups and the like...

There'll be a source package for download, so those that do not need
a binary package don't have to wait to use it. And those that do _build_
binary packages (for systems you may not even know exist) have a way
to download it and build their packages.

They _can_ get it, it may just be not yet wrapped the way which is
more comfortable for them. They only need to be informed about what's
available and what not.

It's like saying you can't say "apples are ripe!" because then people get
frustrated by not finding them on their supermarket shelf.

If you know what a source tarball is you are not a normal user.

 Saying "just announce the source and let someone else worry about binary"
is a disservice to our users.

99% of our users wouldn't even know how to even build QGIS, and why should
they, it's not their job.  It is ours, at least not for the major platforms.

It's like saying you can't say "apples are ripe!" because then people get

This is incorrect.  The "apples are ripe" is current master after freeze,
might be some bugs still but it's pretty good.  A better compare is saying
"Extra! We have apples ready to go,....*goes to shop*.tomorrow". We are the
shop.

Having dealt with people confused about the release my opinion is this is
bad publicity for the project. I'm not just making it up it's from
experience and having to deal with it.

For me, a summarize is: save two days of waiting (on a 4+ months 
schedule) so <1% users can compile while 99% get frustrated.

Why can't we state that release is when windows + mac + ubuntu are ready?

Many reported users get confused.
Last time, people were asking where to find the installer.

Isn't it sufficient proof this schema is not working well?

I suspect the actual fraction of users who compile is much much smaller

Probably the keypoint of this discussion are the different point of views
on what the dev community consider the final point of a development cycle.
Some consider it the source ball and the packaging a plus. Others include
the packages themselves (in their mindset).

I don't want to open a discussion on this but I think that a project like
QGIS, which is extending its user base, cannot consider that the majority
of its users even don't know how a software is made. And I don't blame
them, as I don't know the intricacies of the smartphone I'm writing on
right know.

If the problem is convincing people to donate to support the complete
lifecycle of the project well, this is a different point, but I don't think
we will get there hoping they understand what's under the job of releasing
a ready to go package...

"Ready to go" is when apples leave the tree.
That'd be a tag in contrast to a branch (like "master").

I went looking at the 2.2.0 announcement, it's here:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2014-February/031125.html

It clearly states that only the source code was made available, but I think
it was an error not to give a direct link to the source tarball.
Instead, the link generically points to the homepage of qgis.org, from which
it is even hard to find the source tarball. Is maybe that the reason why
people get frustrated.
I tried finding today (tarball for 2.2.0) and still don't see it:
http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html
The "sources" tab points to the main github page:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS
>From there you have to find your way into "releases":
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/releases
And you have to "guess" that "2.2.0" is called "final-2_2_0", which
has a description of "Version 2.2" (no patch-level) and no release notes.

After some more research, I tried following the "Older releases of QGIS"
link, from the "ALL RELEASES" tab in the download page, and finally found:
http://qgis.org/downloads/, from which a more serious-looking package
is found:

  http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2.2.0.tar.bz2

With it's signature:

  http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2.2.0.tar.bz2.md5

I think those two links should have been put into the announcement,
plus a link to the "release notes".

Those are the apples on the ground, ready to be picked up by
packagers that would wrap them in different boxes for different
markets.

Confusion is never good.
Myself I find qgis developers roles pretty confusing if they are expected
to both produce the good and also give it different "dresses" for users of
different markets. Where's the package for AmigaOS, btw ? Should we wait for
ie before shipping those apples ?

OK I have checked this quickly this morning on my machine at home as I am not around for the next week. Only difference at home is Windows 8. Updated both 32 bit (to 39eaff9) and 64 bit (to 2d1e983) OSGeo4W this morning.

I still do not get the option for SOSI files in 32 bit QGIS in the files of type drop down menu in the open file dialog window. The SOSI option is avaiable in 64 bit.

The 64 bit version still gives the invalid data source error after trying to open the SOSI file.

The SOSI file I have tested with is the naturvernomr?de dataset from Milj?direktoratet (I have downloaded only data for Rogaland fylke - data available from here http://karteksport.miljodirektoratet.no/#page=tab1). 

ogrinfo reports correctly on both 32 and 64 bit versions and ogr2ogr will convert sosi files to shapefiles in my test. 

Commands used were:

ogrinfo NATVERNOMR.SOS
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" output NATVERNOMR.SOS

Both sets of output shapefiles open fine in QGIS.

Regards,

James

Hi again,

Now I rebuilt the 32-bit package based on GDAL 1.11.0 which is the GDAL version QGIS is build against (the old package on OSGeo4W was built against GDAL 1.10) and tested in QGIS 2.3 (QGIS code revision  39eaff9).
The problem is now the same, James described for the 64bit version. However, ogrinfo gives no error messages and displays the content of the SOSI file and all layers just fine. So maybe it is not only a packaging issue?

James, what does your 64bit ogrinfo say when run with your SOSI file? And does ogr2ogr work for you in 64bit?

Cheers
Stefan

Hi all,

Just wondered if anything more has happened with this?

As it stands, I get an option for SOSI files in the file open dialog of 64 bit master, but not 32 bit. (SOSI is the data standard in Norway for those that don?t know).

In 64 bit, when I select a file for opening, it comes up with another dialog (similar to when you open up a gpx file) where you choose the geometry you want to load from the file. After I have selected what I want and push ok, I just get an error message saying that the data is not a valid data source.

This happens on both mine and a colleagues machine. Does this affect others too?

I have also installed the gdal-sosi package in osgeo4w. I am using Windows 7 64 Bit, osgeo4w for install. Current QGIS version is d4b07a.

If SOSI files do not open in QGIS, we should remove the option from the open file dialog window. Otherwise I think people here in Norway will have a bad experience with QGIS and SOSI.

Regards,

James Stott

That is because the gdal-sosi plugin in 32bit OSGeo4W was built against GDAL 1.10 (and not the 1.11 version QGIS 2.3 / 2.4 is (will be) using. I shall update the package based on GDAL 1.11 asap.

I can confirm the behavior you describe on Windows (both 32 and 64bit). Given that GDAL (using the gdal-sosi plugin from OSGeo4W) handles SOSI files without problems, the issue must be somewhere in the QGIS-GDAL interface. No idea what the reason might be...

Meanwhile I also tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (where I compiled GDAL 1.11 with SOSI support and then the latest QGIS master). On Ubuntu I can open SOSI files in QGIS without any problems... So this is a Windows specific issue, which makes me think that dropping the option to open SOSI from QGIS completely would be a bit too radical...

Hi Andreas

I am trying it on my computer, but without any results - I am unable
to get the crash.

So it does crash only with labeling turned on?

Can be the crashing project reduced to just one map layer and still crash?

My theory right now is that there will be some unhandled exceptions in
the rendering code which will trigger those QPixmap warnings when
QgsApplication::notify will try to show a QMessageBox in worker
thread.

Even it that is true, the question still is why those exceptions get raised...

Regards
Martin

So it Works for Mac and Linux users? Does this work with the installer download of QGIS for Windows? I havent actually tried that.

Is it possible to drop it for just Windows users? I just think we will end up with a lot of users (especially as Windows will possbily be the most used platform) who will get frustrated that they cant open these files despite it looking like they should be able to. Better to wait until 2.6 in my opinion.

This is a shame as we now have a nearly complete Norwegian translation in place for 2.4, so SOSI support and a translation are two very good arguements for adopting QGIS here.

I doubt it, since the installer is also built based on OSGeo4W, if I am not mistaken.

No idea. Any developer / packager who would be willing to help us tracing down the problem on Win? Since a fix would be the best solution...

Agree with this, and to Nathan's demands.

We should definitly get more information on our user base, gather statistics 
(anonymous, or through website stats), so that we can know what really matters 
to our users. We should not develop software for ourselves, but for people who 
really use it. And final polish is probably the most important part. Yes this 
includes taking care of the user, marketing, ergonomy, fine wording and many 
things developers do not want to do or are bad at doing.

Hi Martin,

It is quite hard to find out what is really causing the issue.

I had J?rgen visiting my machine with Teamviewer but he did not see
anything obvious. We had quite a few crashes but not a good idea what
may be causing it.

The interesting thing is that it only happened with certain data
formats. The crashes appeared with Postgis datasource and SpatiaLite
datasource, but not with ESRI shapefiles.

The crashes do not appear always. Maybe 1 out of 3 or 4. They appear
more often after a fresh start of QGIS.

I am afraid I cannot produce an easy to reproduce test-case.

Andreas

I don't like this potential crash when remove a layer used on the composer.

We also experience this kind of situation on qgis 2.0.
In qgis 2.2 I lost of sight the question because our users knowing the
problem paid attention to avoid to remove a layer.
:)

Now I like to try to replicate this problem.

Just some information to understand your infrastructure:
your crash happened  using always the qgis64 from osgeo4w-64 or also
sometime with osgeo4w-32 ?
You use qgis 2.2 stable or dev ?


Thx,

A.

Thanks for the support.

I'll announce that the feature freeze is lifted from master as soon as the
release is done - start with packaging and announce the release when my
packages are ready (Debian, Ubuntu, ubuntugis, OSGeo4W, standalone; maybe later
today).

I trust that the other packagers are already prepared to start packaging after
the release, know now, monitor github anyway or do their packages after they
see the release announcement.

But I won't avoid the term "release" on any commits ;)

I understand - I didn't mean to prepare a project that would always
replicate the problem. My idea was that if you could try to continue
simplifying the project to get at least more hints what functionality
must be used in order to still see the crashes (on your computer) - so
we could at least rule out some options that may be causing it.

Hi,

I will continue to try to simplify the project.

@Andrea: this is a different issue. My crash happens directly after
project load. Not when removing a layer.

Hi,

Happy to report that the source generates/compiles using CMake 3.0.0, at
least on my Mac with OS X 10.9.3 and latest build tools. I did receive some
policy warnings. Looks like most are related to CMake editing I have done
and another Mac related. Will look into it after release.

Hi,

Hmm. I had no issues opening that file up on Mac [0]. The only other thing
I can think of is to ensure the GDAL_DRIVER_PATH is set in the environment,
so the plugins can be found at run-time by QGIS/GDAL. I don't think that
should be an issue for an OSGeo4W install, though. To be sure, you can try
setting it in Options -> System -> Environment and see if that helps.

If the plugin wasn't found by GDAL, then the file filter for SOSI would not
show up in QGIS's file browse dialog's combobox for opening a vector layer.
If you choose *.* (all files) and try to load a .sos file, then it will
throw the invalid source error in the message bar, because GDAL never
loaded the plugin.

Sorry, won't have time to test on any other platforms for a couple of days.

Hi people,

the new version was just branched off, the new tar ball[1] was made and
packaging can begin and the feature freeze on master is now over.

The new version will be announced once packages for some platforms are
available.

Hi Larry,

Thanks for your efforts. I understand that you are especially busy right now?

I checked GDAL_DRIVER_PATH  and it was - just as you suspected for OSGeo4W ? set properly to ?C:\OSGeo4W\bin\gdalplugins?.
Just like in James case, SOSI is listed in the combo-box in QGIS and I get the dialog for selecting among the three layers in the file. When I try to load one of them I get the ?Invalid data source? error message.

GDAL in the same OSGeo4W installation reads and converts the SOSI file without any issues. However, I noticed that GDAL was also less picky with the versions. While the SOSI plugin compiled against GDAL 1.10 does not show up in QGIS 2.3 (build against GDAL 1.11), GDAL 1.11 itself has no problems with that plugin either.

Maybe some subtle differences in compiler settings between J?rgens build of GDAL and my build of the SOSI-plugin may cause the problems here? I assume you use same compiler for GDAL and QGIS on Mac (like I do on Ubuntu)?
When I built the SOSI plugin I tried to follow packaging instructions closely. I used MS Visual Studio Express 2010 (compiler toolset v100) for the 32bit build (SDK 7.1 for the 64bit build), set MSVC_VER=1600 in GDALs nmake.opt, added SOSI support and kept default settings in the other cases.

Cheers
Stefan

If SOSI is available in the Raster file open dialog, it is because gdal has
support for SOSI. If a particular SOSI file cannot be opened, then it is a
GDAL bug, not a QGIS one, and should be reported in the GDAL bugtracker.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Working with the new Legend
Message-ID: <CALPrXdoez2S3UzT7o0S=nXijLmRnpyK4zZe8PKLMNvmNpEAhgA@mail.gmail.com>

Having read the thread about the new legend merge, I'm wondering if there
is a summary on how to work with it via Python.

I have a plugin that is broken as it relied on being able to move layers up
and down in the legend by grabbing a reference to the QTreeWiget (now gone)
and working with the Qt methods available to it.

I need to:

* insert a layer at a give location
* move a layer to a new position
* remove a layer

It seems we could provide a higher level interface for moving layers
around. The method of adding an existing layer to the legend in a new
position then deleting its twin didn't work for me.

Or perhaps I'm missing something?

Hi Etienne,

Thanks for having a look at this issue too.

The thing is that GDAL (or more precise OGR) opens SOSI files properly but QGIS from OSGeo4W does not (this issue does not occur on Mac and Linux).
In QGIS the contained layers (points, lines, polygons) can be identified (we get the dialog to choose a layer), so also QGIS can access the SOSI file in principle. But these layers themselves are rejected as ?Invalid data source? (tested with different SOSI files). OGR converts all layers from the file QGIS rejects e.g. to SQLite correctly.

Cheers
Stefan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 2.4 'Chugiak'
Message-ID: <20140628005654.GA29567@norbit.de>

QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System
that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.

We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 2.4 'Chugiak'.

The new release contains a lot of new features, tweaks and enhancements.  The
most noticible improvement is probably the long awaited multithreaded
rendering, that lets QGIS leave a much more responsive impression.

This is second release following our new four month release schedule that is
meant to make new features and bugfixes available quicker and the development
and new releases more predictable.   This time the testing phase was especially
fruitful and was therefore extended by a week. Thanks to all the tester for
their time and good reports.

The source code and binaries for Windows, Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu are already
available via the large download link on our home page: http://qgis.org.  More
packages will follow as soon as the package maintainers finish their work.
Please revisit the page if your platform is not available yet.


A word of thanks to our contributors, donors and sponsors

fund development of new features when they use it as their platform, and we are

Congratulations to all involved, once again QGIS has leaped forward with a
bunch of new features.

That said, the "test the release candidate" on qgis.org should be replaced
by "enjoy the new version" :)

There is no Python-specific summary, but the doxygen documentation of
the new QgsLayerTree* classes should give you a good idea where to
start. I plan to add some notes to the PyQGIS cookbook later.

Let me paste some example code. Let's prepare few things to begin with:

How do you mean it with a higher level interface - moving layers
around requires just two lines of code...

Agreed. After seeing your examples, it looks fine.

Great ! 
thanks all!

I didn't find a link to the visual changelog on qgis.org. Could we add a
direct link from homepage. BTW, there is a "what's new" banner, but it is
redirecting to 2.0 doc..

Richard meanwhile updated the image.   The the link to the visual changelog on
the "for users" page[1] point to the 2.4 visual changelog now and the link to
the tarball[2][3] was also fixed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] MetaSearch dependencies
Message-ID: <53AED6C0.805@gmx.ch>

Hi,

When starting my freshly packaged QGIS 2.6 builds on Fedora I get
warnings about missing packages:

mpl_toolkits
zope

As MetaSearch is now installed as core plugin and therefore by the
systems package management system it should take care of these
dependencies. However, I am not sure, which packages exactly are
required. I have python-matplotlib installed, so that cannot be the
missing part. For zope there are a lot of different options available.

I have pasted the search results here: http://pastebin.com/AmW2BTBe

What could it be? And are there any other dependencies I might need to
satisfy for a properly working MetaSearch plugin.

Regards,
Matthias

2.6?  That's a bit early. ;)

matplotlib is a dependency of processing now.  Maybe mpl_toolkits is an
dependency of that?  No idea about zope.

The dependencies MetaSearch needs are in python/ext-libs.  No matplotlib or
zope there.  So I doubt that was introduced by MetaSearch.

Confirm. Those libs are outside of / not required by MetaSearch.

matplotlib is a dependency of a few algorithms in Processing, but it was
giving a lot of problems, so those algorithms are disabled since some time
ago. If matplotlib is not used by anything else, I guess it can be removed
if needed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Processing graphical modeler
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7wwG6U1POAcqqaxDZTW6Sd5_QO9+9PGLttAhPQUBAAp-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have been working on a new graphical modeler and Alex Bruy merged it
today into master (thanks Alex!)

It has some interesting new functionality (it allows to zoom in/out in the
modeler canvas, algorithms can be named, models can be nested without
limit, help strings are included int the model file...), but most of all is
a change that affects the modeler internally. The internal architecture has
been completely redesigned, and now it should be easier to extend it,
cleaner and easier to understand.

This has some drawbacks, however. There is no backwards compatibility, so
old models cannot be reused, and there might be some new bugs and issues. I
encourage everyone to test it and give feedback. I believe this is a very
important improvement, but it is a big one, and hopefully there will not be
too many issues with it.

Thanks in advance for your support.

Victor

Subject: [Qgis-developer] loading relative paths with python
Message-ID: <53B0750F.7080903@uni-weimar.de>

Hello everybody,
I try to load Natural Earth Data from a relative path inside my Plugin, 
but failed.
Pictures are no Problem with an resource-file, but shp-files which need 
also other files from the same directory don't
load with the same way:

self.admin0_layer = 
QgsVectorLayer(":ned/ne_10m_admin_0_boundary_lines_land.shp", "admin0", 
"ogr")

It works for absolute paths, but not for this with a ressource file.

I also try to load a sqlite-db from natural earth data and load this 
one, but when I include it in the resource file, the file grows up to 
1,7GB, and this is to big for a plugin.

What is the best way, to provide the vectordata with the plugin and load 
it in any OSs with relative path?

Hi Vincent,
this is a long standing issue (we have been discussing this extensively
since Zuerich HF). I agree that knowing our user base is quite important
for the future of the project.
Of course we should not be obtrusive, and fully respect the privacy of
users, but I think something can be done on this, maybe along the lines
of Debian's popularity contest http://popcon.debian.org/
All the best.

We have (work in progress):
http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog24.html
where the links points to:
http://changelog.linfiniti.com/qgis/version/2.4.0/

as it is work in progress, we have not brought it upfront...

Tim asked people to write 'items' for the changelog. As that is what it
is: a little application in which people can write an 'item' and add
some screendumps.

The QGIS website get's the feed from that changelog website and
incorporates it in the main website.

To all people wanting to have better "what's new in this version" I
would say: please invest some time in getting to know the way stuff
works and help make it better. We still do not have a marketing
department with people doing that for us :-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] "No symbol" renderer... thoughts?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsizHKJbMhev8_mHJencBUUhYTf=+=N9Ry-jZimJ34SutA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I find I'm often adding layers to a map solely for labelling, and
having to set the symbology for these layers to a 100% transparent
symbol so that the features themselves aren't shown.

This seems rather hacky and inefficient, since QGIS is still rendering
these feature, they just aren't being shown. Consequently, I'd like to
add a better method for having layers with no visible features.

As far as I can see, there's three possible options for this:
- Add a "no symbols" renderer.
- Allow the first symbol layer to be removed, so that a symbol can
have no layers
- Add "no fill"/"no line"/"no marker" symbol layers

What would be the preferred solution, from a design and UX view? I'm
leaning toward the "no symbols" renderer option myself, but thought
I'd seek feedback before digging into this.

Nyall

On that note, Tim can you please add a 2.6 version to the changelog?
It will be much easier to keep this complete if we fill it out
immediately as features are added.

Hi,

I like the idea of the "no symbols" renderer. Probably the easiest of
the proposed solutions for the user.

+1 for a "no symbol" renderer. I also had a use case when styling OSM data.
I guess it should be either the first or the last option on the
renderer list. Probably the last.

Best wishes,
Anita

I'd vote for the last option as it'd be compatible with rule based
symbology, which could be useful when coupled with the [x] show layer count
(simple eg creating a ELSE rule with a no-symbol layer to keep track of nb
of features not rendered.).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CMake error from QGIS 2.4.0 in Windows 7
Message-ID: <1404139565215-5148825.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, I am trying to compile qgis 2.4.0 in Windows 7 for Visual Studio 10.

I have been trying to set up all the required dependencies with CMake 3.0.
And I have been able to link all the dependencies by using OSGeo4W, even
though there are lots of missing instructions on qgis website for Windows
installation.

But, now I am getting error saying below:

   CMake Error at cmake/FindSIP.cmake:54 (MESSAGE):
     Could not find SIP
   Call Stack (most recent call first):
     CMakeLists.txt:569 (FIND_PACKAGE)

I installed SIP from OSGeo4W, but it seems like cmake cannot find the link.
I looked at some archives, some previous posts were saying, in general this
error is coming from when we are missing "python-sip-dev". But, OSGeo4W only
provides "sip" which might mean that "sip" should work. I think the current
sip from OSGeo4W includes python-sip-dev too.

If this is the case, how can I resolve this error issue?

Thanks in advance.

I am not sure exactly if it's really a dependency problem. I pasted the
warnings here, it mentions MetaSearch, that's why I thought it is
related. But as it is complaining about a missing __init__.py in a
python site-packages directory it might as well be a distribution or
local configuration issue. Maybe somebody with more python experience
can shed some light on this.

Hey everyone,



*Weekly Report 6*

*What was done this week?*

   - Worked on ways to implement the direction/angular constraint. Have to
   try more than one approach to see which one is working best for the project.


*What is the plan for next week?*

   - Will continue to try different approaches and test the data on them.
   Implementation of this constraint is time consuming. Mainly because of the
   need to figure out which approach works best for our specific requirements.

   - Will also review the timeline for the project as there might be need
   to make some changes.


*Wiki page : *http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/nishithm

Hi, 
excellent idea if we get speed improvement !
I don't have QGIS running here right now, but I remember having seen a "no
symbol" checkbox in rule based renderer. If we look for consistant UI, we
should have the same checkbox for classical renderers on symbol level. I
remember being puzzled when I discovered that and didn't find it in
classical symbology. 
I my experience, users didn't discover displacement point renderer by
themselves, because it's the lowest entry in the listbox. I suspect we can
expect low usage of no symbol renderer if we put it there. 
Cheers
R?gis

You can already have no symbol for a rule.  Just untick the Symbol checkbox
in the rule properties.
