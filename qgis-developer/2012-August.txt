Hi all,

I'm the maintainer of cpt-city, mentioned above.  Perhaps of interest is the
"API" for the full package of gradients.  I quote "API" because it is really
just an XML file which lists the current version and names of the package
files -- the idea being that software which want to keep an up-to-date copy
of the archive can check this file and download the latest version if it is
newer than the version it has already.  Info at the bottom of the page 
http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/pkg/ here .

Hi.
Thanks for stepping in. This seems the way to go. As for the licences,
are we OK including all your sources in QGIS?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

> Thanks for stepping in. This seems the way to go. As for 
> the licences,  are we OK including all your sources in QGIS? 

Any of *my* sources, yes (GPL or public domain), but the gradients 
on cpt-city are under various licences (as listed in the files
COPYING.xml). Many of these licences do not permit 3rd party
redistribution or contain conditions which would be incompatible 
with GPL etc.  One could select a "GPL compatible subset", but it
would miss some of the best ones and take quite a bit of work
(volunteers invited!)

This is why I have implemented the "user download"-friendly
API, so that users can avoid the hassle of downloading and
installing the gradients if they have a bit of software 
support, without software developers redistributing the
gradients themselves (something similar was done with 
the MS Core Fonts)

Incidentally, if you were thinking of adding support for 
reading SVG gradients, then I have some C code which will
do that 

  http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/jjg/en/code/cptutils.html

(see src/common/svg*) all GPLv2, or you can have a copy under
any reasonable free licence if you prefer

Cheers

Jim

I'm afraid I couldn't commit to that at the moment as I have so much else to
do, but here is an outline: Assume that $user is a user's local data
repostory
(~/.qgis on unix or whatever)

- have a file $user/cpt-city.urls containing a list of location of the
cpt-city pkg/ directory
- have a file $user/cpt-city.version containing the installed $version1
- periodically (in the background on program startup, or via user cronjob)
  - read the first url, $url1, from the urls file 
  - try to fetch $url1/package.xml
  - if sucessful 
       extract the $url2 from package.xml, if it is different to $url1, push
it into  $user/cpt-city.urls
       extract the $version2 from package.xml
       if $version2 > $version1
          download and install $url2/cpt-city-svg-$version2.zip
          update $user/cpt-city.version with $version2
    else try with the next url from the urls file, ...

Here the idea is that if/when the site moves, I can inform users via the
package.xml
file without intervention.

The package is updated irregularly (when contributions arrive), but
typically once
a month.

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zsvzwQ9kj5G6VrjsnQaTE6Sd_fdZg3VfcgQ8W2vRUuHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We have finally decided to move the SEXTANTE repo (the QGIS part of
it) to the QGIS repository. The Java part will stay in the googlecode
SVN as it is right now.

The repo will be frozen Aug20th, so please commit your changes before
that date. Once the code is migrated, we will update links in the
SEXTANTE website and the site at hub.qgis, so you know how to update
your copies

Thanks for your understanding, and we all hope this will boost the
development of SEXTANTE and make it easier for both QGIS users and
developers to work with SEXTANTE.

Regards

ok, thanks. Maybe this can be done while rearranging the color ramps
(Etienne, you there?) or more generally the symbology (arun, interested?).
anyway, a good solution to a long standing QGIS limitation is within
sight now, great.
All the best.

Hi!

Thanks for offering your advice, and also for your wonderful collection!

Nice that you mention this - because I have a functioning interface to
cpt-city in QGis!  The code I have parses the svg files using QT's xml
routines.

Although I did not parse the "master" xml file you mention, but the
directory structure of the archive (after unzipping the zip file with
svg gradients).
I will look into that xml file (it isn't so obvious that there is such
a file on your site), as well as your suggestions for downloading
current package.

I have a doubt regarding licences though - it would not be ok for use
to supply the files, but it would be OK to write software to fetch the
data automatically?

Also, I was wondering if you would mind that the use of this automatic
downloading in QGis could impose a burden on your site... could we
host a mirror copy on qgis.org, or would that infringe on the
licences?

Attached is a screenshot of the interface I made to cpt-city
gradients. There are some things to improve, but it's functional.

My github repository has the code:
https://github.com/etiennesky/Quantum-GIS/tree/coloramp

It should be: this has been for years the solution adopted by Debian,
for MS fonts, flash plugin, etc.
Of course this depends on the licence of data, so an advice from a
lawyer (FSF?) would be preferable.
All the best, and thanks.

Like I said in my other email - this is a pretty close reality.
Should I merge my branch to master now, or let some interested parties
check it out from my branch?

https://github.com/etiennesky/Quantum-GIS/tree/coloramp

There are some kinks to work out - but mostly needs feedback from others.

Main points to improve

1) downloading of cpt-city archive, ideally automatically uwing
cpt-city's maintainer's suggestion (what's your name BTW?)
2) better organisation of the ColorRamp classes
3) perhaps a selection of palettes for QGis
4) organisation of gradients - this needs the work of Arun

+1 for merging - too lazy now to compile a different branch ;)
we are amidst great transitions, so you should not be too worried of
breaking something, IMHO.
All the best.

I believe this is correct.  I accept contribution to the site on the
explicit
condition that they be "free to use", i.e., that anyone can download and
use them in their own work, possibly with attribution etc.

I try my hardest to get people to specify a licence, but sometimes they
are impossible to contact, and sometimes they just have a text like this:

  http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/es/copying.html

(this particularly true on deviantArt) Rather than exclude the gradients I 
just post the licence that they have specified.

If a "fetch when updated" script as posted earlier is used, then there
will not be a problem -- the package.xml file is very small (for the 
checks) and the zipfiles are a couple of MB, I can handle a few hundred
downloads before I reach bandwidth limits.

Formally, I think that mirroring these files would be 3rd party 
redistribution, so would be suspect.

That's very nice.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to the
packages that would make this easier (eg, metadata in directories
etc) and I will see what I can do

OK will merge, unless someone dissagrees today.

For the meantime, integration of this work with Arun's will be
identical to other color ramps. It is based on the ColorBrewer ramps -
the cpt-city color ramp dialog creates a new color ramp, after which
it is available in the Style Manager.

It could be better integrated with Arun's work by managing the
available color ramps, instead of the saved color ramps.

Yes your .xml file is indeed small, so having the app querying once a
week for updates would not be a burden.

However, you might find more than a hundred downloads of the zip file,
when the next main stable QGis version (2.0) is released, with this
feature.

I guess the .deb packages are only available from your site?

In fact - I found that things that were missing:
1) a list of gradients and their variants (e.g. ColorBrewer)
2) names associated to the various directories/authors
3) metadata of your "Selections".

 I have taken care of those points already: I read the folders and
search for files with similar endings to detect variants of the same
gradient. For the authors and selections I copied the information from
your main page and the collections pages.

But in the future it would be useful to others to have this
information in xml files. If you like I could send you the code, and
you could integrate it into your work - although it's c++ with QT. Or
I could generate an xml file and send it to you.

Thanks for the responses.

I will concentrate on telling the users they need it for now and let
them decide how best to manage that.

I am having problems with suds though. 

I point it to the wsdl and all I get back is an error as below:

RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while pickling an object

May try one of the other libraries that are out there.

James,

I'm using suds in my plugin on windows 7 64bits.

The problem as you mention it, is how to include it in your plugin.
For my self I didn't bother because I made a setup.exe that install suds
and the plugin where they need to be.

I suppose you can copy it in your plugin dir and do something like:
from my_plugin import suds
suds.blabla

It should work.

Message-ID: <CAK4yQTm9ZxSYkA8Mveh+khHNFrs0zrCOsc9ozSZbPHYyQsgX-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

It seemed a little bit odd to me that QGIS is able to open many file types
but you can only edit a couple of them. Being new to the world of GIS and
therefore not understanding any of its history, this seemed as odd as
photoshop being able to open but not edit jpeg files!

In part of my work looking at adapting fTools / SEXTANTE to write to memory
layer / any ogr format, I have created a standalone plugin that converts
any vector layer to a memory layer (and therefore allows you to edit the
layer). This plugin is hosted at [1], if you like I will move it to a more
permanent location.

Notes:

* Filters for just vector layers (but could be further filtered to vector
layers that cannot be edited in their current format).
* No progress bar at the moment (at 1000's of features the plugin can take
a little while so will add a progress bar at a later date).

[1] http://ubuntuone.com/3Zl1ojo3ZMUJxMqj2kcZaX

Regards,
Rob

thanks for this. of course the right place for it is
http://plugins.qgis.org/
from there, everybody can install and check it.
looking forward to see it there.
all the best.

Hi Marco,

You're right, this patch does not work. I don't really know it passed
the tests I did here. My environment was pretty messy.

I had a look at it again today and tracked down the warning that
appeared before the crashes (QWidget::repaint: Recursive repaint
detected).
This led me to the code in qgsvectorlayer I changed in the attached
patch. It looks to me as if this patch really fixes the problem. Still,
I'd be happy if you could review the patch, because I don't know, what
side-effects it could cause. I think you know what the code I removed
did (The initials MH probably say that you already disabled this for
Mac)

Regards,
Matthias

1) the list of gradients is just the list of their file names, so no
    problem there. "Variants" is problematic, since who is to say
    what is a variant of what?  This is very subjective (and what
    actually is the point of it?)

2) The author of each gradient can be found from COPYING.xml.
    If you start from a path like a/b/c/d.svg then there will be 
    one COPYING.xml file corresponding to it, and it is in one of

    a/b/c/COPYING.xml
    a/b/COPYING.xml
    a/COPYING.xml

    i.e, a COPYING.xml applies to that directory and all subdirectories.

    I can see it might be useful to have a description for each 
    subdirectory.  Say
    - short name (same as directory name)
    - long name (essentialy the text in the directory link on parent
directory)
    - description (essentially the first sentence of the page text)
    so 
    "seq"
    "sequential"
    "Sequential colour schemes designed by Cynthia Brewer"
    This info in a file called DESC.xml in the directory cpt-city/cb/seq/

    I'm open to suggestions on this.

3) is a different matter altogether, some of these selections are updated 
    every day (most popular downloads etc), so I suggest we do the above
    first an learn the lesson before trying this ...

Do you think you can host in through the qgis plugins repo referenced by Paolo?

Hi,

Well, after lots more testing and head-scratching, I came to realize
the QSvgIconEngine plugin was not being bundled with the Mac builds.
This was why SVG icons were being rendered but scaled like rasters.
This skewed my previous SVG icon Qt scaling test. Sorry for that. I've
included the plugin for Mac bundling [0].

This changes my previous results in two ways:

- I no longer see any issues with down- or up-scaling with any of the
test SVG icons on Mac.
- Robert's 24x24 SVG icons scale OK to 32x32. I have not tested the
scaling up to 48x48. Since it is a straight 200% I expect it will
render even better.

To test up-scaling, I have reverted mActionPanToSelected.svg back to
Robert's original 24x24 design [1]. Set the icon preference to 32x32
to test.

Since my testing on Mac was not up-scaling SVG icons before I did not
notice the issue with the Default theme's switched-out SVGs with
embedded rasters. They are now up-scaling very poorly to 32x32, where
such embedded rasters were originally PNGs at 24x24
(mActionPanToSelected and mActionRotateLabel).

Second Test Conclusions

- 48x48 base icon size would probably still be ideal as a single icon
set base size, since it could be rasterized at that size (or lower) if
PNGs are required for something. However, 24x24 base size may work
well when scaled and rasterized (further tests needed here).

- Embedding rasters in SVGs (for having Default theme available while
moving to an SVG-only theme) is not a good idea. The rasters up-scale
poorly. I suggest a clean move to a SVG-only set, if QSvgIconEngine is
to be leveraged to solve scaling problems for core icons. PNGs could
still be supported once the getThemeIcon() method is removed, since it
currently chooses the icon based upon file name and extension.

Yeah, happy to add it to the repo. I posted it here first to see if anyone  
had initial feedback. Will upload it in the next few days.

Iif you use a browser interface (like I implemented) it can get very crowded.

For example, the Color Brewer gradients have 7 variants each - no
sense in having 7 entries for the same palette.
I *think* I resolved most variants, they have a same prefix and
usually end with incremental numbers.

When you present the palettes in a big page (like on your website),
it's ok to show them all, but in an application I find it's easier to
group them.

Yes that would be great, especially the description and long name. You
might put all information (description and copyright) in one file
though.

ok.  It would be cool to have xml files for those eventually, or a way
to parse the web pages that contain the lists.

Also - Tim also wrote to me that it would be interesting to distribute
within QGis a selection of gradients that allow distribution. Do you
know how I could search the archive for such gradients - except for
the obvious grep?

On your site you write "those under GPL, Apache-like, Creative commons
or MIT licences allow distribution (under some conditions)" - which
restrictions are those, are they specified per-licence or per-author ?

Thanks

Agreed, at least a set of important ramps should be included in the
standard distro, for people without internet connection.
All the best, and many thanks.

No, there are 12 gradients with 3 segments, 12 gradients with 4,
... No actually there are 38 containing green and 72 not containing 
green... No actually there are ...

Get my point? There are dozens of ways to categorize a set of gradients,
and there is no obvious way to say which is better. How would you categorise
the ds9 collection?

I see this as a problem which needs a creative GUI solution rather
than an artificial and labour intensive categorisation.  How does
PhotoShop solve this problem?  (I'm asking genuinely, I've never
used PS).

That would not be possible since there must be one DESC for each
directory, but one might not have a COPYING in each directory.

Probably be easiest to have a fixed format XML file rather than trying
to parse the HTML (which may well change)

Either you can browse the website and look at the copying links at
the bottom of the page, or look at the COPYING.xml in the package
(the latter generates the former).  That file applies to that directory
and all of its subdirectories.

You will need to judge for yourself whether the licence text allows
redistribution,  for GPL, Apache, public domain this is clearly yes; 
for "no distribution allowed" this is clearly no, but there are some in
the middle.  The distributor take the legal risks and so it is only right
that the distributor makes this judgement.

Hi Larry,

I took a look yesterday and was confused to find my interpretation of the scaling quality to be a little different than what you reported on OSX. With your update today, the pan select icon looks very good at various scales. I'm glad to see that the svg scaling is working good within qt and on OSX now.

Cheers,
John

I would not categorize the ds9 collection - the palettes are all different.

The Color Brewer case is quite simple in my (perhaps
graphically-challenged) mind - group all the Blues_xx together, the
BuPu_xx together.

I am simply talking about "variants" of the same palette (with varying
number of colors) rather than classification, which can be arbitrary
as you point out.

GnBu_03, GnBu_04, ... , GnBu_09 => GnBu{_03,_04,...,_09}

Again, I am talking about groupping together palettes based on similar
names, it's not really labor intensive but can lead to some cases of
grouping error.

I don't know what sort of data you want to post and get in web server.

SOAP is a bit old. REST API is the way to go now.

Please don't restrict it like that.  It is useful to be able to make a memory layer copy of even a layer that is writeable.  You might even consider renaming it to reflect that - "Copy as memory layer" perhaps?

What would be useful is an option to only copy the selected features.  And it should work even with no selected features - this would provide a quick way to create an empty memory layer with the same attribute columns.

Message-ID: <CADs9uc_hNURN=SGPwA07Bw2FcSDwe1Nu80N094_p4MGY_2uSGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Has anybody managed to build / compile QGIS in Mac OS X (Mountain Lion
i.e. 10.8)?

Any tips on this?

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/INSTALL

What are the changes in this instruction?

I want also to include QtSQL support so MSSQL can work as well for Mac OS X.

How do you include QtSQL support (ie. qsql_odbc.h support for MSSQL)
for Mac OS X build?

How do this QtSQL support in Linux?


(I got a decent macbookpro (base) retina 2.3Gh now. I have not build
any QGIS in my slow laptop before).

Thanks.

Unless you're feeling really adventurous and want use a different
route, you'll want to first test whether the Qt and kyngchaos.com
frameworks for 10.6/10.7 install and work as is. Not sure how much
testing William has done with the new Mac OS. I'll probably be trying
to compile QGIS on 10.8 next week.

After those are correctly installed an validated, there are a couple
of optional items you can skip on your first compiling to save
yourself some time:

5.4.10. Optional Dependencies: libfcgi
5.4.11. Optional Dependencies: OSG & osgEarth

You may have compile errors regarding libspatialindex, see this
discussion for additional info:

The Mac QGIS.app includes bundled Qt frameworks (though not their
header files), so Qt ODBC support should be functional if the
libqsqlodbc.dylib plugin is included. I saw the discussion you brought
up about it previously [1], but it is not currently being bundled.
Here is a temporary git patch file you can apply that adds the
bundling [2]. The method I used has redundant code in it, which can be
fixed up once you report back that it actually works (I don't have
access to a MSSQL server to test).

I'll let one of the Linux gurus answer that one. :^)

Lets just err on the side of caution and take the 'clearly yes' ones.

Hi All,

Thanks to those of you who pitched in your two cents for the 2012
survey of geospatial platform use. Results are in and parsed, so take
a look and let the rest of the community know if anything strikes you
as particularly interesting:

Hi Larry,

I already installed William frameworks before I update to ML (10.8). I
think the frameworks survive after the ML install (update). Only
python site packages did not survived after the update to ML (10.8).

We need to add 10.8 in Qt global (i.e. qglobal.h), as you can see it
here (below):

Placing the libqsqlodbc.dylib in the /plugins/sqldrivers/ in QGIS.app
probably will work.

I don't have MSSQL to test as well. However, I can probably visit some
people around here in Melbourne who are using QGIS for Mac OS X who
have MSSQL servers.

William's QGIS for Mac OS X works fine in Mountaion Lion (ML) 10.8.

ML 10.8 is better (stable) than Lion (10.7.4).

Thanks.

It might be a while before I get to Mountain Lion, for various reasons.

For running existing software on Mtn, I expect few problems.  Apple usually does a good job of forward compatibility if the software was built for the previous version or 2.  Also, this time there shouldn't be a Python change - there is no Python 2.8, and 3.x is a big jump (not just for Apple).  Can you verify the default Python version is still 2.7? (it will still be there anyways)  In any case my Python installers should be able to reinstall Python modules removed by the upgrade.

Qt software should run, but there may be small glitches.

Compiling on Mtn for Qt may have problems.  The fix in that link may not be absolutely necessary.  As I remember, Qt just spews out warnings on new OSX versions, the fix just removes those.  Also, you can use an SDK to compile for Lion and you shouldn't get those warnings.

Hi Matthias

Disabling that piece of code means there is no possibility to interrupt 
long rendering with the 'esc' key. Also the possibility to have an 
incremental screen update will be gone (e.g. every 10000 features).

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Testing friday
Message-ID: <CALCNqkab0+a2cYf2abE6xGT0v+kJzUqx8RdaMKKBQBwNb3GKLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I thought it might be fun to add a few tests to QGIS every friday as a
new tradition. So tomorrow I will start  :-)

I would like to invite, encourage, beg and bribe others out there to
write tests too! You don't have to be a code guru - if you can write a
python plugin you are already more than qualified!

Here are the 4 simple steps to writing a new python test:

1) ------------------------------------ Write test code

I put mine into tests/src/python/test_qgsgeometry.py as I wanted to
start a new test case - but you could just as easily extend an
existing one. Lets look at the source:

  1 import unittest
  2
  3 from qgis.core import (QgsGeometry, QGis)
  4
  5 # Convenience instances in case you may need them but
  6 # not used in this test
  7 #from utilities import getQgisTestApp
  8 #QGISAPP, CANVAS, IFACE, PARENT = getQgisTestApp()
  9
 10 class TestQgsGeometry(unittest.TestCase):
 11
 12     def testWktPointLoading(self):
 13         myWKT='POINT(10 10)'
 14         myGeometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt(myWKT)
 15         myMessage = ('Expected:\n%s\nGot:\n%s\n' %
 16                       (QGis.Point, myGeometry.type()))
 17         assert myGeometry.type() == QGis.Point, myMessage
 18
 19
 20 if __name__ == '__main__':
 21     unittest.main()

Here is a walkthrough:

So on line 1 we are importing unittest since we are using the python
unittest framework.
On line 3 I import the two QGIS classes I need for my test.
Lines 5-8 are there for info only - they provide a mechanism to test
application and plugin space code too, and also to create a map
canvase instance if you want to test rendering things. These lines are
disabled for the test.

Line ten declares my test class which inherits from unittest.TestCase

Each test unit you want to implement gets written in its own method.
In this case we are going to see if we can create a point from a wkt
and then test that the geometry type is correct after loading it.

Lines 13-14 create the point geometry from a WKT string

Lines 15-16 compose an error message with some diagnostic info for if
the test fails.

Line 17 asserts that the loaded geometry is indeed a point.

Lines 20-21  are just plumbing so that you can run the test standalone
if you want to

2) ------------------------------------------ Register your test

To register your test, you simply add a new entry to
tests/src/python/CMakeLists.txt Like this:

ADD_PYTHON_TEST(PyQgsGeometry test_qgsgeometry.py)

3) ------------------------------------------ Running your test individually

Now you can run it simply by doing this (I am using a regex match on
the test name):

ctest -R PyQgsGeom -V

Make sure you are in your build dir when you run it. You should get an
output like this:

test 23
    Start 23: PyQgsGeometry

23: Test command: /usr/bin/cmake "-P"
"/home/timlinux/dev/cpp/Quantum-GIS/build-master-qtcreator/tests/src/python/PyQgsGeometry.cmake"
23: Test timeout computed to be: 1500
23: LD_LIBRARY_PATH:NOTFOUND:/home/timlinux/dev/cpp/Quantum-GIS/build-master-qtcreator/output/lib:
23: PYTHONPATH:/home/timlinux/dev/cpp/Quantum-GIS/build-master-qtcreator/output/python/:
23: -- Running /usr/bin/python
/home/timlinux/dev/cpp/Quantum-GIS/tests/src/python/test_qgsgeometry.py
23: .
23: ----------------------------------------------------------------------
23: Ran 1 test in 0.000s
23:
23: OK
23:
1/1 Test #23: PyQgsGeometry ....................   Passed    0.10 sec

The following tests passed:
	PyQgsGeometry

4) --------------------------------------- There is no step 4

There is nothing more to it. Your test should run automatically when
you run make check, make test or make Experimental. If you run make
Experimental, your test will appear on the test dashboard here:

http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS

The test will also be built automatically whenever a commit takes
place by our Jenkins robot.

If you contribute a test you provide a verifyable indicator that that
specific functionality is working with each commit. When we have 1000
tests it will be very difficult for people to break stuff in the code
base without us realising it.

Anyway I will hang around on IRC #qgis tomorrow (GMT+2) to lend a hand
to anyone else who might like to start adding tests. It will probably
only take 5-10 mins for most tests you can contrive (unless you need
to test something more complex) and it really doesn't require any deep
technical skills - cut and paste from the QGIS Python cookbook will
probably take you far! I look forward to many pull requests containing
new tests!

Thanks again to Jurgen for resolving the cmake issues so that the
tests can be used with no environment variable gymnastics.

Regards

Tim

I have a first version of 2) ready.  The file

  http://miles.shef.ac.uk/~jjg/cpt-city-svg-2.02.zip

is the same as the SVG zipfile on the cpt-city site, except that
all subdirectories contain a file DESC.xml, with a data

dir - the subdirectory name, such as "jjg"

name - the description of the subdirectory given in link in the 
   parent directory "Technical gradients by J.J. Green"

full - the first sentence (or so) of the HTML description on
   the corresponding page in the site "Gradients mostly for 
   technical illustration"
 
These were autogenerated by a script which filled in the 
first 2 fields automatically, then I cut & pasted the "full"
field by hand.

The next versions of the zip file packages will contain these 
DESC files.

Comments, suggestions welcomed

Jim

Jim, that is great!

Thanks for the help, and keep us posted with any changes.
If you need any help or code don't hesitate.

Also, this time there shouldn't be a Python change - there is no Python 2.8, and 3.x is a big jump (not just for Apple).  Can you verify the default Python version is still 2.7? (it will still be there anyways)  In any case my Python installers should be able to reinstall Python modules removed by the upgrade.

I'm running ML on my machine also. Here's the default python:
/usr/bin/python --version
Python 2.7.2

Hi I have very annoying flickering white box when using drawing, editing
or measure tools. It seems that the box appears always when using some
rubber band items.

Debian Wheezy, Gnome 3, QGIS installed from  http://qgis.org/debian

Can anybody confirm ?

Hi Marco, I think this ticket is about flickering stripes in map canvas
when dragging (I follow closely recent thread with Matthias Kuhn).

My problem is for example, when drawing a new feature, white flickering
box appears around this feature. The same with measure tool and other
rubber band items.

Hi Marco,

I start to see the real problem. It's a pretty tough one to solve without the threading branch.

One solution I could think of is to ignore certain (problematic) events while rendering vector layers. This would enable us to still process key events (e.g. for esc) but I think partial drawing of vector layers will remain problematic (as this implies triggering a repaint afaics).

As I'm not sure a) if this approach really works and b) it has no side-effects and c) it does only solve part of the problem I'm really wondering if it's worth it.

I could still invest a little more time to resolv this issue, but if the threading branch will be ready for the next release anyway (and this surely is the way to go) there is probably more important work to be done now.

Regards,
Matthias

Hi Matthias

Disabling that piece of code means there is no possibility to interrupt long rendering with the 'esc' key. Also the possibility to have an incremental screen update will be gone (e.g. every 10000 features).

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Best practices to run multiple QGIS versions on
	same machine
Message-ID: <501B9C3D.2030808@gmail.com>

Hi,
I would like to ask, what is the best practice to run two and more
different QGIS versions on the same machine.

I have QGIS 1.8 installed from regular Debian packages and QGIS master
from GIT repository compiled and installed locally to my home folder. As
time goes on, these versions will differ more and more. I am worried
about corruption of ~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS.conf and other user
settings files and QT databases when switching between these versions.

Is there any better way than to make some wrapper script which will
always change setting files depending on the currently running QGIS
version ?
How do You compare some feature across two different versions ?

Thanks

I did some tests on Debian Squeeze machine (Gnome 2) with 1.7 and 1.8.
There are also some flickering stripes around rubber bands but less
annoying than in Debian Wheezy's Gnome 3.

Anybody else running Gnome 3 ?

I seem some problems too, particularly rasters don't show properly in
1.8 (no bands are selected), probably because of some settings from
qgis-master.

We might want to change the name of the QGis.conf (say QGis-dev.conf)
in the master version, and revert it before releasing.

Hi Ivan,
I am on GNOME 3 with the same problem, unfortunately!
It seems very difficult reach to a solution for!

Maybe I'm wrong, I guess that it is the same problem described in #4011
issue and it not depend on desktop
enviroment!<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment>

As it says, "when using a system SDK".  If you just compile for your current system, with no SDK options, you don't need to do this.

I suppose this should be removed, since I was aiming for simple current system builds in the instructions.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] color ramps improvements
Message-ID: <501BDAFD.5020203@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Just tried the improvements by Etienne & Jim:
- quite nice to have the same ramps for both vectors and rasters
- it would be very good if the download & unzip of colour ramps would be
made automatic, single-clicky-style
- would be good if one could filter them by metadata (e.g. "slope")
- how about setting a few of them by default (e.g. for dtm, slope,
etc.), without the need for the user to create a new one?
- the clutter could be reduced removing some of the ramps already
present, especially beacuse most of them are derived by ColorBrewer,
already present in cpt
- one very important feature of the 1-band plugin, still missing here,
is the capability of classifying based on equal area, etc.
- the raster layer property dialog should be made more clear, and more
homogeneous with that of vectors.
Thanks a lot for this great improvement!
All the best, and many thanks.

By my investigation, it seems that the situation is worse in Gnome 3
than in Gnome 2. I have found it nearly impossible to work with Gnome 2.

Can anybody compare ? What abou XFCE or Unity ?

Hi all.
As we are quickly approaching the end of GSoC, I would be grateful if
mentors could let us know what are the expected outcome. It would be
good if the work could be merged before the end, so that serious bugs or
conflicts could be solved before having the student leaving for real
holidays.
All the best, and thanks.

As Paolo has written,

I have merged two features - color ramps for rasters, and cpt-city color ramps

I have also implemented some new tests - new file testqgsstylev2 for
gradients (generic, ColorRamp and cpt-city), and also in
testqgsrasterlayer, to make sure the gradients render correctly.
I would encourage others to write some tests for rendering of vector
layers as there was nothing of the sort yet.

Please send me feedback and suggestions, with the understanding that
this is a first implementation and needs some refinement - based on
your feedback!

I am investigating (with the help of Jim) which files we could
distribute with qgis (only those with an explicit license  that allows
us to redistribute, such as CC3, GPL, GPLv2, Apache), and would
appreciate any comments on

1) how could we distribute those - media (optional package, zip file)
and format (native svg, qml, one big xml file)
2) how many should we distribute, which ones, and how to group them?

answers below:

is there an existing infrastructure for this in qgis/qt to do the following?

1) download the file
2) unzip - I have added the GDAL funcitons to read zips, but not sure
if it's easy to unzip a file.

where would you get the metadata from?  There is metadata for author,
group, but not for each gradient. Do you mean the gradient name?

Someone would have to step in, select a few and propose them. These
would be part of the symbols available by default.

I think that this will be easier once Arun's work on symbology
grouping and "social styles" is merged.

I have just made a basic structure to browse the gradients.

Are you talking about clutter in the style manager or the cpt-city dialog?
If the latter - In this case you have about 3-4 groups which are
duplicated, out of more than 100, so I don't see how it adds to
clutter.

I thought about removing the ColorBrewer option(as they are available
in cpt-city), but it is still relevant because there are fewer options
to choose from and it is simpler (and nicer) to work with.

This topic is more related to how the gradient is applied to the
raster/vector, so this sort of lies outside of the cpt-city dialog (I
think) - unless those classification methods are tied to specific
gradients?

Another functionality from 1-band plugin that is missing is the
possibility to invert colors and palette. This would be very useful,
but should it be inside the style manager or in the vector/raster
layer dialogs?
Because you can select

I agree - perhaps you can submit a mock-up?

hmm do you mean the selection view? Because aside from that there is
no "theme" grouping yet.

quite the same as for plugins: I guess having the same widgets for
installing plugins, styles, and ramps would be a great plus, both for
users and for developers.

yes, name is often descriptive enough - when not, we can probably add tags?

ok, let's start:
- at least one DEM
- one batymetry
- a red, a green,and a blue scale
- one "semaphore" (green to red through yellow)
- two other diverging
- more?
Maybe we could make a poll? I'm sure specific sectors have their
requirements.

NB: palettes with transparency are not previewed in a meaningful way.

in the style manager: we have now a long list of gradients, and the New
ramp entry could be easily overlooked.

I think adding only the default ones (see above), and letting the users
build the others, should be ok.

some of them yes. some gradients should be applied on absolute numbers,
not relatively (e.g. slopes, DEM).

IMHO, in the layer dialog.

I mean in the cpt-city color ramp dialog (View is by default switched to

this is done in python - which has builtin functionality for unzipping files.

It might be better to invest in a plugin which can download the file
as well as look for updates periodically. Jim is working on some
python code to do that.

Perhaps the people working on the GSoC symbology project (Arun's work)
can give us any insight as to how the sharing of symbols works?

again - this depends on Arun's work in progress. I'll have a look at his code.

yes - it might be nice to have items for creating new elements inside
each box? I mean one for each type: *new gradient* *new random* *new
CollorBrewer* *new cpt-city*

I think mimicking the installer behaviour (possibly sharing code with
it) would be the way to go: having a list of the ramps, with a
description and/or a preview, and making it possible to download them,
individually or (better IMHO) by group.

I can do something on this for a couple of days next week. Help will be
appreciated, as I'll not be able to keep on the work afterwards.
The problem with a poll is the large number of ramps.Perhaps we can just
ask qgis-users ML to send us their preferred ramps?

yes, I just see a rectangle, sometimes white, sometimes red.

BTW, ColorBrewer and cpt-city are meaningless to the average user:
better give more standard names.

agreed. how to choose absolute values then?

having too many selection makes life complicated for the user.
if we really think it is necessary, we can hide in and Advanced options
panel.

I realized this after writing - can we add the missing info for the
grouping?
Much more neat and usable IMHO.
All the best.

For instance, I know in GRASS there is a palette for CORINE: it would be
good if I could just type corine in the filter, and find it.
BTW, other ramps have meaningless previews, e.g. grass/ramp and
grass/population (1 color??).
All the best.

that's very complex, I'm not willing to do that sorry.

The most I could do is prepare a "free-to-distribute" selection that
could be either inclueded in QGis or downloaded, and allow to download
the entire database from the cpt-city website, as well as having a
means to get a minimal list (probably the same as the
"free-to-distribute" selection.

no bother then. I'll put this as a thing to fix on a wiki page I'm preparing:

I don't understand what you mean - there should be more files in the
groupings? Or info (what info?)

It would be good if you could add it as a wish to the wiki page you
mention.

I think we can ask user to choose from cpt-city rather then from qgis
(agreed, it will take a while before many users can check).

I mean tags, like "dtm", "slope", etc. - or simply add it to the
description.
All the best, and thanks.

How about the ability to import/read/use cpt files from CPT city?


http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/

There is a huge number of cartographic (& other) colour ramps/palettes for users to tap into from many authors & packages.

Providing an easy way for QGIS users to make use of these would be a valuable asset.

Cheers,

Brent Wood

quite the same as for plugins: I guess having the same widgets for
installing plugins, styles, and ramps would be a great plus, both for
users and for developers.

ok, let's start:
- at least one DEM
- one batymetry
- a red, a green,and a blue scale
- one "semaphore" (green to red through yellow)
- two other diverging
- more?
Maybe we could make a poll? I'm sure specific sectors have their
requirements.

NB: palettes with transparency are not previewed in a meaningful way.

agreed - see my other thread on GSoC, who was triggered by this issue.

in the style manager: we have now a long list of gradients, and the New
ramp entry could be easily overlooked.

I think adding only the default ones (see above), and letting the users
build the others, should be ok.

some of them yes. some gradients should be applied on absolute numbers,
not relatively (e.g. slopes, DEM).

IMHO, in the layer dialog.

perhaps someone with better designing skills is more suitable.
IMHO the default interpolation should be linear, not discrete.

I mean in the cpt-city color ramp dialog (View is by default switched to

All the best.

Hi,

perhaps you didn't catch the previous discussion on this list (subject
"Raster colours"), or you  didn't read this thread closely. Admittedly the
subject of this thread does not mention cpt-city, but...

This is EXACTLY about using the cpt-city files (although their svg variant)
to make color ramps.

Tomorrow this should be in the linux and windows developpment builds, if
you want to check it out - it is in qgis master git.

Hi Matthias,
do you think that this problem is the same as discussed it this [1]
thread ?

It is stlll not clear to me what to do with QtSDK (i.e. Qt 4.7.4) and
XCode 4.x with Command Line Tool for compiling QGIS in Mac OS X.

Tim has this wiki - Building QGIS 0.8 with Qt4.x for Ubuntu.

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BuildingQuantumGisPoint8FromSource

Can some lighten me how to use QtSDK 4.7.4 for Building QGIS in Mac OS X?

How can I incorporate qmake in my system?

It seems that I can't use qmake in my terminal right now.

This is because the place where qmake is installed with the SDK is not
in your PATH environment variable.

You will need to edit ~/.bash_profile (create if not there yet) and
add the path to the 'bin' you noted to the PATH variable:

export PATH=/path/to/sdk/bin:$PATH

Then, log in to a new Terminal session (e.g. restart Terminal). qmake
will be found and can be used in compiling.

Read 'man bash' for more details on its config files.

I will be available on #qgis channel on irc.freenode.net most of the
day today, if you want more help (nickname of 'dakcarto').

Do we still need cmake for building QGIS Mac OS X when using QtSDK (i.e. qmake)?

This instruction below.

Copied from Building QGIS for Mac OSX (below)

#######
  5.3. Install CMake for OSX
  ==========================

Get the latest source release from here:

http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

Binary installers are available for OS X, but they are not recommended
(2.4 versions install in /usr instead of /usr/local, and 2.6+ versions are a
strange application). Instead, download the source.
NOTE: 2.8.5 is broken for detecting part of Qt. Fixed in 2.8.6.
Double-click the source tarball, then cd to the source folder and:

  ./bootstrap --docdir=/share/doc/CMake --mandir=/share/man
  make
  sudo make install

It seems that compiling in Linux (i.e. Ubuntu) as outlined by Tim
(below) is much easier to understand than the instruction in Mac OS X.

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BuildingQuantumGisPoint8FromSource

Is the instruction above using qmake instead of cmake?

Would it possible we can iron out this document i.e. building QGIS in
Mac OS X to make it easier for use to understand and compile QGIS in
Mac OS X?

Thanks.

Yes CMake is necessary. qmake is used to query where Qt components are
installed. See results of:

qmake -query

CMake is the system used to aid in the cross-platform compiling of the
C++ code QGIS is written in and uses the information provided by qmake
during its configure process. qmake is not used for this purpose, like
when compiling other Qt programs. Though, I'm not sure if qmake is
used for anything else in the compiling process.

If it doesn't say 'optional' in the INSTALL notes, it's not. INSTALL
is up-to-date and accurate, excepting anything that might pop up
during Mt. Lion testing. Also, INSTALL is the most up-to-date
document, with other sources possibly helpful with problems
encountered, i.e. use INSTALL as your guide.

One thing that might be good to add to the Mac OS X INSTALL notes is
optional install of ccache, currently only noted for Linux installs:
3.4. Setup ccache (Optional). It installs and works fine on Mac.

Since it takes some time to compile QGIS, ccache offers a significant
speedup on subsequent compiling, especially if you do not switch git
branches. However, I recommend you get QGIS compiled first before
adding optional ccache support.

Hi Larry,

> installed. See results of:

I downloaded cmake-2.8.8-Darwin64-universal.dmg from

http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

and installed it.

Command line is installed in  /usr/bin  <-------(default install)

The installer asked me where to install the command line (default is /usr/bin).

I hope this OK.

Thanks.

Read the instruction about CMake.

Corrected the installation

It is now  in /usr/local/bin

Yes, that's OK, but as a general rule, you want to avoid installing
non-essential software in /usr/bin; instead use /usr/local/  or  /opt
for installs needing to be available to all users. When you install
software from source it usually has a 'prefix' of /usr/local that will
be used. For example, when installing cmake from source, I end up
with:

[larrys]$ which cmake
/usr/local/bin/cmake

Again, I'm available on #qgis channel on irc.freenode.net most of
today, if you want more help (nickname of 'dakcarto'). Step-by-step
questions, like you are asking, are better suited for that
communication platform. (Plus, you might get quicker answers :^)

That's a problem to ask on the PyQt list.

Any suggestion of the better SIP and PyQt version that works with QGIS?

Which SIP and PyQt version that works with QGIS?

Yes, I also think it is not worth to invest too much time for a 
short-term fix. Maybe it would be good to have a user option to choose 
between flickering  vs no interuption and no incremental update on X11. 
That would be a very quick thing to implement.

Hi Ivan,

As far as I can see, it is very likely that these issues are related.

If you want to be sure and you are able to compile qgis by yourself, you
can check the patch I attached in the other thread.

Regards

I hope this isn't counter productive, but I've found the macports system to be a useful way of understanding the steps to compile on OSX. Essentially, a portfile in macports has the instructions for downloading the unix source code, has a set of patch files to the unix source/makefiles, and lists the other packages that are required as dependencies. It does take a little while to understand the macports system, but when it works compiling from source is as simple as "sudo port install qgis".

I havent tried macports' qgis on mountain lion, so there may be issues. But if there are issues you could fix them in the portfile and contribute the fixes to the rest of us that way.

I think you must have something else going wrong on your system. Perhaps your mixing too many different build systems. I use homebrew and it is fine for me on Mountain Lion. I don't have any more specific information for you, but you might see what 'brew doctor' tells you and take it to the homebrew mailing lists/forum.

Regards,
John

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Moving SEXTANTE into QGIS core
Message-ID: <CALCNqkZANVDq4qR_eFmRh1RahQ7=XGqD-5QPeWdvhmkJ0AZeDg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All (Especially Paolo and Victor)

For interest of others, Paolo, Victor and myself had an offlist
discussion about the procedure for moving SEXTANTE into QGIS core.
This weekend I took the first step my exporting the SEXTANTE plugin
from svn and bringing it over to the QGIS repo with all it's history.
The code still sits in a branch because there is no CMake support for
it yet.

git branch --track sextante-import qgis/sextante-import
git checkout sextante-import

For those interested, the import is a snapshot of SVN revision 333.

Victor you can verify your history is intact using the github web browser:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/tree/sextante-import

Once we figure out the CMake requirements, we can go ahead and merge
it into master.

Regards

Tim

I need to know where "c++" is symbolic link.

/usr/bin/c++

( mine is broken)

Can somebody tell me the results when you double click "c++" in your
system, I am assuming that you install "Command Line Tools" or any dev
tools in your Mac OS X.

I fixed this error in Mountain Lion.

deleted c++ in /usr/bin

And did a symbolic link.

sudo ln /usr/bin/g++ /usr/bin/c++

Here's log when I install sip.

Hi,

Sorry to top post, but... I have not had any significant problems
following INSTALL to build master branch on Mt. Lion today. I have
just updated the Mac notes with some optional info on installing
ccache, and some cmake options for the external libspatialindex [0]. I
did not add any specific info about compiling on Mt. Lion to the
notes.

Here is, in broad steps, what I did:

* Updated fresh install Lion->Mt. Lion in Parallels virtual machine.

* Used kyngchaos.com installers for required (and some optional)
frameworks, etc. See below.
* Installed QGIS-1.8.0-2.dmg to verify. Seems to work fine.

* Installed XCode 4.4 and command line tools for 10.8 [1].
* Used Qt 4.8.2 open source binary libs, not SDK.
* Installed or compiled all dependent and optional software noted in
INSTALL, except Globe dependencies.
* Edited /Library/Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Versions/4/Headers/qglobal.h
to remove excessive warning notices of 'unsupported OS X version'
during compile [2]. This should be fixed with next version of Qt.

Note: Xcode.app now contains all dev directory structure, and you can
use xcrun to work with it, but I preferred to install the command line
tools. You will probably want to uninstall any previous XCode version
first. I used the .dmg installers downloaded from my Apple developer
account, instead of Mac App Store. Not sure if the command line tools
(115 MB dl) can be installed, and work, without installing Xcode.app
(1.8 GB dl), since I installed Xcode.app first.

The only issues I ran into were errors in kyngchaos Python module
installers [3]. The kyngchaos supporting installers for QGIS and
PostgreSQL/PostGIS worked fine. This is what I installed (in order):

GSL_Framework-1.15-2.dmg
GDAL_Complete-1.9_2012-06-29.dmg
GDAL-MrSID_Plugin-1.9.1-1.dmg
GDAL-GeoPDF_Plugin-1.9.1-2.dmg
GDAL-ECW_Plugin-1.9.0-1.dmg
FreeType_Framework-2.4.9-1.dmg
cairo_Framework-1.12.2-1.dmg
SciPy-0.9.0-2.dmg
GRASS-6.4.2-4-Snow.dmg
QGIS-1.8.0-2.dmg

PostgreSQL-9.1.4-1.dmg
PostGIS-2.0.1-1.dmg
Psycopg2-2.4.5-2.dmg

Thanks for updating the documentation on Building QGIS for Mac OS X.

More tweaks and a bit more details documentation the better.

Now, here is proper logs for building SIP in accordance to the QGIS
Mac OS X needs. I am overdriving my homebrew install of SIP.

I am using the tarball of SIP (i.e. sip-4.13.3) after I fixed the c++ problem.

As we can see the SIP installed properly for PyQt to use for QGIS.

I just like to document this in the list so other Mac OS X (i.e.
Mountain Lion) users can use in the future including me :-).

Hi Larry,

Now, this is the tricky part using my qmake for PyQt and QtSDK.

I need help in this part.

#######

Based on the instruction (1)


python2.7 configure.py -d /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages -b /usr/local/bin


Nolis-MacBook-Pro:PyQt-mac-gpl-4.9.4 nsicad$ python2.7 configure.py -d
/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages -b /usr/local/bin
Determining the layout of your Qt installation...
Error: Qt has been built as static libraries so either the -g or -k argument
should be used.

#################

Now using the path:

python2.7 configure.py --qmake=/Users/nsicad/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/474/gcc/bin/qmake


Nolis-MacBook-Pro:PyQt-mac-gpl-4.9.4 nsicad$ python2.7 configure.py
--qmake=/Users/nsicad/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/474/gcc/bin/qmake -d
/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages -b /usr/local/bin
Determining the layout of your Qt installation...
Error: Qt has been built as static libraries so either the -g or -k argument
should be used.
Nolis-MacBook-Pro:PyQt-mac-gpl-4.9.4 nsicad$

########

Any ideas how to set this up properly (i.e. install PyQT with qmake)?

OK.

Figure it out with -g

python2.7 configure.py -d /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages -b /usr/local/bin -g

GPL v3

Read the license (scroll down)

Accept the license

Yes

make

sudo make install

########

I think this is important to include -g (as showed above).

I think this most important part of using QtSDK for Mac OS X is
~/.bash_profile file.

Create this file and add your bin and lib.

e.g.

export PATH=$PATH:/Users/nsicad/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/474/gcc/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/Users/nsicad/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/474/gcc/lib

#######

And editing the qglobal.h as mentioned by Larry.

It works in my case. It is compiling PyQt now.

Hey all,

It's just added the ability to use html (well Qt html subset anyway)
to the map tips.  Anything that is listed here on the Qt rich text
page is supported[0].

In order to support this I added a new tab in the vector layer
properties dialog called display which we can then use for adding
better (full) html support later.

Larry, probably you can incorporate this in Building QGIS in Mac OS X.

Thanks.

You configured Qt to compile static libraries!?  Your PyQt and QGIS binaries are going to be HUGE.  There are many separate binary components and much of the static Qt libraries will be redunandantly linked in to each one.  Even the Qt plugins will be large.

You should really recompile Qt as OS X frameworks.  If static libraries is the reason you compiled your own Qt from source, then you might as well install the prepackaged Qt binaries from Nokia and save yourself some grief trying to figure out all the changes needed in the QGIS install instructions.

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

You can install the command line tools from the app store version of Xcode. Open Xcode, then open Preferences and click on the 'Downloads' section at the top. You will see Command Line Tools as an install option from there.

Hi Paolo

Arun's work on symbology is going well and should be ready for a merge
to master branch soon. You can expect various improvements in
management of the style (grouping, tagging), better scalability
(symbols are stored in sqlite database rather than xml), unified
symbol selector with symbol properties dialog, downloading of styles
from internet and more :-)

Yes, I believe that was in the stackoverflow link I mentioned. I did
further tests to see if the CL Tools could be used independent from
Xcode.app (like it says on Apple's web site). However, there is no SDK
for 10.7 or 10.8 with the Tools, only embedded in Xcode.app (3.3 GB
installed on disk), and the Tools use those.

I think Apple has really made a mess of things, by requiring Xcode.app
and moving all dev structure inside of the app bundle - probably all
in the name of 'convenience' for new devs.

So, for now, the QGIS build notes for Mac should continue to recommend
full install of Xcode.app, IMHO.

Regards,

Larry

This is great.

Just 1 question: I started working with a git clone right away,
thinking the svn repo would be abandoned, but Victor tells me he is
still commiting to svn. Could this be a problem in a future merge?

Not I should be able to pull these changes through until svn is frozen.

The reason why I want to do this is because I have no experience with
GIT and I have now some ideas and more time that what I will have
after the end of the month, so I prefer to concentrate on developing
and not in learning how to properly use GIT, since I guess it is a bit
different and misusing it can cause trouble later.

If Camilo works on his own copy, how I can see his changes and work
with them if I use just the SVN repo ? I guess I have a more SVN-like
approach to version control after all these years (and some experience
with messy commiters that made use waste time...), so I see it a bit
more complicated.

If it is not a problem, I would prefer to keep on working on the SVN
and then freeze the SVN on the 20th as I mentioned, apply a big patch
to the GIT repo and from that moment work only on GIT.

Of course, comments are welcome, since maybe there is an easy way of
doing this in GIT (maybe Camilo can keep on working in his GIT repo
and commit changes to the SVN as well...)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Compile on debian
Message-ID: <CAK4m-3wqBw46ihyWdo7pB-WsNYihEVU_GpvpUX8nt2La9K-Fuw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I cannot compile QGIS on Debian because there is a problem with
qwt-qt4/qwt_global.h. During ccmake it return

CMake Error at cmake/FindQwt.cmake:35 (FILE):
  file Internal CMake error when trying to open file:
  /usr/include/qwt-qt4/qwt_global.h for reading.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:153 (FIND_PACKAGE)

this because I installed libqwt-dev and not libqwt5-qt4-dev because
they are in conflict. libqwt-dev provided qwt_global.h in
/usr/include/qwt/ but it seem not valid for QGIS. It's a bug or it is
not possible to compile qgis with libqwt-dev?

Thanks

Yes you can continue working in svn until you decide to freeze it,
then I will sync your changes across one way or another.

Camilo it might be better for you to do the same until Victor is ready
to make the switch. If you really want to work with git, you will need
to take my git-svn repo and copy it locally so that the uuids match.
Let me know and I will tar it up for you.

The first one is known to be broken. Are you sure you didn't test this one?

If that one still crashes, I'm out of ideas.

The strange thing is, that the warnings you posted on pastebin still appear for you. I'm pretty sure they disappeared on my machine. I'm currently working on a windows system, so I'm unable to verify right now.

You probably have a reference to libqwt5-qt4-dev in your
CMakeLists.txt, try deleting it before running cmake again (with all
the parameters).

I'm on Fedora Core 17, Qt 4.8.
But it seems odd to me, that qt changed these warnings, as there is a good reason for them to appear in the unpatched code and in the case they still appear with the patched code there would be a second call that can result in a paint event somewhere.
Just to be sure: is you qgis loading the correct qgis_core library (i.e. LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set or equivalent other measures taken)

Maybe a different QT versions. what kind of Qt, Linux distro do You use ? (Debian Squeeze is with 4.6.3 which is quite old)

Yes I set export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/ivo/apps/lib/

And I have:
~/apps/bin$ ldd qgis | grep qgis
	libqgis_core.so.1.8.0 => /home/ivo/apps/lib/libqgis_core.so.1.8.0
(0xb57b3000)
	libqgis_gui.so.1.8.0 => /home/ivo/apps/lib/libqgis_gui.so.1.8.0
(0xb54fb000)
	libqgis_analysis.so.1.8.0 =>
/home/ivo/apps/lib/libqgis_analysis.so.1.8.0 (0xb5472000)


I will try a clean build.

Hi Larry,
your tool is awesome! Users will love it. 

One thing is missing, or maybe I missed it: a shortcut to unhide a label. Is
it possible?  
I did not find any other way than manually changing label size to more than
0. 

Last thing missing with labels will be arrows..

Ok. I prefer git, but will switch back to svn, to make things easier
for everyone, till Victor is ready to make the switch. Will recommit
the last few changes to that repo.

BTW, Victor, when I was first figuring out git, this talk helped a
lot: http://vimeo.com/14629850

Message-ID: <CALuHMPDsTKHWLvznvjAZdW7KqsnsddXxBKFtrx2w4p4H2tQ3=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

since SEXTANTE will be a part of QGIS core soon (see [0] and [1]) so I want to
raise a new discussion related to it.

As all you know, currently SEXTANTE contains many providers. Some of them
partially duplicates existing core functionality of QGIS. First of all
I mean fTools
and GDALTools. I know, that currently only few "algorithms" from GDALTools are
moved to SEXTANTE and a bit more from fTools.

What are we going to do with this? Move all this algorithms to SEXTANTE and
remove separate plugins or keep both versions alongside? IMHO, we should
avoid duplication as this will confuse users and require some additional efforts
for maintenance.

The qgis_rasterlayertest is broken since
http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS&date=2012-08-04
It seems that it could have to do something with color ramps, failing
is raster_colorRamp3.
Does somebody working in those areas have any idea?

We run make test before each push, right?

Thanks! I have heard great things about git, and that is why I want to

Interesting topic. I think we should try to replicate those
functionalities and when they are fully supported in SEXTANTE, maybe
remove them in their original form.

Something that can be done while that happens is to wrap those
algorithms that are a bit harder to adapt to SEXTANTE, wrapping them
as SEXTANTE actions. That would mean that the algorithm can be called
from the SEXTANTE toolbox, but it is not really a SEXTANTE algorithm,
just an action that calls the original algorithm with its dialog. That
means also it cannot be executed in the modeler or batch processing
interface, but at least all analysis stuff would be centralized in the
toolbox. In short, changing the way of calling those algorithms, from
a menu item to an entry in the SEXTANTE toolbox. That adds some
homogeneity and is probably less confusing, IMHO

I agree, full Xcode install is required. I only wanted to point out that you can do an App Store install of Xcode, then install the command line tools from the preferences of the Xcode app. I think that is more streamlined than opening a Dev account, etc. Of course, if you're building qgis from source, you should be more advanced than the average user, so either way works fine.

Cheers,
John

Hi

Those are new tests I pushed last Friday. The tests ran OK on my
machine, and I noticed today that they failed elsewhere.
I am about to push fixes for this and also other things that are
related to those failures (cpt-city and color ramps).

I thought that any failures would be caught by Tim's Jenkins server
and I would have received and email.

BTW there are still intermitted failures in qgsexpressiontest that
have been around for some time.

I have a good news. When building on Debian Wheezy with Gnome 3 and QT
4.8.2 I have no QPainter warnings and no resize crashes. Strange, but
maybe a newer QT has fixed something.

Thanks for You work Matthias.

Thank you for the information Ivan,
I was already setting up a virtual machine on Squeeze to verify.

if I understand correctly, you tested a patched 1.8?

I'll fork 1.8 and commit a configurable fix for this, so hopefully we
can get this as a quickfix to be released with the next 1.8 upgrade on
the distros.

Do you mean with or without the patch?
I am on Debian/weezy (GNOME 3) with QGIS (current master) compiled against
QT 4.8.2 and I get QPainter warnings on resize!
Are you sure you compiled with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Debug?

I mean WITH patch (on release-1_8 branch, with little adjusting to fit
to this version).

Did You applied patch ?

I am not sure I really need CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Debug, but I am building
it with debug option set now to be sure.

You have to change this settings in QGIS.conf
(~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS.conf)

from
[Raster]
defaultRedBand=1
defaultGreenBand=1

Sorry, but my test was without patch!
Anyway I did try the patch in current master and the flickering is
disappear, but when run QGIS I get an exception: std::bad_alloc.

No warnings with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Debug. No crashes on resize.

I had fun building the tool. Since the underlying code from Martin and
Marco H. was so well done and readable I was able to somewhat quickly
add on to what they made.

I really needed the functionality of the tool I made. It's kind of a
testament to the project that someone with my C++ coding skills can
download and understand the source, tinker around with it, make
improvements, have them peer-reviewed and eventually committed for
others to try out. And, I even want to learn more about coding C++!

Yes this is possible. I have thought about several ways to accomplish
it and think I've come up with a good interactive implementation:

* Add a new Show Label data-defined column that will contain 1 or 0
(shown or hidden). This can then readily be mapped to a checkbox in
various ui forms. The PAL labeling engine will be updated to key off
of that field for showing /hiding labels, while still retaining
current method of font-size manipulation.

* Change code for hiding label to just setting Show Label field to 0.

* Add to the Freeze/Thaw tool the ability to Shift+Ctl+click-or-drag
on feature(s) (not label) to show label again. This would just set
Show Label to 1.

Other than Show Label just really needs to be added, it also allows
the mapped label size field to retain its value. Otherwise, an
automated showing of a label won't know what size to input into the
field. Lastly, these features should be added to Change Label dialog.


Here are other improvements I am thinking of adding to the labeling
tools, while the label tools and PAL labeling engine code is still
fresh in my head:

* Move freeze/thaw tool methods to base QgsMapToolLabel class. This
will allow adding to move and rotate label tools so they can have
those capabilities when selecting with a rubber-band marquee. Won't
have to constantly switch back-and-forth between tools anymore.

* Add frozen and frozen-but-editable highlight colors to app prefs.

* Improve Change Label dialog:
- Temporarily add (colored) PAL solution x, y, rot info to specific
fields if nothing is data-defined yet.
- Add ability to set relevant fields to NULL (instead of just 0).
- Show expression output for label Text and make non-editable if using
expression.
- Add Apply button and function, allowing dialog to stay open after
changes (tracking/reverting undo stack for Cancel operation).
- Add ability to select features, not just labels, to adjust aspects
of hidden labels.


> Last thing missing with labels will be arrows..

Do you mean call-out lines or arrows that automatically stay connected
to a label's corner  and a destination point? If so, yeah, that would
be very cool. There is already the QgsComposerArrow class that could
jump-start implementing such a feature.


Please let me know what you think of these ideas, and if you have any
others. I have several other ideas and will look at adding a new wiki
page for improvements to the new labeling tools, which would be
different than adding back in missing features noted here:

It could be some another problem with master. Are You sure it happens
only with the patch? Did You applied correct version (mine version is
for 1.8, Matthias's is for master) ?

Yes, it only occurs with the patch and when I run QGIS by shell!
I applied the patch as in attached, is it correct?

Yes I did too - I may have to register the email address of 'users'
committers which would probably be impractical. If you have and
android or a iphone, you may want to install the free Jenkins monitor

ok thaks

It would be nice if the 2 versions were interoperable! I frequently
switch from one to the other.

Hi all

Someone alerted me to PySAL today : https://geodacenter.asu.edu/projects/pysal

Does anyone have any experience with it? From a cursory glance at the
docs it seems they have a rich library of analytical functions that
would be awesome to have in SEXTANTE:

http://pysal.geodacenter.org/1.4/library/index.html

I havent looked to see what kind of dependencies it has yet....

PySAL is great, I already had it in my list. However, it is complex
and there are no ready-to-use algorithms, but a great collection of
basic functions to combine, some maybe we should think about something
like the R link.. That is, to expose PySAL through SEXTANTE, making it
easier to use.

I have not worked much on that, but from what I have seen in the API
and the examples, it's a bit harder than adapting other libraries.

Anyway, sounds like a great goal to achieve for 2.0, so I woul love to
work on that once we fix other things :-)

Nice addition. Works great.

I noticed the layout looks a little funny on Mac [0].

Also, I ran across a GPL-licensed WYSIWYG HTML the other day that
might be useful to slim down and strip out fluff, then include into
QGIS core for HTML editing widgets like this [1]. Doesn't have to be
WYSIWYG, per se, but nice for users. Built during Qt 4.5 release so
should work for QGIS distribution Qt base, although might benefit from
a reworking with regards to some 4.6-introduced stuff like QWebElement
[2].

If I understand you correctly on this improvement idea, a hearty +1 from me.

My read on this is that layers without x, y, and rotation fields will store frozen label information and allow them to be placed despite lacking those fields. Ideally, upon committing the changes (i.e., taking the layer out of editing mode), a prompt to save the information and assign to existing or create the appropriate fields would be given to the user.

Is this right, or am I day-dreaming? My test last week on a handy layer did not allow me to move labels because I did not have said fields identified or available.

Cheers,
John

Unfortunately, you're dreaming. ;^) What I was referring to was a
situation where your table already has the columns (x, y and rotation)
and has them mapped, but they still contain NULL values. I've recently
updated the move tool to automatically freeze all of the PAL
solution's data on initial move (before rotation and alignment were
not used).

But, with the Change Label tool, if you haven't frozen or moved (also
frozen) a label's location data (i.e. still a dynamic label), the x, y
and rotation form fields are all set to 0 (representing NULL) [0]. You
basically can't put anything in the x or y fields because you probably
have no accurate idea what it would be; so you end up having to freeze
the label by other means first. However, the would-be frozen PAL data
from the label can be loaded into the fields (I'm now thinking with a
Load Position button). Then, clicking OK will essentially freeze the
label, just like with the other two tools, but with the added ability
to edit right before freezing.

Your idea of creating the columns is great. I don't think I would do
it after editing though. If it failed, you might lose your temporal
data. A better solution might be to incorporate an 'Add Columns to
Data Source' button in the data-defined settings section, that would
be greyed-out if not in edit mode or the fields already exist[1]. This
is a layer-level action, so it's better suited to that dialog than
with the Change Label manipulation tool.

Generating the columns could also automatically map them for labeling.
A nice feature to an 'Add Columns...' button would be the option to
pre-define default values to populate the column fields with. Then,
advanced labeling could basically be all GUI-based for general usage,
except for later batch-editing (for which I also have some ideas).

Check out R?gis's 'EasyCustomLabeling' plugin for another, separate
memory layer approach.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] raster in qgis 1.8 and 1.9
Message-ID: <1344317566340-4993536.post@n6.nabble.com>

i'm trying to find the difference between raster management in qgis ver. 1.8
and 1.9. but there are some features that i don't understand.

as it has already been stated in other threads, qgis has some problems
(error ?) in treating the value "no data" in raster.
it makes some confusion in applying transparency to no data, and so the only
way I found to get around this problem is to reclassify the raster
immediately after a raster has been created (for example through the
application of raster operations).
Using the Sextante-saga reclassification module and immediately i convert no
data to -99999 value and this valued is suited for transparency.
Needless to say how much this is annoying but now it seems that between
version 1.8 and version 1.9 there is no continuity.

I'll explain: Having dealt with a raster in version 1.8 as mentioned above,
I would expect to (not) see no data in the version 1.9.
instead it seems that the classification made ??with Ver. 18 is not
recognized by ver. 1.9 and so it begins again.

is it so, or I'm missing something?

s.

ps: please open attached raster with 1.8 and 1.9
1.8: colormap, three classes 
1.9: singleband pseudocolor, three classes
please see, how "no data" in 1.9 don't disappear

Hi!

Tried to load your rasterfile in 1.8 and current master and nodata is
correctly identified as -99999 in both ..

But with one thing you are right .. It seems to get loaded differently ..
while in 1.8 I get the min-max values right after loading i have to go
into properties with master to change the classification ..

But if you mean that I assume that is due to heavy changes in the way
rasters are handled by qgis in master..
(Beside the fact that the GUI for that has changed a lot)
As it is master and not any released version I think there will still
be some changes and there might be probably errors right now ..
So if you think you really found a bug .. just report it as a bug and
we'll see how the developers handle it ..

kind regards
Werner

Hi Salvatore,

What do you mean with "run QGIS by shell"? Is there another way you can
run your self-compiled version and it works?

I started working on a git repo, based on 1.8. So far only the patch
adjusted by Ivan for 1.8 is applied.

https://github.com/matthias-kuhn/Quantum-GIS.git release-1_8
(Watch out: it's not on the master branch!)

Matthias

I am not able to get it working, I have filled
  Host: jenkins.linfinity.com
and let other options defaults, but Test configuration gives:
  Connection test PASSED
  Login test PASSED
  Retrieve views test FAILED
If I try to connect, it gives "Error while loading data: Internal
server error - 500"

Is it working for you? What params do I have to fill in?

Hi John, 
I will try to publish today or tomorrow a plugin that heps with that. It
copies a layer into memory layer and add all fields necessary for advanced
labeling.  
I 'll notice the release here soon. 
Cheers.

It would be, but I guess that for sometimes things have to change.

from a user point of view, using expression is really great, but.. there are
always some labels people want to change manually... If you're on the way to
add a new labeling column for display, why not dicussing of a field
dedicated to storing expression result, if modified by hand. I create that
column in my plugin (labelfield), in which a user can calculate an
expression in attribute window. That way, original labeling fields are not
destroyed.  That could allow a user to manually edit the result of an
expression. A rollback option to return to dynamic expression would be nice
then.. Thoughts?

 I don't know exactly what are call-out lines (is that something like that? 
http://indesignsecrets.com/drawing-a-good-callout-line-for-illustrations.php
http://indesignsecrets.com/drawing-a-good-callout-line-for-illustrations.php
) 

I meant "Arrows that automatically stay connected
to a label's corner  and a destination point ". That would be nice as a
beginning. In my python plugin, I can duplicate a labeling memory layer into
a arrow layer between centroid of original geometry and new XY for label.
Great if label is eastern (right)  of object because XY of label points
lower left corner. If label has been moved more to West (left) .. this is
ugly an user has to edit arrow by hand. We should compute Label displayed
size on screen, and have the arrow start from lower right corner in that
case. I don't know how to do that in python. Maybe in C++, you can handle
lable objects ?

Hi,

I mean, running QGIS by CL interface (shell bash linux).
Also I noticed that the exception does not always occur!
Oddly, if I run QGIS (CLI) by the following command: $ qgis --lang us
(adding option --lang),
everythings works fine, while by typing $ qgis, it raises to the Exception.

Yes, by clicking on shortcut icon on my dashboard,
simply because in my shortcut I set the command "qgis --lang us"

Hi all,

There is now a config option to turn this fix on and off
( Setting=>Options=>Rendering: Enable backbuffer )

The more people that test it, the better are the chances to get this
into the main code.

Thanks to everybody who is participating in this discussion and testing!

Hi

You probably installed cpt-city from zip files before. You have to
remove the entire /home/paolo/.qgis/cpt-city directory, and try the
update again.

It's because the permissions of the contents of the original zip
file(not the one downloaded by the manager) are messed up (no write
permissions).

Let me know what you think!

Etienne

Try pointing us to the code as your question is very abstract. Show us
what you have done and the specific api calls that you are struggling
with ....

Hi Jim,

actually when the files are extracted via python, the permissions are
ok, so this won't be a problem in upgrades. It seems that python zip
does not respect zipfile permissions and creates files with read+write
permissions. But it won't hurt to change the permissions in the zip
files.

Thanks
Etienne

IMHO we should first reach complete parity between a particular backend
and its Sextante equivalent, having it fully tested, and then remove it
from main. Doing it earlier will cause frustration for our users.
All the best, and thanks.

The refactor to support raster colour ramps is awesome stuff! It is
still very hard to find anything useful from the cpt chooser. I almost
wonder if it wouldnt be better to show them graphically in a long list
with the gradient name next to each.

Also would you mind making these available by default (if licensing
allows). Apologies if it is already in your last commit - I am still
using hte manual extracted cpt set.

Hi all.
Why not adding this tool, along with others designed for wildlife
radio-tracking, to a specific menu entry? We have created the AniMove[0]
entry for this. We can change the name if useful.
All the best.
[0]http://www.faunalia.it/animove/

Plugin name is: Points to Paths
Plugin description is: Converts points to lines with verticies grouped by a text or integer field and ordered by an integer or date string field (based on PointsToOne, but intended for wildlife tracking data)

Hi Victor,

I understand the idea of including all plugins in Sextante, even if only as a wrap for the first times. I just wonder if it will raise some confusion for users who are not aware of this, when they realize that there are algorithms that can not be used in modeler and in batch. They may be led to think that this is a bug in these algorithms. Will need to find a way of, at least, alert users to it.

But just think about having all QGIS plugins within Sextante, and soon, all scriptable or usable in modeler, makes my day happier! :)

Best regards,
Pedro

Something that can be done while that happens is to wrap those
algorithms that are a bit harder to adapt to SEXTANTE, wrapping them
as SEXTANTE actions. That would mean that the algorithm can be called
from the SEXTANTE toolbox, but it is not really a SEXTANTE algorithm,
just an action that calls the original algorithm with its dialog. That
means also it cannot be executed in the modeler or batch processing
interface, but at least all analysis stuff would be centralized in the
toolbox. In short, changing the way of calling those algorithms, from
a menu item to an entry in the SEXTANTE toolbox. That adds some
homogeneity and is probably less confusing, IMHO

Hi,

there is a special user group in our wiki [0]. Some tools already
listed there. Maybe if there is an interest to this theme we can
increase activity in this direction.

Personally I am not a fan (not yet anyway) of removing the plugins in
favour of an interface though only Sextante.  I would be happy if
fTools could be interfaced and scripted though Sextante but removing
from the Vector menu at this current time would be very bad IMO.

I'm already working on moving fTools to SEXTANTE and also
fix some existing bugs. As work is not complete I don't commit
it to the SEXTANTE main repo.

If anyone interested, I can upload existing code somewhere.
But don't expect much, currently only 15 algorithms reviewed
and I even didn't test them extensively

IMHO, better wait until sextante is in master: from there on, add all
the features, and keep a stable version on plugins.
All the best.

I don't know the SEXTANTE architecture well enough but surely we could
keep the vector menu in place and just delegate the work to some
SEXTANTE tool?

glad you like it!

I added a small preview for each entry, but still in the tree list -
there are 100 directories, each with quite a few gradients! Not sure
if we can present everything in a single page!
I'll be working on different ways to present them, all feedback is good!

How about the selection list, that group a selection of popular
gradients by categories?

The plugin I created grabs the .zip file from the cpt-city site. There
are still a few things to sort out before we can legally distribute
the files. We have to make a list of the ones which allow
re-distribution (most of them do). Also we should probably make a
selection, because the full list is like 4MB in zip, and much more
when unzipped.

Do you have any idea how we could distribute some of these files? By
default with qgis, as a seperate package (say qgis-gradients), or as a
zip file that the plugin could grab, hosted on qgis.org?
Another option would be to create gradients that are available in the
style manager, but we have to make sure we don't violate any licenses,

IMHO with such high numbers, appropriate tagging & filtering is the way
to go.
All the best.

Same for me. Maybe, it would be better to keep
the analysis tools more commons (maybe by call for vote)
also if it is duplicates in SEXTANTE for a lesser impact on the end user!

Yes but if they don't already have usable tags it is going to be a
huge effort. I think we should just select our say 100 free gradients
and ship with with QGIS by default. The selected should include a
reasonable range of use cases e.g. topo, bathymetry, etc

Sure, you can keep the menu, and even the custom dialog, and then call
the SEXTANTE algorithm from there. No difference for users, but a
great one for developers, since there would be just one piec of code
for that process.

Yeah exactly what I was thinking! Nice to know it will be easily
doable once there is feature parity with ftools.

Hi Matthias

I didn't try it yet, but from a first look at the patch source, it seems 
to me backbuffering is enabled by default:

settings.value( "/Map/enableBackbuffer", 1 ).toBool();

That would be ok on X11. But the windows users (who are not affected by 
the flickering) would loose the paint update / esc key interrupt without 
having an advantage. So either always execute processEvents() in vector 
layer for windows or disable backbuffer by default.

Apart from that, the patch looks fine and I'm happy to apply it.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Diagram improvements
Message-ID: <1344353844.1730.13.camel@kk-office.gslwd>

Hi,

I recently started an internship at Uster (a city in Switzerland). My
job will mostly be to improve QGIS. I'm really looking forward to this
great opportunity.

My first job is, to improve the diagrams. Any comments are highly
appreciated. (If you think something can be done better differently, if
you think something is useless, if you are already working on something
or you know about somebody already working on something, if you wanna
say thank you...)

Here a short list of what I've got on my ToDo list.

- Minimum size for diagrams (As an option, scale any diagram smaller
than...): Done
- Text diagram: Center text better vertically (As an option): Done
- Charts are not placed on some polygons (e.g. banana shaped polygons.
Should this be done with PAL library? Any help appreciated)
- Ordering: Draw smaller charts on top of bigger one instead of hiding
(randomly?) colliding diagrams.
- Make diagrams area accurate! By now the radius instead of area is
scaled.
- New diagram type: Bar chart
- New diagram option: Split diagrams. (Pie charts / Bar charts e.g. age
pyramid)

If you're interested in the current state of work, have a look at my git
repo [0] on master. Where it says done in the list above you should be
able to check it out.

[0] https://github.com/matthias-kuhn/Quantum-GIS.git

Regards,
I'm looking forward for comments

Disclaimer: Sorry if you get this topic the second time. I thought I'd
written something about it yesterday, but couldn't find it in my history
nor in the archives, so I'll repeat myself and just believe, that I
missed the send button when I tried to click it.

With 6000+ gradients that is easier said than done.  

The site has, presently, a set of "selections" (blues, topo, bath and so on) 
which myself and Etienne have discussed as forming the basis for such
QGIS sets (outline - XML file of gradient paths used to generate the
cpt-city 
pages and also to be downloadable, these could then be used to filter the 
GUI, or to make specialist sub-sets of zipfiles on the QGIS side).  That we
will have a look at after the zip download is tested and working.

As to the GUI navigation of such a large number of gradients, that is a
challenge.  I personally use the site itself as a selector, then when I find
the one I want, I copy-paste the path (which is listed under the preview
on each individual gradient's page, for exactly this purpose) into my
script.

eg on

 
http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/bhw/bhw4/tn/bhw4_003.png.index.html

the path is

  cpt-city/bhw/bhw4/bhw4_003

I've not had time to look at the QGIS selecter, if it does not have a 
"gradient path" input (ie, no extension, no base directory) then perhaps
it would be an idea to add one.

Jim

what good news! definitely, diagrams are in the need for some love.
I assume you are going to work on the newer implementation, right?
I think one very important thing is to implement the missing features
from the old diagrams, so that we can keep only one, and reduce redundancy.
A second issue is cleaning the interface, that most users find difficult
to understand.
When are you planning to issue a pull request against master?
Thanks a lot.
All the best.

Thanks for the review and good point.

I'll disable this option and remove it from the dialog on any other than
Q_WS_X11 or do you think this can be useful for Mac as well? (You
diabled some code and mentioned resizing as cause for this)

It  would be excellent if you can get the diagrams working in legends on
composers too.

what good news! definitely, diagrams are in the need for some love.
I assume you are going to work on the newer implementation, right?
I think one very important thing is to implement the missing features
from the old diagrams, so that we can keep only one, and reduce
redundancy.
A second issue is cleaning the interface, that most users find difficult
to understand.
When are you planning to issue a pull request against master?
Thanks a lot.
All the best.

6k? I didn't realized there were *so* many!
I think incorporating some user feedback (preferred, most downloaded,
maybe selecting a tag from a list) would help other users to find their way.
of course, this is outside this work, and should be implemented as a
general feature, to be reused for plugins and styles as well.
All the best.

Disabling is fine for Mac as well (Qt::WA_PaintOnScreen has no effect on 
Mac).

You're right, I'm working on the newer implementation. I hope that's the
one shown by default.
Do you know if there is a list of missing features I can refer to?

My plans are still pretty vague. I'll be working full time on diagrams
this week and will see with Andreas Neumann if I get more time for this.

But I'm sure there are some things to be pulled back upstream by the end
of this month.

Maybe I would disable it also for older QT versions to avoid strange
resizing crashes as we suffer yesterday.

Thanks for Your work.

Unsure about this, better check on a fresh install.

Not that I know of. Certainly there are a few tickets on this. I  think
it is important to revise the old implementation, and check which
features are missing from the new one. Histograms (already cited) are
the most prominent one, I guess.

Great, looking forward to it.

Yes. Having a separate label text column like that (I think) is fairly
common. But, I don't think it needs to be an additionally mapped
column, since it is already mapped, excepting when an expression
overrides it.

Having the label text column as part of an 'Add Columns to Data
Source' button solution would allow users to quickly generate it.

The rollback here could just as well be in the expression itself,
using the new CASE conditional with an expression-overridden field
test. Another good reason to move to rule-based labeling, like with
symbols, which would make setting up conditionals easier and
graphical.

Yes. Basically arrows without arrowheads. They often (though not
always) have a bend in the line, closer to the label, that makes the
line horizontal before connecting to the label, as illustrated on that
page. Also, having a contrasting stroke for the line allows the
callout to pass over contrasting backgrounds without 'disappearing'.
The horizontal aspect of the callout allows the label to be offset
(less clutter than straight lines) and offers design layout options
like grouping of labels into vertically-aligned columns.

The labeling manipulation tools utilize QgsLabelPosition queried from
the QgsLabelSearchTree, which is only available after a map canvas
render and the PAL engine creates the labels to be shown within the
extents of the viewport. In other words, the label has to be drawn.

With your plugin only referencing the x, y from the table for the
arrows, you would have to do width calculations on the label (like you
mentioned), which is not so simple, given the many font parameters and
line wrapping. (take a look into src/core/qgspallabeling.cpp to see
how its already done)

Another solution, if you don't mind shifting the text of the 'west'
labels, is to switch their data-defined 'Horizontal alignment' of the
label's rotation point to 'Right.' This will shift the label to be
appropriately to the left of the arrow start, and leave the label's
text in correct position to be edited without messing up the arrow
line again. (I haven't experimented with this, though)

Lastly, setting the 'Vertical alignment' of the label's rotation point
to 'Half' or 'Base' will allow the arrow line to start at a visually
reasonable point regardless of whether it is above or below the
arrow's destination.

Regards,

Larry

We need to establish is which directories (sets) have licences that
allow us to distribute with QGis (Apache, GPL, CC3, etc.). Some code
can assist but in the end it's safer to read each directory's
copyright information.

I was thinking of an interface to make zip files from selection lists.
The plugin would probably be suited for that, because it's not really
part of the core and it's much easier to write this sort of thing in
python. Ideally, we should have a point-n-click interface for
generating these selections, but I think it would be too costly to
implement. So a manual solution would probably be easiest on the
short-term. Unless we feel it's necessary to have users make their own
selections (by selecting favourites), and use that.

Perhaps a first step would be using the cpt-city selections which can
be distributed and generate a list from that.

Do people feel that the existing cpt-city "selection" would be
sufficient, or are there too many?
My feeling is that we could aim for parity between the cpt-city
selections and qgis selections (and excluding files for license
issues).

It would be nice if people could help out in

1) determining which directories we can ship with QGis - this would be
passed to Jim who would add this to each directory's metadata

2) build a list of core gradients

3) testing the rendering of the gradients (I have a solution that
compares the preview to the png's on the cpt-city website)

4) general testing and anything I might be forgetting


Anybody interested please advise!

It might be better to present all of the gradients in a given
directory in a single page, instead of the tree view?

The tree view would remain, but only for browsing by theme / author / whatever.

I dont think you need to make a selection "topo and free", just make
a selection "topo", and apply it to to the set of free files, ignoring those
not present.  This is quite generic, it can be used on the GUI, for 
generating zipfiles, whatever.

Selections should select only one thing, then different selections can
be combined to suit.  "dark" + "spectral" = "dark spectral" ...

Does the GUI render SVG?  I ask because the cptutils svgx program
can add a preview to an svg gradient file (so it becomes "self 
documenting"), so saving the bother of a extra png file or whatever.

I considered adding these previews to the SVG gradients on the 
cpt-city site, but with 6K files every byte in the file is 6KB on the site
...

That's what I meant - identify if the directory can be distributed,
and make a selection which would be filtered by the distribution flag.

So you are suggesting to add tags to each file? I was thinking more
like what you are doing: make a category an add the
gradients/directories which are in that category. But what you are
saying is basically the same.

Actually the gui (inside qgis color ramp selector) parses the svg, and
makes a preview pixmap. This is what qgis does for other gradients
(ColorBrewer, user-defined both for the preview and the actual
rendering).

Thanks for the tip, I'll look into that. Qt can render svg files
(presumably the preview you mention) with QSvgRenderer (part of the
QtSvg Module)

Hi all,

I have a few questions regarding the licensing restrictions regarding
the bundling of some gradient files from cpt-city.

First I would like to thank J.J. Green for his past and future help,
both in creating his archive and in his advice and help. Much of this
information is based on feedback from him.

Also it seems that the majority of the gradients made available in the
cpt-city package are free to distribute, as long as due attribution is
given.

I would like confirmation that artwork with the following licenses are
OK for us to distribute with QGis (as long as we keep the licensing
information along with the gradient files):

- GPL
- GPLv2
- Apache
- BSD
- MIT
- identified as "public domain"
- Creative Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0) /
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
- Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) /
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/
- Creative Commons (CC BY 3.0) / http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/


There are others which are less clear:

- "Free to use", without any license (e.g. cl/ ). It is my
understanding that we CANNOT distribute them unless explicitly allowed

- "Not specified" or no license information - safer not to distribute?

- "Link requested" (e.g. ds/ fg/ ) - where would we put the link, just
keep them in the files?   ds/ also says "can be used anywhere anytime"
but no mention on distribution

- "Attribution required" / "Credit Requested" - ok as long as we keep
the copyright info ?

- ESRI license is too complex for me, sorry. can someone have a look?
directory is ersi/

- "Disclaimer required" - the "New Jersey Geological Survey" gradients
require citation when they are used, better not to distribute then?

- "UK Open Government Licence" (e.g. os/ , ukmo/)  -
http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/

- gosquared "free for you to download and do whatever you want with
them" - http://www.gosquared.com/liquidicity/archives/822


So in general, if an author requires attribution or link, is it OK for
use to attribute and/or link by providing the original copyright
information?

Etienne

I was more thinking about incremental drawing.
At the moment processEvents is not called inside the vector renderer on Mac, so on this platform neither keytrokes (esc) nor incremental rendering is possible as far as I can see. If there is a good reason to leave it this way, I would hide the incremental drawing option for mac completely as I'm working on this code anyway.

Yes, good point. Please hide that option for Mac.

Good point.

This deserves deffinitely to be looked at.

Basic integration would have to include a rectangle with the colors for the pie-pieces (or bars...) with labels
Then attribute names should be customizable. Attribute names tend to be technical.
The more advanced part would include some size reference circles.

What else would be needed for such a legend?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin project problem
Message-ID: <B398947DCAB85D46809151E678999F210A7916E2@srv01.NPA.LOCAL>

I have submitted a plugin and I thought I would create a project page
for it as well. 

Doing this I have managed to creat a plugin project page but it didn't
add it as a sub project of the User Plugins. It seems to have added it
as a separate project 

How do I change this?

There was no add new sub project button on the User Plugins page so I
thought it would let me set this layer on.

What would also be useful is to be able to include a number inside the
pie segment to indicate either the percentage of the pie or the actual
number of whatever the segment represents (i.e. 10 apple out of 35
pieces of fruit in total rather than just being able to have 28%).

It would be good if this number could sit outside of the pie chart with
a line pointing into the segment that it refers to - excel does this
quite nicely.

I think you have covered most of the options needed for the legend - I
think the reference circle sizes is definitely needed.

Good point.

This deserves deffinitely to be looked at.

Basic integration would have to include a rectangle with the colors for
the pie-pieces (or bars...) with labels Then attribute names should be
customizable. Attribute names tend to be technical.
The more advanced part would include some size reference circles.

What else would be needed for such a legend?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] UPDATE: New Plugin - Edit Any Layer
Message-ID: <047d7b5dbfa82f6b2b04c6c0282d@google.com>

This plugin has now been uploaded to http://plugins.qgis.org/ and is  
awaiting approval (thanks Paolo).

Changelog:
* New icon
* Added comment to dialogue window
* Changed menu entry to "Edit Any Layer -> Create Editable Layer..."

Alister, thanks for the suggestions but, although the name "Copy as memory  
layer" would explain _what_ the plugin does, I will stick with "Edit Any  
Layer" as this explains _why_ you would want to run the plugin. I have also  
not added an option to copy selected items only (and this is low priority  
as this feature is in QGIS core UI).

Regards,
Rob

Brent,

thanks for the information. I am forwarding it to the list because I think
it is of general interest.

I am not sure I understand how we should notify users when a CC BY or CC
BY_NC-SA (commercial).

Do we have to show the author and copyright information along with the
gradient when user chooses it? Also, whenever it is displayed, for example
in the style manager main window?

I can imagine a simple text with the author name and informal license tag,
along with a link to get the entire copyright information.

thank,
Etienne

Go to settings->information, you can make it a sub-project of "user plugins"

Note that now the "user plugins" page has a "new subproject "link to
create a sub-project directly, although you have to be logged in I
think.

Thanks for the reply.

I do not see anywhere on the information page to change the sub-project.


There are fields for:

Name, Description, Indentifier, Homepage and Public. 

Then there are the Trackers and Customfields sections after this.

Also, if I go to http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins I do not
see the New Subproject link anywhere (I am logged in).

Go to settings->information, you can make it a sub-project of "user
plugins"

Note that now the "user plugins" page has a "new subproject "link to
create a sub-project directly, although you have to be logged in I
think.

Hmm perhaps I see these because I am a manager.

This is a known bug : http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5414. Please add
information there.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to color a raster with a color table with
	values From - To?
Message-ID: <50220A58.1080806@qlands.com>

Hi,

I am using QGIS API to develop a custom application. Currently I'm using 
QgsRasterLayer::PalettedColor + QgsRasterLayer::ColorRampShader  + 
QgsColorRampShader::ColorRampItem to render a raster using a specific 
color map.

Now, I need to render the raster with a colormap using value From - To 
however, ColorRampItem struct only accepts one value. Is there another 
way around? Or, its it possible to create user defined DrawingStyles and 
ColorShadingAlgorithms? If so how?

Any help is very much appreciated.

Regards,
Carlos.

Hi,

which version of the api are you using? If you are using the
development version (1.9), there is support for more flexible color
ramps with rasters, using QgsVectorColorRampV2. Beware, however, that
the api is going to suffer some changes in the near future. There are
various recent threads on this subject in this mailing list.

Another option (and the only available if using 1.8) is to follow the
approach used in the rasterlayer test in
tests/src/core/testqgsrasterlayer.cpp .
TestQgsRasterLayer::pseudoColor() uses a ColorRampItem vector and
calls colorRampShader->setColorRampItemList(items)

I have implemented a simple tagging scheme on the cpt-city site.  
If anyone would like to go through the site giving a unique tag
to a set of gradients ("QGIS:gravity", "QGIS:topo", whatever)
then I will have a list of those from which to generate a selection
which can then make its way (eventually) into QGIS

Cheers

Jim

Hi Stefan,
thank you. Can you tell me which version of GeoServer is it using and
which WCS client works with that? Does it work for you correctly in
1.1.1 version? I cannot get it working with 1.1.1, it is returning the
raster rotated, I checked all params and looked into GeoServer code,
everything seems to be OK, but result is rotated.

Hi Jim,

this is great.  I don't think the QGis: prefix is needed though - this
should be general...

Could you add relevant tags to the items in your selections? (e.g.
"GMT ocean" should have tag "bathymetry")

sure, but I mean that if you want to make a particular selection 
for QGIS then you can use the tagging facility to save that 
selection directly from the site.  The prefix and/or uniqueness
of the tag makes it possible for me to filter out the selection.

Generic tagging is also helpful, of course

Eventually, time permitting :-)

Yes, the request above has lat/lon order in BOUNDINGBOX, GRIDORIGIN
and GRIDOFFSETS (North America), that is not a problem.

Why not? Anyway, can you find in GeoServer code the place where the
output is rotated with params given above?

GDAL does not work with WCS 1.1 in geographic CRS because it does not
switch axis order.

AFAIK, the WCS version 1.0 should use cell edges (bbox) like WMS 1.x does.

Done

On X11: Show backbuffer checkbox / enable disable "incremental rendering" spinbox according to availability
On Mac: Disable backbuffer option (but check so user knows it's enabled) / disable "incremental rendering" spinbox
On Windows: Disable backbuffer option (but check so user knows it's enabled) / enable "incremental rendering" spinbox

I hope Windows doesn't care either about PaintOnScreen neither, because it's not set there any more now. But no problems on this win-system here. Couldn't test mac though, but the changes there where minimal.

Message-ID: <B398947DCAB85D46809151E678999F210A7917FC@srv01.NPA.LOCAL>

Hi all,

Just thought I would let you all know that I have created a new plugin
that allows you to add layers to and remove layers from the layerset of
a composermap object on a composer. It's in the QGIS official
repository.

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/lockedlayers

This is useful if you want to see what layers are currently locked to a
composermap, and also to alter the layerset without having to recreate
the layers in the map canvas and then unlocking and relocking the
composermap.

This is my first attempt at a plugin so hopefully it works well. Any
problems with it please let me know. 

I am hoping to improve it as time goes on, and eventually would like to
add it as a widget on the composer window.

James

Do you think circular diagrams (i.e. text and pie) need to have an option to scale their radius instead of their area?
In my opinion this is a bug in the current version and should be changed without option as it overexagerates bigger values. But maybe there is a reason to leave this choice to the user?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New "EasyCustomLabeling" plugin
Message-ID: <1344522679903-4994164.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,
Another new plugin advertising!

I just published this morning my first plugin here: 
http://planet.qgis.org/plugins/EasyCustomLabeling/
http://planet.qgis.org/plugins/EasyCustomLabeling/ 

*This plugin quicly duplicates a vector layer or only selected features into
a new memory layer, ready to use for data defined labeling. *

It duplicates all layer fields and adds specific fields for advanced
labeling. New layer is created with centroids of source layer,  keep it
light and fast.

"LabelField" can be used to store a multiline calculated label. It is filled
with source layer "display field" (layer properties / general).  Very
usefull if using QGIS 1.7 without expression generator, or if manual
modication is needed without destroying original data. 

If using "Memory Layer Saver" plugin, labels will be saved along with the
project as gml.
 *It works well with 1.7.4.*   
*There still is work to do with QGIS 1.8 and higher because of new gdal gml
behaviour *. Follow topic here to know more: 
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/Memory-data-provider-persistence-td4108012.html
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/Memory-data-provider-persistence-td4108012.html


RoadMap for the future:
  - flag off "experimental" as soon as memory layer saver issues are solved
  - Ask user format and location to save layer (shp, spatialite, gml) and
warn of possible incompatiblities with QGIS versions / Memory layer saver
versions.
  - add a "display label" field as discussed here: 
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/New-adv-labeling-freeze-thaw-tools-td4988479.html
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/New-adv-labeling-freeze-thaw-tools-td4988479.html 
  - propose such a function as a core plugin along with labeling utilies
(add custom labeling field to a data or duplicate in a new layer) 

Please send any report or feature request here :
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/easycustomlabeling
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/easycustomlabeling

Hi Rob , 
I just published a very close plugin : EasyCustomLabeling. You made me
finish it faster ! 

One first remark, I will open a dedicated topic, not sure it is a QGIS API
bug . 
If duplicating a layer with AttributeMap() , and AddAttribute() methods, if
source layer contains oid , fid or geometry fields that are not last fields,
ID's of fields are handled differently between AttributeMap() that fetches
id's, and addattribute that write ids..  
This is quite common with postgis.
First method fetches values with id calculated without those masked fields, 
the other one sees raw id's. As a result,  attributes are not writen in the
right column. 

We found a workaround be recreating our own field indexes every time.. Have
a look at the code  http://planet.qgis.org/plugins/EasyCustomLabeling/
http://planet.qgis.org/plugins/EasyCustomLabeling/ 

Cheers, 
R?gis

Someone on gis.stackexchange.com:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/29357/how-to-improve-the-display-of-color-images

says, about colour ramps:

"
 but in ArcGIS and QGIS, they don't seem to be easily usable for a
finished product because their complexity causes obvious steps rather
than a smooth gradient. The raster renderer appears to be stuck at an
8-bit palette (only 256 levels), rather than a mathematical transform
involving 24-bit standard RGB or deep 48-bit RGB.
"

 huh? I'm pretty sure the colours in the raster colour map dialog are
24 bit (#abcdef looks like 24 bits to me) so what are they on about?

 Anyone want to authoritatively respond on the site? The poster has
already accepted an answer claiming they can do it with ArcGIS...

thank you for your reply, werner.

but if you try to see raster in singleband pseudocolor, you can see that non
data is not transparent even if -99999 is properly indicated as "no data"
value.
as i have reported, to activate transparency i have to reclassify raster by
means of sextante-->saga-->reclassify grid values.
replace no data values = yes,
new value for no data values = -99999

at this point, the new raster has transparent no data

Hi,

actually #abcdef is 24 bits, but every color channel is 8 bits only
(0-255). The author mixes up a few concepts, because when you have
8-bit color channels you have an 24-bit palette. The author is trying
to refer to deep-color (30/36/48-bit) RGB colors which offer a wider
spectrum of colors.

My understanding of the code is that any interpolated colors are
created using integer values, which result in 8-bit colors channels
and a 24-bit palette, so the statements in that link are probably
correct.
However, raster shading calculation uses double precision for the
computation, but converts the result to integer before creating the
color. Vector interpolation uses integers exclusively.

I'm not sure if QColor supports 16-bit color channels, but offers a
means to store the color in 16-bit precision.

This could be improved in both cases,  by using QColor::getRgbF() and
QColor::setRgbF QColor::setRgbF - these use double values in the 0.0 -
1.0 range instead of 0 - 256 range.

However, I don`t have an actual example to illustrate the difference
in palette and I'm not sure it would make such a difference - but it
might in high-quality reprints.

According to [1] -   256 (32-bit) shades of red, green, and blue, for
a total of at least 16,777,216 color variations. The human eye is
capable of discriminating among as many as ten million colors to the
naked eye.

Hi Matthias

>In my opinion this is a bug in the current version and should be changed without option

It will be good to have an additional option to scale proportional to 
the area. But I think you should leave the option to scale the diameter. 
This was done on purpose, because the diagram size you specify is the 
radius, not the area (and this again is similar to the symbology system, 
where point symbol size is also diameter, not area). Btw, I have read 
that there might also be cases where you want to scale diagram sizes 
proportional to the volume (e.g. to display content of lakes, etc.).

Marco

Yes, I'm also in favor of the first approach. It is more intuitive to 
set the size of the diameter than the one of the area.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] crssync not building on winXP
Message-ID: <1344587268397-4994325.post@n6.nabble.com>

Latest from git.

I get an error related to crssync. Per Garys recommendation I unset
"ENABLE_TESTS", but as I promised Tim I try to write some new testcases, I
guess I have to get this working. :-)

Excerpt from build log (VC 2008, Win XP)

Any ideas?

Magnus

Solved. :-) Here's a fix for CMakeLists.txt, can someone please commit?

Hm - I have to disagree here. The general opinion in thematic mapping is that you shpulf scale proportional to the area and not the diameter/radius. After all, if the attribute value of a feazure is 4 times larger than the att value of another feature the area of the circle/pie chart should be 4 times as large and not 16 or 8 times as large. In my opinion the area proportional behavior should be the default and the current behavior optional.

Seems like J?rgen already fixed this recently

Ah! I thought I updated to latest src with "git checkout", but apparently
not. So how do I download it?

Hi Andreas

At the moment I plan to implement as follows:

Default: Scale area
              => The user can define: a value v for an attribute a that will generate a diagram of diameter d
                 A feature with v' = v/2 will generate a diagram with (d')^2 = (d)^2 / 2

Option: Scale diameter
              => where v' = v/2 will generate a diagram with d' = d/2


I think Marco was referring to my idea for the default version: to let the value v denote the area rather than the diameter. So d = sqrt(v/pi).

	Hm - I have to disagree here. The general opinion in thematic mapping is that you shpulf scale proportional to the area and not the diameter/radius. After all, if the attribute value of a feazure is 4 times larger than the att value of another feature the area of the circle/pie chart should be 4 times as large and not 16 or 8 times as large. In my opinion the area proportional behavior should be the default and the current behavior optional.

Heh, bad luck :)

Try:
git pull ( = git fetch + git checkout )

Hi Matthias

Yes, that was exactly what I meant (I was not questioning the 
usefullness of area proportional scaling).

Seems like Digia buys qt from Nokia. The bood news is that they plan to support Android, iOS and Windows mobile.

So finally some hope for Iphone/ipad users. ...

Looks like a good move.  Really happy to see support for the three
phone platforms coming.  I own a Window Phone 7 and would love to see
a QGIS port on that.

The iPad/iPhone thing could still be an issue due to the restrictions
placed on the App Store from Apple.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Messy field's Id handling with AttributeMap()and
 fieldmaps if oid/fid/geom fields
Message-ID: <1344601047548-4994389.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
developping EasyCustomLabeling plugin that duplicates layers into memory
layers, and also testing brand new duplicate plugin,* we found a very
cheating behaviour with field Id's and AttributeMap() / AddAttribute methods
of QgsFeature()*. 

I'll try to be as clear as possible:

*Qgis provider masks some fields types to user*, such as *oid, fid or
geometry* (if used as displayed geom). This is true for postgis. I guess
other spatial databases are concerned too. 

*What happens: *  
     - if good data admin practice,* oid and geometry fields are generally
stored as last fields *in table or views . (test_oid_geom_at_the_end.jpeg)
:* Everything goes fine*
     /   ex: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW dce.rwbody_ag_testoid_end AS  SELECT
rwbody.eu_cd, masse_eau.nom_masse_eau,  masse_eau.nature::character varying
AS nature, rwbody.region_cd, rwbody.system, rwbody.geoml93, rwbody.oid  FROM
rwbody; /

     - *If oid or fid or geom field are NOT last fields
(test_oid_third_geomend.jpeg )*
   /  ex: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW dce.rwbody_ag_testoid_end AS  SELECT
rwbody.eu_cd, masse_eau.nom_masse_eau, rwbody.oid  
masse_eau.nature::character varying AS nature, rwbody.region_cd,
rwbody.system, rwbody.geoml93 FROM rwbody; /  
Fields are masked but ids are just omitted. Just have a look to field id's
in layer properties to check this by yourself.
        When copying fields or attributes from that source table to a target
table will not copy attributes in the right columns . Id handling seems is
different between fetch attribute with attributeMap() and SetAttributes().. 
First one increment ids without oid / fid /geom fields, the other one
does... 

As a workaround, it is necessary to handle its own incremented id, *but,
this workaround is not possible when attributes are NULL, because
SourceFeature.attributeMap() only returns NOT empty attributes*.  Looping on
that attributeMap is quite tricky:

-- this code is mixing attributes: 
for SourceFeature in sourcelayer.selectedFeatures():
   Targetfeature = QgsFeature()   
   sourceAttrs = SourceFeature.attributeMap()
   Targetfeature.setAttributeMap(sourceAttrs)
   targetProvider.addFeatures( [ Targetfeature] )


-- this is a workaround :
for SourceFeature in sourcelayer.selectedFeatures():
   Targetfeature = QgsFeature()   
   sourceattrs = SourceFeature.attributeMap()
   idx = 0
   for k,v in sourceattrs .iteritems():
        Targetfeature .changeAttribute(idx, v)
        idx = idx + 1
   targetProvider.addFeatures( [ Targetfeature] )

*My question :


Is possible to correct attributeMap() and  setAttributeMap() methods so that
they both handle the same way ids, even if some are masked?  * This would be
really easier to handle, especially with growing number of users with
SpatialDB. 


Cheers, 
R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] DataCustomProperties store labeling field by their
 id's and not names
Message-ID: <1344601965625-4994392.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, (again)

DatacustomProperties for labelingfields ( New generation labeling ) are
stored as follow in qgs projects or qml style :

 <customproperties>
                <property key="labeling" value="pal"/>
                <property key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty0" value="27"/>
                <property key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty1" value="29"/>
                <property key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty10" value="24"/>
                <property key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty11" value="25"/>
                <property key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty12" value="26"/>
                <property key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty2" value="30"/>
                <property key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty3" value="33"/>
                <property key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty4" value="31"/>
                <property key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty5" value="28"/>
                <property key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty6" value="32"/>
                <property key="labeling/dataDefinedProperty9" value="23"/>
                <property key="labeling/enabled" value="true"/>
                <property key="labeling/fieldName" value="LblField"/>
                <property key="labeling/fontSize" value="8"/>
                <property key="labeling/multiLineLabels" value="true"/>
            </customproperties>

Everywhere else in QGIS projects are identified by their names, and that is
great because projects are much more stable this way. If a user (or a
program like GDAL and GML) changes fields order in data source, all custom
properties get mixed up, in a very 'Mapinfo'-like behaviour.   

Is it feasable to have custom properties identified by name  (for the
future) or id's (to make QGis compatible with old Qgs)? 
Is that a feature request I have to create? 

All the best
R?gis

Message-ID: <B68B018A586B1B47B7B19F161A7CEAEB589C45@SRV122.stadt-uster.ch>

If not, please get my branch and make some. There are a lot of improvements and changes (Listed further down this page).
It's probably not production stable but already works reasonably well.

And while you're already testing code: Its testing Friday!

NEW FEATURES:
*************

+ Minimum size for diagrams (As an option, scale any diagram smaller than...)
  * Status: Done

+ Text diagram: Center text better vertically (As an option)
  * Status: Done

+ Make diagrams area accurate! By now the radius instead of area is scaled.
  * Done for text diagrams and Pie charts

+ New diagram type: Bar chart
  * Done
  * Feedback needed: Do things like "Fixed size" and "Increase size of small diagrams" make sense here? Seems a bit uncontrollable to me.

/ Ordering: Draw smaller charts on top of bigger one instead of hiding colliding diagrams.
  * Done. (For now: Activate new labelling => Advanced => Engine settings: Enable "Show All")
  * Config option in diagrams to come...

STILL TODO:
***********

/ Charts are not placed on some polygons
  * Need confirmation that this is really a problem with Placment method "Free"

- New diagram option: Split diagrams. (Pie charts / Bar charts e.g. age pyramid)
  * Not yet...

- Redesign of diagram layer
  * Still crowded, tried to give only options that make sense in this context. Probably needs to be split up into some more dialogs.

- Number in pie segments indicating its value
  * ToDo

- Legend in map composer
  * ToDo

Regards and enjoy the weekend,
Matthias

Message-ID: <CADChDVMG3pCptVMPahCzsMLYkZzbRxcgiOYjEw5jhxDk2v+_5w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

As a Qgis user,I have always wished there were ways to efficiently view and
fix existing topological errors in data. As I researched a bit, there were
some developments going  around 3 years ago in this regard. I found a
source too in Martin Dobias' Github repository.

If nobody is currently working on it, I would be happy to support the
integration of this to Quantum GIS. I have done something similar in a
popular 2-D drafting application using NetTopologySuite(a c# port of Java
Topology Suite) as a hobby project. Since GEOS is also a port of JTS,
things might be comfortable. As I took a quick look at the code, it seems
to be very close to completion. Though I am not a hardcore C++ developer, I
am sure my C# experience would guide me to work on this.

best regards,
Vinayan

Hi Alexander, I added myself to the group and also added to the list a

That would be great Vinayan.
A very good topology toolset, based on JTS, is the zone provided by
OpenJUMP [1]. Int could be another source tor inspiration.

I'm afraid this is not possible at the moment.
Reason is that Openstreetmap have dropped their osmarender map a few months ago, forcing every user of the maps to remove that layer, or get an error that prevents the website from working properly.

The Qgis usermap has been updated, but not the add-yourself-map.

I mentioned it before on this mailing list, but the person responsible for the site is not reading this list
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Is anyone on the devel list privileged to change the add-user-map?
Or knows someone that does?

Greetings,
Andr? Joost

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Error using QGIS API (unresolved external
 symbol "public: static struct,
 QMetaObject const QgsVectorLayer::staticMetaObject") - usage of qobject_cast

Hi,

I traced this error to the use of qobject_cast in lines like:

QgsVectorLayer* vlayer = qobject_cast<QgsVectorLayer *>( 
mCanvas->currentLayer() );

If I change those lines to use dynamic_cast the linker error disappear 
in Windows.

Any idea why?

Many thanks,
Carlos.

Hi Nathan,

If you want to display OpenStreetMap data in Qgis, you can still use
directly Gdal as described here :

Hi,

I am using 1.8.0 but tests/src/core/testqgsrasterlayer.cpp is defined as:

void TestQgsRasterLayer::pseudoColor()
{
   mpRasterLayer->setDrawingStyle( QgsRasterLayer::SingleBandPseudoColor );
   mpRasterLayer->setColorShadingAlgorithm( 
QgsRasterLayer::PseudoColorShader );
   mpRasterLayer->setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm(
     QgsContrastEnhancement::StretchToMinimumMaximum, false );
   mpRasterLayer->setMinimumValue( mpRasterLayer->grayBandName(), 0.0, 
false );
   mpRasterLayer->setMaximumValue( mpRasterLayer->grayBandName(), 10.0 );
   mpMapRenderer->setExtent( mpRasterLayer->extent() );
   QVERIFY( render( "raster_pseudo" ) );
}

I cannot locate the code using ColorRampItem.

Many thanks,
Carlos.

Hi

sorry if I have misled you, the code I was quoting is in 1.9 (dev
version). Have a look at the code in 1.9, it should probably work with
1.8 but might require some changes.

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/tests/src/core/testqgsrasterlayer.cpp

//items to imitate old pseudo color renderer
  QList<QgsColorRampShader::ColorRampItem> colorRampItems;
  QgsColorRampShader::ColorRampItem firstItem;
  firstItem.value = 0.0;
  firstItem.color = QColor( "#0000ff" );
  colorRampItems.append( firstItem );
[...]
  colorRampShader->setColorRampItemList( colorRampItems );

I tried that but QgsSingleBandPseudoColorRenderer is a class that does 
not seem to exists in 1.8.0

Subject: [Qgis-developer] font size of QGIS
Message-ID: <502A1678.3000606@gmail.com>

Hi Marco, hi all

I am having trouble while trying to set font size of QGIS on a HTC phone.
As settings dialog is too big, I cannot access to this setting.
I created a file 
Android/data/org.qgis.qgis/files/Settings/QuantumGIS/QGIS.conf with
[General]
IconSize=32
fontPointSize=4

I restarted QGIS, but nothing changed. Also the file disappeared.

I tried this from your post 
http://www.opengis.ch/2012/03/30/qgis-on-android-phone/ , but I have no 
clue about adb.

Could you give me hint for this?

Thanks a lot for your job, it's really great!

Greetings,

Denis

Message-ID: <CAC2XbFesfD2v=6LZX4tZ81UbVB_rb+qWpraGSStrcFEzfrY4mQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am happy to announce that I have just merged Arun's work on
symbology. He has done a great job and after some testing I think the
code is ready for prime time.

What to expect?
- style manager has been greatly improved:
  - grouping of symbols (including child groups of groups)
  - tagging
  - "smart" groups (showing only symbols matching some criteria).
  - search
- symbol selector and properties dialogs have been integrated to just
one dialog, improving the usability a lot
- style database is now stored in a SQLite database rather than an XML
file for better scalability
- style import improvements: load style directly from given URL,
saving imported symbols into a group
- SVG fill: shows directories for easier traversal through the SVG directories
- surely some more goodies I've forgotten to mention!

Please note that with the transition of styles to SQLite database you
will find your style empty - but don't worry! You can import all your
saved symbols and color ramps from ~/.qgis/symbology-ng-style.xml -
from now they will be stored in ~/.qgis/symbology-ng-style.db.

Arun: thanks for your hard work and I hope you will continue to
contribute to QGIS! :-)
Also many thanks to Nathan for co-mentoring and lots of great ideas
for the GUI improvements that landed in the code.

Regards
Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] image boundary
Message-ID: <1344978404344-4995238.post@n6.nabble.com>

hi, i have almost 4700 ortophoto, not geotiff, but each one has its proper
tfw world file.
i'd like to generate correpsonding shape file of the boundary in order to
add an action able to open a single image.

first problem i have is to generate shape file. i read (and prove it) that
image boundary plugin works only with geotiff so it's very hard for me to
use the old geotiffexamine that works one by one image.

so, do you know if exists any other solution for having vector boundary of a
tiff in a very massive way?

Hi,

try-ing to compile the last version of qgis trunk,
The configure cmake phase report the missing of QTWEBKIT.

I guess there some regress on the configuration files because there is the
variable WITH_DESKTOP and WITH_BINDINGS set to OFF to avoid this error.
So this check should not be do.

No, that's outdated.  The composer now supports HTML and that requires WebKit.

Interesting question.
It would be good to add some performance tests to QGIS. Radim has done a
great job on this, and it could be expanded to data processing. Through
Sextante it is easy to build a model that compares the same analysis
through different backends. A method to store processing times could be
added.
All the best.

Hi Peter

Thanks for supplying your info and links, looks very interesting and relevant.

"What kind of quantitative measurements and performance metrics would you consider useful for GRASS GIS ?"
Basically measurements of volume and speed of processing certain image amounts;  
E.g. GRASS GIS loaded, processed (e.g. standard classification) and exported an 10 GB RapidEye image mosaic in XX minutes/hours. 
Ideally this flow should be compared with identical processed performed in closed source SW, as ENVI, Erdas, ArcGIS and other Open Source SW. 

I would also like to identify any bottlenecks/showstoppers with regards to data volume. 

I have seen something similar in the CASCADOSS project; 
http://www.cascadoss.eu/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=14
But not exactly what I wanted to showcase and use for documentation/justification of our setup. 

Kind regards,
Rasmus

Hello Rasmus,

regarding your question on GRASS-dev concerning quantitative measures for large and multiple raster processing in GRASS:

Previous work at RapidEye (http://www.rapideye.com/) involved large scale satellite image processing with GRASS, also using multiple scenes. 
Until now only bits of this has been published: 
http://2010.foss4g.org/presentations_show.php?id=3678
As my current work involves GRASS-based workflows on a HPC cluster, I would also be interested if the topic of quantitative measures would receive more attention.

What kind of quantitative measurements and performance metrics would you consider useful for GRASS GIS ?

Kind regards,
Peter

If you have a lot of symbols with sub-symbols, you will find them broken
into two separate symbols, I would recommend using the
scripts/symbol_xml2db.py  to convert the XML to the DB and use that Sqlite
DB.

This is not a good news for me.

RedHat don't support QTWebKit.

I can try to compile it from scratch but I try it some time ago and the
dependencies was many and I was unable to resolve all of them.

There is some available info on how compile the QTWebKit on RH ?

Thx,

Hi,
I need to try to install compiling QTWebKit
And because I must try to compile it from source with all dependendencies.

I need ot know what is the lesser version of QTWebKit needed for full
support of the last qgis-server version

Thx,

Message-ID: <CAC2XbFdFeY1+zW36VkU+anVZMfvOyN4Ax=daf+UwwdcXHe5Gyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs

right now our minimal required Qt version is 4.4 which is now more
than four years old. The merge of Arun's GSoC code breaks
compatibility with Qt < 4.7. The issue can be fixed easily, though it
made me wonder whether it is not a good time to raise the minimal Qt
version for QGIS to at least Qt 4.7 which has been released about two
years ago. This would also enable us to use more recent additions like
animation and state machine frameworks or Qt Quick.

Thoughts?

Martin

Hi,
I'm try-ing to install the QTWebKit on my RedHat.

But the cmake of qgis still report me it is unavailable.

Perhaps there is a different folder path.

Any hint on where is searched for the QTWebKit and how it is possible to
change se searched path on cmake ?

Hi Andrea,

I had a similar problem two days ago, because I tried to compile QGIS
"WITH_DESKTOP NO" (just needed QGIS mapserver and Python Bindings).
ccmake was succesfull but build failed. may be this info is helpful. jef
should have fixed this issue in master (did not try if his fix works)

Latest Debian stable 6.0.5 released May 12th, 2012 has Qt 4.6.3, so
-1 for me. Four years is nothing in the world of Open Source.

Hi Marco,

thx greatly for hint.
Unfortunately my problem is opposite to your.

I'm having a QTWEBKIT NOT found on configuring phase.
So the cmake don't generate the files need for compilation.

I guess the cmake search the qwebkit on a different path from where it is
installed.
I think to have a qtwebkit installed on a 4.6 version.

Or perhaps is missing some sub-module of qtwebkit.
I don't know.

Andrea.

Hi Andrea,

did you install only qtwebkit or also the -dev packages needed for 
compiling (don't know about RedHat, but at Ubuntu/Debian they are 
called libqtwebkit-dev or included in libqt4-dev)

Hi Marco,

Thx again for support.

Yes, I install the qt (don't qt4)

and don't have any libqt4-dev

Unfortunately redhat don't give a clear support to QT4.
It allow only this packages:

PyQt4.i686 : Python bindings for Qt4
PyQt4.x86_64 : Python bindings for Qt4
PyQt4-devel.i686 : Files needed to build other bindings based on Qt4
PyQt4-devel.x86_64 : Files needed to build other bindings based on Qt4
avahi-qt4.i686 : Qt4 libraries for avahi
avahi-qt4.x86_64 : Qt4 libraries for avahi
avahi-qt4-devel.i686 : Libraries and header files for avahi Qt4 development
avahi-qt4-devel.x86_64 : Libraries and header files for avahi Qt4
development
pinentry-qt4.x86_64 : Passphrase/PIN entry dialog based on Qt4
poppler-qt4.i686 : Qt4 wrapper for poppler
poppler-qt4.x86_64 : Qt4 wrapper for poppler
poppler-qt4-devel.i686 : Development files for Qt4 wrapper
poppler-qt4-devel.x86_64 : Development files for Qt4 wrapper

I don't know what of this (if any) is the right for qgis.

Andrea.

Maybe your cmake doesn't know about webkit?  Not sure, if that was introduced
later...

I guess no.
I tried to re-download newly all the qgis-dev sources.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python plug-in development question
Message-ID: <92315C1D-EDF4-4E48-BE30-E981A2033769@live.ucl.ac.uk>

(I hope this forum is OK for questions regarding Python plug-in development, if not, please direct me to the appropriate place).

I am trying to draw simple boxes in a vector layer, labelled according to a user selection. I would like to set the colour of the boxes I draw in Python, but I can't find the correct way to do this via the API docs (i.e. is it a layer property, a feature property, something else ?). 
If someone could point me to the right documentation, that would help.

Also, I looked at using QgsFillSymbolLayer, but I am stuck on understanding how to get the RenderContext for this (working from the example in the PyQGIS documentation - is there a fuller example I can look at ? (I've not found one yet).

Thanks.

Gill Thornhill.

Let me join you for congratulations!

Arun, it's great to see that your work has been already merged and that
you are willing to continue development after GSoC. That is the
ultimate goal for the program, and I look forward for other students to
follow your path.

All the best,
Anne

I think Qt 4.4 is just a theoretical minimal version. Last time when I
was trying to compile QGIS on Debian Lenny (oldstable) there where some
issues. Another example is the latest patch for map canvas flickering
which I found segfaulting on Qt < 4.7. There is clearly no man power to
solve such compatibility issues. I think Debian Wheezy will be out
before QGIS 2.0, Ubuntu LTS already has Qt 4.7. +1 for moving to minimal
Qt to 4.7.

 Thank you Arun - It is much better that we can now use fewer dialogues. 
 I am working with it now and will reports bug if I come across them.

 Good work!

J?rgen,

I'd just like to understand your recent reversions to my cmake changes from many months ago that were verified to work on all platforms at the time.

PUBLIC_HEADER is supposed to install headers without the need for a separate INSTALL command.

Platform-specific target properties are meaningless and should be ignored on other platforms, so there is no neeed to wrap them in an IF() block for the platform.

My brain is forgetting things.  OS X properties is adding the "Copying OS X content" messages, even though there is no OS X content on other platforms.

What about the PUBLIC_HEADER?

That's the point.  PUBLIC_HEADER also does that.

OK, it's been a while since I looked at the cmake docs, when I did the cmake cleanup way back when.  PUBLIC_HEADER is sort-of a platform-specific property for OS X frameworks, and probably appears as Copying OS X content on other platforms.

Still, maybe this is a cmake cosmetic bug that we shouldn't be working around?

By the way I noticed a small regression in that you cant set symbol

New features!
Testers are still very welcome. It's already in a really good and usable shape :-)

+ Cleanup of diagram tab
  * The diagram tab looks really different ( I hope better... )
  * As lot of context sensitive showing/hiding and enabling/disabling
  * Put options into tabs

+ Some tooltips in the diagram tab

+ Warning if the user tries to display a diagram without having assigned any attribute

+ Code cleanup
  * Put diagram gui stuff into an own file (it's still rather big this way)

+ Style => Single symbol, Graduated symbol, Categorized symbol
  * The scale method can also be scaled by area / diameter now
  * Untested: Does it also work for symbols or only for circles?

+ Transparency for diagrams

+ "Show all" option
  * It's hidden in the position tab under "PAL engine settings"
  * This is a project-wide option as far as I can see
  * If show all is enabled, smaller objects are rendered on top of bigger ones

Have fun and let me know what you think

There was some recent discussion on this topic on irc [0]. The short
story on the research:

* Centos/RHEL 5 was found to have the oldest stock version @ 4.5.2 if
using the ELGIS Repository 5 [1].
* There is a third party rpm for updating those distros to Qt 4.7 [2],
though that approach may break support agreements for some enterprise
users.

The benefits for a minimum of 4.6 or 4.7 [3], given what those
versions offer for the program and developers, IMHO is worth requiring
some users (a somewhat small percentage maybe?) to upgrade their
supporting packages.

I think 4.7 should be the minimum as well, though some users may be
stuck with 4.6. Supporting as far back as 4.5 may be hold development
back, especially during new GUI enhancements.

As a side note, I recently noticed an incompatibility issue when using
QtDesigner/QtCreator and laying out forms under Qt version 4.8. The
use of item-based alignment [4] does not compile using uic with any
version < 4.8, and its use should probably be avoided. The alignment
can still be set programmatically later, however.

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR9ux9LvXh5RfcaeUWuLFJNM=hR4n-M17tgGypapge+8AA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is a request for Robert, but some input from others would help out.

Peppered throughout the GUI are buttons with only '...' for opening
the expression editor. A button with only '...' is a bit vague. It
would be nice to have a specific icon for the expression editor to add
to buttons and the ui, where needed.

Any ideas for what it should look like, or characters it should be
based on, like maybe:  ('exp')  ?

Regards,

Larry

Hi Martin,
thanks for raising the issue. I think the situation is different for the
server and for the client: it is quite acceptable to me that a desktop
app with a very fast pace of development requires recent libs. For the
server, it is preferable to have less stringent requirements, as it will
be more likely to have people that need to install it on older or less
supported distro (see e.g. the recent case with RH).
All the best.

Hi Marco,

thx greatly for hint.
Unfortunately my problem is opposite to your.

I'm having a QTWEBKIT NOT found on configuring phase.
So the cmake don't generate the files need for compilation.

I guess the cmake search the qwebkit on a different path from where it is
installed.
I think to have a qtwebkit installed on a 4.6 version.

Or perhaps is missing some sub-module of qtwebkit.
I don't know.

Andrea.

Hi Andrea,

did you install only qtwebkit or also the -dev packages needed for 
compiling (don't know about RedHat, but at Ubuntu/Debian they are 
called libqtwebkit-dev or included in libqt4-dev)

Hi Marco,

Thx again for support.

Yes, I install the qt (don't qt4)

and don't have any libqt4-dev

Unfortunately redhat don't give a clear support to QT4.
It allow only this packages:

PyQt4.i686 : Python bindings for Qt4
PyQt4.x86_64 : Python bindings for Qt4
PyQt4-devel.i686 : Files needed to build other bindings based on Qt4
PyQt4-devel.x86_64 : Files needed to build other bindings based on Qt4
avahi-qt4.i686 : Qt4 libraries for avahi
avahi-qt4.x86_64 : Qt4 libraries for avahi
avahi-qt4-devel.i686 : Libraries and header files for avahi Qt4 development
avahi-qt4-devel.x86_64 : Libraries and header files for avahi Qt4
development
pinentry-qt4.x86_64 : Passphrase/PIN entry dialog based on Qt4
poppler-qt4.i686 : Qt4 wrapper for poppler
poppler-qt4.x86_64 : Qt4 wrapper for poppler
poppler-qt4-devel.i686 : Development files for Qt4 wrapper
poppler-qt4-devel.x86_64 : Development files for Qt4 wrapper

I don't know what of this (if any) is the right for qgis.

Andrea.

Maybe your cmake doesn't know about webkit?? Not sure, if that was introduced
later...

Did you read the instruction Building QGIS from source - step by step?

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/INSTALL

What is the problem? What is the error messages?

Tim, yes, I too noticed it. I think I would work on the Symbol Levels
dialog to accommodate that soon.

Martin, I have a few things in mind which we could fix by chipping away bit
by bit,

1. SIP Bindings: During developement, I ran into SIP binding breakages a
number of times when compiling, but just deleted problematic functions to
solve the compile issue. I think they need to be reworked. I have no prior
experience in SIP, and have started reading about it. Any guidelines in
this matter is welcome. This should be done first I think.

2. Automated tests: This you have mentioned to me already, and I think, we
should get into that. This again a new area for me, but shouldn't take much
time.

3. Old issues: Anything under the sun with respect to Symbology on the bug
tracker.

Any suggestions on how we could go on with the above is welcome.

ok,
perhaps I found the hot-point.

I installed a qtwebkit.
RedHat say me that it call the package qt-devel.
So Ok, I installed it .

But still qgis cmake say me that QTWEBKIT is missing.
Instead the reality is that is missing "only" the package listed below.

BUt that package are not necessary for qgis-server.
So perhaps should better the exclude they from a qgis-server only installation.
Is this possible ?
Should I open a ticket ?

Thx,

Hi Arun,

This would be great.

Fixing first the issues listed here

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Switching_from_Old_to_New_Symbology_and_Labeling

would allow to drop the old symbology sooner than later.

Maybe it's just this.  Try pointing it manually to the directory where
your qwebview.h is.  The others shouldn't be necessary anyway.

I see there isn't any file named qwebview.h

The RedHat say me that the qt-devel they give on their repository is
formerly the
qtwebkit.
But in effect the qwebview.h is not available in any folder.

So I try to ask to RedHat support about this qwebview.h file.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] scale dependent visibility and fixed scales
Message-ID: <502CDF62.2010400@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi all, today I was plaing around with some swiss maps (LK25 and LK50) I
wanted to have LK50 (national map 1:50000) visible only from scale
1:50000 and if it is zoomed in then I want to see LK25.

So I set the maps to be scale dependent visible as here:
LK25 min:0 Max 50000
LK50 min: 50000 Max 1000000000

the concept works but there is a detail (matter of changing a < to <= or
so) that I think it is not super intuitive.
If I select the fixed scale of 1:50000 then onlx LK25 is shown. I would
expect either both or only LK50 to be visible.
what do think?

ciao

Hi Martin, Arun and others

I think this is great!  My work on cpt-city color ramps is still
evolving, and I was wondering in which ways it could benefit from your
work.

As far as I see it, here is how ramps would work:

1) an interface to browse a number of available gradients and import
them into user's gradients.

The entire cpt-city archive holds about 6000 gradients. I have
prepared a reduced set (about 800) that we could provide optionally
for qgis users, based on licenses and a broad selection (the one from
cpt-city). The goal is to have a minimal set (about 100) that would be
distributed with qgis.

The current interface to browse these gradients needs an overhaul, and
I was thinking of adopting a layout similar to the one you adopted for
the style manager: a tree to the left with various ways to organize
the gradients, a search feature, and a box to the right with the
matching ramps. Because there are a number of ramps available, it
might not fit well inside the style manager because it would add
clutter. On the other hand, it could be useful to have it integrated
directly, with a specific category in the tree and perhaps a specific
tab page for the matching ramps. My preference is to use a dedicated
dialog for this, very similar to the style manager, but I would
appreciate feedback and of course a thumbs up/down to reuse your work.

2) once ramps are chosen they reside in the color ramps tab like other ramps.

3) import/export:  cpt-city ramps are stored in standard svg
"linearGradient" format. It would be nice to be able to import/export
these from the style manager, and perhaps change the internal xml
representation of color ramps to that format - or at least export in
svg linearGradient.

cheers,
Etienne

Message-ID: <B3D6B687-8647-43C6-BE6A-6205DCDD13CB@archtech.gr>

Hello all,

I have been trying to build a qgis C++ plugin with no success? in different test platforms too (including building qgis from source).

I started by doing the simple steps in the QGIS Compile/Style document for 1.6.0 (i think) and using as a QGIS_DIR path all possible combination and hacks? Qgis App dir, Qgis source dir from github(without building it, a hybrid folder with Qgis source and "lib" folder from the App dir to cheat without building.
But I had no success.

(python is a no-go!)

I end up getting this: (of course with the 'hacked' lib folder)

Any ideas? Links to read? Maybe use an older ubuntu version?

Maybe I have taken a wrong turn somewhere and I keep doing the same mistake?

Message-ID: <CAFcOn28tm_t_k4SwsQBo2f8_P40bGRSwSrigWe6SCjrc93LLDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to program and configure QGIS as a real specialist GIS for
end users using Windows with menus, settings and plugins adapted to a
specialists task - and failed until now. But perhaps I'm missing some
concepts or tricks. Is this possible?

Possible solution: I think if this would work under Windows I'd be happy:

% C:\OSGeo4W\bin\qgis.bat --configpath "C:\gisdata\conf" --project
"C:\gisdata\test_projekt.qgs"

This would allow to start at least one instance with a specific config
("--configpath": pointing to menus, buttons, settings...) and a
specific set of plugins ("" pointing to a project file in a
subdirectory). But "--configpath" does not seem to be implemented, at
least not in Windows - although there's an entry in the docs
http://docs.qgis.org/user_guide/html/en/introduction/features_at_a_glance.html
.

It can even be that specialists end users start QGIS twice, one
instance for managing task A (like e.g. surveying) and one for task B
(like environmental planning). But I'm aware that this seems
impossible by concept because QGIS/Qt store settings in the (singular)
Windows Registry.

Under Windows we now store an .ini (test_projekt.ini) file, start QGIS
with the above parameters (except void --configpath), load the
test_projekt.ini, exit QGIS (!??) and start QGIS again...

Any help?

Yours, S.

For OS X, if you want cmake to find your Homebrew libraries instead of the standard frameworks, you need to add to your cmake command:

-D CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK=LAST

BUT, there is a bug in cmake currently that this setting is completely ignored.  You will have to either apply the patch mentioned in the bug report to your cmake source and recompile cmake, or install cmake from dev sources.

http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=13261

Also, for building external plugins for QGIS on OS X, QGIS libs are frameworks, so you can't link your plugin with the -l flags, that's why you're getting linking errors.  But the QGIS frameworks bundled in the app aren't suitable for linking, so you need to tell cmake to install dev frameworks with:

-D QGIS_MACAPP_INSTALL_DEV=TRUE

These will install in /Library/Frameworks, so all you need to do for your plugin is link with:

-framework qgis_core -framework qgis_gui

You don't need '-L//Users/varoudis/Desktop/Projects/Quantum-GIS/lib' (assuming you extracted them from the app to there).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Aruns work: hierarchical SVG symbol display issue
Message-ID: <4aa277fff832eb4c969b7b405733dc3c@carto.net>

 Hi Arun, Martin and others,

 With delight I see that there is now a hierarchic organization of SVG 
 symbols. Thank you very much - a long term request of mine was now 
 implemented!

 The only issue I have with the current solution is that it takes a long 
 time (in my case about 10 seconds) to load all the symbols (hundreds of 
 them in my case). Wouldn't it be faster to only load the first folder or 
 even better no symbols at all until the user is opening/clicking on one 
 of the folders?

 The other question is: are those symbols cached, once they are loaded? 
 I don't see any speed increases the second time I load these SVG 
 symbols.

 Thanks for the discussion if the loading time of the SVG symbols could 
 be sped up somehow.

 Andreas

Hi all

I totally agree scale limits should be included. I usually need to set
51000 or 49999 so that exact 50k is taken into account for respective max /
min scales.
Including the bounds will be more logic in my opinion.

Cheers

tell cake during QGIS building from source? so building the source is my only way in order to build a plugin?! right?

Hi all,

I just modified the wiki page and replaced the absolute links (
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/issue_number ) by redmine syntax for links to
issues ( #issue_number ).

This way we will be able to see wich issues are closed.

Hi Marco,

Thanks for the tip.

Doing so, I could just access the box and change the value with keyboard !

Thanks a lot!

Hm, if PUBLIC_HEADER is actually OSX specific, we shouldn't depend on it to
install the headers on other platforms.  If that gets fixed in cmake, we might
loose the header installation, instead of just the "OS X" in the message.

Hi

The test that fails is testSaveLoad(). After merge of Arun's work,
test script was not updated for changes to saving and loading of
symbols.

I wrote that test file. To make sure it doesn't mess with user's
settings, and also to make sure tests are independent of user's
settings I setup a "test" environment $HOME/.qgis_test and
QGIS_TEST.conf.

IMHO I think it would be wise to do that for other tests.

I thought that's what you were doing anyways?  But yes, I don't package the dev frameworks with my QGIS installer, so you need to compile QGIS to get them.

It *may* work if you copy the frameworks out of the QGIS app to /Library/Frameworks.  The main problem I found is some versions of the Xcode tools may fail to link those because of the relative paths embedded in them.

Do you mean upper case sigma Tim [1]?
We have it already, but probably it's too strongly related to 'sum' or 
'statistics'.
What about
- lowercase epsilon [2],
- f()
- integral sign? which in fact is sort of sum :), but looks more 
"scientific"

According to some design rules, one should avoid using letters where 
possible.

I concur. Do you mean like this:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4058089/qgis/scale-boundaries-included_patch.diff

Those were the first two I could find, there are probably others.

I believe this is how the PAL labeling engine [0] already handles
this, and it's how my recent data defined scale-visibility for labels
works [1].

On second look, QgsRuleBasedRendererV2::Rule::isScaleOK looks like
it's already including the boundaries. (removed it from the diff)

Yes agreed - though I wonder if mathematical symbols are used
universally across locales?

Any tips for which is the easiest platform to develop? Linux distro version or other? compiling QGIS from scratch on my mac and ubuntu 12.04 is a problem.

Best,
Tasos

PS: I have done the cmake(bug fix) trick but no-go.

I do:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
sudo apt-get build-dep qgis
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
git clone git://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git
cd Quantum-GIS
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..
make


hope it helps ciao

Ubuntu build went OK! Thanks!

Now taking the example from the QgisCoding document. I get this error:

qgspointconverterplugin.o: In function `QgsPointConverterPluginT::QgsPointConverterPluginT(QgisInterface*)':
qgspointconverterplugin.cpp:(.text+0xd0): multiple definition of `QgsPointConverterPluginT::QgsPointConverterPluginT(QgisInterface*)'
qgspointconverterplugin.o:qgspointconverterplugin.cpp:(.text+0xd0): first defined here
qgspointconverterplugin.o: In function `non-virtual thunk to QgsPointConverterPluginT::~QgsPointConverterPluginT()':
qgspointconverterplugin.cpp:(.text+0x440): multiple definition of `non-virtual thunk to QgsPointConverterPluginT::~QgsPointConverterPluginT()'
qgspointconverterplugin.o:qgspointconverterplugin.cpp:(.text+0x440): first defined here

a lot of them?.

Ideas?

Best,
Tasos

Hi,

Larry, you are right, I just tested Qgis 1.8 with one of my projects, and
indeed now Qgis displays the layer between the two bounds *included*.
I missed that !

Thanks to the dev who corrected the old behaviour.

I just sent a pull request by adding some simple test for
MultiGeometries[1]!
I hope to do something other more for test Friday!

Is there a web page presenting the "Test Friday" idea ?
It's an excellent campaign, ready to spread :)

Well, I didn't really write any tests today. However, I did work on a
couple of problems when running tests on Mac [0]. Now all the tests
appear to be working as expected (regardless of whether they pass or
fail), except the PyQGIS ones.

This fixed a failure for any call to qgscoordinatereferencesystem.cpp
that used the srs.db, which couldn't be found. I wonder why those
didn't show as a failed test?

I have one remaining test issue on Mac. I was able to override
QGIS_DATA_SUBDIR for the CMake tests (see tests/CMakeLists.txt edit),
but couldn't find a way to do it for the PyQGIS tests.

How can QGIS_DATA_SUBDIR be overridden for PyQGIS tests? I tried
putting the code that works for CMake tests in the following files, to
no avail:

tests/src/python/CMakeLists.txt
cmake/UsePythonTest.cmake

Someone disabled this test, but this needs to be fixed.

This is due to color ramps not being saved by the new style manager
(both in app and in tests).
They appear in the style manager after creation, but are not loaded
when qgis is restarted. Other symbols are saved fine.

Martin, can you please fix this?

Thanks,
Etienne

Thanks Etienne - I agree it is better to leave broken tests rather
than disable them as they indicate something isnt working as it
should.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Resolved - What path for QTWebKit - More info on
Message-ID: <CABqTJk-xuTR4161ecnfSU18Ysh6pqUfCSL=UeoDWRc9erAcBxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I resolve (hope) definitively the qtwebkit on RedHat. :)

The RedHat support help me to find and install the right packege.

I report how to help someone else with RedHat Enterprise 6.

Fist of all don't use directly the qt-devel available in the main redhat
repository.
It don't install all the needed files.

Instead
reading the help to this url:
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F

go to this url
http://ftp.heanet.ie/pub/fedora/epel/6/x86_64/repoview/epel-release.html
and use the URL given from
epel-release-6-7.noarch<http://ftp.heanet.ie/pub/fedora/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-7.noarch.rpm>

actually it is:
http://ftp.heanet.ie/pub/fedora/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-7.noarch.rpm

And using it:
run this commend to add the epel repository (the right for qtwebkit)

rpm -Uvh
http://ftp.heanet.ie/pub/fedora/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-7.noarch.rpm


After this
is possible to run

yum search qtwebkit

and the search will return this list:

qtwebkit-devel.i686 : Development files for qtwebkit
qtwebkit-devel.x86_64 : Development files for qtwebkit
qtwebkit.i686 : Qt WebKit bindings
qtwebkit.x86_64 : Qt WebKit bindings

To support the compile for qgis is necessary install 2 packages:

yum install qtwebkit.x86_64 qtwebkit-devel.x86_64

It install the QTWEBKIT 4.6.2 version.

After this add I was able to compile completelly qgis.

To have a QGIS-server only version (on a server is better avoid the
overhead of desktop packages)
Set

with_bindings OFF
with_desktop OFF
with_mapserver ON

Regards,

I don't see a point in testing stuff, we know will fail.  

But when disabling the test, I also added a comment to the TODO in core, where
the offending code is, saying the test should be re-enabled once the problem is
resolved.

As this seems to be work in progress anyway, I didn't bother to file a
ticket...

I'd opt for not re-enabling the test before core is fixed.

In that case - what is the point of testing stuff?

That is why you have "expected_fail" tests in qt, although this if for
bugs that will remain for some time.

The error is actually a regression caused by the improvements and
changes to the style manager (not improvements to color ramps per say)
- existing color ramps cannot be saved/loaded any more.

The point of doing tests is to flag any regressions and make them
visible (at least that's how I see it).

sorry I don't agree - errors should appear until they are fixed. If
you remove them the day they are flagged, they can get forgotten.

Hi, I would like to ask, what do You think about changing 'tile scale'
widget to horizontal layout. I found it more useful. 

Screenshots here: [1], [2]

Should I place pull request ?

Another option: get rid of if completely and synchronise the scale
intervals in the status bar to the tile intervals.

I was thinking about it too. But you will finish with not rounded
strange scale numbers like 1666, 3332, 6664 ... because they depend on
tile cache resolutions and your map canvas size ... In this case I would
prefer nice scale intervals widget and additional horizontal tile scale
slider.

Yeah I see your point. And yet another option may be to add a simple
toggle button (similar to the one next to the x,y pos in status bar
that toggles to extents) that toggles the scale combo to a slider.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GDAL linking error when compiling QGIS master on
 Windows using osgeo4w libs
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=wzfb8FVRDEouMJ3B_gYmGCAKh3EAtMf34eKMrLapA8gQ@mail.gmail.com>

Since the last osgeo4w libs update qgis_core doesn't compile because of
linking errors with gdal_i.lib (CPL methods).
I had those errors when I in the past I set the wrong gdal libs (older
versions) in the VC lib paths. Now the path points
to C:\OSGeo4W\lib\gdal_i.lib (as I did many times before) which is the
latest installed by osgeo4w.
Are there changes in the osgeo4w packaging, or am I missing something?

thanks,
giovanni

This one seems better, but it is out of my C++ skills.

Hi,

My problem below seems to partially covered by this open ticket
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5894 .
This ticket says " QSettings always read default, regardless of
--optionspath" and mentions ~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS.conf being the
default.
Now my intention is to configure a path as well as GUI elements when
starting QGIS - and getting this to work under Lunix and Windows.
Currently under Windows Defaults are stored in central Windows Registry!

To me the best solution would be,
1. that optionspath Parameter (if given and existing) really overrides
the defaults (like Ticket says),
2. and if QSettings under Windows would be stored not in Registry but
in an application path (like Linux).

Yours, Stefan

Why not use the customisation framework? See:

Hi Tim

I'd like to give end users the possibility to start one or more
specialised QGIS applications containing a simplified GUI and
different sets of plugins (Linux and Windows).

I think you are referring to "Customization Dialog" which can store a
certain config as an .ini file. Since --optionspath is being ignored
this means, that users start QGIS and have to load the corresponding
.ini file "by hand" - which is error-prone and cumbersome (users e.g.
won't remember what file to choose).

In addition, under Windows, they have to start QGIS, load the
(hopefully) corresponding .ini file - and have to restart QGIS again.

Or do I miss something?

Stefan

For me the best solution is Tim's second advice to add toggle button to
scale combo.

Hi,

Tim's for sure.

Hi all,

I've pushed the code on the branch project_macros on my
QGis fork [1].

The macros python code is loaded into a dummy module,
in this manner it can be unloaded when needed.

It seems conversion to XML doesn't break anything.

I developed a QgsMessageBar class to display information
to the user using a non-blocking widget.

The bar allows to push more messages as in a queue, then
displays them one by one beside to a close button.
The button remove the current message or the bar when the
message queue is empty.

The QgisApp instance creates a object of that class and
puts it above the canvas and also on the top of it (so the canvas
is not refreshed when the bar is shown or hidden as no resize
event occurs).

Please, could you test it and report here?

Regards.

Giuseppe,

I really like where this is going.

Couple of things:
 - There seems to be a margin around the map canvas now. That wasn't
there before.
 - If there are no marcos in the project file I wouldn't show the warning bar.
 - Might be good to have a "more info" hyperlink so that people can
understand what it really means
 - Would be nice if we can to have a Enable Always button with a drop
down menu with "Always for all projects" and "Always for just this
project" (don't have it popup a dialog asking if they are sure just
save it they can always change it after)
 - Might need to make the icon have a transparent icon background :)

Other then that I really love it.  Having the message bar opens up a
lot of other possibilities for use to notify the users of things that
may or may not need attention. I'm thinking things like "BTW 3 plugins
didn't load right.  Do you want to know which ones?"

- Nathan

ok, I see it now :)

When the checkbox is unchecked it doesn't show the warning bar,
I'll also check if the textbox is empty.

A link to the help page, sure it's a good thing.

Even if I don't like the enable always option as it might cause
security issues, I thought to put just one checkbox in the setting
dialog to make macros always enabled.

I don't imagine how to make the "always enable macros
for just this project" option working.
Projects don't have a identifier like layers and I guess the path is
not a good choice because the project file could be replaced
and the user could easily be wrong.

What do you think?

The icon is the one used for the message logger (displayed
bottom-right when in Debug mode), of course that white
background has to be removed. We also need a icon for
the close button (x) and icons for the other 2 levels of
messages, i.e. critical and information.

Opinions are welcome!
Regards.

hmmm doesn't seem to work for me. I just created a new project without
ticking the marco checkbox and when I open it I get the warning.

Yeah I think it can be a security issue also however there are some
things that reduce it:

 - The project file is plain text so you can also check ones that you download
 - In places like where I work we tend to only use internal project
files so it's fine to have it always enabled
 - IMO the chance of someone doing something bad with them is small I think
 - Word and Excel store everything in binary and hence have a always
on option is a huge risk as there is no other way to check the code.

I agree however I think the risk of a swap is low of a swap IMO.

I quite like the lack of a icon on the close button. It draws your
attention to the right which is where the user should look.

There are some nice icons here
http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=warning I use them in a lot of my
projects (just check licence)

I'm also thinking that I might be good to have a light yellow bar for
warnings, light red for error, and light blue for information.  Pick
the main colour of the icon and change it enough so the icon and bar
stand out.  Like this
http://www.lawgic.com/Res/System/Word2010.bar.gif

I think people will be very happy with addition.

The bar is already red for critical messages, orange-yellow for warnings
and light blue for informations :)
Have a look at the QgsMessageBar::pushWidget() method [1].

BTW, if you tell me the new hex of filling and border colors
I'll change them.

Cheers.

True, my bad :)

In that case I would reduce the level of the mInfoBar->pushWidget(
mMacrosWarn, 2 ); to 1 as it really should be yellow.

When more than 6k gradients are available, it should be much faster to 
create a new gradient rather then to find an appropriate one.

OK, I will race you.  You start making a topographic gradient, I start by

Hi Folks

Work conditions here at QGIS central must be really great because we
have just welcomed another developer to the QGIS Core developer team
(i.e. those with commit rights to the master repository). Despite us
halving pay and doubling the length of our shifts, new recruits keep
joining!*

Victor will be bringing the SEXTANTE plugin into the core of QGIS so
that it ships by default and has maximum exposure. Victor, we are
extremely pleased to have you join our team!

Regards

* This is a joke - QGIS core team are not paid by the QGIS project or
expected to work shifts!

That's fantastic news. There's been some fantastic work in the SEXTANTE svn
over the last few weeks so it will be great to see some of this in QGIS
core (e.g. the fTools and SEXTANTE native algorithms can now write to
memory layers in the latest development version) :-)

Really nice addition. I have a couple of suggestions.

Whether the warning appears seems to be keyed off of the recent opened
files listing. Since that evetually will cause the user to see the warning
again (once their project is removed from that listing), would it be better
to keep a listing of projects (at least by file name, not path) in the app
settings that have been allowed to run macros? Possibly in addition to the
recently opened check?

For a cleaner look for the message bar, I created two svg icons output to
png, one for the warning and one for close [0]. Also, the Enable action is
more of a link. Basically, removing the tool button backgrounds via a
stylesheet and having the cursor change as expected for web page links
allows for the focus of the bar to be the message, not the button actions.

Opinions are welcome!


The order of QgsMessageBar instance being created comes before the theme
(soon to be deprecated anyway?) is set.

The changes I have suggested are available as an addition to your branch
uploaded to my github repository [1].

Hello everyone,

is there already a function/api to import a set of coordinates to QGIS 
which then will render/show the map-area around these coordinates 
automatically?
If not - is there a way to realize such a function?


Cheers,

For one approach.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Large raster (ecw) identify very long
Message-ID: <1345628438183-4996953.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
I'm ready to support developpement now, so let's undig a topic discussed
previously here: 
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4594 http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4594 

Identify for very large ecw (from 1 to 100 Go - 1 080 000 * 1 090 000
pixels) is extremely long (more than 1min) and results to memory leak.  Very
often, this only gives a useless RGB info because ecw are orthophotos or
topographic scans. 

This is a problem if identify mode queries all layers under mouse clic. 

1 - Memory leak can be solved by disabling Gdal cache for ecw says Nathan.*
Do you confirm ? Can you give more details so that I write a contract for
it? *

2 - *I would also like to add a behaviour to handle very long response time,
I would really like to have your feedback on it:*
     - Option 1 : Disable identify for very large raster layers in project
properties when raster is loaded. Keep QGS properties if raster is loaded
when opening a project file. Should we add options to configure that in
general options (" Disable very large raster identify " + "raster size
threshold")
     - Option 2 : Offer a checkbox in identify mode options  that could be
named "disable raster identify" 
     - Option 3 : Considering it's a very particular problem for huge ecw
users and let's make a plugin that deactivates identify for big raster.   I
must say I don't vote for here because most french public user I know are
using big ecw, and I think it might be harder and more expensive to do this
from python.. (and adds a python plugin to load, adds a thing more to handle
on enterprise config.. ) 

*I vote for Option 1*

Thoughts guys? 

(And welcome to Victor by the way, congratulations!)

QGIS is using GDALRasterIO() which reads a single pixel on original
resolution. AFAIK, ECW is using tiles internally so it should be all
very fast. I can imagine 2 problems:

- the tiles in ECW file are too big - can you verify somehow how big
are the tiles?

- GDAL is reading bigger portion of data than necessary (cc to GDAL list)

Is it drawing of the raster also so slow (on raster resolution zoom)?

Hi Radim, I'm not ecw specialist, but I understand it is a wavelet
compression algorithm, not  a tiled one. 
There is one big image with pyramids inside.

No everything is fine when drawing data, whatever resolution I use, this is
the big thing with ecw.  
I must say I find that it was a bit faster with 1.7.4 than 1.8 and later.
But this could be related to other factors like internal network
capacities.. I haven't benched on it yet.

I am not sure, but I thought that it is using wavelet, pyramids and
tiles. Without tiles it could not be fast enough on higher resolution.

I found in GDAL ecwdataset.cpp that it is treating  single row
requests in IRasterIO in a special way:
    if( nYSize == 1 )
    {
        return GDALRasterBand::IRasterIO(eRWFlag, nXOff, nYOff, nXSize, nYSize,
                                         pData, nBufXSize, nBufYSize,
                                         eBufType, nPixelSpace, nLineSpace );
    }
That could be the difference between draw and identify. Are you able
to test with current master if I send you a patch for QGIS GDAL
provider?

Regis,

what are the dimensions (in pixels) of your big ECW ?

Radim,

I tried the following Python script that must be representative of how QGIS must
do picking (I guess it does a RasterIO(, .... x, y, 1, 1, ... 1, 1) )

from osgeo import gdal
import random
import sys

ds = gdal.Open(sys.argv[1])
xsize = ds.RasterXSize
ysize = ds.RasterYSize

while True:
    x = random.randint(0, xsize)
    y = random.randint(0, ysize)
    data = ds.ReadRaster(x,y,1,1)

After some time, the python process occupies the 1/4 of the total RAM. This is
the default behaviour of the ECW SDK documented in
http://gdal.org/frmt_ecw.html. I then set ECW_CACHE_MAXMEM=1000000 (1 million
bytes) and the memory usage was very small as expected. So I believe there is no
memory leak in the driver. Note: in the old ECW SDK 3.3 (I don't know for the
newer ones), there was a bug in some cases : if the RAM was > 8 GB, RAM / 4 > 2
GB which overflowed a 32 bit, resulting in the SDK allocating memory without
limit.

The ECW driver is quite complex in its reading strategy to establish "views",
but from what I've captured and you noticed, when you ask a window with a 1
pixel height, it goes to IReadBlock() which will fetch one entire line and put
it in the GDAL cache. This is to avoid issuing a SetView() each time a line is
read. The intent here is to be clever for the common line-by-line pattern
access. The drawback of this is that if the raster has a big width and you only
want to read one single pixel, the cost for reading the whole line might be much
greater than the cost of establishing SetView() for your single pixel.

I suppose your workaround in QGIS will be to read 1x2 pixel or something like
that.

Ultimately, we would probably need the following GDAL patch. I can't really say
if it will improve performance a lot because my biggest ECW is "just"
10000x10000.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python plugin: open a project file in "append" mode
Message-ID: <OF97D33D42.BDF45570-ONC1257A62.00411224-C1257A62.00411EF8@comune.trento.it>




Hi,

in the documentation, at the QgsProject entry, I read this:

bool 	read (QFileInfo const &file)
 	read project file

bool 	read ()
 	presuming that the caller has already reset the map canvas, map
registry, and legend


the first read (QFileInfo const &file) sets the project filename and calls
the second read (). As you read, it says: "presuming that the caller has
already reset the map canvas, map registry, and legend", so I wanted to use
it to append my QGIS project file to current.

But it doesn't happen: current maplayers are cleared and substituted to the
layers of the project file, althrough I still see the old project title in
the window titlebar.

Maybe it's a bug?

Here's how you can reproduce it:

write a plugin with this code:

  QgsProject.instance().read ( QFileInfo ( "<path of a qgis file>" ) )

My ecw is 1 080 000 * 1 090 000 pixels (IGN orthophotos for 28 French
departement.. 1/4 of France surface)
but I have also problem with scan25 and scan 100 that are smaller. (from 92
Go to 8 Go). This is really faster than a vrt with ten's of tiles.. except
for single pixel queries. 


Radim,
I'll try to to check if tiles are present, but I don't think so. We
compressed it with ERmapper without tile option.

I'm afraid I'm not yet able to test patches since I never compiled QGIS and
don't really have machines, skills and time to do that. I really have to set
up a dev machine. I could eventually send you a big ecw ? (10 Go on ftp)
Do I understand that it might be possible to solve directly the problem,
without having to add workaround options on project propertis as I
suggested?

Thanks guys,
R?gis
Thoughts?

Hi,
does anybody know why raster no data value is automatically added to
transparency list in properties dialog? It makes no sense IMO. No data
values are always rendered as transparent, no need to define them also
in transparent list.

It isn't the only odd thing/bug with nulls and transparency. For example
not always nulls are rendered transparent and when you try to add them to
the transparency list the entry is added as 0 instead.

I've seen nodata with huge float32 values.  Unfortunately they are rendered
in qgis and I can not make them transparent by adding the value to the
transparency list.

that's because gdal provider chooses a nodata value that is out of the
range of "real" values, when file does not contain a nodata value.

It should be fixed in master a795a5d334. Please test tomorrow with Win
night build, I am not sure however if it includes ECW support.

Yes.

Hum, I humbly suggest that the fix should be done in the ECW driver rather than 
in QGIS. The issue with the 2x2 workaround is that if other GDAL drivers have 
optimizations for the 1x1 pixel use case (which would be reasonable), they 
will be unused now.

I like those changes!
I've just forced the "Enable" text color to black (it's dark blue-gray
here) and added the tooltip to the "Close" button.

In addition, I've added a enable macros setting with values:
Never, Ask (default), Just for this session, Always.

Feel free to add other options, enable macros for the recently
opened projects or a way to define a list of trusted projects.

I'll push it to master if nobody enter objections.

Regards.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Symbol transparency,
	wrong value stored and displayed
Message-ID: <CAA6k8-KH-DPmmo0ZCiyMhmhy_br=9hxGjLzLzse2Pk=E1XCR2w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I noticed that the alpha value stored in the QML for
QgsSimpleFillSymbolLayer objects is wrong.

Here's the QML generated when the symbol transparency is 70%:
<pre>
    <symbol outputUnit="MM" alpha="0.298039" type="fill" name="0">
      <layer pass="0" class="SimpleFill" locked="0">
        <prop k="color" v="255,128,0,76"/>
        <prop k="color_border" v="0,0,0,76"/>
        ...
      </layer>
    </symbol>
</pre>

The alpha value for the whole symbol is right (~0.30), instead the
layer's color alpha should be 255, not 76 (which is 0.30*255).

Old style files would be rendered using double transparency after
the fix, unless I convert style files using the
QgsProjectFileTransform::transform1800to1900() function like it's
done for project files, but anyway those ones created using QGis
master (before the fix) will still be affected and I guess this is
not avoidable.

I'm already on it :)

Furthermore, the alpha value of a symbol is not taken into account
while drawing its sub-symbols.
E.g. with a symbol fill (transparency 50%) -> line pattern fill ->
outline (transparency 0%) -> simple line I would suppose the
simple line should be semitransparent because child of the
semi-transparent symbol fill, but it's fully opaque.

Is it the supposed behavior?

Regards.

I have a small suggestion concerning the default code for the macros.
It should have 4 spaces for the indention, as per PEP8. I realize it's
merely a matter of preference, but probably best to present Python
code in a standardized manner.


I really like the QgsMessageBar class. Definite improvement to the
GUI. It will be very useful and unobtrusive, compared to dialogs
popping up all the time. Nice work making it non-blocking and so the
canvas doesn't have to re-draw.

I can see several changes to the message bar that might help, for more
general app use:

- Simple means to 'scroll' (maybe just one way) through multi-line
messages, with close button only for total close of message(s).
- Easy means of passing QAction(s) to one or two buttons (like your
Enable button).
- Customize icon, background color, height, etc. via calls.

Hi Radim

Nodata should be rendered transparent in most cases. But it could also 
be possible you want to render it differently. E.g. the interpolation 
plugin writes nodata value in case it encounters numerical problems. 
Then it is useful to have the nodata values coloured to see where 
problems happened. Maybe there are other use cases as well.

Regards,
Marco

Guys, 
you are incredible!  It works really well and fast.
Furthermore, I don't know if you did something, but ecw drawing is
instantaneous now. I have never seen that on any GIS! 

Thanks a lot

Cheers

The default display of all symbols is to provide a way to see all the
symbols when no folder is clicked. I guess that makes it a lengthy.

Yes, there is a SVG cache being created and reused. You should be
definitely seeing reduced load times on second loads. I am a bit lost how
that doesn't occur.

But note that the cache is not persistent, so it cannot remember between
the sessions.

Message-ID: <CACbtZwT1qpOqM0oKkPmJ6eUBSKTKVTOHon=4xbW-2jd8c9cN8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I seem to have a weird problem. I compile the code in my build folder. Then
fire gdb ~/bin/qgis It all runs fine until

Debug: src/core/qgsproviderregistry.cpp: 462: (providerLibrary) Library

Then instead of loading the following,

....

QGIS simply just stalls, hard disk keeps spinning and CPU foes to 100%,
effectively hanging the entire system. I had to manually power off the
computer. I find a binary file "qgisstyle" in the scripts folder of qgis
repo source. This only seem to happen after the first run after compile.

Anyone could explain what I am being hit by?

Until it get fixed in GDAL we can use

  if ( GDALGetDriverShortName() == "ECW")

and once you fix that

  #if defined(GDAL_VERSION_NUM) && GDAL_VERSION_NUM < x.x
      if ( GDALGetDriverShortName() == "ECW")

There are other standard ways to highlight nodata:
- set background color
- set nodata pixels to a different value (r.null) and assign a color to it

If you and other users insist that it should be possible to render
nodata with a color, we have to add support for it in GUI (set color)
and renderers. Currently there is no such support.

 ok - is there anything we can do here? Add an option not to load all 
 symbols by default?

 I expect the symbol list to grow larger and larger, and speed is an 
 issue here.

 With my setup I have to wait around 10 seconds when I load the SVG 
 symbols for the first time, when loading it subsequently in the same 
 session it is maybe 1 second faster (8-9 seconds). Certainly not a lot 
 of speed gain from the caching?

 As my list of symbol grows I expect the number of symbols to double or 
 triple, which would mean I would have to wait 20-30 seconds each time I 
 want to select an SVG symbol.

 Is there really no faster way to implement this? Only load the folder 
 with symbols I am interested in? When I work on a project around gaz and 
 water I am not interested in symbols for leisure activities at all ...

 really strange. I don't see a lot of speed gain from the cache. I can't 
 even see if there is an advantage of the cache at all.

 thats ok.

 Thanks for any additional information / ideas around this problem.

Yes. I agree that it is confusing for users. I would like to hide from
users those internal nodata values, removing it from the transparency
list is one step.

 Hi,

 I noticed that the cache seems to better work if a symbol was already 
 an SVG symbols (only 4-5 seconds) whereas, if a symbol was e.g. a simple 
 marker before and I change it to an SVG symbol I have to wait 8-9 
 seconds for the list to load.

I also find it puzzling that the data type changes (say from byte to
int). I understand that it is needed to have a nodata value when none
is given, but it would be nice to hide this from the user as well.

User should not know about it. srcDataType() is used in metadata. Is
there another place where user can see the internal type used?

More challenging issue is how to handle data types in analytical tools
(map calculator for example) reading from data providers. For example
int+int should be int. The tool should use srcDataType(), but it would
not work well if another interface (which changes data type) was
plugged after the provider.

Seems reasonnable. Except I suggest using a string comparison function and not

Would you mind creating a ticket in GDAL trac about that ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Object owner design in QgsGraphBuilder
Message-ID: <B68B018A586B1B47B7B19F161A7CEAEB5C8D54@SRV122.stadt-uster.ch>

Hi

I've recently been working with the network analysis library.
 
When I had a look at the code I noticed the following:
 
In the constructor a new QgsGraph() mGraph is instantiated
In the destructor mGraph is deleted if not null
In the method graph() mGraph is returned and set to null
 
This leads to the effect, that if I request the graph() from the QgsGraphBuilder ( and I normally will, as that's the only purpose of using the QgsGraphBuilder ) I get the full ownership and have to delete the graph-object, when I'm finished with it. But this is not stated in the API. So without looking at the code there is no way to know this.
 
- How does python handle this? Does the following code delete this object?

graph = graphBuilder.graph()
graph = null

- In my opinion, this is a wrong design. I would rather pass a graph-object to the graphbuilder in the constructor and let it fill this object. Then I know, that is my responsibility to delete it afterwards.
 
I would provide a patch to change this if there are no good reasons to keep it the way it is.
 
Regards,
Matthias

It was true, it should be fixed now, nodata are always transparent.

I have changed the select tool so that nodata are not added to the list.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Work with WMS servers in Python
Message-ID: <CALuHMPBV_6Jh01CPD=RS0om80vhhwqrLDxvmExtgkdEwSxHhzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

It is possible to add WMS layers from Python plugin using
QgsRasterLayer class. But seems there is no way to work
with server itself, e.g request list of layers, available CRS
and formats.

As I understand, to make this possible we need to expose
QgsWmsProvider in SIP bindings. Maybe there is a better
way to do this? Any hints are more than welcome.

Thanks

While QgsWmsProvider isn't exposed through SIP, I would use OWSLib [1]

It would be cool to have a folder called "Recently Used" with the same
hierarchy as the svg folder and have that folder opened by default. We have
something like this with the projection selector.

I've noticed qgis hanging when you have a debug build.  When I go to the
console and click in it, the debug output unfreezes and qgis once again is
responsive.  Not sure if this is your problem?

I know about OWSLib, but IMHO it is better to create bindings.
Only not sure is this correct way or not, this is provider code
not core functionality.

often it happens that when i update sextante torotise tells that here is a
conflict so i have to delete sextante folder, re-install sextante via qgis
and finally re-update sextante via tortoise.
is there anything i'm failing?
is it right to update directly "original" directory of sextante or is it
better to update another copy of sexante not in .qgis subfolder and then to
copy it?

Just figured out that the sip option /Factory/ tells python that it
takes ownership of this object. So there won't be any memory loss. I'd
still say this should be changed and if not at least stated in the API
so anybody using this in C++ will be aware of this without reading the
code.

Oggetto: 	[GRASS-user] What distance is being measured and used for
buffers ?

Hello,

I have a fundamental question about distances in GRASS, also in relation 
to buffers, that I stumbled upon trying to help a student who tried to 
draw buffers around cities indicating the maximum distance airplanes 
could fly at different times in history.

To test, I used the World Mercator projection:

+proj=merc
+lon_0=0
+k=1
+x_0=0
+y_0=0
+no_defs
+a=6378137
+rf=298.257223563
+towgs84=0.000,0.000,0.000
+to_meter=1

This projection has obvious deformations the further you get from the 
equator, and thus distances are seriously distorted[1].

Using GRASS 6.5 to create a buffer of 6000km around Belgium gives a map 
which shows a circular buffer [2].

Using the distance measuring tool in the wxGUI confirms that the 
distance from Belgium to the buffer line in all directions is around 6000km.

However, the actual distance is very different, especially towards the 
North: According to CloudMade's routing website based on OSM data 
northern tip of Norway is only ~3500km by car from Brussels, so very far 
from 6000km.

I get exactly the same results using r.grow.distance and r.cost.

For comparison, I used a simple Plate Carree projection:

+proj=eqc
+lat_ts=0
+lat_0=0
+lon_0=0
+x_0=0
+y_0=0
+no_defs
+a=6371007
+b=6371007
+to_meter=1

Distortions are obviously different [3]. And the 6000km buffer is also 
positioned differently compared to the land masses [4]. Again, measuring 
the distances with the wxGUI distance tool gives me ~6000km in all 
directions.

So, my question: which "distance" is used for measurement and for buffer 
creation ? A distance based buffer in map units should lead to deformed 
buffers in most projection systems. Is there anyway to achieve such 
deformed buffers and correct distance measures ?

Hi,

This "problem" doesn't sound GRASS or QGIS specific. As far as I know, all
GIS act like that.

Compare http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/8031/187 for what happens if users
(analysts at the Economist in that case) are not aware of it.

Regards,
Anita

Hi!
To my knowledge - if you are doing some kind of "global" investigations you
have to know which projection you choose (some fit better - some fit less)
..
Anita is right when saying you have to be aware of the "specialities" of
GIS. I'd say that's why there are GIS-Specialists .. Otherwise everybody
could just take a GIS Software and there would not be any need for
experienced people ..
IIRC the first thing I learned in GIS was the difference between direct and
"direct" connection of points depending on projection ..

So for the answer to the question .. probably a "self defined" equidistant
projection might be a solution (depending on the point of view).
with a global view it might be hard to find a "correct" solution for
different towns worldwide ..

just my 2?

kind regards
Werner

Hi Radim

I don't have a strong opinion about wether to show nodata value in 
transparency list in the GUI or not. After all, the renderer sees only 
the transparency list and does not care which of them is the nodata 
value (except for the decision if the renderer is using transparency or 
not).

If you think it is a big useability plus to hide that from the user, 
that's ok for me.

>we have to add support for it in GUI (set color)
>and renderers. Currently there is no such support.

There is. If you e.g. have -9999 as nodata value and configure 
singleband pseudocolor renderer to render this as red, you can do it in 
the dialog.

>There are other standard ways to highlight nodata:
>- set background color

Yes, but it is less convenient. But nodata analysis does not happen to 
often for me, so I could live with a workaround.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] dynamic (live processed) layers , a very bad idea?
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xFp7zqbBAN9BvbEY=HKCV4jtkr522pocHjyAdYWyrH6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Sometimes I would like to have the possibility to have dynamic layers.
This term has a wide use, with different meanings, in the plethora of GIS
softwares. With dynamic layer I mean a layer whose provider is some code
acting on the original data, e.g. a spatial operator, a map algebra, etc.
I know that it can implicate heavy workloads, depending on the processing
involved, the amount of data, etc. In general I feel it would be nice being
able to expose (in a qgs project, and so for QGis Server too) "live
processed" layers.

I know it's not an original idea. I simply wondered if it has been ever
dicussed for QGis.

As I removed nodata from transparency list, I also added nodata check
to renderers.

It is a bit confusing I think, especially with no data values added
internally by QGIS (out of data range). But especially it would be
problem if for example, original data type is integer, but QGIS
internally uses float, in that case it would not be possible to use
QIntValidator in transparency list.

Yes, but with gray and RGB?

Hi all

I try to start the developpement for a custom application with qgis, so I try simple things like add a vector layer but I have some problems. In a python console when I try to do something like that :

>>> core.QgsApplication.setPrefixPath('/usr',True)
>>> core.QgsApplication.initQgis()
>>> l = core.QgsVectorLayer('/home/ludo/data/test.shp', 'test', 'ogr')
>>> l.isValid()

I always have a False result

But if I try in the python console of qgis :

>>> l = QgsVectorLayer('/home/ludo/data/test.shp', 'test', 'ogr')
>>> l.isValid()

The result is True

Is someone have an idea ? Are there any other documentation that http://qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/

Thanks a lot

Ludovic

Message-ID: <CALuHMPCOSkJC0+XEqVUyVADEB=7_qiEiLPVjMzaWsUJnuiGzLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

Now all data providers in QGIS implemented as plugins and have
no Python (some of them also C++) bindings. Having bindings for
providers will allow to work with complex datasources from plugins.
For example, now it is impossible to get response from WMS
server in Python plugin using only QGIS API.

Maybe we should provide bindings for plugins? But here another
problem appears: where to place this bindings? Core is wrong place
because availability of plugins are not guaranteed. As possible
solution plugins can be linked to core library.

Any opinions?

When chatting about this to Alex earlier, I was also wondering is
there really any need to have the providers be plugins? Maybe things
would be simpler if they were compiled directly into core (or a single
providers lib with python bindings)?

It would be easier, but one has to be able to know which provider(s)
are available at runtime.

There is a growing set of python unit tests that you can consult for ideas.

Providiing the stdout from your console might help us to understand
where your problem originates. Here is a little sript I often use:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

import os
import sys
from qgis.core import QgsApplication, QgsProviderRegistry

myUseDefaultPathFlag = True
QGISAPP.setPrefixPath('/usr', myUseDefaultPathFlag)
QGISAPP.initQgis()
s = QGISAPP.showSettings()
print s
r = QgsProviderRegistry.instance()
if not 'ogr' in r.providerList():
    print 'Could not find OGR provider!'
else:
    print 'Providers found ok!'

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Hope that helps!

Radim,

I've tested the big ECW (1.8 GB, 141970 x 141970) provided by Jukka and could 
indeed reproduce a noticable performance issue when simulating picking with my 
tiny GDAL python script. In QGIS, the performance was still OK however, a few 
hundreds of milliseconds for each picking. It is just when you do a lot of 
iterations that you begin to notice the slowness, or if the dataset is really 
huge.

I've fixed that in http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/4790 in trunk and 1.9 
branch. So it will be in GDAL 1.9.2. Actually, as I think that the ECW driver 
is generally available through a plugin (and not built-in in GDAL DLL), this 
could be available sooner if the ECW plugin is rebuilt with the fixed sources.

Best regards,

Even

Folks,

I have created a calendar item for me on the weekend to rebuild
the 1.9 ECW plugin for OSGeo4W.  Hopefully I'll get it done soon.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] improvements to (cpt-city) color ramps and
	download plugin ColorRampManager
Message-ID: <CA+TxYvPPcd7MMU2a3qT73paqoFFSQiQUN7wv_LkrzC8V+-Xvcg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have just commited a few improvements to the cpt-city color ramp
management, as well as the associated plugin used to download the svg
color ramps - ColorRampManager 0.2.

I have been working with the maintainer of the cpt-city archive in
order to better organize the files and information/metadata, as well
as creating a free-to-distribution selection within qgis.

To see these changes you must
- use latest master version of qgis
- update ColorRampManager to 0.2 and download wither cpt-city entire
archive or qgis selection


Highlights are

- dramatic speed improvement when loading many ramps
- display of author and copyright information
- better descriptions of directories and selections (via new xml files)

Changes to ColorRampManager

- 3 sets of ramps: builtin (no download), qgis selection (700KB ) and
full cpt-city archive (3MB)
- select where you want the archives to be saved: qgis user dir or
qgis install dir
- save the changes, then go the the style manager, it will use the
archive + location you selected in the color ramp manager.
- for now qgis-selection is hosted on my website, need to find a place
on qgis.org to put those files.

debug/dev stuff

- internal refactoring
- svg preview for debugging (left-click on the preview, this shows the
builtin svg preview)
- script to make a zip file out of a given selection - this will be
the base of final selection that will ship with qgis.


Please post any comments/feedback/bugs here

I think it is the same. But that, my system being a small netbook with atom

Any idea what makes the debug build to hang up? Perhaps there is a fix.

Getting your ideas. Better open a ticket in the bug tracker and put it in
the SymbolV2 category so that it falls in the TODO list or is there one
ticket already?

I wish I know what causes this problem.  If this problem does not have a

Hi Ludovic,

probably the prefix path you are using is wrong. Try with '/usr/local/' or
check where qgis bins and libraries are located and adjust the prefix path
accordingly.

Hello

Thanks for your answer but I think the prefix is ok. I verified in the python console of qgis with QgsApplication.prefixPath()

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Sextante - OTB plugin and SAR data
Message-ID: <CADs9uc-AODuWvMYYr-_HxBppaqa=Y9ndeC2M2AhUiNqfepgfdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

How do you install this Sextante - OTB plugin?

http://code.google.com/p/sextante/source/browse/trunk/soft/bindings/qgis-plugin/src/sextante/otb/?r=144

I am using QGIS 1.8 for Mac OS X.

I suppose this plugin can be used to process SAR data (i.e. Synthetic
Aperture Radar).

As mentioned in OTB (http://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/otb_overview.html )

I am particularly interested in using QGIS OTB SAR for REDD+ MVR.

http://www.fauna-flora.org/conservation-on-the-radar/
http://www.planet-action.org/web/85-project-detail.php?projectID=9711

Thanks.

Noli

As I mentioned, this is Mac OS X.

I installed Monteverdi-1.12 (which is OTB for Mac OS X). It has a
Resources/lib/otb and Resources/MacOS folders.

/lib/otb folder is where the dynamic libraries is located.

/MacOS folder has the other libraries (e.g. libgeos.dylib, etc.).

Any suggestion how to organise (e.g copy these libraries)?

How to you compile OTB in Linux?

http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/download.html

I can compile this in Mac OS X.

Note that MacOS X is just like linux system. The system look like this:

/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/library
/usr/loca/include

How do you install the QGIS Sextante OTB plugin in Linux?

Sure, additional documentation is always a nice thing to have :)

I have commited some updates to this library. The code-changes I made will add some functionality without breaking any existing plugin and do some additional sanity checks to avoid misusage of the QgsGraphBuilder.

Documentation blocks added:
https://github.com/matthias-kuhn/Quantum-GIS/commit/6cae97155901525e93cbdf31af7ac7ad7c103805

Add asserts to protect from accessing null-pointers:
https://github.com/matthias-kuhn/Quantum-GIS/commit/0b34bd76658688509aef988f37dd8aa755722dbc

Return ids of created vertexes and arcs
https://github.com/matthias-kuhn/Quantum-GIS/commit/3d4f2251c759bcc1bce91aa1424b79a01c0c22b8

Please review and merge as you like. Any feedback is welcome.

Hi Noli

Monteverdi is not "OTB for MacOSX".
Monteverdi is one desktop application with some OTB functionnalities in it.

This is unrelated to the Qgis/Sextante interface.
To use OTB from Qgis on MacOSX, you will need to compile OTB from sources.

Instructions can be found in [1] and [2].
Especially, you need to set BUILD_APPLICATIONS to ON.

Julien

Hi Julien,

Thanks for your reply.

Now, how to use cmake on InsightToolkit-4.2.0?

There is no instruction how to I install ITK (i.e.
InsightToolkit-4.2.0) using cmake?

Anybody how to know how to install ITK?

(I installed cmake already for Mac OS X.)

Thanks,

Noli

Hi!

I've tried the R script in scripts/Raster histogram
and do not get any plot, just get what can be seen here
(after trying multiple alternatives):
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3180464/RSextante.jpeg

I've also tried making the script shown in the web page:
##layer=vector
##field=field layer
##nortest=group
library(nortest)
>lillie.test(layer[[field]])

and do not get anything in the output console

Finally, what R class is used for raster objects? My idea is to
actually try to write
some scripts using the raster package.

(using qgis 1.8.0 and SEXTANTE v1.0.7 on ubuntu 10.04)

Hi!

I see you get the same result as I do .. :(
Somehow the png is not written but the coresponding html page IS written ..
I thought I missed a R-module and did investigate already a bit but
did not find out why ..
When I try the same thing directly in R (the histogram module)
everything gets written correctly .. so I don't know where the bug is
..
But "nice" to see that I am not the only one with that problem ..

currently no time to do further investigation :(
If you find out new things please share

kind regards
Werner

Hi Noli,

For MacOSX, the easier path I know of is to use MacPort to install all 
the needed dependencies.
With MacPort, install the following : expat, curl, tiff, geotiff, jpeg, 
gdal, mercurial, cmake, etc (I may have missed a few)

Grab this ctest script :
http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-DevUtils/file/21ee66ab6fd3/Config/leod/leod-OTB-Nightly-macport_light.cmake

And customize it :
- change CTEST_SITE and CTEST_BUILDNAME to whatever you like
- change CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY and point to where you extracted the OTB 
sources
- change CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY and point it to where the build file 
will live
- change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the path where OTB will be installed 
after successfull build
- in the CTEST_INITIAL_CACHE part, you might want to change to :

BUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF
BUILD_EXAMPLES:BOOL=OFF
BUILD_APPLICATIONS:BOOL=ON
OTB_WRAP_PYTHON:BOOL=OFF
OTB_WRAP_QT:BOOL=OFF
OTB_WRAP_JAVA:BOOL=OFF

to reduce the build time.


Then from a shell, start :
ctest -S <path_to_the_script> -VV

Go to your build dir and type "make install"

Then look in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin and you should be able to launch 
an OTB application (otbcli_Something scripts)

Then in Sextante configuration, you should set :
-"OTB command line tools" option to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin
-"OTB applications folder" option to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/otb

And you're good to go.



Good luck,
Julien

 What is the R code being run here? Some R advanced graphics functions
need to be wrapped in a 'print' function in order to actually produce
output on a graphics device, and so when run non-interactively, when
printing happens automatically after each command line, users are
often surprised to not get any output...

'histogram' from the lattice package is one such, 'hist' from the base
graphics system isn't....

 Where's the R function source?

 - looking at Raster_histogram.rsx in the sextante plugin it looks
like it uses 'hist' and so that problem shouldn't apply.

 Happy debugging...

 I think the subprocess.Popen call in RUtils is at fault. The
"command" is a list, but I think shell=True causes it to be sent to
the shell as a command line. If you concatenate (join) the command
list with spaces into a single string, this works:

 proc = subprocess.Popen(" ".join(command), shell=True,
stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
stdin=subprocess.PIPE,stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
                                universal_newlines=True)


line 62 of RUtils.py in the sextante plugin.

You are right, because shell=True is used when command is a string,
not an array.

Plus it's deemed a security hazard:
Warning Invoking the system shell with shell=True can be a security
hazard if combined with untrusted input. See the warning under
Frequently Used Arguments for details.

 That's normally a problem when running code on a server with
parameters coming from the request, but not in a desktop environment.

 The code should probably also check the return value from the
proc.wait() call for errors...

Hi!
Tried your new line (actually it was line 62 in my sextante)
with no luck ..
same result as before :(

So I still do not know where the problem is ..
Probably Victor will be at the next hackfest and I can show my notebook
to him ;)

but thanks for your try anyway .

kind regards
Werner

Hmmm. I'll maybe have another look and send you a version with some
debugging statements. I was in a rush., it definitely worked fir me! The
reason you had it in a different line was because I had some debug print
statements in.

AFAIK it isn't possible to register a python script as a dataprovider.
Maybe it sounds odd, but I think it would interesting if we could have it.
Has it been ever considered? How hard would it be to implement it?

Hi Julien,

Thanks for this instruction how to build / compile and install OTB for
Mac OS X and make QGIS Sextante OTB python plugin working in OS X.

I am using William's frameworks, "standard configure, make and make
install", and supplement things using Homebrew if I can't make things
working with the "standard configure...".

> With MacPort, install the following : expat, curl, tiff, geotiff, jpeg,

I think I can easily achieve those dependencies you mentioned.

> Grab this ctest script :
> http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-DevUtils/file/21ee66ab6fd3/Config/leod/leod-OTB-Nightly-macport_light.cmake

Looking at this cmake script, it seems that ITK is not needed after all.

Yes, I will have a go on this script (i.e. edit it) and see if I can
make it working.

Thanks again for your help.

Regards,

Noli

Hi Julien,

As you can see I am not using MacPort. MacPort download the source in
the script that you mentioned in your previous posting?


http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/download.html

Based on the instruction above. It is not clear what to do with hg
cloning in Mac OS X.

Yes, I can do (below) in the terminal.

hg clone http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB

Would this suffice, or I need to more?

What do, I do next, do I need to clone OTB-Applications and OTB-Qgis-plugin?


######
    OTB-Applications

The current development version is available from the OTB-Applications
mercurial repository at: http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-Applications

    OTB-Qgis-plugins

The current development version is available from the OTB-Qgis-plugins
mercurial repository at: http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-Qgis-plugins

Noli,

I started looking at this to see what needs to be done to use my frameworks.

First, FLTK.

You need the dev 1.3.x source, for updates to support the new libpng in my UnixImageIO framework.  You also need my FreeType framework (not part of the QGIS requirements).

This configuration is just minimal - no tests/examples.  I'm not sure if some of the options are needed for a static build, though may be if you want the examples.  (the build system is messy - checking for things twice, ignoring what I give it, ...)  in a Terminal, in the fltk source folder:

mkdir build-snow
cd build-snow
cmake -Wno-dev -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel \
-D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="x86_64" \
-D OPTION_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
-D HAVE_FREETYPE_H=/Library/Frameworks/FreeType.framework/Headers/freetype.h \
-D FREETYPE_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/FreeType.framework/Headers/config \
-D LIB_png=/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework \
..

I'm working on OTB now.  I'll get back to you when I figure that out, probably in a day or two.

If we're using this in Sextante, a python module package for QGIS, don't we want the python wrappers?  Seems silly that Sextante devs would ignore a direct python interface to OTB.

Hi William,

Thanks for looking into this problem.

Hopefully you can make it easier for us (mac users) to have OTB and
QGIS OTB plugin working in OS X.

I think mac os users need a Remote Sensing tools e.g. OTB and QGIS OTB
python plugin.

Thanks.

Hi Julien,

Disregard my last question, my last posting. I got confuse with the
"macport" reference in the script.

I read the script again and I got it now, almost.

I see I don't need to hg clone manually since it will be pulling the
nightly build

#######
execute_process( COMMAND ${CTEST_HG_COMMAND} pull
http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-Nightly
                 WORKING_DIRECTORY "${CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY}"
                 OUTPUT_VARIABLE   PULL_RESULT
                 ERROR_VARIABLE    PULL_RESULT )
file(WRITE ${PULL_RESULT_FILE} ${PULL_RESULT} )
########


OK. I changed the source and binary directories to:

##########################
SET (CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY "/Users/nsicadl/Dashboard/nightly/OTB-Release/src")
SET (CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY "/Users/nsicad/Dashboard/nightly/OTB-Release/build")
##########################

Do I need to create these directories (manually) before running the script?

I would like to change this line (below) to something else - not "OTB-macport"?

########

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING=$ENV{HOME}/Dashboard/nightly/OTB-Release/install/OTB-macport

########

Can I do this like this?,

######
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING=$ENV{HOME}/Dashboard/nightly/OTB-Release/install/OTB-mtn_lion
######

Would this be fine?

Thanks.

Noli

Hi again, 
no update again in OSGEO4W. dev version of master is a795a5d3 22/08/2012
11:04. 
Is there something broken or is it normal behaviour? I really thought it was
a nightly update.

CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY is where you checked out the sources (or untar them), so it must exists.
CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY : i don't remember, just try

To compile on 10.8, you will need a recent FLTK 1.3 checkout.
The current MacPort version (r9650) compiles fine on 10.8, but not the 
official release.

Also note that compiling the OTB-FLTK bridge is not necessary for using 
OTB from QGis.
So OTB_USE_VISU_GUI=OFF is fine when configuring OTB.

Hi William,

We are not losing much when using the command line interface.
Using the OTB-Python wrappers we could have a better progress reporting, 
but it is minor.

On the other hand, we run into packaging/dependencies hell when trying 
to link Qgis and OTB together.
With the current state of the gdal package on some platform 
(debian/ubuntu), it would crash.

Also, we are clear of potential licensing issue (compatibility between 
cecill and gpl licence) with this setup.

So let's say it is a good solution for now...
Victor might have more arguments on this.



Best,
Julien

 Replacing shell=True with shell=False also works for me. I'm using
Sextante plugin version 1.0.7 on Qgis 1.7.4.

 Maybe your R doesn't have the right packages installed, or you didn't
do a plugin reload after editing...

 Print the command variable just before the subprocess.Popen line
(60). Test the output from proc.wait() line 62.

 I tried a grass algorithm and it just flat crashed Qgis with an
assertion violation... Oh well...

Hm, I wondered about that.  Greatly simplifies otb for QGIS.

Message-ID: <CA+TxYvMig2H8e9Bc28-X9Y+UjuEHtYndfQCJT=sSTXD1im36fQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to update a plugin (valuetool) to the new api, and there
are a number of functions missing from the bindings (related to stats,
histograms and pyramids, among others) because they were moved from
qgsrasterlayer.

I was wondering what should be the appropriate strategy, fix them as
we go along or wait some time that things are settled?

Are there other drastic changes planned for raster layer / provider?

thanks

Well, lots going on.  OTB linking was giving me problems (not well configured for OS X linking method) until I found the key.

First, as Julien said, FLTK in OTB is not needed in the QGIS plugin, so skip that.  All you should need is the OTB source.  All of the dependencies have internal versions, so we can force it to use my frameworks and leave everything else to the internal sources.

One big issue I found in this is with Apple's SDKs.  If you are on Lion+, Apple changed the SDKs starting with 10.7 SDK to remove the symlinks to /usr/local and /Library/Frameworks.  This means that linking/includes to these locations (custom SW in /usr/loca, my frameworks) will fail when using the 10.7 or 10.8 SDKs.  AND, if you don't specify an SDK in cmake, it defaults to the SDK matching the current system - there is no way to tell cmake to NOT use a SDK!

SO, I need to update the QGIS build notes, but if you are compiling on 10.6 Snow Leopard, you should have no problems.  If you are compiling on Lion+, you need to "fix" the SDKs.  Let me know and I'll spell that out.

Assuming Snow Leopard or a fixed Lion SDK:

Download the latest OTB source and unzip.

In the OTB source folder:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel \
-D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="x86_64" \
-D CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET="10.6" \
-D CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT="/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk" \
-D OTB_WRAP_QT=OFF -D OTB_WRAP_JAVA=OFF -D OTB_WRAP_PYTHON=OFF \
-D BUILD_APPLICATIONS=ON -D OTB_USE_VISU_GUI=OFF \
-D TIFF_LIBRARY=/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework \
-D GEOTIFF_LIBRARY=/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework \
-D JPEG_LIBRARY=/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework \
-D USE_OPENMP=OFF \
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR=/usr/local/lib/otb \
..

(match the deployment target and SDK version to your system version)

make

(since this is a big project, parallel compilation is good here.  add -j n, with n=number to match your number of processors*cores.  see the QGIS install doc for a more detailed description)

sudo make install


That should do it.

Hi William,

Thanks having a go with this.

I am using Mountain Lion (10.8.1).

Would it help if I am going to create this folder,

/Developer/SDKs and copy the MacOSX10.8.sdk from Xcode?

The end result would be like this (below) for the directory

  -D CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT="/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk"

#####

Now, I did this.

Do have any idea why I am getting this error ?

cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local

I go this one.

Drastic no. But the identify() method could be probably reconsidered to
return doubles instead of strings. WMS however usually cannot return
numerical values.

Anyway, no need to wait with bindings, i think.

Hi Noli,

Check the cmake variables and verify they point to actual directories.
You are getting this error since the cmake variable you are using are 
not defined.

Same problem with your script, (i.e. gdal problem as well).

I will post the error after this.

Hi Julien,

OK.

I inserted this:

SET (CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY  "/Users/nsicad/Documents/Work_1new/OTB/build")

I got gdal problem as well (see logs below).

Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] implement data provider in python?

I have a vague memory that the python data provider idea was
considered a while ago. I was thinking about how one could get direct
access from Qgis to R spatial data sets stored in R's binary files.
One method would have been to write a provider in python that used Rpy
to bridge to R, but wasn't possible because you can't write data
providers in Python. It could be done in C by linking to R's C
library, but at that point I lost interest and used a looser coupling
to get my R data into Qgis.

The argument then went that if the provider was designed to access a
file it would be a better idea to write a GDAL/OGR driver, then even
people outside QGIS could use it. Obviously that would have to be
C/C++ though.

And then I think everyone got bored and went back to doing things.

Do you have a specific use-case?

Hi,

First please change the CTEST_SITE variable in the script (put something 
as "noli" or whatever), otherwise you will overwrite my submissions to [1].
It seems like you have internet access issue (see errors at the end of 
the script, maybe missing "http_proxy" env var) so your build results 
did not get to the dashboard this time...
Also please change "ctest_start(Nightly)" to "ctest_start(Experimental)".

About your gdal issue, look in the script for the section where GDAL* 
variables are set :

GDALCONFIG_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/opt/local/bin/gdal-config
GDAL_CONFIG:FILEPATH=/opt/local/bin/gdal-config
GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR:STRING=/opt/local/include
GDAL_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/local/lib/libgdal.dylib

And customize this to match William's framework.
Maybe it's just about changing "/opt" (macport install location) to 
"/usr/local" (William's framework location)
You have to find where the "gdal-config" executable is on your system.

Do the same for GEOTIFF*, TIFF* and JPEG* variables.
For the other ones (EXPAT, CURL) cmake shall find the OSX version itself.

Hi Barry,
" you can't write data providers in Python". This is the point: I wonder if
this is in absolute or it is in this moment. Given Qgis can load python and
C++ plugins, I wondered if a similar thing could be achieved for data
providers. I can imagine two ways:

 - extend the data provider registry to load python modules and then extend
the data provider class to make it call the data provider interface methods
both on Python and C++ providers (doesn't the plugins loader/registry do
something similar?)
 - write a generic C++ data provider that acts as a proxy to the actual
python data provider.

I don't know how hard it would be, but I can't find any technical barrier...

My use case are two.
One is to have "dynamic layers", in the sense I explained in a previous
email. Let's say I have some code that does clustering on some data source.
I would like to expose it as "live", meaning that it appears as any other
static layer, but it's processed realtime.
The other is having the possibility to bridge, easily, any kind of data
source, using python as an adapter.

Meanwhile, I just test William's script with some addtion for the GDAL.

Here is part of the logs.

William, what is it the GDAL have this nos

e.g.

--   Testing if GDAL has tiff    -- no
--   Testing if GDAL has geotiff -- no
--   Testing if GDAL has jpeg    -- no

Julien, I think I will encounter this problem with GDAL with your
script as well. I am using William's GDAL framework.

Thanks.

This is a test which fails on some linux distros (ubuntu/debian).
I've never seen it fail on a Mac.
And as William's framework is built with external geotiff, this should 
not fail.

Might be a missing DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (the test actually runs an 
executable during configuration).

Anyway, proceed further with the compilation.
It should be ok, this is just a warning.

This is OK.
It means gdal does not exposes tiff and geotiff symbols.
This does not mean gdal does not have the tiff/jpeg driver.

you might be able to achieve that using "plugin layers" which are map
layers that can be created and updated by plugins

ok, gotcha

I implemented the stats functions but there are still a few missing,

OK, SDK fix.

You figured out the first part - copy the SDK from the Xcode.app to /Developer/SDKs.  Now it needs some symlinks to see outside the standard system stuff:

mkdr /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk/Library
ln -s /Library/Frameworks /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk/Library/
mkdir /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk/Library/usr/local
ln -s /usr/local/include /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk/Library/usr/local/
ln -s /usr/local/lib /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk/Library/usr/local/

It may be the gdal-config path creating confusion.  There are actually 2 version of gdal-config in my framework.  The one you used that is in the unix/ folder is designed for old software that doesn't handle framework flags - it uses the standard -Lpath -llib form.  Maybe the test for the GDAL functions is seeing the Macports GDAL first, which causes a confusion of GDAL and tiff/geotiff libs.

The gdal-config in the Programs folder is what you want - it uses -framework linking, so you don't accidentally get a non-frameword GDAL.  Same goes for manually specifying the GDAL lib and include paths. So:

-D GDAL_CONFIG=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs/gdal-config
-D GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Headers
-D GDAL_LIBRARY=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework

(cmake knows that a .framework for a library is a framework, and how to translate that for compilation)

What do you mean Etienne?
How can I serve a layer, dynamically, through a python plugin? I don't want
to have a plugin that creates a memory layer, but that gets queried on
every pan/zoom/etc to retrieve the update data.

I am not quite sure how it works, and there are few details available,
maybe someone who knows how it works can provide some insight?

The openlayer plugin is implemented as a plugin layer. It doesn't
interact with other layers, but seems to do what you are talking about
(gets queried on every pan/zoom/etc to retrieve the update data).
Have a look at the code.

Thanks Etienne, I didn't know it.
Yet it doesn't do exactly what I was thinking about, beacuse I suppose that
the plugin layer cannot be managed as a true layer. AFAICS it has to
implement the rendering operations, which set the style, etc.
Having a "plugin provider" would require only to write the code to provide
the data, leaving the rest of the management (styling, rendering, etc.) to
Qgis.

Hi all.
I guess the metadata are wrong, as the plugin keeps on asking to be upgraded.

Hi,
Didn't someone say they were working on an on-the-fly graticule provider, which is similar to your use case (but I doubt it involved Python)?

Anyway, I just make and make install.

I wonder how important is support for Tiff, GeoTiff, JPEG in GDAL affects OTB.

Yes, I managed to compile and install ITK, It takes hours to compile
and install it in Mac OS X.

Now, the Sextante OTB QGIS python plugin. It is not present in
Sextante, where can I download the QGIS python OTB plugin?

Julien, you have the address of the repository for this plugin?

There is no OTB instruction in Sextante Help that comes with Sextante
plugin. It is not written yet.

I am using Sextante 1.0.7.

Thanks.

As Julien mentioned, this is just testing whether GDAL has TIFF/GeoTIFF/JPEG *libraries* built into it and exposed as libraries.  It does not mean GDAL does not support these formats.  I don't think you can build GDAL without these formats in the first place.

No need to do that - OTB has an internal copy, see your cmake log:

Hi Julien,

I am almost at the end of this struggle :-).

On 8/27/12, Julien Malik <julien.malik at c-s.fr> wrote:

Yes, I did the above.

I got a lot of otbcli_* in the /usr/local/bin

Do I need to run some of these binaries to get the SEXTANTE OTB Plugin working.

I see the sextante/otb is present.

What file (python file?), I am looking to see these parameters?

It seem that my /sextante/otb/__init__.py is empty.

I got these files:

OTBAlgorithm.py
OTBAlgorithmProvider.py
OTBUtils.py

Thanks.

Please set both for the moment.

I don't remember why there are two variables for the same thing.
I'll try to clarify that in the next OTB release and keep only one 
variable, and make FindGDAL.cmake recognize William's framework 
automagically.
We are currently using the default FindGDAL provided by cmake.

OK, needs some clarification too, I agree the message is not clear enough.

Actually, OTB cannot build with external ITK version in its current state.

The only thing we really need as external library is GDAL, which you get from William's framework.
For the rest, default system libraries should be ok (expat, curl...), and internal version for the rest is ok too.

Yes that is what Sextante/OTB uses.
Better check first that you have installed everything properly, and can 
actually process some images with it.

Hey Rob,
 
I'm trying to get something similar accomplished in another python project and stumbled across a problem your plugin might be affected of as well. I couldn't test it because of an error with character encoding. [1]
I have a layer provided by postgis, where the geometry column is not the last column. The leads to the problem, that any attribute column that comes after the geometry column is shifted by 1 and so are the values. So a table:

A | b | the_geom  | c | d |
---------------------------
1 | 2 | Point(0,0)| 4 | 5 |

Results in a memory layer:

A | b | c | d |

I fixed it by inserting a dummy column at the index where in the original data the geometry column was located. Maybe you can use this in your code as well [2]

	This plugin has now been uploaded to http://plugins.qgis.org/ and is awaiting approval (thanks Paolo).
	
	Changelog:
	* New icon
	* Added comment to dialogue window
	* Changed menu entry to "Edit Any Layer -> Create Editable Layer..." 
	
	Alister, thanks for the suggestions but, although the name "Copy as memory layer" would explain _what_ the plugin does, I will stick with "Edit Any Layer" as this explains _why_ you would want to run the plugin. I have also not added an option to copy selected items only (and this is low priority as this feature is in QGIS core UI).

Hi all.
Yesterday the plugin points4qgis was accepted, but it is apparently uninstallable.
Perhaps better adding a sample install before acceptance?
All the best.

Message-ID: <1346329708241-4998864.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,
I use this code for selecting features, for selecting a feature and get its
parameters in a form.
It works well on Ubuntu, but when moving to Windows 7 with QGIS 1.7.4 or
QGIS 1.8,
the selection does not work, seems to be the intersect function that returns
no geometry.

Does anybody knows something about that ?
Thanks for your help

Cheers,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Measuring and QgsExpression
Message-ID: <503FA815.80307@homann.se>

Hi all!

I've been cleaning up the map tools for measuring area, length and angle. Now, they all use the same setting as identifyresult,
the setting that is selected in "Options...", and includes preferred unit of measurment, what ellipsoid to calculate using, and
the possibility to select No ellipsoid / planimetric calculations. Also scalebar has the same behaviour. There has been some bugs
regarding this.

There's then the question of areas/length calculated by Fieldcalculator that Martin D wrote. Today, it uses planimetric calculation
on the layer CRS. If the layer is in WGS84 and th eprojection in SWEREF 99 TM, tha calculated area is reported in square degrees.
Also, it does not take into account preferred units.

So, I set out to fix this, but Martin raised - very valid - concerns about reproducability. QgsExpression is also used for
other things such as rendering, and when a project is saved and sent to another user who has different settings f?r units/ellipsoid, the
rendering styles (and field calculator of course) gives different result. Not so good. I have a couple of ideas:

1) Let units/ellipsoid settings be a part of the project rather than global settings.
2) Let fieldcalculator be aware of global settings, but other parts using expressions is not necessairly so (such as rendering)
3) Accept different results depending on user setting.

I have also another idea, to create a project-wide calculation context that is *shared* among all units. It should be aware of
physical units and handle arithmetics on those:1 m x 1m is 1 m2. Like in VHDL. :-) More or less extend QgsDistanceArea to include
units and "promote it" to proejct level (like Project CRS).

Adding functions to QgsExpression that pretty-prints physical values into text string seems also like a good ide. Or is there already?

Long post. Thoughts?

Hi,

I got problem in OGR2Layers Plugin, the Output textbox (i.e. output
directory) is not active in QGIS 1.8 Mac OS X.

It means that I can not input the directory for the output file, do
you know how to solve this problem?

It does not accept the default directory for the output as well.

"GDAL Active Layers" is also disabled.

Has anybody encountered the problem in QGIS 1.8 in other platforms?

How do you fix this issue?

Thanks.

Hi Luca,

The plugin try to write in /Applications folder in Mac OS X.

It manage to write the geojson files but not the index.html file. I
just find the geojson files there now.

Yes, I replicated this error in Mac OS X, I tried 3 files. The same
happened, trying to write in Applications folder when I am trying to
exit (close the plugin windows).

/Applications folder is system privilege only, sudo user only in Mac
OS X. It reserve for Applications only, not document or data.

It seems that the contour plugin is also doing the same. The output
directory is also disabled since it is trying to write in
/Applications folder which read only.

MMQGIS plugin shows the default directory as /Application folder when
I am trying to export the attribute table of shapefile.

Any Mac OS users try to replicate this error?

Thanks.

Noli

Replicate the error from someone else and also in different OS.

Do you see the "Browse" button to chose the directory where export the
two files?
I try on colleague Mac and it works, the problem is only on the GUI
that hide the "browse" button, I only resize the windows and I could
set the directory.
See the two images before resize [0] and after [1]
For me the problem is fixed I should only resize the GUI

OK. This is the problem because I did not resize the window.

Yes, It is hidden.

Now, when I resize the windows, the browse button and the directory
textbox are visible now.

I  thought before that the small pane before the "Close" and "OK"
buttons is the directory textbox for use to entry the directory. I am
mistaken.

Resizing the window panel make the directory textbox and browse button!

Luca, thanks a lot for attention on this small glitch of not viewing
the directory textbox and button.

It would probably better to resize the default size of the window pane
so by default we can see the directory textbox and browse button.

Thanks again.

Noli

Hi,

Forwarding this to the qgis-developers list as it belongs there.

It should be easy to parse simple PAC files like this one

function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
   {
      return "PROXY proxy.example.com:8080; DIRECT";
   }

however more simple files would require a parser, and the one listed
on the wikipedia page (pacparser) is GPLv3 so it might not be possible
to include them inside qgis or even link against them (which would
require an extra dependence I`m not sure mote people will install).

Another note, qgis uses gdal which has its own proxy mechanism, is
this good or bad or interoperability?ienne

I am using classic.

I checked changing the theme into GIS, still the same problem. The
directory textbox and browse button are hidden. It need to lenghten
the height of the window pane to show directory textbox and browse
button.

Hi all,

I've moved the QgsMessageBar class to the GUI library (so it
can be reused), then I pushed everything to master.

Best regards.

i see that a qml style created in qgis master 1.9 is not recognised by qgis
1.8.
editing qml file i see:

!DOCTYPE qgis PUBLIC 'http://mrcc.com/qgis.dtd' 'SYSTEM'>
<qgis version="1.9.0-Master" 
....
....

is this the reason why 1.9 qml are not available for qgis 1.9?

(not a developer)
Assuming you mean "not available for qgis 1.8?", then I could imagine quite a few reasons. Starting with some quite wonderful and radical reworking of the available Style options.

Remember 1.9 is essentially pre-2.0 and the developers have permission to break the old API ways and use the new ones. There should be some large differences between 1.8 and 1.9 develop. This means that I'm not expecting 1.8 to be able to read 1.9 files.

What you're asking is nice but can't be relied on to happen. For example, there were things that meant 1.7 project files didn't always open in 1.6.
(I would, however hope that 1.8 specific files can continue to be opened in 1.9/2.0!)

Just a few bobs worth.

-ramon.
