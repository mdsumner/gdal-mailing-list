Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Changelog descriptions for Scenes
Message-ID: <CAES-DZRRsKoHmtUwjVPTVLCwQ8xpfxzbA3Kk8xeiMraLMOB83g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Martin / Nyall - I noticed we don't have anything in the 3.34 changelog (
https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.34) for the new 3D scenes,
adding Cesium / Google 3d tiles. I think most users won't even realise this
cool new functionality is there. Could you share some content for us to add
to the changelog (and for Selma to add to the user manual)?

Thanks!

Tim

Hello,

I sent this email earlier last month: https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2023-October/066168.html

and i never got a reply to it.

Is it possible to at least redirect me to the right mailing list or community to ask my question?

Thank you for your help.

Hi Rhea,

I am in no way able to officially answer but maybe I can give some 
thoughts and rhetoric questions:

To me those improvements sound like good ideas. I am not sure how far 
you could lock down Python extensibility considering the existing API. 
And I am not sure if you are aware of the many ways that a QGIS 
environment might use network calls, e.g. a tool like Proj might 
download grids from the internet in some cases, GDAL might try to fetch 
schemas specified in local files, etc. Sandboxing the system from the 
outside is probably much easier and secure.

Are those 40 extensions existing extensions? Are you aware that you can 
strip out the official repository and use your own instead?

It would probably be best to create QGIS Enhancement Proposals at 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues.

And it would be good to proof commitment to maintaining the new features 
in some way or enter the sustaining membership program with significant, 
recurring contributions so that other developers paid by the QGIS 
project can maintain them.

Cheers, Hannes

If you have in mind to limit the set of functionality available in the 
Python console, that's not technically doable, at least with the CPython 
interpreter. All you can do is to not provide any access at all to the 
Python console. Python isn't a "safe" language, that is a sufficiently 
willing user can do arbitrary things, including crashing itself with 
just core functionality:

$ python -c "exec(type((lambda: 0).__code__)(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, b'\x053', 
(), (), (), '', '', 0, b''))"
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

cf 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42544487/how-can-i-cause-python-3-5-to-crash

People have tried sandboxing Python many times, but under careful 
examinations, all attempts fail at some point.

Hi Rhea,

same as Johannes "I am in no way able to officially answer but maybe I 
can give some thoughts and rhetoric questions":

* QGIS is not designed to handle such security restrictions, it is not 
its purpose

* the best way, IMHO, is to limit its network accesses by using 
dedicated security software as selinux for linux or advanced firewall 
configuration for windows

* the best to discuss these features is "to create QGIS Enhancement 
Proposals at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues."

Regards.

Hi Rhea,
Adding some points to the very good answers above.

QGIS is already deployed in very security sensitive organizations and has
been assessed against vulnerabilities. I obviously can't list them publicly
here. Some are public, like the NSA, that even publishes some plugins, but
also funded some parts of the authentication system.

Its desktop component stays however a generic desktop tool, and as such
will be able to interact with the OS it is installed on. Just like blender
or FME or Arcxx that also have python scripting.
I have seen deployment in sanboxes through virtualization tools that can
help too. Like QGIS served through web streaming or as a remote app (
VMware stuff or vnc or similar stuff)

There are several ways of addressing your concerns in QGIS itself.  Most
will rely on creating a specific configuration for your organisation. You
will be able to deploy a preconfigured QGIS that can almost handle all this

 A few examples

- configure QGIS with a dedicated user agent name and have the IT team
filter the trafic they allow using their firewall
- audit the plugins you will use and ship them with your install packages,
or deploy an internal repository
- use the awesome "constrained settings" script funded by a french ministry
to prevent users from drifting away from this configuration
- you can customize the UI so that average user just can't launch the
python console. Any advanced user will be able to circumvent this, but it's
a good start.
-if you are really into security, don't focus on your customer's fears, but
on the real criticity of a GIS infrastructure.  Securing the data source
connections, configuring mandatory encrypted keyrings is often the weakest
part. Python scripting capabilities us present in most software.and must be
secured by the OS and the IT. You can secure QGIS and have user send QGIS
projects by mail with plain text credentials if you don't handle this. This
should fear your customer more than potential python scripts.


Another point. I have seen over constrained QGIS based deployments for
"security reasons" .  They showed  up some side effects:
- user were too constrained, when GIS work supposes to be able to handle
quite complex tools (SQL queries, cli tools, heavy geospatial computing).
They were so locked that they ended up in really trying shadow IT
solutions.
- the configuration work was too heavy and done as a one time project.  the
IT department could not follow the security updates of QGIS and it's
dependencies , leading to severely outdated software in production.
Security is also a matter of being able to update frequently to fix
vulnerabilities, which we offer in every monthly release.


I've conducted a few of such enterprise wide deployment and I confirm you
that you can find professional support in the commercial companies that
provides such services. You can find them listed on our website.
(Disclaimer, I have no direct interest here and speak as a steering
committee member)

Best regards , and let us know how it goes

 onto QGIS
Message-ID: <CACM4KD5pjW8nuAdDA0b2xVJ9LyZAv_pBxWj5e3tdyYK6NfgVWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I would like a feature within QGIS so that when files with ".xyz" extension
are dragged onto the application, would make my plugin to open
automatically.
This can prevent the user from having to go to the File menu and open the
file.

This is similar to when shapefiles are dragged onto QGIS, and the
shapefiles are automatically loaded and displayed in QGIS.
Except, dragging a file with a ".xyz" extension should result in my plugin
(a dialog box from then plugin) to open.

Is there a setting I can configure?

Yours sincerely,

Hi

We are aware of the issue - it seems some models were lost too :-( We will
try to get it resolved as best we can (including contacting original
authors where needed) over the next week or two.

My apologies for the inconvenience.

Regards

Tim

You can use an eventfilter. You can find an example here
https://github.com/opengisch/QgisModelBaker/blob/master/QgisModelBaker/qgismodelbaker.py#L507C7-L552

However, it may be appropriate to have a setting for this. In the plugin
mentioned above, the user is asked if they want to open this type of file
always with this plugin in the future.

Cheers

A better approach would be a QgsCustomDropHandler. See

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Removing __author__ , __date__,
 __copyright__ from python files?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgQxM5htGu7phO8Q1oUmZU4Z2=kpfLQdEHq=V+NirxotA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey list,

I'd like to propose that we remove all the __author__ , __date__ and
__copyright__ strings from the python files in our repository.

My thinking:

- This isn't an official Python style standard or universally recommended
approach. It *is* used elsewhere, but there's an equally large group which
consider it just unnecessary noise.
- It's misleading, and presents the incorrect impression that a single
person is responsible for the code in that file. That's 100% NOT the case
with QGIS.
- It's all redundant. This information is available in a MUCH more accurate
form via git history.

Are there any objections to removing this?

(For completeness: In a follow up proposal I'm going to suggest removing
ALL the "Date: / Copyright: / Email: " strings from our file headers, for
the same reasons).

Nyall

Please also remove __revision__ which changes the commit hash in every 
release tarball without any changes to the file content cluttering the 
diff which needs to be reviewed for license & copyright changes.

Kind Regards,

Hi Tim!

I've submitted a PR adding this at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/1197 .

I can't work out how to embed a video for the item though... it needs to
have the video at https://youtu.be/lvl8zVZ8glY attached. Any ideas?

Hi Nyall,

I have no objections to remove the __revision__ and __email__ and to
move remaining information to a comment instead of using the __param__
format but I am strongly against removing "author" and "date"
information altogether, especially from the C++ files.

I find it useful to quickly remind me about the origin of that part of
the code and honestly I like the fact that people who initially spent
time on that (even if they do not contribute anymore or their code was
almost totally rewritten) is mentioned and remembered in the headers
"forever".

Kind regards.

Hi devs,

Today's pyqgis docs for 3.34 didn't make it, and indeed, watching [0] reveals that the build somehow failed yesterday and there was no attempt to rebuild today. Likewise the latest version of 3.34 in docker hub [1] is from yesterday instead of a few hours ago.

Hi Harissou,

3.34 finally made it and the docs are building right now.

As mentioned in the QEP for the Docker strategy, I will soon transfer the
OPENGIS.ch repo to QGIS.org and switch the PyQGIS builds to rely on the
debian packages. This should smoothen the process.

Cheers,
Denis

Looking at the records (still) pointing to qgis2 (old web server), we found

stripe.qgis.org
and
planet.qgis.org

We think(!) that those are not used anymore.
Are we right?
(is donate.qgis.org superseeding the stripe.qgis.org?)
(planet is gone?)
Can I remove these records from the DNS?

Anybody busy with http://test.qgis.org/?
Because the last use/build of the tests there are from januari too

Hi,

one of our previous PRs has been labeled: 'ChangeLog' then after a

Can you put the harvest date in future qgis-bot messages so we can plan?

Dear developers,

I was wondering of there is a QGIS equivalent of Turf's nearest point
function?
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turf/nearest-point

The function takes a reference point and a FeatureCollection of Features
with Point geometries and returns the point from the FeatureCollection
closest to the reference.

Not that exact function that I am aware of but there is a *Distance to
nearest hub (points) *tool in the processing toolbox that will give you the
distance to all of the points and then you can choose the one with the
shortest distance. You could also use select by expression using the *Closest
Point *function.

Message-ID: <CAES-DZReOp9YJcDsiZBJiuAO7EbivKH1AUF8WK8fwD+1TnkW+w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Developers and Interested Lookers On!


As you are hopefully aware, the PSC has allocated funds to help us get our
new website made, awesome and deployed.  We ran an open call[1]  for
interested parties to apply, which was published on the blog and on the
QGIS News Feed. During our PSC meeting on November 7, the PSC agreed to
appoint Kontur [2] to carry out this work.

They will no doubt be in communication with you all as they progress with
their work. I just wanted to extend the invitation to anyone who wants to
collaborate with the Kontur team, or even just follow along with the work
they are doing, to join the Matrix room which we have set up for this
purpose.

Best regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Future of OTB provider plugin?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsirMALGshYBpJz5bYN54bY7ELukQ9ZLcppd_y1hND8ysw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I'd like to kick start some discussions about the future of the official
OTB Processing Provider plugin which comes pre-installed with QGIS.

As you may or may not be aware of, the Processing maintainers have been on
a multi-year quest to slim down the core set of out-of-the-box providers.
The biggest consequences of these have been the demotion of the Processing
R Providers and SAGA providers to 3rd party, community maintained plugins.

The main motivations behind this are:

- Making sure that all the out of the box tools "just work" consistently
across different platforms, without requiring users to install additional
software.
- Easing the maintenance burden on the core QGIS team -- by moving these
plugins to community maintained repositories, we lower the barrier of entry
for contributors to these plugins.
- Avoiding issues with "tight coupling" of 3rd party tools to QGIS
versions. This was especially the case with the SAGA provider, where it
proved impossible to keep a stable plugin which worked consistently across
the range of SAGA versions installable on different platforms. (The 3rd
party SAGA NG plugin avoids this by ALWAYS targeting the most recent SAGA
version, and leaving it as the user's responsibility for installing this
version. We didn't have the same flexibility when the SAGA provider was a
core part of QGIS).

I'd like to now focus on the out-of-the-box OTB Processing provider, and
personally I would like to see this one demoted to a community maintained
plugin.

My reasons are:
1. The provider has not seen development efforts outside of "keep this
running only" by the usual QGIS committers. I would hope to see the same
results as we saw with the R and SAGA plugins where moving to community
maintained plugins increases the number of outside contributions.
2. OTB requires a separate installation outside of QGIS, and isn't easily
available on many supported QGIS platforms (eg there's no Fedora package).
 3. The OTB installer does some weird thing in the QGIS ci environment,
which make me nervous:

kernel bug by creating a hole of 20480 bytes in
?./lib/libQt5Core.so.5.10.1?

So... what does everyone else think? Can we safely demote OTB to a 3rd
party plugin and remove it for QGIS 3.36?

Dear Sebastian,

Thank you so much. I was just wondering if this tool can be called using
Python from within QGIS.

I am trying to write a Python equivalent of the following JavaScript block
of code.
nearestPoint = turf.nearestPoint(currentFeature, entire_dataset)

Yours sincerely,
Pankaj

Just to remind that most of the Processing developers were against its
inclusion in the core back in 2018 and predicted that it won't be
maintained and eventually will be removed.

Said that, a huge +1 from me.

Hi,

+1 for me too, I think it would ease development of the plugin and would lower the pain of managing compatibility between QGIS and OTB.

I opened an issue on their GitLab platform to raise awareness of this
proposal https://gitlab.orfeo-toolbox.org/orfeotoolbox/otb/-/issues/2365

Regards,
Julien

Honestly I wasn't even aware that it was still there and I don't recall any
complaints that it was not working (or that OTB was removed/missing in OSGeo4W
or Debian, which is probably why nobody noticed, if it doesn't).

Thanks Julien!

Would you be interested in potentially adopting the community plugin?

Hello,
I updated my plugin and it is approved.
It's updated in plugin repository but in QGIS it is not updated.

I checked and in "*https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/raster_divider
<https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/raster_divider>*" it is updated(1.3) but
in "*https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.28
<https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.28>*" old version(1.2)
still remains. Name of plugin is "*Raster Divider*"

The last-modified header reports: "Fri, 10 Nov 2023 15:11:52 GMT".
It looks like also various other (recently updated) plugins version are 
not included in plugins.xml.

Moreover it seems there are some weirdnesses: e.g., "Kartverket 
adresse-API" plugin latest version 1.1 has been uploaded on 7 nov 2023, 
20:57 CET but it results not updated in plugin.xml, while "H-RISK with 
noisemodelling" plugin latest version 0.1.7 has been uploaded on 8 nov 
2023, 11:28 CET but it results updated in plugin.xml,
and a.g. the "FLO-2D MapCrafter" uploaded on 8 nov 2023, 14:56 CET 
results missing in plugin.xml

Hi Murat,

Updating can take a bit of time, cause the xml file is cached on the 
server. Try again in 15 or 30 minutes.

Message-ID: <CAO7kFnFgR19x221Vg2bz9FpdRd6qJCLX4pXE5b1RHQivCv7MiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I would install python libraries when the plugin that I'm developing Is
installed.
I read something about the possibility to list the required libraries in
the metadati.txt but I don't think there Is not an installer already
available in QGIS for the libraries, Am I correct? Is there any way to do
so? Has someone a code example for a solution?
I'm trying to run a subprocess to install libraries via PIP but I think It
Is not the proper way to do so.
Thanks
Best

Giacomo

Message-ID: <CAB28AsinfJ31H54M835e=poZJxKid7m9FGfjg2eSXDguCqST2g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi lists,

I've created a new QGIS enhancement proposal at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/278
concerning changes to the inbuilt authentication system / secure storage
support in QGIS.

By its nature, the authentication framework needs to be secure and any
changes to the authentication logic need careful consideration.

Comments and discussion on the github ticket linked above are encouraged!

Kind regards,
Nyall

On QGIS for Mac, only GDAL version 3.3.2 and GEOS 3.9.1 are currently available in the latest QGIS 3.34.0. When can we expect the new GDAL/GEOS versions in the Mac-Package? The reason for my request is that GDAL drivers for newer geo formats (e.g. geoparquet) are missing and the "Multi Union" plugin does not work because it requires at least GEOS 3.10.

 Thanks in advance! Best regards, mikeE.

Hi all.

I'm working on this issue.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Mac-Packager/pull/168
I have some trouble about Qt.
qt-5.15.2.tar.gz may fail my all build on Sonoma.
Currently I try to build new qt5 but it is not success now.

However you can try anaconda's QGIS.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/54979
I'm not try it but it may useful.

The reason for my request is that GDAL drivers for newer geo formats (e.g. geoparquet) are missing and the "Multi Union" plugin does not work because it requires at least GEOS 3.10.

Hello,

These QGIS features need to be invoked manually, and I was hoping that
these functions (or a similar one) could somehow be called using a Python
script from within QGIS. Maybe someone with knowledge of QGIS internal
functions can give advice on how these functions can be called.

Yours sincerely,
Pankaj

Hello everyone,

This week (and last week at the OSGeo meeting Vienna) I was working on
documentation for 3D Tiles in QGIS. I used blog posts from Lutra Consulting
and North Road websites as the main source for the documentation, also I
followed video tutorials and Martin Dobias explained 3D tiles to me while
we were in Vienna. I'm planning to create a draft version in my GitHub
repository (I will send you a link) so you can check it out. This is my
first time creating a whole new chapter for documentation so I'm trying to
be as detailed as possible. I also prepared screenshots for other chapters
updates related to 3D tiles/Scene (browser, data source management etc.).

PR from this week:
Vector tiles properties
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8639>
In this PR I updated chapter with Source and Rendering properties, but I
wasn't able to recreate OpenStreetMap landuse layer with all rules (like
image that is in the docs now), so if someone has advice on how to do that,
please let me know. I was using tiles from https://cloud.maptiler.com/tiles/
.

Have a nice weekend,
Selma.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Embedded styling in some datatypes
Message-ID: <6f86fb54-c092-4d6e-993c-0253151e59b2@gmail.com>

Hi list -

I'm wondering about how to use embedded styling in certain types of file 
formats (like MapInfo Tab). I know its possible to read the embedded 
styling from a Tab fil and then convert it to a styling object in QGIS.

However, what about the other direction ? Take a specific QGIS style 
from the layer styling of a tab file, and and write the specific style 
into the feature, so it will be present if you later open the tab file 
in (gasp!) MapIno ?

The use case would be organisations that have a mixed environment of 
QGIS and MapInfo installations. It would allow QGIS users to create and 
update object in a .tab file and save the file. Later this file - if 
opened in MapInfo (or QGIS) - would be shown with the correct embedded 
styling.

Hi list -

I apologize for the cross-posting to this mailing list from qgis-user. 
But I hope, that somebody has the answers to the questions...

I have a couple of (probably dumb) questions on how to use the 
"QgsProcessingAlgorithm" class.

  * A have a lot parameter inputs placed in the "advanced" section af
    the processing input dialog. It's parameters that seldom has to be
    changed.
    How do I present the "Avanced" section /not/ unfolded? The default
    is to unfold this section and thus possibly confuse users by showing
    a lot of seldom changed parameters.

  * One of my input parameters is a "QgsProcessingParameterString"
    parameter that will contain a password.
    Can I obfuscate the parameter input, i.e showing '*******' instead
    of the password ?

  * the "QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource" method creates a drop-down
    with names of layers in the map /and/ a checkbox with the label
    "Selected features only". Is it possible to set the checkmark
    automatically when showing the processing userdialog ? And how ??

        print(str(provider.extent()))
        file_writer.writeRaster(
            pipe,

            provider.ySize(),
            provider.extent(),

I don't find anything about that, any idea ?

Dear QGIS developers,
I published https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/svir/version/3.17.4/ on
November 6, but I see it is still not approved. Probably it was
accidentally missed.
Please, may you check it?
Thanks very much,
Paolo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] inf and nan in reclassify algo
Message-ID: <CAED_52o6bz2Wvrev-45T9BY+y0dcQtDQ1UMA3RTKCA1-WVFewg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I recently discovered by trying likely things that I can use inf, -inf, and
nan in the reclassify algo.
Not being a programmer it wasn't obvious that these would be valid inputs.
I would like to document this.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8653

>From my research it seems like these are inherent special values in the
floating point format in C++.
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types

The inf and -inf seem straightforward to use in the reclassify table as max
and min values and nan seems to work to set a range of values to nodata.

Are there any gotchas I'm missing or any other values that can be used and
should be documented?
Thanks
-Bas

Hi Bo,
Regarding MapInfo, I know the french ministry of environment has tried
something like this years ago.
It was an attempt to handle the transition period between M and Q.

But honestly the style specifications of each proprietary format are really
hard to interoperate. This leads to partially compatible styles, and data
loss.

SLD was a promise to have a common standard but I think all the developers
that tried to implement conversion utilities have been having hard days.
Maybe except for Slyr by Nyall.

Data can be shared across systems. But styles can be shared with very
limited support and this somewhat negates the work of talented
cartographers.

Hello Lova,

I cross post my comment to this issue 
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/38#issuecomment-1824010198> 
related to the PR mentioned below as "Make LICENSE file as required in 
plugin package <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/309>", because 
I did not have any answer there but saw that some changes still have 
been applied without any comment.

While trying to publish or update a plugin, we faced the new error 
message related to the deployment of this PR 
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/309>:

 > Fault string: <Fault 1: 'File upload must be a valid QGIS Python 
plugin compressed archive. Cannot find LICENSE in plugin package.'>

See downstream issue on qgis-plugin-ci project (disclaimer: I'm one of 
the mainteners but speaking on my own here): 
https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-plugin-ci/issues/255

I think this kind of change, which breaks the plugins'publication flow, 
should be discussed before to be implemented (an issue from 1 person 
seems to be too light to decide without any discussion), announced to 
the community, a warning campaign should be run and a transitional phase 
should be implemented (warning for 6 months, then error). This has a 
direct impact on hundreds (thousands?) of plugin developers on a 
community project with several million end users.

I understand that this process may seem too cumbersome, and that since 
the QGIS Django project hasn't been so dynamic for a few years, it's 
nice to see it get a new lease of life, even if it means merging and 
deploying on an ongoing basis.

As for the underlying principle, I'm generally in favor of strengthening 
the control mechanisms (automatic or otherwise) for extensions on the 
official repository, but I think it's really important to do this 
gradually, or at least to avoid unilateral change "descended from the 
skies of the developers".

Concerning the idea of integrating the license in the plugin package, 
I'm not really convinced of the interest since most plugins are 
contaminated by the GPL2+ of QGIS <-- Qt and the license is never 
displayed to the end user. But why not. After all, it's always a good 
practice to include licence and spread the word about (re)usage rules.

Reverting sounds maybe too rought so I suggest modyfing the behavior to 
lower the level and make it a simple warning and in the meanwhile 
starting a communication and preventive work upstream:

 1. update documentation:
    https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins/plugins.html
 2. communicate on the QGIS Dev list **before** the implementation to
    discuss the rationale
 3. integrate a warning mechanism
 4. manage the QGIS versions concerned (only applicable to new QGIS
    released versions after this being merged)

A last question: did you have some pre-production environment where to 
deploy new changes in order to evaluate them before publishing widely? 
Or some versioning logic, milestone workflow where PRs are grouped 
before being deployed?

Regards,
Julien

Dear Julien,

Many thanks for your feedback.

In the new PR, the license file is only required for new plugins. For existing plugin updates, it generates just a warning (but doesn't fail) when the license file is missing.
However, I'm not sure if we should also just generate a warning for new plugin uploads for now. If so, I will also fix the new plugin upload.

Kind regards.

Subject: Re: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Full Stack Web Developer Report

Hello Lova,

I cross post my comment to this issue<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/38#issuecomment-1824010198> related to the PR mentioned below as "Make LICENSE file as required in plugin package<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/309>", because I did not have any answer there but saw that some changes still have been applied without any comment.

While trying to publish or update a plugin, we faced the new error message related to the deployment of this PR<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/309>:

> Fault string: <Fault 1: 'File upload must be a valid QGIS Python plugin compressed archive. Cannot find LICENSE in plugin package.'>

See downstream issue on qgis-plugin-ci project (disclaimer: I'm one of the mainteners but speaking on my own here): https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-plugin-ci/issues/255

I think this kind of change, which breaks the plugins'publication flow, should be discussed before to be implemented (an issue from 1 person seems to be too light to decide without any discussion), announced to the community, a warning campaign should be run and a transitional phase should be implemented (warning for 6 months, then error). This has a direct impact on hundreds (thousands?) of plugin developers on a community project with several million end users.

I understand that this process may seem too cumbersome, and that since the QGIS Django project hasn't been so dynamic for a few years, it's nice to see it get a new lease of life, even if it means merging and deploying on an ongoing basis.

As for the underlying principle, I'm generally in favor of strengthening the control mechanisms (automatic or otherwise) for extensions on the official repository, but I think it's really important to do this gradually, or at least to avoid unilateral change "descended from the skies of the developers".

Concerning the idea of integrating the license in the plugin package, I'm not really convinced of the interest since most plugins are contaminated by the GPL2+ of QGIS <-- Qt and the license is never displayed to the end user. But why not. After all, it's always a good practice to include licence and spread the word about (re)usage rules.

Reverting sounds maybe too rought so I suggest modyfing the behavior to lower the level and make it a simple warning and in the meanwhile starting a communication and preventive work upstream:

  1.  update documentation: https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins/plugins.html
  2.  communicate on the QGIS Dev list **before** the implementation to discuss the rationale
  3.  integrate a warning mechanism
  4.  manage the QGIS versions concerned (only applicable to new QGIS released versions after this being merged)

A last question: did you have some pre-production environment where to deploy new changes in order to evaluate them before publishing widely? Or some versioning logic, milestone workflow where PRs are grouped before being deployed?

Regards,
Julien

Thanks for your quick reply here Lova,

I've no special legibility that my opinion would be greater than yours, 
so I can't tell if it has to be reverted or not. That's why I ask for 
discussion before deploying some breaking change, without any warning or 
information. After having looked to others PR, I would like to see more 
description about what a PR does exactly, especially when it breaks 
something.

In this case, even after the last PR, this is a breaking and 
undocumented change. For now, a plugin developer has no way to see that 
a LICENSE file is now required in its plugin's zip. An error message in 
a log is not a suitable information, even it's well formulated and 
clear, especially in the era of automated CI/CD deployments.

Regards,
Julien

Dear Julien,

That?s well noted. Thank you.
I will add a detailed description in each PR in the future.
Regarding the issue of LICENSE file requirements, I totally agree with you. I will also ask Tim if he has suggestions about it.

Best regards,
Lova

Subject: Re: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Full Stack Web Developer Report

Thanks for your quick reply here Lova,

I've no special legibility that my opinion would be greater than yours, so I can't tell if it has to be reverted or not. That's why I ask for discussion before deploying some breaking change, without any warning or information. After having looked to others PR, I would like to see more description about what a PR does exactly, especially when it breaks something.

In this case, even after the last PR, this is a breaking and undocumented change. For now, a plugin developer has no way to see that a LICENSE file is now required in its plugin's zip. An error message in a log is not a suitable information, even it's well formulated and clear, especially in the era of automated CI/CD deployments.

Regards,
Julien

Dear Julien,

Many thanks for your feedback.

In the new PR, the license file is only required for new plugins. For existing plugin updates, it generates just a warning (but doesn't fail) when the license file is missing.
However, I'm not sure if we should also just generate a warning for new plugin uploads for now. If so, I will also fix the new plugin upload.

Kind regards.

Subject: Re: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Full Stack Web Developer Report

Hello Lova,

I cross post my comment to this issue<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/38#issuecomment-1824010198> related to the PR mentioned below as "Make LICENSE file as required in plugin package<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/309>", because I did not have any answer there but saw that some changes still have been applied without any comment.

While trying to publish or update a plugin, we faced the new error message related to the deployment of this PR<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/309>:

> Fault string: <Fault 1: 'File upload must be a valid QGIS Python plugin compressed archive. Cannot find LICENSE in plugin package.'>

See downstream issue on qgis-plugin-ci project (disclaimer: I'm one of the mainteners but speaking on my own here): https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-plugin-ci/issues/255

I think this kind of change, which breaks the plugins'publication flow, should be discussed before to be implemented (an issue from 1 person seems to be too light to decide without any discussion), announced to the community, a warning campaign should be run and a transitional phase should be implemented (warning for 6 months, then error). This has a direct impact on hundreds (thousands?) of plugin developers on a community project with several million end users.

I understand that this process may seem too cumbersome, and that since the QGIS Django project hasn't been so dynamic for a few years, it's nice to see it get a new lease of life, even if it means merging and deploying on an ongoing basis.

As for the underlying principle, I'm generally in favor of strengthening the control mechanisms (automatic or otherwise) for extensions on the official repository, but I think it's really important to do this gradually, or at least to avoid unilateral change "descended from the skies of the developers".

Concerning the idea of integrating the license in the plugin package, I'm not really convinced of the interest since most plugins are contaminated by the GPL2+ of QGIS <-- Qt and the license is never displayed to the end user. But why not. After all, it's always a good practice to include licence and spread the word about (re)usage rules.

Reverting sounds maybe too rought so I suggest modyfing the behavior to lower the level and make it a simple warning and in the meanwhile starting a communication and preventive work upstream:

  1.  update documentation: https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins/plugins.html
  2.  communicate on the QGIS Dev list **before** the implementation to discuss the rationale
  3.  integrate a warning mechanism
  4.  manage the QGIS versions concerned (only applicable to new QGIS released versions after this being merged)

A last question: did you have some pre-production environment where to deploy new changes in order to evaluate them before publishing widely? Or some versioning logic, milestone workflow where PRs are grouped before being deployed?

Regards,
Julien

Dear Julien

Thank you so much for your engagement and suggestions. Fully agreed that
breaking changes should be well communicated first. So splitting the
discussion in two:


1) License requirements: for now I have chatted with Lova and we propose:

a) Change the logic such that a license is required for newly registered
plugins
b) When updates are made to existing plugins that do not include a license,
the uploader will be shown a warning indicating that in future the license
will  be mandatory

This is already implemented in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/311
and I propose we deploy this today / ASAP to address the previously raised
issues.

2) Change management:

Yes I think we can introduce more rigour in the process.

* breaking changes: discuss with the community first, implement, deploy in
a known time window
* non-breaking changes: for simple bug fixes, just fix, test and deploy as
needed
* non-breaking changes: for features etc. these will be managed on the
project board here, anyone who wants to be engaged in the process can see
the planned upcomming work and interact with Lova via the ticket queue.
https://github.com/orgs/qgis/projects/6
* requests to improvements: please file tickets here
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues

Regarding a staging site, currently we do not run a staging environment,
developers have local test environments and I am on the fence as to whether
there is a lot of value in us maintaining a long running staging site.

Regards

Tim

Dear Tim,

Thanks for taking in account my thoughts and make the discussion possible.

Regarding the second about change management, I totally agree and feel 
really thankful that you make those changes. I can imagine the work it 
represents for your teams maintaining a project like this one. So thank 
you again.

Regarding your proposal about the license requirements, why not starting 
apply the change management to this? It's a breaking change, even for 
new plugins, right? So, it should be lowered to a non blocking warning, 
documented in PyQGIS cookbook and then deployed as a blocking error in a 
known time windows. This way, in the meanwhile, the plugins ecosystem 
can adapt to new rules (new versions for tools like minimal plugin, 
qgis-plugin-ci, plugin builder...) and make this change more acceptable 
and frictionless.

Moreover, the rationale behind the required license file into the plugin 
archive is still not solved.

If you want, I can make a PR to change the warning but I'm pretty sure 
that's not the question here.

Just to let you know this hyperlink leads to a 404 (probably a Github 
rights access setting somewhere).

This behavior seems to be controlled on the user side and is sticky. In my QGIS
install, when I collapse the 'Advanced' section in an algorithm, all subsequent
algorithms have that section collapsed.? There must be a setting that you
can?probably toggle via PyQGIS. Maybe someone else here knows.

This is generally discouraged in favor of using the Auth manager. Could you
store the password there and retrieve it in your script??

I don't think this is possible. As a workaround, if you always want to use
selected features when available, you can use QgsProcessingParameterVectorLayer
input instead, check if there are selected layers when processing it and get
only selected features.

Hi all,

Merged PR from this week:

   - Vector tiles update
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8639>

Open PR:

   - 3d tiles <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8657> - so,
   here I need to additionally describe properties (symbology, 3d view,
   elevation menu), also the second section now is called *Scene, *but I
   believe this will be changed. I'm looking forward to your feedback
   (review).

Still working on:

   - geometry expressions
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/8547>

Have a nice weekend,
Selma.

Hi,

Thank you very much Lova for working on this application, it's a very
important piece in the QGIS ecosystem!

For the current discussion, I would also suggest making the license
recommended for now and only start enforcing it on a schedule. And I was
wondering if a license field in the metadata.txt would be even better (cmp.
https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#license), that would be easier to
show on the plugin page?

Is there any way to help prioritizing the issues? I have some wishes that I
would love to see land on the backlog

Kind regards and thanks again for all the good work on this !
Matthias

@Matthias Kuhn <matthias at opengis.ch> and @Julien Moura
<julien.moura at oslandia.com> I fixed the permissions, the board for Lova is
public now. Please feel free to add items to the backlog and mark them as
priority as needed.  I also asked Lova to try to work through all the old
issues and fix / close them as appropriate so we can try to get the number
of tickets down to a small number.

Regards

Tim

There's an option in the right-click, Export - Save Features As dialog for
"Symbology Export". This only shows up for some formats (depending on GDAL
library support for that format), of which Mapinfo TAB is one. If you set
this to anything other than "No Symbology" then ********** IN SOME CASES
********** the QGIS symbology will be written as the embedded symbols for
the features.

The big disclaimer is that the GDAL api for embedding styles, AND the
underlying format support is very limited compared with QGIS symbology
options. Eg it'll work for embedding colored line symbols, but won't for
shapeburst gradient fill polygons with data defined overrides ?!

There's likely many ways we could improve this at both the QGIS and GDAL
levels to better handle the full range of symbology options possible in TAB
files, and adding more graceful fallbacks from QGIS symbology to the
limited symbology options possible in GDAL/TAB.

FWIW, symbology can be converted from ArcMap -> QGIS almost completely
losslessly. And from ArcGIS Pro -> QGIS at ?95% losslessly.  And then from
QGIS -> ArcGIS Pro at ? 50%. We've well overtaken Arc in what's possible in
map symbology in recent years. ?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS grant report: Improve test result handling on
 QGIS CI
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjA_ZEYmKyXWiDwT-wTEJ2iOgFyB-b9WeWNGf+NXnLWSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi PSC,

I'm happy to announce that this grant is now complete!

While the original proposal was explicitly stated to be a research project
with no guarantees of success, the end result is predominantly a success
(with some limitations!)

You can see the new failure handling in action in this PR:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/55417#issuecomment-1826995755

What we have now is that any tests which fail a rendering comparison will
write a descriptive comment to the PR, as shown in the above link. The
comment details which render tests failed, where they are in the code, and
includes some helpful pointers to downloading the full test report and the
QGIS developer documentation.

Originally, I hoped to link directly to the full test report or include it
as an attachment to the comment. Unfortunately this is NOT possible given
the current Github API. There's a bunch of notes I've added to the initial
comment in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/54906 which link to the
limitations / feature requests on Github's side, so we can monitor the
situation and further improve the reports if/when Github add this
functionality.

As well as the above described improvements on the CI side, I've also
implemented lots of improvements in running the tests locally and how the
render test reports are generated and presented to developers!

Thanks for making this possible!

Nyall

Hi Nyall,

good news, thank you for this improvement!

Just a quick question, in the linked PR:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/55417#issuecomment-1826995755
comment the instructions say:

"The full test report (included comparison of rendered vs expected
images) can be found under the 'Checks' tab - 'QGIS tests',
'Artifacts' section as test-results-5."

But I couldn't find any test-results-5 in the artifacts section, there are only:

Artifacts
build-22.04-qt5.tgz
build-38-qt6.tgz

Cheers.

That's caused by a limitation in GitHub API. We can't retrieve the workflow
run id in an action, so that link will always just point to the most recent
workflow run for the PR.

And in this case I reverted the change causing a test failure, so the most
recent workflow doesn't have the failure report.

Hope that makes sense!

Hi Nyall,

I'm not sure if that's the one you're missing, and you might be aware of it, but there's a run_id field in the https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context.

Thanks so much Nyall and all credit goes to Lova who is doing fantastic
work! What I suggest is that moving forward, Lova uses QEP's too propose
and discuss breaking / major workflow changes on the plugins site. In that
QEP he can address:

* what the change is (link back to ticket in QGIS-Django for example)
* what the impact will be
* proposed roll out time line
etc.

And we can discuss and agree these changes there before he goes ahead with
it. For smaller changes, I suggest he 'just get on with it' - his scrum
board is public and you are all welcome to help prioritise his work.

For the current issue under discussion (license requirements for plugins),
I have asked Lova to make a QEP and synthesize the discussion there, mainly
so he can have a practice run at going through the QEP process, although I
will add my 2c that I like Matthias' simple solution to the problem (adding
license as a line to the metadata.txt). If I understand you right Matthias,
our metadata would then look like this?:

-----------------------------
[general]
name=QGIS Animation Workbench
description=A plugin to let you build animations in QGIS
about=QGIS Animation Bench exists because we wanted to use all the awesome
cartography features in QGIS and make cool, animated maps! QGIS already
includes the Temporal Manager which allows you to produce animations for
time-based data. But what if you want to make animations where you travel
around the map, zooming in and out, and perhaps making features on the map
wiggle and jiggle as the animation progresses? That is what the animation
workbench tries to solve...
version=1.1
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
author=Tim Sutton
email=tim at kartoza.com
repository=https://github.com/timlinux/QGISAnimationPlugin
license=GPLv2
-----------------------------

There is probably another thread to this discussion which is to understand
which license are accepted and which not, but that is a job for another QEP
I guess...!

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

For the workflow, that sounds great, thanks a lot!
I agree only breaking changes should go "the long way" and for simple fixes
and improvements we should just get them done with low overhead.
Going forward with a small QEP for the license sounds very good.
Regarding the metadata, I would suggest we use the ids from
https://spdx.org/licenses/.
So for the usual QGIS plugin case, that would be

    license=GPL-2.0-or-later

On another note, I just added a couple of tickets to the backlog, I am not
able to estimate the size of them, so if they are too complicated, just
don't prioritize them.

Thank you and best regards
Matthias

Hello everyone,

Thank you all. It's truly an honor to work on this project.
I will begin by utilizing QEP to create a QEP that summarizes this discussion and going forward with the suggestion to make the license file recommended for now.

I have reviewed the tickets in the backlog and will evaluate their size. If I come across anything that I don't understand, I will add comments to seek clarification.

Best regards,
Lova

It's really exciting to see all the love and attention that the web and plugin infrastructure is getting as a result! ?

Hello,

Thanks again for the technical work and improving the workflow.

+1 for the lazy consensus on non breaking changes.

Regarding the license topic:

+1 for the metadata field with a spdx license. But take care, it's not 
so easy to a have an exhaustive list. Maybe we should move to the PyPi 
classifiers since plugins are Python packages and there is already a 
work on maintaining a metadata ecosystem, including tooling to check it 
(pip install packaging).

Are we okay with the step back to only a non-blocking warning?

Regards

Dear Julien,

It is a pleasure for me to work on the project.
I?ve created a QEP<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/279> that summarizes this discussion. As suggested, I think we can go forward with the non-blocking warning for now and implement licensing requirements on schedule. I'll be creating a documented PR for this fix shortly.

Best regards,
Lova

Hello everyone,

Thank you all. It's truly an honor to work on this project.
I will begin by utilizing QEP to create a QEP that summarizes this discussion and going forward with the suggestion to make the license file recommended for now.

I have reviewed the tickets in the backlog and will evaluate their size. If I come across anything that I don't understand, I will add comments to seek clarification.

Hi Tim,

For the workflow, that sounds great, thanks a lot!
I agree only breaking changes should go "the long way" and for simple fixes and improvements we should just get them done with low overhead.
Going forward with a small QEP for the license sounds very good.
Regarding the metadata, I would suggest we use the ids from https://spdx.org/licenses/.
So for the usual QGIS plugin case, that would be

    license=GPL-2.0-or-later

On another note, I just added a couple of tickets to the backlog, I am not able to estimate the size of them, so if they are too complicated, just don't prioritize them.

Thank you and best regards
Matthias

Tim/Lova, thanks for your outstanding efforts and commitment here!

It's really exciting to see all the love and attention that the web and plugin infrastructure is getting as a result! ?


Thanks so much Nyall and all credit goes to Lova who is doing fantastic work! What I suggest is that moving forward, Lova uses QEP's too propose and discuss breaking / major workflow changes on the plugins site. In that QEP he can address:

* what the change is (link back to ticket in QGIS-Django for example)
* what the impact will be
* proposed roll out time line
etc.

And we can discuss and agree these changes there before he goes ahead with it. For smaller changes, I suggest he 'just get on with it' - his scrum board is public and you are all welcome to help prioritise his work.

For the current issue under discussion (license requirements for plugins), I have asked Lova to make a QEP and synthesize the discussion there, mainly so he can have a practice run at going through the QEP process, although I will add my 2c that I like Matthias' simple solution to the problem (adding license as a line to the metadata.txt). If I understand you right Matthias, our metadata would then look like this?:

-----------------------------
[general]
name=QGIS Animation Workbench
description=A plugin to let you build animations in QGIS
about=QGIS Animation Bench exists because we wanted to use all the awesome cartography features in QGIS and make cool, animated maps! QGIS already includes the Temporal Manager which allows you to produce animations for time-based data. But what if you want to make animations where you travel around the map, zooming in and out, and perhaps making features on the map wiggle and jiggle as the animation progresses? That is what the animation workbench tries to solve...
version=1.1
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
author=Tim Sutton
email=tim at kartoza.com<mailto:tim at kartoza.com>
repository=https://github.com/timlinux/QGISAnimationPlugin
license=GPLv2
-----------------------------

There is probably another thread to this discussion which is to understand which license are accepted and which not, but that is a job for another QEP I guess...!

Regards

Tim

Hello,

Thanks again for the technical work and improving the workflow.

+1 for the lazy consensus on non breaking changes.

Regarding the license topic:

+1 for the metadata field with a spdx license. But take care, it's not so easy to a have an exhaustive list. Maybe we should move to the PyPi classifiers since plugins are Python packages and there is already a work on maintaining a metadata ecosystem, including tooling to check it (pip install packaging).

Are we okay with the step back to only a non-blocking warning?

Regards

Hello everyone,

Thank you all. It's truly an honor to work on this project.
I will begin by utilizing QEP to create a QEP that summarizes this discussion and going forward with the suggestion to make the license file recommended for now.

I have reviewed the tickets in the backlog and will evaluate their size. If I come across anything that I don't understand, I will add comments to seek clarification.

Best regards,
Lova

Hi Tim,

For the workflow, that sounds great, thanks a lot!
I agree only breaking changes should go "the long way" and for simple fixes and improvements we should just get them done with low overhead.
Going forward with a small QEP for the license sounds very good.
Regarding the metadata, I would suggest we use the ids from https://spdx.org/licenses/.
So for the usual QGIS plugin case, that would be

    license=GPL-2.0-or-later

On another note, I just added a couple of tickets to the backlog, I am not able to estimate the size of them, so if they are too complicated, just don't prioritize them.

Thank you and best regards
Matthias

Tim/Lova, thanks for your outstanding efforts and commitment here!

It's really exciting to see all the love and attention that the web and plugin infrastructure is getting as a result! ?


Thanks so much Nyall and all credit goes to Lova who is doing fantastic work! What I suggest is that moving forward, Lova uses QEP's too propose and discuss breaking / major workflow changes on the plugins site. In that QEP he can address:

* what the change is (link back to ticket in QGIS-Django for example)
* what the impact will be
* proposed roll out time line
etc.

And we can discuss and agree these changes there before he goes ahead with it. For smaller changes, I suggest he 'just get on with it' - his scrum board is public and you are all welcome to help prioritise his work.

For the current issue under discussion (license requirements for plugins), I have asked Lova to make a QEP and synthesize the discussion there, mainly so he can have a practice run at going through the QEP process, although I will add my 2c that I like Matthias' simple solution to the problem (adding license as a line to the metadata.txt). If I understand you right Matthias, our metadata would then look like this?:

-----------------------------
[general]
name=QGIS Animation Workbench
description=A plugin to let you build animations in QGIS
about=QGIS Animation Bench exists because we wanted to use all the awesome cartography features in QGIS and make cool, animated maps! QGIS already includes the Temporal Manager which allows you to produce animations for time-based data. But what if you want to make animations where you travel around the map, zooming in and out, and perhaps making features on the map wiggle and jiggle as the animation progresses? That is what the animation workbench tries to solve...
version=1.1
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
author=Tim Sutton
email=tim at kartoza.com<mailto:tim at kartoza.com>

There is probably another thread to this discussion which is to understand which license are accepted and which not, but that is a job for another QEP I guess...!

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] HTML in plugin's metadata.txt works, but should it?
Message-ID: <516cc3ad-69d0-44c9-9d3a-95d2a2867f0f@wheregroup.com>

Hi!

https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins/plugins.html#metadata-txt 
says for the fields "about", "description" and "changelog": "no HTML 
allowed"

But actually we *can* use some HTML 
(https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/richtext-html-subset.html I assume).
The plugin's information will be nicely rendered at least in QGIS' 
plugin manager.
<img> does not seem to work, it just shows a placeholder. Clicking an 
<a> makes the plugin manager display a white page and open my system's 
web browser with the URL. But other formatting things work well.

Example image: 
https://matrix.osgeo.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.wheregroup.com/nKHOTGcYWWpYqQKNWaSjuFbu/html%20in%20metadata.txt.png

It would be super useful for me in a non-public plugin so I wonder:

- Does "no HTML allowed" refer to the display in the official plugin 
repository https://plugins.qgis.org only?
- Is it a bug that we can use some HTML in those fields or can we rely 
on it for the future?

I am a bit torn between "oh yay, we can add some more detailed 
information in a nicely formatted way" and "oh dear lord this might lead 
to complex chaos in plugin descriptions".

Cheers, Hannes

HI Johannes,

digging into very old memories here, IIRC when I wrote that metadata
docs I was mainly worried about displaying the plugin metadata.txt ini
file information in the plugin website, that's why I thought it was
wise to ban HTML formatting.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Paste geometry functionality
Message-ID: <CA+f=8=pCF8OX2hJudDJksgB_srYsFb_Qo_9qAX_01YzVCtGBCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

  I was wondering, is there any reason why "paste geometry" (for
vector features) is not implemented in QGIS? Or is it simply because
nobody implemented it (I'm thinking of trying to do that)?

  The use case is different government cadastres where geometry is
provided by external institutions and institution responsible for
maintaining the cadastre is adding the attribute values. While they
can use full feature paste (with attributes) for initial record
creation, updating requires the possibility to paste geometry only
without changing any attribute values.

  Thank you

P.S. I am aware of a python plugin for that but it does not work for
large geometries as clipboard size limit is reached pretty fast on
windows.

Hi Tomas,

copy-paste geometric features is implemented for years now, and copying 
to a spreadsheet or text file also.

There is a setting if you don't want the geometry to be pasted as a WKT 
column in text/ spreadsheet format.

The behavior of attribute forms can also be tuned by options regarding 
the attribute of newly created features

Can you be more precise on your use case scenario ?

Regards

R?gis

  Let's say we have a layer L (PostgreSQL/PostGIS) with features A, B
and C with corresponding attribute values set.
  Now some external party sends us a shapefile S with an updated
geometry G which we want to apply to feature B.

  We want to:
  1. Select G in layer S and press Ctrl+C
  2. Select feature B in layer L (layer is in edit mode).
  3. Do "Paste geometry" which should change geometry of feature B but
leave all attribute values intact. This must be an update (not
delete/insert) operation for record B in database table, as database
would usually have different sequences, triggers with business logic
etc.

Oh I get it now, you want to change in place the geometry of a select 
object. I tend to use spatial SQL myself for this kind of stuff as it 
starts to sound like spatial analysis. You can also use the 
geoprocessing toolbox with the "edit in place" flag. But that would not 
be a manual click and point scenario.

What you describe could find its place in advanced digitizing toolbar 
and edit menu as two actions : - "paste as a geometry part" / "paste and 
replace existing geometry".

This way you could add the new geometry, and remove the old one 
afterwards and in the meantime reconciliate eventually the two geometries.

It is already something quite advanced. If you decide to start 
implementing this, I suggest you write a feature request where you 
describe the behavior of this edit tool and play with advanced editing 
options to see how you want it to behave when you have overlapping 
features, etc...

Another way might be to experiment this as a python plugin as a proof of 
concept.

Thanks for raising this!

Hi all,

Wondering who is in charge of approving new/update styles in the hub? I had one style "aviation" which I updated and now it is no longer visible as it is marked pending for review, I uploaded a new version today also trying to trigger the review since it has been a bit long.

Probably would be good to have some way to update styles without going through a vetting procedure which is good for new styles but a bit cumbersome for updates.

Hi, Tomas.

I just tested the "Geometry Paster" plugin and also ran into this
clipboard size limit.  It looks like the code for the plugin tries to
avoid this problem:

csv.field_size_limit(sys.maxsize)

But this doesn't seem to have the intended effect.  On my machine,
sys.maxsize is 9223372036854775807, which appears to be too large for
setting the csv.field_size_limit.  One workaround would be to open the
QGIS Python console and set it manually to the maximum longint value:

csv.field_size_limit(2147483647)

It looks like there is already a pull request to fix this in the
plugin, from just 3 days ago:
https://github.com/nextgis/qgis_geometry_paster/pull/12/files

Cheers,
Keith

Hi Antonio

It's me! (and a few others) that review. My apologies, there is a long
standing issue that the notification of style updates go to spam and I
can't 'untrain' the rules (despite trying many times).

I think your proposal makes sense that authors can self approve after the
initial review. Lova could you help us to implement this workflow?

Regards

Tim

Thank you Tim,

No intention on pointing fingers at all just was wondering who could I contact in case it took much longer.

I think the updated workflow could reduce the amount of time required to review updates in theory

Do you happen to have a common field in your layers L and S, which
allows you to know that geometry G goes to feature B?
If that's the case, you could apply all geometry updates at once, based on
this common field.

In its current version (v1.5.0), the plugin "Append Features To Layer" can
update features based on common field values (e.g., an ID or a code).
It'd be simple to add a "Only update geometries" option. I've just created
a feature request [1], feel free to join if you'd like to help testing a
dev version.


*Disclaimer: I wrote the plugin :)*

Regards,

Germ?n

Hello

  Regarding different plugin proposals. I have checked nexta plugin
and even submitted a fix to it which solved the problem only
partially. From what I see it cannot be solved nicely via python
because of different environment/setup reasons. I know this can be
done in some way using different other plugins. This can also be done
by one line of code in postgresql.

  The point is that people migrating from "other" products are used to
such basic feature and that feature is wanted/required for quite a
number of different tasks.

  I got the main information: there are no objective reasons for such
functionality not to be in core. I will therefore try implementing it.

  Thank you for your responses!

Hello,

Thanks again for the technical work and improving the workflow.

+1 for the lazy consensus on non breaking changes.

Regarding the license topic:

+1 for the metadata field with a spdx license. But take care, it's not so easy to a have an exhaustive list. Maybe we should move to the PyPi classifiers since plugins are Python packages and there is already a work on maintaining a metadata ecosystem, including tooling to check it (pip install packaging).

Are we okay with the step back to only a non-blocking warning?

Regards

Hello everyone,

Thank you all. It's truly an honor to work on this project.
I will begin by utilizing QEP to create a QEP that summarizes this discussion and going forward with the suggestion to make the license file recommended for now.

I have reviewed the tickets in the backlog and will evaluate their size. If I come across anything that I don't understand, I will add comments to seek clarification.

Best regards,
Lova

Hi Tim,

For the workflow, that sounds great, thanks a lot!
I agree only breaking changes should go "the long way" and for simple fixes and improvements we should just get them done with low overhead.
Going forward with a small QEP for the license sounds very good.
Regarding the metadata, I would suggest we use the ids from https://spdx.org/licenses/.
So for the usual QGIS plugin case, that would be

    license=GPL-2.0-or-later

On another note, I just added a couple of tickets to the backlog, I am not able to estimate the size of them, so if they are too complicated, just don't prioritize them.

Thank you and best regards
Matthias

Thanks so much Nyall and all credit goes to Lova who is doing fantastic work! What I suggest is that moving forward, Lova uses QEP's too propose and discuss breaking / major workflow changes on the plugins site. In that QEP he can address:

* what the change is (link back to ticket in QGIS-Django for example)
* what the impact will be
* proposed roll out time line
etc.

And we can discuss and agree these changes there before he goes ahead with it. For smaller changes, I suggest he 'just get on with it' - his scrum board is public and you are all welcome to help prioritise his work.

For the current issue under discussion (license requirements for plugins), I have asked Lova to make a QEP and synthesize the discussion there, mainly so he can have a practice run at going through the QEP process, although I will add my 2c that I like Matthias' simple solution to the problem (adding license as a line to the metadata.txt). If I understand you right Matthias, our metadata would then look like this?:

-----------------------------
[general]
name=QGIS Animation Workbench
description=A plugin to let you build animations in QGIS
about=QGIS Animation Bench exists because we wanted to use all the awesome cartography features in QGIS and make cool, animated maps! QGIS already includes the Temporal Manager which allows you to produce animations for time-based data. But what if you want to make animations where you travel around the map, zooming in and out, and perhaps making features on the map wiggle and jiggle as the animation progresses? That is what the animation workbench tries to solve...
version=1.1
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
author=Tim Sutton
email=tim at kartoza.com<mailto:tim at kartoza.com>
repository=https://github.com/timlinux/QGISAnimationPlugin
license=GPLv2
-----------------------------

There is probably another thread to this discussion which is to understand which license are accepted and which not, but that is a job for another QEP I guess...!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsProcessingParameterProviderConnection using
 cached database connections
Message-ID: <2470d975-a617-43cb-ab5a-407d5a3f7d81@gmail.com>

Ok, I'm developing a processing plugin with two algorithms:

  * The first algorithm: The user provides a number of informations
    about a /new/ database. The algorithm creates the new database using
    the information - and creates postgis extension, schemas and some
    tables in the new database.
    And lastly: it creates a database connection for the new database in
    QGIS.

  * The second algorithm: The user chooses a database connection from a
    combobox created using the
    /QgsProcessingParameterProviderConnection/ class. Finally the
    algorithm creates and populates a number of tables using the chosen
    connection

However: If you use the first algorithm to create the database and 
immediately uses the second algorithm trying to populate the new 
database, the connection is /not/ listed in the combobox.

I suspect it's because the /QgsProcessingParameterProviderConnection /is 
using the cached list of? connections when populating the dropdown list/
/

Somewhat like this (in Python):

metadata = QgsProviderRegistry.instance().providerMetadata('postgres')
pg_connections = metadata.connections(cached=True) # Read the cached 
settings

I've had a similar problem in the past that was solved by changing the 
"cached=True" to "cached=False" thereby forcing a reread of the 
connection list.

If you restart QGIS after running algorithm no 1 and /then/ runs 
algorithm no 2 it works like a charm.

My question: Is it possible to force 
/QgsProcessingParameterProviderConnection /to re-read the list of 
connections ? And, if possible, how ??
