Subject: [Qgis-developer] PostGIS manager: missing primary key
Message-ID: <4AC47EC3.2050903@faunalia.it>

Hi all (especially Martin ;)).
I am testing PostGIS manager, and I found a few issues:
- add varchar to data types (not only varchar(n))
- the view built by the versioning command does not work, because it misses a primary key. Running
all the commands (create view, triggers, functions) shown in the PostGIS command window produces a
valid table, so apparently PostGIS manager tells you one thing, and does something different (?),
stripping timestamps (which may be correct) *and* id_hist (which does not appear correct).
Looks an easy fix.
Otherwise, the plugin is amazing! Thanks a lot for this.
All the best.

Hi Marco and all

The field calculator is a great thing to have. Thanks a lot.

I've two little questions about it:

Is it possible to 'overwrite' an existing field? For them moment it always gives you a new field, is this correct?
Is there a chance to have a possiblity to only calculate selected rows and leave the other rows as they are?

Thanks again for the good work.
regards 

C?dric

Hi Giovanni

Yes, there is room for more operators. The list in the ticket seems to be 
usefull to me. I just like to wait for Martins opinion before adding more 
operators, since he knows the search string parser code best.

I'm closing the ticket if there are no objections.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Cedric

Yes, atm it always makes a new field. It would also be possible to adapt the 
field calculator to overwrite existing fields without much effort (mainly changes 
in the GUI).

>Is there a chance to have a

This is a usefull suggestion too (mainly in connection with the first one I 
guess).

Thanks for your input,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Delete view layer on unload method
Message-ID: <20091001151212.D6DAAE00791@lists.osgeo.org>

Dear all,

my plugin use some postgres view to load layer.

When I close QGis i'd like to delete all the views that are related 
with the layer from Postgres.
If I use the method (unload) the system says that the plugin instance 
has no attribute 'mapCanvas'
I imagine that when unload method is running all QGis classes/object 
are already unloaded.

Do you know in which way i can introduce this feature to my plugin?

Thank you, Michele.

Thanks! Now it works. However, the comment marks (""") in lines 1 and 27 of 
the dlgimageclipper.py file can't be followed by any indent in order to work on 
all systems.

The second notice is about the help images. Today my net connection is in bad 
shape ;) and the plugin was dowloading round 10 minutes! :))) It is 100kB of 
code + 7MB of images, I'm sure the images could be a bit smaller and/or 
compressed :)

Also the image_cutter doesn't load on non-windows systems, because of missing 
the resources file. There is the "qrc_resources.py", but the plugin looks for 
"resources.py". On your machine (and maybe all windows systems) it works 
thanks to the compiled resources.pyc file, but on other systems the pyc file has 
to be compiled once again. So you can either remove the "qrc_resources.py" to 
"resources.py" or just import the "qrc_resources" module. 

In general, it is safe practice to remove all the .pyc files before packaging, 
as I've seen some plugin crashes when those files are moved between different 
operating systems.

Thanks for the plugins and enjoy Python! :)

Thanks for your help Borys. I must have inadvertently removed the resources.py file when I deleted the .pyc files. I will fix that this evening (I'm serving this out of my computer at home). Or maybe I will just change the code to use the qrc_resources.py file instead, because remembering to copy this file to resources.py gets to be a pain.

I hear you about the image sizes for the Image Clipper help pages. I'm going to see if I can reduce the sizes and still have decent resolution so that the help page can work. I eventually intend to make a help page accessible from the QGIS menus similar to the help for the Image Cutter.

I appreciate the effort that you, Nikos and Agus are putting in to test these plugins. It will be interesting to see if the Image Cutter plugin is useful to people.

I really do enjoy developing in Python. A Canadian guy, Jean-Francois Doyon used to tell me that Python was a great language but I never got around to learning it until this year and I'm really sorry that I didn't learn it sooner.

Hi!

Are the gdal tools supposed to work

(first  in the list

I'm having problems and want to make sure that it makes sense testing
on that release.

Thanks

The plugin needs gdal16-python: is this inclulded in the package (sorry, no win here to test -
feedback welcome).
All the best.

Hi C?dric

The possibility to update existing fields and to work only on selections are 
added in r11741.

The field calculator still needs a bit modification (similar to 
QgsAddAttrDialog) to add fields to all providers. Will do so after the 
(elongated) weekend on Tuesday.

Regards,
Marco

Marvellous :-)

And for string operations? I tried a concatenation (+) but it doesn't
work...

Message-ID: <20091002132915.GD95807@keybit.net>

Hi qgis heroes,
I'm playing with min/max scale visibility range for layers in an
attempt to have some sort of automatic resolution switching.

Basically I have multiple layers for multiple resolutions and tweak
the scale range in some way.

Question1: am I doing it WRONG ? :) [ maybe there's a layers group for a start ? ]
Question2: does trunk give a visual sign for a layer being visible or not
           based on scale range ? [ I'm using 1.3.0 ]

I think it'd be very useful to have the second behaviour in general, so you
can easily see if a layer is being rendered or not (since the visibility
checkbox is always active no matter scale-based visibility...)

TIA

Hopefully this will get your students in order. Sorry for the oversight.

Borys,

I'm not sure where on the wiki (qgis wiki?) this would go, but feel  
free to put it on for me wherever you feel it is appropriate. If you  
have the all-in-one qgis bundle, ymmv:

Value Tool Plugin on OS X:
(These instructions were performed on OS X 10.6.1, but should work on  
10.5+; not sure about tiger or older. I assume you have the Apple  
Developer tools, Qt, and other Qgis build requirements installed on  
your machine as per the Build from Source instructions for OS X.)

The gdal and osgeo modules are part of William's gdal framework, so  
make sure those are installed on your system. The value tool plugin  
requires pyqwt5 as well. To install this, first download the latest  
source (e.g., 'curl -O http://softlayer.dl.sourceforge.net/project/pyqwt/pyqwt5/PyQwt-5.2.0/PyQwt-5.2.0.tar.gz 
), and enter the source directory (I assume you have qwt source and  
pyqwt source in the same directory, e.g., your root or a temp  
directory). Enter the configure directory and edit configure.py with  
your favorite editor. Change line 186 from '    qmake = os.path.join 
(configuration.qt_dir, 'bin', 'qmake')' to '    qmake = os.path.join 
(configuration.qt_dir, 'usr', 'bin', 'qmake')', then save and run  
'python configure.py -Q ../qwt-5.2'. After this, 'make' and 'sudo make  
install' and your all set to install the Value Tool plugin from the  
Plugin Manager in Qgis.

John

Note: my Qgis binaries include a bundled pyqwt5.  I do this because  
they are meant to be installed inside the PyQt folder, it wouldn't  
work to install PyQwt5 in your system site-packages.

Thanks for that clarification, William. I was unaware of that.

My build instructions were based on using your frameworks and my own  
trunk build of qgis. Do you have any suggestions on getting the plug- 
in working with your binary? Apparently something is not being picked  
up if the plugin is reporting qwt as missing for people.

When is it failing?  I installed it in my current Qgis 1.3 and enabled  
it, no problems so far.  I see the panel, but I have no clue on how it  
works (do plugins have help?).

Help? Not sure. Depends on whether there is a website or not, etc.  
Some are documented in the help documentation.

If you load a raster (any raster), enable the plugin (there should be  
a panel, as you mentioned), then tick the second box (Value/Graph), an  
interactive graph should show up. If qwt is not being picked up, then  
it will say qwt not found, or similar.

Agus: are your students using the most current binary?

John

Ah, raster.  OK, no complaints about Qwt5.  Move the cursor around the  
map and the little red dot bounces up-n-down the graph.

Tested on full version on Tiger and Snow (I can try Leo, and  
standalones, later).

No, he wrote qgis crashes when running ValueTool and Scattergram. Qwt5 is only 
my thought.

I'm not touching the wiki yet, as the issue is open.

By the way, Gdal and osgeo was reported as missing. Note that we're talking

Aha. I stripped out the framework's extras in the standalone Qgis,  
because the python stuuf wouldn't be found in the bundled frameworks.   
Though I did still bundle the psycopg and qwt5.  Hmmm.

I could dump the GDAL python stuff in with the rest of the bundled  
Python extras...

stay tuned for updated standalone installers.

OK, new standalone Qgis packages are online.  I added GDAL and SQLite  
python from the frameworks.

Maybe this will get past the supposedly missing Qwt5 now.

Hi all.
I tested the interpolation plugin against the equivalent gdal tool (grid). The
results are comparable (which is good; obviously the C++ plugin is way faster), but
the two resulting rasters are slightly different: the C++ result seems shifted
slightly to NW, while the gdal seems more centered on the actual points. maye
computation is done on the NE corner instead of the center of the grid?
I can provide the two resulting tiffs and a sample point shp if it helps.
All the best.

Nope you are doing it correctly - layers group does not yet support
scale based viz (interesting idea though).

No - also a good idea...probably something to file an enhancement ticket
for....

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mapfile Plugin
Message-ID: <3DC8B3C7-AF51-4085-9A46-E82D8E95C8A9@gmail.com>

Hi Borys,

I was intrigued by the new mapfile plugin, so gave it a test run this  
morning on a mapserver file I have. Unfortunately, it threw an error  
and was not able to load the layers. I cannot tell which layer is  
causing the problem, but even selecting a single layer from the list  
kicks out the same error. Any ideas on how to fix this? I'm on OS X  
10.6.1 and using William Kyngesburye's mapscript framework. Import  
mapscript from a python shell appears to load the module fine.

Here is the output:

An error has occured while executing Python code:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis, Qt Creator and cmake... how to sort it out?
Message-ID: <e12429640910050418l755d59c8kab7dbd641f40b10e@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,
I was looking for a cross-platform C++ IDE that could fit with Qgis and,
naturally, I've found Qt Creator. I have neither experience with it nor in
managing complex cmake projects. Ok that's not a good start, but forgive me
because until now I've always programmed with scripting languages (Python,
PHP, etc)
I go to the point: does anyone have experience with this three ingredients?
I'll try to set them up by myself, but if someone can share its experience
it would facilitate very much my struggle...

thanks, Giovanni

Hello,

I googled around a bit, but just found old posts about this topic.
I tried to edit a postgis 3d layer with qgis with no success, are 3d
geometries supported in qgis?
If no, there any plan/roadmap to support 3d geometries in qgis?


Thanks

Wow!  Great news!  This is a much needed feature in QGIS--well done!

A couple of comments:

1)  The tool is buried under a lot of menus.  I think the ideal place for it
would be directly on the Attribute Table beside the "Toggle Editing" button.
2)  It would be great to have a feature to calculate x,y, area, and length
(I think I saw this mentioned somewhere already, but I'm adding a vote)
without using fTools (and exporting to a new file)
3)  Ideally, a way to calculate a unique ID for a table (e.g.
auto-incrementing sequential numbers).  One way of doing this (implemented
in Kosmo GIS) is to show the 'invisible' ID associated with the shapefile
(e.g. the 'row number' that shows up in the attribute table) and make it
available for calculations.

Cheers,

Darren

I made a patch[1] for 2d+ geometries.   But it never got the extensive testing,
it probably needs.

Hello G. Allegri
Using QtCreator with QGis is easy. To open QGis in it you should do:

   1. In menu File->Open File or Project (Ctrl+O);
   2. In open file dialog find CMakeLists.txt in the root of QGIs
   (/usr/local/src/qgis_trunk/CMakeLists.txt) and open it;
   3. Run cmake in CMake Wizard. You can run it after adding project for
   this you should navigate to cmake build directory it is qtcreator-build in
   project root and run ccmake .. like usually);
   4. After that QtCreator adds the new project with name qgis-1.x.x.
   5. If you need to correct cmake options you can do it now (see 3);
   6. Compile QGis (Ctrl+B);
   7. Switch to tab Projects. In section Build Settings->Build Steps push
   Details button and add in Additional arguments: install.
   8. In section Run Settings push +Add and select in combo box Custom
   Executable then push Details and add in Executable:
   /patch/to/qgis/executable (/usr/local/bin/qgis);
   9. Start Debugging QGis: F5.

Thats all :)

Great (that you wrote the patch)!

Not so great (that wasn't accepted).

I will give it try... do you think it still apply to current trunk?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin specific maplayers
Message-ID: <200910061105.17864.mwa@sourcepole.ch>

Hello

At the moment our mapfile plugin only works when adding a mapfile layer using 
the plugin dialog. This is done by creating a temporary image and adding it 
as a raster layer. This image is then rerendered on every change of the map 
canvas extents.
But this layer will not be restored when saving it in a project, as the 
temporary image no longer exists. Also the plugin can not detect which layer 
belonged to it or what parameters to use.

To solve these issues it would be nice to have a new plugin specific maplayer 
type.

Desired features:
- attach layer to corresponding plugin when loading a project
  - get plugin specific parameters to recreate the layer
  - handle layers with missing plugins
- save plugin specific parameters when saving a project
- detach from plugin when removing the layer
- create and add layer using the plugin
- get layer draw events for custom rendering based on current extents and 
image size
- customizable layer properties dialog

Several of these features can be solved with workarounds using the QGIS API. 
But especially the problem of restoring a layer when loading a project is 
still unsolved.

What would be the best approach to integrate plugin specific maplayers into 
QGIS?

Some ideas:
- add a new class QgsPluginRasterDataProvider : QgsRasterDataProvider, though 
the QgsRasterDataProvider interface is rather WMS specific
- or add a new class QgsPluginLayer : QgsMapLayer and LayerType::PluginLayer 
which would cause a lot of adjustments all over the place

Best regards
Mathias Walker

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mapfile Plugin
Message-ID: <200910061139.50331.mwa@sourcepole.ch>

Hello John

According to your traceback the mapscript module has been loaded.

What projection are you using in your mapfile? The mapfile plugin always 
requests the image as WGS84 at the moment, so this could be the cause of the 
error.

You can try rendering the mapfile from a console and see if you still get the 
error:

shp2img -m yourmapfile.map > mapfile.png

Best regards
Mathias Walker

Hi Mathias

There is a limited possibility to read from / write to project file from 
plugins with QgsProject::instance()->writeEntry / readEntry. 

However, in your case of custom maplayers, I think it is better to create a 
specific subclass of QgsMapLayer (as in your second idea).

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

it's possible to assign a keyboard shortcut to execute a python plugin?

in the initGUI() I can define the plugin menu, but I don't know how to
assign a shortcut to it (like those already present: CTRL+N for New,
etc...). How can I do it?

I use QGIS 1.3.0.

Hi Paolo

I think you are right. The interpolation plugin calculated the values in the 
top left corner instead of the center of the raster cells. r11759 is supposed 
to fix this. Could you test if it works now?

Marco

Hi,

IMHO it should be kept, such redundacy is good. The ability to save from
projected view is more like a workaround then a tool to me. Plus it is
much easier to explain it to a new person (like go to tools and select
"reproject").

If you compare it with other GIS, there is always a possibility to do
both, there is a tool and you always can save vector in the current coordinate
system.

However, usability wise, this may be improved, by asking whether user
needs to save the layer in other projection on the same step when
asked for new name. Two options can be provided: in coordinate system
of the data and in the current coordinate system. Ability to select
other CRS should be left to a reprojection tool.

Yes I agree, I will remove both of these functions soon.
It's actually quite nice to see some of the fTools becoming
redundant, it means progress :-)

Hmm, well perhaps this should be discussed further... Maxim does have a

I think it should stay, users coming from ArcGIS will be expecting such
a tool, the save as shapefile is not a clear place where it would be
found. I've actually been thinking that should be save as... with the
option to do kml, gml, shp etc.

It's also possible that someone may want to reproject without first
loading the layer. I'd like to see an option to select from file for
reprojection and to include support for other formats.

Hello All,

So, I have made quite a bit of progress with this function, but I am having
a little problem.  It does not work with all datasets.

For debuging, the program outputs the point coordinates using the toString()
function each time it checks for coincident points (when checking if
polyline segments touch end to end).  Some points show as being equal using
toString() but don't return true when checked using ==.  I suspect that this
is due to rounding errors maybe, but that doesn't quite seem right because
the source data are equal double values.  Does the toString() function show
all the decimal points for the point coordinates?  Is there a better way to
check if points are coincident (better than ==)?

I can send out the code if anyone is interested.

Thanks for all your help.

Matt

Hi all.
So it seems that some redundancy is good - ok. I agree with Maxim that the interface
of the reprojection tools could be simpler.
BTW: what is the difference between clip and difference? Tehy seem to give the same
result, at least in the cases I have tested.
The check of geometry validity seems enormously slow, barely usable for real data: do
you confirm?
All the best.

Much more similar now. Still not identical though, but I guess this may be due to
rounding or other. If you want I can send you the two resulting rasters and the

Hi Paolo

Which algorithms did you use? Afaik, the inverse distance weighting is the 
only method that is common to interpolation plugin and GDAL. And there it is 
important that you set the same distance weighting coefficient for both.

Marco

Yes, it's IDW. I used defalut parameters in both cases.
But as I said the differences were quite small (sooner or later I'll check with GRASS
algebra).

Nice one! We'll have to add this to the C++ API during hackfest (or before
if I get a chance).
Unfortunately a lot of my QGIS stuff is on hold until the hackfest do to
time constraints :-(
Once it's added at the C++ level, I'll add it to the Python API as well, so
others can use it,
I think this will be a very useful function!

Hi Bishwarup.

You must put the following line to the setup options of py2exe:

   "includes": ['sip'],

This will include the sip module to the generated dir.


Regards.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] grass fails importing shp
Message-ID: <4ACCA5DD.1010107@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
The GRASS plugin (v.in.ogr.qgis) fails to import shapefiles:
?Unable to open data source
In fact, the command is
v.in.ogr -o 'dsn=/home/paolo/Desktop/Dati_corso_QGIS/fiumi-princ.shp|layerid=0'
output=fiumi
instead of
v.in.ogr -o 'dsn=/home/paolo/Desktop/Dati_corso_QGIS/fiumi-princ.shp' output=fiumi
which works. Also plain v.in.ogr works.
The diff is:
<         <ogr key="dsn" layeroption="layer" whereoption="where" label="OGR vector
layer" />
---
>       <file key="dsn" type="old" label="OGR file" />
Any reason to use layeroption?
Looks an easy fix, anybody available?
All the best, and many thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] native file dialogs
Message-ID: <200910071642.19334.marco@hugis.net>

Hi all (especially Tim as app maintainer)

Are there any objections against using native file dialogs where possible? If 
not, I'm going to change the file dialogs in several places (similar to the 
attached example patch which does the change for 'open OGR vector layer').

According to the Qt docs, QFileDialog::getOpenFileNames and similar open a 
native dialog on Windows and OSX. Whereas creating a QFileDialog and calling 
exec() creates a 'normal' QFileDialog.

Advantage of the native dialog is not only the look and feel but also options 
like network drives on windows.

Regards,
Marco

The datasource format changed and the grass plugin wasn't aware of that.
I also noticed that the whereoption was broken.

+1.

That would be great to get more ui consistency in the application. It  
can be confusing at times with different types of dialogs popping up.

I believe that difference carries over the attributes from both input  
layers (i.e., the clipping layer attributes are appended to the  
attribute table), whereas clip only retains the attributes of the  
layer being clipped.

Right. BTW, more consistency would also be good among plugins: not only file dialogs,
but adding to canvas, remembering last path etc. are often different.
Would it be difficult to write guidelines and ask py devs to follow them?
Thanks.

You're abolutely right. Probably all we need is to choose the best practice 
from all the existing already and adjust another plugins to this one. So the 
most important points are:

1. Cleaning up the two possible behaviours:
-a plugin creates a new shapefile and asks for adding it to the canvas
-a plugin creates only a memory layer and adds it to the canvas

2. Choosing common Settings keys for storing last used: 
- input directory, 
- output directory, 
- input encoding, 
- output encoding (they should differ as one can often open windows-encoded 
dbfs and want to save them in utf)
- postgres connection
- spatialite connection
- surely something more

3. Plugin categories and grouping in menus and toolbars (should be discussed, 
especially integrating all the datasource plugins with the native 'File' 
toolbar and the 'Layer' dropdown menu)

4. Some kind of unified look and feel of plugin dialogs.

5. What more?

Hi,
I just started using qgis and I am writing a plugin with loads the shape files and varies the width of outline according to attribute.
Looks like varying the width it is not possible viz layer properties and symbology way.
Can anyone help me in implementing this functionality?

Thanks

Borys  (et al.),

These plugin issues were something that I was hoping to discuss at the 
upcoming hackfest...
Perhaps we (the community) should come up with some (more) suggestions 
that we can
discuss/finalize at the hackfest?

Message-ID: <b55968000910072049l4b8a9d07jd29a131b226fb8e7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there!

I just installed
qgis-1.3.0-11.2.x86_64.rpm
and pre-requisited files from
http://ftp.df.lth.se/pub/opensuse/repositories/Application:/Geo/openSUSE_11.1/x86_64/

system: SUSE 11.1 x64 with up-to-date patches, running KDE 3.5

I see the splash screen and then a core dump and that's the end.

~> qgis
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

I am pasting below the gdb backtrace from the core dump.

Any ideas what may be causing it or how to correct it? Does qgis write
an error log somewhere? What else can I do to find out what is causing
it?

Many thanks,
Art

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Guide for using the qgis python console
Message-ID: <4ACD927E.5070100@gmail.com>

Hi!

Could somebody write few examples of
using the qgis python  console and
(best) post them to the user's corner?
I think that this is a very nice feature in qgis that is rarely used.

Thanks!

Thanks, this is a nice workaround, as I'm actually making
the gpx files out of compegps files through gpsbabel.

Anyway, the gps plugin should contemplate the possibility of opening 
multiple files
and open vector layer should let you select the actual layer for all 
selected files
(otherwise the ability to select multiple files is not useful).
Also, is there any way to tell the layer at startup? i.e.
qgis *.gpx -t

for selecting the track layer of each gpx file.

Discussing plugin issues at the hackfest will be great. Hopefully we can 
assemble and write such a guideline document directly there.

I agree with Carson that it would be good to have a topic list for the 
hackfest.

So from what I understood, porting f-Tools to the analysis library is also 
intended. Other topics?

 Would this be an opportunity to discuss implementing a set of common
python utilities for plugins? This would help plugin uniformity and
stop duplication of code between plugins (which I am sure exists now).
I think I've suggested this in the past and the arguments against were
(1) that such functionality should be in the core and (2) that it
would introduce a dependency that plugins would have to work to.

 My thinking on (1) is that this would include purely pythonic things
- such as iterators over features - that need to be done as python. My
thinking on (2) is that we probably have to cope with enough API
dependencies that one more doesn't matter, and authors can always
choose to roll their own code.

 Sorry I can't be at hackfest to discuss this further! But if anyone
has other ideas for common pythonic functionality, I'll be happy to
hear them...

+1 regarding Barry's suggestion
I will bring this up at the hackfest.
This means that if authors want, they can import (for example)
qgs_utils.py, otherwise, they can simply do it themselves...
Things like: adding a newly created layer to the canvas, iterators
over features, adding/creating new fields, etc...

There's this little snippet of how to use some of the routines from my

Dear German,

Thank you very much for your response. I am able to include sip files now.
But I am stuck in one another problem now.

In my application, there is a win32 application (I am calling MS Word from
inside python)
When I run my python file, everything works fine. But when i run my exe I
get the following error:

 File "win32com\client\gencache.pyc", line 540, in EnsureDispatch
  File "win32com\client\CLSIDToClass.pyc", line 50, in GetClass
KeyError: '{00020970-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}'


I dont know how to overcome this error. I tried in google, and only found
one solution, that also didnot worked for me.

I am having MSOFFICE 2003 and MSOFFICE2007 both in my system.
I am using python2.5

Thank you very much in advance.

With Warm Regards,
Bishwarup

i have a problem with QgsMapLayerRegistry class when i try to remove

i use this two code line:

Hi Michele.

I guess you must update the canvas layer set after remove a layer from
QgsMapLayerRegistry.

Any advice on how to do this?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] HELP!! DLL not found when importing qgis.core and

Message-ID: <2E95F75EDC25D54999387A1E2E6EF62741CA9D8027@MBX02.cgcent.miami.edu>



Dear QGIS group, I posted to the users mailing list but they advised me to ask the developers... so here is my question:

I have my application designed in PyQt and need to add a Qgis canvas to it. I followed the user guide ch. 12 to add things and convert my app into a PyQGIS application. Everything used to work fine in my PyQt4 and PyWin32 installation. Last night I installed the binaries of QGIS 1.0, then added the recommended environment variables (PATH, PYTHONPATH, QGISHOME) to my system, and now this is what my Pythonwin editor complaints about:

>>> import qgis
>>> import PyQt4
>>> from qgis.core import *
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<interactive input>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
>>> from qgis.gui import *
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<interactive input>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
>>> from PyQt4.QtCore import *
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<interactive input>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.
>>>

I think the DLL existed before the QGIS installation because the PyQt4.QtCore install used to work perfect!!. Also seems to be the exact same DLL what is missing in both cases (PyQt and QGIS imports). Could someone give me a hand with this? I'M STUCKED!!! If you happen to know which is the missing DLL, could you please email it to me along with the location?

Maybe it has something to do with the environmet variables?
Could it be because Python is also inside the binary distribution and I'm using my usual 'alone' installation? Or is it Windows?

Thanks very much,
Angelica

Hm, probably.  Before it didn't build with SIP 4.9 and now it builds with SIP
4.8 and 4.9.

Angelica,

I make the plugin for QGis, before, it is a python program used PyQT4 and binding GDAL.

For test and debug by IDE PyScripter, i call the same package alone, i.e, out of QGis.
The same sources i copy and put out of folder for plugin?s and run the main python file (_run_OUT_QGis.py).

You can ready the source and make adaptations for your work.

The plugin?s is 'Image Boundary' in 'http://pyqgis.org/repo/contributed'

The _run_OUT_QGis.py:
------------
import sys

from PyQt4 import QtGui

from imgboundary_dlg import ImgBoundaryDialog

app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)

dlg = ImgBoundaryDialog()
dlg.show()


sys.exit(app.exec_())
------------ 


Good luck!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SVG export
Message-ID: <4ACE9E2E.8080001@wildintellect.com>

Right now I'm attending the North American Cartographic Information
Society meeting. I did a demo in front of 150 people with QGIS 1.3 which
seemed quite well received(Along with other CA Chapter
members-Postgis,Mapserver,OpenJump). Even helped a mac user fix their
install.

Feedback from cartographic professionals...
We need really good svg export. Basically the majority of professional
cartographers use Illustrator/Photoshop to make their final maps. We
could spend a ton of time with the map composer, but they'll still use
those apps to finish their maps. A large number of this group are Mac
users, and they don't have much love for current products though some
grin and bear using it.

I think if we solve how to output high quality, layered svg a good
number of cartographers will jump on board. Long term I think that will
help bolster the drive to improve labeling, symbology, thematic mapping
which have already come really far. Some of these users are technically
savy (A lot of flash oriented web stuff) so there's a good chance to
pick up some good expertise.

Oh, fyi someone asked me on my way out the door if anyone's got QGIS
running on an OLPC?

Thanks,
Alex

Alex,

Thanks for this report, and ++ from me.

I've been involved with OSM community members thinking about making  
high resolution print maps from openstreetmap data through Mapnik, and  
most agree this means rendering to scaled vectors (based on setting a  
resolution to avoid needing to manually tweak line widths, font sizes,  
and symbols), and then laying out and making final adjustments in  
Illustrator or Inskcape.

This is one of the fellows spearheading a list of both UI dreams and  
hard, practical features needed:

Hi Germ?n,

maybe I discover why the system crash...

my plugin have a form that work on the active layer.
On the OK button these operations will be done:
    * get the properties of the active layer that 
is based on a pg view (like sql, name, ...)
    * remove the layer from QGis using the removeMapLayer function
    * perform some filter on the data
    * create a new view based on the filter
    * load a layer based on the view using addMapLayer function
This last command, addMapLayer, togheter with 
second one removeMapLayer, create a crash!

I solve the problem in this way: instead of 
remove the layer, I replace my view with the new sql but with the same name.
To view the new result it is easy to refresh the MapCanvas.

Michele.

Hi Anita

Yes, definitely a good topic for the meeting. And with Andreas, we are going to 
have an SVG expert there.
In my opinion, the svg composer export is not that bad. There is one problem 
with clipping (Qt does not support that) and one with scaling (probably fixable 
in the composer export).

cheers,
Marco

Wiki sounds good. Please create a wiki page for the topic list.

Another problem I frequently stumble upon is point markers: in the SVG output, these are usually shown as bitmap symbols instead of true SVG. Same goes for the PDF output, point markers are also bitmapped in there.

Outputting layered SVG corresponding to map layers would also be *very* nice. I once started writing a plugin to do this, but never got very far. In any case, it would very much facilitate the Qgis -> Inkscape/Illustrator workflow!

Arnout

In fTools there is a command for generating Delaunay triangles; it would be

Good: Certainly
Easy: Not so much ;-)
The code that I use to create the delaunay triangles is not my own, and as
such is not designed
to create nice voronoi polygons. It can certainly make voronoi lines, and I
can add this easily,
but polygons will require quite a bit more work. I will of course add this
in due time, unless someone
else has an all Python voronoi polygons implementation that they want to
share? I stress all Python
because fTools has no additional requirements beyond the base Python and
QGIS libraries, and *must*
stay that way...

Regards,

Carson

This is going to be in the latest version of the manual, which will
hopefully be released soon. We are very under-staffed at the moment, so
things a taking quite a bit longer than we'd like.

 Don't you also run into the problem that voronoi polygons on the edge
head off to infinity? Saving that as a shapefile might be tricky. The
pragmatic approach is to clip to a rectangle, but that can exclude
whole polygons.

 How's this:

 Ah, you already are using this! I guess the problem is extracting the
polygon topology from the segments, and dealing with the infinities...

Exactly! I've come close (Clipping the polygons to the extent of the largest
complete polygon (if I recall correctly).
The hardest part as you say, extracting the polygon topology :-( The
implementation I've developed so far is also very messy ;-)

 I had an idea - if you can get the points of the voronoi polygons in
any order, then (I think) they must lie on a convex hull. So find the
centroid, and then order them in increasing bearing (atan2(y,x) or
something).

 I've just been looking at the source for the deldir package in R that
does voronoi polys. I dont think it gives direct access to the built
polygons (only segments) but it does do clipping. And it's written in
ratfor, which looks rather fine....

 Wish I had more time to code, but weekends are spent decorating....

Hi Jeff.

I think this is a good idea, but something that I would really like to 
see as core functionality rather than in a plugin. It will not be too 
difficult to add and would be even easier in the main raster class 
because you have access to the readData() and readValue() functions, 
which are private. Basically, look at any of the drawXXXX() methods as a 
outline for what needed to be done.

If you would file a ticket and I will see about getting it in. If you 
are interested in helping out with the raster code base ( we could use 
help, I have been inexcusably absent  ) let us chat some more!

Message-ID: <8b5938320910091125l5285fdcbg8b626a4da40f2fb3@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Developers,

I can not get any output result  from the python console after version 1.2.0
and 1.3.0 in win xp with the new gui design of python console.

it seems that the console is working very well like when the command
"iface.zoomFull()" is executed, the display changes.


But when any command something like below is tried, there is no response in
the python console of qgis. *

>>> layer1 = iface.mapCanvas().layer(0)
**>>> layer1.name()

*
Before version 1.2.0, the name of the layer is shown as the output in the
console.

This is very delicate and useful feature for the developers who develop the
plugin in win.


Is there any other way to get a quick response/output from the python qgis
commands in win os?

If not, can this feature be included as the same as like before version
1.2.0?

Try:

Volkan,

The console python Qgis you need explicit stdout, then all methods 
return string, for view you need use function print
print *layer1.name <http://layer1.name>()

thanks a lot, it worked.

>>> l = iface.mapCanvas().layer(0)
>>> print l.name()
fire1998mah

but when it is executed without print and seeing that doing nothing, this
gives an impression that the console is not working.

again, thank you both so much for very fast response.

this is also works:

k = 4

if k ==4:

  print "mulitple"

  print "is ok"

>>> k=4 if k==4: print "multiple" print "is ok"
multiple is ok

multiple statement per execution become possible. wonderful.

is there any doc about what else has changed in the python console?

Hi all,

I also think that better import/export of SVG graphics would help 
interoperability with other graphics software. Proper import/export 
from/to Inkscape, Illustrator and Corel is important.

On the import side it would be good if Inkscape files would import 
without problems into the QGIS map layout. On the export side it would 
be good if the export would be properly clipped and would contain more 
"structure": layers, ids for certain elements, less empty/unnecessary 
<g/> elements, proper support for vector symbols (not rasterized), etc.

The problem is that most of our desired features aren't supported in the 
qt SVG library. Furthermore, qtSVG is limited to SVG tiny - which causes 
all the problems with the text elements (dx/dy not supported, etc.)

The best solution would be to patch qtSVG to do what we want - but we 
have to be aware that it may take a while until our improvements would 
make it into the standard qt distribution. By improving qtSVG also other 
project that use qt for profit from our improvements.

Just recently returned from the SVG Open 2009 conference in California 
where also other projects relying on qt (e.g. Fritzing) complained about 
suboptimal SVG support: see 
http://www.svgopen.org/2009/papers/33-SVG_in_Fritzing_a_Case_Study/ - so 
maybe we could also team up with other projects relying on SVG support 
in qt.

Looking forward to discuss these issues in Vienna.

Andreas

Fixed in r11789. I can't upload to the plugin repo at the time due to a server 
problem :(

Unfortunately, they still don't match (0.123 vs 0.125).

Hi Andreas,

I needed a svg map of the netherlands a while ago in which I wanted some 
points to be removed and rearranged.
I hacked some code of my html-imagemap-plugin into a new plugin. See 
http://www.duif.net/qgis/simplesvg/
(warning: code is rough!)

This preliminary plugin does (for single symbol point, line and polygon 
layers):
- group objects in layers and features (so in inkscape it's possible to 
change style/colof of whole layer or feature)
- point-features are little boxes in svg
- use (some of) style information from qgis
It's all very simple, but just enough to do the trick for me :-)


Found also the nice examples of carto, with more advanced svg tricks.
But using them I found out:
- world-projection (using real coordinates in svg) in inkscape isn't 
working (yet)
- css (needed to be able to define styles for objects) not yet 
implemented in inkscape yet.

In other words: I think it's possible to do this in a python plugin... 
(though off course fixing qt is a better (long term) idea).
If somebody is interested, please let me know.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Later in the source-tree I found an (apparently abandoned?) cpp 
html-image-map plugin:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/external_plugins/imagemap_exporter
another possibility?

Message-ID: <4AD19118.4060006@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
The hackfest is approaching http://www.qgis.org/wiki/2._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Vienna_2009
We expect this to be a very productive event, helping us fixing a number of issues
and agreeing on the future development.
I would therefore ask:
- users, to contribute to the success of the event by donating some money to help
developers to assist the fest (we are still below our target:
http://www.qgis.org/sponsorship.html)
- developers, to join the fest; those who need financial assistance please contact me
offlist
- those who are not able to come, to follow the activities of the fest, and
participate remotely via the usual channels (ML, IRC) by testing the new code and
sending their ideas; those who can compile QGIS autonomously on various platforms
will be especially useful, but everybody can help.
Thanks to all.

Hi Paolo

Structure lines and break lines are considered in the generation of the TIN 
(IDW, by its nature, cannot consider linear elements). 

Lets say you have elevation data that you want to be on the digital surface 
(lake borders, contour lines, valley lines, ...). The code modifies the 
triangulation such that no edge crosses a structure / break lines (known as 
constrained delaunay triangulation).

The difference between break- and structure lines is that the first means a 
sudden change in slope (where the surface is not continuously differentiable) 
and the second a slow change. At the moment, in the interpolation plugin, 
there is only linear interpolation for TINs and it behaves the same in both 
cases. I have some code from my phd that provides cubic interpolation an that 
makes a difference. I plan to bring this code into the interpolation plugin, 
but it uses some old Qt3 container classes and therefore needs cleanup (maybe 
at the hackfest ;-) ).

For an easy introduction to the subject, see my phd (or some of the references 
listed): http://www.dissertationen.unizh.ch/2004/hugentobler/diss.pdf

Marco

Hi all.

My name is Antony.


 I'm novice in QGIS-development and I need your help!

I have an application and need to integrate in it a QGIS widget for
exploring a map.

It's something like Tutorial No.2 (basic main window) but instead of loading
layers I need to load the full project (a complete map which was created in
QGIS earlier).

And the second thing I gotta do is to draw points onto the map.


 I need your advice about the direction to go to.Which classes I should look
into deeply. And what maybe the easiest way to solve my tasks. It's not
really good to re-invent the weel so I lay my hopes on you.

Thanks in advance!

you have to right click on the installer file and in the properties

like that... I also try to avoid touch Vista.

Just as an FYI, I'm currently setting up a Windows7, XP, and maybe Vista
virtual machine farm to try and work on the standalone installer via
MSYS with GRASS to get us back to what we had pre 1.0 and hopefully find
 the magic to allow cross compilation from linux.

You can find the plugin here: http://code.google.com/p/ftools-qgis/
I'm not sure if it's working correctly at the moment. The plugin works 
ok, but I don't appear to be getting the correct results. If someone 
could test it that would be great. If you make any changes, please let

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Windows Compile and Installer Update
Message-ID: <4AD3BE6F.4020707@wildintellect.com>

I just talked with my colleague here at my lab. For the hackfest we will
be participating remotely and specifically spending some time getting
the MSYS build of QGIS with GRASS working.

I'm setting up virtual machines of Windows 7(already up), XP and maybe
Vista to test on and would be happy to use them for future builds in the
near future if we get this working.

The lack of a standalone installer with GRASS that works out of the box
is a critical blocker preventing upgrade by several of my colleagues
including a professor who has previously written QGIS tutorials.

DEAR DEVELOPERS:

My error message when doing "from qgis.core import * " looks dumb but have not been able to crack it!!

ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.

I have my application ready to run. All your examples in the blog are being refused by the same DLL cause at the same line (even if I change the prefix, set the environment variables, add directories to my path, or run a .bat file that loads the variables). I have Python25 (PyWin32), Numpy, Scipy, etc, and PyQt 4.3 previously installed in my windows XP machine... is it a problem for QGIS to have all those previously installed? should I uninstall my Python to use the binary?

When I execute PyQgis applications from the Python console that comes inside QGIS they DO PASS THE IMPORT LINE OF THE TROUBLE. So where in my installation you think the problem is?

Thank you,
Angelica.

Message-ID: <7EE825B5-66F6-45D6-90CE-7692D5F502DE@geo.uu.se>

Hi!

This is with QGis 1.3 on OSX 10.6. Connecting to spatialite databases  
with the current trunk (r11800) does not work at all.

I consolidated a set of shape files into a sqlite/spatialite database.  
This implied copying of data, dropping and renaming of tables. Now the  
sqlite database is vacuumed and ready to use. However, when connecting  
with QGis to the database I get a list of old obsolete tables (that  
have been dropped or renamed), and not the actual list of tables as  
with .tables in sqlite/spatialite. Other applications, on the other  
hand, provide the correct table listing (e.g. GRASS db.tables  
command). Any help is appreciated! Thanks.

Henning

Hi Henning,

the QGis/SpatiaLite data provider only processes
fully qualified geometry tables, ignoring any
other 'plain' table.

and in order to identify such geom-tables, we cannot
rely on .tables at all (because this will simply
produce the full unqualified tables list).

so, the only way to get the fully qualified geometry
tables list is to use the following SQL query:

SELECT * FROM geometry_columns;

I suppose that after dropping and/or renaming tables
your DB now contains a completely misaligned
'geometry_columns' table (i.e. no longer corresponding
to the actual table layout), and this easy explains any
trouble you are experiencing.

Suggestion:
check 'geometry_columns' (and correct any inconsistency

Hi all.
While installing QGIS from OSGeo4w on several machines, I have an error while
starting QGIS on only one: the entry point for locale_charset in iconv.dll is
missing. Does anybody have an idea on how to solve it?
[BTW: why the hell every win machine is different??]
Thanks a lot.

Hi Sandro!

Thanks for your help. I assumed that spatialite creates and updates  
the geometry columns in a database continously. What happend is that  
each new table that I created got a geometry column, but the table  
geometry_columns wasn't updated (entry missing). Spatialite also  
renamed tables, but not the associated entry in the table  
geometry_columns.  Upon a drop table command the table was dropped,  
but spatiallite left an orphan entry in the geometry_columns table. So  
I could see all deleted tables in QGis and not the new ones. Now I  
manually updated the geometry columns in the new tables which also  
wrote the correct entry into the table geometry_columns and then  
manually deleted all orphan entries in the latter. Now it works.   
Thanks again!

Henning

Just for the record: I found the problem. There were >1 DLLs in different location,
and the one in C:\WINDOWS maked the "good" one in the osgeo folder. Renaming the

Hello Agus,

I personally did not test the DEM shader plugin on MS Windows sofar.
Taking the error at face value suggests that perhaps you ran out of
memory on Windows but that would need quite a large DEM (which would
be easy to generate). If the error occurs with a small DEM, you might
be best off investigating numpy bugs and performance on MS Windows
since the error occurs in a numpy function (or class). If the errors
occurs only with large DEMs on Windows that would not be too
surprising since Linux deals better with larger amounts of memory than
Windows in general.

my 2c worth, Andreas

I have the same problem - there is just not enough place to move the

Message-ID: <2E95F75EDC25D54999387A1E2E6EF62741CA9D8036@MBX02.cgcent.miami.edu>

HOW I FINALLY SOLVED THE DLL PROBLEM (in case somebody gets annoyed by the same issue)

After trying all the versions available for windows machines, my last chance was the complete OSGeo4W package by recommendation of a nice web page for Spanish-speaking GIS users http://geotux.tuxfamily.org (thanks German Carrillo). Then I stopped using my pre-installed Python25 version and started using the Python25 that comes with the OSGeo4W distribution, typing right inside the OSGeo4W console. Then I installed in my new OSGeo4W/apps/Python25/Lib/site-packages directory all the python packages that my application needs, as if it was my old nice own-compiled python environment (with which one gets stubborn and tends no to abort it when trouble arise!). Then I put my application folder inside new Python's "Scripts" folder, just to be conservative... Up to here, the DLLs still did not load correctly but this time OSGeo4W gave me their NAMES!. Then I copied the required DLLs in the Python folder (as if I had compiled the package from source) and VOILA! it worked. I executed my PyQt application from the OSGeo4W console and the main window, pop-ups, search and load files, graphicViews, all worked nice. Now I have to use PyQGIS for replacing that graphicViews by canvases, which is all I needed...
NOTE: I tried the same copy of DLLs when installing the non-OSGeo4W package in another XP machine and it did not work...

That's all folks,

Subject: DLL not found

DEAR DEVELOPERS:

My error message when doing "from qgis.core import * " looks dumb but have not been able to crack it!!

ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.

I have my application ready to run. All your examples in the blog are being refused by the same DLL cause at the same line (even if I change the prefix, set the environment variables, add directories to my path, or run a .bat file that loads the variables). I have Python25 (PyWin32), Numpy, Scipy, etc, and PyQt 4.3 previously installed in my windows XP machine... is it a problem for QGIS to have all those previously installed? should I uninstall my Python to use the binary?

When I execute PyQgis applications from the Python console that comes inside QGIS they DO PASS THE IMPORT LINE OF THE TROUBLE. So where in my installation you think the problem is?

Thank you,
Angelica.

You might need to make the window NonModal in the QDialog properties,
but the best solution is to probably add a command button to cancel the
window.

To follow up on that windowsflags seems to be what we're looking for.
Unfortunately different window managers: Aqua, XFCE, Gnome etc all do
things a little differently.
I found http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.5/widgets-windowflags.html
But haven't figured out where to change those in the qt designer yet.

Hi Borys

I'm not sure about the third tab. Because the 'entry' tab always refers to the 
active composer item. So it might be confusing to users if a third tab appears 
for composer maps only.

What about a separate dialog (accessible with a push button) for composer grid 
settings? Or other ideas how to deal with limited space in the 'entry' tabs?

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

geos sets the -ansi switch, and MinGW support
for strict ANSI mode seems to be somehow
broken.
Anyway, I was able to solve this issue while 
building geos for SpatiaLite acting as follows:

a) go to the MinGW C++ include dir
On my Windows XP this one actually is:

C:\MinGW\include\c++\3.4.5

b) edit the 'cwchar' file as follows:

161c161
<?? using ::swprintf;
---
>?? //using ::swprintf;
168c168
<?? using ::vswprintf;
---
>?? //using ::vswprintf;

c) after this simple change geos will build
?? with no problem at all (I hope ...)

bye

Or a separate dockable widget, accessible with the button (haven't I written 
about it already? - it would be more flexible but also more problematic, what 
to do with the button when the window is docked).

Nested tabs - probably the worst idea
Toolbox? - I don't like it too...

Anyway, there are a few pixels wasted on the top by a mysterious label and 
horizontal line.

Hi,

I've came across this issue too - installer silently ignores errors
due missing permissions when copying files. Since people are slowly
upgrading to vista and win7, the installer probably should get fixed
to avoid further confusion...

Hi Luca,

this functionality is present since 1.2:
- QgisInterface::registerMainWindowAction(QAction * action, QString
defaultShortcut)
- QgisInterface::unregisterMainWindowAction(QAction * action)

During plugin initialization you can register your action (which will
e.g. trigger the plugin window) with a default shortcut - user will be
able to alter it in configure shortcuts dialog. When unloading,
remember to unregister the action so it won't stay floating around :-)
Just beware that these methods are not available since 1.0 release, so
make sure to check QGIS version before using them.

Regards
Martin

Hi all.
Just found a few problems:
- when changing symbology for points, the buttons "random colours" and
"reset colours" from unique values do not seem to work
- when giving a very large number for font size (necessary when giving
dimensions in map units - meters), the window grows up enormously; a max
width should be set
- with single symbol, max dimension is 99, which is too low when using map
units (m)
Should I fill tickets?
All the best.

Message-ID: <633be2250910152019m41f32b62mf76d44a34f05a29f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I just upgraded to Ubuntu 9.10 beta and also upgraded from QGIS 1.2 to
QGIS to 1.3 from:

http://ppa.launchpad.net/qgis/unstable/ubuntu karmic main

Now I am receiving the following error when QGIS starts:

Couldn't load PyQGIS.
Python support will be disabled.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in
RuntimeError: the sip module implements API v6.0 but the qgis.core
module requires API v5.0

Python version:
2.6.4rc1 (r264rc1:75270, Oct 13 2009, 17:19:38)
[GCC 4.4.1]


Any suggestions on how to fix this?  I also noticed someone on the
Users list (via Nabble) having the same problem, but I am not
subscribed to that list so I thought I would post this here.

Thanks,

Matt

AFAIK you need to rebuild (no source changes) against current sip.

Message-ID: <d039b1400910160159j31addecdh7145f3b44a0938fb@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am a newbie about qgis I am trying to load a vector layer from a shape
file. I can load it from add layer button but can not load from the plugin I
am tryin to write. My code is below:


  def unload(self):
    # Remove the plugin menu item and icon
    self.iface.removePluginMenu("&Read shp for calculations",self.action)
    self.iface.removeToolBarIcon(self.action)
  # run method that performs all the real work
  def run(self):

    fileName =
QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(None,QString.fromLocal8Bit("Select a file:"),"",
"*.shp *.gml")
    if fileName.isNull():

      QMessageBox.information(None, "Cancel", "File selection canceled")

    else:


      vlayer = QgsVectorLayer( fileName, "hebe", "ogr")
      provider = vlayer.dataProvider()
      feat = QgsFeature()
      allAttrs = provider.attributeIndexes()
      provider.select(allAttrs)

      while provider.nextFeature(feat):
        geom = feat.geometry()
        print "Feature ID %d: " % feat.id()

This piece of code returns nothing to me. What is wrong here.

Thanks for help

Hi

first of all you should check whether the vector layer has been opened
correctly - this is the most common problem:
if not vlayer.isValid():
  print "Couldn't open the layer"

If the layer is valid and it still doesn't print anything, try doing
some checks - find out feature count etc.

I also don't need to call commitChanges(). How to solve?

Message-ID: <55388.193.246.86.39.1255692840.squirrel@webmail.carto.net>

Hi QGIS Developers,

In Hannover I proposed to include a forms-builder in an upcoming QGIS
version. In my opinion, flexible forms are a very important component of
GIS. Today it is the reason why one has to come up with self-written
python plugins just for the sake of more structured forms. Maybe if QGIS
could offer a more powerful forms solution it could make the need for
quite a few python plugins obsolete.

Somehow related is the aspect of database relations, foreign keys, etc.,
as forms would have to deal with database relations.

If you think there is room for a discussion on forms at the Hackfest in
Vienna, I would make an entry at the Wikipage of the Hackfest.

Thanks,
Andreas

Francesco,

Thanks for your response.

So, do you think that the karmic repositories will eventually be updated to
work with the the version of sip that ships with karmic?

I don't need python support right now so if it will probably be updated in
the near future I will just wait.

Thanks again.

Hi to all.Selecting feautures from qgis canvas, I can visualize data from
postgres. Then I wanna export a pdf report through reportlab.
If my script run as standalone, export correctly the report, but, if I
launch the script whithin my Qgis plugin (pyarchinit), it's impossible open
the pdf, which have 0 KB size. Only closing Qgis, the pdf result correct and
it's possible open it.

Does reportlab and Qgis have problems or it's my mistake?

A little video of the problem:

 I just ran the reportlab hello world code from the Qgis python
console and it worked okay:

from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
def hello(c):
 c.drawString(100,100,"Hello World")

c = canvas.Canvas("hello.pdf")
hello(c)
c.showPage()
c.save()

 Maybe there's some buffer not being flushed. Is this Windows? If you
do the above in Python (outside of Qgis) is the PDF file complete
after c.save() or do you need to quit python? That would make it a
reportlab/windows issue, and not a qgis problem.

Hi luca,

Just a thought: Does your plugin call save() (from reportlab) on the PDF
document that you are creating.
It sounds like something is not being flushed properly until you close QGIS?

+1 from me.

My idea would be the ability to assign a ui file to each vector layer.

This could be created using designer (there are also designer classes that
could probably be integrated into QGIS).  The widgets on the form should be
named like the attributes and have a type corresponding to the edit type.  That
form can then be loaded instead of the attribute dialog, but be initialized the
same.

We also discussed table joins, which would also fit in there (e.g. load foreign
keys from a table instead of a value map).

Yes, it is most likely that the package will be updated when karmic is
released and the chance of SIP changing again has gone away.

In the future keep in mind that unreleased versions of Ubuntu still in
the pipes probably will have similar issues with QGIS and many other
apps out there.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi all.
I'm getting several crashes while digitalizing. From the terminal:

ERROR 1: Attempt to read shape with feature id (-3) out of available range.
Segmentation fault

Warning: QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName: No matching signal for
on_btnHelp_clicked()

Difficult to replicate though, I'm on a course and cannot test more deeply
now.
All the best.

Here on qgis 1.3 from repo and Ubuntu 9.04 seems all ok (with the sample
spatialite dataset).

Alex,

I maybe came across wrong.  I know that there will likely be issues when
using beta versions... I don't mind messing around with it to try and get it
working.  And on that note, I tried to build from sources and am getting an
error.  I am using the following procedure:

1- apt-get install devscripts build-essential
2- apt-get source qgis
3- apt-get build-dep qgis (this will install all build dependencies needed)
4- cd qgis-1.3.0
5- debuild -us -uc

It fails on the debuild step (obviously I guess)

Here are the last few lines, I think this is where the errors start:

qgis-1.3.0 didn't support SIP 4.9.   I applied the changeset[1] from trunk and
uploaded a new version to our ppa[2].

Message-ID: <5b1890a50910161532h704b13b8r13a04240971e3e63@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I think I had "system" encoding on the list (when loading vector data)
but after updating today from osgeo4w I don't have it anymore and all
vectors go on default utf-8, corrupted of course.
If "system" encoding is to be removed permanently, it would be great
to add some info about particular encoding names, next to them in the
dialog list. If we want to stay user-friendly ;)
Who on earth remembers encodings? I mean besides us...
Some users don't even know such thing exists, we don't want to
discourage them at start.

Funny thing, it also magically dissapeared from my standalone
installation... how can they share dependances?

BTW, I used to have all QGIS versions from osgeo4w installer and they
worked fine. Now anything older than Daphnis crash at start. Perhaps
new python issue or something; just to let you know.

Best,
Milena

Anyone at FOSS4G that wants to demo QGIS to a crowd. I made sure QGIS
1.3 is installed with a whole bunch of common plugins including the R
interface and PostGIS tools.

There are also 2 premade projects, 1 using shapefiles and 1 using grass
data. They are in /usr/local/share/qgis on the Live DVD.

Unfortunately I will not be at the conference to do it.

Thanks,

good - editing forms with qt-designer and associating the ui-files with 
the vector layers would be great.

I added this as a discussion topic at the Hackfest Wiki - looking 
forward to the discussion and upcoming solutions to the problem.

Hi Milena

QGIS stores the last chosen encoding in the settings. It seems "System" is 
only used the very first time (if the setting is empty).

I remember there was a mail on the devel list some time ago about portability 
problems with "System" encoding. Maybe it was removed from the list because of 
that?

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Row selection on attribute table
Message-ID: <e32d76a10910171747s7cc68574qbce542a37885ba17@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

I think the row selection on attribute table could be better adding the
selection when dragging over the vertical header.  Also, I see the Ctrl and
Shift keys are not handled when the table view has not the focus, maybe this
can be changed.

Please take a look at ticket 1927 [1], there is a patch for this.

Regards.

I've installed qgis-1.0.2 and 1.3.0-3, but both don't find psycopg2 or rpy,
also if I trash psycopg2 Qgis folder. Suggestions??

Yes, I know - it worked until a couple of weeks ago, it doesn't work now
with trunk.

It's working here (import on Qgis Python console).  Do you get the  
same error about tz?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Which environement for Windows XP devt?
Message-ID: <35784.32986.qm@web110804.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello,
  I was a C programmer for many years, but havent done any for 10 years.
  I did dabble in C++, but never developped anything serious. 
  I did work seriously on C# for two years, quite recently.

  I'm back into some development (on QGis) and have no experience with Qt or any other development environment in Windows other than Visual Studio.

Now I want to develop with FOSS tools. Which C compiler would you recommend I get? Should I develop with MinGW or CygWin? Can I have both installed on the same machine.
Thankyou 
Henri

cygwin is not an option for QGIS.   But you can use MinGW (probably with
qtcreator).   But I'd stick with Visual C++ on Windows and build on top of
OSGeo4W.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] slow reading shp
Message-ID: <4ADCC3FC.5000200@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I found that reading large shapefiles (thousands of polygons) takes really a lot of
time, to the point that qgis is almost unusable.
This is a frequent complaint by users: can we do something about it? One data set we
could use for testing is the comuni layer from:
http://www.pcn.minambiente.it/PCNDYN/catalogowfs.jsp
http://wms.pcn.minambiente.it/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms_ogc/wfs/comuni_wfs.map
http://wms.pcn.minambiente.it/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms_ogc/wfs/comuni_wfs_f32.map
http://wms.pcn.minambiente.it/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms_ogc/wfs/comuni_wfs_f33.map
just go to the wfs (with the plugin) and save as shp (beware: non-free licence, you
cannot redistribute it).
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Composer grid issue
Message-ID: <BA581AE5-215B-4AD3-B68F-8F0707A8D952@gmail.com>

Marco,

I was excited to see the new map composer grid feature. I tried it out  
on some field maps last week and found out that the grids were not  
accurate. I believe you might be able to reproduce an error with the  
attached test file. It appears to be a dpi issue, for some reason.

Here are my steps:
1) Open a new qgis canvas and add the attached shapefile.
2) Verify that the projection (CRS) is set to epsg 26911 for the  
project.
3) Zoom in to a subset of the grid at approximately 1:100000 scale.
4) Open the map composer and add the map canvas to the composer canvas.
5) Turn on the composer grid with a 5000x5000 spacing.
6) Now, zoom in the map composer 4 or 5 times.
7) With the map layer selected, update the preview and note the offset  
between the two grids.
8) Output a png image at 300 dpi (should look correct).
9) Output a png image at 200 dpi (the offset should show).

On another note, it would be nice to be able to suppress the  
scientific notation of the grid labels. In the UTM example I have, the  
scientific notation is actually a larger label than the full integer  
value.

Cheers,
John

Hi John

Thank you for reporting. I'm currently implementing the possibility to rotate 
the composer map and this changes a lot in the composer grid code. Therefore, 
I'm going to address this issue after the rotation code is in trunk.

Regards,
Marco

print vlayer.featureCount()


if not vlayer.isValid():
print "Couldn't open the layer"

else:

provider = vlayer.dataProvider()
feat = QgsFeature()
allAttrs = provider.attributeIndexes()
provider.select(allAttrs)

while provider.nextFeature(feat):
geom = feat.geometry()
print "Feature ID %d: " % feat.id()

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Error with manageR (and python console)
Message-ID: <4ADDB371.2030103@gmail.com>

Hi!

I've just installed R (2.8.1), python-dev, rpy2 (through easy-install)
and manageR (qgis 1.3.0) on ubuntu 9.04 jaunty and get this
error after issuing any wrong command in the manageR console, i.e.:
> a = 1?
Error: unexpected end of input in "a = 1?"

and a window opens with:

An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "build/bdist.linux-i686/egg/rpy2/rinterface/__init__.py", line
108, in consoleFlush
     sys.stdout.flush()
AttributeError: QgisOutputCatcher instance has no attribute 'flush'

Python version:
2.6.2 (release26-maint, Apr 19 2009, 02:11:59)

I get the same error if I run the rpy2 test mentioned in
http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2/doc/html/overview.html#installation
in the qgis python console

import rpy2.tests
import unittest

# the verbosity level can be increased if needed
tr = unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity = 1)
suite = rpy2.tests.suite()
tr.run(suite)


Any idea on how to fix this?
Apparently, the rpy2 installation went ok.

Anyway, it was just an example - it happens with any large shp. It would be
good if we could keep a test large shp for benchmark.

This (big) shape for example

But it can be quite different depending on the rendering settings (anti-
aliasing, qpixmap or qimage) and the geometry type. E.g. the Qt raster paint 
engine is not so fast with large polygons. I think the pure shp size is not 
the only factor.

Hi Giovanni

It seems this is caused by the OGR library. Interrupting QGIS a few times with 
the debugger gives that the program spends much time in the function 
OGRLinearRing::isPointInRing (see debugger backtrace below).

Probably something you could report to the GDAL/OGR project.

cheers,
Marco

Good to know - however, it seems that other programs, also using OGR, do
not have the same problem (maybe we should test, eg udig or gvsig?).
All the best.

gvSIG opens the shape I linked before in a matter of seconds.

Folks,

It sounds like this is the code in OGR's shapefile driver for reading
polgyon rings and correctly assigning them as inner, or outer rings
and for which component of a multipolygon.

For some complex polygon files this can become quite expensive.

Depending on the version of OGR it may be possible to define
OGR_ORGANIZE_POLYGONS in the environment with the value SKIP to avoid
this work.  I'd appreciate your testing this to confirm this is the issue.

Best regards,

Hi all,

a little announcement, we've made a new version of our plugin. It
gives QGIS several tools for interacting with Google Earth. You can
quickly send a feature or the whole layer to GE keeping current layer
symbology or override it with your own one. Unique values and single
symbol legends are supported.

More info: http://gis-lab.info/qa/qgis2google-eng.html

It is tested and working under Windows/OSGeo4W/trunk and source code is available
for linux hackers.

Maxim

PS: I've recorded a video to have a look how it works, but it turned out
to be huge (100 mb) and I couldn't compress it to more reasonable size. You can still see
it, if this is not a problem for you.

If you need large MapServer layers featuring worldwide coverage, try
some of the "v0_"- or "cstest_"-layers at the FlightGear MapServer:

  http://mapserver.flightgear.org/

Global shapefile dumps of the respective VMap0 layers are here:

  ftp://ftp.ihg.uni-duisburg.de/FlightGear/TGShapes/

Explanations here:

  http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/LandcoverDB_VMap0_Detail


I'm not advertizing these resources without hidden motives, since
"we" (the FlightGear Scenery crew) also experiences slow/delayed
rendering of large layers in QGIS  ....  investigation in progress  ;-)

Cheers,

Maxim,

I make one script in Arcmap for Synchronized Google Earth with View map 
of ArcMap, it is in :
http://arcscripts.esri.com/details.asp?dbid=15944

The script is a VBA code, this made synchronized between windows arcmap 
with windows google earth, where, can move/zoom one windows and find 
this location in other windows.

I think make same for QGis, but, i wil use Python, because permit use 
COM tecnology, for C++ with QT , i believe i need have commercial license.
If you want help me,  we can make this funcionalty in QGis.

The VBA code you can read how calculate location for other.

You can see example in this site
http://www.scribd.com/doc/13427493/Sincronizar-layer-do-ArcGIS-com-o-Google-Earth
go to  last page for view the plugins runnig.

Hi Gary,

I had a talk with Jeff McKenna (of Mapserver-fame) about the 
mapserverexport(python) plugin.
I already made some changes in a local plugin, which can maybe make it 
into trunk version. See here for possible inclusions:
http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2009_Code_Sprint#QGIS_.2F_Mapserver

If people have idea's or other wishes please add to above wiki or let 
us know via this list.

Gary, you are obviously the 'owner' of the plugin, is it ok if we hack 
around in it? Or do you want us to make a shadowversion first which you 
can see first or so?

Another option:
http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2009_Code_Sprint#The_desktop_comparison_tasks_list
don't know if other people are here (Sydney) to be able to attend to 
that, or the community prefers that I attend that one.

Regards,
Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Frank

Thanks, this is a good hint. I tested it and the large polygons draw 
considerably faster now. It is still not fast, but it seems that this is a Qt 
problem with slow drawing of large polygons. QImage seems to handle that 
better than QPixmap. 

The following warings appear on command line. Probably the shapefile contains 
some defects?

Warning 1: Geometry of polygon of fid 150 cannot be translated to Simple 
Geometry. All polygons will be contained in a multipolygon.

Regards,
Marco

see the slash "\", it does an escape.

Try it with double shlashes ("\\") or inverted slash ("/").

It's a common error (I've made many mistakes with it :-) )

Hi Lutfi,

you can try this punch of code for starting:

from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer("c/temp/abc.shp", "hebe", "ogr")

print vlayer.source()

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)

QMessageBox.information(iface.mainWindow(), "info", "file:
"+str(vlayer.source())+" is added.")


regards,

volkan

Hi Barend,
I forward your request to the list, as you probably have submitted it only
to me.
Anyway I think you shouldn't have problems to compile it under your
platforms, the usual way it's done for the other plugins, as the CmakeLists
is provided in the svn.

I share your enthusiasm and gratitude. I want to mention that
Raster gdal utilities are an impressive addition, perhaps not from a 
developer point of view,  but it's a major step  forward in terms of 
functionality  for users. Adding these
raster functionality to QGIS makes a qualitative difference.
 
In general terms, perhaps it's time for a certain level-off of different
functionalities in QGIS, as while there are some
very advanced tools (i.e. manageR) that cannot be found elsewhere,
there are few critically missing tools. Among them:

1. A raster algebra with  a natural syntax (i.e. like r.mapcalc), and,
as a second step, a GUI. The current implementation has such an odd 
syntax that most
users using it early in their qgis learning would conclude that qgis is 
too complex and odd for them.
As far as I know, Barry is not thinking on further developing this tool.

2. A table manager tool able to operate among columns. Meanwhile, some 
kind of easy copy and paste
between an spreadsheet and qgis would be most helpful.

3. C++ implementation of the (vector) Tools, as a dissolve operation on 
a complex layer
takes hours to complete in qgis while seconds with other software (i.e. 
TNTmips) on
the same machine.

4. Improve the vector symbology system for continuous variables, in 
particular adding a
color bar to interpret the meaning of the resulting colors.

5. Improve the raster symbology system for continuous variables, adding a
color bar to interpret the meaning of the resulting colors.

6. Improve the raster symbology system for categorical variables (often
used for landcover maps produced from satellite imagery by classification)
through a colormap, and adding a
color bar to interpret the meaning of the resulting colors. Note that 
there are
several global-scale landcover maps in raster format in and the ability 
of qgis to
provide a good display of those would be an excellent presentation card.

In my opinion, these 6 improvements/additions are critical for the 
normal use of
QGIS as an operational GIS. Without them, I think we are still below the 
minimum
set of requirements for a GIS, even if in other aspects QGIS is very 
advanced.

Hi,

we already have the field calculator in trunk, it this what you mean?

agree, there is already a prof of concept patch in the trac for color
ramps, and I have suggested this matter for discussion for the next dev

are you referring to the performances of the operations made thorugh
the python ftools plugin? obviously they're times slower then any
other implementation in C/C++, mostly because of the slowness of the
python loop routines...
the 'analysis' in trunk should go that way, isn't it? (both for raster
and vector)

Sure. I think we should write down as many points as possible. What we cant't 
solve during the HF, we can at least address as future goals and set 
priorities.

My comments are based on the current qgis 1.3.0 Mimas
as installed from the ubuntu jaunty binaries on the ubuntugis
server. When you mention "trunk" I assume you mean
the current svn, right? Great to know
the field calculator is already there, as well as some
work on the symbology of continuous variables (raster and vector).
Looking forward to seeing them in the next binaries.

Hi, my name is Paul(South Africa) - I am a relatively new user...

I tried to install QGIS 1.3 Mimas on a new PC - OS is Win XP SP3.
When I try to start the program after installation, the following error came
up:

--
C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Mimas\bin\qgis.exe
This application has failed to start because the application configuration
is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem
--

I did try to reinstall, with the same results - does anybody have a
suggestion? 

Regards

Paul

I absolutely agree with you! I'm a geologist/soil scientist (as you),
and I prefer to concentrate on my research rather then learning build
systems and compile environments... I just do/try by myself in cases I
can't wait for a developer to build something for me :)

Sure. End users shouldn't build anything.
Please note however that windows users have now an excellent opportunity:
installing qgis-dev from osgeo4w gives you the latest qgis from previous
day, precompiled.
All the best.

I guess we need policy written out for C++ plugins, how users are
going to get them under Linux, what devs should do to make user's life
easier, may be a compilation guide for users etc.

Hackfest topic?

Another topic I'd be interested in for the hackfest is how to proceed for a

HI EVERYBODY,

Im creating a Qgis application. I need to pass to my code the map coordinates of my current zoomed-in view (need the actual corners in GWS to set the bounds of an image that will be further created in my code and then will be superimposed to this exact map area). I found QgsRect.xMax(), xMin(), yMax() and yMin()... and QgsRect.extent(). Is QgsRect the correct class? how should I use these functions if correct for my purpose? should I write them inside my zoomIn tool method after self.canvas.setMapTool(self.toolZoomIn)? none of my trials has worked... please I need guidance.

Thanks a lot
Angelica.

 In Python or C++? An application or a plugin? What version of Qgis?
It's probably worth moving to the latest 1.x series since that's where
all the developer work is (and there's lots of bugfixes and new
features).

> I need to pass to my code the map coordinates of my current zoomed-in view (need the actual corners in GWS to set the bounds of an image that will be further created in my code and then will be superimposed to this exact map area).

 I think QgsRect is now QgsRectangle in the latest Qgis - the API doc
will tell you what things are for:

http://doc.qgis.org/stable/classQgsRectangle.html

 All the "min" and "max" words are spelt out in full now too -
'xMinimum' and so forth.

 Although these are derived from C++, they translate easily to Python.
For QgsRectangle it says it is typically used for layer extents or
view extents, so right up your use case.

 If you're writing a map tool then you need to figure out how signals
work to trigger bits of your code when the user interacts - check out
some of the simple plugins that interact with the map to see how.

 Your map tool code will have to get the extent of the canvas from the
'iface' object that it gets when it first loads. If you do:

 ext = iface.mapCanvas().extent()

 then you get a QgsRectangle object that you can pass around. I'm not
sure at the moment if this is in projected coordinates though... You
may need to apply a transform... There's still a lot to do!

 You should sit down with some existing plugin code and really
understand how it hooks into Qgis!

Hi All,

Sorry to hijack the topic (and the dev x-post), but this thread  
prompted me to bring up a general issue with custom symbols. The  
current structure for adding new symbols on OS X is pretty poor  
(perhaps on other OS's as well?). It requires the user to copy the  
relevant svg files to a location inside of an application bundle.  
Hence, the changes have to be done with every update of the program.

It would be much better if there was an svg directory inside of the  
same directory where plugins are stored, ~/.qgis on OS X. This would  
maintain symbols across versions and new builds of the program.

For any hackfesters out there, perhaps this can make it on the todo  
list. If this possibility already exists, please correct me.

Regards,
John

Could I make an appeal to you not to write code that is locked to a
single platform (e.g. COM). We take great pains to make GIS run on all
platforms and using proprietary technology such as COM undermines this
effort and perpetuates Microsofts monopoly....

Of course it also cuts your potential user base to just those using
windows when you could be making software that us millions of Linux QGIS
could enjoy too...

Hi all.
This has been discussed several times. I think a mechanism analogous to the
py plugin installer would be the best, with the possibility of adding
symbols both from various repos and from local directories.
I think there should be a ticket open on this: could you please check, and
if not, add it?
Thanks.

Hi everyone,
As asked, I upgraded the qgsAffine plugin to work with versions 1.x. I've
tested it on ubuntu from ubuntugis repository.
Everything seems to be working as expected. Please mail me in case of
suggestions, problems or anything.
Thanks Borys for the advice.
It still had a problem from older versions of the API so I fixed it to work
only on editable layers.
I hope it helps.

Hello,

This yields error 404.

Is this still available?
Should the document be updated?

Barry, thanks for your answer.

>In Python or C++? An application or a plugin? What version of Qgis?

It is an application not a plugin, all in Python. I use the OSGeo4W version 1.0 Kore which runs fantastic in my WinXP. I tried 1.3 normal windows Qgis version but the installation did not work.
I have a full PyQt application which I have developed for so long (has my PhD dissertation underneath), I left the canvas part for the last task cause is what I know least, I already have the basic tools in and have checked out all available examples in the web.

Thanks... I was looking at an old API...

I'll try this now, but I have a question... isn't iface for plugins only? I believed it was to capture Qgis' built-in canvas to work with it from a plugin's code...

I have a question regarding transforms: when you apply a transform, I understand that Qgis will give me all values in the new system, but, DOES THE ACTUAL DRAWING CHANGE? it doesn't, right? I need to find a class (if exists) to build a tool that also changes the actual drawing (could be vector or raster) or I'll have to find new maps in UTM. Reason is that the results of my program are rasters in UTM projection and I need to superimpose them to a UTM-projected base map. Could you please help me out with this question, too?

The repo idea is covered in ticket 1063:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1063

Another good idea regarding organization of svg symbols is to have the  
sub-folders show up as available categories for users to select. This  
would allow subsets of icons to be viewable rather than all icons at  
once. You could still choose to view all at once, under the proposed  
idea:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1066

As there was no ticket that I could find specific to the idea of  
having user-provided svg symbols located in a location separate from  
the application or an application bundle on at least some OS's, I've  
created a ticket for that:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2027

John

Message-ID: <14ba7b970910230340i59461ebcu41cb4aae210c5320@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am new to QGIS, and I am trying to build an application.
I downloaded your tutorial it worked nicely even i was able to use
ZoomFullExtent, ZoomPrevious.
but when I tried "qgsmaptoolidentify" it gave an error as:

File "E:\project\viewer.py", line 158, in __init__
self.toolIdentify = QgsMapToolIdentify(self.canvas)
NameError: global name 'QgsMapToolIdentify' is not defined

I used the above stated header as:

self.toolPan = QgsMapToolPan(self.canvas)
self.toolPan.setAction(self.mpActionPan)
self.toolIdentify = QgsMapToolIdentify(self.canvas)
self.toolIdentify.setAction(self.mpActionIdentify)
self.toolZoomIn = QgsMapToolZoom(self.canvas,False)
self.toolZoomIn.setAction(self.mpActionZoomIn)
self.toolZoomOut = QgsMapToolZoom(self.canvas, True)
self.toolZoomOut.setAction(self.mpActionZoomOut)

def pan(self):
    self.canvas.setMapTool(self.toolPan)
def zoomIn(self):
    self.canvas.setMapTool(self.toolZoomIn)
def zoomOut(self):
    self.canvas.setMapTool(self.toolZoomOut)
def zoomFull(self):
    self.canvas.zoomFullExtent()
def info_(self):
    self.canvas.setMapTool(self.toolIdentify)

Please help me by giving any idea.
thanks in advance

regards.

Message-ID: <5d854a700910230640t4616abd2qc52c62c169e999a5@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,

I'm developing a tool using the great qgis api, but i've got some problems
to use some features, and after search a lot, I need your help. That are two
issues.

1 - I need to make an animation mode for raster images. So first, I've tried
to make a list with all raster images, and, using a QTimeLine, set them
visible or not. but the comand
QgsMapCanvasLayer(LayerSet.at(0)).SetVisible(FALSE); //Layerset is the
MapCanvas LayerSet.
it didin't work. So, to make the animation possible, I've had to replace the
current layerset of the mapcanvas, but this is too memory expensive. So why
possibly this setVisible didn't work?

2 - I need to make a pixel color transparent. I've achieved that using the
setNoDataValue, but what I really need is, instead of make the pixel
completely transparent, a transparency of, for example 50%. I've also tried
with this function:

   QgsRasterTransparency::TransparentSingleValuePixel myTransparentPixel;
    QList<QgsRasterTransparency::TransparentSingleValuePixel>
myTransparentSingleValuePixelList;

    myTransparentPixel.pixelValue = 0.0;
    myTransparentPixel.percentTransparent = 50.0;

    myTransparentSingleValuePixelList.append( myTransparentPixel );
    mRasterLayer->rasterTransparency()->setTransparentSingleValuePixelList(
myTransparentSingleValuePixelList );
    m_qgsImage->refresh();

but, it also didn't work.

Any Ideas?

Best Regards,

Sergio,

After either of these steps you would have to refresh the map canvas to 
see the changes, which would will mean redrawing all of the visible layers.

I don't know exactly how you are trying to implement this, but your best 
approach may be render each layer as an image ( "off screen" ) then have 
your application/plugin cycle through these images instead of using the 
map canvas, if that is what you are doing.

The transparency block looks fine at first glance ( you can use 
qgsrasterlayerproperties.cpp as an example if you have not already ) but 
take in mind you have to apply that to _each_ raster layer after it has 
been initialized.

Hash: SHA1

Hi Devs

I've been working a little on implementing some render caching to make
QGIS feel more responsive and avoid unnecessary re-rendering of layers
when nothing has really changed.

I've finished writing a simple caching mechanism and would like to ask
you to a) test and b) indicate if you are happy for this to go into trunk.

The patch is here

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/attachment/ticket/1974/qgis_rendercachepatch_v7_23Oct2009.diff

Note that caching is disabled by default - you need to enable it in the
Options dialog, rendering tab.


Regards,

Sergio you could also use the new caching mechanism I have written in

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1974

and then draw you changes onto the layer cache. When you call
mapCanvas->refresh() the draw will be very fast as it (QGIS) will simply
need to composite the layer caches.

Tim

Unfortunately there's no python bindings for this tool. AFAIK you can either 
use the QgsMapToolEmitPoint tool or build your own tool class on the abstract 
QgsMapTool (the latter is what I would do - take the clickfu or profiletool 
plugins as an example) and then use the coordinates to find features.

a) Works fine with rasters (including WMS - now tiling would be great! :D ) 
with one small issue - no refreshig after layer opacity chage.

b) of course +1

Hi Tim

Wow, this is really cool and speeds up rendering in many situations.

Now that every layer has its QImage to paint on, it might be a possibility to 
render each in its own thread and have great performance on todays quad core 
machines.

Regards,
Marco

good - will test this next week.

Marco - do you think the separate QImages could help us with my layer 
masking proposal - to be discussed in Vienna or at one of the upcoming 
hackfests?

Thanks,
Andreas

Very nice Tim!

+1 from me, speed is nice, didn't test with rasters though...
Rendering each layer on it's own makes turning them on
and off very responsive, nice work!

I remember chatting to Martin about this at the last hackfest. His main
concern was that providers are not thread safe so we could run into
issues e.g. try to run two threads on the same ogr datasource.

I have further plans for the caching system to that can realise speed
improvements when panning and zooming in.

I guess from the feedback there are no objections to me committing this
patch.

Tim

I think this concern was as we discussed layer tyling and rendering each tile 
of a layer in a thread. 
If a whole layer renders in a thread, we shouldn't have this problem because 
each layer has its own datasource object instance.

Marco

Ah great! If this is the case it would be something well worth trying
(maybe at the hackfest?).

Yes, it is a prerequisite.

One problem with masking on raster level is that everything is rasterized and 
so printing to vector svg / pdf will not be possible (or only with image 
caching turned off and therefore without masking).

Marco

Hi 

I'm new to QGIS. I'm writing a C++ application and would like to use QGIS to calculate the distance between two WGS84 lat/long points. Can anyone point me towards code examples or documentation which describes which QGIS classes I need to use and how to use them? 

Thanks, 
Paul.

Hi Paul


Take a look at

http://doc.qgis.org/head/classQgsDistanceArea.html

in particular:

double measureLine( const QgsPoint& p1, const QgsPoint& p2 );

Regards

Tim

Hello,

I have a Mapserver configured for WMS.

If in the .map file there are some PostGIS layer,
you need to copy the EXTENT key on the mapfile definition on each PostGIS
LAYER definition in the mapfile.

QGIS seems that is not able to detect the extend of a WMS layer of a
PostGIS spatial table.

This problem doesn't occur with shapefiles.

Hope it will help someone that had same problem.

Tim,

The plugin i wrote have very peoples use them. It?s simple plugin but 
help interpret satellite images for user proprietary software.

This year i change for all GIS tools to free software, but, not simple 
change, not change only software, change relation with tecnology 
information, where,
the user go to pass the consumer to collaborator.

When i want collaborate to Qgis, i need hear community, what is better 
for all, in this point, you showed the most principle, to be free.

First time i think make plugins for QGis "Synchronized Google Earth" , i 
could, i used Python binding COM with GoogleEarth, but,
i think about no users Windows, this job don?t have usefulness, i 
aborted this idea. When other peaple make plugin for Google Earth, i 
think could be the good continue job, i put this idea for community.

At now i think use QtWebKit Module, them, i can show other database 
images and synchronized with QGis, this is other history, i need study 
more about this.

Thank?s Tim for your message.

Hi William

Hm, that does not happen here. Is the compile error still there after r11850? 
If yes, on which line?

In case I have a multi-band raster, how do I select one band?
I mean, which would be the equivalent to
layer1 = iface.mapCanvas().layer(0)
?

Thanks!

Plugin scattergram requires python-qwt5.
As the available binaries of python-qwt5-qt3 5.1.0 for ubuntu jaunty
cannot be installed because rely on python < 2.6,
I've compiled PyQwt v5.2.0 according to:
http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/doc5/installation.html

Nevertheless, the plugin installer still complains that
"this plugin requires a missing module (Qt5)"

Any idea on what to do?

Dear Agus,

I think you can use PIL, Split the band and save the individual bands as
separate raster and load them acoording to your wish.

Hope this solves your problem.

The QGis documentation for version 1.0.2 has a section that starts as following
?
16? Creating C++ Applications
Not everyone wants a full blown GIS desktop application. Sometimes you want to just have a widget
inside your application that displays a map while the main goal of the application lies elsewhere. Per-
haps a database frontend with a map display? This Section provides two simple code examples by
Tim Sutton. They are available in the qgis subversion repository together with more interesting tuto-
rials. Check out the whole repository from: https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/code_examples/
?
Unfortunately the link provided is not valid.
?
I'm on WIndows XP.
Now I started off hoping I could develop this application just like an ordinary Qt application, using QMake. 
Am I deluded? Do I have to learn CMake?
?
All attempts I have tried have generated lots of compiler errors.
Now I have peeked into a file CMakelists.tx?that suggests that CORE_EXPORT should be defined as __declspec(dllexport)
and the same definition for GUI_EXPORT
(but this is a guess)
?
Are there any other defines?
On Tim Sutton's blog someone suggested that there be a define
QGISPLUGINDIR=$${QGISPLUGINDIR} CORE_EXPORT= GUI_EXPORT=
This is contradictory with my __declspec(dllexport) (for the last two) and i cant find any occurence of QGISPLUGINDIR
?
Thankyou

Hi Henri

Hm, the link https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/code_examples/ works for me.

Yes, you may use qmake. Just link your application with libqgis_core.dll and 
maybe with libqgis_gui.dll

>CORE_EXPORT= GUI_EXPORT= 
is for Linux where you don't need any dllexport macros

>CORE_EXPORT
> should be defined as __declspec(dllexport) and the same definition for
> GUI_EXPORT

Yes, on windows with msvc, you need to define those export macros.

Marco

__declspec(dllexport) is only useful when building the libraries, because those
export the symbols.  Everywhere else you need __declspec(dllimport).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Hackfest 2009
Message-ID: <4AE87582.8040602@gmail.com>

Hi to all attending the Hackfest 2009 in Vienna/Austria!

Just a short summary ..

First meeting (just for the impatient) is on 5th of November (Thursday 
evening)
I already have the keys to the University and we can look where all the 
nice places and things we are allowed to use are.
I'd like to suggest that we meet in front of the University (Big 
red-yellow brick building .. 1190 Wien, Peter Jordan Strasse 82) at .. 
let's say 5:00 P.M. (public transport 10A, 40A, 37A - unfortunately only 
busses go there but I'm sure you'll manage it)

The official "opening" of the Hackfest is on Friday Morning at 9:00 A.M. 
with a short introduction and welcome from the head of the institute Dr. 
Reinfried Mansberger.
I still hope that I can make some friend of mine to do a professional 
tour through the old town of vienna on friday evening.
Saturday and Sunday we're more or less "alone" at university so no 
student should "disturb" us ;)
On monday I think a lot will already leave the Hackfest - so I plan to 
do some "recapitulation" in the morning and would like to end the 
hackfest officially at "high noon" - of course if your flight or train 
is leaving later we can still sit together for hacking or chatting ..

So thats the plan from my side
Every evening I'll look if people want to go for lunch(dinner) together 
and reserve some restaurant near university .. (depends how many would 
take part)

Any suggestions - any problems - any other things -> just drop me an email

hope to see you soon

regards
Werner (the big organizer ;) )

Hi all.
A couple of problems on Windows Vista:
- when loading a shapefile, an error is thrown (non-existing path)
- on trunk, it gives an error on installation (module postgis-something
cannot be loaded).
All the best.

Both problems do not exist in earlier versions, again on Vista.
Thanks.

Apparently this can be solved by putting "" around the path.
Still a bug, I believe.
All the best.

Hi John

Do you still have the issue with the shift between composer map contents and 
the composer grid with current svn?
I did some prints with the nv_grid shape  this morning (to png, 200 dpi) and 
it seemed to be ok.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

Excellent work with the grid composer. Things lined up in a new test I  
ran, so it appears you have handled the offset issue.

For some reason, my old project now crashes if I try to open in qgis.  
I suspect this might be from changes in the composer structure for qgs  
files, but not certain.

The control over precision and the option for labels following  
boundary direction are brilliant! Great work, as usual.

New issues from the other changes I have seen so far:

1) If there is no composer, the "Map Composer" menu item is empty.  
Perhaps this should be a submenu under "File" rather than it's own menu?

2) If I try to close my composer window, I am confronted with a dialog  
that says, "Do you really want to remove the composer instance,  
'name'?" Canceling will keep the composer, but you have the window  
occupying desktop space. If you say ok, the composer is gone for good.  
My expectation would be to close the window, receive no dialog, but  
have that composer available under the "Map Composer" menu item.  
Perhaps this is a work in progress.

Also see https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2042

Cheers,
John

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis directory or Qgis-dev?
Message-ID: <580163.607.qm@web110806.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi 
?I installed qgis osgeo (version 1.0.2) and my installation created a directory at c:\osgeo4W
?Now I havent seen any explanation of the directory structure. Is this documented?
?I want to run the examples referred to here 
https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/code_examples/
The find*.cmake files need to be adapted, concerning paths?and some of the files they are supposed to be looking for have two occurences, for example
northarrowplugin.dll
(by the way the CMake file refers to libnortharrowplugin.dll, so it seems out of sync with the current state of filenames, but I'm a cmake newbie)
?
in any case there are subdirectories
C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-dev
and
C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis
?
the latter does not have an include subdirectory so I'm going to guess I should stick to qgis-dev
?
Am I going the right way?
Should I be doing all of this with a more recent version of QGis?
Thankyou 
Henri

Werner,

It sounds like you have everything in place for a great event. As a  
non-attendee, I will do my best to look in from the outside that  
weekend. I will not be around on Friday due to travel, but I will  
catch up on the irc logs and any blogging to see what can be tested or  
suggested.

Best to all,
John

Hi John

Good to hear that the offset issue seems to be fixed now.

Oh, this should not happen. Project reading should be backwards compatible. 
Unfortunately, it does not crash with my test projects. Could you send me the 
project file for testing?

I'll do that. Though the problem might be that users don't find it easily at 
this place. I'll wait what the feedback on the list is.

Yes, the behaviour is different now because it is possible to have multiple 
composers in a project. The composers are deleted on window close (similar to 
most apps that are deleted on main window close). Otherwise the user cannot 
get rid of composer instances. You could minimize the window to have more 
screen space.
An option would be to have the close button and menu entry back that minimises 
(or even hides?) the composer window.

Regards,
Marco

Marco,

I forgot to mention the lack of icon in the toolbar, but you must  
already know this.

I will send you something separately, although there are too many big  
files to send the base layers as well. Perhaps you can reproduce  
without the map data.

Yes, this sounds good. There was some conversation about trying not to  
get too many main menu items. To me, having it under File would seem  
fairly logical as Print functions are also there.

I suppose this will necessitate the use of template saving. I had been  
content to simply have a composer "project" stored in the qgs file,  
but will have to rethink my workflow. This is not an issue, just a  
matter of fact.

Thanks,
John

The crashing issue may be specific to that project, perhaps a  
symbology issue. I was able to open several other project files  
without crashing, but a new and more serious issue has arisen. Now,  
opening the a project brings a map composer window to the screen as  
well as the canvas. This composer window cannot be minimized or  
closed. Worse, it causes Mac OS X Finder, Dock, and Spaces to all  
cease functioning. Essentially, it paralyzes the OS X gui. Quitting  
qgis does not fix this. The only solution I have found is to logout  
and log back in to restore gui functionality.

I should add that I am using qt-4.6-beta, so it would be great if  
another Mac user with a more conservative qt environment could test  
this and see if it happens for them. The key is having an existing  
qgis project.

Beyond that, I do not have much information to provide that may help  
uncover this. We can try to work on this off-list if you would like.

Regards,
John

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Field Calculator Problem
Message-ID: <10f4de780910301138i2ffc3c1fiebb2b903cd4ad51f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've come across a problem with the field calculator.  I'm using QGIS
1.4.0.39 via OSGEO4W on an XP box.  Here's the issue:

When using field calculator to "Only Update Selected Features," all
_unselected_ features (incorrectly) get a value filled.  For example, if I
create a new field, and set it equal to an existing field, the selected
features get updated properly. However, all other features get the value of
the first selected feature.

Cheers,

Darren Cope

Hi Darren

Thanks for reporting. I filled a ticket 
(http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2044).
As soon as I commit the changes to disk, the values seem to be normal again. 
Also the identify tool shows correct results. Probably an issue with the 
attribute table and not-commited values.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Which compiler should I use to build example code?
Message-ID: <823294.80831.qm@web110809.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello,
? I'm still trying to get the first sample code to compile and link. 
They are here:
https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/code_examples/
?
I downloaded version 1.0.2 for windows from here http://qgis.org/en/download/binaries.html
and on that page it's said it's a MSVC build. When I try to build with my Visual C++ express I get the following message at link time.

C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-dev\bin\QGis_core.dll : fatal error LNK1107: invalid or corrupt file: cannot read at 0x328
Does this mean it was built with GCC?
The compilation guide by Marco Pasetti suggests that we use MinGW.
Are both options quite viable?
yours truly
Henri
?
?

Hi

Which specific example are you trying to build? You should be able to build with msvc assuming you have LIB_DIR set to an osgeo4w installation the includes all the needed div libs.

Tim

Hi all.
Hackfest is coming - looking forward to meet you!
For those who have been applied for financial support, I would:
- remind that it is *necessary* to keep all the receipts for which you want
a refund
- as you to confirm your presence, and the amount requested, by dropping me
a mail in private.
Thanks a lot, and see you soon.

Hi

Please don't write to me off-list. The mailing list is there to share
knowledge and spread workload - sending me messages privately
countermines both goals.

OK. You need to build it using CMake. Standard procedure should be
(guessing a little because I'm a linux user):

Install osgeo4w into the standard location (c:\osgeo4w) including all
developer libs
Use your system properties to export the LIB_DIR environment var to
point to c:\osgeo4w
enter the tut dir
mkdir build
cd build
cmakesetup ..
configure (c)
generate (g)
nmake

Windows gurus please chip in where I have gone wrong above...


> As for the term div lib, I dont know what you mean. I am handicapped by the fact that I have been out of C & C++ programming for over a decade until a week ago :(.

Sorry that was a typo, I meant dev (ie developer) libs.

I just made some small tweaks to tuts 1-4 so please update from svn
when you get the chance.

Tim
