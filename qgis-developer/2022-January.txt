Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Funding and PR review
Message-ID: <CAOM0XWBSfQwGv3VaJyf-4_hk27ZNhnzdNTpqBeR=AYBegyvo6A@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings Everyone,

Some points have been going through my head and I was curious to know if
there could be good ideas in them for discussion and opportunities.

One aspect that can irk new and existing contributors (or maybe just
myself) is when it comes to PR reviews. As some work on either side is done
on a voluntary basis we can't expect competent and overworked devs to want
and to dedicate more time on some work that won't benefit them.

On the other hand we also get pr that get stuck or staled out.

Now I was thinking of creating a crowdfund to raise some funds for reviews
( I don't want to profit monetarily from any of my work). But I don't want
to be stuck managing funds and doing PR and etc.

Now I know that QGIS has some devoted funds for bugfixing and PR reviews to
this effect. But I was curious to know if it would be a good idea to
advertise the work (possibly in the news feed?) that would benefit from
bugfixing or PR reviews.

I'm not sure if dividing things and separating funds on a issue or category
(bugfix vs feature vs ?) would be beneficial. But showcasing what they can
gain from doing a contribution would probably be helpful rather than giving
for general support.

Just my two cents, I also wish everyone a good new year of developping!

Alex

Hi Felix,

Appreciate your alternative solution. I could make some degree of
performance improvement.

Thanks a lot for your help, mate.

Hi Alex,

Happy new year to you as well!

We increased the funding for PR reviews from 10 to 14k.

However, it is up to the reviewers (currently Nyall, Matthias and
Alessandro, in the future probably also Martin) to decide what PRs they are
looking at. I understand that the above figure doesn't guarantee that they
can look at all PRs.

My recommendation for new devs is to personally ask one of the above people
- or another QGIS dev with core commiter rights.

In general, for paid new developments, the developer who offers the new
functionality should factor in the cost of code reviewing in the quote.

For voluntary contributions it may be more difficult. There it probably
depends a lot on the quality of the PR and the willingness of the dev to
respond to the reviewers in a timely manner. And of course - if the PR is
interesting to one of the reviewers, it increases the chance a lot.

I am not sure if a separate crowd funding for PR reviewing would be the way
to go. I would imagine it would be difficult to raise funds specifically
for this goal. I would rather prefer to try to get more "sustaining
members" in general, so we can increase this budget item in upcoming years.

Let's see what other core devs and PSC members think abou this?

Andreas

Hi,

Just a quick followup on this: we briefly discussed this topic within the
PSC and the conclusion was that this is not a PSC matter.

Kind regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] pyqtSlot decoration problems with layerChanged in
 Python 3.10
Message-ID: <b4d3cace-5099-88df-87a4-3ec8de0ab785@gmail.com>

Hi everyone!

I've developed some Qgis plugins, everything was fine until I updated 
Python to 3.10 version, some of these plugins have problems with the 
/pyqtSlot/ with the function /layerChanged/, an example code:

    self.myLayerComboBox.layerChanged.connect(self.myConnectMethod)
    @pyqtSlot(QgsMapLayer) def myConnectMethod(self, layer) ??? ...

The error is:

    TypeError: decorated slot has no signature compatible with
    layerChanged(QgsMapLayer*)

My question is: if that is a Qgis bug? or that pyqtSlot no longer 
necessary? or has the syntax changed for that decorator?

That error don't happen with Python < 3.10. Using Qgis 3.22.2 on Archlinux.

Thanks!

Xavier

Alessandro,

Thank you for raising the subject.

QGIS on conda is not at is best shape right now, as we are stuck with the
lack of a full featured Qt 5.15. The current package is lacking webengine
that was split. The good news is it's already built on OSX arm64 which may
be useful in the future.

maintaining the OGC compliance for QGIS server is a very time consuming
undertaking that up to now was completely relying on the volunteer work of
very few community members. Unfortunately R?gis cannot follow this anymore
(Thanks a lot R?gis for all the work you put in!).

We therefore are looking for community members to take over the lead on
this.

Ideally, we'd also like to see organisations that rely on QGIS server
certification to step-up financially to support the big workload needed.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me

Cheers
Marco

Greeting Andreas,

Thanks for the reply, what I simply wanted to propose was to advertise in
some way how users and sustaining members would benefit from more funding.

If we could use standing issues and standing PR as showcases of how funds
could benefit the project, that might entice some to contribute.

I'm fully aware of the current review process and I think it's ok as it is.
The increased funding is a welcome news and hopefully it'll be sufficient
in the short term.

Thanks again!

Alex

Considering that I already take care of the underlying "technical
infrastructure" for the OGC compliance (server admin,
QGIS-Server-CertifSuite,
...), I propose to also take care of the formal request.

What do you think?

It'd be nice :).

Hello,

Sorry for the repeat, I've also posted this on the user list.

Quick question, is there a conda release schedule?  I see that 3.18.3 is
the latest release that is currently in Conda.  Is there some timeline laid
out for when new releases hit Conda Forge?

Thanks,
Eric

we don't provide official packages for Conda. These are maintained by
some community members on a volunteer basis.

Hi Eric,

Alexandre Neto is one of the conda feedstock developers. Two days ago he 
wroted in another discussion:

 > QGIS on conda is not at is best shape right now, as we are stuck with 
the lack of a full featured Qt 5.15. The current package is lacking 
webengine that was split. The good news is it's already built on OSX 
arm64 which may be useful in the future.

Before this Qt issue, conda QGIS releases usually followed official QGIS 
releases with a small delay of? ~0-2 weeks.

Eheh I am not really a developer ^^ I just try to keep a LTR branch on
conda-forge, but most of the time real maintainers solve the problems.

But, yes. Starting on QGIS 3.20.x it's needed a more recent version of Qt5
than the one that is provided by conda-forge. There are not many hands to
work on the Qt builds and it's quite complex, therefore the work is going
quite slowly.

There's already a Qt5.15 build but now we are missing another components,
we need to be patient... As Alexander said, it's all based on volunteers
work.

Once that is solved, we should be back to regular releases not much time
after the Oficial QGIS releases.

Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

Dear developers,

In 2022, we'll be able to publish the call for proposals for the grant
programme earlier than usual. Please expect the official call
notification (email and blog post in January rather than February. (For
process details, see https://github.com/qgis/PSC/issues/57)

By moving the call opening date up by one month, we want to make it
easier to ensure that funded projects can be finished within the same
calendar year. This is important to help us with the volunteer work
involved in monitoring the programme and doing QGIS.org accounting.

Regards,

Anita

Dear QGIS Community

This is a call for nominations for new QGIS community voting members.
Please read the instructions carefully and establish your eligibility to
vote which I repeat here for your convenience:

"Only community members with commit rights to an official QGIS git
repository or with write access in transifex are eligible to make
nominations.?

The nomination form is here.

https://forms.gle/TuWquriDLZqAHQZF9

Incoming community voting members will be selected based on the number of
nominations they receive. The above form will close on 23.01.22.

If you play an organisational role (e.g. documentation lead, translation
lead), please forward this email to your committers.

A larger version of the diagram included in the form is also available here:

If you have any questions about the process please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Thank you,

Message-ID: <7102d6fb-9c06-88e2-75d7-d7fd3ac6ed87@duif.net>

Hi Devs/Community,

Currently I receive csv data in which the geometry is encodes as EWKT:
   "SRID=4326;POINT (4.679683985851895 51.67410641976929)"
instead of WKT:
   "POINT (4.679683985851895 51.67410641976929)"

The normal csv/delimited text provider does not handle this (?)

And QgsGeometry does not have export/import methods for it [0]?

Ale's QuickWKT plugin can handle it though, just by removing the SRID part [1]

So Question: is EWKT something to be discouraged?

OR is it something that is worth to add to QGIS?
(In the csv provider it would set the crs automagicaly)

Any input appreciated.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

This has recently been discussed in the context of the postgis:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/45007#discussion_r706526454

Is there a definition of what the SRID code in EWKT means without the
context of an srid database like postgis has. Is it always an EPSG code?

Thanks Matthias for your input.

Mmm, this page [0] says:

"The EWKT format is not an OGC standard, but an PostGIS specific format that includes the spatial reference system (SRID) identifier"...

To be honest I was not even aware that it was PostGIS specific... In the world of "in excel or txt file exchanging peeps", EWKT is mostly just to distinct between latlon and national crs...

And in SRID:4326 I always silently read EPSG:4326...
But you are probably right: it is always SRID... would be better to have 'REGISTRY':4326, so it can be EPSG:4326 or QGIS:4326 etc etc

I would be in favour of having such a OGC spec with proper definition...

And if that in place: please call it by it's name: toEWKT and fromEWKT (and not the 'stringToReferencedGeometry' proposal :-) )

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Could Spack or Linuxbrew/Homebrew be used to create QGIS installers on Mac
OS? While these tools can also be used under WSL, I believe Spack will be
providing a native build support on Windows in the near future.

Message-ID: <32d387f7-b34f-7f2a-bf80-5a0bae93e5a9@duif.net>

Hi All,

Using the geom_to_wkt-expression to create a WKT string of my point layer in QGIS I see:

'Point (4.67931032 51.67420959)'

should this not be

'POINT (4.67931032 51.67420959)'  ?

that is: all capitals?

That is what I'm used to, what wikipedia shows [0]
Postgis creates with St_AsText: [1]

But according to gis.stackexchange [2] it is define as a OGC standard
  06-103r4  [3]
And there there is no notion of caps or not...

Others have an opinion?
Others have seen the QGIS version in the wild, outside of QGIS
Else I would propose to follow the Postgis standard?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all,
KAP files (e.g. [0]) are supported by GDAL[1], and indeed they are
opened fine in QGIS (projection is  shown as unknown in my tests, but it
is laced correctly). They are however not shown in the browser nor in
the data source manager. Is this a bug, or there is a valid reason for this?
Thanks.

It's a GDAL bug -- see https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/5083 for a fix

Great, thanks a lot Nyall. I have seen the ambiguity between BSB and
KAP, so that was the cause.
All the best.

Hi Paul,
Thanks a lot for stepping up, we couldn't wish better!

I still think that organisations for which the certification is important
should step-up financially, and we^ll still work in that direction.

Probably the best is if you get in touch directly with me and R?gis to see
how to move things forward.

Cheers
Marco

Hi list,

is there a way to specify the minimum Qt version for a plugin? I saw 
nothing in metadata.txt which would be the preferrable way because 
otherwise I'd need to throw a dialog into the user's face after 
installing. :\

Thanks, Hannes

Hi Hannes,

There is no such thing available currently.
If you know which OS your users run on you can use the QGIS version as an
indicator.

Hey Matthias,

that is an interesting idea. Is there an overview of the official 
builds' versions and Qt versions somewhere? For now I decided to check 
the Qt version in the plugin's run method. It's not the best as the user 
will only find out when they want to run it, but it is only meant as a 
temporary fix anyways.

Thanks, Hannes

Hallo Johannes,

here you have an example of version checks in the *classFactory()* itself
(file *__init__.py* of your plugin).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Pip install not working within QGIS with OSGeo4W
 v2?
Message-ID: <CAJj=OAqj0ue9PDVz0nW_VfNZf9BnFJbm_0977k_PFUipg1Xb4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi dev team,

I might have missed something but I can't get "pip install" to work within
QGIS I've tried a few different options on a couple of different windows
computers.

I use matplotlib, psycopg2 and reportlab within my plugin and I have some
simple code that installs the packages for the users:

import sysimport platformimport subprocesstry:
    import matplotlibexcept ModuleNotFoundError:
    print('installing matplotlib')
    if platform.system() == 'Windows':
        subprocess.call([sys.exec_prefix + '/python', "-m", 'pip',
'install', 'matplotlib'])
    else:
        subprocess.call(['python3', '-m', 'pip', 'install', 'matplotlib'])

But I get:

WARNING: pip is configured with locations that require TLS/SSL, however the
ssl module in Python is not available.

WARNING: Retrying (Retry(total=4, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None,
status=None)) after connection broken by 'SSLError("Can't connect to HTTPS
URL because the SSL module is not available.")': /simple/matplotlib/

I can install the packages from the OSGeo4W shell (after removing the path
to a local pip server) but it would be nice if they could be installed
automatic for the users (which works fine with QGIS installed by OSGeo4W
v1..).

Have I missed some change or is this a bug? (can someone else confirm it?)

Hi Axel,

I tried with the "xlxswriter" module :

    - in QGIS 3.16.15? => same error as you ;
    - in QGIS 3.18.3 => success

Therefore it seems to be a bug in QGIS 3.16 ...

Have a nice day ...
Jean

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Freeze exemption for 3D map view docking PR?
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFdiHuW5Ec0Q7hasy0YvSCHh9e9muH+mLoYhvZ7zZO65jA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I would like to ask if we could have the pull request to add
docking/undocking of 3D map views exempt from today's feature freeze. The
work is nearly done, there are just few bits to finish early next week.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/46770

The rationale is that this would tie up very well with the other major
usability improvements for 3D views which made it to 3.24: better camera
control & keeping a list of 3D map view in project like print layouts.

Cheers
Martin

Hi all,

I would like to ask for a freeze exemption for the aforementioned PR.
The work is complete (except for a MingW build failure).
It misses a final review (first part has been partially reviewed).

See https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/46687

Hi Cory,

We don't offer targeted donations where you can influence a specific bug
fix. If you need that - please contact one of the QGIS commercial support
providers - see
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/commercial_support.html

Primarily one of the "core contributors".

What specific issue do you want to see fixed?

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS and Fedora: My tips
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash0QH_ct_WARUjQea3OK7JFw-fUcYL0iCn9GHtNGbb99g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Been hitting some pain points with using/developing QGIS under Fedora
recently, so I thought I'd summarise the solutions I've found for
these issues here in case they are of use to anyone else!

(Quite possibly these issues also affect other Linux distros too)

Messed up file open/save dialog window stacking
-----
The issue here is that file dialogs (like the open/save file dialogs)
will frequently open BEHIND the parent window. This one isn't a
paper-cut, it's a full-on amputated limb and was driving me insane.

The root cause of this is that the gtk implementation of the "file
chooser" portal specification is buggy, at least for Qt applications.
I couldn't solve this one, couldn't get upstream to acknowledge, so I
gave up and found the following hacky solution which completely
disables the file chooser portal for the system.

Edit /usr/share/xdg-desktop-portal/portals/gtk.portal as root, and
remove the "org.freedesktop.impl.portal.FileChooser;" string from the
"Interfaces=" line.

This will force the system to use the standard GTK file chooser
instead of the sandboxed portal one. It fixes the broken file dialog
window stacking (yay!) but as a side effect will completely break ALL
file dialogs used by sandboxed (e.g. flatpak) applications.

For me that's an acceptable compromise (I don't use any flatpak
applications).. but make your own judgement call here :)

(As an added bonus: the file chooser portal specification is quite
limited, and doesn't support things like showing a "save as" file
dialog which **doesn't** warn about overriding existing files. As a
result things don't work nicely in QGIS, and you'll get UI gremlins
like the "save vector layer" dialog incorrectly warning that an
existing GPKG file will be overwritten even though you're only
appending a new layer to that file, not overwriting it).


Debug sessions of QGIS just "hang"
----

I noticed this one after upgrading to Fedora 35. Trying to run any
session of QGIS under a debug environment (eg. gdb) just resulted in a
hang at startup.

I tracked this one down to this change:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/DebuginfodByDefault, where
Fedora 35 enables "debuginfod" by default.

debuginfod is supposed to be a helpful thing which downloads debug
info on demand. The "hang" during startup of QGIS debug is actually
just debuginfod trying to download all the debug info for libraries
used by QGIS. BUT... it's an INSANE amount of data it's trying to
download. debuginfod is trying to download debug info for every single
library used by QGIS recursively. Which results in it trying to even
download debug info for webkit, which is so large that I could never
get the download to ever complete!!! Even worse, debuginfod defaults
to auto-deleting all downloaded debug info on a weekly basis.... so if
you were super-patient and waited for this to download then you'll
just have to go through the same thing again in a week.

Solution: disable debuginfod, by unsetting the DEBUGINFOD_URLS
environment variable. Debug sessions of QGIS will start just like they
always used to.


Bad coloring of unfocused UI elements
------
There's an annoying issue under recent gnome/gtk releases where
unfocused UI elements in Qt applications are incorrectly styled with
the "inactive window" coloring. This results in widgets like lists,
tree views, and dock child widgets showing as though they are disabled
whenever they aren't the currently focused widget. (It's described
upstream here https://github.com/FedoraQt/adwaita-qt/issues/126)

I couldn't find a proper fix for this one, so I've just submitted a
gross hack to QGIS to completely disable the inactive window coloring
on these environments (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/46847). This
hack will fix the theming on QGIS 3.24+.


Hope those tips are of use to someone!

I'm happy for this to be merged post-freeze. I've been monitoring and
reviewing the PR as Denis has been working on it and I think there's
sufficiently low risk associated with a freeze exemption for this one.

I'm happy for this to be merged post-freeze. It's a borderline bug fix
anyway, given the very poor usability of the floating dock windows for
3d views.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] DOI for QGIS project / Springer Handbook of
 Geoinformatics / Deadline January 20
Message-ID: <trinity-f2a80d02-5514-4b90-8d20-74064374922b-1642412302077@3c-app-gmx-bap23>

Dear QGIS Board, dear QGIS Developers,

this is very gentle reminder following up to my mail to the QGIS Board from last week (see below): The deadline to include a DOI for QGIS in the Springer Handbook of Geographic Information is coming up on Thursday. I just want to make sure that all software projects covered in the Open Source chapter can make an informed decision whether they want to have their DOI referenced in the Handbook. Otherwise, the project URL will be used for reference.

Currently the second Edition of the Springer Handbook for Geographic Information (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-72680-7) is being finalised.

QGIS is covered in the chapter on Open Source GIS (thanks to the volunteer work of Marco Hubentobler !). Neither the Editors nor the Authors receive any pay from Springer for their work and won't benefit from the volumes sold.    

Recently, new workflows for scientific citation of software projects are becoming state of the art. This includes references by persistent digital object identifiers (DOI) to software projects instead of URLs. DOI have several benefits over URLs, the biggest advantage for this community might be that DOI-based references allow to give due credit to the whole project team, including first authors, developers, but also maintainers and people in other roles.

The Springer Handbook will be around for at least five, maybe ten years. One reason for DOI (which will keep pointing to the latest QGIS release, and maybe more up to date content (see #5 below) is to give added value to the readers and not to bog them down with obsolete information.

Until now, eight OSGeo projects will have their DOI referenced in the Open Source Chapter, while six more are in the process to register their DOI, hopefully before Thursday (details here: https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/DOI)

The QGIS community can of course register a DOI whenever it decides to do so. 

Some reasons for DOI for the QGIS community might be:

1) Little effort, no cost and significant benefits for everybody who's involved in QGIS and can use scientific credit for their careers (-> students, early career scientists, people on tenure track).
2) preservation of all code releases in an open access long term repository (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodo), free of charge and effortless for the project community (bzw: NASA is also using this approach for their data publishing: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/collaborate/doi-process)
3) Reference by DOI is the way to go when citing anything with a long list of authors/committers: QGIS has about _1001_ committers according to GitHub, that's a lot.
4) When ORCIDs (https://orcid.org/) for persons serving as developers, maintainers, etc. are included into the committer - metadata (GitHub-sided), the DOI workflows will pick this up and will add due credit by reference to their citation lists.
5) DOI can be used to link information, inclduing video recordings and presentations. Videos from FOSS4G events can now be linked to software project DOI and vice versa (and also linked to ORCIDs of real people), like this one: Dobias, Martin: State of QGIS 3D, QGIS ACoru?a Conference 2019. https://doi.org/10.5446/40791

Registering a DOI for software projects takes only a few minutes and is described here:
- Howto mit Screenshots: https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/citeyourcode
- Youtube Howto Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9FGAU9S9Ow
- Inclusion of a CFF and a JSON file in the codebase for automated GitHub-Zenodo integration: https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Persistent_identifiers(pid)#Howto_2

Please contact me if you have any questions on this.

Best regards,
Peter

Hi Cory,

Yes - I would also think that this is not a bug, but a feature request. It
was never claimed that the temporal controller works fine in conjunction
with editing tools. The temporal controller was designed as a presentation
tool and not for editing.

To improve the situation you would have to consult with one of the core
contributor companies listed at
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/commercial_support.html

You could write a specification, ask one of the core contributor companies
for a quote and finance it yourself. Or you could try to write a QEP (QGIS
enhancement proposal) and submit it as a QGIS grant project. Incidentally,
Anita just issued the "Call for participation
<https://blog.qgis.org/2022/01/16/qgis-grants-7-call-for-grant-proposals-2022/>"
for the 2022 QGIS grants. If you could find a company that is interested in
working on this, and team up with them to write a QEP, it could be
submitted as a QGIS grant. The deadline for the QGIS grants is February 13.

This would definitely be more work than what could be covered by smaller
donations.

Hope this helps,
Andreas

Hi,

Honestly, whether this is a bug or a feature request is debatable, I
personally think that it is a bug because a user would not expect that a
basic software action like editing gets broken when the temporal controller
is active: we should either disable editing in that case or make editing
work with the controller.

Anyway, I just wanted to underline that if this is to be considered a
feature request it wouldn't be eligible for a grant (that explicitly
forbids new features).

Kind regards.

Hi All,

I would like to ask that Can QGIS edit Feature on ArcGIS Server?
I try to add service through ArcGIS Rest Services and cannot toggle edt.
[cid:image003.jpg at 01D80C76.FCD79250]
And when I try to add through WFS connection
It can toggle edit but commit error when try to save
[cid:image004.jpg at 01D80C76.FCD79250]
I didn't find any document that can confirm it support edit or not.
Hope to hear answer from you soon.

Thanks,

Hi,

Is there anyone else that can share some light on this issue?

I've tried to make several changes to my qgis.bat and some other bat files
but I have no proposal how to fix it. Is this an intentional or accidental
change between OSGeo4w (v1) and OSGeo4w (v2)? (Shall I rewrite my plugins
or can I hope for a fix?)

Best regards
Axel

Message-ID: <CABPxTTqh+VK=7ohNYt6gY5d6+g9HF0SahWXX7tk4uO2BQb8iRQ@mail.gmail.com>

As I iterate through a point vector layer I get each feature. Normally I
would get access to the coordinate with
    pt = feature.geometry().asPoint()
Unfortunately, this is a QgsPointXY and not a QgsPoint and I need to have
access to the Z attribute. There is no function to return a QgsPoint that
includes the Z and M values.

If I do feature.geometry().get() there are member functions such
as addZValue(), dropZValue (), but there is no getZValue().

There is a function called vertexAt(QgsVertexId id) which returns a
QgsPoint, but the documentation is very unclear on how to actually use
this. What really is QgsVertexId and how should it be constructed?
Alternatively there is vertices() or vertices_begin () which are iterators
that potentially could be used.

This all seems awkward and not documented well. What is the best way to get
a QgsPoint from a point feature which is coming from a processing script
like this?

    iterator = source.getFeatures()
    for cnt, feature in enumerate(iterator):

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi Calvin,

you might use

feature.geometry().get().z()

Works for me both in a fresh osgeo4w v2 install and QGIS 3.22.3 standalone (for
reportlab - matplotlib and psycopg2 are already included anyway).

Thanks,

I was looking at get() returning QgsAbstractGeometry not realizing that
this abstract geometry was really the QgsPoint.

Best wishes,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 3.16.16 build failure (NetBSD 9, pkgsrc)
Message-ID: <rmir194nc67.fsf@s1.lexort.com>


I'm trying to do an update of pkgsrc from 3.16.15 to 3.16.16, and got a
build failure in test code.  (It seems building tests is on by default
which is perfectly ok, and I should try to run them.)  Immediately prior
to building 3.16.16, I built 3.16.15 which was clean all the way to a
binary package.  I did the build of 3.16.16 without qgis installed at
all, in case that old headers were leaking into the new build.  (All
previous micro updates have been without issue, except perhaps adding a
file or two to the manifest.)

It sort of looks like there is a test for an optional feature that isn't
guarded; I'm not building with qtwebkit.   I would hope it isn't really
necessary to have that, as it is truly enormous and takes hours  to
build.  I've been running without it for a few years and haven't noticed
anything missing.

I will look into this more but I thought I'd see if anyone else has seen
a similar failure.

Sort of related, I could not tell from tests/README.md if the tests all
run with the not-yet-installed qgis, or if it's like gdal where it tests
the installed version.  I'm guessing not-yet-installed.

That is exactly the issue; idfdefing one function that relies on webkit
gets the build to finish.  PR soon.

Thanks for checking as well J?rgen,

Interesting that it worked for you, I just tried and deleted my osgeo4w
folder and got a fresh copy of qgis3.22.3 (during the installation I only
installed "qgis: QGIS Desktop" and "python3-pip") and the same result could
it be that I need to install some more stuff to get it to work?

Best regards
Axel

Use one of the qgis-full metapackages.

No, that's currently not supported.

I've previously scoped this out and have a proposal and costing
available for implementing it. If you're interested in funding this
work just reply directly to myself.

Kind regards,
Nyall

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Plugin approval (new plugin uploader, ICEtool)
Message-ID: <979244296.769871.1642584164536.JavaMail.open-xchange@opme11oxm16aub.bagnolet.francetelecom.fr>

Hello everyone,


QGIS user and teacher for some years now, I would like to share a plugin with
the community.

I'm not sure to understand the full process for a public release, is it directly
related to plugin approval ?


If so, I would be gratefull if somebody can give a look at my plugin. This
plugin allows to easily compute theorical ground temperature of an urban design
from ground description, building and vegetation layers. With it, you can test
and justify urban design choices to limit urban heat islands.


Link to the plugin:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ICEtool/

Link to Github:

Thanks for all your work,

Cheers, Arthur Evrard

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] custom feature form with radiobuttons
Message-ID: <5a7af97ed94746c2eafaccd4501207c203d2fea3.camel@orchis-eco.de>

Hello,

I am working on a custom feature form, with a python script. The form
includes radiobuttons and dependant Combo-boxes. So far the python
logic seems to work, however the first feature added to an empty layer
will not update all input fields correctly and only default values or
lineedits will be applied. For any following features, the form works
as intended.
Do you have any idea, what causes this behaviour? How should
radiobuttons be implemented to avoid weird behaviour in general?

Greetings,
Jan Reimuth

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Use of master to refer to dev version
Message-ID: <BN8PR14MB2770060297E3B070BEC39DFAA5599@BN8PR14MB2770.namprd14.prod.outlook.com>

Hi, I have seen a debate about master going on in other tech domains and I note that QGIS dev version is called master, is this something that should be addressed? I particularly do not mind but it seems some people are offended by the use of the word master and considering QGIS is a project that prides itself in being inclusive of the community maybe it would be a good idea to review its use

Of course I am not a developer just thought today of the issue not because it impacted me but because of what I see other people in tech talking about it , I have no idea on the extent of the changes, impact or even if it is necessary.

Regards

Hi Nyall

I just upgraded my laptop to fedora 35 last week. Will wait a few more
weeks before doing my desktop too. I will definitely do your
debuginfod tip. The file chooser, yes is irritating but I guess it is one I
will just live with for now since I have some flatpak apps and the fix
seems invasive. The inactive elements colouring hasnt really bothered me
till now so I guess I will keep trucking along.

One other funny thing I found is that the qscintilla library name was
changed to have an underscore rather than a hyphen e.g.

from

/usr/lib64/libqscintilla2-qt5.so

to

/usr/lib64/libqscintilla2_qt5.so

Otherwise the migration was very smooth. Are you running under wayland? I
am still using x11 because none of the video conferencing apps I use work
under wayland. Is there any particular benefit to using Wayland for QGIS
that I am missing out on?


Thanks for this!

Regards

Tim

Dear devs,

Before raising a bug (if it's really a bug), I was wondering why the `userLocale` in QgsSettings is stored using a short string, eg. `fr` for french instead of `fr_FR` ?
`globaleLocale` is OK with `fr_FR` for french.

Seconde question
I tried, using a .ini file with QGIS_GLOBAL_SETTINGS_FILE env var, to force locale settings when creating a new profile.
Plugins complains because the setting `userLocale` is not defined.

.ini file :
[locale]
userLocale=fr
overrideFlag=true
globalLocale=fr_FR
showGroupSeparator=false

When QGIS starts, Python error:
QSettings().value("locale/userLocale")[0:2]
NoneType is not scriptable.

And in Python console, if I execute the above command, the return is empty but in settings, the setting `locale/userLocale` is set to `fr`.

Regards,
Nicolas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] MultiPart post network request stopped working in
 master
Message-ID: <4df79fd4-4301-07d3-e451-51ae5da2db9c@terglobo.nl>

Dear all,

One of my plugins stopped working in QGIS master, because some of the 
requests seem invalid. I spent quite some time on debugging but cannot 
find the problem.

This script runs in 3.22.3 but not ion 3.23. It uploads an xml file to a 
validation service. It should print: {'successful': True, 'errors': [], 
'warnings': []}

Anyone a clue? I'm feeling that the best way would be using the 
QgsBlockingNetworkRequest post() function but that does not seem to work 
with a QHttpMultiPart variable.

Thanks!
Raymond



import json

manager = QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance()

url = QUrl('https://connect.aerius.nl/api/v7/utility/validate')

request = QNetworkRequest(url)

     file.setParent(multi_part)

# This line already fires an invalid request in qgis 3.23:

Hi Nicola,

We decided this to minimize the number of translations: for example fr can be used in french speaking Canada AND in France.

The other way around, there are countries with >3 or 4 languages (Switzerland etc?). So the number of 'locales' would explode.

So focussing on one French translation (instead of 5(?) for every country) seems to us the best way to use our translator-resources?
ONLY if a languages is different enough in 2 countries, it is sometimes split up (portugese for Portugal and Brazil the most notable one)..

Your other question I dare not to answer. But is the locale/Userlocale param not defined by Qt itself (instead of QGIS?). Are you sure it should be possible to override it in that way?

Hope this helps

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Greetings all,

I'm relatively new to QGIS and love it so far. My goal is to Georef a PDF map of a college campus for my legally blind brother and have it at a VERY HIGH resolution.

Method I'm using: Georeferencer plugin / Export map to Geo PDF

Problems:

  1.  Skewing of the map
  2.  Losing definition / resolution
  3.  Can be done easier?

Details:

  1.  When I mark the points of reference for my map, then open in QGIS, it is at a tilt. I am unable to rotate it and have it export pdf with the Geo option. It fails each time. If I don't rotate it, it will export fine.
  2.  Even when it does export in this manor, I lose resolution. First off, I can only export the view, not the borders of the original map, and then I lose space depending on my screen size / configuration.
  3.  The Georeferencer plugin is awesome, but lacks options. There is an option in that tool to export to pdf, when I do that I have AWESOME resolution and everything I need BUT.... It uses the coordinates from what looks like the Source X and Y, with approx. 0,0 at the top left of the map, and not the GPS coordinates. So if I open in Avenza, it puts me in the ocean near Afrika, not anywhere that my location should be. Is there a way to switch that or build in an option to do it correctly so I don't need to go into the QGIS export options at all? I can send pics if you'd like.



I'm open to trying other methods, and researching more as well so any help here is very very very much appreciated!
Thanks,
Shawn Schembri

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Selecting active mesh layer dataset
Message-ID: <PH1P110MB1588C1C1A541C57DF8684D47B55E9@PH1P110MB1588.NAMP110.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Good afternoon,

I am developing a QGIS application in C++ and am looking to overlay weather data stored in NetCDF files as mesh layers.  Each file has several variables that can be displayed; however it only displays one variable or dataset (always the first one in alphabetical order) and I'm not sure how to make it so I can choose which variable I want displayed.  For an entire layer I know I can call the layer tree node like this:


QString layerName = "Temperature";
QgsLayerTree *tree = project->instance()->layerTreeRoot(); //project is QgsProject object

for ( QgsMapLayer *layer: qmc->layers() ) // qmc is QgsMapCanvas object

    QgsLayerTreeNode *node = tree->findLayer(layer->id());

    if ( layer->name() == layerName )
    {
       node->setItemVisibilityChecked(true);

    } else
    {
       node->setItemVisibilityChecked(false);
    }

}

but its parallel for Mesh Layer subsets doesn't work:


QgsMeshLayer *mesh = new QgsMeshLayer("/path/to/file.nc","MyData","mdal");
QString dataName = "Temperature";

for ( int &i: mesh->datasetGroupsIndexes() )
{
   QgsMeshDatasetIndex did = i;
   QgsMeshDatasetGroupTreeItem *child = tree->childFromDatasetGroupIndex(i);

   if ( child->name() == dataName )
   {
      child->setIsEnabled(true);

   } else
   {
      child->setIsEnabled(false);
   }
}

I've also tried to set the layer rendering for datasets, but it seems to pertain to the entire file (mesh->datasetGroupCount > mesh->datasetCount; the renderer only pertains to the dataset (count = 1).  This would be helpful to figure out as setting the renderer for different types of data (vectors for wind, contours for pressure, etc) is the end goal of this application, and would be an upgrade from having to create multiple shapefiles/rasters for this data.  There doesn't seem to be many examples out there for mesh layer use outside of the QGIS console, not even for PyQGIS developers.

Hi,

if you want to change the rendering settings use :
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsMeshRendererSettings.html#details
and
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsMeshLayer.html#ada9c8d32c90c0a7030f1a20de6435066

Use this QgsMeshRendererSettings class to set your active dataset group.

Regards.

That was my thought, too. Also, what is the point of having a
presentation-only tool for temporal data in QGIS if you cannot practically
or effectively edit that temporal data in QGIS as well?

Hi Cory,

There is nothing wrong with your feature or bug request (whatever it is 
;-) ) - there is certainly value for it!

But there is a point in the temporal controller in presentation-only 
mode. It covers probably >90% of the use cases - as most many users 
don't edit temporal data, but analyze and present it.

With the same argument you could say - what is the point of having point 
cloud data in QGIS if you can't edit the point cloud data? Or many other 
new features we have in QGIS - that have a value even in cases where a 
new functionality isn't fully implemented in all details.

Andreas

Hi Kim,
it seems to me the capabilities XML file attached to your message has 
nothing wrong and demonstrates that the WMS served by QGIS is working 
correctly: the "airports", "places", "countries" and 
"countries_shapeburst" layers are exposed by the WMS.

Regards.

Thank you Alessandro, just filed the bug:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/46989

I'm not allowed to assign it to you, so could you please do that 
yourself. And if you need any help from me just let me know.

Kind regards,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Custom symbology for vectors in QgsMeshLayer
Message-ID: <PH1P110MB158872E602870554520D187FB55F9@PH1P110MB1588.NAMP110.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

I would like to display vectors as wind barbs instead of the provided symbology (arrows, streamlines, traces).  I see that the QgsMeshVectorRenderer class is private, am I able to create symbology as I can with a category-based renderer for QgsVectorLayer?  I have wind barbs created and saved as .svg files and have done this successfully using shapefiles, but would rather knock everything out at once with the mesh layer as I have multiple variables I'd like to display with one layer instead of having to create multiple files.

Hi Brian,

This has been raised before for displaying NOAA data. It is not something
possible at the moment, but we would be definitely interested in extending
mesh symbology to support other styles apart from arrows and streamlines. I
think my colleague @Peter Petrik <peter.petrik at lutraconsulting.co.uk> had
looked into this briefly in the past.

Kind regards
Saber

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Exporting contour geometry from mesh layer
Message-ID: <PH1P110MB15886906E1E2507D6B0CB67CB55F9@PH1P110MB1588.NAMP110.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

I want to be able to display certain datasets within a QgsMeshLayer as contours.  My code is set up to create a vector layer with the memory provider.  Despite the mesh layer being valid, I am not able to return valid linestrings.  Is there another way of going about this that doesn't include running a QProcess (gdal_contour)?   The part of the code in question:

QgsMeshLayer *mesh = new QgsMeshLayer("/path/to/file.nc","MyData","mdal");
QString contourField = "MSLP";

if ( mesh->isValid() )
{
     QgsMeshRendererSettings rens = mesh->rendererSettings();

     for ( int &i: mesh->datasetGroupsIndexes() )
     {
           QgsMeshDatasetIndex did = i;
           QgsMeshDatasetGroupMetadata gmd = mesh->datasetGroupMetadata(did);

            if ( gmd.name() == contourField )
            {
                 rens.setActiveScalarDatasetGroup(i);
                 mesh->setRendererSettings(rens);
                 QgsMeshContours *contours = new QgsMeshContours(mesh);
                 double cint = 2.0;
                 double max = gmd.maximum();
                 double start = gmd.minimum()-cint;
                 QgsVectorLayer *vec = new QgsVectorLayer("Linestringcrs=EPSG:4326",gmd.name(),"memory");

                 if ( vec->isValid() )
                 {
                      vec->startEditing();
                      QgsVectorDataProvider *vdp = vec->dataProvider();

                       while ( start < max )
                       {
                             start = start+cint;
                             QgsFeature feat;
                             QgsGeometry line = contours->exportLines(i,start,QgsMeshRendererScalarSettings::NeighbourAverage);

                              if ( line.isEmpty() )
                              {
                                    cout << "No valid geometry for value = " << start << endl;
                              } else
                              {
                                   //.....'create attributes/fields for feature'...
                               }
                         }
                         //...create linesymbol rendering, add layer to canvas...'
                    }
              }
       }

The output confirms that the dataset values are not empty or NaN (at least most of it), as I am returned the stdout "No valid geometry for value = 998.0, 1000.0, 1002.0,"..etc.  I've also tried to debug this by only entering a value and leaving the dataset index and resampling method out and looped it from a large negative to large positive value, nothing valid is returned.  Also to add to this exchange, if there exists any more documentation on QgsMeshLayers I'd be interested in having a link to it; seems like only rasters and vector layers have much in the way of programming tips (e.g. PyQGIS cookbook).

Hi Axel and list (I'm not sure my message are published on the list and 
I don't know why ...)

I tried again with distinct version and this is my results, on Windows 10? :

- 3.16?? (Installer = QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.16.15-1.msi)? => fail
- 3.18 => (Installer = QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.18.3-1-Setup-x86_64.exe) =>? success
- 3.22 => (Installer = QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.22.2-1.msi)? => fail

The error message is :

/" WARNING: Retrying (Retry(total=3, connect=None, read=None, 
redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'SSLError("Can't 
connect to HTTPS URL because the SSL module is not available.")': 
/simple/xlsxwriter/ "/



_*The common point of the "fails" is the "msi" installer ... *_

Hope this tests can help to see better where the problem is? ?

Axel : did you find a solution, or a workaround ?

Thanks to all.
Jean

Hi Jean,
QGIS 3.16 is also available via OSGeo4W v1 installers if you want to 
test it.

See also these bug report I think are related: 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/46276 ,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 'Empty custom crs' giving popups "The definition
 of '' is not valid"
Message-ID: <b010c47a-540a-d951-9b0d-945d9a5193d5@duif.net>

Hi Devs/Users,

Not sure if it is only me, but I'm working in a rather virgin QGIS profile (developing a new plugin without any crs actions).

Now if I do something in the Settings dialog and clicking OK, I get presented the Screenshot attached: 'The definition of '' is not valid'.
Looking in the user defined crs's then, there is an empty line (see screenie 2). Which is off course easy to remove...

At first I thought: I must have done some silly key command while doing something else and I have created an emtpy crs.
But I'm pretty sure I have removed it now a couple of times (and saved the project I was working in)....

So Do other have this experience? Or am I the only one :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Sharing QGIS processing tools via repository
Message-ID: <CAP2_p60G4LLmqAKmrt5XFuC=ZSLoRm-943miOGG0_PgEwcATTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Team,

I have developed a bunch of custom processing tools which will eventually
import custom python modules from QGIS site-packages. So far I had to copy
the processing tool python files to default profile folder and custom
modules to QGIS site-packages manually.

However, I'm looking for an elegant way to share and distribute the
processing tools from github's private repository to our colleagues
internally. Essentially, I'm looking for a way to configure github's
private repository in such a way that processing tools can be installed via
QGIS plugin installation dialog.

There are certain dots im unable to connect,

1. can we successfully use github's *private repository* for this purpose
or is it possible only with public repo?
2. How to *define the plugin xml* file along with its supporting QGIS
versions and host it as part of repo?
3. How to configure the repo in such a way that installation of processing
tools will eventually *install the custom modules in the QGIS site package*
space?

On other hand, I have tried using QGIS ResourceSharing
<https://qgis-contribution.github.io/QGIS-ResourceSharing/> plugin but
could not move ahead with authenticating github private repo. I also see
that we can host QGIS plugin repositories on-prem but not sure it is worth
it for small teams.

Any help/leads/documentation on this regard would be much appreciated,
thank you.

-Prem

Message-ID: <7632ebc8-cef6-03d7-0132-557e2a373f90@gmail.com>

Hi list -

I have a Internet resource ("Milj?portalen", The Danish portal for 
environmental data: 
https://arealeditering-api.demo.miljoeportal.dk/swagger/index.html) 
where I would like to use the QgsBlockingNetworkRequest from a Python 
based plugin to access this resource.

I can see, that QgsBlockingNetworkRequest Class supports methods GET, 
PUT, POST, HEAD and DELETE. However, according to the documentation for 
the resource, I have to use the "PATCH" method for updating existing 
objects on the server

Is this possible using the QgsBlockingNetworkRequest Class from Python? 
Or is there any other Python Class I can use for this purpose ??

In this actual state no, because the doRequest method that you could
have called with the PATCH method is private. So, you won't be able to call
it directly, and you won't be able to inherit QgsBlockingNetworkRequest
to call it either.

> Or is there any other Python Class I can use for this purpose ??

I think one good solution is to use the request python framework (https://3.python-requests.org/)

 disappearing?
Message-ID: <468cbcdf-2ce7-c6fc-f6d9-4c306a043986@duif.net>

Hi,

I'm developing a plugin with a rather huge (independent) dialog, so thought: let's make it popup modal in front of QGIS:

self.main_dlg.setModal(True)
# https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#WindowModality-enum
self.main_dlg.setWindowModality(Qt.ApplicationModal)

All fine in my tests on Gnome and Windows 10

But then my colleague with a fresh Windows 11 laptop wanted to test... and as soon as he tried to resize the (large) dialog, it vanished and we could not bring it back anymore (other then restarting the plugin).
So at first it looks fine, it is modal, you can click next to it without issue, but as soon as you touch the dialog borders to resize: gone.
And it's really gone, not as if it moved behind the QGIS dialog or so (which I had with other plugins), really vanished (and keeping QGIS modal/unresponsive sometimes)... Also it is not visible as a 'second dialog' or so in the task bar...

Others have seen this?
Or have pointers?

Else I will try to create an issue with a minimal plugin to be able to demonstrate it (or make it reproducable by others with Windows 11 (which I myself do not have running anywhere yet)).

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde
