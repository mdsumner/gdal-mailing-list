Just to clarify, as you could be interpreted as saying those are the
only two items on the "wishlist" which are missing functionalities,
available in old symbology but not new:

- Those are two more missing functionalities which could be added to the
list.

- There _are_ a number of features already on the list which are true
"missing functionalities" (not wishlist items).  And I'd say some of
them are a lot more important than those two.  For example the two under
"simple markers" are important symbology options which cannot be
controlled at all in new symbology (not just missing features which help
you control a layer's symbology more easily).

False alarm, I have rerun the bench and the problem disappeared. I
don't have any explanation yet, the same build, the same project ...
Now there are mostly positive changes only.

Chart updated http://www.mpasol.it/blazek/qbench/

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Excel Export from QGIS attribute table
Message-ID: <38e5e0622a83809276b223dd41ad635f@carto.net>

 Hi,

 It is a common requirement that users want to export a QGIS attribute 
 table to Excel/CSV/Spreadsheet. While CSV is probably easy, the other 
 two are probably more complex, but there are some good Python libraries 
 around. For my users, Excel is the most requested table export format.

 I wonder if this could be made into the core, as I think that most 
 other user want that as well. The idea is to have an export button for 
 the table, choose the format (CSV, Excel, Openoffice) and let the user 
 select if he wants all data export, or only filtered or selected rows.

 I guess it would be best to use Python for that purpose, as Python has 
 some good Excel libraries:

 * pyExcelerator: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyexcelerator/ (Excel 
 97/2000/XP/2003)
 * xlrd und xlwt (reader/writer): http://www.python-excel.org (Excel 2.0 
 to 2007)
 * openpyxl: https://bitbucket.org/ericgazoni/openpyxl/wiki/Home (Excel 
 2007 and higher)

 Do any of you have experience with one of the above listed packages or 
 any other recommendations? How about OpenOffice writing?

 Goal: cross platform without the need to have MSOffice or OpenOffice 
 installed.

 Would this be best implemented in C++ or in Python?

 Who else would be interested in such functionality?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

My biggest question is why do you need anything other than CSV? Excel 
and OpenOffice both open CSV automatically already. Both also open dbf, 
though saving back to either csv or dbf can be extremely tricky. Not to 
mention everything else scientific can use csv - for example R, python, etc.

Personally spreadsheets are a good way to ruin your data quick, though 
they can be useful for one off final formatting of tables for 
presentations and quick calculations.

I'd be much more interested in reading of xls, xlsx, ods etc as tables 
for joining or generating spatial X,Y layers.

Thanks,
Alex

 Personally I agree - for me, CSV export would be good enough. However, 
 my users demand Excel. The CSV importer in Openoffice is very good, in 
 Excel it sucks (at least in version 2003 which we have). It is just too 
 complicated for our users to import the CSV in Excel. These are not GIS 
 or DB users - they are just regular users with no experience in data 
 importing.

 Often, the goal is to format and print the selected data from the 
 attributes. For that purpose being able to quickly export to a 
 spreadsheet would be benefitial.

 this would be useful as well ;-)

FYI, Sandro Furieri has created a lightweight FreeXL library that can read XLS
files. It can be integrated with spatialite (through a VirtualXLS module), or
standalone. I've developed in GDAL/OGR 1.9.0 a OGR driver that relies on it. See
http://gdal.org/ogr/drv_xls.html for the details and limitations.

Excel 2007 or later doesn't ask about any import details. I just spent 
the week writing instructions on how to force it to do the import dialog 
to prevent insane auto-formatting. You actually have to change the 
extension to something other than .csv to force it in 2007/2010.

I think we should be able to come up with something, and the spatialite 
stuff sounds like a good option.

Thanks,
Alex

this is one of the features qgis users/trainees ask more around here. So
I guess that if they represent a part of the qgis users universe, such

Hello,

I agree that such a tool would be very useful for many people. In my work I
frequently have to collect environmental variables in a GIS and then export
them to Excel/Calc for processing. To be able to this quickly with a few
clicks would save me (and many people) a lot of time and patience.

In ArcGIS this is only possible via the XtoolsPro extension (which is
partly free), which directly exports the attribute table to a Excel
spreadsheet ( http://www.xtoolspro.com/tools.asp#e5 ). I used ArcGIS for
several years and during that time users kept asking ESRI to include the
extension in core, with no success.

This is obviously a detail for QGIS development, but for many end users
like me, it makes a LOT of difference. Sometimes small details like these
play a huge role when it comes to decide to start using a software.

Best regards

Hello,

I agree with Paolo. Doing a lot of training on QGIS for the last 2 weeks and 
the next 3 weeks, user are really disapointed about this bug (wrong scale) 
because this is really usefull.

But I have no idea the best moment QGIS dev should release the 1.7.3, anyway.

Y.
PS: not sure if my email help or not to take the best decision. :)

Microsoft Office 2010 don't open nor create DBF files anymore (that's what said 
one of my customer this week)!

I agree that if we (user) can use and export to ods/excell file directly it 
will be a good point :)

Thanks,

To add to Even's suggestion,

I think it would be best to improve the xls driver in OGR and
integrate that into QGis, rather than develop a standalone QGis
plugin.
That way you make both better!

 Hi,

 Thanks all for your ideas.

 I agree - it makes sense to me to improve and use OGR for this purpose.

 I also tested the idea with the clipboard. On Linux Ubuntu it works 
 fine if one copies from the QGIS table and pastes in 
 LibreOffice/OpenOffice Calc. On pasting, it opens the CSV dialogue for 
 importing.

 FYI: for use with Python Plugins J?rgen added the xlrd/xlwt Python 
 module to the OSGeo4W distribution. With these modules at hand it is 
 very easy to read and write basic XLS files. Not a solution for the 
 core, but definitely interesting for Python Plugins.

It has been suggested to support LibreOffice/OpenOffice Calc in
addition to XLS.
How hard would it be to improve the  FreeXL library to support ods ,
or incorporate support for ods into OGR's xls driver?

I might also add that the FreeXL does not (yet?) support the newer XML
SS file format specification (.xlsx, Microsoft Excel 2007 and newer),
which may be a show-stopper?

By the way, copying (and pasting) rows from a table with no geometries
returns only NULL

should I file a ticket?

Hi everybody,
Just a couple of thoughts:

As others have mentioned, many people want to export to Excel mainly for
formatting and printing, perhaps with some added calculations.  The
ideal would be to improve formatting and printing in QGIS so that this
isn't necessary.
Spreadsheets aren't particularly great for it anyway, and doing it in
QGIS would mean that you wouldn't need to export and format again if the
data is updated.
I imagine this could eventually be quite a lot of work - perhaps it
would be a good idea for a Summer of Code project.  I guess it would
include work on:
- table formatting
- number formatting (also see #4426, although that is not about
specifying how data in an existing column is displayed).
- virtual columns (similar to the new expression based labelling).
- easy breaking of tables across multiple pages, page numbering etc.

Some people also like to export data to Excel, modify it, and bring it
back into GIS.  Like someone said, this is a recipe for headaches, if
not disaster.  I think it would be great if we could identify any
further enhancements to the attribute table and the field calculator
which would help people not to do this.

I recently used a python library called xlwt for a web project to
generate spreadsheets. I think it should be fairly straightforward to
create a python plugin that would allow you to do it. I'm not familiar
with a C++ library for writing excel spreadsheets, but I guess there
is one out there somewhere.

 Hi,

 These are almost exactly the reasons why want to export to spreadsheet:

 * people want to print tables
 * people want to reformat tables
 * people want to share the data (e.g. sending an email, post results on 
 the webpage) - for this purpose a PDF would also be good enough often.

 For the long run we also want a reporting tool (something like Jasper) 
 for printing forms/statistics/charts/diagrams/map views directly from

Hi Andreas,

I am running JasperReports from QGIS Python plugins using PyJasper 
https://github.com/hudora/pyJasper
I do not know if it is elegant but it works :)
I can send you an example if you drop me a line.

 Hi,

 Fyi - J?rgen just included an option in the Postgis Table Connection 
 dialogue allowing to cache a Postgis table or view locally. There is a 
 separate column called "Select at ID" (german "Abfrage nach ID") which 
 is checked by default. If you disable this checkbox it will activate 
 "local caching" of the table data. Of course this is limited to the 
 amount of memory you have in your machine, but it is great improvement 
 for slower Postgis views or slower connections.

 Please try it out and report bugs, if any.

 I am not yet fully convinced if people understand what "Select at ID" 
 means ... any suggestions? It is derived from the fact that if a 
 provider has getFeatureAtId available it will not cache locally, 
 otherwise it will. I would prefer "local cache" as a column name, but 
 then the meaning of the checkbox would have to be reversed.

Sure, import/export of spreadsheet formats would definitely be nice.  It would be great if someone implemented it.  
And I'm not saying it would be a technical disaster; more of an organisational disaster.  After a user exports to excel and formats it all nicely for printing, they would need to export and format again every time they want to print, if the original data changes.  Hopefully they won't be doing much in Excel other than formatting to get the data ready for printing, or it could get quite painful.
If they're exporting to Excel to process the data and then import it back into QGIS, there will be all sorts of added complications e.g. because of separating the attribute data from the features, and because Excel won't respect and preserve the data type of each field.

I'm an engineer - I work with Word and Excel all day every day.  But often (or perhaps mostly) they are not really the right tools for the job, and we need to do all sorts of nasty hackery to get the job done.
Basically I'm just saying that in most of the cases where someone would go from QGIS to Excel, Excel is not the ideal tool for the job, and with some improvements QGIS definitely would be.

+1 to local cache as Select at ID would just confuse people.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Decoupling of Layer structuring and Rendering Order
Message-ID: <5c7b01f2cd8c4383f1655196297094c8@carto.net>

 Hi all,

 Some people already discovered it ;-): 
 http://darrencope.com/2011/12/01/new-control-rendering-order-option-in-qgis/

 Thanks to the work of J?rgen there is now a decoupling of the layer 
 structuring and the rendering order available in current master. It 
 allows you to group layers thematically but decouple it from the 
 rendering order. There is a separate panel called "Layer Order" 
 available with a flat list of all layers where you can drag layers 
 around to change the rendering order. There is a checkbox at the bottom 
 of the two panels "Layers" and "Layer Order" to control which one takes 
 precedence.

 The typical use case is that one generally wants polygon layers at the 
 bottom, then line layers and point layers and labeling, but one does not 
 want to wildly mix different topics. With the decoupling now you can 
 group layers by topics in the regular layer panel and control the 
 rendering order separately in the "Layer Order" panel.

 Be careful with using this new feature with QGIS Webclient - currently 
 it will screw up if you use this mechanism. QGIS Webclient needs to be 
 made aware that the rendering order is now different from the order in 
 the layer tree. But with some modifications, QGIS Webclient will benefit 
 from this enhancement as well.

 Please test this new functionality and report bugs,
 Andreas

+1 for something like "cache layer locally". "Select at ID" has NO meaning
whatsoever for the user. Nobody - except for a hand full of developers -
will know what it stands for.

This discussion reminds me of the reasons why I'm excited about the
Vistrails plugin for QGIS (see http://code.googlegroups.com/p/eo4vistrails/).
Has anyone given it a try yet?

Sure, import/export of spreadsheet formats would definitely be nice.  It
would be great if someone implemented it.
And I'm not saying it would be a technical disaster; more of an
organisational disaster.  After a user exports to excel and formats it
all nicely for printing, they would need to export and format again
every time they want to print, if the original data changes.  Hopefully
they won't be doing much in Excel other than formatting to get the data
ready for printing, or it could get quite painful.
If they're exporting to Excel to process the data and then import it
back into QGIS, there will be all sorts of added complications e.g.
because of separating the attribute data from the features, and because
Excel won't respect and preserve the data type of each field.

I'm an engineer - I work with Word and Excel all day every day.  But
often (or perhaps mostly) they are not really the right tools for the
job, and we need to do all sorts of nasty hackery to get the job done.
Basically I'm just saying that in most of the cases where someone would
go from QGIS to Excel, Excel is not the ideal tool for the job, and with
some improvements QGIS definitely would be.

Hi all,

maybe it's better to integrate into QGIS report generator? Composer
is a nice feature but it don't allow to create advanced reports.
Something like FastReports [0], NCReport [1] or CrystalReports
will be great adition (I know, this solutions are commercial but this
is just example).

Actually, if virtual columns and #4426 were implemented, changing the
number format displayed in existing columns isn't completely necessary -
you could just put an expression using the proposed number format
function in a virtual column, and hide the original column.

I seem to remember some previous discussions about a report generator.

I don't think it would replace the improvements I mentioned, if that's what you mean.
Also, note that the need to print attribute tables across multiple pages is very similar to the need to produce maps spread across multiple pages, so it might be good to implement it along with the long-desired mapbook generator.

By the way,
If/when a report generator is implemented, it might be nice if the report was put in the "Layers" list (just like a non-spatial table is).  And just like an attribute table, you could potentially add a report to a composer layout alongside a map.

Hi



> But I have no idea the best moment QGIS dev should release the 1.7.3, anyway.

@Werner I would suggest to follow the concensus of waiting for a week
or so so that any further fixes can be applied, and then making a
1.7.3 release.

@Paolo et al. regarding  RC releases, lets hold on this idea for now.
We need to give Werner time to get used to the maintenance release
process before we add further complications. We can certainly do it
for the upcoming 1.8 release.

Regards

Tim

IMHO a report should be more than presenting data in a table. A report 
presents features' data in a readable way e.g. in a table but also in 
some kind of text and could include a map or an image of the feature.

A free report generator is JasperReports http://jasperforge.org/

ok - where should one note down the fixes to be backported? I wrote mine on the list,
but I guess it will be easy to miss them.
BTW, to me the sooner the better: doing courses every week, having a broken scale is
very embarrasing, and not well received by the trainees. I still think a quick
bugfixed "emergency" release would be better.

Hi Andreas and Jurgen

>  Please try it out and report bugs, if any.

many thanks for this feature, really useful!

I'm testing it and it seems that if I select two layers in the "add
postgis tables" dialog, and I uncheck the "select at id" checkbox, then
the local caching seems enabled only for one.

cheers

in case a quick fix is not possible, should leave the plugin out of the upcoming
1.7.3 release?

There was no change since 1.7.0 and the globe plugin wasn't included in any 
release yet, AFAIK.

Could you add more information to #4053 . Did it run in an earlier version?

Hi!

I started a Page here to collect all possible backportable bugs
Please help me as good as possible by providing the bugnumber and
probably the commit number of the fix too (and possible do the backport
yourself and mark it a done in the wiki afterwards)

I hope that will give us a good overview about what has to be done..

If everything works well I am willing to release a new version 1.7.3 in
mid of December (Which shoud than be a Christmas present to all our
Users ;) )

It seems we are allowed to ship the ecw read-only SDK on windows:

"For avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not permit You to (a) use the
ERDAS ECW/JP2 SDK
Desktop Read-Only to create or distribute Server Applications or SDKs; (b)
use the ERDAS ECW/JP2
SDK Desktop Read-Only to create Libraries; or (c) distribute header files
or .lib Library files included in
the ERDAS ECW/JP2 SDK Desktop Read-Only. You _may_ distribute with your End
Application any
dynamically loadable object Libraries (.dll files) that are included in the
?redistributables? directory of
the ERDAS ECW/JP2 SDK Desktop Read-Only, and are used by your End
Application.
"
I suggest that we do this. ecw is a pretty popular format and it doesn't
look good on us to tell people to go to the ERDAS site to download
something that may or may not work if ERDAS change the version under us.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis mapserver GetLegendGraphics request doesn't
 support height and width params
Message-ID: <4ED8CB96.4000309@fossgis.de>

Hi,

I'm trying to request a legend from my qgis-mapserver driven WMS. It
works calling:
http://www.foo.de/wms?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetLegendGraphics&FORMAT=image/png&LAYERS=bar&WIDTH=100&HEIGHT=100

But the returned graphic is very small and changing width and/or height
doesn't change anything on the resultant png.

Is this a bug?

Yes, I don't understand why people keep saying they can't be redistributed.

But look at that license more closely:

- you can distribute the libs with a "desktop" application, not a "server" 
application or a "library".  The way I understood this was that you generally 
couldn't distribute them with GDAL, but you might be able to argue that it 
is within the "spirit" of the license to distribute them with QGIS binary 
packages, because in that case you are providing gdal as part of  QGIS, a 
"desktop" program, rather than as a library for a developer.  (Maybe some 
people would even take the view that the GDAL utilities in a binary GDAL package 
are also "desktop" programs.)

- Isn't there another clause stating that your program must display a 
particular statement about the user of their copyright software, and you need 
to make sure your users agree to a license (i.e. make them click through a 
license screen like in the installers for most Windows software, and if they 
don't agree with it then it won't be installed)?

- And isn't there a clause stating that you must register the users (collect 
information about them)?  
This is the real hassle, and I think most of the other people bundling ecw 
support with free GIS packages are violating it.  I was wanting to provide a 
package of one of the ECW example programs (for editing ECW headers), but 
I really don't have the energy to organise this nonsense.

It might be easier to distribute with QGIS the old version that is used on Linux.

Yes, I didn't mean that the report should _be_ data in a table.  Just that it should be put in the "Layers" list, and it should be possible to add it to a composer layout.

But I now realise if a report only applies to one layer it doesn't make sense to put it in the Layers list.  The report would be another way of displaying information about the layer (just like you can display the layer features on the map, or view the attribute table).  It should therefore be accessible in a similar way to the attribute table.  And it should be possible to add it to a composer layout.

N.B. JasperReports is Java based.  QGIS is very unlikely to add Java as a dependency (at least I hope so ;))
If I remember correctly, people were having difficulty finding a report generator suitable to use in QGIS.  I wonder if there are any that are javascript based.  Perhaps that might be an option - Tim is doing some work with Javascript in QGIS.

Hi,

FYI, http://www.spatialroundtable.com/

I think it is worth reading what these people are talking about
Climate Change Adaptation and GIS.

GeoDesign is ESRI initiative. ESRI like to sell their product to UN,
Government, NGO's, etc for Climate Change researchers and users.

http://www.cop17-cmp7durban.com/

BTW, QGIS have already some plugins on this area.

- Raster classification with DTclassifier for QGIS
http://gis-lab.info/qa/dtclassifier-eng.html

- Forest Management Toolkit QGIS plugin for Forest Stewardship Council
http://www.denisalder.net/fmt/

Use of QGIS in forestry
http://www.qgis.org/fr/communaute/etude-de-cas/basel-switzerland.html

Any other use of QGIS (i.e. UR links) in relation to Climate Change
Adaptation and Carbon Sequestration projects?

Thanks.

Hello all,

I was browsing through the plugin ideas to work on something, and this
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_Plugin_Ideas#heatmaps-reusable-python-codeparticular
plugin idea seemed to be a good start.

Is anyone already working on it? Otherwise I will take it up.

The page contains just the link. It would be great if more information is
provided like, use scenario, what it is exactly supposed to do? The Input
is of course a gpx file, with the available code, what should be produced
as the output in Qgis? Any information regarding this is welcome.
:)

Heatmaps would be great because currently, it's always necessary to start

Can you write it in C++ to go into core?

The input should be any point layer file. Output should be a raster layer.
A lot of usable code should be contained in the interpolation plugin which
works in this way.

Looking forward to having this functionality in QGIS.

Is GDAL a SDK?  Do we need to take care not to ship it's libraries and header

application - which isn't allowed to have ECW support?

Fortunately I can happily live without it.   So it's cheap for me to say, that
I wouldn't like to jump to some extra packaging hoops just for some non-free
format.

I can only second that. A convenient way to write a new interpolation 
function is to derive a subclass from QgsInterpolator 
(src/analysis/qgsinterpolator.h). Interpolation usually requires a lot 
of computation, therefore it is good to implement it in the analysis 
library in C++. Like that, the method is available to QGIS and its 
plugins (also python) and other applications using QGIS libs.

Marco

I also think it wouldn't really make sense to make RCs for bugfix
releases. Theoretically those releases should have very controlled
changes in them, all of which very well tested.

Agreed, much better adding methods to existing code than making ad hoc tools.
In fact we have several interpolation methods missing from QGIS core (see e.g. GRASS
modules) and adding them would be good for the project.
All the best.

The python code available here

http://www.sethoscope.net/heatmap/

works just fine, it uses as input a text file with coordinates and
creates a raster output that is not georeferenced.

It would need to be modified to read any point datasource and produce a
georeferenced output.

Hi,

now i want to build pyramids and display them instead of a single map. 
Anyone have an idea of how to do that?!! Which class in which library I have to use?

Hi Sara,

please tell a little more about your project: are you talking about c++,
and  then about qgis itself, or a qgis-derived program? Or are you
talking about a python (plugin)?
Or about a qgis-user-usecase (in that case please sent you question to
the users list: qgis-user@lists.osgeo.org?

Ah, clear. I'll push your response to the list (plz always reply via
list, don't be afraid :-) ), and because I'm not so much in the c++
raster libs, I hope one of the other dev's can give some help.

(I think the pyramid creation is done via the GDAL lib (see also
http://www.gdal.org). That is also what I read here:

Alister,

I just wanted to stress the point that I think a report could be any 
printable presentation of data (dynamical data e.g. from a layer and 
"fixed" data e.g. a legal statement or a company's logo). Thus every 
report will probably be unique and specially made for certain data in a 
certain use case. Having said that a reporting software that can be used 
by many users has some kind of a WYSIWYG report designer.

If we want to stay within QGIS the composer would be the tool where I 
would see the report; one can accomodate images, texts, maps, graphical 
elements etc. in there. What the composer lacks is a multipage layout 
and a way of replacing placeholders in a template with real data during 
run time (that is not to say the composer is bad as it is now, just 
stating what IMHO it is missing to make it a reporting utility). So a 
report would not be an element that one can add to a composer layout but 
the composer layout itself would be the report and created combining 
data and a template during run time.

You are right, JasperReports is Java based. I am not a programmer and I 
do not have any clue about the pros and cons of Java except from a 
user's perspective. I am only interested in having working tools for my 
users and JasperReports together with PyJasper [1] was working for me. 
In our setting the report generator itself is not running on the client 
but on a server, a QGIS python plugin is sending the data together with 
a report template to the server.

all the best

The report would be another way of displaying information about the layer (just like you can display the layer features on the map, or view the attribute table).  It should therefore be accessible in a similar way to the attribute table.  And it should be possible to add it to a composer layout.

Hi all.
When choosing the "checkbox" table editing or the calendar, the values 
are displayed in the neighbouring field. When doing calculations,often 
NULLs are displayed (but correct values are saved in the field).
I suspect something in the table display has been broken very recently.
Any confirmation?
Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] crash when saving thorugh ziplayers plugin
Message-ID: <4EDCF6BA.3070008@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Plugin ziplayers is giving me trouble with current master. I got a nasty 
crash:

Warning: QHttp: empty path requested is invalid -- using '/'

In subsequent uses, I get an error:

Any hope for a quick fix?

 Hi,

 The Call for Participation deadline for the german FOSSGIS conference 
 in Dessau (http://www.fossgis.de/konferenz/wiki/Main_Page) is on 
 December 12.

 I would like to coordinate our contributions (presentations, workshops, 
 developer meeting).

 * Marco H. would be willing to present on current QGIS updates (maybe 
 together with J?rgen?)
 * I would be willing to prepare a workshop for Cartography/Map Layout, 
 covering new symbology, labeling, print composer, etc. - anyone 
 interested in joining my efforts?
 * we should probably also have a dev-meeting
 * and a QGIS booth

 The same coordination should happen for the AGIT conference in 
 Salzburg.

 Who would be coming to the conference(s)? Who will present or 
 particpate?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

I have updated the benchmark. The first version was correct, the last
one was wrong. Last time I have accidentally used qgis_bench compiled
with rpath and lib versions so that it was always using the same (last
version) lib.

I have also bisected slowdown caused by 85b55ca5, which was correct
fix for previous 8c1c2add and it is already optimized by 8e2e654c.
Introduction of "relevant fields" is significant improvement for ogr
layers with many attributes, we can hardly dream about more 70%
optimizations. It just took some time to mature - continuous
benchmarking should point to such cases immediately.

There is another slowdown with forest data (complex polygons, no
attributes) between d5a6beb1 and 93405b10, but bisecting is not going
to an obvious commit, slowdown is gradual.

Hi Andreas, I'm preparing a seminary about qgis on android and its 
possible uses in geo sciences that I will hold next week at the 
universit? di Urbino. So I will have material for a "standalone" 
presentation or for Marco H to add it to update his presentation.

Ciao Marco

 Hi Marco B.,

 This would be great. If you plan to attend either one of these 
 conferences you are welcome to do your own presentation - if you cannot 
 attend, please coordinate with Marco H. and/or me so he can include this 
 in his own presentation.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Getting and setting attribute field names and
	values for vector layers
Message-ID: <CALcLSfqK6BuPT3pBbQCADB9Zxuod_GVmaAbu9CMift=J+A8GRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am a newcomer to Qgis plugins but not to Python and geoprocessing. Trying
my hand at a plugin today I got pretty much to where I want to be in a very
short time thanks to the excellent tutorials and logical design of the
Python bindings.
However, one issue threw me completely. The cookbook has a great example of
getting geometries and attributes (
http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/vector.html#iterating-over-vector-layer)
but when it comes to reading the attributes it suggests the code below
which produces the attribute *values* but uses integers for keys, even
though in general there are field names in the vector data. I consulted
with the class definition of the underlying library
http://qgis.sourceforge.net/html/classQgsFeatureAttribute.html which makes
a lot of sense having public methods fieldName ()  and fieldValue().
However, I was not able to find these in the Python bindings. I am sure
this is a super simple question reflecting that I have only spend 1 day so
far with this so please help me get on the right track.

Cheers and thanks

---------------------------------
Snippet from cookbook
---------------------------------

# fetch map of attributes
attrs = feat.attributeMap()

# attrs is a dictionary: key = field index, value = QgsFeatureAttribute
# show all attributes and their values
for (k,attr) in attrs.iteritems():
    print "%d: %s" % (k, attr.toString())   # PROBLEM: This only gives
attribute *values* and not their field names. I had expected them to be
keys in the dictionary.

Hi, Santhosh,

you must installed qtwebkit-dev, the development package for build qgis.
Not only qtwebkit.

Dear Santhosh,

I recommend to use the packages from ELGIS. If you need the trunk version of 
QGIS, please consider to read the below anyway and probably follow the link on 
rebuilding RPMs.

Hi devs, can anybody confirm that a pre install run has no python 
plugins availables and no warnings in master?

i just did
make
./output/bin/qgis
works with no python plugins (c++ and python console work)

make install
../../apps/bin/qgis
all works correctly

ciao

Hi Andreas,

I would be interested to join your workshop about cartography map
layout in QGIS. And I can also assist to organize a qgis meeting and project
booth in Dessau. But I probably won't be in Salzburg.

Otto

Hi Marco,

AFAIK when running from build directory QGIS don't have Python plugins
and this is know and correct behavior. See Martin's email about this [0]

Hope this helps

If you follow the build instructions in [1] you will see the following
recommendation (which works well for me):

Now we create a build directory and run ccmake:

cd Quantum-GIS
mkdir build-master
cd build-master
ccmake ..

[...]

Now on with the build:

make
make install

I wouldn't call it "correct behavior".
Why would you want a "pre-install" runtime to use "post-install" stuff ?

I think such copy or symlinking or whatever is needed should be
implemented somehow in a way to allow _full_ off-system runs.

Don't you agree ?

Well, I mean that _now_ this is correct behavior, because _now_ we have
this by desing,  this is not regression.

I agree, that in ideal we should be able to run QGIS from build dir
with all features enabled. But _now_ even runing qgis without Python
is great, because recently we haven't this feature at all.

Our organization is looking to participate in a demonstration project for a cloud-based image server that would serve imagery via WMS, WMTS, and via WCS. I know that QGIS already supports the OGC WMS standard but would it also act as a client consumer of WMTS and WCS data in order to test this service. Looking through earlier posts I find a few references to a possible WCS implementation via GDAL but no references to WMTS.

Thanks,

Hi Ole,
to get the field names you have to use the vector data provider.

If vl contains the vector layer than:


provider = vl.dataProvider()  # QgsVectorDataProvider
fields = provider.fields()  # QMap<int, QgsField>

... # vl.select(), feat = QgsFeature(), while vl.nextFeature(feat):

    attrs = feat.attributeMap()
    for (k,attr) in attrs.iteritems():
        name = fields[ k ].name()
        print "%s: %s" % (name, attr.toString())


Regards.

Thanks for that - I wouldn't have known where to look. But this does the
trick - although for my application I did have a need to explicitly convert
the QString types to unicode.
I looked at methods toAscii() and toLatin1() but neither produced the
python string types I was expecting. Can you comment on that?

Many thanks again
Ole

Subject: [Qgis-developer] geometryType differs in layer and provider
Message-ID: <CALcLSfpDMK9A9utg5SvGK7=j=FxHzT31BTfVTxScxjGWQJC0Bg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGis developers

Making great progress on day 2 of my journey into QGis. However, I was
puzzled by the geometryType apparently being different in layer and
provider.

The code snippet below produces the following output for a polygon layer:
------------------------------------
Geometry types
Point:  0
Line:  1
Polygon:  2
Layer geometry type 2
Provider geometry type 3
------------------------------------

so I am assuming the geometry type given by the layer object is the correct
one.
Can someone please confirm if this is correct and also perhaps comment on
what the geometry type in the provider means?
Many thanks
Ole


----------------- Code snippet ------------------------
print 'Geometry types'
print 'Point: ', QGis.Point
print 'Line: ', QGis.Line
print 'Polygon: ', QGis.Polygon

print 'Layer geometry type', layer.geometryType()

provider = layer.dataProvider()
print 'Provider geometry type', provider.geometryType()

Hi Ole
Everything is OK, QgsVectorLayer.geometryType() returns QGis::GeometryType:
Point - 0
Line - 1
Polygon - 2
UnknownGeometry - 3
NoGeometry - 4

and QgsVectorDataProvider.geometryType() returns QGis::WkbType:
WKBUnknown - 0
WKBPoint - 1
WKBLineString - 2
WKBPolygon - 3
WKBMultiPoint - 4
WKBMultiLineString - 5
WKBMultiPolygon - 6
WKBNoGeometry - 7
WKBPoint25D - 8
WKBLineString25D - 9
WKBPolygon25D 	- 10
WKBMultiPoint25D - 11
WKBMultiLineString25D - 12
WKBMultiPolygon25D - 13

So in your case you have Polygon layer.

WMTS will probably be implemented early next year.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Analytical framework: SAGA, OTB etc.
Message-ID: <4EDF2336.20501@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
The framework is IMHO a very useful addition to QGIS. To make it really 
usable, however, we still miss:
- a SAGA package (for Debian and related distros) that uses the same 
Python of QGIS (in my case, QGIS uses py27, saga deb uses py26)
- an upgrade of osgeo4w using py27 (now stuck to py25 AFAIK)
- an OTB package for Debian (this cannot go to official Debian, for 
technical reasons, so it will have to go to an unofficial repo).
I'm investing on the last issue, and I invite interested parties to do 
the same for other issues.
Once the above points fixed, we plan to support further development of 
the plugin, following priorities outlined in 
https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki. We have very limited resources 
for this, so any cooperation will be welcome.
All the best.

Hi devs,
I wonder if I can assume that any _polygon_ feature has an id, 
regardless of the format it comes from (given it is either file or 
db-based). In a plugin I am currently working on, I rely on every 
feature having an id.

Hi Bernhard

Yes, every feature should have a unique id. The data provider class 
which creates the features decides which id to give.
QGIS also relies on feature ids, e.g. for identifying features when editing.

Marco

Hi all.
If I kill QGIS, at next restart of the program I miss all my settings 
(toolbars etc).
Is this normal? I find it quite annoying. Can this be avoided?
Thanks.

One more, probably related, issue: adding a field with Field 
caluculator, with the expression $rownum results in all NULLs.
A recent regression, possibly due to table redesign?
All the best.

You need to pass it to cmake (or ccmake if you use it). Just try with
comand line first like
Cd builddir
cmake -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/qmake ..

Hello,

I'm sure that if multiple organism can fund development it will ensure its 
development ;)

Is that right?  Shouldn't it be /opt/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/474/gcc/bin?
Or is there a directory called qmake?

Message-ID: <CALcLSfrJJaU5Nipq1_AjWZN4y3Vs4HbgD+UJ_W4iq=yYu5UwqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am 2 days into writing plugins and have been able to do calculations
using the current layer. I have also succeeded in creating a dialog box
using design-qt4 with a layer selection combo.
However, I have not yet been able to find an example or a tutorial that
tells me how to make that selection box pick a layer and give me a handle
to it in the Python code.
Please forgive me for such a fundamental question, but I need a little help
to get started.

Also, is there such a thing as a reference manual for the python plugin API?

Cheers and thanks
Ole Nielsen

If I understand you correctly, you want to access current selected layer, right?
Use self.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer() for this

> Also, is there such a thing as a reference manual for the python plugin API?
Python API mainly the same as C++ API, so you can use C++ API from [0]

Also there is PyQGIS Developer Cookbook [1] where you can find some code
examples

To convert QString into Python string use str() or unicode() functions.
For example, in code

attrs = feat.attributeMap()
for (k,attr) in attrs.iteritems():
   name = fields[ k ].name()
   print "%s: %s" % (name, unicode(attr.toString()))
   # print "%s: %s" % (name, str(attr.toString()))

Hi Alexander and mailing list

Thanks for the quick reply - it is great to have the support of this
community.

If I understand you correctly, you want to access current selected layer,

Sorry, I was perhaps not as clear as I could have been. I have already
written plugins using the currentLayer option. What I need now is to
combine two layers for a specific analysis. So I imagine being able to
select them through the plugin GUI selection combos and return the two
layer handles to the Python code in the same format as what is provided by
current layer. However, I have no idea how to start doing this.

OK

Yes - I already read that and found it very helpful. However, nowhere to be
seen are explanations of the fundamentals of selecting layers through the
plugin and working with them.

Your help is much appreciated
Cheers
Ole

Ah, understand. That's not so difficult. You need to get layer name
from combobox,
then find layer by name. Here is small function that did this work for you

def getVectorLayerByName( layerName ):
  layerMap = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers()
  for name, layer in layerMap.iteritems():
    if layer.type() == QgsMapLayer.VectorLayer and layer.name() == layerName:
      if layer.isValid():
        return layer
      else:
        return None

So in your code you can simply do something like this

layerA = getVectorLayerByName( self.cmbLayerA.currentText() )
layerB = getVectorLayerByName( self.cmbLayerB.currentText() )

Hope this helps

Hi,

have a look at the code in fTools. Most Uis have comboBoxes for layer 
selection and in fTools_utils there is code to get the layer object 
corresponding to a layer name.

regards

Hi all.
I got a sytematic crash when adding an image to print layout:
Fatal: ASSERT: "!isEmpty()" in file /usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qlist.h, 
line 274
I kind of remember this was raised recently.
I think this is a crucial issue, to be fixed ASAP, and is a recent 
regression.
All the best.

 Hi,

 Yes - I ran into the same problem.

 Question: is the bug also in 1.7x? If yes, the fix would have to be 
 backported? I agree it is a major bug, if it also exists in 1.7x

Hi

I just tried to add a Image to the Print composer in upcoming 1.7.3
without any problem .. So I'd say probably this is not a problem in
1.7.x
But I could also do something "wrong".. Just adding a jpg as image to
print composer works in my case

regards

 Werner - I just tested with OSGeo4W 1.7.2.1 on Windows and the problem 
 still exists if you set project properties to "relative paths".

 Here is the commit with the fix that needs to be backported:
 https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/917f748d33d4a41f700e744c9b54792e4355257a

Subject: [Qgis-developer] (First?) API break
Message-ID: <4EDF92CA.9030801@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs

Finally it happened:
During recent reorganisation of some print composer classes, I broke the 
1.x API. The change won't affect many plugins (maybe mapbook?) and the 
changes are straightforward (some methods are in QgsComposition instead 
of QgsComposerView now). Nevertheless, I've started a list on the wiki 
to collect informations about API changes:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/API_changes_for_version_20

Please add to the list whenever making API relevant changes for version 2

Regards,
Marco

Hi,
You may try to use http://sourceforge.net/projects/osm2postgresql/
to test with huge OSM datasets.
I'm doing this daily on continental extracts (and planning to do this on
planet.osm soon). (Do NOT try to import full planet.osm with
osm2postgresql_04.sh, next version will be released soon).
Rendering when zoomed in a lot is OK, but I would not try to zoom out to
much!

Ok the fix was not in 1.7 (but now it is)
The strange thing is that it worked for me without any problem ..
Probably a Windows only issue? (because I am on Linux)

anyway .. now the fix is in 1.7

thx a lot

Thank you for the reply - it is useful and I am getting closer. However, it
is not that I want to specify the name, rather I'd like to be able to
browser the active layers (or maybe even layer files) and select two layers
for analysis. So I am maybe looking for a file or layer selection combo and
a hint on how to make it work.

I just need to pick two existing layers from the UI and get handles to
them. After the processing, I need to specify a filename to store the
result to and will also need help with  that.
I have very limited experience with UIs so please forgive me my basic
questions.

Cheers and thanks
Ole

Hi.
I think it would be good, at least when the changes are simple, to keep plugins
updated, so we can continue testing Master without breaking too many things.
Is this feasible?
Thanks.

I could not find it, so I opened a new one:

BTW, it is not easy to me finding specific tickets (e.g. filtering only open ones,
those for a specific category, etc.): am I missing something?

Hi!

To my understanding there is still no "real" workflow in redmine ticketing.
And as far as I can see noone will take "Leadership" and create a good
workflow for both - reporters and developers (ticket cleaners).
I kindly ask a developer to take the opportunity to make a clear
workflow for bugreports and feature requests and how they should be
handled ..
Currently a lot of things are depending on that (Including the WIKI page
I'd like to write about correct bugreporting) ..
Alexander started a Page [1] but it seems there is not much interest for
now (or am I completely wrong and everything is already clear?).

I think I am not in the position to work out a workflow.
 Probably a developer and a poweruser(bugreporter) should work together
on that?

kind regards
Werner

It would be a good thing IMO to report API changes with every build if we
can.  I asked a question on Stackoverflow.com about how to do this a while
ago.

Hi,

ok, first problem was that libR.so is not found - thanks Joona for that
hint. Now I have probably the problem you described with incompatible version
of libgfortran. I guess, this the error you also got. Could you have a
look to find the details about that again, please?

Carson: apart from that the R-base package is build with the
--enable-R-shlib flag.

First create a combo in your UI named "layerCombo"

Then populate the combo running:

self.layers = self.iface.legendInterface().layers()  # store the layer list
self.layerCombo.clear()  # clear the combo
for layer in self.layers:    # foreach layer in legend
    self.layerCombo.append( layer.name() )    # add it to the combo


When you have to get the layer selected in the combo,
just us the following snippet:

index = self.layerCombo.currentIndex()
if index < 0:
    # it may occur if there's no layer in the combo/legend
else:
    layer = self.layers[ index ]    # get the layer by index from the
previous stored list
    source = layer.source()    # get the layer source


I haven't tried the previous code, so it could contains errors.

Look at QT tutorials, they contain everything you need
to know about UI creation.

It's a little late to add to this discussion, but I strongly support a
1.8 release, especially in light of the eminent API changes.

I love the new Browser dock window, and would like to see it in a
stable version.

Thanks to all commenters.

I've uploaded the new homepage template right now, I ended up leaving
the vertical bar in left position instead of the planned right
position because there were a lot of small CSS issue with the bar if I
put it at the right.

I think the CSS styles should be completely rewritten anyway, I
wouldn't spend too much time on that now.


The pieces are all in place now, we just need to put some meaningful
text in the pages :)

If somebody want to help with the pages, he will need access to the
control panel, please ask to one of the current admins (me, Gary
Sherman, Martin Dobias, Tim sutton).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of a Windows installer for
 CAPS Scenario Builder
Message-ID: <1323372970897-7075555.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hi All,

As I've described before on this list, CAPS Scenario Builder is a PyQGIS
desktop application that will allow government officials, conservation
groups and others to submit 'Scenarios' of proposed infrastructure changes
to the CAPS team in csv format.  The scenarios are then run through the CAPS
environmental modeling computer system, and "this process results in a final
"Index of Ecological Integrity" (IEI) for each point in the landscape."

Once again, I want to thank all those who work on or have contributed to
QGIS.  It is an amazing resource. Also, I have already thanked Aaron Radicot
for his work on the PyQGIS application "OpenOceanMap," which made the
development of CAPS Scenario builder much easier.  I hope the CAPS
application will make some contribution to the QGIS community effort.  For
the email archives, the application contains a number of tools that I was
not able to find in any of the available Python plugins for QGIS.  These
subclassed map tools include: select features,  identify features, add
points, add lines and add polygons.  The app also has deselect features,
delete selected, copy selected, paste selected and code for displaying
vector attribute tables.  It uses the GeoTux "layer list widget" and the
1.71 API with V2 rendering and use of the QgsRuleBasedRendererV2.  It also
has a system for fairly sophisticated "graying out" of buttons that cannot
be used in the current application state. Finally, it was made into a
Windows installer using py2exe and the Inno Setup 5 installer.  All the code
is very heavily commented.

The app can be downloaded at
https://github.com/EcoGIS/CAPS-Scenario-Builder/downloads

Thanks again,
Bob

Hi All,

I'd also like to announce the publication of a new book that may be of
interest to many of you.  Charlie Schweik, who is currently chair of the
OSGeo Education Committee, and I wrote the book based on five years of
empirical research funded by the US National Science Foundation.  It is
published by the MIT press and will be out in May, 2011.  You can find out
more about book on Amazon.com at http://tinyurl.com/d3e4545

I'm very excited about the book, and I hope it is not inappropriate to
mention it in this forum.

Thanks,
Bob

I don't think you're missing something - this seems to be a major

I am using some OSM data (osm_administrative in the chart), smaller
areas only for now because I have to repeat each test many time and
work with average to get repeatable results. OSM is very good source
of real data.

I have added PostGIS and SQLite providers and categorized renderer.
Interesting are opposite effects of some commits on PostGIS provider,
e.g. roads_graph-pg-categ x roads_graph-pg-sinsym and also pg x shp,
eg. roads_graph-pg-sinsym x roads_graph-shp-sinsym.

Hi Giuseppe and Alexander

Thank you for the help - both of you. I followed your instructions and can
now pick file names of loaded layers.

Also, as you suggested, I realised that I needed to study the Qt4 interface
and have gone through most of the tutorials (
http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4)

The only things I had to change was

   - that the layerCombo lives in 'dlg.ui' and not 'self' since I am using
   a skeleton generated by the plugin generator. Is that OK?
   - that the method in layerCombo to add layers is 'addItem' and not
   'append' :-)

With that loaded layer names show up in the combo and after selection the
fully qualified filename is returned by layer.source()

However, if I want a handle to an active layer, like I got
with self.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer() is there any way that could be
obtained from the layer object?


Grateful for your advice.

Cheers and thanks

Ole

as I see you use code from Giuseppe. If you want to get
layer object use my function or modify your existing code.
You need to create a QgsVectorLayer object from layer's
source.

Hi Radim

Wow, there are a lot of performance critical changes, even with the 
postgresql layers. Thank you very much for the useful qgis_bench, it is 
now much easier to make performance tests when implementing a new feature.

<dream>
A real killer feature would be to have an application that takes a 
project and a source tree, runs all the revisions in master branch and 
outputs the times  for the revisions in a csv file.
</dream>

Regards,
Marco

Hi all.
I think we should clean up the plugins list; currently the situation is rather
confusing for users.
As an example, the old 1-band plugin has no meaning, as it is superceded by the newe
version.
The cleanup could be none during the move to plugins.qgis.org. or in the original repos.
Any taker? Or original devs could do it?
Thanks.

zoom to village is also to be removed (it has hardcoded
paths/configurations and it was never mantained) but the list is not
finished.

By the way, where is the old "geoprocessing" plugin?

Until this won't be fixed

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4567

using the old geoprocessing plugin is the only way to get correct table
of attributes in the result of a union operation.

Hi all.
I have an hdr.adf file. I create a colour style, then I save it either as hdr.qml or

loaded next time. I kind of remember it worked like this a while ago.
Am I doing something wrong, is there a bug, or?

Hi Paolo,

you're right this worked a while ago (if I correctly remember, before
raster providers
update). Now this and several other features broken and there are
several tickets
in redmine

qml not read automagically for rasters - http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3576\
Transparency settings are not applied from *.qml -
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3723
Also there are three tickets related to NODATA value
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3733, http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3817 and
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3840

I would call it "known issue".

Anyway it does not use any post-install stuff, it simply does not
consider the python plugins that would be installed (fTools, gdal
tools, plugin installer, osm).

I agree. But I am not aware of a "nice" way how to do it. Symlinking
does not work on windows, moreover the plugin files are spread into
two parts (sources in source dir + generated code in build dir). So
the only way is to copy everything to the output dir when doing the
build - but I did not add that (yet).

It does not seem to be related to raster providers, it was not working
in pre providers merge either, was it? It seems that transparency
table in GUI was never synced with raster.

It should be fixed in 3b9b2d87, please verify.

Both verified and now seems all works fine. Thanks Radim.
I close http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3723, but

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Call for packaging: QGIS 1.7.3
Message-ID: <1323543436.6888.17.camel@localhost>

Hi Developers and packet assemblers!

Thanks to the hard work of all developers and thanks to Alexander Bruy
for backporting a lot of bugfixes I am able to branch the third
maintenance release on the 1.7.x branch "release-1_7_3" as of today
(10th Dec. 2011). There have been some nasty bugs left in 1.7.2 which
should be cleaned out by now.

The source tarball is here:
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.3.tar.bz2
and the md5 checksum is here:
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.3.tar.bz2.md5

You can check out this branch (depending on your git configuration)
using:

git fetch origin
git branch --track release-1_7_3 origin/release-1_7_3

If packagers would be so kind as to update http://download.qgis.org
with links to their latest wares, it will be appreciated. I'll give a
few days (and until we have Windows binaries at minimum) before making
the announcement to the world.

Please note that I have reinstated maintenance of the CHANGELOG file
in the root of the source tree, so consult that (or the
help->about->whats new? tab after building) to see what changes were
made. Some of the last minute commits will not be mentioned there.
There are no new features in the release, only bug fixes and small
tweaks.

I just say this is assumed to be the last 1.7.x release (but I cannot
promise.. probably there will be another "strk"-release ;) ).
There are already first API breaks in master branch on the road to 2.0.
So probably expect a 1.8 somewhere appearing as the "stable" release
without API changes giving the developers time to work out 2.0.

Hopefully I did everything right - forgive me if there are some mistakes
- it's my first release done alone ;)

Best regards
Werner

Message-ID: <4EE46A15.9060403@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I think we should avoid like hell the error other sw dev teams have done, i.e. having
two parallel, partly working versions.
IMHO we should:
- backport regularly any bugfix and relevant new features (e.g. the browser) that do
not rely on API breakage, and release minor versions very often
- keep the plugins (at least the most important and widely used) working both on the
stable and on the development branches, so that power users will continue (as they
are doing today) to use and test the development version.
Of course I realize this will involve some extra effort, therefore I'm ready to help.
All the best.

Can we have a conditional fix (if api_version=2.0)? This way we should not maintain
two copies of the same plugins, much better if someone works with qgis stable but
also tests master.
All the best.

in javascript there is try and catch for such problems. Ore one could
test if an object/method/property is present. There are a lot of browser
differencies - so in a web environment it is quite normal to test for
capabilities.

How can one check if an object/method is present in Python?

Hello,

I sent this message a fwe weeks ago on qgis-users and I would like to get some

De : "Yves Jacolin (free)" <yjacolin@free.fr>
? : "Qgis-user@lists.osgeo.org" <Qgis-user@lists.osgeo.org>

Hello,

I am trying to make proportionnel point for each polygon of my map. Polygon 
layer is swiss' canton and my attribut field for the proportionnal value is the 
population in 2010 (dbf joins with the canton layer).

I choose "graduate" style, change the symbol to "centroid fill" and create the 
class. My point symbol are not proportionnal.

I put all of my data here: http://download.qualitystreetmap.org/osm/Suisse/

Files you need for testing:
* project/prop_point.qgs
* population_2006-2010.dbf
* admin_level/pays/pays.*
* admin_level/regions/regions.*

I am using QGIS 1.7.2.

Finally, is it possible to define a transparent border for such ponctual symbol 
with a large width (5 px for example)?

Thanks,

Y.

Hello all,

http://semver.org/ is a source of inspiration (especially the FAQ
section).

"""
Why Use Semantic Versioning?

This is not a new or revolutionary idea. In fact, you probably do
something close to this already. The problem is that "close" isn't good
enough. Without compliance to some sort of formal specification,
version numbers are essentially useless for dependency management.

About plugins, my suggestion is to ensure that all major plugins are
updated to new API version *before* the release. Otherwise we would
release a major version that misses random functionality...

Hello Andreas, all,

the check can be done during import:

"""
try:
    from qgis.core import newFunctionName as function
except:
    from qgis.core import oldFunctionName as function
"""

so that you can use "function" anywhere in the code without further
checks.
To keep the import code short, only the previous version of the API is
tested. If a plugin developer wants to extend support to even older
versions, I would recommend to create a separate "LTS" version.
What do you think?

Anne

Better is to send one message per topic, otherwise it is too difficult

Thank you very much for all the work that has gone into this.
I really think continued support of a stable branch will help 
the growth of the project.

Hi all, and sorry for any cross-posting,

Want to be part of New Zealand government's open data initiative and really make a difference in opening up LINZ's data to the public? Then maybe this is an opportunity for you.

Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) is looking for a geospatial developer to help support the development the LINZ Data Service (LDS). The LDS uses multiple open source applications, and LINZ has a number of other applications that use industry standard geospatial tools.  The geospatial developer will thereby be involved in work that utilises and integrates data and applications across the breadth of the geospatial field.  

The successful applicant will have:
- a tertiary qualification in a relevant area
- significant knowledge of geospatial open source systems
- significant experience in Perl, Python, or php or scripting
- significant experience in PostgreSQL application development, including PostGIS spatial extension, Pl/pgsql stored procedure language
- proficiency doing geospatial data translation, ideally using gdal/ogr, FDO or FME
- proficiency using LINUX as a development and operating environment
- strong written and spoken English to be able to elicit and interpret the needs of a wide range of people with varying technical backgrounds

Preferably the successful applicant will have:
- experience in C++ development using Microsoft Visual Studio
- experience in QGIS core development
- experience in QGIS python plug-in development
- actively participated in open source projects using geospatial technologies

Please see http://ww.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/organisation/careers to apply for the position.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to refresh QGIS layer (WFS Plugin)
Message-ID: <1323662829.70514.YahooMailNeo@web94813.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm a new QGIS user. I'm using WFS plugin to connect my QGIS client to a WFS server. 
In
 WFS plugin there is an option to restrict WFS to fetch features within 
the current view extent. I'm using this functionality and it is working 
fine, but the problem is that after loading a layer if I want to pan to 
different area then it won't fetch the data again. So I want to know if 
there is any option to refresh the layer so that it can fetch the data 
according to new view extent.

Thanks,
Pulkit

Thanks for your help. Using QgsVectorLayer worked straight away to give the
handle from the source files.
I assume OgsRasterLayer will work the same way. I can use the file name
extension to determine if the file is raster or vector but was wondering if
Qgis has a library for that too?

Cheers and thanks

Hello,

New topics on Field Calculator :) Here are some bug and enhacement:

* split value using a caracter (enhacement)
* use test operator: if, elseif (enhacement)
* help button, there is a typo for "lenght" instead of "length".
* french translation : there are a problem with french accent (@Jean-Roc, are 
you aware of this issue?)

I have some feedback on styler, request, select, etc. but it will come later.

Hi,

I found a Refresh Menu option in QGIS, but the issue is that it always send WFS request with same view extent (bounding box) as it was in initially. Even after changing the view extent to some other location it never fetches features which were not visible at the time of loading.
Should I modify the WFS plugin to correct this behavior or is there any other way to solve this issue.

?
Thanks,

Pulkit Goel

Hi Pulkit

You need to modify the WFS provider to refetch the features after 
changing the view extent ( but it should not be difficult ).

Marco

 One can enable a grid and snap to the grid. Would this be sufficient. 
 In addition, there are already alignments of selected objects and 
 absolute positioning at corners and middle points.

 not sure what you mean here? Do you mean if f.e. a table is too large 
 it would automatically flow into another page?

 I believe this would all result in a reporting tool. A reporting tool 
 would be responsible for automatic line breaks and flows - something 
 like Jasper. People should use Jasper for this purpose and just use the 
 map view from QGIS.

 Currently this is only possible per label, not for selected text. What 
 you ask is a simple "text editor". Not sure if such components already 
 exist in qt? Marco, do you know?

 do you mean "text flow"/automatic line breaks?

Complete recompilation of core, gui libs and  ogr, postgres,
spatialite providers takes about 10 minutes (should be less with
incremental steps in commits). Those libs + providers occupy about
60MB (RelWithDebugInfo). There are about 1700 commits to those dirs in
1.x line. Currently I have about 25 projects to test, each renders in
about 5 s, 10 iterations are used.

Compilation time: 1700 * 10 / 60 / 24 = 12 days
Space occupied by binaries: 1700 * 60 / 1024  = 100 GB
Benchmark time: 1700 * 25 * 6 * 10 / 3600 / 24 = 30 days

It seems feasible at least for recent history. It would be more
practical than ad hoc bisects.

I support Annes approach.
It's appropriate to use the Duck typing style in Python and not the C++ style 
(if API_VERSION >= 2.0): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing#In_Python
If a method is called only once, one could also write
if hasattr(composerView, "addComposerShape"):
...

I've started a section on Marco's Wiki page for this:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/API_changes_for_version_20#Best-
practises-for-Plugin-developers

The problem is caused by a faulty libgdal1-1.8.0 in ubuntugis-unstable

A solution has been suggested by Julien Malik
(see http://orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/) as he had had this problem few weeks ago
and actually made a correctly build libgdal for otb.

The solution is:
1. Make sure you have the otb repo in your list:
http://ppa.launchpad.net/otb/orfeotoolbox-stable-ubuntugis/ubuntu
(in my case, lucid)
2. Run
sudo aptitude install libgdal1-1.8.0=1.8.0-2~lucid2+otb2
libgdal1-dev=1.8.0-2~lucid2+otb2
3. Start QGIS. The tif files can be read and displayed again.

Now I have libgdal1-1.8.0 flagged as upgradeable in Synaptic, but will
not do it until the
package is fixed there.

Thanks a lot Julien!

I had the problem again after upgrading to qgis 1.7.3.
The cause was qgis-sqlanywhere1.7.2. Removing it and installing
qgis-sqlanywhere1.7.3 fixed the problem.

Hi Pulkit

In master branch, there is now the option of keeping the wfs layers in 
cache (default) or reload the data on each pan/zoom 
(https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/20bc41d2a139d80c9795c34c754068a9d14588ae)

Hi list,
forwarding this thread because it relates to ubuntugis.
I'd also like to ask, why is ubuntugis-unstable still using
gdal-1.8.0, as 1.8.1 was released in July?  It uses the same gdal
version as ubuntugis-stable.

QTextDocument can be used for such functionality. An example in QGIS 
where this class is already used is the text annotation item.

I'd like to call the attention of users on the fact that
the image produced by the Georeferencer tool is shifted (at least in
the case that we have tested), as this might pass
unnoticed in some cases.

Please see the screenshot here:

We've tried polynomia of order 1 and 2 and Helmert, with very similar results.
CRS is ED50 UTM31N

something similar has been pointed a few day ago by Paolo ("checkbox
table widget writing on the left column"), but I don't know if any
action has been taken.

sorry,  I  should've  mentioned  it: todays nightly 1.9.90 code revision
700e6b4 (visible on the title bar too though)

PostGIS - 2.0 trunk

I've  tried  1.7.3 too -  much  better,  but after editing and saving all
values  turn into ERROR and I need to close-reopen project to see that
they actually got updated.

I know our software might be too bleeding edge, but we do need stuff in 2.0.

Using hasattr is very general and works in almost all the cases.

I didn't like the try - import - except block,
it may be a good option if you have to switch between functions,
classes or modules.

>> try:
>>     from qgis.core import newFunctionName as function
>> except:
>>     from qgis.core import oldFunctionName as function

But if you call a method within that block it could throw different
kind of exceptions (even user defined ones), so you should catch the
AttributeError only to really understand if the method is available.
On the contrary, if you don't call the method within the block but
just use the block to get the method (i.e. storing it in a variable),
than it's the same of calling the hasattr function.

I remember that when at the Wroclaw HF I added the
addPluginToDatabaseMenu method some people got a TypeError
probably due to a PyQt bug:

TypeError: 'sip.methoddescriptor' object is not callable

The solution was using hasattr [1] instead of the
try - except AttributeError block and it seems to work fine until now :)


Anyway, particular cases (e.g. a function is moved between classes
keeping its arguments like the changes made in QgsComposerView)
can be handle using a lot of other ways in python.

A very compat (and nice too) solution is to use the getattr's default third
parameter:
"""
getattr(composerView, 'addComposerShape', composition.addComposerShape)
"""

<crazy mode on>
Another way may be to add a fake attribute to the new class object
that points to the method on the old class object
"""
if not hasattr(composition, 'addComposerShape'):
    composition.addComposerShape = composerView.addComposerShape
"""
and then calling it as you call the API2.0 method :)
"""
composition.addComposerShape(item)
"""
<crazy mode off>
... but this works fine only if the composerView is not deleted before you
call the fake method on the composition :(


It's time to go eat something.
Bye.

Hi,

FYI the patch that we have for gdal 1.8.0 is here :
http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-DevUtils/file/ef64ddb5b440/Packaging/ubuntu/gdal/do_not_disable_GTIFF_for_otb
and is not necessary for gdal 1.8.1

The problem appears because somehow you are using in Qgis a package
that links to libtiff (maybe from one of the python module loaded in
Qgis).

In older (< 1.7.2) QGIS Debian packages the icons from

qgis-plugin-grass-common package and installed into 
/usr/share/qgis/themes/ directory.

Building Debian packages for QGIS 1.7.3 that icon are not longer 
installed. It seems a change into the CMakeLists.txt file, not a 
Debian issue.

It that OK?

Thank you.

thanks for your test case.
I did a quick test reprojection, but couldn't see a problem with the
georeferencer output, i.e. the coordinates generated by the transform fit the 
destintaion coordinates within a few pixels, putting the max. error somewhere 
in the ballpark of 1.5m. This relies on the destination coordinates being in
ED50 UTM31N. The georeferencer has no support for transforming the
destination coordinates, so they need to be specified in the destination CRS.

I suspect the discrepancy you are seeing might be a problem with the
WGS84<->ED50 datum transformation, so it would be helpful if you could provide
the ArcGIS output as well.

I guess you meant to say that the right one is from ARCGIS?

Hi Martin and Nathan

While searching for a solution described in a similar problem here
("Position on map centered on screen and smoothly updated by a GPS:
Any Python plug-in/code?") I found this thread.

Marco confirmed that currently there exists no Python binding for
accessing GPS signals. Class QgsGPSConnection which sends signal
'stateChanged( const QgsGPSInformation& info )' as soon as there's
something arriving from GPS.

Now since Martin encouraged us to ask him if a SIP file is missing,
I'm doing this now (unless there's a better solution around).

Thanks,
Stefan

Manuel,

No, the correct one is the one on the left, which is the one made with
arcgis. I've made an screenshot
with transparency:
https://sites.google.com/site/openfiles2/home/errorgeorefARCG_QGIStransp.jpeg?attredirects=0&d=1
https://sites.google.com/site/openfiles2/home/errorgeorefARCG_QGIStransp.jpegw?attredirects=0&d=1

You can also note it in the first screenshot:
https://sites.google.com/site/filestemp2/home/error_georef.jpg

The points are correct (therefore the errors etc), but the
georeferenced image is shifted. May be the datum is not taken into
account
when the georeferenced image is created.

Hi all.
I'm trying the new installer on android 2.3, but it does not work for me:
- during downolad, if the screen locks, the download stops, and it has 
to be restarted
- (maybe for the same reason) the installation fails, without detailed 
notice.
Any hint on how to proceed?
Thanks.

Hi!

I had the same problem - and kept the download going by tapping the
screen once in a while ..
You should not let the screen lock ..
And it installed without any problems here (beside the big sized fonts
which are far too big for my mobile - but i guess it is not intended
to be used on mobiles ;)

Marco B will correct me if I am wrong but I recall him saying that the
installation takes a long time and seems to make the phone appear
locked. He was working on a patch to make a progress bar during
installation. So try just leaving the phone for a while and see if the
install in fact works.

Try downloading the apk in PC first, place it the SD,  and then install it.

well, with my setup (ca. qgis 1.7), the output of the georeferencer  matches 
the output from ArcGIS pretty accurately (older revision of QGIS, though - 
haven't tested with head). 

See my result, georef output in green:

http://www.warped-space.de/georef-vs-arcgis.jpeg

The qgis georeferencer output can be found here:

http://www.warped-space.de/Ilerfly125v2_modifziert.tif

Please upload the output you got, both ArcGIS and georeferencer, so that
we can rule out problems on the visualization / on-the-fly reprojection
side of things. Also, at this point the exact version of your QGIS/GDAL
setup could be relevant.

There are some possible sources of error for the discrepancy, e.g. gdal, a
faulty entry in the qgis projection database, or user error (well, it happens
:-)).

cheers,

	Manuel

Hi to all,
i have a question for you. I have 2 vector layer that have two different 
spatial references. I'd like to tranform(convert) one of these in the same 
coordinate system.
Like that:

 crsStart = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem()
 crsStart.createFromProj4(layerA.crs().toProj4())
 crsDest = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem()  
 crsDest.createFromProj4(layerB.crs().toProj4())
   
  if crsStart != crsDest:
  
                    layerA = QgsCoordinateTransform(crsStart,crsDest).
transformLayerAtoLayerB
               
                    
Which is the function that i have to use?

Thanks

Francesco Boccacci

Hi Duarte,

from my experience it is not possible. You can of course re-use the ui file
and implement the whole functionality on your own based on the cpp file,
basically a translation from C++ to Python. I've done this before and it is
not a complex process, but it requires time.

By the way, the folder app of QGIS source code contains
QGIS-application-specific code, so I would say you won't find there
functionality available in PyQGIS, for that you would have to have a look
to the gui and core folders.

Perhaps there are other ways to set the project file programmatically from
Python, but I don't know them, sorry.

Regards,

Germ?n

Mmm, you are right, I only used it for one feature at the time.

Then I think you just have to loop over every feature in the layer that
you want to transform, and transform the geometry of each feature one by
one?

Given the QgsCoordinateTransform-object, you can transform one geometry
by using it's 'transform' method:
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsGeometry.html#46fd84e518cae4368aadeeac89574dfa

Some copy and paste from imagemapplugin.py:

destinationSrs = self.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationSrs()
layerSrs = self.iface.activeLayer().srs()
srsTransform = QgsCoordinateTransform(layerSrs, destinationSrs)
...
self.provider.select(self.provider.attributeIndexes(), mapCanvasExtent,
True, True)
...
feature = QgsFeature();
while self.rovider.nextFeature(feature):
  feature.geom.transform(srsTransform)
...

See here:
http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/vector.html#writing-vector-layers
how to write a new file.

Devs, please let know if this is not ok....

By the way, I assume you are doing this from within a plugin or some
python code? Because qgis itself can do coordinatetransformations for
you when you use 'save layer as' .... in the gui.

HTH,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Has anyone else noticed that QGIS is crashing when you try and access
the layer properties for a WMS layer?

This happens if I double click on the layer in the layer panel or if I
right click and select properties. 

I am using 1.9.90-21 from OSGeo4W.

I cannot confirm,
it works fine here on my Ubuntu 11.04 and QGis master (bca3f93).

Does anybody confirm?

Assunto: Re: [Qgis-developer] quick noob python question

Hi Duarte,

from my experience it is not possible. You can of course re-use the ui file and implement the whole functionality on your own based on the cpp file, basically a translation from C++ to Python. I've done this before and it is not a complex process, but it requires time.

By the way, the folder app of QGIS source code contains QGIS-application-specific code, so I would say you won't find there functionality available in PyQGIS, for that you would have to have a look to the gui and core folders.

Perhaps there are other ways to set the project file programmatically from Python, but I don't know them, sorry.

Message-ID: <CALuHMPDejEEF=yXkr485H1j74CGL992fVwxO7gVMwSkazJT0XA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

there are lot of core plugins and much more contributed. Keep all them in
single toolbar/menu decrease usability. I remember we have several
discussions about that, and one of the results - Raster and Database menus.

But most plugins don't used appropriate menus, see [0]. So after some offlist
discussion with Paolo I start to work on moving plugins to correct menus. As
a part of this work I also implement some new functionality:
 - new methods to place plugin buttons to the Raster toolbar;
 - new Vector menu (hidden by default, appears after loading first plugin. Same
   as we have with Database menu) and Vector toolbar. Methods to add plugins
   to this menu/toolbar;
 - Database toolbar with appropriate methods.

Also I move most of core plugins to different menus, depending on
their functions.
Unchanged plugins are (they still located under Plugins menu):
 - eVis
 - MapServer export
 - OpenStreetMap
 - RoadGraph
 - Coordinate capture
 - Globe
 - GRASS

All this changes available in reorganize-plugins branch from my fork [1]

[0] http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4395

Comments and opinions are welcome. If there are no objections, I can commit
this to master.

The only pitfall I see with this is if a plugin isn't loaded and the user loads it they may not know where to find the menu. I don't know if this is the case, but when plugins used the Plugins menu, the user had a clue where to look.

Is it possible to set the NULL value of a raster (beyond than what is
done for the current session with Properties)?
Raster/Translate prompts for a new raster (which is not the case for
the projection with Assign Projection).

thats correct, and I did exactly the same (except for the scale change - might 
be worth checking out), but couldn't reproduce the shiftr (my results match
the output of the arcgis version). 

I've got a lot on my plate right now, but if I find the time I'll try to look 
this is a regression in qgis or the georeferencer, as I said I'm still on 1.7 
atm.

How do the residuals look in the georeferencer? Is there a noticable bias
(i.e. do they all point in one direction?)

Also, make sure there was no world file influencing the unreferenced file
(something like Ilerfly125v2.wld), the georeferencer can't handle that.

I also noticed that you used a scale change, does the shift also appear
without scale change?

cheers,

	Manuel

Even with all the plugins in one menu they can be hard to find - there
are tickets about this:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4069
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/1734

Do you think my latest suggestion at #4069 would work?:

- A lot of plugins have an "about" page. The plugin system could be
changed so that instead of plugin authors implementing their own "about"
pages (as many do currently), there is a standard "about" page, build
from the plugin metadata, and accessible from the plugin
installer/manager.

- There could be a policy that plugin authors should explain on the
"about" page where to find the plugin in the QGIS gui.
e.g. "XYZplugin provides the ability to do xyz in QGIS, and can be
accessed from the Vector menu".
Or "WXYplugin adds a WXY tool to the standard digitizing toolbar".

- This would mean the search capability in the plugin manager/installer
would be sufficient for people to find where a plugin is. It would also
reduce gui clutter caused by plugins being put in submenus just so that
they can also provide an "about" page in the submenu.
The "about" page should also provide any needed links to a plugin's
website, tracker etc.

Manuel answers a message I  sent to him only. He includes all relevant
parts of my message except the link to the arcgis result:
https://sites.google.com/site/openfiles2/home/ilerfly125v2geoarcgis.7z?attredirects=0&d=1

Manuel,
There is no wld file for the input layer
The GCP table with errors can be seen here:
https://sites.google.com/site/filestemp2/home/GCP.jpeg?attredirects=0&d=1

As I'm using gdallib1-1.8.0.2, could this be a gdal problem? Could
anybody else using gdallib1-1.8 amd qgis1.7.3 verify (I provided all
necessary material)?

We have solved the practical issue for this particular image using
another software, so we are not in a hurry. But I'm a bit surprised
by the little attention that this problem is raising among developers.
A correct georeferencing is a critical
issue for a GIS. If this bug is confirmed, users should be warned.

Hi all.
Why not adding a compulsory tag "section": raster, vector, database, 
web, miscellaneous?
All the best.

Hi,

I have encountered problems with the new labelling engine.

I have a cadastral layer and I set labels "over centroid", but the new
labeling engine moves them very away from the centroid.

See this attachment:

http://hub.qgis.org/attachments/4116/label-bug.jpeg

If I use the old engine, it works perfectly.

I've reported on redmine with sample data to test:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 1.7.3
Message-ID: <4EE9C5ED.1090801@gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Developers, Users and Supporters!

We are pleased to announce that QGIS 1.7.3 is now available. This is a
bugfix release over version 1.7.2. A detailed changelog is available on
our home page[1].

Binary downloads[2] are already available but some are still making
their way to the download page so if you don't see your preferred OS
there please check again in a day or two.

Thanks to bug reporters who have reported bugs using upgraded issue
tracker[3] and special thanks to all developers who fixed those reported
bugs.

As always, if you find a bug please report it on [3].

QGIS is the collaborative effort of many coders, translators,
documentors, bug reporters and other community members.

QGIS continues to have great momentum - we recently branched the code
base for an upcoming release of QGIS 1.8.0 and we are about to break API
compatibility in our 'master' branch to start us down the road towards
the eventual release of QGIS 2.0. If you enjoy using QGIS and are able
to, please consider sponsoring our project - the money you donate helps
us to run our developer meetings and generally keep the project moving
forward. You can find more details on how to sponsor QGIS on our home
page[4]. QGIS recently obtained it's second Silver Sponsor for 2011!
Thank you Kanton Solothurn, Switzerland (Silver Sponsor from April
2011)[5] and the State of Vorarlberg, Austria (Silver Sponsor from
November 2011)[6], your financial help is greatly appreciated!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] My first Qgis plugin - what next?
Message-ID: <CALcLSfrL-DLpLBbuLMc+SR+HO9VWfqm9Cxrtm_AWjfFP2MMzkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

First up, thanks to everyone who helped me get started last week when I
tried my hand at writing QGis plugins for the first time. With the help of
the community and the nice environment QGis provides, it was a pleasant
experience to take these first steps.

I wish to give back to the FOSS community, so have written a small but
working plugin that calculates polygon centroids. The reason I picked this
task is that I had QGis crash when trying to calculate centroids for large
datasets. A test set with about 47,000 polygon features showing this
behaviour is OSM_building_footprints_20111115.shp which is available in
test_data <http://www.aifdr.org/projects/CentroidPlugin/browser/test_data>.
The new plugin uses numpy vector operations and does the same job in about
10 seconds (on my machine), so I think it will be useful. The source code,
installation instructions, test suite, screen shots and so on are available
here: http://www.aifdr.org/projects/CentroidPlugin

The plugin still needs some work, mainly on the UI side, and if the
community finds it useful I hope someone will help doing that. The
outstanding issues that I know are recorded here
tractickets<http://www.aifdr.org/projects/CentroidPlugin/report/1> and
if anyone finds problems and issues, please report them here
newticket<http://www.aifdr.org/projects/CentroidPlugin/newticket>

I am not sure if this is the right forum for this - if it isn't please let
me know what the process is for contributing this kind of work.

Cheers and thanks
Ole Nielsen, Jakarta

Hi Duarte,

from my experience it is not possible. You can of course re-use the ui file and implement the whole functionality on your own based on the cpp file, basically a translation from C++ to Python. I've done this before and it is not a complex process, but it requires time.

By the way, the folder app of QGIS source code contains QGIS-application-specific code, so I would say you won't find there functionality available in PyQGIS, for that you would have to have a look to the gui and core folders.

Perhaps there are other ways to set the project file programmatically from Python, but I don't know them, sorry.

Regards,

Germ?n

Using python is it possible to call QgsEmbedLayerDialog and set the project file programmatically (mProjectFileLineEdit)?

Hi Duarte,

if I understood well, you would like to simulate a click in QGIS buttons.
For this you can use the slot trigger() of the available QAction's in the
class QgisInteface [1]. For example, if you want to open the "Open
Project..." dialog you can type this in the Python Console (inside QGIS):

 iface=qgis.utils.iface

iface.actionOpenProject().trigger()

Regarding Toolbars, you can also access them from the QgisInterface class.
For example, to access the Layer menu do this:

iface=qgis.utils.iface

m=iface.layerMenu()


Since a menu consists of a set of actions you could trigger any action of
the menu:


iface=qgis.utils.iface

m=iface.layerMenu()

for a in m.actions():

print a.text()

m.actions()[2].trigger()


Hope this helps.

Regards,

Germ?n

probably because if the proper developer (Manuel) cannot replicate the
issue it is hard to take any action :)

By the way, using your input data I get also the shift (on both Linux
and Windows).

Hello all,

I am a member of the French Ministry of Ecology.

We want to provide two plugins (experimental status).
What is the proper way to proceed, given the current plugins 
reorganization ?

is it always from the URL: http://pyqgis.org/manager/python_plugin/list?

Is there a recommendation to share the sources (such as 
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/plugin-builder)?

We also have QGIS documentation (in French) that might interest the 
community. Where to publish?

You can upload your plugins to the QGIS Contributed repo [0] or to the new
plugins repo [1]. In second case you need an OSGeo ID [2].

> Is there a recommendation to share the sources (such as
> http://hub.qgis.org/projects/plugin-builder)?
To share plugin sources you can use any SCM service such as GitHub, BitBucket,
Google Code etc, or even setup own repo. AFAIK there are no strict
recomendations
on this.

> We also have QGIS documentation (in French) that might interest the
> community. Where to publish?
For this question it is better to contact Otto Dassau (cc-ing).

We collect all kind of QGIS documentation in the wiki: 
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Users_Corner

As for the new plugins repo you need an OSGeo ID to login and add your
documentation link.

IMHO it would be prefab to have a default location (git instance) for 
all plugins, otherwise we'll end up quickly with a mess, especially 
considering the number of plugins and plugin developers is quickly 
increasing, and many of them will be possibly broken during the move to 
2.0 APIs.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CACbtZwSY0-4qPSaOGxiJnUcS-PKkS0dyjaGntYZrOsGAF=+6Zg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have previously mailed asking for directions regarding the heatmap plugin
development. Most people seemed to like the idea of having it to be done
using the native C++ over Python. With GPRS as my primary source of
internet, somehow I have manged to get the entire repo in my machine now. I
tried going through the INSTALL docs, and the total dev tools that I need
to download amounts to a staggering 465 MB. Which means it would take many
days of work for me to set up. Hence I would like to ask you guys of any
shorter route to test things out. Since I would be writing only separate
plugin, is it possible to test/debug the thing separately without a
complete compilation process involving all the tools?

There are 2 general choices that might make it easier - either put them
on hub which provides git repos on demand or github where we have an org
account. Though I need to check if the org put's it name on a github
repo if it counts against the org quota.

With the use of git there is not reason to have 1 single repo for all
plugins, that kinda defeats the purpose of using git where it's cheap
and easy to setup small repos per plugin.

Thanks,
Alex

Good evening everyone,

As this code includes french comments and a french-only UI, I'm 
proposing to host the code on my github repo to translate it. Once it is 
done any person interested could fork it and take the maintainership.

The two plugins are :
- a MapInfo's .wor importation tool, quite advanced
- a fork of the Select plugin which is core since a few release, this 
one brings feature like revert selection

Thanks Alain for sharing these tools !

It's not a critique to Manuel, but to the whole community (including
myself). I think
we should take more steps so that qgis is not released with errors
such as this,and if this happens, then users must be
warned in the downloading page (a prominent note with important known bugs).
qgis is good: warning about important errors will make users be more
confident on the package, not less.

Looks good to me, +1 for merging.

One small thing: The zonal statistics plugin is a mix of vector and raster. However I think it should go the vector menu, because the vector layer is modified (raster is only an input component).

Marco

I would suggest to self publish your plugin in the new repository:

http://plugins.qgis.org/

You need an osgeo account to log in there.  Once logged in, you can
upload you plugin and it will be made available via the plugin
installer in 1.8/trunk. Incorporating the plugin into QGIS core to
replace the existing tool would probably be difficult since numpy is
not as far as I know a dependency of QGIS.

Note the new repo does not have a very wide circulation yet, but this
will change when it becomes a default repo in QGIS 1.8.

Best regards

Tim

I think the short answer is no, you will need a compilation
environment if you wish to do this. If it is any consolation, other
platforms have even larger downloads required to get a QGIS
compilation environment going.

Will that really be enough to solve the problem of finding how to run a
plugin?

Some plugins are accessed from a category in the plugins menu, but
others create their own menu, or just install toolbar buttons, either in
the plugins toolbar or in a standard toolbar.  Maybe some are accessed
from a standard menu other than the plugins menu.
The tags you propose and the names of the standard menus and the names
of the standard toolbars don't match up.
The tooltip on each toolbar button would describe what it does, but
might not mention the name of the plugin...

Stefan,

currently I am travelling and far away from my development box, so I
personally will not be able to add that until January - but maybe
someone else may add the wrappers for the GPS classes in the meantime.

I think this is a general problem: how to classify e.g. raster to vector and vector
to raster GDALTools menus? And interpolation (from vector points to rasters)?
Multiple tagging of modules and filtering seems better in the long term (see
Analytical framework for an implementation).
All the best.

Agreed: we need a more formal approach to release, with a Release Candidate cycle.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New plugin repository and 1.7.3
Message-ID: <20111216080333.GJ23077@gnash>

I'm running 1.7.3 and trying to get a new version of
the QuickWKT plugin. New versions of the plugin are only
available in the new repository, but the plugin installer
seems to be unable to see _any_ plugin in the new repository.

Is that expected behaviour ?
That is, is plugin_installer 1.2.1 unable to parse the new XML
for plugins repositories ?

Mind you, I had a wrong url for the new official repository 
as it was installed by a development version of qgis from 1.7
branch and had to manually tweak it to get it right:

Bogus:

  "QGIS Official Repository 2" http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins

Corrected as:

  "QGIS Official Repository 2" http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml

Also it seems that _current_ (1.7.3) plugin installer removed the new
repository completely from the set of known official repositories, but
such removal doesnt' affect the user configuration.

Speaking of which: maybe the plugin installer should prevent you from
dropping or editing repositories which are installed by code or allow
you to "refresh" user configuration to match the one provided by new
versions...

No, this strings are translatable. Probably they not included in .ts files.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] github vs hub.qgis.org/projects/.../repository
Message-ID: <4EEB05D1.7050005@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

doing some plugins, and working both with plugins from
hub.qgis.org/projects/.../repository (my own) and plugins living at
github (wktplugin from Allesandro), it appears to me that github seems
to work more transparant for me...

Eg at github after a couple of days you could see that people forked
Allesandro's plugin and you could even see what they were doing with it
(by going to the forkers github repo). I could even contact those people
to ask to do a pull request etc etc.

I think, this cannot be done at our own hub.qgis.org-repo?
Or am I missing something in this?

I think it is really helpfull to see what other people are adding/doing
with a plugin. And it hopefully also minimizes the private
branching/forking of plugins.

I read something about the old jquery plugins site, which broke down,
and now there is a message at
http://blog.jquery.com/2011/12/08/what-is-happening-to-the-jquery-plugins-site/
that says: "we?ve started converting our plans into action, building out
an infrastructure that?s backed by GitHub".

Isn't that an ideal situation for QGIS plugin future to?

I am NOT wanting to throw away the infrastructure we have now! It's just
that I like the jquery plugin idea...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps as a temporary solution I think to fork (is forking actually adding a
new remote?) my repo's to github too...

Hi Richard,

There was never an in-depth discussion about the role of hub.qgis.org vs 
github.com.
Since I was involved in the setup of both platforms, here my personal view:

We want to have direct links between tickets and changesets for QGIS. 
Therefore we need the git repository viewer on hub.qgis.org. But for me, 
gitosis on hub.qgis.org is only a backup solution to keep a certain 
independency from github.com. Due to the nature of a distributed VCS, the risk 
of this dependency is low and we won't be able to compete with github.com in 
terms of features. So I suggest people to publish their (plugin) code on 
github. And If they don't want that, they have the possibility to use the 
OSGEO hosted git repo on hub.qgis.org (with less functionality).

Regards
Pirmin

Hi Germ?n.

Your tips are exactly what I was looking for!

So I can now open a dialog:

iface=qgis.utils.iface
menu=iface.layerMenu()
myActions=menu.actions()
myAction=[ac for ac in myActions if ac.objectName()=="mActionEmbedLayers"][0]
myAction.trigger()

So now for the final 1 million dollar question: can I change the first textbox in the dialog?

Thanks,
Duarte

Assunto: Re: [Qgis-developer] quick noob python question

Hi Duarte,

if I understood well, you would like to simulate a click in QGIS buttons. For this you can use the slot trigger() of the available QAction's in the class QgisInteface [1]. For example, if you want to open the "Open Project..." dialog you can type this in the Python Console (inside QGIS):

iface=qgis.utils.iface

iface.actionOpenProject().trigger()

Regarding Toolbars, you can also access them from the QgisInterface class. For example, to access the Layer menu do this:

iface=qgis.utils.iface

m=iface.layerMenu()



Since a menu consists of a set of actions you could trigger any action of the menu:



iface=qgis.utils.iface

for a in m.actions():

print a.text()

m.actions()[2].trigger()

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Germ?n

Hi Duarte,

from my experience it is not possible. You can of course re-use the ui file and implement the whole functionality on your own based on the cpp file, basically a translation from C++ to Python. I've done this before and it is not a complex process, but it requires time.

By the way, the folder app of QGIS source code contains QGIS-application-specific code, so I would say you won't find there functionality available in PyQGIS, for that you would have to have a look to the gui and core folders.

Perhaps there are other ways to set the project file programmatically from Python, but I don't know them, sorry.

Regards,

Germ?n
2011/12/14 Duarte Carreira <DCarreira@edia.pt<mailto:DCarreira@edia.pt>>
Using python is it possible to call QgsEmbedLayerDialog and set the project file programmatically (mProjectFileLineEdit)?

I normally do that operation through package raster in R.

Hi Alex and Werner,

Thank you for your answer.
I work on master branch.

Question for the future.
I found this script [1], but as I understand it updates all languages.
How to (if it makes sense) update just one *.ts?

Hi Duarte,

well, now I understand better your first question. Sorry for the confusion.

Regarding the 1 million dollars, I think I'll let anyone else to get them
(which means: I don't know the answer :) ).

I dont think we need a Release Candidate cycle - From my point that will
bring only more "confuse" into the release cycle..
I guess with RC releases we would probably have "some (5?) persons
testing the Release Candidate which will in my opinion not lead into
more bugs reported or found.
People wanting more features are using master anyway .. And people that
want to stay on the "safe" side are using the releases which (and i
guess most users are aware of that fact) can always include bugs.
If we stick to the release cycle like it is now we would surely have
more people using it and detecting more bugs - and with the amount of
people it is more likely to get some response.

>From my point of view the only thing we should do is state clearly
somewhere that software can always contain bugs and if there is a bug we
should help people report it in any way.

I dont think it makes any difference if we release a 1.7.4-rc1 (to rc5?)
because people will stick using 1.7.3 as long as 1.7.4 will be released
- leading only into more releases not helping us in any way..

Maybe I am wrong but that is what I am getting as response from some users..

kind regards
Werner

So why most respected and established projects follow this route?
Now QGIS is used very widely in professional contexts, and releasing supposedly
stable packages with nasty regressions (as it is happening) brings no good to our
users and reputation.
I think our QA approach should improve, one way or another.
All the best.

Hi all.
Looking at the redmine stats, I think one good thing for the project would be to
shoot Faunalia down: me and Giovanni Manghi alone opened about 20% of all tickets
still open (14% of the total).
Are we unlucky, or are other users lazy?
All the best.

Yes - the QA should improve.. Thats a fact I am definitely with you..
Regarding "our" problem:
I am using Linux since a very long time - and did never use a
rc-kernel.. and I also don't know anyone using a rc-kernel .. With the
user base of linux-kernel and qgis in mind I only doubt that rc-releases
will bring the effect for qgis we would like it to have (of course maybe
I am wrong and a lot of QGIS users out there want to use a RC).
So from my point of view pushing rc releases will only have the impact
of more work with (my personal opinion) less effect.
But I think this has to be discussed separately elsewhere.

I am quite happy with the release cycle we have ... And I am sure with
every version of 1.7.x it will get more and more stable (with a big
userbase for telling us that something is going wrong).

But again - I have not tested it and probably I am wrong - maybe it's
worth a try.. but from my experiences with the kernel itself our
possible rc will have a small userbase with the effect of - well -
having nearly no effect on the so called "stable" release - which itself
will still include bugs..

just my 2?

Werner

I think this was a big step forward already, and wouldn't overload
the release managers more at this stage.

RC introduces its own problems, like version strings.
Having snapshots could serve the "release candidate" purpose:
just call community for testing it.

I think it is helpful to see what others are doing when they tell you 
what they are doing is ready for you. Or it'd be just noise.

Forking is branching.
Remotes are just a way to publish your branches in a place where
others can look at, so they can do:

 $ git log richard/hisThing..HEAD
 $ git log tim/master..HEAD
 $ git log jef/topo..HEAD

and see what's being done by whom.
(syntax is likely wrong, but you get the idea)

Thats a good idea .. we could prepare a snapshot out of release-1_7
(release-1_8) branch about 2 weeks before we would like to do the real
release .. with no/nearly no/full prepared for the next release (Just in
case that noone complains if the changelof is not finished or the
splashscreen shows a wrong version) and make that snapshot available to
some powerusers/volunteer testers for feedback..

Well ... very good suggestion .. I surely can live with that (beside the
fact that I am not able to prepare Windows setup exe). So I think all we
should do is decide who are the testers and if it is ok with the
packagers whose package we need to do the work..

kind regards

github has quotas, and lacks a good way to group plugins by independent
authors including their wikis and tickets. We also can't guarantee their
polcies so hub is a backup to ensure our codebase, wiki and tickets.

As others have pointed out there's no reason to not sync your code to
both. I just like the idea of hub holding collectively all the bugs for
all plugins and the main applications in one place with an osgeo login
that enables anyone in the community to file bugs against any part.

In some ways we were trying to discourage the trend that everyone had
their own plugin server (the goal of the plugin site), the source code
was not clearly available (other than releases) and no one knew where to
file bugs.

Hopefully as we start to integrate the plugins site with hub the feature
set will prove useful when communicating not only with other developers
but users, especially power users. To me it's the users and power users
that benefit the most from us hosting our own infrastructure and trying
to make it more user friendly than github which is clearly only for
coders in the know.

Thanks,
Alex

One way to think about it is by dividing up the potential bug reporters
into groups:
* People with bugs who have no idea what's wrong and never ask
* People with bugs who ask on the mailing lists

and often bugs are fixed without showing up in the bug tracker or

I often mailed/phoned to Marco and J?rgen and they fixed things quickly
without it showing up on the bug tracker. Maybe I am lazy when
discussing things on phone/mail, but small things can easily be fixed
this way.

I think I fall into the middle group.

The things that slow me down or stop me filing more are.
1. I'd like to know someone else has it first. So if it really bugs me, I usually ask on the list first. I do this because 
	a) Often I'm just plain doing it wrong.
	b) Often it's something that happens on just one of the computers I'm supervising but not on any other computer in the known universe. (For instance on 1 of our computers we have something like Augus's georefrencer problem, *sometimes*, but not on any other computers.)

2. Trying to work out what's going on so as to say something useful. (I'm really a user, and not an admin. It takes me a bit longer to figure things out).

3. People get grumpy about duplicate bugs. Trying to work out if the bug has been reported before is painful. (and has been discussed recently)

Sorry, it was kind of a joke, not meant to offend anybody.
Of course there is a lot of activity going on outside the tracker, as it is reasonable.

Yes, I think we should smooth up the process. I also find it painful to find open
bugs (and with growing numbers, this will only be increasingly difficult if we do not
find some solution).

More seriously, I think we are reporting a large share of tickets just because
(besides dedication to the project) we constantly give courses to hundreds of people,
so we are exposed to a variety of uses and misuses, and this makes easier to spot new
issues.
All the best.

Right. I think we should make life easier for new plugin devs, so that they could
publish the plugin, the source code, and the bugtracker with the minimum effort
possible. Not all of them know about git, and even redmine can be a bit scary for
many. I also had several private enquiries about that, of people puzzled about what
to do to publish their plugin.
All the best.

Maybe as starting point we can create more strict rules for tickets? [0]

this could help, but I think searching and filtering is the main issue here. I like
very much Debian reportbug, as it shows open bugs on a particular subject before
allowing you to open a new one. Of course our situation is rather different, however.
All the best.

I agree with Paolo and furthermore think that taking action is urgent:
qgis has a serious risk of getting the label of "unreliable tool" and
that label will be very difficult to overcome afterwards.
I personally confess I feel uncomfortable every time I use it for a
course because you never know
what bugs the students are going to find. This last time has worked
quite well (except on Macs, where
it has shown to be very unstable), but thanks to the fact that I
realized the error in georeferencing before the class and
skipped that exercise. Otherwise, can you imagine the opinion of the
students towards qgis after
getting the result shown earlier in this thread? On the other hand,
styling of rasters is so insufficient that I have to use other
software to explain the parts related to operations through histogram.

I personally think that if we are a sufficient number of users willing
to act as testers we should start doing it right now, not waiting for
the result of discussions any more.We should consider all releases of
qgis as RC for us and publish the results of
our testing as soon as we can after the release. The rest of users
will decide upon our results.  I understand the interest of many
developers is having qgis as a test bed and not a producing
environment and I respect that point of view that makes possible that
so many improvements and new tools become widely distributed, but
users requiring a reliable tool must have a tested software with a
clear summary of the operational problems they will face.

Publishing the plugin on the new repo it is now very easy, and with
the new XML-RPC interface [1] it could be even done from QGIS client
itself with a suitable plugin (see code example [2]) or from the
command line.

The plugins source code it's inside the package itself, this implies
that the code is always available in any case, even when a code
repository does not exists.

Of course having a full SCM system (git, svn bzr, place your favourite
here) it's advisable for most plugins (perhaps it's not very useful
for the simpler 10-lines plugins) but IMHO should not be mandatory,
the plugin app now issue some warnings when a tracker and SCM are not
available and suggest to create one on hub.qgis.org.

Moreover I don't think we should force plugin users to use a
particular SCM o tracker system.

For the simpler plugins that lack a tracker I would suggest to add a
[Send email to developer] button in the plugin web app, kind of poor
man's bug tracking system: better than nothing. An RPC method for this
could also be added, and integrated in QGIS client.

Not *forcing*: easing it up.
For most devs, having it for free is a bonus, not an obligation IMHO.

I agree with Agustin.

Here in my University, QGIS is seen as a 'buggy' software, so some
professors and lecturers are not considering it anymore and are choosing
proprietary software for the exercises. In such a scenario there is nothing
a promoter of FOSS4G (and specially QGIS) like me can do to revert things.

I myself stopped installing each QGIS new version in my laptop because I
know there are lots of bugs I don't want to deal with, so I stuck to a
version I know works in a predictable way. I've also reported some bugs but
nothing seems to happen with the report after a while and that discourages
users like me. For me it seems that the bug doesn't care anyone, not even
the author of the module/plug-in. I remember some time ago I enjoyed fixing
small bugs in the QGIS Table of contents (TOC) but it turned out the TOC
was totally changed afterwards (by the way, I find annoying to move layers
in this new TOC.)

I think you already suggested something like an ongoing contest of bug
fixes. I thing this simple thing could encourage people to visit the bug
tracker and see what they can fix. Of course, I don't know whether you have
enough time to arrange it.

Just my 2 cents.

Regards,

Germ?n

Agus, I think that developers know about their responsibility. You do
them wrong if you think they regard QGIS as a "testbed".

In my experience, most serious bugs are fixed very quickly. But - you
cannot expect people to work for you all the time for free. When I ask
developers (like Marco and J?rgen) to fix issues, they often do this as
part of paid work (because they developed this new feature) or because I
have a number of support hours I pay them for. After all, for ESRI,
Geomedia, Mapinfo you also pay for support - so why not for QGIS?

In your courses - which version are you using? Also - for macintosh: we
all know that there are many more bugs on OSX. I always tell people
interested in QGIS on OSX that the Windows and Linux version works
better. What can we do if qt (and QGIS) is tested less on OSX?

Regarding testing: can we perhaps partition QGIS in several modules and
assign people to be responsible for QA on a particular module?

As an example, one person may be responsible for testing Postgis data
sources and connections, another person may be responsible for the
raster display, one for projections, digitizing, etc. - if something
seriously breaks in a module the responsible person should make sure it
is fixed before another release.

I for my part would help in such an effort.

I would like to have a proper search interface, filtering for components, etc.
This has been discussed, and there is a ticket open on redmine on this.

I think this is the exception rather than the rule. I see QGIS adoption increasing at
a speedy pace, and in fact eroding the position of several other programs, both
proprietary and free. Here in Italy the increase is rather spectacular.

I think this is the root of the problem: if you do not want to deal with your
problems, why do you expect somebody else to do it for you, and for free?

I care of the bugs that are a problem for me, either by fixing them myself or by
paying someone to do it for you.

To have a proper contest, we should have money to fuel it. So everybody is encouraged
to contribute, with their time, donation, or sponsorship.

I had the same experience. AFAICT, OSX users are often reluctant to report bugs; and
if nobody reports it, devs cannot know about it. So in the end, in free software
users have the power - let's use it.

All the best.

Then I'm relieved, I was just describing the situation in my university.

> I think this is the root of the problem: if you do not want to deal with

I consider those are not 'my' problems, I can perfectly keep using the
version I'm using but new users will have to deal with them anyway. By the
way, you omitted the paragraph where I said that some time ago I didn't
expect somebody else to do it for me, I fixed the bugs that were bothering
me.

> I care of the bugs that are a problem for me, either by fixing them
myself or by
> paying someone to do it for you.

That's right, but perhaps another way to care about bugs is filling a
ticket, if I don't care I don't even fill the ticket. I think this is not a
binary decision: either you pay or you fix it. You can also contribute to
the project by reporting bugs, can't you? Additionally, we users expect
developers to be cared for bugs in their own plug-ins, are we wrong at
this?

> To have a proper contest, we should have money to fuel it. So everybody

Ok.


And please don't get me wrong. QGIS devs are great in what they do and I
gratefully acknowledge their effort!

and devs have difficult to fix them without OSX running as well
(not all people have a Mac or want to buy it).

The last week I fixed a bug the GdalTools plugin was affected on
OSX standalone, thanks to William (KyngChaos) that helped me
in understand how the OSX works.
AFAIK OSX applications are mostly standalone (just copy the
application to /Applications makes it working), so OSX users
prefer this kind of application instead of the unix style.

After this I hope to see again a new QGis standalone for OSX,
otherwise fixing it was just a waste of time.

But the problem is still the same, a lot of devs cannot run OSX,
so are unable to understand where the code fails.
And also I was unable to do it until the 2 weeks ago (I haven't
buy a Mac, don't you worry :), but anyway I didn't know how the
OSX system works.

For this reason IMHO the OSX users (and power-users too)
should do more than other ones, not filling tickets only but also
helping devs in fixing it.

Just my 2 cents.
Regards.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New plugin repository and 1.7.3
Message-ID: <201112171425.10606.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

QGIS <= 1.7 doesn't contain the repo. It wasn't removed, just never was added. 

QGIS 1.8 branch and master before December 9 contain the wrong url, so I'm 
pretty sure your wrong entry was added by one of them.

QGIS master (since Dec 9) contains the fixed url + automatically replaces the 
wrong url with the corrected one.

So that problem should only affect people that run the affected master AND 
didn't fix it by running newer master (after Dec 9).

Tim, could you please backport the file 
python/plugins/plugin_installer/installer_data.py
from master to release-1_8 ?

Regards,
B.

I did a clean checkout, and could finally reproduce the problem:
it stems from the fact that your input file has a geotransform,
which flips the yaxis of the local coordinate system and changes the
origin. As the geotransform plugin does not handle geotransform
info correctly, this results in the shift you have observed.

Removing the geotransform (e.g. using "gdal_translate -co "PROFILE=BASELINE" -
of GTiff Ilerfly125v2.tif Ilerfly125v2-nogeotrans.tif") should give you
a file which the georeferencer can handle correctly (you may have to delete 
the accompanying .aux file, if gdal uses this to keep the geotransform).

I had a local patch in the georeferencer which handles geotransform
information, so this is why I couldn't reproduce the problem (talk about a
mixture of good and bad luck :-)). I will see what is required to make my
local changes ready for submission, so we can avoid such subtle problem with
georeferenced/pseudo-georeferenced files in the future. As I already
mentioned, due to an important deadline at work, I have little time to
dedicate to this atm, so it may take a few day... is there a release in the
pipeline?

cheers,

	Manuel

I think this is a time to seriously think about creating complete test
suite for all core classes as one of the main targets for version 2.0.
We can try public crowdfunding campaign to support work. I will
definitely send my 100 EUR if others will join.

Many thanks Manuel.
No hurry for including the patch, once the problem is identified and
you even provide a simple way to circumvent it.
What is needed is to have users know of these potential problems, ie. through
a note of "Known Problems" included in the release mentioning that
"the Georeferencer plugin requires users to check that their files do
not include
an implicit geotransform and use e.g.
"gdal_translate -co "PROFILE=BASELINE" -of GTiff Ilerfly125v2.tif
Ilerfly125v2-nogeotrans.tif"
to remove it in case this is actually needed".
In other words, once the problem is identified and warned, users can
rely on using the software for the rest of cases.
The question is thus that, in addition of the excellent developers
already involved,
we need a team of users and a battery of tests to be regularly performed.

Very good idea..
Implementing a known problems per release seems possible to me. But it can
only be a webpage cause at the time of release you mostly are not aware of
the problems..

Yep, confirmed.

I'm not aware of a ticket about filtering. It's very easy to create and save 
combined filters for components, etc. Besides the main search interface you can 
also create filters is by clicking on a link on the Issues Summary page.

Apparently a series of unfortunate events, including a DDOS attack, have rendered the ability to upload new plugins to http://pyqgis.org/manager/python_plugins inoperable. I wonder if we can move to the new repository by including the URL in the plugin installer (already in master) and direct all new plugin uploads to the new site. 

I spent a couple of hours trying to sort out the issues with the current contributed repo with no luck. It will take me a bit of time to sort it out, which unfortunately feels a lot like wasted time since it is going away soon. 

The repo continues to provide downloads of existing plugins---just the ability to upload a new zip is broken.

Thoughts?

Do you think a _wiki_ page would be a good idea, so that more people can
add things to it?

Hi again,

I tried to fix pitfall mentioned by Gary and implement Paolo's
suggestion about adding
categories to plugin metadata.

Added new plugin metadata "category" which contain name of the menu/toolbar from
where plugin will be available. For example, Interpolation plugin will
have "Raster"
category, fTools ?? "Vector" etc. This metadata used by Plugin Manager
to display
additional text after plugin description [0].

It is not necessary to update all existing python plugins (but recommended), by
default if there is no category ? "Plugins" category will be used. C++ plugins
should be recompiled because base QgsPlugin class was changed. I think this
if acceptable, most C++ plugins are core plugins.

Also I update reorganize-plugins branch in my fork [1].

Comments, suggestions are welcome

Subject: [Qgis-developer] JOIN error
Message-ID: <CAG4NReKk9hnZc+CfZYjnHr9Bx+vNXawQSmYSLKhyMDcf+W+HRw@mail.gmail.com>

I use Properties/JOINS to join a dbf table to a vector layer
(fields ISO and ISO3 respectively). The Join works, but
I get the following error when I  try to save the vector layer as
a new shapefile:
Export to vector file failed.
Error: Feature write errors:
Invalid variant type for field X[11]: received void with type
Invalid variant type for field X[11]: received void with type
(many times repeated)
Only 24 of 246 features written.

The new layer is actually written (despite claiming "Export to vector
failed") but only those countries with data in the dbf are available

Instead, the old Vector/Data Management Tools/Join Attributes
works fine. I suggest having that part of the Vector plugin back, even
if redundant, until we reach operational equivalence.

I provide the layer and dbf:
https://sites.google.com/site/filestemp2/home/wrld_simpl.zip
https://sites.google.com/site/filestemp2/home/owlslive.dbf

I'm using 1.7.3 from ubuntigis-unstable binaries for ubuntu 10.04

Thanks,

Agus

I can confirm this.

I also tried removing the X column from the dbf file, but the error moved to the next field with nulls (GMI_CNTRY), which was a string.

I'm a little puzzled why a null value would be a problem if the file did save successfully.

-ramon.

fwiw, this also fails if you reprocess the owl data as csv (with a csvt). 

And confirmed with some internal datasets.

(that said, I can understand why you would want to save the joined file, but generally I use this as an intermediate step.)

Hi Alexander,

I like both the idea and your implementation!

I was thinking about another pitfall (haven't build your branch yet,
maybe you already tackled this, please ignore me then ;-) ).

At this moment, when I disable ftools, the whole vector menu disappears.
So will my little plugin (which I placed in the vector menu by using the
metadata-trick) then by itself create a vector-menu item in the main menu?

OR are the main-categories now always created by qgis itself, and only
shown when at least one plugin/module is using it?

Anyway, thanks for the great work!

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ok, clear.

So my conclusion for a 'how to publish my plugin'-guideline:

1) share your plugin at Qgis plugin repo
	http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/

2) register your plugin at
	http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins,
to show plugin info, add issues/tickets and to have just ONE repository
for all qgis plugins.

3) depending on your plugin/ideas/capabilities, either
-A- put ALL code in the zip uploaded to Qgis plugin repo
or
-B- put code in git repo at hub
or/and
-C- put code in github (because it just has more features at this moment)


- I will update the 'Writing_Python_Plugins' [0] with this.
- Maybe also move the code snippets from that page to the plugins
snippets pages [1] and point to there.
- Also link to Tim's pydev debugging blog [2] in the wiki.
- 'Deprecate' the 'Python_Plugin_Repositories' page [3]
- make note of new metadata format... Allesandro you showed me some page
once...?



Ok?

Yes, this one:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/docs/introduction.rst

I would suggest that you complete/integrate/update the (static) pages
on the new plugin site (you now have staff account at
http://plugins.qgis.org/admin/ ) with instructions for plugin users
and plugin authors.

Once there is a page with instructions about metadata, I could change
messages when user uploads a plugin pointing to metadata instructions.

Metadata example:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/tests/HelloWorld/1.3-full-md-no-init/HelloWorld/metadata.txt

There is still one point missing: the new "category" metadata. I'm
wating for a final decision about this new metadata and then it can be
added to the new repo.

I think this is a time to seriously think about creating complete test
suite for all core classes as one of the main targets for version 2.0.
We can try public crowdfunding campaign to support work. I will
definitely send my 100 EUR if others will join.

 +1 - I would also be willing to take responsibility as a tester. I 
 could do the "Print Composer" testing.

I also subscribe and as I said I know two other persons (not members of
this list, but heavy QGIS users) that are willingly to subcribe too.

Should we devise test scripts to make sure that exactly the same things are tested each time and that the software meets these requirements? 

I would be happy to look into Layer Properties, attribute tables or composers.

I guess the next thing to do would be to work out some list of testers,
what they are testing and a checklist that can be used to check against
each build/release.  The wiki would be a good place to list the testers and
the what area is being tested, I'm not sure that the checklist of "it works
or not" would be good in the wiki.

For me, this kind of user testing needs to be reported on a easy to edit
and use system.   I did find a checklist program for redmine[1] which you
could have with a list of things to check off for each release, or you
could use something like Google Docs and have a spreadsheet with columns:
Feature | Version X.x | Current Build | Comments with the rows having
values like: working; broken; N/A etc.

You could then have:

Print Composer

Feature | Version 1.7.3 | Current Build | Comments
Printing | Working        | Broken          | See issue #xxxx for notes
Legend |  Working        | Working        |
...
...

Thoughts?

Apparently there are things out there that handle this kind of user testing
but I have found any open source/free ones that look good.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

The problem with testers could be that people could not have access to
all supported platforms (for example I am able to test something only in
Debian Squeeze). Most of testers do not have Macs, so it could be a
problem to say that I will guarantee that this or that feature is OK,
because I did test only for my platforms. So again, I am returning back
with the question on test suite.

By the way what are the Linux supported platforms (at least which Ubuntu
versions)?


At least, Big thanks to all devs for backporting fixes to maintenance
releases.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] absolut vs relative paths in qgs files
Message-ID: <4EEF22B5.4030707@duif.net>

I see Giovanni mention the change from absolut vs relative paths in qgs
files: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4665#note-1

We (jef and specially me) are responsible for this during Zurich hackfest...

My argument was 'why would you have absolute paths, that is not
portable'... But in the issue I see that this COULD be handy when using
maybe the qgs-files voor qgis-server? Or at least: apparently users
where counting on this?

So: to recap: should we discuss this (and maybe roll back?). Or are
relative paths just better.... Or will this end up in a war between
absolute vs relative-adepts.

Regards,

Richard

I think it's important to have both, they both have use cases  IMO it would
be good to be able to tell the project how to store each layer, relative
or absolute.  Use case: say I have a drive with my base maps and a folder
structure on a different drive for projects, the base maps server is fixed
but the sub projects can be moved within the main projects folder.

Exampe

Base maps server == \\mymaps\

Main Project Folder
-> BushfireProject
---> FireLayer.shp
---> Tracks.shp
---> Bushfire.qgs

In Bushfire.qgs
./FireLayer.shp
./Tracks.shp
./Bushfire.qgs
\\mymaps\basemaps\propertybase.shp
\\mymaps\basemaps\roads.shp
\\mymaps\basemaps\labels.shp
etc
etc

This way I can move BushfireProject inside another folder,
say BushfireProject2010 while still maintaining relative paths for some
layers and absolute paths for stuff that won't change location.

Main Project Folder
-> BushfireProject2010
---> BushfireProject2010
-----> FireLayer.shp
-----> Tracks.shp
-----> Bushfire.qgs

Germ?n,

Thanks, lets see if someone wins the lottery! ;)

I'm going to playing around with QgsApplication and activePopupWidget(), activeModalWidget()...

Hi Duarte,

well, now I understand better your first question. Sorry for the confusion.

Regarding the 1 million dollars, I think I'll let anyone else to get them (which means: I don't know the answer :) ).

Hi Germ?n.

Your tips are exactly what I was looking for!

So I can now open a dialog:

iface=qgis.utils.iface
menu=iface.layerMenu()
myActions=menu.actions()
myAction=[ac for ac in myActions if ac.objectName()=="mActionEmbedLayers"][0]
myAction.trigger()

So now for the final 1 million dollar question: can I change the first textbox in the dialog?

Thanks,
Duarte

Assunto: Re: [Qgis-developer] quick noob python question

Hi Duarte,

if I understood well, you would like to simulate a click in QGIS buttons. For this you can use the slot trigger() of the available QAction's in the class QgisInteface [1]. For example, if you want to open the "Open Project..." dialog you can type this in the Python Console (inside QGIS):

iface=qgis.utils.iface

iface.actionOpenProject().trigger()

Regarding Toolbars, you can also access them from the QgisInterface class. For example, to access the Layer menu do this:

iface=qgis.utils.iface

m=iface.layerMenu()



Since a menu consists of a set of actions you could trigger any action of the menu:



iface=qgis.utils.iface

for a in m.actions():

print a.text()

m.actions()[2].trigger()

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Germ?n

Hi Duarte,

from my experience it is not possible. You can of course re-use the ui file and implement the whole functionality on your own based on the cpp file, basically a translation from C++ to Python. I've done this before and it is not a complex process, but it requires time.

By the way, the folder app of QGIS source code contains QGIS-application-specific code, so I would say you won't find there functionality available in PyQGIS, for that you would have to have a look to the gui and core folders.

Perhaps there are other ways to set the project file programmatically from Python, but I don't know them, sorry.

Germ?n

Using python is it possible to call QgsEmbedLayerDialog and set the project file programmatically (mProjectFileLineEdit)?

It's just that seeing the issue about the wms, I had the feeling that we
forced qgis to relative paths while maybe the (silent) majority wanted
absolute paths as 'default'....

I certainly cannot talk for everyone but the structure I've seen most of
the time was:

Keep all map data in a separate data folder. Project files are stored in
the project folder, which might have to be moved or renamed. Many projects
use the same base data, which should not be duplicated because files are
huge.

Relative paths are not an option for most of the use cases in such an
environment.

Best wishes,

Anita

 funny - I use mainly relative paths for my projects. All geodata is 
 usually linked from a central Postgis database. But relative paths are 
 used for images in layouts or .ui files for forms or for scripts.

 Base map data is referenced by embedding groups and layers from a 
 central QGIS project (using the new embedded group/layer references).

 I agree that there are use cases and pro/cons for both absolute and 
 relative paths, but I think relative paths should be the default as most 
 users store the data in the same directory as their .qgs project file 
 and want to be able to move that whole directory to a different computer 
 where potentially absolute path references would change.

 It think there would be value if one could choose on a per layer base 
 whether the path is relative or absolute. This would allow for more 
 flexible control than on a per project base.

I can NOT confirm using QGIS master 08293fd on Debian Squeeze, Gnome
32bit. I was trying both ways, double click and right click.

Me neither a20cec3 on Ubuntu Natty. Both ways work. Is it a public

in my linux and windows installations it crashes with any kind of local
(qgis-server, mapserver)/remote WMS servers.

I removed also any python plugin just to be sure something it was
interfering.

You are right, currently Vector menu create from fTools. But in my branch
this fixed: Vector menu created by QGIS itself and displayed only when
a plugin that should go to the this menu activated (same we currently have
with Database menu).

Also to place plugins in the proper menu you need to use methods of the
QgisInterface class, metadata now only used to display information about
where to find installed plugin in Plugin Manager.

But ideally it will work on metadata isn't it? This makes it also
possible to filter on it in the plugin list etc...

I get an error on QGIS 1.9 on OSGeo4W. 

It errors on this publically available WMS feed:

http://gis.nbn.org.uk/arcgis/rest/services/grids/SingleSpeciesMap/NHMSYS0000080214/WMSServer?VERSION=1.3.0&BBOX=0,0,700000,900000&WIDTH=640&
HEIGHT=640&TRANSPARENT=true&CRS=EPSG:27700

It errors on both right click and double click.

I also am getting problems with another WMS feed but I am unavailable to provide the link to that.

in my linux and windows installations it crashes with any kind of local
(qgis-server, mapserver)/remote WMS servers.

I removed also any python plugin just to be sure something it was
interfering.

Ideally... But this will require more deep changes in plugin subsystem
(plugin installer and other parts). Not sure I can do it myself.

Seems there are no objections. So I'll wait to Tuesday and then push
this to master

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 1.6.0 qml files vs. 1.7.3
Message-ID: <4EEF8795.4080600@GotSlack.org>

This issue may have been around for a while, but I just ran into it.  I 
have some shapefiles for which I created .qml files in the past using 
1.6.0-Copiapo.  The shapefiles and the .qml files reside in the same 
directory.   When I try to load these shapefiles with 1.7.3 ($ qgis 
fred.shp) , I get this error:

Fatal: ASSERT: "pfi.exists()" in file 
/jah/qgis-1.7.3/src/core/qgsproject.cpp, line 1382
Aborted

and QGIS goes away.

Looking at the code, I see:

     // so this one isn't absolute, but also doesn't start // with ./ or 
../.
     // That means that it was saved with an earlier version of 
"relative path support",
     // where the source file had to exist and only the project 
directory was stripped
     // from the filename.
     QFileInfo pfi( fileName() );
     Q_ASSERT( pfi.exists() );

Deleting the .qml file allows the shapefile to be loaded so it's not a 
huge problem, but it took me a few minutes to figure out what was 
causing the crash.

Wouldn't a warning dialog be more appropriate here than a full abort?

                                                     Jim

Hi Jim,

as far as I remember this bug was fixed in master, but not backported.
I just find this commit and backport it to the 1_7 and 1_8 branches, so
next bugfix release will solve this issue.

Thanks for the double check, I open a ticket.
Could Vector/Data Management Tools/Join Attributes
be made available again?

Nathan,

I do like your idea, it in fact would reduce the need for custom Uis. 
How about saving the check as part of the project or qml file similar to 
the edit-widget option in the layer properties. Because for my feeling 
that would be the place where it belongs and I cannot be sure that 
anyone loading my qml file has the python file available in the same 
path as I do.
Probably there is only a limited number of checks which cover the 
majority of use cases e.g.
- NOT NULL
- range (for Numbers)
- range (for dates)
- max length (for strings)
- contains regex/string (for strings)
Multiple rules could be applied to any field in the fields tab of the 
layer properties. For special cases you would still need a custom Ui, 
though.

just my two cents

Bernhard

Yes, you are right. I do not know how others deal with this. I saw many
times that editor had to rather drop all updated/created features rather
than checking for error.

Maybe it would be good to have a merge of the two ideas.  Have a set of
pre-built rules (non-python) that you can supply in the fields tab with the
ability to also supply a Python file which has more complex rules e.g

if field1 == "Hello WOrld" and field2 < field3 then error

etc

Thoughts?

P.S
>> I cannot be sure that anyone loading my qml file has the python file
available in the same path as I do
Normally I would store the python file in the same folder as the project
file and ship it with the project but I get what you mean.

Hi Nathan,

you know that the initUI function is also called for "standard" forms?

So you could add QValidators to the fields and/or connect to their edit signals
and attach validation functions.

I imagine it should be possible to do have a generic "initUI" function that
does most of what you've described.  

Just that it wouldn't allow to enter invalid values in the first place
instead of complaining about invalid values on "OK".  Currently it's not
possible to intercept "accept()".

I was thinking of that, too so the majority of cases is probably covered

that is not feasible because the project file stores the DB user's 
username and password. So I advice my users to not exchange project 
files but qmls. That is why I think it should be placed in there.

that file was removed in 94fb18be and the resources.qrc was
updated according to that change.

You have to run ccmake .. from the build folder before
running make again.

Hi all,

finally I push all changes to master. This include:
 - new methods to add/remove plugins from Raster menu
   addPluginToRasterMenu(QString, QAction)
   removePluginRasterMenu(QString, QAction)
 - new methods to add/remove plugin buttons from Raster toolbar
   addRasterToolBarIcon(QAction)
   removeRasterToolBarIcon(QAction)
 - new Vector menu and toolbar
 - new methods to add/remove plugins from Vector menu
   addPluginToVectorMenu(QString, QAction)
   removePluginVectorMenu(QString, QAction)
 - new methods to add/remove plugin buttons from Vector toolbar
   addVectorToolBarIcon(QAction)
   removeVectorToolBarIcon(QAction)
 - new Database toolbar
 - new methods to add/remove plugin buttons from Database toolbar
   addDatabaseToolBarIcon(QAction)
   removeDatabaseToolBarIcon(QAction)
 - core plugins reorganized and moved under appropriate menus/toolbars.
   There are some issues with plugins that match to several categories, e.g.
   Zonal Statistics plugin. Also some plugins still remain in Plugins menu.
 - introduced new plugin metadata entry "category". This entry currently used
   only in informational purposes to inform user where he should look
for plugin.
   Placing plugin under appropriate menu remains developer task and can be done
   with new methods described above. If no category specified Python plugin will
   get default one - "Plugins".
   Also updated QgsPlugin class to handle this new metadata, so C++ plugins
   must be updated and recompiled (looks like an API break)
 - updated Plugin Manager to display hint based on "category" metadata

Hope, I didn't break anything.

Super!, Just a minor thing, all the remove methods are called removeXXX but
the add methods are AddToXXX wouldn't it be more consistent to have either
AddXXX or RemoveFromXXX?
Ciao and thanks a lot

I'm not sure I got it right, does this metadata also apply to python plugins ?

If not, please ignore this message, if yes I guess I should update the
web python plugin app to take "category" metadata into account.

A few questions arise in this case:

1 - are there any plan for making any use of the plugin "tags"
metadata as was planned in Lisbon ?
2 - the new optional "category" metadata can be any value or the
choice will be a limited set  ("vector" "databases" etc.)
3 - do you think that the category will ever be a tree data structure
or it will always be a flat list ?

Thanks

Hi Alex.
Thanks for this. How about adding a Web category? A number of plugins 
would fit nicely in there.

Not really: tags have absolutely no hierarchy (and no order).

Unfortunately I miss Lisbon meeting and can't find any page with
results of this discussion. I think we anyway should review QGIS
plugin system and make it more user friendly and improve it's
usability.

There is no limitations, but as this metadata now used to inform users
where to find plugin I suggest to limit available values with currently
available menu/toolbar entries.

> or it will always be a flat list ?
Well, I think something like tree with categories (and maybe subcategories)
and filtering capabilities will be nice. Also it will be good to move plugin to
the proper menu/toolbar automatically, not using hardcoded destination.

Alexander,

I completely agree about the need of better plugins organization in
the QGIS client, in Lisbon we discussed (IIRC Boris and Tim were most
involved in this topic) and decided to add tags to cassify plugins.
Tags have been implemented in the new plugin app ( plugins.qgis.org )
since june 2011.

There were some discussions concerning plugin tags on this list during
the last few months and weeks, you can find some specs about the
plugins metadata here:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/docs/introduction.rst

tags are just a space-separated list of words.

I'm not against hierarchy-based (category) classification in
principle, but I'm reluctant to throw away a considerable amount of
work already done in the web application to support tags and implement
a brand new classification system for plugins (which will require
another fair good amount of work).

Can you please provide a list of the "permitted" values ?

What do you think we should do when a user uploads a plugin with an
invalid category (ignore, warn, abort) ?

Talking about the new plugin web application, I'm a bit confused about
what to do at this point: adding a "category" text field and keeping
tags is the easiest solution (with potential problems with typos in
the category and no validation possible) , but other options are
possible:

* throw away tags
* implement a MPTT tree-like category structure, in this case an
invalid category will abort the plugin upload
* implement the category as a FK relation from the plugin table and
use a flat list for categories

in any case, the category should become the main navigation system for
plugins in the web app and this is also not trivial.

Agreed, but are tags and categories not two different beasts.?

Tags are just usefull searchable free terms which can be used for mental
grouping of plugins (eg I specially tagged the xytools with 'excel'
because one user said that this off course was not very obvious from the
name).

Categories are a very small fixed(!) set of (not yet hierarchical)
terms, to be used to place the plugin in a menu item.

If it seems not wise to implement both, maybe a solution is to make
current categories used a sort of 'reserved tags', which will indeed be
used for menus (and searching in plugin dialog)?

I think Alexanders plan to make it possible to 'place' your plugin in a
certain menu is great, and having tags to be used for a filter/search is
also good.

Hi all.
Apparently, the button to save edits is missing from the table widget on 
1.7.3, at least on win: anyone confirms?

Are you using a docked table of attributes?

I found that strange things happen when the table is docked...

I also think tags and categories two different lists. Tags are used for
search and categories for placing in right location.

thanks
also, I confirm the problem with field calc filling up with NULLs 
instead of calculation results

Ok, so we need a list of valid category values.

Additionally, there must be a place where the specifications for the
plugin metadata structure is maintained. AFAIK the most up-to-date
source of information is the page on github
https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/docs/introduction.rst

Are there any other places ?
Can we keep the informations there or move them to a better place  ?

Options:

* gihub docs
* the wiki
* the new plugin web app (on a static page)

Also: the list of valid category values must be added to the specs and
a pointer must be provided when the user uploads a plugin with the
wrong/empty category metadata.

All is fine, but keep them with there implementation now, I would think.

Hello!

I do not want to make things more complicated and I am not a developer, 
but in future I might write the one or the other plugin and 
additionally, there is an old idea of an "Ecological Toolbox" floating 
around (http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Ecology_Tools):

If there is a plugin which might be more of a small application by 
itself (but not big enough for a standalone app) and therefore does not 
fit into the "basic" GIS/technical groups of raster, vector... and needs 
several sub-menu items, will it be still be possible to give this plugin 
its own menu?

Sticking to the example of this ecological toolbox, I think it would be 
the best solution to give it an own menu with submenus:

Ecological Toolbox
- Niche modelling
- Landscape metrics
- ...

and that should still be possible, so for clarification: Will this still 
possible?

kind regards,
Albin

Sorry, but having the same information duplicated in several places is
not fine: it's a mess.

We must decide where the specifications are and who makes changes or
additions (like alexbruy for the "category" metadata in this case)
must update the master specifications and warn the other involved
developers to be sure they don't miss the update (for example: Gary
should also take this category into account for his plugin builder).

Other documents should only provide a pointer to the master specifications.

It's fine for me to keep the master specifications on the wiki, I see
it is already in sync with the specs on github, right ?

I meant actually: keep your page on github as first source/master
specification, eg the wiki is pointing to there.

Only thing I duplicated was the metadata.txt example (which indeed would
have been updated), but I think that is the 'problem' with all
documentation.

But if you prefer to put it somewhere in the wiki, that is fine too. But
it deserves it's own page, and not being part of the
Writing_Python_Plugins page... (but we will have a partial copy there
anyway.. I think)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Symbol properties dialog from plugin
Message-ID: <4EF1D3A8.3080709@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I wonder if there is a way of launching the symbol properties dialog 
(the one in the right of this image 
http://wiki.gfoss.it/images/Symbol_properties_random.jpg ) from a python 
script.

My idea is to allow the user to edit a symbol for a mRubberBand. I would 
launch a method symbolDialog with my current symbol as argument and get 
the new edited one.

Is there a way of doing this?

Or, is it stupid to do so and what would be the other way around?

Thanks a lot.

Greetings,

Denis

Hi Denis

You can use the class QgsSymbolV2PropertiesDialog and pass existing 
symbol and vector layer in constructor. Afaik the symbol will be changed 
directly, however it is possible to make a backup with clone().

Regards,
Marco

Did anyone else manage to get the same error loading the WMS feed I supplied?

Does anyone know how I can make a WMS layer grayscale without being able to get into the layer properties dialog?

I get an error on QGIS 1.9 on OSGeo4W. 

It errors on this publically available WMS feed:

http://gis.nbn.org.uk/arcgis/rest/services/grids/SingleSpeciesMap/NHMSYS0000080214/WMSServer?VERSION=1.3.0&BBOX=0,0,700000,900000&WIDTH=640&
HEIGHT=640&TRANSPARENT=true&CRS=EPSG:27700

It errors on both right click and double click.

I also am getting problems with another WMS feed but I am unavailable to provide the link to that.

in my linux and windows installations it crashes with any kind of local
(qgis-server, mapserver)/remote WMS servers.

I removed also any python plugin just to be sure something it was
interfering.

Hi all.
I noticed a couple of strange things in the plugin:
- the name of the layer is now blank, both in 1.7.3 and in master (it 
was automatically filled with filename until recently)
- at least in the IT translation, the option "skip first lines" is 
wrong: it says skip columns in 1.7.3 (wrong) and skip rows in master 
(correct). Aren't translations updated?
All the best.

not today with qgis-master and your WMS server, but I still get crashes
with local qgis-server layers or other WMS servers like

Nope, and I did not know that this should be possible anyway for a wms
(please show me if it IS possible).

Should this not be a WMS style?

It still won't work on Windows (OSGeo4W - updated this morning to 1.9.90-25).

I was hoping that I could somehow edit the project file to set it to grayscale. But I can't even test if I can set a WMS to grayscale as I cannot get into any WMS feeds properties.

Paolo, do you mean on the dialogue from layer -> open attribute table?
If so, I don't recall it being there in 1.6 either. It's certainly not been there for 1.7.x

Isn't the save edits button on the main screen new-ish itself, dating from about 1.6? Prior to that we were expected to toggle the edit button off and on.

Now we've got the save edits button on the main screen it seems obvious that there should be one on the attributes table - if it's not a real estate issue.

An easy wish list item?

For me, it's if the attributes are open (and not just docked) while I'm editing the layer. Then it's very likely that the rows/objects that are edited and unsaved will display strangely.

I can't confirm that one. Could it be limited to the translations, like the "Start import at row" problem below?

Message-ID: <4EF2D323.4030901@gmail.com>


Thanks Marco, that worked!

I first create a symbol using
         self.symbol = QgsLineSymbolV2()
And then I can edit it using
         QgsSymbolV2PropertiesDialog(self.symbol,self.layer).exec_()

There is only one concern, the rubber band does not accept a full 
symbol, only a width and a color. Is there a reason for that?

BTW, I just applied to this list, and I don't really know how to answer 
emails as I checked the daily digest option. Does anyone has a tip?

Thanks again,
Greetings,
Denis

    Hi Denis

    You can use the class QgsSymbolV2PropertiesDialog and pass existing
    symbol and vector layer in constructor. Afaik the symbol will be changed
    directly, however it is possible to make a backup with clone().

    Regards,
    Marco

 Hi Denis,

 The QgsRubberband was never meant as a full-featured rendering of 
 features. It was made to highlight features (e.g. selected features) or 
 to quickly draw an overlay.

 If you want full-featured rendering you can create a separate layer, or 
 a temporary MemoryLayer.

I confirm: WMS properties crashes QGIS, both master and 1.7.3, on Debian 
and Windows, no proxy.
To me this is a blocker, as it renders QGIS unusable in many enterprise 
settings, and a new version should be released when fixed.
All the best.

 Hi Patrick,

 unless iOS changes it's license policy, this won't happen. iOS and GPL 
 are incompatible.

 You'd better ask Santa for an Android or WebOS based tablet ... even 
 Windows would be better than iOS in this respect.

 iOS users need to be aware that they limit themselves in software 
 choice. I would never buy an iPhone or iPad for that reason.

Message-ID: <4EF395F2.3080101@duif.net>

I want to give http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3243 a try, but I am wondering
what the best way would be to do this:

1) when creating a bookmark: store current crs into current bookmark,
and upon choosing a bookmark reproject from bookmark crs to mapcanvas crs

2) when creating a bookmark: reproject it to wgs84, so we now all
bookmarks are in wgs84 and upon choosing a bookmark we now that (if it
is not a wgs84 project) we have to reproject the box from wgs84 to
mapcanvas crs

Another thing: I see in the bookmark dialog that there is a column
'project' in the gui. Although I have a lot of bookmarks, none of them
has that cell filled ??

Anybody a strong opinion about this?

Richard Duivenvoorde

I think the best you can do on windows is to use debugview

Yes, it is quite painful.  This is what I do:
- Make sure my mail client is set up to put this in front of each line
of the email I'm replying to: "> "
- Click reply.
- Delete all the messages I'm not replying to.
- Particularly if I'm replying to a long thread, trim some of it away if
it seems like a good idea.
- Replace the Subject line with the one from the message I am replying
to.
- Add the person I am replying to as a Cc (and maybe other people in the
thread).

Hi all.
I think we should now take blocking tickets more seriously: a new version should be
released when blockers have been fixed or explicitly downgraded.
Opinions?
All the best.

Is there a easy way to query blocking issues.

I think adding this would help to some extent:

Hello all,

Does anyone out there have any experience with making QGIS available
to many users through a Citrix Web metaframe?

Trying to avoid doing mulitple local installs.

Anyone done anything similar or had any experience? Any common
problems/things to look out for?

Or is it not even recommended?

 I don't know about Citrix, but we succesfully use QGIS in a 
 Terminal-Server Environment.

That's good to know - no difficulties at all? Just install and get going?

More fully what I'm looking at is it working with Windows Server 2003,
enterprise edition in one central office location, with those off
sight using Citrix web metaframe...

Just trying to save on those ArcGIS license costs...!

Hi Richard.
Currently, the filter is applied both to the main list and to the list of recently
applied CRS. IMHO, this second should be left intact. As it stands it is a bit
confusing for the user.
All the best, and thanks!

Message-ID: <4EF45AFA.4050009@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Alex: thanks a lot for your work - to me now QGIS looks much more usable. A few notes:
- panels (right click on a grey area) are not listed in alphabetical order (it would
be easier to find them if sorted)
- how to move independent plugins to appropriate panels and menus? I think asking
individual devs will require a lot of time and patience; bvetter a central coordination
- better sort dropdowns: Vector|Raster|Database.
Thanks again.
All the best.

Hi all,
in our organization we also trying to avoid doing multiple local installs.
With the collaboration of our sys admin we are testing Qgis in Citrix
environment.

We are facing a strange problem with client C: drive mapping.

It's all apparently ok.
Users save or open files from their folders locally (e.g. C:\Documents
and Settings\user_name\...).
Suddenly users lost their connection with local drive.
QGis in Citrix environment can't connect to user local folder, so
users can't open or save their work.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

All the best, and thanks!

I'm happy this subject is getting such a large attention.
I include the users lists in my message as this thread is most
interesting for users (actually, this is a users question
rather than a developers question).

First of all, I want to stress that nothing I've said implies that I
do not think
"that developers know about their responsibility". That's not the problem.
I also think that many errors are fixed very quickly, and if this were
not the case,
I would not complain: I would just not use QGIS.

My concern is not that QGIS has many bugs, but that users do not have a
clear list of the most important current problems they can find if they
use a given version of QGIS. This is why I think we need to create a team of
committed users that would maintain a page with the most important
operational problems
(and I obviously show up for becoming a member of that team).

The proposed list is not going to be very useful for developers, who
already have the "issues" system to which
some of us (users) try to contribute. But is very important for users
to know the limits
within which they can safely operate. The problems I had with the Join
or with the georeferencing were not
worrying on their own: both problems could be easily circumvented. The
problem is the loss
of confidence because the user thinks: "what other errors am I going
to find next?" or even worse: "might it
be that the processing I've done up to now was wrong?"

As  I said, QGIS is good, thus highlighting the most important
problems (according to the experience of users) is
actually reassuring.

A second question relates to the popular comment "you cannot expect
people to work for you all the time for free".
Users reporting errors work for free also, in the sense that
developers do not pay them. And, in OS, the rule is
that most users do not pay developers (and the reverse), which does
not mean that developers or users work for free.
In the case of R, many universities, research centers and hospitals
provide funding, mainly in the form of having
permanent technicians working on R development as a part of their job.
But this happened once R reached stability and
universities started to save on commercial licenses.
I think that the funding problem with QGIS is that it has not been
adopted yet by any university as its main GIS. And
I think the problem is that, at the moment, QGIS is still seen as too
buggy. A second reason is that many users do not
see any real advantage because the university provides campus
licenses. Well, in that case, QGIS must offer features that
other programs do not. And I personally find that a big one is the
link to other platforms such as Grass, Saga, OTB and R.

I'll take care of all GIS-Lab plugins. To modify other plugins we need
access for its
sources. If I remember correctly this possible with plugins that
already in new repo,
but most or them in contributed and some in authors repos.

Ok, I'll rearrange them. Also small question: where we should place
Web menu, after
Database or in other place?

One more good reason to invite people to move their plugin to the central repo.

To me after db is fine.
Thanks again.

*shrug* ultimately it is up to the developers.

As far as I can tell GPL'd code is perfectly compatible with iOS.
The VideoLan Organization seems perfectly happy to offer VLC for iOS under
GPL
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ios.html

 There seems to be some dispute over the App Store License agreement with
respect to the 5 device limit and digital rights management and
compatibility with GPL,
although it seems more of a philosophical dispute.

Besides, not sure there is any reason except for advertising and marketing
to actually put QGIS in the App Store.

What exactly has to be added to the plugin code now? Could you write a
quick guide for plugin devs to follow?

Thanks and merry Christmas,

Exactly what I was thinking, and then post it on some of the more famous
qgis blogs (Anita's, Tim's and the national ones?).

I can do it for 5 plugins, so... show me the way :-)

We really need a central point for plugin writers, well in evidence in the new site.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO74RWzfgcE517Xwb7+79UYQmvOGx7vf7Pnjex12GNno0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I have seen a nasty bug in Qgis Server since 1.7.2 included : whenever min
and maxscales are set in the Layer properties dialog (and checkbox
toggled), Qgis Server outputs a blank image for this layer.

I use Qgis Server on ubuntu from ubuntugis-unstable repository.
I had to uninstall it and compile 1.7.1 to get rid of this bug.

Anyone confirms ?

Thanks

Michael

Are you sure? Because base on the the layout of the dialog (filter input
above both sets of crs's) I would think it is logical if the filter
works for both.

It's (technically) not a problem to not filter the recent one, but then
maybe put the filter in between the two lists also (@nathan, as one of
the gui layouters, what is your opinion.?),

Personnaly I like it as it is now, but am happy to change it to whatever
a (small) majority wants :-)

Hi Anita,

2011/12/23 Anita Graser <anitagraser@gmx.at>:
> What exactly has to be added to the plugin code now? Could you write a quick
> guide for plugin devs to follow?

Here is small example. Assume we have plugin that defines two actions: one for
launch plugin main window and another for open About dialog. And our plugin
should go to the Raster menu.

As this methods available only in QGIS 1.9.90 starting from particular commit,
first thing we should to do is check if this method available in current QGIS
version or no. If methods available then we place plugin under Raster menu in
other case we will use old Plugins menu.

So our initGui() will look as (self.iface - is a pointer to QGIS interface):

def initGui( self ):
  # define actions
  self.actionRun = QAction( QIcon( ":/icon.png" ), "Run plugin",
self.iface.mainWindow() )
  self.actionAbout = QAction( QIcon( ":/about.png" ), "About",
self.iface.mainWindow() )

  # connect signals to slots
  QObject.connect( self.actionRun, SIGNAL( "triggered()" ), self.run )
  QObject.connect( self.actionAbout, SIGNAL( "triggered()" ), self.about )

  # time to create UI (menu and buttons)
  if hasattr(self.iface, "addPluginToRasterMenu"):
    # new menu available so add both actions into PluginName submenu
    # under Raster menu
    self.iface.addPluginToRasterMenu( "PluginName", self.actionRun )
    self.iface.addPluginToRasterMenu( "PluginName", self.actionAbout )
    # and add Run button to the Raster panel
    self.iface.addRasterToolBarIcon( self.actionRun )
  else:
    # oops... old QGIS without additional menus. Place plugin under
    # Plugins menu as usual
    self.iface.addPluginToMenu( "PluginName", self.actionRun )
    self.iface.addPluginToMenu( "PluginName", self.actionAbout )
    # and add Run button to the Plugins panel
    self.iface.addToolBarIcon( self.actionRun )

Same approach used in unload():

def unload( self ):
  if hasattr(self.iface, "addPluginToRasterMenu"):
    # new menu used, remove submenus from main Raster menu
    self.iface.removePluginRasterMenu( "PluginName", self.actionRun )
    self.iface.removePluginRasterMenu( "PluginName", self.actionAbout )
    # also remove button from Raster toolbar
    self.iface.removeRasterToolBarIcon( self.actionRun )
  else:
    # Plugins menu used, remove submenu and toolbar button
    self.iface.removePluginMenu( "PluginName", self.actionRun )
    self.iface.removePluginMenu( "PluginName", self.actionAbout )
    self.iface.removeToolBarIcon( self.actionRun )

Similar methods exists for all new menus and toolbars. Here is full list.
Methods to add/remove buttons on toolbars:

# Add an icon to the Plugins toolbar
addToolBarIcon (QAction *qAction)
# Remove an action (icon) from the Plugins toolbar
removeToolBarIcon (QAction *qAction)

# Add an icon to the Raster toolbar
addRasterToolBarIcon (QAction *qAction)
# Remove an action (icon) from the Raster toolbar
removeRasterToolBarIcon (QAction *qAction)

# Add an icon to the Vector toolbar
addVectorToolBarIcon (QAction *qAction)
# Remove an action (icon) from the Vector toolbar
removeVectorToolBarIcon (QAction *qAction)

# Add an icon to the Database toolbar
addDatabaseToolBarIcon (QAction *qAction)
# Remove an action (icon) from the Vector toolbar
removeDatabaseToolBarIcon (QAction *qAction)

Methods to add/remove items to menus:

# Add action to the Plugins menu
addPluginToMenu (QString name, QAction *action)
# Remove action from the Plugins menu
removePluginMenu (QString name, QAction *action)
 	
# Add "add layer" action to Layer menu.
insertAddLayerAction (QAction *action)
# Remove "add layer" action from Layer menu.
removeAddLayerAction (QAction *action)

# Add action to the Database menu.
addPluginToDatabaseMenu (QString name, QAction *action)
# Remove action from the Database menu.
removePluginDatabaseMenu (QString name, QAction *action)

# Add action to the Raster menu.
addPluginToRasterMenu (QString name, QAction *action)
# Remove action from the Raster menu.
removePluginRasterMenu (QString name, QAction *action)

# Add action to the Vector menu.
addPluginToVectorMenu (QString name, QAction *action)
# Remove action from the Vector menu.
removePluginVectorMenu (QString name, QAction *action)

List of this methods available in API docs, see QgsInterface
class [0]. Also soon I will add Web menu/toolbar with methods:

# Add action to the Web menu.
addPluginToWebMenu (QString name, QAction *action)
# Remove action from the Vector menu.
removePluginWebMenu (QString name, QAction *action)

# Add an icon to the Web toolbar
addWebToolBarIcon (QAction *qAction)
# Remove an action (icon) from the Web toolbar
removeWebToolBarIcon (QAction *qAction)

Hope this helps. If you still have any questions don't hesitate
to ask.

Hello!

I just ran into some issues compiling qgis, and here are my solutions.
Maybe there are some checks missing/going wrong?

Sorry, forgot to say.
Also you need in __init__.py add new function

def category():
  return "Raster"

Where "Raster" should be replaced with the name of
menu where plugin will be installed.

Hi Michael

This is the famous map units bug in version 1.7.2 (desktop and server). 
1.7.3 does not have this bug, but a very critical QGIS server bug
Solution: use QGIS server from 1_7 branch or master (or a nighty build).

Regards,
Marco

To me the logic is:
- filter the full list to find what you're looking for
- fixed list of last used CRS (quite unlikely one has to filter out a 8-item list).
Rationale: if I filter out, then I change my mind and decide to keep on using one of
the recent CRS, I wonder where the recent list has gone, and it is bothering to
remove the filter.
Anyone find my approach strange?
All the best, and many thanks.

Hi all.
Should we use the "Immediate" category [see

All the best.

Hi all.
I think we should now take blocking tickets more seriously: a new version should be
released when blockers have been fixed or explicitly downgraded.
Opinions?
All the best.

Ok for this one. I knew it has been resolved in 1.7.3. This is why I did
not understand why the new 1.7.3 did not work either. Now I see : the
problem is the new Qgis server bug

Thanks for information.
I compiled 1.7.1 and it works smoothly

See e.g. the bug gravity and explanations in Debian:
http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities
Should we adopt/adapt these, and have their explanation ready for the user?

In plugins __init__.py, in same place where description() and
name() functions. Here is example from GdalTools:

def name():
  return "GdalTools"
def description():
  return "Integrate gdal tools into qgis"
def category():
  return "Raster"
def version():
  return "Version 1.2.29"
def qgisMinimumVersion():
  return "1.0"
def icon():
  return "icons/raster-info.png"
def classFactory(iface):
  # load GdalTools class from file GdalTools
  from GdalTools import GdalTools
  return GdalTools(iface)

Sorry, I was unclear. I mean: which web page should we use to have all the info for
plugin writers? I think the page should be very easy to find for prospective developers.

Thanks for that.

Some plugins add menus in between (e.g. CAD Tools, etc.), not sure if this is
appropriate.
All the best.

Paolo, Giovanni,

first THANKS! For squashing/cleaning up the buglist. The 'activity' list 
on hub is impressing :-)

About the bug gravity etc.

My opinion: keep it simple.

We already have 5 classes, which is ok I would think. Let say 'urgent' 
and 'immediate' are .... urgent and immediate == blockers.

(and assigning a gravity to a bug is subjective anyway)

I think the best thing to handle this is the way you did today (and 
earlier in time: 'just do it: clean up the list). Thanks!

Richard

good to know. I think we should at least link it from plugins.qgis.org main page, not
to have people missing it.

I mostly agree, but I find Debian explanations particularly useful to reduce
subjectivity.
I suggest adding them to a first page (yet to be written, urgh) expalining how to
deal with plugins.

I suggest updating the Cookbook and linking it prominently everywhere.

I added the info about metadata stuff (from Allesandro) to the page 
Alexander mentions, and started a 'static' page:

http://plugins.qgis.org/howto/share/

which is to be extended or fluffed up a little (by somebody who is more 
into writing then I do) and then make it maybe the frontpage or at least 
accessible from the plugin site)

I think the category stuff is to be added to both the cookbook and the 
Writing_Python_Plugins-wiki page (looking at the cookbook and the wiki 
page.. there is a lot of overlap)...

What do you think about ditching the wiki page on plugin development to
focus work on the Cookbook?

This is because this plugins looks for some menu and adds its own before it.
I think this should be handled by plugin author.

AFAIK you need to contact Otto or Tim and ask for push permissions to the

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Data sample for bug ticket 2482
Message-ID: <4EF506BA.1090202@gmx.de>

Hello!

I got a reprocible crash on using the interpolation plugin, as reported in:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2482

Data to test this behaviour is missing, but I provide my one here:
sengis.uni-hohenheim.de/tmp/interpolation_bug_tin.zip

Steps to reproduce:
1. load data from shapefile
2. use raster->interpolation plugin with the (only) attribute, tin, set
output file
3. click ok
4. expect crash

I found this reproducible from v. 1.4 to compiled trunk version.

Unfortunately I cannot add this to the ticket, could someone please do that?

Thank you,
Martin

And here is a backtrace, it looks like there is a loop, I snipped a lot:

Thx for looking at it,

Hi all.
Currently it is unclear for newbies how to deal with bugs. IMHO we should:
- point the Bugs menu from qgis.org to 
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis instead of 
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues
- modify http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis adding a simple howto, 
mainly derived from 
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/wiki/UsingTracWithQuantumGis , with updates.
If we agree, I can implement it (I do not have permission to edit 
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis though).
Opinions?
All the best.

Hi all.
Just tested, very useful. A couple of suggestions:
- please add more (optional?) stats, e.g. Standard Deviation
- it would be good to integrate it in the Statist plugin, rather than 
having yet another plugin.
Thanks a lot.

I do not think the QGIS user base is composed mainly of wealthy uncaring
and greedy people.

It would probably not surprise most QGIS users that many use QGIS and gis
tools above their pay spectrum, personal interest, passion, volunteer and
education.
Many of these QGIS users are very passionate about spreading the word of
QGIS, and if given the opportunity would LOVE to contribute to QGIS.

If the argument keeps coming around to the problem of QGIS is the Users not
contributing monies to the QGIS project the QGIS Project needs to ask,
"How can the QGIS Project attract more investment?" , Not, "What is wrong
with QGIS users not investing money in the project?"

Back to Quality Assurance,

I am more than happy to test the OS X version of QGIS

Sometimes when it comes down to a problem of a plugin, it would be nice if
there would be some unified and clear way to report bugs (from a user
point) to the appropriate place to report problems.

As it stands, the user base is increasing and so will the reports.

How can the QGIS Project make it easier for users to report bugs without
feeling intimidated or confused as to how,
or that they are bothering developers or a burden to developers?

This should not be about Users vs Developers or Developers vs Users, just
how each group can better aid each other.

Hi Alexander,

I've branched QGIS Developer Cookbook now. If you send me the new developer
instructions, I can check and add them and then issue a pull request. I
guess that should work.

Best wishes,

Anita

Message-ID: <4EF6E3A5.1010306@duif.net>

Hi (raster) devs,

Zdenek added a patch for the raster calculator about one month ago.

I tested his patch and found some issues, and he followed up with some
questions, for which I am not able to answer.

from: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4475#note-6

[snip]
Does QGIS support rastar data saved in complex pixel data types (eg
CFloat32) at all?

I am asking, because I tried open file which I created using Raster
Calculator (GeoTIFF,CFloat32) and opened it in Grass with success. And I
also made GeoTIFF with CFloat32 pixel data format using Grass and I
can't open it in QGIS (same warnings: "Warning: GDAL data type is not
supported").
[/snip]

Can maybe somebody give him info, so he can update his patch?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I can't confirm the issue. I tested different rasters and in all cases
NULLs are not coloured. 

About NULLs I can confirm this other issue

Hi,

I think it's time to think about how we want to organize (plugin) developer
documentation in the future. Currently, we have information spread over the
wiki, PyQGIS Cookbook and the main API documentation itself.

Imho, we should decide if we want to have that kind of information in wiki
or the cookbook. Keeping both up to date produces unnecessary work and
confuses those who are willing to learn plugin development.

The advantage of the wiki approach certainly is that everyone with an OSGeo
account can edit it without much effort. The cookbook on the other hand
already contains much more information.

I think both approaches are fine but we should get rid of this kind of
redundancy.

Best wishes,

Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WFS upgrade: how much?
Message-ID: <4EF83DD3.6000808@libero.it>

Hello, all.

I've been working on WFS bug 4604 and feature request 4280 as my first 
attempt to contribute as a QGIS developer.  I have working code for 
three different approaches. Which one should be completed and used?

1. Minimal patch.  Gives you a choice between caching the ENTIRE WFS 
layer for the life of the layer (slow layer creation for big layers on 
remote WFS providers) or freshly fetching WFS extents each time they are 
rendered (slow on each WFS layer rendering).

2. Medium patch.  If you choose not to cache the entire layer, an 
expanding extent is cached, starting with the first rendered extent.  
Each time a new area is rendered, the cached extent expands, combining 
the new canvas extent with the previous WFS layer extent.  On each 
expansion, the cache is discarded and the expanded extent fetched 
fresh.  After a short "training period," local pans and zooms are fast 
because they work from the cache without requiring a new WFS fetch.

3. Maximum patch.  The "expanding cache" approach of nr. 2 above, but 
instead of replacing the cached extent each time the extent expands, we 
fetch only the NEW areas of the expanded extent (i.e., 1-4 rectangles 
around the perimeter of the cached layer extent) and ADD their features 
to the cache (discarding duplicate features).  Faster rendering of new 
areas than nr. 2 when there are many features, but slower for small 
layers because a separate HTTP GET is required for each of 1-4 new areas.

Is there a "typical" WFS user?  Do they use WFS layers with many 
features?  If so, patch 3 might be best; otherwise maybe patch 2.

Best wishes for the holidays!

Hi Anita

I would prefer to keep the cookbook as a reference guide for the
developers and merge the interesting stuff from wiki to the cookbook.
The "rst" format is better for this kind of developer documentation,
additionally sphinx (the docs generator) allows also creation of other
output formats.

We could add a short section to cookbook on how to contribute (fork,
edit, make pull request).

Hi,

I got Sphinx installed now (docs at

building the Cookbook worked fine.

I'll add Alexander's notes and then send a pull request.

+1 From me for everything to go into the cookbook too - rst will soon
become the lingua franca for the rest of QGIS docs (user guide etc) so
it makes sense to me to do the python docs in it too.

Hi Bill

Thank you very much for the usefull WFS extensions! Your patch is 
applied to master now (that was approach 2. I guess?).

Seems to me approach 2. is good in a zoom-in scenario whereas approach 
3. is also good in a pan scenario (e.g. panning back to areas already 
visited). So my favorite one is 3.
In longer term, it would be cool to have an intelligent caching strategy 
considering the used amount of memory and the already visited areas (and 
that could also be used as cache for other provider types, e.g. 
postgres, shape, ...).

Regards,
Marco

Hi all.

it if necessary.

Hi Ivan,

I just tried: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4550 which is a bug which I
assigned to myself (and am a watcher of), and which is closed by jef.

I can change the status: though I cannot see 'reopen' or so, just

New
In Progress
Resolved
Feedback
Closed
Rejected

But I 'reopened' it by 'asking for feedback'...

I see that you are in group 'QGIS Reporters', while I'm in Administrators
group (since Zurich, we were trying out some things there). I can give you
developer rights? See what happens then?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

After all I can confirm the issue (plus others reasters related) with
certain kind of rasters. I'm gathering notes and then I'll file tickets.

"House cleaning" started, but especially thanks to the devs that have
closed many tickets in the last days.

I have one doubt, what to do with tickets awaiting for feedback?

We have a number of tickets that are in need of feedback because the
issue is either not replicable/not confirmed or it misses a sample
dataset to allow replicate the issue.

We had once a one week policy to allow the original reporter to answer.

What do you think?

Cheers

Hi Patrice,
I hope santa was super nice and clever and got you an Android tablet

Marco,

You are correct, the last patch I attached to ticket 4604 was my 
"medium" (approach 2) WFS patch.  However, I have nearly finished a 
complete replacement for that patch.

The new patch avoids the earlier disadvantage of my "maximum" (approach 
3) patch: multiple HTTP GETs for incrementally adding features to a WFS 
layer.  It now does a single HTTP GET to retrieve all features for new 
areas to be rendered around the perimeter of an extent previously 
rendered (without re-fetching the previously-fetched areas).  I want to 
touch up some code and comments and test it a bit more.  I hope to 
attach this final patch to ticket 4604 by Wednesday evening, 29 Dec.

Once complete, this patch should completely resolve tickets 4604 and 4280.

When you have time, I'd like to know more about what you have in mind as 
a generalized caching strategy.  Perhaps I could do some of that work as 
a follow-on to the WFS-specific development here.

Bill

I think this is still in place, and is reasonable. Of course if feedback is needed
only to clarify minor details, but the issue is clearly there, it should be left open.

Message-ID: <4EFAEEAE.80505@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
We (faunalia) have a script for autopackaging our python plugins. I know others have
made the same. I think this is very useful, as it allows painless frequent release of
new versions, and avoids common errors.
I think this should become part of standard infrastructure, applied by default to
every plugin added to common repo.
Any thoughts?
All the best.

Can you put it somewhere so we can have a look? I think the new plugin
infrastructure does already a good job in testing the plugin contents.

I'm working with makefiles myself. If I'm correct the pluginbuilder also
gives you a makefile if you create a new plugin.

I'm fine with whatever script there is (I'm not so good with Makefiles),
as long it is working for me, and I can make it working for me :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps I also think it is good if a plugin dev is aware of the exact way of
packaging: I think it is a learning process for them also.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] What is the C++ Plugin writing Workflow?
Message-ID: <CACbtZwRXy=mXUjLYnwEMa8o1TjYYW0xcF45akUdHFnP9hoUSEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Devs,

In connection with the previous announcement that, I am planning to build
the Heatmap plugin and people suggesting that I use C++ for it so that it
gets native support, I have a few doubts regarding this.

Firstly what exactly is the workflow? My rudimentary understanding is that,
C++ plugins are shipped with the software. So I need to create a folder for
my plugin inside the Quantum-GIS/src/plugins/ folder and write my code
inside that folder, and compile the entire Quantum-GIS for errors.

I think I am wrong, because, one cannot compile the entire codebase just to
verify errors in 5 or 6 files. So how exactly is it done?

I have been hunting around the web and the hub.qgis for this info, for
about 2 days. Most docs talk about the Qgis 0.8 era development only.

Can it be integrated to files generated by Plugin Builder plugin ?

Hi,

I think new plugin repo should provide this functionality (maybe at
optional basis). Preparing archive and uploading it every time is a bit
uncomfortable.

glad we all agree. I think it would be easier to implement if we choose to have a
common repo (different github instances? or branches?).
let's start designing a solution, adapting the script shouold be easy.
All the best.

the Faunalia auto-packaging script [1] is executed as a post-commit
svn hook script for the plugins in the Faunalia qgis_plugins trac [2].

It packages the source and copy it to the repository server, but also
update __init__.py version and the repository plugins.xml (on the
repository server) according to some configuration options in a
config.txt file [3].

Of course this cannot be used as it is because we have no svn repos
(Redmine repository instances uses git), but we may do something
similar for git.

Updating the repository plugin.xml is already done by the new
plugin infrastructure when uploading a new version of a plugin.

I agree with you, but making it easier could be a good improvement
also for devs.

This looks like you have not so much experience with c++ (like me, no
offence :-)) just try..

If you are on Linux, and want to build via commandline, follow the
instructions in the INSTALL doc which you can find in the source tree, or
online on github:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/INSTALL

Try this (this is I think just the best en most accurate source there is),
so you have an idea how to use it.

To make it a easier, you can use an IDE for compiling and debugging. I
would say, try qtcreator (instructions on tims blog:
http://linfiniti.com/2011/06/using-qtcreator-with-qgis/ )

I would think it is easiest if you want to try using a IDE

And after that, just start hacking your plugins (you have to know off
course about interfaces, classes etc etc, but that is 'normal' programmers
knowledge).
Don't worry about 'compiling whole qgis for just a plugin'. Your compile
tools will handle this nicely: only the first time you compile everything
(in debug mode) and it will take some time, but after that a compile/build
will just take seconds. And it is good to have your own debug build of
qgis so you can debug step into ALL qgis code, to find out why something

Just try one of the above options first. But there are even instructions
for building it with  Eclipse/CDT if you are familiar with that:
http://linfiniti.com/2011/12/compiling-qgis-with-eclipts-cdt-on-ubuntu/

If you are on Windows... there are instructions in the INSTALL about that
also. I was even able to compile it in a virtual windows machine with
Visual Studio Express.

Tim and Jef put a lot of effort to keep the building instructions up to
date. I think they do a very good job with this. But there is really some
learning curve for it...

Hopefully this works for you!

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Let's simplify the plugin situation
Message-ID: <4EFB3279.8060603@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I recently realized that even core QGISsers do not have the plugin situation clear in
mind. No surprise, as I think we all find it quite complex. I think with a reasonable
effort we can simplify it, with obvious advantages both for developers and users.
These are the necessary steps. IMHO:
- when a plugin is loaded on the repo, a redmine instance should be created
automatically for bugtracking (if not present in metadata.txt)
- at the same time, a git instance should be initialized (if a repo is not present in
metadata.txt)
- also, an autopackaging script should be activated (see other thread)
- add on individual plugin pages on http://plugins.qgis.org:
. more info
. user comments
. user rating
- add a "deprecated" tag on metadata.txt (by the webapp) and modify the installer so
that deprecated plugins are hidden by default
- an utility should be added to send plugin bug reports (with python taceback)
directly from QGIS
- add a series of guidelines (and possibly some templates) to make plugins more
homogeneous (e.g. how and where to add an help page; if layers should be loaded after
an analysis by clicking on a checkbox before the analysis, *or* clicking on OK form a
popup after it, etc.)
- when all is ready, and in any case for 2.0, remove old repos from the installer.
Opinions? If we agree, Faunalia can help in some of these steps.
All the best.

+1 on both infrastructure suggestions and guidelines.

Both will help users and developers alike. Users will get more consistent
plugins and they should be able to report bugs/crashes much more easily
than is currently possible.
Developers should get better feedback, nice automation (such as the
autopackaging script) and general guidelines to follow, which will
especially help beginners.

Anita

+1 If the repetitive work of archiving+uploading a new version for every
bugfix could be avoided, I think many plugin developers will want to change
to  this new infrastructure.

Yes this is the way I am working but it seems easier, at least for me, using 
snapping line as we can setting different distance between each.

I think this will be solved with the new functions by Nathan (looking forward for it,

I was thinking that a download count could probably serve as an

given the answer of the developer (Martin)

"The centroid fill does not consider size scale field. I am not sure
right now whether this could be added easily, since technically we are
speaking about a "fill" symbol which does not have a "size" property."

you may want to file a feature request ticket.

downloads are a measure of interest, rating is a measure of appreciation.
a plugin with a very attractive name, who suggests a general use, will have high
downolads; a narrow use plugin, well done and very useful, will have higher rating.
All the best.

One of the shortcomings is the lack of documentation for individual plugins. This needs to be addressed since a plugin  with no documentation often is not usable. Some simple plugins can be completely documented in a single line of description, however, I have found others that require more information. I have loaded a number of plugins, activated them and had either no idea how to use or, in some cases, what purpose it served.

I'm not sure how this can be fixed easily since it is up to the individual plugin authors. At a minimum there should be a Help button that opens a dialog with some description or opens a web site in the browser with more information.

Agreed fully.

We could make mandatory an html page, place it on the webapp and in a (standardized
please) help button of the plugin. Of course a dev could make an empty page, but at
least he'll be aware he's doing wrong.
All the best.

I had made a note a while back that this could be a function of the 
plugins site (the django part). Where a plugin author could go to the 
page for their plugin and there would be a button to package the plugin 
from repo, where it defaults to the current repo state but optionally 
lets the author pick a specific tag to package. There could be a check 
box to do it automatically based on commit but that is likely more 
complicated. Personally I also dislike the complete auto solution 
because in my workflow 1 commit does not equal a release, in fact 
sometimes it's 10+ commits before a feature or bug is fixed and the in 
between states are not usable. I always tag when something is usable for 
release.

An alternate approach is to clean up an api on the plugins site that 
lets various tools push a release to it. Then various desktop apps (a 
plugin perhaps) or post commit scripts could be used to push the release 
to the website.

Thanks,
Alex

With the new XML/JSON-RPC api, uploading a plugin to the new website
from a script is pretty easy

Subject: [Qgis-developer] redmine gurus? Graph plugin
Message-ID: <4EFC575B.2060103@duif.net>

Hi devs.

don't know if it is because I'm following irc and redmine more then I
normally do, but my feeling is that there is a lot(!) of bug
squashing/cleaning up of issues going on in the last weeks.

I once worked for a project which worked with Jira. Jira had very nice
graphs to see the number of issues, versus the number of fixed issues
etc etc.

I'm just wondering if something like this is available for redmin also?

I think it is nice for both users and devs to see that stuff is moving
into the right direction.

Googling I found
http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/PluginGraphs
but it's not clear to me if that is still alive, looking in the fora it
seems not supported anymore
http://www.redmine.org/boards/3/topics/4510

I'm not into ruby/redmine, but maybe there is somebody who thinks:
"that's easy....". Please rise ;-)

Thank you for sending the detailed explanation of how to do things. I
followed the install instructions and compiled the code about 2 times. It
took long time, only then sent out the mail. I thought ccmake was included
in the package list, only to find out it wasn't actually there. I am
writing a follow up mail in this regard too.

Message-ID: <CACbtZwSEFBVa=npe+baB2OW7ELq+jNpG1Qra9TO7oXBfCxU7mA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have previously written asking for the plugin workflow, mainly keeping in
the mind the amount of time required to compile the code. After, people
showed me how to do it, I am fine and running. But I noticed something that
could be included in the installation document.

The install document tells

> You should also setup ccache to speed up compile times:
>
> cd /usr/local/bin
> sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ccache gcc
> sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ccache g++
>
> Since ccache is not in the apt-get install list, it doesn't get installed
in a 'virgin' system. I think a tip or a warning can be added along with
the above telling to install ccache by apt-get install.

Someone can add this or I would be happy enough to make it my first pull
request :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Syntax highlighting in expression builder dialog
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg8Qw3ua0t1DVOOB3ZTEBQ-D6u=sQb6UGx-=eVtoi_zOUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm currently working on adding some basic syntax highlighting to the
expression builder that I added to QGIS a couple of months ago in order to
make it a bit more user friendly. The dialog is used for the new labeling
expression dialog and the WFS filtering, with it planned to be used in
other areas at some stage.

What I would like to know is what kind of stuff people would like to see
highlighted, and how?

So far I have:

   - Strings in dark green e.g anything in single quotes
   - Field names or anything in double quotes (which is how to handle
   fields with spaces) e.g "field Name"

I want to keep the highlighting to a minimum otherwise it has the reserve
effect to what it is trying to solve.

What are peoples thoughts?

P.S Changing the coloring of the highlighting will be on the TODO list but
for now I just want to get a basic usable highlighter in place.

P.P.S If you want to see what I have so far you can compile my working
branch at
https://github.com/NathanW2/Quantum-GIS/tree/expression-builder-highlighter
note:
It's still a work in progress.

Oggetto: [Qgis-developer] piwik for web analytics?
Data: gio, dic 29, 2011 13:08


I think we use Google Analytics for web statistics isn't it?

Somebody pointed me to Piwik yesterday: http://piwik.org

It's more 'open' but works and looks about the same, and it would make
it possible to show the statistics to the world.

Sorry I was unclear: we *at faunalia* are using piwik.
Do not know much about QGIS stats. It would be interesting having them available.

Hi all.
The problem seems solved now. However, as soon as the output raster is automatically
loaded, transparency plugin throws an error:

Maybe even to 1.7.4  if there will be such a release.

Hi!

>

Well, from my side there is nothing speaking against such a release ..
Alex and me are working always to backport the possible bugfixes ..
If it is also possible to add the new repository to the "old" release (I
don't know if anything important has changed in the plugin installer or
the environment for it) then .. well - we can also add it .. 

Maybe this mail is not the right place and I should also send a
dedicated mail to the dev mailing list ..

please compile the release-1_7 branch (it's already prepared for 1.7.4)
and search for the most annoying bugs (I hope we already fixed a lot of
them).
If there is no real showstopper to fix I'll prepare the release within
middle of January if that is ok for you all ..

kind regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster resampling
Message-ID: <4EFDC3A0.7000204@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs,

Recently, I've been working on adding raster resampling to QGIS raster 
(http://www.sourcepole.com/raster-resampling-in-qgis). The changes are 
in the branch 'raster_resampler' of my github clone 
(git://github.com/mhugent/Quantum-GIS.git).

To add resampling in a clean way, I started a bit of refactoring within 
QgsRasterLayer:

- The new abstract class QgsRasterRenderer is added to replace the 
drawingType switch. The method QgsRasterRenderer::draw() is a 
replacement for the methods drawMultiBandColor(), 
drawMultiBandSingleBandGray(), drawPalettedSingleBandColor(). This 
should move a lot of code out of QgsRasterLayer and reduce code 
complexity. Currently implemented are QgsPallettedRasterRenderer, 
QgsMultibandColorRenderer, QgsSingleBandGrayRenderer
- The functionality of QgsRasterBuffer to draw the raster layer in 
several parts is moved to QgsRasterRenderer base class (same idea of 
reducing complexity in QgsRasterLayer).
- QgsRasterResampler has two subclasses for now, 
QgsBilinearRasterResampler and QgsCubicRasterResampler (maybe average 
would be useful as well?)

Any objections or suggestions about this? The code in the branch is 
mostly working, but far from being complete.
I'm going to be without internet connection the next few days, but hope 
to get the code to a testable state soon.

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

thanks Richard for this post. 

I am not sure whether QGIS can read raster data saved in complex pixel data
types (eg CFloat32). I made one file using gdal_translate

gdal_translate -ot CFloat32 -of GTiff elevation.tif
elevationGDAL_CFloat32.tif

but still I can't open it in QGIS. I thought that QGIS uses GDAL library for
reading raster data, so there shouldn't be problem, but...

Does anyone know where could be a problem?

Thanks,
Zdenek

just tested exporting from GRASS (r.out.gdal) a raster as CFloat32 and
open the result in QGIS (master) -> freeze.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bug bounties
Message-ID: <4EFDD7F7.2020101@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
As you may remember, in spring we started an experimental bounty initiative, in an
attempt to speed up the resolution of some bugs. The initiative was not a success, in
the sense that only a few bugs were fixed (4/17=25%), at the cost of some extra admin
burden. Any suggestion on how to improve it will be welcome. Perhaps we could
increase the bounty, currently insignificant, and add more tickets, to increase the
diversity of potentially interested devs.
In the meantime, I would suggest not to pay the bufixers directly (for such small
amounts it would not make sense), but wait until they accumulated a more reasonable
amount (say, 100 ?). If so, the workflow in redmine should be modified to have closed
bugs with pending payment. All the process is recorded and can be followed through
redmine: just select all tickets where Tracker is Bounty.
All the best.

It's already added to 1.8 and master branches.But 1.7 branch
still use only "old repo". AFAIK there are no changes needed
in Plugin Installer to work with new repo. One thing we should
do is simply add one line with repos URI to code.

Better to backport whole installer_data.py file from master to keep 
consistency. The new repo is second Official (=is automagically added to the 
list without clicking the 3rd party button), while the original installer code 
from 1.7 only allows one official and a list of contributed ones.

Do you think it makes a sense to also release an Installer update 
for QGIS < 1.7.4? This way even 1.0 users will have the new repo added, and 
we'll be able to safely close the old repos some day.
