Hi Paolo

Please open a ticket in trac. Possibly with the raster layers and information 
about the sampling (bbox, nrows, ncols).

Hi Maur?cio
Ok; in order to get a nice plugin (probably better renamed to "PostGIS
Raster Plugin") it seems that we need a decision as well as some quick
attention from different "players".

What we want out of QGIS is (1.) displaying PostGIS tables with raster
data and (2.) adding a query before hand.
QGIS supports already GDAL as raster Layer source as well as PostGIS
(as vector source).
PostGIS Raster well be supported through GDAL but that seems to me
more complicated than supporting PostGIS raster directly.
How to best merge requirement 2 (query) into these two raster sources
from a user interaction (and plugin) point of view seems to be
discussed now.

I like simple plugins (aka doing only one thing but right :->).

For the GDAL and PostGIS Raster driver part, I think there's Frank
Warmerdam and Jorge Arevalo (Bcc'd).
For the QGIS release (incl. GDAL and new PostGIS raster driver?) it's
Tim Sutton.

Right. So merge it with RT SQL Layer plugin?
Paolo and Guiseppe from Faunalia have published RT SQL Layer plugin (Bcc'd).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Some questions about labelling
Message-ID: <AANLkTinGjrMEa0HJp1EeJwHz2pQReDkq0YsSnNAmhzZO@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I have some questions regarding labelling options. I search in the list with
the nabble search tool, but could not find the answers to these following
questions :

* is there a way in Qgis to display the label along a linestring, e.g. for
contours or rivers ? The best would be as mapnik does, folling the
linestring :
http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=43.617869&lon=3.901034&zoom=18&layers=M

* Is there a way to wrap the label with a string parameter and a "maxlength.
E.g. "The River of the Big Reef" would become
"The River of
the Big Reed"
when applying the parameters : string = space , maxlength = 10
Mapserver has such option : MAXLENGTH combined to WRAP

Thanks in advance

Kimaidou

Hi,

use the new labelling engine, with the placement option as "curved".

Thanks a lot for your quick answers.

I missed the Layers > Labelling menu item. I was looking in the layer
property gui.

I am really impressed by the evolution of Qgis for 2 years. It is becoming
powerfull without beeing too complex.

About the wrapping option, should I write a trac ticket ?

Raster histograms include null values, which in many cases severely distorts the
histograms (i.e., images in which a large part of ocean is present or
just images
in which the scene is not a rectangle)
Also, the ability to customize the axes (in particular the x axis) is
very important

 Hi Agus,

As far as I know this is so because your raster does not define a null
value in the GDAL sense (use GDAL tools to set a null value for that
raster, NOT the QGIS raster properties)

Hope this helps,
Benoit

Hi all.
I'm strongly in favour of coordinating the work among QGIS db plugins: 
the current situation is very confusing for users, even relatively 
experienced ones. We're ready to merge other plugins with our RT_*, so 
let's start planning.
All the best.

Yes (as extremely delayed feedback to Benoit too) I plan to rewrite
the raster histogramming at some point to not use gdal so that we can
take into account user defined transparency settings etc. I will do
this when I get a few hours to spare!

All,

Thanks to Pirmin, we have Redmine with Git setup now in order to test if
this platform will work for tracking plugin tickets and allow greater
collaboration on plugin development. This is separate from the work
being done on a new Plugin Repository where plugins will be published, etc.

If you're interested in helping test, please use you osgeo login to sign
in to qgis.osgeo.osuosl.org (temporary url) and let us know so we can
grant appropriate permissions.

Pirmin - I was testing pushing my code with git today
http://qgis.osgeo.osuosl.org/projects/metaedit/repository
and got stuck on
$ git push origin master
It prompted me for gitosis@qgis.org password, though I uploaded my ssh
key. Any ideas?

Thanks,
Alex

yes - it is getting better all the time ;-)

There is one option that suprresses a label, once the linestring gets too
small when zooming out. You can specify this in "mm", so labels get
displayed when you zoom in, but get suppressed when you zoom out, because
the line is too short then for label display.

This can be set in the "Advanced tab" of the label settings with the text
field "Suppress labing of features smaller than ..."

Another advanced feature you can see there is the automatic placement of
direction arrows within the label, using < > signs. We use this for
labeling the direction of our waste water pipes. They are always digitized
downstream, so we can do automatic direction arrows within the text label.

> About the wrapping option, should I write a trac ticket ?

yes, would be useful.

Hi,

I am using qGIS 1.6.0 on Ubuntu 10.10 from the gis-unstable repo.

I am trying to open a DXF file as layer, qGIS simply crashes. Starting
qGIS from the commandline gives me the following error:

Fatal: ASSERT: "symbol" in file
/build/buildd/qgis-1.6.0/src/core/symbology-ng/qgssinglesymbolrendererv2.cpp,
line 18

If any developer needs the DXF for testing, please let me know

Hi list

There is a bug in the generation of the Makefile in the online pyqgis
plugin builder [1].
I'm no expert on Makefile generation, but I think the only issue is an
evil tabspace, right after the 'compile' rule.

Didn't know where to report this, hopefully here is the right place.

Histograms are also wrong for raster layers with negative numbers: they are
shifted to start at 0.
Should I fill a separate ticket for this one?

Alessandro,

thanks a lot for the updates! Unfortunately I haven't got time until
now to look at it more thoroughly, so hopefully during the weekend I

Having a possibility to save the data into a project would be a nice
feature. However I think that saving the features directly into the
XML project file wouldn't scale well with the amount of data. It can
work well for small datasets, though I'm afraid that it will fail with
a lot of data. One reason is that the project file would get pretty
big due the verbosity of XML, another problem would be with the memory
footprint and parsing speed - we're using DOM.

I have started to think about a more radical step: to allow the
projects to be not only XML files, but additionally they could be e.g.
ZIP files with project XML file inside and optionally some more files.
AFAIK OpenDocument format (used in OpenOffice) does this too.
Internally QGIS could ask the user and convert his data from memory
provider (or any other provider) to e.g. spatialite database that
would be included in that project ZIP file.

This would involve the following changes:
- implement reading and writing of compressed project files (using zlib)
- write a generic QgsVectorLayer -> SpatiaLite export class (similar
to QgsVectorFileWriter or an extension of it)
- add support to read/write "embedded" layers

This would also enable a nice feature to let QGIS pack all data into
one (compressed) file and pass just that file around!

What do you (and others) think of such solution?

Martin

I see that your PGP key is uploaded and not your public ssh key.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimWfAfs3dtfWkW_G3HzM0JZChmzyWk6jRpVAmax@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to add Virtual Earth (Bing Maps) to QGIS Openlayers plugin
and I have trouble on the projection of Bing Maps (i.e. alignment). My
shapefile layer (i.e.traces from the Google Maps) and other shapefile
layers are off when I overlayed the Bing map (Bing Hybrid).

Bing is far better Satellite imagery compare to Yahoo and Google. OSM
is using Bing for traces lately as result of Steve Coast (OSM founder)
working with Bing.

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:Selecting_Bing_in_JOSM.png

I know that Bing uses different projection,
http://www.cadmaps.com/gisblog/?p=80


displayProjection: new OpenLayers.Projection("EPSG:4326"),

Inserting this code above does not help at all.

Here the entire code.

The Makefile is fine. When the plugin is generate it does a build so the
targets in the Makefile have already been compiled. If you edit the .ui
file or the resources.qrc and type make, it will rebuild as appropriate.

Hi,

This is the screenshot (below) of offset - bing maps and trace
shapefile from google map.

Any ideas how can this offset be correct in Openlayers plugin?

It seems that JOSM manage to correct this offset.

I would try to omit the displayProjection in OpenLayers (as in 
http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/bing.html) and change the QGIS reprojection 
to EPSG:54004  or whatever Bing's projection is.

Your code snippet shows the Google layer, not a Bing layer.

I deleted displayProjectiion and tried these codes.

a) projection: new OpenLayers.Projection("EPSG:3857"),
b) projection: new OpenLayers.Projection("EPSG:54004"),

No avail. It did not change the alignment. It still off.

There is example Spherical Mercator Layers, for overlaying Google,
Yahoo, Microsoft, and other layers with WMS and TMS tiles (below). But
the problem with this example, you can see the layers. It just one at
the time.

http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/spherical-mercator.html

I think this is the same problem with google - bing map  and wms - bing

http://www.mail-archive.com/openlayers-dev@lists.osgeo.org/msg00047.html

According to this post below, Bing uses EPSG:102113 same as EPSG:900913

http://geoux.wordpress.com/2009/07/31/bing-oh/

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another thing, I tried to digitise /trace bing map. The new shapefile
layer is funny. It will not follow the bing map projection, zooming
and unzooming the newly created shapefile layer is off from the object
being traced. While doing this in google map, it is working correctly.

Noli,
Test the HTML directly in a browser first. It does not show the expected extent

Hi Gary
Well, what you describe is exactly what I did, and it gives me an
error when running 'make'.

Just now recreated a dummy plugin, just for confirming it.
So, to clarify:

1 - use the online plugin builder and create a new plugin
2 - unzip it and do some changes in the ui file (using QtDesigner)
3 - go to the terminal and type 'make'
4 - gaze at this output:

make: *** No rule to make target `compile', needed by `default'.  Stop.

5 - fixing it: open up the Makefile and delete the tabspace on line #7
6 - re-run 'make': BAM! now it works :)

Can you please reproduce this procedure and verify that it is not
working? Thank you

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis Mapserver test and demo
Message-ID: <AANLkTimf7_oErHBQV+3E9UpH3njpMb2ae-OLNrXRzHJG@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,

At 3liz, we sometimes use Mapserver to provide a WMS service for some
application developped for our customers. It globally fits our needs, but
sometimes configuration of dozens layers can be time consumming, depending
on symbology, scale visibilty, etc.

Since we use Qgis as our desktop GIS software, we were very interested in
Qgis Mapserver, and wanted to give it a try.

You can find what we have done here :
http://3liz.org/blog/rldhont/index.php/2010/12/03/355-qgis-mapserver-an-wysiwyg-open-source-wms-server
We hope this little demo will help to spread the word.

Thanks very much to all the devs who made the existence of Qgis Mapserver
possible.

Hi Martin and list readers

Interesting idea!  This would certainly achieve my main goal, which is to have the project reopen with the same information in as when I closed it.  

I agree that saving the the XML file could be cumbersome - even though these are only memory provider layers I guess they could get quite big.  And very good point about loading from the DOM.

Another way to achieve a similar result could be to embed the project file in the spatialite database?  That would make the memory provider data easier to use - basically it just becomes a spatialite provided layer.  The project itself becomes harder to manually edit, if you wanted to do so.  However it could easily be exported to a separate file if that is required.  And the whole thing could still be zipped if you wanted to.

I don't see these options as exclusive.  

Look forward to comments, 
Chris

Having a possibility to save the data into a project would be a nice
feature. However I think that saving the features directly into the
XML project file wouldn't scale well with the amount of data. It can
work well for small datasets, though I'm afraid that it will fail with
a lot of data. One reason is that the project file would get pretty
big due the verbosity of XML, another problem would be with the memory
footprint and parsing speed - we're using DOM.

I have started to think about a more radical step: to allow the
projects to be not only XML files, but additionally they could be e.g.
ZIP files with project XML file inside and optionally some more files.
AFAIK OpenDocument format (used in OpenOffice) does this too.
Internally QGIS could ask the user and convert his data from memory
provider (or any other provider) to e.g. spatialite database that
would be included in that project ZIP file.

This would involve the following changes:
- implement reading and writing of compressed project files (using zlib)
- write a generic QgsVectorLayer -> SpatiaLite export class (similar
to QgsVectorFileWriter or an extension of it)
- add support to read/write "embedded" layers

This would also enable a nice feature to let QGIS pack all data into
one (compressed) file and pass just that file around!

What do you (and others) think of such solution?

Regards
Martin

Hi all,

This is a very interesting idea indeed.  My personal preference would be a
zip file with the xml file inside for the project file, and other files for
the extra stuff eg memory layers, styles, images.

So:

MyProject.zqgs <- zip file with custom extension.
        |
        |> MyProject.qgs <- Project file
        |
        |> MyProectMemory.sqllte <- spatialite database
        |
        |> Other files, maybe some project specific qml files, images etc

My reason for using just a plan zip file with everything in it would be; it
makes it easier to get to the project file if needed; allows for as many
items as needed in the future; don't need anything special to view the
content.

As far as I am aware Steam, the gaming engine, does the same kind of thing
with its game files.

Just my 2 cents worth.

Hi all.
Apparently, the node tool in current trunk is not working well: if I try 
to move a segment, with 20 pixel snapping, topological editing and avoid 
intersections on, holes appear between the red and the blue line, and 
the segment is often not moved. Could anyone confirm?
All the best.

This would be also a solution, though I would prefer the former
approach with a ZIP file containing the project XML and other files.
The advantages I see here is that it would be simpler to store various
other types of data - with the project we could store also raster
layers, SVGs for symbols or any other blobs. Loading and saving these
data from/to sqlite database would be a bit cumbersome compared to an
archive.

Yes, I can see that there definitely are advantages to a ZIP format from the point of view of accessing the contents from other programs or a command line interface. 

I think either would be as easy from within QGIS - an Sqlite blob can be used pretty much as a file stream so any arbitrary content could be embedded in the Sqlite database.  I guess it depends whether you want to get at the spatial data more easily, by using the Sqlite option, or the other contents, by using the zip option.  I think that you are right, that the zip option is probably more useful for a project file.  And as you point out, it is an approach used by other software too.

If we are going the zip route, I wonder if it would be a better idea to serialize the memory data to a QDataStream represented as a file in the zip archive, rather than as a spatialite database.  The thought here is that it could then be read directly from the zip archive (as it would be read sequentially to reload), whereas an Sqlite database would probably need to be extracted to a temporary file to use.  And the saved layer would remain a memory provided layer that way too, rather than an Sqlite layer, so the reinstated project would be a more accurate copy of the one originally saved.

Cheers
Chris

That would make the memory provider data easier to use - basically it just becomes a spatialite provided layer.  The project itself becomes harder to manually edit, if you wanted to do so.  However it could easily be exported to a separate file if that is required.  And the whole thing could still be zipped if you wanted to.

This would be also a solution, though I would prefer the former
approach with a ZIP file containing the project XML and other files.
The advantages I see here is that it would be simpler to store various
other types of data - with the project we could store also raster
layers, SVGs for symbols or any other blobs. Loading and saving these

Hi,

I'v tried the wiki :

I'v made some corrections, but the last big problem is that, with the qgis-mapserver.conf, apache can't be succesfully launched.
I had to comment out the FastCgiConfig line.
Doing this i get a :

I don't know if this message tell me that qgis-mapserver is working or not.

It should work with this line.  This sets some reasonable values for the fastcgi parameters, and the defaults may not work well for a mapserver process that needs more time to do its thing.

You should check if there are any errors when Apache tries to start that would help figure out why it won't start.  The Apache logs might have something if it's a configuration error: /var/log/apache2/error.log.

A binary problem might show up in /Library/Logs/CrashReporter.

The wiki tried to interpret the URL text in the example as a real link, and you need to make sure to include that trailing '?' that is after the link icon.

As part of my project (and as nothing suitable was available at the time) I wrote a basic Python library "PyRaster" based on GDAL for scripting of raster analysis routines (based on Numpy matrices), over large datasets (1000's of scenes). Other people in the research group are now using this for their own analysis, and recently I wrote a GUI in the form of a Qgis plugin the "raster processing suite" to make the library functions more accessible to non-technical users. The plugin includes a raster calculator and a recently added Python interface so that users can develop more advanced models (image processing code is generated on-the-fly from the GUI and presented to the user). This was my first Qt project so there are still a few things to improve before relasing v1.0 (current: 0.9.3).

I downloaded and tested your plugin using the link you provided below.
On the face of it I can't see any functionality it has that isnt in
the QGIS core raster calculator (but I only took a brief look), with
the exception of your python code generator - which is indeed an
interesting concept.

The QGIS raster calculator is written in C++ and includes some
features for dealing with rasters with different cell sizes etc, and
it has been included in the newish qgis_analysis libarary with an eye
to creating python bindings for it over time. It also has some
features that yours misses I think like the ability to create boolean
products using syntax lie raster@1 < 100.



> I'm a big supporter of open-source geo projects (both my plugin and library are released under a BSD style license). There are obviously some technical "gaps" between the two projects, not least the difference between Python and C++ (I'm was a originally a C programmer), however, I would love to contribute to Qgis if possible.

Marco did the work on contract to me for a project and programmed it
in C++ for best speed and to get around the numpy in-memory aproach of
previous raster calculator efforts. It would be great if you were
interested to work directly on that. There are many features I would
like to see in the calculator which it currently lacks. If you were
interested in extending QGIS Raster Calculator I would be happy to
discuss some of the features it misses. We always encourage those who
wish to collaborate so if you have ideas, patches etc. just discuss
them on the mailing list / submit patches via trac etc. - your inputs
will certainly be appreciated.

... And still further thoughts on this ...

Basically I think there are two issues here.  One is to do with the project file, and the exciting option of using a zipped project file with multiple documents in it, including the project XML file, and whatever resources it uses. 

The other is storing and reloading memory provider data, so that the reloaded project is represents what was saved.  

What I've come to realize is that these are independent issues.  I agree with Martin that embedding in the XML file is a bad idea, as the data could become too big to reside comfortably there. Reloading the memory provider data requires that the data exists in a well known location (eg projectFile + ".data") from which it is reloaded.  If the project is a zip file project, then this is included in the project.  If the project is an XML project, then it sits alongside it.

Either way, the implementation of the memory provider persistance is independent of the zipping or otherwise of the project file.

>From my point of view this is good, as I need the memory provider, whereas the zip project file is a nice to have. 

So, for my requirement for memory provider persistance, the only real question is what is the right way to do it.  Although Martin had suggested a spatialite database, my leaning is towards a simple QDataStream.  A simple implementation could be (in crude pseudo code)

Qstring header("Qgis data file");
Int version = 1;
stream << header << version;

Foreach memory_provider
  if provider < persist
      stream << layer_id
      stream << attribute_count
      foreach attribute
         stream << attribute_definition
      stream << feature_count
      foreach feature
         stream << feature

This could readily be reloaded after the XML project file is read.

Because it is processed sequentially it would sit comfortably in a ZIP file and be sequentially read from it without needing to be extracted and then processed (as a spatialite database would need to be).  It is portable between OS etc.

If the user actually wants a spatialite database, or any other format, then they can save the layer to that.

How does this sound to people?

Cheers
Chris

I completely agree with Barry - to me it looks like a waste of time to
invent a new data format - exclusively readable just by QGIS - and
intended just to load/store some data from/to memory provider.
Additionally, memory provider was thought to represent just temporary
(nonpersistent) data - so asking the user to convert it to some other
format when exiting seems reasonable to me.

 It sounds like you're just creating another spatial data format. Why
not, on project exit, just go "You have unsaved memory data layers -
would you like them converted to [gml|shapefile|spatialite|whatever]
and reloaded before saving/qutting or do you want to lose them

Hi Paolo,

I believe there is also already a ticket open on this matter, something
like "add gdaldem to gdal tools".

Well, let see if someone is inetresting in supporting this.

Hi,

I have client requirement in which I need to modify QGIS application. I
download the source code and have built it in Visual Studio 2009
environment.
I need to add a new dialog box which will popup on clicking on the button
on toolbar. In order to implement this I have added new dialog using Qt
designer in "ui" project but I am not able to access newly created dialog
in my "qgis" project

Let me explain with you an example
1) I have created "Plans.ui" in my "ui" project.
2) I have changed "Plans.ui" properties to do custom build as given below

Command Line: D:\Qt\4.7.0\bin\uic.exe -o D:/dev/cpp/build/src/ui/ui_Plans.h
D:/dev/cpp/src/ui/Plans.ui
Description: Generating ui_Plans.h
Outputs: D:\dev\cpp\build\src\ui\ui_Plans.h
Additional Dependencies: D:\dev\cpp\src\ui\Plans.ui;

3) When I build the "ui" project I could see ui_Plans.h file getting
created
4) I want to access my above "Plans" window in qgisapp.cpp (qgis project)
file.
5) On further researching I found that I need update make file to generate
Plans.h and Plans.cpp... But I don't know how to do it... Could any one
please throw a light on this as soon as possible

It is very urgent....


Thanks & Regards,

modeling... Planning to finish in couple of months

Please help me with the question I have asked in the forum... I need to

As per our email discussion, I support the addition of this provider
and propose Dave be given SVN access so that he can directly
contribute and maintain his work. Its really cool to have such
additions make their way into the QGIS code base!

+1

It would be nice if possible for us (interested QGIS developers I
guess) to test the SQL Anywhere provider. Is there some way we can get
licenses of SQL Anywhere for personal use or is there otherwise some
kind of trial version that we can use for this purpose?

seems a really nice application, let us know about it, it will be good
to have it among the open source applications stack.

Hi All

Any objections to me going on to give Dave write access to SVN? PSC I
think you need to vote on this.

+1 from me.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Edit UI doesn't load the field's value
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=pgo_6wxq1bWo6Y794qPw8Aed7EeW7zg9w+qDk@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
it seems there is a problem with Edit UI dialog.

I have an .UI which contains a combobox and a spinbox.
When I edit a row using the Edit UI dialog, the combobox PROVINCIA loads
all the values of the PROVINCIA field, but doesn't select the current row
value.
The spinbox does the same, it doesn't load the current value.

If I use lineedits instead, it works and loads the fields' value.

Loading only doesn't work, because if I change the value and and press OK
the dialog stores the new value back into the field.

Does anybody confirm??
Cheers.

Hi All

Fair comment I guess.  In fact Barry's suggestion is pretty much back at my original ticket on this issue.  This had two components, one was the warning about memory provider layers, and the other was making it easier to save them (or more accurately, to replace the memory layer with the saved layer in the project).  Ideally the legend would also have some sort of visual clue as to which layers were not yet saved.

Nonetheless I do think there is value in having the memory provided data saved more or less transparently to the user.  For example the contour plugin builds its contours in a memory layer.  I don't want them to disappear when I save and reopen the project.  Yet sometimes  I want to save the project quickly without having to decide where and in what format I want bits of it saved.  For example when I have to exit the train on the way to work!!  I just want to be able to save the project and then start up later and carry on working.

While the memory provider is intended for transient data, I think that it is a valid user requirement that it persist beyond the user session.

In terms of the QDataStream suggestion, the idea is not to create a format, it is to persist the memory layer efficiently and transparently.  I don't think that is the same thing.  

I guess that the requirements for the format are that it is reasonably compact and can be efficiently read from and written to a sequential data stream (to facilitate possible writing to a zip file or other compressed format in the future).  Also it would be nice if it didn't generate a plethora of files.  Any other format that meets that requirement would be good, and I certainly agree that using an open format is preferable.  Other suggestions??

Cheers
Chris

I completely agree with Barry - to me it looks like a waste of time to
invent a new data format - exclusively readable just by QGIS - and
intended just to load/store some data from/to memory provider.
Additionally, memory provider was thought to represent just temporary
(nonpersistent) data - so asking the user to convert it to some other
format when exiting seems reasonable to me.

Martin

 So as long as the saving of memory layers is quick, you're happy? So
what about if it happened transparently that memory layers were saved
to /tmp/something in Shapefile format, and the location and format
were configurable from a settings dialog and saved (either per-project
or in user settings), and that .qgs files added the converted layers
into the project? Sounds like a piece of cake, meets the 'train
suddenly arriving at station' criterion (although in this country you
get an extra twenty minutes past the expected arrival time with
trains), and could possibly be implemented as a plugin. You may never
lose memory data provider data again...

 I'm not sure serializing the object to binary is a good idea, you
will one day want to load it into another GIS... Standards are a good
thing, that's why there are so many of them.

Hi Barry et al

Good point about a plugin implementation .. I hadn't thought of that obvious option - definitely one to follow up on.  It might still need a few tweaks in terms of Qgis.  The QgisInterface has a projectRead() signal that could be used to trigger reloading the data, but I don't see a projectSaved() signal to trigger writing.  Easy to add that though, and probably generally useful.

Do you know of an alternative signal I could use to trigger writing? 

Given that there is a signal to hook in to this is, as you say, a piece of cake.  I'm kicking myself for not having thought of this months ago!!

In terms of file location my preference would be something directly related to the project file .. That is obviously easy.  And shapefile is not my choice, just because of the messy bunch of files it creates and having so many of them and because the DBF format is limiting and pretty scungy!  But that is personal preference I guess.

Brilliant .. 

Cheers
Chris

Hi Alexander ,

yes, sure , i will give you more information, first of all, when i tried to
open the project from with QGIS 1.5.0 then it loads the project but one box
open immediately and its shows the following text

1 cursor states lost.
        SQL: CLOSE qgisf6
        Result: 7 (ERROR: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored
until end of transaction block
        )


and i can not click any object from my project which i load , if i click any
object then it always show the message which i have mentioned above

with best regards
Hasan

Further to this .. I've raised a ticket #3297 with a patch to add a projectSaved() signal matching the projectRead().

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3297

This should make building a memory provider saving plugin trivial.

Could this be committed if it looks Ok.

Thanks

 There's a projectWrite signal:

http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsProject.html#a935c811d84c51e908c73868be9b69c4

 which seems to be emitted before the layers are saved, so if anything

tried, but will that do the job?

 The only problem might be if the memory provider doesn't set the
project as dirty when it changes itself. Otherwise users could do a
'quit', and then qgis quits without chance to save the project.

Yes .. I got carried away and put up a patch implementing the projectWrite signal in the QgisInterface before I saw this alternative.  Though in fact I do think that is makes sense to have a QgsInterface projectSaved() signal matching the projectRead().  And maybe a savingProject() that happens before it is saved.

I forgot about needing to catch changes in the memory provider data to set the dirty state .. This was part of my original plan for implementing the memory provider data into the project file itself but I forgot it in my excitement about a plug in option.  (The excitement is about being to do it now - I still think this really belongs in the core system). 

Maybe if I can trap an event relating to saving edits, then if the edited layer provider is a memory provider I can set the project state to dirty.  And plugins will have to set the dirty state themselves (this may happen anyway, eg when the contour plugin generates a new contour layer adding the layer sets the state).  This is getting a bit messy though!

So maybe there is still some work required to provide the signals for changes to vector provider data.  In fact the project does need to take ownership of the data.  For it all to make sense it needs a projectDataDirty() flag.  Bother!

Hi Giuseppe,

I can confirm this behaviour QGIS 1.5/WinXP, data from PostGIS database. 
My workaround is to have e.g. the QComboBox filled with values and 
_additionally_ have a QTextLine named the same as the field in my layer 
table holding the feature's current value. The QTextLine is not visible 
to the user but gets changed if the user changes the choice in the 
QComboBox by Qt'S Signal/Slot mechanism.

Example:
Layer provincia_polygon with field provincia_id (integer) + non-spatial 
table provincia with fields id (integer) and provincia (varchar).
1) Fill QComboBox cbxProvincia with strings and ids from table 
provincia. QLineEdit provincia_id gets filled automatically.
2) Set cbxProvincia's current index to the one corresponding to the 
value in provincia_id.
3) Create a slot updating provincia_id with the id from cbxProvincia's 
current index.
4) Connect cbxProvincia's SIGNAL "currentIndexChanged" to this slot.

all the best

Message-ID: <AANLkTikteotFr-gX6xW1vEtrKJjK0VgTyJsDeNhVJMVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

  I love the new symbology engine. I would like to use Qgis to create some
SLD for Mapserver or Openlayers, etc.
I know the SLD Export plugin written by Luca Casagrande which does the job
for unique value symbology.

I would like to know if some further work had been done either on this
plugin or in Qgis trunk to provide an extended SLD export feature ? If not,
I will try to find time to improve Luca's plugin. I am not sure it would be
easy though ;)

Thanks in advance for any advice / info

Hi again,

Since my last post, I found Qgis-Mapserver had all we need to convert a Qgis
symbology into a SLD file (and the other way probably).
This is very interesting, but I still need to figure out how I can use it :)
Marco, can I access the methods as QgsSLDParser from a python plugin ?

What would be the best / easiest way ? Code in C++ ? If so, I will need some
help here :) since I have never coded in C++ before.

Sorry if my questions are out of topic (because already discussed / closed,
etc.)

Yes, nice comparison. Thanks Nathan for giving us this!

As a former MapInfo consultant, I can say that there is one more thing
qGIS lacks, well, not qGIS in particular but OGR: arcs. Besides that
it is a myth that mapinfo uses the same sql across all tables. You
simply have to convert every table to mapinfo's own file format in
order to work with it.

Performance is a minor issue in my opinion; if everything is a
shapefile, qGIS is almost as fast as MapInfo. MapInfo is particulary
malperforming with wms layers, wfs layers are almost impossible.

You're right, I understand that a developer can use the initFunction and
editForm
from API to bypass the issue, but how can users do the same?

Thinking like an user, if I sets the edit UI from the layer property dialog,
the obvious
behaviour is that each combo must be populated and it must show the right
value
as the lineedit does.

If the combobox (but also the spinbox) doesn't show the right value, then
it's a bug.
Maybe did I start a thread on the wrong ML? Maybe I did.
But I hope we'll fix it quickly :)

Let me know if there's a opened ticket, otherwise I file a new one.
Thanks, and best regard.

all the best

Hi Kimaidou

The QgsSLDParser in the mapservercode transforms SLD->QGIS symbology (not the 
other way round). The code is a bit old and it does not handle the new 
symbology. So I think it would be good to rewrite the SLD conversion 
completely based on symbology-ng.

> What would be the best / easiest way ? Code in C++ ? If so, I will need

Yes, for maximum reusability, it should be in C++ and in the core library. 
Like this, it can be used by desktop, mapserver and plugins. Import from SLD 
could be done based on the rule based renderer class, which has a similar 
organisation as SLD.

Regards,
Marco

Dear Giuseppe,

no, I did not file a ticket for this, although I would support doing so. 
If I customize the default edit-ui via "Layer Properties" - "Attributes" 
and choose a "value map" for a numerical field the resulting ComboBox 
shows the Strings I define but saves the values to the layer's table. I 
had expected the same behaviour with a custom ui but nope.

I do not think they can right now. They would need to do some Python 
scripting, a very good descrtiption is here:

yes - arcs would be nice to have in the Open Source GIS stack. I would
need them as well.

However, it would be a lot of work to implement it in the whole stack:
geos, proj4, ogr, QGIS, Postgis (already supports arcs, but not yet for
all operators/functions)

I am still hoping it will happen some day ...

In my opinion the support of arcs is one of the main differences between
the more established, commercial GIS and QGIS. All of the survey data in
Switzerland contains arcs. Currently, in OS GIS one has to segment the
data on import ...

Probably it would be feasible if we start with a postgis provider that
is able to read/write arcs since it doesn't need ogr. I would not care
about the spatial operators/functions that does not support arcs and
segmentize them for the action. But I really would like to be able to
know if there is an arc instead of just seeing a lot of vertexes.

Stefan

I can't reproduce that (with trunk) - both the spinbox and the combobox issue.
One subtle issue to check would be that OGR reports integers longer than 10 as
Real instead of Int and therefore the normal spinbox doesn't work.  But that
shouldn't be an issue with postgres.

BTW I don't it's necessary to ask, if someone else is able to reproduce a
problem before filing a ticket.   If you see a problem and have checked
throughroughly that you're not doing something wrong, so it's likely to be a
QGIS problem, file a ticket.

Discussing it on the mailing list first and filing a ticket it later, just make
me look for a duplicate in TRAC, because I've seen the reported problem earlier
then - but forgot it was on the list and not in another ticket.

Does that sound familiar to anyone else?

yes,

it would be fine if the results of geometry processing results in
segmentized geometries, but the original arcs should be able to be stored
in Postgis, visualized and edited in QGIS and some basic operations should
be supported, even if the result is a segmentized geometry.

I read this posting from Carson Farmer blog, "PostGIS ?select?
statement as vector layer in QGIS"

http://www.carsonfarmer.com/?p=713

Would be possible to be implemented for Spatialite Manager so it can
do the same thing for Spatialite (i.e. Spatialite ?select? statement
as vector layer in QGIS)?

Or is this already implemented in Spatialite Manager plugin?


Thanks.

Regards,

Noli

Hi.
Our idea is to unify PostGIS and SpatiaLite managers, so yes, sooner or later this
will be possible.
Of course time is always scarce, and we have a long list of priorities, so if anyone
is willing to cooperate, (s)he is more than welcome.
All the best.

BTW you can use the python console and the code snippet you find at the
previous
link, obviously after adapting it to your needs.

SL_manager needs some work, it exports very few functionalities compared to
PG_manager... But in this moment we've no time to improve it.
If anyone want help us in developing it, i.e. providing patches, they're
welcome.

Cheers.

Hi all
In fact, I have a plugin that allows to load custom spatialite queries
to the map canvas. I started it as a pet project, to see if I could
improve my Qt skills ;)

Currently it is really crude. I can make it available at the
experimental repository if you are interested.
My initial goal was to make something that could be made to work for
spatialite and postgis alike. Currently, only the spatialite part
works (and just barely).

I was trying to make a more stripped plugin, that I could just use to
write some SQL and see the results in 3 ways:

- directly over the map canvas, creating a temporary layer (that
cannot be edited), a la RT SQL style  <- this already works and it
seems to be what you want;
- saving a new layer to the database, based on the query, and
immediately loading it to the canvas <- not implemented (yet);
- just making a normal query, without visualizing the results in the
map canvas <- not implemented (yet).

Hi Giuseppe,

In PG manager / RT SQL layer, can you do PosGIS ?select? statement as
vector layer in QGIS now?

Hi Ricardo,

Can you make your plugin available for download or included in the
plugin repository?

I like to try it!

BTW, there is Shapefile 'select' statement plugin [1] as vector layer
in QGIS in MMGIS plugin. It works quite well.

[1] http://michaelminn.com/linux/mmqgis/

Thanks in advance.

Regards, Noli

In PG_manager not yet, but you can use RT Sql Layer.
Maybe did I misundestand your question?

Just to clarify my question, when you do a query in RT SQL layer, does
the query result can be displayed in QGIS map canvas (i.e. add the
TOC)?

Hello

I have uploaded my plugin to the contributed repository. I marked it
as experimental. It is called 'Custom DB query'. I did a bit of
cleaning up and even managed to get the 'normal query' feature to
work.

So, by now you can:

- run an SQL query and choose to view the result in the map canvas or
in a table format. This is only working for spatialite layers. Postgis
will come later.

Beware that I am not parsing the SQL in any way! So please be careful
about what SQL queries you write, that can potentially damage your
database. If you stick to SELECT statements it is OK.

I didn't mean to bring one more spatial db plugin to the table, when
there are currently so many ;)
I will retire this one in due time.

Howdy Tom.

I agree with most of what Tim has already said. I have been sadly unable 
to contribute much time to QGIS in the last couple of years. We had 
always talked about having these type of capabilities in the core raster 
classes but never moved forward for a couple of reasons other than just 
lack of time. One of reason was the raster class was so tightly wrapped 
around GDAL - perfectly fine approach -- but there was also always 
discussions of moving toward raster providers. So rather than invest 
loads of time yet more tightly couple features they were tabled ( or 
pushed to plugins ) until providers came online. Luckily Radim Blazek 
has stepped up recently and started to move raster providers close to 
reality.

This is a good time to start talking about these types of analysis 
capabilities because the raster providers will have to all be able to 
efficiently provide data in blocks for things like convolution masks and 
such. Hopefully Radim can comment a little on the status of the 
providers and how raw data will be made available to things like plugins 
and other core classes.

Other people in the research group are now using this for their own analysis, and recently I wrote a GUI in the form of a Qgis plugin the "raster processing suite" to make the library functions more accessible to non-technical users. The plugin includes a raster calculator and a recently added Python interface so that users can develop more advanced models (image processing code is generated on-the-fly from the GUI and presented to the user).

Hi,

today i used this great improvement for the first time and created 
almost 40 new rasters thanks raster calculator. For first big thank 
to////Marco Hugentobler.

I would like to post here some reflections:

- it will be great if the dialog for calculator will not be closed after 
every clicking on OK button,

- it will be also great if the "Add results to project" checkbox default 
state was checked,

-and it will be absolutely great if the calculator will remember the 
path to last used directory for output layers.

The ability to use equality operators is great, but what i really miss 
in comparison with GRASS Map algebra is the ability to use logical 
operators. These are really useful in complicated expressions.

BTW: Is there any way, how to set color map for raster layers defaultly 
to pseudocolor, at least for one band rasters?

Once more big thank

Regards
Pavol

Agreed. That makes the usage more convenient and they can be implemented 
relatively quickly (noted on my todo list).

Hopefully something for the near future too. I opened an enhancement ticket in 
trac.

Not that I know. I remember that a default raster symbology for new layers was 
mentioned as a wish several times before.

Marco

Hi all
I've added a new version of this plugin (v 0.2).
It is now possible to query spatialite and postgis layers. The results
are displayed on the map canvas or as a table. I added a small help
page to the plugin as well. I started writing some documentation on
how to use it, but it is still unfinished.

A small gotcha: if you decide to test it with postgis layers, don't
forget to include the schema name when you reference a table.

Please let me have some feedback, if you have the time to test it out. Thanks

Hi,

Plugin Analysis/Point sampling tool should merge the table of
the point layer with the data extracted (at least optionally).
Otherwise the user must define
an ID for the new layer, (eventually also for the one with the sampling points)
and then use vector/Join Attributes.

Is the trac for plugins up?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Launchpad download stats script
Message-ID: <4D02E378.9000705@wildintellect.com>

Question came up today of how many QGIS users are there. Since the
downloads happen from at least 4-5 major sites
(kyngchaos,osgeo4w,launchpad,elgis,qgis.org) of which only one is
directly a QGIS server the numbers are obviously short.

Doing some digging there's a new api addition for launchpad that lets
you get the data (soon to show up on the web interface too). The stats
aren't quite there yet, pending full web log scans on launchpad's side
but I wrote script this afternooon that is ready to start pulling the
data as soon as it's there. Example csv output is up to, just with
obviously wrong numbers.

http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~wildintellect/+junk/launchpadapi-examples/files

Inspiration was from this ticket
https://bugs.launchpad.net/soyuz/+bug/139855

Just thought this might be of use to others. QGIS team, Tim and I talked
about working this python script into the Django site so we can list the
number of Ubuntu downloads anytime we want and aggregate it with other
stats we have.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi,

I'm try to test the geometryless capability of qgis.

I'm see-ing qgis report an error because
"there were no columns in the table that are suitable as a qgis key (an 
unique index and int4 type).

This is true, my table geometryless is without an int4 field.

Meanwhile I know this is a "must" for a Geometry table I don't know
if this still a "must" for a geometryless table or is a bug.

Thx,

Each feature needs to be uniquely identifiable, so yes, it must have a unique
id field - whether or not it has geometry doesn't matter.

Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E06D0BBEF3D@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All

I've submitted a patch for the delimited text plugin to fix an issue raised on the qgis-user list, where QGis is crashed by the plugin when it reads text files in which some rows have missing fields (common if the last fields are null/blank).  

The patch fixes this by adding blank fields to deficient rows.

The patch is http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3320

If this looks Ok could it be committed?  

Also I've submitted a patch relating the delimited text plugins to fix a corruption of the datasourceUri in the project file when the project is using relative paths and the delimiter contains "\" characters.  Would be good to have this applied to :-)

Thanks
Chris

Ah that's an interesting site, but note how the data is collected.
"This site publishes the statistics gathered from report send by users
of the popularity-contest package. This package sends the list of
packages installed and the access time of relevant files to the server
weekly." So it's an opt-in sub sample of the population.

There is some useful data to be had here though, since its essentially a
subsample of the population we might be able to test against the ppa
numbers to estimate how many people who download actually use qgis on
regular basis.

#<name> is the package name;
#<inst> is the number of people who installed this package;
#<vote> is the number of people who use this package regularly;
#<old> is the number of people who installed, but don't use this package
#        regularly;
#<recent> is the number of people who upgraded this package recently;
#<no-files> is the number of people whose entry didn't contain enough

I read this as 12% of downloaders use on a regular basis, of course that
may actually be higher for the ppa, since it takes extra work to enable
the ppa. It's also unclear if the ppa is included in this sampling method.

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Remove geoprocessing plugin?
Message-ID: <AANLkTimwMXEHm0xugGFNC6=WdF0gnUzVcR3Rot5LdUsK@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

there is an old geoprocessing (c++) plugin in the sources
(src/plugins/geoprocessing). I've found out that it has been disabled
for several releases (it disabled in qgis 1.0, probably even earlier)
and has just basic functionality for creating a buffer for a PostGIS
layer. It seems to be unmaintained and given that there is fTools
plugin which implements this functionality, I think it should be safe
to remove the code from trunk.

Any objections?

Regards
Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin icons
Message-ID: <AANLkTikeoYGXyuwwqOmwdzG8ZPpBM-K_ptHtB+rExFOx@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone (especially plugin developers)

I've just committed to trunk (in r14897) a bit of eye candy: plugins
can now be associated with an icon, making the plugin manager dialog
more colorful. I hope the icons will help with orientation in that
long list of plugins. Plugin developers are welcome to assign icons to
their plugins!

How to add icon for your plugin to plugin manager:
In plugin's __init__.py file add new icon() method:

def icon():
  return "images/my-icon.png"

That's all. Plugin manager will load the icon and put it next to the
plugin's name. The path to the icon should be relative to the plugin's
directory. Any image type supported by Qt is supported, though PNG is
highly preferred since it is lossless and supports transparency with
alpha channel.

At some point the new plugin repository (currently under development)
should be able to automatically parse the icon file name, retrieve the
icon from plugin's zip archive and make it available to plugin
installer to download icons for the available plugins.

Comments are welcome :-)

Regards
Martin

Hi QGIS developers and Users

Last week we received an offer from kCube Consulting
(http://www.kcubeconsulting.com/) to donate 6 months of developer time
to our favourite Open Source GIS application - QGIS! Since we are an
open community, we would like to extend to you all the opportunity to
have your say about what would be the most beneficial use of this
developer's time for the project. Perhaps there is something that
prevents you using QGIS to get your daily work done? Perhaps you are a
developer working on a large feature and need some dedicated help? Now
is the time to have your say...visit
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/KCube-developer to provide your inputs.

Many thanks to kCube for their generous offer!

Best regards,

Hi Tim,

This is cool.

Without knowing their expertise, here are issues from my wishlist:

* support for circular arc strings (in the Postgis provider), viewing 
and editing of circular arcs - postgis can already store them
* native Oracle spatial provider (similar to the Postgis provider)
* Better forms support: provide an alternative forms view to the table 
view where one can
     - skim through the individual records or jump to first/last
     - filter by certain fields and the forms list would only display 
the selection
     - globally update certain fields from the forms view on all the 
selected records
     - add a new record --> results in a new blank form
     - delete the selected records from the form
     - highlight the associated geometry from the form
     - define "required" fields for the form that must be filled out 
(marked red)
     - support of default values/reference data sets
* integration of a report builder, allows generation of reports from 
attributes and map views - maybe an open source report builder would 
exists - something like Jasper (this is Java, unfortunately)

For the forms support I am attaching a screenshot from a topobase form. 
See the bottom toolbar that allows to go from one record to the next, 
delete, filter, highlight, create new records, etc.

Hi Tim,

These items could be added to the wish-list :
- improved svg export (layer, groups, resolution, fonts, etc.)
- more efficient label engine (faster, more rules, etc.)
- port nviz to Qt or embed paraview to get 3D support in QGIS

jean roc

Hi all,

my 2 cents go to add color ramps for rasters (help improve and integrate
in QGIS raster properties the "1-band raster colour table" plugin by
Benoit de Cabissole) plus legend raster symbology. See also
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/782

cheers

Hi Paolo, all

Uploaded a new version (v0.3) of the 'Custom DB query' plugin.

I've added it to the 'database' menu. Also, it is now possible to save
the result of the SQL query as a new table in its corresponding
database.

So, to summarize, you can run SQL queries over postgis or spatialite
databases and get the results:

- in a table view
- as a 'real time' layer displayed over the map canvas
- as a new table, that gets saved to the database and is immediately
loaded to the map canvas

It is still pretty raw, so I'm keeping it in the 'experimental'
section, but it seems to work OK with my small test datasets.

Hi Ricardo,
nice plugin. For me the best feature is that it is possible to load
and visualize every PostGIS query, not only queries based on real
tables (this is what I miss in perfect 'RT_' plugins).

But after upgrading to v. 3.0 I get following traceback when trying to
load every query in PostGIS (for example: SELECT * from schema.table).

?Traceback (most recent call last):

Hi Ricardo,

Nice plugin.

One suggestion, I think it would be good to add "Table" in the tab so
we can see the attributes of the table we want to queries and
manipulate.

      Query - Table - Result

You can lift / copy the codes from Spatialite Manager and PostGIS
Manager plugins. You can probably put a check box as well for the
Spatiial and PostGIS in the "Table" as well.

The "Preview"? It is one o you if you want to include it as well :-).

Thanks.

Regards, Noli

I think moving to new symbology, and dropping the old one, would be very good.
Also, shortening the too long bug queue is a priority, IMHO.
Thanks a lot KCube!
All the best.

Hi all.
Several db plugins are still outside the Database menu, e.g.:

- Export to MySQL
This is confusing to users.
Could the authors please move them?
Thanks a lot.

Hi Tim,

I'm trying to figure out how to add my suggestions.  According to the
wiki, "If you want to contribute to the wiki, please create an account
and use a wiki name in the form FirstnameLastname. Before you are
allowed to edit content, you have to confirm your account by visiting
a link that was sent to your email address. "  I looked around the
wiki, but couldn't figure out how to create an account.

Thanks!

What did you mean?
The RT_Sql_Layer permits to load every PostGIS query, not table based only.
So I cannot understand, what do you miss in RT_Sql_Layer?

I think we need to be careful about removing functionality that people are using. In particular I'm thinking of the copyright plugin.

 The copyright attribution should possibly be part of a project's
metadata. The project properties dialog is a bit thin on metadata, it
just has a title for the project. Would it be a good idea to have
copyright, authors, description etc as properties attached to a
project? Is there a plugin for this already? The Metadata plugin is
for layers only.... Hmmm anyone wnat to write a Dublin Core metadata
editor plugin for project files?

Hi Giuseppe, when I pressed 'send' button in my email client I
realized, that I need to provide some example.
In general, I was failing to load the result generated by PLPgSQL
function which had no relation to any existing layer.
I can provide some usefull examples by time.

Thanks a lot for Your plugins.

indeed it would be nice to have more metadata on a project. Also, QGIS
Server (the WMS part of it) requires metadata like contact person,
organization, etc. for the creation of the WMS contact metadata part.
Currently one has to specify a separate XML fragment for this metadata. It
would be much nicer, if such information could be extracted from the
project file.

If someone works on the project metadata, it should be aligned with the
needs of QGIS server.

+1 on the bugs queue. 

If we want to be sincere about qgis being multi-platform, Mac (and I believe Windows, based on list emails) has issues that need to be addressed. The bugtracker has some of them, but dedicated developer time working across platforms to try and bring parity to features and operations would be great. Of course, the list already looks like it exceeds a 6-month timeframe.

Kudos to Kcube for funding this time, no matter what gets taken care of from that support!

Cheers,
John

Hi all.
I'm getting repeated errors while loading PostGIS rasters in QGIS.
Any idea?

Seems like a gui bug on the plugin. I'm going to review it. But as it says,
it's failing to connect to the data. Are you using gdal 1.7 or higher?
Could you tell us the test evironment?
Thanks for the information.

Are you testing on ubuntu/Debian? I had to install pyqt4's psql driver by
hand. I don' t remeber exactly the driver's name. I think it's something
like libqt4-psql.
I've used pyqt4 for table listing. I don't know what's going to be QGIS'
default pg library, but it's easily replaced.
Integration with PostgisManager? It can be done. But I was thinking about
moving the plugin to the Layer menu (as I did with RGB Composition Plugin).
IMHO plugins that load data should be with the other data loading
interfaces. What do you think would be best for the users?
Best regards,
Mauricio

IIRC annotations are always bound to a particular position on map, so
they're a bit different than the copyright label that is always in the
corner...

Hi all

I uploaded v 0.3.1 that (hopefully) fixes the bug you are refering.

I will think about adding Noli's feature requests, which seem
reasonable enough. My initial plan was to have a quick'n'dirty plugin
to query databases, while we waited for a great
postgis/spatialite-super-manager! so I am reluctant to add too much to
this plugin. I would like to polish it a bit more though.
One thing I'd like to implement is having the plugin's window to be
modeless, so that it becomes possible to add and remove layers from
the map canvas without having to close the window.

The screen position is kept constant if you go to the item properties dialog 
(double click) and uncheck 'Fixed map position'.

Hi, I wrote example PLPGSQL function, which demonstrates the case
where I was not able to load query using RT SQL Layer. Now it works
perfectly.
So, hats off and thanks You a lot for Your work.

For reference, my test function is attached in this email.

there is a nice plugin: EasyPrint, that could replace QuickPrint, after some tuning
(e.g. replacing the heading). I suggest to add it to trunk.

I remember there was a copyright python plugin; I think this could replace the C++
implementation, being more flexible.

All the best.

Yes, I'm on Debian.
In fact:
Warning: QSqlDatabase: QPSQL driver not loaded
Installing libqt4-sql-psql does the trick.
However, I have the server on another machine, and the pg versions do not match, so I
get Warning: This version of PostgreSQL is not supported and may not work.
And in fact it does not work well: the raster is loaded, but I only get NULLs and 0
instead of true values. Unsure, however, if the raster was loaded correctly in the db.

On the machine where I have the db, I get instead (but this coudl be to mismatching
pg versions, as I have both 8.4 and 9.0 istalled):
Error:
	GDAL Error 4: `PG: dbname=nove host=localhost user=nove password=***** port=5433

I think it would be good not to add further cryptodependencies.

I think the best would be to integrate with both "Add PostGIS vector" for loading and
with PostGIS manager for previewing and loading.

All the best, and thanks a lot!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin Issue Tracking and Code Repo - vote?
Message-ID: <4D073179.2010604@wildintellect.com>

So it's been a couple of weeks since we got the Redmine + Git instance
up. A handful of people have looked at it. Tim and Paolo both think it's
adequate for the need of centralizing ticket tracking for plugins and
optionally hosting or syncing git repos for plugins too.

Next steps:
1.Can we get some sort of vote of confidence to go ahead and
announce/open it up for usage?
2.What url should we put it at? It could be a subpage of the new django
url or something along those lines.
Some ideas:
plugins.qgis.org/scm
scm.qgis.org
plugins.qgis.org/development

The current site is qgis.osgeo.osuosl.org and osgeo logins work for it
(same as trac). I'll work with Pirmin to look at re-skinning Redmine
with the QGIS website theme.

Thanks,
Alex

I didn't have a thorough look, but it seems that only HTTP is
available for logging in. Would it be possible to have also HTTPS at
least for the login? I use my login for committing to svn, so I don't
feel very confident to send my password in plain text over the
network...

Yes I have seen the option to turn on https in Redmine, not sure how to
set it up to do both. But will check and get back on that.

Note, that code commits are via ssh key so that's less of an issue for
at least one part of the site.

Thanks,

Let's wait for Marco's additions to composer (as mentioned by him on
kcube dev wiki page).

This was actually historically the first qgis python plugin ever
written :-) I have ported it from c++ to Python just to see whether
the bindings and plugin infrastructure work correctly.

I don't know what to do with the whole bunch of simple "decoration"
plugins: maybe their functionality could be best ported directly into
qgis application and we would (maybe) save some time during the qgis
startup since we will avoid loading of few modules.

I like plugins.qgis.org/tickets; other ideas are:

plugins.qgis.org/trac
plugins.qgis.org/bugs

I have a question for someone skilled in redmine. I have redmine bug
tracker for OGR2Layers on my server [0] and I would know if it is
possible backup the project and restore it in the new redmine qgis

I'm still checking the details but I think it's possible. What version
of Redmine are you currently running? What backend db are you using?

+0.5 for dev / development.
As users can think it's a space for developers only, something like
"tickets" would be better.

thanks for the great work!

I've stumbled into a problem with some raster too. It seems like a gdal bug.
But I could get it to work with the image available at:
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/frmts_wtkraster.html
Looks like gdal is still improving the non-regular raster reading and
performance.
Well.. then I'm going to release a new version with the same lib as
pgmanager to make it easier to merge.
Hum... preview through pgmanager... I didn't think about it. Sounds good.
I'm going to review the code and see what i can do to make it happen.
Best regards,
Mauricio

Hi,

Any QGIS plugin for GPX to PostGIS and GPX to Spatialite?

http://www.postneo.com/2007/01/20/from-gpx-to-postgis

What do you think of these i.e. GPX to PostGIS and GPX to Spatialite?

It is useful to have this?

Anybody planning to develop this plugin,

Hi,

Maybe it is better to make the plugin for write vector layers(any source) to
Database (Postgis or Spatialite).

I'm unable to reproduce it, both 'Custom database query' and 'RT Sql Layer'

seems to work with tables not in the public schema.
Maybe does your layer contain invalid geometries?

Cheers.

Hi Giuseppe ,

The author of provider told me about this problem, see ticket (
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3329).

The  geometries and SQL are  very simples.

My enviroment is:
1) Windows XP
2) OSGEO4W packages: QGIS 1.6 and Trunk
3) Postgres in Localhost
4) User for Postgres: postgres (administator).
5) SQL :
SELECT
  l.id AS gid, l.the_geom AS the_geom
FROM gis.tl_20101117_101056_limite l

Please inform about your enviroment.
It  can be util for understand what is happened.

Regards,
Luiz Motta

Hi Luiz,

Yes, I think your suggestion - plugin to write vector layers(any
source) to Database (Postgis or Spatialite) is the best approach.

Devs,

If I click on 'Help Contents' I get a web page telling me how to build
Qgis from source. Whose idea was that? Surely if you are clicking on
'Help' you've already got a copy of Qgis built. You're more likely to
want user-level help, not developer docs!

Probably better to give a link to the user manuals...

Qgis 1.6

I'm using gdal 1.6, so this might be an issue. You are right, with the sample image
it works (getting some NULLs in areas where in the original we have 0, though -
should try with gdal 1.7).
So it is an issue with loading into PostGIS rather than with your plugin.

Fantastic, thanks.

that would be great.
in the end, I think PG manager (or, better, DB manager) should be THE tool.

All the best.

What I mentioned on the wiki page is kind of a print service with QGIS 
mapserver, so no replacement for QuickPrint / EasyPrint.

In the print composer, there is the possibility to create default composer 
templates by moving the composer templates into 
pkgDataPath/composer_templates.

Maybe it would be good to put a nice default qgis template there. However, the 
user still needs to go to the composer manager, open the template and click 
the print button in the composer window. So QuickPrint / EasyPrint are still 
quicker (or easier) :-)

Regards,
Marco

What about one "decoration" layer with multiple text boxes, scale bar, and 
north arrow. Tim is working on such decorations, Tim, aren't you?

to Luiz: as Ricardo wrote, he is the author of the plugin
(CustomDatabaseQuery),
not the author of the provider at all.
BTW, I'm the author of both the patches for executing a custom query with
postgres and spatialite provider, so I'm one of the guys you're searching
for :)

to Ricardo: the ticket told about an "Error for postgres's provider", not
custom
database query plugin issue.
Furthermore, the QGis trac is not for plugins' issues, except for those that
are
in trunk. For this reason we're working to create a plugins trac.

If you're sure the issue is only related to your plugin source code and not
to the
qgis functions called in your code, you should close the ticket as invalid.

Doesn't anyone confirm that it's a provider's issue, not just a plugin
issue??
Please, could you try to execute the same query using the RT Sql Layer
plugin,
in order to confirm the provider issue?

Thanks a lot.
Cheers.

Hi Guiseppe, Luiz

I have to do some more checking to be sure, but I think this problem
is happening with both plugins. I haven't got a postgis database at
hand right now, but with my home testing set I was getting the same
error (something about cursor states lost) with both 'custom db query'
and 'rt sql layer' plugins.
I'll investigate later.

I didn't realize it might have something to do with the tables not
being in the 'public' schema until Luiz brought it up. All my testing
tables are indeed out of the 'public' schema.

If the problem is happening on both plugins, could this mean it is
something wrong with the underlying implementation?
I haven't copied code from the 'rt sql layer plugin', so it is likely
that the code is different. However, the QgsDataSourceURI.uri() must
be returning a similar value for it to work on both plugins...

Regarding the trac issues, sorry for the confusion. I am not very
knowledgeable about the main trac and the new plugins trac. Please
feel free to use the bug report in whatever way you see fit, be it
closing as invalid or whatever ;)

Hi Guiseppe,

Sorry for the mistake on the author of the provider.

I made both test, for both plugins, 'Custom database query' and 'Rt  Sql
Layer, and
with the same result.

When the table is inside public's schema don't have message of error,
otherwise,
i have the message of error, but the layer is created perfect.

I saved the project of QGIS (with the created layer) and open again this
project the message of error was showed.
In this point isolat the  factor of plugin, then, have some problem with
provider.

Regards,
Luiz Motta

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Documentation on how to make a C++ DLL interact
	with QGIS
Message-ID: <412970.8041.qm@web33705.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


Dear QGIS Developer Family:

I
 am looking for any documentation/instructions about how to make a C++ 
DLL interact with QGIS as a plugin. I would not mind using either 
completely in c++ through perhaps QT or with a Python front end inside 
QGIS. I have some experience making Python plugins, now I want to go the
 next step to have my external application interact with QGIS data 
directly.

I am also interested in compiling an app with my own 
QGIS GUI but that may require more work than I can do right now, and if I 
could pass data from Copiano or trunk QGIS to my application, I 
would be satisfied. 
?
Thank you for any help,

Maaza? ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem using vector data provider in python
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E06D1146A9A@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All

I'm wondering if it is possible to use a QgsVectorDataProvider independently from a map layer in Python.  For example, I'd like to open a GML file and read features, etc from it without creating a map layer.

I can get as far as 

p=QgsProviderRegistry.instance().getProvider("ogr","myfile.gml")

But what I get back is QgsDataProvider.

<qgis.core.QgsDataProvider object at 0x099BE6F0>

So all the QgsVectorDataProvider methods don't seem to be available.  For example

>>> p.extent()
<qgis.core.QgsRectangle object at 0x09A4D810>
>>> p.featureCount()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'QgsDataProvider' object has no attribute 'featureCount'

Is there any way to cast this to a QgsVectorDataProvider in Python (as happens in gsVectorLayer::setDataProvider)?  Or is there another better way to access the data provider?

Thanks
Chris

Hi Chris,
if You want to read GML in some script, You can use GDAL python bindings.
"from osgeo import ogr"

Hi Chris

there was a missing conversion routine that would tell python that a
subclass exists. I've added it to trunk in r14911, so now you should
get QgsVectorDataProvider instance.

While instantiating a vector data provider without its QgsVectorLayer
counterpart is possible, IMO it's more convenient to use the latter
(and there's barely any overhead).

Martin

Thanks Ivan

It looks like that could work, but I'm hoping to short circuit that a bit, as in the end what I want are QgsFeature objects.  

The data provider is getting exactly what I want, except that it is not exposing (to Python) the functions from QgsVectorDataProvider, only those from the base QgsDataProvider class. 

I guess if there is no better way I could use the ogr module, but I'll end up replicating in Python a bunch of code that is already written in the OGR data provider, which seems a bit wasteful :-)

Cheers
Chris

Good point .. There really isn't any reason not to create a QgsVectorLayer.  I was failing to distinguish between map layers that are displayed, and QgsVectorLayer, which isn't

Many thanks

Hi Maaza
- Show quoted text -
If I understand you correctly, you want to write a standalone app with
embedded QGIS functionality correct? In which case please see:

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/code_examples/1_hello_world_qgis_style

There are several more tutorials there, though some may need revision
to reflect the current state of QGIS in trunk.

If you want a more complex example - which creates a standalone app
which itself can display qgis plugins etc. then please look here
(undocument but working example current to QGIS trunk).

http://openmodeller.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openmodeller/branches/branch-openModellerDesktop-newQgis/

hope that helps!

Regards

Tim

Indeed I am so standbye on that one. First I want to get the new
plugin  / snippet / user map etc site running and then I will go back
to working on that. In my rework, all 'decoration plugins' will become
'widget plugins' that will be accessed from a widget bar and dropped
onto the map. They will work in the same way as Marco's annotations
where they can be place map relative or canvas relative (in fact they
will derive from the annotation code). Thats the plan anyway but I
dont have exact timings yet.

By the way - copyright plugin was also one of the first C++ plugins
ever written so it has some history in QGIS too :-P

@Paolo: indeed I was thinking to replace quick print with easy print
when I suggested removing it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster clipper: shifted results
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=+QRXjUS=MA14V-TEVnYstDjU80TpvLxQ4bQ6c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I think the way the area to be clipped is set in raster/clipper is wrong.
Currently, for results to be correct, the area to be clipped must be
coincident with pixel boundaries. In other
words, the 4 corners must be pixel corners.
If the corners of the defined area are within the pixel, the result is
shifted, as it is not interpolated.

I think that if no interpolation is the goal, then the coordinates
entered by the user should be moved to the closest
pixel corners, and the user be warned. Then the clipping would be exact.

If floating clipping is the goal, then the user must enter the
resolution of the new raster and interpolation must
be performed.

Obviously having the option would be the best, but as the second
option is more complicated, having the first one
implemented first would make a lot of sense.

I've put a zipped file with a qgis project and layers to illustrate
the problem here:

	trunk
Message-ID: <OFE33C1B94.4EFD7632-ON852577FA.006B5C2C-852577FA.0078EF5F@sybase.com>


Hello QGIS Devs,

As per discussion on qgis-psc a couple of weeks ago, I have just
contributed (rev. 14918) a native plugin+provider for Sybase SQL Anywhere
(trunk/qgis/src/plugins/sqlanywhere; trunk/qgis/src/providers/sqlanywhere),
similar in functionality to the PostGIS and SpatiaLite providers.  Due to a
legal technicality, this code needed to be released under GPL v3 rather
than the usual GPL v2 used by the rest of the QGIS project.

I've tested the code under both Ubuntu 10.04 (gcc) and Windows XP (MSVC
2008).  If there are developers out there on other platforms, could you
please let me know if the plugin fails to either compile or load on your
platform (loading it should add a toolbar button and a couple menu
options)?

If anyone is interested in taking the plugin/provider for a test drive,
here is a quick set of steps to get you started:

  1. Download the free Developer's Edition of SQL Anywhere 12.0.0 here:
http://www.sybase.com/detail?id=1016644

  2. Install the SQL Anywhere 12.0.0 engine on your database host

  3. Install the SQL Anywhere 12.0.0 client libraries on your QGIS client
(only necessary if client and host are different machines)

  4. Use 'dbinit my_database_name' to initialize a blank database on the
host.  The default user/password is initialized to 'dba'/'sql'.

  5. Use 'dbsrv12 my_database_name' to start the database server on the
host.

  6. Populate the database with sample spatial data.  To facilitate this
step, I have contributed the SQL script
src/providers/sqlanywhere/load_alaska_shapes.sql which loads the Alaska
VMap0 shapefiles into new tables.  Use the 'Interactive SQL' tool (dbisql)
on the database host to open/execute this script (you will need to modify a
few variables at the top of the script to tell it where to find the
shapefiles, which are assumed to be on the filesystem of the database
host).

  7. Start up QGIS, and load the SQL Anywhere plugin.  This will add a
button to the data sources toolbar, as well as the menu entries 'Plugins->
SQL Anywhere' and 'Layer->Add SQL Anywhere Layer...'

  8. Adding a SQL Anywhere layer should invoke a dialogue box for choosing
a connection and searching the database schema for geometry columns
(similar look/feel/functionality to the PostGIS and SpatiaLite toolbar
buttons).  If you instead receive a message box, it means that it can't
find the SQL Anywhere client libraries installed in step 3 (or step 2 if
client=host).

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments/suggestions/bugs...

Thanks,
Dave

have updated 'custom db query' to version 0.4.
The plugin's window is now modeless, and it stays on top of the QGIS
main window. So you can interact with the rest of QGIS while having
the plugin open. This way you can, for example remove your query
layers from the map.

Hi Ricardo,

I got the error from the new version 0.4 (below). Before I don't have
this error using the same database and query in 0.3

The SQL query seems to be invalid.

no such function: SRID

~~~~~~~


An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/noli/.qgis/python/plugins/customdbquery/CustomDBQueryDialog.py",
line 175, in parse_SQL_text
    self.execute_query(selectQuery)
  File "/home/noli/.qgis/python/plugins/customdbquery/CustomDBQueryDialog.py",
line 189, in execute_query
    self.add_geometry_column(connection, selectQuery) # add srid and geomType
  File "/home/noli/.qgis/python/plugins/customdbquery/CustomDBQueryDialog.py",
line 262, in add_geometry_column
    self.add_spatialite_geometry_column(connection, initialQuery)
  File "/home/noli/.qgis/python/plugins/customdbquery/CustomDBQueryDialog.py",
line 299, in add_spatialite_geometry_column
    srid = rowList[0][0]
IndexError: list index out of range

Another thing, when there is an error, the table is still created. Is
there simple way to delete the table in the database, not using SQL
statement / query?

Thanks.

Noli

Hi Noli

I can't seem to reproduce any of your errors with my sample data.
Can you give me some more information? What queries are you trying?
Is it possible for you to send me some testing data?

Hi Ricardo,

Spatialite database bug.

The bug is in checkbox (on./check) "save new layer to database".

When I unchecked (off), it works but the resulting map in TOC is "sql layer".



The postgis bug, I don't know the reason since it does not work as
well in the other postgis plugin (i.e PGManager).

Hi Ricardo,

In postgis error.

The plugin has the same problem when you checkbox is on for "save new
layer to database".

However, if I unchecked it this is the error.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unable to execute the query.
The error message from the database was:
ERROR:  column "A" does not exist
LINE 1: ...ect * from (Select * from stands where veg_type = "A") as "s...
                                                             ^
.
SQL: select * from (Select * from stands where veg_type = "A") as
"subQuery_0" limit 1

Hi Ricardo,

To replicate my error in Spatialite database.

Please download the test-2.3.zip from
http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-2.3.0/resources.html

Do the following query on the Regions table:

Select * from Regions where NAME = "VENETO"

You will see the errors.

Have a look at as well the "sql layer" attribute table.

Using Ubuntu 10.04, GGIS 1.7 trunk r14914M.

Thanks.

Noli
Thanks.

Noli

Hi Noli,
this one it's no a plugin error, it's a query syntax error.

You still use double quotes wrapping values, instead you must use single
quotes.
Double quotes are for identifiers like table name, schema name and column
name.

Cheers.

Hi Guiseppe,

Thanks.

In PostgIs, this query below works now.

SELECT * FROM "public"."stands" AS "t_0" WHERE "t_0"."veg_type" = 'A'

Now, my problem is I don't know what is the "Schema".

What should I place in the Schema textbox? Where can I figure out the Schema?

I input public in Schema and I got this error.

~~~~~~~~
Unable to access the "public"."TableA" relation.
The error message from the database was:
ERROR:  relation "public.TableA" does not exist
LINE 1: select * from "public"."TableA" limit 1
                      ^
.

This is spatialite, not PostGIS, hence, pg_manager does not apply :-)

Hi Noli, Guiseppe, all

I downloaded the spatialite sample database and ran your query.
I could run it fine without the errors you mention. The problem here
seems to be that I still need to write some documentation on how to
use the plugin so that you (the user) can know how to operate it
correctly ;)

I will improve the Help page of the plugin in order to clarify these issues.

As for your specific problem:

the SQL query you are using is:

Select * from Regions where NAME = 'VENETO'

- If you only intend to visualize the results in the 'result' tab of
the plugin, without loading to map canvas, it works fine just like
this.

- BUT, If you want to load the result of the query to the map canvas,
you must ensure that the 'Geometry column' and 'Identifier column'
text boxes are showing the correct values for your specific tables.
Using a spatialite db, I've set the default values for these text
boxes as 'geometry' and 'pkuid', but you need to confirm if your data
are using these names as well. In this case, the correct values should
be 'Geometry' and 'PK_UID'.
You can check the names of the columns in an sqlite table by using the
spatialite manager, or by running the following query:

PRAGMA TABLE_INFO(table_name)

If you use the wrong geometry and identifier values you may (or may
not) still be able to visualize your data over the map canvas but the
attribute values will come as ERROR.


As for the deletion of tables from the spatialite db, there isn't a
nice way of doing this. To the best of my knowledge you still have to
manually create the SQL DROP TABLE... statement and also remove the
triggers and geometry info from spatialite by running the SQL SELECT
DiscardGeometryColumn...
I think this feature will come around sooner or later. It belongs to
the (spatialite)manager plugin, and, even if I miss it as well, I
don't think it should be implemented in the custom db query plugin.

Cheers

Noli

Concerning your problem with postgis, I cannot reproduce it here.
Maybe I am not clear on what you are trying to do.
If you want to create a new table in the public schema as the result
of your SQL query, you must:

- activate the 'load result in map canvas' checkbox
- input valid column names for the 'geometry column' and 'identifier
column' text boxes
- activate the 'save new layer to database' checkbox
- input a valid 'Table name' and 'Schema' in their respective text
boxes. if you want to save the table in the public schema, type
'public' (without the quotes)
- write a valid SQL query (maybe it is best to first test the query
without visualizing to the map canvas to make sure it works)

Best regards

Hi Ricardo,

Thanks for explaining these things.

The default of Spatialite uses "Geometry" and "PK_UID" as you can see
test-2.3.sqlite. All spatialite databases immigrated using the
utilities of spatialite have "Geometry" and "PK_UID" as default. You
can also see it in the Spatialite Tutorials.

http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/spatialite-tutorial-2.3.1.html#t1

As suggestion, if you don't mind, probably you can change the default
to "Geometry" and "PK_UID" to avoid confusion especially for the new
users. However, you also put a checkbox option if you like.

I think it would be nice to some documentation in plugin.

e.g. PRAGMA TABLE_INFO(table_name) to view table before you start
using the plugin. The probably a link to this Spatialite Tutorials
(i.e. http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/spatialite-tutorial-2.3.1.html#t1
).

Thanks.

Noli

I agree with everything :)
It will eventually get done.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OpenLayers plugin and Print Composer
Message-ID: <4D0A8E1B.9050404@campusactivism.org>

I'm trying to print a layer of points (kml) on an Open Street Map.  I'm 
hoping to get the highest resolution possible - so I can print them out 
at 600 dpi. I think I can do this by creating an image that is around 
4800 by 6000 pixels.

QGIS 1.6

I use the OpenLayers plugin to get the OpenStreetMap layer.

I add the kml data.  I zoom in a couple times (to the state of 
Pennsylvania).

It looks fine in QGis.  Now when I try to print it using "Print 
Composer", I select "add a map" and create a box for the map.  The map 
shows up fine.  But when I try to export it to an image (or pdf) it 
shows my kml markers on a *completely different* open street map 
background.  It looks like it zoomed in 3-5 times on openstreet (and 
changed the center point), but the kml layer keeps its original projection.

Is there any way I could get around this bug?

It looks like there is an OpenLayers bug.  Is someone working on it?


Another person had the same problem:
http://forum.qgis.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=7674&p=16449#p16449

There is a ticket, but it looks like nobody is working on it:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3195

Hi Ricardo.

I still have problem with the "save new layer to database".

"The SQL query seems to be invalid.

no such function: SRID"

The error is still:


"/home/noli/.qgis/python/plugins/customdbquery/CustomDBQueryDialog.py",
line 299, in add_spatialite_geometry_column
    srid = rowList[0][0]
IndexError: list index out of range

It's a bug of the OpenLayers plugin. We still didn't manage to correctly set 
the DPI params in all places.
Maybe Mathias has a Christmas enlightment or gets help from someone else 
looking at it?

This is a good case for the planned plugin bug tracker!

Hi,

It seems that Built-in functions in Spatialite is not working in
Spatialite Manager and Custom Query plugin.

This query (below) is working in spatialite. However not in Spatialite
Manager and Custom query plugin. See the results in spatialite
terminal result.

Select PK_UID, Area(Geometry) as Area, Glength(Geometry) as Perimeter
from Regions where Name = 'VENETO';

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Hackfest spring 2011: proposed location and date
Message-ID: <1292585994.1877.51.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

a few weeks ago, just before/during the last hackfest in Wroclaw, I
proposed (in the qgis community mailing list[0] and during irc chats in
the #qgis channel) to hold the next developer meeting in Portugal. 

A few of you devs already answered in positive way, but I would like now
to make here the "official" proposal and eventually start putting
together the event.

The proposed location would be Lisbon, that has an international airport
served also by low cost companies, and the proposed dates are between
the 7/8 to the 11th of April.

The idea would be also to organize a QGIS user meeting the day before
the HF begins, so the eventually already arrived developers would be
able to promote QGIS among the users: we plan also to invite public
administrations and companies we know have an interest in QGIS.

At that time the weather in south Portugal is usually already with
temperatures above the 20 degrees and the prices still quite popular
even considering is a capital: 40/50 euros for a double room, as low as
8/10 euros for a complete meal, 0,55 euros for a espresso, 1 euro for a
beer...

So... now it is up to you. Let us know what do you think.

Cheers

Hi Noli

I can run your query in both plugins without any problem.
Maybe the real problem lies elsewhere.

I have been using using ubuntu almost exclusively lately, with
packages from the ubuntugis repository. So I really haven't had a
chance to test these things out on diferent OS/software versions. I
was expecting everything to work OK though.

What are your system specs?
Do you have the pyspatialite python module installed?

Can anyone else reproduce Noli's error?

Hi Ricardo,

I am using Ubuntu 10.04 but I updated my Qgis lately to the trunk
version r14914m in the nightly built since I was not getting the
Database Menu.

In this repo

deb     http://qgis.org/debian-nightly lucid main
deb-src http://qgis.org/debian-nightly lucid main

What is the version of your ubuntu QGIS and what is the repository?

Thanks.

Noli

is mandatory to end the HF on sundays (as it has been until now)?
otherwise it can be from April 9th to 12/13th... starts on Saturday and
ends in the middle of the week.

Too close to to FOSSGIS 2011?


cheers

Hi all.
So http://plugins.qgis.org/ is online. What are the plans to make it working, adding
authentication etc.?
We are available for testing, adding our plugins etc.
All the best.

Just to send a signal of life - I'm extremely busy closing a few 2010 
deadlines and have completely no free brain resources to participate in this 
great stage of plugin system refactoring :((

I'll do my best to come back to QGIS life at January 1st!

Hi all.
I have found during a course that on some machines qgis refused to start after
installation, displaying a message:

"Applicazione non correttamente inizializzata (0xc0150002)"
Fare clic su ok per chiudere l'applicazione.

(Application not correctly initialized (0xc0150002)
Click on OK to close the application.)

This is not related tio the qgis version I try to install (same message for 1.3, 1.4,
1.5 and 1.6, both standalone and osgeo4w).
Any hint about further testing or possible solutions?
Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Memory provider saver and signals
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E06D11B186C@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All

I'm trying to find some good signals for identifying changes to data in a memory layer.

I've got a functional memory provider plugin, at the moment saving each memory layer to a GML file.  However I'm not sure I've got the best approach to identifying when data changes are made to memory layers so that I can identify when the layers need to be updated.

The best I've got so far is 
            QObject.connect(layer, SIGNAL("committedAttributesDeleted(const QString &, const QgsAttributeIds )"),self.setProjectDirty2)
            QObject.connect(layer, SIGNAL("committedAttributesAdded(const QString &, const QList<QgsField> &)"),self.setProjectDirty2)
            QObject.connect(layer, SIGNAL("committedFeaturesDeleted(const QString &, const QgsFeatureIds & )"),self.setProjectDirty2)
            QObject.connect(layer, SIGNAL("committedFeaturesAdded(const QString &, const QgsFeatureIds &)"),self.setProjectDirty2)
            QObject.connect(layer, SIGNAL("committedAttributeValuesChanges(const QString &, const QgsChangedAttributesMap &)"),self.setProjectDirty2)

This works (at least for user changes - it won't identify changes made by other plugins, for example).  But it does seem a bit cumbersome.  

I'd hoped find something directly from the provider, since this would also identify programmatic data changes.  I thought I was onto something when I saw  

            QgsDataProvider.dataChanged()

>From its name this seemed perfect, but the documentation states it is for a different purpose - asynchronous tasks registering completion of data changes :-(  And looking through the memory provider code, I can't see any signals being emitted.

I'd also thought that using QgsVectorLayer.layerModified(bool) might have been a bit more succinct.  But that gets triggered more often than I want.  

Is there any obvious signal I'm missing?

Thanks
Chris

Message-ID: <AANLkTimNHUAnY9rrPbwCkPzy0Yrs6rbvy8jZN9DcMaLb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In recent trunk versions basic editing of gpx layers is possible. You
can draw new tracks and delete whole lines, but cannot move or delete
vertices. I would love to see the node tools made available to gpx
layers and if this enabled me to join and split tracks I could use
QGIS entirely and stop jumping into QLandKarte for these tasks. Is
there a dev interested in working on this for a small Christmas
donation?

There is an open ticket: http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2219

Craig

Ah, now that I read again, it IS a gdal version issue. The "Does not exist
in filesystem" message means it's not recognizing the postgis driver.
To tell it without mistakes, could you check "gdal-info --formats" and check
if there is a postgis raster driver there?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Is it possible to re-use print composer code to
	build a web service ?
Message-ID: <AANLkTinVxohyDGNnjtK=T3FwXQv3rFYRTZB+QyZWK8hK@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've spent a few hours exploring the codebase while I was thinking about
building a web service to generate (vectorial) PDF for a map.

IMHO this would be a must, expecially now that QGIS has entered in the web
service arena with qgis-mapserver.

The idea is to build a qgis-mapserver companion which would take care of
building a PDF representation of the map using the configured project(s) and
a print template.

The idea is that the user can configure the WMS and print template from QGIS
GUI, and have a  WMS + PDF-print service running with a few clicks.

The obvious road for such a service is qgis-mapserver (read layers, map
extent etc. from request like WMS does), + qgis-print-composer (read the
template name, the resolutions and paper format from request) but it seems
like the print-composer cannot work without a GUI, is this correct ?

Of course with a lot of efforts, this program could be built with
python-qgis bindings, but why can't we re-use the existing code? Most of the
functionality is already available in mapserver and printcomposer.

I would really like to hear your opinion on this topic

Marco has refactored the composer code few releases ago, so now it's
possible to use the print composer by calling only qgis_core code.
There is also a simple example how to use the composer:

http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/composer.html#output-using-map-composer

The code saves only a raster image, though saving a PDF should require
only minor modifications of that code. If you will have any problems
adapting it, I'll try to provide also PDF example.

Thanks Martin,

I have already found your example, but it is for a plugin, isn't it ?

I remember I tried to make it work from outside qgis (standalone) without
success.

What I would like to achieve is a CGI-style application which takes WMS-like
parameters (like qgis-mapserver does) and a printcomposer template to
generate a (vectorial) PDF.

Correct, PostGIS raster is not there.
However, a crash should be avoided, but this is a common problem with 
gdal errors.

Yes that code should work from python console in qgis or within a
plugin. You can also make it working from outside of qgis application
as a command line tool, you will just have to do some bootstrapping:
initialize qgis libraries (QgsApplication: setPrefixPath, initQgis),
load some layers, construct and set up a map renderer
(QgsMapRenderer). The example code omits that for simplicity and uses
map renderer from canvas.

This is indeed possible - one just has to initialize all the machinery
as briefly described above.

I've also tried that way...

I've got no more than segfaults:

It seems that the segfault happens in the python finalization code.
Such crashes happen if the qt objects are deleted in wrong order.
Presumably the QApplication object has been deleted earlier than the
composition. That could be solved by various ways, for example,
delete the composition at the end or set QApplication to be parent of
the composition.

Since the code crashes in the finalization stage, you should get the
output png file anyway. Can you please check?

Yes, the out.png is there but it contains a blank (white) image.

adding
c.setParent(app)

did not help, nor did
del c

gdb bt is similar: still crashes in the destructor of QGraphicsScene.

Looking at the code, I see that you create an instance of
QgsMapRenderer, but do not initialize. You should call its
setLayerSet() and setExtent() methods so that it knows what to render.

Yes you're right, I did too much cut-n-paste, just added:

lst = [ vlayer.getLayerID() ]
mapRenderer.setLayerSet(lst)
rect = core.QgsRectangle(mapRenderer.fullExtent())
rect.scale(0.8)
mapRenderer.setExtent(rect)


and now the image shows the map correctly.... but it still segfaults.

Dou you think is it also possible (always from a standalone script) to load
a map composer template and a qgis project from their XML files?

Hi Giovanni

> Too close to to FOSSGIS 2011?

Many of the Austrian / German / Swiss community members attend FOSSGIS, and 
some of them might have problems to attend the hackfest if it is too close to 
the conference.

If there are alternative dates, could you make a doodle 
(http://www.doodle.com) to check what dates would be suitable? Though the date 
that fits for everyone probably does not exist.

Regards,
Marco

doodle is fine for us!
I would like to propose one alternative to the already proposed dates:
15/16-19 of April (wed/thu-sun). This way the start of the HF should be
far enough from FOSSGIS and the HF still ends on a sunday.


cheers

Hi Allesandro,

In fact, Marco is currently working on exactly what you want. He is 
extending QGIS mapserver with a GetPrint command that allows to specify 
the map extent, the layout/template to use, rotation parameter, dpi, 
etc. and you'll get a PDF/SVG/PNG/JPEG as output. The templates will be 
picked up from the QGIS project file.

If you can wait until next year (probably mid to end of January) it will 
be part of QGIS mapserver.

So no need to work on it in parallel - unless you have something else in 
mind.

Hmm, weird. When I add "del c" at the end of the script, it works
fine. Another solution you might try is to do this:

----------
def init():
  # init QApplication and QgsApplication
  return app

def do_stuff():
  # do rendering/printing here

app = init()
do_stuff()
----------

Like this, the composer related stuff will be initialized and
finalized properly within do_stuff() method and then the application
instance will be destroyed. Just remember that it's necessary to keep
the reference to application instance - if it gets out of scope it
will be destroyed and any rendering will end up with a complete
failure.

>From a brief look into the code (src/app/composer/qgscomposer.cpp -
QgsComposer::readXML) the loading code is bound to GUI, so it's not
possible to load them using a single api call. But if you look into
the code, you'll see that it basically just creates the composer items
and sets their properties using readXML method of each item. It should
be possible to mimic this with a dozen (or two) of lines in python.

Btw. I have updated the composer section in the cookbook - including a
sample code for pdf export. The changes will be visible tomorrow. In
the meanwhile you can use the plain source:
http://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/docs/trunk/english_us/developer_cookbook/source/composer.rst

In the year 2011, 15/16 of April it's Fri/Sat and 19 of April it's Tue.
But it seems both April of the year 2009 and 2015 matches your proposed
date,
and coincidentally December 2010 i.e. the current month too ;)

Hi Borys,
I'm the developer of the Plugins starter Plugin, I just had a look at my 
source, and there is no mismatch, init.py returns 0.3.2 and so I tagged 
the plugin, the problem was that when I uploaded the zip file, the old 
one (with the same name) was not overwritten. I just tested again and it 
happened again. now I added an underscore to the zip file name and 
everything is fixed, can somebody confirm this behaviour? is it maybe a bug?

ciao

It's unfortunate I can't see the statistics:
http://qgis.org/en/component/apoll/apoll/1-kcube.html

The application [1] is an SWF of latest-and-closest version  :(

Great!

This is exactly what I had in mind, so I will wait for your solution.

Did you foresee the possibility to insert kvp substitution parameters for
text strings in print templates ?

Something that allows sending substitution strings in the request, for
example the name of the customer or similar short text snippets.

example:

[ Printed by: {username}]



Thanks a lot for this developments!

Hi all.

I'm sorry, I have the flu and yesterday I was probably confused.

The right proposed dates are 

13/14-17 of April (wed/thu-sun).

I'll setup a doodle event asap.

sorry again.

Yes, the possibility to replace label text (as well as extent, rotation, 
layers for composer maps) is planned.

I was thinking of working on something like this tonight.  Coincidence?  I
think not.. :) Well considering my C++ skills are pretty weak, I think I
will leave it up to someone with more knowledge in the area.

Hi Paolo

yes testing of the new plugins repository would be very welcome. I see
there is a deployment problem now (django template error pops up),
hopefully Tim will have some time to fix it.

Message-ID: <AANLkTim_5XAA7M=f8-Ci3GikTT9=cR1DYoE_v4--Y+=T@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,
I'm using Qgis 1.6 under mac os x 10.5 on many Mac (iMac or PowerBook) and I
found these same issues:

map composer:
1 - under map composer it's impossible to set the font size
2 - If we use the new symbology system with offset, under the legend, labels
and symbols  are overlayed

digitizing:
1 - when we modify poligons or we add some nodes and we don't save the
editing, after some passages I recive the message: Bad__alloc and qgis goes
in stop and I cannot do nothing, even to quit.


Best regards
Luca

for the authentification is possible use the the osgeo id and
password? in grass addons we use it and it's very useful

When You configure correctly Google Mercator for You project and enable 
'on the fly reprojection', You must configure correct projection for 
Your vector data. After this is done, everything will be correctly aligned.

I think, You have incorrect projection for Your data.

Hi

I am just getting the ldap authentication stuff working and then
people can start to play with the new site. There are still a lot of
things under construction (speaking for features beyond the plugins
repository) so bear with us.

Ok I came right by doing 'start and connect', and then leaving the

Hi Dave

Just getting around to test driving the new provider.

What is the correct value for 'servername' in the dbisql gui (assuming
having followed your instructions below and that the database I
created is called 'gis').

Thanks

Tim

Hi (taking this back on list as others will benifit from your
responses if they read the archives)

Thanks - yes I discovered the context help when setting up the QGIS
SQL Anywhere provider connection. I am up and running now thanks. As
initial feedback (after playing with it for 10 mins) is that it seems
to run without problems and do what it says on the box. The only
hiccup I have encountered so far is that the sql loader script for
Alaska data does not seem to run cleanly. I removed some of the shp
layer names from the initial list as I only have alaska, lakes and
majrivers here on my local setup. When the script ran, it dropped the
tables based on layer names ok but trying to load the shapefiles it
would report something like:

Failed to load  '/home/timlinux/gisdata/Alaska/.shp'

i.e. it was not properly concatenating in the layernams for the shp
loader part of the script.

Since I was eager just to see a pretty picture, I shamelessly cheated
to get the alaska boundary and then a local EPSG:4326 based dataset to
load by simply calling:

CALL load_shapefile( '/home/timlinux/gisdata/Alaska/alaska.shp',
1000002964, 'QGIS_alaska' );
CALL load_shapefile(
'/home/timlinux/gisdata/Africa/Jozi/2628-Vector-WGS84/2628_ROAD_LINE_2006_12.shp',
1000004326, 'QGIS_jozi_roads' );

It would be interesting to run some benchmarks comparing SQL Anywhere
with SpatialLite and PostgreSQL/PostGIS. If I have some time I will do
some simple tests of that nature.

Thanks for the contribution! No doubt you will start getting a trickle
of queries as more people start to explore the new goodies :-)

Regards

Tim

Hi Again

One more thing I wanted to add - it would be great to have an easier
way to load shp or other format data into the database. Most folks
will be used to loading data with SPOT/shp2pgsql/ogr2ogr or similar
high level tools. While your provided script is not hard to use, it
will lower the entry bar that much more to provide a similar mechanism
for SQL Anywhere.

Best regards

Tim

Hmm, that's somewhat puzzling.  I tested the script under both Windows and
Linux.  The script rather crudely assumes that the list of names built at
the top is of the form "A,B,...,Z".  Is it possible that during your
modification to restrict to alaska, lakes, and majrivers you inadvertently
introduced an extra comma into the string value (likely at the front)?

I'd be interested in your results.  I will take this opportunity to note,
however, that SA 12.0.0 was the first release of our spatial support.  SA
12.0.1 will be released in early 2011, and it will contain substantial
performance improvements for spatial (particularly for
loading/querying/manipulating large geometry values).  Waiting a few months
for 12.0.1 before running benchmark comparisons would be great :).

I hope so!  At least, I hope some people try it out.  Ideally, everything
would be so straightforward and work so smoothly that very few questions
arise :-).

I believe that you are correct - I reverted my changes to the script
so I can't verify it now but I believe I did leave in a leading comma.

Hi All

I've raised a Trac ticket, 3366, for this.  Wondering if anyone has any insights into what could be causing this, or how to debug it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] symbol levels with rule based rendering
Message-ID: <1293067910.27364.14.camel@mk-desktop-smh>

Dear list members,
I would highly value some advice with some coding problem I facewith
rule-based rendering.

I am preparing a patch and I have made extensive additions to many parts
of the code to support some useful features to render map with complex
symbology grammar (see http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222 for a
discussion). Still, I have problems with the symbol levels. I would like
to enable symbol levels when several rules are matched. It would be
useful when a feature (specially highways) should be represented with a
combination of symbols. For instance, a road can be on a bridge, under a
tunnel [with transparent tunnel symbol], in construction, bordered with
trees, have restricted access, be a one-way road, etc. In many cases, it
is possible to simply combine the symbols, e.g. one symbol for the road
itself and another one for the bridge "around" it, and an arrow for
one-ways. It would be possible to use only one rule for all highways
(except motorways if shown with wider symbol). If we have 30 types of
ways and 5 types of additional symbols (bridge, etc), we could then show
many tags combinations with only 30+5=35 rules instead of 30*5=150.
(Imagine if you add 10 scale-based rules: you got 1500 combinations!!).

For the implementation, I modified the symbolForFeature function in
src/core/symbology-ng/qgsrulebasedrendererv2.cpp


Here is what I'm trying to do: For the first matched rule for a given
feature, the code makes a copy of the rule's symbol. If other rules are
matched, it merges the layers of the additional matched rule with the
symbol(s) of previously matched rule(s). It also merges the information
on symbol levels.

Tests on rendering on small areas (with features matched by 2 rules)
works partially:

    * the symbols are correctly merged. A new symbol is created and
displayed, based on the symbology and levels of the matching rules 8-)
    * However, it modifies the symbol associated with the first matched
rule and shown in the style sheet (if you open the layer properties, you
see that the symbol has been permanently modified): the 1st matched rule
is now represented by a combination of the 2 original symbols. This
change is saved permanently in the Layer Properties. Similarly for
symbol levels. 8-(
    * it crashes very often 8-( 

I've pasted my draft code here:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222#comment:7


I'm sure there are several incorrect thinks here. Anyone could help?
Thanks and Merry Christmas!

Hi,

"we will try to find something more open friendly for the future - though
I dont know if such a thing exists."

Yes it does! The R language/statistical software has advanced statistical graphics capacity, cf. e.g.:

http://addictedtor.free.fr/graphiques/thumbs.php?sort=votes

Here, instead of a pie chart, I would suggest:
1) a bar plot in alphabetical order of categories, and
2) a Pareto plot (bar plot in decreasing order of vote)

I would save them in a single png file that would be displayed on the web page.
Optionally, to get interactive capacity, I would use the sendplot R package:
It allows to get nice customized call tips without using any browser addon (only html and standard ecmascript).

To implement this, the easiest I can thing of is (but there are other solutions):

Each time there is a new vote:
1- the page managing the vote adds the result of the vote to a plain text file
2- launch an R script (by a system/bash call)
The R script will do the following:
3- Read the results of the vote from the plain text file
4- Generates the plot(s), saving it in a png file in a folder of the web server
5- optionally adding interaction (saving relevant javascript file)

The steps 1 and 2 can be replaced by a direct call to R (there are R bindings from many web scripting languages).

I volunteer to do steps 3 to 5 if you are interested.
This requires to have R installed on the web server (it is packaged for most linux distribs).
Regards,
Mayeul

 Using R would be massive overkill! Open-source javascript packages
exist for charting, Tim has just blogged about this so I assume he's
working on it.

 I've used 'flot' in the past and am being impressed by 'protovis'.

Hi!

I have a problem with a kmz [1] (unzipped to kml [2]) file that once
imported to QGIS
has a table plenty of control characters etc [3]. I would appreciate
if someone knowing the
format could give a look to the kml file and tell me if the file is defective or
we have a problem at importing some of them to QGIS, perhaps there are
different versions of kml.

The files are

Any way I can reformat the file? This file has been given to me, no way I
can modify the options of the gps now.
Or perhaps there is a way to tell gdal-OGR the file has html format
and then write a shapefile?

Using Linux grep, you can remove the problematic tags, for instance to remove all lines with "<TR", do:

grep -v "<TR" fluxpyr_221010_1.kml > fluxpyr_221010_modif.kml

This deletes about two thirds of the lines!

You can use sed to have more control.
If you want a graphical interface/an easier Windows solution, you can use find and replace in OpenOffice.org writer.
(for finer control, use this OOo extension: 
http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/AltSearch)
Hope this helps

jsxgraph is also very nice:

http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/

Protovis is also very nice (as Barry said):
http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/
examples: http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ex/

I believe that Protovis is based on SVG only, so it may not run in older
IEs. IE9 should work fine though. JSXGraph renders to either SVG or VML
(for older IEs).

Actually I meant this in the context that we were trying to set up a
poll quickly under joomla (the CMS we use for QGIS.org). We didnt want
to spend (or have) hours to implement our own poll app - we just
wanted to take an off the shelf module and run with it.

In future we may adopt some of the ideas listed (I really like the
look of protovis that Barry mentioned) and incorporate them into the
django app suite we are building for QGIS.org.

Regards

Tim

Hi all.
I just installed QGIS and CAD Tools on a new machine. As it has been note earlier,
icons do not appera on the toolbar, even after restarting QGIS.
Anything I can do to help solve this annoying bug?
All the best.

Hi

it never happens to me (Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10). I looked into it the
last time but didn't found anything. I hope someone else has an idea.

I'm very curious to try out your patch. If I can summarise what you
are trying to do in a nutshell, its to make a rule based renderer
where each rule that is matched ads one or more symbol layers to the
item symbol and adds an accompanying layer level entry. More or less
correct?

Martin Dobias (who is I think enjoying some time away from the
computer over xmas) will be the best one to help you with your
questions, but I can say that if my description above is correct, it
will be most welcom as it will allow us to create  very nice
cartography at the end of the day.

I would suggest comparing the code that references the icon to another
plugin that does work to see the difference. It could be a non cross
platform method for calling the icon, some funny path issue, or even the
use/disuse of a qt resource file.

Thanks,
Alex

The win7 I'm using is the 64bit version . Is a really 64bit version.
But qgis-dev is the 32 bit version (from osgeo4 installer)

Hi Tim,
Thanks for your question.
I believe this was already the aim the the rule based renderer which was
created some time ago.
I have worked with it to try and mimic what mapnik and osmarender are
doing with openstreetmap data. As a matter of fact, OSM data is so rich
that you can do very different maps for very different types of users;
in addition, I cannot think of a richer public dataset, so it is a got
dataset to make tests and experiments. Working with data with national
datasets (currently Italy.osm planet extract) I came up with a few ideas
to improve the current renderer; this would in effect allow every one to
have his/her *own* ideal map, easily. I believe this really shows the
power of freedom that free software and free data can bring.
Thanks again for your comments.
Merry christmas!
Regards,
Mayeul

2- Refresh on startup
But I don't know what you meant with the last mail. You mean by clicking the

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python plugins style guide
Message-ID: <AANLkTi==4R=waWRwrkyk_VuD9pO8LM8KXEgccJ8+E+fB@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

I have been working with Luiz Motta in the 'Custom db query' plugin
and we came about the dilemma of how to best format our Python code.

Looking around the QGIS wiki, we found the developers manual [1] and
read through the coding guidelines, but the rules defined in it are
for C++ programming and for QGIS core. We couldn't find anything
related to Python and plugins.

Has this been debated in the past? Is there a recommended style for
formatting Python code in QGIS plugins?
I usually follow the recommendation in the PEP8 [2], the official
style guide for Python. But Luiz argues (a valid point I guess) that
if we were to follow the C++ standard it would be more consistent with
the rest of the code.

I guess we are in a state where I have my opinion, he has his own, and
we'd like to reach a consensus by surveying your thoughts on this
subject. Also it seems like a good idea to raise this issue now, with
the upcoming possibility of having multiple people collaborating on
plugins.

Thanks

My recommendation is:

1. Be consistent using whatever style.
2. I would prefer Python style (PEP), since Python is read by Python
programmers and has it's own block style.

Yours, S.

I'm having a little problem with checking gdal version qgis was compiled
against. Does anyone know how can I do it through qgis api (if it's
possible)?
Beste regards,

The choice about your style depend how you use the tecnology.

At moment, i am migrating for consume of Qt Framework, then, i prefer use
the classes of Qt than Python with the same funcionality, of course, the
code style is closer of QGIS developers.

It is good we has one guide, or one manual of good practices , to plugin in
Python,  facilitating the construction of several persons plugin.

My opinion is use the PyQt4 style, it is more close of QGIS developers.
It is more easy migrate to C++  candidate's  plugins to core

Luiz

Hi,
I have created a new set of icons based on SJJB Icons (those are
"official" icons for Openstreetmap).
There are important additions to 
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/14131
 namely:
- I added the new icons created recently by SJJB
- I created coloured icons instead of black icons
(those are similar to http://www.sjjb.co.uk/mapicons/contactsheet
except you will not find svg coloured icons nor the tools to create them
on sjjb website)
- I created icons without background (negative of above icons) which
take much less room on the map
- I fixed some icons that had a white drawing outside of the svg
document border (this does not show up when you work with a white
background screen in inkscape or when rasterizing the icons as SJJB
does, but it showed up on qgis screen)
- I created several new original icons from scratch that I want to
release under the GPL or under the same licence as SJJB (will be simpler
for SJJB to integrate them)
- I fixed some typos filenames

Those are the icons I used for my work here:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222

I cannot attach them on the trac website because the tar.gz file is > 1
MB. How can I share them?
In addition, I created a set of script to generate the coloured icons
based on the raw svg files. I do not know where this should go in the
qgis tree.
Regards,
Mayeul

I don't really know.
I don't think the plugin does not set this kind of thing. So somewhere it's
being read that these are nulls. I don't know if it's a gdal driver issue or
a postgis traster issue.
I'm going to investigate a little further.

Hi,
I am new to developing Quantum GIS plugins. So sorry if its very basic. I
have created a simple plugin from the tools generated on line using this
http://pyqgis.org/builder/plugin_builder.py. On downloading the zip file and
extracting it, I notice that from the finder on Mac OS X , i cannot find the
.qgis folder into where i am to copy the unzipped plugin. But on accessing
the terminal, and navigating to the .qgis/python/plugins folder, i am able
to copy it there,through the terminal that is. Despite copying it there, it
still does not appear under the plugins manager. Please help. One is it
possible to paste the plugin without using the terminal? and if so what
should i do to have the plugin appear on the plugin manager? Please help

Jude,

After copying your plugin in the .qgis folder as you have done you  
need to restart qgis if it was active at the time. Then you need to  
enable your plugin inside qgis: plugins menu, manage plugin, then  
check the box associated with your plugin, close dialog and your  
plugin should be listed in the plugins menu.

HTH,
Benoit

Hi all.
While loading PostGIS rasters, I noticed that 0s are automatically set
to NULLs in the raster properties.
Anybody knows at what level are they set, so we can change it
programmatically?

Hi all,
I have written up a short guide to contributing to QGIS using git and

your bug fixes and enhancements to the project without having to obtain 
write permissions to the centralized SVN repository.

Hi,

Have seen this blog by PerryGeo?

http://www.perrygeo.net/wordpress/?p=151

Please note about the Author note (below) - RJ Zimmer at American
Surveyor magazine in ?Something for Nothing?

All the QGIS features are in question mark (?).

"Author?s Note: The Quantum GIS information listed on the comparison
matrix is based on the help files and literature provided by the
Quantum GIS developer group, none of which I tested".

RJ Zimmer at American Surveyor magazine is dummkopf.

I think we need to correct this comparison chart. We can probably
develop our own Qgis features chart without the comparison and include
it in the Qgis brochure.

Probably someone should write the Editor of the magazine to correct
this baseless review of the QGIS.

Tim, probably you can write a blog on this to correct this thing.

This is a good idea. We should create a features chart listing all those 
in the article and many of our own. This would give a good at-a-glance 
view of what QGIS can provide.

A number of people wrote to the editor---I don't think any further

Hi!

I changed the "detailed view" to a more open view ..
There is no eye-candy flash any more but at least it should be read and
viewable by everyone now.
And for the next poll i found a module where there are not only
radiobuttons but also checkboxes to select more than one item ..

kind regards and happy new year

Hi Ricardo

I would recommend to use the Python style guide for plugins code.
After all, our c++ style cannot be applied in many cases, for example,
where to put opening and closing braces or naming of member variables
(mFoo in c++, naturally self.foo in python).

Also PyQt4 authors tend to "pythonize" the api, AFAIK pyqt for python3
will automatically convert QString to python (unicode) strings etc. Of
course there is a doubt whether to use Qt or python library for some
functionality found in both. This is just a matter of taste and
personally I would choose python library because typically it's less
verbose and more elegant.

Regards
Martin

Hi,
I am building a plugin that takes in details that should be secure. I have
been able to create the settings dialogue. Not sure how about to save the
settings people key in. Should settings be stored in a .ini file or using
Qsettings that have seen but no examples. anyone with a qsettings example
that i could have a look and which is better of the two, the .ini file
approach or Qsettings.

Thanks .

Uhm... sounds scary.
As I've been doing git-svn for postgis [1] and geos [2] too I wonder
how do you plan to import changes people submit to other git repo.
Wouldn't all those commits need to be re-written for submission to
SVN ?

I mean, in case you'll ever use submitted changes, the public repositories
used for requesting the pull _from_ would need to be rewritten to be
in sync with git-svn, resulting in a mess. Or am I missing something ?
(I'd love to be missing something )

Attaching a format-patch in trac, I'd think :)

It depends on what you want to do. For a one-off patch there is no 
reason to use git and clone the repository. If you want to continue to 
contribute, keep your working copy up to date, and be able to push 
changes, then using GitHub makes sense.

If you are doing QGIS work and wish you had SVN access, then the git 
route is for you...

The GitHub repo is in sync with the QGIS svn repo. We can pull changes
down to my local repo (it is able to pull/push from/to GitHub and also
SVN). So to accept a contribution, I would branch my local copy, pull
the changes, test, and merge back into master. Then use git-svn to
dcommit the changes into the centralized QGIS repo. Change get pushed
back to GitHub.

Right, at that point the svn-dcommit would rewrite commits
to add svn metadata, so the original repo, containing the contributed
change, would likely get a conflict when trying to re-fetch from upstream
later (different commits touching the same files).

Have you tried this round-trip already ?

Hi Jude

If you are able to use QGis 1.7 this now can take a geometry column (formatted as well known text) in a CSV file using the delimited text plugin.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SQL Anywhere Library conflict
Message-ID: <AANLkTina0J+kKhsCDvSS9RC4_jFhXOuj62O3LbJ2g3xj@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Dave (and others interested in SQL Anywhere)

I cam across a problem with linking QGIS libs where I would get the
following error messages:


Linking CXX executable qgis
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.4.5/../../../../lib/libgdal1.7.0.so:
undefined reference to `SQLInstallDriverEx'
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.4.5/../../../../lib/libgdal1.7.0.so:

/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.4.5/../../../../lib/libgdal1.7.0.so:

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [src/app/qgis] Error 1
make[1]: *** [src/app/CMakeFiles/qgis.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

After quite a bit of poking around I realised that there was probably
a conflict introduced by my recent SQLAnywhere install.

I commented out the line I added to my ~/.bashrc for SQL Anywhere:

# Added by Tim for sql anywhere support
#source /opt/sqlanywhere12/bin64/sa_config.sh

And then started a new shell, after which the QGIS libs linked
properly. I believe this is due the the libodbc shipped with SQL
Anywhere conflicting with my system lib.

So with that background, is there any elegant way to deal with this? I
guess the stock answer will be that typical users wont be compiling
QGIS so probably won't run into this - though I don't know if there
will be runtime issues introduced by this. Any thoughts? How do you
have your compilation environment set up?

Regards

Hi all,

I have been building a plugin and reached a dead end. I am parsing the csv
resource into a variable. but according to the qgis documentation, the
resource has to be a file. Can it be a variable. the code section that has
this issue is
    results = ft_client.query(SQL().select(371443,None,None))

    uri = results."?delimiter=%s&xField=%s&yField=%s" % (",", "Address",
"LONGITUDE")
    vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri, "layer_name_you_like", "delimitedtext")
there is something very wrong with the uri section of the code. the docs
just use file paths, what of a variable as is my case? How would i go about
loading this. Please help

Possibly your issue arises from the fact that you cannot perform sql
type queries on delimited text layers. Try add a delimited layer to
QGIS interactively and you will see the Layer->Query option for that
layer is disabled.

Jude,

you have to save the contents of your variable to a temporary file and
then load that file as a vector layer.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] HF Wroclaw financial report
Message-ID: <1293630578.9026.119.camel@fox>

Hi all.
This is the final financial report of the 4th hackfest in Wroclaw.
We spent a total of 1863,78 euro for the fest. Only a few developers actually applied
for refund of travelling and lodging expenses, therefore much of this was spent for food
during the meeting.
During 2010, we obtained a total of 5322.75 euro in donations; this includes 1k from
our bronze sponsors[0], 1k from FOSSGIS Germany, and 1.5k from GFOSS.it; private
donations amounted to 1822.75 euro.
Therefore, at current levels, our activities are sustainable, and we can afford
continuing the partial support to the participation of developers also to the next
hackfest.
Of course higher level of donations will allow us to do more, so everybody is
encouraged to start donating.
A full list of donors is maintained here[1]. If there is any omission, please let me
know.
All the best.

I'm getting the following errors under both linux (ubuntu) and windows:

valid. Do you want to use it anyway?", but then even clicking "yes"
returns no line/polygon.

Hi Giovanni,

I am really sorry, I did not answer to comment you left at reference 
page to this plugin,but it was little bit busy time before Xmas.

1.) sorry, but you should read that page carefully (and please look at 
the pictures, too). You should not use other tolerance value except 
zero, while are you digitizing layers, which are projected inlat/lon CRSs.

2.) This is really bug and i will try to do something with this.

Regards
Pavol

Message-ID: <AANLkTimxtWbnmUkJYjxmqnh1bH+gZJ_eLWzKaqYy8Nke@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to create a Qgis.pro (i.e. QGIS Qt Creator Project) based
on this instruction [1].

I am stuck on this step 3.

3. Run cmake in CMake Wizard. You can run it after adding project for
   this you should navigate to cmake build directory it is qtcreator-build in
   project root and run ccmake .. like usually);

There are a lot of cmake files in the cmake directory, which one should I use?

Anyway, anybody has exciting Qgis.pro (Qt Creator project) already and
like to share it.

I like to try to compile Qgis in Qt - Android lighthouse and see what happen.

You watch the video on Android - Qt Creator Integration here - Video.

http://code.google.com/p/android-lighthouse/wiki/QtCreatorIntegration

Anybody interested in QGIS mobile for Android?


Thanks. Noli

Using QtCreator with QGis is easy. To open QGis in it you should do:

   1. In menu File->Open File or Project (Ctrl+O);
   2. In open file dialog find CMakeLists.txt in the root of QGIs
   (/usr/local/src/qgis_trunk/CMakeLists.txt) and open it;
   3. Run cmake in CMake Wizard. You can run it after adding project for
   this you should navigate to cmake build directory it is qtcreator-build in
   project root and run ccmake .. like usually);
   4. After that QtCreator adds the new project with name qgis-1.x.x.
   5. If you need to correct cmake options you can do it now (see 3);
   6. Compile QGis (Ctrl+B);
   7. Switch to tab Projects. In section Build Settings->Build Steps push
   Details button and add in Additional arguments: install.
   8. In section Run Settings push +Add and select in combo box Custom
   Executable then push Details and add in Executable:
   /patch/to/qgis/executable (/usr/local/bin/qgis);
   9. Start Debugging QGis: F5.

Hi,

OK. I managed to install cmake package.

But still I don't what should be in the Qgis.pro after I created this project?

Anybody can post what should be in entries in Qgis.pro?

Hi Noli

I'm not an expert in Qt-Creator (I'm a vim guy!) but the last time I
tested it, I didnt see any option to create a .pro file from the
CMakeLists.txt based project. In fact that was one of my irritations
of trying to use creator - having to re-read in the project from the
CMakeLists.txt file every time. But it could be just that I missed
something essential in the process.

I'm also interested in making an android port at some point...

Regards

Tim

sorry, I missed it. Maybe it would be better to simply lock the spinner
to "0" when the project is in lat/lon?

No, Qt Creator does not create .pro files for cmake projects (AFAIK)
because it handles cmake projects natively. Anyway, is there a reason
why would you like to produce a .pro file? Remember that CMake is much
more complex build system than qmake, so any conversion would be
necessary lossy.

Btw. to get QGIS working on android, first try to compile the minimal
dependencies before trying to compile QGIS, that is Proj, GDAL, GEOS
and Sqlite.

@Tim: creator has also FakeVim mode for good old vim users ;-)

I need to customization some function (vector->geometry tools->simplyfy geometries). And i add path to trunk after ready.

How to write GUI tool? As a part of QGis application (e.g. measure tool) or a python/c++ plugin (e.g. coordinate capture plugin)? Like better?

Hi Tim, Martin and Nathan,

Thank for your replies.

Nathan, OK. I got errors in "Run Cmake".

I need to install the packages needed to build qgis first before
trying the Android-Qt port.

Hi,

      I am trying to debug QGIS in QtCreator - IDE and the platform i am
working is Ubuntu Maverick(10.10), I followed the steps as below

Using QtCreator with QGis is easy. To open QGis in it you should do:

  1. In menu File->Open File or Project (Ctrl+O);
  2. In open file dialog find CMakeLists.txt in the root of QGIs
  (/usr/local/src/qgis_trunk/CMakeLists.txt) and open it;
  3. Run cmake in CMake Wizard. You can run it after adding project for
  this you should navigate to cmake build directory it is qtcreator-build in

  project root and run ccmake .. like usually);
  4. After that QtCreator adds the new project with name qgis-1.x.x.
  5. If you need to correct cmake options you can do it now (see 3);
  6. Compile QGis (Ctrl+B);
  7. Switch to tab Projects. In section Build Settings->Build Steps push
  Details button and add in Additional arguments: install.
  8. In section Run Settings push +Add and select in combo box Custom
  Executable then push Details and add in Executable:
  /patch/to/qgis/executable (/usr/local/bin/qgis);
  9. Start Debugging QGis: F5.

       *Can you please give me brief steps to follow after giving break
points?
*
  I tried "debug -> start debugging" , but the process did not stop at break
point, it goes on running the QGIS Application .

And one more question, *whether QtCreator- IDE is recommended for visual
debugging of QGIS or any other IDE is available?*

Regards,
Sunil

Hi Sergey

>And i add path to trunk after ready.

Thank you. The analysis part of QGIS is a place where help is very much 
appreciated.

For the f-tools functions, an implementation in src/app (and placing the tool 
menu under 'vector' as it is now) would be better than a plugin. Because 
vector analysis is generic functionality that, ideally,  should be there 
without the need to load a plugin.

Regards,
Marco

Step 3a: When you run ccmake, look for the setting CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE,
which should be the third one down or thereabouts. Select it, and type
Debug as the build type. Then press c for configure and g for
generate. Head back to QtCreator and build the project and you should
see, amongst other things, a -g in the compiler command line which
indicates debug symbols are being generated.

I have not seen a way to save the project options explicitly, but I have
tested that at least some of the compiling options are saved
automatically in a CMakeLists.txt.user  file which is automatically 
created next to CMakeLists.txt.
For a discussion on a similar issue:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3898763/where-does-qtcreator-with-cmake-store-run-and-build-settings-and-how-to-set-via


Still maybe part of the following has to be done every time.

Here are some steps I've used:

If I'm correct, with qtcreator, you have to put the correct cmake
parameters *the first time* you configure the project (hence, when you
open the CMakeLists.txt and click "Run CMake")

Here are the options I use myself
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/bin/myqgisdirectory -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
-DENABLE_TESTS=False -DWITH_MAPSERVER=False

The following one is mandatory if you want to control where to install
the compiled files (choose a place where you do not need sudo rights to
write):
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=


You can also configure the various build steps.

You'll find all of this detailed here:

Regarding to what Martin said. Had anythink changed since then? I have smae
problem and would happily great such GUI member.

If not: Where shall i look to find it in QGIS code so that i can base my own
DockWidget for my stand alone QGIS based application?

This behavior is related with layer properties, not project properties. 
I was little searching in API and found only one promising function: 
geographicFlag() in QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem class, and is really 
far beyond my imagination, how to connect this with QgsMapLayer. At 
least i added "Use preferentially with layers projected in rectangular 
CRSs" to plugin description.

Single click issue is (hopefully) fixed in newly uploaded version 
(0.2.1) of plugin.

I was little bit testing my plugin and would like to please dev of 
avoidIntersections function of QgsGeometry class, if he could have a 
look at behavior of this function in combination with my plugin. I am 
attaching two pictures describing this situation: you have two polygons 
created with Freehand editing plugin with avoid intersection function on 
- everything went OK, but when you want to add another one (with avoid 
intersection function on), newly added polygon is in 50% of cases corrupted.

Thanks to Giovanni for testing

Regards
Pavol

Yeah I saw that! For me though the CMakeList.txt generated creator
project seems to leave out almost all of the ui files in the creator
project browser - do I have to do something special to make them
visible? I looked for a creator mode in vim so I guess creator is one
up on vim :-P

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Patch for #3369
Message-ID: <AANLkTimA7s55NGh5XX2tMUai+8y94Y_E0VB7xmz-U+3v@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I've attached a patch for the third part of bug
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3369 (which is really a separate bug
from the other two parts), hope this is the right place to do it.

As for the other parts, it works fine for me with QGIS r14982M on
Kubuntu 10.04, Qt 4.6.2.

Attaching the patch to the ticket  at

will help as well.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] MapServer Export Sugestion
Message-ID: <AANLkTikx7ZLXPdpqi_-kNoP3CUJBT5OECL7Niq3dVdK1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gary,
I've made a small change (one line) on the mapserver export plugin. On file
ms_export.py line 560 I've added the line:
      layer_def += "      'gml_include_items'     'all' \n" ## Optional
(serves all attributes for layer)

This is to expose the attributes on the wfs served by the mapfile generated.
I thought it would be a good idea to have a checkbox asking the user "Expose
all attributes on the layers?". This way this line could be optional.
I've tested it on my qgis installation on windows 7 and everything seems to
work like a charm with the attributes read by wfs.
I think it's a desired (and fairly simple) feature. What do you think?
Best regards,
