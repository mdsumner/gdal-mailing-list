Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Offline layer
Message-ID: <7553a242-d1b6-8af4-84a0-fba22954e114@gmail.com>

Hi all,

loading a project with many offline layers next to each layer an offline 
icon appears 8and that's correct :) ).

I've changed the data source of all the layers but the offline icon is 
still there. I'm struggling to understand where can I turn it off but I 
cannot find it in the layer properties and/or via pyqgis.

Does someone have suggestions?

Cheers and thanks!

Matteo

Hi Matteo

It's considering the custom property "isOfflineEditable".

You should be able to set/unset it with pyqgis.

Cheers
Dave

Hi,

And question: should the offline icon be removed after the data sources have been updated?

In theory, it should be in the pyqgis api documentation

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Mineral exploration plugin for GSoC 22
Message-ID: <CAAfi6HP8P7QBV=+WS9cSvPCVp=bDRtmB3OkP1CnNVc+S07F05g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,
I am a PhD student at IIT Bombay, working in planetary remote sensing and
mineral exploration.
I have been toying with the idea of building a mineral exploration plugin
for QGIS for a while. In December I got some valuable feedback on how to
start development on a QGIS plugin from the community, and have been
improving my ability to code since then. It has been a learning and
humbling experience. However, I believe that with guidance from the
community I can develop a plugin that would be of great benefit to the
mineral exploration community, particularly resource-constrained students.
As such, I would like to implement a QGIS plugin similar to the ArcSDM
toolbox for ArcGIS as part of GSoC '22. As I am rather new to developing
QGIS plugins, I would like to start early on working on this proposal, and
hopefully implement a small part of it as a prototype before submission.
I'll share an initial draft of the proposal by the end of the week, for
your comments.
Regards,
Sandeepan Dhoundiyal.

Hi Patrick,

mmm where?

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/search.html?q=isOfflineEditable&check_keywords=yes&area=default

I was wondering if there is a list of all the custom properties 
available for the layer, but I cannot find it. Also the 
QgsMapLayer.setCustomProperty does not explicitly list the keys available:

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsMapLayer.html#qgis.core.QgsMapLayer.setCustomProperty

Cheers and thanks

Hi Harrissou,

that's a good question. From what I understood the icon/flag is added 
"manually" when needed (by QFieldSync, Offline editing plugin, etc).

Not sure how/when it should removed: maybe changing the data source is 
still pointing to an offline layer.

At the beginning I was thinking that if a layer was "converted" to 
offline and for example put into a geopackage, then some additional 
metadata were added in some additional table within the geopackage itself.

But now I understand that the flag is manually added by the developer

Cheers

Matteo

Hi all,

Since I didn't get feedback (other than Lutra's) from my first call,
probably because it was made during holidays, allow me to do another call
for reviewers for a bunch of pull requests that are getting stale in the
Documentation repository. 3.22 LTR docs release is getting closer!

For reference,
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Areview_requested

Hi QGIS contributors,

May I request your review for a number of pull requests in the
documentation repository?
Most of them are almost ready; they "simply" have a couple of
sentences/options that I am not able to fully confirm their
correctness/goals (and don't want the docs mislead people). For
convenience, the questions are added in the PR as a comment. You'll find
the pull requests at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Areview_requested
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Areview_requested>
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Areview_requested>

They cover categories like Processing, GPS, mesh, tile vector, server,
temporal, pyqgis, security... so I hope you will find something your review
would be welcome at.

The above PRs are imho priorities/blocked ones (getting stale) but if you
feel like doing more, there are many other PRs you can help move forward.
Having your help would help us close a good number of issues and initiate
the 3.22 release process in a better shape.

Thanks in advance for your contributions.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Questions and problems around Python expression
 functions
Message-ID: <bb6e0d95-95d7-603d-0154-b775c458174b@wheregroup.com>

Hey guys!

So all I wanted to do this morning was clarify the `referenced_columns` 
parameter for Python expression functions (#46161 and #46162) and add 
another example function to the default template that uses a feature. 
But I ended up in some confusing and conflicting documentation and 
behaviour around them :D

Docs and example updates would be something I would love to contribute. 
It's not really things I can package into issues or feature requests 
because I don't know how it is supposed to work and some of the magic is 
pretty magical so here we go. I wish we had a forum with proper 
formatting and stuff for sustainable discussions but well, copy to a 
markdown parser if you want:

# qgsfunction functions without parameters that also do not use feature 
and parent
QGIS always passes a feature (which can be an in-valid one if the 
expression is used e.g. in a context where there is no feature involved 
like 
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/393249/writing-custom-qgis-function-that-works-without-a-feature-given-as-input/) 
and the parent QgsExpression to expression functions. Often one might 
not need them in the function so why have them in the function signature.

The code documentation suggests "hiding" them by using "`*args`", 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py#L39-L44:

So I wrote a function that needs no parameters at all and used `*args`.

```
@qgsfunction()
def something_independent(*args):
 ??? # read some stuff from files
 ??? # make some network requests
 ??? # do something with time
 ??? # or whatever
 ??? return something
```

Currently this results in an error because in 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py 
inspect.getfullargspec(function).args is used (which ignores `*args` 
(->`varargs`) and `**kwargs` (->`varkw`) and is empty in the case of my 
function) and then the last argument is tried to be read from the empty 
list.

Is a function like this supposed to be supported?
I think it would be great if so and quite unintuitive if not.

# How exactly is qgsfunction's args= argument supposed to work?

With `args="auto"` (the default) everything works like expected, we can 
specify various arguments, then QGIS adds `feature` and `parent` and 
handles the optional `context` as well. Python does not get surprised 
with any mismatch between the function signature and what it receives.

```
@qgsfunction(args="auto")
def arghs(a, b, c, feature, parent):
 ? return f"{a}, {b}, {c}"
```

`arghs(1, 2, 3)` -> "1, 2, 3"

With `args=3` I expected to be able to use 3 custom arguments (in 
addition to `feature`, `parent`[, `context`].

https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/expressions/expression.html#function-editor 
makes it sound like that.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py#L140 
says "`Number of parameters, set to 'auto' to accept a variable length 
of parameters.`"

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/b1144173e4e5204b1fe546324c0a3498eec07053/src/gui/qgsexpressionbuilderwidget.cpp#L229-L231 
says "`Defines the number of arguments. With ``args = 'auto'`` the 
number of arguments will automatically be extracted from the signature. 
With ``args = -1``, any number of arguments are accepted.`"

Sounds like what the docs say.

```
@qgsfunction(args=3)
def arghs(a, b, c, feature, parent):
 ? return f"{a}, {b}, {c}"
```

`arghs(1, 2, 3)` -> `Eval Error: arghs() missing 2 required positional 
arguments: 'feature' and 'parent'`

Hm, do I have to count `feature` and `parent` too?

```
@qgsfunction(args=5)
def arghs(a, b, c, feature, parent):
 ? return f"{a}, {b}, {c}"
```

`arghs(1, 2, 3)` -> `Parser Errors: arghs function is called with wrong 
number of arguments. Expected 5 but got 3.`

? what is going on?!

```
@qgsfunction(args=3)
def arghs(a, b, c, *args):
 ? return f"{a}, {b}, {c}"
```

`arghs(1, 2, 3)` ->? `'[1, 2, 3], <qgis._core.QgsFeature object at 
0x7f1cda4b5120>,?'`

```
@qgsfunction(args=3)
def arghs(a, b, c):????????????????? # no *args
 ? return f"{a}, {b}, {c}"
```

`arghs(1, 2, 3)` ->? `'[1, 2, 3], <qgis._core.QgsFeature object at 
0x7f1cda4b5120>,?'`

```
@qgsfunction(args=-1)??????????????? # -1
def arghs(a, b, c):
 ? return f"{a}, {b}, {c}"
```

`arghs(1, 2, 3)` ->? `'[1, 2, 3], <qgis._core.QgsFeature object at 
0x7f1cda4b5120>,?'`

`arghs(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0)` -> `'[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0], 
<qgis._core.QgsFeature objec?'`

? wat

So does `args=n` actually mean "put the n first parameter values before 
the last two (`feature` and `parent`) into a list"?

# Handling and necessity of the referenced_columns parameter
## Docs vs code conflict
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py#L146-L147 
and thus the online docs say `referenced_columns` is empty by default.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py#L28-L29 
however sets `referenced_columns=[QgsFeatureRequest.ALL_ATTRIBUTES]` as 
default.

`QgsFeatureRequest.ALL_ATTRIBUTES` sounds reasonable as default (things 
will work, user *can* tweak if needed) **however** I wonder if this led 
to issues with expression functions being used in contexts where there 
are no features involved, e.g. layout text items.

## ... leading to a hacky workaround?
PR #42745 was a change of the default example function template to 
include an empty list and references a case of a user at 
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/393249/writing-custom-qgis-function-that-works-without-a-feature-given-as-input

As a user I would think "I am not doing anything with features, why 
would I need to care about any columns?" so I wonder if this is 
something that could/should be handled differently?

## Hidden Python errors
Last but not least 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/32c2cea54cb92bbb2243b222816c8154c2b9adf9/src/gui/qgsexpressionpreviewwidget.cpp#L102-L113 
hides actual errors if the expression happens to run in a context where 
those checks are true. Import error or referencing a variable that does 
not exist in your function? User gets the `"No feature was found on this 
layer to evaluate the expression."` message although that would be a 
less pressing issue if relevant at all ;)

# This and that
- Does a qgsfunction really *always* get some `feature` (potentially 
made-up and invalid if none is available in the context, e.g. layout 
text item) and `parent`?
- 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py#L50-L55 
is missing descriptions of the parameters.
- 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py#L28 
sets `usesgeometry=False` which also actually used and is what the docs 
say but 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py#L60 
uses `usesGeometry=True` which might lead to confusion.
- Similarly 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py#L29 
uses `referenced_columns=[QgsFeatureRequest.ALL_ATTRIBUTES]` by default 
(note the "listification"!) but 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py#L61 
uses `referencedColumns=QgsFeatureRequest.ALL_ATTRIBUTES`. 
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsFeatureRequest.html#a717fcc8fa42a78f0b4f30253ca1b478e 
says it is a "A special attribute that if set matches all attributes." 
so it should be correct inside the list.
- 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py#L154 
and 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/python/core/additions/qgsfunction.py#L164 
have some colons behind the decorator lines, those should be removed

Hi Johannes,

I like to answer at least one of your questions:
> - Does a qgsfunction really *always* get some `feature` (potentially
> made-up and invalid if none is available in the context, e.g. layout
> text item) and `parent`?

Yes, a qgsfunction always gets a feature. By default it's invalid, which 
you can see when running the following code snippet:

from qgis.core import QgsExpressionFunction, QgsExpressionContext, 
QgsExpression

class MyFunction(QgsExpressionFunction):

     def __init__(self):
         super().__init__('myfunction', -1, 'MyGroup', 'Help Text')

     def func(self, values, context: QgsExpressionContext, parent, node):
         print(context.feature().isValid())
         return 42

# register function
func = MyFunction()
QgsExpression.registerFunction(func)

# use function
exp = QgsExpression('myfunction()')
context = QgsExpressionContext()
result = exp.evaluate(context)
print(f'Result {result}')


Greetings, Benjamin

I'd say this is a nice FeatureRequest, as more and more web-services start to use this newish [0][1](1995) PATCH thing...

Maybe Ale is available (if you have some funding?)? I know he is known to fly around in that area of the code :-)

Which I found out recently is packaged with Windows QGIS...(?) So 'safe' to use in QGIS... (though I would prefer to use QgsBlockingNetworkRequest....)

Hi,

I think PATCH would be a nice addition and it's not difficult to implement.

Kind regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Resize colorbar in legend
Message-ID: <PH1P110MB1588945421B98ADD57E90D92B5299@PH1P110MB1588.NAMP110.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello,

I have tried both the QgsLayoutItemLegend and the QgsLayerTreeView classes to display the colorbar for a loaded raster/mesh layer in a custom QGIS application (3.20 Odense, using C++ api), but the colorbar is way too small.  Is there a way to maximize the size relative to its parent layout/widget?  My last resort is to create one from scratch, which I'd rather not do.

Brian

OK :)

I assumed that would be more detailed than the Pyqgis developers' cookbook.

(for wider reference in case anyone comes across this thread in search
results:)

In general, it's better NOT to use requests and stick with the native
PyQGIS network API instead. There's a number of reasons why using
requests for QGIS plugin is discouraged:

- It doesn't respect QGIS network settings, like the proxy settings
- It doesn't use the standard QGIS handling of authentication and
dealing with things like SSL errors
- Requests aren't logged via the Network Logger panel

Plus:

- The requests package might not be installed in UserX's system and thus 
your plugin might just not work unless the user knows how to install 
Python packages manually. urllib would always be available (though it 
does not do PATCH without some tiny monkey patching: 
https://stackoverflow.com/a/9023005/4828720) so use that if you really 
can't use the builtin PyQGIS API.

Cheers, Hannes

Here's another one I just discovered: install the "no annoyance"
extension from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2182/noannoyance/
to disable the (annoying) default behaviour where new application
windows get opened behind other applications and you just get a "....
application is ready" notification instead. This is especially
annoying as it impacts all the nice shortcuts QGIS exposes for doing
things like directly opening the file manager to see newly created
pdf/layer exports/etc.

This one is https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2035283 an 
recently solved - gdb will now only download debuginfos if input came 
from a terminal (unless debuginfod is globally disabled obviously, 
either through clearing DEBUGINFOD_URLS or echo "set debuginfod enabled 
off" > ~/.gdbinit).

Hi Kim,

you posted this two weeks ago already and Andrea Giudiceandrea answered 
to you with

The only new information you added now is

- no difference.

Have you actually tried to load the WMS server you created as a WMS 
server in QGIS? A web browser does not know WMS, it just sees the 
messages used by WMS (in XML) and does not know anything special (or 
spatial) about it. To use a WMS you need a client capable of "speaking" 
WMS, such as QGIS.

Please be aware that this is the developers mailing list, user questions 
might be more suitable for qgis-user. :)

Cheers, Hannes

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Server: wording WFS3 / OGC API - Features
Message-ID: <007bdaca8815b06a723c81038ee501fc@posteo.de>

Hi,

currently the term "WFS3" is still used for the standard QGIS Server 
"OGC API - Features" landing page URL:

http://localhost/qgisserver/wfs3

and the docs:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/server_manual/services/ogcapif.html

Looks like WFS3 is not the official OGC wording anymore, also GDAL 
renamed the driver:
https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/oapif.html

Should we also go ahead and drop the use of the term "WFS3"?

Cheers,
Bjoern

Yes, definitely.

Also the mention of "Draft" should be now removed.

ciao,
a few days ago about 600 new strings were added to Transifex to be
translated.
Most of these strings are a single word whose context is: [1]
Context: QgsExpression
Resource: qgis-application

As an Italian translation group we can't figure out exactly what they are;
they look like search tags.
Do you think they should be translated or not?

thank you

Hi stefano, all

These are indeed search tags for expression functions implemented in [0]
and pushed as single words to be translated in Transifex.
I wonder if it's better for translators to have single (somehow)
uncontextualised string to translate [1], or whether we should display the
list of words to translate, as done for Processing tags.

thank you for your quick reply.

the previous tag strings are untranslated, as you can see in [1],
so do you suggest to translate also  the old tags?
in this way, do the function/modules of Processing and Expression are
searchable both in english and italian?

please sorry for these questions maybe trivial...

Not sure if you wanted to add a link here (something like the Processing
tags [0]), or were referring to your initial image...

I'd say "Yes" if you want Italian users to find things using italian words
everywhere

in this way, do the function/modules of Processing and Expression are

> For Expression functions, yes! The way it's implemented, you could use
both English and translated tags (if any) to find a function.
For Processing, if I understood correctly, it uses a single language. If
you want both English and Italian tags to be used for search, you need to
keep source strings and add translated ones to the list in Transifex. If
there's no translation or translation == source as in [0] e.g., then only
English words are used for search.

Hope that clarifies (and that I'm correct),

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Re-sizing legend item
Message-ID: <PH1P110MB15886846617C6CC94225DFECB52F9@PH1P110MB1588.NAMP110.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

I am attempting to display a legend for a mesh map layer in a custom QGIS application (3.20 Odense, C++). I've previously just added the layer tree view to a dock widget, but it took too much space and the color ramp displayed was still too small. This time I'm using the QgsLayout class to hopefully resize the legend and layout. A code excerpt and the image of my app is below; as you can see you can hardly make out the legend at the bottom. Is there any other way to make the legend bigger? My next idea is to find the bounding box for the legend, take a snapshot, and add as a QPixmap/QLabel widget.

QgsLayout *lay = new QgsLayout(prj->instance()); //prj = QgsProject
lay->setUnits(QgsUnitTypes::LayoutPixels);
QgsLayoutItemLegend *legend = new QgsLayoutItemLegend(lay);
legend->setAutoUpdateModel(false);
QgsLayerTree *tree = legend->model()->rootGroup();

for ( QgsMapLayer *mlay: prj->instance()->mapLayers() )
{
    if ( mlay->type() != QgsMapLayerType::MeshLayer )
    {
        tree->removeLayer(mlay);
    }
}

QgsLegendSettings lset = legend->legendSettings();
QgsLegendRenderer rend(legend->model(),lset);

for ( QgsLayerTreeNode *node: tree->children() )
{
    rend.setNodeLegendStyle(node,QgsLegendStyle::Hidden);
}

legend->sizeWithUnits().setUnits(QgsUnitTypes::LayoutPixels);
legend->sizeWithUnits().setWidth(400);
legend->sizeWithUnits().setHeight(100);
lay->addLayoutItem(legend);
lay->refresh();
QgsLayoutView *view = new QgsLayoutView();
view->setCurrentLayout(lay);
ui->gridLayout->addWidget(view);

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Can't open postgrest geojson service
Message-ID: <f12cdae8-d3c6-c5a6-8bb6-f93bd0d3cb75@sigeal.com>

Hi,

I have a PostgreSql stored procedure which returns a geojson feature 
collection created with json_build_object function.
This web service opens fine in OpenLayers, however, when I try to open 
it in QGIS, with data source manager -> vector -> protocol -> geojson :

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/247591/153418104-5a611cb2-ad4d-4c5b-ac87-0c08be006c9e.png

I get the following error :
> Invalid data source: [myurl]/rpc/wod_geojson is not a valid or 
> recognized data source.
This is the query wrapped in a plpgsql function called my_geojson :
> |SELECT json_build_object(
> ??? 'type', 'FeatureCollection', 'features',
> ??? json_agg(
> ??? ??? json_build_object(
> ?? ??? ? ?? 'type', 'Feature', 'id', id, 'geometry',
> ??? ??? ??? ST_AsGeoJSON(ST_Transform(geometry, 4326))::json,
> ??? ??? ??? 'properties', json_build_object(
> ??? ??? ??? ??? 'lib', lib
> ??? ??? ??? )
> ??? ??? )
> ??? )
> )::json my_geojson FROM (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER() id, * FROM 
> mytable) tmp|
This is the url I use to call the service:
> |http://mydomain:3000/rpc/my_geojson|
I tested a similar geojson REST service served with pg_featureserv, and 
it works fine...

Environment :

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsCheckableComboBox setEditable makes QGIS crash
Message-ID: <d8c1b99f-4091-3a93-1e36-84a0df4a8f0e@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm using a QgsCheckableComboBox in an UI of a plugin. If I use the flag 
setEditable = False, bot from UI or from code, QGIS simply explodes 
(3.16 from package, 3.23 compiled on a Debian sid OS).

What is strange, at least for me, is that even by using in a python 
console the following code, QGIS explodes:

c = QgsCheckableComboBox()
c.setEditable(False)
c.show()

while without the c.setEditable(False) no problem and also the following 
code is working nice:

c = QComboBox()
c.setEditable(False)
c.show()

Not sure if it is something related to my system. Should I file a ticket?

Thanks!

Matteo

FYI: OSGeo now has its translation infrastructure, based on the
free software project Weblate: https://weblate.osgeo.org

Weblate can be configured to automatically push new translations
to the official repository (either directly or as pull requests on
some platforms, including github) and autonomously fetch template
changes and translations pushed to the official repository.

We're now using it for postgis:

Hi all

With the release of 3.24 coming out next week, could I ask you to help
prepare the changelog? If you developed features, check if your
descriptions came through nicely. If you just want to help, add screenshots
/ gifs, tidy up text, etc.

Please don't set the category yet, we will set the category for each item
as we review it.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing algorithm to open up external dialog
 window
Message-ID: <CABPxTTr095X1opjG_qButmanBoHXeJKtOVAKQBu6Jfrsik9vwQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have been trying to run a processing algorithm that generates a table
from the stats calculated from an input point layer. After the processing
algorithm is run I display an external dialog window and populate that
window with the output results of the processing algorithm. I like using
the processing toolbox because the algorithms run in their own thread and
allow the user to continue working. I don't know if what I am trying to do
is completely possible or not but I am most of the way there, but I have
encountered one problem that I am not sure how to solve. Here is what I
have so far

I run my processing algorithm and then in postProcessingAlgorithm I open up
the dialog window as follows. Note for right now I am calling the plugin
"testcapabilities'. The returned result from processAlgorithm is a table.


from qgis.utils import plugins
...
    def processAlgorithm(self, parameters, context, feedback):
...
        return {self.PrmOutputResults: self.dest_id}
...
    def postProcessAlgorithm(self, context, feedback):
        retval = super().postProcessAlgorithm(context, feedback)
        # This gives me access to the root of my plugin which contains both
the
        # processing algorithm and the post analysis window.
        plugin = plugins['testcapabilities']
        plugin.showDialog()  # This opens up my dialog window
        # This is the input point vector layer in the processing algorithm
        input_layer = self.parameterAsLayer(self.parameters,
self.PrmInputLayer, context)
        # I believe this gives me access to the table layer I generated  in
the algorithm
        table_layer = QgsProcessingUtils.mapLayerFromString(self.dest_id,
context)
        # This is to attach the input and table layers to my dialogs
QgsMaplayerComboBox widgets
        plugin.setData(input_layer,  table_layer)
        return retval

This successfully displays the dialog and passes on the  input_layer  to
the dialog box and will display it in a QgsMaplayerComboBox in the dialog.
The table generated in processAlgorithm is valid in postProcessAlgorithm,
but if I try to have it displayed in a QgsMaplayerComboBox, it does not
work. I think the reason is because it has not yet been added to the QGS
map layers.

Is there a QgsProcessingAlgorithm method that is called after the output
layer has been added to the QGIS layers panel? If there is then at that
point I should be able to add it to my dialog box.

If this is not possible, then I won't be able to use the processing toolbox
and will need to deal with implementing it in my own dialog box and in a
separate thread.

Thanks,

Calvin

You have to use QgsProcessingLayerPostProcessorInterface for this -- see:
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsProcessingLayerPostProcessorInterface.html
and
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsProcessingContext.html#qgis.core.QgsProcessingContext.LayerDetails.setPostProcessor

(or an example here: https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/401440/28443 )

|myLayer= QgsVectorLayer('http://mydomain:3000/rpc/wod_geojson,

Also, testing with ogrinfo on command line, it fails with 404 error ,

(using --config GDAL_HTTP_HEADER_FILE)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 2022 grant applications are now closed
Message-ID: <73a4fa9a-cc31-aeda-6282-2cc19d05903b@gmx.at>

Dear QGIS Community,

This is to let you know that the form for grant applications is now
closed and that we have received a total of six applications, four of
which fulfill the call requirements. These four applications total ?
25,300.

As a quick teaser, here are the proposals:

 1.  ?Add SQL Logging to the debugging/development panel
    (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/242)
 2. QGIS setting registry enhancement
    (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/245)
 3. Fix handling of provider default value
    clauses/Autogenerate/nextval(...) handling
    (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/247)
 4. Support building QGIS application on Qt 6
    (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/243)

We are now in the QEP discussion phase. The QEP discussion phase ends on
Sunday, 2022-02-27.

Since the total requested budget is equal to the available budget, there
is no need for a voting this year. Assuming that no serious issues are
raised in the QEP discussion phase, all four projects will be funded.

Thank you to everyone who submitted project proposals!

Regards,

Anita

Hello,

I am trying to figure what is the right way to display a webpage within a QGIS plugin and I have a few questions :

  1.  Is it currently possible to use QWebEngineView class with QGIS python console? When I try to import it in QGIS python console, I get the following error :



ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'





2. If it is not currently possible to use QWebEngineView, does it involve major work or is there a chance it will be supported in the near future?



3. Until when can we expect QTWebKit to work in QGIS? Is it still advisable to start a project making extensive use of this module  ?



Thank you for your help!

Best regards,

Jean-Baptiste

It's a very messy, horrible situation with no good ways forward. Right
now you'll need to use QtWebKit, and there's no plans on the horizon
to change this.

Alright, thank you for your help on this! I have just a last question on this topic: 

If I am correct, QtWebKit is deprecated and has been removed from Qt since version 5.6. Does this mean that it will be removed from Qgis whenever the project moves to Qt 6 or is there another way to still ship QtWebKit with Qt 6 ?

Best,

Jean-Baptiste

Hi,

I got a fresh install today with the qgis-full metapackages it fetches
matplotlib but does not solve the issue (I get the same SSL error when I
try to install reportlab). When I try to run it (
*subprocess.call([sys.exec_prefix
+ '/python', "-m", 'pip', 'install', 'reportlab'])* ) from the OsGeo4W
shell it works perfect. Seems like some path is missing/overwritten in the
startup script for QGIS but I can not figure out how solve it :(

Regards,
Axel

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] effectiveness of PostgreSQL provider cache
Message-ID: <Yg490Fd8txB8Byc2@c19>

I've been trying to understand why PostgreSQL connections
are NOT reused while the code in the provider implements
a connection "cache".
Background: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/47391

The connections are (when "shareable"),
from QgsPostgresConn object,
put in a cache (two caches exist: "read-only"
and "read-write") but then are removed from the
cache when unreferenced.

Now the question is: why are them removed from the cache
on last unreference ? Doesn't that make the cache completely
useless ? In which case is a connection then kept alive ?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing Algorithm Gradient Selection?
Message-ID: <CABPxTTpr2-yazyUG_VP54YF7Yz-ny+1YHwROQKpujXdDN8A4fQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am thinking of adding an algorithm that automates the creation of a
density heat map of a point vector layer by the following steps.
1. Call the "Create grid" algorithm.
2. Call the "Count points in polygon" algorithm.
3. Style it with "Graduated" style and choose a gradient from a selection
of heatmaps. This would need to be able to automatically scale to the min
and max values and allow the user to select the mode.

All except for the last can be easily modeled in QGIS; however, there is no
color ramp QgsProcessingParameter for a heatmap.Is there a way to use
QgsProcessingParameterEnum to display a gradient image. Is there a QGIS API
call that would retrieve a set of gradients that could be added to the
QgsProcessingParameterEnum?

Any ideas would be appreciated. This can be manually done in 3 steps by
separately running each of the algorithms and then styling the resulting
vector layer, but it would be nice if it could be done with one algorithm.

Thanks!!!

Hi,

Sandro, interesting reminder (I saw the info few weeks ago).

I've been quickly playing with the postgis weblate project the other day
and few thought/questions:
* one thing that seduces me a lot is that anyone can contribute to
translation. No need to create an account beforehand (unless you want to be
identified as translator); you can anonymously suggest translations and
help any project (I see something, I propose a fix). Interesting for people
that do not necessarily want to create an account for a one-time
contribution. Would avoid to have hundreds of people in a team but only
very few actually translating; But do signed-in people receive
notifications of suggestions?
* Btw, is there a team management in it? In Tx, unless it's specific to
QGIS setup, before translating you should get accepted by a project
language coordinator. My testing shows that, once identified as OSGeo
member, I could translate anything anywhere in OSGeo Weblate. Or is this
openness  specific to the current projects.
* It seems there's a quite amazing panel of quality checks run over the
translations (https://docs.weblate.org/en/weblate-4.10.1/user/checks.html#)
* To be a translator, you need an OSGeo ID. No other option?
* How is the PostGIS translation community? Did the people translating in
the previous platform (Transifex?) move with you? Any idea how many you
lost meanwhile? I see you have a quite lower number of target languages
compared to QGIS projects.
* Few weeks later, what actual advantages do you see with being on Weblate?

Many questions and there are probably some I can find their answers in the
weblate doc. So if you wanna share your specific experience of migration,
it would be nice.
Regards,
Harrissou

I did not receive an email notification for your suggestions, but I do
see a count of suggestion when I log in.

I'm not an expert, but I know in PostGIS we required "approval" state
for translations before they are actually pushed to the repository.

We didn't enable other options. They *may* be supported but I'm not
sure if it can be done on a per-project basis.

Yes

Nope.

The workflow is more continuous now: changes pushed in official
repository are automatically picked up by weblate, weblate approved
translations are automatically pushed to repository.

Other advantages I see (but could be just me) are:

  - Translators don't need to use proprietary software
  - Translators don't need an account on yet another platform
    (OSGeo ID can be used for all aspects of PostGIS: trac/gitea/translate/CI)

> Many questions and there are probably some I can find their answers in the

We've always kept the ability to translate locally, and will keep
doing that, so that migration is really "just" a *users* migration
(ie: those users who might be accustomed to one platform are required
to move to another one).

Regina may have a better view on the topic.

Is there a QGIS API call that would retrieve a set of gradients that could be added to the QgsProcessingParameterEnum?

My approach would be:

1. Get a list of all color ramp names via
QgsStyle.defaultStyle().colorRampNames()
2. Use a QgsProcessingParameterString parameter for the color ramp
name instead of a QgsProcessingParameterEnum, and use the approach
described at https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsProcessingParameterString.html#qgis.core.QgsProcessingParameterString
to show the parameter as a combobox containing only the existing color
ramp names.

i.e.

ramp_names = QgsStyle.defaultStyle().colorRampNames()
ramp_name_param = QgsProcessingParameterString('RAMP_NAME', 'Color ramp name')
ramp_name_param.setMetadata( {'widget_wrapper': {'value_hints': ramp_names } } )
self.addParameter(ramp_name_param)

Why use a string parameter instead of an enum? Well, the enum
parameters are designed for a fixed set of choices which are
internally all referred to by their numerical index. It works well for
choices which are static, and which won't ever vary
installation-by-installation. But color ramps WILL vary install by
install, as users may have renamed/added/removed ramps. So the
numerical indexes of different ramps won't necessarily match across
different installs. Ultimately, if another script/process/model uses
your algorithm and has a hard coded value for this parameter, of say
"5", corresponding to a desired color ramp on the developers machine,
then different users will get totally different ramps corresponding to
this value!

With the string approach the parameter value would always be hardcoded
as a string value (the ramp name), so things remain nice and
predictable across different installations*.

Nyall

* of course, a user may still have deleted the desired color ramp, so
you should put a run-time check in your processAlgorithm step to test
whether the parameter value for RAMP_NAME is actually available in the
default style. Something like:

ramp_name = self.parameterAsString(parameters, 'RAMP_NAME', context)
ramp = QgsStyle.defaultStyle().colorRamp(ramp_name)
if ramp is None:
    raise QgsProcessingException('Color ramp {} is not
available'.format(ramp_name))

Appeared to be a system error, removing an old python-sip4 package fixed 
the problem =)

Message-ID: <CAL9iSMEaU+XVz0Y3KFn1LC9FwASRwSzb_BG9DxkVjH3QZ2f23Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I just updated QGIS to newest version (3.22.3) and got a warning from
antivirus (Avast Free Antivirus) software for file "libgrass_gmath.7.8.dll"
located in "C:\OSGeo4W\apps\grass\grass78\lib" folder.

Antivirus software reports that file is infected with virus "Win64:Evo-gen
[Susp]".

I will report it as false positive, but just wanted to check did anyone
else encountered this?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] processing temporal animation export in parallel
Message-ID: <CABkWtfixUpOKUj0zCYw9j3JypKWO6JnqvYJW2QCsLryz57xx4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

The temporal animation functionality of QGIS is great. I am currently
playing with it, probably a little out-of-scope, to make a travel animation
on a map. Everything works great, except that at high frame rates and high
resolution, exporting the animation to images is very slow (hours).

I dug into the code a little, and in bool QgsTemporalUtils::exportAnimation
I see:

while ( currentFrame < totalFrames )
{
    ...
    QPainter p( &img );
    QgsMapRendererCustomPainterJob job( ms, &p );
    job.start();
    job.waitForFinished();
    ...
}

Which renders each image in sequence. I am new to QGIS development
specifically, so forgive my ignorance, but could the jobs system be used to
render them in parallel instead? Could this potentially speed up the
process significantly? If this is feasible, I'd gladly make a feature
request, and it also looks like a nice PR I could contribute myself
potentially? I'd love to hear your thoughts.
Cheers,

Dolf.

def removeLayer(path_layer):
    # remove layer from TOC if already loaded
    basefile = os.path.basename(path_layer)
    diff_layer = os.path.splitext(basefile)[0]
    directory = os.path.dirname(path_layer)
    extensions = ["shp", "shx", "dbf", "prj", "sbn", "sbx", "fbn",
"fbx", "ain", "aih", "ixs", "mxs", "atx", "xml",
                  "cpg", "qix"]
    output_path=path_layer
    if os.path.exists(path_layer):
        if len(QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName(diff_layer)) > 0:
            lyr = QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName(diff_layer)[0]
            print('renaming layer1: ', lyr.id())
            QgsProject.instance().removeMapLayer(lyr.id())

        QgsVectorFileWriter.deleteShapeFile(path_layer)

Often some handles still remains and I'm not able to delete .dbf and .shp
files
How can I solve this error?

Thanks

Hi,

Are you on Windows ?

It's long-standing issue on Windows IIRC :
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/365713/deleting-shapefile-python-lock-qgis-3-10
or other links.

Maybe
 lyr = QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName(diff_layer)[0]
QgsProject.instance().removeMapLayer(lyr.id())
lyr = None
del lyr

But not a real answer ...

FYI, a nice helper to know side car files:

Hi Dolf,

I hope others can confirm/falsify, but I do not think you can do parallel painting, as QGIS has just one MapCanvas, and for what I know QGIS first paints the map on that MapCanvas (given your layers, styles, temporal filter etc etc), and then 'just' creates an image from that?
But maybe I'm wrong in this.

Slow (as in Hours?) that would be a huge map or very complex styling, OR a lot of timesteps/frames?
Also: how does QGIS itself render your map if you step through it using the temporal controller? Can you maybe set (spatial/temporal) indexes on your data?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <PA4P190MB1166CEDE79B06F199FB0CFEC8F3C9@PA4P190MB1166.EURP190.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear devs,

Since 3.24.0, I have few crashes without any stack trace, just "Windows fatal exception: access violation" like this :
[cid:f8a2c23f-03e6-43d8-8813-b26bbb804eb3]

I cant' determine a patern to reproduce the issue... It happens earlier today randomly, here it was when I closed QGIS.

I think it's Master and 3.24 only, I don't have any crash like this on 3.22.

Any thought ?
And should I create a GH issue ? (but as I said, I don't know how to reproduce the crash).

Similar but reproductible issue : https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/47409

Regards,
Nicolas

Windows 10 or 11?

have you tried with a new QGIS profile and no 3rd party plugins installed?

No I didn't try as I can't work properly with a fresh profile and no plugin and it's not a reproductible issue otherwise I would have try with a fresh profile ?.

I fresh install few days ago and wipe all profiles to recreate a clean new one (with plugins).


But those access violation are new. It didn't happen on 3.22 even with a messy profile

Hi

Try disabling all the plugins and then sequentially enabling them on by one
to try to isolate the offending plugin (if it is one of them).

Hi

If you want to try some python, you could make a variant of this (1) to
export in parallel (thanks Nyall for most of the key rendering logic
there). Note teh complete plugin shown there is not functional yet, and you
would need to adapt it to temporal based rendering.

Hi Tim,

You should show off here, what you make with it!   :-)

But I'm wondering now: IS this actually parallel rendering? As in those Tasks behave as a sort MapCanvasRenderings? So you are not limited by the single QGIS MapCanvas?

Files pulled to repo only (sometimes) show a last translator and a small
list of translators (no idea how they build it, the worst part being
Richard and myself listed as translators of languages we do not speak just
because we pulled/pushed translations in QGIS-Docs repo [0]). IMHO it's not
fair/respectful to the project translators.

Umm, its mostly half - baked still but you can find some examples in my
twitter feed e.g.

Well even in QGIS main window you can have many canvases (but they all
share the same layers) e.g.press Ctrl-M a couple of times.  Yes I
believe in my code example it should be parallel rendering - but Nyall or
others may want to add to the story of how the internals are working
here....

Tim

Hi,

I want to compile QGIS-LTR, so I downloaded the new OSGeo4W Installer for 
64 Bit. 
Now there is an new directory osgeo4w and not like before osgeo4w64 when I 
compiled it for QGIS 3.16.

While executing configonly.bat I get errors, i.e. gdal-dev is not found. I 
try to install it with osgeo4w but there will be no subfolder 
C:\OSGeo4W\apps\gdal-dev like before in osgeo4w64.

Is the OSgeo4W Installer the problem or maybe is the configonly.bat not 
actual?
The file is from April 2019.

Hi Guys,

I'm trying to top-up credits for QGIS training course. It doesn't seem to
update the ?0 to correspond with the amount of credits you'd like to update
with and the pay with stipe seems to be disabled also.
Not sure is this happening for others but just flagging it in case it is.

Cheers
