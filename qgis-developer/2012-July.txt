Please consider campaigning to raise some funding if necessary; you can start by
adding the project and an estimate to:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Sharing_QGIS_development_costs
BTW, I think we should raise the visibility of that page).
You can count on me for assistance if necessary.
All the best.

It is interesting, as it identifies potential problems in WFS downloading by QGIS,
worth exploring. Thanks Giovanni Manghi for digging this out.

Good news, it installs smoothly also on Debian unstable.

It has a number of strange dependencies, though:
  blcr-dkms{a} blcr-util{a} dkms{a} hwloc-nox{a} libcr-dev{a} libcr0{a} libhwloc5{a}
libmpich2-3{a} libmpich2-dev{a} libnuma1{a} linux-headers-3.2.0-3-amd64{a}
linux-headers-3.2.0-3-common{a} linux-headers-amd64{a} linux-kbuild-3.2{a}

I suspect some of these can be avoided.
All the best.

Unforunately, it has to be configured (/usr/bin), and then it does nopt work:

Any hope to have the help pages soon? Without this, it may be difficult to use.

That is odd. All dependencies (but mpich2 with mpiexec) are picked up by
dh_shlibdeps automatically and according to build log [1] those don't look
bad.

Depends: mpich2, libc6 (>= 2.4), libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1), libmpich2-3,
libstdc++6 (>= 4.4.0)

Meanwhile I'd suggest to rebuild package from the source one using apt-src
[2] or something [3]. I'll see later what might be wrong.

You might need to update sextante_taudem . AFAIK it should accept empty
paths now.

While I agree that it is nice to have a help, nevertheless PDF on official
web site [3] is quite helpful. IRC there is no documentation available in a
format suitable for conversion. So one has to write at least a brief usage
which probably won't be soon :-)

I confirm it looks okay in Ubuntu. Something is not quite right when
installing it into Debian.

As it turned out , TauDEM 5.2 expects a folder and not a path name as an
input. This essentially screws pretty much everything. So I'll roll it
back to 5.0.6 .

do you have on your machine the packages I mentioned?

have you contacted debian-gis for the possible inclusion of the package upstream?

Please ask Victor Olaya and Camilo Polymeris: they dealt with similar problems for
other backends, and can come out with a clever solution (e.g. parsing the original
help pages and adding to the plugin).
Of course, even better if the changes could be pushed upstream, and help TauDEM devs
to produce proper help pages. This has been successful for SAGA.

Thanks a lot.

Isn't it better to take this into account and change the plugin accordingly?

As I say, work already in progress and hope soon we'll have nice help
for all TauDEM tools.

	hub.qgis.org
Message-ID: <CAA6k8-JbppFbAdN3tdWGS5EdcDgq-Caeb3kHdmSVPbc1Ozk-xg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've set up a code repository on hub.qgis.org for a plugin I'm
working on, but I'm unable to push the code to the remote repo.

The plugin identifier on hub is "gem-mt".

Here's the error message I get:
<pre>
~/projects/gem_mt$ git push origin master
ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
</pre>

It's not the first plugin I move to hub, so I'm sure that I've made
all the correct setup except for one thing, I tried to push the code
without granting me Developer permissions.

But after adding Developer role to my user in the Member tab
I still get the same error, perhaps it was cached somewhere.

I've dropped and re-created the local repository, but the issue
persists and there's no way to drop the remote repository from
the hub.qgis.org site.

Any idea on how to achieve it?
Regards.

I have all but amd and linux kernel 3.2 related. So I guess these are Ubuntu
specific and picked up by ppa building system.

Not yet for a couple of reasons.

* I'm not quite certain how we handle different versions of TauDEM.

Shall each version package provide taudem and conflict with each other
or shall alternatives be used and allow installation of all versions at
once with version specific postfixes (e.g., /usr/bin/pitremove.506 and
/usr/bin/pitremove.52)? 

While alternatives provide a mechanism for keeping one main selection
via symbolic links, I'm not sure how to make use of different versions
from sextante plugin. Perhaps Alexander has some idea. It would be a
pain to name a path to each individual tool.  If postfixes are used,
then we have a trouble on Windows as mass-rename is needed. I guess the
use of alternatives with symlinks pointing to /usr/lib/taudem-5.2/ and
/usr/lib/taudem-5.0.6/ or alike would be the best as it would allow to
choose a path and this implementation would fit well on Windows.

I may be wrong but there seems to be no algorithmic difference between
those versions while batch processing is already implemented in sextante.
It would be just unnecessary steps to set up individual folders for
TauDEM 5.2 not to work on other files by accident.

* Another reason is that I'm not sure I can be a maintainer in a long
  run. But it definitely worth giving a try to set things up once design
  decisions settle.

Hi all,

further notes:

- It's not due to the ssh public key, I'm able to push to the other
repos on hub.

- I executed "git push origin master" without any initial commit
(empty git repo) because I copied/pasted the code on the Repository
section.
BTW now I've some commits but the problem persists.

- I deleted the local git repository (2 times) to be sure it doesn't
depend on mess in the local repo.

Perhaps deleting the git repo from the server could fix the
problem, but I don't know if it's feasible.

Does anybody know how to make it working?

Thanks a lot.
Regards.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin dev - save to ogr vector file
Message-ID: <CAK4yQTn0TVMtUBP+14ZYBoi62UGeJc_fLrfQ9EmFYLUsMSvYFA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am brand new to QGIS (having got here from my work with OpenStreetMap) so
apologies if I am posting this in the wrong place. What I am trying to do
is adapt the fTools plugin so that it can save to any ogr verctor file
format. The reason behind this is that I found the ESRI shapefile format to
be restrictive (e.g. attribute values are limited to 254 chars - 80 in
QGIS??).

So far Carson has kindly pointed me in the direction of the QGIS repo and I
have exposed the other ogr formats in the save file dialog. This is where I
get stuck. I can call QgsEncodingFileDialog().selectedNameFilter() to get
the file name format however this is not compatible with the way
QgsVectorFileWriter() works. The file writer requires the "driver name" as
a format (e.g. ESRI Shapefile) whereas selectedNameFilter() returns the
hard coded name in the save dialogues drop down box (e.g. ESRI Shapefiles
[OGR] (*.shp *.SHP) ).

Q: Is there an easy way to get just the driver name?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

FYI I have looked at gdal tools. They set up a dictionary to be able to
lookup any "LONGNAME" and return the driver name (SHORTNAME). The longnames
are hard coded in the plugin and represent the QGIS save dialogues drop
down format names (with the [OGR] and bracketed file extensions cut). The
shortnames are the driver names from ogr. This code can be seen here:

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/master/entry/python/plugins/GdalTools/tools/GdalTools_utils.py#L562

Although this should work, it would seem odd to have this hard coding in
every plugin that wants to write to any ogr format!!

Any ideas appreciated

Regards,
Rob

Maybe a problem of permissions ?
Have a look here [1] and [2]

Hope this helps!

that would be a very welcome addition, thanks. please note that fTools are now
incorporated also in Sextante plugin. The plugin also saves by default in shp, but
users can select other formats as well.
could this solve your problem?
all the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GGL2 plugin (beta) released
Message-ID: <CAGVwcX6RU0DJo1je=pHL+6rFh47D+t-JU11xn1qDFzpEeT1-LA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We have released the first version of the GGL2 plugin for Qgis [1]. It is
an ongoing development so you should use it with caution. With this plugin
you can use the Qgis layers as data in your GGL2 code as well as show the
results back in Qgis.

You can find more information in the documentation website [2]. There is no
"Qgis Plugin" section in the documentation yet, but the behavior is almost
the same as in gvSIG, so you can use that section.

Finally, there are some videos [3][4] that may be useful to see the main
plugin functionalities. These videos use gvSIG, but as I said earlier, the
Qgis plugin is quite similar so far. We hope you can use the plugin without
problems and get the most of the new GGL2-Qgis connection. Any bug report,
suggestion, whatever, is more than welcome.

Regards,
V?ctor.

Hi Noli,

What is actually platform dependent is GGL2 itself, the separate
application that connects with Qgis. I'm afraid we haven't released a GGL2
version for Mac OS X so far, but maybe we should consider it for future
versions.

Sounds like this solves my problem.:-)

Is it worth spending a few moments to bring qgis online documentation up to
date?  I struggled to find the info I needed :-(

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qbrowser in other language
Message-ID: <4FF40DA1.1070304@duif.net>

Hi List,

one of our translators asked me about the tranlated version of qbrowser.

While in the tsfiles I see the strings (and they are translated) I do 
not see a way to start qbrowser with a --lang flag or something.

So question: is there a way to have a translated qbrowser?

Mmm, looking into the code of browser/main.cpp it looks to me as if the 
'use translation' part is commented out?
Am I right?

It would be good if we could save the result of a fTools operation to a
memory layer so you don't have to always write to the disk.  You can always
save to ogr layer from the Save as... After that too

Hello,

Following the QGIS Mobile workshop in Berne for the Swiss QGIS user meeting, 
we found a bug in the offline plugin.

I would like to create a bug report. I have no idea where : Quantum GIS Deskop 
or User plugin (which doesn't list the offline plugin).

Thanks,

Quantum GIS Deskop is the right place for a ticket (the plugin is a C++ one that comes directly with the installation).

Hi all.
What is the usefulness of r.colors GRASS module in Sextante?
Applying a GRASS color table to a non-GRASS raster seems pointless, and I do not see
any practical consequence.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] the right way to make qgis-web-client work on
	Windows?
Message-ID: <1341431151.2420.32.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

I have the need to make the qgis-web-client work on Windows (sigh!) and
I somehow managed to do it, but it doesn't seem the right way to me.

No problems with qgis server, just installed with osgeo4w and then
edited https_qgis.conf as described in the wiki.

QGIS server is then accessible trough

localhost/qgis/qgis_mapserv.fcgi.exe

and it works just fine.


Then I try to make the web client work the same way I do on Linux, by
editing GlobalOptions.js and changing 

var serverAndCGI = "http://localhost/qgis/qgis_mapserv.fcgi.exe";

to make it point where qgis server is working

But on Windows doesn't work and in access.log I can see that apache
rewrites the URL in the wrong way

127.0.0.1 - - [03/Jul/2012:19:56:44 +0100]
"GET /qgis/qgis_mapserv.fcgi.exe-web-client/site/qgiswebclient.html?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3&REQUEST=GetCapabilities&_dc=1341341804745&service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities HTTP/1.1" 404 259

on the other hand if I set

var serverAndCGI = "http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi";

as it is under Linux, then the rewrite looks ok, but it doesn't
obviously work on Windows

127.0.0.1 - - [03/Jul/2012:19:52:55 +0100]
"GET /cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=C:/OSGeo4W/apache/htdocs/qgis-web-client/projects/helloworld.qgs&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3&REQUEST=GetCapabilities&_dc=1341341575105&service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities HTTP/1.1" 404 223



I then found the following solution that works, but doesn't seem quite
right:

in httpd.conf changed

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "C:\OSGeo4W/bin/"

to
	
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "C:\OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/bin/"

and then removed the "exe" extension from "qgis_mapserv.fcgi.exe" inside
"C:\OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/bin/".


What is the right way to do that?

cheers

	plugin now available
Message-ID: <CALCNqkYscvXqpM1+Y4m94xPuwPM4nZYJsBNPtcAGafDhs7CcCg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Users and developers

We are pleased to announce a new plugin called InaSAFE, available in
the 'new' QGIS repository. INDONESIA SCENARIO ASSESSMENT FOR
EMERGENCIES (InaSAFE) is free software that produces realistic natural
hazard impact scenarios for better planning, preparedness and response
activities. The software is currently being developed in Indonesia
however it can be tailored for any location that is interested in
hazard impact scenario development.

InaSAFE has detailed documentation, which you can find on the home
page here: http://inasafe.org

InaSAFE is released under the GPL 3 license and is completely open
source - you can download the source, file issues and join our
community here:

https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe

InaSAFE was conceived and initially developed by the Indonesia's
National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) and the Australia Agency
for International Development, through the Australia-Indonesia
Facility for Disaster reduction, the World Bank and the Global
Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery.

Regards

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg8=01Je1rfJpqycMOvu+xU6jA3nO=obznS1L2fvNt+s+w@mail.gmail.com>

Just been playing with the new grid decoration.  Pretty cool.

Just wondering what a use case for it is?  I have never really seen
the need to create a grid like that on any maps I have worked on.  In
the composer I have but never in the map canvas.

P.S Not bashing the new feature, just generally interested in use cases.

A first use I see for it is to have a better idea of scale and easily
see the extents and distances.

When I first started using QGis I thought that that an easy way ti
have a grid on the canvas was missing.

I started this thread a few months ago and decided to implement it as
a decoration. I also refactored the decorations with a base class.

http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/show-grid-on-map-canvas-similiar-to-grid-used-in-composer-strategy-td4964055.html

Before implementing this feature the only way to draw a grid was to
use the ftools "vector grid" tool which is cool but a little clumsy
(have to save a shape file) and has some performance issues with
high-resolution grids (esp. when saving as polygons).

My initial motivation was to be able to make a grid from a raster
(which was created by rasterization of a polygon vector layer), to see
if things lined up correctly.

John Donovan is working on a more flexible plugin to draw complex
grids - see the above thread also

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xSO1ALkDx7RZYLzRxpM1ZwofOQtWAQ3k3JOjYC-pEWsA@mail.gmail.com>

Vincent highlighted a hack in the composer PDF rendering (made by Marco)
[1].
I was trying to reproduce it in Python, to test if it can solve some
problems in the Atlas plugin.
I thought I could use the QPrinter.setEngines() method [2], to set an
instance of a derived QPaintEngine intitated with the flags provided in the
hack, but this method makes QGis crash. I was doing something like this
(excerpt):

paintE = self.getHackedPaintEngine
printE = printer.printEngine()
printer.setEngines(printE,paintE)

def getHackedPaintEngine(self):
        class HackEngine(QPaintEngine):
            def __init__(self):
                QPaintEngine.__init__(self,
                    QPaintEngine.PrimitiveTransform
                  | QPaintEngine.PixmapTransform
                  | QPaintEngine.PatternBrush
                  | QPaintEngine.AlphaBlend
                  | QPaintEngine.PainterPaths
                  | QPaintEngine.Antialiasing
                  | QPaintEngine.BrushStroke
                  | QPaintEngine.ConstantOpacity
                  | QPaintEngine.MaskedBrush
                  | QPaintEngine.BlendModes
                  | QPaintEngine.RasterOpModes
                )

return HackEngine()

What alternative way would you suggest to reproduce the hack?

I fear it isn't possible (at least with common programming skills!) to
reproduce it.
My approach was too naive. The paintEngine instance is a pointer to a
subclass implementation, and AFACS there's no method to change the flags
(render features) of an instanciated engine...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Save dialog for plugin development
Message-ID: <CAK4yQTmcSQkGvdY_5E5K8vBGBki0MrvguiCFTPB+AmKV1-e_3w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,

Just wondering if anyone has had any thoughts re my earlier question. To
recap I am trying to edit the fTools plugin so that you can save to any ogr
format. I have found QgsEncodingFileDialog().selectedNameFilter() which
returns the file name format however this is not compatible with the way
QgsVectorFileWriter() works. The file writer requires the "driver name" as
a format (e.g. ESRI Shapefile) whereas selectedNameFilter() returns the
hard coded name in the save dialogues drop down box (e.g. ESRI Shapefiles
[OGR] (*.shp *.SHP) ).

My question was: Is there an easy way to get just the driver name. I noted
that gdal tools have a hard coded look up table. If this is the only way
then can i suggest we bring such a table into the core so that all plugins
can make use of it. Alternatively we switch to write to a memory layer -
however I do not know how to do this...

On an related note: Sextante includes ftools - is this by link or has the
ftools code been moved into part of sextante? How does this effect
development of ftools?

Thanks,
Rob

you're right, GdalTools has a map containing all the drivers
informations, it gets everything from the gdal module but that
part was developed about 2 years ago as workaround for some
old QGis bugs.

Have a look at QgsVectorFileWriter static methods,
supportedFiltersAndFormats() [1] should be the one you need.

Fantastic. I'll take a better look next week and will see if I can forward
a patch to get one of fTools functions writing to any ogr format.

If the qgis team are happy with this I will look at the other functions in
ftools. Probably best to use git for that so may need a quick heads up on
how to use just the ftools folder of qgis git repository.

Also would be nice to know what tools people use for python (e.g. IDEs
etc). I'm new and so far most of my python work has been small but with
something like ftools it is tricky to follow over several .py files.

Rob

Hi all,

Someone wrote me he has problem while installing QGIS 1.8 (some dll 
problem LIBEAY32.dll)

I wanted to suggest him to try the osgeo installer, but I see it is 
written version 1.7.

Is this true, there is no 1.8 in the osgeo installer?

Also, why is the standalone preferred to the osgeo?

Thanks

Denis

about QGIS training courses at the National Institute of Rural Development
(NIRD), Jaipur Centre, India. They are fully sponsored by NIRD and
participants only need to pay for their travel expenses. 

Author is Harish K Solanki. He is assistant professor at NIRD Jaipur centre,
coordinating GIS and Watershed related trainings.

You find the case study here:

I use mainly pydev under aptana or under eclipse or Eric4.

As Etienne says, I'm working on the grid overlay plugin which can be
found at his github repo: https://github.com/etiennesky/gridoverlay

My motivation is for the collection of archaeological geophysics data,
mostly resistivity and magnetometry. This data is usually collected in
a regular but arbitrary grid, so a grid overlay is ideal for
referencing large surveys.

It's in a working state, and fairly bug-free, so feel free to download
it and have a go. It supports OTF projection, so you can create a grid
in one projection and display it in another. I'm open to suggestions
for features and improvements if it becomes popular.

If you do a search through the last 2 months on the qgis-user mailing list this error has come up quite a few times, with a number of suggested solutions.

The osgeo installer should understand qgis = 1.8 and qgis-dev = master. Make sure it's getting a new list of packages off the net, and not looking at existing downloaded ones.

My understanding is that it isn't.
It is "recommended for new users" because the installer behaves in the usual windows manner. The osgeo installer behaves quite differently to that.

Indeed I would think that the 'stand alone' installer is only for very 
new (windows) users who want to get their feet wet with QGIS. The 
OSGEO4W installer has some peculiarities, but actually creates a much 
better environment/experience I would say.

To encourage QGIS users to use OSGEO4W installer instead we posted an 
osgeo4w story recently (dutch/english and you are free to sent me a 
translation or other input):

http://www.qgis.nl/2012/06/20/qgis-installeren-via-osgeo4w/?lang=en

I was hoping this is usefull for fresh Windows QGIS users :-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Clarifying access to non geographical datas
Message-ID: <1341585080805-4986567.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, i would like to have your feedbacks on that point, before asking new
features.  

After some QGIS initiation courses, it clearly appeared to me that GUI
readability to access to attribute data should be improved. 

In this redmine ticket,  http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3631 #3631 , one asked
to allow 'add delimited text' plugin to add non geographic data. I do agree
with that need since newcoming users can't find by themselmves that the "Add
vector layer" also serves csv  data without geometry. It also is confusing
that QGis Browser shows a polygon vector layer on csv file since OGR doesn't
allow to choose geometric field. 

New spreadsheetformats are now also supported like XLS , ODS.. and so on. 
For us, it is really important since it was one of the most uses
functionnalities in Mapinfo, and one that still prevent us to uninstall it. 

IMHO, the import dialog present in "add delimited text plugin" is really
clear, and deserves to be extended to other non typed datasources:

    -Sample view is really a time saving feature to check if everything goes
well. I really think that would be useful for xls and ODS too. (check
enconding, check if formulas are well imported, check import area) 
 
    - *User should be able to import csv* or spreadsheet format without
geographical fields (use with table joins)
   - All csv or spreadsheet format do no control data types so it would be
necessary to *allow user to  choose* data types for each fields  (like
access or OOo does). 
   - For excel and ods, it would be nice *to allow to change import area*
(A1 - B52 ofr example) like Mapinfo does. 
   - Dialog to choose file encoding is missing also

All those requirement could be one "Add attribute data" button and dialog,
more readable than a plugin icon or a csv file filter in OGR. It should also
be plugged after OGR access to csv, either from "add vector layer" or from
Browser. 

What do you think of that? 

PS: Another option would be to rethink the whole "manage Layers toolbar"
because it starts to be crowded (vector, raster, 3 databases , 3 OGC).
Netbook and touchpad user would probably like more unified access? (like in
Mapinfo or Arcgis? )

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Use relative path for SVG icon in new symbology
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6fcAOf-=kS37L_v-UxuegjpaaH3_75U11vkc0XcAZbSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have just tested the new feature in Qgis symbology wich lets the user
choose a SVG file directly in the "Symbol property" dialog. It works well,
but the absolute path is stored in the project file, even if "relative" is
set in the project options.

I tried to manually modify the project qgs file and replaced the absolute
path of the SVG by a relative, and then reopen the project in Qgis, and it
worked well (my svg is correctly used for rendering). So basically we just
need to modify Qgis to replace absolute path for SVG into relative ones. Is
anyone working on it ? If no, I could try to locate the right file to
modify and propose a patch.

It would be nice to ship all the SVG with the project and spatial data when
using Qgis Server.

Hi all, 
I searched a while without any result. 
Did anyone ever asked for expression based styling ? 
Nathan's expression evaluator instead of fields list in  category, graduated 
and ruled based styling would be brilliant. 
 Mapinfo does it and I use it a lot. 
Anyone interested? Anyone already on it maybe?

I and many others in bandwidth poor societies prefer the standalone
installer as it is a 'download once,  install many times *easily*'
solution. The last time we checked the download stats were skewed
heavily in favour of the standalone installer (somewhere in teh order
of 100:1 in favour of it IIRC).

Can we finally kick off the logo competition? 

I think it would be great to have it ready a while before 2.0 release so we
can prepare new material where needed.

Can we finally kick off the logo competition? 

I think it would be great to have it ready a while before 2.0 release so we
can prepare new material where needed. 

Best wishes,
Anita

Yep I think it would be good.  I can write a blog post asking for some
funds, if you want to do the same.

Well I have someone who is willing to throw in 200. I'll check that he is
still ok with that.  The more money the better the result hopefully.

Are we going to use a site like http://www.crowdspring.com/ to get
designs and possibly community vote?

It worked well for FOSS4g Denver. Also gives you a sense of what people
usually pay for a pro logo design.

Thanks,
Alex

We wouldn't be changing the logo more just revamping it, and giving it
a face lift.

This is the site that I had in mind http://99designs.com/logo-design
but any of those kinds of sites will do.   I'm happy to go with the
one you already know works well.

What about submissions from the QGIS community? Would those of us who
have some design background be able to submit a few compositions for
the logo, or would we have to become a member of the site chosen for
the competition and only work within that framework?

I believe those sites are generally open to anyone to compete, but yes
it does require registration since they give money to the winners. I
would say we should pick such a site that does allow anyone to register
and enter the competition so that the regular QGIS community is part of
the competition.

In terms of framework, I think the requirements are going to be the same
all around. Inkscape or regular svg files, no proprietary fonts, example
output pngs at small, medium and large sizes (need to look up what most
systems expect these days).

Either site works for me, the crowdspring is the one they used for
Foss4g Denver and thats the only reason I know about it.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi R?gis,

Can you please elaborate how this relates to the rule-based rendering we
already have in QGIS?

Thank you for describing the difference!

Hi Andreas, 
maybe I missed something, please tell me. 

This is how I see the matter: 
Rule based styling allows to create rules based on *existing* fields with
SQL queries, but, *Refine assistants only have access to existing fields*.
Once refined rules on single or multiple fields are created, you then have
the possibility to use expression evaluator to modify each rule, reorder,
one after each other. This is awesome for many use cases, but not for thoses
ones :

* Example 1:classify and normalize numeric data*  You want to apply a sqrt
function on a numeric field and classify it with graduate value. Having the
expression builder accessible instead of fields list allows it directly. 
Mapinfo allows you to classify a expression (sqrt(myfield)/max(myfield) *
100 for example).  *Doing it in QGIS requires to create a new field. So the
user need to have rights on it or duplicate it.* I don't like that users
duplicate data, since I am data administrator. Modifying data for
representation purposes is bad too. 


*Example 2: Calculate advanced rotation and size fields : *I have waste
water plants to map. I want them red symbols for dysfunctionning plants and
green for the others. I want a point size varying based on size (~number of
inhabitants). If I want a correct representation, I want point size to vary
between 40 mm on screen and 0.1. With an expression instead of existing
fields, this can be easy. *I do know how to do that in postgis or
spatiallite view by myself. Common users don't *
This would be even easier with a dedicated gui to help user choose an d
preview Sqrt, exp , or Ln dynamic. 

*Example 3: generate unique values for legend labels*I need to categorize
data on a field, but with a display order (40 classes). I have a code for
classe number, and a label field.  In QGIS, I have two choices: Classify on
code and manually change labels (long and painful), or classify on label
field with ruled based labeling, and then order classes with priority order.
Long and painful too. With an expression, I could evaluate "code" || ' - '
|| "label" , and have it sorted and readable directly. Not perfect, but
fast. *This is what we need when having a meeting with authorities and only
3 hours to prepare a draft map. *

Did I miss something? I think QGIS still need some work to achieve all
cartographic representation rules (
http://www.scribd.com/doc/33408233/SUG243-Cartography-Proportional-Symbol
http://www.scribd.com/doc/33408233/SUG243-Cartography-Proportional-Symbol )

Are you interested if my organisation supports such a functionnality?

Hey R?gis,

I think that would a good feature to add. It would add a lot of power
to the rendering engines, including the rule based render. +1 from me
for adding support for this if we can.

I agree Regis, it would add a new "dimension" to the rendering engine.
+1 also from me.

Message-ID: <CAJHDHfq-4L9vL11Vm9ihKVtRd2HyHY9DmAN5f7zz9-3mHyP=0w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

As this is my first post to this list, first of all hello ;)

I'm really excited about the new version of QGIS. Working with OpenSUSE
12.1 64-bit, I upgraded from the Geo repository to 1.8.0. Now, however,
QGIS won't start. On the CL I get the following error:

qgis
Warning: loading of qgis translation failed
[/usr/share/qgis/i18n//qgis_en_US]
Warning: loading of qt translation failed
[/usr/share/qt4/translations/qt_en_US]
qgis: siplib.c:10965: sipEnumType_alloc: Assertion
`(((currentType)->td_flags & 0x0007) == 0x0003)' failed.
Aborted

The splash screen pops up briefly but dies as soon as the process is
aborted. I'm also not able to find the library in question - does anybody
know of a way of fixing this? Thanks a bunch!

Daniel

Message-ID: <CADs9uc8mEZvdPpar_4Tp8X+qEw5-L-3RDdh7h20wZ4gOGN5=JA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I think it would be good to compile Compiling QGIS with iODB
driver/library for Mac OS X and Linux

QGIS 1.8.0 has support for MSSQL but it would not work in MacOS X and
Linux with Qt odbc driver (i.e. iodbc) included.

iODBC is working fine in Mac OS X and Linux.

Here's the github:
https://github.com/openlink/iODBC

http://www.iodbc.org/dataspace/iodbc/wiki/iODBC/

Here is recent problem using MSSQL with QGIS 1.8.0 in Mac OS X.

http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/QGIS-MSSQL-2008-Data-import-problem-td4986449.html

Any instruction how to compile QGIS 1.8.x or master with iODBC?

Would this work with QGIS source code?

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-iodbc-inidir=/etc
	...
	...
	...
	$ make
	...

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_oUQT5im5O7gNzByrRDO7OaU2NYiQVPkwb368wkY0pwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working on a fairly detailed map for print output at a known scale
(1:24000 @ 300 dpi, 1.2 m x 2.4 m). I'm using the new label engine,
and manually adjusting many of the labels for x/y and rotation. Labels
are in map units, with parallel-to-line feature layout.

Is there a means to have PAL layout the labels, then do something to
freeze (write) *all* labels' x/y coords to the data source?

Currently, I have to manually move a label to have its coords written.
If there was a method to freeze all the labels' coords for a given
layer, it would be a LOT faster to pan around at the print output
scale and visually check for collisions to manually adjust, since
those labels would no longer dynamically move relative to the viewport
extent.

I'd be interested in hearing about any workarounds or a reasonable
approach for adding the feature to the source, or if I'm totally
missing something here. I envision the freeze feature as an action
attached to a new icon on the labeling toolbar, since it is already
limited as to when it becomes enabled (when there is a properly set up
data source).

Hi Larry,

it is known issue. If you want to have the label automatically rotated
using a data defined value I think you will need to use the old
labelling engine.

Try wiping out any old qgis library file.
`sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/qgis` worked for me.
Please let us know if it fixes your issue.

If it does, it's the most annoying QGIS bug IMHO. It's been in QGIS for
so long that you may spot it in slippers reading a newspaper on the couch.

Is there any reason why would one want to use the 'GIS' theme other than
personal preference ?

Like, is it shared across multiple applications, improving "consistency"
of desktop look&feel ?

As far as I can see (and already wrote in my email) GRASS is using the
GIS Icon Theme in in their wxwindows GUI ..
So .. It's just one application so far using it as default ..
But as I think GRASS and QGIS are used together a lot it would make it
easier for users to recognise the icons.
I am sure there will be a lot of complaints in the begining (people
don't like anything changed when it comes to visual things) but on the
long term (and when other opensource GIS would also use this icons) it
would make a much more consistent feeling across all GIS (but you are
right for now it would only be GRASS and QGIS).

Said that I also like Roberts icons much more than the defaults now
(looking a lot clearer and technical) and beside that I think Roberts
work should be shown to the world as he is investing a lot of time for
a more consistent look.

I hope that other GIS would jump on this train too

kind regards
Werner

hm, are you referring to Robert's icon theme? Well this is really
personal taste, and I would hesitate to use "ugly" in this regard
(even my vocabulary is also limited). Feel free to design your icon
set which will be less "ugly" for you. Good luck! Probably I am not
used from the GRASS community to read such strong words.

Hi there,

I also think the GRASS theme is great, although I have to say that I'm a
long-time GRASS user. I've often heard complaints about QGIS' icon set,
especially in Windows - people feel that it looks a bit unserious, although
I don't see it that way. However, I do see great advantages in
consolidating the use of FOSS GIS to these to main overarching packages -
it's great to have lots of products but we're a specialized, rather small
community and it's good when people don't invest their time in reinventing
the wheel. In that sense, I would support style unification across QGIS and
GRASS - it would make it easier to jump back and forth and perhaps
encourage the use of the GRASS plugin more.

Best,
Daniel

Hi there,

Since I'm using the binary from the repository, I wasn't sure what exactly
I should wipe out - I don't have anything in /usr/local/lib/ except for a
python folder. Instead, I deinstalled QGIS completely using my package
manager. As far as I understand it, that should wipe out my system pckages,
wherever they are, and that without deleting my plugins. I tried that but
got the same problem again. Afterwards, I deleted the .qgis folder in my
home directory, but that didn't change anything either. Perhaps I've
understood you wrong? Did I do that right?

Thanks,
Daniel

it's not a "GRASS theme". wxGUI just uses part of icons from [1] which
was designed by Robert Szczepanek as a generic GIS-related icon set
(AFAIU).

Am I the only one finding the new QGIS theme icon so ugly (sorry if the

I agree that the current solution is not ideal.  I did some mockups of
an idea I had during the last hackfest.  Which can be found here[0]
and here[1].  It would unify all the open logic into a single dialog
and save space on the tool bar.

Hi!

Well I won't say "ugly" in any way - even if I would not like them.
I guess Yves would not have taken such a word but he explained it that
his vocabulary is limited.

Of course it is personal preference for everyone - surely. But as
Robert tries to unify the icons for all GIS I am strongly in favour of
using it in QGIS as default too. Most Users even don't know that there
are other icon sets available.
Why not taking the advantage of giving the user the same icon for the
same function in all Open Source GIS?
I think after a short while of complaining (not finding the new
function (althoug it is still at the same place), looking bad .. and
such things) people will find out what benefit that would bring to
(for now) GRASS and QGIS ..

But as there is already a poll going on .. just vote .. and express
your meaning ..

http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=4ffb5dfae4b08ad9dfac3f70

kind regards
Werner

I think the set being under OSGEO wings is a very good motivation
to switch over.  http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Graphics

Hey, there's also a trac instance, to file issues ! 

For example, I find the "zoom-refresh" button weird in that I don't see
how "refresh" has to do with "zoom". Is it only me ? Worth filing a
ticket for that ?

	break
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg9U3FAOLNJa6-Emb-+q57tk2UMmVnWusPDUAjR-3_+rFA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

This is a just a quick email to let everyone know that I have changed
the way that arguments are passed to a layers Init Python function.
That is the option that you find in the Layer Properties dialog on the
General tab. If you are using this then this will affect you and you
will know what I'm talking about.

I have changed it so that the reference to the layer and feature are
now passed into the function rather then just ids.  The issue with
just passing the feature id was that you couldn't get access to the
new feature and geometry because you were given a 0 as the id and 0 is
a valid id for already existing feature.

So now instead of this:

def myFunction(dialog, layer_id, feature_id)

where layer_id and feature_id are integers.  You now do this:

def myFunction(dialog, layer, feature)

layer is a instance of QgsVectorLayer
feature is a instance of QgsFeature

You can now do things like:

def myFunction(dialog, layer, feature):
      id = layer.id()
      name = layer.name()
      geom = feature.geometry()
      geom.length()
      # etc

This change will break your custom form logic if your code is
expecting a interger for the feature argument but you get a QgsFeature

Just a FYI so you don't freak out when you form logic doesn't work anymore.

 Hi Nathan,

 This makes sense to me. I will have to adapt my code but it is more 
 convenient and powerful now.

 Thanks a lot,

Hi Nathan,
You're my hero !
I dream of a unified single ?Add data? button / menu entry at night ! Users 
don't care about ?add shapefile? ?add raster? ?add anotherformatentry?. They 
just want to add data to the map. Let's rationalize all that.

The design you propose seems really nice. Reusing the browser is a really good 
idea.
Let's do it !

I really like your unified GUI Nathan!  Nice.. 
I would just add a small place for csv data overview (popup window?) and
character encoding listbox. 

Anoter idea: An option to display all files (*.*) in folders would be nice
too. For example, there is no filter today to access xls datas, but gdal
already serves it. We still need a way to access physical files for such
cases. Thoughts?

Yeah I think having a show all files would be a good option.   My main
goal for the dialog is to do a way with as much of the filesystem feel
as possible (but not removing it completely) because IMO there is has
always been this divide in GIS software with the file system on one
side, which people are comfortable with and understand (to some
extent); and then there is the "other stuff" like databases, web
services which normally you have to access a different way which makes
people uncomfortable. Why should we treat them differently?  This is
my attempt to remove some of that feel. It borrows strongly from the
QBrowser idea, in fact would be good implemented as a sub set of that.

The key difference to the QBrowser is that the tree on the left is
only the root nodes (connection nodes) not the layers like in the
browser.  Clicking on a node, or parent node, would show all the
layers in that source on the right. This means you are not scrolling
up and down to load layers from different sources.  If I expand a
folder with 100 layers in QBrowser I now can't see my other
connections at a glance, but QBrowser and my dialog mockup serve a
different purpose.

I have to express though this is only a rough mockup and there is no
code backing it, and I haven't even tried to begin working on it as it
is above my current skill level in order to do it correctly.

I thinks it's a great idea also.

Here is a simple modification (screenshot attached) which could keep
the buttons in the toolbar but merge them into one pop-up button. This
saves a lot of space and keeps existing functionality.  The icon is
not great, just a first stab.

Nathan's browser button could be placed next to that.

We tried the merge into one button idea once and lets just say it
didn't go down too well with the users :)

How long ago was that?

Now there are 10 buttons in the Layers Toolbar (8 of which are for
adding new layers) - which I think is a lot of clutter. I personally
shrink that toolbar to just a few icons.

Right I think ultimately QBrowser should be the actual "open layer"
dialog (or with just minimal differences - e.g. with management of
layers)... when we were working on it we had this use case in mind.
QBrowser itself is just a small amount of code, everything else is in
the core and providers, so that the code can be reused. The browser
tree should have an internal option not to show layers, they would be
shown separately like in windows file manager.

The unified add layer dialog has some fundamental parts solved, though
there are still various tiny things that need attention - typically
various provider-specific options - whether to list non-spatial
tables, whether to list tables not in geometry_columns, what encoding
to use when opening shapefiles, how to specify style of wms layers,
how to present wms tilesets, how to set primary key for views and so
on...

Having icons for opening layers of different kind is really useless, just 
leading the user to have to think about the format he wants to load before 
taking action. That's not a clear way of doing things, most of the time a user 
do not know nothing about data format, and even not the difference between 
raster and vector. They want to ?Add data? that's all.
So let's kill those buttons and replace them with a single ?add data? one !
My 2 cents

this is strange because the "one" button is exactly what most of other
gis software has :)

Well it wasn't one button with a dialog like what I have in mind but a
single button as a drop down menu.  So it only de-cluttered the
toolbar but didn't solve the real issue of having heaps of buttons.

For me it's not the 8 buttons but rather the 8 different dialogs that
you get, this just leads to user confusion and frustration when an
option is in one but not in the other, or the UIs are similar but
different enough to make you think. UI consistency is the one thing we
should aim for when designing this kind of stuff.

You could still have 8 buttons with my dialog they would just be
shortcuts to select that root node as active e.g. Clicking Open
PostGIS Layer would open the dialog and select the PostGIS root node,
but this is just a waste of space IMO.

But then problems await down the road, when users do not understand why 
some functionalities are sometimes possible, sometimes not possible. The 
ultimate goal would be to implement everything for all providers, of 
course, but this is a long term objective.

I like it ! I never use these icons right now, because it would mean 
going one by one over them and wait for the mouseover popup until I find 
the one I want.

I don't think QGIS has any direct linking with [i]ODBC, but would use the Qt ODBC plugin to connect with an ODBC driver.  Note that I don't include the Qt ODBC plugin in the Mac QGIS, but I could if that is supposed to work.

I run Linux Mint 10 and I can connect to my MS SQL database without
any extra work.  Just using the Qt ODBC drivers.  You have to use a
ODBC DSN but other then that it works as expected.  I might do a blog
post about it if I can get some time.

I think it would be good to include Qt ODBC plugin for QGIS for Mac OS
X, then it will probably work with iODBC and unixODBC DNS manager.

 I agree. I always hide this "Manage Layers" toolbar when I start from a 
 new QGIS installation. I use the menu instead. The toolbar wastes just 
 too much screen space in my opinion. Maybe we should hide it by default?

 I like the idea of having a drop-down button. It could be included in 
 the other toolbar called "File". It would fit in this toolbar since it 
 deals with saving, loading and file references.

 Just my two cents,
 Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Postgres provider checks queries and refuses CTE
Message-ID: <201207101710.24001.vincent.ml@oslandia.com>

Hi,
The postgres provider apparently does a check on the input query and only 
tolerates queries beginning with "SELECT".

The more general SQL query form allows for queries not beginning with select, 
but still being valid, as it is the case for CTEs. The only way to have qgis 
load them is to wrap CTEs inside a select, which is not really nice.

Example.
This won't load in qgis :

with points as (select gid, st_makepoint(random() * 10, random() * 10) as 
the_geom from generate_series(1, 100) as gid) select * from points

But this will :

select * from (with points as (select gid, st_makepoint(random() * 10, 
random() * 10) as the_geom from generate_series(1, 100) as gid) select * from 
points) as foo

This is also the case for other kind of queries like UPDATE... RETURNING, 
which should be valid but don't conform to the filter.

Is the filter useful anyway, since there are so many ways to write non-valid 
queries ?

So the question is : do we get rid of the SELECT filter in postgres provider ? 

Those in favor of keeping it raise your hands and arguments now, or I think 
we'd better drop it...

the so called "SELECT statement to vector layer" [1] was
implemented in PG and SL providers respectively from Qgis 1.5
and QGis 1.6. The pattern for queries is "(SELECT ... )".

> Is the filter useful anyway, since there are so many ways to write non-valid

I added that check to be sure the query can be used as subquery,
but it make no sense for PG as the other statements can return a
result as well.

+1 to drop it.

I'm not sure the same has to be done for SL provider, although
it's better to make them uniform.

For me it makes no sense to have the dropdown - you need to do two
clicks to use an icon so we may as well just remove the manage layers
toolbar completely and let users use the menu rather (same amount of
mouse clicks plus bigger and easier target to click with the mouse).

Ultimately the unified add data dialog as presented by Nathan is what
we want though.

What about "Add vector" is a single icon and which kind of vector is choosen
in a second dialog ? Could be shapefile, postgis, spatialite, grass, ....

I am compiling qGIS trunk on archlinux:

I managed to install spatialindex and spatialite from AUR and configuration
with ccmake.. goes fine.

When I run make, I get:

Under Archlinux, you have to force the use of python 2 with these options:
PYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so
PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2
PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES_DIR=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages
PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/python2.7/

If you compile for the first time, you may also get bitten by that bug:

you suggested. A rerun of make halts at the same line.

If "add table" would actually use the same dialogue as "Add Vector Layer", would it not be better just to rename that to "Add vector layer or table"?
Personally I wouldn't have expected most people to use the toolbar, but the same applies to the menu entries...

Here is the command I used to configure trunk:

cmake ../Quantum-GIS -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=ON 
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/prefix -DQWT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/qwt5 
-DQWT_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libqwt5.so -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2 
-DPYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES_DIR=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages 
-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/python2.7 -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF 



I don't remember how I arrived there and I can not test the qwt5 issue 
right now, can you try if this cmake command works for you?

Under Archlinux, you have to force the use of python 2 with these options:

PYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so

PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2

PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES_DIR=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages

PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/python2.7/



If you compile for the first time, you may also get bitten by that bug: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5620

Please do a blog on Linux Mint 10 and MS SQL database. QGIS need more
exposure to hard core MS / ArcGIS users that QGIS is capable in
connecting / using MS SQL server even in Linux and Mac OS X.

Now, I am considering dual booting Linux Mint 10 in my MacbookPro
Retina :-). I am using Ubuntu 10.10 in my (3) triple boot slow Laptop.

Thanks.

What if the add layer buttons were unified - one button that would then
give you the option of adding a shapefile, database table, directory, GRASS
map, etc.? That could consolidate and eliminate a lot of the confusion.

Indeed this is the long term goal - though it is going to take quite a
bit of work and nobody has yet volunteered to do it. Nathan has made
some nice mockups of how this would work based on discussions we had
at the Lyon hackfest.

This is his original post -
https://plus.google.com/109990125267312011029/posts/WYSNcRtsFsY -
there are more recent mockups but I can't locate them at the moment.

Regards

Tim

Better if they go through the bank account (cheaper for us), but also PP is ok.

Hi All

Marco and I have been discussing version 2.0 and wanted to bring the
discussion onto the list. In particular we are interested in:

- When is a reasonable date to aim for the release?
- What features will be part of 2.0?
- What things are we going to clean away for the release?

Here are a list of the possible things that could go into 2.0 that we
came up with:

- QgsGeometry Refactor to support arcs, measures, 3d geometries and
geometry collections (Marco is working on this though unless he is
funded to work on it it is unlikely to happen for 2.0)
- Threading branch and threaded data provider refactor (a long time
ago in GSOC project far away Martin Dobias got much of the ground work
in place but the delta between his branch and master is huge now)
- Raster refactor to use new renderer architecture, native WCS
support, pipelines, 'save as' support and more (this work is being
funded by the World Bank and will be available in master over the next
3 months)
- GSOC project for symbology UI redesign / improvements (how is this
work going?)
- GSOC project for on the fly feature generalization (also how is this going)
- Addition of Sextante into QGIS as a standard plugin (assuming that
sits well with Victor)

What else do we miss from the list? Are any others out there actively
working on features / funding features that we should be aware of?

In terms of decrufting, it would be good to remove all the duplicated items:

- twin labelling systems
- unified add layer dialogs
- twin symbology systems
- about 15 ways to generate hillshades
- too many toolbars / icons by default
- remove all deprecated calls from the API

Are there any other things that folks would like to add to the
discussion for the roadmap for version 2.0?

Regards

Agreed, removing duplicates is important, and will need a fair amount of work.
I would add twin diagrams.
As for the analytical part, I'm not so sure duplication is bad: every backend has its
strengths, and it is not uncommon to get different results with different methods, so
this is actually a way to better check your results.
Also, unified layer loading, as discussed recently, seems important.
More generally, I would think users need more polishing than new features.

All the best, and thanks for bringing this over.

Look like a pretty good list to me.

Going well and making good progress.  Once we have some more of the
important stuff cleaned up and working as expected it will be merged
into master (pending Martins approval).

For me personally I would like to see four things:

- A better way to manage composers and improvements generally to that area.
- Python support in labels and attribute table
- More then one map canvas (this would require a lot of work I am
thinking, as you also have to factor in a lot of UI reworks to handle
more then one map canvas)
-  So kind of query language (Martin and I have been talking about
something in Python but it's only a dream at the moment)

In terms of timeline for a release, not really sure.  One year feels
to short for the amount of work that needs to be done; but two years
is a long time to wait for a release.

+1 to all of these.  Having twin labelling and symbology engines is
just a bad user experience all round. Of course there is a lot of work
to be done just in removing those alone due to missing features.

That sounds good to me, and completely feasible within the dates you
are discussing. We are still rethinking the way we are going to manage
the repository, but definitely 2.0 should contain SEXTANTE included
without further configuration. I see that we have enough time to have
a stable SEXTANTE and discuss many things about it to polish the
interface and make it more useful for all QGIS users.

+1, simplifying and removing those duplicates is the most important thing.

+1 too, as soon as everything analytical stays inside sextante and may be 
disabled, no problem in having duplication.

Can't agree more on that point.
2.0 is the opportunity to disrupt, and get rid of all little glitches in the 
UI, improve the interface in terms of UX and consolidate existing features 
more than adding thousands of new things.

We are almost sure now to port Atlas plugin to C++ before october, so it will 
probably be part of QGIS 2.0.

As 2.0 is a time to break compatibility, having a more Pythonic API would 
really improve things when developing plugins.
An improved plugin builder and default plugin templates would be interesting 
too.

 Hi,

 Ok - I see that there are already too many feature requests for 2.0.

 Some of them need API/architecture breaks, some not.

 So maybe release a 1.9x in between?

 In general I would say we need a release once a year at least. If 2.0 
 takes longer to develop I would do a 1.9 release in between.

 Cleaning up all the duplicates (symbology, labeling, diagrams, etc.) 
 and working on improving the user experience could be done in a 1.9x 
 release.

I think at our current rate of development, one release every approximately 6 months
is reasonable.

Agreed.

Larry Shaffer (dakcarto on IRC) is busy with an awesome plugin IDE for
QGIS that I would love to see go into 2.0.

Hi 

It would nice to see some Postgis-topology support (loading, editing) in QGIS.

API is already broken with the raster architecture changes, so I think
we are better off releasing 2.0 sooner and with less features than
putting out a 1.9 which is not API compliant with the rest of the 1.x
series. My idea was to present (and let others add) all the ideas out
there and then pare it down to a reaslistic list. Personally I was
thinking / hoping we could do a 2.0 release by year's end.

That would be great. IMHO, the single most important thing in releasing 2.0, from an
user point of view, is to get rid of the duplications. All the rest comes second,
even if very useful.
All the best.

Lot of things have been already said, and I would put a +1 to everything.
I also think that duplication cleaning and some UI (toolbars/icons)
refactoring is very important. Many other things are unlikely to be ready
by this year...

I would underline the QgsGeometry refactoring, first of all to support 3D
and topology models. They will be more and more expected in the next GIS
siftwares.
The other area of work where there's room for improvement are the
cartographic tools (composer, first of all).

I would put Python refactoring to a lower level in the priorities list.

There will be some sponsored improvements to composer coming soon - I
will send out an announcement about the plans for this soon - probably
tomorrow.

I would like to see better color map support in rasters, by taking
advantage of existing capabilities in symbologyv2  - such as the
Gradient and ColorBrewer  Color Maps

I agree it is very important. To go further, I would love to see a 
closer integration between symbology and labelling.

The current situation has several issues, for example:
* Label is added on all features even when only some are visible on a 
categorised or rule based rendering
* Label information is saved in qml file saved from the style tab in 
properties, which is not intuitive to say the least.

This would especially bring rule-based labelling, which seems to be a 
quite popular feature (issues #3843, #4840, #5056 and #5836 at least).

If for 2.0 some groundwork is laid for a cleaner labelling and symbology 
systems, I hope it will make it possible to reuse some components in 
both parts.

As you mention, a large part of the work is the data provider 
refactoring (implementing the iterator pattern for every provider).
On the other hand, it is a task that can be parallelized. If each 
maintainer of a vector provider could implement that for his 
provider(s), that would make the whole process much easier. I'm 
available to change the WFS provider.
What do others think?

Hi all,

please don't forget the QGIS legend and its issues when keeping track of
both layer and group positions.

Since there could be too many new functionalities, what about publishing a
survey in qgis.org for prioritizing and, perhaps, postponing them for minor
2.x releases?

Focusing on too many new stuff could yield the
next-major-version-is-coming-since-several-years-ago problem that other GIS
software have experienced.

Regards,

Germ?n

Great list, it would be cool to get all this things in 2.0 (but not sure is this
possible with our limited resources)

Going quite well, but there are some performance issues with large and
complex vectors. Most time consuming operation is topology analysis.
Simplification itself is relatively fast.

A working draft code available at here

It would be nice to review current situation with providers and lots
of "add layer" buttons. Currently each provider creates own button
and panel becomes longer and longer. I remember, there are several
discussions on this topic and at least two solutions were proposed.

Another task ? make all API functions available in Python and make
Python API more Pythonic. Also, mabe move to PySide or update
to PyQt API v2 (currently QGIS uses PyQt API v1).

There is an old patch that adds tabs support to QGIS, but there is a lot
of work to be done on it.

once the list of possible features and tasks will be settled, I agree that a poll
might be useful, if we have the resources to implement what comes out.
All the best.

I wonder if a poll is of any use, the people voting will be a small 
minority of the userbase and most of them will have no idea of how much 
work a feature needs. The filtering should be based on a simple question 
: is there a dev able to deliver this feature in time ?

Yes this is definately the time for merritocracy - the people who are
going to do the work or fund the work can choose what will go into
2.0. It's pointless allowing the community at large to decide on a
list or priorities which no developer is prepared to implement. This
list should be more about providing guidance and ideas as to what the
community sees as important.

I think all the points brought up have been quite good. Obviously, there is much in the bug queue that needs to be considered for a 2.0 release. Also, a general +1 on Tim's suggestion for meritocracy with the inclusion of both active developers and funders. 

Further support on a couple things that Nathan brought up:

On Jul 11, 2012, at 4:41 AM, Nathan Woodrow wrote:

+1, will open up possibilities like showing only a single attribute from a layer when looping layers, e.g., Atlas printing of only the active feature rather than all features from the coverage layer.

I'm not aware of any straightforward solution. I have heard of some
plans to provide PyQGIS wrappers for classes responsible for (PAL)
labeling, so with your Python skills you could create a script/plugin
that would take care of freezing labels - though the API would
probably need some tweaks to allow not only draw the resulting labels,
but also fetch the label positions.

Freezing the labeling and editing of label placement were things I
wanted to do from the early times when playing with PAL, but never got
to it close enough :-)

I'm no math or C++ whiz, so helping with the intricacies of some parts
of QGIS are categorically beyond me right now. One area where I would
like to help, and would love to see finished for 2.0, is a systematic
update of the user experience to be consistent and adaptable across
platforms. I don't necessarily mean introduce new GUI ways of doing
things, but fix the current problems with consistency and implement
means of making it easier to adjust in the future.

Towards this end, I propose the following:

* A complete application-wide GUI audit with a full listing of things
needing fixed or updated on the wiki. This would be done with respects
to any current interface guidelines, which could be updated as
differing, but necessary, use cases are recognized.

Examples:

- Clean up all core GUI elements to meet current guidelines.
- Many dialog's sizes/state/column widths, etc. are not recorded/restored.
- Many form elements and dialogs do not expand or scale consistently.
- Font sizes vary drastically in some areas between platforms.
- Many long operations differ on whether they show a progress bar.
- Use of push or tool buttons for specific operations is inconsistent.
- Very few GUI elements leverage Qt's What Is? contextual help.
- Differing platform conventions need addressed where inconsistent.

* Look at implementing Qt stylesheets *sparingly* for the interface
and plugins. Many inconsistencies, especially fonts, can be handled
with the use of application-wide stylesheets specific per platform
(e.g. qgis_ubuntu.qss). Application preferences regarding style would
need to be programmatically integrated with stylesheets.

* QgisInterface could be updated to offer methods to retrieve the
current stylesheet or interface style settings. This would seriously
help plugin authors, who do not always work/test on multiple
platforms, which is one reason why many plugins lack GUI cohesion with
the main app. All plugins, or possibly only those whose parent is the
main window, could inherit the main app's stylesheet.

* Create a simple HIG GUI checklist for plugin authors to follow,
maybe with some good examples. This also could be a crosscheck used by
admins when considering plugin submissions to the plugin repository.

The focus here would be to update the app to have a consistent GUI
baseline, which follows a known set of human interface guidelines, and
to offer plugin authors the ability to effectively work with it.

Larry

This is something that has been pursuing me for ages. Porting that
stuff (sometimes essentially re-doing that) is quite a great task. In
recent months I have not be able to allocate enough free time to do it
- I have to come up with a plan how to proceed... Refactoring the
access to layer data should be really done before 2.0, otherwise we
will have to stay with what we have for further years.

Great!

As Nathan commented, the work is going well and I hope that soon we
may be able to pull some nice features to master branch (once we are
confident with their stability).

In general this means that old labeling will be disabled and new
labeling dialog will be embedded in that tab of vector layer
properties.

The old symbology can be slowly wiped out - in the first step we would
remove the switch to/from old system (and always force new symbology),
in the second step the old classes may be removed from code base one
by one.

I'm quite keen to see this happening - one row of icons as a maximum
in the default install...

As Alex noted, we will switch to PyQt API v2, that will be a small
change code-wise, but with a great impact on plugins. That will mean
that PyQt (and PyQGIS) modules will return 'unicode' type where
QString should be returned, or directly the encapsulated value will be
returned when QVariant should be returned. Since these classes are
used all over the place, there will be a need to update plugins - but
I guess the developers will like the newer, more pythonic API since it
does not require them to do casts between Qt/Python representations of
the same thing.

Then there would be deprecation of metadata in __init__.py for
plugins, but that's also nearly zero work.

Apart from that, I am still dreaming of a separation of providers
classes into 1.data source and 2.provider classes, in a similar way
how e.g. GDAL/OGR works. This would bring us various advantages -
easier sharing of connections to databases, good API for querying and
management of layers etc. But that's probably a task for v3.0 :-)

Yeah, that could help the whole transition.

A really good thing prior to refactoring would be to prepare a bunch
of tests for data access: to check that nothing is broken in the
process. Checking providers like ogr, delimitedtext, gpx or spatialite
seems relatively easy, a problem will be with databases (e.g. mssql,
sqlanywhere) that not everyone is able (or wants) to run. However
those could be temporarily disabled until their maintainers do not
find time to update to the api changes.

There is also a need to look at data access to raster layers and
evaluate how much work would it be to make raster access thread-safe.

After fixing vector and raster access thread-safety there should be
nothing blocking us to re-introduce threaded rendering, woohoo :-)

For creating hillshades/relief in a Lat/Lon CRS, the option for:
 - Terrain plugin is to use a Z-factor=111120
 - GdalTools DEM is to use Scale (ratio of vert units to  horiz.)=111120

More so GdalTools DEM is also using Z-Factor for vertical exaggeration.

This is very confusing for newbies.

Giovanni,

would you volunteer for creating a list of missing features in both
new symbology and labeling - compared to the old ones? We have a wiki
page for that, however it has been merely converted to a page with
feature requests... it would need cleaning to a bare minimum to
actually get the idea what is really missing - and how important the
missing features are.
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Switching_from_Old_to_New_Symbology_and_Labeling

I would suggest that at some point we have to switch to new symbology
even if there are missing features, otherwise we could postpone the
switch forever, waiting for re-implementation of some features.

Martin

I will do that. I recently had to style a large amount of vectors and
I hit several times this issue, so I have pretty clear what is missing
in the new symbology/labelling. Moreover I know pretty well the
redmine tickets and so I have also an idea about feature requests and
what is not working as expected.

As master version is a development version, there is still 1.8 which has 
full symbology and labelling.
Removing old stuff in master would probably accelerate improvement of 
the new labelling and symbology.

Otherwise, waiting for full completion of requirements would probably be 
much longer.

I am no dev so my opinion is worth my 2 cents ;)

 I agree the old versions of symbology and labeling should be removed 
 rather sooner than later. It would increase pressure on developers, 
 financers and users to implement the really important bits that are 
 missing.

 If we do this in the master version it won't hurt existing users.

 We have been discussing this for two years now and noone seems to be 
 really acting about the missing bits other than complaining? Someone has 
 to do the work or pay someone to do it. It won't happen by itself.

While I agree with all the suggestions to cleanup GUI, I think that
GUI changes may be also done after 2.0 release, in minor releases and
continuously. API changes may not! IMO, in 2.0 we should focus on API
cleanup instead of GUI.

I have doubts for example, if the quantity of circular dependencies is
good. See for example
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsMapCanvas.html

We should probably run some code analysis tools on source. Anybody
already done that?

Agreed fully. However, given the recent experience with plugins repos (lots of very
useful plugins are still to be migrated, a 10-min work, with the result they are of
difficult access for new users) I'm a bit worried that we can get stuck, with the
alternative of either:
* releasing qgis with missing important functions, or
* postponing a release with nice new features.
Opinions?
All the best.

I want to use qgis in pytnon environment. but got some problem. as 
http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/intro.html#python-applications says 
but i can set up qgis 1.8 environtment.

I find that grass has ability to use in python, and i succeeded.
use the same method i move to qgis, it seemly worked, but actually something is wrong.
can anyone have ideas for this.

below is my script to set up qgis envriontment in python...

import os,sys

def initqgisenv(qgisdir):
    os.environ['PYTHONPATH']=os.path.join(qgisdir,r'apps\qgis\python')

I agree that API changes are more important during the transition to
2.0. However it also makes sense to do some highly visible GUI changes
before 2.0 rather than between minor 2.x versions (where users do not
expect drastic changes).

Personally, I do not see a problem in this particular instance, do
you? The only circular dependencies shown there are between
QgsMapCanvas and QgsMapTool / QgsMapCanvasMap / QgsMapOverviewCanvas -
and those are fine because they need to communicate with QgsMapCanvas.

My optimistic estimate would be mid-2013, though Radim will be probably closer!

In this case, IMHO we should be prepared releasing another version before the end of
this year.

this is fine with us, as we will continue to donate developer time

Dear All,

I followed your discussion with interest and I have a feeling there are 
two aspects to be considered: One is the developer's perspective and one 
is the user's perspective.
 From a developer's perspective there is the api change, new raster 
architecture (and a lot more I cannot name, basically "under the hood"). 
 From a user's perspective 2.0 should be clearly distinguishable from 
1.* (icons, GUI) and things long introduced (new symbology, new 
labelling) should be standard and work reliably but without regression 
compared to the old methods.
So the project should take its time to satisfy both perspectives.

my two cents

Bernhard

Thanks for taking the time to address my question. I've actually coded
this in C++ and it works pretty well, as a rough proof-of-concept [0].
I'd appreciate it if you checked it out, if you have the time. It's my
first attempt at an actual C++ feature.

There's no GUI, but it can be bluntly toggled for testing like this:

* Load a line vector layer with x, y, and rotation fields in its attribute table
* Configure label engine settings (I only tested with parallel-to-line
settings noted above)
* Enable editing for layer and the labels of its features within the
map canvas extent have their coords and rotation written to the
attribute table
* Try move, rotate, and change label tools to test (all work well for
me, and no longer 'reset' the label on first edit)

The caveat here is that, on every canvas update while the layer is
still editable, labels are always written to the table, even if they
have already been and are identical. This causes a lot of writes that
can take time to undo if layer editing is cancelled. This can be
fixed.

It only writes what's visible in the extent (actually a good feature),
but panning around at different zoom levels, or just zooming out to
layer extent if using map units and showing all labels, eventually
writes most or all labels to the table.

I'm thinking of wiring it to a toggle-able button in the adv. labeling
toolbar. Then a user can leave it on or off while they pan. A user can
then zoom in on a troublesome area, freeze the labels there, toggle
freezing off, then adjust the frozen labels, while leaving the rest
dynamic.

There can be other settings, like only freezing selected feature's labels.

Message-ID: <CALCNqkZVU=mbgdknRB02K3o+CD1Gt4xExQYF4YBvYRYFZ0oUAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I just wanted to share some development plans we have in order to
prevent possible duplication of effort. We have been funded by the
World Bank/GFDRR (Global Fund for Disaster Reduction and Recovery)  to
add the following functionalities to QGIS:

Web Coverage Service Support:
- Implement test suite for WCS integration
- Implement support for WCS as a native QGIS raster driver
- Support addition of WCS layers from python
- Implement WCS test server and document setup procedure so it can be replicated
- Implement a consistent user interface for adding WCS layers
Raster Improvements:
- Resampler branch integration - merge to master and integrate WCS
branch and ensure that all QGIS tests pass
- Implement sensible default colour scaling for rasters using 2% and
98% cumulative pixel count cut off where no style exists
- Implement (with c++ and python tests) range based floating point
raster transparency support in QGIS (singleband rasters only)
- Implement (with c++ and python tests) save as support for rasters in
QGIS. (Mainly tests required as builds on existing work).
- Implement support for user manipulation of raster null values in
QGIS when doing Save as.. (e.g. to specify a new null value).
- Support specification of region, pixel size and output CRS when
doing Save as... for rasters
- Add option (default behaviour) to enable OTF reprojection whenever a
new layer is added that differs in CRS from existing project layers.

The work will be carried by Radim Blazek under subcontract to
Linfiniti Consulting CC

In addition Sourcepole has been contracted by the World Bank/GFDRR to
add the following improvements to the composer:

Improvements to QGIS composer:
- Support graticule labels on specified sides only and ensure
garticule labels on inside are supported via python API
- Draw 'zebra style' graticule on borders
- Support printing degree marker (?) and N/E/S/W in graticule for EPGS:4326 maps
- Support scale bar calculations based on ellipsoid for EPGS:4326 maps
- Support placement of html elements on map composer
- Support overview map bounding box overlay based on extent of another map frame
- Support multipage map compositions with pagination (this will be
limited to nominating a single table/html frame which can overrun the
primary frame and then paginate)
- Ensure composer render to pdf works with python bindings in non-gui
contexts (raster pdf renderer only)
- Ensure composer templates can be rendered from python by specifying
a template file path
- Allow tokenisation of template elements via python (e.g. by passing
strings of file paths to replace composer elements in template)
- Compile a test suite that validates all composer functionality works in C++
- Compile a test suite that validates all composer functionality works in python

This work is being carried out in order to support the ongoing work we
are doing with the InaSAFE (Scenario Assessment for Emergencies)
project that we have been co-developing here at Linfiniti. The purpose
in particular is to support the development of a realtime scenario
report generator for post earthquake events.

The InaSAFE project is being developed by BNPB, AusAID and the World
Bank/GFDRR. You can find more details about the project at
http://inasafe.org

Hi, +1 for that functionnality. 

I wrote a plugin to duplicate a layer and add advanced labeling fields in
order to quickly make a "labeling ready layer". having XY prelocated thanks
to PAL is big feature I miss. 
 (I have some more things to fix before releasing it.. )

 Hi,

 That sounds fantastic - looking forward to all these improvements!

 The WCS is one more OGC implementation that brings us closer to more 
 complete GDI support.

 Personally I am excited about the composer improvements. Together with 
 the serial printing initiative from the Atlas plugin we will get a quite 
 powerful map and report generation engine.

 I also like the requirement to have tests.

 Once this is all implemented one can see what could be exposed in QGIS 
 server and webclient.

 Thanks for the information,
 Andreas

Hi Tim,

> - Implement support for WCS as a native QGIS raster driver

Just curious : has levering and/or improving the GDAL WCS driver been considered
?

Yah, me too !
It's really good to see all those tests as part of the plan :)

Yes - Radim already made a first pass implementation using GDAL WCS
though he said there were some problems with it - I think the most
critical being that it doesn't support proxy access (I am speaking
under correction here as I haven't looked into it in that much detail
myself). I will let Radim comment on any other issues. I think from
the project perspective we don't mind too much which approach is used
if the result is efficient and integrates nicely into QGIS.

Tim

Yes writing tests into the project plan and explaining the value of
investing in them to the clients is the way to go! In this case it was
an easy sell since we are using the work in the project to build
software that 'must just work' and having tests will be critical in
providing that assurance. That said I think in all cases, if a client
has paid for something the will want to know that it 'just works and
keeps working down the line' too. Hopefully other QGIS developers who
are creating contracts will follow suite....

This should be rather easy to add. It is just a matter of setting the right
option to CPLHTTPFetch() (and thus the curl library), namely :

<li>PROXY=val, to make requests go through a proxy server, where val is of the
    form proxy.server.com:port_number
<li>PROXYUSERPWD=val, where val is of the form username:password

Note: They can also already be used by setting the GDAL_HTTP_PROXY and
GDAL_HTTP_PROXYUSERPWD configuration options/environmenet variable, which will
act on all GDAL/OGR drivers that go through the CPLHTTPFetch() function.

I see Radim is already a GDAL committer, so there shouldn't be too much overhead
if he wants to hack in the WCS driver.

Sorry for butting in - but I think it would be much more productive to
fix/enhance the gdal WCS driver than to implement a standalone qgis
provider.

 I think that implicitly answers the only question I had about this
project - that all the stuff would be properly documented too!

 The World Bank are doing a lot of good things - I listened to a few
talks at this http://www.data.gov/communities/conference the other
day.

 Congrats.

Hi

In my opinion, it is better to use the Qt classes for the network 
requests than curl. In QGIS, we have QgsNetworkAccessManager, which 
picks up automatically the network settings from the options tab (proxy 
settings, exclusion list, password, disk cache). It has nice progress 
reporting by signal/slot, the possibility to interrupt the network 
request and a disk cache. And the possibility to provide custom 
implementations for all that if necessary.

Like this, WFS, WPS, WMS providers, plugin installer and open layers 
plugin (and third party python plugins) have a unified method to do 
network requests. No need to use a different network library for each 
one (and the mapping is never 1:1, there is always loss).

So while it might be quicker (in terms of development time) to use the 
GDAL provider, a standalone provider is always more native and flexible 
(that's also the reason there are QGIS vector providers for postgres, 
wfs, gpx, spatialite, grass while everything can be read with the OGR 
provider).

Regards,
Marco

Hi Tim,

Looping this into the dev list, your updates seem to have gotten all the non-expression tests in order on OSX. Perhaps someone else will pick up the mantle on the expression test.

Cheers,
John

I have an immediate need on my current project for just such a plugin!
Please contact me directly if you don't mind sharing it a bit before
release.

The logic in my patch to freeze dynamic labels comes just after the
labels are drawn to the canvas using PAL. It currently can't write all
layer labels to its source (or a duplicated layer) unless all the
labels can be shown in the canvas when zooming to the layer's extent,
which is possible in some labeling setups.

In other words, with my approach, it requires some specific setup or
interactivity from the user. The freeze labels tool I'm working
towards (need it on my project with thousands of labels right now) is
basically an interactive one, similar to the other labeling tools.

It may be possible to mimic those actions in a plugin, to freeze all
labels for a layer, but it won't be very elegant until the Python
access is crafted, as mentioned by Martin (unless you are coding your
plugin in C++, I guess).

Essentially, the plug-in uses spatial information in the polygon layer to write a simulation model input file.  It then uses Python's 'subprocess' module to call the model executable and run the simulation.  It then reads an output file generated by the model, sets the polygon shapefile to be editable, changes some attributes based on the model output, and then commits those changes.  Then repeating this in a loop for each feature in the polygon shapefile.

I've also included an optimization routine for the purpose of model calibration.  This essentially means doing the above procedures repeatedly tens or hundreds of thousands of times.   After each model simulation, the updated 'simulated' attribute values are compared with other attributes that contain 'observed' data.  The optimization then repeatedly adjusts the model parameters until simulated and observed data are in best agreement.

This process can take many hours or days, while I am repeatedly editing the shapefile and commiting the edits.  However, I am not adding or removing any features or attributes.  Problem is the memory slowly creeps up and if the optimization takes too long, I'll run out of memory and QGIS will crash. I notice that if my optimization routine does finish, I can completely shut down my plugin's dialog window, but the memory usage remains high.  This makes me think the problem is not in my plug-in.  Any ideas for me?

Thanks,
Kelly

Thanks Marco for filling in the background to the debate we had when
developing the proposal with WorldBank/GFDRR on whether to implement
the WCS provider natively or use GDAL. All of the reasons Marco
mentions make extremely good sense.

Given the planned work on the composer I wonder if you're considering to
move the print code (e.g. [1]) outside of the GUI/app control, and make it
available for the python API, maybe in a QgsComposerPrinter class.
This would also make Atlas simpler...

You would probably need to run your plugin under a memory profiler
like valgrind to see where the leaks are occurring.

My apologies if that is too low level an answer.

As I said, I have doubts, I am not sure if it is a problem or how it
is important. I remember,  that once I was looking for something
around QgsMapCanvas and I found it quite difficult due to the circular
dependencies. I think that it is especially a problem for readability,
which I consider very important in OS project.

For example, QgsMapCanvasMap is using QgsMapCanvas in 2 methods to get
  QgsMapRenderer (QgsMapCanvas member) and call its methods. When
reading QgsMapCanvasMap source, you don't see that calling
QgsMapCanvasMap methods modifies QgsMapRenderer:

void QgsMapCanvasMap::resize( QSize size ) {
  ...
  mCanvas->mapRenderer()->setOutputSize( size, mPixmap.logicalDpiX() );
}

it is used in QgsMapCanvas:

  mMap->resize( size() );

I would prefer to set QgsMapRenderer size in QgsMapCanvas, either
simply something like

  mMap->resize( size() );
  mMapRenderer->setOutputSize( mMap->size() );

or with a resize signal from QgsMapCanvasMap.

The second method is

void QgsMapCanvasMap::render() {
  ...
  mCanvas->mapRenderer()->render( &paint );
}

which may be simply changed to

void QgsMapCanvasMap::render( QgsMapRenderer*  renderer) {
  ...
  renderer->render( &paint );
}

We would have one circular dependency less with just 2 simple changes.
In this case I don't see any real reason for circular dependency, it
does not seem to be intentional design, it seems that this
constellation appeared somehow itself during code evolution.

I believe that 2.0 API break is good opportunity to review such places.

It makes sense to remove this dependency, I wasn't aware of this one...

Marco explained the situation better than I could do. I can only add that:
- reading data with GetCoverage is only one part (about 50%) of the
provider, there is a lot of things around, which we have to do in QGIS
anyway - get list of coverages, describe coverages, GUI select etc.
- even with native (or more native) WCS provider, we are still using
GDAL to decode downloaded data
- (I know that OS people don't like to here it and  they will argue
that is is not a way ahead.) WCS is not widespread yet and there are
various issues with implementation in UMN Mapserver (and other
servers) and GDAL. Combination of that issues made it for example
impossible to support WCS 1.1 in QGIS via GDAL WCS provider. In QGIS
we can use various hacks to get over various issues with servers, for
example axis switching etc. which would not be accepted in GDAL. Then
there is a question of time, if you look at deployment on Linux, it
takes months or years to get fixed package into a distribution. In
last two days, I found for example new issues with both UMN Mapserver
and GDAL which we can get around in QGIS, but we would need to wait
years until fixed versions get to distributions.
- we are using GDAL/OGR heavily where possible.
- question/suggestion, GDAL i using CPLHTTPFetch() to get data from
server, would it be possible to add a possibility to set user function
to be used instead of default CPLHTTPFetch()? Something like
SetHTTPFetchFunction( myHTTPFetch ). That would make it possible to
use GDAL providers with QgsNetworkAccessManager for example.

Hi R?gis,
IMHO, better publishing it and mark it as experimental, so it will be easier to
cooperate.
All the best, and thanks.

Well, when developing the WFS driver in OGR, I have had to implement various
hacks to support the varying behaviour of the WFS servers in the wild, so I
don't think it is an absolute obstacle. There's probably still work to deal with
axis switching in GDAL. For geographic SRS, the support for axis switching is
already there (I didn't check if it is used in the WCS driver, but it is there
at the OGRSpatialReference level, and it is already used in the WMS and WFS
drivers). I have also a patch pending to deal with projected SRS that have axis
switched, if that's what is missing. If the issue is that some servers don't
behave accordingly to the spec, we could imagine to have an option in the
description XML to pass that information to the driver.

Not false, but I'm wondering why a new version of QGIS would be packaged faster
than a GDAL one. QGIS could document that QGIS X needs at least GDAL >= Y if it
needs Y for a functionality.

I was actually thinking to something like that when reading Marco's email.
Sounds perfectly doable. The only point that could be tricky is if you need a
user_data pointer that is specific to each WCS connexion.

My intention was not to force the use of GDAL, but to know if there were
technical reasons that would prevent from using it. This work could be an
opportunity to make its WCS driver better, for QGIS benefit, and all other
projects that rely on GDAL.

Best regards,

Even

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin. Get a signal when the geometry is changed
Message-ID: <CADK08-4ka9PL+8YmEfR2BTVwoBfGqWqMVgNJTixSb2SLXZu0mg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I hope this is the right place to send this.

I am working on a plugin in QGIS and want to get a signal when the geometry
to a feature(in this case a polyline) in my layer is changed. For example
if I use the node tool to drag one of the nodes.

I have posted the question on stackexchange, but I have not got a answer
that solved it.
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/29306/how-to-get-a-signal-when-the-geometry-to-a-line-in-qgis-is-changed


I have tried to use both the old and the new style:

QObject.connect(self.iface.activeLayer(),SIGNAL("geometryChanged(qint64,QgsGeometry)"),self.changedGeometry)
Here the program don't crash but I don't get the message when the geometry
changes

self.iface.activeLayer().geometryChanged.connect(self.changedGeometry)
Here I get this error: "TypeError: connect() failed between
geometryChanged(qint64,QgsGeometry) and unislot()"

def changedGeometry(self, intValue, qgsGeom):
        QMessageBox.information(self.iface.mainWindow(),"Message", "Changed
geometry. intValue: " + str(intValue) + "qgsGeom: " + str(qgsGeom))

in the top of the file I have these imports:
    from PyQt4.QtCore import *
    from PyQt4.QtGui import *
    from qgis.core import *
    from qgis.gui import *

Yes, requests must be somehow assigned to layers/providers so that
progress may be emitted from the right place.  It could be maybe done
using GDALDatasetH pointer? Just another hack.

In theory, we are going to use threads, which could complicate it even
more. It is not yet clear to me if QgsRasterDataProvider::readBlock of
an instance is also going to be called from multiple threads
simultaneously?

I've no ideal solution for this. Your suggestion could be indeed a possibility :
adding 2 methods GDALDatasetSetUserData() & GDALDatasetGetUserData() and the
user data being passed to the custom http fetcher if it is defined. Except that
I think that in the Open() method of the WCS driver, there are already HTTP
requests done to determine some characteristics of the dataset, so that is not
practical since the dataset handle isn't yet known at that time. Would need more
thinking.

That can be a problem. And it isn't specific to the WCS driver. It is generally
not safe to access the *same* dataset handle concurrently from multiple threads
with most GDAL drivers, because the XXXDataset or XXXRasterBand classes may have
state variables that aren't protected against concurrent access. Looking a bit
at the WCS driver, I can see that the osResultFilename and pabySavedDataBuffer
member variables would certainly not appreciate concurrent access on the same
dataset handle. But looking at how they are used, they is no need to make them
persist between different calls to the IReadBlock() method. So they could be
easily made local variables passed to the GDALOpenResult() and
FlushMemoryResult() methods.

But reading your later email where you mention that the native QGIS WCS driver
is almost there, there's probably no need to dig further into this.

Thanks for having shared your thoughts,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Overview frame in composer
Message-ID: <3778CBDC-848F-4B83-990F-E4779E590683@gmail.com>

Hi Marco,

I don't know if this is a bug or a lack of understanding on this new feature. On a map composer item, I want to add the overview frame. I can select an overview style, but the "Overview frame" drop-down menu only has the "none" option.

Is there something I need to do to provide an overview choice in that drop-down, or is it possible that the list is not being populated on my OS X system and it is a bug?

Let me know what I can do to help debug if it is the latter.

Cheers,
John

Hi John

It is a bug (the feature is still fresh). The list does not get updated 
when you add new composer maps.
But it already works if you add the overview map second, since the list 
gets populated with the composer maps that are already there.

Regards,
Marco

You have to have two map frames on your composer. On the the second one
you select it to be a overview map of the first one.

The UI might need some better naming to explain this better.

Thanks. I am playing with it now. It took me a couple of tries to see that it required more than one map item. This is a great addition to the composer!

GDAL offers RAT support but I don't know of any GIS sw supporting
reading/writing RATs.
Has ever been discussed or planned its support in QGis?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GPS Tools strange behavior
Message-ID: <1342261893.72665.YahooMailNeo@web164503.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to download data from a Garmin GPSMAP 60CS with the GPS Tools and I'm faced with a strange and erratic behavior. I can not find a pattern.

I leave here a screencast: http://goo.gl/lofgh? 

With gpsbabel from the command line, everything works fine.

With the GPS Tools, using the arguments %babel and %out, it does not work, as you can see in the screencast, or because it freezes QGIS, or because it shows the message "The layer (...) is not a valid layer and can not be added to the map".

Putting the full command on the "Waypoint download" field (gpsbabel -w -i garmin -o gpx -f usb: -F /home/pedro/waypoints/wpt2.gpx), it works sometimes, while other times it downloads the data and creates the .gpx file, but freezes and the only option is to force close the tool, which makes QGIS crash.

Has anyone had this problem? 

I am using Xubuntu 12.04 and QGIS master.

Thanks! 


Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Subject: [Qgis-developer] empty ds/layer creation duplicated in
	QgsOgrProvider and QgsVectorFileWriter
Message-ID: <CAA6k8-Lxs=8UZDSXjJD9eXQnuQBJy-v3DW9WZExqvtO9EUCdtg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

today looking at the OGRProvider I've found some duplications:

QGISEXTERN bool createEmptyDataSource(...)
QGISEXTERN QgsVectorLayerImport::ImportError createEmptyLayer(...)

Both accomplish the same task (empty LAYER creation), but

createEmptyLayer() uses the QgsVectorFileWriter class,

createEmptyDataSource() contains code pretty similar to the one
within the QgsVectorFileWriter class (duplicated code).

The createEmptyLayer is used by the ImportVectorLayer feature
I developed for the GSoC the last year, so functions with the same
name are also present in both the PG and SL providers.
I don't know if the createEmptyDataSource() was already present at
that time (my apologize if it was)...

BTW having duplicated code between the provider and
QgsVectorFileWriter class is not good.
For this reason I called QgsVectorFileWriter methods from "my"
createEmptyLayer(), waiting for the API break to move the code
from QgsVectorFileWriter class to the OGR provider.

Is it time to break API or should we just clean it up removing
the createEmptyDataSource() function and replacing all its
occurrences (it's used in src/gui/qgsnewvectorlayerdialog.cpp only)
with the createEmptyLayer() function?

Regards.

Hello Lene,

Thank you for your workaround.

This is a really strange issue... In the first attempt I made with your solution, it worked, but in all other attempts have not... In some of that attempts, it freezes QGIS and in other it shows the message "The layer (...) is not a valid layer and can not be added to the map"...

Best regards,
Pedro

Hi
I?ve had the same errors. I have a funny workaround.
Try to change the line in "Waypoint download". %babel -w -i garmin -o gpx "%in" "%out"
Delete the " "
And Update
Then Set the " " again and update
Then it should work.......

Regards
Lene Fischer

AFAIK we already have API break. First was in composer classes and
now there are also API breaks within raster rendering subsystem. So,
I think it is ok to remove duplicate code.

Just my 2c

Hello again,

After a huge set of tests, I found what might be a pattern, although sometimes there are attempts that fail this pattern.

The tool works most of the time, downloading or uploading data, with the commands:
Waypoint download: %babel -w -i garmin -o gpx -f /dev/ttyUSB0 -F "%out"
Track upload: %babel -t -i gpx -f "%in" -o garmin -F /dev/ttyUSB0

since, as Lene Fischersaid, delete the quotes on "%out"/"%in" and then click Update (which puts again the quotes).
In addition, I noticed that it gives much more errors (freezing), using Tab and Enter to click the buttons (Save as and OK). Using the mouse for that, worked in most of the attempts.

So, if you do not delete the "", in most cases it shows the message: "The layer (...) is not a valid layer and can not be added to the map", and moreover, if not using the mouse, the errors are much more frequent.

I made these attempts in both Xubuntu and Windows7, with similar results, although in Win freezing is somewhat less common.

Using gpsbabel directly, both from CLI and GUI, everything works smoothly.

Anyone confirm? Should I open a ticket?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Subject: [Qgis-developer] histogram fixes and improvements
Message-ID: <CA+TxYvPXAfswN_J4ahgdaiQEN0HPs-SXkir0J1yA6i-j1Ym6Jw@mail.gmail.com>

i devs,

I would like to announce changes in the histogram which I have just
commited (my first commits as part of the team!)

There are some changes that might cause minor disruption, so I would
like that anyone who has interest please check out latest code and
test it a bit. I have tested on a few datasets, so there may be a few
kinks and bugs to sort out, as well as possible objections.

I have also made some changes to the raster properties UI Style tab to
make things a bit more compact and clean, as well as changes in
QgsRasterLayer and QgsRasterDataProvider, some of which are note
entirely related to the histogram UI and backend.

Here is a summary of changes (mostly based on the different commits)

- add UI to pick min/max band values in histogram
- add histogram zoom in/out
- verify that raster has cached histogram, compute on demand
- prevent double refresh of histogram tab (#4132)
- don't use color interpretation band names when band count > 1
- make multiband color raster widget more compact
- fix histogram and stats compute (set bapprox=false) for gdal
provider ; fix histogram display for non-Byte data
- add various action to load min/maxes, and display certain bands only
(selected band, RGB bands, etc.)

The range of the histogram bins (256) in the gdal provider has changed
from (bandMin-bandMax) to -0.5 - 255.5 for byte data, because there is
not point in having 256 samples in an interval that is smaller than
256 - this creates gaps in the histogram. This also solves
displacement issues of the center of the band curves. Still needs some
tweaking for non-byte data though. See attached images for an
illustration. If have not looked at other providers (grass...) though.

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15998214/qgis/histo1.jpg
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15998214/qgis/histo2.jpg

I will next re-factor the code so that histogram computation and UI
are dealt with separatey, in order to write some tests.
Here is Martin's suggestion (from another thread in the qgis-psc
list), perhaps others have good ideas about this?

Or simply have a HistogramGraph class in core lib - that would take
care of bare histogram drawing (to any paint device) - and
HistogramGraphWidget in gui lib that would take care of interactivity
and would make use of HistogramGraph.

cheers,
Etienne

hi Guys,

I didn't find any major changes pushed to github about this topic?

I have just pushed my histogram fixes, and some changes to
qgsrasterlayer and qgsrasterdataprovider (see other email).

Like other stats stuff there is duplication.  How should we proceed -
pull all stats stuff in QgsRasterDataProvider, and call them directly?

I found a possible bug : theIgnoreOutOfRangeFlag is forgotten after it
is set in QgsGdalProvider::populateHistogram() - perhaps cleaning up
the raster stats would fix that?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] user-defined symbology defaults + project templates
Message-ID: <CA+TxYvO=oR4=PUu_H=-FYFnp2G5YZcnBrkT_4VVqzuU50S9xLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

There are 2 interrelated topics that I have been thinking about and
have come up with a solution, and I would like to get other's feedback
before proceeding further.

1) Default symbol styles are not user configurable - for example new
polygons are always filled with a random color, new point symbols are
always small red dots, etc.

I see 2 ways to change this - either global or project based. I think
project based is better because defaults in a given project are
probably not best for all projects.

So I have implemented the interface and back-end to select default
symbology (point, line, polygon) and color ramps for a project, and
all new symbols have identical properties.
See attached screenshot for an idea. Should probably also add options
for rasters (i.e. what's already in the prefs, plus default renderer
style).

2) New project defaults may not be ideal for all users - see
background discussion below which deals with default composer
templates.

A solution to this is to have a default project (template) which is
loaded when a new project is created. My solution allows to select the
default project template and also adds a UI to load a "blank" project.
I realize this may cause some problems, but it's nicer than to have to
manually load a project "template" after creating a new project (or
opening qgis for the first time).

This, combined with the symbology defaults, means that a user can
define his personal symbology defaults and have them always loaded
when a new project is created.

Any ideas/comments?

Etienne

Hi Etienne,

2012/7/14 Etienne Tourigny <etourigny.dev at gmail.com>:
> - don't use color interpretation band names when band count > 1

IMO, this should be handled in different way. Color interpretation
also often used in multiband images, so show this info only for
singleband raster is not correct.

I just commited my own fixes, including fix for color interpretation
handling: now all info is displayed as Band 1 (color_intepretation)
or simply Band 1, if color interpretation is not available.

Hi all,

I think that QgisApp::getThemePixmap()  and getThemeIcon() should be
in QgsApplication so that other modules can access it without
requiring qgisapp, can I add it there and deprecate the one in
QgisApp?

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_hWG1SXjzHKWkY70eDkacba8YdeL5=3Ubj7p47+nZ5tg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The current large-format project I'm working on requires me to layout,
for print, thousands of labels. So I spent the last couple of days
making two new tools for the advanced labeling toolbar that allow the
user to interactively 'freeze' (write coords and rotation info to
attribute table) and 'thaw' (revert from data-defined to dynamic) any
rendered labels.

*Show Frozen Labels*

This tool highlights frozen labels for all visible layers. Blue
highlighted labels are frozen, green are frozen and editable (parent
layer's in edit mode).

*Freeze/Thaw Labels*

This tool allows the user to interactively choose, by single or
marquee selection, labels to freeze or thaw. The in-memory attribute
table is immediately updated and results shown to user. This tool
allows the user to interactively manipulate the PAL labeling engine to
find the best solutions for their frozen labels.

Since the topic and how the tool interacts with the labeling engine is
more complicated, I made an intro video. (Note: I haven't had much
sleep recently, so it's a bit rough.)

http://vimeo.com/dakotacarto/freezethawlabels


This is my first C++ project, so I'd be really happy if someone
audited the code before I squash the commits and send a pull request:

https://github.com/dakcarto/Quantum-GIS/tree/feature_freeze-thaw-labels

Only tested on Mac, as of now. Nothing platform-specific about it though.

Hey Larry,

Great job! Love the use of green and blue rectangles to highlight what
mode the label is in. Will be a very handy feature to have.

I'll let one of the more experienced developers review the code, but I
couldn't see a reason this wouldn't make it into core.

Hi Giuseppe

createEmptyDataSource is the older method of those two, it was written 
before QgsVectorFileWriter existed.
I agree it makes sens to remove it and replace with a call to the vector 
file writer.

Hey Etienne,

I like the ideas but I do some have some comments on the
implementation from a UI point of view.  I like being able to set the
default symbols for a project, that will come in very handy.  What I
would do here however is have a button with a icon and text rather
than a combobox.  The button would open the symbol selector and let
the user select a symbol.  We are redoing the symbol manager and
symbol selector in the current GSoC, so I think the new version will
work well here. The new symbol manager allows for grouping and
searching so you wouldn't have to scroll though a massive list of
symbols.

For the templates thing I think that is a great idea however maybe we
can expand it a bit more and make it more flexible. What I think we
could do is rather then having a single default temple we could have a
template search path/s and give the user a list of .qgs files in these
folders.  To handle this in the UI I would have New Project From
Temple... menu item that has a sub menu listing all the templates, if
would also add a drop down menu to the New Project toolbar button to
let people select the template from the toolbar.

Thoughts?

Hi,

I think this is pretty useful!
In parallel to templates, how about adding a button in the project 
settings, to make these settings as global default settings?

Greetings,

Denis

Hi Larry

Excellent work, thank you!
The freeze/thaw tool will be a great addition to the label tool bar.

I wonder if the tool could also be active if x/y is data defined and 
rotation not (currently, x/y/rotation need to be data defined to use the 
tool).

On a detail level, in QgsMapToolFreezeLabels::highlightLabel you could 
probably use QgsMapRenderer::mapToLayerCoordinates to transform the 
rectangle (instead of mCoordTransform ).

Regards,
Marco

Hi Alexander

Ok, that sounds reasonable to me (new class in core directory). In that 
case, the new class has a similar role for scales as QgsTolerance has 
for snap distances.

done.

Hi,

Thanks Alexander for developping the idea underneath my patch. Allowing the
user to define the default Qgis scale lists is the right way to go. And we
will be able to have a "scale list repository", as python snippets codes.

I have another related idea. It could be good to have a project option to
force the canvas to always stick to the given scales list. Anytime the user
zoom (in / out / to extent , etc.), Qgis will go the closer corresponding
scale. For example, if a zoom should bring me to 1/2656, and I have defined
this scales list : 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, Qgis will automatically zoom
1/2500 instead.
Of course we should not refresh the canvas twice, one for 2656 and then one
for 2500.

Michael

Yes, that is an unnecessary restriction. I'll make the rotation field optional.

Will make the change. Thanks.

If you have the time to look at the constructor for
QgsMapToolFreezeLabels (the FIXME), you'll notice I could not find a
way to make the signal/slot connections from there. Currently they are
in qgisapp.cpp, but I would prefer to not pollute that core file with
any more of my tool's code than necessary. What's the simplest way to
create the connections from inside my QObject-inherited tool instead?

Larry

very nice ideas!

I would add the possibility to allow the level of transparency for both
the filling of polygons and the level of transparency of the selection
color. At this moment are by default both 100% solid and this is not
handy in may cases. A certain amount of transparency for polygon filling
helps a lot to quickly see if there are overlapped areas.

Making the selection color a bit transparent is necessary because it can
hide polygons that are below other ones, or even cause to select
polygons by mistake (using the "select features by rectangle" tool, in
opposition to the "select single feature" tool). 

cheers

I'm glad others see this as useful!

Any idea when these changes will be available, and if should I wait
before adding my changes to master? In the meantime, I could perhaps
push what I have done.
Currently, the button changes the selected symbol, but it could be
modified to open the symbol lists. I just thought this way was a bit
faster.

I like the idea of multiple templates to choose from, but I would
still like a way to change the global defaults (see answer to Denis).

Any idea on how to manage the template list from a UI perspective?
Just have a file sector and have the user place/save the files there,
and then a dynamic menu which lists these files?

That's the idea of having a "Default template", when you create a new
project it loads that project file. I saw it as the simplest way to
treat user defaults, without having to mess too much with the
back-end.
However, I see now that it's probably not the best way to deal with
user defaults.

Should these user defaults be saved to user configuration (QGis.conf),
or a special "Default.qgs" file in the.qgis directory, or in a
user-defined template file?

How would one proceed than, if for example, global defaults are
overridden by the user, and a specific template is loaded? First load
the global defaults, then the user defaults, then the specific
template?

The slot methods need to be declared as slots in the header file, like this:

public slots:

     //! Update frozen label highlights on canvas render finished
     void updateFrozenLabels();
     //! Render rectangles around frozen labels
     void highlightFrozenLabels();

Currently, they are just normal public methods.

Regards,
Marco

I think so. For example QgsDataItem::getThemePixmap (copy of
QgisApp::getThemePixmap)  exists only because QgisApp::getThemePixmap
is not available in core.

Do you want to keep QgisApp::getThemePixmap in 2.0 as deprecated or do
you want to deprecate it for a while and remove before 2.0 release?
General question, is it 2.0 going to have deprecated methods? It
should not, I believe.

I would mark it as deprecated it for a time, but remove it entirely
from qgisapp before 2.0 is released.

I guess there should not be, but you might want to keep some methods
for backwards-compat, depending on the case.

Given that QgisApp methods can be used only within QGIS application
sources (src/app folder), it is really sufficient to change all
occurrences of getThemePixmap() to use QgsApplication, no need to keep
it as deprecated.

In any case, we should not release 2.0 with deprecated methods / classes.

Just a friendly reminder to those pushing into the master branch -
please remember to run the tests and also check on the dash that they
pass on all platforms. Doing this help can prevent regressions early
in the process.

Hi Tim

is there any way to get bigger images, when we run the tests locally?
I suspect these errors may be due to a small change I committed (gdal
min/max calculations), will act upon this shortly.

Etienne

I all,

I am writing some tests for the histogram (still a few fixes in the
oven), and I was wondering how I could take advantage of the existing
qgsrenderchecker.

As these tests have invisible gui elements (I have refactored the
histogram into a standalone widget), I'm not sure it should reside in
the core/ directory but be part of the gui/ directory.

Basically the 2 options I see:
- subclass QgsRenderChecker in gui/testqgsrasterhistogram.cpp file
- add these tests to QgsRenderChecker

any ideas?
Etienne

Speaking of tests, ignore the last post from hawkeye. I'll send an update later that will include the latest code improvements and a working test run.

This makes more sense.

BTW I have added a new test for histogram rendering.

The reasons I suggested not using a combobox is because with long
names the combobox grows and pushes the size of the dialog box out,
although with a button you are going to have the same issue I guess.
I'm happy for a commit of what you have so far and then we can rework
it once the GSoC stuff is in master.

+1 as long it is obvious that the defaults have been changed.

I would have a folder called 'project_templates" in the .qgis folder
and the list could be read from there by default, you could also have
a place in the global settings where you could define other folders to
look for templates.  I might store projects on a network folder so
that other people can access them so it would be good to be able to
tell QGIS to look in there too.

For me the template should overwrite everything.  If I go File-> New
Project From Template -> My Template then it will take priority over
anything I have set anywhere else.

Is it possible for dashboard to send an email to whoever breaks the tests ?
It'd be easier to know when you break something.

I think, we don't have control of that server.  But anyway, how does a test
know who broke it?

No way of knowing directly - but perhaps it could send an email to the
authors of the commits that were applied the day before the test was
first broken - not sure if it's easy to write.

This should probably be easy to do - it looks like CDash supports this
[1] - although this might generate some noise

[1] http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CDash:EmailSettingsOverview

On the "createProject.php" page, the "E-mail" tab. These settings are
documented on http://public.kitware.com/Wiki/CDash:Administration
(search the page for "email").
 [ ] Email submission failures (this means when there are
config/build/test warnings or errors)

9/17/2011 in svn trunk: added "Email committers" checkbox to email
people who committed/authored on a per-group basis even if they are
not registered with CDash (assuming we can grok their email address
from the commit info... (we can with git based projects))

Right, it's pretty simple anyway so not hard to modify afterward. I'll
just make sure the combobox does not grow if the names are long.

Hi All,

I'm running QGIS 1.8 from installed package on Ubuntu 11.04, as well as trying to build and run dev master from a custom installed directory e.g /home/user/dev/qgis-install. Version 1.8 seems to run well and I can compile and install the master version. However running master (directly calling the qgis binary) causes me issues in a few cases:

1/ Fatal: ASSERT: "myResult == 0" in file /home/jpalmer/Dev/qgis/Quantum-GIS/src/app/qgsoptions.cpp, line 999. I read that this is due to other versions of the qgis core lib being present i.e 1.8 http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2012-February/018375.html

2/ Some python plugins do not load. e.g Couldn't load plugin cadtools due an error when calling its classFactory(). Or pgversion: NameError: name 'localePath' is not defined

3/ Plugin installer does not see any of my installed plugins and won't let me download and install new plugins.

Is there some sort of environment setup or qgis runtime config I have forgotten to do to make this stuff work?

Cheers,
Jeremy

Have you tried setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to e.g.
/home/user/dev/qgis-install/lib before launching master?

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/dev/qgis-install/lib
/home/user/dev/qgis-install/bin/qgis &

I've pushed to a slightly modified version of both features.

1) Added default vector transparency for projects ; ui tweaks

Would there be any thing else to add to vector defaults?

Also, how about raster defaults? Perhaps the entire "Rasters" section
from the main options dialog?


2) Save the "default template" to $HOME/.qgis/default.qgs (see UI in
Options->General->Project Files)

Next would be to implement a template folder (both saving and loading)
and UI for custom template folder(s) - perhaps a single folder is good
enough to make it simple?


cheers,
Etienne

I've updated and extensively tested this new tool (not all platforms)
and it works very well. I have sent in a pull request:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/193

Again, here's the intro video:
http://vimeo.com/dakotacarto/freezethawlabels
(Note: I haven't had much sleep, so the video is a bit rough.)

As an unexpected added bonus (well, unexpected to me), the tool helps
greatly with slow label rendering options, like a polygon layer's
'free' and 'horizontal' modes. After the PAL labeling engine finishes
with those modes during a canvas refresh (sometimes taking several
minutes), just use the freeze label tool on the result. The subsequent
canvas refreshes are magnitudes faster.

Marco H., thank you for your help on this, and thanks to sourcepole
and Martin for doing such a great job of coding the advanced labeling
engine. I would have never been able to produce this tool had it not
been for the excellent existing and flexible code.

Hi Tim,

Yes I tried that. Didn't make any difference to the issues below :(

Thanks for the quick response.  Since my previous post, I have modified the code to eliminate all the calls to startEditing() and commitChanges().  I thought the memory problems might have been related to memory leaks in those functions.  Now, I'm implementing changeAttributeValues() through the vector data provider to modify the attribute table directly without messing with the layer editing buffer, as recommended here:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2011-July/015385.html

However, some major memory leaks remain.  As recommended in the previous post, I implemented my plug-in under valgrind on a Linux machine.  Some output below highlights the changeAttributeValues() function as a possible culprit:  500,000 bytes 'definitely' lost with only a couple iterations of my algorithm.  It's easy to see how gobs of memory can be lost after many thousand iterations.  Any suggestions for a better way to update an attribute table repeatedly without losing so much memory?  Thanks, Kelly

You would probably need to run your plugin under a memory profiler
like valgrind to see where the leaks are occurring.

My apologies if that is too low level an answer.

Message-ID: <CAA5P-m2dU-jN1jXxZFQF0ty6dqgoz78EYJnfJuo0LuiNkhz4zg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
I have had some difficulty with implementing the tests for Sextante,
in particular, using QgsProviderRegistry.

cf: http://code.google.com/p/sextante/source/browse/trunk/soft/bindings/qgis-plugin/src/sextante/tests/qgis_interface.py

The providers seem not to load. Note that the qgis interface stub is
initialized after a call to QgsApplication.initQgis().
If you have any pointers on what I could be doing wrong, it would be
very much appreciated.

Thank you & regards,
Camilo

Hi all,

I've pushed this feature to master.

Now project scales can be modified from Settings-Options-Map tools
(global setting) or in project properties (overrides global settings). Also
project setting can be temporarily disabled using checkbox.

Sounds great.

Would be ideal if web-client uses the project defined scales!

Denis,

In LizMap you can define the scales for your web LizMap project
But with the master, we can reused or override the scales.

Hi Denis

Together with Andreas, we are currently thinking about an additional way 
of passing server capabilities to the webclient (something more specific 
than WMS capabilities). Scales defined in the project could also be part 
of it.

Marco

Woul be great I think.

The less you have to specify in the client part, the better it is (I think).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing raster-pipes-2 branch for testing
Message-ID: <5006D281.8020207@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs

I'd like to announce the branch 'raster-pipes-2' in Radims repository 
https://github.com/blazek/Quantum-GIS for testing.
Radim did a great job in refactoring the process of reading / resampling 
/ reprojecting / displaying / modifying raster layers. Every step is now 
a subclass of QgsRasterInterface, with the advantage that several steps 
can be chained in a QgsRasterPipe. Like that, the raster functionality 
is nicely separated into different classes and it is easy to add/remove 
elements in the pipe. The iteration over the raster parts is controlled 
by QgsRasterIterator (because for high-resolution prints or analysis on 
large datasets, it is impossible to keep everything in memory at once).

Please report any issue you find in the branch to the developer mailing 
list.

Besides the changes in code architecture, there is also a new feature in 
the raster-pipes-2 branch. It is now possible to write through 
QgsRasterDataProvider (currently only supported by the gdal provider). 
There is a 'save as...' function also for rasters now (though it is not 
100% complete at the moment). There is the option to save a raster in 
one file or in tiles (the tiles are then saved in one directory and vrt 
/ pyramides are automatically created. Very usefull for saving the 
contents of a WMS layer).

Regards,
Marco

That's great news!

Concerning raster saving - will there be a mechanism for compressing files?
It would be great if default compression schemes could be chosen for
different file types, and an option at save time - sort of like image
editors.

I had trouble building it with external spatialite, could only get it
to compile with cmake -DWITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE=TRUE - does this
require a special version of spatialite?

regards,
Etienne

Noticed a few issues with the save dialog

1) "format" drop-down is empty
2) cannot select a new file
3) segfault when saving to an existing file
4) It would be nice to have that action in the legend contextual menu,
like for vector layers.

Etienne

After doing that, can you run ldd on the qgis binary and its libs
(qgiscore, gui, python) and see that they are indeed referencing the
correct libs?

It would be really awesome to save those tiles straight into an
mbtiles sqlite data store too - a nice way to turn an online resource
into a portable fast local copy.

Here's the output for ldd: http://gist.github.com/3139358. 

I've also noted that the resource directory is not being found. E.g when I open the coordinate system dialogue I get "Could not open CRS database /resources/srs.db
Error(14): unable to open database file".. The resources seem to be correctly located in /Dev/qgis/install-master/share/qgis

Are there some other environment variables I should be setting?

I didnt have time to look through your code right now (maybe this
evening I will have a chance), but try looking at this project where I
have implemented a working test suite for a QGIS python plugin.

https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/tree/master/gui

The tests are run automatically whenever a git push happens so you can
see what is produced here:

In particular also look at this
https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/blob/master/gui/utilities_test.py#L58
which uses an env var 'QGISPATH' to set up the search path for
providers etc.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SVG symbols in QGIS with modifiable colors
Message-ID: <20120719095230.3bce17ae@nature.fritz.box>

Hi,

I tried to follow the howtos in the web about defining colors for svg with
param(fill), param(outline) and param(stroke-width). 

<svg width="100%" height="100%">
<rect fill="param(fill) #ff0000" stroke="param(outline) #00ff00"
stroke-width="param(stroke-width) 10" width="100" height="100"> </rect>
</svg>

I used a copy from the svg /usr/share/qgis/svg/gpsicons/tree.svg. It looks a
little different:

[...]
     style="font-size:12px;stroke:#000000;stroke-width:3;fill:#a7a5a5;fill-opacity:
     1;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-dasharray:none;stroke-linejoin:miter;stroke-linecap:butt"
     d="M 56.010357,6.2503568 L 30.572857,43.031607 L 37.729107,43.031607 L
     23.666607,63.344107 L 33.072857,63.344107 L 18.291607,84.719107 L 
     46.510357,84.719107 L 46.510357,99.812857 L 65.541607,99.812857 L
     65.541607,84.687857 L 
[...]

All I managed to change is the fill value with the syntax below, but it
doesn't work for stroke and stroke width.

[...]
     style="font-size:12px;stroke:param(outline);stroke-width:param(stroke-width);
     fill:param(fill);fill-opacity:1;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-dasharray:none;
     stroke-linejoin:miter;stroke-linecap:butt"
     d="M 56.010357,6.2503568 L 30.572857,43.031607 L 37.729107,43.031607 L
     23.666607,63.344107 L 33.072857,63.344107 L 18.291607,84.719107 L
     46.510357,84.719107 L 46.510357,99.812857 L 65.541607,99.812857 L
     65.541607,84.687857 
[...]

Has the syntax changed? Or how does it work with more complex svgs. I also
created a svg with inkscape, it shows the same syntax as tree.svg.

Thanks a lot
Otto

The "Connect" button turns to "Cancel" (or "Stop"?) - just click on that.  It
will then stop when the last running query is done.

 Hi Otto,

 Have you tried using presentation attributes only instead of the style 
 attribute that mixes everything?

 It may be that QGIS only looks into the fill, stroke and stroke-width 
 attributes and not in the style attribute.

 The way Inkscape exports SVG is a bit of a mess. It also exports way 
 too many style attributes (where there are defaults that you could omit) 
 with unnecessary repeats (over and over again). A manual SVG code would 
 easily be 1/4 of the size that Inkscape generates. But there is an 
 option to output an "optimized" or "optimiertes" SVG file where you can 
 choose to use "Stil nach XML" (Style to XML).

 Hope this helps,
 Andreas

Hi Andreas,

I tried the "optimized" SVG output from inkscape - looks better, but still I
can only change fill color, or stroke. But fill seems to overwrite stroke
and I never was able to define stroke-width.

Do you have a more complex example, where I could try to figure out what's
wrong with my tree.svg definition?

Regards
Otto

There is a sporadic error in qqgsexpressiontest, it happens on some
platforms and not always. I experienced it once on my machine. It`s
been around for quite some time.

Those kind of errors are really worth fixing ASAP as an intermittent
failure would defeat the notification capability of build bots.
The bot would start arbitrarily blaming people...

Those failing expression tests are strange.  Works on some but not others :S

Message-ID: <20120719172820.131044g6l9golbx0@webmail.uni-koeln.de>

Hi *,

I've got two problems - your help would be very much appreciated.
1. Exporting attribute tables as .csv- or .kml-files seems to destruct  
Greek signs (even in UTF-8) though they're perfectly visible in QGIS  
itself. Any suggestions?
2. I can't find a way to extend the length of the string-fields of the  
attribute table over 254 signs. Any ideas here?

Thanks a lot,
Ulrich

I suppose you use shapefile. In this case, you can't have attributes
longer than 255 bytes, this limitation of DBF format (used to store
attributes in shapefiles). If you need longer attributes use another
format, for example PostGIS or SpatiaLite

Hope this helps

A more generic question - is there a way that we could implement a
generic mechanism for stopping a processing that takes forever, such
as

- Identify tool in a *very* large vector layer
- unresponsive WMS server (when opened in the browser dock)

I would like to be able to be able to cancel such actions, for example
wit the Esc key. Currently when this happens I have to kill the qgis
application which is rather extreme.

Would this require running processes in a thread, or is there a way QT
can listen for a specific event and cancel whatever is happening,
returning to a "inactive" application?

Hi Etienne

Thanks for the feedback, very much appreciated. I've fixed these issues 
in raster-pipes-2 branch now.

There are still a few things missing in raster saving:
- write colortable to output dataset
- format specific options (e.g. compression)
- dynamic populating of the format combo box (currently hardcoded to 
geotiff)
- progress indication for tile based saving and possibility to cancel

Regards,
Marco

Hi all,

it might be a good idea to implement a first test for as basic pyqgis
application as well as one of the core python plugins (e.g. gdaltools,
ftols).

This could serve as a basis for other plugin tests and reside in the
source (tests/src/python).

Hi Tim

Yes, mbtiles would be cool. I've decided to go with vrt/overview for now 
because mbtiles need a very recent GDAL. But mbtiles could be an 
additional option in future (especially interesting for mobile devices).

Marco

The gdal way or the qgis way? Eventually it would be nice to make
these 2 representations compatible.

I assume this would this be for enabled formats only?

I would be great to have this even if not saving tiles, if it's not
done already.

Threads can help, if you can't avoid to block, but other things can be solved
by switching from iterative processing to event driven processing (with or
without threads).

That's the "normal" way Qt does things, but as soon we leave the framework and
turn to external APIs like GEOS, GDAL, libpq etc. the intended (or just the
easiest) way there is iterative.  And therefore lots of stuff in QGIS is also
iteratively.  There are even a few places where event driven Qt stuff is
wrapped in a polling loop with QCoreApplication::processEvents(), when we need
event driven Qt stuff within iterative loops.

Although we could probably move all that blocking stuff into threads, that emit
signals whenever a blocking iterative loop within the thread continues.

So curring this would require major changes - also to the QGIS API. Add
complexity and also introduce new pitfalls (eg. race conditions, locking...).

BTW the threading branch was/is addressing some of these issues.

I guess then the pragmatic way to resolve these kinds of issues is to
spawn them in working threads and implement mechanisms for cancelling
it.
Is this possible with the current api?

For example - could the browser dock run in a separate thread? That
way, if it becomes unresponsive at least the app isn't.

> BTW the threading branch was/is addressing some of these issues.

Are you referring to the inactive dev-threading branch? Any plans on
reviving that? I think there was a discussion about that a short while
ago.

It just occurred to me that it would be a great thing to implement
this as a widget+class in QgisGui, so that it could be used elsewhere
(e.g. gdaltools, sextante).

Any way I can help?

You mean as a reusable widget like the crs selector? Yes that would be great!

Yes - I was also thinking about being able to define defaults for
saving rasters (default format, default compression + options per
format, tiles) which would be application-wide.

And this reusable widget could be pre-populated with these options -
and used in core as well as python plugins.  You would create an
instance of this widget, given a raster layer, and then be able to
save it.
I would see this as an expandable component inside each of the
gdaltools dialogs.

Well, there is generic Qt API - e.g. QtConcurrent or lower-level
QThread to implement such mechanisms.

At some point I would like to see this happen: when a user opens a
folder, the browser dock would spawn a thread that gathers the layer
information and once ready, it would signal that back to browser dock
and the thread would be closed.

As Juergen mentioned, such functionality is not for free: it is
necessary to implement some locking mechanisms that would avoid race
conditions (very ugly kind of bugs), and poorly implemented locking
leads to dead locks. That's why it is a good idea to keep the amount
of code that may be run in threads to a bare minimum.

In any case, operations taking longer time should be done in threads
and the event-driven approach is really a way how to move forward - I
hope we will get such functionality in future.

btw. The increasingly popular node.js (environment for server-side
javascript) is completely based on the event-driven I/O.

Yes, that's my GSoC project from some time ago... recently I've been
trying to revive it (again!), at least the important bits. Let's see
how that will end this time :-)

Actually the widget is in gui, so you could add a sip file and it should 
be available for plugins too.

Help is much appreciated, there are so many things to do.
It would be great if you can enhance the dialog and raster provider interface (create operation) with the capability of format specific options (and reasonable defaults).

@Radim: do you want to grant Etienne write access in your repository or do you prefer pull requests?

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SEXTANTE - GRASS MASK
Message-ID: <1342774146.24279.YahooMailNeo@web122306.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

One thing that I still can not understand on Sextant is how to get the Sextant working with the definition of GRASS Region and MASK. GRASS has a structure very rigid and defined in this respect, and now in Sextante I can not find a way of, for example, transform a vector layer into a raster, using another raster acting as Region and MASK, limiting all the processing to the limits and resolution of this raster.

Right now I can not find a solution to achieve this. One way to accomplish this could be by selecting a raster as a reference, which serve as Region and MASK simultaneously, in order to limit all the operations to this area. This is because most of the times the area of interest has a format different from rectangular which is now possible to define by the coordinates of the extremes (BBOX).

Could this be a solution? 

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Please keep in mind that other options have to be added to the dialog:
  * user defined null values - initially will be filled with layer
transparency values with 100% transparency

Should we use tabs?

Hi Etienne,

I don't think so - the providers probably don't like being called from several
threads at once - or lack an interface to try that to begin with (see threading
branch...)

> For example - could the browser dock run in a separate thread? That way, if

No, all the GUI is handled in the main thread only. Working threads would need
to communicate via signals/slots with the GUI (examples postgres provider and
fTools).

And as said that would need major changes - because all loops would need to be
split into several slots (examples in GPS detection and in the WMS provider for
WMS-C).

Yes.

Not on my end - no time.  Martin, who did it, probably has/had plans, but also
fell short of time.

> - Identify tool in a *very* large vector layer

this issue is really hurting, because does not affect just very large
vectors, but also small vectors with very complex (lot of nodes)
features.

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4819

The ticket has a patch attached and would be nice is someone of the core
devs can give it a look.

Cheers

I have set up a Jenkins job on my server[1] - it will run the tests
with each push to master. In theory it will notify offenders if they
break the tests by email but I havent had a case where I can confirm
that that behaviour works. You can also get an rss feed to the build
service (to get notices for each test run), or if you run android, you
can install a little widget on your phone that will show the current
status.[2] If you are configuring jenkins mood, set the url to [3].

Build results from jenkins are also automatically submitted to the
Dash hosted by OTB[4]

It would be really great to have others setting up Jenkins on
different platforms (mac & windows in particular), I will document the
configuration options I used for the job and put that in git soon.

The splash screen is complied into the resources of QGIS and currently
can't be changed at runtime.  If you need to change it you must
recompile QGIS.

It doesn't exist on the file system after QGIS is installed, it is
compiled into the application.

You can stop it using --nosplash but you can't change it.

When there are simultaneous requests to read some data, there are two
options what to do:
1. serialize the reads: the second request will be blocked until the
first finishes
2. do the reads at once in separate connections to the resource
(database / file / ...)

The threading branch used the first approach, so the threads would be
served one-by-one. In future the providers could be improved to
support the latter approach - that that will need further work.

Hi

By the way if you keep the Jenkins page open and your speakers on you
will get a nice audio affirmation after each build :-)

Hi all, 
one up for this topic. Since QGIS 1.8, memory layer saver is not working the
same way as in 1.7.4.
I raised a tickets here  http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6075
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6075 , but I think something changed in memory
layer provider or OGR GML provider, and it maybe isn't a plugin issue:

In fact, FID field was previously hidden to end user in QGIS but was present
in GML.  It was filled with "F"+id . It now is filled with
"projectName."+id. FID field is now shown to end user whic alterates table
structure when saving. 
Reopening project, saving and reoping a second time add a second FID field. 

Anyone has an idea of what's going on ? 

BTW *I'am really interested to have a stable way of saving memory layers
along with project.Anyone still working on it ? Having it part of the Core
would be great too. I am ready to sponsor it since it. * 
What solution should we keep? gml+xsd along with project? A dialog asking
what memory layers to save, and explaining what are thoses gml and xsd files
would be nice too. I have seen users cleaning up those messy files since
they did not understand what they were..

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS does not open Shape
Message-ID: <500964CE.6060503@fossgis.de>

Hi,

I have a Shape file which only can be opened by starting QGIS (1.8.0 on
ubuntu 12.04) and adding it as a vectorlayer. The opening fails when
trying to use "open with QGIS" from the context menu. The error message
in OGR protocol is "Datenquelle ung?ltig" and seems to come from 
QgsVectorLayer("test.shp","vector", "ogr") and may be fails with ERROR
10: Pointer 'hDS' is NULL in 'OGR_DS_Destroy'.

What could be the reason for that?

Tim, this is great!

Can this integrate with the various builds from qgis.osgeo.osuosl.org
- or is this one instance only on your server?
I guess it would have to be installed on the build farm?

I was thinking of initially providing a linedit for space-separated
key=value pairs, and then adding a more complex interface with various
format-specific options (like COMPRESS=NONE/DEFLATE/etc) and ui to add
other options (like in some of the gdaltools dialogs).

Is the idea to have this for gdal only, or other providers eventually?
It would be simpler for now to stick to the gdal creation format
(key1=value1 key2=value2), making it more generic might require
considerable work.
I was thinking of passing a QStringList of key=value elements to the
gdal provider create() method, which would be passed on to the
GDALCreate() as a char**  .

I think we could refine that when all parts are there, but it does
make sense. I would like to eventually have a standalone widget for
the options, so it could be reused (e.g. in the GDAL tab in the user
prefs). In this case it would be grafted to the main save dialog.

IMHO using tabs would be a bad idea as it would limit where we can use
it - if we want to embed the widget in another widget we could have a
situation of tabs in tabs which is a HIG no-no. Also have a look at
Guiseppe's dialogs in the gdal tools they provide a simple table for
the Key value pairs. One thing that would be really nice is to have
some default profiles:

- options for maximum read performance regardless of disk space
- options for minumum file size regardless of performance
- options for 'middle of the road' between the above two

The builds could in theory each be in a jenkins instance and triggered
for each platform in the same way as my server is doing it. At some
stage we could have vms or e.g. EC2 instances with each platform and
github can spawn builds on them, then shut them down again. Be a nice
project for someone with time on their hands.

Of course you are right - let's go forward and see how it integrates
later on. I was referring to those dialogs about the key/value pairs

Not sure if I understand correctly, but it might be a bit (or a lot

is useable with the active dataset.

I was referring to tif only in terms of the default profiles I mentioned.

Dear Community,

we have a new case study written by Monica Almeida. She is conservation
biologist working in a non-governmental organization in the preservation of
wolves in Portugal.

The case study is about using "QGIS and GRASS for modelling ecological
corridors for wolves in North Portugal". You can read it here:

Short reply:

- we dont have such a facility yet

Hi

I think the change in behaviour is due to the change in the gdal 1.9 implementation of the GML driver, which generates the fid field when the layer is reloaded.  I am looking at a fix that basically removes the field after it is reloaded.
Not an ideal solution (especially if you want a field called "fid").

On you other points on the memory layer saving, it may be worth reviewing the earlier discussions about the memory layer saver.

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2010-December/011876.html

I have a couple of times proposed that memory layers get saved alongside the project or within the project file.  Inside the project file is not a good idea - it could easily get too big.  

So the main question for the ideal solution is how to store the information.  I am using the GML format as a preferrred open format (preferred in this case based on responese on the qgis dev list).  I'm inclined to modify this to a format that uses a single file for all the layers as a cleaner implementation from the users perspective (eg if the project file is test.qgs then the persisted data is in test.qgs.db, or something like that).  The format could be spatialite perhaps, or a zip file of the gml files?  It would also get rid of the horrible long file names.

I see in your bug post that you have found that sometimes the layers don't get saved at all.  I haven't experienced this, but I did notice that if you start editing a layer, add some features, and then quit qgis without saving the edits, then there is no prompt for saving the edits.  If the edits don't get saved then the memory saver plugin doesn't flag the project as dirty, and so the changes don't get saved.  Could this match your example?

Cheers
Chris Crook

Hi all,
one up for this topic. Since QGIS 1.8, memory layer saver is not working the same way as in 1.7.4.
I raised a tickets here  http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6075
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6075 , but I think something changed in memory layer provider or OGR GML provider, and it maybe isn't a plugin issue:

In fact, FID field was previously hidden to end user in QGIS but was present in GML.  It was filled with "F"+id . It now is filled with "projectName."+id. FID field is now shown to end user whic alterates table structure when saving. 
Reopening project, saving and reoping a second time add a second FID field. 

Anyone has an idea of what's going on ? 

BTW *I'am really interested to have a stable way of saving memory layers along with project.Anyone still working on it ? Having it part of the Core would be great too. I am ready to sponsor it since it. * What solution should we keep? gml+xsd along with project? A dialog asking what memory layers to save, and explaining what are thoses gml and xsd files would be nice too. I have seen users cleaning up those messy files since they did not understand what they were..

Message-ID: <8B6005D6-1F0C-490C-90B6-09F26BEE2D9C@kyngchaos.com>

Twice today I've push a couple commits (last time was before the 1.8 release), one <100KB and one <1KB, and both times the push has uploaded 11MB.  Yet all that appears at github is the changes I made (as I would expect).

I wonder if it has something to do with the stale 1.7 and 1.8 branches on my computer?  Those keep giving me [rejected] notices and the push ends with an error: failed to push some refs.  I don't think I've made any changes to these that haven't been pushed (certainly not the old 1.7 branch).

Is there a way to un-checkout branches I'm no longer using?  I think I reset my 1.7 copy a while back so I didn't get push errors like this, but something got out of whack again.

The new freeze/thaw labeling tool works well on Windows and Mac, but
has a keyboard shortcut issue with Ubuntu. Since I have a source build
setup for Mac, and only update with nightlies on Windows and Ubuntu, I
would like some feedback on whether the following is a good shortcut
change, before I send in a pull request...

*Current*

freeze label: click or drag
thaw label: Shift-click or drag
toggle label state: Alt-click or drag
hide label: Ctrl-click or drag  (Cmd on Mac)

Alt-click or drag on Ubuntu is a standard OS shortcut for moving
windows, so doesn't work there without requiring users to override an
OS shortcut.

*Change to*

freeze label: same
thaw label: same
toggle label state: Ctrl-click or drag (Cmd on Mac)
hide label: Shift+Ctrl-click or drag  (Shift+Cmd on Mac)

Not using Windows or Ubuntu everyday, does anyone see a standard OS
shortcut problem with the 'Change to' set? Works fine on Mac, and the
new shortcuts on Windows and Ubuntu don't appear to do anything
specific to me when used within the map canvas and the tool is active.

Here's a patch for the change if you care to do a test compile:

you might want to try 'git push origin master' to make sure it just
pushes the master branch.

In any case - maybe fetch a brand new clone to make sure?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python unit testing for QGIS
Message-ID: <CALCNqkbpr7tCOfZfqb6o2pFET6OpAfXyr9dEaw43GdLW9nrSKA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks

Yes I know I am becoming something of a unit testing freak, but I am
10 000% convinced we really need to get a good test suite if we plan
to be a viable option for 'enterprise adoption' and generally not
wasting time trying to figure out what works and what doesnt.

Anyway, I have added the capability to add python tests to the CTest
suite (you know when you run make test / check / Experiemental).

I think building a python test suite is a no-brainer - it is where the
largest amount of developer activity happens and we should always know
that third party tools are working.

The nice thing is that you now don't need to be a C++ guru to write
tests. I am going to write proper detailed documentation on how to add
a new python test, but early adopters can check out the sample I added
here:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/b702d3ca9f1e577c1efd57decab972300de3b085#L4L-1

There are a few things that I would still like to resolve:

* you probably will need to set QGISPATH env var to match your CMake
install prefix
* you will probably need to set you LD_LIBRARY_PATH to your qgis libs dir
* currently I don't have 'in build dir' testing working

example session:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/qgis-master/lib/
export QGISPATH=/usr/local/qgis-master/
ctest -R App -V

I look forward to contributions, though maybe just experiment a little

part of the World Bank/AIFDR funded work that Marco and Radim are
doing, any python bindings or required python functionality will have
tests created for them too to verify that the functionality is
working.

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

You should normally push with: git push origin master

This will mean only master is pushed, it sounds like you are pushing
all your branches.  I also normally do: git push origin master
--dry-run to see exactly what is getting pushed upstream.

No need to reclone anything.  If you don't need the 1.7 and 1.8
branches just delete them from your local copy using: git branch -D
{1.8 branch name}

Ah, the branch -D option is what I want.  I think I may have seen this when looking at the documentation, but it sounded like it might affect upstream.

Hi William,

Not sure if you are interested in git GUIs on the Mac, but I have had
very good results working with github.com and the QGIS project
repository using SourceTree [0]. I have had very few reasons to go to
the command line since moving to it (I do commit squashing in
Terminal/BBEdit). Currently free, as well.

Hi Chris, thanks for your feedback. I start thinking using a spatialite is a
great idea. I prefer this than having rules to mask FID field. This can
generate very hard-to-find bugs.. 

Having a complex Qgs zipfile containing either a spatialite DB or xml + data
would be great but is a big evolution. IMHO, such a break should be kept for
a major version change in QGIS (2.0?). 

Is that a work you are on ? Need contributors?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Run Feature Action Behaviour
Message-ID: <1343037154399-4990012.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi again, 
I would like to have your opinions on a proposal.  We would like to modify
Run Feature Action behaviour, in order to get rid of our 
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/tags/hotlink%20action%20trigger/ "Hotlink" 
plugin.

The behaviour of those two equivalent tools differs:
 - "Hotlink" tries to copy Mapinfo . Just pick the tool, fly over features
and a tooltip appears filled with "display fields" of all underlying layers.
Then click on a feature shows a listbox filled with action name + display
field. Click on a line runs action

 - "Run Feature Action first requires to choose an active layer in TOC, then
choose the action you want in toolbar (dropdown menu), then click to run
action. If you want to know what feature is concerned, you need to activate
tooltips. Last thing, Run Feature action does not seem compatible with old
syntax of field expression (in 1.7.x %myfield, > 1.8 ["%myField Or
myexpression%"]

What we suggest, so that beginners can open a map and run action:
  - Modify Run Feature action to eliminate the need of choosing the action
in dropdow menu button. Add the functionnality of multiline tooltips and
action listbox under mouse click. 
  - Adds retrocompatibility for old syntax
  - use the same behaviour as "identify" tool : active layer, first layer
found , all layers. That would be more user friendly I guess.

Thoughts?

Hi,

Both ways offer pros and cons.  The current way allows you to select
the action once and just keep clicking without having to reselect it
again, using the context menu method however requires me to select the
action every time regardless if I don't the other 10 in that session.
However like you have seen the context menu can be easier for
beginners to grasp because there is only one tool and feedback is
instant.

One way I thing you could do to handle this is the ability to define
actions as standalone action toolbar buttons, so that certain actions
appear as their own toolbar button. You would define the actions like
normal but there would be the option to say "Make this a button". You
could then have a general action button that when used gives you the
context menu on click while at the same time having standalone buttons
so that you don't have to navigate the context menu if you am doing
one action repeatedly.    The action buttons would be optional, any
actions not marked as a button would just be rolled into the one
"hotlink" button.  E.g I would have a standalone button for say "Open
Photo" but for other less used things I would just leave them in the
context menu.

>   - Adds retrocompatibility for old syntax

-1 I think having two ways to define the same kind of thing the former
with the lack of expression support would be bad.  People will just
have to move forward to bring there projects up to the current syntax
IMO.

it seems to me that the way Hotlink runs actions is quite similar
to the Identify tool way:
first click on the map, than choose the action to run on one
feature.

The Run feature action way is exactly the opposite one:
first select the action, than clicking more times on the map
you can run it on more features.

The "added value" of the Hotlink is displaying tooltips, I guess.

Run feature action is in master since QGis 1.8, thus it uses the
new action syntax.

More in detail, the Run feature action tool itself doesn't know
anything about the syntax, expressions are just strings for it.
It's the actions evaluation that differs, it now uses the QGis
expression engine.

I broke the old behavior after asking on the dev ML [1], probably
if someone had replied to keeping it compatible than now you
wouldn't have this problem.

>   - Adds retrocompatibility for old syntax

not sure that is a good idea, there was the time for this kind of
request and now it's late, IMHO. But let's wait for other opinions.

>   - use the same behaviour as "identify" tool : active layer, first layer
> found , all layers. That would be more user friendly I guess.

I really do not understand how to run an action (which is defined on
a layer) on more/all the layers...

I still think the Hotlink plugin is quite similar to the identify tool:

1. Identify tool allows you to see full informations about the
features, i.e. all the attributes values and not the first one only
which usually is a non-significant number,
2. it open a non-modal window that you can move outside the
canvas and then click on the map more times without any needs
to close it,
3. you can choose the action to run on only one feature.

It's not clear to me why don't use the identify tool.
Have I missing something?

Regards.

Message-ID: <2198ffb98f81e2aa6052f54804139866@carto.net>

 Hi,

 In the context of the recent discussions around the hotlink plugin:

 Wouldn't it be fun if HTML would be supported in QGIS maptips and they 
 would be displayed with a Webkit instance?

 That way we could display images located on the web in the maptips and 
 we could also include little charts and our own text with the charting 
 library of choice on our webserver.

 I checked recently and it seems like rich-text formatting is supported 
 (e.g. <p/>, <br/>, <b/>, etc.) but not full HTML.

 Would it technically possible to display a Webkit instance instead of 
 the traditional maptip?

 Of course it would also be cool if the new expression engine would be 
 supported in the maptips ...

 Just dreaming loud,

 Andreas

Thanks for this guys, 
I may be wrong in my analyse, please tell me. 

A bit of context. We are trying to use Qgis for two usages:
 1- classical Desktop GIS for trained users: no worries, actual beahaviour
is way beyond Mapinfo or Arcmap.
 2- simplified viewer for beginners and our decision makers, that obviously
don't have time to get trained (I can't change it).   This is more often
served by a web GIS, but we don't have one for now, so we use QGIS and try
to stay simple with one tool (two in fact, we did not get rid of Mapinfo
yet). 

Native run action of identify tool is not immediatly seen by users. Our
users did learn with Mapinfo.. their habits are quite long to change, and
they love that yellow thunder icon (ArcMap uses it also..).. (I try to
change it ;-))

- Ok for retrocompatibility, it's too late and I wasn't following dev list
at that time. I understand that. But for future changes, we should at least
warn users and data adminstrators of such changes, or keep compatibility if
possible.  Upgreading from 1.7 to 1.8 in a company with a lots of projects
and actions will be more painfull since we have to upgrade all projects of
all users, or explain them how to do it. (80 frequent users .. ).

  It's quite simple, if there is only one action, under mouse clic, hotlink
directly run action, if more,opens a lisbox exactly like in Mapinfo. W

Identify tool requires user to expand "actions" in Identify window. This is
not understood by newcomers.  move windows if it floats on data, which
triggers a redraw

Seeing attributes is quite reserved to GIS men. For decision makers, we use
QGIS as a frontend to navigate between Geographic context (QGIS) and more
specialised web pages describing objects dedicated to users. For example: 
http://adour-garonne.eaufrance.fr/massedeau/FRFR217
http://adour-garonne.eaufrance.fr/massedeau/FRFR217   or 
http://adour-garonne.eaufrance.fr/station/05111620
http://adour-garonne.eaufrance.fr/station/05111620 . I want for them the
more simple tool possible. If not, they don't use it... 

I would say that identify tool could be satisfying if we  find a more direct
way to allow user to run an action.* Why not suppress action subfolder and
display actions on top of attribute list? *

 Picking a specific tool is not completly satisfying, exploring subfolder of
identify window isn't either.. The ultimate goal is what google does: only
one default cursor, actions directly on objects.. But we are in descktop
world, so I'm trying to find a compromise with a plugin, using a well known
icon, and letting user click directly on a feature.

That would be nice! 
Just add the ability to click inside that maptip (but how?) and we have
something like  OpenLayers / GMap /Gearth with vector features.. 
Sounds great..

Would it be best as a standalone, with qwt, or python with matplotlib?
Easiest short-term would be to port the plotting to matplotlib.

Also, is the raster interface going to change enough to break this plugin?

I agree that interaction with actions (sorry for the wordplay) should be
revised. Keeping the actions as an expandable node inside the identify
window makes them harder to find and, I feel, it generates to much
indirections.
I think that an action tool (something kike the cited "thunder" icons shown
in other softwares) would help.

Given the thread object, I relaunch the option to support another kind of
actions: one action for multiple layers. AFAIK it's missing, right?

layer   |   action
  1      |   many   (OK)
many  |   many   (OK)
many  |     1       (missing?)

The way to remove branches from upstream would be:

  git push upstream :branch_to_remove

-D only Deletes the _local_ branch.

Another thing you may want to look at is wheter "git push" should attempt
to push all branches or just the current one... It's a configuration.

I think these later three obstacles will be important to remove.
Running tests should be as easy as typing "make check".

Encode the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and QGSISPATH settings in a shell script
invoked by "make check" maybe ? But do I understand correctly those
two are not enough for "in build dir" testing ? Does that mean you 
need to install before running tests ? 

Great work, btw :)

IMHO this tool is worth to be integrated as a core plugin. But I know
that means a lot of work porting it to cpp.
I know a lot of things I would like to see integrated in ValueTool too
but I can only have some wishes as I am not able to do it myself ..

kind regards

agreed; it does not need to be ported to C++ to become a core plugin.

Not for now ! This would be nice but let's keep it for next year. 

   having a coherent Hotlink plugin with native tool was my immediate goal. 
We have some more urgent priorities like expressions for thematic mapping,
supporting labling new generation to remove the old one from layer
properties.. and some others.

configuration would be nice, I'm too lazy to type 'git push origin master', or remember to do so between my infrequent use of git.

...hmm, git config ... that's a lot of variables...

So:

git config push.default current

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Embed Perl Scripting
Message-ID: <500D7970.9080405@knowhow-la.de>

Hello everybody,

I've just started QGis-Python scripting which is quite straight forward.

But as I developed several GIS-database-applications (around 100.000 
lines of code) in Perl which I would like to interact with QGis I wonder 
if it is possible to embed a perl-interpreter into qgis like it is done 
with the python interpreter. As I have never done anything alike before 
I'm not sure about the amount of work I'd have to put into it. From what 
I read so far it seems not too much work(?).

So I would appreciate any comments and tipps (or even warnings) before I 
try to embark on a never ending story ...

regards Helmut

Could be a lot of work, but I imagine it's all about generating Perl
bindings to Qt?
http://code.google.com/p/perlqt4/

You could always just interact with your perl scripts via system calls
in python to trigger existing commandline functions exposed from perl.

Enjoy,
Alex

Message-ID: <1343065501.2298.36.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

I can see the "offset curve" under Linux, but not under Windows, am I
missing something?

I have also a doubt about how to use the tool:

when I click on a line on the bottom left corner of the QGIS windows I
see I can set manually the offset distance, but it doesn't seems to have
any effect. I'm again missing something simple?

cheers

Folks,

I have developped matplotlib support for the valuetool plugin, if qwt
is available it is used as default, but there is an option to use
matplotlib instead. Could people please test it so I can release it,
perhaps as experimental?

It's at the plugin repos http://qgis.org/git/valuetool.git

I have released a version (0.3.6)  with some other bugfixes in the
plugins repos today.

Etienne

Etienne, I can't seem to clone from that url:

Sorry, I posted the read-only url without testing, seems it doesn't
work - same thing for other plugins like atlas plugin at
http://qgis.org/git/atlas.git

Can someone please fix this? I have no idea what the read-only git url
is supposed to be.


The developper git repos is at
gitosis at qgis.org:valuetool.git

and the repos browser is at
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/valuetool/repository

In the meantime, I added a zip file at
http://hub.qgis.org/attachments/4719/valuetool-0.4.0.zip

0.40 seems to work fine [0]. Tested on Mac 10.6.8, latest master
build, using Kyngchaos.com's matplotlib 1.1.0-2 Python package install
[1].

[0] http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4058089/qgis/valuetool_0.40.png
[1] http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/python

The 0.36 update causes a crash when checking the graph choice. The
subsequent dialog about building stats will not go away (keeps
returning), eventually leading to a QGIS crash.

that's odd - did this happen just after update, or also in subsequent
qgis runs?  Did not see any of that on linux.

Anybody else have that problem?

Marked 0.3.6 as experimental for the time being.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bug? Python plug-in threadS seem to run only when
	Python console is busy.
Message-ID: <9q0liia9koq.fsf@gmx.us>

All:

I am writing a multi-threaded python plug-in. It is meant to slowly
extract data from NLDAS-2 for selected features using OPeNDAP in the
background as I don't want to block GUI.

It seems that the thread I create in my plug-in is mostly dormant unless
I have something like time.sleep(alot) running in Python console. Is it
normal? I even tried to start QThread with QThread.HighPriority with the
same result:(

The module itself runs just fine when started outside of QGIS.

Am I not supposed to create threads in python plug-ins? I thought it
would be better rather than trying to dig around QCoreApplication to
process events so GUI is not frozen.

I'm running OSGeo4W versions of QGIS 1.8 on Windows XP SP3 32 bit if it
matters.

Embedding the interpreter itself is probably not a big task, much more
time is necessary to provide bindings of QGIS API to Perl. For Python
we have used SIP and PyQt, I am not sure if such tools exist also for
Perl... probably SWIG would be of some use.

 Hi Giovanni,

 The availability of the curve offset tool depends on the GEOS version 
 used by QGIS.

 You need at least GEOS 3.3x - I believe the current Windows builds come 
 with GEOS 3.2.x

 Hi,

 I don't have the capabilities to do the work. But if someone is willing 
 to work on it I would support the effort by testing and potentially also 
 financially.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Expression Builder Questions
Message-ID: <c1cf6aaa27451305a84fcbab7ce8b0a5@carto.net>

 Hi all - esp. Nathan ;-),

 I have a couple of questions regarding the expression builder:

 1. Would it be possible to add a $scale support which we could combine 
 with CASE ? This would be quite powerful to add condiditional labeling 
 depending on scale ranges.

 2. Is there a rounding function available other than toint() ? I 
 envision something like PostgreSQL round function: 
 http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/interactive/functions-math.html where 
 one can specify the number of digits one wants to round to.

 3. Is there a string formatting function available that allows to 
 format longer nunmbers for better readability? E.g. 1000000.00 would 
 become 1'000'000.00

 Thanks if you have any idea/feedback on these three issues.

 Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] reading times shapes over network difference
Message-ID: <500E54AC.2070703@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

somebody pointed me to the following observation:

Opening a shapefile (375555 features, 156Mb dbf) *over a network* 
connections between two remote locations (VPN SDSL connection 10Mbps) 
seems te show HUGE differences between QGIS and other desktop gis's (all 
Windows):

Opening the shape untill the full rendering:
( 375555 features, dbf 68 MB):
QGIS 1.6	2'31"
QGIS 1.8	2'30"
ArcGIS 9.3.1	0'18"
ArcGIS 10.1	0'17"
DivaGIS		0'24"

( 132733 features, dbf 162 MB):
QGIS 1.6	5'07"
QGIS 1.8	5'00"
ArcGIS 9.3.1	0'07"
ArcGIS 10.1	0'07"
DivaGIS		0'07"

When you open the same files locally QGIS is as fast as the rest.

Does somebody else see this behaviour?

Does somebody have an explanation for this?

I haven't checked/debugged into it myself, but one explanation of 
somebody was that maybe arc* and diva* only fetch the shp file first, to 
be able to render as fast as possible, and only get the dbf file when 
needed (or maybe in a different thread or so).

Is that possible?

Thanks for any input.

Richard Duivenvoorde

 Hi Richard,

 I don't have a solution or explanation, but the Province of Vorarlberg 
 (which is migrating a lot of users to QGIS) has similar issues.

 I don't know if they have a solution already or if they are 
 investigating with Sourcepole.

 Hi Giovanni,

 In the box you have to type the distance value and press enter, then it 
 will set the value to the exact value you typed. But you have to make 
 sure that the mouse is still pressed and not moved. I agree - it is a 
 bit difficult to use. Do you have any better suggestions?

 The reason why the box is in the bottom left, is that on Linux there 
 can't be a box following the mouse cursor (some XServer limitation). I 
 believe that on Windows and OSX the input box follows the mouse - but I 
 cannot test it since my Windows version still has the GOES 3.2.x

 Marco Hugentobler is the developer of the tool - maybe he can comment 
 on the issues he faced while developing this tool. I am sure he is also 
 open to suggestions for improvements.

Hi Andreas,
this raises up once more a long-standing question. I'm pretty sure there
is a bunch of people willing to donate small sums for the solution of
specific issues. We currently are unable to channel this, essentially
because we miss a web app to manage it. An attempt has been made:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Sharing_QGIS_development_costs
but it is difficult to find, and is all manual.
Any suggestions? I think if we can solve this, we'll empower our users,
make it easier for devs to allocate time to QGIS, and the development
will go even faster and smoother.
All the best.

Hi all, 
a point of view , I hope this can help other potential supporters:

 In France, public authorities, which are great GIS users, can't contribute
outside of  a public market. Donation is not possible for us. Sponsorship
can be, but more on communication budgets, that GIS admin can't use in
general.  All we can do for contribution is open a puiblic call for offers,
make notations on price and technical criteria, based on a precise list of
functionnalities we need to developp (or bugs we need to correct). 
Making a public contract is quite long and administrative work. It is long..
very long, so it is not easy to follow QGIS developpement speed.
My organisation is trying to accelerate that process with a global market
with some QGIS contractants, some are contributors. We put money saved in
stopping Proprietary GIS support every year. We give a bonus if an evolution
is OK with the community and is pushed into Trunk or commited Plugins. 

That explains the only way some users have to contribute to QGIS. That's why
I'm pushing some evolutions requests theses days.. we are trying to prepare
the right contracts...


Keep on like this guys, this community is great. 
R?gis

Hi R?gis,
agreed, there are many different kind of QGIS users. Power,
institutional and enterprise users are already contributing by directly
contracting developers and firms, and I expect more will swarm in soon.
I believe we should also intercept the needs, wishes and willingness to
contribute also from individual users and small business, both for
financial, social, and development reasons: being very close to end
users is one of our strengths, IMHO.
All the best.

Possible yes, however I would like to see proper rule based labelling,
like the rule based rendering, implemented instead as that would
achieve the same thing but with more power.

Yeah this can be done.  I'll add it once I get some free time.

Sure this is doable as well. I'll have a look into it.

Anyone else is free to have a go if they already know how, I'm pretty
busy at the moment so no ETA on the above functions.

Hi all.
I think this topic is worth of attention: we will probably have to wait
a while to release e new version,because of API breakage and raster
changes, so in the meantime users should be able to have their plugins
fixed, even if they are core.
This couold be as simple as copying the plugins to the new repo, or
there is a better approach?
All the best.

 Hi Nathan,

 Thanks for the reply.

 It is not so urgent for me - and I agree that the scale issue would be 
 better solved with rule-based labeling.

I'm a +1 on this proposal.  I think having the core plugins in the
repos is important so we can provide updates between QGIS versions.

How do we keep the core plugins in sync in master and the repository?

J?rgen,

Couldn't we just develop them in master and push to the repository
when ready with the plugin uploading script that ships with the
Plugin Builder?

When people upgrade to a new version of QGIS they get a automatic
upgrade or the plugin.

I think that makes a lot of sense - but need to make sure that new
versions still work in older api.

Message-ID: <CA+TxYvOXUoN7eMsbRVdizTvK6sNmfJLiS18wbH4i3ccb09N3Hg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

the read-only urls for the git plugin repositories is either wrong, or
the git server is broken.

For example, the main page for the valuetool plugin lists the read-only url as
http://qgis.org/git/valuetool.git

Similar for other plugins:
http://qgis.org/git/atlas.git

But a git clone of this repos gives an error

$ git clone http://qgis.org/git/valuetool.git
Cloning into 'valuetool'...
fatal: http://qgis.org/git/valuetool.git/info/refs not found: did you
run git update-server-info on the server?

However, the developper url works fine
gitosis at qgis.org:valuetool.git


cheers,
Etienne

Um, if it's not clear anyway, I meant "less painful" :)

Right - so we'd need to maintain (more) legacy stuff in master only for stuff,
that is not in master - because master includes the current version of the core
plugins anyway.

We probably should simply release more often - and get that process as lean as
possible, instead of putting work into making long release cycles less
painless.

I'm not sure the above 'stable release' scheme will work - although it sounds
much easier that the earlier attempts ;)

Hi Andi, Giovanni

Yes, on Linux, the backbuffer/resize bug on X11 in Qt (still present in 
4.8) prevents to have the box moving as widgetitem over the canvas. On 
Windows/Mac, the box moves on the canvas with the cursor.

Another idea was to have the interface for the offset tool similar to 
the measuring dialog.

Regards,
Marco

For the rounding issue: as a workaround, you can do some ugly things like  toreal(  toint( X * 100)) / 100

Sort of a little late in the discussion - but would it be possible to
use an external parser so that most mathematical functions would be
supported?

Hi,

try-ing to compile a qgis-server version of qgis ,
from latest svn version of qgis and using
this settings:

with_bindings OFF
with_desktop OFF
with_mapserver ON

I'm having this error:

I never seen this error before, probably miss some new dependencies.

Any hint on this ?

agreed, release often is A Good Thing.
unfortunately in the near future I guess it will not be possible, as the
major changes to raster imply we need quite a bit of testing and
polishing before releasing.
all the best.

Martin and I did talk about this but we decided in order to allow full
control over the syntax we should have our own.  My ultimate plan is
to have Python support any where  QgsExpression is used currently,
labelling, rule based rendering, etc.  Using Python would allow you to
use the full power of Python with full PyQGIS and PyQt support.  That
is the plan anyway, no ETA at the moment.

Concerning replication of the core plugins to repositories at
plugins.qgis.org, maybe setting up each as a git submodule would help
with this? While this will add complexity to the git setup, it allows
for independent (but shared) repository commits and pushes to multiple
remotes.


>From the user's point of view, getting updates to core plugins comes
through Plugin Installer, which keys off of the plugin's version
number. This leads to several circumstances that need addressed.

* Core plugins replicated to plugins.qgis.org need to have a higher
version number than the version that shipped with latest stable QGIS
(obvious), to trigger the update.
* Upon a new stable release, core plugins need their version bumped
again, or the user's latest 'interim' core plugin update will mask the
new stable version, since user-installed plugins of same version take
precedence over core plugins.
* When plugins become accepted to core their version number needs
bumped for the same above masking reasons.

Not sure what type of versioning core plugins should have, but for the
last circumstance (accepted to core) the plugin's version needs to be
higher than that previously used (so using QGIS's version number may
not work for some, initially).

My point here is that users should seamlessly receive update notices,
regardless of how the update occurs. I think that requires standard
plugin versioning, unless I'm missing another method.

Larry

Hi all

I think it would be a good move to merge the raster-pipes-2 branch back 
to trunk. Ok, I know more instabilities, things to polish, etc. But in 
trunk, it receives more attention and people are more motivated to work 
on it.

Any objections?

Regards,
Marco

I'm not sure whether it is buffered IO or actually dormant thread
causing all the troubles.

The ugly workaround just to make it ticking is to set up 5 seconds
QTimer in main GUI thread after auxiliary thread is started and use
time.sleep(10) and QCoreApplication.instance().processEvents() in
timeout handling slot. The GUI does block during that thus rendering
entire idea unusable.

The bottom line is to create C++ plug-ins for multi-threaded tasks :(

It happens on GNU/Linux is well.

I forgot that QTimer uses ms while sleep uses seconds. 2 seconds QTimer
and time.sleep(.1) in handling slot _without_ processEvents() make
everything work just fine.

Apparently this statement is not quite correct.

Maybe your qwt lib is too old?

I've been out in the field for few days, sorry for coming late to this part of
the discussion.

MacOSX: The axes of the graph are drawn, but the following message:
"There are no statistics in the following rasters:
TTC1312v2
Calculate?"

is displayed over and over no matter the user answers Yes or No.
The user has to bring the message outside the map area (over the
Layers list) but then either answering Yes or No Qgis crashes.
If the user does not answer the message over the map area but brings
it to the Layer list area and then
answers either Yes or No, the graphic is displayed and the plugin works.
The matplotlib option is not present.

Linux (ubuntu 11:04). Plugin version 0.4.0
Works fine with both qwt and matplotlib, although much faster with Qwt
(but speed is not
a concern here, the graphics are displayed for thinking a while).
Answering Yes or No has the same consequence: the stats are calculated
and the graph is displayed

Linux (ubuntu 10:04): will test tomorrow at the office.

Many thanks!

Agus

Yes, actually this is why I thought it had been included as core in 1.8.
But meanwhile, having a plugin is a very good solution. Also, we can
use the plugin as a testbed  and discuss
different improvements, like customizing the axes.
The table is not enough, you need a graph as soon as you have more
than 3 numbers...

This seems like a mac problem, Larry reported the same problem with
0.3.6 (without matplotlib) but not with 0.4.0

Sorry but I don't have a mac, so it's hard for me to fix this.

> The matplotlib option is not present.

that's because qwt is not found - so it uses matplotlib. If qwt is not
found, but matplotlib is, then it uses qwt and there is no choice.

I didn't really look into the performance of matplotlib vs. qwt

I'll look into that - probably related to the bug you experience.

I guess yes.

My qwt is 5.1.1.

Unfortunately this is the version available on redhat (i'm using it).

perhaps is allowed disable it for a qgis-server only compile ?

All other test environments use high qwt versions, that's why it was
not caught.

Qwt is a serious pain to support, because of so many different API versions...

My advice for now: comment-out the offending line(s), it won't do much
harm - the min/max picker will probably not work.

I don't know anything about qgis server, but shouldn't some gui stuff
be disabled when building only qgis server?

Etienne,
thx for hint.

I tried to comment it
but compiling there is this other error:

>/home/archivio/tomcat/software/qgis/Quantum-GIS/src/gui/raster/qgsrasterhistogramwidget.cpp:
In function ?QString
>findClosestTickVal(double, QwtScaleDiv*, int)?:
>/home/archivio/tomcat/software/qgis/Quantum-GIS/src/gui/raster/qgsrasterhistogramwidget.cpp:841:
error: ?max? was not
>declared in this scope
>make[2]: ***

Error 1
>make[1]: *** [src/gui/CMakeFiles/qgis_gui.dir/all] Error 2
>make: *** [all] Error 2

So I following the same ideas , try to remove the code comment all this
functions:

findClosestPickVal ,
QgsRasterHistogramWidget::histoPickerSelected( const QPointF & pos )
and
void QgsRasterHistogramWidget::histoPickerSelectedQwt5( const
QwtDoublePoint & pos )

After this there was no errore at compile time, but I have an error at
linking-time

If you comment the function, you will get link errors because the
function was not compiled. Just comment the contents.

I'll try to fix this today and commit to master - are those the only
errors reported?

Hi Mikhail

It has to do with Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The main GUI
thread holds the lock all the time, that's why code in other python
thread does not run. Doing something in python console helps because
when python runs any commands, it releases and re-acquires the lock
every now and then - but when it does not run, the lock is being held.

If I remember correctly, I have managed to solve this issue (with some
more) in threading branch by calling PyEval_InitThreads() and
PyEval_SaveThread() from QgsPythonUtilsImpl::initPython(). Other c++
functions doing python API calls then have to always acquire GIL and
release it afterwards with PyGILState_Ensure() and PyGILState_Release(
gstate ).

These changes probably have to be ported in order to have working
Python threads in QGIS, e.g. from Alex's port of threading branch:
https://github.com/alexbruy/Quantum-GIS/blob/adopt-threading/src/python/qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp

QGIS server itself does not need the gui library, only core and 
analysis. But it uses the data providers and the provider libs can use 
dialogs from gui lib (e.g. WMS provider lib uses QgsNewHttpConnection). 
Of course those parts of the provider libs are not used by the server, 
but the gui lib is still needed to link.

Marco

FWIW: I've been playing with submodules and I found them to be a useful
tool to track external code while still keeping control over exact version
to use.

No opinion about using submodules for qgis plugins: not sure I see
the rationale for it, and I'm afraid that would mean forcing developers
to use "git" for their work...

Hi all.
Would it be feasible/resonable/useful  to add it to sample data?
Unure CC by-nc-sa/3.0/ is suitable for our data set, however.
All the best, and thanks.

+1 for me also

It would be nice to discuss how the file save as dialog should be
organised, and how much of it could be reusable.

I think that a first candidate for using the file save as dialog
components would be gdaltools - see the modified merge tool.

Some elements might not be necessary in all use cases.  For example,
we could have an overviews section (line in the gdaltools overviews
tool), but it would not be necessary in other dialogs.

In the case of the full-blown "save as" dialog, all components could
be present, but with a ui to hide/display them (with something like a
toolbox, tabs, collapsible comboboxes).

What I have done for the format options is make is a standalone
widget, and it is included in the file save as dialog and gdal
options, as well as in the gdaltools dialogs (overviews only for
illustration). Would we want that for every component, or perhaps have
a single widget with optional sections that can be displayed according
to context?.

cheers
Etienne

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Changing the structure of the SEXTANTE repository
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7xkedHivdZ3wEdnHQdRXD7byT-r+VnV+He_p+pefBCg7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

As you might know, there are now two main version of SEXTANTE: A Java
one, used by several GIS apps, and a Python one used by QGIS. They are
rather different, and they coexist in the SEXTANTE repository (the
QGIS version can be found in the "bindings" folder). The structure of
the SVN repository was created when there was only a Java version, but
might not be the best one now, and can confuse users and developers.
For this reason, we are thinking about making a small change and
putting two folders in the root folder of the repo: "java" and
"python", so it is easier to find the version you are looking for and
they get clearly separated.

Before doing that, we would like to hear what you think. If you have
anything to say, please tell us, so we can do this in the best
possible way. Suggestions are more than welcome.

Thanks in advance

Victor

Hi Victor.
Is the java version going to work with gvSIG only, and the python one
with QGIS only?
In this case, it would probably be more clear to rename the folder with
the name of the program they refer to.
All the best.

No, the Java version will work with all the other Java apps and libs,
as before (that is, OpenJump. GeoTools, etc)

Does the python version depend on the java version (is it really just
a "binding") ?

No, it does not. That is why it does not make sense to have it along
with the Java part (which has several binding between SEXTANTE and
other apps, but in the Python version the architecture is different,
since it works only with QGIS)

Do they share other parts to recommend having them in the same repository ?

No they do not share anything, technically speaking. But they share
the name of the project, which makes things a bit harder. They can be
considered as two versions of the same software in different
programming languages.

+1 for having the Python version in a separate Git repository somewhere. 

It can keep the same name, or PySextante if you want to differentiate.

Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
A different name would probably also help packagers...

hmmm why is there a read-only url that appears in the plugin pages
then?  IMHO github is a much better solution - which is probably why
the main qgis dev goes on there

thanks for the information,

Hi,

They should reside in separate repositories since they are separate
project. And since qgis development is on github, it would be easier
to have it there (for others, maybe not for you). Qgis used to be in
svn, and unless I'm mistaken all history was migrated over to git.

PySextante sounds like a good name.

BTW, if I remember correctly, there were some discussions about
integrating SEXTANTE into QGIS as core plugin. Maybe it is time
to do this?

For me SEXTANTE is stable enough and anyway we are on API
break now.

Hi all,

I had a conversation with Radim about cleaning up the rasterstats
interface in qgsrasterlayer, he is going to work on this soon as well
as make some improvements.

Tim - do you have the time to merge your changes to avoid duplication
and conflicts?

Also, I was wondering if any stats-related functions in qgsrasterlayer
should be removed entirely or kept for backwards-compat for some time
(and internally get the result from rasterdataprovider)?

Hi .. yes I don't like masking the FID field and I'm not thinking this is a long term solution, even before the problem in my implementation with the field index issue (which I think I will be able to fix).  I'm looking at a couple of options over the next few days .. and open to any contributions, suggestions, code, etc :-)

Cheers
Chris

Hi Chris, thanks for your feedback. I start thinking using a spatialite is a
great idea. I prefer this than having rules to mask FID field. This can
generate very hard-to-find bugs..

Having a complex Qgs zipfile containing either a spatialite DB or xml + data
would be great but is a big evolution. IMHO, such a break should be kept for
a major version change in QGIS (2.0?).

Is that a work you are on ? Need contributors?

Chris,

did you try setting GML_EXPOSE_FID to NO before opening the GML as we 
discussed on the GDAL trac system ? This should fix your issue without much 
code, basically calling CPLSetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID", "NO") (or 
gdal.SetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID", "NO") if you're coding in Python) before 
doing the OGROpen() call with the GML file.

Actually, to avoid "polluting" other portions of code, you should save the 
original value and restore it afterwards, so :

in C/C++ :

char* pszOldVal = CPLGetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID") ? 
strdup(CPLGetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID")) : NULL;
CPLSetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID", "NO");
OGRDataSource hDS  = OGROpen(....);
CPLSetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID", pszOldVal);
free(pszOldVal);

in Python :

old_val = gdal.GetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID")
gdal.SetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID", "NO")
ds = ogr.Open(....)
gdal.SetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID",old_val)

And to avoid confusion, yes, you should also avoid that a user creates a 'FID' 
field.

I think it is better you make your changes the branch I have the work
in is largely defunct with all the work going on in raster so I will
just pick out any useful bits when I have time.

Now is the time for radical changes....just document them on the API
breakage wiki page [1]

Subject: [Qgis-developer] fTools dev - write to any ogr format or to memory
	layer
Message-ID: <CAK4yQTnKDDT1K2TCfkLFPODrLeHeYes-MfJRmy-=GgwMJryc-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Thanks for the support earlier in the month when I was asking about how to
improve the fTools plugin so that it can save to any ogr file format. I
have now had the time to get up to speed with the qgis documentation and
have had a quick play with the code.

In my original question I was provided 2 solutions:

1. Nathan W suggested that I change the plugin so that it writes to a
memory layer (I've got this working in a test case).
2. Giuseppe S pointed me in the correct direction to allow saving to any
ogr format (I believe I could do this)

Question: Which is preferred? Is the memory layer quicker? How does the
memory layer compare when working with large datasets?

To me it seemed odd that the fTools was asking to save the result to a new
file (after all I was asking for some geometry analysis), but a memory
layer has to be manually saved otherwise you risk loosing it. If someone
can point me in the direction of a snippet of python that would pull up the
Layer->Save As... window that would be awesome. Otherwise if this is not
possible, in order to have a save dialogue at the end of the plugin
execution you would be looking at implementing save to any ogr format
again!!

All thoughts welcome,
Rob

Thank you, Nathan. I will most certainly be needing help along the way.

I will be documenting on the wiki a proposed process for taking QGIS's
many GUI components from their current state to a more cohesive,
adaptable, finished-looking, and HIG-compliant tool set for version
2.0. I welcome any and all input or help towards the goal of making
the 2.0 GUI as user-friendly, functional and efficient as possible.

I have mentioned some preliminary goals here:

Hi again

When I originally was proposing saving the memory layer (as a built in function of QGIS rather than as a plugin), I was thinking of streaming the data out and back using a QDataStream.  It would have minimal overhead, unlike say converting to GML, or storing in an SQLite database.  Also it would mean loading data into another format and then copying back into the memory layer, as is currently done, as it would just be read sequentially into the memory layer.

On the down side it would have no use other than for reloading the memory layer data.  I got some feedback suggesting that this was not a good thing ... why was I creating another spatial data format. 

However I'm now wondering if that is a better way to go, since in addition to the minimal overhead, it also makes the plugin independent of potential changes in other components, such as the OGR GML driver in this case, which could change and break the functionality.  Also it removes any concerns about the data being altered as it gets passed into another format and back again.  The QDataStream is a versioned format, so it should be easy to ensure compatibility with future implementations of the Qt framework.

If the user actually wants to use the data outside of QGIS, then they can save it the format they want from QGIS.  The purpose of the memory layer persistence is to allow the user to close the project (possibly move it), open it again, and not lose their data - basically to be able to carry on working without having to worry whether or not their data is in memory layers or other forms.  (This is how I think QGIS should behave by default).  The plugin is not intended to save the data for other uses.  Given that the default behaviour of QGIS (without the plugin), is to discard the data altogether, I think it is safe to assume that this is not seen as a requirement!

So what I'm considering is rebuilding the plugin to read and write the memory layer data into a single file, say project.qgis.mldata, instead of the current multiple gml files.  

Thoughts?

Chris

Hi .. yes I don't like masking the FID field and I'm not thinking this is a long term solution, even before the problem in my implementation with the field index issue (which I think I will be able to fix).  I'm looking at a couple of options over the next few days .. and open to any contributions, suggestions, code, etc :-)

Hi Chris, thanks for your feedback. I start thinking using a spatialite is a great idea. I prefer this than having rules to mask FID field. This can generate very hard-to-find bugs..

Having a complex Qgs zipfile containing either a spatialite DB or xml + data would be great but is a big evolution. IMHO, such a break should be kept for a major version change in QGIS (2.0?).

Is that a work you are on ? Need contributors?

I didn't really follow this thread.  But the subject made me wonder if anybody
ever mentioned/explored sqlite/spatialite in-memory databases[1] and their
backup facility[2]?   Would that be an option?  Maybe even as replacement for
the memory provider itself.

Hi Chris,
please consider that much the same problem applies to other plugins,
especially Sextante and GDALTools. Now that we are going to have a Save
as... facility also for rasters, this could also be included.
So a solution designed only for fTools seems suboptimal.
All the best.

Looking forward to see your improvements (much needed, especially for
some dialog, very difficult to use).
All the best.

Remove completely, I think, but wait a moment, I am working on stats/histogram.

Embedding is certainly the cleaner solution than disabling sections.

Having a specific memory storage have pros and cons that you explained very
well Chris.
 From a user point of view, one drawback is that if something goes wrong in
memory layer loading whe project opens, or on memory layer save, data is
lost. So User will for sure ask for a "Add memory layer" provider.. because
they will try to reopen that dataset they see with their project.  
That's why I prefer SQLlite, already easy to open. It stores vector or
raster, is compact, no install...  BUT, we will be dependent of that tool
and associated libraries, that's true. 
My bet is that Spatialite will be a MANDATORY tool for people who don't have
postgis access or skills. One simple argument: it store long field names,
and is fast.  So QGIS should stick close to spatialite as much as it does
for postgis. If we all agree on that roadmap, it would not be so risquy to
choose spatialite ..
Hope this helps..

+1, with a preference for https://github.com/qgis as repo location. I promise 
the first pull request within a week...

I lost "What will be in QGIS 2...." discussion due to offline holidays, 
but it's good news that one person will take care of GUI and HIG 
coordination efforts.
You can count on me with toolbars optimization and icons tuning.

Hi all.
On current master, self packaged on Debian, I cannot find the OWS entry
in the browser. A colleague is seeing it on Windows. Is this a general
pattern (a bug), or is a local problem?
All the best.

Hi,

In general I like the new icon set, because the icons look slicker and
clearer.

But I just noticed this inconsistency between the "Map Navigation"
toolbar and the print composer. The pan tool in the "Map Navigation"
consists of four arrows into all directions. In the print composer it is
one arrow with a square behind it.

Personally I'd prefer a hand-icon anyway, because I got used to look for
a hand-icon when I want to pan something (I think this is what most
GUI's use?). But the icons should at least be consistent. Or is there
any reason for this?

Regards

Hi Matthias and Tim,

As I can see, switching off ML subscription during holidays is not a 
good idea ;)

You are right. We should select just one of them. One arrow seems for me 
at this moment better choice. Expanation - below.

Hand is the most popular, but I wanted to have some simple sign which 
could be used also in "action" (bottom right) part of icons. In this 
case hand is too complicated. That's the reason.

Robert

I was wrong and those are two different functions - pan (in navigator) 
vs. move and pan in composer.
So 'one arrow with a square' in composer should be replaced with 'for 
arrows' from map navigator.

sorry for noise ...

I don't know much about the memory layer handling - but here are some thoughts:

I think J?rgen's idea makes a lot of sense: keep in-memory spatialite
database, and save/restore when the project is saved/opened. And the
user can export the layer to a preferred format if he/she wishes.

Perhaps this could be added to qgis core, as a plugin or c++ ?

I also think having spatialite as a required dependency is not a problem.

We are designing the raster save as in a way that could be re-used
elsewhere, perhaps vector saving could follow the same route -
although not much (nothing) can be shared between the vector and
raster dialogs.

This might lead to much more complex code - with a UI file and class
for each component. Any ideas on how to streamline this?  Perhaps keep
all the c++ code in one file, and have a base class for all components
that has initializing, getting result and signals/slots?

Hi Robert,

I like the consistent look of your icon set. The results of Tim's poll
clearly show many wish to switch to your set right away [0].

Since QGIS is icon- and toolbar-heavy in overall look (in default
configuration), whatever you can do to improve the definitive visual
change from the old default icon set to a new one will greatly help.
This way users will clearly 'see' why the switch was made.

Just as a suggestion, what do you think about converting your icon set
to 2.5D from their current 2D version? I have attached two quick
mock-ups to illustrate, essentially adding just enough drop shadow to
have the icons 'pop' a little more from the toolbar. Too much shadow
effect and it starts to degrade the sharpness of some thinner aspects,
meaning a single shadow calculation won't work across the set.


Also, there has been discussion on condensing some icon groups down to
one entry icon that has a popup menu (Qt's InstantPopup or
MenuButtonPopup [1]). A few toolbar icons use this now, e.g. Feature
Selection tool. Using that technique and condensing functionality into
better dialogs (see Nathan's import dialog [2]) will go a long way
towards thinning the current icon-heavy look.

When considering condensing such items care has to be taken not to
introduce extra clicks for tools that should be only one click away,
e.g. Pan and Zoom tools. Though group entry icons are very similar to
menubar menus at that point, they have the added advantages of being
language-agnostic and visible when users switch to full screen mode,
which usually hides the menubar.

So, there may need to be some new icons made that represent tool
groups, though some discussion on condensing tools has to happen
first.

Hi, 
my opinion is somewhere between Larry's and Yve's.. 
GIS theme has two main drawbacks IMHO: 

1. Global render of toolbars is a cold blue - gray, in opposite of all QGIS
relate support, that are colorfull (sites, GUI). It looks very old school
GIS to me.. My wife, who likes painting, and sometimes uses QGIS at work,
clearly vote for current theme..
2. Shapes of icons are too 'edgy' and complex to me, so difficult to read 

With some projected shadows, more contrasts and colors... that coud do.. But
I find current theme closer to "QGIS" spirit than GIS theme.. 

Just a thougth, GIS zoom tools are leaning to the right, whereas current
tools are leaning to the left. I find it.. strange (I right hand writer).
;-) Am I alone?

The shadows look quite nice for me. The larger issue I have is that
many of the icons are just hard to recognise when you see them lined
up side by side.

My argument against these is that they defeat the purpose of icons
(making functionality available with single click). It takes two
clicks to invoke an action from a menu so in my mind the use case for
popup tool buttons should be restricted to where those tools need to
indicate a toggled state (like the map tools). A secondary
consideration is that when I give training courses the selection popup
toolbutton is something that novice users struggle with and it is not
very discoverable. Your points for it are interesting, though I
suspect that the number of people running qgis fullscreen is extremely
small.

Tim

Hi all.
Now that there is much work on refactoring the raster classes, wouldn't
it be the right time to implement a series of colour ramps to be
applied, instead of having only the current ugly blue-red one, based on
equal intervals? The 1-band plugin is a very good guidance for this.
The current situation is painful, as the pseudocolor no longer works
without creating classes, choosing interpolation, etc.
All the best.

I was thinking about that, we could leverage the existing colorramps
for vectors.

We should probably refactor QgsVectorColorRampV2 as QgsColorRamp, and
if need be create 2 subclasses (vector, raster).  We could probably
use existing dialogs pretty easily also, and do the same.

Unless there is a fundamental difference between existing vector color
ramps and raster color ramps? Also, color ramps are tied to QgsStylev2
class, can this be related to rasters?

I would colunteers to so this work - I just need a little guidance on
overall implementation details.

That would be great, merci Etienne.
In this case, I think we should add several ramps that, although useful
for both, are really necessary for raster (e.g. DTM). See 1-band plugin
for a very nice set of ramps, and classification methods.

I agree, most color ramps available for vectors would not be very useful
to theme raster maps. It is really needed a set of specific color ramps,
as in the already cited 1-band raster plugin, that includes also the
ramps available in GRASS and many (but maybe not all) the ramps
available here

http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/

Adding this functionality would fix a long standing issue

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/782

a very painful issue indeed for who works with raster data and need to
produce thematic maps.

Thanks in advance

I tried the 1-band plugin and was impressed by its features, but not
by its stability or interface (sorry...)


I would start by adapting existing c++ methods for rasters, with room
for improvements by others.

Is there anything in the vector color ramps that should NOT be
available for raster color ramps?
Starting from that base would give at least a consistent UI and
framework ,adn at least colorbrewer that give some flexibility.

Anyone object if I rename the core and gui classes? This would break
some api stuff, but it won't be the first.

I think they will not hurt, and often can be useful. Of course, if you
are going to implement >20 ramps, a classification/tagging/tree method
will be necessary, to help users navigating to the best one.
All the best.

Beware that many ramps have a meaning only when applied to absolute
values (e.g. DTM), not on a relative (0-100%) scale. This is true for
both, probably more often for rasters.
All the best.

Hi Even

Thanks for the suggestion and code examples - very helpful. I haven't followed up on this yet partly because this has prompted me to look at other storage formats for the data (something I'd been putting off).

If I understand the GML driver documentation properly then I would have to manage the possibility of the user having a field called FID, as after I've saved the data, then reloaded with GMS_EXPOSE_FID set to NO, that field will be lost? As you suggest, renaming the fields before saving and then after reloading would fix handle this.

Cheers
Chris

Chris,

did you try setting GML_EXPOSE_FID to NO before opening the GML as we discussed on the GDAL trac system ? This should fix your issue without much code, basically calling CPLSetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID", "NO") (or gdal.SetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID", "NO") if you're coding in Python) before doing the OGROpen() call with the GML file.

Actually, to avoid "polluting" other portions of code, you should save the original value and restore it afterwards, so :

in C/C++ :

char* pszOldVal = CPLGetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID") ? 
strdup(CPLGetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID")) : NULL; CPLSetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID", "NO"); OGRDataSource hDS  = OGROpen(....); CPLSetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID", pszOldVal); free(pszOldVal);

in Python :

old_val = gdal.GetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID")
gdal.SetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID", "NO") ds = ogr.Open(....)
gdal.SetConfigOption("GML_EXPOSE_FID",old_val)

And to avoid confusion, yes, you should also avoid that a user creates a 'FID' 
field.

Reusing interface components is good if you can do it. No it is fine
to break api - just keep track of changes in the headers and on the
api breakage wiki page.

If a user creates a 'fid' field, then that one will be used to set the fid 
attribute of the element. It will not be "lost" strictly speaking, but indeed 
if GML_EXPOSE_FID is set to NO, then it will not be visible.

> As you suggest, renaming the fields before saving and
> then after reloading would fix handle this.

Not sure to understand you here : are you speaking about the mechanism for 
saving the old value of GML_EXPOSE_FID, setting GML_EXPOSE_FID=OLD, calling 
OGROpen() and restoring the original value of GML_EXPOSE_FID ? If so, this 
will not change anything about the behaviour with a user field called 'fid'.

The intention here was not to interfere with other parts of QGIS that might 
manipulate GML files. For example, if a user opens a GML file through "Add 
Vector Layer", he might want to see the fid reported.

Good points.  I'm thinking perhaps the solution is to use Sqlite/spatialite (don't get me wrong - I like and use spatialite a lot).  But perhaps use the python spatialite driver directly, rather than the QgsVectorFileWriter class as I am currently doing, as I cannot see any OGR options for writing multiple layers to a single sqlite db.

I have a version working using the QDataStream, which goes well .. It shouldn't be too hard to modify that to use spatialite. 

You also mentioned losing data completely .. Is is possible that this was data that hadn't been saved before QGIS was closed (ie you were still in editing mode).  I think this may be a QGIS bug in 1.8.  On ubuntu I am finding that QGIS does not prompt for for uncommitted edits.  I'm sure that it used to do that..

Cheers
Chris

Subject: Re: [Qgis-developer] Memory data provider persistence

Having a specific memory storage have pros and cons that you explained very well Chris.
 From a user point of view, one drawback is that if something goes wrong in memory layer loading whe project opens, or on memory layer save, data is lost. So User will for sure ask for a "Add memory layer" provider.. because they will try to reopen that dataset they see with their project.  
That's why I prefer SQLlite, already easy to open. It stores vector or raster, is compact, no install...  BUT, we will be dependent of that tool and associated libraries, that's true. 
My bet is that Spatialite will be a MANDATORY tool for people who don't have postgis access or skills. One simple argument: it store long field names, and is fast.  So QGIS should stick close to spatialite as much as it does for postgis. If we all agree on that roadmap, it would not be so risquy to choose spatialite ..
Hope this helps..

Concerning color ramps, it reminds me of an article I read about
thematic maps and cross-tinting by Tom Patterson (creator of Natural
Earth) [0]. While his technique uses Photoshop, it brings up two
interesting questions:

Is blending two color ramps (maybe from different data sources)
possible on-the-fly in QGIS?

And, is it possible to set a blending mode for a layer? Qt supports
blending modes in its painting engine [1], but I only see alpha
blending (transparency) supported. Example of needed use: create
hillshaded or thematic raster (overlay) from DEM, import above other
background layers, set overlay layer to blend mode in layer properties
(e.g. multiply for hillshade).

Hi Even

Sorry .. lost wasn't quite correct.  The point is that my code for saving some users data and then reloading needs to take account of whether they have a field called fid or not if I want the list of fields unchanged after saving and reloading the data.

Either I have to record somewhere that the fid field is real (ie was in the original data set), and set the GML_EXPOSE_FID accordingly so that it appears in the reloaded data, or alternatively rename the users fields an a reversible way before I save the data so that none of the saved fields can be called fid (eg prefix all fields with "u_" for example), and set GML_EXPOSE_FID to NO.

At least that is my understanding of the way the driver works now?

Cheers
Chris

If a user creates a 'fid' field, then that one will be used to set the fid attribute of the element. It will not be "lost" strictly speaking, but indeed if GML_EXPOSE_FID is set to NO, then it will not be visible.

Not sure to understand you here : are you speaking about the mechanism for saving the old value of GML_EXPOSE_FID, setting GML_EXPOSE_FID=OLD, calling
OGROpen() and restoring the original value of GML_EXPOSE_FID ? If so, this will not change anything about the behaviour with a user field called 'fid'.

The intention here was not to interfere with other parts of QGIS that might manipulate GML files. For example, if a user opens a GML file through "Add Vector Layer", he might want to see the fid reported.

Hi Paolo

This is about saving the persisting the data in memory data provider layers, which by default is discarded when the project is closed (although the layer definition is in the project file, all the data is lost).  It is not related to fTools.  It is specific to the memory data provider. 

However having a common storage area for project related data does sound a very good idea.  At the moment the solution for the memory layers is leaning towards an Sqlite storage, say in a file called project.qgis.mldb.  However this could be held in a common sqlite database, provided we respect a table naming convention.  That would certainly make sense for users wanting to move projects around.

Is that the sort of thing you are thinking of?

Cheers
Chris

Hi Chris,
please consider that much the same problem applies to other plugins, especially Sextante and GDALTools. Now that we are going to have a Save as... facility also for rasters, this could also be included.
So a solution designed only for fTools seems suboptimal.
All the best.

Well, you could do it, but I think you're infliciting yourself too much pain, 
but it's up to you as you're the coder ;-) Personnaly, I'd just prevent the 
user from creating a field called "fid", saying it is a reserved name. But your 
solutions would certainly work.

FreakOut also broken. Should we fix them or with discussed new

Freak out and pseudocolor are just two special cases of color ramps. I 
don't think it makes sense to implement anything special for those two 
cases only.

Excellent stuff. I think one area we should really focus in on is the
creation of a library of reusable widgets that address common memes in
QGIS's user interface. There have already been various discssions to
this end but the idea still lacks momentum. There are numerouse
benefits:

- write once use many is efficient use of programmer time
- fixing a bug in one place fixes it in all uses of the widget
- we can write tests against widgets and know that given ui
functionality is working
- we can register them as designer widgets to better enable drag 'n
drop interface design and limit the number of lines of manual UI
construction code we have

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Map canvas flickers
Message-ID: <1343387287.21351.25.camel@kk-mobile>

Hi all,

there is this issue report #4011 "Map canvas flickers when content is
dragged" which is actually pretty annoying and doesn't get much
attention. ( http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4011 ) I think the solution
would be pretty simple. Please read on.

It was introduced by f4d26d6211830a866030a333236dcfbf15e077aa "Fix for
resize crash, ticket #2714".
This bugfix disables backbuffering, what fixes the crash but leads to
the beforementioned flickering.

The crash seems to be related to Qt versions (probably 4.6 and 4.7
affected). When I tried to reproduce the crash in 4.8.1 (by reverting
abovementioned patch) I couldn't reproduce the crash. So it is well
possible that this problem has been fixed in Qt upstreams.

But: I myself never could reproduce this crash (due to the lack of a
system with old Qt libs). So, I would be happy if someone familiar with
this problem could confirm that this is fixed with Qt 4.8.

Then there are two possibilities (unless you come up with a third one):

1. Check for qVersion upon every repaint as suggested by Martin Dobias
and then enable/disable the workaround accordingly.

2. Switch the workaround on/off by a pre-compiler constant. This way,
any new distro with Qt>=4.8 could be shipped without the workaround-code
being compiled into the binaries.

Any comments on this issue are very welcome, as it makes QGIS look a lot
sweeter :)

Regards

Hi Matthias

I still have the resize crash with Qt 4.8.1. To reproduce, load a layer 
with many objects. Go with the mouse to the right corner and resize 
several times without releasing the mouse. After the mouse release, the 
crash occures.
Note: this problem (and the flicker with the workaround) is X11 only. 
But still, Linux is the most important platform.
Btw, the threading branch would be the clean solution for the issue. But 
if you have another workaround in the short-term, let me know.

Regards,
Marco

 Hi,

 I can also confirm that I have this very annoying flickering in Linux 
 Ubuntu / KDE - and it is really embarrassing when showing QGIS to 
 someone. The work on the threading branch should hopefully be done by 
 Martin (and others for the providers) until the end of the year. Then we 
 should have a good solution to fix the problem.

Hi Marco,

thank you for verifying and advises on how to reproduce. I missed the
part with "without releasing the mouse"

I have created a patch that resolves the issue here. Can you please
check the patch and commit it if it works for you as well.

Thank you,
Matthias

I still have the crash with the patch (Qt::WA_NativeWindow) on my

Recent changes by Radim was to remove entirely statistics-related
functions from rasterlayer. While this is good in the
medium/long-term, I was wondering if we should not keep some of them
around for some time (as deprecated).

I am referring to hasStatistics() and bandStatistics() - they could
remain as wrappers for the providers functions.

I am concerned that some plugins will require a certain number of
tests for different apis, and it may be early to remove entirely some
basic functions.

That site lists several formats - which one could we use easily? SVG
might be the obvious choice.

http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/notes/formats.html
http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/notes/software.html

There are ready-to use zip as well as .deb files, which contain .xml
files for each collection
We could present available ramps in a tree-based interface, based on
the xml files.

We might be able to import the entire dataset inside qgis eventually,
but as its quite large (4MB), it could be better to add it as an
optional dependency (has .deb and .zip packages) - either a package or
have the use specify the directory where the zip was unpacked.

Hi all,

I've pushed to master a simple fix to allow to use the color ramps
from vector styles. It works fine but is limited to current ramps.

Here I were I think things should go, comments are welcome:

- rename "Singleband pseudocolor" to "Singleband color ramp"- although
not sure about that.
- deprecate or remove the QgsFreakOutShader and QgsPseudoColorShader -
they are not used anymore. Is there anything there that should be used
elsewhere?
- rename all the VectorColorRamp classes and widgets to ColorRamp -
this has the potential for disruption but makes things clearer,
because the color ramps can be used by both

- find a way to classify/group/tag color ramps so we can browse them more easily
- add color ramps from 1-band plugin and cpt-city (cited by Giovanni)
- find a way to share color ramps, or make them easily available (see
other email on cpt-city)

Hi Nathan - is this for vector symbols only? Information I found about
this relates to symbols but not for color ramps.

Can you share a link to the GSoC work, including progress?

I found the proposal here:
http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/tecoholic/1

I want to make sure that any API changes I make (related to color
ramps only) will not cause disruptions to this work.

It was mostly focused on vector symbols but we have added support to
handle colour ramps, because they6 were for vectors too.  If you add
support for using the colour ramps in a raster layer we should keep it
all in one place.  We will just disable the line, point, region stuff
if you open the symbol picker from a raster layer.

Contact Arun at aruntheguy at gmail.com to see if there are any issues
with API changes.

Message-ID: <CAEMrtYrcO_G6vKpsphkNrt-FevWAdsZ9EdxLcdgE_x-_D2gTqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am working on 2-98% cumulative pixel count cut (raster stretch
min/max, stdev alternative). Adding that option into raster
properties, I found the "Load min/max values" (http://goo.gl/xl2Ti)
group a bit confusing, it was mixing method, extent and accuracy, all
in one group:
  * Estimate - accuracy
  * Actual - accuracy
  * CurrentExtent - extent
  * Standard deviation - method

Following QGIS HIG "Group related elements using group boxes" I added
groups for extent and accuracy (logically, there should be another one
for method, but that would result in another group header just under
"Load min/max values"): http://goo.gl/IfZbf
>From that widget it is clear I believe, what each checkbox means and
how do they work together. It is crowded, however.

I simplified it removing the groups and checkboxes for defaults:
http://goo.gl/4XmpR
It looks better but does not follow HIG and user must think more to
imagine what are opposites of "Current extent" and "Estimate".

Which one is preferred? Do you have better idea?

With 3 parameters as input, it is also impossible to have loading
min/max as an action in histogram tab (commented for now) until we add
all combinations.

I would vote for this one http://goo.gl/IfZbf as, like you said,
required less thinking on the users part.  It is also more explicit
then the second one as the user isn't sure what unticking "Current
Extent" really means.

I've voted for the GIS theme, though I share my opinion on icon size.
I work with various GIS and CAD software (both OS and commercial) and I've
always found a bit strange the default 24x24 icon size of QGis. Most of the
other softwares use 16x16 icons.
I know that one can change the icon size, but having just the 24x24 icons
the scaling produces blurs and keeps the icon padding proportions, while
with 16x16 it could be reduced to provide more room.

Here are two screenshots of Qgis with 16x16 icons [1] and one from a
commercial software with the same icon size [2]. Notice the different
spacing, and the crisp icons.

I suggest to package 16x16 version for the icons, and revise the icon
padding

I like bottom shadow icons. It should look nice with 24x24px and
bigger icons. For sure not with 16x16px. We can try it and make parallel 
set with shadows. The problems is elsewhere. To use is, this new version 
should be complete. Partial implementation is the worst scenario.

But does it really  mean if 2-98%, current extent and estimate are
selected that it will really do a 2-98 estimation on the current
extent? If yes then its my vote too.

Could you please point them out. I see this problem with "open

I agree with Tim. We should avoid grouping icons, unless there is very 
high usage frequency ratio (one icon used much, much often than the 
other). Good example is labelling toolbar. It should be grouped and 
included in some other toolbar. This optimization must be focused on 
beginners, as experienced users probably use more keyboard shortcuts.

24x24 icon size is result of some preliminary discussion and research.

Rescaling is not good idea, even from SVG. At this size scalability is 
very limited.

You are absolutely right. There should be additional 16x16px version. 
With very limited spare time my options are:
1/ Try to keep project's progress (GRASS and QGIS) and design missing icons.
2/ Make them nicer - more colourful, 2.5D, etc.
3/ Prepare icons for 16x16 and 32x32px

And I decided to follow this priority: 1 -> 2 -> 3.
I hope you understand my point of view.

Robert

Radim,

I also like the second choice, with extra grouping. Coming from the
perspective of someone who doesn't use the histogram features very
often, I found http://goo.gl/IfZbf to be fairly straightforward.

Also, the condensed version has multiple radio button groups within
the same group box, which I not only found a bit confusing, but also
would require further coding or sub-layouts to create isolated radio
button groups, whereas the extra group box layout does that
automatically.

My experience from Mac apps is the opposite from Giovanni's. Most apps
default with 32x32 (or sometimes larger) icons, with the standard OS X
Cocoa app toolbar customization of 'use small size'. That option
usually drops it down to 24x24, though the developer decides the size.
There is usually not a third choice.

So, for me, on my iMac with its too-large 27" screen, the opposite
scaling issue up to 32x32 also exhibits the poor Qt scaling (blurry).

In my own experimentation with Qt icon scaling, I have found scripting
ImageMagick or Photoshop to do the up/down-scaling, with or without a
bit of sharpening applied afterword, to produce better quality icons
than the Qt scaling. It may be good enough quality to preclude
re-creating your icons for the other sizes.

Another option is to design icons with fewer details and higher
contrast so that they still look OK when scaled (see MSSQL icon in
Giovanni's QGIS example). I believe this would also address the issue
of some icon groups looking too busy due to too much detail, example:
the 'Add * Layer' icons of your set.

Having multiple size sets for icons means some naming conventions and
coding to switch between the sets; whereas now, the code simply asks
Qt to handle the scaling by setting a toolbar's icon size in one call
(as an example). Another good reason to go with icons that can cope
with Qt's scaling: no code changes.

Switching between size sets also means any third party icons (e.g.
plugins), that don't provide multiple icon versions, will have their
icons scaled. This would end up with users seeing different quality
between core and plugin toolbars, though I don't know how much this
can be avoided regardless of scaling issues. If moving to multiple
icon size sets, there might have to be an additional requirement of
multiple icon sizes for third-party plugins in the official
repository, if overall higher icon quality is desired.

So, my vote here for your icon set would be to go with only the 24x24
size, reduce the complexity of the most complex icons, increase
overall contrast where needed, and add any 2.5 effects to make them
pop a bit more (but not if such an effect causes the blurry scaling
problem or poor quality to occur).

Larry

I also agree that your first solution is the clearest one.
I generally avoid hiding the default options ore making the opposite option
of the one checkable by the user not evident.

Mantaining the autoscaling would certainly be the best option.
We need to find the right compromise to obtain sharp and clear icons for
all the scales. A hard task!
I don't know well the graphics features of Qt with SVG. I wonder if it
would be possible to obtain the scaling of icons spacing too. Whatever icon
size one chooses, the horizontal space between icons is 11px and the
vertical space between toolbars is 15px. It fits well for 24x24 but not for
16x16...

On double-check, I was incorrect about upscaling to 32x32. Qt will not
upscale an icon beyond its size when used in a toolbar [0]. Right now,
Robert's icons are not scaling up beyond 24x24. This means for a
single size set, maybe 32x32 should be the choice. Though, this would
mean at the default 24x24 all icons would be scaled, as many of the
default theme already are.

A quick check of setting size to 32x32 under the default theme shows a
mishmash of icons of 22x22, 24x24, and 32x32. Not very
pleasant-looking. If we go with one size for an icon set, the 32x32
setting should look good, even if it just adds padding around a core
24x24 set.

The QgisApp::setIconSizes( int ) method sets the icon size squarely
[1]. This could be adjusted rectangularly instead to provide correct
visual padding, relative to the icon size chosen, but it would have to
take into account the horiz. or vert. attitude of the parent toolbar,
and update whenever the toolbar was moved to the opposite
configuration. Probably best to stay with the current square
configuration.

There may be a simpler means of using QtStylesheets to adjust the
spacing between other icons and toolbar edges [2].

Hi Giovanni,

I made another wiki page for improvement ideas:

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/GUI_improvement_ideas_for_version_20

I also took the liberty of adding Tim's suggestion of a QtDesigner
widget library with unit tests.

All three pages are linked on the main Developer wiki page. I'm
thinking anything from mailing list exchanges or irc chats that should
be jotted down somewhere should go on the ideas page, with more
specific stuff on the audit page, when/were applicable.

After more response from interested developers, I don't see why we
can't call ourselves a team and note it on a wiki page. Maybe a
minimum of first and last name and irc handle, so that any user
looking to contact us knows who might be able to help them.

Right now, devs who have offered help or advice are:

Tim Sutton
Nathan Woodrow
Giovanni Allegri
Werner Macho
Larry Shaffer

Anyone further who can aid with multi-platform testing would be a
bonus down the road.

Regards

Larry

Just a note, because the majority votes for that with sub groups.

Not really, Current extent and Estimate have simply autoExclusive = false.

Hi,
apart the discussion about default theme, it is not clear to me where
to add a new icon. Current situation:

4 themes:
* default - is used if an icon in preferred theme does not exist
* classic
* gis
* nkids - deprecated, will be removed in 2.0 IIRC

defaultThemePath() = /images/themes/default/
activeThemePath() = /images/themes/" + settings.value( "/Themes" , "default" )

HIG: 9) Use consistent iconography. If you need an icon or icon elements, please
contact Robert Szczepanek on the mailing list for assistance.

For now, the images/themes/default theme is still default so a new
icon must be added first to images/themes/default, right? But, the
icons made by Robert can only go to gis theme. If I want to add a new
icon, I have to create one in default style and ask Robert for another
one in gis style? And classic?

General question, regardless which theme will become default, what
rules are for other themes? Each theme must or may contain all icons
from default theme? IOW, if developer wants to add a new icon, he must
add one to each theme or to default theme only? I believe that all
themes should be complete, otherwise alternative themes become almost
useless for normal users.

What does mean "Should we update QGIS so that the default themes is
the 'new' GIS theme, making the 'old' theme a secondary option?" in
the poll?
1) Change settings.value( "/Themes" , "default" ) to settings.value(
"/Themes" , "gis" )
    and defaultThemePath() to /images/themes/gis
2) mv images/themes/default images/themes/old
    mv images/themes/gis images/themes/default
Or something else?

She likes painting and sometimes uses QGIS? That suggests that she
would be capable to design new icons in current style? I am worried
that if we switch to gis theme, the current theme will be abandoned
and it will become awful with gis theme (as default) emerging in it.

I was actually going to make the slightly contentious suggestion that
we completely drop icon theme support becuase:

- we can focus on one really great theme
- we can great a more unified look throughout
- we can ditch code an maintain less code infrastructure

Probably there are more good reasons for and against. It seems clear
GIS theme is preferred theme for the future, why not make it the
*only* theme?

I agree with this. BTW If we look at other software, we'll see that only few
programs allows to change icons and often users even don't use this
capability.

+1 I was going to suggest the same - Victor if you are agreeable I
will start the vote process to get you commit access to the master

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SVG-Icons instead of PNGs?
Message-ID: <50150EC9.5060508@carto.net>

Regarding the discussion around the icons?

How about using SVG icons instead of fixed size png icons? That way one
could easily scale the icon sizes on different devices to the preferred
scale and taste of the user.

Are there any technical reasons for using PNGs instead of SVGs? I
believe the source of the icons is SVG anyway?

For my own in house python plugins I always use the SVG icons.

I agree too. The option to change theme is quite unusual in professional
software.
Having only one theme would let us focus efforts to make it at our best.

I ran into the same problem Radim did when I recently made icons for
the freeze/thaw label tool. I think the project should only support
one theme to solve that problem and for the reasons Tim mentioned.

I think having a complete set of functional graphic preferences (icon
size, font size, widget customization, etc.) to adjust to screen
size/resolution and one's eyesight is more important than supporting
user's ability to change graphic themes.

I've always kept the QTStylesheets in my to-read list. It seems a very
flexible choice.
I suppose that setting up its support in QGis would let us keep UI theming
loosely coupled from code. Is it right?

Hi,

I looked in CODING file and searched the list, but could not find...

Should all trailing whitespace be stripped from source files before commit?

I am finding both styles. My habit is to have it stripped by my editor.

Regards,

Larry

You should use scripts/prepare-commit.sh - that'll take care of indentation and
trailing whitespaces for C++ files.

BTW,

what IDE/editors do most people use? I use emacs with a custom c++

Hi!

As there are heavy changes in master right now and we do not have
enough developers to grant a good/bugfree backporting workflow there
was a the decision made on the last meeting in Zurich that development
is continuing in master and we try to "release" a new version out of
master sooner or later.

Depending on how long it takes to settle down all new features to a
stable state in master and releasing a new version there will
_probably_ be a bugfix version for 1.8 but I would not expect it.
That means 1.8 will be 1.8 as it is right now for at least some time..
until (hopefully) there will be a 1.9 (2.0?) with all the shiny new
features in it (which at that time should be reliably too).

If you want to help us stabilizing master .. try out master and report bugs ..

(I hope thats a short conclusion of the decisions made at the meeting
- if not please correct me)

kind regards
Werner

./qgis: error while loading shared libraries: libqgis_core.so.1.9.0: cannot

Straight on to 2.0 as we have broken API compatibility in all sorts of
interesting ways.

Werner thanks for information. I mean patches like this one [1], which
maybe does not depend on broken API.


Anyway, thanks for your work.

Dear Victor,

(cc'ed to dev list)

Thank you for fixing several sextante bugs I filed. Your response to bug
report is amazing.

I want to ask how often do you update the repository? Fetching the updates
from your svn is not a big problem for me but some of our users depend
purely on qgis' fetch repo updates within the app.

Seems safe to me. I guess it'll take a volunteer "1.8 branch maintainer"
to go on with this. Are you volunteering Ivan ?

The short answer is that we all agreed in Lyon that we will focus all
our effort on getting 2.0 out - we are a small team of people and we
simply lack the manpower to maintain multiple versions at the moment.
Hopefully this will change in the future once megacorp decides to
sponsor ongoing maintenance of stable branches etc.

Tim

I think it is not so simple as that - even if he maintains the branch
with backports, actually putting out the release will side track the
work of other project members....

Hi. Regarding having only one set of icons...

Recently, there was a fairly good consensus on having the next icon
for the app crowd-sourced, presumably with some coin available for the
designer. I think this is a reasonable approach to ensure a good
selection of high-quality designs to choose from. The icon is pretty
much the 'face' of the app, displayed in many more places than just
the file system.

(The proposal that follows is by NO means a reflection upon the
quality of work or volunteerism regarding the currently available icon
sets.)

I believe the project should take a similar approach to the app's GUI
icon set as for the app icon. There is an opportunity here for QGIS to
set the standard for graphic excellence in the FOSS geo community and
take the stance that graphics quality should match the quality of its
code. An attractive, inviting and functional look for the app's icons
and GUI will help ease the adoption of QGIS by new users as it becomes
even more popular across the globe. Other open source projects have
been at this crossroads before (Firefox, for example), and adoption of
high graphic standards has helped their project.

Towards this end I propose the project actively seek a handful of icon
designers, or croud-sourced designers, to submit selections of their
work for a subsequent poll by PSC and devs using the following
process:

1) Devs submit, to the list, examples of icons they like. This is an
important step towards understanding the 'look' desired for the new
set, and will narrow the range of icon styles submitted by designers.

2) A number of diverse icons from the app (maybe 10) are selected as
the base for icon designer submissions, i.e. the sample selection. A
short description of the function behind each icon is written up (in
case potential designers don't have a clue).

3) Hand-picked designers, who have done similar work, or crowd-sourced
designers send in submissions based upon the sample selection.

4) A poll is taken and the project moves forward with the chosen icon
set, possibly paying the chosen designer.

Parameters for submission could be the following:

A) Icons made will be under an acceptable and compatible license.

B) Designer agrees to support the icon set for a particular duration
(time- or release version-based). This would entail providing any
infrequent new designs for icons required for new program
functionality, and updating the look of any dev-submitted icons to
meet the quality of the chosen set.

C) Optionally, it could be required of the designer to place the icon
set in the OSGeo available sets.


Again, this is not a reflection upon currently available work, but an
effort to raise the graphics standard and provide a broader selection
choice for such an important decision. I understand the need for
parity with sister programs like GRASS, but being 'tied to' the
graphics of another project may not be a wise decision in the long
run, especially if the above process provides all OSGeo apps the
opportunity to use the new icons.

I'm happy of your email Larry. You anticipated me, because I was going to
propose the same.
I believa, as you, that the "face" of an application, with its user
experience design, is something foundamental as the quality of the code,
both for its diffusion and to expose its "behind the scenes"'s quality in a
graphical way.

I would add another evaluation parameter: the integration of the icon set
inside the QGis UI system. I mean, an icon set could be very cool but maybe
it could not fit the UI characteristics offered by the Qt system. A naive
example: a Ribbon style graphics will never integrate in the Qt.
This means that the icon set should, possibly, work well with the various
predefined icon sizes and fit into the toolbar spacing. (I'm beginning to
study the QtStyleSheet system next days).

Manning,

thanks for your support. I try to update it often, but that depends on
the new features added or the number of bugs fixed. I plan to release
a new version before the end of the month, since there are quite a few
new things and that is already an important difference from the
previous version

Regards

Victor

Most likely we will move the code to the QGIS repo, we are just
deciding a few things.

However, just a couple of questions:

1)I do not know if al SEXTANTE commiters are QGIS commiters. As Tim
said, I might get access to the QGIS repo, but will the others also
get it. I am particularly thinking about Alexander Bruy, who is
working on SEXTANTE and has many ideas. I do not know if he has write
access to the QGIS repo already...

2)I like the idea of releasing versions often. Do you think that I can
keep on doing that even if SEXTANTE becomes a part of QGIS? I do not
see new version of, for instance, fTools, being released independently
from the QGIS code, but the time between QGIS version seems too long
for me, specially considering the hight activity that SEXTANTE has
(and hopefully will have in the future as well)

Best regards

Victor

This is a general issue for all core Python plugins. I think we
generally agree we should make it automatic for users to upgrade their
plugins, core and non core alike, as soon as a new version is available,
but there are a number of point to be addressed to make the process
smooth and safe. See the thread on "upgrading core plugins".
All the best.

Other devs that don't have direct access always can submit patches or issue
pull-requests.

As for me, I'm already on board and I'll work on SEXTANTE regardless of
where it will be.

Users, that used nightly builds will have most recent version of SEXTANTE,
same for those who builds QGIS from sources.

For all others there are several issues as Paolo said. Few years ago we had
similar situation when GDALTools plugin was under development. Stable
version was in core and experimental with new features available from Faunalia
repo.

I agree this is the major point in all this.  Ultimately what we need
is a continuous deployment process where we can say "make 1.8.1 build"
and it grabs the 1.8.1 branch, fires up a bunch of VMs to build on the
different platforms, sticks the packages on the site or server.  I
have no idea how hard something that would be to setup but I think
that is the only way to maintain and deploy "X.X.x" releases.  Without
something like team members, like Tim said, are going to be side
tracked into that release rather then working on master.

Well I think anybody is eleigble to be a committer if:

- somone will promote them as a 'good person' (i.e. we can be
comfortable that their intentions are not malicious - either
intentionally or accidentally)
- they agree to our guidelines
- they have something to bring to the project

It's nice if the developer can adopt a specific area of the code base.

That said, in the case of SEXTANTE it would probably be IMHO simpler
for you to maintain a fork of QGIS, self organise (in terms of push
access writes to your fork) and then just push the aggregation of
changes over to QGIS when you are ready.

Alex already has commit rights to QGIS master repo so no problem there....

Just because the SEXTANTE code is in QGIS does not preclude you from
making independent releases too. A simple script that pulls your
plugin from the rest of the source tree and packages it up should do
it. What we (well speaking for myself at least) are really after is
that:

- SEXTANTE ships by default with each QGIS release (seems a no brainer right?)
- that SEXTANTE goes through similar polish process leading up to the
release so you can put out a 'best possible version' each release
- that SEXTANTE code is highly visible to maximise the number of users
and contributors to it
- that the SEXTANTE team get maximum motivation to do awesome stuff by
knowing their code is going to be a pivotal, embedded part of the
future of QGIS.

In the case of fTools you mention, I know that Carson (the original
author) has gotten busy with 'Real Life' and I do not think the
release rate of fTools is a reflection of the fact that the code lives
in QGIS' repo.

I also quite like the concept, but we need some feel for what it is
going to cost. It is going to be a bit of a departure for the project
to farm out a part of the work in such a direct manner, but not
totally incongruous to the idea of, for example, paying bounties for
bug fixes. If we have some kind of idea of how much money we are
talking about, perhaps we can actively seek a sponsor for the work.

With regards to departure from GRASS look and feel, personally I never
understood the desire for QGIS and GRASS to have the same icon set - I
would prefer that each application has a distinctive look and feel.

A couple of thoughts:

- we should require SVG icons throughout
- we should require building blocks not just icons. Robert has this
really nice concept of characterising the different actions involved
in QGIS with a standard visual vocabulary and I think it is a notion
we should persist with. In otherwords the product of the retheme work
should also provide the elements that graphical imbeciles such as
myself can pick up and use to make a consistent looking icon.
- we should look at the whole QGIS ecosystem and not only the icons
and try to gain a sense of graphical consistency across the board.
Some of my corporate clients have CI (Corporate Image) portfolios
which specify which colours, graphics etc should be used and in which
contexts. In the longer term this should be something we strive for
too.

Tim

 From my test and literature I found that simple vector scaling for 
small size icons (16x16 - 24-24) is not recommended. For higher images 
blur effect is not so visible and important.

The main technical reason was image quality. We decided to use already 
rendered images in "native resolution". I know it sounds stupid in 
Scalable Vector ... context, but that's the reality.
Whole version 0.1 of GIS icons was designed in just one SVG file. In 
version 0.2 I save them in separate files. So most of the icons is at 
the moment available as one file per icon.

regards,
Robert

This is first version of icons and I concentrated mainly on content. 
Content should be clear without colours.
1. Not everyone can recognize colours.
2. Colour should have some meaning, unless we make just nice images. We 
still don't have such colour table.

> 2. Shapes of icons are too 'edgy' and complex to me, so difficult to read

Sharpness was the assumption at this version, and icons were designed in 
final rendering size.
Complexity will be improved in next versions. I hope so.

I decided to use right bottom part of icons for actions. That's the reason.

This is only matter of decision and use of simpler version, without

Different folders could be solution if Qt's scaling won't work?

This is very important argument in favour of one SVG file.

Agree.

Thanks for information. If decision was taken in Lyon, it would be
better to keep concentration on master branch. I hope, I could be useful
in testing.

 Hi Robert,

 Thanks for the reply.

 Do you have a side-by-side comparison of SVG vs. png and the rendering 
 quality somewhere? I wonder if this is still an issue and if it is - how 
 much of a problem it really is.

 Having just one icon size instead of n different sizes also has a lot 
 of advantages. Think about all the new high-dpi devices. These would 
 benefit a lot from SVG instead of PNG.

Hi Andreas,

I made fast SVG downscaling test. Rendered with Inkscape.
Second column is shifted vertically by 0,5px.
As you can see main problem is "travelling blur" effect. Perhaps there 
are some smart renderers to overcome this.

I would also like to have just one SVG file...

Scaling SVG in Inkscapes is known to be problematic. Are you sure that this
applies to Qt SVG scaling too?

 I think it would be worth a try to use the SVG symbols directly - or at 
 least offer the option to use them.

When I get this error I run:
$ sudo ldconfig

and qgis is working. But sometime it is not enough.

As you built QGIS, you need to register before your lib dir 
/usr/local/lib/ in /etc/ld.so.conf file. You system will find all lib 
file in this directory.

Y.

Alternatively do this before launching QGIS:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/jack/apps/lib
/home/jack/apps/bin/qgis

This does not require root permissions.

James,

This discussion would be better for the qgis-developer mailing list.

To get started, are you talking about a C++ or a python plugin, and what
language is the Suds library in?

Thanks,
Alex

Hi all.

Just upgraded sextante, I'm getting back the old error:


Couldn't load plugin mmqgis due an error when calling its classFactory()
method

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qgis/utils.py", line 164, in
startPlugin
    plugins[packageName] = package.classFactory(iface)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'classFactory'


Anyone confirms?
All the best.

Hi Andreas, Giovanni, Robert and anyone else interested,

I have committed to master branch a preliminary test for SVG icon
scaling based upon Robert's icons. Ideally it should be tested on as
many platforms and devices as possible [0]. To test, please pull
latest master branch and compile, or wait for the nightly to come out.


Here's what I've done:

- Several PNG icons were switched out with SVG counterparts to test Qt
scaling on different platforms
- Added SVG icons to Default theme that are comprised of the regular
PNG embedded within
- Added SVG icons to GIS theme, mostly @ 32x32 and one @ 48x48 (note:
commit message is incorrect about 24x24)
- Testing with the supplied GIS theme allows for contrasting against
other similarly designed, preexisting PNG icons.

GIS theme Icons to test (with document, or page, size and description noted):

mActionPanToSelected.svg <- @32x32 (Pan Map to Selection tool)
mActionRotateLabel.svg <- @32x32 (Advanced labeling Rotate Label tool)
mActionSelectPolygon.svg <- @32x32 (Select Feature by Polygon tool)
mActionSplitFeatures.svg <- @48x48 (Split Feature tool)


To test:

1) Set your icon theme to Default. View whether each test icon looks
as it did before. This will verify whether SVG with embedded PNGs of
the original icons works with your version of Qt. (QIcon notes Qt 4.2
or > icon engine supports SVG.) If we wanted to move to all SVG source
files right now, this would provide an intermediate step for existing
PNGs that don't have SVG counterparts.

2) Switch to GIS theme and individually test the above noted icons at
the 16, 24, and 32 sizes.

- Test mActionPanToSelected by viewing in main menu, and as a toolbar button
- To test mActionRotateLabel, you will need a vector layer in edit
mode, and with data-defined rotation column. View toolbar button.
- Test mActionSelectPolygon by viewing it in the popup menu, main
menu, and as a toolbar button.
- To test mActionSplitFeatures, you will need a polygon vector layer
in edit mode, with two features selected. Also view in Edit menu
- Compare your results against mine [1]. Please share screen snaps of
any different findings.


My results on Mac, with Qt 4.8.1 and 4.8.2 [1]:

- Overall IMHO Qt down-scaling is better than that of PNG.
- SVG document size of 32x32 scaled to 24x24 (75%) showed some blurring.
- Qt will _not_ up-scale SVG toolbar buttons when setting the
toolbar's icon size, without doing so preprocessing first. SVG sources
used by the icon engine appear to be rasterized at their document
size, then later only scaled down when the icon size of the toolbar is
adjusted (just like PNGs). So, starting with an appropriate 'largest'
size for the SVG source seems to be key.
- Icons were pulled from OSGeo SVN repository and up-scaled in
Inkscape. SVG output from Illustrator CS5 could not be read.


Preliminary Conclusion

I think any single icon set, moving forward towards a 2.0 solution,
should be in the SVG format at 48x48 document size.

Marco B. has an issue ticket request for 48x48 size icons for use in
the QGIS mobile interface [2]. I think 48x48 document size scaled to
16x16 or 24x24 looks good and sharp, with only slight blurring at
32x32. So, 48x48 seems to work well for Qt scaling and addresses (at a
minimum) the mobile interface.
