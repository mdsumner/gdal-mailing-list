Hi to all,

why not have a similar approach to SLYR Community Version and a "Paid"
Version?

Nyall what is your experience of managing your plugin in both ways?

Other tools as lastools and whitetoolbox have similar model, they give open
core tools in their plugins and then if you want to use them all you have a
paid version for tools with support. In the case, of whitetoolbox they
release some of the paid tools based on sponsorship of companies very
similar to SLYR.

Nowadays there are a lot of qgis plugins in https://plugins.qgis.org/ that
use cloud services saying that are "free" ( to install and see source code)
but when the user installs sometimes you need to have a free API Key (limit
resources) or an API Key Subscription.

One of the things that I think that the plugin should have these days is a
metadata flag or the description says that you need to make purchases to
use the plugin.

Please forgive me if I missing some complexing behind this thought and if
I'm wrong on some points and correct me if I said something that is not
right.

Cheers
Jo?o Gaspar

Are you envisioning that this paid marketplace would provide sources at
the same time it provides binaries?  I would think it would have to, in
order to be really compliant.

Would you envision any social pressure for recipients not to publish
plugin sources?  I would say that even a little pressure would be
totally inappropriate.  One way around it would be to require that any
plugin have published sources before acceptance.

While you rightly point out that QGIS being GPL imposes a requirement
for plugin licensing, there is also the point that plugins would not be
possible without the base and we need to view this entire discussion
within the larger context of the social context of free software.

I sort of see your point, but not really.  Here, I am guessing that you
are mostly not talking about a situation where the value is the plugin
code and it is being unlocked by a fake subscription.  I suspect that
the real value is in the data available by the subscription and the
plugin is just plumbing to access it.  And that if someone else had
similar data, using the plugin as base code to access that other data
would be fine.

Or am I misunderstanding?  If so, the nuance is probably helpful to the
discussion.

In this case, is the source code really not available to the public?
If not, with 35k bought copies, then it's hard to believe that there
really is compliance, just from a statistical priors viewpoint.

How (and why) do you separate plugin developers from
  contributors to the core code
  contributors to docs
  packagers
  a bunch of other categories

?

Hi Greg,
This is a highly subjective conversation, and I am sure we can all agree on
that.
But in answer to you question about separating plugin developers from:
Core Code Developers: I guess Plugin Developers see an opportunity that is
outside core GIS Functionality - eg LandXML from Victoria (Australia)
Contributors to docs: I have been a documenter in my life and they create a
learning experience for others to follow
Packagers: I have packaged up my applications over the years and it seems I
still am packaging up QGIS Plugins
A good QGIS Developer must lurk in the background looking for ways to
justify the effort - at the same time looking for a possible return.
This is what I believe is the problem being discussed.
My two cents worth
Roger

Hi Nyall,

First, thank you for all that you have done over the years. You have helped
me a number of times in answering questions. Open source software is an
interesting beast. There is so much donated time without compensation yet
people need to feed themselves. My first QGIS plugin was in 2016 and I now
have 12 QGIS plugins that are published (several more that are
unpublished), but I am facing a dilemma. My work has funded all my
development except for one plugin which I did for myself. Unfortunately, I
was never really able to break into the ESRI culture here and a year or so
ago was told to stop doing further QGIS development and to focus on other
research. I did not find something that I liked as well so I am going to
retire (because I can) in May. So my dilemma is what is going to happen
with my plugins. I care about them. I have an agreement with another
organization to take over support but after the first meeting I have no
confidence that they will be able to do it. I will probably still fix some
bugs after I retire, but I am not all that interested in working for free.
I want to explore new hobbies in retirement so any QGIS work would be
minimal unless it also fits in with one of my hobbies.

I don't know how to get compensation in the open source world unless there
is a company who is investing in and developing open source software. It
would be nice if there were a mechanism for developers to get some
compensation.

This is a difficult topic to address, but I hope something comes out of it.

Best wishes,

Calvin

Hi All
The economics of this is very interesting.

As a community, we want to give something to our fellow members that they
need. It allows for our creativity in scratching an itch, and sharing that
solution. However, we can break the mold and work out a novel way to
deliver. The open-source pledge North Road uses goes some way to doing
this. Whilst there a lot of tools are within the licensed (paid) version,
those tools are available for release once production costs are met. This
enables the plugin to continue to deliver to those who cannot pay for the
licensed version, whilst funding further work as technology organically
develops or additional needs pop-up. Also note that the remuneration funds
our support for the FOSS4G community, whether via sponsorship or applying
resources on the committee. So the funding for the plugin gets recycled in
the community, as well as going someway to providing a living wage.

Shutting out people from the use of desired services should not be what we
are about - there has to be another way.

In regards to taking over a plugin, this is how FOSS continues, if someone
is passionate about it, they can ask the creator to take it over. As part
of the marketplace, the community should also have this as a service, a
page listing the plugins that are not maintained or won't be maintained and
is anyone available to take them over. This is a great way for up and
coming developers to learn the craft from mentors.

Keep the discussion going - this community is so creative that I think we
will come up with an option.

Cheers
Em

Hi all,
I have been sleeping over this thread a bit.

We already have a lot of paid plugins and in the psc we try to contact
vendors to have them aware of the GPL licence obligations. This is a lot of
manual work, and this does not scale up obviously.
Offering a marketplace in our plugin management system can be really
interesting, since this would give us a way to explain GPL obligations to
authors and offer them a place to advertise their products a lot better
than letting them deal with their own systems.

That said, the same question for QGIS.org general funding and
sustainability also applies.
We have been having a better fundings this year thanks to marketing efforts
of Marco and Andreas, which allows us to consolidate some tasks, but we
still live on a very low budget compared to the size of the project.

Ideas have been thrown about using existing marketplaces (Windows store for
instance) to collect regular incomes via notarized QGIS installers, but
this is not an easy move given that we don't have permanent staff to handle
with the administrative work this gives.
Developing our own marketplace for plugins could indeed be a way to let
users do a voluntary contribution to the project when buying a plugin, or
even trade a very small percentage on sales to maintain the platform. Most
payment associative tools I know always offer this possibility, I wouldn't
be shocked personaly.

If we keep a mandatory link to a repository in plugin metadata,  where
source code is available, I think we preserve users that can't afford to
pay. We might write down market place terms of use where we ask plugin
authors for fair uses (no ads, no illegal use, security rules etc, no fake
repository that would not really allow users to get the real source code..)

And I agree with Alessandro here, having public sources availables will
still let a large audience to the payment system. QGIS' audience is so
large.

All in all, this kind of system requires more efforts to maintain
everything in place, and I would be in favor of growing up the budgets to
have dedicated persons able to handle this, just like we already manage to
do with documentation and infrastructure management (Thanks Kartozo, Lova
and Selma, you do a great job)

In short, I would be in favor of going this way, but we need to handle this
as it is: grow up QGIS.org core to be able to handle those tasks. And
growing the budget is the first thing missing maybe.

Best regards
R?gis

I would say, why not?

Many other open source projects have opted by having "market places" and
paid plugins (e.g. Blender, Wordpress). This did not stopped many
developers to keep publishing free plugins, while allowed others to have an
easy way to sell their work.

Our plugin repository has now lots of plugins that are no longer working or
with bugs because the developer no longer have the time or will to maintain
it. Maybe if some of these developers could receive a compensation for
their time this could change.

Besides, QGIS is now very robust and offers so many functionality already.
Opposed to the past where some "core" functionality was depending of free
third party plugins.

Notice that there are already paid plugins. Some need api keys to work. And
other are being kept "secret" outside our plugin repository and they could
be useful for many more people.

All the best,

Alex

Thanks for J?rgen!
This got fixed in
https://github.com/jef-n/OSGeo4W/commit/5b059bb57c3776a2801f57d8fc8ec60ea882bccf
So behavior should be back to normal in 3.34.4.

Hi Nyall and other commenters on the thread

Personally I think it makes a lot of sense to allow payment for plugins via
the official QGIS plugin repo. A couple of (maybe contentious) ideas:

* can we put an Apple-like commission split so that QGIS.org takes 30% of
money coming from it? That will let us fund Lova into the long term and
other eventual team members to be paid to maintain the plugin
infrastructure. That will enable dudes like me who do backend work
maintaining the plugins services unpaid and unseen can fade into the sunset
and professional staff can take over the duty of keeping the plugins
platform going.
* Having a commission will also cover the cost of doing the accounting,
keeping track of who is owed what from their plugin sales, accounting for
everything, bank fees and what-not.
* We need to make it clear that QGIS does not offer any guarantees for
plugins sold (or downloaded for free for that matter) from the plugin repo
* It would be great to also invest into other long standing issues like
having plugin reviewers (or a clever AI scanner thingy) to make sure
plugins play nice on people's computers

Personally I would also like to have a 'hard opt in' for the plugin
installer shipped in QGIS. The first time you use it, you would need to
acknowledge that the plugins you get from the store may vary in quality and
their security from awesome to downright dangerous. If you do not agree
then the plugin manager link to the plugins repo essentially gets disabled
and you need to hand install plugins using the 'from a zip file' tab in the
plugin manager.

Probably more contentious would be asking those orgs fronting their
commercial services with a free plugin to give us (QGIS.org) a commission
too for the upstream services they sell, but I guess that would be a) hard
to enforce and b) bring out the complaints big time :-P

Regards

Tim

OK, given the progress made over the last couple of weeks I feel like
we're in a position now where we could start making Qt6 based "preview
releases" available for widespread testing.  How do we feel about
making non-default, non-recommended Qt6 preview releases of QGIS 3.36
publicly available? Is there any particular milestone we need to
achieve before we should consider this?

Hi Nyall,

This is great news, thank you all for the efforts.

There was a budget available for QT6 releases so I think it shouldn't
be a problem,  as long as the CI tests pass on QT6 we can make the
experimental builds available for testing.

Well, we're not at 100% pass rate on CI tests on Qt 6 just yet ?. I'd
estimate there's about a one week effort left to get the remainder of these
passing.

But it's at a stage where I'm confident that the majority of the remaining
disabled tests have Python specific issues we need to fix, and that they
aren't related to underlying c++ issues on the Qt 6 builds.

I want to say that I would like to see developers being fully supported for
their work on QGIS. As we know there are many ways to achieve this and paid
plugins is one potentially viable and useful way. I have seen the Blender
Marketplace mentioned a couple of times in this thread and I feel like it
is important to point out that it is not in any way associated with the
Blender Foundation or internally linked to the software. It is owned and
managed by a for profit company CG Cookie. Blender does have quite a few
add-ons that are included in the program but these are not allowed to be
paid add-ons or even link to paid services or other paid add-ons. I have
purchased add-ons from the Blender Marketplace and it works well and allows
for easy downloading of updates etc. Other add-on developers use Gum Road
for paid add-ons or Github for free add-ons. The Blender Marketplace has a
function for a portion of the purchase price to be donated to the Blender
Foundation to support Blender. Like QGIS the add-ons are required to be
under the same licence as Blender and are therefore opensource. As far as I
can tell the desire of the developer to have the plugin be a paid plugin is
respected by the community but does allow for the option of a hard fork if
circumstances require that.
Thanks
-Bas

Hi all,

As a developer inside a very ESRI centric large public organisation, this discussion is very interesting. Pushing my organisation to donate to a plugin developer or QGIS.org is just impossible. However, paying a fee to download a plugin is easy to justify, as it would to pay QGIS.org directly for a direct support (that could be sub-contracted behind), after all, we pay a huge amount annually to ESRI for no real support... So having a marketplace where paid plugin can be bought could let organisations like mine to provide some support plugin developers.

I?m not sure if I would want this marketplace being hosted by QGIS itself and being access through the current Plugin Manager. I prefer the idea of QGIS being clearly free? but at the same time maybe it?s not that bad if there is a mix of free and paid plugin at the same place, as long as it?s very easy filter. The obvious benefit of a marketplace hosted by QGIS is that a small commission could collected as Tim suggested. With a separate entity managing paid plugins, there is no way for QGIS.org to systematically receive a small donation as Sebastian explained with the way it works with Blender.

Even for free plugin, I see a way to increase the chances of a developer receiving a small donation. A ?Donate to Author? button could be added in the Plugin manager (on the left of the Uninstall Plugin button) and would be activated if the plugin author provides a URL to a new ?donation? entry in metadata.txt . A warning would need to be displayed as it would send the user ?somewhere? on the internet.

I also think that free plugin that require a paid service to be of any use should be flagged in a certain way.


Regards,

Jean-Fran?ois Bourdon

Objet : Re: [QGIS-Developer] [Qgis-psc] Theoretical discussion: A QGIS paid plugin marketplace? (was: sponsored plugin)

I want to say that I would like to see developers being fully supported for their work on QGIS. As we know there are many ways to achieve this and paid plugins is one potentially viable and useful way. I have seen the Blender Marketplace mentioned a couple of times in this thread and I feel like it is important to point out that it is not in any way associated with the Blender Foundation or internally linked to the software. It is owned and managed by a for profit company CG Cookie. Blender does have quite a few add-ons that are included in the program but these are not allowed to be paid add-ons or even link to paid services or other paid add-ons. I have purchased add-ons from the Blender Marketplace and it works well and allows for easy downloading of updates etc. Other add-on developers use Gum Road for paid add-ons or Github for free add-ons. The Blender Marketplace has a function for a portion of the purchase price to be donated to the Blender Foundation to support Blender. Like QGIS the add-ons are required to be under the same licence as Blender and are therefore opensource. As far as I can tell the desire of the developer to have the plugin be a paid plugin is respected by the community but does allow for the option of a hard fork if circumstances require that.
Thanks
-Bas

Hi Nyall and other commenters on the thread

Personally I think it makes a lot of sense to allow payment for plugins via the official QGIS plugin repo. A couple of (maybe contentious) ideas:

* can we put an Apple-like commission split so that QGIS.org takes 30% of money coming from it? That will let us fund Lova into the long term and other eventual team members to be paid to maintain the plugin infrastructure. That will enable dudes like me who do backend work maintaining the plugins services unpaid and unseen can fade into the sunset and professional staff can take over the duty of keeping the plugins platform going.
* Having a commission will also cover the cost of doing the accounting, keeping track of who is owed what from their plugin sales, accounting for everything, bank fees and what-not.
* We need to make it clear that QGIS does not offer any guarantees for plugins sold (or downloaded for free for that matter) from the plugin repo
* It would be great to also invest into other long standing issues like having plugin reviewers (or a clever AI scanner thingy) to make sure plugins play nice on people's computers

Personally I would also like to have a 'hard opt in' for the plugin installer shipped in QGIS. The first time you use it, you would need to acknowledge that the plugins you get from the store may vary in quality and their security from awesome to downright dangerous. If you do not agree then the plugin manager link to the plugins repo essentially gets disabled and you need to hand install plugins using the 'from a zip file' tab in the plugin manager.

Probably more contentious would be asking those orgs fronting their commercial services with a free plugin to give us (QGIS.org) a commission too for the upstream services they sell, but I guess that would be a) hard to enforce and b) bring out the complaints big time :-P

Tim

I would say, why not?

Many other open source projects have opted by having "market places" and paid plugins (e.g. Blender, Wordpress). This did not stopped many developers to keep publishing free plugins, while allowed others to have an easy way to sell their work.

Our plugin repository has now lots of plugins that are no longer working or with bugs because the developer no longer have the time or will to maintain it. Maybe if some of these developers could receive a compensation for their time this could change.

Besides, QGIS is now very robust and offers so many functionality already. Opposed to the past where some "core" functionality was depending of free  third party plugins.

Notice that there are already paid plugins. Some need api keys to work. And other are being kept "secret" outside our plugin repository and they could be useful for many more people.

All the best,

Alex

Hi all,
I have been sleeping over this thread a bit.

We already have a lot of paid plugins and in the psc we try to contact vendors to have them aware of the GPL licence obligations. This is a lot of manual work, and this does not scale up obviously.
Offering a marketplace in our plugin management system can be really interesting, since this would give us a way to explain GPL obligations to authors and offer them a place to advertise their products a lot better than letting them deal with their own systems.

That said, the same question for QGIS.org general funding and sustainability also applies.
We have been having a better fundings this year thanks to marketing efforts of Marco and Andreas, which allows us to consolidate some tasks, but we still live on a very low budget compared to the size of the project.

Ideas have been thrown about using existing marketplaces (Windows store for instance) to collect regular incomes via notarized QGIS installers, but this is not an easy move given that we don't have permanent staff to handle with the administrative work this gives.
Developing our own marketplace for plugins could indeed be a way to let users do a voluntary contribution to the project when buying a plugin, or even trade a very small percentage on sales to maintain the platform. Most payment associative tools I know always offer this possibility, I wouldn't be shocked personaly.

If we keep a mandatory link to a repository in plugin metadata,  where source code is available, I think we preserve users that can't afford to pay. We might write down market place terms of use where we ask plugin authors for fair uses (no ads, no illegal use, security rules etc, no fake repository that would not really allow users to get the real source code..)

And I agree with Alessandro here, having public sources availables will still let a large audience to the payment system. QGIS' audience is so large.

All in all, this kind of system requires more efforts to maintain everything in place, and I would be in favor of growing up the budgets to have dedicated persons able to handle this, just like we already manage to do with documentation and infrastructure management (Thanks Kartozo, Lova and Selma, you do a great job)

In short, I would be in favor of going this way, but we need to handle this as it is: grow up QGIS.org core to be able to handle those tasks. And growing the budget is the first thing missing maybe.

Best regards
R?gis

Hi All
The economics of this is very interesting.

As a community, we want to give something to our fellow members that they need. It allows for our creativity in scratching an itch, and sharing that solution. However, we can break the mold and work out a novel way to deliver. The open-source pledge North Road uses goes some way to doing this. Whilst there a lot of tools are within the licensed (paid) version, those tools are available for release once production costs are met. This enables the plugin to continue to deliver to those who cannot pay for the licensed version, whilst funding further work as technology organically develops or additional needs pop-up. Also note that the remuneration funds our support for the FOSS4G community, whether via sponsorship or applying resources on the committee. So the funding for the plugin gets recycled in the community, as well as going someway to providing a living wage.

Shutting out people from the use of desired services should not be what we are about - there has to be another way.

In regards to taking over a plugin, this is how FOSS continues, if someone is passionate about it, they can ask the creator to take it over. As part of the marketplace, the community should also have this as a service, a page listing the plugins that are not maintained or won't be maintained and is anyone available to take them over. This is a great way for up and coming developers to learn the craft from mentors.

Keep the discussion going - this community is so creative that I think we will come up with an option.

Cheers
Em

Hi Nyall,

First, thank you for all that you have done over the years. You have helped me a number of times in answering questions. Open source software is an interesting beast. There is so much donated time without compensation yet people need to feed themselves. My first QGIS plugin was in 2016 and I now have 12 QGIS plugins that are published (several more that are unpublished), but I am facing a dilemma. My work has funded all my development except for one plugin which I did for myself. Unfortunately, I was never really able to break into the ESRI culture here and a year or so ago was told to stop doing further QGIS development and to focus on other research. I did not find something that I liked as well so I am going to retire (because I can) in May. So my dilemma is what is going to happen with my plugins. I care about them. I have an agreement with another organization to take over support but after the first meeting I have no confidence that they will be able to do it. I will probably still fix some bugs after I retire, but I am not all that interested in working for free. I want to explore new hobbies in retirement so any QGIS work would be minimal unless it also fits in with one of my hobbies.

I don't know how to get compensation in the open source world unless there is a company who is investing in and developing open source software. It would be nice if there were a mechanism for developers to get some compensation.

This is a difficult topic to address, but I hope something comes out of it.

Best wishes,

Calvin

Hi lists!

I wanted to kick start a (hopefully!) civil, THEORETICAL discussion about the role of a paid plugin marketplace for QGIS plugins.

This has been on my mind for a while, and recently was bumped by this email to the list:

So again, stressing that this is a THEORETICAL discussion, I'm interested in hearing people's thoughts on the potential role of a paid plugin marketplace for QGIS.

Here's a bullet point dump of where I'm currently sitting:

- Yes, I'm aware that plugins must be GPL, and that this makes paid plugins a little trickier in that they're obviously still subject to the GPL.
- The GPL does NOT prevent charging for software, or mandate making it public to non-paying customers. We could potentially have GPL plugins which are only available to paid users, and only make these plugins available privately to those users. YES, the GPL **DOES** mean that those paying customers can redistribute the plugin publicly and freely without issue if they want (and regardless of whether the original developer wants!)
- In fact, there's already likely thousands of private, paid for plugins out there! I'm talking here of plugins made specifically for internal use by one organisation only. Yep, that organisation COULD make the plugin public/freely available, but in many cases they are specific to that one organisation's needs or contain organisation sensitive logic/data. These plugins are completely compliant with the GPL, despite being private and paid for by that organisation.
- There's nothing preventing a public GPL QGIS plugin from depending on a subscription based back-end, and offering zero value to anyone not paying for that backend. And there's a growing number of these plugins, which depend on users paying xxx large corporate entity regular high fees to access the backend service. The GPL doesn't (and arguably shouldn't) prevent these large entities from making money off QGIS plugins.
- But this means that the current situation is unfairly weighted toward these large entities! A one-person team making an excellent plugin and providing an awesome tool for use in QGIS has a MUCH MUCH harder time finding ANY financial compensation for their efforts! I don't like this situation at all, and I'd say it goes against the "spirit" of why QGIS was made under the GPL in the first place. The big corporate entities win, the smaller community focused developers lose out. ?
- Despite the fact that a paid user could freely re-distribute a paid-for plugin, there's still potential financial gain for the developer in making a plugin available for a charge on a theoretical QGIS plugin marketplace.
- The blender market is a great example of this. There's LOTS of GPL blender add ons available there at charge. Eg https://blendermarket.com/products/hard-ops--boxcutter-ultimate-bundle?num=2&src=top as one example. If those numbers are accurate, that developer has sold >35k copies of a GPL licensed add on at $39 each. I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that that developer's motivation to make their add-on excellent is considerably higher than the developer of an equivalent QGIS plugin ? (not to mention that their time investment is much more justifiable). And any ONE of those 35k paid users could have made the plugin freely available for everyone else... but that hasn't stopped the sales.

So what does everyone else think? Would there be a THEORETICAL place for a THEORETICAL paid QGIS plugin marketplace somewhere in the future? Or is there a better model we could (theoretically ?) follow to financially reward plugin developers?

Nyall

A viable external market place would at some point need to use the QGIS 
trademark (in their domain name, etc), so they would have to talk with 
QGIS.org first to see at which condition QGIS.org accepts they use its 
trademark. That condition could be to subscribe to a annual sustainable 
membership + a commission per plugin

Hi everyone,

It seems I have too much time on my hands, semi retired but keen to keep
busy, lol,

With there being over 1000 plugins, the Key Word search in the Plugin
Manager is very good at shortlisting plugins of interest. I do like it, and
having added 2 plugins I have seen it work very well.

I personally see the sum total of QGIS with its Plugin Capability,
PostGRES/PostGIS and GeoPackages as being able to support a Market Place
much like what MapInfo, AutoCad and ESRI have. I.e. Not just Plugins but
also data and services.

I would also like to see QGIS developers, PostGRES/PostGIS Specialists have
a place to advertise their skills and seek income. E.g.

The Best Freelance Python Developers For Hire | Freelancer
<https://www.freelancer.com/find/python>
Fiverr - Freelance Services Marketplace <https://www.fiverr.com/>

I also think it should be run separately from QGIS itself, simply because
if it were something like "www.QGIS.Org/MarketPlace" it would put QGIS on a
commercial base. I like Even's idea of licensing QGIS Trademarks and
branding in return for a commission on all sales. I would probably go one
step further and have a senior QGIS member on the board of this new entity.

All up it is a lot of work, I have been trying to size it for a week or so
now. Even when it is built it will need ongoing development and maintenance
to keep it current.

My two cents worth

Hello,

I believe that I've solved my earlier issue with my QGIS plugin, which previously relied on a pip package. In order to avoid this dependency, I decided to include the Whitebox Workflows wheel in with my plugin. Unfortunately, however, this has increased the size of my plugin fairly substantially. The issue is that I need to included a wheel for each of the four supported operating systems and each are about 10MB. My plugin zip file is now a little less than 40MB. When I try to upload the new version to the QGIS plugin repo it is telling me that the file is too large. Does anyone know what the maximum size of a plugin zip file is? Thanks.

Regards,

John

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS plugin depends on pypi package

Hello everyone,

I am developing a new QGIS plugin (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/whitebox_workflows_for_qgis/#plugin-manage) that serves as a frontend for a Python geospatial analysis library called Whitebox Workflows for Python (WbW). The plugin seems to work well with on major exception, it requires that the user have WbW installed. It can be installed quite easily using pip (pip install whitebox-workflows), however, I know that QGIS uses its own localized version of Python, which seems to lack a terminal app access (at least on MacOS). Besides, a better solution would be for the plugin to install this package via pip when it is itself first installed and launched. I tried to accomplish this with the following code:

https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox_workflows_for_qgis/blob/4e463262f6cfd1987afa2f3f7e0e79656eb8d27e/whitebox_workflows_for_qgis_provider.py#L56

This code, which runs whenever the plugin is launched, first checks to see if whitebox_workflows can be imported and if not, it runs pip from the Python script to install it. Unfortunately, some users have reported issues with this not working correctly:

https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox_workflows_for_qgis/issues/1
?
[https://opengraph.githubassets.com/a248a1a51b43baa531f4fdf47f85868a01c5785c3dded22234ce269d2c64c9e4/jblindsay/whitebox_workflows_for_qgis/issues/1]<https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox_workflows_for_qgis/issues/1>
Installation in QGis fails ? Issue #1 ? jblindsay/whitebox_workflows_for_qgis<https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox_workflows_for_qgis/issues/1>
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'write' Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\\Users/thomas.struller/AppData/Roaming/QGIS/QGIS3\\profiles\\default/python/plugins\\whitebox_work...
github.com

So now I'm left trying to figure out what the recommended approach to installing QGIS plugin dependencies is. Any advice from anyone that has successfully dealt with this problem previously? Thanks.

Regards,

John Lindsay

Presumably 25 MB if I trust 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/validator.py#L20 
.


(But in theory, my interpretation of https://plugins.qgis.org/publish/ 
"Don't include binaries" requirement is that you wouldn't be allowed to 
include binary wheels.. There seems however to be a discrepancy between 
that requirement and the actual practice since other plugins do that.)

Hi Devs,

I kept getting the https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/54184 issue: sip not being able to find the Qt package sips: 'QtNetwork/QtNetworkmod.sip' could not be found etc etc

You can fix this with (on Ubuntu or Debian), by using (before your cmake step):

export DEB_PYTHON_INSTALL_LAYOUT=deb

Would it be possible/wise to add this to the standard QGIS build scripts?

For more info/explanation, see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/54184#issuecomment-1935855984

How will this affect builds on other systems?   It seems there is
something deeper wrong, and the real problem might be that there are
multiple legitimate ways to install things, and that the Find script is
deficient.

How is it looking?   It would seem that finding the python directory
should use some python config mechanism.

On my system this file (3.28) is in

/usr/pkg/lib/python3.11/site-packages/PyQt5/bindings/QtNetwork/QtNetworkmod.sip

which seems like it follows the standard python approach (where choosing
a prefix other than /usr is within standard).

What are the variant places it is ending up in?

Shouldn't the Find script just look in both, if there are two normal
approaches?

I was unaware that there was an explicit list of 4 operating systems
(and perhaps you mean 4 OS-version-CPU tuples, if this is a binary
wheel, even if those function on later os-version-cpu systems).

But even if one accepts a triculture (which I personally don't), then I
would expect you'd need wheels for

  linux-?-x86_64
  linux-?-earmv7
  linux-?-aarch64
  mac-?-x86_64
  mac-?-aarch64
  windows-10-x86_64

which is 6 not 4.  I'm unclear on Windows on ARM (because I choose to be
unclear on Windows :-).  Plus RISC-V is on the horizon.  So this rapidly
becomes unworkable.

(Certainly, I can see that qgis.org delivers binaries of qgis for a
limited set of systems, but qgis the source code obviously ought to be
buildable and runnable on any reasonable system that 99.9% meets POSIX,
plus perhaps a few extensions.)


What happens when you try to install the plugin on a system for which
you don't provide a binary wheel?

I have seen thing like Home Assistant just try "import and if that fails
call pip install" but that is a "this program has sufficient
portability/stability issues needing pinned dependencies that the only
viable path is to run inside a venv" situation.


It also strikes me that binary wheels inside plugins are a security and
licensing issue.  While I don't mean to suggest you are doing anything
improper, I expect plugins to be just python code.  From a licensing
point of view, the plugin has to be GPL and thus any included binary
wheels also have to be provided under the GPL.  If they were a
GPL-compatible permissive license, that then triggers obligatiions for
provide sources that weren't there before, and aren't presenet with "you
need to install X".  Do we have existing practice about this?

There are links to deeper info in my issue comment, so see:

which makes it most clear.

Thanks, that helps tremendously but I am not yet fully understanding.

This helped me:

https://askubuntu.com/questions/1406304/virtualenv-installs-envs-into-local-bin-instead-of-bin

So:

  This is about Debian (and hence Ubuntu etc.) doing something unusual,
  vs every other system (Other Linux, Windows, Mac, *BSD, illumos.)

  Instead of using the default paths that python uses, they have
  configured python so that things have an extra local in the path, so
  that the prefix is $foo/local when the user asks for it to be $foo.

  This choice on Debian's part is a bug to be worked around.

  Setting DEB_PYTHON_INSTALL_LAYOUT='deb' will set the scheme to
  deb_system which is like posix_default.  This is likely ok if one is
  building a deb, but I am guessing not ok if one is building qgis with
  --prefix=/usr/foo.

  It seems like the right fix is for the cmake support that qgis is
  using to say "if scheme is posix_local, change it to posix_default",
  thus working around the Debian bug.

  However, surely Debian people don't think this is a bug.

  Other python software, build on this system, sees a different path?


It sounds like you are proposing to work around this by setting the env
var in the qgis CI environment, and perhaps to recommend to users, and
maybe even to flip it on for users, which is a workaround.

And in the glorious future, cmake will someone manage this by itself.

(I remain unclear on what happens if someone builds on Debian with
--prefix=/usr/foo, but me being unclear on that is ok.)

No, not so much. It is more about Python and Linux distro's (and cmake) trying to address Python's PEP668 (which is mentioned in the kitware issue):

https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/

and the info about 'Externally Managed Environments' and why distro's are doing that:

https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/externally-managed-environments

Takeway:

- in future(?) distro's will have different places where they put packages in: one for distro-packaged, and one for locally packaged.

Probably we will end up with a 'lookup path' in which both are available, but the order will change depending on if you install locally via pip or via your distro's package manager?

I think we are now in the middle of this transitions, hence the messy look sometimes.

Regards,

Richard

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgRi+=ygthZnNLyXhdOoLQxL8AXM1OzP+REB7Pb6S92cA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey list,

What does everyone think about us backporting the python/PyQt6/ directory
from master to the 3.34 branch? I'm thinking we could do this as
"orphan"/unused files, with the intention that it would make backporting to
this branch easier. Obviously it introduces a bunch of "noise" in the repo
for this branch.

Right now any change to a header which entails an accompanying change to
the .sip files will not be backportable without merge conflicts, so eg the
backport bot is rather gutless right now...

I am upgrading my plugin from 3.16.16 to 3.28.15.

I installed 3.28.15 and I don't see the options to Add Circle, Add Rectangle, and Add Ellipse option in the Edit Menu.  I see in the documentation:

https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html#edit

that it is still part of the menu, though there are now submenues, so wondering why I don not see those options in the menu.

I am in process of upgrading my plugin to work in QGIS 3.28.15.  I have layer styles that I created in 3.16.16.

I noticed the update to the Properties Symbology setting includes Legend Settings...

It seems that continuous legends are the default.  I have layer styles files I have do not have this set and when those are applied to my layer, continuous legends are on by default so I lose my labels.  That is, my layer style qml file does not have the entry below.

Message-ID: <CAGy7cY=Gnt2wkX3tbNjoSJtH_dNF=EvK4ecPMSHOaxgue5AXeA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
During cmake-gui configuration on windows 10, I am getting this error on
master branch compilation.

CMake Error at
C:/OSGeo4W/apps/Qt5/lib/cmake/Qt5Keychain/Qt5KeychainLibraryDepends.cmake:73
(message):
The imported target "qt5keychain" references the file

"D:/src/osgeo4w/src/qtkeychain/osgeo4w/install/apps/Qt5/lib/qt5keychain.lib"

but this file does not exist. Possible reasons include:

* The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.

* An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.

* The installation package was faulty and contained

"C:/OSGeo4W/apps/Qt5/lib/cmake/Qt5Keychain/Qt5KeychainLibraryDepends.cmake"

but not all the files it references.

Call Stack (most recent call first):
C:/OSGeo4W/apps/Qt5/lib/cmake/Qt5Keychain/Qt5KeychainConfig.cmake:35
(include)
CMakeLists.txt:574 (find_package)


On other branches, compilation i.e 3.34.3 is not giving any error. Any fix
for this?

Hi (writing offlist here)

If you coordinate with me, it is also possible for me to manually add your
plugin to the repo to bypass the size limit. I prefer not to do these
manual things as general practice - I don't want to become responsible for
rolling out plugin authors updates.

Regards

Tim

Hi,

This is introduced by https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/56284.
It looks like the Qt5Keychain cmake config contains paths from the system
where it was built originally.

Ideally this should be fixed in the Qt5Keychain package of OSGeo4W.
If this is not possible, we'll probably have to re-add a small wrapper
cmake script to fix the find logic specifically for OSGeo4W.

Right now the easiest workaround for you is probably to just revert this
commit.

Kind regards
Matthias

Hi lists,

I'm thinking it's probably time for another (and perhaps the final?!) Qt 6
progress/planning meeting.

Is anyone else interested?

Hi,

I had a bit of fun over the weekend trying to build QGIS with Qt6 for
Windows (unfortunately no executable yet), and would be interested in
joining.

Hi,

Great news!

I imagine there is still packaging work to be done. Anyway, I'm ok to
release a Qt6 preview release (and clearly advertising it, on the
download page and in the splashscreen at least).

Regards,
Julien

Hi list,

maybe you can help me.
I found from nyall the merged pull request "[feature] Add option to use
localhost as redirect host for oauth2" (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/55419).

Is it planned or possible to backport this changes to 3.34 and may be
included to the next LTR version coming in February?
Or are this changes may have a to big impact for the planned 3.34 LTR?

As I found this feature is planned for 3.36 (open documentation ticket).

I am just asking, a short answer is welcome ;)

Kind regards,
Felix

Hello everyone,

I?m starting a new thread because the previous one exceeds the limit. I've included for you a report which details the progress made this week on the development of the plugin and feed website.

New PR for the plugins website:

  *   Use Gmail as the email provider<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/356>
  *   Set media and static path as the same as in production<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/357>
  *   Fix plugin detail rating<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/359>: this is a fix for #354<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/354>
  *   Add local timezone to XML<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/360>: this is a fix for #353<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/353>

New PRs for the feed website:

  *   Use Gmail as the email provider <https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed/pull/70>

Next week, I will try to plan the deployment of some of these PRs. I will also continue to implement the components developed by Kontur on the QGIS Feed website.

Have a great weekend,
Lova

Hey Lova,

thanks for all your great work!

This caught my eye:

> Use Gmail as the email provider 
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/356>

Does this mean that Gmail will be involved in all those mails? I would 
be strongly against proactively exposing any data to such a company if 
not absolutely necessary.

Can't a OSGeo mail account be used instead?

It's bad enough that so much mail is already centralized and thus 
available to a single party/company but as long as a user is not 
willingly using Gmail themselves already, it would be great if Google 
(or any other similar third party) was not involved in such mails.

Cheers, Hannes

I don't really understand what is going on, but I think the less

Hi Paul N,
it looks like that issue happens from time to time. Anyway I suppose 
such issue may have been already fixed. See 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/56317/commits/aa7317e4239e88252c3327bcccd27646062087aa

Which commit are have you build on?

Best regards.

Andrea

Dear Hannes,

Thanks for your feedback. I appreciate that.

> Does this mean that Gmail will be involved in all those mails?
I apologise for that. Indeed, we propose using smtp.gmail.com as EMAIL_HOST instead of smtp to fix the email-sending feature since it sometimes goes into the spam folder.
However, I think this won?t change the account type because we use the same as the current email and keep the part `@qgis.org` unless I?m mistaken. But maybe my PR?s name doesn?t reflect that. For now, I will update the PR and convert it to a draft.

> Can't a OSGeo mail account be used instead?
I?m not sure of the answer to this, sorry.
Dear @Tim Sutton<mailto:tim at kartoza.com>, could you please advise me on that? Thank you.

Best regards,
Lova

Message-ID: <7D53C529-60AD-44DA-961F-F13E840416FE@gmail.com>

Hi psc and devs,
I  think there was a discussion few months ago about how to handle pull requests queue on the code repo, and I'm not sure what was the decision taken. Maybe do i mixup the decisions but I thought some funds would be made available to some devs who will help review the unpaid contributions. Am I right and was there something initiated?

Anyway, may I meanwhile  kindly request some review for these following PRs (I'm not the author, just commented, and they have been going stale many times these last months and most significantly authors are unfortunately getting desperate):
- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/55293
- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/55172

Thanks in advance.

Greetings,
Harrissou

Does this error on QGIS building ring any bell  ?

  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lprovider_virtuallayer_a: No such file or directory

I'm configuring the build with:

  -DWITH_PDAL=no 
  -DWITH_SPATIALITE=no 

And the above error results from that.
Is it a bug in the build script ?

Message-ID: <304615235.2993329.1708548165333@mail.yahoo.com>

Hi All!
I was just wondering about ArcGIS Rest Server connection and how does it run it's requests. I want to connect to an Arcgis Rest Server at the following URL:?https://geoportal.ancpi.ro/maps/rest/services?i get the following response:
This is due to the fact that the admin has done the following settings:?Error: The Administrator Has Disabled the Services Directory?

|  |  |

 |

 |
| 
|  | 
Error: The Administrator Has Disabled the Services Directory

When attempting to access the REST endpoint of a service from Portal for ArcGIS or log in to the Services Direct...
 |

 |

 |


Of course ESRI states that this does not disable access, it just disables the HTML view. If i Run the following request:?https://geoportal.ancpi.ro/maps/rest/services?f=json?then i get the same response as i used to get as a HTML. If i go further on and request a tile from?https://geoportal.ancpi.ro/maps/rest/services/Ortofoto/Mozaic/MapServer/tile/1/76/75?i get a valid image response.?
So my question is, is there any way this can be overridden so i can continue to use the services from ArcGIS?
Thank you and have a great day,Robert Nagy

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GSoC 2024 proposal : QGIS improve the graphical
 modeler UI and UX
Message-ID: <CANrSSZk6Dyd0g0dkq+WSAX4R8xWF9dxHL+G1Uz+EntmNjS2v=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi qgis developers

My name is Valentin Buira, I'm a french student in urban planning and I'm
interested in participating in this year Google Summer of Code to improve
the graphical modeler.

In particular I am interested in improving the user interface(UI) and user
experience (UX) of the graphical modeler based on my previous experience
with other node-based applications. If you are familiar with Blender the
inspiration will be obvious to you but I tried to adapt to the identity and
features of Qgis like the expression engine.

You can find the proposal at the url :
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iXHMTylTHLljfHBITfuIfJzi4_4hpQifEvj5GkM8OCc/edit?usp=sharing

So far I am happy with my proposal but I'm looking for feedback and
suggestions, and also tips on the technical feasibility and the schedule of
the proposal.

On a side note, I will be attending the local code sprint in Grenoble the
26 mars. Where I will also discuss this proposal in person.

Best regards,

Wow Valentin, that plan looks awesome! I'm using both QGIS and Blender 
and often wondered if the QGIS modeler could be improved.

Good luck with work and kind regards,
Raymond

Hi!
A big + from me too - sounds awesome and the mockup looks great.
Hope it'll be doable - would be a great improvement.

Hi Valentin , this is a great proposal and commitment !

The landscape of ETL is changing a lot these days with the end of Talend
open source and the costs explosion of FME.
One component we miss in our graphical modeler is the field mapping tool.
It allows to really quickly remap fields between source and destination
data sources.
This is something you could explore if you start designing new components.
See you in Grenoble !
R?gis

Hi Valentin!

Just to start with, this looks great and it's really exciting to see
someone take this on!

I do have a couple of suggestions for you before finalising your proposal:

- I'd suggest cutting back on the scope here. There's a LOT of work here,
and a lot of complexity. I'd strongly recommend dropping the extra "quality
of life" improvements from your proposal in order to keep your life sane!
(As a bit of a hint, take for example "A unified list for every node". I
wrote a lot of this code and I would estimate it would take me at least 2
days to do this change, and that's with decades of experience in c++, Qt
and the Qt model classes. I just don't think it's realistic that this could
be done in the same week as testing + other things). You could easily drop
the quality of life changes and still have a very compelling proposal.

- Be aware upfront that there's a lot of complexity in the model design and
widget handling. In early 3.x releases ALL of this code was done in Python,
and there were Python based interfaces for plugins to expose custom widgets
for algorithm parameters. Because of stable API restriction, we CAN'T break
those interfaces and as a result the current code is a complex interplay of
c++ underlying bits with Python glue on top to keep the old interfaces
working as originally designed. It's not pretty at all, but unfortunately
it can't be cleaned up prior to 4.0 when we can safely remove the old
interfaces. Suffice to say, there's going to be a LOT of head scratching
when reading over this code and trying to understand how it works
together. ?

- Something to consider in your UI designs is that there's two different
"types" of expression based values for parameters. One (which you've
already covered) is the "precalculated expression" type, where an
expression is evaluated once before running the tool and the result used as
the value for that parameter. The other is "data defined" parameter values,
where the parameter value is evaluated (or taken from a field) once for
every feature passing through the algorithm. These are distinct, different
concepts, and care will need to be taken to expose them as such in a
user-friendly way.

- Care would need to be taken in handling existing models. I think the new
interface would have to be opt-in, as the visual arrangement of models
often takes a lot of work and there's definitely users out there who have
spent considerable time in arranging their models in a logical way. If we
force everyone to use a new visual form for the designer where algorithm
blocks are different sizes and the flow appears different, it will be quite
frustrating for these users.

Do you already have a mentor planned for this work?

Hi Valentin,

That's quite an impressive proposal!
I could not agree more with you about the need to have a better design, 
UX, and UI for the modeler.
However, as Nyall already pointed out, you can be sure that the schedule 
will largely shift seeing the amount of work/features, and I also would 
advise to drop quality of life changes, the proposal still remaining 
very attractive.

I am looking forward to seeing you in Grenoble next month :-)

Best regards,

Jacky Volpes

Hi Valentin,

The proposal looks great, I don't know if someone evaluates the QGIS
graphical modeler.

And as Nyall said, you can cut the scope, and the proposal is still great.

Finally we have another GSoC proposal again for QGIS :)

Good luck!

Hi Valentin,

It's a really nice and refreshing initiative, congrats! It's really 
ambitious, hope that becomes real or at least drives the future work. As 
mentioned by R?gis, the current ETL ecosystem situation is favorable to 
the emergence of an open source ETL, and QGIS Processing is clearly a 
good candidate.

Do you need someone, organization or company to support you?

See you in Grenoble to talk about urban planning and QGIS :).

Regards,
Julien

Message-ID: <CALEkakaY1wJGFAj8j7ZD9xXg9BaqxH4K-P4xT=9bTa9r+By+=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!
I am using QGIS Desktop 3.26 Buenos Aires on Ubuntu 20.04. My question is
the following: I try to write my custom plugin and integrate it with QGIS,
for that purpose I need additional dependencies to be installed(e.g. other
version of numpy or nvidia libraries for gpu). How can I do this without
crashing original dependencies and plugins of QGIS. I need something like a
virtual environment for each plugin in QGIS, but I can't find how to do
something like that. Can you please help me with this?

Best regards,
Olga

Hi Lova,

if I understand it right, using smtp.gmail.com *will* send all mails via 
Google. I don't know which SMTP host is currently used.

Looking at the MX records of qgis.org it seems like Google is used 
already anyways so I might be barking up an old and rotten tree. :(

It really should not be any of Google's business when people communicate 
with qgis.org addresses.

Thank you!

Cheers, Hannes

Hi Olga,

try this thread from last month: 
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2024-January/066390.html

In it Julien and Matthias shared lots of information on this topic.

Cheers, Hannes

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsGeometry's .get() and segfaults
Message-ID: <230de7a4-a67c-4eb9-a642-93d9de22f3af@wheregroup.com>

Hi list!

I am using some time to learn more about the relationships between 
Python, C++, SIP, the QGIS API and everything in-between.

And currently I am confused why this Python snippet leads to a segfault:

from qgis.core import QgsGeometry
g = QgsGeometry.fromWkt("POINT (1 2)")
g_geom = g.get()
del g
print(g_geom.asWkt())

I understand that deleting wrapped objects can lead to unexpected 
deletions of related objects (e. g. if I delete a PyQt parent object and 
then try to use an existing reference/"variablename" to a child of it) 
but at least from the documentation this does not seem related to that.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/dc73608a60229c9960ee65e308cfaba5f32566ec/src/core/geometry/qgsgeometry.h#L196 
says about QgsGeometry.get():
 > Returns a modifiable (non-const) reference to the underlying abstract 
geometry primitive. This method can be slow to call, as it may trigger a 
detachment of the geometry and a deep copy. Where possible, use 
constGet() instead.

I do not understand anything in the detach() function itself 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/dc73608a60229c9960ee65e308cfaba5f32566ec/src/core/geometry/qgsgeometry.cpp#L102 
:o)

Would my small snippet lead to a reference to the C++ object's geometry? 
Then I'd understand the segfault (although not why it would not trigger 
one of the usual "wrapped C/C++ object of type [...] has been deleted" 
errors) if I try to access it after the whole QgsGeometry might have 
been destroyed.
Or does it get a "detached deep copy"? In that case it sounds like an 
independent object to me but I might be completely wrong.

Are there any C++ or SIP terms you could throw my way for further reading?

Thanks for your help!

Cheers, Hannes

Hi Johannes and Lova,

The current reality is that the QGIS PSC is using Google infrastructure 
(Google Drive, Google Mail, youtube channels; sometimes Google Meet) 
quite extensively. It wouldn't be so easy to swap things out. In the PSC 
meetings we use JITSI, but for the QGIS Open Day it is also Google 
infrastructure, as it scales better for more users. We also use GSOC in 
order to bring in new developers.

We know that some people don't like our usage of Google services, but we 
also need to be pragmatic. Doing more things ourselves with open source 
tools or other alternatives would be possible, but would mean that we 
can spend less time directly on improving QGIS.

Greetings,
Andreas

Hi Olga -

 ? Your situation is not entirely unique to you, but I do understand a 
frustrating install experience.

 ? A complete, stable and integrated QGIS on Ubuntu LTS with Qt Desktop, 
some plugins and Openstreetmap sample data is available from the OSGeo 
Foundation project #osgeolive.? That disk can be used as a VM, or to 
boot a PC.? With some intermediate skills, you can use it as a basis of 
your own Ubuntu install, including QGIS.

 ? The next #osgeolive for 2024 will include newer, stable QGIS. Our 
internal challenge is Qt6 (new) or not.

 ? So I cannot fix your install today, but it may benefit you or others 
to know about this complete, stable installed version that you can 
access now at https://live.osgeo.org

 ? Last, recent Debian or Ubuntu OS disks will install a complete QGIS 
if you start with a release base installer. The combination of parts 
will be older than the other install options. Conflicting plugins are a 
problem that other people also deal with -- the answer is often to just 
use fewer plugins, and be selective when installing new software.? hth

 ? best regards from Berkeley, California

Welcome Aboard Valentin! Thank you for proposing this topic, which, as 
you can see from previous ones, interests us all immensely!

I hope the topic can be accepted, and we can support you.

Looking forward to meeting you and discussing it in Grenoble!

PS: Urban planner + QGIS Developer, I love it ;)

Message-ID: <CALe-BopJFQWHGuNOVx2z7AD5xtMbRCSbyoZGLc+BV2azW_E3Xg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

When uninstalling a plugin it keeps leaving me configuration parameters
inside the *Qgis3.ini* file located at the following address.

C:\UsersUARIO\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\QGIS\QGIS\

How to delete all references to a plugin once it is uninstalled?

Gracias

Hi!

If the plugin did not clean up itself then you will have to clean up 
manually. Plugins can edit anything anywhere in that file. If you are 
concerned about changes to the file, then best place it under version 
control.

Cheers, Hannes

Hello everyone,

Please find below a report which details the progress made this week on the development of the plugin and feed website.

Merged PR for plugins website:

  *   [Deployed on staging] Fix plugin detail rating<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/359>: this is a fix for #354<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/354>
  *   [Deployed on staging] Add local timezone to XML<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/360>: this is a fix for #353<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/353>. The cached XML files on the staging don?t show this change because they are copied from the production. However, we can request a non-cached XML file, for example, https://staging.plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.36
Still working on:

  *   Update the design of QGIS-Feed to match https://qgis.github.io/QGIS-Hugo/<https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed/pull/72>
  *   Implement Playwright CI testing on QGIS-Hugo<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/179>

We will probably deploy the merged changes next week.

Have a great weekend,
Lova

Hi Devs,

As release 3.36 Maidenhead is near...

Please have a look at https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.36/

To fix/polish or add stuff you did or is important to show to users.

@Andreas: I'll wait for you to add the tables with notable changes, please ping me when done

Then I will dump it to rst and include it in the website (probably for the last time, as hopefully we will have a new website next release :-)  ).

Thanks in advance,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi guys

If you so desire, you can move this message to QGIS Users

My OSGeo4W stack QGIS has just been upgraded to 3.36, and now the
otbprovider plugin (core plugin) does not work anymore.

Error states that metadata is missing.

Could you assist please?

Regards

Pieter

Hi Richard,

I added all bug fixes that had been reported. I am still missing the 
ones from Nyall, perhaps some more as well.

This should not hold off the publication of the visual change log 
though.

Thank you very much,

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GDAL processing algorithms issues due the default
 output layer extensions weirdly changed
Message-ID: <be8965ca-6378-4145-a19b-6b3e21f990b9@libero.it>

Hi developers,
various QGIS users have reported during the latest months (mostly since 
September 2023, and a couple also back in July 2023) on various channels 
a strange issue which makes the GDAL processing algorithms to fail when 
the temporary output is set.

Looking at the provided processing logs, it turns out that the issue is 
due to the fact that the default output vector layer extension was set 
to .xtf "Interlis 2" (instead of the default .gpkg "GeoPackage") or that 
the default output raster layer extension was set to .nc "NetCDF" 
(instead of the default .tif "GeoTIFF").

The weird think is that all the users affected by the issue have 
reported that they had not deliberately changed these settings.

Currently there is no issue report open on GitHub since they have been 
closed one by the reporter and one as duplicate.
Anyway the issues reports were about the processing issues and not about 
the "who changed the default output layer extensions?" issue.

I tried without success to find out what's going on and I hope some 
developers can have a look and find the root cause of the issue, since 
the issue continues to be reported by the users.
Actually the issue can also affect both the QGIS and the GRASS 
processing algorithms that have a raster output, although not reported yet.

Since both the layer extensions .xtf "Interlis 2" and .nc "NetCDF" are 
the last one (i.e. index -1) in the default output vector layer 
extension list and the the default output raster layer extension list, 
It may be possible that the issue may be due to the recent changes in 
the settings storing / retrieving logic.

You'll find the links to a dozen reports (either on GitHub, 
stackexchange, qgis-user ml, Facebook groups) listed in the comments of 
the closed issue report at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/54952

Best regards.

Andrea Giudiceandrea


P.S. while writing this message I found an issue report 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/53204 and a PR 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/53458 allegedly fixing it both dating 
May 2023 precisely relating to the DefaultOutputRasterLayerExt and the 
DefaultOutputVectorLayerExt settings.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Official PSC call on pull request policies
Message-ID: <CAB28Asj+qNNPuV=DkvAegZZuq4NZgbY23fPq1YFrRrTyEs12dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi PSC,

I would love for an official call to be made on which of two
conflicting pull request queue management policies should be adopted
by QGIS.

There are currently two proposals, and the lack of a formal policy is
causing confusion/conflict in how pull requests are managed.

Policy #1: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/56062

In short, Sandro proposes that the pull request queue be an open queue
of ALL work happening everywhere, in any state of completeness. Pull
requests are permitted for semi-complete work, and for long-term
(including multi-year) projects which are not yet ready for review or
merge. The justification here is that having this work open in the
queue makes it widely visible and so that other developers are aware
of ongoing work across the community.

Currently, these pull requests will be auto-closed by stalebot due to
the lack of activity on the ticket. Sandro's proposal is to disable
stalebot handing of draft / WIP pull requests, and effectively to
formalise that the queue is a valid place for work of this nature and
status.

(@strk please expand here if you feel I haven't summarised your point
of view correctly!)

Policy #2: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/56523

In this PR I propose to set a formal policy that draft and WIP pull
requests are NOT suitable for opening against the QGIS repository.

My justification is that we have a long-standing issue with
maintainability of the pull request queue, and anything which
decreases the signal-to-noise ratio on open tickets is undesirable.
When the queue includes work which is not ready for review, then it
becomes very tricky to work out the actual status of pull requests and
which ones should be focused on during review time. (Effectively right
now we have a situation where any pull request which is pushed on the
2nd page of requests will basically NEVER get reviewed, as there is a
constant stream of ready-for-review work flowing into the first page
and the signal-to-noise ratio of ready-for-review/merge PRs on
subsequent pages is extremely low). I do not believe it is fair for
submissions like https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/55172 or
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/55293 where reviews take SUCH a long
time, and it is my belief that by keeping the queue as small as
possible and avoiding WIP/draft work we will increase the likelihood
that PRs like these can be reviewed more quickly in future.

Please note that there is considerable discussion on
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/56062 already which should be read
when reviewing this decision.

Can I ask that PSC choose one of these two policies to formally adopt
so that there is no misunderstanding or conflict in future?

Thanks in advance!
Nyall

Hmm, I wonder if it's a plugin changing this setting. I've definitely
seen plugins before doing unfriendly things like this...

I'm not sure if that explains the family of bugs seen, but as those 
settings are a *integer* index in the list returned by 
QgsVectorFileWriter::supportedFormatExtensions() or 
QgsRasterFileWriter::supportedFormatExtensions() , they depend both on 
the QGIS list of known formats which may evolve over versions (not that 
frequent that said), and/or if the GDAL version changes and/or if 
drivers are enabled/disabled. It would be more robust to capture the 
extension as a string rather than an index.

And even capturing an extension is not super robust, as potentially 
several drivers could recognize the same extension

For example when using the ".xml" extension as a vector output, you'll 
probably be surprised that the obscure PDS4 vector driver (tabular data 
for planetary datasets) is used!

This is because:

$ ogrinfo --formats | grep xml | grep 'w'
 ? PDS4 -raster,vector- (rw+vs): NASA Planetary Data System 4 (*.xml)
 ? GML -vector- (rw+v): Geography Markup Language (GML) (*.gml, *.xml)
 ? Interlis 2 -vector- (rw+v): Interlis 2 (*.xtf, *.xml, *.ili)
 ? GMLAS -vector- (rwv): Geography Markup Language (GML) driven by 
application schemas (*.gml, *.xml)

whereas looking at QgsVectorFileWriterMetadataContainer , I strongly 
suspect that the intent was rather to use the GeoRSS driver for which 
QGIS registers a .xml extension (the GDAL GeoRSS driver doesn't 
advertize a particular file extension)

==> Those settings should actually be deprecated and replaced by others 
that save a GDAL driver name ... plus an extension, because the "MapInfo 
File" driver produces quite different output if you chose ".tab" or 
".mif" (or the GeoJSONSeq driver that will use different separators if 
you select the ".geojsonl" or ".geojsons" extensions)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Plugin update
Message-ID: <CAFUsW4U-R+SL=sPOdxQw0WQ0PHcM98zvgx5cUwVt+Ov-6Mfe7w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Developers,

I have made a pull request one and half year ago to the MapSwipeTool
plugin, but the developer of the plugin didn't do anything with it. I made
only a minor change in the code, caused by the change in QLine parameters.
The latest version of the plugin, available from the plugins.qgis.org repo
is useless, it fails after activation. Some users react to my pull request,
that it solves the issue (
https://github.com/lmotta/mapswipetool_plugin/pulls). This plugin is/was
popular, more than hundred thousand downloads.
I don't want to take over the development and the maintenance of this
plugin, just make the workable version available for the users as a new
version in the plugin repo. Can it be done somehow without being the owner
of the plugin?

Thanks,
Zoltan Siki

I also suspected that a plugin may be involved, but I was unable to find 
a common plugin in all the reports.

Now it seems to me more likely that it may be the management of the 
settings, after seeing https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/53204 and 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/53458 precisely relating to the 
DefaultOutputRasterLayerExt and the DefaultOutputVectorLayerExt settings 
and the -1 index.

The problem occurs also when saving the algorithm output to a file, 
instead of a temporary output, and choosing an extension.

Hi Zolt?n,
unfortunately no, we can't do anything to take over an unmaintained plugin.

Did you try to contact the authoss by other means than github ? They could
decide to transfer the ownership to a more opened user group so that
benevolent people can maintain it.
If they explicitly stop maintaining this plugin, you can try to make a call
for maintainers in the developper's list and try to set up a way to
maintain this, or try to get funds to implement this feature in QGIS core.

regards,
R?gis

Ha, yeah pragmatism is a very good reason. I've battled with mail 
delivery recently in a much smaller project and it was not fun.

Thanks for all your work, you awesome people!

Cheers, Hannes

PS: To be honest, I get a deja vu, so if I ranted about this (without 
offering help or solutions :} ) before in the past, sorry!

Dear developers,


Just had a small question and hopefully I'm at the right address.

We run Qgis 3.28.5 LTR on some computers and Microsoft Security Center seems to be complaining
about the presence of Python.exe version 3.8.5.0 included with 3.28.x LTR Qgis installations.

These are the CVE's linked to this Python version.
[cid:image001.png at 01DA68B1.FFA69BE0]

I read online that updating the Python for Qgis isn't just a copy/replace action.
I was just wondering if this is known and if there are any plans to update Python in future LTR releases ?

Kind regards,

Met vriendelijke groet,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GDAL processing algorithms issues due the

I am 99% that I have not uninstalled any plugins in two profiles where 
this occured and in one of them there is only the GeoCat Bridge plugin 
and in the other the QuickWKT plugin, in addition to the core plugins. 
So I would consider it unlikely to be caused by plugins.

You can upgrade your version of QGIS 3.28.15. It has already been fixed.

I find the Road Ahead Table confusing.

So does the line

LR/PR

3.36.0

3.34.4

2024-02-23

8

4


indicate that 3.34.4 is the latest LTR release available.  Where is it?  I only see 3.34.3 available for download.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Access to shapeDigitizeToolBar menu's text
Message-ID: <95416fc0fe394116ba65c26d7b1ef517@erdc.dren.mil>

Trying to get access to the button menus in shapeDigitizeToolBar.

from qgis.utils import iface

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidgetAction
sdtb = iface.shapeDigitizeToolBar()
i=0
for action_item in sdtb.actions():
    i=i+1
    print (f"{i}: {action_item}")

This prints:

1: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242801E98B0>
2: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242F9E43F70>
3: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242F9E590D0>
4: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242F9E9E1F0>
5: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242F9E274C0>

I want to access each button and the menus of the button so I can disable certain tools.  I need to get the text associated with the tools so I can key on that.

I can't figure out how to get to them from QWidgetAction. I called all the methods on QAction that returns a string: data, iconText, statusTip, whatsThis and they all return empty strings.  So how are these menus labeled.

Thanks,
Luke

Hi,

The table is correct, but it is the date when the code is 
forked/frozen/taken for the packaging.

Packaging can take a couple of days. You just need to be patient. It 
will be available soon.

Greetings,

Andreas

Hi,

Moved changelog to site:

https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog336/index.html

Do we want the Backports in it?
I already removed all the lines:
"This feature was developed by `qgis-bot <https://github.com/qgis-bot>`__"

But now it is, without context or images, very raw.

Same question about the 'Feature: Revert ?Restore default metadata from DB?'-like items.

If we need more time to add stuff, let me know.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

They definitely shouldn't be in there. Something has gone amiss with the
changelog harvester, I noticed it's put a bunch of entries in overnight
which weren't even present in 3.36 ?

Hmm, would it be possible to do the export again? I noticed a few extra
entries were added overnight too, and these aren't present on the site.
(Plus a few wording improvements I made this morning too)..

Did you run into the gperf issue?  Where gperf more or less silently produces
nearly empty files that lead to unclear link errors later?  All that deep in
webengine/chromium?  Or the long path issue?

Hi Luca, as always, there is a delay between source code releases events,
and the packaging can only start, as per
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html#release

QGIS website indicates that packaging is on its way.

Official communication including the changelog and binaries are on their
way.

How do you think we could improve our communication to clarify this ? You
are not the only one asking, so I think we still have work to improve.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problems with text when exporting to SVG from
 composer
Message-ID: <03edfa1c-b0fc-40d7-a5a9-742db332d2bd@univ-brest.fr>

Hi all,

Some months ago there was a discussion 
<https://discourse.osgeo.org/t/qgis-fr-user-ameliorer-lexport-svg-de-qgis/274/11> 
on the french qgis user group about problems with svg export in QGIS. 
This is a follow-up to this discussion but centered on text, because it 
seemed better to start with a more "focused" problem :-) For a bit of 
context my colleague Nelly Martin and myself would like to help improve 
QGIS export to SVG to help other colleagues (and ourselves !) switch to 
QGIS. We're aware that QGIS has great possibilities to make maps, but 
for a lot of people editing GIS output in vector graphic editors 
software like Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer, or Inkscape is part 
of their workflow.

So this is an attempt to group multiple issues with text and SVG export. 
Maybe this can help to see if these multiple bugs have the same source ?

1. *Text gets exported as separated lines or separated letters :* when 
exporting multi-line text, each line gets exported as a distinct text 
element. When exporting curved label, each letter gets exported as a 
distinct element as well. This is documented in issue 24639 
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/24369>. There is also an older 
issue documenting an inverse problem when importing into QGIS a SVG with 
multi-line text created in Inkscape : issue 11856 
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/11856>.

2. *Wrong font size :* when setting a font size of 10pt in QGIS for some 
text and exporting to SVG, and opening SVG in Inkscape, Affinity 
Designer,? or Adobe Illustrator, font size is 10.07747412 pt. This is 
documented in issue 49761 <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/49761>.

3. *Wrong font :* exported SVG do not always use correct fonts, simple 
fonts are ok but more complicated one are not. This is documented in 
issue 47017 <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/47017>.

4. *Wrong character :* minus character gets exported as a dash, this is 
documented in issue 44444 <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/44444>. 
Perhaps other characters get exported wrongly as well ?

As I understand it, these bugs are not QGIS-related but stem from Qt. In 
the initial discussion in the french list, R?gis Haubourg and Julien 
Cabieces mentioned that KDAB could be a good interlocutor for Qt 
developments (thanks again R?gis and Julien for your answers !).

Would this problem be eligible for a QGIS grant, even if this is not a 
QGIS development ? Or do you have any idea how to have a go at this ? We 
haven't found any funding source for now, but we keep looking ! In the 
meantime having input from the QGIS community on this would be valuable.

Thanks a lot for your input ! Have a nice day,

Julie & Nelly.

Thank you for your response. Yes, I suggest you to indicate that the date
are only suggested.

See this example for LibreOffice:

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan

there's a column for the Freeze and one for Publishing, with a range of
dates and not a fixed day.

Hi R?gis, Luca, list,

I think some of the confusion might be over the term of "Release". I 
read this as release of the binaries, i.e. something we can download and 
install from the QGIS website as a user. From what you said Luca, it 
seems you view "Release" as release of the source code before packaging 
into binaries. Do I understand this correctly?

I've always found the Road Map page slightly confusing. Is there space 
on the website for a "simpler" explanation of this process somewhere? 
Yes, I am happy to have a go at writing a first draft!

Also - I think the release process is complicated by OSGeo4W Network 
installer. I used this to install both LTR and current versions of QGIS 
yesterday (26th Feb) and got 3.36.0 (branded as Release Candidate) and 
3.34.3 (branded at LTR) which I think is a bit ahead of the game.

I think Kurt's post on LinkedIn 
(https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7167793362815717376/) 
may have also made some people this 3.36 is available when it is not.

Hope this is useful!

Best wishes,
Nick.

Quoting the website (right above the roadmap):

OSGeo4W packages, MSIs and Mac packages are already available, but the
debian/ubuntu packages are still building, while the MSIs are being tested.
Once that's done the website will be updated.

But that's nothing new - most of that happens every month.

Hi Luke,

As you can see on the printed text, objects are QWigetAction, not QAction.
This is because you get each category of the tool bar, where then each 
one contains one or more digitizing QActions.


Here is a snippet that can help you explore the tool bar:


sdtb = iface.shapeDigitizeToolBar()
for i, action_widget_item in enumerate(sdtb.actions()):
 ??? print(f"{i}: {action_widget_item.defaultWidget().text()}")
 ??? for j, action_item in 
enumerate(action_widget_item.defaultWidget().menu().actions()):
 ??????? print (f"\t{j}: {action_item.data()}")? # id like
 ??????? print (f"\t\ttranslated text: {action_item.text()}")

Message-ID: <33FC6FCE-64FD-4A02-8D18-1868E8D88229@gmail.com>

Hi!

I?m looking to understand  in a more advanced way how QGIS handles on-the-fly projection.
In my case I set the project crs in epsg:3857 and I have a raster layer in epsg:4326. In this case what is happening with the layer?

I know that it?s based on PROJ, but I?m wondering what is actually happening in the back-end, what is happening in the map canvas, how is the layer render, is being resampled every time you pan the map or do zoom in/out ...

So, if someone can help with a detailed explanation, I would really appreciate it.

Thanks in advance!

All the best!
Ionut

We are in the process of building a new website, I think you're right we
should simplify the roadmap page and communicate more on the binary release
date than on source code in our phrasing.

As for external communication, indeed many posts are launched individually
when source code is branched. I hope this is not a race to be the first to
communicate and gather traffic.  I'll raise the issue to the PSC.
Thanks a lot!

I would add that allowing long-term PRs also serves the purpose of making
it easy for contributors to check the state of their work against CI as
running tests locally is so hard that I dubt anyone is doing that.

I think this is a limitation of the software used to get the list
of pull requests needing focus, and should be threated as such.
If github makes it hard to filter on "PR state" we could use a label
to do that.

This should be good to re-export, I've deleted all the junk backport
entries from 3.36 on changelog.qgis now.

Thanks!

Thanks Nyall, thanks Sandro,

Just a quick question, is the
 -is:draft
Filter an option at all? I guess it does not reduce the n/r by default but
could help?

That hides them, yes. But the bigger question remains as to what value
having unfinished work in the queue has in the first place. In my opinion
if it's not ready for review and merge, it's not actually a "pull REQUEST"
and just doesn't belong there. In my proposal there's already mention that
short term pull requests can be permitted for the express purpose of
performing a CI test run, so after that why is there a need to allow
unfinished work to remain in the queue?

If the need is for others to see and be exposed to unfinished work, then
let's look at an extreme example: I have some 100's of branches of work in
an unfinished state on my QGIS fork, from proof of concept experiments
through to things which I just don't think work well enough to be
submitted. Should all of those draft/wip branches be pull requests in the
QGIS repo? ? If the justification for allowing draft/wip requests is that
others can see what's being/been done, then I guess the same argument would
apply to all of this.

Hi Olga
These plugins are maintained by each of the plugin's developers and not by
the project. It is up to them to ensure any dependency conflicts are
managed. Therefore, if you find any issues, you should contact the plugin
developers and put in bugs on their GitHub pages. A link to contact them is
in the plugin manager in their Plugin information section. Everything is
outlined here
<https://plugins.qgis.org/>

For those plugins that are no longer maintained, this presents an
opportunity for the community to jump in and assist if they are passionate
about that plugin.

It's completely possible to trigger the GH CI without creating a PR
directly from your fork, you
just have to:
- create a branch
- add your branch name here [0] in a special commit that you will remove
once your work is ready to create a PR
- Push, the CI result appear in https://github.com/<your_gh_login>/QGIS/actions

Prior to that you will have to "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
from https://github.com/<your_gh_login>/QGIS/settings/actions

It's pretty straightforward, and I use it everytime I want to check on CI.

Julien

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Plug-In Approval
Message-ID: <FE842B20-F332-48B5-9A00-FA51D5006F27@gmail.com>

Hi, 

I work for the Norwegian Administration Road in the NVDB team, NVDB stands for National Road Database and they manage all traffic signs, road, tunnels, trees, etc as a road object and all of them has their own geometry or depends on other?s object geometry and we already have several systems to deal with, for reading or writing back to the DB.

So we are trying to integrate NVDB with some of the GIS out there, but QGIS is the chosen one, because I already have a Qt Framework C++ background and some Python knowledge, but GIS is all new for me, but there we go ?

The thing is Plug-In was uploaded to plugins repository from October 2023 and I get in contact with a former QGIS admin and he helped a lot, they said that it should be nice if I cnageg Plug-In name, icon, UI Language text and Readme/Docs language content to English, so I did it.

Yesterday 26/02/2024 I uploaded the new zip file containing the plug-in with those pointed modifications above and now it says Plug-In need to wait for approve. 

?

So the question is what next to do now ? And I know I need to wait for approval, but how long this will take, hope it doesn?t take long like the previous one.

I have successfully built QGIS and GDAL (3.7.2) separately. Now I want to
build QGIS against this GDAL. This is what I tried:

git clone git at github.com:qgis/QGIS.git
cd QGIS
mkdir build
cd build
GDAL_DIR=/home/velle/gdal3.7.2/build cmake ..

The output contains the following error for GDAL:

CMake Error at /home/velle/gdal-3.7.2/build/GDALConfig.cmake:24 (include):

Could someone please tell me if I'm even doing it right?

I got stuck in PyQt6, the build succeeds but somehow doesn't install all
the .pyd files into the correct location.
Where did you run into gperf issues, QGIS or a dependency?

You need to *install* GDAL first. You can't just point QGIS to the GDAL 
build directory

So in the GDAL build directory, do "cmake .. 
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/install-gdal-3.7.2 ; make -j$(nproc); make 
install"

and then when configuring QGIS, use GDAL_DIR=$HOME/install-gdal-3.7.2 . 
I'm not totally sure about that last part. may require tweaking. you 
could alter the PATH to point to $HOME/install-gdal-3.7.2/bin so that 
"gdal-config" from your installed GDAL is picked up

Hi Thomas,

Not sure if it is usefull, but some time ago I build (always in ~/git/foo) and install (always in ~/bin/foo) PROJ, GDAL and then build QGIS (in ~/git/qgisgdal)  with those.

This is what I then use:

cd /home/richard/git/qgisgdal;

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/richard/bin/qgis/qgisgdal/debug/lib/:/usr/lib/grass76/lib/;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/richard/bin/gdal/lib:/home/richard/bin/proj/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

mkdir build;cd build;ccmake -DBUILD_TESTING=FALSE -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF -DWITH_SERVER=TRUE -DWITH_3D=TRUE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/richard/bin/qgis/qgisgdal/debug -DWITH_QWTPOLAR=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPROJ_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/richard/bin/proj/include/ -DPROJ_LIBRARY=/home/richard/bin/proj/lib/libinternalproj.so.15 -DGDAL_CONFIG=/home/richard/bin/gdal/bin/gdal-config -DGDAL_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/richard/bin/gdal/include/ -DGDAL_LIBRARY=/home/richard/bin/gdal/lib/libgdal.so -DQT5_3DEXTRA_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt53DExtras.so -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/richard/git/qgisgdal/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake -DQT5_3DEXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/richard/git/qgisgdal/external/qt3dextra-headers ..

Then to run QGIS you also have to make sure that QGIS picks up the right libs by using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH above.

Hope this is helpful.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

It will first try to locate GDAL via cmake config (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/cmake/FindGDAL.cmake#L16). Only if
that fails it will fall back to the gdal-config executable.

To help cmake find a package on a custom install prefix, refer to
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html#config-mode-search-procedure

in your case I'd suggest using `-D GDAL_ROOT=$HOME/install-gdal-3.7.2`
after installing

 plugin list?
Message-ID: <58d32557-b435-4494-9550-1251d2dae029@duif.net>

Hi,

Maybe it is a little too early, as not so many people will be able to test Qt6 builds of QGIS?

But I have one :-)
And I upgraded a first plugin that is working both in Qt5 and Qt6 [0]

Now I'm wondering if there should be some visual cue, when working with a Qt6 build, when searching for plugins.
99.9% of the plugins will not work :-(
And pop up the attached screenshot.

Any idea's on how to handle this user friendly?
Hiding the Qt5 plugins does not seem a good idea (to me).
Maybe 'graying' out all plugins that do not have `supportsQt6=yes` in their metadata is easiest, and would maybe users ask for Qt6 upgrades to plugin authors?
Alternative would be some checkbox/filter for Qt5/Qt6 plugins/

Other idea's, or should we/I just not bother?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I think the error message

"The plugin is not compatible with this version of QGIS.
It's designed for QGIS versions: Plugin does not support Qt6 versions of 
QGIS"

should also be tweaked.

Message-ID: <CAEHjKAt+X7Xm3jXYhbn-r-5+jY6RtBRvbsk2r=J8XPVnydY7nw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I write the list because I have a a simple question (currently I'm trying
to tackle issue #56275 Improve Parsing of Data from Serial Port Sensors).

Is  using the QtDesigner signal/slot assignment facilities discouraged?
I've read this in the QGIS coding standards guide and don't really know if
that means that:

*Avoid use of Qt auto connect slots (i.e. those named void
on_mSpinBox_valueChanged).*

So, If I need to connect two widgets in a groupBox (a radioButton and a
QLineEdit, just to enable the QLineEdit only a determinate radioButton is
selected), should I make it programatically instead using QtDesigner?


Thanks a lot

Jorge

Hi again,

sorry but I have a idea... I compiled QGIS and realized that signals
connections made with QtDesigner are compiled into old style signal-slot
connection:

QObject::connect(mCustomDelimiterOption, SIGNAL(toggled(bool)),
mCustomDelimiterText, SLOT(setEnabled(bool)));

What is also forbidden by QEP #77.

So I guess this answers my question. Thanks a lot anyway.

I realise you posted a follow up, but just to confirm -- yes, do NOT rely
on connections made in the designer.

The rationale is that the designer can break these connections without any
warning. Eg if you cut and paste some widgets to move them around, any
connections to those will be silently broken. It's much safer to rely on
manual connections with compile time checks...
