Subject: [Qgis-developer] lack of zip_decoder in PIL with Windows 64bits
	installer
Message-ID: <53B2700D.7000104@camptocamp.com>


I've meet problems to open PNG files with PIL from plugin on with 
windows 64 bits version of QGIS standalone installer
I don't have zip_decoder in binary _image.pyd (same problem on 2.2 and 2.4)

A workaround is to overwrite PIL in QGIS folder with files from PIL 
standalone installer

I've printed methods PIL.Image.core.*_decoder

on QGIS 2.4 64bits:

bit_decoder
fli_decoder
gif_decoder
hex_decoder
msp_decoder
packbits_decoder
pcd_decoder
pcx_decoder
raw_decoder
sun_rle_decoder
tga_rle_decoder
tiff_lzw_decoder
xbm_decoder

on QGIS 2.2 32bits:

bit_decoder
fli_decoder
gif_decoder
hex_decoder
jpeg_decoder
msp_decoder
packbits_decoder
pcd_decoder
pcx_decoder
raw_decoder
sun_rle_decoder
tga_rle_decoder
tiff_lzw_decoder
xbm_decoder
zip_decoder

Subject: [Qgis-developer] error saving project with OpenLayer
Message-ID: <53B272DB.80202@gmail.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,
I'm trying to save a project with just 2 shapefiles (EPSG 432, but I
noticed that the projection doesn't matter) and a OpenLayer file
(OSMCycle, but same error for the other OpenLayer files).

Trying to save the project it appears this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"/home/ma7730/.qgis2/python/plugins/openlayers_plugin/openlayers_layer.py",
line 329, in writeXml
    element.setAttribute("ol_layer_type", str(self.layerType.id))
AttributeError: OlOpenCycleMapLayer instance has no attribute 'id'

I'm on a debian testing machine with QGIS 2.5.

Am I missing something? Should I open a ticket?

Thanks a lot

Matteo

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-H9r-PeZBY18-BVyC4v_TOt=URsNww0ChpTDr1Z4_TFg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

I would like to propose that we remove the single select map tool.

Main reason to remove is its function is redundant as the rectangle select
does a single point select if you don't drag i.e single click.  I live in
rectangle select mode 99% of the time and never have any issues.

As the rectangle select can already do both actions I don't really see the
need to keep both tools when one would suffice.

Thoughts?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Installing Python Modules
Message-ID: <CALwGb1T_=QOUcnoKYCZeP1OrR-d17KzG2UJoXV7WLOGDSTc-Ew@mail.gmail.com>

What are the recommended steps to install additional python modules that
are not included in the standard qgis download package? I am trying to
share some processing scripts to individuals who are not tech savy when it
involves setting up various variables that might be required - instead they
are end users. Previously I would tell them to download anaconda 2.7 and
copy the necessary packages (pandas and pysal) into the site packages of
the qgis folder however that now appears to be broken with a numpy
compiling issue.

I also have seen that there are options
http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/ExternalPythonPackages and
http://nathanw.net/2012/12/19/installing-python-setuptools-into-osgeo4w-python/
that mention methods to install modules using osgeo4w but what do I do if
the user downloaded the standalone installer does that still work? Even
though those steps appear quite simple, for a beginner that might be a
daunting task. I spent the entire day myself trying to solve the problem on
my own personal computer but got frustrated in the end with vcvarsall.bat
error (another windows challenge i need to solve - maybe i should of bought
a mac).

Would be easiest imho if there was a plugin developed to download python
modules through pip or easy install within qgis. Perhaps there has already
been a ticket developed for this that I am not aware of...

Cheers,
Bjorn

Looks like a plugin error. The layer identfication has been changed in the 
newest OL plugin version. Please open a ticket as a reminder.

-1 from me. No scientific reason why, but it would just seem wrong to me to
always use the rectangular selection tool.

So maybe we could change the default selection tool to rectangle? One of
the first thing I personally always do when using a fresh qgis (with
default settings) is to change selection tool to rectangle for the reason
Nathan raised this thread.

My main goal at the moment is to reduce some of the clutter and duplicate,
or shared behavior, tools that we have.  So setting it as a default
wouldn't really solve that issue.  I would only remove it from the UI, it
will still be in the code for the API.

Hi,

Given that the rectangle tool also contains the "select single features
with a click" tool I agree that we could get rid of the "select single
features with a click" tool.

So +1 from me.
+1 also to calling it "Select Features" Tool in the tooltip.

AFAICT the code isn't part of the API anyway.  The point selection tool
actually selects the nearest feature from a 10x10 pixel rectangle.

The rectangle one does the same thing:

  if ( !mDragging )
  {
    QgsMapToolSelectUtils::expandSelectRectangle( mSelectRect, vlayer,
e->pos() );
  }

It does QgsMapToolSelectUtils::setSelectFeatures( mCanvas, selectGeom, e );

while the select *single* feature tool does:

QgsMapToolSelectUtils::setSelectFeatures( mCanvas, selectGeom, false, doDifference, true );

Not sure if it's important to anyone, but the key point apparently is that it
does it for a single feature.

Ohh well I would say not important enough to have two tools.  We could just
move the logic into the Select Rectangle tool if you do a single click.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] python function to upgrade qgs datasources?
Message-ID: <1404223261648-5149022.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi All, 
We are preparing a great postgres migration here, and to make it
transparent, we have given virtual aliases to our server. 
User's QGS file refer today to hard coded IP or aliases (172.16.9.147 or
vslin147). 

We have been migrating most qgs using bash script with grep and sed, but we
seem to touch the limits of such approaches (error handling, disconnected
disks.. editions pending ., some are zipped )

My question, do you think it is possible to have a python function (plugin
or user function), that will catch qgs before loading it, and that will
substitute the host with the new value, before qgis loads the datasource ? 

Any idea?

Cheers

R?gis

Hi R?gis,

I can't help you with the Python script to process your files, but I
have a suggestion:

Use a PostgreSQL service instead of hard-coded IP addresses, names or
aliases.

In such a scenario you can easily change between a production and test
server and more easily migrate to a new machine. Also, on a laptop you
can point the service to localhost (for mobile laptops) and within your
organizations LAN you can point to the production server. All without
touching the .qgs project file.

We in Uster are using PostgreSQL service names for several years now and
I like them. Unfortunately the concept of PostgreSQL services is not
very well-known among the PostgreSQL users.

See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgservice.html
and
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS

Andreas

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO41ng6jcLWunhGD0tTcLVJs5s-KnpmBkGs5HMVny0Q-jQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

It seems I have just encountered a bug in QGIS 2.4. When I open with QGIS
2.4 a project built with QGIS 2.2 containing vector layers with
user-defined fields types (for example "value relations" or "photo", etc.),
I lose all this configurations.

If I have no QML for the vector layers, I simply lose all my configuration
with no possibility to recover them after saving the project with QGIS 2.4.

Anyone confirms this nasty bug ?

Regards,
Michael

Great, thanks Andrea, I knew that system coming from Oracle, but we didn't
find much doc on it so we did not focused a lot. 
Next migration will upgrade to using services for sure.. 
By now, I still have to deal with preexisting documents. 

switch as been done now, iut works anyway ;) let's us materialized views and
foreign data wrappers !

I think this is related to recent work on Norwegian vector format.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] why Difference takes much more time then Clip?
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=z5qcZyJV=28k+yKfr95Ff1abtcLcQLO3LasAfACN8nCQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm doing some tests on fTools/Processing spatial operators, with a cover
multilinestring layer and a base polygon layer.

Running the following query on PostGIS I get similar timings with
st_intersection and st_difference:

select l.osm_id,ST_intersection(l.geom,e.geom) as geom from linee_selezione
as l,edifici_buffer as e where ST_Intersects(l.geom, e.geom)

while if I run the Difference tool QGIS chokes and it takes magnitudes of
more time then Clip.
If made both tools as similar as possible, just changing this [1] line of
code, but the difference in execution time remains big.

I can't find out where is the difference, because both PostGIS and QGIS
base the operations on GEOS.
Any hints?

To be correct, the two postgis queries are:

select min(l.osm_id),st_difference(l.geom,st_union(e.geom)) as geom from
linee_selezione_s l join edifici_buffer_s e
on ST_Intersects(l.geom, e.geom) group by l.geom

select min(l.osm_id),st_intersection(l.geom,st_union(e.geom)) as geom from
linee_selezione_s l join edifici_buffer_s e
on ST_Intersects(l.geom, e.geom) group by l.geom

The package was broken.  It had backslashes instead of forward slashes in the
archive.  Only a problem if you run nsis on Linux, though.

Just two graphics two show a brutal benchmark (measuring time in every

Message-ID: <53B35210.7090707@pp1.inet.fi>

Hi,

thanks to everybody involved to this fine product !

For me not so wonderful yet, last evening was 2.4 for openSuse 12.3 also 
published. I thought ...
Unfortunately for some reason it has been linked with old library, GDAL 
1.10.1,  which means that those options I need are not for use. (I've 
win dev where 1.11.0)
I also noticed that for some reasons Transifex translations are not in 
release-2_4 or master so I cannot do any localized docs for teaching.

Cheers,
Kari

Hi Michael,

Is it maybe the other way round: opening the project works, but not 
loading the widgets from QML?

+1 for leaving both visible options, but defaulting to rectangle.
If the underlying code is different, then even at the expense of the 
extra code required to compute that you have a null-sized rectangle (ie 
a point click), you might want to use the same code.

But, especially for a newbie, it will not be intuitive that by clicking 
without dragging, the rectangle select will do a point-click select.

I feel the developers must always put the user before the code 
simplification.
This because the programmer makes a once-off (big) effort, but there may 
be "millions" of users that suffer if the coder simplifies the coding 
effort at the expense of user intuitive experience.

My 2c,
Regards,
Zoltan

Hi, in my user experience, I feel like Nathan: one tool is more intuitive.
I'm bothered each time I have to explicitly switch to rectangular selection
tool..

I'm not so sure about that - the single click to select one item, click and
drag to marquee select behavior is very common. There's lots of widely used
programs which do the same.

Hi,

-1 : but change the default tool

Reasons:
Users might be used to the select single feature tool and miss it. 
While it's possible for somebody to get used to new interaction designs 
it's an effort and it's not where you want to spend your time worrying.
Second - and more important - The selection tools are already collapsed 
and an additional button there is only shown on demand and not always. 
Therefore the visual clutter impact is minimal. I would rather spend 
the effort on removing / collapsing buttons on the UI which are always 
visible but hardly ever used than tools which may be redundant but are 
only a slight annoyance.

Best regards,
Matthias

Message-ID: <e3228024ce2c1325d870a9b3ddb66a94@carto.net>

Hi,

In addition to the discussion around the selection tool I would like to 
discuss a reduction of buttons in the navigation toolbar. I think it 
eats way too much screen-space by default. I'd like to suggest the 
following:

1. get rid of the refresh button. I never use it. If you have to use it, 
than it is a bug in the software.
2. Potentially remove the "Zoom to Layer" button. It is available in the 
context menu of the layer and in the "View" menu, should you need it.
3. Potentially remove the "Zoom to native resolution button". I think it 
is good enough if this functionality is available in the "View" menu. Do 
people really use this function? Maybe with raster layers?
4. Potentially combine the touch zoom/and pan tool with the pan tool 
into a single tool. Is there a specific reason why both of these tools 
are available? Doesn't the "Touch zoom and pan" also support pan with 
the mouse?
5. Potentially combine the pan to selected and zoom to selected into a 
drop-down button menu, like we have with the measure or select tool.

Alternatively one could remove some of the buttons by default (see 
above) and allow people to re-add them through customization should they 
have the need.

What do people think?

Andreas

I'm in favour of heavily simplifying the GUI. IMHO, the main area where this can
happen is consolidating all the loading (vector, raster, etc.) buttons in the
Browser, adding what is missing there.
All the best.

Hi J?rgen,
I didn't understand if the problem is fixed now or if I have to do
something.
I have updated the repository right now but I'm facing the same error.

Thanks

I'm fine with simplification of the default toolbars, but the tools
should exist to be re-added by the user for customization.

Reason: when you have a specific workflow, making a custom toolbar with
the 5 buttons you need is much faster than digging through menus and
context menus.

In fact I tend to subscribe to the idea that all sensible functions
should be available to be added to a toolbar (there may be some
functions which just don't make any sense on the toolbar)
Without such customization a user would need to create custom plugins or
scripts for seemingly simple functions.


Thanks,
Alex

Right. This brings back to the idea of having standard profiles the user could select
according to the type of work he is doing, and further customize it.
No arrangement will suit all, so if we start removing a toll we'll make someone
complain, and the only option is to leave everything on, as it is now.

Hi,

I just checked the repository, and it looks like J?rgen updated the package already yesterday. So the problem is probably located somewhere else than in the path settings if the problem still occures.

It is furthermore probably worth adding the some info to the OSGeo4W-packaging instructions (so they are more specific about how to tar packages), if Unix path delimiters are required for OSGeo4W (which is not quite obvious I think).

Cheers
Stefan

Hi Matteo,

Yes, quite sure:
http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/x86_64/release/gdal/gdal-sosi/

I did not check the content of the new package though, but I guess it was J?rgen who created the 4.0-2 package, and I cannot imagine that he did something else than fixing the paths-settings...

Another thing to consider in this context is that there are open issues with the gdal-sosi package on Windows[1].
Given that the sosi-driver-plugin works properly with GDAL, but not in QGIS it might be good to have it in OSGeo4W, but not necessarily in the QGIS stand-alone installer or as a dependency of the qgis-full-package (yet)? So, a workaround could be to just remove it from qgis-full dependency list...

Hi,
?
I'am writing a data viewer as python qgis standalone application. Is it possible to use the QgisInterface?and other classes (like QgsLegendInterface) for layer handling (adding, removing, activation, etc.)?
Cause I didn't found a way I have written my own layer model based on qts QAbstractListModel. It's working more or less, but I would prever a nativ solution if available.

Hi Matthias,

Martin Dobias just did a legend-tree redesign which was introduced in 
QGIS 2.4 and should improve situation for plugin developers and derived 
applications a lot.

I don't know if/how this is documented yet.

I hope that Martin can answer this in more detail, perhaps with a 
blog-entry or sample.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How can I reproject a raster and change its file
	type in a plugin?
Message-ID: <49D53E66756E9E4D9310D19261A79ADB2FD491DB@HOLYSTONE.nnpa.com>

I need to reproject rasters and change their file type in a QGIS plugin. Can I do this using the QGIS API? If not, I can do this externally with gdal_translate, but how can I determine the path to gdal_translate in Python?

Thanks

Tom

The package gdal-sosi not creatensis.pl (or QGIS) was broken.  Did you verify
that you only have the latest gdal-sosi package in the "packages-x86_64"
directory and not also the old one?

Please don't make the assumption that I would do this.  Especially not in
this case.  The change is a pure UI driven one and has nothing to do with
removing code, I would cull all the select tools if I wanted to do that :).

The tools have the same behavior so it will be no change to how the user
does selecting.  Most will not even see the change.

Let me worry about where I spend my time.  I'm a big boy :)

It's not visual clutter in the sense of having them all in a row on the
toolbar.  That isn't the issue.  The issue is having two tools which do the
same thing when we can merge into one.  Consider the zoom tool, we don't
have a "zoom on click" and a "zoom to area" tool, we have one tool for both
jobs.

The select tool in the composer also is dual action in this sense so it
makes sense to have one tool in the canvas that is the same.

The slight annoyances build up, hence why pruning like this is a good idea.

Hey Andreas,

I'm working on this one.  I have most done already but hit a compiler error
and was to late in the night to be dealing with C++ errors :)  Should have
it done by the end of the week.

Yes, you could use QgsMapLayerRegistry for adding/removing layer and 
QgsLegendInterface for manage groups and layer visiblity,
but new layer tree is more powerfull.

Hi J?rgen,
well in "packages-x86_64" I found "gdal-sosi-4.0-1.tar.bz2". The same
package is in "packages-x86", but I didn't have any problem with x86.

If I remove the gdal-sosi package and run creatensis again nothing
changes because it downloads the package again.
Can I avoid to include this package in the building process?

Thanks you

Matteo

Hi,

let me jump in here...
a large +1 from me to only keep the select by rectangle tool. I never 
use select by point.

For the record, I'm changing my vote to a +1 for the merge. If a
single click performs a "select single polygon" action, then I think
this is the ideal behaviour.

Users don't only get used to how tools work, but also which tools they
work with. And there's documentation/tutorials out there that build on
the current GUI.

I was talking about the users time, not yours. If I would worry about
your time I'd have better ideas (like get away from Redmond) ;)

I am just not sure if it's a slight annoyance for everybody. I fear that
it's part of the workflow for some (not sure though). And therefore I
have the feeling that the slight annoyance (if at all!) doesn't outweigh
the possible benefits.

That said, this is not a strong opinion. I see the need for polishing
the UI. I just would not start here.
And maybe some UX guys should discuss again if UI changes/icon changes
should be grouped instead of incrementally done. (Nobody will worry for
such a change if introduced with QGIS 3. Or if we say that minor UI
changes will only take place in the autumn release). And the
customization presets discussed (although this particular selection tool
would probably not be affected of these).

+1, single click selects one feature and drag selects features by rectangle.
Of course, we must default the selection tool to the rectangle one, in
addition we must change the tooltip (and maybe the icon too?) to something
more appropriate.

Check if the setup.ini is up-to-date.  You should have gdal-sosi-4.0-2.tar.bz2

Only by specifying the dependencies of qgis-full leaving out gdal-sosi on the
command line (instead of qgis-full or nothing as that it's the default).

More than many on that toolbar actually.

+1 Never used it "native resolution" myself from the nav bar. Always right
click on a layer - that would probably be the most logical place to leave
both functions/

Just my 2p.

No no - not suggesting that at all - only saying that programming effort 
should always be second to user experience/intuitiveness.

I'm swaying a bit towards agreeing with dropping the single select - 
also because the cursor does not change, so you might anyway forget what 
the last icon was, that you clicked (yes, different issue).

So, may I suggest that we go with it (using "rectangle" for both single 
and group select), but that we also change the "hover-popup help" to 
indicate the dual usage.

I guess a new user is likely to hover the mouse over the icons, and if 
they are told there that "click is single and drag is rectangle select, 
they would find that experience sufficient.

Regards,
Zoltan

Hi Jonathan,

Thanks for your reply. Can you explain in what circumstances you need 
the refresh button? What are those bugs that need you to manually 
refresh the canvas?

Would it suffice to have the refresh function on the "F5" shortcut key 
and in the "View" menu rather than occupying a button by default? You 
would still have the option to add the button back with customization. I 
would assume that "F5" would be much faster than pressing a button 
anyway. F5 seems to pretty standard in any software, like file browsers, 
web browsers, etc.

BTW: I found out that the "F5" key is currently broken. It does not 
reload the canvas. Here is the bug-report:

 QMenu.popup() function
Message-ID: <B1BDA7B93091A044A4878A686846FDB7010A870A29@SRVEXMB11.master.local>

I am developing a qgis python plugin which uses a maptool receiving key pressed events by keyPressEvent(self, event) function, mouse movements events by canvasMoveEvent(self, event) function and mouse press events by canvasPressEvent(self, event) function. When the user right clicks on the canvas I want to display a contextual menu creating a QMenu object and running its popup function. When the control returns to canvas my maptool continue to receive only mouse movements and mouse press events and NOT key pressed events. Why canvas doesn't send key pressed events anymore ? Is that any workaround ?
Thank you

While I agree that the rectangle select achieves the same as the single point tool (and more), I'm watching most of the other users at my work and noticing that they seem to expect to have to change tools.

If the default was changed to rectangle, I'd expect that most would change it the first time that they needed to do a single point select anyway.

-ramon.

I found out that the "F5" key did not work because the plugin reloader 
plugin also assigned the F5 key for reloading the selected plugin. I 
closed the bug therefore.

And if they try to change back to the single point selection but the tool
is missing, what do you think they will do?
I'm quite sure that after 20 seconds they will use the rectangle selection
tool to click on the map.

Hi,

to clarify my previous email I want to give the reason why I need ogr 1.11.

"Since OGR 1.11, the GML driver supports reading :
- Finnish National Land Survey GML files (a.k.a MTK GML) for topographic 
data.
- Finnish National Land Survey GML files for cadastral data.
- Cadastral data in Inspire GML schemas.
- Czech RUIAN Exchange Format (VFR)."
this is from http://www.gdal.org/drv_gml.html

The second attempt for openSuse 12.3 this evening didn't change the 
situation. Now I'm guessing; due some other reason/application gdal is 
not upgraded in repo and thus in opensuse environment we have to stay in 
1.10.1 for ever ? Or do I have to buy again a new desktop machine and 
install here some other distro ? ;)

All the best,
Kari

+1 for simplifying the ui !

The rationale about old users not liking changes doesn't hold against the
rationale new users needing an easy software, since we have way more future
users than current users ;)

Hi,

+1 for dropping the select-by-point part of the tool and making
select-by-rect the default.

However, I really think the icon, as Giuseppe noted, needs updated to
indicate the change (even if the select-by-rect hasn't actually changed).
Maybe just adding a pronounced or colored point to the upper left corner of
the rectangle will be enough.

Regards,

Larry

Message-ID: <CACasjBR98QUWQCeuw+iOARKwUog3P7v_ReB5i_CmrxAu7izwow@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all.

I want make a QGIS Python plugin with unit test using the 'Plugin Builder'
The 'Plugin Builder' make some unit test class automatically in test folder
like as test_init.py,  test_translations.py.
I want to do unit test by these class but I had failed.

This is my unit test code.

> import unittest
> import MyPlugin
> from MyPlugin.test.test_init import TestInit
> suite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(TestInit)
> unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=2).run(suite)


But, execute results is like this.

Does anyone confirm? Should I open a ticket?

Hi all.
After each release we have a spike in donations, that partly covers our bugfixing
effort. For 2.4, apparently the increase is more marked, probably as a result of the
(IMHO discreet and gentle) invitation to donate from the download page.
A success, overall. Thanks to Richard and others for setting this up.

Hello all,

I'm currently running 2.5 and I am not able to find one very useful 
feature (under my opinion) of plugin installer. I miss the ability to 
'see' where are the plugin is accessible through the GUI. For instance, 
I remember that for installed plugins there was a phrase like "You can 
find pluginX under vector>whatever>whateveragain".

Is there any chance of recover this?

All the best,

The info is there:
Category: Vector
which means the plugin will be under the Vector menu.
Maybe it could be made more clear.

In my experience, disappearing lines was also an issue in the previous
versions. Closing and reopening the model builder used to help.

If lines disappear, you could also moove the two scrollbars to the top and
left. It works for me.

Hi
This problem was there in the previous version. It's kind of annoying but
if you give it a jiggle, either by zooming in or out or moving the scroll
bars they should reappear.

In my experience, its gets worse as you add more actions.

Do you have any numeric output/input defined? The text is just a list of
available ones, with the letter used to identify them, such as:

a - output MEAN from algorithm "Raster statistics"

Maybe in the case of not having variables, I can put a text saying "No
variables availalble"

* text in the box is not selectable.

The text is just a reference to e read, not to be selected

Ideas about how to improve this module are welcome. Thanks!

Yes, it was there before and I haven't been able to fix it :-( Scrolling to
top-left corner makes the lines reappear, as it has been mentioned

Hi J?rgen,
I've checked the setup.ini in the packages-x86_64 directory and the
gdal-sosi version is the old one:

@ gdal-sosi
sdesc: "OGR SOSI Driver"
ldesc: "The OGR SOSI Driver enables OGR to read data in Norwegian SOSI
standard (.sos)"
category: Libs
requires: gdal msvcrt
version: 4.0-1
install: x86_64/release/gdal/gdal-sosi/gdal-sosi-4.0-1.tar.bz2 107731
5f6369cecb42d857e3251d3ace3cb4bc
[prev]
version: 4.0-1
install: x86_64/release/gdal/gdal-sosi/gdal-sosi-4.0-1.tar.bz2 107731
5f6369cecb42d857e3251d3ace3cb4bc


I've updated the repo right now but nothing changed.
As a temporary workaround, can I delete the gdal-sosi lines from the
setup.ini? This way the package should be successfully created without
sosi right?

Thanks

Matteo

That's not the current one.

http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/x86_64/setup.ini has:

Did you remove the old setup.ini from packages-x86_64?  Did the old one get
refetched?  Are you behind a (caching) proxy?

It probably will still include it - as qgis-full points to it and the packages
is already there.

If I may...

+1 For dropping single point selection button.

I think that having too many options\buttons can sometimes be overwhelming
for new users, and in this case users won't notice much difference in usage
anyway (do we need to decide what to do with the icon).

Now I've removed it and re-launced creatensis.. It seems working!

Are you behind a (caching) proxy?

No proxy here

Just for info: in the meanwhile I've tried to launch creatensis after
having removed the sosi lines from setup.ini.
Package has been created (for now I cannot test if the package works
because I'm not on a 64bit machine).

Thanks!

I think making it selectable will not hurt anyway.
Thanks, I'll keep on letting you know my feelings as I dig deeper.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CALuHMPCLe0GUqnQ=kvzZZ5bO3bGGD3V-RidOiXNcF3PDJX472A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

seems symbolForFeature() method does not works as expected for most
renderers:
 * QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2 ? returns feature symbol
 * QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2 ? returns None and in debug output
    I have message saying "there are no hashed symbols!!!"
 * QgsGraduatedSymbolRendererV2 ? just crashes QGIS
 * QgsRuleBasedRendererV2 ? returns None

All tests made with point shapefile. Here is code snipped I used (load vector
layer and activate it first):

layer = iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
feat = layer.getFeatures().next()
renderer = layer.rendererV2()
symbol = renderer.symbolForFeature(feat)

For me this is major issue that makes difficult to develop plugins that works
with layer symbology (e.g. symbology import/export/conversion)

Anyone confirms? Should I open a ticket?


Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Doesn't measure tools/calculations + ellipsoid +
	OTFR require a rethinking?
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=yD+r0=F0rfKUhbXFsBqtK1+uNw5T6zKn3RkgLi4ka2qQ@mail.gmail.com>

This topic comes back often, and in various situations I find me in a tight
spot when coming to explain the intricacies of the relationships between
these concepts.

Can we try to make the point on this, trying at least to layout a clean
"intersection matrix" between the various situations?
The concepts/tools involved in measurements and length/area calculations
are:

 - OTFR
 - Project CRS (GRS/PRS)
 - Measure Ellispoid
 (- Unit of measure)

We could try to write the various combinations:

1) Project with GSR + OTFR off
    -> Ellispoid is Planar (and cannot be changed)
    -> Measurements are wrong

 2) Project with GSR + OTFR on
     -> Ellispoid is set, e.g. WGS84 (and can be changed). This is set to
the last selcted layer's CRS.
     -> Measurements are right (given the correct ellipsoid is set)

etc.

If you have a better way to discuss the topic, great ;)
I think it's an important point, because most users are not aware of such
complexities underlying this tools...

Matthias Kuhn showed me a workaround
(http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10096#note-1). My code is like this:

# initialize symbol rendering
renderer = QgsMapRenderer()
layer.rendererV2().startRender(renderer.rendererContext(),
                                             layer.pendingFields() if
apiChanged23 else layer)

for f in layer.getFeatures():
  symbol = layer.rendererV2().symbolForFeature(f)
  print symbol.color().name()

layer.rendererV2().stopRender(renderer.rendererContext())

Hi Minoru,

thanks for information. As I can see from ticket, this was fixed about
month ago, but now exists again. Also this issue still exists with
other renderers.

I will reopen 10096 and add more information to tickets about other
renderers

Like with renderFeature() call, the symbolForFeature() method must be
called in between startRender()/stopRender() calls, otherwise the
behaviour is undefined. It would be nice though not to crash and emit
a warning instead...

QgisInterface and QgsLegendInterface will not work if you are
developing a standalone application. As Andreas suggested, if you base
your application on QGIS 2.4, you can use new layer tree classes:
QgsLayerTreeView + QgsLayerTreeModel for Qt model/view and
QgsLayerTreeGroup + QgsLayerTreeLayer classes for the actual hierarchy
that will be used by the model and view classes. There is some doxygen
documentation in the header files, but I am in the process of
preparing some blog posts about the new classes... stay tuned!

I agree it would be good to address this finally.

Indeed it is important to identify all the possible cases and how they
should be handled. We should probably also rethink how the information
about the current mode of operation will be presented to the user. It
should be easy to understand how changes of some settings affect other
settings.

Hi!

I have sent a mail to SBL and found this thread which I could reply to.
If I can be of any assitance I will help the best I can.
I experience the same problems on my Windows machine with QGIS and .sos
files as some of you have reported.
I am on version 2.4.0 of QGIS.
I have downloaded a set of .sos files from the mapping autorities of Norway.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Datum Transformation with target_crs_code
	different than 4326 gives huge errors
Message-ID: <1404508066.33497.YahooMailNeo@web122305.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I've been doing some tests and found that, using a different target_crs_code than 4326 (wgs84), Datum Transformation simply ignores the values ??of transformation.

For example, using this queries to insert a new tfm (EPSG:5037 http://epsg.io/5037) in srs.db:

insert into tbl_datum_transform (coord_op_code,source_crs_code,target_crs_code,coord_op_method_code,p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,remarks,scope,preferred,deprecated,area_of_use_code)
values (100050,4274,4258,9606,-230.994,102.591,25.199,0.633,-0.239,0.900,1.950,'Derived in July 2009 from 119 common stations. Residuals at 833 test points under 2m. Replaces Datum 73 to ETRS89 (3) (tfm code 1992).','2-metre accuracy.',0,0,1294);

insert into tbl_datum_transform (coord_op_code,source_crs_code,target_crs_code,coord_op_method_code,p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,remarks,scope,preferred,deprecated,area_of_use_code)
values (100051,4274,4326,9606,-230.994,102.591,25.199,0.633,-0.239,0.900,1.950,'Derived in July 2009 from 119 common stations. Residuals at 833 test points under 2m. Replaces Datum 73 to ETRS89 (3) (tfm code 1992).','2-metre accuracy.',0,0,1294);

The only difference between them is target_crs_code. The result of Datum Transformation tool:
- tfm 5037 (4274 - > 4258): more than 123m error!
- tfm 5037 changed, using exactly the same transformation parameters, but with target_crs_code 4326 (4274 - > 4326): error ~0.313m.

The error we get is huge, and I get exactly the same error if I set the shift values all to zero. It simply ignores the transformation using a different target_crs than 4326. The exception are NTv2 grids. Assigning them different target_crs, work well (there is one with target_crs 4150 and seven with 4258).

Actually it's even worse than ignoring, because if I do not choose any transformation and do "Cancel" on the Datum Transformation window, the point is reprojected based on the values ??of default CRS +towgs84 parameter (gives an error of about 1.13m). With this data I am testing (EPSG:3763 vs. EPSG:27493), even without using on-the-fly reprojection, the difference between the point is only about 3.2m. Using target_crs 4258 in srs.db, regardless of the values??, the error is more than 123m.

Maybe it generate some conflict with +towgs84 parameter?

The most recent transformations in some European countries are calculated for 4258 and with this issue we can not use them in QGIS.

I've opened a ticket here [0], where I put test data and images of the results.


Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Debuggin pointed me to the problem: a lot of EMPTY GEOMETRYCOLLECTIONS
caused QgsVectorFileWriter to write a lot of log messages. Commenting line
1718 [1] made the process run to the end in linear time.

Wouldn't be nice having an option (from the GUI) to disable logging?

I think it should be save to set the target_CRS in the QGIS Datum 
transformation tool internally to 4326 if 4258 is provided, or fill in 
the tfm values directly to target_CRS 4326 (although the EPSG database 
has 4258). Nadgrids work differently, but could be handled the same way. 
WGS84 and ETRS89 are still considered as identical.

As I reported in a previous post, I was unable to conclude a difference
operation on a vector because the tool was running in exponential time.

Debugging pointed me to the problem: QgsVectoFileWriter was logging tons of
empty geometres with an incompatible type which will be discarded.
After commenting the line of logging the process completed in linear time.

Shouldn't we offer the opportunity to turn QgsLogger off? This would let
the user/developer to switch it off whenever he already knows what's
happening.
Is it already there and I missed it?

What error message did you get and wouldn't it be better to kill them where it
origins or to issue a final "%n empty geometries skipped" instead of logging
individual errors. 

Alternatively we could issue a "last message repeated %n times" in message log
to make it behave better - although that only works the error message are
identical.

Hi Jurgen,
I wouldn't call them errors. GEOSDIfference returned a lot of empty
geomcollections, which the QgsVectorFileWriter couldn't manage.
Consequently it wrote a log message for each geometry it couldn't write [1].

Surely the logging should be improved in this specific case. Anyway, I
think the option to turn QgsMessageLog off could be useful anyway...

Hi Martin,

if I want to insert a new layer below some other one, I need to know the
position of that one. I'm trying to find an index or so in Python, but
cannot find it?

Is there already a way to do this? (I want to put a buffer below the
layer it has buffered)

Regards,

Richard

Hi GioHappy,

the empty-collection is absolutelly not necessarylly a bug.
It is the obviously result of an operation on a machine (like the
computer) with a binary finite arithmetic.

Usually the empty is due to a too low value to be describe with a
finite binary arithmetic.

If the dataset is small or it is topologically correct (this not mean
only to be snapped).
 the collection results never happened.
Instead if the dataset is not topologically correct and is big the
probability to have some collection result grow.
We tipically have alway an 0.01% of collection on our results.

I suggest you to use directly postgis or spatialite to do this kind of
operations.

In these products you have the useful tools to resolve the collections
correctly.

Regard,

Andrea.

Hi Andrea, as I said above I'm not considering it an error.
The topic of this post is QGIS message logging.
The processing completes as expected, with the same results as Spatialite
and PostGIS. These simply do it silently :)

Ok, sorry.

Just a my personal curiosity:
The difference could give also a collection not empty.
If the difference of two polygons is a collection with some polygons,
some lines and some points.
What happened to this collection in QGIS ?

Thx,
A.

AFAICS whenever a new feature needs to be created, geom collections are
discarded, because QGIS cannot manage them.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] RasterFileWriter creates 5 times bigger geotiff
	then gdal_translate
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=wxjC7xaEUoxV4qW2ApBLDj+q5ZH=vNneZLfn5z8P37uw@mail.gmail.com>

Causally I hit the save as raster dialog, and I tried to export a raster to
layer (coming from an ASCII Grid source) to Geotiff, with no creation
options set.
The result was a file 3 times bigger then the original ASCII, and 5 times
bigger then the Geotiff created by gdal_translate.

gdalinfo on the files give same results (except statistics missing from the
one created by RasterFileWriter).
Does gdal_translate do some optimizations that RFW doesn't?
I wasn't aware that two Geotiffs, apparently with the same properties,
could be so different in size...

Thx GioHappy, this is imprtant for me to know.

So is surely better to use the postgis or spatialite
because it allow you to extract from the collection the section with
the right type.

If you do a difference beetwen two polygons is the result is a
collection with a polygon section and a point section.
You should extract the polygon and discard the point.
If the strategu is discard all the collection this mean that on qgis
the difference could lost domething of important and so potentially
the difference do a wrong result.

Regards,
Andrea.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Geom collection and QGIS (was QgisLogger can
 be a serious bottleneck)
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=wudT6ziB3QDGRdafUgm=F1Z8C6H_476V67tS+m24wWkw@mail.gmail.com>

(I changed the topic)

Geometry collections in QGIS must be treated at the GEOS level.
There isnt a QGIS::wkbType for geometry collections, so if GEOS return a
collection they must be managed as GEOS geometries, before "moving them up"
to QgsGeometry.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Selection Within Stacked Geometry
Message-ID: <BLU178-W8661441A30948F7DFB36BBD030@phx.gbl>

I'm working with conflict data, and because of escalation (e.g., kidnappings, bombings and insurgent attacks can lead to full-scale territorial disputes), temporal point features can become stacked. I was initially trying to figure out a way to highlight a record within a selected set in the attribute table and zoom to that point without loosing the original selection, but the Advanced Filter may be the best way to handle that. As I was panning the map, though, I noticed some locations that should have been selected from my query, and upon inspection, realized they were stacked points. Evidently the points on top prevented me from seeing the selected ones underneath. Even using the point displacement renderer (which is a pretty slick tool, btw) the selection was still hidden in the original point stack. Should I not be able to see my selections on the map canvas in relation to my other point data or is there a setting or trick here that I'm missing?
 
I'm a relatively new QGIS user, so please take that into consideration. I'm sure this has been discussed before, and I did some online searches but came up with very little. I did find this, but nothing related to point selections or how those would be affected by feature request changes. If I missed a solution, I would greatly appreciate a nudge in the right direction, but perhaps the development community is still reviewing how best to handle this...
 
Win 7 x64 SP1
QGIS 2.4.0 (x64 standalone installer)
 
Thanks in advance for any feedback,
James

I haven't spot tha exact point where this happens but QGIS exports Float64,
even if the origin was Float32.

Is wrong.
The geos return a collection when the collectionis the right result.

if the result is a collection like:
collection (multipolygons, multilinestrings, multipoint)

why it should remove the lines and points.

It could be useful to the client.
The fact that the client is capable to understand only point/line and
polgons is a problem of the client , not of the geos.

If the invoker is not capable to understand collection, but it want do
operation that could return collection.
The invoker (the client) should increase him matematics capability ,
not decrease the capability of geos.
:)

In postgis and spalite is easy manage this kind of situation even if
the table is not a collection.

With a  "ExtractFromCollection(ForceToCollection(geometry)..)"
you can easily to resolve the problem on postgis/spatialite.

If this capability is not available in qgis is a problem of qgis not of geos.

:)

Well, Andrea, QGIS adopts GEOS capabilities as far as it can.
As you will know it doesn't support Z and M geoms as well.
I hope future founders will help extending its capabilities...

Sorry for the buzz. It's not QGIS fault, it's GDAL itself which reads the
ASCII Grid as Float64, but I wonder why contrarily gdalinfo and
gdal_translate treats it as Float32...

I fail to see how Giovanni is 'wrong' here. Unless I am incorrect, he is
suggesting that QGIS do exactly the same thing, i.e. implement something
like ExtractFromCollection() where needed, when the geometry is converted
from GEOS to QgsGeometry.

This seems like a very reasonable interim solution until such time that a
type of 'collection' can be supported (no small feat, I am guessing).

Larry

Hi Larry,

probably I don't understand well the concept of "at geos level".

My english is worsened ultimately.
:(


I understand that Giovanni say to add some change to geos library , to
change the methods or adding some new method in the geos.
:)

I agree that the solution is to add to qgis the capability to receive
a collection and extract a basic type (simple o multi
point,line,poly) from it.

Regards,

A.

You misunderstood me Andrea. I've never said that :)
I said that when geometry collections need to be treated within QGIS, you
have to work at the GEOS level.

Hi again.
Some of you have said something about opening sosi-files
in QGIS. I myselft haven't found any other place than in the
file explorer, but opening from there i get the error message.
I have tried to look in the toolbox for gdal but havnet found anything there
for sosi.

Matthias,

have a look at the Layer list widget for PyQGIS applications [1], perhaps
it could fit your needs.

Not sure if it works on recent QGIS versions, though.

Regards,

The GDAL mentioned is only available if you use the OSGEO4W Shell icon. 
It is a command line application. Typing ogrinfo --formats lists all 
available vector data formats. You will find "SOSI" there if it is 
correctly installed. The list is not sorted alphabetically.

If SOSI is listed, you can transform the file into other formats using 
ogr2ogr.

Hi Joost. Thank you for your answer!

Do you know the sosi library?

I manages to use the shell and I am creating shapfiles from sosi.
I have some problems with the placename files though. They only show up as
dots.

Is using only the .shp files the usual way to handle .shp files, or do you
use the other files as well when it comes to displaying and using the
shapefiles as part a map?

I`m not familiar with this a 100%

Hi James,

Please try with the latest gdal-sosi package (1.11.0-2).  QGIS opens the
dataset several times, but sosi did file locking on windows and that prevented
that.   I removed it from fyba (isn't done on unix either) and now it appears
to work.

The new set of gdal packages also adds GeoPDF support and has some fixes for
Pg, NAS and mssql, that didn't make it into 1.11.0.

I'm talking about OSGeo4W, if that wasn't obvious anyway.

Hi Jurgen! Si nice of you to help me.

Correct me if I`m wrong, but I got the sosi->shapefile to work through the
OsGeo4w shell.
And from that I can open the shapefiles in QGIS.

I guess I can`t do it in another way in QGIS yet?

I have some questions about the creation process.
Doing a job on one sosi-file creates both lines, points and polygon shape
files. Why?

And the placename shapefile opened in QGIS only gives me a set of points in
the display. (Both iso and utf8 of the the sosi)

I`m going to use the shapefiles in my own application so I just want to look
at the files in QGIS first.

Tommy

Hi J?rgen,

And that fixes everything :)

I now get the option to select SOSI in the files of type drop down menu in the vector file open dialog in both 32 bit and 64 bit.

Both 32 and 64 bit versions of QGIS open SOSI files correctly with the file I used previously. I will do some more testing tomorrow and write back if I find any problems.

Thank you very much for your help, this is excellent news for us.

James

I'm talking about OSGeo4W, if that wasn't obvious anyway.

Hi,

Just to double check a couple of things, 1) you need to install the gdal-sosi package using the OSGeo4W installer. 2) You will need to update all packages using the OSGeo4W installer as the changes J?rgen has made seem to have been made today.

If you go into QGIS and select Add Vector Layer from the Layer menu (these instructions assume an English GUI, obviously if you are using the Norwegian translated GUI it will be in Norwegian). 
Here you need to make sure Source type is set to File. 
Click browse. 
In the bottom right hand corner of the open file dialog, you will see a drop down menu. 
Here you should find an option for SOSI. 
Select a SOSI file and select and click open.
Click Open
A dialog will appear allowing you to select which layers from the SOSI file to open. Choose the ones you want and select OK.
QGIS will load the data.

Hope this helps.

James

Hi James!

Ok, now we`re getting somewhere.

With regards to both 1 and 2. How do I do that?

I tried to build the package myself yesterdal, with the UT.lib, GM.lib and
FYBA lib but when it came to the nmake process and further on (in Visual
studio) I met a wall. :-)

Right now I get an error trying to do as you described. Guess that`s because
1 and 2 isn`t met.

Tommy

BTW I also added CMake files.   If already sent it to Stefan - as I saw commits
from him in the fyba rep - but it's already here[1] now.

Not quite.  Apparently the sosi plugin also somehow produces a noise[1] and
that's still there.

@Tommy: 
I have created a short blog post on how to enable SOSI support when installing QGIS using OSGeo4W.

http://jamesinnorway.net/2014/07/06/qgis-2-4-and-sosi/

I havent compiled anything from source for this.

Let me know if it helps.

@J?rgen:

I have had the sound issue before on my work machine (Windows 7), but it was only when the SOSI file wouldnt open. Now that the files open I do not get the problem on my home machine (Windows 8 - but never noticed if it was there before so cant comment on that).

Hi again J?rgen

One other thing I have noticed on 64 bit is that gdal-python package has a different version number (1.11.0-3) than in 32 bit (1.11.0-2). This version number is different to all the other packages which are 1.11.0-2.

When opening QGIS 64 bit, I get an error message as follows (works fine in 32 bit for me):

@Tommy:
I have created a short blog post on how to enable SOSI support when installing QGIS using OSGeo4W.

http://jamesinnorway.net/2014/07/06/qgis-2-4-and-sosi/

I havent compiled anything from source for this.

Let me know if it helps.

@J?rgen:

I have had the sound issue before on my work machine (Windows 7), but it was only when the SOSI file wouldnt open. Now that the files open I do not get the problem on my home machine (Windows 8 - but never noticed if it was there before so cant comment on that).

Hi Fischer and James!

I don`t know how to use the patch link.
Sorry for this.

I have this strange noise too, using QGIS 2.2 standalone, and the old 
SOSI driver for GDAL 1.10 from OSGEO4W manually moved to Valmieras 
gdal-plugin folder. The buzz comes just before the error message.

I never heard that on any other data source.

Hi James and Fischer!

How should I go about to export a sosi -file (which I have edited with my
own symbology) to shapefile?
It seems that I loose the information tied to the different object types,
when I do it via Layer -> save as...

I am using QGIS 2.4 built using qgis source code and qt creator in
ubuntu. I am unable to find openlayers plugin in the list of plugin
repository. I have a two questions

1. Whether it is not compatible with this version or my build has some problems?

2. If its not compatible then how long it will take the community to
release the compatible version?

Hi Ali,

You can use this method instead of OpenLayers Plugin :
Using Map Tile Servers in QGIS 2.4 
http://www.konstantingreger.net/using-map-tile-servers-in-qgis-2-4/

Hi Ali,

You'll find examples here :

Remember that using Google Maps needs to accept the Google licence.

My hackish way to open it in the QGIS Cloud plugin is:

        logDock = self.iface.mainWindow().findChild(QDockWidget, 'MessageLog')
        logDock.show()

Hi J?rgen,

So with further testing it appears we have found some problems with other SOSI files.

It seems things work quite well with simple files (like the naturvernomr?de data for Rogaland I and others have tested with), but we get problems when opening bigger files. 

One thing we have noticed is that a lot of the problems seem to happen when you try and load more than one type of geometry types from a sosi file at once. If I select all 3 geometry types in one go (or load 2 or more individually) QGIS crashes. If we just load one geometry type, and then close it and load another geometry type, it works fine.

We are also getting problems with files that contain a lot of data, in this situation QGIS will crash with just one layer loaded.

And when QGIS starts to error, I get the noise problem mentioned here too http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10746 .

So a few issues, but it's a great start that it works with some data :)

If people would like copies of these datasets for testing, I can provide them.

James

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS TMS provider?
Message-ID: <CALuHMPAsqKiQ+pgC6_N2evO=uGgJ7GaGbnRJ3BbQ_-moc2sn9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

TMS (Tile Map Service) is an easy way to work with different tiled
maps. It can be used to access local or remote maps. We already have
great OpenLayers plugin
that provides access to some popular maps like Google or OSM. There is also
"Load TMS Layer" plugin that allows to load some TMS maps in QGIS.

But both this plugins are limited only to predefined servers/maps,
users can't add
new services without some handwork. For OpenLayers plugin it is necessary to
create corresponding HTML/CSS files, for Load TMS Layer ? write service
definition in XML format.

Does it makes sense to develop TMS provider for QGIS (native or GDAL-based) to
allow users create connections to different services and/or local tilesets?
Comments and opinions are welcome.

Do these files work fine with ogr2ogr?
Just to make clear that it is not a GDAL issue.

Hi

Should it be possible to make a self referencing relation (= referencing layer and referenced layer are the same qgis layer)? I can define such a relation but opening the attribute table ends up with qgis using 100 % cpu. I'm on master.

Hi Stefan,

Yes it is possible, but there is no limitation of nesting forms, that's 
most likely what eats up your cpu.
Alternatively, if you toggle the checkbox "show embedded form", does it 
work?

Best,
Matthias

There is already a simple TMS driver in GDAL [1], it would be easiest to
make a wrapper/plugin that uses this wms mini-driver instead of writing
from scratch, as was done for the following plugins.

If you are talking about my "Load TMS layer" plugin [2] that I discussed a
few weeks ago, I have not released it because some TMS services cannot be
used legally, so it is not as useful as I thought initially.

There is also the TileMapScaleLevels plugin [3] which was not approved for
similar reasons, but it seems that the offending code has been removed from
the github repos.

Perhaps you could check both out and give your feedback.

regards,
Etienne

You cannot use the google maps TMS "service", it is not allowed under the
Google Maps TOS.

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO4QZBrk56Ln172rzWZGXYqAPyAo7jjYj1yKXogO78zMAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to share an issue I am having while trying to simply export a
composition as PDF.

Under QGIS 2.2, I had no problem, but QGIS 2.4 Segfault with the simple
steps :

c = QgsComposition( QgsMapSettings() )
c.setPaperSize( 290, 210 )
c.setPrintResolution( 100 )
c.setSnapGridOffsetX( 3.5 )
c.setSnapGridOffsetY( 0 )
c.setSnapGridResolution( 2.5 )
c.setNumPages( 1 )

cl = QgsComposerLabel( c )
cl.setItemPosition( 0, 10, 100, 100 )
content = 'test'
cl.setText( content )
cl.setFrameEnabled( False )
c.addItem( cl )

c.exportAsPDF( '/tmp/test.pdf' )

NB: I just discoverd that QgsComposition( QgsMapRenderer() ) is deprecated
since QGIS 2.4 as explained here: http://www2.qgis.org/api/deprecated.html
But using it or the new instanciation does not change the problem.

Has anyone any hint on this issue ?

Thanks in advance
Michael

I just tested the method shown in the Python Cookbook [1] instead of the
exportAsPDF method, which also segfault my QGIS 2.4 (ubuntu) when the
render method is called :


printer = QPrinter()
printer.setOutputFormat(QPrinter.PdfFormat)
printer.setOutputFileName("/tmp/out.pdf")
printer.setPaperSize(QSizeF(c.paperWidth(), c.paperHeight()),
QPrinter.Millimeter)
printer.setFullPage(True)
printer.setColorMode(QPrinter.Color)
printer.setResolution(c.printResolution())
pdfPainter = QPainter(printer)
paperRectMM = printer.pageRect(QPrinter.Millimeter)
paperRectPixel = printer.pageRect(QPrinter.DevicePixel)

c.render(pdfPainter, paperRectPixel, paperRectMM)

Last test : No segfault if I save an image with the method2 method :

https://gist.github.com/mdouchin/6d7408980f737959075b

It seems my segfault is related to the use of the PDF printer in my Ubuntu
box.

Any help appreciated.

Michael

Hi all.
Apparently the
SRID is missing when attempting to batch import:

Algorithm Import into PostGIS starting...
Algorithm Import into PostGIS correctly executed...
Algorithm Import into PostGIS starting...
Error importing to PostGIS Errore nella creazione della sorgente dati
"public"."fvg_": ERROR: AddGeometryColumn() - invalid SRID CONTESTO:

varying,character varying,integer,character varying,integer,boolean)
line 5 at SQL statement

When importing one by one, everything OK.

BTW, it would be good to put sensible defaults for schema name (either
public or a dropdown) and table name (same as shp name, better if
converted with lowercase): should I open a ticket?

All the best, and thanks.

Hi Andre,

Are there any specific tests that you would like me to run?

Or will it suffice with a basic ogr2ogr command like:

ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" out Kystkontur_generalisert.SOS

Do these files work fine with ogr2ogr?
Just to make clear that it is not a GDAL issue.

That would be my first try.

And any other operations in GDAL that use vector data.

Hi Matthias

I have a layer with 3 polygons. Even without changing the edit widget to "relation reference" it eats my cpu. Toggle the checkbox doesn't help.

Float64 in QGIS layer properties metadata Data Type and gdalinfo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Virtual fields or auto-update trigger?
Message-ID: <53BBAECD.3080001@carto.net>

Hi,

Is someone working on "virtual fields" or auto-update triggers where a
field value would update after the feature was created, with a QGIS
expression?

Main use-case would be field widgets in forms where one wants to display
derived data.

This has been discussed several times, but it something in the works?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi,

I haven't yet tested it.

Would it automatically update if data in other widgets change without
having to press the save button first or having to close/open the form?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Radim,
it seems so.
If verified that both gdalinfo and qgis.bin are pointing to the same
libgdal:

>ldd /usr/bin/gdalinfo
libgdal.so.1 => /usr/lib/libgdal.so.1

>ldd /usr/bin/qgis.bin
libgdal.so.1 => /usr/lib/libgdal.so.1

Doing a debug sessione I've seen that Float64 is set by GDAL here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/gdal/qgsgdalprovider.cpp#L1076

Here it is an excerpt of the original ASCII:

Hi Andre,

I have now tested on 3 different machines with 3 different datasets.

Machines tested:

1) Work desktop running Windows 7
2) Work laptop running Windows 8
3) Home laptop running Windows 8

Datasets tested:

1) Naturvernomr?de (NATVERNOMR.SOS)
2) Naturtyper (NATURTYPER.SOS)
3) Felles kystkontur generalisert (Kystkontur_generalisert.SOS)

All 3 of these datasets are available here and are as they were when I downloaded them - I have not edited the data at all.

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B6r5nAOdEBZramdzNi15YzNqZUU&usp=sharing

ogr2ogr:

The following ogr2ogr commands complete fine on all 3 machines and the shapefiles open without any problems. 

ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" kystkontur Kystkontur_generalisert.SOS
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" naturtyper NATURTYPER.SOS
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" natvernomr NATVERNOMR.SOS

It appears that all data is converted when I check the number of records in the SOSI file against the number of converted records in the shapefiles. The only warnings I get are about normalized/laundered field names, but I assume that's due to me converting to a shapefile.

QGIS:

In QGIS, I can only hear the popping noise on Windows 7. QGIS crashes on Windows 7 as well. The two Windows 8 machines experience no problems with the 3 sosi files that are available from the link above. The data loads and displays correctly, and QGIS never shutdowns unexpectedly. I get fewer problems when I load only one of the geometry types from one SOSI file.

So I don't know if this is a specific Windows 7 thing or not.

Hope this helps.

James

That would be my first try.

And any other operations in GDAL that use vector data.

Hi all.
I have just noticed that when digitizing new shapes, they get written
in a PostGIS table in a reverse order respect to the digitizing order;
I kind of remember it was not a while a go: does anybody know if the
behavious was changed on purpose?
All the best.

Hi everyone and thanks for the post lately.

I don`t konow if I am completly off road here, but I have and issue that I
suspect COULD be related to GDAL.

I am working with a .Net forms application i Visual Studio 2013 which uses
Dot Spatial.

>From what I can read it is based somehowe on GDAL.

Now, tonight, out of the blue really, I get an "out of memory" message when
I try to open a GeoTiff in the Dot Spatial map control.
I say out of the blue because it came just like that.

I must have done something or something must have happened, but I can`t
figure out what.

Has this something to do with the GDAL/OGR me and James have been working on
lately and I have installed on this machine? Has there been an automatic
update somewhere?

I just wanted to ask....

Tommy

Hi Tommy,

Unfortunately this list is not really the correct place to ask this question. It is possible that there are some people here who have experience with using dot spatial, but I think you are more likely to get a better response on the forums on the dot spatial website. I am certainly not familiar with dot spatial myself.

I don't know how dot spatial integrates GDAL into their system, or what version they are using, but OSGeo4W uses GDAL 1.11.0. From what I understand, OSGeo4W tends to set environment variables when it starts programs (with the use of .bat files). So it is unlikely that the GDAL installed with OSGeo4W is interfering with the GDAL that is built into dot spatial. However that is just my understanding of it and one of the more expert people here will maybe want to correct me :)

Sorry I can't be of more help, but try the guys over at the dot spatial site. They will be able to provide further guidance I would imagine. 

James

You refer to the order of INSERTs?  Why does that matter?   The order in which
you get back the feature after INSERT later is undefined anyway.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Attribute Dialog inactive for new feature;
	regression from 2.2
Message-ID: <53BD084F.4050405@jena.de>

Hi all,

in a plugin I create a new feature for a vector layer (being in editing 
mode) and before adding it to the layer I want the user to input the 
attribute data. I use

accepted = iface.openFeatureForm(layer, newFeature)

However the OK button and all input widgets in the dialog are inactive.

The same happens if I add the feature to the layer before calling 
openFeatureForm; all is active if I call openFeatureForm with a feature 
already in the layer, though.

This is QGIS master on Linux 64 bit

The behaviour is a regression to QGIS 2.2 where all works as expected.

Is this the intended behaviour? If yes is there any work around suitable 
for QGIS 2.0+? If no, I will file a ticket.

all the best

Bernhard

Where i go wrong?

Please, test it and approve it, if you like.

You just need to find the index in parent's list of children:
node_idx = node.parent().children().index(node)

Message-ID: <53BD142E.30700@jena.de>

Hi,

I have a shapefile with a multiPolygon.
layer.wkbType() == QGis.WKBMultiPolygon returns False

having a multiPolygon-PostGIS layer
layer.wkbType() == QGis.WKBMultiPolygon returns True

Is this the expected behaviour or a bug?

If you confirm it is the expected beaviour (maybe shape cannot 
differentiate between polygon and multipolygon but only between 
point/line/polygon) can you tell me for which other dataProviders this 
is true?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Refresh SVG symbols drawn by a plugin
Message-ID: <53BD31DB.7080401@cerege.fr>

Hi,

I am making a plugin drawing focal mechanisms (a symbol indicating how 
move a fault when an earthquake occurs) and there is one last problem 
before the release that i can't solve.

Anyway, the plugin draws the SVG symbol using the attributes and save 
them in a folder, each SVG symbol have the name of the feature Id. Then, 
symbology is applied to the layer using :

symbol_layer = 
QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayerV2().create({'name_expression':'concat(\''+dirNameSymbol+'/\',\"'+self.ui.idField.currentText()+'\",\'.svg\')'})
layer.rendererV2().symbols()[0].changeSymbolLayer(0, symbol_layer)
iface.mapCanvas().refreshMap()

It works but only the first time. If i run the plugin a second time 
(i.e. to changed the color of the symbols), the new SVG symbol are well 
drawn in the folder, but don't displayed in the map canvas (the first 
are still displayed).

I understand it is probably because of cache memory (because if i close 
and re-open qgis or generate the new symbols in a different folder it 
works) but i'm not able to find the right way to refresh the view.

I have tried the following functions but no one make the job :

QgsMapRendererCache().clearCacheImage(layer.id())

or

if hasattr(layer, "setCacheImage"): layer.setCacheImage(None)
             layer.triggerRepaint()

or

layer.dataProvider().reloadData()
layer.triggerRepaint()

Thank you for your help.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python init script
Message-ID: <53BD4D0D.6010908@carto.net>

Hi,

I am trying to do a python init script that executes upon opening a form
(the standard-form, not a custom form).

The script should take a value of a feature, round the value (without
modifying the data) and display it in the form instead of the unrounded
value.

I can get access to the attribute data, but don't know how to access the
QLineEdit to change the value in the form.

Here is what I did so far:

---------------------------------------------------------------

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# Import the PyQt and QGIS librariesfrom qgis.core import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from qgis.core import *
from qgis.gui import *

def featureFormInit(dialog,layer,feature):
	area_rounded = round(feature.attribute("f_area"))
	feature.setAttribute("f_area",area_rounded)

---------------------------------------------------------------

The above code works fine so far and I checked by logging the rounded
value. How can I now get access to the correct widget and replace the
unrounded value with the rounded one?

Thanks for any hint,
Andreas

Message-ID: <DUB122-W15FB8EA3A2C862643BACA8A70F0@phx.gbl>




Hi all,
two trivial thoughts about the legend behaviour:
- I don't
 know if I'm the only one, but I think the new way to move layers with 
the "dragged image" is less comfortable and precise than the previous. I
 found easier (and hence faster) to manage files in 2.2 legend when 
appeared the line instead of having the actual image that covers the 
destination and doesn't allow to see in a proper way where the file will
 be put. Examples come mainly with: include/exclude a layer from a group
 or moving a layer up to a group if the group is already on top;
- 
other thing: is there a particular reason why, grouping some files, they
 automatically go to the bottom of the legend? could it be a good idea 
(and easy task) to group them where they are?

sorry for bothering and (as usual) thank you for the great work you do

Nic

Hi all,

there are reports in the bug tracker about two situations in qgis 2.4.
I would like to know if anyone else confirms:

* it seems that adding print layouts make loading of projects more and
more slow, this was not the case in 2.2

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10828#note-17

* qgis 2.4 seems that can become unstable if "renders layers in

is high

Hi,

I can confirm such stability issues - I had these crash issues mainly
directly after project load - without any user interaction whatsoever.
It is, however, hard to create reproducible test-cases. The crashes are
not always.

Regarding print composers: yes - there is a considerable slow-down in
project loading if a project contains a lot of print composers.

These are two issues we have to pay close attention to.

I am working on a python plugin that works with composer maps and I was
trying to use the moveContent method but was not able to understand the
results.  When I try moveContent(1,1) I was expecting the composer map
content to pan 1 unit to the right and 1 unit down but the content moved a
much larger distance.  What units does this method work with? I am working
with feet.

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg9u5G6OUVCQqWXKadg3NL_TGu8hq2iKnKbQ4PrMhf_xow@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

Just a thought today from some feedback from a user.  Could the deselect
and delete selected features have a change in icons.  Both these icons look
very a like and preform very different actions.


[image: Inline image 1]

http://i.imgur.com/BVPo9ce.png

On the attribute table it becomes even harder to tell.

[image: Inline image 2]

I would like to suggest some form of bin icon, or a red cross for delete.

Thoughts?

+1     for a waste bin icon

For example, something like this :

+1

I think red was thought to be for actions like delete, so I think 
keeping this color is ok.
IIRC Robert has put some thoughts into that.

How about removing saturation from the yellow selection rectangle? I 
think making it completely gray would be ok.

Hi Andreas,

I doubt you can access the QLineEdit (though I do not know for sure). 
Why don't you change the attribute data of the feature before opening 
the form (keeping the "real" value in memory and redoing the change if 
the user did not change the value in the form)?

Hi Bernhard,

I am able to change the attribute value in the feature record, but the 
attribute dialog does not update the value. Probably because "feature" 
is not live-linked but a copy of the record?

The other bad thing is that there is no way to address widgets by 
objectName. They don't seem to have object names in drag-and-drop mode 
or in the standard feature form mode. So no way to use 
dialog.findChild() or dialog findChildren(). Only if you use qtdesigner 
forms you can set the objectname.

I think that the widgets in the feature form should be addressable by 
objectName in the future. Will open a feature request.

works for me:
myFeature = myLayer.selectedFeatures()[0] # access the feature
myFeature[myLayer.fieldNameIndex("fieldxy")] = "blabla" # change value
if iface.openFeatureForm(myLayer, myFeature): # show dialog
   # change feature values for myFeature in myLayer

Hi Bernhard,

Ah I see. It is a different context. I am using a Python init script 
(the one you can specify in the layer properties dialog in the fields 
tab) that is triggered after the dialog already opened. The user is 
using the info tool and the feature form opens and the python init 
script is triggered.

In your example the context is different. Your script would open the 
featureForm.

But thanks anyway,
Andreas

Hi,

The dialog you get in the openForm method is a QgsAttributeForm.
As such it is possible to access the method changeAttribute( fieldName, 
value ).

However, this method - as well as the method you are currently using - 
do change the value of the field when you change something else and 
then save the form. And possibly even without changing something else.

Instead, I would use another approach if it's only for representation 
issues:
 * Use field type hidden and somehow insert another read-only field 
which shows the value you want to show.
 * Wait for the PR with the expression fields to be merged
 * Implement a custom widget that is able to discern between a rounded 
representation and an internal more precise value

Best,
Matthias

Hi Matthias,

I think the expression fields would definitely solve this problem.

Question:

Are the expression fields instead of the standard widget or in addition 
to the standard widgets? I would assume/hope the latter, as expression 
fields are not necessarily bound to a specific attribute but could be a 
combination of multiple attributes, geometry, logic, etc.

Ideally the records should be inserted in the order they have been digitized, to give
the most predictable and least surprising results for the user.
All the best.

That's outside the scope of QGIS as it is determined by the database 
system behind the provider.
The only option would be to be able to create a feature request to 
specify an order by column that could act the way you like in 
combination with an auto incremented value.

This could affect custom database triggers or implementations.

Here we use an auditing scheme to monitor perfomance of digitizing of our
users.

I agree with Paolo here, this gives a unpredicted result in some operations
that might exist.

Did anyone verify that the insertion order is different yet?  Paolo said that
it was.  I'm not sure it is.

But as said, as the return order is arbitrary later, I don't see a big impact
if it wasn't.

Jurgen, I agree with Paolo. It is sensitive for any other data workflow
which relies on this information.
Edited data is not only reused within QGIS (where it may get loaded in a
different order).

Thank you Denis,

That worked perfectly!

I think it would be good to add these convenience functions to core.
Should I open a ticket?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Attribute Form Editor
Message-ID: <1405020029521-5150550.post@n6.nabble.com>

In Qgis 2.2 I had a form with tabs.  In each tab I repeated the same
attribute at the top along with other attributes that did not repeat.  When
I updated the attribute which repeated on each tab the same attribute would
update on each tab.  In 2.4, when I update the repeating attribute on one
tab it does not repeat the update on other tabs and will not save the change
unless all repeating attributes have the same value.

Shall I file a bug report?

This is correct. You can get pretty good speedups by clustering your table
on the r-tree index. That reorders the entire table placing spatially
nearby objects nearby in the storage layer.

No one has specified a concrete example, so its pretty difficult to have
any idea what you need. Time stamp + a sorted view? (And top posting makes
this thread pretty hard to understand as well.)

Hi Boesiii,

Please file a bug. Before 2.2 it worked only for certain edit types and 
was quite a hack to have it working for these.
With the new widget system it should be easy to implement the same 
behavior for (almost?) all widget types.

Best,
Matthias

Hello everyone,

What do you thing about such solution?
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9604#note-15
Source files are here: http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/changeset/11569

For small icons (16x16px) used in several forms we should even simplify 
it and for [delete/delete selected] use just simple red cross.

regards,
Robert

GDALGetRasterDataType() in QGIS GDAL provider is giving GDT_Float64.
It is also strange that gdalinfo gives Float32 because the data values
have about 17 digits, i.e. double, reducing them to Float32 means loss
of precision.

Your sample has 560073 bytes, saved as TIFF from QGIS it has 242320
which makes sense, 17 bytes for each value reduced to 8 bytes per
pixel.

I don't see any problem in QGIS, you might ask in GDAL list why
gdalinfo reports Float32.

	Headers on Windows 8.1
Message-ID: <011f01cf9d0c$1a4f80a0$4eee81e0$@gmail.com>

Good Morning,

 

I tried painfully to get QGIS compiled last night, but I've had no such
luck. I'd like to try adding some features to the program in the future, but
I'd also like to be able to build my own C++ applications that have access
to the interface and can display basic map data.

 

I'm trying to follow the instructions on the INSTALL page
(http://htmlpreview.github.io/?http://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/I
NSTALL.html )

 

My current setup is this:

 

Windows 8.1

Visual Studio Express 2013

QGIS was standalone installed a month or so ago and is version 2.2.0

QT 5.3

CMake

Git (I'm using the main download at http://msysgit.github.io/ along with
TortoiseGit)

Flex

Bison

OSGeo4W Advanced Installation with all the required packages

I tried Installing the Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4, but
after an hour of installing it was no more than like 1% complete, so I
assume it was broken. Maybe I need the Windows SDK for Windows 8.1 and .NET
Framework 4.5.1?

 

Can you all help me get squared away? I was installing recent version of
software, but maybe I need the very specific versions that are mentioned
(Visual Studio Express 2010, QT 4.x, Windows 7)?

 

Just as some background with where I want to go with all of this; for one
I'm working on a small project in Visual Studio Express that allows me to
analyze the game Scotland Yard, for two I've been involved with Search and
Rescue for a little over a decade and we have some tools that are being
developed alongside ArcGIS that over an unknown period of time I'd like to
try to make available through freely available software.

 

Thanks!

Hey Joshua,

If your plan is to build a small application using QGIS I would recommend
using Python with PyQGIS.  It's very easy to get up and running with that
and your dev time will be much faster. Plus you don't have to compile it
for every platform under the sun ;)

If you are keen to try that I have a working Python PyQGIS app here:
https://github.com/DMS-Aus/Roam which include code to create a standalone
exe with everything included.  That is pretty full on example but I can
strip it down to the most important parts if needed.

Regards,
Nathan

QGIS doesn't support Qt 5.x yet.

If you want to use the dependencies from OSGeo4W, you'll have to use
the tools they were build with (especially the C++ dependencies like Qt; ie.
VC2008 on 32bit and VC2010 on 64bit).

If you build your own Qt using VC 2013 might also be an option.  But I'd
recommend to stick to INSTALL and use the dependencies from OSGeo4W.

Nathan,

 

I will take a look into the PyQGIS side of things. I?m much more comfortable in C++ than I am in Python, but I imagine I could probably make it work for me, as long as I?m not going the plugin route, I?ll be doing a lot of database type stuff and prefer my code to run in parallel with QGIS, rather than launching a plugin every time something needs done.

 

What?s required to get PyQGIS up and running on Windows 8.1? Is it just simply installing the standalone version of QGIS and Python (https://www.python.org/ )? Do I have access to all the QGIS files I need in this setup? Or do I need to pull the QGIS source code from Git?

 

Thanks!

 

Josh Q

J?rgen,

So if I'm understanding you correctly, I'll take the following actions:
	Uninstall VS2013 and replace it with VS2010 (since I'm running
Windows 8.1 and it's 64bit)
	Uninstall Qt 5.3 and replace it with Qt 4.x (assuming that the
specific subversion is negligible?) 	

Also, an unanswered part of this is do I need Windows SDK 7 with .NET 4? As
mentioned, the installation was completely hung up on my Windows 8.1
machine. I was thinking that the SDK and .NET were part of the Visual Studio
Express installation, but the INSTALL page seems to imply otherwise. Do I
instead need Windows 8.1 SDK with .NET 4.5 since I'm running Windows 8.1? Or
will the Visual Studio Express 2010 installation be sufficient? If I need
Windows SDK 7 with .NET 4 I may be in troble...

Thanks,

Josh Q

work with all the code changes that have been made. Could someone update
them so that they're actually doable?

I'm atleast at the point now where I can start trying to build code in
Visual Studio, which is a big improvement over where I was a few days ago.
Getting the cmake-gui setup was painful, I had to use a combination of
OSGeo4W64 directory, the QGIS repository, and the QGIS standalone install
directory to get to this point. Better instructions on how to setup all of
that on Windows would be great. I think the fact that I'm on a 64 bit system
and the of stuff needed is in both Program Files and Program Files (x86) is
breaking things. I'm also having to add a bunch of include directories to
the actual Visual Studio project settings; I thought CMake was responsible
for setting everything up?

Please help make this setup process more intuitive and update the code
examples so that they're actually usable.

Thanks,

Josh Q

Headers on Windows 8.1

J?rgen,

So if I'm understanding you correctly, I'll take the following actions:
	Uninstall VS2013 and replace it with VS2010 (since I'm running
Windows 8.1 and it's 64bit)
	Uninstall Qt 5.3 and replace it with Qt 4.x (assuming that the
specific subversion is negligible?) 	

Also, an unanswered part of this is do I need Windows SDK 7 with .NET 4? As
mentioned, the installation was completely hung up on my Windows 8.1
machine. I was thinking that the SDK and .NET were part of the Visual Studio
Express installation, but the INSTALL page seems to imply otherwise. Do I
instead need Windows 8.1 SDK with .NET 4.5 since I'm running Windows 8.1? Or
will the Visual Studio Express 2010 installation be sufficient? If I need
Windows SDK 7 with .NET 4 I may be in troble...

Thanks,

Josh Q

QGIS doesn't support Qt 5.x yet.

If you want to use the dependencies from OSGeo4W, you'll have to use the
tools they were build with (especially the C++ dependencies like Qt; ie.
VC2008 on 32bit and VC2010 on 64bit).

If you build your own Qt using VC 2013 might also be an option.  But I'd
recommend to stick to INSTALL and use the dependencies from OSGeo4W.

That's probably because that Qt plugin is not bundled into the app.  The QGIS Mac installation does not know about changes in Qt 5 file organization yet.  I don't have Qt 5, so I can't figure out those changes to update the source.

You could try configuring with QGIS_MACAPP_BUNDLE=0 so that it doesn't bundle Qt.  This makes the app less portable.

Is QGIS in general even ready for Qt 5?

Hi,

I have successfully built a qgis app.
You can find a summary in this post
http://3nids.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/build-and-deploy-c-qgis-app-on-windows/

I hope you can get a few leads from it.

Cheers,

Denis

Sure.  What particular part doesn't work anymore?   You could file tickets
gainst the documentation, even update doc/INSTALL.t2t (or doc/msvc.t2t)
yourself with you findings and do a pull request.

Sorry.  That no news there.  I already updated doc/msvc.t2t with that recently,
but I wasn't sure about it.  I can just tell you that that SDK works, I didn't
try more recent SDKs.

Not yet in master.

I was experimenting with Qt5 support recently and it is not too hard to 
port (i.e. to a codebase that compiles against Qt4 and Qt5)

If you want to give it a try:

Hi,

I'm having trouble locating the documentation of the network analysis
library in the API docs at:

http://qgis.org/api/2.4/group__networkanalysis.html

Instead, it was easy to google but I ended up on the following site:

http://fossies.org/dox/qgis-2.4.0/classQgsLineVectorLayerDirector.html

Are these classes covered in the qgis.org API docs? If yes, could you
point me there, please?

Best wishes,

Hi everyone,

I am sorry I could not submit the report of week 7 on time earlier. So this
is a combined report of both week 7 and week 8.



*Report of Week 7 and 8*

*What was done?*

   - Implemented the algorithm for the approach of putting angle
   constraints for lines as was discussed with the mentors earlier. The
   approach does what was expected and is giving desired results in most cases
   but still there are some parts where the change in angle is resulting in
   topological inaccuracies.


*What is the plan for next week?*

   - Discuss with the mentor the results of the current method and if the
   results are not satisfactory then will have to look at another approach.


*Am I blocked on anything?*

   - Need to sort out the approach and work on it ASAP. This is important
   as only then the next step of the project can be started.


*Wiki page : *http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/nishithm
*Code repository :* https://github.com/nishithm/schematization

Hi all.
Anyone willing to improve our map http://plugins.qgis.org/community-map/ and put it
on our main website? Currently a problem (CSRF verification failed. Request aborted.)
has been informally reported, and more generally we could use one or more of our
frontends (QGIS Web Client, LizMap) for this. It does not seem to involve much work.
Any taker? I can help if someone coordinates the work.
All the best.

Hi Otto,
thanks for raising this question. AFAIK this is not easily done, and it should.
In fact, also the reverse should be done: currently when applying a colour ramp to a
raster, this gets stretched from min-max, which is not always appropriate (e.g. DTM
ramps should be applied as absolute values.
In short, I think we should extend our model for ramps, allowing users to define both
absolute and relative ramps, both when creating and when applying them.
GRASS could be a good guide for this.
Better open tickets on this?
All the best.

Hi Paolo.

I have created a plug-in based on PySAL.
But do not be deployed becouse of PySAL deploy.
I also want to be included PySAL in QGIS.

Hi BJ,
thanks for this. Several other plugins require additional libs, so this should not
stop you from publishing it. Could you please upload you plugin to
http://plugins.qgis.org ? I'll be happy to give some help for publishing, if necessary.
However, the ideal solution IMHO would be to have it as a subplugin of Processing,
rather than as an independent plugin.
In principle there should not be any major problem in including pySAL in osgeo4w
(just someone has to do it).
Looking forward to cooperate on this.
All the best.

Anita has started adding pysal to processing, and I would like to help on
that if i can. BJ's plugin can help us also. If we add it to processing as
a core provider, the pysal lib should be added to the core QGIS, so BJ's
plugin could make use of it and do not have to install it separately

Hi Paolo,
I played around with PySAL yesterday and it seems possible to use it
at least in Processing scripts, e.g.
https://github.com/anitagraser/QGIS-Processing-tools/blob/master/2.2/scripts/local_morans.py
Best wishes,
Anita

Wow, great. Looking forward to see it in core.

Hi,

Thanks for the feedback.

I am not sure these can be easily added to core in their current form 
since they rely on a python library.

Cheers,

Denis

Anita,

scripts can be added now as core algorithms, and they will appear in the
"QGIS algorithms" group, not in the "scripts" one, so the user doesn't see
that they are scripts, but it's easier to create them

When you have your algorithms ready, if you think that this is a good way
of putting them into core, just drop your py files in the
processing/algs/qgis/scripts folder and they will be automatically added to
the toolbox.

Of course, Pysal should be added as well. To do it, you should put the
corresponding files in the python/ext-libs folder (assuming no one is
against adding that, but maybe we should ask...)

Cheers!

Hi all.
In several dialog (e.g. in experssions) there is a button to show only 10 values of a
field. I assumed this was a simple and quick way to inspect the kind of data present.
In current master, however, clicking on this for a large table freezes QGIS, so I
interpret this as an attempt to load all of a table.
Is this correct? In case, I think it should be changed.
Should I open a ticket?
All the best.

for large table it always took a lot (too much), if I'm not wrong it
shouldn't be new in master...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] UI Tab placement
Message-ID: <53C45A86.1050207@wildintellect.com>

I was tinkering around with various plugins that have dockable windows
today and realized when you snap 2 content areas into one it makes tabs.
Great, tabs work for switching between things and you don't lose a ton
of space. But then I realized the tabs are counter-intuitively at the
bottom. Not only is this odd in the context of top down UI, but it uses
double the space and the active tab is listed both at the top and the
bottom.

I've heard another common GIS software does tabs this way too, but it
seems at odds with everything else: browswers, email programs, inkscape.
You name it, tabs are at the top.

The extra space is really helpful too, QGIS Browser's biggest limitation
right now seems to be vertical space. You can drag and drop but not if
one folder is off screen. (A different ticket)

If others agree I can file a ticket for this. If it's controversial
could we make it an option to put the tab at the top instead of bottom?

Thanks,
Alex

PS: This is with 2.4, I believe it was the same way in 2.2 but I've only
recently started using a lot of docks (Browser, Processing, etc).

Hi Alex,

There is already a QMainWindow function for it [0]. Just need to add a user
option in Options to chose North/South/East/West or Top/Bottom/Left/Right.

Not sure, but the app may need to restarted after switching such an option.
Will test through PyQGIS console.

thanks. in this case, I do not see what is the usefulness of it.
IMHO it should perform a quick LIMIT 10 query.
should I open a ticket?
all the best.

Have you verified that is doesn't?  Because that's what it used to do.

Seems it calls uniqueValues so if that takes a long time it will block.
Depends on the provider I guess.

Of course.  LIMIT 10 probably is meant for the postgres provider - and that's
what it does already.  The spatialite provider does too.   The oracle provider
limits with "rownum" and mssql uses "top".  So unless there's something
preventing the provider's uniqueValues to kick in, it's already there.

Hey,

Yeah I'm thinking it might just be slow for something like shapefile where
is there no index on that column and it has to get each value to find
the unique
ones.  I'm not looking at the code, just guessing.

Thanks for your comments.
I found it rather slow for large PostGIS tables.
All the best.

As slow as

SELECT DISTINCT attribute FROM table ORDER BY attribute LIMIT 10

?

Hello All,


I noticed that  Ctrl-J  "zoom on selection"  does not work.

Some other can confirm this ?


Other question:  there is a way to move the the selection to the next
element, using a keystroke ?


Thank you for any info

I agree it would be good to have native support for tiled services.
What about extending WMS provider to support it? It has already
support for WMTS which I think is slightly more generic protocol...

Hello All,

I inserted a new plugin for QGis that moves the selection to next elements.

Please test it and approve it, if you like.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Some Questions about QGIS Server
Message-ID: <CAOQOUMtG=tF4d3H8bPku68PKbA1ycLNP1-rmiBW7sTwPpq=bLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I've been using QGIS Desktop for a 4 years now, and have recently started
exploring QGIS Server. I have used it for a couple of quick demos, but for
all my production needs I have always used GeoServer.
My background is in using ArcGIS, so the way QGIS Server works- where you
make a map in the desktop software & then publish that directly- feels more
natural than working with GeoServer, where you publish data separately and
style it separately.

Recently someone asked me to evaluate QGIS Server, and I have extensively
started using it and testing it out. I have a few questions about QGIS
Server:

1) Is there a Road-map for QGIS Server? Do you have an aim for this
project? Is it to become a Production ready Web mapping Server, or is it
for just testing?

2)Are there plans for a standalone setup for just the server part(For
Windows)? This is the user case: I have already installed Apache and QGIS
Desktop on my system. If I need QGIS server, I need to install a lot of
things using osGeo4w and then just copy the required things to my Apache.
(This procedure is documented here:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/86348/adding-qgis-server-to-an-existing-windows-web-server)
I know that I should probably log this as a feature request, but I thought
I'll ask before I do so.

3)I was making the WMS requests, and due to wrong/missing parameters, I was
getting HTTP 500 from the service. Are the cause of the errors logged
anywhere? I checked the Apache error logs, and they were not there.

4) The QGIS docs (
http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/ogc_server_support.html)
mentions a  ?Publish to Web? plugin. Where is this Plugin? I couldn't find
it in the plugins list.

	on Android
Message-ID: <20140715233917.3914f804abee24f0e84bcb17@gmail.com>

Hi QGIS developers,

I'm active QGIS user and bugreporter since 2010 and since 2013 I started to
use QGIS on Android Linux tablets.
QGIS is doing nice progress on Desktops, but no progress on tablets since
October 02, 2013 (see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Android/commits/master )
QGIS Android version is still 2.0, while desktop version is 2.4 :-/

I've found and reported lots of bugs in QGIS (Desktop and Android
versions), see for
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/android-qgis/issues
Some of these bugs can be resolved very simply - for example by changing
default font to "Droid Serif" QGIS will be usable for most European
countries (Czech, Lithuania, Latvia, and others). see
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10069
I can fix some of bugs, reported by me at
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/android-qgis/issues , but I don't have
write-access in QGIS Android repository (AFAIK
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Android/ )

Please give me write-access in QGIS Android repo if you don't have time to
fix QGIS for Android Linux bugs.

Thanks,
Giedrius

please fell free to clone the main repo and create pull requests, then
someone will take care to check your commits and merge them to the main

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Custom Map Tools
Message-ID: <CAHVp9XrVaCpXsBSibUJn8btGzfagppACdWBi4HYJ6Xn_AScv1A@mail.gmail.com>

I'm developing a custom application as a python plugin for doing in-person
map based interviews with indigenous people. For this I need custom map
tools for drawing and editing map features so I can do some additional
processing, when map features are created such as recording the time stamp
(as I'm recording sound simultaneously). At this point I've gotten the
capture of points and simultaneous audio working nicely but what I am
finding is after exiting my app (which runs in a panel with all other tool
bars and such minimized) and restoring the previous state, if I select any
other map tool, such as pan or in QGIS 2.4 under Linux, disk trashing
ensures followed by a crash.

I can simulate this by simply using command line in the python window using
the canvas.setMapTool function.

I suspect that somehow the custom map tool for placing points is not being
cleaned up properly but I'm not sure how to track this down or prevent
this. I've Googled this issue extensively and can't seem to find any
similar problems so any help pointing me in the right direction would be
welcome.

Thanks in advance

Hello All,


I noticed something unexpected in version 2.4 of QGis.

If I define a "map values??" (ie, a domain) on a field, associating a csv
file in the panel "Fields" of  "Properties", and saving the style of the layers
in a QML file, it does not contain the definition of the domain of the field
(as was the case in version 2.2),
and the reopening of the SHP file,  the domain has disappeared !

It is a bug ?

Confirmed here, also for values input by hand (no csv file).
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Martin

In Vienna you announced the idea to move some GUIs present in "app"
part of qgis code to qgis.gui to gain accessibility with PyQGIS
without using QgsInterface wrapper

It's still in your plans, it's something already financed?

I was just looking how to reuse QgsFieldProperties widget

Message-ID: <49D53E66756E9E4D9310D19261A79ADB2FD4DCB2@HOLYSTONE.nnpa.com>

In a plugin, we currently loop through all layers in qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().layers. We determine whether a layer is eg WFS by using QgsVectorLayer.providerType(). However, if OpenLayers plugin layers are present, this fails:

AttributeError: 'OpenlayersLayer' object has no attribute 'providerType'

How should I broaden out the detection of type of layer to determine whether it is such an OpenLayers layer? I will also then probably want to determine which OpenLayers layer it is (eg OSM, Google, etc), but for the moment, that can wait.

Is there documentation of the OpenLayers plugin suitable for working with it in plugin development? An API?

Use QgsMapLayer.type() method - it will return one of three values:
- QgsMapLayer.VectorLayer
- QgsMapLayer.RasterLayer
- QgsMapLayer.PluginLayer

OpenLayers is plugin layer (providers are used just in vector and
raster layers). Type of the plugin layer can be detected from
pluginLayerType() method - it will return identifier of that plugin
layer as used in QgsPluginLayerRegistry.

I must have been referring to the legend refactoring which introduced
new classes (QgsLayerTree*) to core and gui library in 2.4 release.
Now you do not need QgsLegendInterface anymore to deal with the layer
tree.


> I was just looking how to reuse QgsFieldProperties widget

I have currently no plans to move more widgets to GUI library.

Hello all,

please add someone a hint at the INSTALL Guide 
(http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html#toc14) 
for building QGIS with VS that while Installing Bison no shortcut to start 
menu had to be created. In my case this was the reason of the error: 
Generating qgsexpressionparser.cpp
C:\GnuWin32\bin\bison.exe: m4: No such file or directory

This could beware of loosing much nerves for the next...

I don't understand the references to the shortcut.  The error means you didn't
have C:\GnuWin32\bin in PATH and therefore bison was unable to find m4.

The batch file from which you should start all other things does that (s.
"4.1.3. Setting up the Visual Studio project with CMake").

This should be fixed now in master.

Problems with CSV files should be fixed too, but there are likely some
problems also in projects without CSV files. Any hints helping to
replicate the problems would be appreciated...

This could be probably changed... but there is also advantage in the
new approach: you always know which layers/groups you move - in 2.2
and earlier the layers that were being moved simply disappeared while
being rendered.

Makes sense - implemented in master, c05e5e.

I did some more playing with this and found that if I clear layer
selections before and after my plugin with the custom map tools is run the
system does not crash. I had looked at the crash output when running qgis
from command line and found an error suggesting symbols not found so I
suspect that somehow when I removed my active layers when I close the
plugin that QGIS tried to access those layers when I selected a zoom tool
(for example). Doesn't really make sense, but it seems I've found a work
around for now.

Again if anyone has insight into this any explanation would be welcome.

Thanks

Hello,

I followed the instructions of the script and have created such a 
batchfile. First I've installed bison to a path with spaces inbetween. 
Thatswhy I put the path with the ~ in %PATH% and in CMAKE. Sometimes 
everything going good but in some cases this error occured. So first I 
deinstalled Bison and installed it to a path without spaces but created a 
shortcut to startmenu. Also I changed the path-variable in batch but it 
doesn't worked. Then I found this link (
http://www.chriscalender.com/?p=798 ) and this solved my problem. 
But maybe its really incorrect. I'm not sure with the PATH-variable in 
Win7. There is one for system and one for user and both aren't doing what 
I want. So maybe path was not correctly set.

Greetings
Susann

I don't understand the references to the shortcut.  The error means you 
didn't
have C:\GnuWin32\bin in PATH and therefore bison was unable to find m4.

The batch file from which you should start all other things does that (s.
"4.1.3. Setting up the Visual Studio project with CMake").

so, maybe could be a good compromise to keep the actual render but a little more shifted out of the layer list, in order to show better the "destination line"? a sort of mix of the two approaches.

Dear All

Hope you all will be fine.

I am adding some customized features in QGIS. I have already set qgis
source using qtcreator in ubuntu and adding features using c++.

I have one python project I have to integrate it with qgis and run one
python script from qgis menu/toolbar. *How to run python script from custom

Hello,

Sorry for boring you,
but my problem still isn't solved. 

I have a batch-script like in the INSTALL-Guide named setupvcproject. 
Before calling it the path is knowing my bison-directory 
(C:\GnuWin32\bin), afterwards it is gone away and i get the following 
compiling error
> Generating qgsexpressionparser.cpp

Hi,

A workaround can be to explicitly set the path for Bison in Visual Studio
2008 under *Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > VC++
Directories >* *Executable
files*. See this link for more info:

Sorry for the OT, but it's related with GIS development and cartography

EN *****************************************

Hello
We write from @montenoso communication team.
http://www.montenoso.net/

Our project has the aim to visualize and dynamize the Common Lands
Communities of Galicia (Spain).Their extension is almost a third part of
the total surface of Galicia, 640.000 ha, managed by almost 3000 rural
communities. These communities are being loomed by the interests of
corporations and by the public administration. 

It is urgent endow of a digital identity to these communities that
represent a centenary alternative 
to the public and private types of property. Thus we are developing a
web platform that includes a 
a cartography as a visualisation way as you can see here
<http://montenoso.net/cartografia_nova/>.

We met CartoDB members at Geocampes14 in A Coru?a (Spain). Some of the
assistants encouraged us to use it for our project. As they said we've
moved the cartography of our project to this platform. We would like to
achieve a sponsor account because our project is based on collaborative and 
voluntary work and at the moment we do not have the resources to face a
paid account.

The project works around the "mancom?n" concept with other communities
like the p2p, free 
culture and social movements. Montenoso project is transparent and open
as you can see at the 
site <http://montenoso.net/en-aberto/>.
We want to ask you like a member of the GFLOSS / FOSS community, that
add you to this request
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1H5h6sk4PC7j64aewO9ODHlbY2dtyl5avznFaQeTDHx4/viewform>, 
to certify and guarantee that the project has interest and social basis.

Credits: 
At this time we have achieved backrest of numerous communal land
communities of Galicia, also 
of the Medialab Prado, Intermediae, Matadero Madrid, MARCO museum. The
project has been 
awarded with "10x10 P?blica" prize of Fundaci?n Contempor?nea and A
Coru?a City Council. Also 
the project was a finalist of the Docs21Festival of digital narratives.
Recently Montenoso has 
achieved an honour mention in Prix Ars Electronica at Digital Communities. 
We attach a file with more information about the project.

We really appreciate your collaboration.

alternativa milenaria a la propiedad publico/privada. Por ello estamos
desarrollando una plataforma
web que incluye una cartograf?a como uno de los modos de visualizaci?n.

Conocimos CartoDB en Geocampes14, varios de los asistentes nos animaron
a usarlo.
Desde entonces hemos trasladado la cartograf?a de nuestro proyecto a
esta plataforma. Nos
gustar?a conseguir una cuenta sponsorizada, ya que nuestro proyecto se
basa en el trabajo
colaborativo y de momento no contamos con recursos para afrontar una
cuenta de pago.
El proyecto interacciona a su vez desde el "mancom?n" con otras
comunidades como el p2p, la
cultura libre y movimientos sociales. Podeis ver los avances aqu?
<http://montenoso.net/cartografia_nova/>

Todo el proyecto montenoso es transparente, abierto
<http://montenoso.net/en-aberto/> y colaborativo.
Queremos pedirte como miembro de la comunidad GFLOSS / FOSS, que te
sumes a esta petici?n
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1H5h6sk4PC7j64aewO9ODHlbY2dtyl5avznFaQeTDHx4/viewform>,
para certificar y garantizar que el proyecto tiene inter?s y base social. 

Cr?ditos: 
En este tiempo hemos conseguido respaldos de numerosas Comunidades de
montes de Galicia,
del Medialab Prado, Intermediae, Matadero Madrid el museo de arte
contempor?nea MARCO,
que avalan la viabilidad del proyecto y colaboran en su difusi?n. El
proyecto recibi? un premio a la
innovaci?n y emprendizaje cultural del Ayuntamiento. Fue finalista del
Festival Docs21 de
narrativas digitales y recientemente hemos conseguido una menci?n de
honor en el Prix Ars
Electr?nica, el certamen de arte digital m?s importante del mundo. 
Adjuntamos un archivo con la informaci?n suficiente del proyecto.

Recibid un cordial saludo!

IT *****************************************

Salve,

Ti scriviamo dal gruppo di comunicazione di @montenoso
www.montenoso.net <http://www.montenoso.net>

Il nostro progetto ha per scopo la visualizzazione e dinamizzazione
delle comunit? di gestione degli
Usi Civici della Galizia (Nord ovest della Spagna) La loro estensione ?
circa un terzo della superficie
della Galizia, 650.000 ettari, gestiti da quasi 3000 comunit? rurali.
Queste comunit? sono minacciate
da interessi corporativi e dalla stessa amministrazione pubblica.

? urgente dotare di identit? digitale queste comunit? che rappresentano
da millenni una alternativa
alla propriet? pubblico/privata. Per questo stiamo sviluppando una
piattaforma web che includa una
cartografia come una delle forme di visualizzazione di questa identit?,
link <http://montenoso.net/cartografia_nova/>.

Abbiamo conosciuto CartoDB durante il Geocampes14 (http://geocamp.es/),
alcuni dei partecipanti
ci animarono ad usarlo. Da allora abbiamo caricato la cartografia del
nostro progetto su questa
piattaforma. Ci piacerebbe ottenere un account sponsorizzato visto che
il nostro progetto si basa su
lavoro collaborativo e volontario al momento non abbiamo risorse per
affrontare un account a
pagamento. Il progetto che gira intorno ai concetti di "beni comuni"
interagisce con altre comunit?
come quella del p2p, della cultura libera e dei movimenti sociali. Tutto
il progetto "montenoso" ?
trasparente e aperto <http://montenoso.net/en-aberto/>.

Vogliamo chiederti, come membro della comunit? GFLOSS/FOSS che ti
aggiunga a questa petizione
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1H5h6sk4PC7j64aewO9ODHlbY2dtyl5avznFaQeTDHx4/viewform>,

per certificare che il progetto ha interesse e base sociale.

Crediti:
Durante questo periodo abbiamo avuto l'appoggio di numerose comunit?
montane della Galizia
come anche dal Medialab Prado, Intermediae, Matadero Madrid e dal museo
di arte
contemporanea MACRO. Queste realt? che garantiscono la fattibilit? del
progetto e collaborano alla
sua diffusione. Il progetto ha ricevuto il premio "10x10 P?blica" della
fondazione Contempor?nea
del municipio di A Coru?a, Inoltre ? stato finalista al Docs21Festival
di narrativa digitale.
Recentemente Montenoso ha ottenuto la menzione d'onore al Prix Ars
Electronica, il premio di arte
digitale pi? importante al mondo. Alleghiamo un file con maggiori
informazioni riguardo il progetto 

Ci piacerebbe avere anche il tuo aiuto. 

cordiali saluti

Montenoso team

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FiqQmSgAy_D-Wf3Qjy6SyfzmpRMQHWYGdEhjk1PGuvtEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
The network analysis lib allows shortest path routing as documented in
the PyQGIS Cookbook and the API docs:
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsEdgeProperter.html
This page also lists a src/plugins/roadgraph/speedproperter.h which -
I assume - would enable fastest path routing. Is this class exposed to
Python?
Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

Sorry guys but this one has taken a bit too long to resolve:

iface.pluginManagerInterface().pluginMetadata(u"name")

returns None

iface.pluginManagerInterface().pluginMetadata(u"general.name")

returns None

The fall back is of course something like this:

        self.metadata = ConfigParser()
        self.metadata.read(os.path.join(self.plugin_dir,'metadata.txt'))

But then that's cheating a bit ....

Message-ID: <53CC00AB.6050907@northrivergeographic.com>

Sorry if this is cross posting (to a degree - I just filed a bug report 
also).

This occurs on Ubuntugis-unstable and osgeo4w 64bit.

I've run into a problem using clip under geoprocessing: I'm clipping a 
large contour dataset by a polygon. At 34% ubuntu throws an error and at 
35% windows throws an error. I went back and double checked 
projection/data/etc. Both windows and Ubuntu seem to create the same 
log. Here is the Ubuntu-unstable one:

hmmm, that was fixed in here

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/9733ae8e50f0e0f40bbf32931e5670ff39d3e6fd

See how the line that your error trace mentions, it is not the same now.
The fix is from two months ago...so I guess you have an outdated version,
or maybe the latest one but somehow shadowed by an older installation of
Processing?

Hi Giovanni,
Would it be possible to add the speed properter? Or does it make more
sense to write new properters in python if that's possible?
Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

Great. The installed 2.2 covered up 2.4 ...
Also the installer says that the plugin repo only contains 2.2.
Wouldn't it be better to upload 2.4 to the repo so users get the info
that there's a new version.
Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Ren?-Luc, would You please provide some current information to Your

Thanks a lot.

I haven't tried but you should be able to define your properter on Python
side, given that QgsArcProperter is exposed to it.

For a speed properter example you could take a look to the one implemented
within the road graph plugin:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/plugins/roadgraph/speedproperter.cpp

Hi Giedrius,

Nice that there is interest and support for the Android version.

I have recently updated QGIS for Android to version 2.4. There is an
updated set of scripts and an updated source code branch available for
this [1][2]. They may change (and be merged back into the main repo) in
the future.

If you want to give it a try without building yourself first, there is
also an .apk available [3]

As Giuseppe said, the easiest way to help the QGIS-Android project is to
fork the repository and to create pull requests with fixes/improvements.

Kind regards,
Matthias

Matthias, that's great news!
Are you going to add the installer to Play Store? I think this would greatly speed up
user adoption and feedback.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I think Marco has plans to do that but I am not sure about the priority
of things. He'll be back to reading mails in August.
The aim of this project was to get QGIS on Android more stable and some
tuning of the UI for touch interfaces (still a lot to do here!).
But yes, I agree that this would be great.

Best,
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Print composer&Openlayers issue
Message-ID: <1405930397230-5152043.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi All, 

I also shared this one in user group but no one answered, it's an urgent
issue for me. Sorry for repetition.

I am using QGIS 2.4.0 on Win7 - 64 bit with 4gb ram and intel i5 2.4ghz
processor. I save my maps consisting of openlayers - google hybrid and some
shape files into pdf and bmp files. 

As a result I get some tiles of google images are missing or partially faded
or sometimes shifted. Please refer to the attached images below. 

I am not sure if this is a plugin or composer issue. The images are ok in
the map view and in the print composer preview screen, I must add. 

Is this a known issue or a bug, anything to solve? 

Thanks, 
Necip.

Right top corner is faded (Not faded in map screen or print composer
preview)

Hi Matthias,

I'm curious - how close are we to fully functioning desktop builds of
2.4 with qt5? Is there many hurdles that you foresee?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rendering context in rules
Message-ID: <53CCE669.4070709@carto.net>

Hi,

I wonder if we could introduce a "rendering context" for usage in
symbology and labeling with expressions. This would be similar to the
CSS media queries where you could have different styling for printing
and on-screen display.

A render context could be:

* Main map canvas
* regular printing
* atlas printing
* WMS server

Usage scenario:

you want to have different rules or different symbology and labels
depending on the rendering context. E.g. you want to use a different
styling for atlas serial printing than for the general display in the
main map canvas.

With such a rendering context we could have rules like follows:

CASE WHEN rendering_context = 'atlas serial printing' THEN ....
WHEN rendering_context = 'main map canvas' THEN ....
END CASE

Is such a "rendering context" feasible to implement/introduce?

On could go even further and also introduce the screen width/height in a
rule and have different symbology for small screens compared to large
screens ...

Thank you for your thoughts on this very rough proposal.

Andreas

Hi Nyall,

The things that currently need some work (and I don't think it will be 
that much) are:

 * You cannot build with ENABLE_TESTS. I did not look into this.
 * I could not test the python bindings due to missing dependencies 
(pyqt for qt5 will only be available in Fedora 21)
 * The evis plugin's http code needs to be ported to 
QNetworkAccessManager (currently #ifdef'd out)

I expect a few more issues to surface when more people start testing 
it, but all in all it runs as stable as with Qt4 here with the 
abovementioned restrictions.

Best,
Matthias

I think you also needed to build without pyqwt (unless it is now
ported to qt5).

Hi Matthias,
the apk downloads and installs fine, without installing the Qt5 for Android (I had a
previous qgis 2.0 install however): is that ok? On the other hand, the .run download
does not run as such: I imagine it has to be run through a shell, right?
All the best, and thanks.

The Ministro app will take care of dependencies (Qt5) and update when

QGIS will ask you to install ministro if it's not yet on the system. In
your case with a previous installation the update to Qt5 should be
handled without any manual steps from your side.

That link was just for development and you don't need to download this
file if all you want is to install the prebuilt apk.

Hi All,

I had the following error when I try to calculate points to lines.

This algorithm requires GRASS to be run. A test to check if GRASS is

What does it say in the Processing log? Could you send it so we can check

Just a quick question to make sure I have understood this correctly. 

The github repository you linked to Matthias, that is a version of QGIS using qt5?

I have problems with display resolution (3200 x 1800) on my new work laptop (it's not just QGIS, there are other problems that look at rubbish also). The QGIS interface doesn't look so great. I have read that qt5 handles these things much better.

Is there anywhere I can get a windows installer for this from? If not I will attempt to build QGIS myself (haven't done it before).

If it is going to be qt5 for desktop QGIS then I am very keen to test - it's the main downside of my new machine.

    Sorry if this is cross posting (to a degree - I just filed a bug
    report also). 

    

    This occurs on Ubuntugis-unstable and osgeo4w 64bit. 

    

    I've run into a problem using clip under geoprocessing: I'm clipping
    a large contour dataset by a polygon. At 34% ubuntu throws an error
    and at 35% windows throws an error. I went back and double checked
    projection/data/etc. Both windows and Ubuntu seem to create the same
    log. Here is the Ubuntu-unstable one:

Are you referring to Qt5 in general or would it need QML support?
Anyway, I'll be very happy to hear what you find out.

I don't expect anybody has made one. You will most likely also need to
compile other dependencies for windows in order to make it work (qwt,
qwtpolar, pyqt maybe others?) because the versions in osgeo4w are all
compiled against qt4.

I hope you have some success, I am sure you are not the only one.

Hi List,
Further to this, has a new build of QGIS been created/released that has
this issue resolved? I note the version number is now 2.4.0.1.

Thanks,
Jonathan

Hi,

This is not a mail about bugs or issues on a special feature ? just a matter of time.

Right now I?m preparing a 3 week intensive GIS course at university level - looking forward to these annual events. But I get stressed when I see that there are only 94 days until next version of QGIS. Because in November I start over again with a 8 week course and in February a 3 week course, in may a 3 week course. All in all we have more than 140 students learning QGIS every year ? and they are impressed of this program!!!



I love getting new features in the program, but fear the work to run through every assignment, every video and being a bit unsure how the program works in the latest version on the different platforms.

Small changes which I haven?t noticed and therefore unaware of. So a new version so soon gives me a lot of stress and so many hours of work ?  hours which could be used to ex. testing.



When I ask users to download the program they take the official latest version ? sometimes with bugs included? It gives an impression of an unprofessional product (not my words), it gives me- and others hard times to fix or explain. I?ve been talking to other users/administrators who has the same experience.

[cid:image001.jpg at 01CFA50A.343BBD20]

What if we had :

?        A long term stable version for ex. 12 months with bugfix only

?        A developer version for 4 months with new features and bugfixes => Stable version with short bugfix-period => New developer??..



I do know it will give the developers more work ? I do know it will cost more money ? But I?m sure a lot of administrators will recommend,  use and support if we get a more stable environment.

So please ? consider another release plan in the future.

I am not a contributing developer, so my feelings are just that: "mine" 
- and perhaps not that of the QGIS-DEV community, but:

    What if you created a resource for downloading from, and told your
    students that that is the only version that they be allowed to
    download use for your course?

Yes, this way may still not assist you with bugs you find after the 
start of your course and perhaps end of support for that particular 
version, but I think part of the appeal of QGIS is that bug fixes and 
features "arrive all the time" - and this way you have the possibility 
of begging for priority of an issue that particularly affects you.

You may be lucky, and there is definite merit in a planned release 
sequence rather like Ubuntu Linux, but maybe it is a question of regular 
funding.

I'd be interested in the responses form the QGIS community, but perhaps 
we should choose a list and not cross-post every response.
(I have not cross posted this to qgis-user)

Regards,
Zoltan

Hi Kari,
Yes we do support - bugfixing/testing, make blog with help/tutorials, co-translating into Danish language and next in May 2015 we host the hackfest for the developers.
We also try to convince others to do the same :)

Hi Lene,

Does Your proposal mean that those universities, which start to use QGIS and QGIS based material for education, start to support QGIS development financially and with other resources like man power for testing, fixing etc. ?

Cheers,
Kari

&#61623                    A long term stable version for ex. 12 months with bugfix only

&#61623                    A developer version for 4 months with new features and bugfixes => Stable version with short bugfix-period => New developer........



I do know it will give the developers more work - I do know it will cost more money - But I?m sure a lot of administrators will recommend,  use and support if we get a more stable environment.

So please - consider another release plan in the future.

How many administrator are currently pushing to sponsor msi packages for

Hi Matthias,

Thanks for the link. I installed a try. Everything is great just do not understand why does not connect to the GPS? Old version (2.0) could find the GPS automatically and connect.

Thanks,
Giedrius

Hi Jean,



My idea is to have a stable version 3 times a year AND a long term stable for 12 months.

In this way we have a compromise.

Hi to all,

moving to qgis 2.4 I noticed a strange behaviour: if I define a python init
function for a form in "Layer properties -> Field menu" every time that I
insert a new feature this is inserted twice. Anyone can confirm this
behaviour ? It's a new bug of the 2.4 ?
If I use qgis 2.0 all works fine.

Thank in advance

Installing python-gdal solved the issue for me.

One could check if the building guide
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html#toc6
should be updated, i.e. python-gdal is added to the build dependencies.
I use Linux Mint so I don't know if it's exactly the same with Ubuntu.

Best wishes
Daniel

Message-ID: <53CE08A5.7030400@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just noticed something quite strange with the composer.
When changing focus from whatever application to a composer in QGIS, 
pressing the delete keys still occurs in the previous application.
It is quite a problem, when the last app was the file browser since it 
just delete a file at each key press....

I am under ubuntu 14.04.

Someone confirms???

Cheers,

Denis

Thanks Matthias,

I search in the bug tracker some days ago and I didn't find this bug.
I'm too slow to send my issues, or others Qgis users are too fast !

It's a bug in unity, ubuntu's (poorly designed) window manager, and their
messy "global menu" implementation. Nothing we can do about it
unfortunately...

Hi,

I would prefere another solution instead of changing the releases. The
documentation team is in the same situation. We are always behind the
releases, but the problem I see is that there are not enough people working
on the documents. At the moment we were not even able to start updating the
manual for 2.4 yet :(. 

From my experience, we get many new features for every release because
developers work together on the master source.

For some reason trainers prefere starting from scratch working on her/his
own documents and training material, which is ok, of course but leads into
the situation Lene discribed.

Here are two ideas that come to my mind:

a) Trainers could combine their forces and prepair general training materials
together that everybody can use and extend. All tools and the document basis
is available and provided by QGIS project in the documentation repository. I
know there are many people conducting trainings on QGIS, if they all work
together as developers already do, we would probably be in a much better
situation.

b) An idea that already works for the development of QGIS features is paying
some amount or percantage of each development for good documentation and
training material. Many new features in QGIS are payed by customers. But
usually customers and developers don't think about also spending an
additional little amount to document the feature in the QGIS docs and
training material. I don't know why, but that's reality.

So for me, the problem is not just about changing the releases cycles. It is
more about bringing documenters and trainers closer to the project again to
combine their forces. And to make customers/users/developers aware, that
documentation and training material is an important part of the software and
should not be forgotten and maybe automatically added to an offer, if new
(payed) features are added.

Otto

Hello all,

Same happened to me some minutes ago. A second run of make just make it 
compile (I dindn't do nothing, don't ask :) ). I'm on Kubuntu 14.04.

Anyway, I get an error (posted yesterday) when running the compiled source:


Couldn't load PyQGIS.
Python support will be disabled.


Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "", line 1, in
   File 
"/home/antares/dev/QGIS/build/output/python/qgis/gui/__init__.py", line 
1, in
     from qgis._gui import *
ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (init_gui)


Python version:
2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 23:03:41)
[GCC 4.8.2]

QGIS version:
2.5.0-Master 'Master', 8f0b898

Don't have any clue about that. I've found and issue in the hub:

https://hub.qgis.org/issues/10218

But it doesn't say much about how to solve (just fixed problem)

Maybe it is matter of a ticket?

Best regards

+1 with Otto, many many trainers do still almost all material from scratch,
we loose a lot of good contributors, and we loose money also (as a funder).

We started courses last year and pushed the will to have teachers contribute
to bugtracking and contribute to open source version of the docs. 
This is a change for most trainers that live and gain contracts with their
own material (pdf, slides...). Collaborative open source philosophy has not
yet touched most of them!

Our first attempt of contribution was to translate in French the QGIS
tutorial. Now that we have transifex on, that sounds al lot more feasable
for non dev's trainers. Anyway, we had to change a lot the manual and
training course because our internal use cas is very specific.  

So, for generic courses, this seems reasonable as a funder to add a small
amount of money for modification and translation of QGIS courses. Still,
that requires english speakers, time, and a compatible schedule for QGIS doc
builds.. For more specific courses, I'm more in favor of a catalog hosting
them in qgis.org, with a mandatory open source licence, so that they could
be freely reused.

I also think that our Governement has its own training services, and could
push their materials in QGIS doc infrastructure? That need some thinking for
sure, maybe not pushing english as default langage for some use cases, which
could allow reuse and translation only for those who need it.. 

Ideas on how to have trainers contribute and share, from all langages, for
all kind of courses ?

Hi Otto,
You make some excellent points. Just to follow on one of them:

But usually customers and developers don't think about also spending
an additional
> little amount to document the feature in the QGIS docs and training
> material.


I think that's a QGIS problem. I know when I get quotes for GeoServer
stuff, or for our JavaScript library we use, the quote includes time spent
updating the documentation.

The solution is very simple: Require up to date, accurate documentation for
all commits of new features. This is one for the PSC.
After all, what's the point in having tons of features if no-one knows how
to use them or what they do?
Will it slow down new feature feature commit? Probably, but I figure that's
a small price to pay for actually having documentation. And from that
documentation, universal training materials can be developed much more
easily.

Cheers,
Jonathan

+1 to what Otto said. Very good point. Those creating training materials
should coordinate and help the core QGIS documentation (both the manual and
the training manual) improve.

-1 from me. Features are also  documented by people using them, not just by
the devs. We like to say that you can contribute to open source projects
not just by coding, but if we do that, I don't think we are going to get
many contributions from users, leaving the documentation to be written only
by developers.

I try to keep the Processing documentation up to date, but only documenting
the interface itself and the framework, not the algorithms. That's the
reason why a large part of algorithms in Processing are not documented.
Fortunately, some users have contributed documentation, and they have added
descriptions of several algorithms, but the have done that *after* using
the (hitherto undocumented) algorithm and becoming familiar with it. No one
is going to document something that he cannot use yet.

Let's encourage developers to commit features when they are well
documented, but let's also give some flexibility, since that's not always
going to be possible.

my 2 cents

Cheers
V?ctor

+ 1 to Otto and Victor.

Developers should develop, the can document some aspects of
code/feature (and they
already do this!) but we can not ask them to write manuals

Not much news there.  This comes up again and again.

We already tried to maintain two branches in the past and failed.  I'm not sure
if we still would, but I don't see any big changes that makes it less likely
either.

And that's why we have the tight release schedule now - it's there to both get
bugfixes out and new features in in a reasonable time frame and with minimum
extra or duplicate effort (which backports and packing are - not a awful lot,
but some).

Fixes and features are released every four months - including a four weeks
window for testing and fixing.  Which is of course not as good as LTS, but it's
apparently feasible and working.

Except that self-evidently the current solution doesn't work well. Of the
three projects I listed, QGIS has by far the worst documentation; as Otto
noted, they've not even started updating for 2.4 yet.

Just looking now, not a single one of the "QGIS Geoalgorithms" that I've
ever looked at (which are I think is what Victor is referencing) have
anything in the "help" tab. And these are a core part of the software.

I appreciate developers hate writing documentation, and in fact they're
often very bad at it anyway, but if other projects can do it with far fewer
resources then I think QGIS should be able to manage it to, especially the
commercial organisations that charge for feature development.

Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi J?rgen,

> window for testing and fixing.  Which is of course not as good as LTS, but
> it's apparently feasible and working.


But is it working? I believe the point of an LTS is that each version is
more stable than the last and that there are no new features which in turn
means no new bugs should be introduced. Everyone wants QGIS to be stable of
course, but adding new features by definition isn't going to be compatible
with that - New features introduce new bugs irrespective of the amount of
testing there is. It's far less common (but by no means unknown) for a
bugfix to introduce a new bug.

I don't know the story of why having two branches failed in the past, but
the fact that this topic is raised every couple of months by new people
should indicate that there's a strong desire for it within the community,
so maybe it's worth investigating again.
What caused it to fail last time? Is there anything the community can learn
from that? Can QGIS learn from any of the other Open Source communities
that successfully maintain multiple branches? What resources are needed to
make it happen?

Cheers,
Jonathan

Yes that's what I mean. But, IMHO, it's better to have that functionality
there with an empty help tab, than not having it. People are using it,
that's a fact. For some of them, it might be hard due to the lack of
documentation. For some others, it might not be so hard, and eventually
someone might contribute a help file.

If those algorithms have to wait until the dev (me in that case) writes the
corresponding doc before being able to add them, I can tell you that, most
likely, they will never ever be added. And, since the functionality is not
be there to be tested, no one else will volunteer to do it.

I am not saying that this is ideal, and that developers should not write
docs. I am saying that time is limited and, if we put those restrictions,
we might end up rejecting a lot of interesting functionality.

The question is simple: maintaining a stable branch costs (developr time|money).
If someone will put the ncessary resources, I'm pretty sure nobody will object.
All the best.

Fair point, but then I'd ask - what would the cost be? Is it not something
that can be covered by the current sponsorship given that a significant (or
maybe just significantly vocal ;-) ) portion of the community seems to be
interested in it? I've tried finding the financials for QGIS but failed;
are they online publically available?

And this also goes back to the other questions I asked - how do other Open
Source projects do it? I know GeoServer has no central pot and a much
smaller community yet maintains multiple branches (at least 3!).
Just throwing money at a problem won't necessarily resolve it in the most
efficient way possible. Knowing where it went wrong last time and how other
projects do it seems like a logical starting place.

Just my 2p,

Best Regards,
Jonathan

Sorry for jumping in late. These are some of my thoughts:

* of course we all love stability; the solution is to pay developers to fix bugs -
nothing more, nothing less
* all the same, we all love a complete and thorough documentation; see the above (and
very good Otto comments), plus the fact that everybody can contribute to improve it
(no need to be a developer, all the contrary in fact: newbies are often the best
documenters)
* cooperating on documentation writing, as Otto and R?gis suggested, is certainly the
best way to go; it's a pity seeing tons of tutorials, rewritten over and over, and
never contributed back
* documentation effort for processing modules has started, and it has been announced;
if anyone is interested, it is easy to contribute, either with time or money; please
refrain from complaining if you do not
* we (Faunalia) also do hundreds of courses; IMHO it is the duty of the trainer to
keep up to date - this is what makes courses interesting after all; IMHO, doing a
course on an old version is not doing a good service, neither to trainees nor to the
sw; I think explaining "see, we're doing the course on the latest and greatest
version - this comes with some less tested features; be patient, bugs will be fixed,
probably soon, possibly paid by others" is good enough
* we are working on free software, not on a cracked proprietary *GIS version; IMHO is
is a duty of the trainer to explain the difference to trainees, and show them how to
open a ticket, and how to contribute for its solution; I do this since 2006, and many
of my trainees are now contributors.

All the best.

simple answer: not. we would need more sponsors and donors for that.

> I've

the normal way is approaching one of the core developers and asking for a quote; the
issue here is that I'm sure the burden could be shared among several organizations,
but engineering the financial mechanism for this would be tricky.

their funding and development model is quite different, not easy to compare the two
projects.

right; IMHO the most simple yet correct way is to hire someone to do the backports
and the release of the bugfix versions. not a trivial task though - it is quite easy
to introduce new bugs while fixing old ones, so no guarantee that blind backporting
actually improves the quality of the package.

thanks for your interest.
all the best.

same problem here.

qscimod4.sip is not available on my machine and I don't know which
ubuntu package would contain this file.

I am able to compile without that error if I make again after the first 
make. Don't know if it helps but, providing it's a strange behaviour of 
building tools for me, I guess I should tell it.

That's a debian bug (https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=755491)
The sip files are not currently packaged.

As a workaround I included them in QGIS [8f0b8987 & 7e815cad] - but only the
latest version (in debian) - which could have worked for older ones as well, if
Qscintillas API was stable enough.

Apparently it isn't.  The nightly builds failed with precise already - saucy
and trust worked however, but that's as far as it got as of now.  I'll check
what else I can do, once I now which other distributions are affected.

Message-ID: <1406032879158-5152456.post@n6.nabble.com>

When using a point shapefile I can get the point of geometry of a selected
feature. When using a point layer from a Spatialite DB I can not?

Shapefile:
>>> lyr = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayersByName('point_shape')[0]
>>> selection = lyr.selectedFeatures()
>>> selection[0].geometry().asPoint()
(535265,6.25118e+06)

Spatialite:
>>> lyr =
>>> QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayersByName('point_spatialite')[0]
>>> selection = lyr.selectedFeatures()
>>> selection[0].geometry().asPoint()
(0,0)

Why the (0,0) when point layer is from a Spatialite DB? Using OSGEO4W QGIS
2.4.

Thanks,
Jakob

Sorry, did the test in QGIS 2.2. The issue is not shapefile vs. spatialite,
but QGIS 2.2 API vs. 2.4.
There must be a change in API in QGIS 2.4 returning (0,0) using
selection[0].geometry().asPoint() on an arbitrary data source.

Hi Otto,

AFAIK, PyQtSQL is a part of PyQt package, so it should be included
in OSGeo4W/standalone

Somehow my table was a multipoint table, converting it to a point table fixed
the problem. Sorry for the noice.

Open source is not just open code. Contribution can be done in
documentation and Help. Trainers should have a huge responsibility here.
(Remember, no free lunches)

Do we have people working on hunting and squashing Bugs and Feature
Requests from Documentation and Help?

https://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=81

Is it a common practice for developer to fill feature requests for
Documentation and help whenever they create new features? This would still
free developers to keep creating good stuff, and help others to keep track
of what needs attention in Docs. Using the visual changelog and scrolling
the commits messages might not be reliable enough.

Hey Jurgen,

We can disable the sip parts for the code editors for now if it is causing
issues.  They are really only light wrappers around some QScintilla code.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Loading PostGIS Raster data via "Add PostGIS
	Layer" menu option
Message-ID: <CAMhtMNOVFiemt9uPjBFAqBYHBUpgiS__Gj0KMqvx8bG2T-wAsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm a developer of GDAL PostGIS Raster driver, and I'd like to know if it
would be possible to modify the "Add PostGIS Layer" menu option to allow
adding PostGIS Raster data, in addition to the PostGIS data.

Opening the QgsPostgresProvider class definition [1], I see it inherits
from QgsVectorDataProvider. I guess I could make the class also inherit
from QgsRasterDataProvider, like GDAL does [2], but as I don't have any
previous experience developing for QGIS core, I'm probably underestimating
the difficulty (besides, I would also need GUI changes...).

I do have experience developing in C/C++, and developing for GDAL and
PostGIS libraries. So, do you think this could be an affordable task,
without changing a lot of existent code? I'd like this task to be my
"August project"

Many thanks in advance.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <53CE8097.3000909@gmail.com>

The release cycles has been discussed on the developers list before 
without a clear resolution.

First of all, I agree with Lene regarding  the state of QGIS. There 
should be a "LTS" version of QGIS as bug free as possible with new 
features added only on a yearly basis. The current situation makes it 
very difficult to create up-to-date documentation, tutorials for 
university courses and mass roll-outs of QGIS in organisations.//And it 
becomes difficult to thoroughly test a given version.

Furthermore: Every new release contains - of course - new features and 
bug fixes. But with the addition of new features you always get some new 
bugs;  both in the new features but occasionally in some _existing, 
previously functioning_ part of QGIS. This makes QGIS look like a piece 
of shoddy work.

A LTS version of QGIS would solve a large part of these problems

On the other hand I do understand the regular, non-paid volunteer 
developers ain't that keen to support a LTS version without some 
monetary compensation.  And that can be hard to obtain :-/

I would suggest an alternative:

The current release cycle look roughly like this:

 1. Development phase, 3 months of adding new features and bug fixes to
    QGIS in a developer version of QGIS
 2. Feature freeze, 1 month cleaning and polishing the developer
    version, i.e. bug fixing the new features and removing old bugs.
    Updating of translations.
 3. Release of the developer version as the new stable version of QGIS
    and start of a new developer version of QGIS
 4. 1 month of reporting and bug fixing the new stable release and a
    probably a second minor release of the new version

Using the above cycle gives us 3 new "stable" versions each year because 
point (1) and (4) overlaps.

My suggestion is that*one* of the three version cycles is replaced with 
the following:

 1. Development phase, *1* month of adding new features and bug fixes to
    QGIS in a developer version of QGIS
 2. Bug fixing only feature freeze, *3* months cleaning and polishing
    the developer version, i.e. bug fixing the new features and removing
    old bugs with *special care* taken for finding and removing bugs
    introduced in the last two cycles. Updating of translations.
 3. Release of the developer version as the new stable version of QGIS
    and start of a new developer version of QGIS
 4. *1* month of reporting and bugfixing the new stable release and a
    with a *guaranteed* second minor release of the new version.

This version could be used a "LTS"-ish version of QGIS for one year at a 
time. The result of this development cycle will probably:

  * Have a very small amount of errors introduced in existing features
    by adding new features to QGIS. (No shoddy parts in QGIS :-)
  * It would be possible to introduce new features on a *minor* scale in
    this development cycle
  * Have a large time window for bug fixing.
  * Let documenters, teachers and to some extend testers use this
    version of QGIS for one year at a time.
  * No extra work with having two versions of QGIS to support at the
    same time.

+1 for Bo Victor's idea which seems a good compromise to avoid that painful
LTS version.

What about having no fixed duration for the bug fixing phase for that "
LTS"-ish" version, but releasing it only when there's no blocker left in
the tracker ? (I'd find it strange to publish such a version with serious
known bugs).

It's true that this may stuck QGIS's development for some time, but what's
better than a stuck situation to convince sponsors that they have to give
out some money, and to convince devs they have to focus on bug fixing ?

Best regards,

Olivier

I don't know how much effort could require to change that dialog to list PG
raster tables as well, but you may add a new option "Add PostGIS Raster
Layer" with a new dialog.

You should develop a new provider which extends the QgsRasterDataProvider,
as the current one is for vectors only.

It shouldn't be hard too much, but I'm quite sure you must create new
classes and not just change the existent ones.
Anyway, I hope someone who worked on raster stuff can give you any hints,
maybe it's easier than we can tell :)

You can check the http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/x86(_64)/setup.ini.
The standalone install includes qgis-full and all it dependencies.

apps/Python27/lib/site-packages/PyQt4/QtSql.pyd is in the pyqt4 and
odbc is built as an internal sql driver in OSGeo4W.

Paolo -

Your answer is not rude, but it's not quite correct. My "master plan" 
would simply shift 2 months every year from development of new features 
to bug-fixing. This alone won't cost any extra resources.  It would 
simply give a large time window for bug-fixing/testing/documenting on a 
yearly basis.

As it is now there is _no_ version of QGIS that's relatively free of 
aggravating bugs (ex. bugs introduced in existing, formerly working 
parts of QGIS) . This makes QGIS a "hard sell" in precisely the 
organisations that might support/donate to QGIS development. This is my 
actual experience when I - as a GIS consultant - tries to get someone to 
use QGIS on a large scale as a replacement for either ArcGIS or 
MapInfo.  They don't want new fancy features  3 times a year - they want 
a yearly stable, relatively bug free version where it possible to add 
new features if needed.

It a chicken/egg problem. We need to have some stable, relatively bug 
free version of QGIS with predictable (and somewhat slow ) release 
cycles before it's acceptable in large organisations (with money to 
spend on development/bug fixing). "My" release cycle would give a chance 
to remedy some of the problems without extra costs and still give 
developers a chance to add new features on a continuing basis.

Wow, I could be so off the mark with this, as I am not even aware if 
there is a regular donor for QGIS, or just ad-hoc income - but perhaps 
me coming from the outside, might give you fresh ideas to mull over.

So,

The guys who have been long term dev contributors to QGIS (effort, not 
money) should surely have some idea what effort it might take maintain 
an LTS version.
Perhaps they could agree that for the 1st LTS version, one or two of 
them would take on the responsibility for maintaining that LTS version 
(yes, they might need the guidance of the people who wrote the part of 
code "that blew up").
For the next LTS version, this responsibility could move to other devs, 
and so the burden of LTS maintenance could rotate amongst suitably 
qualified and willing devs.
Then, given that QGIS is a mature project that is widely used, is there 
not some organisation that would be willing to fund the LTS maintainers 
on a monthly retention basis? (a retainer, rather than a "fee per fix" 
will offer small but regular income for the dev.)
Canonical?
Would OSGEO have some contacts?
Maybe set up a special corner of the QGIS Web page where you could show 
the Company logo of anyone prepared to sponsor a particular LTS cycle? 
(This last thought would mean that QGIS would have to fund-raise for 
each LTS cycle - not great :-(  )

If you coincided the LTS versions with (say) Ubuntu, that would also be 
useful for stability, but that could mean that the LTS maintenance Devs 
would have to deal with backports so that QGIS does not become too old 
before the next LTS cycle.

Note also that most new features come with plugins, so as long as a new 
plugin is also certified against the prevailing LTS version, QGIS users 
won't have to suffer with a (too much) out of date QGIS.

Anyway, I hope my thoughts will stimulate ideas on how to handle this, 
but in short perhaps decide in this order:

 1. How long between LTS cycles (maybe pick 2 or 3 scenarios)
 2. How many devs need to be available for ad-hoc bug-fixes for a
    particular LTS cycle
 3. How these (willing) devs could be cycled over different LTS periods
    so they don't get bored and stuck with maintaining old code.
 4. What effort (read money) would they want _as a retainer_ (rather
    than "fee per fix")
 5. How to get the money for the retainers

Regards,
Zoltan

We had that in 1.7 even without new feature - backported fixes introduced new
bugs.

Currently we do three months of development, 1 months of testing and fixing,
then we releases and start the next development phase.  There is no set plan
for backporting and/or point/bugfix releases.

So just two phases - but yes, three releases a year.

One month is too short.

That means 5 months in total - that's also a problem, because the 4 month
period is scheduled to avoid holidays.  5 months would make sure that they
eventually get in the way.

That means one more releases a year (2x development, 2x bugfix releases instead
of 3) and one month of parallel work on two branches.  Well the latter might
mean that the parallel month doesn't count and we still have three periods a
year - but that would then mean three more releases a year.

Right, that's one of the options we have.

With practice backporting care would improve over time :)

I think "no set plan" is a good plan.

But could some policies be defined ?
Like:

 - There shall be a branch available for every Maj.Min release:
   the "stable branch" for that release.

 - Only bugfix commits containing automated testcase shall be accepted
   in any "stable branch". [ this point should be expanded ]

 - Patch-level releases _might_ be cut at any time following
   one week of silence after last backport commit.

Having a policy like the above poses no burden on the developers but
constraints the work of any contributor that wants to push toward
more stable releases.

I think this is true, though I dont have experience with large
organizations.  As a user i would love to have a more stable LTS
version and if i could i would earmark my donations specifically for
supporting an LTS and, i think, would contribute more.  But since it
doesnt exist, i cant help fund it with my small donations.  Also, that
is something that i might be able to get my work to donate small
amounts for, though as a small  grant-funded non-profit costs that are
not directly billable to grants are very hard to pay for.

In reading this thread I realised I don't know how communication
between developers and documenters works in QGIS, but it seems to me
that the previously mentioned idea of tying documentation and
development together doesn't necessarily mean that developers would be
required to write the documentation. (Obviously someone would but I
don't see why that would have to be the dev.)  I had the same thought
as Alexandre about filing documentation request to have a doc team
work on it?  This may require QGIS to prioritize documentation
differently than it currently does and that may not be the direction
people want to go, but from what others have said it sounds like there
might be some reason to shift current practice.

Also, I was just looking at the QGIS homepage and found it quite
difficult to figure out how to contribute to documentation.  Am I
missing something? I was expecting that contributing documentation
would be one of the subheadings under "Get Involved". I instead found
it under "Translate > Translate QGIS into your language" -- and then
had to scroll down and find the documentation section, which hasn't
been written, and click over to gtihub, which in turn includes no
information on how to actually contribute.  After some searching I was
able to find the "Manual Writing" page in the wiki. It seems like a
link to the wiki page would be useful  on the "Get Involved" page
somewhere as well as some information on how to contribute to other
documentation like help files.

Just to stretch my point -

  * I'm not argumenting for a "regular" LTS version in parallel with a
    development version including back-porting and patching to several
    versions of QGIS. I have developed software for 30 years; I know the
    efforts and pains of parallel versions :-/
  * I'm trying to make a case for taking every *third* development cycle
    and *minimizing* the addition of new features in this cycle and
    *maximizing *the bug fixing/testing/documentation effort.
  * Have a "clean-up" period for around one  month after the "bug-fix"
    version release. In this period every new bug fix should be added to
    both the "bug-fix" release and the new developer release (OK, some
    parallel patching to 2 QGIS versions).
  * After the clean-up period there would be a mandatory point release
    of the "bug-fix" release. And after that: No further work on this
    "bug-fix" version.

We can discuss the details and length of the different periods. But the 
main points is for every third development cycle: A minimum of new 
features and a maximum effort in 
bug-fixing/testing/translation/tutorials/documentation, i.e: all the 
"secondary" efforts in making good and stable software. With the current 
cycle periods there would be one "bug-fix" version every year. This 
period coincide - in my experience - with the minimum accepted time 
periods between software version updates in most large organisations.

Right this is what I have proposed in the past (e.g.
https://www.mail-archive.com/qgis-developer at lists.osgeo.org/msg22449.html).
I think that keeping our current release cadence and just attaching
special criteria (e.g. only one month of feature commits, 3 months bug
fixing and feature freeze) to intermittent releases is the simplest
way to provide a yearly 'stable' version of QGIS without needing to
change developer behaviour or require any more resources.

We have been working on getting one paid developer day for
stabilisation and release work pre month for the next 9 months via the
InaSAFE project. If others could club together and do the same, I
believe it could make a huge impact on the stability of QGIS with
rather small investment by individual organisations. There are many
god developers on our team that are available for such work and life
will be much easier for them if they can put aside some time to work
on stabilisation without needing to worry about how to keep their
lights on.

Juergen has already tabled an approach for doing bugfix releases after
backports/bugfixes have been made to the current release branch (and
no bugfix release if no backports / bugfixes have been made). He can
explain better the concept, but it really needs also some impetus from
those sponsoring developers to do work to also request that the
bugfixes they sponsor get backported.

I would like to mention that although it may not seem like it
sometimes (mostly because of the fact that we have had this discussion
so many times and any particular approach we take someone always has a
big issue with), the QGIS team *are* very interested in getting a high
quality and stable release into play, we just need to balance that
with the fact that a) developers are largely undirected by the central
project and focus on things they or their clients are interested in
and b) we have extremely limited resources and much of the core
project work is undertaken on a voluntary basis by a handful of team
members. So any suggested route has to take into the account that you
are asking already overstretched volunteers to take on more work,
possibly diluting their efforts further on other areas of the project.

So yes throwing money at the problem does not necessarily solve all
problems, but it certainly will help us actually manage the parts of
the project where volunteer time is limited and we can contract devs
in to do important work on a paid basis. If other organisations and
QGIS user groups could help to get just two or three devs to have a
week of each month funded to stabilise QGIS the community at large
would realise huge benefits as would those funding that work.

Tim

I?ve now been using-, bug reporting- and making tutorials for QGIS since 1.7 and I still find it difficult to make stable contributions in several ways: In this tread everyone write ?more money? or ?Work together?

I want to donate time ? but find it difficult to find a limited project. As everyone else I have a time consuming job, but find it both exiting and needed to be a part of this ?movement?
What if we under Support on the front page make it easy to support in several ways:

-We make a matrix for testing for users. Having a set of standard data. A platform (windows/linux/MAC) and then a list of functions to test. I?m sure we are several users who would gladly take a job like this if it is limited and organized ? because we can see the job being done and developers taking over. In one of my courses I introduced this to my students ? they also found it brilliant to be able to participate.

- We make an addition to tutorials: Case based tutorials, where we can write a small summary/intro ? incl. platform and version. Upload data and tutorial in our own form.( I don?t have time to re-write into a standard format)

- We make more exposure about the donation page. It is set on the front page ? Good ? but also mention it for our students, users of all kind - to donate. Micro donations  in the students beer-hut will be my next battle ?

I love being a part of  QGIS!!!

Agreed fully: once we devise a way to make it easy, people respond quite positively.
E.g. the new "donate while downloading" stuff is attracting an unprecedented number
of small donations.
Please help setting this up.

We all do, isn't it? ;)

Thanks for your suggestions.

Hi,
I like to add my opinion just to remeber that QGIS is using many other compoent.
One as example for many : gdal or geos.
But I coud speak equally of spatialite, saga, and so on.

You question are all right.
But speak always of qgis as a unique molotithic software.This is not true.

sometime the problem is not on qgis software , but in other way (gdal,
geos, spatialite, and so on...)

so what happened when the bug is related to geos ?
of to gdal ?

The bug fixer of qgis could only say.

This is not my question.

But for the user that fund the bg fix the problem is a qgis problem.
It has not fund the resolution on gdal or on geos.

So before to fund is necessary to know where is the problem really.
Otherwise the fund is lost.

Or bad-est solution the bug fixer try to copy the code inside the qgis
to bug fixe that copy.

So the bugfix of a software like qgis is absolutely not easy.

develope new feature is surely ore easy rather than fix them.

And the not monolithic approach of qgis is not help the bug fix question.

Regards,

Andrea.

earmarking donations would put a significant additional strain on our time (remember,
nobody pays for the infrastructure, including financial aspects, so it's all
voluntary work). we believe PSC has a sufficient understanding of the project to
allocate our (very limited!) resources in the best interests of QGIS.
in fact, we are asking donors: "trust us, your donations will be handled for the good
of the project", and frankly I believe we've been quite effective on this until now.
having said that, I would like to find a simple way of implementing "preferential
donations" (you vote with your money).

We can issue receipts for significant donations (no, please don't ask a bill for a 5
? donation :) ).

All the best, and thanks.

Hi Simon,

this sounds like a very good idea to me.

At the moment documenters look at the commit logs for a "[FEATURE]" comment
and add it to a wiki list. Then search through all mls, wikis and blogs, if
there is some howto available or at a least a short discussion or
description about that feature. If not we have to ask for help - all this
takes time...

If we have a simple skeleton about the feature automatically provided by
developers, we would be happy and it would be much easier to write a better
documentation.

Regards,
Otto

Just for the record, I have opened a similar bug report in ubuntu:

Indeed it seems to be quite fragile. When I used SIP files from 2.8.3
together with binaries from 2.8.1, it compiled fine, but crashed QGIS
during initialization. Only using SIP files from exactly the same
version worked.

We could make a script to just pull out everything with [FEATURE] in the
commit between a date range if that will help.  Maybe we could create stubs
in Tims changelog system using something like this.

Hi Nathan,

thanks for the offer, but this is not the problem. After feature freeze we
currently do a git log --since=<date> --grep='FEATURE'", that's ok. And Tims
changelog is also very helpful and often already fine as a beginning.

The result is in the wiki: http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/ManualTasks

But this covers not all changes we need to document nor does it usually
describe the usage. We still we have to search the web, so it would be great
to have a simple skeleton with a short description of all functionality of a
feature from the developers, if that is possible. 

Maybe we can offer 2 ways. If developers write about features in their blog
and describe how it works, as you do, you could just add the link
somewhere where documenters can look it up. For others a simple
documentation skeleton could be used as a standard.

Whatever we finally use, it would be good to improve the current procedure.

Regards
Otto

I think stubs from github to the visual changelog would be great.

Also, it would be great if the visual changelog could some day be hosted
under a qgis.org address. The visual changelog is very useful and I
always point users to it after a new version was released. It looks a
bit strange if the address is not on the qgis.org domain.

Here's first post introducing the new API - more will follow...

Later I will try to update also the cookbook.

Hi all,
I'm working with the master version and I discovered the new awesome
feature of multiple grids in the print composer! Really amazing!

I'm also facing a problem: I'm not able to draw the zebra frame
anymore. I select it from the drop-down menu but nothing appears in
the map canvas.

Should I open a ticket?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] attribute table row cache
Message-ID: <20140723123419.56b51c9a@nature.speedport.ip>

Hi,

the option "Attribute table row cache" under "settings - options - data
sources" makes it possible to save the last loaded N attribute rows so that
working with the attribute table will be quicker. The cache will be deleted
when closing the attribute table.

What is the maximum number of lines here and what happens, if I set it to
0 - would that cache all line or no lines? I would like to load the complete
attribute table from an external database into the cache. Is that option
possible?

Thanks
Otto

Hi Otto,

Currently you will need to set a number large enough to hold all your 
records.

It would be a very simple fix to switch to the (quite sensible) 
operation mode you describe (0: cache all).

Would it be possible for you to test a pull request/branch if I create 
one?

Matthias

Hi,

at least in nightly 2.5 win x64 (latest) QGIS Browser crashes when;
- layer selected, looked metadata etc
- some directory selected

Hmm, also openSuse linux 2.4 latest does the same.
Following messages on terminal:

I didn't have much luck with generated Xcode project files way back before I overhauled the cmake configuration.  You're better off making it by hand (I did that for a while, but it was a pain to maintain).  Or just use the build instructions and do it all in the Terminal.

Cmake has probably improved its xcode generator, but QGIS is a complex project and I still wouldn't trust cmake to get it right.

Hi,

If you are feeling adventurous, you can try a new methodology for setting
up a development environment on Mac [0]. It utilizes the Homebrew package
manager, and requires no manual compiling, and many pre-compiled binaries
(if everything goes smoothly).

Please post any issues to the tap's tracker [1].

Hi all,

seems expression filtering of features does not works when used from Python.
Here is my test code for Python console:

layer = iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
expr = '"dt" = \'2014-07-05\' AND abs("y" - 3.0) <= 0.000001'
request = QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterExpression(expr)
for f in layer.getFeatures(request):
  print 'found'

This code find no matches in attached shapefile when executed from Python
console, but when I try to use same expression in "Select by Expression" tool it
selects one feature.

Maybe I miss something? Should I open a ticket?

Hi,

J?rgen or Nathan - can you please disable the sip parts for now, as
discussed - as currently I can't compile master on Ubuntu.

Maybe we can re-introduce it once the Debian/Ubuntu issues around
qscintilla and sip are resolved.

This would be much appreciated!

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Alexander,

This seems to be related to the copy constructor of QgsExpression not
working properly. Please file a bug for this.

It's a quite complex topic, because the original expression string
cannot just be used because of dynamically created expressions. On the
other hand the dynamic method fails for certain types (longlong I think).

And personally I think that QgsExpressions could be implicitly shared,
but I've heard other opinions on this topic.

Cheers,
Matthias

For some reason a project temp file or a backup file using the extension 
.qgs~ is showing up in my projects directory with QGIS 2.4 Win 7 64 bit. 
The "xcopy *.qgs" command I use for archival purposes is catching the 
.qgs~ file as well. This behavior is different from every QGIS version 
up to at least 2.18 that I have used, for at least the last 5 years. Why 
has this changed? Could it be put back like it was? Does anybody have a 
workaround? Is there a switch somewhere to put the temp file in another 
subdirectory (I did a casual search for this but couldn't find one)?

It's not a temp file. It's backup of version of the project file (or better put
the renamed original).

We are still at 2.4 and the backup file was introduced in November 2013.

What's the problem with having a second backup copy?

Every day I increment the Julian date on the project file I work on. So 
MyIncredibleProject.qgs file becomes, for example today's Julian 
calendar date, 203MyIncredibleProject.qgs. Tomorrow the first thing I do 
will be to increment the file to 204MyIncredibleProject.qgs and so on.

Each day I archive the previous day's file to DVD. On January 1st, 2015 
I will start a new DVD and file the 2014 data away.

Such an elaborate backup scheme became necessary in my case due to the 
complexity of my project which involves dozens of layers of varying data 
types and the regular trashing of the project file by QGIS.

An option to do away with the automatic backup file would be nice. I'll 
take it from there.

I'm a big boy, I can tie my own shoelaces.

I am very happy with 2.4.

If this was me I would store you project file in a git repo and just commit
every day, or after every change, and backup the git repo.  I have done
this in the past and it has served me well.  Just adding dates to the end
of a file is a very old school way of doing backups.

In any case I don't think adding an option for it is a smart idea.  It is
there for a reason I'm sure you can work around it from your script end.

Make sure you look at the exclue: arg for xcopy you should be able to add
*,qgs~ to it so it will ignore those.

What is the purpose of this file?
When is it produced and does QGIS revert to this copy under certain
circumstances?

Speaking for Juergen, I believe it is written with the previous saved
state of the project file each time you press save. So if you save and
the project file gets corrupted (its happened to me a few times in the
past) you can fallback to the last known good state.

In this case wouldn't it be better to write to a temp file when saving 
(.qgs~) and after successfully having written this file rename it to 
the real name (.qgs)?
This way there would be no garbage and a user does not need to know 
about cryptic file renames.

Having a backup when the project file got silently corrupted or truncated and
can't be loaded again.  Which does/used to happen sometimes for unknown
reasons.

Everytime the project file is saved.

No.

Hi everyone,



*Weekly Report 9*

*What was done this week?*

   - I discussed with my mentors the way to go about handling the
   inaccuracies/errors in the approach.

   - This is being done by adding a checking mechanism in the code so that
   specific type of inaccuracies which were encountered will be handled.


*What is the plan for next week?*

   - Will try to complete the implementation of this checking mechanism in
   the coming week.


*Wiki page : *http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/nishithm
*Code repository :* https://github.com/nishithm/schematization

Hi Paolo,

there is a some pieces of information in CookBook [0], but it
does not contains code samples. I will try to add them today.

All necessary methods one can find in QgisInterface class [1],
just search for "addPlugin*" and "removePlugin*". There are:
 - addPluginToMenu
 - addPluginToDatabaseMenu
 - addPluginToRasterMenu
 - addPluginToVectorMenu
 - addPluginToWebMenu
and corresponding remove* methods. Same with adding/removing
toolbar buttons.

Hope this helps

I think Tim was editing the Plugin Builder a little while ago.

We discussed adding an option in the plugin builder dialog to specify which menu and toolbar the plugin would be added to.

This would obviously help quite a lot with new plugins. Obviously still important to have this documented in the cookbook.

Same here, clean rebuild does not help.
Removing the Qsci part in FindQScintilla.cmake fixes things.

Same here. I had to manually define 
-DQSCINTILLA_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/qt4
instead of /usr/include/qt4/Qsci

Odd, as it did here.  And the nightly builds[1] apparently didn't have a
problem with 9a10b79 either.

Thanks for the answer. I checked again. Starting from scratch in  a new
build dir it cmake's correctly.

Manually deleting QSCINTILLA_INCLUDE_DIR from the cmake cache (e.g. in
ccmake) fixes things as well, while a simple 'make clean' was not enough.

Message-ID: <53D20A59.2070204@carto.net>

Hi all,

I wonder who of the QGIS users have an interest in improving the print
composer and introducing a new reporting mode (similar to Microsoft
Access or Jasper reports).

Such a reporting mode would have header/footer/main section and a notion
of page flow/page breaks. It would properly integrate with atlas
printing, expressions and dynamic item properties.

We are already working on improving various features with Nyall Dawson
and we are looking for additional organizations that can help funding
these efforts.

We have some very concrete work items (with quotes) for development work
in QGIS 2.5/2.6 and will start working on the reporting mode in QGIS
2.7/2.8.

If you are interested in improving serial printing and the new reporting
mode please join the discussion or contact me offlist (e.g. for
financial issues, quotes, etc.)

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi,

has anyone had problems with qgis web client and the search panel in
the left side? With any value, the qgis FCGI module returns always an
empty result.

Maybe I must configure the qgis project to allow searches?

Message-ID: <53D259F7.4040801@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I found a small annoyance:

* open a new composer
* add a map
* set property to Render (not Cache)
* change symbology on the canvas
* the map is not updated
* it gets updated when clicking on the button Update.

So apparently there is no difference between Cache and Render (i.e. Render is
useless): is this confirmed? Should I open a ticket?

Thanks.

Hi Paolo,

There is a difference between "cache" and "render":

If you zoom in / navigate in the print composer layout and your mode is
"render" the map will be re-rendered at higher resolution while in
"cache" mode the map stays pixelated. It also means that the "render"
mode will get slower the more you zoom in in your layout whereas the
"cache" mode stays fast.

As to your issue:

For me personally there is no need to sync the main canvas and the print
composer after updates in the main map canvas. At print time the map is
re-rendered anyway. So really a very, very minor annoyance. There are
much more annoying issues in QGIS in my opinion. Just my opinion.

Andreas

Hi Paolo,

seems this is result of the huge refactoring of inputs and outputs.
Now all inputs are in processing.core.parameters and all outputs in
processing.core.outputs packages.

So fixing this is trivial task, just adjust import clauses

Yes, that's what I understood. Will this syntax stay? If so, I can open relevant
tickets, possibly PRs, on the involved plugins.
Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] list of qgis python plugin with editing part?
Message-ID: <1406305781777-5153339.post@n6.nabble.com>

Dear all,

Is it possible to know the name of main qgis python extensions having part
of their python code dedicated to editing vector data? 

I need it to inspire me in order to code our own plugin.

In advance, thank you for your reply. 

Regards.

Yes, it is supposed to stay. The refactoring was made to have a more
consistent structure, so we should keep it like that.

Let me know if you need help with that, although, as Alex say, it shouldn't
be too difficult to adapt

Confirmed here on Mac, for the OS X 10.6 nightly. I just trashed the
CMakeCache.txt file and then the build worked fine, after reinitializing
the cache.

We need to be careful because now processing is core it is really part of
the API and we really shouldnt be breaking that. As such I think you should
just redirect the module so old code still works.

You can just do something like this in __init__.py for processing

Import processing.core.output

Output = processing.core.output

So when you import processing and call output it really calls the new
submodule.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QTableWidget in custom ui feature form?!
Message-ID: <53D36B7B.90303@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello everyone,

I would like to use a QTableWidget in my custom made feature form (ui file)
However, in qt designer I can't set the object names of the table's cell
widgets, and thus they are not recognized as feature input.
I tried to set the appropriate object names in my python init function,
however, at that point it is already too late.

Has anyone ever done something like this, or could it be feasible to
change the behavior of when the feature attributes are connected to the
form (as in after the python init function)?

regards,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,

What are you trying to accomplish exactly?

If it's just the attributes for a single feature, would the use of a 
layout (grid layout/form layout) be good enough instead of using a 
table?
If you want to show attributes of more than one feature, would a 
relation be what you want?

 Maybe you can upload a screenshot or your .ui somewhere.

The table cells themselves are not widgets.

What you could also consider is writing your own .ui form widgets [1]. 
Currently they are bound to a single field (this may change in the 
future), so you would probably need to cheat a bit to accomplish what 
you want.

Regards,
Matthias

I see, then you probably don't want to use it :-)

I don't think QTableWidgetItem is a subclass of QWidget. It's just
easier to use when the table is just used in simple scenarios. And even
if it was a QWidget, it would need QGIS to support this particular
subclass of QWidget, which would need to be implemented first (but that
in turn could be done the way that is outlined in the blogpost linked in
the last email).

You should be able to implement such a table yourself along with a new
custom form element, and then promoting the table in QtDesigner. That
will require some work and knowledge.

I wouldn't expect it. It's not QtDesigner, it's a
QTableView/QTableWidget issue.

I'm sure that's easier and better suited.

Recently two topics were discussed on this list:

- development of "SQL" abstraction to  support more advanced expressions
-  reporting engine (scheduled for 2.8)

I imagine there are other ongoing "big" efforts to improve QGIS. Shouldn't
we have a wiki page (or else) where each main dev topic can be shared and
discussed? It happens to see overlapping efforts, or committers and
developers wondering if someone is already working on the same
requirements.

Thanks Victor. When you're done, could you please add a note to the 
tickets I've opened on lecos, animove and lwgeom? Otherwise, please let

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Value relations in QgsExpression
Message-ID: <53D61E6E.1080200@sourcepole.ch>

Hi

In QgsVectorLayer, it is possible to define the edittype 'value 
relation' where a key is replaced by a value in a related layer. Now I'd 
like to make a function in QgsExpression that behaves similarly and 
returns the value in the related table.

My idea is to create a function 'valueRelation( value, layer_id, 
key_field, value_field )' to return that value, where layer_id is the id 
of the related layer, key_file and value_field the column names in the 
related layer.

One disadvantage of this approach is that if the relation in vectorlayer 
changes, the one in an expression needs to be changed as well. On the 
other hand it can be an advantage in certain situations to have a 
different relation in expression than in vector layer. I figured out it 
would be difficult to take the value relation dynamically from 
vectorlayer, as QgsExpression does not know its vectorlayer. A 
possibility would be to create a special column for the current layer 
id. However that seems not nice and it is too easy to forget to set that 
id when using the expression.

What are your opinions on that? Are there better ways to accomplish the 
value relation function in QgsExpression?

Regards,
Marco

Does this introduce any additional functionality compared to defining a
layer join and using the fields appended to the vector layer be this?

Do you think it would be possible to introduce this via a JOIN syntax in
QgsExpression? This way we would stay closer to SQL standard.

Another possibility I was thinking of was via the relations, with the
possibility to check some fields of a related layer as "hard joined"
which would then be available the same way that JOINED fields are now.

Matthias

	dialog?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjnNev-65BDcQhPH+smuWkRRJAtVsVVGuWY6Yni4a29_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm increasingly frustrated by QGIS' current color picker dialog - almost
enough to do something about it! So, I'm wondering if anyone has any
opinions on programs which get this right. There's almost as many variants
of color pickers as there are design programs... I see no reason why we
can't build our own custom one which matches the best of them out there.

In my opinion, the best I've seen is GIMP's design. (see
http://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/html/openSUSE_113/opensuse-apps/images/gimp-color.png
and
http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-dialogs-content.html ) The only thing I think
GIMP's dialog is missing is an alpha channel option. So, I think the
"ultimate" dialog would be something like GIMP's but with an Inkscape-style
alpha slider (see
http://lukast.mediablog.sk/i/colorchoosers/inkscape-color-chooser.png ).

Does anyone else have opinions on this?

Nyall

Hi Nyall,

Good point!
I'd love to see at least the hex/html input so I can copy and paste 
colors instead of writing down the values for r, g, b and a.

That's a good idea, I also think JOIN syntax is better.
The return of a JOIN operation is probably a tuple, so by using that as 
a QVariant, it might be possible to use something like 'JOIN( layer_id) 
ON (fieldA = fieldB).$attribute'

Would that basically be a join limited to certain attributes or would 
the handling be totally different to the layer join mechanism?

Regards,
Marco

Hi all.

v.clean does not seem to be working correctly here. The syntax should 
be tool=rmdupl, but in the log I do not see it (just an unknown "6"

What do you think about this notation?

layer_id.attr1 + layer_id.attr2 JOIN layer_id on fieldA = fieldB

The tuple would in QGIS terms be a QgsFeature I guess.

Now thinking in a more generic way, a JOIN would JOIN two tables and not
features. In that case (we possibly might end up supporting this kind of
virtual tables e.g. from python plugins) a JOIN would then return a
QgsFeatureIterator wrapped in a QVariant instead of a single tuple.
I am not sure how exactly such a feature would be integrated yet, and
how this interacts with the current expression engine (there are a
couple of shared functionalities, but also some that are different),
therefore I am also not sure if this should have any implications on the
current implementation. So this paragraph is just thinking out lout.

That would be a join limited to certain attributes and my idea is that
this would eventually be merged with the current JOIN functionality to
remove duplicated work in this area.

Hi all.
In QGIS it is easy to load a MS SQL (non spatial) table. However, when 
attempting to save it as dbf, I always get an error (something like 
"Variant type not valid for field XXX : uint received with type 0).
Is this a know limitation of the (ogr?) driver?
All the best.

Further info: fields throwing errors are of type ``tinyint``.
All the best.

Yes, that is the most generic way. Probably a bit overkill at the moment.

Hi all,
I'm trying to use the Drag and drop designer to create some forms for
my attributes.

But once created the form and clicked on OK nothing changes in the
identify result window. When reopening the Fields Tab the layout is
automatically changed to 'autogenerate'.

Should I open a ticket?

Thanks

Not so on Mac. The core simple color picker is excellent and *extensible*
[0, etc.]. The user can install many types of color pickers that become
part of the core color picker's dialog.

This is why everyone implements

This is only true for platforms that don't natively support CMYK picking,
but true nonetheless.

So, +1 from me for crafting a custom color, swatch and color palette/scheme
picker. Since QGIS has to deal with multiple platform inadequacies in this
area, it is good to bring all user's functionality up to the same level,
all while integrating better with the app. Qt certainly has the facilities
to make almost any type of picker that's needed.

However, a very big -1 for such a custom picker *replacing* access to the
system picker.

For example, the very first option in user Preferences in the latest
Photoshop is allowing the user to choose the default color picker (between
Apple's or Adobe's) [1]. I think having such an app-wide setting, with the
custom picker as initial default, and the ability to pop up the system
color picker from within the custom picker's dialog, is critical for
cross-platform user experience. Otherwise, we risk really annoying existing
users by forcing their color workflow to ours.

So are you proposing that we would switch over to our own custom
picker by default on OSX, but add an option to switch back to the
system color picker? Or default to the system picker but allow
switching to the built in one?

Does the OSX picker support CMYK colors?

The first one. Yes, make a custom picker, because it can be more integrated
with the app and standard across platforms; but, leave the option for the
user to either set their picker of choice, or offer the system picker as a
pop up picker that sets the color in a custom dialog (for access to system
picker's extra features), or both.

Only accessing the pop up system picker from QGIS's custom picker is
probably the best solution, i.e. such a pop up to the system picker would
set the current color in the custom dialog only. Then, signal/slots from
the custom dialog can be heavily used, color-picking documentation can be
standardized on the custom picker, color styles and schemes can be
integrated, and the user can always access the system picker when needed
(albeit with an extra click).

But, do this for all platforms, not just for Mac.

Does the OSX picker support CMYK colors?
>

Yes, probably for many years now [0] (since system Mac OS 7.5? [1]). This
is probably due to Macs being used for dekstop print/pre-press workflows
long before other platforms.

Hi Felix,

Any progress on this ?
I've also a case where I'd love to be able to use georeferencer with

Hi victor something is changed in the help file managing.

for the lwgeom the provider helpFile funcion is no more used and a
./help/<lowercase algorithm name>.rst is loaded

it could be ok, but for some help it's very difficult to convert from
html to rst... and loading rst with embedded images is really slow!

Why not leaving the use of helpFile in html?

lt me know how to allow algorithm help working again, I can try figure
out a patch to do this, but porbably is unuseful if you're doing a
refactoring

regards,

Luigi Pirelli (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it - luipir at gmail.com)

Hi all.
We include some feeds on our HP. As a result, it occasionally happens
that we display some commercial ads (right now we have the
announcement of Faunalia courses). I think this is not appropriate,
and should generally be avoided: thoughts?
In case we agree it is not, how to implement this? I think it is
difficult or impossible to do it automatically; perhaps we should ask
feed authors to avoid posting commercials, but this would cause the
removal of several potentially interesting entries.
Ideas and opinions welcome.
All the best.

Further tests: the command is working if applied to exactly duplicated
lines (copy-paste). Now exploring if the first case was not working
because of very small diffs in coordinates.
All the best.

I imagine that feed posts can be equiped with custom tags and that
qgis.org can filter feeds by tags. Maybe the authors in question want to
support the noncommercial character of the qgis.org website through
tagging advertisements in their feeds as advertisements. QGIS as a
project would be a good identity to propose a standardized tag for this,
let's say "advertisement". :) I don't know about how many authors we
talk, but maybe someone could ask them all individually and that already
solves the issue.

Best wishes
Daniel

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Pyqgis :2.2 : link between a signal and an event
Message-ID: <1406656954178-5154002.post@n6.nabble.com>

I'm writing a pyqgis 2.2 plugin with qgis 2.2 I succeeded in accessing and
displaying vector data (geometries & attributes). I succeed also to create a
'beforecomitechanges' signal ( emitted, before changes are commited to the
data provider). Thus a message has appeared into qgis logwindow ("comit
change" label) after editing operations and before commiting toward the dp).
Please read following piece of code allowing to do that:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
def beforeLayerCommitChange(self):

       QgsMessageLog.logMessage( "commit change" )
       QApplication.beep()

layer.beforeCommitChanges.connect(self.beforeLayerCommitChange)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I would like to generate others signals. i would like generate the
displaying of information messages (number of features that have been
added,modifyied,deleted, the id of the features which have been modified,
the name of the layer..).

COuld you throw light for me ? THanks.

If the courses are about QGIS I dont see this as a problem.

I think we could do something to consume only feed articles that have
QGIS as their category. I found a wordpress plugin for that [1] which
I will set up for Kartoza - I guess there must be similar plugins for
other CMS platforms.

Message-ID: <CAECJsSo1rbXDRL45=ibDi7D7EFtFaVaM4PnA9c=CyW37ny51PQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all
I'm tring to upload and share my first plugin at [1] but encountered an
error I don't really understand. It says:
*There were errors reading plugin package (please check also your plugin's
metadata). Cannot find __init__.py or metadata.txt in the compressed
package: this does not seems a valid plugin (I searched for
help/__init__.py and help/metadata.txt)*

I have __init__.py and metadata.txt files but they are in the main folder
(I use Plugin Builder plugin) and none of the plugin folders I looked at
has such files in help folder.
So, why is it looking for these files in the help folder?
What did I make wrong? Is it a bug? and if not, what should contain these
files?

Some help? Thanks a lot.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Get signal on edited feature ?
Message-ID: <1406719381453-5154173.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

Regarding my pyqgis plugin 2.2 , I've implemented signal on a vector layer
event  successfully. For instance, whenever i create a new feature, i can
read a new basic message appeared via QGIS logging system : " feature
added". 

But for some  events, besides this basic message, i would like read the name
of the layer and/or , the id of the feature/ the attribut name / the
geometry type (line,surf,punct). 

How to bring more info details for the events? 

I paste below my piece of code : 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
def logLayerModified(self, onlyGeometry = None ):
		QgsMessageLog.logMessage( "layer modified" )
		QApplication.beep()	
		
def logAttributeAdded(self,QgsFeatureId):
		QgsMessageLog.logMessage( "attribut added" )
 		QApplication.beep()
		
def logAttributeDeleted(self,QgsFeatureId):
		QgsMessageLog.logMessage( "attribut deleted" )
 		QApplication.beep()
		
def logFeatureAdded(self,QgsFeatureId):
		QgsMessageLog.logMessage("feature added, id = " + str(QgsFeatureId))
		QApplication.beep() 
		
def logFeatureDeleted (self,QgsFeatureId):
		QgsMessageLog.logMessage("feature deleted, id = " + str(QgsFeatureId))
		QApplication.beep() 
		
def logGeometryChanged(self,fid)
		QgsMessageLog.logMessage("Geometry changed, id = " + str(fid))
		QApplication.beep() 
		
def logAttributeValueChanged (self, QgsFeatureId fid, int idx, const
QVariant &)
		QgsMessageLog.logMessage("Attribut value changed", id = " +
str(QgsFeatureId))
		QApplication.beep() 
	
	
def logBeforeLayerCommitChange(self):
		QgsMessageLog.logMessage( "commit change" )
 		QApplication.beep()


               layer.layerModified.connect(self.logLayerModified)	
	        layer.attributeAdded.connect(self.logAttributeAdded)
		layer.attributeDeleted.connect(self.logAttributeDeleted)
		layer.featureAdded.connect(self.logFeatureAdded)
		layer.featureDeleted.connect(self.logFeatureDeleted)     
		layer.featureDeleted.connect(self.logGeometryChanged)                                                   
		layer.beforeCommitChanges.connect(self.logBeforeLayerCommitChange)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Anti aliasing issues with no-border at adjacent
	polygons
Message-ID: <53D905C2.3010500@carto.net>

Hi,

I am forwarding this issue from the QGIS user mailing-list.

When you have adjacent polygons and render them with just fills and no
borders there are rendering artefacts (thin lines shining through from
the white background) coming from anti aliasing.

See http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10984
and the email-thread starting at
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2014-July/028603.html

I am pretty sure this is an issue of the qt-rendering library. Either
there is a rendering setting that helps to solve the issue or there is
probably not much we can do.

I am pretty sure the problem also disappears if you disable anti aliasing.

This issue was probably already discussed before?

I know that some rendering libraries, such as AGG solved this issue -
see http://www.antigrain.com/screenshots/ and search for "adjacent
polygons" in the text.

Any thoughts?

Andreas

Dear Junior,

in the zip file you have to use the same directory structure as in the
.qgis2/python/plugins directory. If the name of your plugin is "xxx" then
in the zip there sould be a xxx directory which contains the __init__.py 
and metadata.txt and the main python file xxx.py, you can use other 
subdirectories too.
xxx.zip:
   xxx - __init__.py
         metadata.txt
         xxx.py
         ...
         help
         ...

Try to download a plugin from plugins.qgis.org and check the structure of 
the zip file.
I hope this helps you.

Regards,
Zoltan

Thanks a lot. You are right!!! I was packaging the contents of my plugin
folder instead of packaging the whole main folder.
It's ok now. all is uploaded.

Thank you!

Check the QObject.sender() of the signal.

Hi,

Just a quick note about an update for github.com issues and pull requests
[0]. Finally, it is very simple for finding all PRs that are assigned to
you, etc. And (one we have been waiting for), you'll get a notification if
an issue/PR is assigned to you.

The milestones functionality is improved. Maybe it would be good to start
using that (don't need to turn on Issues), or a similar functionality via
Redmine?

I still look forward to the day when they support attachments of data

Dear list,
i would like to know if it is possible to implement a plugin in QGIS
to overlay two map layer for interactive comparison, like the Map
Swipe tool in GRASS GIS[1,2].

If it is possible, what would be the best approach to implement it?

Many thanks in advance,

Yes it can be done. I'm working on a plugin at the moment and as a core
feature.

Hello,

1/ For my pyqgis plugin 2.2, i try to

When i try to add a feature, this following error message appears: 

/TypeError : logFeaturesAdded() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given). /

2/ Always for my plugin, i can load a vector layer succesfully. But when i
try to zoom to the layer extent. But it does not work. How to do in order to
zoom to the layer extent?

Hi all.
Apparently base maps are not printed in LizMap; this is correct when 
using proprietary layers, but is a serious hindrance when using one's 
own layers (e.g. ortophoto).
Is this confirmed? If so, is there a workaround for this?
Thanks.

Message-ID: <dc455b737d7d94ae61ff49dd57f487c2@mx1.faunalia.it>

Hi all.
When printing from LizMap, we frequently get a 500 (internal server) 
error.
This happens when layers present in legend are not switched on in the 
legend.
On apache log I see:

[Thu Jul 31 10:55:08.533910 2014] [fcgid:warn] [pid 16838] [client 
127.0.0.1:39011] mod_fcgid: error reading data, FastCGI server closed 
connection

process /usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi(17148) exit(communication 
error), get unexpected signal 11

So it seems a server error (or LizMap issuing a wrong req?). Should I 
open a ticket?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

QGIS web client has a new feature to also print base maps (they are
automatically replaced by corresponding QGIS layers). Just committed a
few days ago:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Web-Client/commit/2dfda6dc5346f4e409fad5550663b3332534e4a2

Of course this doesn't work for external layers not controlled by QGIS
server.

Lizmap could do something similar.

Andreas

Not exactly, but it is good to know that several map canvas can be
used in parallel.

Hey Soeren,

Nothing yet.  I might have some time next week for the plugin.

Seems similar to:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9763
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9295

so I implemented this:

http://www.itopen.it/2014/03/13/qgis-server-setup-notes/

but it does not help, so it must be something different.
BTW, I'm working on LizMap 2.10beta4. I can send the address of an 
unofficial demo to those interested.

All the best.

Hello,
For the first question, I think you have done something like
logFeaturesAdded(Idofmylayer, features) instead of doing
self.logFeaturesAdded(Idofmylayer, features).The function you created has
three args : self, layerId, addfeatures. When using it you should give him
three args. The second expression has three arguments not the first one.
Try that.

for your second question, give a look at self.iface.zoomToActiveLayer(),
after having activated your layer. There may be another way but...

I think one good way to learn how to use all this is to make tests with the
qgis Python Console and you'll quickly find the best functions to call.

Apparently this is the result of activating the option "Get images 
directly from WMS server".
Anyone confirms?
All the best.

Just for the record: my mistake - setting a too low value in Project 
properties for "Maximums for GetMap request" is the cause of the issue.
Sorry for the noise.

Found (thanks Luigi). Before restoring, XML should be set (in the

SET xmloption TO DOCUMENT

Then restore runs smoothly.

I confirm it does solve the issue.
I think we should set up a simpler solution however.

Everyone is invited to make a pull-request to the documentation or edit
the QGIS server tutorial on the wiki.

Obviously - installing QGIS server is somewhat trickier than QGIS
desktop, because you have to deal with Apache, Apache rewriting,
potentially also password protection, etc - and you have to make sure
that all the paths to resources and Postgis connections from QGIS
desktop are still reachable by QGIS server.

The X-requirement is unfortunately necessary because of the way qt works
for PDF generation and for the integration of SVG symbols/patterns.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] In a QGIS plugin,
	can't start a thread from a QDockWidget control...
Message-ID: <CABF2ZKTd46bXWgoyfkCYEyCcngBnHW1OM7NXuwARvBin74oNyQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have to convert a QGIS plugin (2.2.0-Valmiera 32 bits) from a QDialog to
a QDockWidget. While succeeding in doing the conversion (the plugin is now
docked), the threads which are launched from the plugin do not work
anymore. Any idea why this happens and how to solve this? Here is an
example showing my problem using only a QPushButton that starts a thread:

First, my plugDockDialog.py file:

class PlugDockDialog(QDockWidget, Ui_PlugDock): def __init__(self):
QDockWidget.__init__(self, None) self.setupUi(self)

and (the significant parts of) my plugDock.py file:

class PlugDock: def __init__(self, iface): self.iface = iface self.dlg =
PlugDockDialog() self.iface.addDockWidget( Qt.RightDockWidgetArea, self.dlg
) cmd = self.dlg.findChild(QPushButton,"cmdGo")
cmd.clicked.connect(self.cmdGoClick) # Thread method @staticmethod def
myfunc(i): time.sleep(3) print "Docking thread %d is finished..." % i #
Click method def cmdGoClick(self): t = Thread(target=self.myfunc,
args=(1,)) t.start()

Thank you for your help!

I'm still convinced that this is mainly a packaging problem.

It's rather common for other (debian-like) packages to provide default
apache working configs and to install dependencies (could be optional
too).

It's just a (fast)CGI after all.

Of course the deafult installation must be fine-tuned or tweaked for
production websites but this is also true for all other web
applications.

but for which distribution? Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Redhat, SuSE,
Windows, OSX? That's a lot of work for relatively few users on each
platform.

I don't think that installing any other geoserver (Geoserver, UMN,
ArcGIS) is much easier. Maybe the documentation and tutorials are better
- but installation - is this really a problem?

Everybody has different ideas how to organize files, configs, etc.
Probably you wouldn't like my defaults and vice versa.

But as I said - if someone wants to provide packages for a specific
platform - he/she is welcome.

I'm now investigating with Debian. Once fixed there, Ubuntu can follow 
easily.
IMHO the easier the better. Installing qgis-server is extremely easy, 
it's a pity the main trouble is just a fake X server.
All the best.

I don't know about Geoserver and ArcGIS but UMN Mapserver CGI  works
out of the box on debian/ubuntu after an apt-get install

Sure, but this is true for all web applications. The packagers usually
provide minimal and sensible defaults to get started with a working
CGI server.

I believe this is a task for package maintainers.

Message-ID: <CAO5q9-QfUWvBK1myn4PTvTXdsP5uVb8aAxuundLErqoSxjZWXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

to select postgis features, I'm using something like:
s =
myLayer.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterExpression(u'id=%s'%feat_id))
for f in s:
     myLayer.setSelectedFeatures([f.id()])

Works fine with existing features.
How to do the same, during editing session of postgis layer, with new
features having temporary negative ids ?

Thanks.
Regards
Fred.

Hi,

I ran into this as well, again with Centos and gcc 4.4.7.  There are handful
of places with, for example:

QgsVectorLayerFeatureIterator::QgsVectorLayerFeatureIterator( ... )
    : QgsAbstractFeatureIteratorFromSource( ... )

that needs to be switched to 
QgsVectorLayerFeatureIterator::QgsVectorLayerFeatureIterator( ... )
    : QgsAbstractFeatureIteratorFromSource<QgsVectorLayerFeaturesSource>(
... )

as seen in the declaration in the header file.  I believe this is happening
because Centos has a older version of the compiler that isn't smart enough
to add the template to the parent class.

Todd
