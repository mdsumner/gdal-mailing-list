The excellent Juergen took care of this:
as of 2b7e49b9d1c3c918b2e4a058e6770f5f65878e24 there's a checkbox
in the General tab of Options window.

Currently, it's still off by default.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Again about python libs install ... for GEarthView
	2
Message-ID: <CAFF9ZhvpKaCZwXMAucZka6PEAUSXdkKU8UutJ9Uip3Og2CEc8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


sorry if you get bored with unnecessary questions about python libraries to
install :)

I need to install the following:

twisted
zope
qtreactor


Using  "pip install"   I succesfully installed the first two libraries.

But I have these errors with   "qtreactor"

Downloading/unpacking qtreactor
  Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement qtreactor
Cleaning up...
No distributions at all found for qtreactor
Storing debug log for failure in C:\Users\rangeletti\pip\pip.log


qtreactor is needed for new version 2.0  of my plugin  GEarthView :

https://github.com/geodrinx/gearthview


Someone can help me to fix the problem ?


Thank you

Roberto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsDiagramRendererV2 and
 QgsLinearlyInterpolatedDiagramRenderer properties access
Message-ID: <54A7C528.80401@sigeal.com>

Hi,

I am working on a QGis 2.6 python plugin in which I use diagram renderers :
dr = QgsLinearlyInterpolatedDiagramRenderer()
...
dr.setUpperValue(myUpperValue)
...
myLayer.setDiagramRenderer(dr)

This works well, and if my data change, I can update the renderer this way :
dr = myLayer.diagramRenderer()
dr.setUpperValue(myNewUpperValue)

Now here is my problem : If I modify myLayer properties from QGis user 
interface, I can't access its diagram properties anymore, because dr = 
myLayer.diagramRenderer() returns a QgsDiagramRendererV2 object instead 
of a QgsLinearlyInterpolatedDiagramRenderer one.
So when I try to set the new upper value, I get this error :
AttributeError: 'QgsDiagramRendererV2' object has no attribute 
'setUpperValue'

Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong ?

Any hint greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance,

I've noticed that building in the source tree generates about 1800
non-ignored files. What's the policy about ignoring them ? Should ignores
be put in the top-level .gitignore file or spread across per-dir ones ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Diagram transparency
Message-ID: <54A7FAF4.1090707@sigeal.com>

Hi,

I can't manage to make diagrams layers transparent using python.
Here is what I do :

dr = QgsLinearlyInterpolatedDiagramRenderer()
ds = QgsDiagramSettings()
...
ds.transparency = 70
...
dr.setDiagramSettings(ds)
...
myLayer.setDiagramRenderer(dr)

The strange thing is that if I open the layer properties dialog, 
transparency is correctly set in the diagram's appearence tab.
Moreover, if I validate the dialog, the diagrams become transparent...

Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong ?

Thanks for any help,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rotation issues status
Message-ID: <20150103201613.GA28969@localhost>

FYI, I've fixed some of the known rotation-related issues:

 - Identify feature highlight (#11815)
 - Zoom by rect (#11910)
 - Select by point (#11930)
 - Select by rect (#11865)
 - Rotation support in pre-rendered map display (#11909)

Known issues left (in my personal priority order)

 - Inverted polygon renderer (#11911) [ currently set as blocker ]
 - Plugin layers (#11900) [ needs feedback ]
 - Labels pre-rotation (#11814, #11856)
 - Composer support (#11912)
 - North Arrow Decoration (#11818)
 - Grid decoration (#11817)
 - Overview map (#11862) [ not sure this should be fixed ]

Please report any other issue that might arise with rotation enabled
and properly tag it with the "rotation" label.

Hopefully next PSC meeting will help triaging them to properly
set priorities so to have a clear view on what would take to have
rotation enabled by default.

Eh, I usually don't, but that's a workaround, not a solution.
We do have a .gitignore for a reason.

Thanks Richard.

Given that MetaSearch is now officially in QGIS core, we probably need
to cut an out of band release (0.3.3) to plugins.qgis.org, which is
built from QGIS core (0.3.2 is built from outside QGIS core).

Now, using MetaSearch from master (not installed in my home)
geoportale is working, UNEP still throws an error.
All the best, and thanks for checking.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] python code in form
Message-ID: <CAM_TN38yTVok9w027Z8tAxd9ZNyTiFGSUYzf2yU7bTFeBK++aQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using the init python function in order to add python code into my QGIS
forms. This is a great function because I can add intelligence to my form
without write a plugin, but I still have some problems:
- I want to store qml and .ui file directly into Postgres so that when my
users load a layer from postrgres they've my forms and styles, without pass
to us a qgis project, but in this way I loose the python code. Is there a
way to store also the python code in postgres or into qml?
- when I change my python code, qgis can't auto reload it. I have to save
the file with a different name and I have to change the name in the layer
properties. Is there a way to force autoreload of the code, also only for
debugging?

I also thought to move my code in a plugin to bypass those problems but I
think I've to rewrite all useful function that come with the forms
properties, eg: the combo population. is It right or there's a way to
include the QGIS forms add-on into a plugin?

Sorry for my newbie's question and thanks in advance.
Luca

Hi Mantas,

Merry Christmas also from our side.

QGIS Mobile is a very young initiative developed by us at OPENGIS.ch.

It provides a user interface which is being designed with touch devices and field work in mind.

As such, the user interface is being completely rewritten from scratch using QML, a technology by Qt that targets development of responsive user interfaces.

We are currently still in an early stage and are working on a lot of features that are considered to be crucial for efficient and effective work. Once we have a product that we consider to be stable enough, we will release a publicly available .apk. Until we reach that point development snapshots will be distributed individually to interested parties which are requested to contact us directly.

Best regards and a happy new year,
Matthias

Hi Luca,

this is a bit off topic but when you store your data in PostgreSQL you 
might want to try out the DataDrivenInputMask plugin [1] which has a lot 
of (database) intelligence in the form and can be customized to hold 
even more. Maybe you do not need to customize QGIS' forms any more.

Thanks for this, very interesting.
I'm available for early testing is useful.
One question: why not adhering to the long standing mantra "Release

These are the news:

New 1:   It moves the QGIS window according with GoogleEarth view
New 2:   It displays in QGIS XYZ coodinates from GoogleEarth view center
New 3:   It puts a new point in GoogleEarth view center containing a QrCode
New 4:   It puts the GoogleEarth view center points in QGIS


It is needed to Install the following python libraries:

twisted\            Twisted-13.0.0-py2.7-win32
                 ( https  pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted/13.0.0  )

zope\               zope.interface-3.6.0-py2.7-win32
                 ( https pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface/3.6.0 )


Regards

Roberto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.6: .ui form window size
Message-ID: <1420472742945-5180053.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello everyone,

Following a message on Georezo : 
http://georezo.net/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=262178
<http://georezo.net/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=262178>   I was advised to post
a message here by calling Matthias Khun.

I try to adapt tools running on QGIS 2.2 to version 2.6 but I have a
blocking bug...

I use to complete my attribute tables forms created with QT- Creator (.ui )
associated with pythons files that allow me to create drop-down lists , data
validation , etc. and blocking bug : *resize windows with a button or simply
open the form.*

For this I use the following code that works fine with 2.2 but has no effect
on the 2.6:
code :


	
It works well on objects from my window ( groupbox , text box, etc.) but not
on the size of the window even her.

Do you have an explanation or idea to solve this problem?

/*Note:* In terms of the explanation , I can be a track: When the form
opens, there is now a "Actions" button that corresponds to the predefined
actions on the tables (see PJ) . Very useful but should certainly compel
QGIS to group the ui + provided something for this button to produce the
window and no longer use the .ui directly.../

Thank you in advance and Happy New year !

Hi Bernard, thanks for the tip. I've seen DataDrivenInputMask some time ago
and I promised myself to deepen it because I use lots of data stored
postgres and this plugin seems very useful. However the main limitations
for this very project are that I must use custom forms (to insert the
project logo and more stuff) and it also should work with spatialite.

thanks
Luca

I would say, especially with CMake, an out-of-source-tree build is good
standard practice, not a workaround. Dev tools like QT Creator even default
to a separate build directory outside of the source directory for CMake
projects.

I don't think massively changing .gitignore to accommodate an in-source
build, so subsequent commits can be done, is worth it. Why run the risk of
masking real source-tree changes with excessive ignores, when you can just
build in another (sub)directory?

Regards,

Larry

Hi Luca,

There was a /DEBUGMODE/ attribute introduced some time ago, that can be
set on the python form module. If it is set to True, the changes should
be reloaded automatically when you reopen the form.

Hi Matthias,

Thank you for your quick response.

This code works when I click resize button (open) I created , thanks.
But at first opening of form window is not the right size as if function was
not read ...

Here is my code structure:



Strange is not it?

Regards,
Guillaume

I can't see your code, it seems to be swallowed by something.
You could try to add after the resize also the following line (untested
experiment)

dialog.window().saveGeometry()

Hi,

Thank to  Matthias Kuhn's comment on QGis issues list :
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11957
Here is the answser to my question :
Transparency has to be set as alpha values for every color in 
QgsDiagramSettings.
The transparency variable has to be set accordingly in order to preserve 
the integrity of the layer properties dialog.

Hope this can help someone,

Message-ID: <1420620400347-5180297.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi All,

I have tried to update the Selection color in the project Properties.

prj = QgsProject.instance()
prj.writeEntry( "Gui", "/SelectionColorRedPart", 255 )
prj.writeEntry( "Gui", "/SelectionColorGreenPart", 255 )
prj.writeEntry( "Gui", "/SelectionColorAlphaPart", 255 )
prj.writeEntry( "Gui", "/SelectionColorBluePart", 0 )

By executing the above code in QGIS 2.0 Dufour, it works fine. But in QGIS
2.6 Brighton the same is not working. Kindly help me to resolve the issue.

Thanks and Regards,
Mohanakarthick

Hi Martin,

I just saw your recent commit for support of multiple styles - but I 
don't fully get it how it works. I can add a new style and can switch to 
another style, but it seems whenever I change the symbology, it resets 
all styles at once?

Or maybe I don't fully get it how it is supposed to work.

BTW: cool feature - would be cool to also expose the multiple styles in 
QGIS server (e.g. to support color and black/white styles) for the same 
layer.

This commit is part of a sponsored project which includes the server side
too (WMS STYLES parameter). It will be there ;)

When you change symbology, only the currently active style should be
modified - the others should stay the same (if not then there's a bug and
please let me know). This should work: 1. add a layer, 2. add a new style
to it (will get activated), 3. change symbology, 4. switch back to previous
style - you should see the previous symbology.

The idea is to have the possibility to define several styles for a layer -
and quickly switch between them. Before you would need to save and then
load the styles from QML files.

As the style incorporates not only rendering appearance, but also other
things like forms, so you could define different forms for different
styles. Endless new opportunities :-)

I was wondering the same as Andreas. And now I get it. No more duplicate
layers for different print composers! Nice :)

Will this include choosing the layer style by data-defined-properties?
And could this style choice be saved in the presets?
It would do wonders in projects with several composers and in atlas
generation.

Thanks for your work!

Eventually yes, but it is not in my plan right now...

Hi Martin,

Does it support a change of renderer? E.g. start with a simple fill 
renderer in one styles and then change to a categorized or rule-based 
renderer in another style?

It works fine for me if I stay within one renderer, but kind of acts 
weird if I start changing renderers in the different styles.

Cool to hear about the presets/style choice in print composer and 
support in QGIS server!

Hi Dev,

I just publish a github repository about my work on using 
QGIS-Processing through PyWPS
https://github.com/rldhont/PyWPS-QGIS-Processing

This work is based on what I do next year and what Alessandro Pasotti 
has done
https://github.com/elpaso/qgis-wps/blob/master/WPS.py

It's just a quick and dirty way to publish QGIS Processing Functionality 
to World Wide Web Through WPS.

Feel free to test it and give feedback.

Regards,
Ren?-Luc

Could anyone share even an old document explaining the .QGS file structure?

An old GIS.SE thread

I see that "Lock layers for map item" inside the composer doesn't blocks a
style switch. I think it would be a useful feature.

Hi Martin,

I can confirm that the switching between styles, when different 
renderers are involved, is now fixed.

Thanks a lot!

I am considering to add locking of styles when locking layers in map items.
Otherwise the use of styles is somehow limited in map composer (does not
allow two maps with the same layers with different styles).

Hi,

I was trying to enable map rotation in QGIS master, by setting

QGIS_ENABLE_CANVAS_ROTATION

to any value (tried 1 or true).

However, it has no effect. The rotation GUI seems to stay hidden. Is the 
env-var still the way to enable rotation or is there another setting?

Thanks,
Andreas

You just need to enable the checkbox in the "General" options and restart
QGIS.

Hi,

Still the same problem.

Sorry for code, but here it is:

def formTravROpen(dialog,layerid,featureid):

	global myDialog
	myDialog = dialog
	myDialog.window().resize(1263,726)    # Resizes window to the first opening
	myDialog.window().saveGeometry()
	
	global open
	open = dialog.findChild(QToolButton,"open")
	
	[......]
	
	QObject.connect(open, SIGNAL("clicked()"), fct_agrandir)
	
def fct_agrandir():                                    # Resizes window when
button is clicked
	if(myDialog.window().width() != 1263):
		myDialog.window().resize(1263,726)

	else:
		myDialog.window().resize(701,726)


Thank you very much for your time.

Guillaume

Subject: [Qgis-developer] processing - new geoalgorithme FieldsMapper
Message-ID: <54AFC8DD.10308@camptocamp.com>

I've made a Pull Request in processing plugin with a new GeoAlgorithm.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1753

Can someone take a look at this (volaya or alexbruy), we would like it 
to be pulled before feature freeze.

Objective of this new QGIS GeoAlgorithm is to provide a user friendly 
tool to refactor layer fields.

It takes a standard ParameterVector as input.

 From there, the user can :

  * Change some field's names or type.
  * Add or delete some fields.
  * Reorder fields.
  * Calculate new fields based on expressions.

The result is write through a standard OutputVector parameter.

This GeoAlgorithm can be used in modeler.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CRS problem in stand alone application
Message-ID: <CAHsKc1oEnA3U3NQRK0Wo73++HUoGccTPAjGFqqNoeJ82tzgBNw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I have a very annoying problem with my QGIS stand alone application, I have
already asked this question to the QGIS User Community but without luck.
It seems that the application can not create a coordinate reference system,
and this is affecting my whole workflow.
The script works perfectly inside the QGIS python console, but not in the
stand alone mode.

from qgis.core import *
QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/usr", True)
QgsApplication.initQgis()
app = QgsApplication([], True)
map_projection = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(4326,
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.EpsgCrsId)
map_projection_descr = map_projection.description()
print map_projection.isValid()


The output of the last line is 'False'.
I tried to change the prefix path to "/usr/share/qgis/resources/? but this
doesn?t make any difference.
I?m using python 2.7.6 on Ubuntu 14.04. QGIS version: 2.6.1


Thank you in advance.
Best Regards,


Andrea

Hi, some related questions on the fly:
I'm developping some processing scripts too. 
1- What is our policy for new scripts, adding them to QGIS core, or
contribute them to QGIS-processing repository ressources?

 2- How can we handle dependencies, and other ressources linked to a  script
(UI, html templates....) ? This seems possible when commiting to core, but
will not be handled by script installer tool in processing repository

 3 -Is there a plan improve script downloader to a  "plugin-installer" like
tool for scripts, with some filter tools, votings.. ? 

Cheers

R?gis

Hi List,

I found a bug in GdalTools/Clipper, when a mask layer is used with a 
filter expression, the generated gdalwarp command is is not valid.
The generated  command looks like this:
gdalwarp -q -cutline "poly.shp|layerid=0|subset=\"Nev\" = 'Heves'"
-crop_to_cutline input.tif output.tif

the correct command would be:
gdalwarp -q -cutline "poly.shp" -cwhere="Nev='Heves'"
-crop_to_cutline input.tif output.tif

I suppose in getArgsModeMask (doClipper.py) after line 167 the mask should 
be processed if it contains "|".

Best regards,
Zoltan

I've just posted a new demonstration video at

This showcases layer effects for line and polygon layers, and an outer
glow effect.

Funding is getting very close, but we're almost out of time. Please

Hello martin,

I have tested today and this feature is great.

In terms of UX, one thing I found strange is the fact that saving presets
and saving styles work differently. Any change to the layer properties
updates the current style, while any change in layers order, visibility or
even choosen style is not saved to the "current" preset. You need to add a
new preset to save that changes.

So, if you want to create a new style you need to add one before you do any
changes to properties, where in the presets you need to do the changes
before you add a new preset (and it's not possible to update it)

In general writing unit tests for graphical interface code is difficult and
they are of limited use. They are typically fragile, they add maintenance
overhead and there are too many states to test. Those who know [1]
recommend to focus on tests for the core logic (in our case mainly
qgis_core library). GUI bugs are usually minor and easy to spot and fix,
while core logic bugs cause most of serious problems.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] cannot compile qgis on opensuse 13.2 (64 bit)
	**newbie**
Message-ID: <20150111173457.240402fd@linux-t92v>

Hi,
I have previously done compiles of qgis by following instructions
similar to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/INSTALL, 
with only minor trouble. I now have a new PC and new version opensuse -
and I cannot work out why it is not compiling.

The error I get is:

make[2]: *** No rule to make target
'/usr/lib/postgresql93/lib64/libpq.so', needed by
'output/lib/qgis/plugins/libpostgresprovider.so'.  Stop.
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1978: recipe for target
'src/providers/postgres/CMakeFiles/postgresprovider.dir/all' failed
make[1]: ***
[src/providers/postgres/CMakeFiles/postgresprovider.dir/all] Error 2


My understanding is that libpq.so is part of postgres, and should not
need to be built.
In my install libpg.so is in /usr/lib64.

I have tried a number of different values for the POSTGRESQL_PREFIX
value in ccmake, without any success.

Could someone please give me an idea how to get libpostgresprovider.so
to build.

I do have an active postgres database which I have used to provide data
to an installed version of qgis.

With thanks,
H

I am aware of that - the visibility presets work as "snapshots" instead of
staying active when configuration changes. The reason behind this was that
due to implementation details it wasn't possible to have different active
sets of "checked legend items" - e.g. one set for main canvas and another
set for composer map. Now with changes I have done to support styles it
seems like there could be a way to make presets work like styles (to keep
the active configuration). Most likely I will not have a chance to work on
it before 2.8 feature freeze - but maybe in a future release...

Message-ID: <CAFF9ZhvQM5B4Ru4EaXHmePftecO2-2DxFF4KQ_KqjT_dt60rrg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


I noticed that something must be changed in metadata.txt syntax.

Inserting a plugin in repository, now it returns this error:

"There were errors reading plugin package (please check also your plugin's
metadata).
The 'experimental' flag in the form does not match the 'experimental' flag
in the plugins package metadata."

And then:

"This field is required"


Sorry to bother, but something changed, because my metadata.txt file is the
same that before.

Someone knows what is changed ?   There is a documentation ?


Thank you

Roberto

Roberto,

what I read here:
- in your metadata.txt you had 'true'
- but in the form with which you uploaded it, you checked false
(or the other way around)
so: there was a mismatch between what was said in metadata.txt and the
upload form and we do not know which one is correct?

- the experimental flag is required???
>From this docs:
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html#plugin-metadata
it should NOT be...

maybe Alessandro knows better?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

AFAIK nothing has changed recently:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/commits/master

the check is here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/forms.py#L81

The field is *not* required but if you specify it in metadata.txt then
you cannot set a different value in the submission form (I think this
should only be a problem when you set it to false in metadata.txt and
check it in the form).

IMHO the main problem with the user interface is that we have two (or
three) different ways to upload a revision while we should only have
one, I think I will eventually remove all submission forms except to
the big blue button and let only change a plugin (version) record by
modifying its metadata.txt file and upload a new revision.

This will solve all problems related to information conflicts between
metadata.txt and what the user enters in the form.

If you think there is a bug somewhere in the process, feel free to
file a ticket.

Hope this helps.

Hi Hugo,
Yes the planning are going well.
I have now filled in some more informations - and more to come in the following period.
We are about to send invitation both to developers and educators for this meeting.

At Monday 18. And Thuesday 19. May we will have a QGIS conference at the same place. We are working on the webpage for this.
We are writing for submission for speakers and workshops in this week. As well we are looking for sponsors :-)

We are looking forward to see you all.

Hi,
My platform is a "fresh" 64 bit Ubuntu 14.10 desktop install.
I am following these instructions:

Using anonymous checkout, I get told that there are 271040 objects.
This is then compressed to 44 objects
Download begins, but is tracking the 271040 objects instead of the "44".

Is this correct or should it be downloading what I assume to be the 
271040 objects that were compressed into 44 objects?

Hi Zoltan,

That is correct.
It is not compressed to 44 objects. It is just compressing (packing) 44
objects it has not compressed yet.
But git downloads the whole history for you since the very first version
of QGIS anyway. That is fine if you are going to develop and want to
keep track of what has been done when etc.

If you are worried about the download size, you can either use --depth 1
when cloning
http://gistflow.com/posts/430-git-clone-without-history
or just download the zip file of the branch you are interested on the
github project page.

Regards,
Matthias

Hi Matthias
Thanks for the confirmation.
I'm just "feeling around" at the moment - and not worried about the 
download size.

Are the instructions I am following still "current"?
If I find stuff that I feel maybe missing (ie: things don't go according 
to my expectations from the instructions), is there anyone particular I 
should notify?

Cheers for now,
Zoltan (The emigrant one :-)  )

Zoltan,

Jump on IRC is normally a good way if you have trouble with building.  Some
of us normally hang around there, or of course you can still email the
mailing list.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help needed: context help texts moving to Documents
Message-ID: <54B4DED9.1090802@duif.net>


Hi,

After a discussion with Martin in Essen, we now started working on the
moving of the context help text in sources [0] to links to deep links in
our Manual (either in local zip, or the online ones).

The idea is that instead of opening of a new dialog with some html we
just open the default browser and open a deeplink to a relevant page in
the manual.

Martin is busy doing the coding.
I've gone over the texts and looked for good uri's to relevant pages.

The result is here[1].

Texts with 'USE uri', I consider old or obsolete texts, and those should
just be discarded and the uri should be used.

Texts with 'MERGE !' are context text for which I either not could find
an uri in our manual, OR where the text in the context contained
information which was not in the manual.
We search for doc writers which can merge these details into the manual!

There are some other 'discussion'-texts, but those come later.

Some points I want to make:

- while most context-'Help' buttons are the default help buttons on the
default button bar, some of them are different types of custom ones.
I would vote for ALL normal Help buttons.

- The function help is also (html) in the resources. Should we not move
those to the Documentation also (where every function just has a
'deeplink' to it's description/help'.

- I think for some dialogs, context help (links) could be usefull,

Please help to merge the texts by adding your name in the 'TAKER' column
on the wiki. Or discuss here anything related.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

OK, using the instructions below, it all went pretty smoothly except for 
the few points below.
Mega-thanks to all who contributed to 'Building QGIS from source' document.

As I said below, I was using a fresh install of 64 bit Ubuntu 14.10 Desktop.
Points noted:

  * The version levels of some of the build tools & dependencies in my
    install were LOWER than required by this 'Building QGIS' document.
  * Perhaps notes on how to get newer versions (than those in the 'Main'
    repository) of these tools and dependencies would help. I just
    ignored these versions, and carried on ahead.

  * Add ccache, python-psycopg2 and python-gdal to the list for apt-get
    in section 3.3
  * In section 3.6 maybe mention the size of the git checkout and how to
    minimise it for those who need to.
  * In 3.7 mention explicitly that setting CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is in
    the ccmake panel and not as an environment variable :-)
    I missed that finer point of this and had to sudo make install - and
    then qgis wouldn't run, so I deleted everything in my 'build-master'
    and then woke up as to where to set the ${HOME}/apps pointer.
  * I ran make & make install as root even though I probably need not have.
  * You need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to ${HOME}/apps/lib before your
    compiled qgis will run.

Hope these findings helps someone.
Regards,
Zoltan

When I do start this locally compiled qgis, I do get the following error:
Python error: Couldn't load plugin 'processing' ....blah blah
and in QGIS plugins it says 'processing' is broken: Couldn't find module 
psycopg2

but QGIS does power up when I close the error window.

Hope these findings helps someone.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] calculate distance from two points along line in
	pyqgis
Message-ID: <1421169410.29370.13.camel@pierluigi-Aspire-6930G>

Hi all,

I have a line geometry (ALine) and a point(Apoint) belonging to the
ALine.
Apoint have been evaluated from a second line geometry Bline that cross
the Aline using the QgsGeometry intersection function as:
Apoint =Bline.intersection(Aline)

I need to calculate distance along Aline from the starting point of
Aline up to Apoint.

In a certain way this problem could be seen as the opposite of function
interpolate of QgsGeometry
point = geom.interpolate(currentdistance)
where it is known the distance from the beginning and it provide the
point at specific distance.
In my case I have the point but I need the distance.

Thanks
Pierluigi

Hi Pierluigi,
I don't know of such a function available from Python. I've translated a
function from GEOS (C++) to Python some time ago. If you wish I can share
it.

Hi Paolo,

all is fine here.
I tried with the current master and one points vector layer.

I believe the issue is with non-jpeg rasters:

It is a pure problem of analytical geometry or vector calculus (look at 
PyQGIS: geometry, vectors, vector algebra or direction cosines...(in French
<http://www.portailsig.org/content/pyqgis-des-geometries-des-vecteurs-de-l-algebre-vectorielle-ou-des-cosinus-directeurs> 
))

Is the line is straight the cartesian distance between two points is given
by

    def distance(point1,point2):
        #Theoretical cartesian Euclidean distance between 2 points (x,y)
        return math.sqrt((point2.x()-point1.x())**2 +
(point2.y()-point1.y())**2)

As PyQGIS has the sqrDist function, you can replace by

    def distance(point1,point2):
        return math.sqrt(point1.sqrDist(point2))

By definition, the point of intersection between two lines lies on the two
lines. It is easy to extract the start point or the end point of the lines
and calculate the distance.

If you want a confirmation, there are many algorithms in Python to verify
that 3 points are collinear

If the line has many segments, work at the straight segments level

Dear Gene,

Maybe my have not been well explained but I don't need the straight
cartesian distance but the distance following the line (as a path).
I think the code posted by Giovanni should be fine for my case.
I will test it right now.

Thanks
Pierluigi

Hi,

the POSTGRES_LIBRARY path to libpq.so is /usr/lib64/libpq.so. You need to
adapt that.

I don't have the code posted by Giovanni but this is very easy to do with 
Shapely <http://toblerity.org/shapely/manual.html>   (a Python wrapper of
GEOS).

With PyQGIS, I do it in this way:

1) by definition a polyline is composed of  straight  segments between
points (nodes)
2) after computing the intersection between the polylines , the intersecting
point lies on a particular segment, easy to determine.
3) Then a simple loop through the segments (length) allows to compute the
distance between the first point of the line and the intersection point (=
sum of segments length + the length of the segment between the first point
of the segment where the intersecting point lies and the intersection
point).

Yes gene. Plus, this script considers a point not intersecting the line.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Translation - processing plugin
Message-ID: <54B654C2.1060401@camptocamp.com>


Hello,

I want to translate processing plugin in french.
But I'm not sure about the exact translation process :

- add self.tr calls in code
- run push_ts.sh script to update english translation file and push it 
to transifex
- translate strings on transifex website
- optionnaly run pull_ts.sh to test my translation, but do not commit 
*.ts files on github

At release time, somebody will run pull_ts.sh to update translation 
files before compiling QGIS

Is this exact, does I miss something ?

Therefore there is a quicker solution iterating through the segments of the
line until a segment contains the point

The Spatial predicate is *point.within(line)* but as there are floating
point precision errors when finding a point on a line, I use the distance
with an appropriate threshold.

def pair(list):
    '''Iterate over pairs in a list '''
    for i in range(1, len(list)):
        yield list[i-1], list[i]

def distance(line,point):
    sum = 0
    for seg_start, seg_end in pair(line.asPolyline()):
        if QgsGeometry.fromPolyline([seg_start, seg_end]).distance(point) >
1e-8 : # correction of the floating point precision errors
            sum = sum + QgsGeometry.fromPolyline([seg_start,
seg_end]).length()
        if QgsGeometry.fromPolyline([seg_start, seg_end]).distance(point)<
1e-8 :
            return sum + QgsGeometry.fromPolyline([seg_start,
point.asPoint()]).length()

print distance(polyline, point)
247.25827728910002

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Retrieve value from another layer related to its
	localisation
Message-ID: <CAECJsSr0qeAdv18phz1KWzjcaeGCnx1nTuN31ZgFtCFxNtw8Ew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have two shapefiles : a line one (called "section") and a point one
(called "station") shapefiles.
The line shapefiles has fields like ID_section, ID_first, ID_last
The point file has an ID_station.
All these define a kind of network where a section begins on a station and
ends up at another station.
What I need to do is to fill :
- section ID_first field with the ID_station of the station that is the
closest to the beginning of the section
- and section ID_last field with the ID_station of the closest station to
the end of the line.

I can obtain this result while combining many analysis tools and plugins
(QChainage, Spatial_Join...). I know how I can do it. There might be a way
with processing tools and if somebody has an idea, I'll be glad to know it
however.

But what I'm really wondering is if it isn't directly possible to fill
these fields in the Field calculator using all the nice functions we have.
Indeed, QGIS 2.6 and RefFunctions plugin give relational fonctions to
retrieve values on a specific layer according to its fields, features
values or localisation.
I tried many combinations with db_query, geomnearest, geomRedef, xat/yat,
buffer, geometry, within , attribute (not all at the same time :) ).... I'm
pretty sure it's possible but I can't find. And I don't want to lose all my
hair...

Does anybody know how I can retrieve in a line shapefile's field the value
of the point feature that is the closest to the first vertex of this line,
within the field calculator?

Thanks ...

Thanks Enrico for your reply and for the plugin.

I was aware of RefFunctions and has already used it for relational
questions. And I agree with Jean that such functions (and others of your
plugins) might be core functions. I've moreover reported a feature request
to improve usability of all this #11680 <https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11680>.
And I tried it again this time. but the main problem is I don't want to
retrieve field value of the nearest point to my line geometry. I want to
retrieve field value of the nearest point *to the first vertex* of my line
geometry. While using just geomnearest, i'll get only the nearest point to
the whole line. It may be the point at the beginning or the one at the end
of the line, I can't know.
What I did is to create a point file containing my vertices and then use
refFunctions to get the nearest station ID.

But, isn't it possible to do the request without the step of creating new
point file? Using in the condition "being nearest to the geomfromWKT('POINT
(xat(0) yat(0)) ') of line feature"?
How can I write in the field calculator of a line layer such function :
dbquery ('mypointlayer', 'pointID', 'the condition is to be the nearest
point to the first vertex of the line')? Or dbvalue? Is it possible to
combine reference functions with others?

And more generally, are Reference functions conditions intended to be only
internal to the target layer or can I use values/fields from the source
layer? If latter, how can I refer to the source layer in the expression?

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rotation status and PSC meeting
Message-ID: <20150115145925.GA3041@localhost>

I've spent more time on rotation (only partially funded), fixing:

 - Label pre-rotation (#11814)
 - North Arrow Decoration (#11818)
 - Grid decoration (#11817)

Leftover issues (open for funding):

 - Plugin layers (#11900) -- needs feedback
 - Overview map (#11862) -- minor, IMHO
 - Composer support (#11912) -- wish ?
 - Atlas doesn't consider map rotation when setting scale (#11954)

Please report any other issue that might arise with rotation enabled
and properly tag it with the "rotation" label.

I'd like to partecipate to the PSC meeting tomorrow but it is only
possible for me before 18:00 CET. I hadn't found the schedule here:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/PSC_Meeting_16_January_2015
At what time do you plan to meet ?

Ok, this is somehow what I did. With QChainage plugin, no need to create
new fields and csv table. It directly creates the point geometry layer
corresponding to xat(0)/yat(0) and xat(-1)/yat(-1) with $id field, when
well setting.
I also assume that what I was trying to do directly within the line layer
field calculator is not (yet) possible.

Thanks.

Don't worry about this one - it's been around as long as atlas has existed
and wasn't introduced by your work. I plan on tackling it as part of the
layout refactor work.

The new method for rotating geometries will help a lot with this -- thank
you!

Sandro,

The last few weeks has been a nice leap forward when it comes to your
rotation feature, congratulation on that.

IMO, based on the improvements, it's worth considering _removing the
activation option altogether_ from the preference window. I can't see
any stability and usability issue that would warrant disabling it.

That said, in my view, a basic composer support (i.e. map item's
rotation feature) should be moved at the top of your priority list.
Right now, the benefits of your rotation work _cannot_ be exported
outside of the QGIS canvas, which IMO is a serious limitation. In most
of my QGIS workflows, the final cartographic products are exported
through the composer to obtain an high resolution file that can be
printed out (i.e. I can't just go save the canvas as an image :) ).
Not having map items make use of your rotation feature is a
significant restriction.

Cheers, and thanks again for the work,

Math

Sandro, Nyall,

Discussing this with Martin earlier today, he came up with a test patch to
see what would happen if the code was "blindly" modified to use
QgsMapSettings' setRotation() function. The result is interesting, it
actually _mostly_ works (see attached patch):
- before the patch, rotating the map composer of 45 degrees looked like
this: http://i.imgur.com/8e88VZf.png
- applying the patch, rotating the map composer of 45 degrees now looks
like this: http://i.imgur.com/VudbYrn.png

The map rotation without the patch shows the current limitations, namely
undesired rotated label, undesired rotated symbology, etc.

With the patch applied, the label is horizontal, and my centroid triangle
symbology's orientation is respected. There is however an issue with the
calculation of the rotated map extend leading to a slightly misplaced map
overview polygon on the larger map as well as a slight misalignment of the
grid.

Regarding the map overview issue, this got me to think that instead of
having a map visibility extend calculation code in the composer map item,
the QgsMapSettings object should have a function that returns a visible
extend polygon (in WKT string, or whatever). That would simplify and
bulletproof the code in many places beyond the composer map item.

Food for thoughts.

Message-ID: <CAMMN2u1N2U=FaZZsvhEgnrguPmpzg0LRbkxz-=R6mrNiBU9aHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
I'm trying to run the Processing Execute SQL algorithm with super simple
following query:

select * from au where ID > 100 group by ID

But it returns this error (Processing log):

GDAL execution console output

ERROR 1: SQL Expression Parsing Error: syntax error


No problem with other simple query like:

select * from au where ID > 100 order by ID

so maybe the error is related to *group by*.

Am I doing something wrong?

Cheers

Agreed. I've rencently pushed a local implementation of that calculation
in the grid decoration code, if you want to move it up.

Right now we have the concept of "visibleExtent" which is still a rectangle
(enclosing the actual visible polygon) and an "extent" (which is just an
encoding of center & scale, and might be better to deprecate at one point).
It would not be bad to add a "visibleArea" or "visiblePolygon" function.
Then the "visibleExtent" one could be implemented by just taking the
extent fo the "visiblePolygon".

More tests would also be important to add...

Hi, 
not sure, did you try double quotes on fields names, like:

select * from au where "ID" > 100 group by "ID"

?

Hi, 
I faced today a trouble when trying to share a map with custom color ramps.
QGIS does not embed color ramps in qgs files, same behaviour as SVG symbols. 

When we have additionnal paths for SVG symbols, I couldn't find the same for
additionnal symbols and color ramps. How can I achieve that? 

Could we add another optional for this ? 

Cheers,

Hi R?gis,
nope, same error with the quotes.

BTW: `au` is a shapefile, but if I load it in a SpatiaLite DB and if I use
DB Manager the query runs without problems.

Last information: same error in 2.6 and in Master

Cheers

Ok, 
I see some issues:;:
1- your query does WHERE  +  GROUp BY. SQL standards requires a HAVING
CLAUSE with group by:

select * from au group by ID HAVING ID > 100

2- Geoprocessing waits for a spatial layer in return. I think  you need to
add explicit aggregate operators for your columns and geometry columns. 
select ST_UNION(GEOMETRY) GEOMETRY, sum(myfield1) sum  FROM au group by ID
HAVING ID > 100

3- not sure geoprocessing will handle that correctly if you do not need a
spatial table. I did it once using ogr SQL execute from a python script.
Ther you can handle exactly what output type you need (text, table, html
result...)

mmm I made some attempts but always the same parsing error..

so, you are saying that the error in Processing is related to the GEOMETRY
column right?
in the DB manager I can run the same query and then load the file when I
specify the GEOMETRY column. That's ok

But why I don't have any problem with other statements like order by?

When I ran those queries the file is correctly loaded with no GEOMETRY
specifications..

Thanks

Message-ID: <CAMB2qw29+E46HwN+4NXZ52UX0PVmkMdpBMdOAEbPH+WweLDxEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

this line:

  var dashpos = urlBaseArray[3].indexOf('-')

causes trouble to us. We had to comment it and put:

  var dashpos = -1

because we use this URL to access to our Qgis Web Client (we use URL
rewriting, too):

  http://ourserver/qgis-web-client/general/general/....

and with serverAndCGI set to:

  var serverAndCGI="http://ourserver/qgis-web-client/wms"

the original 'dashpos' sets the wmsURI to:

  wmsURI = 'http://ourserver/qgis-web-client/wms/-web-client/general/
 generale&_dc=1421403958538&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3&REQUEST=GetProjectSettings'

the wrong part is: [...]/-web-client/[...] that is taken from dashpos.

With dashpos = -1, it works perfectly.

Can someone explain why is this daspos introduced?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Data-defined buttons for "en masse" size and
	rotation
Message-ID: <54B94A91.4050000@oslandia.com>

Hi all,

As an attempt  to "Improve GUI consistency & UX for data-defined style" 
(#9881) I'm planing to add a data-defined button[1] to the "en masse" 
size and rotation changing fields [2].

This could *replace* the scaling factor, scaling method and rotation 
available in the 'Advanced' menu.

After that a graphical assistant (accessible from the data-defined 
button) will be developed to help the user define the scale-function 
(preview the various symbol sizes).

I'd like to have your impression on that change, especially on the 
*replace*, and comment on the plan below.

Thanks,

V.

[1] QgsDataDefinedButton: the button already in the Label properties for 
data-defined properties.

[2] What I call the "en masse" size and rotation fields are the fields 
Size and Rotation displayed at the Marker level for simple symbol and 
the popup for size in the graduated, categorized and rule-based 
symbologies (I plan to add rotation there too).








Data defined property buttons will be added to the "en masse" change 
fields for single symbol, graduated, categorized and rule-based 
symbologies.

This is especially useful to be able to use scaling functions to define 
the size of the scaled symbols:
- Flannery (recommanded): scale_exp( variable, minValue, maxValue, 
minSize, maxSize, 0.57 )
- Area : scale_exp( variable, minValue, maxValue, minSize, maxSize, 0.5 )
- Linear : scale_linear( variable, minValue, maxValue, minSize, maxSize )

Using an expression at the "en masse" level will set expressions for all 
symbols composing the marker. The behavior will be the same as with size 
and rotation changing: the expression will be the one of the last symbol 
in the marker, others markers will be scaled/rotated relative to the 
last marker. For the size, if the scalling method is area, the scale 
factor will be put inside the sqrt(). If size/rotation are defined by 
expressions/fields, those definitions will be lost.

Definition: "en masse" expression pattern:
- Size with scale method Area
     - `sqrt( expression )` for the last symbol of the marker
     - `sqrt( symbolSize/lastSymbolOfTheMarkerSize * expression )` for 
other symbols
- Size with scale method Linear
     - `expression` for the last symbol of the marker
     - `(symbolSize/lastSymbolOfTheMarkerSize) * expression` for other 
symbols
- Rotation
     - `expression` for the last symbol of the marker,
     - `expression + (symbolRotation - lastSymbolOfTheMarkerRotation)` 
for other symbols

Disabling "en masse" will disable all size/rotation expressions for 
markers composing the symbol if they match the "en masse" expressions 
pattern.

Note that the data-defined expression at this "en masse" level will only 
be set (yellow highlight) if the size/scale expression of all the 
symbols composing the marker match the "en masse" expression pattern.

To avoid functionality duplication the scale and rotation could be 
removed from the 'Advanced menu'. This  will simplify the symbology 
classes. To ensure backward compatibilities of old project files, the 
following scaling/rotation expression can be defined using old 
scale/rotation parameters to ensure the same rendered map:
- For size
    - newSymbolSizeExpression = sqrt( oldScaleExpression * 
oldSymbolSizeOrSizeExpression )
    or
    - newSymbolSizeExpression = oldScaleExpression * 
oldSymbolSizeOrSizeExpression
- For rotation:
    - newSymbolRotationExpression = oldRotationExpression + 
oldSymbolRotationOrRotationExpression

As a result, if expressions are used for the symbol size/rotation in 
addition to scalling/rotation of the marker, the replaced expressions 
(with scale/rotation included) may not match the "en masse" expression 
pattern and the data defined button will not be highlighted. This seems 
to be a minor and rare inconvenience since it will happen for project 
with scaled/rotated markers composed of multiple symbols with different 
data-defined size/rotation.

Thank you for your thoughts and the detailed explanation! Maybe its
just me, but I'm having a hard time imagining everything described
without seeing some UI mockups. Would it be possible to show dialog
examples of what you are planning?

Hi,

I'm seeking some clarification on the decisions made during last
nights PSC. Specifically, it looks like it was agreed that LTR
releases would go ahead, but I'm unclear on:

- which release will become LTR?
- will 2.10 become 3.0 and allow API break?
- or if not, will the composer/layout API break be permitted for 2.10?

Cheers,
Nyall

Hi Nyall,

we have added the full log in this wiki page:

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/PSC_Meeting_16_January_2015

We stopped the meeting after 2 hours, and being half on the agenda.
There will be a new one the 25th of january.

To give you answer to your questions (other PSC members, please correct
me if I'm wrong):

- 2.8 will be next LTR
- no descision on 3.0 version taken yet
- I think(!) that slight api changes for composer-code is allowed as
somebody mentioned that that api is not so much used by plugins...
- IF you break api, you have to document it thoroughly in python
cookbook and api docs

if you ask me personally I would not make 2.10 a 3.0 version as to me it
looks better to have another 2.x version after a LTR as backporting
fixes will be much harder when we start breaking api immediately   after
a LTR.

PSC plz correct me if I'm wrong here somewhere.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Can this be added to the agenda for the follow up meeting please? To
clarify, it's not a small API change, it's a total rewrite. Think along the
lines of symbology v2, pal labeling or the new legend interface. The API
will have little resemblance to the current one.

Thanks! (And thanks to all the psc for your efforts running this project!)

As mentioned yesterday, I would rather not see "soft api breaks"
between minor releases because I think it's confusing and messy when
there could be clear rules that no api breaks are allowed between
minor releases. It's a question of how safe devs and users feel to
invest into developing tools for QGIS.

I agree and think that 2.12 could become 3.0 since there seems to be
some level of agreement that the February release should be the LTR
and conservative users might prefer a 3.2 LTR.

I assume this should be discussed and decided on 26th.

Best wishes,
Anita

If we are planning on doing a 3.0 I think it really needs to come with
Python 3 and Qt5 on all platforms (We can't have Python 2.7 and Python 3,
that is just going to lead to more pain I think).  This is going to break
all the plugins again, are we sure we can do that at this time?  If so we
need to be really prepared for it.

Can you estimate a realistic time plan for these switches to new Python and Qt?

Hi Anita!

I don't know how long it will take to integrate python3 but AFAIK Qt5
is almost prime time ready thanks to Matthias.
But we also have to consider that not every distribution comes with
Python3 .. Probably we should collect more information where problems
could occur.

But as summary.

+1 for calling it 3.0 once Python3 and Qt5 is ready.

regards
Werner

If I'm not wrong, support for Qt5 already added by Matthias.
Regarding Python 3, I'm not sure about time plan, as in this
case we depends on OSGeo4W update for Windows platform.

Would the switch to Python 3 mean that we would loose access to all
the useful Python modules which don't update?

Thanks for taking the time to try clarify the situation!

Hi!
Depending on the plugin there will surely be a lot of which will not
operate after an update to python3.
And depending on the developer they will be updated or abandoned.
Some will be easy to update - some will be harder to update.

But you are right - if the plugin will NOT be updated we would "loose"
it for python3.

Werner

Thanks Werner,
I was actually thinking of dependencies such as Numpy, Matplotlib, and
other Python packages and whether they will be available for Python 3.
Best wishes,
Anita

Oh - sorry - I did not think of that but:

Numpy Scipy
http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/faq.html#do-numpy-and-scipy-support-python-3-x

matplotlib
http://matplotlib.org/users/whats_new.html

I guess unless you use a _very_ specific module you are safe.

At least I could not find any module I use which is not available in python3

regards
Werner

Right, python 3 has been around long enough the much of the python world
has finally caught up. For those that can't get python 3 they'll just
need to use the last QGIS 2.x release a little longer (there are still
people running 1.8). Please file a ticket now with OSGeo4w to start
preparing to include it, since there will be a time when both python 2
and 3 will be installed side-by-side.

I'll suggest a Google Summer of Code proposal/call for student interns
in OSGeo ICA labs for a project on porting plugins to python 3, and/or
providing tools to plugin authors to help them port.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi all,

Sorry for the long mail but I think it is an important topic.

Increasing the major version number is a rather big step and should be
considered carefully. So before going into too many technical details
(no worries, you find them below) I think it is important to have a
clear idea why we would want that and what we expect from this move. In
order to avoid another troublesome major version change (QGIS 4) for as
long as possible.
Qt 5 and Python 3 are IMO mandatory changes when QGIS 3 comes but they
should not be the cause for it but rather dependencies of it.

I thought that it would be a good idea to use the QEP process to handle
this. We could create a label QGIS3 there which we could apply to QEPs
that will require QGIS3. And another QEP specifically for QGIS 3, that
lists other things to do (cleanup of deprecated API, Qt 5, Python 3...).

Some ideas what could be labelled with QGIS3:

 * Composer -> Layout
 * Database aware datasources (Make QGIS aware of
datasources(providers/tables) on the same database. That would allow to
better handle database dependent properties like foreign keys (which
involve multiple tables).
 * Abstraction of the .qgs file structure. Now it depends on XML. A new
project format including portable layers (memory saver) may use
something different. Or stick to XML.
 * Geometry redesign (It's a rather big rework, I guess there will be
some implications on the API leading to different behavior. I don't know
it in detail and the roadmap)
 * [Your idea goes here]

And now to the technical notes:
I think that both Qt 5 and Python 3 are ready to be used. They are
available for almost any platform and are can be considered stable. If
we switch the major version number in QGIS to 3, they should be made a
highly recommended dependency and developers should treat them as the
main target.

At least for Qt5 I can say that it is compatible to Qt4 to a very high
degree. I think also for python it is possible to write code that works
with python 2.7 and 3.x (The pandas module which is quite complex is
compatible with both). That means, it should be possible to make plugins
work independent of these versions.

There is one thing however that causes me some headaches which is PyQt5.
This must not be set equal with Qt5. It is possible to combine Qt5 with
PyQt4 (Read that again!) [1]. With this combination all the above
compatibility notes (should) apply.
Upgrading to PyQt5 however comes with some caveats. PyQt5 removes all
the deprecated things from Qt. That may affect some plugins. Even worse,
it forces python plugins to change their imports. Instead of "import
PyQt4" one will have to write "import PyQt5". Basically rendering all
plugins incompatible.

So we could consider to switch to Qt5 and keep PyQt4 and have an easy
transition. However, I hardly doubt that every platform will offer this
combination. Most distributions will probably do the obvious and bundle
PyQt4 linked against Qt4 and PyQt5 linked against Qt5.

This leaves us with the options:

 1. Include PyQt4 in our sources (you may deduce my stance to this from
the discussion here [2])
 2. Switch to PyQt5 and force all plugins to update

Version 2 would render all plugins subsequently incompatible with QGIS 2
what would probably disappoint many. So I thought that python may be
flexible enough  to offer aliases for modules (is it, python experts?).
So would it be possible to alias both - PyQt4 and PyQt5 - with PyQt?
That way plugins could be updated with an easy search-and-replace to
just import PyQt (and check for PyQt.version if required) and still have
them work with QGIS 2 and QGIS 3.

Regards,
Matthias

We have a import hook in place so it would be possible to have just import
PyQt and handle which version is imported on our side however this is a bit
magic and I'm not sure many people would like it. Stuff like this also
breaks tooling because there is no PyQt module so most auto complete will
not work. (I have tried this trick before to strip Qgs from the front of
all classes on the fly)

I'm not sure there is a really good solution to this without breaking
something or hacks. IMO using PyQt4 with Qt5 will just confuse people and
like you said most platforms might drop that.   Pro tip: This is a good
reason to never name your modules with the version at the end.

Agreed that adding magic to import PyQt4 or PyQt5 would not make things
better. Plugin developers still would need to be aware of that and couldn't
use new functionality from Qt5 anyway. QGIS 3 will supposedly introduce API
cleanup, so the plugins will need to be adjusted anyway (some more, some
less).

Message-ID: <94A10CD5-E562-4600-8AF6-D1722707D4DE@dimensionaledge.com>

Hi list
I?m missing the Grass plugin in the plugin manager.  I built QGIS2.6.1 from source on Centos - including assigning GRASS_PREFIX during ccmake28 process.
Source came from: wget http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-latest.tar.bz2
Is there additional QGIS-grass source code I must install, prior to configuring and making QGIS?
Grass64 and grass70 are both installed, and running OK.
Whilst other Linux distros may have the luxury of using apt-get to install latest QGIS and grass, the ELGIS repo is way out of date. 
Hence the need to build from source.

Any help with Grass integration much appreciated.

Thanks

Hi Mark,

Do you have Grass 6.4.4 or 6.4.5? Grass was recently updated to 6.4.5 on
grass repo, and the dependency of QGIS grass plugin is not satisfied.. I
downgrade to 6.4.4 and everything is ok again on Ubuntu.

Best regards,
Pedro

Message-ID: <CAJvUf_td_vH3bpWxuw8jd9EHsvMcg7B3x3BS64XA_1OuaK0Amg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello dear list.
I'm usually active on the postgis or postgres list,
but today I would like to ask a question regarding dev time.

In your opinion,
How much time would be needed to write a plugin for multiple versions of
qgis (2.2 to current 2.6) doing 3 simple things :
 - auto commit the edition of geometry when in edition mode (no need to
click on save  changes each time)
 - force refresh of rendering after edition of a geometry
 - every camera changes (zoom or position), send a sql query containing
user name and geometry of view (a rectangle in wkt for instance).

I can estimate this at my poor qgis-dev level, but I would like to have the
timing for an expert qgis dev.

Many thanks,

Remi-C

Hi Roberto,

I installed zope.interface-3.6.7.win-amd64-py2.7.exe, because there is no
version 3.6.0 for Python 2.7, but it keeps showing "No module named
zope.interface".

I've also tried to copy to the Python folder within OSGeo4W, but without
success.

Can this be an incompatibility of versions >3.6.0?

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro

There is no reason really - it was just an omission when I was adding the
file. Recently Jurgen has fixed that in master branch.

Hi Remi

Such plugin should be quite easy to write - I would assume up to one day of
work for an experienced pyqgis developer. For a newcomer it may take few
more days to get familiar with the API, tools, environment and so on.

For the refresh of rendering after geometry editing - that should work out
of the box and I would consider it a bug if it does not.

Regards
Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Mapserver - automatic project reloading after
 change is not working on NFS
Message-ID: <54BCDEDE.4040206@gmail.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,
Automatic reloading of QGIS project file is not working, if project file is
located on NFS or other network file system.

Reloading is implemented in 'src/server/qgsconfigcache.cpp' by
&mFileSystemWatcher which is using QFileSystemWatcher. The reason of this
behavior is, that QFileSystemWatcher depends on 'inotify' feature of Linux
kernel, which is not (and can't be) implemented in NFS.

Before trying to fix it by myself, I would like to ask others, for example
people from QGIS Cloud, how are you solving this problem without server
process restarting ?

I am thinking about adding some version variable to all QWS requests, which
will can be used by web application to request reloading of project file.

Thank you.

I think a more global solution is possible.
After all when you load a postgis layer in qgis, if somebody else changes
it, the view is not refreshed, which is annoying (and sometimes dangerous
because you may edit old data).

It would be easy to ad this (which would also work for my case) using the
LISTEN / NOTIFY feature of postgres.

Basically when selecting a table as a new qgis layer, you automatically add
a triger to it.
The trigger will be fired at any change (create/delete/update).
The trigger would simply send a message to qgis via NOTIFY.
example : "NOTIFY qgis_change_XXXX ;", where XXXX is a unique id.
Of course qgis would be listening, which is very simple in python
(import psycopg2;
conn = psycopg.connect(my_database_string)
conn.autocommit(1)
curs = conn.cursor()
curs.execute("LISTEN qgis_change_XXXX;"))

Of course one would need a mechanism to remove this trigger when not
necessary (for instance, name the channel "qgis_change_*time_stamp*",
delete channel too old automatically, and change channel periodically (20
in for instance)).

I don't know if from a security point of view it would be possibe tough
(would require the permission to create a trigger).
I don't know if typical qgis user have the right to create trigger on
database they use.

I use a lot of different version of QGIS and I can guarantee at least a
dozen crash a day with version 1.8 to 2.3,
plus pending transaction with postgis whenever the crash occurs.
I'm installing 2.6 to see if postgis layers are less fragile right now ^^

Hi Remi,

Regarding crashes with Postgis: do you have multithreading with a lot of 
CPU cores active? I am experiencing crashes if more than 2 cores are 
active. Try limiting to 2 CPU cores and see if this helps.

Still trying to investigate this issue with the devs.

Besides the above issue, editing with Postgis works stable for me - 
certainly not as many crashes as you say you have.

Please do not ignore the crashes but try to report them so that the devs 
can do something about it.

Hi Andreas,

I do not think that multi-core rendering is the issue here as Remi 
mentions to have experienced crashes since QGIS 1.8.

Remi,
I am using QGIS with Postgres/PostGIS with some dozens of users on a 
central database _without_ any issues in QGIS (except the multi-core 
issue Andreas mentioned). So do share your problems together with 
relevent parts of your data base so they can beanalyzed.

I also have a lot of experience with a large number of users (around 15)
editing a central database with PostGIS. No problems there.

Remi, the development time for this would be around a day. If you wish to
outsource that job, I have some experience with QGIS Plugins and I could
develop that for you.

Message-ID: <CAMMN2u06VxVJxaxDZD-nixARCaaNp4tH7WZc3yBrCE0rFZkTpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I made some test with the new Save styles function and I noticed that the
possibility to lock the styles in the map composer doesn't work.

Shouldn't the new "lock layer styles for map item" button "freeze" the
style for the current map composition? If I change the style in QGIS the
style is not locked in the composer.

Am I missing something?

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Matteo

I hae just realized that it was possible to lock layer styles even if
layers are not locked (the checkbox above). I have just pushed a small fix
for that. Anyway, if you make sure that "lock layers for map item" is
checked before locking layer styles, it should work.

Cheers
Martin

Hi,

I'd like to remind everyone that the 2.7 development cycle ends friday
(2015-01-23), we'll go into feature freeze and start the 2.8 release cycle in
which we'll do testing, bugfixing, translating and release preparations instead
of feature development for the 2.8 release.

Please merge your new features before 2014-01-23 and prepare to start testing.
The 2.8 release will be on 2015-02-20 (31 days away).

Hi,

I have drafted a QEP [0] for the introduction of a new authentication
configuration system that is protected with a master password, and its
associated pull request [1], which includes a fully functional
implementation with bindings, unit tests and test server (Tomcat/GeoServer).

Direct link to QEP preview: [2].

Please test if you have the available time. Note the new dependency on QCA
(and its OpenSSL plugin), which will need built and installed first.
Contact me if you need help with that, as I have built QCA 2.1.0 on all
major platforms.

Note: I am looking for another core developer willing to review the code in
exchange for *payment*. Please contact me directly if you are interested.

That sounds like a good idea. You mentioned that Flannery will be the
recommended function. What's your reasoning behind that?
Concerning the area scale function, I'm always wondering if it assumes
square or circle area.

The name "Continuous size assistant" seems a little difficult to
understand. I probably wouldn't know what to expect of such a tool
without giving it a test run. Maybe the context menu entry could
simply be "Configure data-defined size".

Will it be possible to select different percentiles?

> "en masse"

Concerning the term "en masse" itself, I also wonder if it's the most
easily to understand term. Maybe we could be talking about the "master
size" and "master rotation" but probably some native speaker could
suggest a clear and simple name for this feature.

Best wishes
Anita

Hi Anita, 
I was not sure on first message of Vincent, but now I'm sure, I'm the funder
of such features ;-). I did not spoil that work before, because that took us
a loooong time to validate the contract. We should have make it for 2.8 at
start.. 2.10 will be the goal. 
Discussion with community is more than welcome of course!

What we need is :
- use data defined widget used in labeling windows in symbology screens.
This will be more consistent and was discussed previously on the list. I
found some money for that, hope community still agrees

- add graduated classification for size, with same classification options as
for current renderer. This will be possible to set both color graduated
legend and size varying legend that way, with legend enabled. 

- add a GUI assistant to help users define expressions for continuous size
varying expressions. We currently have that in "advanced fields", which
appears to be confusing to users here. We would like to plug that assistant
with "label" expressions widgets.  We only propose squaretail (= circle
surface or exp 0.5), linear and flannery  (exp 0.57) at start. If you know
other interesting functions, feel free to submit.
Flannery gives good results and is considered as better classification
method by some cartographers. No objection to keep circle surface as default
instead if you have other references. This topic needs precise mockups
because it's not easy to understand interactions of datadefined tools on
symbol / marker level from a UX point of view. 

- when using the GUI assistant or the graduated classification, we will
enable a legend for mapcanvas and composer 's legend. That legend will be of
this type  [0]

- we will also add test and documentation in english and french in qgis
documentation. 

Please tell us how that sounds to you. 

Cheers, 
R?gis

Hi Larry, very interesting QEP!

I'm not an expert of authentification systems at all. Here, I would love to
have QGIS be able to auto identify itself using Windows session user
information. That's what we do with internal webapps with Firefox.  Please
consider also use cases for system administrator that configure all qgis
profiles. How can we achieve that without having users take care of master
keywords? 

Cheers
R?gis

That would not prevent devs from importing PyQt4 or PyQt5. It will only
offer the possibility to write portable code. If somebody does not want
this he can go ahead and directly import PyQt5 and use all the new features.

If you are running linux, there should be no path to select, that's
normal. It looks like it finds no saga in your system, maybe it is
making a wrong call when trying to find out the installed version.

I assume you have SAGA installed and in your PATH...

Hi All

@nyall - just referring back to your original part of this thread - could
you please describe for us your preferred scenario with regards to Composer
-> Layout refactor and how it would relate to a LTR? For example would you
rather see it in the LTR or happen after the LTR etc?

Thanks

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Creating a new QgsComposerHtml from Python causes
	segmentation fault
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=yukt5GYHRJCyN2H3fKMGWq_+2uMGjoD6u126piz_HPGg@mail.gmail.com>

The QgsComposerHtml class behaves bad from Python.
When a new QgsComposerHtml is instantiated I get a segmentation fault and
QGIS crashes.
Something wrong happens even when one tries to obtain an existing object
from a composition:

mycomp.getComposerItemById('myhtml') -> QgsComposerFrame instance

I don't understand how a QgsComposerFrame is returned given that
QgsComposerHtml is not related to this class. It derives from
QgsComposerMultiFrame, and in case it can contains frame objects...

It happens both on 2.6 and master, both on Linux and Windows.

I've opened an issue: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12009

Hi,

When we call getComposerItemById, it will return QgsComposerItem, which can
be many things: QgsComposerLabel, QgsComposerLegend, QgsComposerFrame,
QgsComposerPicture, etc. In case of the item is html frame, it will return
QgsComposerFrame. Unlike other items that you can get the component
directly, to get the QgsComposerHTML itself you should do:

html_item = mycomp.getComposerItemById('myhtml')
composer_html = mycomp.getComposerHtmlByItem(html_item)

Regards

Note that getComposerHtmlByItem is deprecated and will be removed at
some stage. I'll implement a better solution to this issue.

Hi Victor,
sorry, my mistake, sorry for the noise. However, now running saga throws
an error.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Matteo,

I thing the problem is that "GROUP BY" is not supported on shapefile 
format.

Many thanks for all the answers !
The new version (2.6) is way more stable than 2.3 regarding postgis table.
I'll do some torture test and submit tickets if I find any problem.

Um, is ID the only column?  Otherwise I'd expect that it needs to be
(as it would be undefined what to return for the other columns):

select id from au where id > 100 group by ID

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem when using spatial index
Message-ID: <002a01d0348c$9390f1c0$bab2d540$@spaceyes3d.com>

Hi all,

 

I load a shapefile, then I create a spatial index to maximize speed of zoom
and navigate in the map.

The problem is: when I zoom to any area feature appear and other doesn't.

And it seems To me that the spatial index is automatically created even when
I delete the .qix file

 

 

Best regards,

Nejia

Hi R?mi,

Good to hear. Note that 2.3 was the dev version and not the stable 
version. 2.4  was stable, then 2.6, 2.8, etc.

Hi J?rgen,
yes, the column is ID.
BTW, if I import the shapefile in SpatiaLite (or PostGIS) through DB
Manager the same query works and I can easily load the file in QGIS.

Maybe GROUP BY function is not supported in Processing yet?

Thanks

Matteo

Meaning that ID is the only column in au?  Did you try to use ID instead of *?

Well, I don't really know processing, but it looks more like an error from OGR.  

Anyway, my observation was just about the SQL.  You usually don't use * with
GROUP BY, because you can only select columns that appear in the GROUP BY and
can only use other in aggregate functions (min, max, sum...).

Maybe you can use: select distinct id from au

Hi Larry,

Sorry - I can't comment on a technical level.

But as a user I very much welcome such a safe password/connection 
storage combined with a password manager. I bothered me a lot to see 
passwords when hovering a layer in the layer manager, and to see the 
plain text connection info in the .qgs file. I know, there are 
workarounds (e.g. .pgpass), but most users are not aware about it.

Thank you for already considering QGIS server to correctly deal with the 
authentication, where there is no user input.

Andreas

it fails before, when it imports the raster with io_gdal

it is supposed to pass a "0" argument to io_gdal to say you want ot
import a raster, but apparently in SAGA 2.1.4 (at least under Linux)
using it causes an error.

cheers

Just seeing this topic. OGR SQL does not support GROUP BY (as non-documented 
in http://gdal.org/ogr_sql.html ;-)). You have to use the SQLite dialect for 
that ( http://gdal.org/ogr_sql_sqlite.html ).

e.g. :
ogrinfo poly.shp -sql "select * from poly group by eas_id" -dialect sqlite

Message-ID: <54BE2D6C.3050104@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I just want to share the outcome of my, probably rather obscure, work on
the management of Python plugins.
We currently have a shorter than ever queue:
* 7 unapproved plugins
* of these, 3 are deprecated
* one (inasafe) is pending publication, upon request from the author
* one (tile map scale) is queued just because of possible legal issues
of older versions (new ones are clean)
* one (data reloader) appears abandoned; unclear whether still useful
* one misses info, probably will be fixed soon
* all new plugins, and almost all old ones, have proper repos and
bugtrackers.
Overall, I'm pretty satisfied, even though with more time we could do
more thorough code checks etc., but it's nice not to leave new
contributors waiting for long before publication.
All the best.

No problem. Actually, that "None" version shouldn't appear, i ahve
added a small fix to improve that version detection

The error you are getting seems to be caused by SAGA believing that a
layer is already exported, so it is not calling the export routines
before calling the algorithm itself. I had seen this before, and I
have now added a fix for it.

All this changes are applied in this commit

Hope this helps

Paolo, Giovanni

I don't see the calls to io_gdal in the error trace, so i think it's
not being called.

In case it is not shown in the text that is pasted, and it is calling
it but failing, then the problem might be what Giovanni is mentioning

Actually, for 2.1.4, the SAGA connector uses the same syntax as for
2.1.3, but there might be some changes and that might be causing the
error.

I am not having this problem in my Windows machine, but in Linux we
have seen before that the io_gdal module changes it syntax depending
on the available driver (something that is a really bad thing...but
there's nothing we can do with that)

Hi Victor,
I tested also under Window, from the command line (no Processing
involved, but of course affected) and SAGA 2.1.4 io_gdal also fails
when

saga_cmd io_gdal 0 -TRANSFORM...

while

saga_cmd io_gdal -TRANSFORM...


works


cheers

Good to know.
I faced this postgis issue since 1.8
It would be a tremendous improve to have it solved in 2.6 (checking)

True, I was confusing versions. The "normal" syntax does not work with 2.1.4.

This is weird, because you need to indicate the algorithm to use...so
without that 0 it shouldn't work. Another one of this annoying SAGA
mysteries....

I will fix that call to gdal_io. Other modules, however, seems to
accept the algorithm index/name correctly. I tried the export passing
the algorithm name instead of 0, and it also fails

Thanks for your help!

BTW, did anyone find SAGA 2.1.4 to be extremely slow?. It takes a lot
of time to launch SAGA before it starts doing the actual computing,
there is a huge overhead. With several calls per Processing algorithm,
the time it takes to run is rather long...

I'll post a mockup as soon as I get out of the ground work (adding "en 
masse" expression for size and rotation).

I don't understand what you mean by different percentiles. Can you 
explain it a bit to me so I can put it in :)

I looked it up an it appears to be a french expression that is used in 
english. But as a french native I'm certainly not the best judge for 
that. A native speaker advice will be welcome.

BTW do we have any guide regarding such issues? It seems that another
plugin, namely QuickMapServices also has legal issues. Maybe it should
be unapprowed too.

not that I know of, and frankly I do not think we have the resources to
do a legal analysis.
IMHO the responsibility should be left to the individual developer.

Using my GeoCoding[1] plugin with Google's geocoding API also doesn't
respect TOS, but you can still use it with nominatim (OSM) geocoder.

Other geocoding plugins probably suffer from the same issue.

Hi!

Basically I don't care about having plugins with "legal issues".
The only question for me is, is QGIS as a Project liable for serving
this plugins in the official repository?

If we (as Project) can say: "We are not responsible for any legality
issues our hosted plugins may cause" I am ok with hosting them all :)
The question with  howto check every plugin for such issues is
secondary - I guess we already have some online ..

just my 2?
regards
Werner

Hi all,

 

I load a shapefile, then I create a spatial index to maximize speed of zoom
and navigate in the map.

The problem is: when I zoom to any area feature appear and other doesn?t.

And it seems To me that the spatial index is automatically created even when
I delete the .qix file

 

 

Best regards,

Nejia

this from happening.
Once we gain knowledge of such a situation, I think that we are obliged
to remove these from the repository as we cannot promote TOS conflicts
as a project.

There would of course still be an option to have
 * somebody set up a private repository providing the problematic plugins
 * deliver the plugins without problematic services (e.g. google)
configured and give information to the user about how he can add these
manually.

These two options would take the QGIS project out of the line and hand
the responsibility to the user.

We could still introduce a "legal note" like proposed by Werner and add
a "if you spot a legal problem with this plugin please send a note to
the plugin author and the repository manager.".

I'm not a layer, but if we have a legal problem, then the following
websites have the same problem (just an example):

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy
https://github.com/geopy/geopy
https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/python-geopy

To break the TOS it's enough to run the following (or a similar) command:

$ GET 'https://www.google.it/maps/vt/pb=!1m5!1m4!1i6!2i67!3i46!4i128!2m1!1e1!3m9!2sit!3sit!5e1105!12m1!1e4!12m1!1e47!12m1!1e3!4e0'

Additionally, a common internet browser such as firefox or chrome is
capable to download a single tile and this will break Google TOS.

I might be wrong but I don't feel that publishing a tool which is
theoretically capable to break the TOS is like effectively doing it.

Hi all,
is SPIT plugin still functional? Still useful?
AFAIK its main advantage is the possibility of importing multiple files
(but a Processing module is now available for this), and speed.
IMHO this is a good time to evaluate whether we want to drop some parts.
All the best.

Hi Joseph

If you just want to highlight a particular feature, you do not need to use
the identify tool. The following code will load a feature and highlight it
in canvas. It should work if you try it in QGIS python console.

l = iface.activeLayer()   # your layer
fid = 10   # your feature id

from PyQt4.QtCore import Qt
from qgis.gui import *
f = l.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest(fid)).next()
r = QgsRubberBand(iface.mapCanvas())
r.setColor(Qt.red)
r.setToGeometry(f.geometry(), l)
r.show()

If your layer is a polygon layer (instead of line layer), add second
argument to QgsRubberBand with value QGis.Polygon

Cheers
Martin

Wasn't there a plan to use some good connection to Google (they use
QGIS themselves after all) to finally get an official OK for the
OpenLayers plugin use case?

If we do not have more direct contacts, we could ask ujaval, author of a
plugin, and working at google.
who could take the lead on this? maybe Gary?

Hi,

One lead is Ed Parsons: http://www.edparsons.com/ He was a keynote 
speaker at our Graphical Web conference: 
http://www.graphicalweb.org/2014/#presentation_42 - as far as I know he 
also attended Foss4G in Portland.

However, in my opinion, we should first establish the QGIS association 
to have a body that can negotiate with Google. Google was sponsoring our 
conference multiple times in the past - however, you need to fill out 
paper work. And for this you need to be a legal entity.

I would also recommend to first establish other contacts with Google 
before you ask them if you can legally access their tiles (which I am 
pretty sure they wouldn't allow anyway - because they did contracts with 
geodata providing companies which would disallow such use). A large 
share of Googles geodata was bought from other companies - and for this 
reason they cannot provide all of their data in the open. Like it or not.

Establishing a legal entity should really be a top priority of the PSC.

Andreas

Informal contacts are always good.

But I wouldn't start to establish contacts with Google based on a legal 
issue. Imagine if you were a Google employee and QGIS would get in 
contact with you for the first time, and the first question is if QGIS 
could use their geodata tiles - which is more a question to Google 
lawyers - it would probably piss you off.

I would start getting into contact with them and ask for sponsoring for 
a hackfest. This, you probably could do even before we are a legal 
entity. Then for proper sponsoring, we really need this legal entity. Or 
you could also ask them if they would host an upcoming hackfest at one 
of their offices/campuses.

But this whole thing should be better discussed on the PSC list - it is 
not so much a dev issue.

Hi,

As I said on the user list ( thread : "Import (not so) large data into a
remote postgis database" ), SPIT has the advantage of showing a progress
bar.
This is a good feature when uploading data through a slow connection (my
case these days).

But I think it would make sense to move this feature (the progress bar) to
the DB manager.
I tried to do it [1], and it kind of works sometimes, but there's some UI
refreshing issues, and I won't time to investigate much more these days...

Maybe we should also think about making the import more efficient and
robust. I'm currently working with a slow connection, and uploading a table
of around 4000 lines takes ages (around 2 hours).
I don't really understand what the bottleneck is, but the transfer rate is
way under the transfer rate I'd have if I uploaded a dump file and ran it
online.
All more efficient ways (pg_dump, ogr2ogr, pgdump,...) are not suited for
non power users...

Bests,

Olivier

Neither do I. As long as it is not promoting TOS abuse actively (e.g. by
being shipped with such a configuration) I doubt that we are in trouble.
But I am not a lawyer neither.

Hi,

since we have this

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1674

I really think that SPIT can be dismissed.

This new tool is much faster than any other option available in QGIS,
and it has a lot of options. And of course it can be run in batch
mode.

cheers

I'm thinking of functionality similar to raster renderers where the
user can chose to load the min/max raster values, a certain percentile
e.g. 2% and 98% or based on standard deviations. Similar could be
offered to load values from an attribute column.

I like the idea. As mentioned, I think we should strive to pick the
most easily understandable name for the menu entry for this assistant.

This will certainly be a nice addition. Will it work with all kinds of

Heh didn't know about this !! Great news, I'll try ASAP !

Actually I didn't see it because it wasn't displaying in my processing
toolbox, since I had an old processing plugin installed (v 2.2) that was
hiding the newer one which is now shipped with QGIS.
Shouldn't we remove the old processing plugin from the repo ? (or at least
set it's max version to the version where Processing was included in QGIS ?)

Thanks !!

Olivier

I've come to the conclusion that the way to proceed is:

If either 2.10 or 2.12 become QGIS 3.0, then target the layout engine
work for 3.0. This includes removal of all existing composer API.

If QGIS 3.0 is scheduled for > 2.12, then the layout engine will land
in parallel to the existing composer implementation. Composer will be
deprecated but untouched, and users can manually switch from composer
-> layout engine via a combo box in QGIS settings. Default will be to
use composer engine to avoid breaks. Obviously, if they choose to make
the switch then existing plugins will break for them! When QGIS 3.0
lands the composer classes will all be removed.

Hope that helps clarify the situation!

Can you expound upon how this info is accessed, what exactly is used, and
how it would be used? Then, an authentication config and provider can
possibly be crafted.

If you are configuring QGIS prior to users using the app, then all the auth
configs and assigning them to server connections can be automated with
pre-population scripts utilizing either a standard initial master password
or a randomly generated one for each user. Then, the user must 'reset'
(change) the auth database with a new password, which duplicates the auth
database and re-encrypts all configs with the new password (optionally
backing up the current db).

If the auth configs are to be added to an existing user's setup (one that
already has a master password and configs in ~/.qgis2/qgis-auth.db), then
the user must input their password during the process, or the admin needs
to know it, so a pre-population script can utilize it.

I have already crafted two pre-population scripts, one with user
interaction and one without, and have started on a script that exports
client SSL certs/keys out of Firefox and sets up auth configs in QGIS
(though QGIS doesn't have a certificate manager yet, so they are certs/key
files on disk). I will ask my employer about releasing these scripts.

Basically, the master password does cause difficulties with regards to
automating rollouts of profiles, etc. However, without it, there is really
no other form (that I could figure out) of protecting the auth configs'
sensitive data, given how completely open and accessible Qt, PyQGIS and the
available source code make everything.

The auth system is in its infancy though, so any opinions, improvements or
sharing of rollout strategies is greatly appreciated.

Hi,
I've gone through the recommended process 
(http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html)

I had a problem with Grass, but set "with grass" in ccmake to "No" and that solved that (for now).

After firing up QGIS, I get the dreaded "Couldn't load PyQGIS" error.
My Python is installed from the default ubuntu 14.10 repository, and is presumably the wrong version for QGIS 2.7.0 Master.

Is this a python version issue, and which version (from where) do I need?
I did my anonymous git check out a week ago - could this also be part of the issue?

Thanks in advance,
Zoltan.

Hi,

 

Do you think that this problem is often caused by geometry problems?

 

Thanks,

Nejia

Hi,

Nejia, what about the validity of the geometry of your features? You can check with the tool in Vector menu > Geometry tools > check geometry validity

Hi all,

 

I load a shapefile, then I create a spatial index to maximize speed of zoom and navigate in the map.

The problem is: when I zoom to any area feature appear and other doesn?t.

And it seems To me that the spatial index is automatically created even when I delete the .qix file

 

 

Best regards,

Nejia

Could you help me to understand what distinguishes a normal QGIS release
and an LTR? In other sw the LTR (LTS) guarantees long term maintanance,
backporting fixes, etc. but in the QGIS lifecycle a release is fixed, so
what's the difference for the end user between 2.6 and 2.8? Maybe that it's

Yes and also that we will back port fixes for a year to that release vs
only for the current release.  The QEP will have more details.

Hi Giovanni,

The idea is to invest more in bugfixing and bugfix releases for the LTR 
release. If a major problem in 2.8 LTR is found and 2.10 is already out, 
there would still be another bug fix release for 2.8 LTR. LTR is for one 
year of support in bug fixing.

QGIS PSC and QGIS-CH may also decide to invest more money into bug 
fixing of a LTR release.

Thanks Nyall and Andreas,
I missed the point that an LTR can have updated releases, i.e. 2.8 download
links can be updated until February 2016, right?

yes, we could have a 2.8.35 if necessary (/me hiding for Jurgen now...),
next to 2.10.

the main idea is to have a release for users, for example from
universities or governmental organizations, in which it is more
difficult to ask for an upgrade every couple of months, OR who invested
in documentation/learning material with screenshots and tasks which are
maybe version dependent.

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <CAPkWpvdwZ5Eq-yvzzLa10+Ohm8YegcaaBJyZyFnWJSW37cqHrA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I would like to draw your attention on new features Arnaud Morvan has
developed for processing :

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1753
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1759

You can find features description on pull requests pages

We feel both PR carry interesting enhancements and new functionnalities for
processing.

We would greatly appreciate if they could be merged before feature freeze.
If necessary, we would of course do all requested improvements afterwards.

Could you please confirm if you think it is OK for merging ?

Many thanks and kind regards to the QGIS dev team !

Some users [1] have already encountered this issue and i understood that it
may be related to non correspondance between the number of rows in the .dbf
file and number of geometry (some rows had no geometry). A simple "Save
As.." to another shapefile has solved the problem.

Hi all,

 

I load a shapefile, then I create a spatial index to maximize speed of zoom and navigate in the map.

The problem is: when I zoom to any area feature appear and other doesn?t.

And it seems To me that the spatial index is automatically created even when I delete the .qix file

should be almost ready to merge, the other one might need a bit more

Hi,

I don't know what is your opinion, but perhaps the best solution would be
to make a fork of SAGA within QGIS, so could standardize the version for
all platforms and for all users. Otherwise it is impossible to create
multiplatform Processing Models... Since QGIS has this quick releases
cycle, it was a question of updating SAGA to the latest version, in each
new QGIS version.

In my case (Ubuntu 12.04), SAGA tools does not appear, because I have SAGA
2.1.1 installed from ubuntugis-unstable, which is no longer supported in
QGIS Master:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/b0291985ac16a1f2809979257ffc12d84004e897

 supportedVersions = {"2.1.2": ("2.1.2", SagaAlgorithm212),
                                 "2.1.3": ("2.1.3", SagaAlgorithm213),
                                 "2.1.4": ("2.1.3", SagaAlgorithm214)}

This way will emerge a problem, since in ubuntugis-unstable, SAGA has only
been updated for versions of Ubuntu 14.XX (the rest have 2.1.1 or earlier).
When QGIS 2.8 will be released, it will arise many complaints because the
SAGA disappears. I'm pretty sure that most users of ubuntu-like-systems use
ubuntugis-unstable to install these packages and dependencies.

What do you think?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

The  problem appears with vector layers that contain geometries that containing duplicate node(s), it?s considered as an invalid geometry ?

When I select all features from the bounding box of the vector layer, lines of features that has a null geometry are not selected in the attribute table (I don?t have a problem with this shapefile).

I as a user have a lot of trouble with SAGA every while end then,  
especially like you mentioned with models I built to run on Win and Linux  
Mint/Ubuntu.
Even though I have an updated Linux Mint 17.1 = Ubuntu 14.04 with  
ubuntu-unstable, SAGA only works partially. Seems like most vector related  
function still work, but all raster related functions fail, so my models  
are working only under Windows now.

There might be other reasons for that than only SAGA, but for the average  
Linux user, this is hard to solve.
So any ideas how to make the integration of SAGA more stable would be much  
appreciated.

Just my 2 cents
Bernd

IMHO the best option would be to cooperate more tightly with SAGA devs,
so that changes are know before they are added to new release, and
Processing is updated accordingly.
Of course, automatic testing and support for more developer time would
greatly improve the current situation.
All the best, and thanks for your interest.

Thanks for the explanations Larry. 
I hope having technical infos on what we use here for authentification soon. 

Having the scripts, or some snippets would help. We already use python /
bash / powershell scripts to manage user profiles (deploy new settings,
check settings, migrate profile content when moving ressources. ) .
One question:  If pre-population scripts are using final password, is there
a way not to have the user resets its password? The idea is to have a
totally user transparent process. 
Cheers
R?gis

On Windows that should already work - Qt handles it internally (4.8 does, 4.7
didn't, but was patched in OSGeo4W to do it).

I know that it is used to automate system proxy authentication.  I don't know
if it's also used for authentication with services, but IIRC that should
also be covered.

Hi all,
how can I run Processing models from python console?
It seems that processing.alghelp("modeler:my_model") is empty and I cannot
specify my layers and parameters?

Am I missing something?

Thanks

Hi all,
it seems that the help parameters (name, version, ....) of the various
models disappear after saving the models.

Saving the model should also save the help right?

Confirmed here, it does not work.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Couldn't load PyQGIS error after compile
Message-ID: <54BFD01D.7030707@geograph.co.za>

Hi,
I've gone through the recommended process 
(http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html)

I had a problem with Grass, but set "with grass" in ccmake to "No" and that solved that (for now).

After firing up QGIS, I get the dreaded "Couldn't load PyQGIS" error.
My Python is installed from the default ubuntu 14.10 repository, and is presumably the wrong version for QGIS 2.7.0 Master.

Is this a python version issue, and which version (from where) do I need?
I did my anonymous git check out a week ago - could this also be part of the issue?

Thanks in advance,
Zoltan.

HI Jurgen, 
When you say it is covered already by Qt, what does that mean to achieve use
cases like autocredentials for postgis layers or WMS layers for instance? 
We still need the current QEP or am I missing something? (I 'm absolutly
outside of my skill circle)

Cheers
R?gis

I only meant for HTTP(S) services.  For databases that's probably also
something lower level that needs to be and probably is already addressed in the
clients (libpq, OCI etc).   I didn't have to explore that yet.

	on Ubuntu 14.04
Message-ID: <BLU437-SMTP43583ED680D2D8186E037FA7480@phx.gbl>

Dear list,

i'm trying to use SAGA natural neighbour via QGIS toolbox but it's not 
working,
the tool opens the config dialog but when i run it i get
this errors:

Oooops! The following output layers could not be open

  * Grid: /tmp/processing/c62751a9186c4e0694e956b2bf65fda0/USERGRID.tif

The above files could not be opened, which probably indicates that they 
were not correctly produced by the executed algorithm

Checking the log information might help you see why those layers were 
not created as expected

This algorithm requires SAGA to be run. A test to check if SAGA is 
correctly installed and configured in your system has been performed, 
with the following result:

SAGA seems to be correctly installed and configured



and on "OGR" QGIS log:

error 4: Unable to open 
/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/processing/tests/data/polygons.shp or 
/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/processing/tests/data/polygons.SHP.

2015-01-21T19:58:47 1 Data source is invalid ()

2015-01-21T20:08:20 1 Data source is invalid ()


are SAGA tools supposed to work or is there some known problem?


P.S. the very same tool works on windows with osgeo4w install

Thanks, Roy.

it is a feature for models to be not exposed to runalg?

But if I understand your second sentence, you have a shapefile containing some rows without geometry. Right? So, what do u mean by "I don't have a problem with this file"? Is it another file or the file on which you're creating the spatial index? 
You should :

- or delete from your current project the file with empty geometry (if it's not the one you're creating spatial index on)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Virtual geom column
Message-ID: <54C0F828.9070902@carto.net>

Hi,

Now that we have virtual columns in QGIS, I wonder if we could improve 
this towards virtual geom columns. Often, there is point (x/y, lat/lon) 
data in some non-GIS database and you only have read-only access. Rather 
than copying this data to some other database/format it would be nice 
being able to visualize the data on-the-fly.

How complicated would it be to introduce such a virtual geom column in a 
future QGIS version?

Thanks,
Andreas

Greetings,

Earlier this week, I ran into the need to do a temporary join between two
datasets that would have relied on a virtual column. It however seems that
QGIS is unable to do so as the virtual colum did not appear in the list of
available columns to use to establish a join.

Is that a known limitation or an implementation issue?

Hi Regis,

Here is a PR for one element of this feature 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1853

It's only the ground work, so you have no GUI to help you setup the 
expression for the size & rotation, but you can use scale_exp and 
scale_linear to define your value range and the corresponding symbol 
size range. It works for line width too. The legend's symbol does 
dissapear though, but I believe it's due to the data defined size. I'll 
work on the legend to have something meaningful when using size expressions.

If you can recompile the branch and give feedback, it will be welcome.

+ 1 for this feature, if possible.
Perhaps it would be necessary to define the excepted geometry type so that
QGIS knows in advance the geometry type.

Hi all.

I'm doing a course, and we found several potential issues, some of them
related:

* openlayers export: if a layer has a transparency in QGIS, the exported
page has black polygons instead of transparent ones
* the opacity control of qgis2leaf does not seem to work.

More generally, the three plugins do a very similar job, but have
different interfaces, and different behaviour, e.g. one shows a preview,
two open an external browser directly, others not, two allow to save the
result to a specified layer, etc.
It would be very good if the interfaces and the behaviour would be
unified, for maximum ease of users. I do not mean to change much in the
plugin itself, just cosmetic stuff.
Perhaps even better if the three could be unified (and possibly brought
to core), but that requires obviously much more effort.
I'm available for help if useful.

All the best.

I am discussing with the author of the qgis2leaflet plugin about the
possibility of merging our plugins into a single one. Adding threejs
as well would be great, and i am sure we would get more testing and
feedback if its was a single plugin (and eventually maybe become a
core one)

I am open to discuss all these ideas with anyone who wants to collaborate

Thanks Paolo for opening the dicussion.

Hi,
I recompiled qgis with the changes made by Victor but the help of the
models are not saved.

Anyone confirms or am I missing something?

Changes where not made to solve that. I have actually seen the issue a
couple of times, but most if the tests i did today, it worked fine, so
i cannot see why it is that it fails sometimes.

I will keep on working on it.

Hi all,

What is the intention behind QgsVectorDataProvider::attributeIndexes() ?

It is used in very few places. It returns a list of integers ... and if
I am correct will always return a list [0 ... n-1] if n is the number of
fields. I don't really get the point ...

Was there something else planned initially ? Something related to
(database) indexes ?

Hi,
sorry for the noise but I have SAGA installed in my debian system (and it
works as standalone) but I cannot see it in Processing.
Should I do something in particular?

Thanks

Hi Matteo,

which version of SAGA do you have? Processing provider was
updated recently and some old SAGA versions are not supported
yet. It should work with SAGA 2.1.2 and 2.1.3

I think that may arise a problem here, because ubuntugis-unstable [0]
just have SAGA > 2.1.1 for ubuntu versions 14.XX, and most users of
ubuntu-like-systems use ubuntugis-unstable to install these packages
and dependencies.

How can we get around this issue?

Pedro

Hi all,

+1000 for this merge

Ren?-Luc and I have also created a very simple (unpublished) plugin as a
proof of concept to export pseudo mercator tiles from the project layers,
very similar to QTiles plugin, but with a simple but usefull addition :
Tiles are first saved in a mbtiles database, then exported to a simple
architecture similar to TMS but with no duplicates in tiles. For example, a
completely blue tile from the ocean will be stored only once. A JSON file
stores the correspondance between zoom / x and y and each png.
We have a simple but usefull leaflet tilelayer definition which can use
this particular format, thanks to the plugin "Functionnal tilelayer" (
https://github.com/ismyrnow/Leaflet.functionaltilelayer )

So no revolution here, no real new concept, but a very simple way to export
QGIS rendering to a format which can be used offline with any HTML browser,
which means it is usable with Iphone, android, etc.

I think we could add this kind of tiles export feature to the "merged"
plugin.

Anyway, let's gather people around to contribute !

definitely a great addition. I think that any plugin or script that
exports a qgis project to another format (so it uses QGIS as a front
end for easily setting up layers, symbology, etc), can fit in here. We
can create a small framework and then plug converters into it, so they
use a similar interface (with basic common parameters such as the list
of layers to include) and some custom inputs for each converter.

Good to see that people like the idea :-)

Probably just the opposite.  The attributes used to be kept in a map and not an
array and attributeIndexes returned the keys.

Hi, 
FYI there is an on going work funded by French Ministry of ecology to
explore feasability of such features, using underlying sqlite capabilities.
Maybe the concerned contractant could give us an update status of thsi work?
This is also related to adding SQL capabilities discussed here between
Matthias and Hugo.

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Wierd issue with Python and triggerRepaint()
Message-ID: <54C17F26.4010702@geoapt.com>

I have a plugin that makes modifications to a memory layer, then calls 
triggerRepaint() to refresh. Unfortunately, it doesn't refresh the 
layer. If I open the Python console before making the mods, it works 
from the console:

lyr = iface.activeLayer()
lyr.triggerRepaint()

If I turn off caching in Settings, I don't have a problem with my plugin.

You rendering experts have any ideas?

Thanks,

It's in master now, and i don't know if we will release an update,
since there will be a QGIS update rather soon

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS slow on startup - Tests conclusions and
	questions
Message-ID: <1422009933813-5183332.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
I have been facing slowness of QGIS startup process on windows citrix
servers here, with no clue for months on what explained that phenomenon. I
faced first startup of 2 minutes,sometimes 15 minutes when servers where
loaded. Second startup takes generally 40 seconds. 

After 2 days of intensive testing and process monitoring, it's time to share
conclusions and see if QGIS community can do something to speed up things:

Conclusions on all platforms normal startup time seems mainly slowed down by
plugin loading:
- OSGEO4w package with grass, qgis, and some libs (numpy, scipy..) has more
than 9000 python files. On each startup, they get recompiled, which is a
consuming task and slow. Processing already packages only pyc files.  I
tested dropping all py files in OSGEO4W with success. 

- Could we drop all QGIS python sources in binaries, and suggest OSGEO4w to
do the same? We would save a good bunch of seconds on startup and distribute
ligther packages that way. Opinions? 

I also saw that it is possible to optimize compilation process to compile
pyo files and not pyc. No idea how much that can improve loading time, that
may be worth a try.

Conclusion only for Windows relative to first startup time :

-Windows gets a caching mecanism called cold/warm startup . see [0]
Microsoft provides optimization tips :
   - make a splashscreen ! we have that, but that sounds like a joke giving
this as first tip !
   - make less I/O on startup. I'm sure we can clean up things a bit. 
Process monitor shows lots of unnecessary file reading attempts (checks
several path for QGIS2.ini, even after successfull reading, check for python
files in parent dir of actual python file, QGIS.ini I/O on each new
action..) 
   - optimize module loading.. it's worth checking what's actually loaded. 
   - Defer initialization operations. Again, .ini seems stressed a lot in
whole startup process, I think we can do better. Caching ini? 
   - .Net apps have other tricks (ngen disk images) that are not applicable
to us.. 

Searching google for "QT cold startup" shows that we are not alone with that
issue. I'm unfortunatly not able to understand all that stuff. Hope it
helps.

For a short description:

With the new parameter type for geometry predicates, the user can choose 
precisely the spatial relation to use in these algorithms :
     Select by location
     Extract by location
     Join attributes by location

With the new fields mapper algorithm, you can completetly reformat layer 
fields with a friendly user interface.
In combination with existing modeler, it becomes relatively easy to 
create full formatted data export models.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [ANNOUNCE] 2.7 feature freeze begun
Message-ID: <20150123130104.GA24995@norbit.de>

Hi,

I'd like to remind everyone that the 2.7 development cycle ended at 12:00
UTC. We are now in feature freeze on the road to the 2.8 release on 2015-02-20
http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20150220T12&year=2015&month=02&day=20&hour=12&min=0&sec=0&msg=2.8%20Release
(27 days away; see also roadmap
<http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index#road-map.html>).

Now *we*, *the community*, need to prepare QGIS for release. No new features
will be added anymore. *Users*, if not already begun, should now start
extensive testing of master and report bugs on the hub <http://hub.qgis.org>.
*Developers* should move their focus from creating new features to fixing bugs.
*Translators* can can continue their work (we maintain all our translations on
transifex now).

The nightly builds of QGIS testing available for Windows
<http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#windows>, Linux (Debian
<http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#id3> and Ubuntu
<http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#qgis-testing>) and Mac
OS <http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#id13> are now
effectively snapshots of what's going to be released.  Except of course for the
bugs that are going to be fixed until release day.  For Windows there will also
be weekly release candidates of the standalone installer
<http://www.qgis.org/downloads/weekly/>.

Lets keep up working together to make 2.8 another great release.


J?rgen

We made a qgis web client edition that provides editing features (points
and lines) using the known openlayers API methods then we made a backend
written in python that made sql commands to our postgres database.

You can use the WFS-T API with some web-clients like OpenLayers to 
provide edition through QGIS-Server.

?Thanks for your input! We will discuss 3.0 scheduling in the next PSC. For
me it makes logical sense to do the LTR and then immediately move over to
3.0, but lets see how others feel at the meeting. I really hope we can
avoid parallel implementations.

Hi all,

I think that the first step is to merge the "2D export" plugins.
Micha?l's plugin would be a great addition, because it's a way to use
all the great styling capability from QGIS.
I started helping Victor with the "Export to OL3" plugin and I will be
happy to contribute to the merging process.

Ciao!

Message-ID: <CAES-DZT+Tu-fQfbC2kKOTK1NXKkuPpOM-TGiA7aDbDF=0DTjAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Can anyone help withthe correct procedure for installing older versions on
debian Jessie from package?

root at 6b2c81edac61:/# apt-get install qgis=2.4.0-1+b1
qgis-providers=2.4.0-1+b1 qgis-common=2.4.0-1
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 qgis-providers : Depends: qgis-providers-common (= 2.4.0-1) but
2.6.1.1+jessie1 is to be installed
W: Ignoring Provides line with DepCompareOp for package
php-psr-log-implementation
W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.



It would be nice to have the historical versions available for install
given that with various things changing over releases, it is nice to be
able to replicate a known good configuration for a given software
architecture.

Regards

Tim

Hi everyone,

Is it possible to proceed to the PR merging ?

That would be great to have them for next release.

Kind regards,

Which version of QGIS is that?

In QGIS < 2.4 you had to explicitly call lyr.clearCacheImage() if the
caching was turned on - otherwise the renderer would still use the cached
image stored in the layer's instance. Since 2.4 that is not necessary
anymore and triggerRepaint() should also clear renderer's cached layer
image.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Cutting lines with a polygon boundary
Message-ID: <54C5D71D.1020209@geograph.co.za>

Hi Dev,
I put the request for help out on qgis-user and to my surprise, no one 
came up with direct solution.
This suggests that a "crop" feature is missing, so maybe it could be put 
in as a low priority feature request?
The thread is still active, so you can see the replies from Andre Joost 
and Randal Hale there.

Thanks & regards,
Zoltan.

*qgis-user thread started 25th Jan at 14h51 (GMT+2):*

    Hi,
    I'm battling finding an easy way to cut some lines with a polygon
    boundary, and then deleting the line portions that are OUTSIDE the
    polygon.

    Scenario:

        4 separate SHAPE files with lines in them
        1 shapefile with one polygon in it.

    I need to cut the lines in all 4 shapefiles at the point that their
    lines intersect the polygon boundary. Thereafter I want to delete
    the line portions that are outside of this polygon boundary. In
    other words, to be able to crop multiple layers according to some
    polygon boundary.

    I would have thought this to be a trivial issue, but I have tried:

          * Vector Geometry Processing Clip, but it wants to extract the
            data inside the polygon and create a new file with the
            extracted data. (To be expected)
          * Plugin 'Clipper': I select my lonely polygon, and then
            activate one of the line layers (which is also in edit mode).
            The plugin seems to do nothing when I choose 'intersection'
            or 'clipping' preview, and when I choose 'clip' it tells me
            to select at least one feature (but my polygon is still
            selected.) The home-page link comes up as '404 not found'
          * Didn't notice anything in the Advanced Digitizing plugin.
          * CadTools and CadDigitize - no relevant facility found, but
            really nice 'Help' doc - thanks guys!
          * Feature 'Cut with Polygon from another Layer' deletes the
            pieces I want to keep.
          * Feature: 'Split selected features with line from another
            layer' is to some extent what I want, but I want '... with
            polygon from another layer'

    So, I eventually gave up and converted my polygon into a line layer,
    and used 'Split selected features with line from another layer', but
    this is incredibly tedious because:

      * It only does one layer at a time
      * I then have to select the line segments that I want to delete.


    So, does anyone know of a way to efficiently cut features in
    multiple layers using a polygon, and then to be able to select the
    pieces (multiple layers) that are either inside or outside the
    polygon, and then delete them?

    Regards & thanks in advance,
    Zoltan

Right, and that worked fine for me at 2.4.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Possible bug with select in a rectangle
Message-ID: <54C5E7E0.3060905@geograph.co.za>

Hi Guys,
I tried to go to QGIS issue tracking, but was told that the "site was 
under heavy load", so haven't checked if this is a known issue.

Platform is Ubuntu 14.10 with self-compiled QGIS 1614ac8.

Scenario:
I have a shape file with some 700K points, and a raster image covering 
about 10 of these points.
I want to delete all except these 10 points.

Try #1

    I select my 10 points, open the attribute table and click invert
    selection.
    I then click the red bin (delete selected) and wait (I left it going
    overnight)
    The next morning I killed the task and when I re-opened the point
    file, my 10 points were deleted and the rest were still there.
    Clue: I might have clicked delete selected before the 'invert
    selection' had finished. This would be due to the fact that I may
    not have seen (if any) indication that the invert selection task had
    completed.

Try #2

    I zoom to the extents of the point file, turn off rendering of the
    point file, turn on editing in the point file.
    I then select (invisible) features from this point file in a large
    rectangle above my visible raster image.
    After a few second I get no indication that anything is selected,
    and the 'delete selected' icon remains grey.
    I turn on rendering for the point shape file, and those that were in
    my rectangle are rendered in yellow (ie: 'selected')
    I open the attribute table and the 'delete selected' icon IS red,
    and I can move my selection to the top.
    I then delete the selection from the attribute table as the icon on
    the toolbar is still not 'available'.
    After 10 minutes or more, I get tired of waiting and kill the job.

Try #3

    I re-open the point file, leave rendering on, select the same points
    as in try #2 above, and click 'delete selected'.
    After 2-3 minutes or so, the selected points are deleted as expected.

So, I've raised a few issues here, but they seem to be centred on the 
attribute table being open.

Regards,
Zoltan

Hi Luca,
many thanks for this. As a starting point, I think the plugins could be
merged into one simply by having them as different tabs in the same
dialog. From there, one could progressively integrate functions,
starting from the buttons Save as, Preview, Open in external browser, etc.
All the best.

IMHO this should aim at being included in core, as son as it raches
production quality.

Yes, I am currently working on the "virtual layer" provider we were
talking about here some time ago.
It is first developed as a c++ plugin (even if the development may lead
to some pull requests).

This is still under development. But I have a very first implementation
where a vector layer can be used in a Spatialite database.

Adding geometry support to virtual *fields* is another solution. I guess
it would need to state what type is used by expressions to describe
geometries (WKT ? WKB ?).
It may be easier to have than a full virtual layer implementation (which
also offers other possibilities, spatial joins for instance)

Thanks, Riccardo, for bringing this discussion to my attention. I think we
need to proceed with caution, considering the following issues:

1. Bigger is not always better - specialized tools often yield better
results than big ones with every option under the sun bloating the code and
confusing the GUI.

2. How much common ground is there? Leaflet and OL3 are very different
beasts, and I would only want to merge if we thought there was sufficient
common functionality to merit merging.

3. There is much still to be achieved in qgis2leaf, and I wouldn't want to
slow this down by diverting development effort into what would be a massive
job.

However, other issues are also relevant:

1. qgis2leaf was written by Riccardo, and then added to by me, among others.
I hope Riccardo would not be offended when I say that neither of us is an
experienced Python programmer. Riccardo's observation that qgis2leaf has
grown organically is 100% correct. The code desperately needs rewriting.
NathanW looked at this early on, partially rewriting the plugin back at
around 0.7 in good Python, but Nathan was unable to finish that exercise,
and we were never able to incorporate this work.

2. There are features of the OL3 plugin which would benefit qgis2leaf
massively, specifically the GUI. At the moment, qgis2leaf's GUI does not
support any per-layer options, while the OL3 plugin does. Porting this
functionality over to qgis2leaf would be a massive improvement.

3. The focus needs to remain webmaps, not other formats. That is what
qgis2leaf and the OL3 plugin are there to create. We should not drift toward
a generic format export tool.

I quite like the initial idea of an initial "simple" merge, putting each
plugin in is own tab. We would then want to abstract the common elements to
a shared default tab, and then spin the Leaflet-/OL3-specific options into
their own tabs.

Don't get me wrong - this is exactly what Riccardo and I have been hoping
for - more developer involvement in qgis2leaf. If a merged plugin can be
carried out well, great. If not, then we should at least work towards
standardizing as much operation between the individual plugins as possible.

What do others think?

Thanks

Tom

Hi all.
Just fouond a couple of interesting style sets:
https://github.com/mixedbredie/QGIS-styles
https://github.com/QGIS-UK/Styles
I seriously think we should add some style set to master. These might
not be the best example, as they seem to be strictly dependent on the
specific data, but you got the idea.
Some screenshots, perhaps worth to share:

The official source for Ordnance Survey SLDs is here:

http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/help-and-support/products/styled-layer-descriptors.html

Their licence
(http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/licences/stylesheet-licence-v2.pdf)
contains the following:

"You may only license a Stylesheet from Ordnance Survey under Clause 2.1 if
you are part to an [sic] Data Agreement"

I would be wary of getting caught up in Ordnance Survey licensing, but other
will know more than me.

If you read the whole license it isn't that scary (IANAL) - you have to
have clicked through a license to get the OS data anyway and then you can
do what you like (ish) with the style sheets.

Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A28056B525B0E@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

I have downloaded the lastest QGIS 2.7.0-4 weekly release (26-Jan-2015 05:02) for Windows x64 and after installing (and uninstalling my previous weekly edition) I cannot start QGIS due to:

qgis-dev-bin.exe - System Error
The program can't start because qwt5.dll is missing from your computer. Try installing the program to fix this problem.

For QGIS 2.6.1 the qwt5.dll is located inside the \bin folder but its missing from the folder created by the weekly release installer.

Since I haven't changed the way I install the weekly releases, my guess is that something might have changed in the building process?

Dependency fixed in OSGeo4W (pointed to qwt-libs-qt4, which is new in 32bit,
while on 64bit it's still qwt5-libs-qt4).

The broken standalone was renamed.

Message-ID: <CAMB2qw28C1Bt_4fMmAWwddU3_BjsgZh53_HO--w9vJ5zS9=90A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

in never qgis web client versions, the requests to QGIS Server are
converted from GET to POST if the URL length is > 2048 (as stated in
GlobalOptions.js).

The problem is one and is, for we, big:

if you use the URL rewriting for i.e.

  http:/test/qgiserver/project

(project points to  our   /opt/projects/project.qgs)

then in the POST GetMap requests, the parameter <map> is missing and
thus QGIS Server cannot know which map file to open.

Is there any way to fix this?

Hi Luca,

Sorry - I am not a GET/POST specialist - so I can't help here.

You may - however - try to raise the URL length limit. There hardly any 
old browsers around there any more who still have this limit. I think 
IE9 was affected - but these days there are hardly any IE9 around 
anymore. Most have been upgraded to IE10 and IE11.

Maybe in the US there are more IE die hards, but in Europe most people 
have moved to more powerful browser alternative.

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Exact print composing
Message-ID: <54C79C42.6040909@geograph.co.za>

Hi,
Is there a way to set exact print composer sizes and map positions?

I have set a composer canvas size of 460mm by 275mm, and an area of 
interest (made up of one cropped raster and 12 cropped vector maps) that 
is exactly that size, at 1:500 scale.
Adding this to print composer canvas using a mouse is not exactly 
accurate. I've searched plugins, but noticed nothing useful.

Does print composer by any chance create a text file that I can hack to 
achieve this?

Regards,
Zoltan

Hi Zoltan,

Every object in the print composer can be positioned/scaled with exact 
numbers - have a look at the "Position and Size" group of every items 
properties. This has been around since ages (at least since version 1.7).

Alternatively/in addition you can also use snappable grids and guidelines.

Hope this helps?

Exactly what I want - This is only the second time I'm needing to use 
the composer, and the first time I only needed a dump print, so didn't 
bother to fiddle with the options.
This time, when I added the map to the composer and saw it was wonky, I 
deleted it and started looking for plugins before noticing the "Item 
Properties" tab.

Big thanks,
Zoltan

Hi Zoltan,

Once you exactly positioned elements - you may want to lock them, so 
they don't get moved accidentally. With the new item list that Nyall 
introduced recently you can easily lock/unlock elements from this item list.

Hi Luca

In 'Sourcepole QGIS Enterprise', we solved this problem by modifying the 
server to read the map-parameter from GET and the other parameters from 
POST. I can port this to master branch.

	fixing for QGIS releases
Message-ID: <CAES-DZTBJ7WVO0HkUeA2AZQ0k9Ndgs1KOjJyZaiSO2-snRuQ1A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Developer Community

QGIS 2.8 is drawing close and we would like to use some of our QGIS funds
to pay two core developers for one week each. In the past we have simply
appointed two developers. However we would like to be more open about the
appointment process and invite any suitably qualified developer to place
their name in the register of developers we select from when we do bug
fixing.

The process will work as follows:

1) If you are a QGIS core developer (or have a strong track record of
contributions to the QGIS project) and would like to be eligible to do bug
fixing work, let the PSC know, along with your day rate in euros (which we
will keep confidential) and we will (subject to PSC approval) add your name
to the roster of developers who can be employed to do paid bug fixing.
Approval will be based on the PSC being satisfied that you have the skills
to carry out bug fixing work.

2) In the run up to each release, the PSC will determine what budget we
have available and approach one or more of the developers on our roster to
see if they are available for paid bug fixing. Selection will be made based
on skills of the developer and the critical areas in QGIS that need bug
fixing.

We will also welcome third parties to sponsor additional days of developer
time and will make available the names and rates of the developers on the
list for this purpose.

Thus if you are a core developer and are interested in participating in the
programme, may I ask you to please send an email to the PSC mailing list
indicating your availability?

Thanks very much

on behalf of the QGIS PSC

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Attribute table of a layer in Composer - QGIS
	2.6.x and Master
Message-ID: <CAMCJChtHExTLD=rSJ5JxDVtB+yuisYyrM=bqZOw6UXj19r3PSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was struggling to add the attribute table of a layer in Composer.

Initially, only the header appears:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5772257/qgis/composer_tabela_atributos.avi

Using an old project with several Composers containing attribute
tables, the table appears well, even on the Master. But if you try to
add the attribute table in version 2.6.x or Master, only appears the
header.

Only today I became aware of this situation, precisely because I have
used attribute tables in Composers created in earlier QGIS versions
(<= 2.4).

In fact, it is sufficient to stretch the table (with the grips) to the
lines start appearing.

The question now is, this can be considered bug or feature?
I've been checking, and up to version 2.4, the window size of
attribute table was directly associated with the Maximum Rows option.
In 2.6.0, 2.6.1 and Master, it has no relation to the Maximum Rows,
because it was introduced the new option Frames -> Resize mode (which
allows to continue the table into a new Composer page). What seems to
me that can lead to some confusion is the fact that does not appear
any row in the table, apart from the header, when you add the item.

What do you think?


Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Hi Marco,

what happens if the parameter is present in both query string (GET) and POST?

Is there a priority?

Hi Tim,

I'm a bit confused about the process - if we reply to the PSC list,
then the rate will be public. Should we just send you a direct email
instead?

?Hmm true - just send to me its fine. The list of devs and their rates is a
private (to the PSC) doc.

Ill send an update to the list clarifying - thanks for the feedback!

?Ok I was on list already above :-) Just one more thing to add is that we
will be publishing our financial records as a matter of public record
annually and so your rates will not be completely obfuscated - all though
the budget will be presented in aggregate (e.g. 1234 Euro for paid bug
fixing)? so it would be difficult to identify the rates of a particular
developer. Anyone else interested in being registered as a paid bug fixer
please contact me or any other PSC member directly.

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Best practice for a new Vector Data Provider
Message-ID: <b52a56388c504de7aa6f6901b6bc2d3e@svm-mail2013.norkart.no>

Hi everybody,

I am currently trying to make a new vector data provider with a source select dialog for QGIS so that QGIS can read and display data stored in a custom format. The format in question proprietary to software developed and maintained by the company I work at. I am quite new to developing for QGIS and I am struggling to find the best approach to do this. I hope that somebody out there can help me. I have not been able to find any internet resources on best practices for a data provider plugin.

So far, I have succeeded in creating a very simple vector data provider plugin and accessing it through a source select dialog (which I have added to the src/ui/-folder). This is, of course, not a suitable approach as it would mean that I have to build and deploy my own version of QGIS instead of a plugin. As far as I have understood it, there might be 3 possible approaches for me to make a new provider with a source select dialog:

1)     An ordinary C++ plugin for the source select dialog containing the provider. Is this possible? I have tried this and so far not succeeded.

2)     A provider plugin containing all necessary ui. Is this possible? And if so, how can I add a menu-item to activate the source select dialog?

3)     A provider plugin without ui and a separate plugin with the source select dialog.

A fourth option would be to create a plugin for OGR. This is, however, not a good solution for me because I would run a high risk of data conversion errors. Our format is much more similar to the QGIS internal geodata model than to the OGR geodata model.

I am developing on the Windows platform, using Visual Studio 2010. Primarily I want to create a C++-plugin since the API for our proprietary format is written in C++, and because my daily development environment has no support for Python.

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

Best regards,

Not particularly, just in case there is a conflict.

It should never happen but it's important to know what happens in that case.

Message-ID: <FB166E95-5A1E-4005-8D78-AAD61E635F8F@nd.gov>

Hi Everyone,

I'm developing a python plugin, and I've had a report that the Qdialog button box (Ok/Close) isn't showing on Gnome3.  I'm developing using OSX and have no idea how to troubleshoot this.  Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Hei Sverre,

Did you consider writing a GDAL/OGR driver for your format, which then could be used by QGIS for accessing it?
That way it could also be used in / accessed by other OSGeo tools?

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Best practice for a new Vector Data Provider

Hi everybody,

I am currently trying to make a new vector data provider with a source select dialog for QGIS so that QGIS can read and display data stored in a custom format. The format in question proprietary to software developed and maintained by the company I work at. I am quite new to developing for QGIS and I am struggling to find the best approach to do this. I hope that somebody out there can help me. I have not been able to find any internet resources on best practices for a data provider plugin.

So far, I have succeeded in creating a very simple vector data provider plugin and accessing it through a source select dialog (which I have added to the src/ui/-folder). This is, of course, not a suitable approach as it would mean that I have to build and deploy my own version of QGIS instead of a plugin. As far as I have understood it, there might be 3 possible approaches for me to make a new provider with a source select dialog:

1)     An ordinary C++ plugin for the source select dialog containing the provider. Is this possible? I have tried this and so far not succeeded.

2)     A provider plugin containing all necessary ui. Is this possible? And if so, how can I add a menu-item to activate the source select dialog?

3)     A provider plugin without ui and a separate plugin with the source select dialog.

A fourth option would be to create a plugin for OGR. This is, however, not a good solution for me because I would run a high risk of data conversion errors. Our format is much more similar to the QGIS internal geodata model than to the OGR geodata model.

I am developing on the Windows platform, using Visual Studio 2010. Primarily I want to create a C++-plugin since the API for our proprietary format is written in C++, and because my daily development environment has no support for Python.

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

Best regards,

Hi Gary

I cannot replicate your problem (tried 2.6 and master). I have attached a
very simple test plugin that first creates an layer and then adds a feature
on a click of a button. With the triggerRepaint() call the canvas is
refreshed correctly (when caching is enabled on or not). Let me know if
that code works for you - maybe your problem is somewhere else or it is
more complex.

Cheers

Your example works fine---must be something else going on in my code. 
I'll have to dig deeper.

Thanks for taking the time to put together an example!

UTSL.  You can browse through all provider in QGIS and look for one that is
close to what you need.

I don't think that will work.  QGIS divides plugins into "ordinary" plugins and
providers.

That's the approach most providers (meanwhile) take.  You can export an entry
point "registerGui" that will be invoked with the application as argument.
With that pointer to you can lookup UI elements in the applicat0on and create
an insert new items you create.   Core providers usually don't use
this and there UI is hardwired in the application - some using the
"selectWidget" entry point.

That used to be the normal approach, when providers weren't supposed to link
the gui library.  As that changed I'd go for 2).

Are you aware that you have to put QGIS providers and plugins under GPL?  That
means you have to make source code available to anyone you ship binaries to.

That doesn't apply to GDAL/OGR drivers.

Hi Nyall,

we created an email group now: psc at qgis.org

so you will be able to sent it to all members of the psc in on go.

please only use it for this kind of stuff, because as a general rule of
thumb most community information should be public.

Hi Stefan,


Yes, we have considered the OGR/GDAL driver. Currently we believe that implementing a QGIS provider is the best approach for us, because the gap between our own model and the QGIS model is much less than the gap between our own model and the OGR model.



That being said, we have not yet decided on a solution and tomorrow we might think differently.  Being able to access/use our data files in other OSGeo tools as well is definitely a very strong argument.

Thank you very much for your reply. I will then go forward with approach nr 2).

Of course ;-) It's just that the source code doesn't really tell me what's best practice, it just gives me the options. Also I find it easier to understand architecture, requirements, and so on if I can compare the source code to "ordinary" documentation.

This point is definitely an interesting one. Together with Stefans point about using other OSGeo tools with the OGR/GDAL driver, we will have to seriously reconsider if the OGR/GDAL approach might be the best option for us after all.

I don't think that will work.  QGIS divides plugins into "ordinary" plugins and providers.

That's the approach most providers (meanwhile) take.  You can export an entry point "registerGui" that will be invoked with the application as argument.
With that pointer to you can lookup UI elements in the applicat0on and create
an insert new items you create.   Core providers usually don't use
this and there UI is hardwired in the application - some using the "selectWidget" entry point.

That used to be the normal approach, when providers weren't supposed to link the gui library.  As that changed I'd go for 2).

Are you aware that you have to put QGIS providers and plugins under GPL?  That means you have to make source code available to anyone you ship binaries to.

That doesn't apply to GDAL/OGR drivers.

True... but if used in a QGIS context, the obligations of the GPL license  
also normally apply to code linked with QGIS, so in the end the obligation to 
make source code available when shipping binaries would also apply. But we're 
not going to enter a debate on licensing issues...

I would also suggest implementing OGR driver for your data format. If you
decide to implement a c++ provider for QGIS, you may end up with some
challenges. Provider for a proprietary data format is not likely to be
accepted to QGIS source tree. That implies you would need to compile and
ship the provider by yourself. The binary compatibility between QGIS
releases is not guaranteed - that means you would need to compile the
provider for all supported releases and for all supported platforms (at
least win32 and win64).

Often a good option is to just have custom Python plugin in QGIS for
loading/handling of a specific OGR driver where simple file chooser dialog
is not enough.

Btw. I don't see many differences between QGIS geodata model and OGR
geodata model - in fact the one in QGIS is meant to be similar to the one
of OGR.

Martin

Hi Matthias,

I don't think the plugin is available on the QGIS plugin repository yet.  It's called Drainage Channel Builder.  Although I believe you can access it from our local repository here:

 http://www.swc.nd.gov/plugins/qgis.xml

if you want to take a look.

Thanks,

Mitch

Hi all.
We have an old e-shop selling (now obsolete) t-shirt and other stuff.
I have now deactivated, because nobody was managing it since a long
time, and the logos were badly outdated.
We would be glad of opening it again, and advertising it on our website.
Of course we could also close it entirely, in case there are better
alternatives.
For this we need a volunteer; we do not expect this would involve a
significant amount of work, but since it involves real money, it must be
conducted reliably, and most of us are already overstretched on unpaid
QGIS work.
So if someone is willing to volunteer, please show up.
Thanks in advance.

?Just a note that your plugin bundle includes an additional ?folder
'_MACOSX' which you probably don't want to have there.

I was able to open your plugin'd dialog ok under Gnome 3.12 on Fedora. I
would also suggest:

* using a QScrollBox for your dialog - the dialog is very tall
* breaking up your dialog into tabs
* using a QButtonBox at the bottom of the dialog to standardise the button
arrangement

Great to see the work you are doing on making this plugin!

Tim

Message-ID: <38f7c37373b749a8af20856ce069920c@NINSRV23.nina.no>

Dear all,

I was trying to export the attribute table of a set of PostGIS layers from QGIS to CSV.
The tables contain a column "ID" (which was the original id) and a column "id" added during import to PostGIS, and a PostGIS "date" column.

I tried four different approaches for exporting the attribute table to CSV (copy and paste, mmqgis, Quick Export, and "Save as" CSV), in QGIS 2.6.1 none of them worked as expected:

-        Copy and paste of the content of the attribute table worked fine for a layer with ca. 1800 features, but in the PostGIS layer with more than 12000 records only the heading was copied/pasted

-        mmqgis exported the "date" fields as text, "Qt.*date*(YYYY, MM, DD)", which is not very convenient because it requires search and replace after export

-        Quick Export crashed with a Python error

-        "Save as" complained about the fact that there already is a column named ID, so OGR was not able to name the feature ID that way in the output... ("Error: creation of field ID failed (OGR error: Attempt to create field ID, but a field with this name already exists.)", and I was not able to provide the -preserve_fid option which might have helped here)

Are some of these known issues or is it just my data and me?
At the end I used mmqgis, but for newbees this procedure (and the number of non-working options) might appear a bit cumbersum...

Kind regards
Stefan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] feature freeze exception
Message-ID: <54CB33DF.5050701@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I would like to ask for a feature freeze exception for PR #1870 Allow 
"order features by value" for relation reference widget [0].

I have been developping for quite some time a data model and QGIS module 
for managing a water network in QGIS.
The module is about to be distributed to some real-life testers and this 
feature is required. These testers will use a stable release and not the 
master.

The code is quite simple, has been done by an experienced developer 
(Matthias Kuhn), and if community agrees on this exception, Matthias 
will provide a test in a short delay.

Somehow, this could be also considered as a bugfix, since it's quite a 
problem not to be able to order elements in a combobox.

Please let me know what you think, so a decision can be made in a 
reasonable time frame.
I am sorry for the inconvenience.

Best wishes,

Denis

Sure it is. IMHO this should be implemented in DB Manager; it should be
rather easy.

Hi,

I would also support including this as part of an exception - as we will 
also need this for our waste-water system we are developing.

Hei Paolo,

Sounds good. Generally, it would be a significant improvement if the "Export function" in DB manager could allow other formats than shape. Here I think esp. of SQLite-ish formats for example, since shape is limited to 2GB and column names will probably have to be truncated and so on...

Regarding CSV-export however, I would expect that at least "copy and paste" and "Save as" is something users may frequently try (as it is probably also most natural to do so). So these functions should not fail easily or be dependent on data source (of course millions of records do not necessarily fit into memory in case of copy/paste), what do you think?
Is the OGR ID trouble a GDAL/OGR issue, or would it help if QGIS would provide the -preserve_fid option?
Do you want me to open ticket(s), also for the plugin issues never the less? BTW, I could not find the bug tracker for mmqgis, the links in the QGIS plugin homepage only lead to the plugin home page, which does not seem to have a bug tracker...

Cheers
Stefan

exactly - probably good to open a ticket, if not already

copy-paste, as you noted, is fragile, and I would not particularly
encourage its use. Save as... however should work.

AFAIK it's a GDAL issue - perhaps you could check if ogr2ogr works for
you, and open the ticket where appropriate? (gdal or qgis)

This is a long standing problem. I'm gradually trying to convince new
plugin authors to add a code repo and a bugtracker; for older plugins,
we have to ask. Perhaps a direct email to the author could help.

All the best, and thanks for raising the issue.

I tested one of my qgis project with qgis master (yesterday evening) and I get 
this error for all layer: Cannot calculate extent. Is it a bug qgis side or

Thank you very much for your feedback. These issues are very strong arguments for creating an OGR plugin, indeed.

A fourth option would be to create a plugin for OGR. This is, however, not a good solution for me because I would run a high risk of data conversion errors. Our format is much more similar to the QGIS internal geodata model than to the OGR geodata model.


I would also suggest implementing OGR driver for your data format. If you decide to implement a c++ provider for QGIS, you may end up with some challenges. Provider for a proprietary data format is not likely to be accepted to QGIS source tree. That implies you would need to compile and ship the provider by yourself. The binary compatibility between QGIS releases is not guaranteed - that means you would need to compile the provider for all supported releases and for all supported platforms (at least win32 and win64).

Often a good option is to just have custom Python plugin in QGIS for loading/handling of a specific OGR driver where simple file chooser dialog is not enough.

Btw. I don't see many differences between QGIS geodata model and OGR geodata model - in fact the one in QGIS is meant to be similar to the one of OGR.

Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [2.6] QGIS-server: failed to show one layer
	rules-based styling
Message-ID: <1622617.SfrFMJftZu@tatras>

Hello,

I am testing QGIS server 2.6 for one of my QGIS project with a lot of layer. 
We are requesting layer via WMS service. There is, however, one layer not 
working properly (well not at all). This layer has 9 rules for styling which 
seems create the problem.

If I use a single class or graduated/continue classes, I can see my layer. The 
rules have this scheme:
* group 1 (one filter and no style)
  - class 1 : filter + style
  - class 2 : filter + style
  - class 3 : filter + style
* group 2 (one filter and no style)
  - class 1 : filter + style
  - class 2 : filter + style
  - class 3 : filter + style

Does rules-based styling could be a problem for QGIS-server?

Thanks,

Y.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Options - CRS for new layers bug
Message-ID: <CACUFmXv+_EnJeU+P_ZAGtpuZMqeJ4mquok9JXGLds6E07tvZBw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've tracked down the bug reported at https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11889,
tested against commit fe27b63.

When creating new layer, QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem instance is created
and initialized from QSettings option "/Projections/layerDefaultCrs" with
default value for fallback.  The problem is, that value is set in
/src/app/qgsoptions.cpp:1198 always from LayerDefaultCombo - labeled as
"Use a default CRS". You can verify easily - select some CRS in that combo,
select "Use project CRS" radio button, set different CRS for project, and
create new shapefile layer - it will use value from disabled "Use a default
CRS" combo.

I believe setting /Projections/layerDefaultCrs should be handled in the
block of code before - between lines 1185 and 1196 - from correct combo
according to selected radio. I will be able to make a PR on GitHub, but I
am not sure what value to set when prompt option is chosen - maybe
GEO_EPSG_CRS_AUTHID or project CRS? I am quite new in this codebase, can
anyone offer a feedback on this to me?

Reported bug is also affecting creation of new layers of all types
(SpatialLite, Scratch) and will be solved as well, because the CRS
initialization pattern is the same.

Looking forward to your opinions,
Juraj Komacka

After reinstalling 1.4.0 and using an old copy of the project file the 
error persists. You broke my QGIS installation apparently.

Ok, reverted to TM 1.2 and all is good. AG, any thoughts on how to make 
my project and data compatible with TM 1.4.x?

fixed 4h ago

https://github.com/anitagraser/TimeManager/issues/94

I imagine it will be available in the next release of the plugin...
Would be good to test master code to help developer.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] cdash down?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjTgzd-dWv0xrtG5bC3jbx-gVzo73A=d59LSw_6mCHBBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Does anyone know what is happening with QGIS' cdash? If I try to access
http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS

I just get a username/password prompt. This change happened about 2
days ago, and I'm wondering if it's an intentional change, or just an
issue with the server.

Nyall
