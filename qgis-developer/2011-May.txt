Subject: [Qgis-developer] Commit Freeze
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=hAhANj_yAxvpVChkFfL4Bw0G1GA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Just a quick note to say that I branched for the 1.7 release this
weekend and am busy working on the git migration. Currently there is a
commit freeze in place, so if you have changes, please hold on until I
repost here lifting the freeze. I will try to get the migration done
as quickly as possible.

Thanks

Tim

thanks MArtin, that did the job... i had done a make clean but was
obviously not enough ...

Now I still get the sip error below, i can't remember how i solved it
last time...

Couldn't load PyQGIS.
Python support will be disabled.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in
RuntimeError: the sip module implements API v8.0 to v8.1 but the

I'm seeing this kind of artifacts also in trunk under Linux when
reprojecting wms layers in new projects (not previously saved).

I would expect that you have maybe an incompatible version of sip
generator and sip python module or something similar. Not sure though
about the cause.

I look into it tonite. But i guessed a similar cause. Is it correct that
trunk needs sip api v 7?

No. QGIS does not care about sip api version. That is an internal
matter of SIP - it forbids running python modules using incompatible
spi api version to protect users from misbehavior (or crashes) due to
changes in SIP interals between incompatible sip releases.

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=xdMZP3o1fVKfM_WvO5-Uu3t+6gg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am observing QgsRubberBand 1px shift with GRASS region. You can
verify comparing a layer with full region extent (e.g. r.mapcalc
test=1 or v.in.region output=test) with current region. After a long
QGIS code inspection I have discovered quite strange piece of code in
QT:

qpaintengine_x11.cpp:

// use the same rounding as in qrasterizer.cpp (6 bit fixed point)
static const qreal aliasedCoordinateDelta = 0.5 - 0.015625;
[...]
    qreal offs = adjust_coords ? aliasedCoordinateDelta : 0.0;
[...]
            if (!X11->use_xrender || !(render_hints & QPainter::Antialiasing)) {
                translated_points[j].rx() =
qRound(translated_points[j].rx() + aliasedCoordinateDelta) + offs;
                translated_points[j].ry() =
qRound(translated_points[j].ry() + aliasedCoordinateDelta) + offs;
            }

using QPainter::Antialiasing hint in fact solves the problem:

 {
+  painter->setRenderHint(QPainter::Antialiasing);
   paint( painter ); // call the derived item's drawing routines
 }

May I apply the patch? I hope that just setting the hint should not
harm but I don't want to break anything in QGIS core few days before
release.

Do you understand the aliasedCoordinateDelta???

Common projections are maybe broken but Polar Stereographic works and
that is important.

As far as I understand this, Qt treats pixels to be squares (x,y) to
(x+1,y+1), where x and y are integers. Therefore a horizontal line
(0,1) - (10,1) is located exactly between the row 0 and row 1. Indeed
when rendering with antialiasing turned on, and 1pixel pen width the
line spans two rows, each with 50% opacity. When rendering without
antialiasing, Qt probably wants to avoid rounding errors and shifts
everything by 0.5px, therefore the same line (0,1) - (10,1) fits
exactly the pixels on row 1.

The magic constant 0.15625 is actually 1/64 and it is apparently there
to produce equivalent results to the native Qt rasterizer which works
in fixed precision of 1/64 px.

Btw. this simple script illustrates the behavior:

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
import sys
a = QApplication(sys.argv)
pix = QPixmap(64, 64)
pix.fill()
p = QPainter(pix)
p.drawLine(QPointF(0,0), QPointF(10,0)) # no antialiasing
p.setRenderHint(QPainter.Antialiasing)
p.drawLine(QPointF(0,2), QPointF(10,2))
p.end()

pix.save("antitest.png")

Shouldn't we actually use the antialiasing flag from map canvas
instead of hardcoding antialiasing on? Like that the offset in
rendered map and canvas items should be equal.

What 'rounding errors'? The problem is, that using
  p.drawLine(QPointF(0,0.2), QPointF(10,0.2))
in your script without antialiasing will render the line on the second
row! Which I believe, is far from any expected result.

Better, but currently QgsMapCanvas sets antialiasing directly on
QgsMapCanvasMap which has no QgsMapCanvasMap::antiAliasing() method so
it has to be added somewhere.

Oh, I see! This really looks like a bug in x11 paint engine (running
Qt 4.6.2 here). If you use QImage (raster engine) instead of QPixmap
you get the expected result (line still on the first row). Also OpenGL
engine gives correct results.

You may try adding this before creation of QApplication instance:

This will effectively use QImage raster engine also for QPixmap
operations. I think it is also believed to be more performant than
native x11 engine):

Right, there's only QgsMapCanvas::enableAntiAliasing() which should
have also the getter like hasAntiAliasing()

If you are interested in the git migration, you can test and play
around with it here:

http://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS

You can go ahead and fork it and see if everything works ok for you.
If we encounter any major issues, we may need to trash and repopulate
it so please don't consider it production ready yet. I made detailed
notes on the migration for anyone interested here:

http://linfiniti.com/2011/05/some-notes-on-the-great-migration-qgis-svn-to-git/

If any git experts notice anything untoward with my procedures please
feel free to suggest better working practices.

I'll give it a couple of days and if nobody has any major issues, we
can start to use that as our canonical repository.

Next we will start to work on the trac -> redmine migration (and svn
commitlog -> git commitlog in redmine). If anyone has particular
expertise in these (especially the latter), please feel free to
volunteer your services.

The other directories (code examples etc under svn trunk) I will
migrate after the release has gone out.

Regards

Tim

great stuff :-)

The repository reads 59 branches and 82 tags. In my opinion we should:
- remove all ancient tags not related to releases - like
"root-before-SDTS-branch"
- change all release branches to tags
- remove all branches that have been merged or not touched for more
than 1-2 years
- for releases adopt a strategy e.g.: create release branch from
master, do release-related commits there, when finished create a
release tag and remove the release branch

... we would end up with just few active branches and tags marking
releases or other important milestones.

Then I have a question regarding merging stuff from other
repositories. For example customization we have done with Radim is
based on Sourcepole clone, Pirmin's globe work is also based on that
clone. Those are repositories with a different base, so I would expect
that merging will not work automatically. Anyone has some experience
with such use case?

Finally I have one major concern I have forgotten to discuss during
the hackfest. There will be no commit revision numbers anymore, so
developers will barely stay motivated to develop QGIS knowing that we
will never reach (and celebrate) revision 16000 or 20000 (btw. now we
are at r15861). Do you have any solution for that? Git's sha1 hashes
for the commits may bring in some fun too, though they seem quite
random :-)

Hi Marco,
Myself I migrated to Ubuntu 10.10 and I had the python issue when
building r15676 last Saturday but Martin hint ("completely remove your
build directory") solved the problem for me.
My /etc/apt/sources.list contains the following:
deb http://qgis.org/debian-nightly natty main
deb-src http://qgis.org/debian-nightly natty main

Do you use one of the followings?
https://launchpad.net/~qgis/+archive/stable
http://les-ejk.cz/ubuntu/  #  GIS for Ubuntu
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu

Does are some I tend to use in the past and that are now commented out
in my sources.list

Hope it helps. Good luck!
Mayeul

Agreed - we discussed this a bit on IRC but I wasnt sure if people
were in a 'keep every bit' mindset or a 'don't let the world know how
cluttered our minds are' mindset. Unless there are objections, I will
clean away some of the obviously crufty bits.

Ok I can do that easily enough.

Yup agreed

Yup also good.

I would probably keep the last release running as a branch until the
next release comes out and then last gets tagged, new gets branched.

Ok thats one of the sucky things about using git svn approach and one
of the main reasons I wanted to get away from git svn to pure git.
With git svn each clone gets distinct git hashes for each commit so
two separately cloned repos can never marry up again. In your case I
think sourcepole clone was created independently of qgis community
clone so the only way to get your changes into qgis community was to :

commit to sourcepole repo
git svn dcommit to push changes into svn
git svn rebase on a clone of qgis community repo
git push the changes up to the community repo

For now if you are working on one of the old svn originated repos you
probably still need to deal with that - except now svn dcommit &
rebase arent there so you will need to create a patch or manually
overwrite files in a git community clone from your sourcepole clone.

Feel free to correct me if I got any of that wrong git experts....

Actually, this is a large benefit of moving to git for me. I can't
think how many times I have been about to commit when someone else
pipped me at the post:

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=1000 Gary
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=2000 anonymous (cvs2svn)
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=3000 Gavin
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=4000 Mark
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=5000 Martin
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=6000 Gavin
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=7000 Tim
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=8000 Marco
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=9000 Tim
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=10000 Otto
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=11000 Juergen
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=12000 Werner
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=13000 Radim
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=14000 William
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser?rev=15000 William

Now I no longer need to feel bent and frustrated about not hitting
those 1000 based revisions. Anyway, generating sequential commit
numbers in git should be trivial to do following this recipe:

- write to Linus Torvalds and ask him to change git so that it uses
sequential numbers (and update the entire kernel source so that it
uses the new numbering)
- write to every person who has a git repository and ask them to
update to Linus's new version of GIT and rehash their version numbers
- delete any revision if there is another revision in a competing tree
with the same number

I could continue with more detail, but I'm sure you get the picture :-)

Regards

Tim

`git describe` will return the number of commits since the last tag or some
other reference point of your choosing if you need a linear "commit number"
to track.  Another thing that can help developer motivation is `git shortlog
-s -n` which computes the number of commits per author and displays a sorted
list.

Hi All,

I have  been working with a client that previously has been using ArcGIS for
digitizing areas in the field on tablet laptops. Due to some frustrations
with ArcGIS and ArcPad we went ahead and implemented a simple python plug-in
that is based on the stream digitizing python plug-in, but adds a (csv file)
configure simple custom form with prefilled drop down boxes. The whole
things works great. Except one issue is that using compressed imagery such
as ecw or *.sid images the speed of the application is pretty slow when
digitizing (compared to ArcGIS).

Thus I have some questions for ideas or input on this.

I am assuming that the speed in QGIS totally depends on the driver used for
the ecw and .sid images - which as I understand is the ERMapper /Erdas
driver. 
Is there anything that could be done that the stream digitizing of polygons
(which itself without compressed imagery is blazing fast for shape files)
that can be done that one does not suffer such big performance hits when
using a compressed image as a background...

As a work around I recommended to the client to use non-compressed imagery
such as tiff - which when it has overviews is performing really well.
However that means bigger storage space needed and the need to decompress
the imagery and add overview, which we can use some gdal scripts for ....but
still we would like to avoid these steps if possible. 

Thus, this is just to see if there options to optimize anything or there is
nothing at this point that can be done to have better performance with
compressed imagery.

Also is there anybody that could report on how the speed for other formats
such as JPEG2000 compares to ecw  to MrSID (other formats)? 
Anyone ?

Thanks a lot 
Cheers

Thank you Jurgen for the valuable information. I would not have been able to get my plugin to do the update I need to have it with out your kindness.

Is there anywhere such items are explained? Is that part of the api doc through inheritance? If so I would try to look into it more and do my homework so that I am not a asking too many questions. But just the same, I am also ashamed to ask, and take your valuable time and I spend quite a bit of my time wandering around. 

Thank you Jurgen again and I also say, God bless you.

Changes to the feature buffer filled by QgsVectorLayer::nextFeature() are not
propagated to the layer.

Use QgsVectorLayer::changeAttributeValue() [1].

Marco,

I just upgraded to ubuntu 11.04 and had the same problem about
SIP(Couldn't load PyQGIS....)

I am running perfectly QGIS, to this i follow this steps:

1) Remove all files and directories in 'build' directory

2) Inside 'build' directory:
2.1) Set the makefile:
sudo ccmake ..
2.2) Make and install QGIS
sudo make
sudo make install

* in my case, i made update of sources(checkout from SVN)

3) Install the OSGEO binding for Python
sudo apt-get install python-gdal
* when updated the ubuntu, the system removed the OSGEO binding

Hope it helps.

Luiz

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis trunk fails to start (due to plugin)
Message-ID: <4DBFD971.3060005@gmx.de>

Hello!

I have qgis trunk (nightly builds/debian packages) running here, and
found that some plugins fail to work (maybe due to newer version of
qgis), leading to qgis not starting.
This can generally be circumvented starting without plugins:
qgis --noplugins

This is the console output (while loading SDA4PP):

> NEW LOGGING | 03.05.2011 12:09:34 | SDA4PP, Version=0.195

Oops. Removed ~/.qgis/python/plugins/SDA4PP to make qgis start again.

This leads to a question: Should qgis be more foult tolerant towards
such plugin failures? A failure like the one below is no problem and
just throws a warning.
Ok, a segfault is bad and maybe cannot be recovered from. And the
plugins seems to do a lot before starting, failing with a segfault.
Reason could be unmet dependencies (R packages, didn't check thoroughly).

This was another dysfunct plugin, handled fine with a warning (removing
/home/martin/.qgis/python/plugins/autogcp/ solved it):

console output:

Oh SDA4PP again.  That one has a long history of causing QGIS crashes.

We can't do much about it, when a C++ plugin crashes in itself - it takes the
process with it...

Ok, no problem, just wanted to document it somewhere. Just tried to
reinstall it (newest version), but still got same problems.
Whatever, I can live without that plugin for now ;)

it is a Python plugin, and yes, it is source of problems but still is a
*very* useful set of tools.

I'm gathering a list of issues and then I'll write to the author (Hi
Volkan!) to see if it is interested in fixing them. If anyone is
interested in supporting the author please let me know.

Cheers

I wrote up a guide[1] on how to migrate your changesets into git from
a 'foreign' repo. The process was quite easy for me, hopefully it will
be for you too.

If you want to preserve the history of each commit just omit the
squash part of the process.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] branching: symbol levels in rule-based rendering
Message-ID: <1304450406.2836.19.camel@mk-desktop-smh>

Hi Tim,
Just a note as you asked me to remind you and the core developers about
the patch for symbol levels in rule-based rendering.
The patch is the last attached file here:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222
Named:
patch_on_r15676-rbr_symbol-levels_reordering_1st-rule_buttons.diff

Using this, I developed 339 rules giving a quite robust symbology for
OSM data (point, lines, polygons) and contour lines, with continuous
zooming capability from street view (1:2500) to national view (about
1:50 000 000).
In addition to being useful to end users, I believe it will meet the
increasing needs for customized OSM web servers, thanks to qgis-server.
Given that QGIS is much more user friendly than mapnik and osmarender
(you concentrate on mapping rather than on stylesheet writing), this
should speed up the adoption of qgis-server.
(A search for [openstreetmap custom] on google gives 2 Million of
results). Hope this helps!

Thank you,
Mayeul

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qGis detects proxy settings from ie
Message-ID: <BANLkTim1osJjtD-0g+SFFUnZg_DhXkw13Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,
this is the first time that I write to qgis-dev ML,
I need suggestion about the proxy settings in QGIS,
I'm trying to modify the code so that QGIS, on Windows XP,
is able to detect the proxy settings from Internet Explorer likeOSGeo4W
installer

This would be very useful for example,
when the username and password authentication through Active Directory
and the ones of the proxy connection credentials are the same.
Then so far, when the users periodically update their password,
have to update manually the settings of the proxy in qGis as well.
So users phone to me 'cause WMS or plugin manager not working,
but they just forget to update their proxy settings.

The manually proxy settings update isn't required for Internet Explorer or
Firefox

I'm seeing these files:
http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/browser/trunk/setup/ConnectionSetting.cc
http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/browser/trunk/setup/net.cc
http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/browser/trunk/setup/netio.cc

src/core/qgsnetworkaccessmanager.cpp

thanks in advance
cheers, Marica

Apparently this does not happen with current trunk also on Linux.
Maybe it was fixed (r15845?).

in my tests it does not crash on both linux/trunk (ubuntu/r15861) or
windows/trunk (osgeo4w and standalone with creatensis.pl).

Hi Jef,
Following your comments on indentation in my patch, I tried to use
prepare-commit.sh for more than one hour in vain. When applied after git
commit it says nothing has changed (in effect, after commit, my working
copy is ahead). So I created a new branch locally to restart from
scratch, reapplied my patch, tried the script, in vain again. The best I
get is:
"Unable to determine upstream SVN information from working tree history"

The only help I could find is a few lines on the following page:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Developers_Manual#Coding_Style

"There is a scripts/prepare-commit.sh that looks up the changed files
and reindents them using astyle. This should be run before committing.
As newer versions of astyle indent differently than the version used to
do a complete reindentation of the source, the script uses an old astyle
version, that we include in our repository."

I had to guess by reading the source code of the script that I needed to
install flip (and astyle?), and pass the path to the project as first
parameter, but I could not find any documentation on this. Should the
script be run form the root folder? Should I install astyle or not? (the
comment above on the astyle versions puzzles me).

Finally the following command took 10 minutes:
cd /hometb/mk/sig/dev/release-1_7_0-4May/Quantum-GIS
./scrips/prepare-commit.sh .
before telling me:
"Unable to determine upstream SVN information from working tree history"

I tried from several places with relative or absolute path, in vain.

So I tried to follow this advice on the same wiki:
"There is a .indent.pro file in the QGIS src directory that contains the
switches to be used when indenting code using the GNU indent program. If
you don't use GNU indent, you should emulate these settings."

So I installed GNU indent... but could not find the .indent.pro file in
the QGIS src directory. What indent options should I use?

If I cannot make scrips/prepare-commit.sh work, I do not mind formatting
my code manually, but which guidelines? The manual only says "Tab
spacing should be set to 2 spaces" and "Braces should start on the line
following the expression", which I tried to follow.
I do not mind to try and "emulate these settings", if I know where to
look for.


Still, thank you jef for you comments on coding style and other hints.
Could you please give me some hints on how to solve the above
indentation problem?

Thanks a lot in advance!

Hi jef and all,
I guess it's better to have this discussion here than on a comment of line 351 of src/core/symbology-ng/qgsrendererv2.cpp  at https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/3/files#r26150
Probably it would help other people (Is everybody already always using the indentation scripts? If yes, I should get many answers, if not, please read one of today's commits: "If you plan to contribute you should reindent with scripts/prepare-commit.sh (using 'our' astyle)").

Jef, you wrote that the reason I could not use the indentation scripts "should be fixed in SHA: 86bcdc4bac26a28c1a25"

Thanks for the hint! Sorry, but I do not understand from the above what to do.
Looking in qgis github for the above code, I arrived here https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commits/master  
I found this, whose code name is similar to the above:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/86bcdc4bac26a28c1a25adf0ad088390c3bd16d3
Should I take the CMakeLists.txt from the above, replace mine and start again?
Still I found another of your commits that contains much more changes related to astyle:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/dcc723c067a795b240247754817c3c21abdffc28


Tim: you said I should use git as this would be easier than sending a new patch file, but now I see that the 1_7_0 branch lacks the correct files to do the indentation. So should I ask a pull request to port the two above-mentioned commits into 1_7_0 ??! Or fork 1_7_0 into my branch, merge the above into my branch (no idea how to do this with git), re-indent the new code, undo the previous merge (so that it does not propagate to 1_7_0), commit this to my branch and request another pull?!
I guess the whole point of branching to 1_7_0 just before migrating to git is to have a faster release (let people learn git on master). Currently, the 1_7_0 branch is not ready for indenting scripts with git, should that be mandatory? I do not mind trying, but I need some more guidance here. I tried to modify the prepare-commit.sh script to give it the list of files to re-indent but it failed. Any hint on how to do this? Thanks.

Jef, you wrote: "our version of astyle is built in scripts/"
Yes, I saw this and wrote that it "puzzles me". Let me put it differently: from where should I run the script ( my `pwd`) and with which option (I saw the "PATH" hack) to have it find the astyle.sh which is in the folder.

Thanks a lot!
Mayeul

PS: Better to discuss this here for another reason: the hash code in the from/reply to messages sent by git scared my wife ;-) (well, now I redirect them in another folder for sake of her heart).

install flip (and astyle?), and pass the path to the project as first
parameter, but I could not find any documentation on this. Should the
script be run form the root folder? Should I install astyle or not? (the
comment above on the astyle versions puzzles me).

Finally the following command took 10 minutes:
cd /hometb/mk/sig/dev/release-1_7_0-4May/Quantum-GIS
./scrips/prepare-commit.sh .
before telling me:
"Unable to determine upstream SVN information from working tree history"

I tried from several places with relative or absolute path, in vain.

So I tried to follow this advice on the same wiki:
"There is a .indent.pro file in the QGIS src directory that contains the
switches to be used when indenting code using the GNU indent program. If
you don't use GNU indent, you should emulate these settings."

So I installed GNU indent... but could not find the .indent.pro file in
the QGIS src directory. What indent options should I use?

If I cannot make scrips/prepare-commit.sh work, I do not mind formatting
my code manually, but which guidelines? The manual only says "Tab
spacing should be set to 2 spaces" and "Braces should start on the line
following the expression", which I tried to follow.
I do not mind to try and "emulate these settings", if I know where to
look for.


Still, thank you jef for you comments on coding style and other hints.
Could you please give me some hints on how to solve the above
indentation problem?

Thanks a lot in advance!

This wasn't meant get a huge discussion anyway - I was just testing the
comments on github.

My point was that the indentation of

  if ( r )
    r->setUsingSymbolLevels( element.attribute( "symbollevels", "0" ).toInt() );
    r->setUsingFirstRule( element.attribute( "firstrule", "0" ).toInt() );

suggests that the second line, which you added, is also guarded by that "if",
but it's not.

So braces are needed.  Running scripts/prepare-commit.sh would have revealed
that.  That's why I also mentioned that in the comment.

Otherwise indentation is not that important.

Top level, no options.  prepare-commit.sh will figure out which files were
changed and runs astyle.sh only on those.

But it's to late for that in your case anyway, as you've already committed.

Not sure what the best practice is to update the pull request.  Perhaps other
more git experienced users can comment.

Hi J?rgen,

Thanks a lot for the detailed answer!! Sorry to have bothered you; I
agree standardizing indentation can be useful [in fact, it does not make
merging more difficult but easier: if indentation is standardized before
each commit, nobody will never ever have to merge indentation].

"But it's to late for that in your case anyway, as you've already
committed."
I would have forked the new 1_7_0 again, applied my patch here, taken
into account your comment, run the indentation tool, committed, pushed,
and made another pull request. Then I would have deleted my other fork
(is this good practice?)

I will now work on your comments.
Regards,
Mayeul

Message-ID: <BANLkTin7-KUQvRstm=VyXdT9eJLK2j+p-g@mail.gmail.com>

I noticed the srs.db was updated in the latest build. I can see crssync
running.

However, I don't see any changes in the proj4 definitions for EPSG:3168 and
EPSG:3375. They are missing the +gamma parameter. This parameter has already
been included in gdal 1.8.

C:\>epsg_tr -proj4 3168
# Kertau (RSO) / RSO Malaya (m)
<3168> +proj=omerc +lat_0=4 +lonc=102.25 +alpha=323.0257905 +k=0.99984

+gamma=323.1301023611111 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs  <>

Was this a selective update of certain crs and if so, how do I get my
projections to be updated as well?

My config:
OSGeo4W Windows 7 64-bit

Thanks and regards

Hi,

I do not know either what I good practice, but now that a new commit has
been done on the branched 1_7_0 I have now idea how to propagate this in
the pull request. I would have created a new personal repository forking
the main one and started from zero, but since it is not possible to
download a single branch, downloading all takes hours for me, so their
might be another commit in the mean time... this way I will never catch
up.

So for the moment the easy way I found was to post a new patch here: 
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/attachment/ticket/3222/
(@Tim: it now uses relative paths)

Patch on freshly branched 1_7_0
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/6c835b4cf5cd4a4be687e829bb57e3d51e7345f7
 taking into accounts jef's comments at
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/3

Would it be fine for you to work with this?
I wish also to thank you for the hints you already gave me for improving
my code.

All the best,
Mayeul

There's no problem importing changes from upstream, git pull merges
them in.

Optionally the --rebase switch acts like if you created patches
for your changes, updated the repository to upstream, and re-applied
those patches.

Hi,
Thanks all for your hints. Still,  I could not find a way to make those
changes on existing branch and on the pull request #3, so I forked again
and added a new pull request:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/7

In the meantime, there was a new commit in the 1_7_0 branch.
(Yes, I know, it is "simple" to solve this but sorry, no, I'm not smart
enough yet...).

Sorry for those probably bad practices...

Ok no need to refork, you can just do (in your local repo):

git remote add qgis-upstream git://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git
git fetch qgis-upstream
git branch --track release-1_7_0 origin/release-1_7_0
git checkout release-1_7_0
git pull qgis-upstream release-1_7_0
git push origin release-1_7_0

That will pull any changes from qgis repo and push them up to your
clone of it. Obviously you need to commit any fixes you made in
response to the comments and push those too. Then just issue a new
pull request and cancel the old one.

I will write up some working practice docs in CODING soon I promise :-)

Is this git thing on?  Questions and confusion.

Is there a git guide for dummies?  I found http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Using_Git but it seems overly complex.  I just want to do like I've done with svn - check out/update, make changes, and commit the changes.  3 steps.  Git checkout itself looks complex, let alone committing a change.

...Sorry if I seem a bit resistant.

Are users migrated to git?  Or do I need to register with github and ask for commit access?

How long until 1.7 release?  I would like to do the workaround for http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3497 before release, and check over the Mac install/build instructions.

Have a look at the help ->

Here is a nice cheatsheet ->

You need to register to github but you don't need to ask for commit 
access : the best way of enjoying git is to make your own fork the 
trunk, work on it and then push the changes back. It is still possible 
to have one repo with everybody writing directly to it but, Tim will 
correct me, that's not the choice made at the hackfest.

The best Git guide I have found that balances amount of information with
concision is available at:

    http://gitref.org

It was written by some members of the GitHub team and is designed to get you
doing pull/commit/push as fast as possible.

Other great references containing advanced tricks are:

    http://progit.org
    http://gitready.com

I started out with SVN as well and used it happily for years.  However, Git
grew on me and I now use `git svn` as my SVN client. Some tricks that
delighted me when I first made the move:

   - `git add -p <file>` lets you interactively choose certain changes to a
   file to be added to a commit and leave the rest for later.
   - `git commit --amend` I use this all the time---merges changes into the
   last commit rather than creating a new commit.
   - `git stash` lets you set aside work and rewind to the last commit.
   Useful for when you are halfway through a feature implementation and realize
   there is a nasty bug that needs to be fixed *right now* and that should be
   in it's own commit. `git stash apply` lets you resume work after the bugfix.
   There is more too `git stash` as well, definitely browse `git help stash`.
   - `git rebase` lets you re-write and clean up history locally before
   publishing it to the world (actually, lets you re-write published history as
   well but that is frowned upon in most situations). Perfect for those
   situations where it takes three or four commits to actually kill a bug off
   due to dumb mistakes and unexpected corner cases. Among other things `git
   rebase` lets you re-pack all those commits into one commit.

Unless Tim has worked out some sort of deal with the GitHub staff to
automatically migrate accounts (never heard of that happening before), you
will need to register an account on GitHub and have him add you to the QGIS
organization.

Is ad494d4 before or after a87cb60?

Is  there  a  plan  to  add  some  sequential number to nightly builds
QGIS/About?  Right  now the only indicator of freshness of the nightly
build  is  suffix  of  the  package  which most of the users don't pay
attention to while installig/updating.

Hi,
Thanks a lot Tim for the  detailed commands!
Will be useful for next time. While searching for documentation, I found
several very good diagrams (including the one on the qgis wiki):

http://osteele.com/archives/2008/05/commit-policies
http://blog.interlinked.org/tutorials/git.html
http://www.google.com/search?q=site:book.git-scm.com&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch
from  http://book.git-scm.com/

The most detailed graphic cheat sheet I found is here:
http://panela.blog-city.com/update_of_git_supervisual_cheatsheet.htm
But on the project page you find an even more detailed svg a python
script (I could not make it work, though, even after "sudo easy_install
pysvg)

I have added the first two of those here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Using_Git



By the way, I also corrected the code formatting for braces in the,
er..., editing section of the "good formatting example" at:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Developers_Manual#Editing
(should we run astyle on code extracts in the wiki? ;-)  )



Hope this helps,
Mayeul

Hi,
I like versioning systems so learning a new one is interesting. The
paradoxal point with this github is as follows:

(+) One of the idea is to let non-core developers contribute (make
commits... in their branch only) in an easy way. I love the github tool
that shows you which branch will merge easily with yours... (well, I
love it when it's green). That's great.
(-) Less experienced developers are not allowed to commit to the trunk
because... they are less experienced; that's OK. But in the meantime,
IMHO they are required to have a better understanding of git than what
is required to commit directly to the main repository.

Still, probably the (+) is bigger than the (-). I saw the same doubts in
teams migrating from cvs to svn, and none of them wish to go back.

Just my 2 cents.

Although it is *strongly* recommended to create a separate branch for each
feature. For example, if you only use a release-1_7_0 branch:

    git branch --track release-1_7_0 origin/release-1_7_0

And work on two features, x and y you will have a problem when opening pull
requests from that branch:

    The pull request for feature x will contain all commits for feature y
and vice versa.

A better method would be:

    git checkout -b feature/x --track origin/release-1_7_0
    git checkout -b feature/y --track origin/realease-1_7_0

That sets up both branches so that `git pull` will bring in upstream
changes, yet changes made by `git commit` are segregated. Pull requests
opened from `feature/x` will only contain commits related to x.

Err, sorry---if you were following Tim's instructions, that should be:

    git checkout -b feature/x --track qgis-upstream/release-1_7_0
    git checkout -b feature/x --track qgis-upstream/release-1_7_0

Hi Folks

Well we have been poking around with the qgis/Quantum-GIS github repo
for the last week and I think it looks ok for us to continue to work
against it. So unless there are any objections I would like to make it
the 'official' code repository and update the docs etc. I will be
adding some documentation on how to carry out your basic workflow with
the new repo.

One thing we briefly discussed on the IRC channel is not reinstating
every committer from the svn committer list. Since we now work with a
distributed model, it is simple for *anyone* interested in working
against our code base to do so and contribute their changes back with
very little effort. Also, external contributors get fully acknowledged
as their name & email are propogated into the code history when we
pull from their repository or apply their patches (if they were
created using the git patch preparation tool). As such it makes little
sense for use to have tens of committers into the core repository,
Instead I would like to suggest that we provide the most active
committers with direct access to the repostory and let them apply pull
requests from others as needed. The ability to work on QGIS is truly
democratised with GIT and the purpose of committers to the core repo
should (in my eyes) be just to perform a final screening for code
quality etc before it makes its way into the repository.

If you are an existing svn committer and feel strongly about wanting
to have direct commit access to the master repo, please speak up now.

With regards to the migration to redmine, I am waiting on osgeo to
provide a backup and then we will attempt the migration - Alex Mandel
has kindly offered to help with this - hopefully we will look at it
later tonight.

As such the release of 1.7 is still on hiatus until we get all our
infrastructure updates done - small patches to fix issues in the
release branch (no string changes please) are welcome in the mean
time. Packagers are also encouraged to build test packages and submit
any needed changes to support their packaging work.

Best regards

Tim

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=n_bGHri293Mf9veFtLWY_W-YVZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

Sorry for the newbish question:
I remember reading somewhere online about the QGIS_PLUGINPATH
environment variable and thinking it was a cool idea. I set it up to
point to my local development folder.
Now I want to disable it to test some improvements on a plugin, but I
don't remember where it is set...

I've checked ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, /etc/environment and I couldn't find it.

So I'm thinking this online source where I remember reading about this
variable probably had some tip on how to set it up. Maybe it is even
inside one of Qgis's internal folders. Anyone knows where it is
defined?

Thanks

While looking over the Mac build instructions for 1.7 release, I realized the whole SVN section will have to be changed to be about git.

Then it occurred to me - why are we mentioning getting source from svn (now git) at all for a release?  This is in a released source package.  Of course, svn/git applies to trunk (now master).

Maybe to accomodate both a release and git the body platform sections could be about release packages, with reference to a separate section at the end (after all platform sections) that covers git for those interested.  That would also reduce some redundancy in describing git setup and commands.

Yeah or we should just move all git related stuff into CODING.t2t
which is intended for developers (who are probably more likely to
actually care about such things)....and just put a note referring to
that file in the INSTALL.t2t docs.

timlinux@vaoi:~/dev/cpp/qgis-github-clone$ egrep -R QGIS_PLUGINPATH src/*
src/python/qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp:  // plugin dirs passed in
QGIS_PLUGINPATH env. variable have highest priority (usually empty)

No it is only read. I suggest using a command similar to above to
search your home directory to see if it has been set somewhere.

This is what I had in mind, but I didn't think about the CODING file, I guess the git stuff can be moved there, though that might be info overload for casual users that want to try development sources:

http://github.com/kyngchaos/Quantum-GIS/commit/1ecfd9b0addec28494f0331b3446bcf60273f053

Only the Mac section is updated here to refer to the git section and to have git installation instructions.  Similar would be needed for Linux and Windows.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to get a string's english translation with
	pyhton?
Message-ID: <BANLkTin+VmFo2+LHN4SZQK3ba2p-RwNLXw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list

in order to identify pixel values I'm using QgsRasterLayer.identify()

This method returns a tuple, with first value being a boolean (by the
way, see ticket[1] on trac). The second value is a dictionary with
band names as keys and pixel value.

I want to check for the pixel value and, in case it is null or out of
extents, I want to assign a value to some variable. I am testing the
pixel value for the presence of "out of extent" and "null" strings.
This works OK when the user is using an english locale. When the
locale is different, these strings show up translated and my code
fails miserably.

How can I solve this problem? I'd like to be able to get the english
version of the string independently of the locale being used by the
user.
Thanks

Message-ID: <4DC72088.5060106@wildintellect.com>

1. A dump of Trac has been moved over. It's in my home dir on the server

2. Talking to Chris he thinks it would be about $50-100/yr to add
qgis.org to the existing SSL certs OSGeo has. This would enable us to
have SSL (https) on any *.qgis.org website for logins and sessions.
The alternative is to do a self-signed certificate which requires users
to click through several screens (depends on browser). Or we can get our
own SSL cert not tied to OSGeo (sounds more complicated to me for 0
savings).

3. I think we need to make a fresh Redmine instance to try importing the
trac migration, and then see if we can move the plugin stuff from hub
into the same instance.

4. Don't forget about creating a script to do a nightly dump of
everything we want backed up. Once such a script is done let me know and
I can modify the OSGeo Bacula instance to run it, pull the files and
cleanup after.

Thanks,
Alex

How about a something like *.qgis.osgeo.org?  I suppose that would be covered
by the existing certificate, wouldn't it?

Yes, urls ending in .qgis.osgeo.org should be covered, and we could
always redirect say hub.qgis.org to hub.qgis.osgeo.org to make it easier
for end users to remember.

It sounds nice, but are you sure that core developers have enough
time/will to do that? It is quite boring, it is not a typical work for
volunteer enthusiasts. I worry that non critical patches can be left
not applied.

I don't feel "strongly wanting" but I would like to ask for write

I can also do some paid bugfixing. In past years I have infected
various parts of QGIS which consequently have to be fixed. Mostly
GRASS, my current trip to raster areas is a side effect of my work on
GRASS raster provider and reprojection is just side effect of that
side effect ....

Hi, 

I'm stuck with a debugging  error. 
I implemented a simple code with qgis 1.6.0 and qt 4.7.2 libraries and
compiled with visual Studio 2005.
It works fine in release mode. In debug mode, it crashes while creating the
window with the message below.
I've searched the forum about this error, but I couldn't find anything
helpful.
Any help would be appriciated. 
Thanks..

Yes. On the other hand there are quite a few committers in the list
who are not very if at all active anymore. If they come back to the
project after a long period of activity it would be nice to make sure
they are up to speed with our plans and intentions before they
directly change code again.

 Hi,

 With QGIS 1.7 svn 15861 (osgeo4w), the output of the georeferencing 
 plugin does not take into account the compression setting and so creates 
 a 1go file instead of a 100Mo.

 Before creating a bug report, could someone confirm the following 
 problem ?

Right, but I thought that that was just about those committers.  Every recent
committer should IMHO be reinstated.

BTW I for one don't like that github pull request business yet.  I like to do -
mostly small - adjustments (eg. indentation) to the patches I commit without
making a big fuss about it .  And I don't (yet?) see how that is easier using
pull requests...

Yup - basically as people who are already commiters express interest
and provide me with a github account, I will just add them ok?

In that case do:

Once off:
git remote add <remote name e.g. tim> <repo url>
git fetch
git branch --track tim-release-1_7_0 tim/release-1_7_0


Each time you get a pull request:

git checkout tim-release-1_7_0
git pull
<fix up whatever you dont like>
git commit -a -m "Fixed intentation or whatever"
git push qgis-upstream

By comparison to svn:

download patch
svn update
patch -p0 < foopatch
<fix up whatever you dont like>
svn commit



When you are tired of that branch chuck it away:
git branch -D  tim-release-1_7_0


We could automate that with a little batch script in script. Also you
can just clone directly qgis official repo since you are a committer
and not bother with maintaining your own clone on GH which will
simplify the process somewhat. If you look at the equivalent svn
process you can see that we can ultimately do the same work with only
one added command.

Regards

Tim

	rasters?
Message-ID: <BANLkTik6fU+S5iAzqKUE8Gm90mz8k5O9SQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I set transparency in Properties/Transparency/Transparent pixel list as
0,0,0 100%
(i.e, 100% transparent if 0 in all 3 bands)
and save the style to a qml file that gets the following lines close to the end:
    <threeValuePixelList>
      <pixelListEntry red="0.000000" blue="0.000000" green="0.000000"
percentTransparent="100"/>
    </threeValuePixelList>

Nevertheless, when I open another raster and apply this style, the
transparency is not modified.

Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks

Agus

Hi Paolo

You can find the gui here:
http://www.sourcepole.com/2010/12/16/zonal-statistics-plugin-for-qgis

The gui is not in trunk because the preformance of the function is not optimal 
for huge datasets.

Marco

Hi Werner,

no, I searched for the bronze medal which is already used on the website and
put the other medals in the same folders. You can also put them all to
images/sponsors.

Thanks, Alexander. Bad news, as it seems this is not
fixed for 1.7
I have hundreds of images from a miniUAV, and all of them
are rotated according to a tfw file. QGIS positions the image within
a rectangle of 0, so I need to set 0,0,0 to transparent, otherwise
most of the area is overlapped by black.
Doing this manually for each image is tedious...

Cheers,

Agus

thanks for this tool! I will try it asap.

By the way, I think that if it works fine with "not huge" datasets I
don't see any reason to not include it in trunk. It will be very
attractive for many users.

meanwhile you can use gdaltools in batch mode and with warp or translate
set "-dstnodata 0" or "-a_nodata 0".

By the way, do you have any performance issue with rotated images?

see https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3794

The buggy python lines are around here:

Hi kate,
You can try writing to developper's list. I'm copying this dialog there.
I don't know how hard it is to develop a dxf exporter. IMHO it shouldn't be
so hard as gdal has a dxf writer.
It should probably be just a
    Read every layer
        Create a level for each layer
        Read every feature in that layer
             write the feature in the output layer

Best regards,
Mauricio de Paulo

Thanks for the suggestion, but I must avoid writing warped images at
this stage. The georeferencing is only approximate
as it is based on the crude navigation system of the miniUAV. The tfw
file is intended to have a first
positioning of the image on the map to check results and, eventually,
to facilitate locating ground control points.
A more accurate geometric processing, producing a mosaic, is done at a
later stage.
Displaying these rotated images is slow also. But the big problem is
not being able to select the triple 0
as transparent by default.
I've put an example of the display here:
https://sites.google.com/site/filestemp2/home/transp.jpeg
where some images have the triple 0 as transparent while others do not
and show the inconvenient black background.

Message-ID: <7bd7b9899b7184cbcbe030000c6513d3.squirrel@webmail.xs4all.nl>


Hi py-devs,

installed Ubuntu 11.04 on laptop and trying to compile qgis from svn
(r15866).

compiling (debug mode) ends ok, no errors or so, but I do not have python
(though there is a non working menu-item 'python-console').

Running qgis:

Debug: qgisapp.cpp: 4689: (loadPythonSupport) load library
/home/richard/apps/qgis/trunk/debug/lib/qgispython (1.7.0)
Debug: qgisapp.cpp: 4697: (loadPythonSupport) Couldn't load Python support
library: Cannot load library
/home/richard/apps/qgis/trunk/debug/lib/qgispython:
(/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so.1.0: undefined symbol: forkpty, version

Warning: Couldn't load Python support library: Cannot load library
/home/richard/apps/qgis/trunk/debug/lib/qgispython:
(/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so.1.0: undefined symbol: forkpty, version

Any idea?

Regards,

Richard

1- download sip.
2- configure with python( >python configure.py)
3- Some folders and files are generated by python(siplib directory + sip.exe
+ some *.py files). 
    copy them and paste to your python installation directory(C:\python25\)

Thats all.

Hi

Did you run cmake-gui from within an osgeo shell environment?

Mmm, I was/am a little afraid of git ....

But a la, tried it (qgis now says: fefae90 as 'revision' in title bar).

But exactly the same problem...

Hi 

	Thanks to all ! I solved the issue by adding python Enviromental
variable . But while building in Visual C++ I got the error as 
"
C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin\bison.exe: m4: No such file or directory
Project : error PRJ0019: A tool returned an error code from "Generating
qgsrastercalcparser.cpp"
Build log was saved at
"file://c:\qgis_source\build\src\analysis\qgis_analysis.dir\Debug\BuildLog.h
tm"
qgis_analysis - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)

       The respective m4  file is present in C:\Program
Files\GnuWin32\bin\m4 . So What should I do to solve this one to . Kindly
help me 

Regards,
Sunil

Are you sure you are following recent instructions? Use the INSTALL
document in the top of the source tree and go through the procedure
there step by step. All the questions you have had so far should be
covered if you follow the notes carefully.

Best regards

The QGIS version was changed recently. Clear away all the qgis 1.7
libs in your system and then rerun make install. It should work after
that.

Do you have 1.7.0 around ?
I've had that problem and was fixed by properly uninstalling 1.7.0.

You won't get much thing even if you follow the notes carefully.  There are
many things missing in windows installation instructions. There are tons of
compilation errors. I could not fix them all and I give up after dealing
many hours.

It's a virgin natty install, only qgis related stuff on it is from 
apt-get build-dep, @Sandro: there should just be no 1.7 version...

(can it be that the build-dep for natty is not ok??)

First compile/install via svn sources: no working python, second run 
with clean build/source tree via git sources, still no python

Tried 'locate qgis', but found nothing else then my sources and fresh 
install (even removed the install, compiled again etc)...
I do have the latest sources in fefae90 isn't it?

Richard

Is your default python the python that you have PyQt and sip for?

I have the same problem from 9 days ago, on debian sid, immediately
after libc upgrade (2.11>2.13), but building and installing the deb's,
python support works again.

in synaptic:
python-sip is showing: version 4.12.1-1 depends (python <2.8 >=2.6)
python-qt4-dev: version 4.8.3-2 depends python-sip-dev, python-qt4(<4.3)
installed python is 2.7.1, also checked by just running python and in 
errormsg: "/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so.1.0: undefined symbol: forkpty"

there is also a python3-sip available in repo's, but I think that is 
only for python 3 which we do NOT use

how to better check?

If I select 0 as NULL in raster properties, the value on the map is still the

This is a regression from previous behaviour.

These will be ripped out post 1.7 release, along with deprecated api
and any other cruft code / stuff.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis standalone app,
	sip version and API problems under mac os x
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=GV3xYJ7ChXJxWW1UTtTf1-cXAFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Sorry,
I'm trying to import qgis.core from qgis 1.6 under mac os x 10.5....

First I recived this message error:

RuntimeError: the sip module implements API v7.0 but the qgis.core module
requires API v8.0

then, after I installed the sip module v 4.12.2 I recived this message:

RuntimeError: the sip module implements API v8.0 to v8.1 but the
PyQt4.QtCore module requires API v7.0

So? Qgis 1.6 need API v7.0 or API 8.0....what version of sip I need to
install?
Best regards

luca

PyQt must be compiled again for the updated SIP - it still wants the older SIP.  But it's odd that QGIS was built for v8, then at runtime finds an *older* v7.

Are you building your own QGIS or using my package?  If building your own, it's best to bundle Qt/PyQt by setting "-D QGIS_MACAPP_BUNDLE=1" from cmake.

Hi devs,
QgsCredential* classes are in the API documentation but seems both are
missed
in the python bindings.
Any reason or are you just waiting for either somebody with a big heart or
who
needs it?? ;)

Thanks Tim. That would be very good, but I think we still need non-trivial work to
implement all the missing functions, fix the bugs etc.
Is someone working on this?

Hi all, 

it seems the same problem I had on my natty building qgis from source code.

I resolved putting /usr/lib/grass64 into /etc/ld.conf.d/libgrass64.conf (or something like that). 
You could set an enviroment variable (LD_CONFIG, but I wouldn't to be wrong) instead of create the file above.

BTW, the problem I had shouldn't occur using deb packages.

I hope this can help.
Cheers.

Hi all,

I'm testing Tim Suttom's code tutorials. Those one using cmakelists work
fine, but timtut6 is configured with QT .PRO and launches me an error like
this: 

QT shows a runtime error dialog saying "This application has requested the
runtime to terminate in an unusual way"

And the application output shows (see second line): 

Starting ... qgis_example6.exe...
QWidget: Must construct a QApplication before a QPaintDevice
...qgis_example6.exe exited with code 3



This is the code:

int main(int argc, char ** argv) 
{
  // Start the Application
  QgsApplication *app = new QgsApplication(argc, argv, TRUE);
  MainWindow * mypMainWindow = new MainWindow();
  mypMainWindow->show();
  // Start the Application Event Loop
  return app->exec();
}


I tried replacing QgsApplication for QAppliction, just testing 'course, but
the same dialog and no output application QWigdet error. 


Once I used both QApplication and QgsApplication and worked well, then I
changed all the code (replacing files) and started error again.

The curious thing here: the same code works fine if configure with
cmakelists.

Here the .PRO configuration:

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=OYgOgeFVsFO7hRJdwkijOa_u+SQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I successfully compiled QGis 1.7.0   on a Windows XP machine.

It runs correctly.  Also python plugins works (python console results
to be 2.7 version).

Only, Qgis python plugins panel tells me, in red color:

"invalid GdalTools 1.2.26   This plugin requires a missing module
(osgeo [python-gdal])"


Under the directory c:\Programmi\qgis1.7.0\python\plugins\GdalTools\  I find:

icons\
tools\
__init__.py
GdalTools.py
resources_rc.py
__init__.pyc
GdalTools.pyc
resources_rc.pyc

My question is:

What gdal-python I need to install (what version and where) to have
GdalTools working ?

I compiled with  gdal-17  and   python-gdal17.


Thank you to all want to help me

Possibly the plugin is searching the python module for the wrong version: do you have

Its going to be a group effort. I am planning to get rid of deprecated
api stuff and clean up api docs (and the api itself) as much as
possible. I guess others will pitch in for bits that are interesting
for them.

 git clone git@github.com:qgis/Quantum-GIS.git
 Initialized empty Git repository in /home/an/dev/Quantum-GIS/.git/
 ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection timed out
 fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

 Does git really require an ssh connection or is there a workaround?

 btw - the following env vars are set:
 $HTTP_PROXY
 $http_proxy
 $HTTPS_PROXY
 $https_proxy

 SVN works without a problem.

 Thanks if you have any hints,
 Andreas

Hi Andreas,

git clone https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git
should work with https_proxy.

Well, my package is supposed to work on its own (with my frameworks).  It should not be trying to use an external SIP/PyQt.

Are you trying to import from within a QGIS python console (QGIS running) or from a Terminal (no QGIS running)?

Yes William, I'm trying to import qgis.core into a standalone app, outside
QGis, using for testing the python IDLE.

P.S.: Also in Qgis 1.7 to use a python module not included into your
distribution, it's necessary to copy the module from the site-packages of
python framework within the python resources of Qgis.app?

There is some info in the readme about this.  Set PATH and PYTHONPATH so the QGIS stuff can be found.  Though maybe you're doing this already since it does find qgis.core.  The important part is that the QGIS path is at the top of the sys.path list, so python finds the bundled pyqt before any pyqt installed in site-packages.

There should be no need to copy anything to inside QGIS.  site-packages is just another search path for Python to find things.

I will try to keep separeted what depends on QGIS-Core and what
depends on QGIS-GUI. One reason to move everything UI-related to the
QGis side is precisely that: so the backends will be usable in other
contexts.

Could be done, I guess, would just need a non-QGIS reimplementation of
the front-end that talks to the modules through the same API. E.g. web
or command-line frontend is very plausible, but would need a lot of
work, of couse.

Feedback from other application's developers that could wrap this
frontend would be appreciated, to see if the current incarnation of
the design fits their needs. Of course, the primary goal is to make it
work for QGIS, but flexibility is a good thing, IMO.

The "design document" is, as always, here:
https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki/QGIS-Processing-Framework
And I have started writing Python stubs, here:
https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/tree/master/python/processing

Please, correct or comment.

Camilo

Ah, ok!

Excuse me for replying on such an old mail, but I only noticed this
mail now (you should really have asked this on the debian-gis or saga
developer list): the next debian package will include python support.
In fact you can already get a source package with python-saga support

mmmmh....if I don't copy the modules into Resources/python folder, plugins
or others doesn't run properly.

For example I'm using sqlalchemy, PIL and reportlab, and, if I don't copy
the module into Qgis, the plugin cannot be opened...And I test it on few
machines: mac mini, mac book pro, imac...

Odd.  site-packages should be in the sys.path, so the plugin should find and import those modules.

I have postponed this because QApplication::setGraphicsSystem() was
introduced in  Qt 4.5 and we require Qt4.4.

then, when I launch Qgis this is the message:

https://picasaweb.google.com/mandoluca/QgisPython#5605539330496554130

If I copy the modules into the python folder under qgis all run properly.

It's very strange!

I installed all modules into MacPython not into system python.

What do you think about it?

Best regards

Luca

That's the problem.  My QGIS is built to use the system Python, so it doesn't see the MacPython site-packages.  QGIS python is not normal python use where a module can be used across different python builds as long as they're the same version (more or less), QGIS includes its own python interpreter, via the Python framework, thus is hardwired to a specific build of Python.

Install your modules in the system site-packages in /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages.

Does it help if you change QgsApplication to QApplication? If not, you
are doing probably something wrong, like having a global or static
variable inherited from QWidget which tries to initialize itself
before the application actually starts.

It works in release mode. I think there is nothing wrong with my
implementation. The problem is QGIS does not include debug information. I
solved the problem by building QGIS source in debug mode. 
Thanks for your reply.

I have been trying hard to find how to get access to the object I stored in a QMultiMap container. I am able to retrieve the numbered keys but when I try accessing the object QGIS crashes. 

I have done similar work in plain C++ and it has worked with out any problem, I used regualr multimap before. Here I tried both QT multimap and regualr multimap and while trying to access the second item in the iterator QGIS seems to give up. Any help will be appreciated. I have pasted a piece of the code below,? ? 


?? typedef QMultiMap<long,QgsPoint> mmaplngQPt;
// QgsPoint map iterator objects
? ?typedef mmaplngQPt::iterator maplngQPtit1, maplngQPtit2;
? ?mmaplngQPt::iterator Pt1Qmapit, Pt2Qmapit,itQlow, itQup;
? ?typedef pair < long, QgsPoint >? QPt_pair;
? ?mmaplngPt mapQPt,mapQPt0,mapQPt1;
? ?mmaplngPt::iterator mapQPtit;
? ?long iKey;
? ?int lbx,ubx;
? QgsPoint vx;

? ?itQlow=mapQPt.lowerBound (lbX);
? ?itQup=mapQPt.upperBound (ubX);

? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?for ( mapQPtit=itQlow ; mapQPtit != itQup; mapQPtit++ ) 
? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?{

? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?txtStream <<"key = "<<itQlow.key()<<endl;
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? iKey = (QPt1mapit).key();
? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?vx = (QPt1mapit).value();

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?}



The program crashes write after it prints the key value. By the way any way of finding a meaningful error message in QGIS?

Thank you,

QtSvg

New maintainer required
Reasoning: SVG Full (as opposed to SVG Tiny) functionality available in

He points to QtWebkit which have a full SVG implementation instead of 
the QtSvg's SVG Tiny

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Contributions for improved QGIS OSM viewer plugin
Message-ID: <1305236675.6949.59.camel@mk-desktop-smh>

Hi,
I would like to ask those interested in OSM viewing with QGIS, to
contribute to an improved QGIS  viewer of OpenStreetMap data, in form of
a python plugin and, if needed, some modification in the trunk.

Recently I received several private emails asking me to share my
experience and/or files related to viewing OpenStreetMap data in QGIS.
"One image is worth a thousand words"... I have just put 5 improved
renderings of OSM data here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_data_rendered_with_QGIS
It uses the rule-based renderer (which just received support of symbol
levels in 1.7.0) and osm2postgresql. More details on the method used
here:  http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Using_OpenStreetMap_data

The roadmap could be as follows:

1. Slightly modify the existing plugin as follows:

1a. while opening an .osm file, store the data in a format (let's assume
spatialite, but could be other type) that allows long strings (shp/dbf
have a 254 characters limitation)

1b. in the spatialite files, store in a single field named "tags" all
the concatenated tags for each feature.
Should look like this:
"access"="private", "amenity"="parking", "parking"="underground"
This example is how I manage this node:
http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/989971901

(The comma can be replaced by any separator, even a space; comma is for
readability for humans).

(Optionally here, we can drop the following tags: "source",
"modified_by", "edited_with" and the like. The shorter, the best
performance and the smaller the files).

1c. remove all points that are left with no tags after dropping these
tags (those are just vertices or noise)

1d. store the "name" tag in a "name" field (for labelling).

1e. do not store roundabouts as polygons but as ways (this is the most
common problem generated by the plugin when assuming that closed ways
are polygons; this is impossible to have a nice rendering of polygonized
roundabouts).

1f. put the required layers in a single group layer

1g. automatically apply a set of .qml files

The alternative to the above (1) is to use my osm2postgresql bash script
(this requires a linux box; the script installs the server if not done
yet; one of its advantages is correct management of polygons with holes
and good performance at the country level).

2. Distribute the .qml files I created with the plugin or with QGIS (no
idea of what is best)

3. Distribute  with the plugin or with QGIS the icons I generated (no
idea of what is best).
(Optionally: ask [again] SJJB management icon authors to backport svg
bug fixes and share related bash scripts)

Ideally: for 2 and 3, think of how people would contribute their
alternative OSM rendering using the QGIS OSM plugin.


I would really appreciate collaboration of at least one python developer
for (1-2-3), and [if needed] of a QGIS core developer for (2) and (3).
I have very little experience with QGIS python plugins. Since I do this
on my spare time only (to prepare my hiking maps), without help this
will take ages and I have little personal interest in doing so (it
already works on my machine, so...). Also, I could put my .qml on
rapidshare, my .svg on openclipart and my bash script to create the svg
on the qgis wiki... but I won't, since those solutions add a lot of
hassle in data and code management and do not deliver what I would like
to contribute to:
"Fast, easy and beautiful on the fly rule-based rendering of OSM maps"
Cf. http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222

I would like to spend time improving the symbology rather than coding
the above 1, 2 and 3, hence my question: anybody interested in
contributing to an improved QGIS OSM viewer plugin?

Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any answer!
Regards,
Mayeul

PS: If we can do the above and test it with the QGIS web client, we
could do a killer demo at the OSM state of the map conference in Vienna
this summer, something like: "Create your Customized Slippy Map in 10
Minutes with QGIS".

As far as I know there is no such facility in QGIS API (as at early versions 1.7)

Perhaps a dev could shed some light on any progress on this matter, if any?

Thanks to all. But when I install QGIS in both, Though QGIS runs smoothly I
could not able to load Grass plugin in both platforms, when I run in "debug"
mode I find out the issue

 Failed to load: /home/kcubedev/binary/lib/qgis/libgrassprovider.so (Cannot
load library /home/kcubedev/binary/lib/qgis/libgrassprovider.so:
(libgrass_gis.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory))

But the file libgrass_gis.so is located in that mentioned location only

Is that again the configuring issue or any other issue ?

Can anyone please support me again  to solve this issue ?

Thanks and Regards,
Sunil

Hi all

I'm currently writing C++ code that I want to use via Python with SIP. 
The following is a skeleton for my code:

    /template<class T>
    class MyClass
    {
    //MyClass//(QString s);
         T* calculate();
    }

    class B
    {
         B();
         void doStuff();
    }

    void B::doStuff()
    {
    //MyClass//<int> var("");
         int *var2 = var.calculate();
    }

    /

The only class I've included in my SIP file is class B (and not class 
A). Everything compiles correctly, but when QGIS starts, I get a Python 
error:

    /  File "/home/goocreations/apps/share/qgis/python/qgis/utils.py",

    /ImportError: /home/goocreations/apps/lib/libqgis_mylib.so.1.7.0:
    undefined symbol: _ZN15//MyClassIiEC1E7QString/

This error seems strange, since I've never included MyClass in the SIP 
files and the only place MyClass is instantiated is in my cpp file (I 
didn't even include the MyClass directory in the cmake file that handles 
the SIP files). So I'm a bit confused  of how Python gives an error on 
code that isn't linked to SIP.

So, I've though that creating a SIP binding for MyClass may resolve the 
issue, but I can't figure out how I would use templates in SIP.

By the may: when I remove the template from MyClass and make everything 
by default int, everything compiles and runs perfectly.

Does anyone have an idea of why this is happening, or if I maybe have to 
include something special in the cmake files?

Thanks

Chris

Hi Sunil

Maybe you should start a new thread since you seem to be talking about
linux issues now.

Some distros require you to add

/usr/lib64/grass64/lib

to your /etc/ld.so.conf

After adding it do

ldconfig

All above need to be done as sudo / root.

Regards

Tim

I don't believe this is true - I followed them on a clean windows a
month or two back and if you follow the instructions everything works
seamlessly.

If you have specific reproducable issues please post them here so that
we can improve the instructions further.

Don't know the technical details, but (thanks T?ni)
https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/InstallationIssues pointed to:

After compilation, locate your libutil lib on Natty:
/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libutil.so

Now do

LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libutil.so
export LD_PRELOAD
now run Qgis

Strange thing is that the nightly builds of qgis run fine...
So apparently I miss some linking magic ???

I remember some discussions at the lisbon hackfest about templated c++
code and difficulties wrapping it with sip. Martin Dobias probably
know more, but I would add that we generally avoid template
programming in QGIS as it isnt very 'Qt' like, and also isnt very
consistent with the rest of our api.

Tim

SIP refers to template classes as "mapped types". Here you can find
some documentation:

No, the constructor is available and correct.
If this wasn't the case, the code wouldn't have compiled when I remove 
the templates and replace it with int.

some time ago our community create a set of styles and projects for
beautiful OSM maps in QGIS. Can find more info at

Finally I fixed all the errors.

May be some of them help you to improve the instructions. 
(If I can reproduce the errors I will give detailed information about them)

- SIP error(mentioned early in this thread)
- Missing environment variable definitions(for Python, CMake, etc.)
- python import errors(especially about pyqt)
- If SVNVERSION not found. You have to create a "svnversion.h" file and
define SVNVERSION "something".
- Pyton25_d.dll is missing (if you want a debug build)
- sqlite3 version is inappropriate. (sqlite3_int64, sqlite3_openv2, etc.
unresolved externals. I found the correct version and add those definitions
to the related file manually.)
- "qwt_polar_xx files not found" errors.
- After the build operation is completed, QGis1.7.0 still needs some files
in OSGEOW. You have to copy them manually to the installation folder.

thanks for sharing this.
this brings me back to one very interesting (to me) question: would
anybody be interested in building up a style/symbol installer repo and
plugin, much in the style of the plugin installer? I think lots of users
have their own custom styles and symbols, and many would like to share
them.
This would be a major improvement for QGIS IMHO.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] succesfull windows build from INSTALL text
Message-ID: <4DCD4E9D.4040308@duif.net>

Hi All,

playing with a clean windows xp virtual machine on my laptop, I thought
to test/try the windows build instructions from the INSTALL text...

My compliments for this documentation!!!!

Following the
    4.1.1. Visual C++ Express Edition
route within I think 2 hours I had a working basis qgis in my Virtual XP
running :-)

Some remarks:

- the INSTALL text seems more up to date than the instructions on
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Building_QGIS_from_Source
For example the INSTALL text already mentions the GIT stuff etc
Should we not delete the wiki page, and for example just point to the
INSTALL text?

- I never used GIT on windows, but googled msysgit
http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
which gives you a command line and I could do:
git clone https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git
which worked...

- INSTALL states:
"You will also either need to add all the dependency DLLs to the QGIS
install directory or add their respective directories to your PATH."
I did, but those are 39 dll's :-)
I think the PATH command would be nice (though I'm aware of the risk of
conflicting dll's etc ...)

- packaging:
The packaging instructions are not clear to me. After compiling running
it on windows, how to package it on ubuntu (for a 'real' windows user).
What's the reason to not do it on windows itself?

- 32/64 bit
Just tested this on 32-bit XP. Which worked fine!! Not sure if this
would work on a 64 bit machine, or all links are then still working.

- starting: after the install step in Visual Studio Express, all
installed successfully in 'Program Files', but double clicking the
executable (the windows way), I do not have Python stuff working.
Using the cmake-start bat file (which set's all path's) I have a fully
working python/qgis.
Does somebody know what I have to copy/include/change to make the double
clicking work?


Ok, thanks for these great build docs! Maybe my remarks can make them
even better ;-)

Regards,

Richard

ok, we update the wiki page now and then.

You could also have used cygwin - Windows is pretty useless without it anyway
;)

Patch QGIS to include all the environment variables etc. the batch files set
up.  I'd stick with the batch file as that's easier to customize.

Your guide worked well for me, thanks.

In the official repository I have created a new branch
'browser-and-customization' that contains all the work we (Radim and
me) presented on the hackfest in Lisbon. We will do some cleanups
there, then merge it to master and continue polishing it there.

Hi all,
For the fans of QGis globe, a good news, Thanks to Marco Hugentobler?s 
idea of using Mutex, QGIS Globe now runs in Trunk. It is an experiment 
waiting for multithreading but it actually works ok :) here [1] more

Hi,
In fact the issues 1)a,b,c,d are OK in the latest plugin (sorry).
Still there are two main problems left, the roundabout issue plus a bug
in base code (see http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3825)

1h. (that I forgot to mention): OSM plugin imports data as lat-long, but
while using "map unit" for the symbology the minimum value authorized by
QGIS is 0.01 degree (about 800 meters at longitude 45) which is much too
wide for any regional or city map, even for motorways. Working with map
units is the best way to have continuous zoom, and this is what I most
often do in my styles (hence with metric projection only).
So to have nice symbology with the OSM plugin, we need to reproject the
data (UTM) or to fix above bug (would be better).

I guess changing the "map unit" maximum resolution should be trivial...
but this need to be done in QGIS 1.7.0 as rules-based renderer in main
1.8.0 does not have support for symbol levels.
Is there any interest from authorized committers to support/implement
this kind of code change in 1.7.0?

(Working on the 1g), 2) and 3) steps can be done manually by the final
user, but automatizing this would be nice).

Thanks for your feedback!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OSM viewer / sample styles online
Message-ID: <1305381546.6259.37.camel@mk-desktop-smh>

Hi,
I've put online a sample .qgs project file with OSM dataset and
advanced/multi-scale qml styling (for 1.7.0 only), mainly ways, for
Monte Lema (on Italian/Swiss border):
http://www.mediafire.com/?jiooxkbmyzgr0
(File: OSM_Lema.zip)

The svg are harder to package and I have not updated this online (I must
dig for them and do not know what instructions to give for linking them)
so nodes will not be displayed well and I do not know what will happen
with ways with svg markers.
Additionally, some complex polygons were not correctly
converted from postgis to sqlite, but I attached what I could.
DEM and contour lines are much bigger, so not attached.
Hence this is more for you to see the technical organisation than the
final rendering, which you can see here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_data_rendered_with_QGIS
Hopefully a slightly modified OSM plugin will make this work in one
click!
I used osm2postgresql to produce the original dataset.

Regards,
Mayeul

PS: For now, those styles and derived works are (c) Mayeul Kauffmann
CC-by-SA (similar to OSM maps and data). If this goes to the trunk, I'll
re-release with a more permissive licence if needed. I have already
released all the icons I created for this in the public domain.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SRS: "EPSG:40003" and QGIS
Message-ID: <1305385051296-6363104.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hi all,
I hope this is the right ml to write about SRS and QGIS.

In QGIS 1.6-1.8 there is SRS: "EPSG:40003". It's a special SRS useful to set
"Monte Mario to WGS 84 transformation". The Domain of Validity is Sicily (in
Italy). Here is the EPSG detail:
http://bit.ly/kYk4WB

In QGIS we have for it:
"+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
+units=m +towgs84=-50.2,-50.4,84.8,-0.690,-2.012,0.459,-28.08 +no_defs"

This seems written starting from EPSG:3003 definition (Italy zone 1) -
"+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
+units=m +no_defs" - but Sicily is (almost) entirely inside EPSG:3004 (Italy
zone 2).

My question is: what do you think to insert in QGIS SRS list also a 40004
definition? This one: "+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=2520000
+y_0=0 +ellps=intl +units=m
+towgs84=-50.2,-50.4,84.8,-0.690,-2.012,0.459,-28.08 +no_defs".

The difference is in "+x_0" parameter.

I'm not a SRS guru, and probably I'm wrong.

Best regards,

a

Message-ID: <BANLkTinwFCkGgqVOY5qL-1fUw+sfassOuw@mail.gmail.com>

Just out of curiosity, how is the QGIS Symbology Changing crashing issue
coming along?

I just tested out Kyng's latest QGIS 1.7 r15814 for Snow Leopard (64bit
Intel Qt 4.7 Cocoa<http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/qgis/Qgis-r15814-snow.dmg>)
 [with all req. dep.]
and found the same hard crashing of QGIS when changing symbology of a
feature.

I noticed there is an Active Ticket on this issue
#3380<https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3380>

Any hope for QGIS users on Mac in the near future?

Thanks a lot!

WARNING ! libtiff version mismatch : You're linking against libtiff 3.X
but GDAL has been compiled against libtiff >= 4.0.0"

The guys from orfeo toolbox seems  to have the same issue since about
11th of May, when "gdal 1.8 debian package has been pushed to
ubuntugis-unstable repository for all ubuntu versions." The consequence
being "the otb packages cannot open a TIFF any more". See:
http://bugs.orfeo-toolbox.org/view.php?id=296


Installed is: libtiff4-dev (3.9.4-5ubuntu6)

The only non standard repositories that I use are those 3:
deb http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu natty main #Third party developers
repository
deb http://qgis.org/debian-nightly natty main
deb-src http://qgis.org/debian-nightly natty main


I installed qgis following the INSTALL guide, and my following home-made
script to automate downloading and compile:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Talk:Building_QGIS_from_Source


Other related link (with posts from Andreas Neumann) which mentions the
problem of code linking to libtiff 3.x (not sure whether it is
relevant):
http://osgeo-org.1803224.n2.nabble.com/gdal-dev-mod-python-issue-with-libtiff-td5639239.html

Anybody Natty user managed to compile latest release-1_7_0 this weekend
after doing an apt-get update & upgrade and dist-upgrade?

Thanks,
Mayeul

I could not reproduce the problem here, so I need a bit more input to zero
in on the cause.

could you be more specific about the input data format (e.g., was the
input file a 1-bit image,  8 bit, or a RGB image, ...), and what
compression option was chosen? 

Seeing the "gdalinfo" output for input and output files could also be helpful.
  
Also, how did you arrive at the 1go vs 100mo figure?

Thank you,

hm - this is bad. SVG is quite essential for QGIS and its relation to
Inkscape and other vector graphics tools.

I don't think that QtWebkit would be a good enough replacement for
QtSVG. It is certainly much more capable for rendering than QtSVG, but
QGIS also needs QtSVG for writing. I don't think that QtWebkit could
handle that.

Maybe someone from the QGIS project could be the new maintainer of the
QtSVG code and improve it to our needs?

It would definitely worth having a look at other SVG libraries, such as
QtWebkit, librsvg, Inkscape or others, but it at the end it has to be a
read/write solution, not just a read solution.

I personally have a good understanding of SVG, but I am not a C++
programmer. I probably would be able to support an SVG effort
financially if someone could work on it.

hi!

I am completely with andreas..
As I am also involved in the austrian OSM Community I heard a lot about 
"missing" SVG support in QGIS to rework maps..
(make maps in QGIS and rework them in inkscape for e.g.)
It would be a big loss for QGIS if we have to drop SVG Support. 
Especially the write support..
Cartographers love the SVG feature of QGIS ..

The only thing i can offer is to do a lot of testing if someone is 
willing to take over the svg part in the qt project.

regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Redmine Migration Status
Message-ID: <BANLkTin1hc5xhQ8bBquJqyz0u-BCK+OyMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Just to give some feedback. I tried to migrate trac to redmine this
weekend. It looks like the process will be quite straighforward since
we can migrate teh old tickets into a new redmine project (in an
existing db). However I got stuck with trying to get the pg gem
installed inside bitnami (I am using a redmine bitnami portable
appliance for testing). I think its because my bitnami appliance is
32bit and the host is 64 bit. Unfortunately I wont be able to work on
it much again till next weekend...which means the 1.7 call for
packaging is still on hold for now. If anyone would like to have a go,
Alex Mandel has made a test trac dump available so please feel free.

My apologies for the delay.

Regards

this is not so bad IMHO: we still have a number of critical bugs, and we better not
release in this state.

Message-ID: <BANLkTikTbK4=C0r=P0_iWq3s-pE4n_+SaA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to build the qgis1.7.0 from source on Windows. I am using VS
2005.
I followed the steps listed in "Building QGis From Source". When I start the
build
process with "RelWithDebugInfo" configuration settings it generates the
following errors:

1. When it tries to build the python plugings (fTools_tools,
GdalTools_tools, mapserver_export, osmplugin & plugin_installer)
in the qgis-trunk\build\python\plugins directory it gives the following
error for each plugin:

Error result 1 returned from 'C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe'

2. Also when building the "compile_python_files" project it gives the
following error:

A tool returned an error code from "Performing Post-Build Event..."

When I remove the Command Line parameters in the compile_python_files
Project Properties -> Conf. Properties -> Build Events -> Post-Build Event
The above error dissapears. But is it true to remove these command line
parameters
(They are about cmaking various .py files)

What should I do to solve these build errors? All help will be appreciated.

Carson and all,

Just a update: I haven't forgotten about that patch you sent in,  I
have implemented it and am just working on some extra delete layer logic.
 Hopefully I will release it soon, once I get this uni assignment out of the

Just an Update. Will post to Ticket #3497 also for info.

So I decided to try building QGIS from trunk and give that a try.  Installed
Qt 4.7.3 and all the other dependancies listed
here on the QGIS Wiki: http://is.gd/AdHLiT

Ended up building the latest version of QGIS in trunk: 1.7.0 (1.7.0-Wroclaw
(15870))

Build went fine.

No problems opening shapefiles, spatiallite, postgis, etc.

However, same issue when changing symbology of a layer.  QGIS hard crashes.

Sometimes it crashes on the first time setting symbology, sometimes on the
3rd or 4th time, but early enough.

This issue is actually a little depressing for me because I love using QGIS,
but with out symbology I do find
it rather limiting.

cheers!

Mars

Mars, I also have a problem that bears mentioning here (for QGIS 1.6 and 1.7 trunk). I have had QGIS crash when a layer's symbology had been defined using unique value of a field and that field is not there anymore. Anytime that layer is opened even if it was removed from the project first and added later, it crashes. It also crashes if the layer is renamed, or deleted outside QGIS (when QGIS is not running) and the project is opened not able access it. I think the layer definition and the symbology definition may be placed separately in the project file. (I am not sure exactly.)

I have also seen behaviors that are a bit unusual that some layers are listed first when the project opens up but are not really in the final visible Canvas layer list. I opened the project file and I see the XML data has them as layers but they are not part fo the visible layer. Is this a feature or a bug?

Maaza ? ? ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Feedback from another Workshop
Message-ID: <4DD1D161.9080201@wildintellect.com>

I did a workshop last weekend with 25 mostly "manager" types from around
the world at a seminar on climate change issues in natural resource
management. Here's a little feedback.

Note we used QGIS 1.6 on OSGeo Live 4.5 Virtual Machines.
1. The Vector load dialog seems to confuse some (those of lower
technical aptitude or background). They seemed to prefer the Raster load
dialog method of immediately opening a file browse window. We should
probably spend some time rethinking this dialog.

2. The Histogram for Raster layers does not appear to scale (Y axis
specifically doesn't get small enough) appropriately for a given dataset
and is not user customizable. There's not longer a refresh button (not
sure if that's a problem).

3. The tiny drop down and click+hold to open the drop down for some
toolbar items was not intuitive. Only 1 person in 25 new what to do (to
find the Measure Area) because he had seen it done that way in Arc. <--
This one is already fixed in Trunk/1.7, so good job team for taking the
suggested fix months ago.

4. In the Field calculator when you pick to calculate area it would
really useful to be able to pick the units rather than having to look up
the conversion factor and modify the formula. The fact that's it
converted could be noted in the name Area(ha) - I don't know if ()
characters break columns names in shp and databases but you get the idea.

Overall, no crashes, no major show stoppers just a few minor quirks and
I made sure to tell them that I intended to post their suggestions to
the QGIS team.

Once I get approval on releasing the example data the 2 hour lab + data
will be posted online for others to use.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi,
I mentioned that Ubuntu users cannot open tiffs anymore, on the dev
mailing list 2 days ago [1].
Let's hope someone there knows how to solve this!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin Development on Windows
Message-ID: <BANLkTikdT237Sy93QADNynwuGEfwLy_TOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm trying to develop a plugin for QGIS on Windows 7. I'm using Visual
Studio 2010 to compile. I used the python script to generate the initial
skeleton of the plugin. I can compile it, and obtain the corresponding
dynamic link library.

The problem is that when I put it into the plugins/ directory, it is not
recognized by QGIS (I mean, it doesn't appear in the plugin list, under
"Manage Plugins").

I'm using QGIS 1.7 trunk, from OSGEO.

Do you know what could be happening that prevents the plugin from loading?

Thanks!

Hi Alex,
Thanks a lot! Yes you point to two of my problems, I had first problem
with one of my qgis and another with another qgis:
1) The problem I cannot solve is to compile myself qgis 1.7.0rc knowing
that the gdal I have was upgraded to 1.8.0. Could you please tell me if
you know how to switch back to get gdal 1.7.0 and compile against it?
As I wrote earlier, I detailed the error messages and pointed to my
install script in qgis-developer list, here:
http://osgeo-org.1803224.n2.nabble.com/gdal-1-8-0-no-tiff-support-anymore-in-Ubuntu-11-04-Natty-tc6365327.html

2) The other problem that I somehow solved: I compiled one version a few
weeks ago against gdal 1.7.0; when updating to gdal 1.8.0, I was
proposed to remove  gdal 1.7.0, I did it, which broke this qgis (I could
not find back the right package again; I copied libgdal1.7.0.so.1 from
another machine which is still on Ubuntu 10.10, this solves the issue)

Thanks a lot for your support!

Hi guys,
I was asked by Giovanni to open a ticket probably because he believed
the qgis-developer  list was not the right place to discuss this issue,
and Jurgen closes it because it's invalid and trac is not the right
place to discuss this issue.
What is the right place to discuss gdal packaging breacking QGIS on
Ubuntu, shortly before release?


"please open a ticket (if not already).

Comment:  Looks like a problem with GDAL packaging in the
 [http://trac.osgeo.org/ubuntugis ubuntugis] repository. [jef]

I mentioned this first on qgis-developer:
	"no tiff support anymore in Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty)"

And several users from qgis-user are waiting for an answer.

It seems to me that the appropriate place would be the ubuntugis trac.
Did you file it there ?

Hi Federico,

don't now that much about the cpp plugins, but is it really a cpp plugin
you need? What are your plans with the plugin?

Because it would be easier to make it a Python plugin I think (no fuss
with compiling etc etc).

But if you really have to use cpp: try to ping somebody on IRC

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QBrowser & Customization
Message-ID: <BANLkTikQGw63g_K87s-bOEyxihFeWxVwvA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
we are ready (Martin Dobias and me) to merge browser-and-customization
branch to master.

You can get idea about features in that branch from some snapshots:
https://picasaweb.google.com/radim.blazek/QGISCustomizationQBrowser

Briefly for people who were not present at last HF:

Customization support allows users to disable (hide) parts of QGIS UI.
You can see example of minimal (maximal)  customization of version 1.7
on the first snapshot. It is possible to disable almost any element of
UI: menus, sub menus, toolbars, tools, parts of dialogs, docked
windows and status bar items. UI elements can be switched on/off
either in tree (second snapshot) or interactively in QGIS application
using customization select tool and clicking on UI elements.
Customization is saved in separate settings and can be saved/loaded
to/from file. There is also support for customized packages. If
customization file is included in installation package, it is loaded
the first time QGIS is started.

The QBrowser is intended to be a geographic data resources browser and
manager. Now it is implemented as a stand alone application but we
would like to include it also in QGIS as alternative 'Add layer'
dialog. Currently it is supported only by ogr, gdal and wms providers.
At this moment QBrowser allows you to browse file system (where it
identifies known geographic data) and defined WMS servers (shared with
QGIS). If you select a layer you can view its metadata, preview and
attributes (for vectors). It is possible to assign CRS to a layer (if
supported by provider), create a new shapefile and manage WMS servers.


We would like to discuss some issues with other developers before the merge:

QBrowser:

A1) All the data format specific functionality is implemented in
providers. Each provider which wants to show his data in browser must
implement 2 additional functions:
    QGISEXTERN int dataCapabilities ()
    QGISEXTERN QgsDataItem * dataItem ( QString thePath, QgsDataItem*
parentItem )
The dataCapabilities function says what kind of data is supported
(File,Dir,Database,Net) so that e.g. WMS provider is not called on
files or dirs. The dataItem() function returns QgsDataItem
representing either known geographic resources for given file system
path (gdal, ogr) or top level item (wms). It is important to design
providers interface well, because it may be implemented also by custom
providers and we cannot change it easily in future (after release).
Please look at the QgsDataItem and its children methods and
implementation.

A2) To get access from QBrowser to QgsWMSSourceSelect  via
QgsDataItem, we had to move QgsWMSSourceSelect to wms provider. That
is beginning of providers specific UI migration to providers, which
has been discussed already before and generally accepted. To get
select widget from main application we added in WMS provider another
function:
    QGISEXTERN QgsWMSSourceSelect * selectWidget( QWidget * parent,
Qt::WFlags fl )
Currently it is more or less a hack for QgisApp::addWmsLayer(). We
should probably define some QgsSelect either with methods returning
URI or better signals for add new layer. Currently it is using
signals, because WMS selector can add more layers.

Customization:

B1) The customization dialog tree is using Qt designer icons for
various widgets. It looks nice but it adds 192K to QGIS package. Is it
acceptable or do you prefer tree without icons?

B2) For dialogs, the interactive customization select tool can only be
activated by shortcut (because the dialogs are modal) which has to be
defined for main application. We have used Ctrl+M because it is not
yet used and M is close to right Ctrl. May be we should spare such a
good key for better occasion?

Please let us know your opinion or objections.

For what it's worth, my opinion on B1) is we should have icons.  Good UI is
important and icons help the user relate to items quicker more so then just
a plain text based tree.

Hi devs,

we found that in QgsLabel class there is missed implementation
for setLabelFieldName method. This method listed in header file
src/core/qgslabel.h (line 163) but not listed in .cpp file. Also this
method missed from Python bindings.

This is a bit confusing, regardiong to the API docs this method
exists but in reality it doesn't. May be it is better to remove it
completely?

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] fields = provider.fields() how can i iterate to

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=LtKfch+CNWnD56Ja1HYtQN4AYNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I try to write my first python plugin and i need to iterate a field
list got from the active layer

layer = self.iface.activeLayer() # active layer
		if (layer):
	                provider = layer.dataProvider()
			fields = provider.fields()
			if layer.type() == QgsMapLayer.VectorLayer:
				self.QLEvalore.setText("set value here")
				self.CBfields.clear()
				for field in fields:
					self.CBfields.addItem(field.name())


to get single field name to add to a dialog combobox

How can i get the field name...?

Thank
Marco

Update.

I decided to partition my internal drive and build another Mac OS X Snow
Leopard for testing.
I wanted to rule out any software conflicts that may have been causing my
QGIS to crash on symbology changes

Re-installed Williams's great Framework dependancies and tested his builds
of QGIS with shapefile data from Natural Earth.


   - I noticed that if I TURNED OFF the selections for:
   - Make lines appear less jagged at the expense of some drawing
   performance
   - Fix problems with incorrectly filled polygons
   - Under PREFRENCES/ >OPTIONS window< / RENDERING tab / Rendering quality


The statistical occurrence of QGIS crashing while changing a layers
symbology drops ~50% to 1 in every 4 symbology changes.

The next question, (if I am the only Mac OS X user having these issues), is
if there is some sort of hardware issue?
I ran an the extensive Apple Hardware Test and came up clean..

I'll attach a Hardware Overview FYI.

Normally you would see this message when you are zoomed in too far, so
try zooming out.
BTW I think this question is more suited to the QGIS user mailing list.

Hi Giovanni

There seems to be a general problem with python-mapscript in OSGeo4W. At least 
I could not get it to run in a simple python script on Windows 7 as "import 
mapscript" already fails.

Best regards

Hi Radim

Thank you for the nice work. It would be great to have browser and 
customisation in master branch.
Is it possible to bring the layers from the browsers into a running QGIS 
instance (with drag and drop)? I remember you mentioned it in Lisabon but I 
cannot get it to work.

Agreed, it would be good to have that for other providers too

I also think it is necessary to work with signals here. Normally, add layer 
dialogs work with QgisApp or QgisInterface to do so, but this is not possible 
from provider lib.

Two that I know of are polldaddy.com and the Forms feature of Google Docs:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzgaUOW6GIs

Google Forms are interesting because the results are automagically
recorded to a spreadsheet.


Hope this helps!

Fpoll <http://www.phpfront.com/fpoll.php> is a really simple opensource PHP
polling script that works really nicely.

Google Forms work nice too in certain situations.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] a SQL console as new feature
Message-ID: <BANLkTinFACGiqGmZT1SauBm9sQ_eHV6EbQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Firs,t many thanks to all developers and qgis contributors. Qgis is now
getting very impressive!

I'd like to share an idea that I already shared on SE. See
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/7295/a-sql-console-in-qgis  (A
lecture of the thread could be interesting to understand better).

>From what i've seen, Qgis is designed to perform easily basic operations but
makes it harder for full control operations. Actually, I'm also a mapinfo
and orbisgis user. These two applications presents the big interest (to me)
of having an SQL console, which makes gis user life really better.
Doing it with mapinfo appears to be easier because is only have one
proprietary format to handle. But orbisgis, which is also a foss able to
handle several formats, provides the feature whatever the given source is
(shapefile, mapinfo, postgis, ...).

On SE, Nathan Woodrow supported the idea and already had few thoughts about
developing such a feature. See his blog :
http://woostuff.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/the-things-i-would-like-to-see-in-qgis-what-are-yours/

Could someone tell me about qgis developer team interest regarding that?

Many thanks,

simo

Hi, 

The osgeo installer has now pushed me along to 1.8 (is there an easy way back to 1.7?). 

I'm now seeing this error flying past many, many times at great speed: 

"Try setting the GDAL_DATA environment variable to point to the 
directory containing EPSG csv files. 
Unable to open EPSG support file gcs.csv." 

I think GDAL_DATA should be %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\share\gdal 
but I do not know where it should be set. 

Any suggestions?

I get this too on OSGeo4W Windows 7 64-bit. I thought it had something to do

this means that the plugin works only (under Windows) with mapserver

Hi all,
I'm starting to work on DBManager plugin for QuantumGIS.

I've just created the repository on GitHub [1] and here's [2] a page on the
QGis wiki
containing ideas I wrote in the past few days. I will add weekly reports to
that wiki page.

Any comments and reviews are very welcome.

I tried two plugins with a slightly different cose and and I get the same response. I wish it would go away, but wishing does not help here. So I need your expert help.

I find that the canvas object (QgisInterface pointer) loses its data as it passes the layers to processing method. What could cause this? I know the same sort of code works for a single layer data. Any ceiling it has reached? Did I hit the stone/steel wall or am I in need of training. I wish there was an ebook or something that explains these challenges. It would have made my work easier. But I have to be a sleuth and try to find a work around this glass ceiling. 

Any ideas, suggestions?

Hi.

First of all, IMO, the DBManager has to be implemented in QGIS core,
not as a plugin for two main reasons:
1) it is core functionality
2) connection factories MUST go to providers, otherwise you start to
create a set of plugins for each DB, parallel to providers.

>From UI point of view, I would prefer to have everything in one place,
that means in QBrowser. We can rename QBrowser to QManager and
suddenly it sounds more logical. Having everything in one tree will
allow in future to easily drag-and-drop for example Shapefile to
PostGIS and so on. We have to add support for other providers to
QBrowser anyway. It does not make sense to have another similar UI
just for databases, implemented in a different way. Currently QBrowser
is a stand alone application but it will be integrated also to QGIS
main application.

QgsDataItem probably is not the best place where db connections should
be implemented, but it is good place where they can be used to
represent databases in QgsBrowserModel and thus in QBrowser. I can
imagine a QgsDatabase inherited by QgsPostGis, QgsSqlite etc. with all
the methods you list on [2]. Then a single QgsDatabaseItem (which
would inherit from QgsDataItem) could represent any DB provider,
taking as parameter a QgsDatabase child for specific provider.

I not agree, it's a GUI functionality. We can implement all the core stuff
in the
qgis core creating API for reuse of code (I think about connections, as it
was done
in WMS provider) and then accessing that from the plugin, but I don't like
the idea
to have DBManager in C++.

I agree with you about this point, as you can see I added yesterday the
QgsDataItem section to the wiki.

QBrowser is a standalone application, a C++ application, I think the manager
should
be easily maintainable and IMHO python code is the best solution.

That is not a problem, that feature could be implemented in providers, an
import
method which take a QgsMapLayer (this was in my gsoc proposal yet), but have

everything in core without any real and strong reason could make the core
code
hard to maintain.

We have to add support for other providers to

QBrowser it's implemented as a C++ standalone application to browse files
and
show information about layers, but those are the same infos you can get
using QGis.

The manager would make easy the use of databases in QGis, but not for QGis
use
only. Ok, we can show preview, load a layer in canvas, but also run queries,

create/edit/drop tables and views, ... pretty different from the QBrowser
aim!

I think all the qgis-devs should say their opinion about this question
raised by Radim.

I attended the GSoC 2009 for a different FOSS project and after I started to
work
on my _accepted_ project all devs said me that they didn't like my project,
so my
code was set aside and left on a branch and my GSoC was set as failed even
if I had
ended coding = no gsoc shirt :'( and no money for the second coding period
:(

I don't want to work again on something that devs don't like,
so please devs, I need your opinion. Thanks.

Regards.

Hi All,

This is the vision I have for QGIS when it comes to layer handling:  One
unified tree that can handle both files (vector and raster) and database
connections (to any database).  It should be built into QGIS and live in the
dock just like the layers widget.  IMO the QBrowser would end up like this,
just the tree part not the metadata stuff (or have it on demand), and having
the DBManager part of the QBrowser would achieve my unified tree vision.

At the moment how there are 10 different ways to open layers and databases
is not good for usability, and the QBrowser is a good step towards fixing
this issue.  If the DBManager was part of QBrowser then there would only be
one place to go and open any kind of the layer and would remove a lot of
confusion and code.  I have never seen any other GIS app get this right but
I think QBrowser+DBManger integrated into QGIS as a single tree would be a
great win.

Just my thoughts.

I executed that pull request.  One thing I'd like to note is that when having
unpulled/unpushed commits, we should use git pull --rebase to update the tree.
That way those commits will be reverted before the pull and reapplied after the
pull, so that the pull (merge) can be fast-forwarded.

Otherwise there will be a "Merge from 'master'" commit, that in turn needs to
be pulled back in later.  And that unnecessarily inflates our history and IMHO
makes changes hard to track.

For that reason I'd like us to reject such pull requests in the future.  But
not being that experienced with git (or github) yet, I wonder what better
approaches are there to deal with this.  How do other projects deal with that?

Hi all.
We have two lists of translators:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/GUI_Translation_Progress#Translators_List
and the file TRANSLATORS in the source code.
Why this duplication?
Keep them in sync is painful and error prone. Can we drop the wiki page and point to
the code instead?
All the best.

No. QBrowser is just one use of QgsBrowserModel which was developed
also as model for possible substitution of various "select layer"
dialogs. It does not support many providers at moment, so we did not
want to push it to QGIS yet, we are waiting also for user's reactions.
Definitely it is not only file browser. You can also view WMS servers
and manage them directly in QBrowser (if you select WMS root item).
Databases can be managed in a similar way.

Important is the QgsBrowserModel and support for the model in
providers. Another dialog with a tree view only can be easily created:

  mModel = new QgsBrowserModel( treeView );
  treeView->setModel( mModel );

The QBrowser is not intended to be a data viewer, the preview may be
useful to get quick info, for example _before_ you add a layer to
QGIS.

Create/edit/drop tables and views is exactly what I would like to have
also in QBrowser. But not only tables! I would like to have a
possibility to move/copy layers between various databases, files or
other resources, e.g. drag a WMC layer to RasterLite. Why queries
could not be done in QBrowser or something similar? IMO the QBrowser
and the PostGIS Manager are very similar. A tree on the left + tools
to work with data. QBrowser currently for OGR,GDAL,GRASS, WMS and
PostGIS Manager for PostGIS. It seems natural to me to merge them into
one tool.

The QBrowser / QgsBrowserModel is still work in progress, we don't
have exact ideas how it should look like, it can go in various
directions.

Hi Giuseppe

Similar to Radim, I'd prefer to have an integration with QBrowser and its 
model.
Since the browser classes are in the source tree, they are easy to distribute 
also as C++ code.

Marco

as I wrote, it's ok for me to use the QgsBrowserModel and QgsDataItem to
create the tree,
in fact I added it to the wiki yesterday.

I also want to improve providers adding the import layer functionality to
allow to
move/copy layers between different providers and I had wrote that to my
proposal.

What I don't like it's to create DBManager as a C++ plugin or just as a
QBrowser
extension. Python code is easily maintainable, furthermore the
QBrowser/DBManager
won't do heavy computation, so is there a good reason to develop it using
C++
instead of python?

Regards.

 Since the browser classes are in the source tree, they are easy to

Yes, I believe this is related to bug  Ticket
#3497<https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3497>
-  https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3497

I have reported similar issues with no resolve at this point on Mac OS X
from 1.6 - Latest 1.7

I believe this may account for a low uptake on the Mac OS X side,
considering that a bug report is usually a very very small percentage of
users that will actually report rather than just delete and move on.

Thank you for reporting!

And please report your findings on the Bug Tracker link above,
you will need to register freely if you have not already.

I am wondering about maintenance and in my opinion if the source is C++ ,  it will be easier to maintain if the dbmanager is also c++.

Hi Radim and devs,

I can use the QgsBrowserModel, no problem about this.

Create/edit/drop tables and views is exactly what I would like to have

Allowing to run queries on database requires a lot of code in the provider
and also
out of them, I should export methods to call the query, to get results, a
class to
map results, exceptions. Furthermore IMHO it's not good to implement this
into
providers as they was thought to work with layers.

I couldn't use the QtSql module because its drivers are not in sync with
database APIs used in providers.
So, how do you think I can achieve this?

In python instead pyspatialite is compiled againist the same sqlite version
used by QGis. I don't know if it's the same for psycopg2, but anyway
postgres
API is enough stable.

This is on my gsoc proposal, so don't worry, obviously I will develop it
into providers.

AFAICS looking at the code, in this moment would be easier to merge together

QBrowser, RT_Sql_layer, SL_manager and PG_manager in this order, instead
of merge them in the opposite way.

Will it able to do the coffee?? :)

I'm pretty sure most of you, devs, knows qgis better than me.
I hope we could reach enough point of views and re-design all before
tomorrow evening,
so the day after tomorrow I can start coding.

All your opinions and ideas are very welcome.
Cheers.

Hi,

I recall that the error had something related with the TOC. Since the
TOC has been upgraded to included nested groups and multiple layer
selection the error seems to have gone.


On another note: what does your plugin? do you plan to contribute it?


Cheers

Afternoon all,

I am interested in adding the IAU2000 projection information to qGIS.  I
have the projection information in wkt format (compiled for GDAL).

What steps can I take to get this projection information incorporated into
qGIS?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <1306266608.12688.161.camel@sibirica>

Hi all (but especially Radim and Martin),

is the new qgis browser supposed to already preview correctly wms and
GRASS layers or it is still an ongoing work?

I can preview only shapes/tiffs/etc.

WMS layers show the metadata but no layer preview. GRASS
locations/mapsets are seen as normal files.

Cheers

Looking around the forums and options it looks like there is, but I

Tim,

One step but not exactly what Simon is referring to IMO.   In MapInfo you
have a layer of SQL that you can run on any data type, eg Select * From A,B
WHERE a.obj intersects Bobj

A can be a native MapInfo table and B can be a shape file that you have
opened, or a csv or anything.  This gives the user a lot of power to join
anything to anything and not just on data but spatially.  This is more what
Simon is talking about IMO.  I think it can be done in QGIS just the hardest
thing is supporting all the different providers, but this SQL would another
layer above what is already there and would really only have to talk to
QgsFeature and QgsGeometry as they have everything it needs.

Hi,
For what it's worth I get this message reasonably often at the moment,
so I'd be more inclined to think it was _caused_ by the changes to the
TOC.  I imagine the same message could have been produced by several
different underlying problems though.

I know I get it when simply changing symbologies, but I think once or
twice I've got it doing other things.  I'm currently using a very
complex project with a lot of layers and rule based rendering with a lot
of rules.

Thanks Giovani for the response. I am developing a network modeling tool that analyzes a roadway bicycle transportation based on a classification scheme that we came up with. I have done routing for walk access to transit in the past and I am looking forward to porting that also to QGIS. But right now the modeling tool uses three sets of data (edge/vertex relationship) and using a network Voronoi algorithm (it is a sort of modified Tarjan/Dijkstra) to produce a demographic based trip matrix. 

I would be delighted to contribute it, as long as the sponsoring agency, Mineta Transportation Institute (at San Jose State University) does not have problems with it. I am assuming they would be very happy to have a wider circulation for the work. I am grateful for this project, and I have come to enjoy using QGis and programming with it very much.

I have done the routing using pure C++ before, and I find that to be extremely productive and meets the challenges of processing large amounts of data. I have written a couple of network processing plugins using Python and they took a lot of time to run. But now that I am a bit proficient with C++ plugins in QGIS it is very fast sometimes it is too fast to compare with Python. This goes even for ArcGIS and VB (I have done some programming inside Esri Software also). 

My suggestion for any data intensive work and one that would stay long, one should use C++.
?
What should I do with the error? Why is it happening, I am using QGis version 1.6. I am compiling from the  1.7? trunk.

Thank you for your help,

Maaza?

Hi,

I recall that the error had something related with the TOC. Since the
TOC has been upgraded to included nested groups and multiple layer
selection the error seems to have gone.


On another note: what does your plugin? do you plan to contribute it?

Jef also suggested we could use a memory layer with features without
geometries to
return the result of a query.

Guys, we have to re-design the all the providers if we choose to follow this
way!
Help would be very appreciated, I need it.
This is a very big task but it could make a difference! :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Different Label engines in Qgis not speaking with
	each other?
Message-ID: <4DDC9A1A.90308@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

(using trunk version on ubuntu natty, but seen in other versions too)

answering a question about scale dependent labels in qgis ()  on the
users-list, I was pointed to a toolbar icon I never used before... the
[ABC]/labeling button.

I had two layers, both (correctly) scale dependent labeling configured
in the (for me) normal way: via Layer/properties/labeling tab.

Using the [ABC] button after that, I do not see my own set of labeling
properties, and changing the labeling settings there  (setting label
colors) , nothing changed..

So Questions from a user standpoint:

- can somebody afirm this?

- what is the difference between the two labeling routes (I think to
remember that the [ABC] button was a more advanced labeling engine.. but
not sure)?

- are they aware of each other?

- should/can the be combined? If yes: this is a buggy, if no: should the
user not be warned about this?

- shouldn't we try to merge them, or remove one of the routes?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard

The 'abc' labelling is the new labelling engine and it's planned to remove the 
old one (the one that currently is in the vector prop. dialog) soon.

Marco

ok, thanks, and apparently they are completely independent, I see now...

The reason the label color was not changing in my test was just because
I was looking at the 'old' labeling engines labels and changing
properties of the new labeling without seeing them: I did not yet choose
one of the attribute names in the 'Field with labels' dropdown (and... I
did not check the checkbox 'Label this layer' immediately ...)

My view as a (monkey)user:
- IF a user pushes the [ABC] button, please initialise the dialog with
'Label this layer' checked, and the first item of the 'Field with
labels' chosen.
In this way you are at least aware that (at the moment) there are two
labelling engines, AND you see labels immediately without too much clicking

Subject: [Qgis-developer] URI
Message-ID: <BANLkTimbeOucwxq8D+tTjR4DR1Wu_bF5_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I would like to discuss possible change of providers URI format.

Motivation:
- Each provider is using a different way to store additional parameters in URI
- Some providers (WMS) even don't store all parameters in URI and
require extra methods to add a new layer: addRasterLayer(
rasterLayerPath, baseName, providerKey, layers, styles, format, crs )
- provider key is not part of URI, so the current URI is not
sufficient to be used as QMimeData for drag and drop of layers to
legend.

Current URI formats:
OGR: data_source|layer_name
GDAL: file_path
PostGIS, SQLAnywhere, SQLite : space separated list of key=value
pairs, using QgsDataSourceURI
WMS: service URL + set of params which are not in URI
GRASS raster: file path to cellhd
GRASS vector: path_to_vector/layernumber_layertype
GPX: file_path?type=type
Delimited text, Memory: URL - using QUrl

Some possible solutions:
1) minimal:
  - add WMS additional params somehow to URI + parsing in WMS provider
(it is not clear to me why it was not done this way when WMS was
implemented)
  - encode / decode provider key + uri as single string only for drag and drop
2) maximal A:
  - use QUrl for all providers with providers key as scheme
3) maximal B:
  - use modified QgsDataSourceURI (it is not generic, works with set
of known params only) for all params including provider key

Other issues:
  - should it be possible to pass via URI also layer style hints?
  - how the QGIS should recognize layer type of a dropped URI? Should
it be a param in URI or the QGIS should recognize that from a provider
key (asking provider)?
  - what mime type should be used for QGIS URIs?

Simon,

I was having a look around today and it seems uDig do some like MapInfo in
regards to SQL.  uDig uses CQL (Comman Query Language) that is part of the OGC
Catalog specification <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat>.  I'm
going to check out the code for uDig to see how they have done it and see if
something can be done like that in QGIS.

http://udig.refractions.net/confluence/display/EN/Common+Query+Language

<http://udig.refractions.net/confluence/display/EN/Common+Query+Language>I'll
keep you posted on progress.

Hi Giuseppe

Why not integrate the gui into QBrowser? From a user point of view, it is 
easier to manage the datasources with one application instead having one for 
files, one for databases, one for webservices. I'm not as deep into the topic 
as Martin or Radim (but you asked for the opinions of all devs).

C++ is even more easily maintainable :-). We have a lot of useful functions in 
python plugins that would have been integrated into app/analysis/core/gui if 
they were written in C++. 
 
Is there a good reason to develop in python? The great benefit of python code 
is that you can easily share plugins without the need to compile on every 
platform. But in the case of QBrowser, it is already in the source tree, so no 
problems with distribution.

Just my 2 cents. It's ultimately your mentor (Martin) that has to decide.

Regards,
Marco

I agree, just one GUI to manage everything.
But QBrowser doesn't refactor GUIs to have a more integrated interface, it
just
re-uses the QGis GUIs. So the surplus value is only the QgsBrowserModel.

I'm talking about GUI, not core or re-usable code which obviously it's
better have
them in C++.

However we should consider to integrate useful python plugins in qgis code,
porting
their base functions to C++ if necessary. I think we should create a todo
list and
roadmap for that.

Just my 2 cents. It's ultimately your mentor (Martin) that has to decide.

dev-team to help me ;)

He has to decide, but if we all discuss a better alternative he could opt
for that, or
in any case we can collect these information for directing our efforts in
future
development.
We should start to think to API for the 2.0!

Reuse existing gui components sounds good to me.

See above, gui components can be reusable too. Furthermore, we don't know now 
what will be reusable in the future.
I'm not against python at all. I just think that if there are not strong 
arguments for doing it in python, we should do it in C++ (not the other way 
round). You have more flexibility in future to reuse your code.

+1. However, it is very hard to motivate people to port code.

Marco

hi devs!

Just because I read an article about upcoming versions of Qt right now
(Qt4.8 leading to Qt5.0) ..
The devs at Qt will use gerrit [1] as a tool for code review ..

I only wanted to bring that to your attention - probably that is also
something for us?

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=pNiW6dwahAhkosMiSkk5qioYWXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All (especially Andreas)

I have migrated the web client into GIT:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-web-client

It can be anonymously cloned using:

git clone git://github.com/qgis/qgis-web-client.git

Of course if can be forked on github too.

The repo is current as of today. Could I ask folks to stop committing
to svn  and use the github repo instead?

We will be doing some refactoring to try to make better separation of
the user configurable parts from the generic parts. Most likely we
will just rename user configurable files to .templ and provide
instructions that those files should be copied like so:

cp file.templ file

When setting up the project. We will document the procedures required etc.

Those who need access to the QGIS Web Client team so that they can
push directly to the official repo please let me know and I will add
you.

Best regards

Tim

You are right, that this should not be implemented in providers but
that does not imply that it could not be implemented in QBrowser. Or
better, that QBrowser could not use a GUI classes which can do that.

Interesting problem, but you have to face it anyway, Python cannot help IMO.

I don't know, you have to invent something, you have all the summer.
Is it really problem? Should not the QGIS DB providers use QtSql then?

You cannot rely on this. If it is really a problem, then the libraries
must be distinguished by name or rpath must be used, i think. Once a
library is loaded to an application, it will be used also by python,
if it was linked to a library with the same name, I believe.

So, you do agree, that we are talking about the same thing which can
be called either browser or manager? The only question is, if it
should be written in C++ or in Python. I believe that because it
implements core functionality, it should be in C++, until we decide
that the whole QGIS GUI should be in Python.

> Will it able to do the coffee?? :)

I don't think that coffee is somehow directly related to GIS. It
should be able however, to print DEM layers directly to 3D printer
(http://reprap.org) for example, if you are thinking about a
connection with real world.

So why to write another important plugin in Python, with perspective
that it has to be ported later to C++?

do you mean the toolbox or the two softwares as independent entities?
if the toolbox, why not on the qgis.org site? that's were most of the
people using it will be looking.

> does osgeo provides polling facilities?

no idea.


perhaps re-run the poll which was on the qgis homepage from a year or
two ago? IIRC the results at the time surprised me about how many (most)
people were using the grass toolbox. maybe it is less now that qgis has
more plugins offering the functionality with less grass-layer weirdness
to deal with?

osgeo.org's drupal surely can do polls, but maybe wait until the recent
LDAP dust has settled there..

slashgeo.org is another more generic site with geo-polls.


thanks,

Yes, but GRASS layers only since Sunday evening. You should get GRASS
icon in the tree for locations and mapsets.

There is a little bug however, the preview is not always updated. Try
to switch some layers and tabs.

I would avoid the 1) as it would be valid for now, but I'm pretty sure in
future
development we could need a more flexible solution.

2) maximal A:

I'd prefer the 2), it's generic and we can pass parameters using the query
string.
The 3) would be also good.
An alternative would be use QgsDataSourceURI like a container for QUri, in
this manner we can define our interface to access the uri informations.

Other issues:

I don't know, probably yes.

IMHO no, it should be the provider which takes care of this.

Again, I would develop in python the GUI only, not the base functions ;)

Tell me what in the QBrowser class cannot be done in python, it's just a
container. It uses the QgsBrowserModel and some other Qt based classes
I can easily handle in python without any problem.

I don't think the QBrowser code makes particular GUI widgets/functions we
should insert in app/core/gui. Different would be if you had developed a
QgsBrowser tree widget implementing also the QgsLegend interface, as
everybody could reuse that.

However, discussing it we're also going to find what the current
implementation
misses and what should be changed, doesn't matter if at the end it will be
done in C++ or python. It will be Martin who has to decide.

No other devs want to partecipate to the discussion? ;)
I think that a lot of interesting things are coming out.

Regards.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS doesn't use username and password in options
 dialog for proxy connections with WMS
Message-ID: <OFE93B4C20.59A3E586-ONC125789B.0043B37C-C125789B.004525CC@comune.trento.it>


QGIS doesn't use username and password inserted in the "options dialog" for
proxy connections, to use with WMS connections.

This problem affects 1.6.0 and trunk versions, on Linux and Windows.

In the SQUID log, I see this when I try to connect to NASA WMS with Qgis:

  1306326384.090      1 192.168.11.118 TCP_DENIED/407 1987 GET
http://onearth.jpl.nasa.gov/browse.cgi? - NONE/- text/html

as you see, the username is not sent.

If I use the browser (Firefox 3.6) with the same url:

  1306326543.606    446 192.168.11.118 TCP_MISS/200 1385 GET
http://onearth.jpl.nasa.gov/browse.cgi? manganelll
DIRECT/onearth.jpl.nasa.gov text/html

this is correct (manganelll is my username).


I remember that in previous versions of QGIS this was working.

Hi Nathan

in QGIS we have something similar, maybe not that advanced: look for
QgsSearchString and QgsSearchTreeNode classes. They were originally
created for advanced search in the attribute table supporting a subset
of SQL, more recently it is possible to use those classes also for
evaluation of expressions.

Hi all

just a quick reaction from my side (sorry for being so brief):
- it is quite unfair with Guiseppe if you people start proposing how
things should be done _now_ - IMO there was plenty of time to do such
decisions before
- I think it is quite irrelevant whether the implementation is in C++
or in Python: in case the interfaces (such as QgsDataItem) are
implemented correctly there is no real difference (if the code is
shipped with QGIS).
- it has been decided in the proposal that support for saving vector
layers to a particular data providers will be implemented to get
generic vector import/export, the rest of the code is not going to be
that reusable anyway.
- the Qbrowser API is IMHO not completely finished and still might see
some changes. This might cause additional complications for Giuseppe.

So in general I would suggest proceeding with the original plan and to
try to integrate some parts into QBrowser - e.g. implement QgsDataItem
support for PostGIS and SpatiaLite, together with the paramWidget()
that might reuse a lot of work from the db manager plugin itself.

Regards
Martin

Which raises an interesting question: where/how virtual folders should
be inserted in the tree? By virtual folder I mean for example GRASS
location. It represents logical GRASS structure, but it does not
reflect exactly directory structure. A similar problem can appear if
more providers support one file.

Solutions:

1) Add the virtual folder on the same level as the directory (it
currently works this way), but then we get two folders of the same
name

2) Show only the virtual folder, not the directory - the problem is,
that the directory may contain another geographic data, for example
GRASS location may contain shapefiles which could not be accessed

3) Create one virtual item instead of the directory and into this item
insert 2 subitems - the virtual folder and the real directory.

All these solutions are bad. Do you have a better suggestion?

Yes, but I hoped that a real query builder could be developed within
this project for example. I mean a robust, user friendly tool, which
does not allow user to build an incorrect query. It would be certainly
better to have such GUI component available also for C++.

I never said that you cannot. But I cannot then reuse your GUI
components in QBrowser. And I am sure that you are going to develop
really useful components.

Exactly, but I hope to use the components you develop for DB Manager
and those should go to gui lib, IMO.

I don't know, what do you exactly mean, but if you think that there is
a possibility for a reusable component, then it is just another reason
to stay in C++.

Yes it is unfair, but Giuseppe reopened this question himself.
Certainly, I don't say what he has to do and it is impossible to force
anybody in OS project to do anything what he does not want to do. I
just wanted to point out, that I see the DB Manager as a core
component which would be probably better (or its components) to have
in C++.

A good query builder would be certainly reusable.

I'm running qgis-trunk using the nightly build repository under Ubuntu
10.04

I'm trying to switch layers and tabs (and clicking "refresh" or even
"stop rendering") but I still can't see any wms layer (metadata is
correctly shown).

I also can't see the GRASS icon when browsing a location/mapset, as they
seems are recognized as normal files.

On another note, did you noticed the following?

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3839

it seems that the "customization" code has brought issues and actually
qgis-trunk is barely usable (can't save a project, can't create a shape,
can't use many other dialogs -> ex: raster tools).

Sorry for bugging


cheers

Hi,

I can confirm crash under Linux too (tested with c3e161a). And
confirm that Windows nightly builds from OSGeo4W not
affected (tested with ef981f1).

Hi Jean Roc,
at the beginning .ui files, just the normal qgis with minimal 
dependencies, meant foremost for tablets. In the future, or if there is 
time left at the ent of the GSoC,  a minimal QML application for 
portables would be the way I'd like to go.

ciao Marco

What benefits does Gerrit bring that go above and byond the
functionality GitHub has in pull requests? It looks like a great tool,
but it seems to me there is a point where spreading the development
activity over too many websites would be counter-productive.

under Windows/osgeo4w the shortcut to qgis browser .exe is missing, but
once you run the program it works ok as I can see both wms and GRASS
layers.

So the issues we are seeing (about the browser and the crashes) seem to
be only a Linux issue.

This is going to be distributed as a research result and I am thinking it will be available under GPL.. But I do not understand what AFAIK means . You must explain it to me.

Thank you,

Did anyone else ever seen the "Access Violation No RTTI- Data!" exception?

I know there are not many windows users here, but is it related to Threading or is it my own programming problem? Is it running out of memory that it completely loses the layer list or what?

Just waiting until the fish that swallowed the lost coin is caught and gives back what it does not need to hold on to.

Hello-
    We are currently investigating using QGIS as a front end to OSSIM (http://trac.osgeo.org/ossim/). At a very high level, our goal is to use OSSIM for rendering raster data in QGIS. That way, we can leverage the power of OSSIM for image processing and use OGR for vector visualization and editing using the QGIS platform. In fact, it looks like someone else had the same idea some time ago:

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Integration_of_QGIS_and_OSSIM

We started our investigation late last week. We have a debug version of QGIS up and running in Visual Studio 10 (64 bit) using QT 4.7.3. We have since discovered how integral GDAL is to QGIS. Undaunted, we added a some temporary hacks to bypass GDAL and we're now getting images to display via OSSIM! For us, this is a huge first step and we are seriously considering pressing ahead.

Is this something that the QGIS community would support? We would very much appreciate your blessing and support. We have lots of questions and could really use your help.

Thanks in Advance!
Peter

For me the preview also is not rendered first time, I have to switch
from preview to meta and beck to preview. Because for WMS it takes
longer to read data, it emits signal when data are ready and it seems
to be lost.

On Linux? It identifies locations by looking for DEFAULT_WIND, so it
could (should not of course, Windows still is not case sensitive
right?) be problem on Windows if it is default_wind.

Should be fixed.

What version are you building against? Since the 1.7 branch and in
current master branch, Radim Blazek has done a great overhaul to cater
for proper raster providers. That means you should not find QGIS is
heavily intertwined with GDAL - the use of gdal should be abstracted
away into the gdal provider, and you should be able to implement ossim
raster support as a clean separate provider.

I would also really love to see OSSIM support in QGIS (and maybe some
of those nice processing chains making their way into QGIS :-).

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] quality control
Message-ID: <20110525200646.GC91887@keybit.net>

I've just found out there are tests.
When run, many failed, including segfaults.

Is it possible that the tests are too hard to run ?
If I recall correctly you need:
 1) an explicit flag in cmake to enable (-D ENABLE_TESTS=1)
 2) qgis installed (won't run before installing)
 3) Desktop environment running ? (not sure, but my browser opened
    many windows with reports)

I think having a simple way to run regression suite would help
stability of the application. Ideally everyone should run it and
make sure there's no unexpected failure before pushing changes.

How can it be improved ?
My suggestions:

 1) Make support for testing enabled by default
 2) Allow running tests _without_ installing qgis,
    and when an older version is installed, making sure
    the version in the build tree will be tested...
 3) Do not _require_ a desktop environemnt (not sure it is)
 4) Make it (also) available as 'make check' [ more standard name ] ;)

Comments ?

Hi Tim-
   We are playing with 1.6. We'll download the 1.7 branch right away. I agree, use of gdal should be abstracted away into a gdal provider. Sounds like we would create an OSSIM provider.

And yes, we want to create/execute OSSIM image chains directly in QGIS! 

Thanks,
Peter

Just in case I wasnt clear in my post, I mean that gdal stuff *is*
abstracted away into its own provider in 1.7 and trunk.

Cool can't wait!

Giovanni/Pirmin-
  Thanks for the links. Looks like a cool plugin for ossim planet. Our goals are a little different. I think Tim has a good idea of what we're trying to do. We'll be in touch soon.

Thanks!
Peter

If anyone does try to use the ossim planet plugin on Windows: some
months ago I posted (I think to the QGIS user list) a few minor fixes
which were required to get the plugin to load.  But I don't think I ever
actually tested whether it worked.

Peter

I would be tempted to use the relatively new OssimSingleImageChain 
as the basis for the QGisOssimImageProvider as it seems to map 
relatively well to Radim's Raster Provider abstaction

Looks like the latest trunk build 1.8.0-Trunk ef981f1 has no more errors
reported in the CRS syncronization.

It looks like the latest build 1.8.0-Trunk ef981f1 has updated the srs.db
and with the correct parameters for EPSG:3168 and EPSG:3375.

Thanks devs.

Agreed, it is very important now that QGIS is used in production.
Sounds like a task for an ad hoc dev. I guess the current team cannot bear this
additional workload.
I think one of the larger institutions using QGIS should fund it.
Thanks strk for raising the issue.
All the best.

IMHO the right thing to do is to integrate OSSIM in the new analytical framework,
along with OTB, SAGA, etc.
We are currently in the first stages of implementation, please join the discussion.
All the best.

Yes, you have to install mapserver and python-mapscript via OSGeo4W under 
Windows, as the plugin uses python-mapscript.

But I was not able to "import mapscript" in a python script in my OSGeo4W 
installation.

thanks for clarifying that. Meanwhile I opened a ticket in the osgeo4w

Hi

Just a note: You are only oblidged to place your plugin under GPL if
you plan to distribute it beyond your organisation. Of course its nice
to use the GPL regardless....

Subject: [Qgis-developer] pyspatialite not installed properly on Debian?
Message-ID: <4DDE3039.6040606@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
In my freshly packaged QGISs (both 1.7 and trunk, both on deb unstable and testing)
pyspatialite fails to import. I had to:
cp -r
/build/qgis/Quantum-GIS/debian/tmp/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyspatialite/
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/
ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyspatialite/ /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/
ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyspatialite/ /usr/lib/pyshared/python2.7/
but I think this should be fixed upstream, unless it is a local packaging problem.
Any hint?
Thanks a lot.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] announcement: new tool for grid-based reprojection
Message-ID: <4DDE3218.7010403@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Faunalia is developing a plugin to help the user reproject rasters and
vectors using NTv2 grids or towgs84 parameters.
The plugin is already available as experimental in the Faunalia
repository.
It needs qgis >= 1.6 but remember that in qgis 1.6 you will need to
install manually (using osgeo4w under Windows or your package manager
under Linux) the pyspatialite library and also that only qgis 1.7
reproject rasters.
What the plugin does for now:
* it allows the user to create a list of transformations choosing the input
(A) and output (B) CRSs plus a NTv2 grid or towgs84 parameters and the
names to be given to the two resulting custom CRSs
* then, when the user add a layer with the A CRS in a project defined with
the B CRS, a window pops up asking if an A to B transformation has
to applied.
What the plugin will also do:
* it will allow to easily create copies of layers in another CRSs and
applying a certain transformation along the way.
The plugin is actually called "transformation tools" but we are open
to suggestions.
As always, feedback welcome. Please note that we are in the early stages of development.
Thanks to the Regione Emilia Romagna for supporting this work, to Giuseppe Sucameli
for developing and to Giovanni Manghi for design & testing.
Enjoy.

This is ok as a short term solution. As it is possible to do redesign without 
keeping API stability, I'd prefer the maximum solutions.

It seems to me QUrl is designed for network addresses. Ok, it would be 
possible to abuse some properties and interpret the query string param/values 
as the provider parameters. However, it seems cleaner to me to enhance 
QgsDataSourceURI with what we need (so +1 for 3) ). Network based providers 
can still use QUrl internally.

Marco

Mxd2Qgs tool  can export arcmap layers to a qgs project file.
Good thing that qgs files are take xml format.

Nice toolbox for ArcGIS to QGIS!

Now, we can migrate all ArcGIS.mxd to QGIS.qgs.

I suppose styling is included in the export.

Anybody tried it? I am using Mac OS X right now.

Nice job.

Thanks.

Interesting: can anyone give us feedback? Can we promote it as a feasible migrating
solution?
All the best, and thanks.

 "we"? Only if you already have ArcGIS! :)

 Of course its handy to be able to ask colleagues with ArcGIS to
convert an MXD someone has sent you, but often you can't do that
because of issues with data confidentiality. At least I suppose I can
go back to the original supplier and say 'can you run this conversion
tool and send me a .qgs file?'. But sometimes these things come from
online sources with no obvious contact.

 Anyhooooo, better than nothing!

Good point!
Is the .mxd thing something portable ?
And does the toolbox license allow it ?

 Hi Tim,

 Thanks for the migration. I had a meeting with Pirmin yesterday and we 
 started a redmine project for QGIS web client. We already filed a few 
 bugs where I don't yet have a solution: see 
 http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-web-client

 I think we should also offer a mobile client for Smartphones/Tablets in 
 the future based on the newer OpenLayers version. I won't have time 
 before autumn to work on it, but maybe someone else wants to start 
 earlier.

 I do not understand the idea with the .templ files. I actually tried to 
 keep everything "configurable" in the file js/GlobalOptions.js - do you 
 think there are additional parameters that need to be configurable?

Ok cool. I added myself to the manager list there.

For me its not a priority as well - I am doing some work for a client
and they have agreed we can contribute any improvements back to the
web client project so I will try to make my changes in a generic way
as far as possible.

In our testing there are three files that need configuring:

- index.html (we added this to make a more user friendly landing page
so that user doesnt need to remember urls with ?map=foo in them.
- index.xml (at the moment this has Uster specific stuff in)
- js/GlobalOptions (also has project specific stuff in it)

We didnt implement search stuff here yet so that would also get added
to the above list probably.

We want to separate anything that the user will change in his
deployment from stuff that is version controlled in git. This way a
user makes no fork of the project when he customises it for his site,
and can benifit from upstream updates and improvements.

We also rename icons to gis_icons by the way because if you deploy it
in the default apache route the /icons alias is already take by apache
and no icons show in the ui.

I'm also making more changes to my own fork which creates more of a
directory structure and tries to make it as easy as possible for a new
project to be deployed. It looks something like this for me at the
moment:
.
??? apache-conf
??? cgi-bin
??? data
??? readme.txt
??? sample_wms_requests.txt
??? site
??? wsgi

I am creating a simple hello world project too so that when using a
default deployment, the user gets a working usable app out of the box.
The data for the project is included in the repo i a simple
spatiallite db.

Hopefully these updates are acceptible for you and Pirmin (and others
interested).

 Hi Tim,

 The changes you describe sound fine to me.

 My osgeo username is "neumann", I believe the same username was also 
 used in svn. I would need access to the documentation (manual) and to 
 the QGIS webclient parts of the repository.

 Andreas

You should have commit access to the repo now.

I would need access to the documentation (manual) and to the QGIS
> webclient parts of the repository.

The manual is not yet ported to git - Otto and I discussed this and
agreed to wait until after they have release the 1.7 manual before
doing this. I will add any committers to the git repo at that point.
The web client is in its own repo (git philosophy being 1 project 1
repo so we dont have many things in 1 heirarchy like we had in svn).

In my view, this is amazingly useful.

If you have an organization based on ESRI, and you want to migrate or introduce a second line of GIS tools in your tool chain, this will speed things up very much. Of course, I don't know if symbology is carried to QGIS automatically. I'm inclined to think it is not, because it would be somewhat complicated. (But doable...)

Some datasources won't be translated because there is no equivalent in QGIS (like ArcSDE, or file geodatabase, and geodb specifics "terrains", etc.). Although I have been able to get ArcSDE support working in QGIS through OGR (it takes forever to connect, but afterwards it's quite good while drawing and querying).

AFAIK there is no specific license limitation to what you can add to your toolbox. If you want to export your data/maps/projects to whatever format you can...

For me this is a very good tool!

Good point!
Is the .mxd thing something portable ?
And does the toolbox license allow it ?

Yes, it will be possible ;)

In the meanwhile you can see a short howto here:

I only just now noticed a typo in that post. When I mention an ovr file, I meant a vrt file!! (damned pea brain)

Sorry, I meant the tool. 
Actually, seems to be written in python, so maybe there's 
no problem running it on a GNU system w/out ArcGIS installed ?
Did anyone try ? Barry, did you ?

 It may be written in python but I think it calls an ArcGIS API that
requires ArcGIS, in the same way that Python plugins for Qgis require
Qgis.

2 or 3 would be my choices with slight preference to 2 since
everything can be encoded into QUrl, so we do not have to
implement/improve custom parsing (as would be necessary in option 3).
For simple creation of URIs we can provide functions that would
generate the QUrl instances easily.

Hi Marco,

if you want Proj4 and GEOS 3,2 or 3.3.0 RC1 for arm6 or arm7 libraries
- C library compiled let me know.

I use these libraries to compile Spatialiite Library for iOS (iphone and ipad).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] dbf tabel edit working, csv tabel not?
Message-ID: <4DE15BF2.6090507@duif.net>

Dev's

Running trunk on ubuntu natty.

I'm doing a simple plugin which should give an user the ability to
'georefence' records of a table by clicking in a reference map (could
not find something for this, let me know if I missed it):

1) load reference map
2) load (non spatial) table (dbf, csv, whatever)
3) activate plugin, assign x and y column
4) click in table to activate one or more records
5) click in map to fill x and y in table
6) show temporary marker there
7) save data / table

More or less everything is working now when working with dbf's or
spatial tables.

But failing when working with csv tables.

Getting a dialog with:

Could not commit changes to layer xyz
Errors: ERROR: 1 attribute value change(s) not applied.

Can somebody confirm this?
Is there a reason for this not to work?
(I can think of something... don't know if the qt-table component aware
is of information like text and column delimiters..)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Salut Fred,
The report you give is not super verbose. The error probably happened
earlyer, scroll up in the terminal and look for the error. Furthermore try
to re launch the make step:
cd builDir
make ..

Hope it helps

I suspect that it has nothing to do with globe but with the change of
libraries from version 1.7 to version 1.8.

When I change from one version to another I usually have to delete the
old libraries /usr/local/lib/libqgis*1.7* and then run ldconfig

Then compile and install should work fine. For some reasons, newer
compiles can link to older versions of the libqgis*

Maybe this helps if you manually delete old library versions?

Salut Fred, 
The report you give is not super verbose. The error probably happened
earlyer, scroll up in the terminal and look for the error. Furthermore try
to re launch the make step:
cd builDir
make ..

Hope it helps

Subject: [Qgis-developer] attribute table events and python
Message-ID: <4DE2C3AE.9010108@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

trying to use python to handle some attribute table stuff, I have the
following questions:

-1- Can I check IF there is a attribute table showing already?
Using Python I want to open the attribute table of current active vector
layer, ONLY if it is not open yet.
I know I can do: iface.actionOpenTable().trigger()
but this will open as much tables as triggered...

-3- Can I select the NEXT record/feature-id in the attribute table(!).
To be clear: not the nextFeature from the provider, because an user can
have a non natural sorting based on one of the columns. But really the
next record as seen by the user in the table.

Thanks,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I noticed that the grass provider is now a library instead of a module, and is linked to by the grass plugin.  If there are functions the grass plugin needs from the grass provider, shouldn't they be moved to the qgisgrass library and leave the provider as a module?  It's messed up the Mac install processing, at least.

grassprovider.cpp was linked into both the library and the provider.  Now it's
only in the provider and the provider is also linked to the plugin as it needs
some methods from the provider.

What's the problem on mac with that?

Message-ID: <201105301110.57938.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

Hi guys,

Are you able to estimate, when 1.7 for Win will be packaged?

I have many users not satisfied with 1.6. They were using 1.7-dev and some of 
them updated it (more or less mindfully) to the more and more unstable 1.8-
dev. They are getting furious, as now they have to go back to 1.6 and lost 
many functionalities they used to use... The 1.7 is really an important 
release.

If there are still some blockers, what about releasing it as 1.7 beta? 
Otherwise please provide me kinda reliable estimation, when the release can be 
expected. I'll try to calm down the users  :-)

Hi everyone,
I was just thinking that as well as finding out about what proportion of
people use the GRASS plugin, it could be worth trying to find out _what
they use it for_, in order to identify important features that could be
added or improved in QGIS itself.

What do you think?

We decided to postpone the release until the git/redmine migration is done at
the HF.  The redmine migration isn't finished yet.  Apart from that, I don't
see any blockers.

wms preview was working in the past days under Windows. Now I just
updated osgeo4w and WMS preview is not working anymore.

Anyone else?

It just seems logically and organizationally wrong: providers and plugins are modules that QGIS loads, not libraries that the system linker loads as required by binaries.  If all of the grass provider was in the library before, why not just leave it only in the library instead and drop the provider?  Is there a requirement to have a provider?  Otherwise, move the provider to lib/.

The Mac issue is that the install processing adjusts the internal linking paths for the Mac app package organization.  It does all *.so files in plugins and *.dylib files in lib, so I'll have to make a special case to do the one *.dylib in the plugins folder.

Is the provider as a library (linked by the plugin) meant to be *also* loaded as a module?  Maybe some initialization that happens as a module but not as a library?  If that's the case, there is another problem: the plugin loading code only loads .so files, even on OS X (.so is the standard module extension for OS X), and libraries on OS X are .dylib, so it will not be loaded as a module.

Oh!  Angry users! Sounds bad :-) At least they are angry for the right
reasons (an insatiable appetite for new QGIS releases) :-). Borys
there is nothing really stopping us releasing now in my book, except
that we wanted to try to have trac migrated to redmine as Juergen
mentioned. I spent some time on it but havent had the time needed to
sit and really get it working. While work has been continuing on
master branch we have been applying fixes from trunk also to the
release branch so in effect its just getting better and better while
it waits. If others agree we can postpone the redmine shift for after
the release and I will go ahead and put out the call for packaging.

Please cast your vote:

- release now
- wait for the redmine migration

If you are really desperate to get 1.7 to specific users, I made an
unofficial 'all in one' build a week or so back which I can let you
have - put I wont' put it online publically until we make the official
announcement so that we can get proper download stats etc. Email me
offlist if you want it.

Regards

Tim

Hi Marco,

For Proj 4, you can get it in Route-me.
https://github.com/route-me/route-me

For GEOS 3.2 and 3.3.0 RC1, you can get it in ShapeKit.
https://github.com/mweisman/ShapeKit

The trick is in ShapeKit in build
https://github.com/mweisman/ShapeKit/blob/master/lib_src/build_libs.sh

These are for iOS. You need Xcode and the iOS SDK to build it.

I think this will give you an idea how to build these libraries for Android NDK.

Regards, Noli

Hi all.
Am I the only one to feel uncomfortable releasing 1.7 with 60 bugs
classified as blocking?
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/report/16
IMVHO we should examine them, and either reclassify them or solve them
before release. My feeling is that 1.7 at this stage has significantly more
issues than most previous versions, and could be disappointing for many of
our users.
I hope to be wrong, of course.
All the best.

 I share your concern but no one has actually the time or manpower to 
 solve these bugs, and to be honest I don't think that postponing the 
 release any longer will improve the situation. This release has enough 
 good points to compensate, I hope all this shiny stuff will blind the 
 users enough so they don't see the little problems.

 If corporate users want a bug-free release, they'll have to invest in 
 maintaining it. Some institutes I know are already lurking on this list 
 and I hope they will be able to push this kind of effort trough their 
 hierarchy, I'll also looking forward a big announcement in the coming 
 week.

 So +1 for release

+1 for me for Paolos suggestion ..
I think releasing 1.7 with a lot of bugs and instability will bring us
no friends ..

reclassify and/or solve at least a lot of them would be very cool
(from usersight)

So if i can help just drop me a note - it's just i think i cannot help
solving the bugs ;) but i am working on that ...

I think releasing as a beta would be a good idea, that way we get 1.7
release out but users know it's not fully done.  This way it also gives us
more time to do bug fixing.

I agree with this. A beta would be fine, possibly released with a call
for funding targetted at closing up the blockers.

Perhaps the problem is uderstand what mean "release version".
If it is only a snapshot of all available to a timestamp date,
or if it mean a version that is more stable than the trunk version.

However
I would suggest to consider the choice of update the geos to the 3.3.0
version (released some day ago) before to release the qgis 1.7
To have almost the more recent and stable version of it.

regards,

wow
+1 for me on that ..
a really good idea .. beta + call for funding to solve last bugs ..

in that way some companys will probably see that there is a lot of
work and time invested in opensource and it would be nice to bring us
all ahead by supporting qgis .. we do not have licence issues :)

Hi,
I agree with Paolo's concerns, and I also believe that ordinary users
can benefit from testing the 1.7.0. In addition, they may find a few
more blocking bugs... which ultimately may help the community provide an
even better version.

So +1 for a beta release.
Mayeul

+1 for release as a beta.

I share Paolo's unease about a full release with 60 major bugs. It takes
much more effort to build a good reputation than to loose one.

In the documentation, we are quick to highlight new tools and enhancements,
but how about adding something on Known Issues and Workarounds? Not nearly
as good as a fix, but better than nothing.

It is also ok asking for sponsorship to fix bugs, but most people have no
way of knowing what sort of sums would make a difference. Or is it a case of
"if you need to ask the price, you can't afford it?"

IMHO it is often quite the contrary in fact - most users believe bugfixing
is more expensive than it really is.

we could consider 1.7 as beta and 1.8 as stable.

I think cleaning bug list (by fixing or reclassifying) is essential
before each release.

+1 to release as a beta

Waiting seems reasonable of course, however actually I don't see really big 
advantages if the branch waits, and the trunk doesn't :-) We will have to 
migrate the trunk anyway.

+1 for release now, thought I don't insist. They aren't armed :-)

Oh, I've missed your mail. Are there real chances for solving them in June? If 
yes, please don't count my vote for releasing now, it's worth of waiting IMHO. 
Anyway, I believe we should release at least 1.7beta, as it's much more stable 
than the 1.8-dev.

I didn't use the 1.7-dev windows package very much - just on three trainings 
(each covered another functions), but I never had any significant problems with 
it. In my personal feeling the only one really buggy and disappointing release 
was 1.4 and the 1.7 is *far* better :)

Cool thing. We are working on a similar converter to UMN MapServer
(including styling and stuff). It will be ready by autumn (hopefully
to FOSS4G).

Since you are using ArcPy you cannot transfer the layer-styling right?

Hi all

I'm in favour of releasing 1.7 now. The release was already planned for March 
and was shifted then. There will always be a large number of bugs in the 
queue, even with donations. Maybe we even discover more of them in a beta 
version :-)

Seriously, 1.7 feels to me to have a similar stability as 1.6 (or even 
better). I'm concerned shifting the release further and further has a bad 
impact on motivation of users and developers. Wouldn't it be an option to make 
a stable branch (1.7.1, 1.7.2) with the possibility for developers to backport 
bugfixes?

Regards,
Marco

Yes, please do consider that route!
IMHO, QGIS has reached a very full and varied feature set, competing 
honorably with other proprietary software. The hesitation to further 
adopting QGIS in enterprise environments comes from instability, bugs, 
and the constant "fixed in the next release" answers. We don't need more 
features, rather what's now available always working on all platforms. I 
realize that devs want new challenges, but users want what they already 
know...

Thanks,
Micha

Ciao Paolo, all,

I am loosely following the list (sometimes) but found this one
rather striking:

Me as a QGIS user would feel VERY uncomfortable with an
unstable 1.7 version being released.

Myself, I manage the GRASS GIS release since 1997 and can for sure
confirm that selecting the release date is difficult. But I also learned that
one does not gain anything when releasing too buggy software.

It will just send the users away to other, more stable FOSSGIS.
That's all.

You are perfectly right.

IMHO you underestimate the important point for FOSS(GIS) that we need
to aim at quality and stability, not the low price. Postponing releases is
common and usually motivated. Happens in the proprietary world, too.

If QGIS crashes several times in a row, I will tend to abandon it as a user.

Recently I had to downgrade (like other colleagues I know) to QGIS 1.5
since 1.6 was unusable for me. And if QGIS 1.7 is even worse (I stopped
trying trunk which I used to do elsewhere), I will not even try to install it.
Sorry if that sounds harsh but I start to no agree much with the apparent
QGIS' policy of "we-release-with-most-features-possible-but-with-low-stability"
which impacts more and more the recent QGIS releases.
Please note that I (happily) followQGIS since V 0.x.

A plea: Please don't overload QGIS with new features at the cost of even
destabilizing the existing good material.

> If corporate users want a bug-free release,

Yes.

No. At least it is not that easy. A code base needs to be maintained. See also

by now, 1.7 has already been postponed for months and the situation 
hasn't improved : many work, few hands. We can call it an alpha version 
but let's put it out in the field so people who need these features can 
use them without ressorting to gosgeo4w/dal-dev. This way the tools are 
here for those who want and the sign "danger zone, do not switch" is 
present for those who don't.

Lessons can be learned without blocking the situation, for example not 
merging a single new feature if the blocking bug count is above ten like

Dear QGIS developer,
i am not a QGIS developer but would add my 2c too. :)

I completely share the opinion of Markus and Paolo. Please do not
release QGIS with 60 blocker bugs left even as a beta release.
This will disappoint many user who are willingly to test the new
features and the usability of  QGIS.

Best regards
Soeren

I'm also in favor of releasing 1.7 as is - we decided what to release when we
branched and I don't see a reason to revert that.

Moreover I believe most of the tickets tagged as "Must Fix For Release" aren't
actually blockers - or were introduced with 1.7.  So that's probably just
misleading.

I think it's fine to release it as is but do think we should call it
Beta, Testing or something similar. We should also consider a doing bug
fix only release (no new features), not a backport of fixes either and
try to steer developers towards that goal for the next couple of months.
This bug fix release could be the last release of the 1.x series if it's
really stable.

In the future maybe once every X (2-3, or .5-1 a year) releases we could
do a bug fix/bug hunt release where we just take time to clean up. If
it's just a couple of months of bug hunting with very little other
changes it should be easy to roll the release more quickly than usual.

Just some ideas...

Thanks,
Alex
