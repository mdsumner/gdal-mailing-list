Hi Borys

Your changes sound fine - please go ahead. 

BTW I tried your python profile generator plugin - works great!

Hi

Many thanks Douglas. I put the following comment next to the download
url:

---

Please note that you should ensure that older versions of QGIS (e.g.
ones you may have compiled yourself) have been removed from your system
before installing QGIS 1.0.0. These packages are also being migrated to
Fedora official repos so you may already be able to install simply by
typing:

<code>
yum install qgis
</code> 

---

(I assumed yum install fedora below was a typo).

Best regards

Tim

Hi Robert


I've been using QGIS with your gis icon theme (including grass and
plugin updates) and I must say I really like using the theme and the
cohesive look it brings to QGIS.

The one area left that I have a problem with is the load / save / save
as icons. No matter how much I try to memorise what the up arrow
signifies versus the down arrow, I find I just cant  get used to them,
and invariable end up clicking the wrong one. Even worse, if one doesnt
read the dialog title carefully and end up using the save project icon
instead of the load project, you can wipe out your project file.

Could I suggest trying some other paradigm for these icons - I
appreciate that floppy disks are an anachronism but perhaps there is
something else that will provide instant recognition...

Thanks for the great work you have done!

Best regards

Tim

I would second Tim's sentiments on this. Those icons are very non- 
intuitive for me as well. I keep thinking of upload/download icons in  
an sftp-type client.

Could you use a DVD type image as the backdrop for save and something  
with an opening folder for open? Here's an example disc icon I found  
in a quick search:
http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/enhancedlabs/longhorn-pinstripe/DVD-ROM-copy-128x128.png

Overall, the icons are very nice and a welcome improvement. I would  
also comment that the grass in the GRASS icons might benefit from a  
little more contrast so it is more distinctive.

Regards,
John

There is silimarity to upload/download functions, but those symbols are very
neutral and can be used in different context.

I associate DVD with multimedia, not saving data. What I'm looking for is
minimization of visual information as we have very little space.

I have to test it on my students :)
But I can understand your doubts. Thoses three icons for you under [version for
QGIS]
http://robert.szczepanek.pl/icons.php
Please override them in SVN if needed.

 I just had a quick google for 'save icon floppy disc' and found that
the Tango desktop icons use a hard drive and an arrow - see here:

http://bootstrapping.wordpress.com/2007/05/23/the-save-icon/

 there's lots of other talk on the blogosphere about it, some people
saying 'keep the floppy icon' and some saying to kick it out, and a
zillion comments on an article on slashdot from 2004 that you
shouldn't waste your time reading.

 There's also an argument for getting rid of save icons and
encouraging people to hit Ctrl-S....

Although I see current gnome apps in ubuntu e.g. evolution still use the
floppy icon for 'save draft'.

Many people don't learn short cuts. Even though I've pointed out to
people that each menu entry shows its short cut next to it, they still
stick to their same old pointy clicky habits. Then again there was my
friend who didn't use the mouse and did all his work from the keyboard
unless left with no option. Upshot: I think we need to cater for both.

Robert, your 'traditional icons' look great. I think what would also
work well is keeping your 'file open' icon as the new traditional folder
and then using a tango style disk drive with arrow for save and save as.
This is because the main point of confusion is the difference between
save and open concepts.

I'll commit your traditional ones for now to trunk.


Best Regards

Tim

PostGIS Manager is in about beta quality - it lacks more extensive
testing and has probably some unresolved bugs or missing features but
generally it should be usable.

I don't know whether it's a good idea to document it in this phase.
Probably plugins shouldn't be documented in main user manual and
should be documented on their own. This IMO would better reflect
different release cycles of plugins and QGIS - imagine that a python
plugin documented in docs for 1.0 will be altered heavily during life
of qgis 1.0 - leaving users with outdated documentation. There could
be a unified way of documenting plugins, e.g. each one with docs
included would contain directory "doc" with index.html and potentailly
more files. The docs would be written in HTML format, preferably using
only subset supported by Qt. Documentation writers would help plugin
developers to write the docs, like this plugins will have always fresh
documentation available that could be opened anytime (and not
requiring user to search for appropriate chapter in QGIS docs).

Barry,

looking at grass provider code, it really doesn't come with efficient
implementation of featureAtId(), however it should be quite easy to
implement it for GRASS layers because features ("lines") are always
accessed by their ID. But still there are cases where sequential
select is needed (e.g. some OGR drivers).

I was thinking also about adding a new vector provider call which
would fetch "some" features at once - you would provide a list of IDs
and provider would return you a list of features. This would either
simplify the problem with some providers needing to fall back to
sequential select and also would allow faster fetching for some
providers which have greater overhead when accessing features (e.g.
SQL parsing and communication).

I tend to second this (Martin's) notion. If we do document things in the
user guide is should be simply a table showing the name and function of
the plugins in the official repo. The plugins stored in QGIS and shipped
with official releases would make sense to be documented in the user
guide though.

Because external plugins will change a lot I also agree that the main
documentation of external plugins should be provided with the plugin itself (a
web page or help menu...). In the manual I would like to give an overview
to the user and offer a list of official plugins with a short description
of what the external plugin does and together with links to the probably more
uptodate information.

But I guess, if a plugin has beta status, it wouldn't be part of the official
repository anyway, or?

 Otto

Agreed. I think we should get inspiration from R, not only for the
documentatin. R has the manual of the plugin distributed together with
the plugin itself.
All the best.

And the ubuntu packages are in the qgis ppa on launchpad.   Both made
with the debian/ directory from the qgis with next to no changes.

Upps - I missed that and saw that the current pdf in the QGIS 1.0.0 sources at
./doc/userguide.pdf is an old version 0.9.1 manual. I suggest that we make some
general changes to:

a) Help -> Help Contents (...qgis/doc/index.html)

Here we have links to the 0.9.1 Installation and User Guide coming with the
source code. These links should be removed, because it the documentation team
will never be able to have the manual updates done, when QGIS is branched or
tagged for a new release. 

Instead I would prefer to link to the web site with the note:

"A current version of the QGIS manual and translations are provided at
http://qgis.osgeo.org/documentation/manuals.html. Older versions are available
at http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/doc/manual/."

b) We should remove the ./doc/userguide.pdf from the sources. As described
above, that manual will never be up-to-date and therefore doesn't make sense.

 Otto

I'm glad to see that my work is proposed among the official plugins. :)
I'm not able to work on the code and get it handle rpy2 properly before mid
January; anyway I think that the plugin could be temporarily tagged as "beta".

Let me know.

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0901040739s2b72baeer3555b66af516a2f7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

today I've decided to make a first public release of symbology-ng
plugin which is meant as a prototype for new generation symbology for
vector layer. I've chosen python because of faster development and
ability to deploy it more easily to potential testers. Later, I'd like
to integrate it to QGIS and deprecate the original rendering code. You
can install the plugin from my sandbox:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/plugins-sandbox.xml

What are the main highlights:
- compose symbols from one or more symbol layers
- load and store symbols (and other items) from/to a "style" file
- override order in which symbol layers are drawn for high-quality
output (done in multiple rendering passes)
- color ramps (gradient or random colors from some part of color space)
- use custom symbols and color ramps when generating categories for a renderer
- new symbol types, e.g. marker line - polyline composed from markers
- lock symbol layer's color so it doesn't get changed when applying
color on the whole symbol
- modual architecture for symbol layers

When you load the plugin, you'll get two new buttons in a toolbar:
1. one that opens a new window with currently selected vector layer
rendered in it (with current extent). in that window you can also
change renderer and symbology settings (although graduated symbol
renderer is missing GUI so far and categorized symbol renderer only
allows you to add all categories)
2. the other button opens style manager

The rendering is slower than with current rendering in QGIS, but
that's caused by the dynamic nature of the language and missing
optimizations. There are some features which are not yet available in
GUI. There are also some missing features, see TODO file.

I would be glad to hear some feedback from you!

I use regularly self-packaged qgis 1.0 (using the upstream debian/rules)
with no major issues (apart from the bugs, of course :) ).
It would be great to have qgis back on debian.

Martin,

This sounds like a great project. I've installed the plugin using a  
debug build of the latest svn code from trunk on OS X.

When I click on the paint palette icon, I get a window that has a  
purple background and a button in the upper left that says "set  
renderer", but nothing is rendered in that window. I am using a line  
layer with road information that is rendered fine in the map canvas.  
Is that correct (it sounds like the layer should render in the window).

Once I change settings from the set renderer window, I see no way to  
apply these changes. Again, there is only one button in the renderer  
window. It appears that the gui is not displaying correctly on my  
system. I notice this message repeatedly in the Console, if it helps:
1/4/09 9:55:54 AM [0x0-0x29d29d].org.qgis.qgis[37347] FOOK

I made a debug build, and this time it crashed when I tried the plugin  
with the following dump to the Console:

This is correct. It's just a simple window with "set renderer" button
in the upper-left corner. The rest of the window should be used for
the rendered layer.

The settings are applied immediately when the dialog is closed with OK
button. The reason why it doesn't display anything is that the
rendering is (not yet) implemented for multipolylines and multipoints.
I will implement that shortly, in meanwhile please try it with some
layers that contain only single-part geometries.

Not sure about this, please try with some single-part geometries, then
we'll see whether this is still a problem...

Thanks for the testing,

updated version (0.1.1) now supports also multi-part features.

If you've encountered this error on QGIS startup:

then fetch latest version 0.1.4 which should have this problem fixed.

Howdy Giovanni! Good to see others looking under the hood. We are in 
need of more people to work on the raster code, so if you are interested...

the Raster capabilities are basically totally dependent on GDAL. GDAL 
will always be the default, but I think it would be good to provide the 
ability to have other providers as well.  The goal for v1.0.0 was to get 
the current approach stable and as usable as possible.

Currently the QgsRasterLayer class is a beast and really needs to be 
refactored into about 3 or 4+ classes. The idea is to make the raster 
providers much more like the vector providers. Tim provided a link to 
some of the initial brain storming.

> the only exported ability is "Identify". 
The raster system is read only. I would like to see numerous other 
accessors to pixel data; access by pixel coordinate, real world 
coordinate, request NxN blocks of pixels etc.

Another part of the raster system that is need is some basic raster 
manipulations; recoding values, calculators etc. Some of these exists as 
plugins but should be part of the core application and the API should be 
able to provide better access so.

I'm just wondering how things are going in terms of packaging QGIS 1.0

some help for you? If you need anything, just shout! :-)

I will wait to announce QGIS 1.0 release until you are ready with your

Hi QGIS devs

I'm a bit lost in the tickets and discussions about proxys. What is the 
current state of proxy handling?

There is patch #1422 that adds the possibility to choose proxy type for plugin 
installer (but not WMS). In the ticket it says 'I have not made any new 
changes to the plugin installer, as Borys has already applied the above fix, 
plus some excellent extras!'. Does that mean that the patch can be closed?

I also have a proxy patch (attached) which lets the user select proxy type and 
sets it to QgsHttpTransaction (for WMS). I tested together with Andreas and it 
seems that setting the proxy and proxy type at application level does not 
work. Therefore the patch sets the proxy configuration to the QHttp object. Do 
other proxy users/developers have the same experience? Because I don't see a 
reason why the application level proxy does not work.

Maybe we need a mix of both patches such that proxy works with WMS and plugin 
installer?

Also I think we need a set of proxy testers to try both patches with different 
proxy types and report what works/ does not work with patch #1422 and attached 
patch. Who would be available? 

Regards and thanks for your feedback,
Marco

Hi List,

surfing the new mapserver domain/site www.mapserver.org, I mentioned 
that a new 'package' of applications is served there:
osgeo4w (osgeo4windows, apparently a newer ms4w (mapserver4windows).
For those not into windows: ms4w is/was a very easy way to 'install' a 
basic (web)gis environment on windows.

Looking at the package list:
http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/PackageListing

I see there is even a desktop gis now: uDig.
Shouldn't Qgis in there also :-)

Don't now how difficult this is, I see there is also a grass package and 
other low level libs in it, so maybe things would bite each other?

Having all dependencies prepackaged (and maintained by someone else ;))
is nice.  That was the reason for me to port QGIS to the GEOS C-API.
OSGeo4W doesn't ship the C++ libraries (as C++ ABIs cause bad headaches
on Windows once you use more than one compiler (version)).

The "current" problem is the GRASS package.  IIRC GDAL does have GRASS
support in OSGEO4w and the GRASS package is in bad shape.  Marco Pasetti
wanted to look into this.  But I suppose, he didn't find time yet.

I had packaged all missing dependencies (Qt 4.4.0, SIP, pyqt4 and gsl)
and some preview of QGIS 1.0 - although those packages are probably
outdated by now.  But as I was missing a proper GRASS package, I didn't
upload.

All that was back in July:

The present state is that Installer reads the proxy type from QSettings, but 
there is no gui to set it. Your patch does it so the problem should be solved 
after applying it. The second reason for keeping it open was that I have no 
feedback if it really has helped (with manually adjusted QSettings).

Probably we should create a very simple Qgs standalone application to determine 
whether it's a Qt bug or something in the implementation.

In fact, I still don't know whether Installer works with proxy, but I hope yes.

It doesn't use the QgsHttpTransaction (there is no Python bindings) and uses its 
own QPHttp object, which inherits from the QHttp and just applies the proxy 
settings to every instance when created. I hope your path for WMS + managing the 
QSettings is sufficient for both Installer and WMS. 

But there is also WFS remaining (and what with postgis?)

Unfortunately I don't use proxy so I'm doing that all a bit gropingly.
I can only say that your patch for QSettings seems to be fully compatible with 
Installer.

No not yet. Borys has added the functionality to the installer, but the
extra dropdown list added to the proxy settings tab has not been applied
yet (so the user can specify the type of proxy to use).

Perhaps we should try to combine these two patches, because there's
nothing worse than having to reenter proxy information more than once in
an application ;-)

I think Borys has found a similar problem, though it appears to work ok
for me...? I'm certainly not expert here though...

 Here at work I have to use a web caching proxy to get web sites
off-campus. All port 80 access is restricted. No username or password
is needed.

 Currently WMS doesn't work even though I have set the proxy host and
port in the settings dialog. When I 'connect' to a WMS server in the
add layer dialog I get "Could not understand the response.  The wms
provider said:" and it apparently said nothing. On the console I see:

proxy-connection: close

 (where wwwcache.lancs.ac.uk is our proxy and 8080 is the port).

 Also currently the plugin installer doesn't work either - connections
to the repositories fail, even the one on-campus which shouldn't need
to use the proxy at all. I get similar console error when I try.

 I'm happy to test people's proxy tweaking, but at the moment I'm not
set up to compile Qgis, so Linux and Windows binaries will have to do.

Richard,

I would note that the OSGeo4W grass package is quite outdated and somewhat
incomplete.

I would really like to have someone willing to work on a QGIS package for
OSGeo4W, though it is a somewhat challenging task due to the dependency on
GRASS, and Qt.

Sorry for my ignorance (I know close to nothing about win packaging).
Aren't these problems already been solved by Marco Pasetti for the
preparation of his win qgis+grass+deps package?
All the best.

Paolo,

No, though I would expect some similar techniques could be used.

For one thing, and OSGeo4W QGIS package would be expected to use the
provided versions of underlying libraries - like GDAL.  Also the layout
within the filesystem will be somewhat different and there is a bit of
extra glue stuff needed at install time.

I have spoken to Marco about working on this but he has indicated that
he is unable to commit to the extra work implied.

Ideally such an effort could be pursued in close cooperation with Marco,
including ultimately using the same binaries produced for OSGeo4W (with
a different installer) as the standalone QGIS and/or GRASS package.

Obviously Marco has the right to set the limits of what he will commit to.
But it has been a stake through the heart of OSGeo4W that GRASS and QGIS
aren't present because Marco fills the "standalone win32 binaries" niche
so well but it is hard to fill OSGeo4W without his active help or else
duplicate a great deal of tricky work.

J?rgen,

I wasn't aware of this work (or perhaps had forgotten it).  I would be
interested in proceeding with QGIS work even without a usable GRASS
package.  QGIS is still very useful without GRASS (IMHO).

Hi Marco,

glad that you roled up the proxy-topic again :-)

We have several problems with it and I tried to track this down to some point 
but got lost in QT-stuff. One of my collegues told me that QT uses the 
CONNECT-method which at least fails on our proxy-server.

Apart from that, using QT 4.2.x worked though. I dont have a QT4.2.x-build at 
hand so I cannot really test against current qgis-trunk.

I could give it a go to test. Let me know which revision-number is testable.

Best regards

PS: It would be good to have a noproxy-entry, because some clients complain 
that they cannot use internal and external WMS in one QGIS-Session.

Agreed: GRASS should be used only for more complex operations, not for
simple tasks. However, I do not this reimplementing basic operations in
qgis would make much sense. The speedy development of fTools and other
python plugins is made possible by the reuse of existing libraries
(especially GEOS, etc.), and IMHO the same approach should be used for
rasters: a python plugin calling GDAL (same for OGR) will allow users to
greatly increase their power, without too much effort from qgis devs.
If important raster functions are missing from GDAL, better implement
them there than rewriting them in QGIS.
All the best.

Hello all, and sorry for cross-posting,

my plugin for QGIS is now ready for rpy2! 

Some side features are temporarily disabled, I'll fix these bugs as soon as
possible. I think it's better to release this important update than keep it
private until all works properly.

Happy testing and thanks in advance for feedback,

will be uploaded to faunalia repo as soon as I'll have fixed a few minor
issues. I'll keep both 1.1.1 and 1.2 versions, to let people temporarily
use the missing features. Old version will be removed as soon as the new
package is fully functional.
Thanks Anne for the prompt response, and to everybody for feedback.
All the best.

Hi Tim,

I still have some problems to fix. See here for more info 
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2009-January/041750.html
(sorry for the few words but I really need to "speed up everything")

>Do you have time to do it? Would you like me to try to find

Yes, not a lot of time, but I have time. I only need to fix some "opened 
questions" about the building environment (as you can read above), then I'll 
be able to strictly focus on the building items... I'll call you when I'll 
need some help.

>I will wait to announce QGIS 1.0 release until you are ready with your

I'm afraid, but I'll be very late on the project this time. I think it will 
need one week more. Feel free to release without the MS-Windows installer...

>Happy new year!

You too...

The 1.2 version is not uploaded. Contrary to my previous statement, I
had to remove the 1.1.1. I hope this is not a problem.
Looking forward for the new version, with the two widgets back to
functional. However, as it stands now the plugin does its job.
Please report any problem, especially with R 2.8 and on Windows.
All the best.

got it - on Debian there is no different import between rpy and rpy2.
I'll work on it tomorrow on my Debian machine.

Hi all,

Thanks for your feedback. I think Borys is right and the plugin installer 
should pick up the proxy type from the settings. Therefore I applied the patch 
in r9939 for testing. 

I don't have the 'pleasure' to work behind a proxy so I cannot test myself. 
Andreas, Barry, Carson, Stephan, could you test r9939 with your proxy 
configurations at work?

>But there is also WFS remaining (and what with postgis?)

True, WFS is using QHttp directly for GetFeature requests and also needs to 
set proxy settings. Also I'm developing an SOS client that would also need to 
do that. It seems reasonable to have a method applyProxySettings(QHttp) that 
can be used by all those classes. For postgis there is probably a libpq 
specific way of proxy setting, though I did not check the documentation yet.

Yes, I agree it would be handy to specify a set of urls in option dialog for 
that. Then every URL starting with such a string will not use a proxy in its 
QHttp object (that is a further argument against setting proxy at application 
level).

Regards,
Marco

Marco et al,

I am pleased to announce that I am behind an http proxy (not actually 
pleased about that part), and all works fantastically! Both the plugin 
installer and the wms provider work great. I'll test a bit more later.

Cheers,

Carson

same for Italy (Gauss-Boaga). Actually this is a serious problem for

 You can always fire up a personal proxy. A quick search on
freshmeat.net brings up a few:

http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/ - free, cross-platform
http://www.privoxy.org - free, cross-platform (an Amiga port??!!) and
for the paranoid.

 I'm not setup to build qgis at the moment, so unless there's an
Ubuntu/Windows binary available...

 Carson's message just now brings hope though :)

No I will wait - the windows world will be greatly disappointed if we
announce the release and they have nothing to use. I'm not trying to
pressure you (well not a lot anyway :-), just trying to get an idea of
timeframes.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] buffer segmentation fault
Message-ID: <4965F231.8020108@gmail.com>

Hello again,

Quick question for the list before I submit a bug...

Is anyone else getting a segmentation fault when attempting to buffer 
features (points, lines, or polygons)? It is possible this is a GEOS 
issue, but I'm not sure...

Here is some sample code to try in the python console if you want to 
confirm the above behaviour (assumes your target layer is the first 
layer in your TOC):

 >>> map_canvas = iface.mapCanvas()
 >>> layer = map_canvas.layer( 0 )
 >>> provider = layer.dataProvider()
 >>> all_attributes = provider.attributeIndexes()
 >>> provider.select( all_attributes )
 >>> feature = QgsFeature()
 >>> provider.nextFeature( feature )
 >>> geometry = feature.geometry()
 >>> buffer = geometry.buffer( 500, 5 ) #replace with some relevant value...

and here QGIS closes unexpectedly, leaving the following in the console:

Python support ENABLED :-)
Loaded : Plugin Installer (package: plugin_installer)
Loaded : fTools (package: fTools)
Segmentation fault

Cheers,

Carson

Hi Carson,

I suspect there is something wrong with handling of the returned
string list. first() method returns only a reference so imagine this
scenario:
1. a new temporary list is created as a result of calling
fileDialog.selectedFiles()
2. first() is called which returns reference to first item in the temporary list
3. now the list is not needed anymore, so it gets deleted (!), the
reference is left broken
4. conversion of broken reference raises MemoryError

That's what I think. This also explains why it works sometimes and
sometimes not. A similar problem is this (ticket #777):
feat = QgsFeature ( .... )
geom = feat.geometry()
del feat

This time feature is deleted but geom contains invalid pointer. I've
been adviced to use virtual destructor on QgsFeature that would notify
geometry object that the pointer is invalid, however I had no success.

I would recommend you to ask also on PyQt/PyKDE mailing list to be
sure. And how to work this around? Just store the reference to string
list while it's needed:
files = fileDialog.selectedFiles()
shapefileName = unicode(files.first())

Regards
Martin

Seems to work fine for me. Please try to build qgis with debug mode
and start it inside GDB. When qgis will crash, gdb command line opens
and you'll be able to inspect where the segfault happened (and
possibly why). Important command is "bt" which prints the backtrace.

Hi Carson,

I did have this behaviour a few months ago (around preview 1). I use the 
buffer function to define an AREA for point features in the HtmlImageMap 
plugin.
But after a certain version it doesn't segfault anymore, so I thought it 
was a known problem which was fixed.

Trying your lines in a Windows Preview2 NOW does NOT segfault qgis here.
On a freshly build 1.0 also not at this moment.
I'm not able to build trunk at this moment.

Does the memory/pointer erro Martin is pointing at maybe have something 
to do with it?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Ok, tests are partly successfull.

I only have success when setting the proxy-type to
HttpCachingProxy. Then the WMS-queries are sending thru our proxy.

Using HttpProxy as Proxytype I have the following entries in my
proxy-logs:

If you like to test the proxy-stuff, you could set up InteProxy[1] on
localhost with python InteProxy.py  --workers=1 --debug-level=2
--rewrite-urls --config-file=demo.cfg --port=64609

and set your proxy-entries to localhost:64609 

InteProxy is a proxy to secure OGC-requests between server and client,
but it can also be used as a regular proxy (with some restrictions
though).

Because of sudden absents of the python-bindings I was unable to test
against the plugin installer, sorry :-(

It we had a noproxy-option, everything would be really fun!

Great advice Martin, I'll implement this right away, and fire off an

Hi Steven,

What Qt version are you using? Probably HttpCachingProxy and FtpCachingProxy does not exist in that version.

Marco

These two items were introduced in Qt 4.4. Usually the Qt documentation 
mentions when new things are added but in this case it does not.

A quick workaround is to bracket the two "else if {...} else if {... }" with
#if QT_VERSION >= 0x040400
#endif

Since this workaround ignores these values, a complete fix for Qt4.3 
should also prevent users from setting these values elsewhere.

Message-ID: <4cbd7b750901081433u7edf35dbr16d6c913c176ae6b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am wondering how we can get the modified features (added, deleted,
changed) features in a vector layer ? In fact, when commiting changes, I
would like to make a special processing on the new, deleted or changed
geometries. However, I do not found any method in the VectorLayer class to
retrieve these geometries. Any idea ?

Best regards,

As far as I know the data exists in the private members of the
QgsVectorLayer class and currently there are not any access methods (or
bindings) to them.  Things like:

QgsFeatureIds mDeletedFeatureIds;
QgsFeatureList mAddedFeatures;
QgsGeometryMap mChangedGeometries;

I had a similar need the other day in a python plugin and had to bail and
ended up doing what I needed another way
 but access to these would be
great.  Maybe file a ticket and see how the devs feel about it.

Thank you Aaron,

I found the private members, and added const & accessors for each of them. I
will fill a ticket about it to have a more stable solution.

Right. I uploaded the packages without GRASS support (Qt 4.4.3, SIP
4.7.9, PyQt 4.4.4, GSL 1.12 and QGIS 1.0.0).  Although the dependencies
in the setup.hints are probably not complete yet.

Message-ID: <d8ad40b50901091044o537d2647k824188b068517a14@mail.gmail.com>

Okay, so I'm getting my new raster algebra plugin working. Runs fine
at home on Windows with Qgis 1.0.0-preview2.

 I try it on Linux, on Qgis 1.0.0-Kore. Fails because of API changes,
so I fix those. Then it fails while playing with raster data from
gdal.

 What seems to be happening is that on Windows, everything uses numpy
arrays - so when I get raster data via python-gdal I get a numpy array
back, which I then manipulate using numpy functions, and pass it back
to python-gdal to write a new geoTiff. But with Ubuntu, I get a
Numeric array back, manipulate it with numpy functions, and then pass
a numpy array to python-gdal which promptly complains that the object
doesn't have a 'typecode' method (which only Numeric arrays have).

 I think the change happened between python-gdal 1.4 and 1.5. Is it
worth working round the Numeric array problem or does anyone know if
things are going to be updated soon? What does Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex
have? What python-gdal is available for MacOS?

 The workaround involves making sure I pass the right sort of array to
the writing functions, but that involves knowing what python-gdal
expects and copying the data when converting it to Numeric array.
Something worth avoiding. Oh well.

 Sorry this is less of a qgis problem and more of a python-gdal one...
But I'm sure you guys know the answer...

Message-ID: <19710172061.20090109214531@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

please check out our small new tool (first one in Python) - multiqml.
The idea is to add a capability to load a single qml-file to multiple
layers, thus making their appearance uniform. Great for rasters with
uniform color table like topoquads (it was made for those) and some other stuff.

While working on that I started thinking, may be it worth while
expanding on vector layers too. And ultimately - in the core,
may be through group-styling?

As usual, this is work in progress, so be nice! :)

notes, SVN, plugin repo link and little video to see it in motion is here:

Quite nice and useful, thanks!
It fills in a simple way a long standing wish.
I suggest to add it to standard repo.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 1.0: bug in map composer
Message-ID: <4968AB31.8090901@gis3w.it>

Hi all,

in the stable version 1.0 on Debian and on Ubuntu we have a crash when 
we work with the map composer.

When the map is already added, adding the scalebar crashes QGIS.
The following error message is given:

Fatal: ASSERT failure in QList<T>::at: "index out of range", file 
/usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qlist.h, line 391
Abandon

Adding the scalebar first and then the map works, but then QGIS also 
crashes when trying to modify the scalebar.

The bug is also in the bugtrack:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1479

This is a big bug for the usability of the map composer and for QGIS.
Is possible to fix this bug before of the release announcement?

Thank you.

Regards
Leonardo

If you attach your changes as a patch we can just apply it assuming it
does not break public api backwards compatibility. Thats assuming other
devs dont have any objects - I cant see it causing any problems.

OK, I will attach the patch to ticket #1482 in a few days.
Does my proposition in the ticket respect the coding standards ?

We dont use 'get' get prefix for accessors, so they should be called:

const QgsFeatureIds?& deletedFeaturesIds() const
const QgsFeatureList?& addedFeatures() const 
const QgsGeometryMap?& changedGeometries() const

Also dont forget the new methods should be added to the corresponding
sip file so that they appear in python bindings!

Finally, when you add methods, you should include a doxygen note to
indicate the method is new to QGIS 1.1 e.g.

/* Accessor for the list of features pending deletion when the layer is
next saved.
* @note this method was added in QGIS 1.1
* @return const QgsFeatureIds containing the features to be deleted.
*/


Best regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Snapping problem
Message-ID: <4cbd7b750901110452g719f17cdwf1655a135222ce0b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am currently trying to use the snapping capabilities of QGIS, and I face
some problems. When I edit a new geometry, I would like to know the vertices
which have been snapped.
So, I do this as follow, for example with a polyline

void QgsCGALArr2PluginGui::addInArrangement( const QgsPolyline &line )
{
    if ( !m_mapCanvasSnapper )
        m_mapCanvasSnapper = new QgsMapCanvasSnapper( m_mapCanvas );
    else
        m_mapCanvasSnapper->setMapCanvas( m_mapCanvas );
    // Differenciation des snaps sur sommets et sur segments
    QMultiMap < double, QgsSnappingResult > snappingVerticesResults,
snappingSegmentsResults;
    QMultiMap < double, QgsSnappingResult > globalSnappingVerticesResults,
globalSnappingSegmentsResults;
    // On commence par checker que des sommets de la polyligne n'existent
pas deja
    QString text(""), numericString;
    for (int i = 0; i < line.size(); ++i)
    {
        QgsPoint pt = line.at(i);
        // On teste le snap sur chacun de layers
          for (unsigned int j = 0;j<m_mapCanvas->layerCount();++j)
          {
              QgsMapLayer *currentLayer = m_mapCanvas->layer(j);
            QgsVectorLayer *vector = dynamic_cast<QgsVectorLayer *>(
currentLayer );
            if ( vector )
            {
                snappingVerticesResults.clear();
                snappingSegmentsResults.clear();
                vector->snapWithContext( pt , 5. , snappingVerticesResults ,
QgsSnapper::SnapToVertex );
                vector->snapWithContext( pt , 5. , snappingSegmentsResults ,
QgsSnapper::SnapToSegment );
                // On ajoute les resultats du layer courant aux resultats
globaux
                for ( QMultiMap < double, QgsSnappingResult >::iterator
it=snappingVerticesResults.begin();it!=snappingVerticesResults.end();++it)
                    if ( pt != it.value().snappedVertex )
                        globalSnappingVerticesResults.insertMulti( it.key()
, it.value() );
                for ( QMultiMap < double, QgsSnappingResult >::iterator
it=snappingSegmentsResults.begin();it!=snappingSegmentsResults.end();++it)
                    globalSnappingSegmentsResults.insertMulti( it.key() ,
it.value() );
            }
          }
    }
    for ( QMultiMap < double, QgsSnappingResult >::iterator
it=globalSnappingVerticesResults.begin();it!=globalSnappingVerticesResults.end();++it)
        text += numericString.setNum(it.key()) + "   " +
it.value().snappedVertex.toString() + "\n";
    text += "globalSnappingVerticesResults = " + numericString.setNum(
globalSnappingVerticesResults.size() ) + "\n";
    text += "globalSnappingSegmentsResults = " + numericString.setNum(
globalSnappingSegmentsResults.size() ) + "\n";

    // ...
}

In my project, all layers are "snappable" to vertices and segemnts, with a
tolerance of 5, and the units are in meter. That is why my toleance in the
snapWithContext is set to 5. The problem is that when I edit the geometry,
the snapping works well (the mouse is attracted when close to a vertex or
segment), but, the above code shows that snappingVerticesResults is empty.
So I do not understand why I cannot retrieve the snapped vertices.

In fact, I simply want to maintain a list of vertices, update it each time a
new geometry is added, but, be aware that if the new geometry has a common
vertex with an already existing geometry, do not add this vertex to the list
of vertices. Could you help ?

Best regards,

Olivier

PS: note that I also tried m_mapCanvasSnapper->snapToCurrentLayer(...) and
m_mapCanvasSnapper->snapToBackgroundLayers(...) without any success.

OK. Is there only one file to change python/core/sipcoreQgsVectorLayer.cpp ?

Right.

Finally, to make the patch, is it OK with the following command : diff -Naux
original modified > original.patch ?
Is there a special policy for the names of the patch files to attach to the
trac ticket ?

Best regards and sorry for all this boring questions,

Ok, tests are partly successfull.

I only have success when setting the proxy-type to
HttpCachingProxy. Then the WMS-queries are sending thru our proxy.

Using HttpProxy as Proxytype I have the following entries in my
proxy-logs:

localhost - - [08/Jan/2009 14:55:50] code 501, message
Unsupported method ('CONNECT') 
localhost - - [08/Jan/2009 14:55:50] "CONNECT

localhost - - [08/Jan/2009 14:55:50]
"CONNECT 212.95.126.11:80 HTTP/1.1" 501 -

If you like to test the proxy-stuff, you could set up InteProxy[1] on
localhost with python InteProxy.py  --workers=1 --debug-level=2
--rewrite-urls --config-file=demo.cfg --port=64609

and set your proxy-entries to localhost:64609 

InteProxy is a proxy to secure OGC-requests between server and client,
but it can also be used as a regular proxy (with some restrictions
though).

Because of sudden absents of the python-bindings I was unable to test
against the plugin installer, sorry :-(

It we had a noproxy-option, everything would be really fun!


Best regards

 CONNECT is what you use to set up an HTTP Tunnel, not an HTTP Caching
Proxy connection. HTTP tunnels are used to tunnel any protocol through
an HTTP server - such as FTP, or IM, or SSH. I think it's used by very
controlling network admins to make sure *everything* goes through
their central server. I think there was some confusion between HTTP
Tunnels and HTTP Caching Proxy systems in Qt recently.

Quick google gives this IETF draft - there's probably an RFC on it somewhere:
http://www.web-cache.com/Writings/Internet-Drafts/draft-luotonen-web-proxy-tunneling-01.txt

Barry,

it seems like most of your questions are answered in this page:

Hi all.
I noticed that on:
http://download.qgis.org/downloads.rhtml
there is a win package, but this is incomplete (no grass), as jef
explained. I think a *big* warning should be provided, clarifying that
an "official" complete build will be available soon, and that users are
suggested to wait until then. Otherwise, much confusion will arise, I'm
sure.
This is not to detract from jef's work, just to make things easier for
end users (who often do not rad carefully installation notes before
proceeding!).
All the best.

 Yup, that seems to be it. I've now got my Rasterlang plugin working
with either. It does its calculations with numpy, but converts back to
Numeric if necessary for passing to gdal to write a GeoTiff. Will make
a release soooon, meanwhile it's on google code.

 It also copes with some minor API changes between 1.0.0-preview and
-release - which I need until the Windows release! :)

Right.  QGIS and GRASS in OSGeo4W are still in a testing stage.  I
updated GRASS in OSGeo4W to 6.4svn and added the QGIS GRASS plugin.

But MSYS is still missing, so the shell won't work.

Hi John

Thank you for the feedback.
r9965 now scales the pattern in the legend boxes with the same factor as in 
the composer map. 

I still need to investigate the QBrush scaling, as the pattern output looks 
different depending on the print file format (ps, pdf, png).

Regards,
Marco

I'll try to take another look at your branch over the weekend or next  
week. I'm glad you were able to solve the scaling issue in the legend.  
That will be a great improvement. I don't know if your code fixes will  
have relevance in any of the main branch code. I recall Tim having  
some of these types of scaling issues in his Quick Print core plugin.  
Maybe there are some hints there.

Message-ID: <91357D6A-2DCC-48DB-ACE9-71AADE409AC0@kyngchaos.com>

I noticed that the final 1.0 downloads are listed at  
download.qgis.org.  From Paolo's comments, I take it there are some  
issues with the MingW build (which would include GRASS support for  
Windows).  Any ETA on that?

I'm just wondering if it was OK to link my OSX download on my site (no  
announcement there yet), since download.qgis.org has it.


Also, on the download.qgis.org page, something is stretching the table  
wider than my browser window.  In Firefox it's narrower than in  
Safari, so there is a lot more side-scrolling to read the notes column  
in Safari.

Hi Barry , hi list

Today I had the same problem with  Kore 1.0 and Ubuntu 8.10  (deb from
http://ppa.launchpad.net/jef-norbit/ubuntu)

I solved just editing
v.in.ogr.qgm
v.in.ogr.all.qgm

changing

<flag key="r" answer="off" hidden="no"/>  to  <flag key="e"
answer="off" hidden="no"/>

I suppose it's a trivial typo...anyway developers could confirm or not

Yes I've been adding them in as people make them available. I'm really
just waiting for the win mingw build before we make the official
announcments.

Marco Pasetti is working on this. He suggested he needs a week or so and
he's sounding a bit overworked so I'm trying not to harass him to much.
In the mean time Juergen is also making a MSVC build. If he reaches the
point of feature parity with Marco's build I will probably go ahead and
announce and then add Marco's in when he is ready.

If you can do it in a low key way, folks who are following the qgis
mailing lists, or who are regular visitors to your site could already
take benifit from your build, and folks who arent can find out about it
plus all the pertinent release announcement info when we make our
splash.

For me only the header part renders. Perhaps its something I put in one
of the comments. Gary suggests its something local on my pc. I will take
a closer look and see if some ropey html is being rendered...


Thanks as always!

Tim,

I'm also unable to see the table with download (running kubuntu,
firefox3). All the time I was wondering why there are no packages and
only link to download.osgeo.org is provided :-)

no, that's only a generated file. You'll need to modify
python/core/qgsvectorlayer.sip. Usually one needs to only copy the
definitions from .h file to appropriate .sip without more changes. If
you need some more help, just ask...

 It's Adblock plus on Firefox. Disable it and I see the table in
Firefox. Enabled, and there is no table. It must be something in the
id or class of the table in the Adblock rules.

 Also, you've still got the old OSGeo logo :)

 Found it. There's a rule in the EasyList + EasyElement (USA) Filterset:

#*(class$=sponsors)

 and for some reason the table has class="sponsors". Not particularly
sematically correct :)

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0901131537h5b01de34i7357819ebbe21957@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

recently I was trying to recreate MSYS environment to build QGIS on
windows. Finally I've ended up with a python script that is supposed
to do _everything_ for you:
- download sources / binaries
- unpack, compile and install all the libraries

Like this, one should be able to create or recreate MSYS environment
with minimal effort, all the necessary build steps (and patching) is
in the script, hopefully in a sane way that will allow to use newer
versions of software. So, what can it do right now:
- install initial build environment: msys + mingw + flex + bison
- install basic libs from source: zlib + libpng + sqlite + expat + gsl
- install GIS libs from source: proj + geos + gdal
- install GRASS from source: xdr + grass + gdal-grass
- install python support for QGIS from source: sip + pyqt
- install necessary postgresql files from binaries

So, basically everything you need to build QGIS. There's always some
space for more libs for gdal and grass, that's just a matter of
documenting the build and putting few lines of python code together.

Hopefully this can be start of the end of painful creation of MSYS
environment for QGIS build and some people will be able to use it
(maybe also Marco?). Currently I'm just a bit worried about grass
support in gdal which compiles, but qgis crashes when I try to open a
grass raster. Maybe a build problem, maybe something wrong in
gdal1.6.0 or grass6.4.rc1 - I haven't investigated.

And here's the link:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/msys/
(it's just one file + small unzip utility script)

With improved support of MSVC compilers in QGIS and in other packages,
it's worth discussion what compilator is better suited for QGIS
windows package.Whether we're going to use MSYS/MinGW or MSVC...
Pros/cons for both approaches are welcome :-)

Martin,
All I can say is WOW... so cool.  I will be giving this a go soon and will
let you know if I find any issues.  This is a great step forward toward
being able to better support the windows development of both QGIS and
plugins.  

Awesome job as always!

- install initial build environment: msys + mingw + flex + bison
- install basic libs from source: zlib + libpng + sqlite + expat + gsl
- install GIS libs from source: proj + geos + gdal
- install GRASS from source: xdr + grass + gdal-grass
- install python support for QGIS from source: sip + pyqt
- install necessary postgresql files from binaries

So, basically everything you need to build QGIS. There's always some
space for more libs for gdal and grass, that's just a matter of
documenting the build and putting few lines of python code together.

Hopefully this can be start of the end of painful creation of MSYS
environment for QGIS build and some people will be able to use it
(maybe also Marco?). Currently I'm just a bit worried about grass
support in gdal which compiles, but qgis crashes when I try to open a
grass raster. Maybe a build problem, maybe something wrong in
gdal1.6.0 or grass6.4.rc1 - I haven't investigated.

And here's the link:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/msys/
(it's just one file + small unzip utility script)

With improved support of MSVC compilers in QGIS and in other packages,
it's worth discussion what compilator is better suited for QGIS
windows package.Whether we're going to use MSYS/MinGW or MSVC...
Pros/cons for both approaches are welcome :-)

Great, yet another pain when trying to develop a web presence. Now you  
have check every add-on for FF to make sure you don't pick some random  
class name in your CSS. I changed it to 32 character md5sum of a  
random dictionary word. Not really but I wanted to...

Let me know if I picked another illegal name chosen at random by some  
other extension developer.

Part of the problem is the length of the urls with no whitespace,  
hence no line breaks. I made some changes, take a look...

Better.  Preformatted tags <pre> appear to force browsers to render a  
minimum cell width to fit the preformatted text, so the "Debian Lenny  
PPC" row comment is setting the Comment column width.

Firefox at least seems to be breaking URL lines in the Package column  
at directory separators '/', but there are still long filenames that  
are again forcing a minimum cell width (also looks like the Debian  
Lenny PPC row).  But Safari is not breaking those URLs, bleh.


PS. small correction - in the top Windows row, the Note should end  
with </p>, not <p>.

Very interesting read indeed.
How far you devs feel QGIS is from this ideal?
All the best.

nice.

In an alternative effort I packaged all necessary dependencies and QGIS
itself for OSGeo4W.  So you you need to setup Visual C++ and CMake and
get all the dependencies you need to compile QGIS precompiled from
OSGeo4W.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to load a PostGIS layer via v.in.ogr GUI?
Message-ID: <H00002eb040b843f.1231932013.srsofaioi6145.ktso.ch@MHS>

Hi 

To import a PostGIS layer it is necessary to define a table as layer
beside the dsn. Unfortunately the GUI doesn't offer the option "layer".
It seems to be  impossible to import a single PostGIS layer via
v.in.ogr. 

In former versions of QGIS the v.in.ogr GUI offered a select box with
all non GRASS layers loaded to QGIS. This was the much more easier way
to import non GRASS layers to GRASS. Especially with PostGIS layers
there was no need to know the DB-connection parameters. It was only
necessary to select a layer from the select box the import goes on. 

What are the reasons for the changes in the new GUI?

Regards
Horst

I think we now have feature parity, although I'm not very experienced
with GRASS and therefore cannot really test it.  AFAICS it works fine.

Marco,

I ended up needing to print a map yesterday so I tried your branch.  
The legend looks quite good now with proper symbol scaling. That is a  
huge improvement.

Cheers,
John

What I have identified what could be improved:
- documentation of design - there is automatically generated
documentation for API, however the high-level image ("architecture")
is not well documented (although it's relatively easy to understand)
- cookbook - we should prepare a series of "how do I" code snippets
for many common actions. This is much simpler way to get known to API
than studying the docs. I've started with some snippets on wiki, but
they're still missing much stuff:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PythonBindings
- "have a menu" - there's no feature plan for further releases - of
course it's impossible to create a plan like in commercial project,
but a good plan with direction where we're going would help - users
would know what they can expect and developers have more unified look
on the future
- blogging - IMHO blogging more on qgis blog would help to keep
project visible and let the users know it's active - new features, new
plugin in repository, fixed bugs, usage of qgis for something, useful
hints, rants, basically anything. (there might be someone aggregating
interesting stuff from qgis mailing lists ???)

But generally I have the impression that the developer and user
community is open, helpful and having fun building this masterpiece
:-)

Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E0118B80144@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi Martin,

I've just had a look at your PostGIS manager and I'm very impressed. A couple of things I thing could use improvement though:

1) When the plug-in first loads and connects to the DB, it can take along time for the GUI to yield if the DB has hundreds of relations. Under this scenario the GUI just hangs and gives you no indication as to what's going on. Maybe a status dialog (i.e. "connecting to database on server") and an hourglass cursor should be implemented.

2) When you select PostGIS tables in the "Database view" that are located in a schema that is not in the user's schema search_path I get the following error: "Unable to access relation" .....ERROR relation "table does not exist. SQL select * from table limit 1"

3) Currently I have a lot of database tables that have a large number of rows i.e. 100million+. When you first select a table from the Database view tree it seems to complete a full row count and then fetch all of the data for the table and preview views. From my observation any table that has more than 500,000 rows seems to take a long period of time to load. There are three things I would recommend implementing to improve large table support:

        i.   Do not complete a row count automatically for relations. Instead
           just display the estimated row count, then allow the user to
           complete a full row count on the table if required. See
           pgAdminIII for an example.

        ii.  Do not populate the rows in the "Table" tab unless it is
           active. If the Table tab is active then rows are populated in the
           grid using a scrollable cursor that fetches batches of rows as
           the user moves up and down table. Another option is to just limit
           the number of rows to a user defined amount. Again see pgAdminIII
           for an example.

        iii. Do not to render the spatial map preview, unless the "Preview"
           tab is active. If the Preview tab is active incrementally
           render the features (using parameters as defined in the QGIS
           Rendering Options). Also allow the user to cancel the render
           process with the "ESC" key

4) Under the relation metadata tab it would be nice to display the spatial extents of the layer in the PostGIS section. Maybe this should only be implemented for PostgreSQL server versions greater than 8.0 so the fast estimated_extent() SQL function can be used. Also just displaying the SRID is not very user friendly. It would be great if the user could click on the SRID to get the spatial reference system metadata i.e. name, parameters, datum etc.

5) Running SQL queries in the "SQL Window" that return more than 5000 rows is very slow. From my observation it seems the slow part is not returning the result from the database but loading the data into the results grid. This seems counterintuitive considering a similar sort of fetch and display occurs in the relation "Table" tab grid which is orders of magnitude faster.

6) It would be nice to have the query run-time displayed in the SQL window.

FYI I've been running PostGIS manager v0.4.3 with OSGeo4W QGIS v1.0 under WinXP SP2.

If you don't have time maybe I could have a look at fixing some these things :)

Thanks
Jeremy

this post is great, thanks for the link, Martin!

Just a note, we do blog and write articles about QGIS a lot lately,
about our projects, experiences and working stuff, so I guess it would be
nice to have a place somewhere on the QGIS website to link to other
places, may be something under "international".

yes, we are planning to have a news area on the new QGIS website and integrate
the QGIS blog and forum rss feeds. Here we could also link or add other news,
blogs, articles...

You could give us a link to your blog, articles and we have a look how we
could integrate them.

 Otto

Currently I don't work on new features for it (although there's still
a lot to be done in import/export), I'm doing just occasional
bugfixing. I would be happy to see any code contributions for those
suggestions! I'm adding them to my TODO list anyway so I don't forget,
however I don't know when I'll find time to implement them.

Ok thanks I won't have any time in the next month, but maybe after that. Do you have any hints for debugging QGIS python plug-ins on Windows?

Cheers,

You mean the package also includes the grass plugin? I see on the page
http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/pkg-qgis
there should be a separate package: qgis-grass-plugin, but I cannot find
it on the page. I cannot test the installer as I do not have win.
All the best, and thanks!

Debugging python plugins is practically the same on all platforms.
Just keep in mind that windows builds of QGIS usually run without
standard output, i.e. executing print statements from python won't
show anywhere. But if you open python console in QGIS, it should
redirect all output to the console (although there are some update
problems I think).

You can also use "logging" python module for some debug printouts.

Maybe python debugger will work too, but I've never tried it.

It would be nice to create a 'QGIS-Planet' in the same way that
kde-planet and gnome-planet aggregate blogs from their devs. Maybe this
can be done in your blog app Gary?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] crashing, autosaving, and 1.0
Message-ID: <681d07c20901172156i3e3dfdaej4d53de62c78fa660@mail.gmail.com>

Has autosave functionality been considered in Qgis?

I've used qgis off and on for years now, and I've trained myself to
save early and often to guard against the inevitable qgis crash (more
than any other program i use regularly for work in my standard ubuntu
environment).

Today, trying out qgis-1.0.0~hardy1, I forgot to save early and often.
 After playing with qgis for 2 hours, when i right-click in the
attribute table of a gpx layer, SHAZAM, my work disappeared in a
segfault.  I like qgis, and i learned a lot in those 2 hours, so this
doesn't really bother me, but...

As qgis hits 1.0, we would hope that the user-base would increase,
which tends to lower the mean user-base expertise and patience.
Autosave (and even versioning?) seems like a good (and simple??) way
to avoid a lot of "bad press" from new users, especially since the
qgis files are so small.

It only takes a few hours of lost work to create a strong emotional
aversion to a tool...

my 2 cents

Subject: [Qgis-developer] S57 map files
Message-ID: <eb2cc3420901180804n595d3dccyb333d388c1861f16@mail.gmail.com>

Hello the lists.

I have been trying to open S57 maps that I use at work in Qgis 1.0.0 without
too much success (I tried a few months ago on a previous version without
success either...).

Actions:
Fresh new Qgis project
Add a vector layer
Select the XXXXXXX.000 s57 file and click ok.

Results:
A new layer appears. Nothing gets displayed in the map window. The
attributes table for the layer is empty (there are some columns available,
but no data). No error is displayed on the console.

Research already conducted:
I have been trying to understand what was happening by browsing qgis and
gdal sources, and writing a python plugin to inspect the layer.
I think I can now say:
- OGR loads the map without any error (the s57 driver is correctly loaded,
and generates no error when given my data file)
- Qgis gets the layer from OGR without error. However, this layer as seen
trough the QgsVectorLayer or the QgsMapLayer interfaces (python plugin to do
that) presents 0 features and no subLayers. The extent is 0,0,0,0.

The file itself is good. I can convert it to Mapinfo or GML with ogr2ogr
even if some layers generate errors (s57 features that can't be converted to
other format I believe). All files that I have tried are used every day in
an ECDIS commercial system so I assume the data to be correct.

So here are my questions:
- has anyone ever worked with S57 and OGR and/or Qgis?
- I believe Qgis doesn't use the S57 sublayers and that's why nothing gets
displayed. Is there any chance that I am right? If I am right, I would like
to help with the implementation for this kind of problem. Can anyone in the
dev team give me directions on where to begin (I have spent some time in the
source and API of both Qgis and GDAL and feel I can contribute here...)

Thanks a lot.
Florian

Firstly I'm sorry you lost your work, its always an unpleasant
experience regardless of which software app you are using.

Version 1.0 breaks new ground in that for the first time we have a
stable branch. No new features will be added to 1.0 and all we will be
doing is releasing bug fixes as 1.0.x releases. Much work has already
gone into improving QGIS' stability for the 1.0 release, but nontheless
we are still in the beginning of the stabilisation process. Over time
these problems should be resolved...

As always file bugs and provide stack traces as if we dont have the info
about bugs we cant fix them.

Best Regards,

 I just had a quick go at writing an AutoSave plugin... It hooks into
the renderComplete signal so that on each redraw it checks whether it
auto-saved in the past N seconds, and saves if not. Currently it just
dumps to /tmp/qgs-save.qgs, but configuration will come later now I've
got the basics.

 What configuration would be appropriate? I reckon stuff like:

 * time interval between saves
 * directory/filename
 * versioning/pruning versions
 * datestamping
 * toggle on/off

Sorry it's too late to save your work!

Hi all,

I'm scribbling down in an attempt to teach myself a little
python plugins building and encountered several things, that I'm not
getting right so hope you can help me out. Those should be really easy
questions to answer:

1. docs
Looking for something ready I've encountered this [1], which is quite
outdated, as using old API (getMainWindow and such). The same problem
is with [2], which I can fix if there are no objections. But before, should we save it
as "before QGIS 1.0" version?

2. self.action.setWhatsThis("Configuration for test plugin")
Seems like setWhatsThis is not working for Python plugins, is it
so? I failed to find any changes regarding setWhatsThis.

Message-ID: <20090119091740.1716611f@nature>

Hi, 

we would like to announce a QGIS Developer Meeting (QGIS hackfest) from March
19-22 2009 at the Leibniz-University in Hannover, Germany. The meeting will be
held right after the FOSSGIS conference for people interested to join both
events. 

With the QGIS hackfest we want to get together people committed to improving the
Quantum GIS project. This includes developers, documenters, bug reporters etc.
The meeting will give a great chance to make decisions and tackle larger
problems, so we hope you will consider joining us. 

We provide all information about the QGIS Developer Meeting here:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/QgisHackfest2009

If you want to support the meeting, we are still looking for sponsors to be able
to cover meals or help to reduce travelling and accommodation expenses for QGIS
developers with far arrival. Please contact Paolo Cavallini, if you are
interested in sponsoring this event.

best regards,
 Otto

Hi,

   After reading the "Desktop GIS" book, downloaded qgis 0.10 and installed
0.11, downloaded the tutorial #1 with its required add-ons (cmake and other
libraries) with no success. I ask for some... SOS help!!

   The Tutorials are based (?) on release 1.0 but, what about the API made
with doxygen? In the latest release page, it says that 0.11 is the latest
whereas in the download page, 1.0 has gone from Preview 2 to stable and the
API docs is mentioned to be the most stable from now on.

   Now I am compiling the Tutorial 1 with a crash defining the
QgsSingleSymbolRenderer constructor which does not allow the usage of
QgsVectorLayer. Commenting that line it compiles and generates a non-working
demo but, at least, it seems that my installation is not bad.

   The *question are:* where to start/continue? recommended docs to read?
recommended version to download? extra example code?

   I want to create an application able to read raster and vectorial. Adds
several layers of symbology and interacts with other windows. Nothing
special

   Thanks in advance. And sorry if this post should be somewhere else.

   Jesus

Florian,

I *think* that the QGIS OGR vector layer only loads the first layer of
a multi layer dataset.  For S-57 this is usually the DSID layer (dataset id)
which has no interesting geographical features so nothing shows up.

I believe the correct solution is for QGIS to eventually support layer
selection  during loads from multi-layer OGR datasources.  I'm not sure if
there is working going on in this regard or not.

In the meantime, you could use ogr2ogr to convert desired layers into
shapefiles or some other useful intermediate format, and load those in
QGIS.

If my understanding of the situation is correct, I do consider this a
very significant weakness of QGIS and well worth correcting.

Best regards,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] printing with qgis
Message-ID: <20090119163821.GA28854@paradigm.rfc822.org>


Hi,
i started using qgis lately for my OSM work - I was trying to print
an arbitrary region for later survey. I found multiple annoyances while
printing. 

1. WMS Server size limit. Its nice to display the warning that
   overflowing the size constraints of a WMS server might cause the 
   data not to be printed. 
   It would be much nicer to show the warning when the requests fails
   and inform the user that the print failed (it makes no sense to print
   nothing)
  
   A much better solution would be to halve the request size until 
   the size constraints are satisfied and stitch together the result.

2. PDF Printing - PDF Printing might be very convinient for the 
   developer but burdens the load on providing postscript to the 
   printserver. I only found out because of 3) and a very slow print
   server (AMD K6 took hours to rip the pdf into postscript)

3. Buffered labels take ages to render in PDF and/or to print.
   I havent looked at the buffered Labels more closely but as a matter
   of fact some buffered labels cause my A4 print to take 3-4 hours
   to render on a AMD K6 Cups printserver using pdftops. Turning
   off buffered labels made the print nearly instantanious.
   I could also reproduce this by saving a pdf and opening with
   acroread. One could see acroread rendering the single label
   one ofter another in a very slow way (Intel Core Duo) 

This was all experienced with the debian packages:

	qgis_1.0.0-gfossit20081222-2_i386.deb

As the crashes also were quite annoying i am now running RELEASE_1_0_0
svn branch to collect backtraces ;)

Message-ID: <4974C0E4.5010505@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I'm checking through the bug tracker. I'm finding many bugs that have
been opened months ago (so they refer to older versions), and never
upddated (sometimes in spite of specific requests).
When they appear local and temporary problems, I would be inclined to
close them down, so we can concentrate on serious ones. I think this is
rather important: with almost 300 bugs open, I noticed sometimes devs
forget about them (even if they effectively solved them!). Having a
cleaner trac will help users and developers alike. Anyone objects?
See eg:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1429
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1398
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1427

All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] make permission errors
Message-ID: <49750CEC.10704@nuim.ie>

Hi devs,

I am trying to get fTools ready for including, and I've run into a 
slight problem. After copying the fTools directory into:

qgis_source_dir/python/plugins/

and adding all the relevant CMakeFiles files, I am unable to run ccmake 
without generating the following error:

 CMake Error: Cannot open file for write:
 /home/cfarmer/dev/cpp/qgis/build/python/plugins/ftools/Makefile.tmp

 CMake Error: : System Error: Permission denied

 CMake Error: Cannot open file for write:
 /home/cfarmer/dev/cpp/qgis/build/python/plugins/ftools/CMakeFiles/CMakeDirectoryInformation.cmak
 e.tmp

 CMake Error: : System Error: Permission denied

 CMake Error: Cannot open file for write:
 /home/cfarmer/dev/cpp/qgis/build/python/plugins/ftools/cmake_install.cmake.tmp

 CMake Error: : System Error: Permission denied

 CMake Error: Cannot open file for write:
 /home/cfarmer/dev/cpp/qgis/build/python/plugins/ftools/tools/Makefile.tmp

Similarly, running make generates an error (very similar to the above 
output), but completes by saving the temp makefiles to the build 
directory. This means I can make and install QGIS ok, but I'd like to 
resolve this issue before I commit anything to svn. I'm not sure why I'm 
getting this error, except perhaps that my fTools directory does not 
have the right permissions somehow?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

Carson

Hi there,
I usually don't follow the qgis-dev list but I happened to notice your
post by chance.


FYI I have spent some time working with ENC/S-57 data, the S-52 rules for
rendering S-57 data, and access via ogr so it can be used in software
like qgis, grass, and gpsdrive. It is an ongoing/reoccurring requests for
S-57 display with GpsDrive (which already has similar live map generation
from OpenStreetMap PostGIS vector DBs).


some links:
  http://grass.osgeo.org/wiki/S-57_data  (see QGIS plugin section)
  http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/gpsdrive/index.php?title=Marine_Howto#NOAA_ENC_vector_nautical_charts

  http://openev.cvs.sourceforge.net/openev/contrib/S52/


AFAIU OGR has access to the S-57 data well in-hand. But this gives you
access to a flood of cryptic data layers and for any sort of sane
rendering you will want to follow the S-52 rules. Rather than try and
do that manually (a nightmare), S52CS.c from libS52 is already there
waiting to be used. My idea was that as a start if a CLI wrapper tool
could be written around libS52 to export a table of active
"layer_name|RGB_values" for a given map scale & color scheme* those
layers could be automatically loaded/enabled with the given colors fed
into the QGIS layer Properties.

* (eg "bright day" or "night mode")

due to dynamic nature of S-52 display this would IMO best be done as a
qgis plugin with a few drop down menus to help you tune it to your needs.
(the rendering rules change with depth-of-ship [ground contours you can
collide with are more vibrantly colored], color scheme/brightness choice,
map scale [shows all layers at harbor-scales, hides some otherwise],
metadata layers interesting to map-makers but not end-users, etc)


AFAICT libS52 is near completion; I am in occasional contact with the
main devel, he's still interested.


As you can do serious physical damage if you trust this data too much,
and we propose to supply access to it free for anyone of any ability,
there is a bit more responsibility than normal to get things "right" and
support things like drop-in updates to keep it current.


off-topic but perhaps of interest:
- FWIW there is also some ongoing discussion over at GpsDrive wrt
rendering live AIS data via direct locally running parsing server or via
Gpsd (http://gpsd.berlios.de). [think modern air traffic control radar
screen but with data from large ships' transponders overlaid on the map]

- besides the new GDAL GRIB format driver, checkout the GPL'd "ZyGrib"
for real-time weather forecast downloads & mapping. (www.zygrib.org)

It would be good to make the plugin available through the standard repo,
so everybody could update it without reinstalling qgis.

Hi all.
We had several reports of problems in using the grass plugin on win. If
the program is not closed correctly, .gislock files can be left over,
and this makes it impossible to use the mapset again. It is probably
better solving this, eg by deleting .gislock every time qgis closes.
All the best.

If the lock file is left on the disk because of a program crash,
then trying to delete it on program close might not always work.

On the other hand, deleting a lock file present on the disk
on program startup (or rather: when the user connects to the
mapset) is not a good idea, because that file might be there
for a good reason (e.g. someone else working on the same mapset
over a network connection)!

There needs to be a mechanism to detect whether the GRASS plugin
or QGIS itself have crashed while connected to mapset A. If that is
true, then the GRASS plugin should tell the user, next time he or
she connects to mapset A, that a crash occured in the last session
and offer to remove the lock file.

Or perhaps a warning: "the mapset appears in use: are you sure you want
to proceed? Caution: this may result in data loss if another user or

Unfortunately, the GRASS lock file contains no information as to
who logged into the mapset last, so it will be hard for the user
to make an informed decision in some cases.

Maybe a good idea would be for the GRASS plugin to store its
own lock file with the current machine name and user name alongside
the GRASS lock file. That lock file should only get deleted if the
GRASS plugin cleanly logs out of the current mapset.
After a crash, it would still be present and the plugin could display
something like:

"The mapset appears in use by:"user name" on machine "pc name" are you
sure you want to proceed? Caution: this may result in data loss if 
another user or program is accessing the same data".

Of course, if the mapset was locked by, e.g. a regular GRASS shell,
that information will not be available and "user name" and "pc name"
will have to be displayed as "unknown".

In that case, one will have to rely on user wisdom and network file
access permissions to work properly ...

Nice idea. This could be an useful addition to upstream GRASS, rather
than on QGIS alone.

Right, the docs haven't been updated so far. Please go ahead and fix
the old information. You can put there a warning stating that the
information is valid for QGIS 1.0. I think saving pre-1.0 version is
not needed.

My guess is that you get permission denied error because that
directory where ccmake wants to write some files doesn't exist, does
it? Probably you need to call cmake to create the directory structure
before calling ccmake...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] color ramp shader in python
Message-ID: <d8ad40b50901200458n482af52jfb0d74c2e325b202@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

 I want to setup a custom colormap shading of a raster in Python.
Previously I did:

        self.setValueClassification(schemeVCL)
        self.setCustomClassificationEnabled(True)
        self.setDrawingStyle(self.SINGLE_BAND_PSEUDO_COLOR)

Where schemeVCL was a list of QgsRasterLayer.ValueClassificationItem objects.

Now it's all changed, but I can't see how to set the color map of a
shader in Python. QgsColorRampShader doesn't seem to be wrapped, and
there's no colorTable() method on raster layers either.

 The only way I can see to do it is to write a QgsRasterShader in
python, but that would be duplicating what a QgsColorRampShader does
anyway, and it would probably be much slower because it'll be calling
back to python for every colour look-up.

 Or am I doing it wrong?

Hmm... this is a reason why I think that python plugins inside qgis
sources are not a very good idea - it brings additional maintenance
cost for developers. When someone fixes a python plugin in qgis (and
isn't owner/maintainer of the plugin), he is supposed to notify also
author so he can upload updated version so that others can make use of
it.
Am I making some sense?

IMO we shouldn't keep python plugins inside qgis sources (plugin
installer is the only one I would keep there) and just include some
good plugins directly to the release if it's really desired that
people get some plugins.

So in this situation I think Gary as the creator should upload new
version to repository...?

I think we should have a proper plugin infrastructure, analogous but
separated from C++ source code.
Ideally this should:
- allow devs with privileges to upload their plugin
- do some consistency check (removing hidden, unnecessary files, .pyc
etc.) and pointing out missing elements (licence, minimum version, etc.)
- generate automatically the relevant entry in plugins.xml
- allow the maintainer to mark each plugin with the appropriate category
(sandbox, experimental, unstable, testing, stable), so users are warned
(but still allowed and encouraged to experiment).
Feasible?

Hi Marco,

I could compile with success but now I'm trying to prepare MS-Windown but
the pythonQT link doesn't work.

I've been looking for the same version (PyQt-win-gpl-4.4.2.zip)  and I found
it, but when I do the make many errors are reported.

"qgis python previous declaration `long int InterlockedCompareExchange"

it's same two libraries who define the same function

any ideas?? thanks!

I'm updating the whole build environment in these days. I hope to close the
task as soon as possible.

Sure. The only one important thing is to increase the version number to make the 
installer upgrading it (of course in the svn too).

I don't upload it yet, because the discussion is still open and the fixed plugin 
is not tested well with 1.0.0 as I think.

Yes, it's inconvenient. However there isn't too many pythonists with svn access 
and we're all in contact. So I don't see it as a big problem. At least now...

Or even keep them only in the main repository and provide a repo snapshots for 
machines without internet access.

A big advantage of the new repositories is that any admin can upload fixes 
without affecting the plugin ownership. So it's quite easy to do

Where do you mean the infrastructure should be implemented? In the svn or just 
in existing repositories?

I think it would be too many categories too keep it all clean. Someone would 
have to evaluate them again and again. Now we have the two categories (official-
stable and the rest). However we can implement the additional tag with 2 or 3 
categories (experimental/testing/stable) to separate the plugin stage from its 
origin.

In this case users could enable unofficial repositories but still mask e.g. 
experimental plugins. Also plugins could be available in various versions 
(older-stable and newer-unstable) so users would be able to easy downgrade to 
the stable one.

If the version of an officially included plugin (plugin_installer, 
mapserver_export, ftools) in /home/user_name/.qgis/python/plugins is 
more recent than the the version in /usr/local/share/qgis/python/plugins 
which one does qgis load?

If the one in .qgis is preferentially loaded, then this eliminates the 
issues associated with newer plugin versions being released faster than 
newer version of QGIS...

Does that make sense?

Yes; the point is, we have to have a repo where the newer plugins are
uploaded (in addition to svn). So, more work for devs, which is not a
good thing. Unless we automatize it.
All the best.

I think automation is a very real possibility. It wouldn't be too hard 
to write a python script that takes the python plugin source from svn 
and generates a zip file which is then uploaded to the official repo. 
This could be a nightly build, or if we really wanted to could be run 
each time a plugin is changed in svn. I don't know much about svn, so 
this last bit might not be possible/easy, but a nightly build certainly 
wouldn't be a problem... I think Barry was looking into something 
similar for his Google code svn sites...

My two cents, ;-)

That's definitely easy: you can hook a script to an svn commit.

Hi all,

Imagine you need to digitize 1000 points without entering any attributes, just
points. If after a while pressing ok on pop-up "enter attributes"
window will drive you mad (like me), then this patch will work.

It adds a checkbox in Properties\Digitizing, that allows to switch
pop-up window on and off.

Tested on Ubuntu with shapefiles, some more testing will be helpful, will
appreciate any comments, digging in the core is new to us.

Exactly: that's the reason of the warning I suggested. Then, if the user
wants to go ahead, he should be allowed to do so (he'll be able to rm
the .gislock by hand anyway, so no additional security, only more
cumbersome).
All the best.

Hi Martin,
    
I had a brief look at the symbology-ng plugin recently. It is really 
phantastic how many new possibilities of symbolisation can be used and I'm 
really looking forward to the day we have this in core. I also like the design 
as it seems straightforward to add new subclasses of symbol layer for all kind 
of symbols. It also enhances the level of compatibility with SLD for QGIS (and 
QGIS mapserver).
    
I also have a couple of questions:
    - arrows: wouldn't it be more consequent from a design point of view to 
have a subclass of LineSymbolLayer for arrows, e.g. ArrowLineSymbolLayer, 
instead of a member variable in LineSymbol? Imagine people may add tons of 
other line decoration types and options for those types.
    - renderers: there is no continuous color renderer any more. In my 
opinion, it is not necessary that you add one, but the design should allow it 
to create continuous renderers as they may be quite usefull for cartographic 
purposes. From what I saw in the code, it seems to me there is would be no 
problem in implementing such type of renderers. Is that true or did I overlook 
something?
    - api compatibility: Do you think there is a way to maintain api 
compatibility with the new symbolisation? Otherwise the new symbology code had 
to go into a branch first because it changes the way that QgsVectorLayer and 
QgsRenderer interact. That would mean it can be in stable branch for QGIS 2.0 
(which I think is unfortunately pretty late).
    
    cheers,
    Marco

What plugins should be included in the infrastructure - only the
official ones or any plugins?
It would be a good thing to have such infrastructure (repository +
automatic uploading) so that plugin developers don't have to worry
much about that.

But is there someone commited to set up such infrastructure and maintain it?

I'm thinking of writing RFC for it very soon, I would like to get it into 1.1.

Btw. it might be interesting to survey if it's already a superset of
SLD capabilities and if not, what's missing.
In comparison with current QGIS rendering capabilities, it lacks only
a few advanced things: transparency setting, symbol size and rotation
based on attribute values

Well, but adding ArrowLineSymbolLayer would mean that people will need
to duplicate code from SimpleLineSymbolLayer and implement the
decoration. And I don't like the idea of code duplication.

But probably it would be wise to move arrow decoration from LineSymbol
to LineSymbolLayer but keep it available for any line symbol. What do
you think?

I've left out continuous renderer intentionally. I had more reasons for that:
- you can effectively use graduated renderer with enough classes - in
fact one could implement continuous renderer as graduated renderer
with fixed number of classes (e.g. 100), fixed symbols and a
configurable color ramp
- there are some technical problems (at least in current
implementation in QGIS): symbols are recreated for every value (i.e.
slowness), it has very few configuration options (e.g. only linear
interpolation) ...
- looking at other GIS software I haven't seen continuous renderer
anywhere, so I consider it as not important

I think that will be possible. Imagine that we add
QgsVectorLayer::drawV2() function that will use new rendering
capabilities, while the original QgsVectorLayer::draw() will keep
working. Similarly, the new classes might be kept in an other
directory and with different names, e.h. QgsSymbolV2, QgsRendererV2.
Once this will be implemented in core library, it will be possible to
alter QgsMapRenderer, QgsMapCanvas and QGIS user interface to use the
new classes.

I'll put details into the RFC.

Maybe you know the decorator pattern from the 'design pattern' book (Gamma et al.). I think that would be the most elegant solution for this problem as it allows to add new decorations by adding new subclasses. The code duplication is avoided by a reference to another LineSymbolLayer object and by calling the 'renderPolyline' method of that object before drawing the arrow.

Hm, it's not clear to me how QgsMapRender knows if it should call the old draw method or the new one.
But I'm going to read the RFC.

Right, using decorator patter might be a solution. But... in fact what
other decorations will we need? I can't really think of more useful
decorations now.

I'm asking that with KISS principle in mind: unnecessary complexity
should be avoided. Adding support for additional decorators might lead
to more complex code, more complex GUI and new bugs...

There are some possibilities - e.g. adding a function
QgsMapRenderer::setRendererVersion() with an enum as a parameter which
would determine whether QgsRenderer or QgsRendererV2 should be used in
rendering.

but using these setting in qgis -> preference -> language

i've the mixed "en+russian" labels :

Howdy Mac folks.

I am a Mac idiot and I could use a little guidance. I am trying to build 
one of our plugins for use with the 'all in one' OSX bundle. For past 
releases I have been successful but I just can't seem to get it right 
for the v1.0.0 release.

I am using the frameworks from the kyngchaos site. I can build QGIS ( 
using Branches/Release-1_0_0 ) just fine and the plugin works just fine 
for my own build of QGIS.

I have attached an otool dump of the v1.0.0 distribution's north arrow 
plugin and my packaged plugin for reference. The only things that jump 
out at me are :
libnortharrowplugin.so:
    @executable_path/lib/libqgis_core.1.0.dylib (compatibility version 
0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
    @executable_path/lib/libqgis_gui.1.0.dylib (compatibility version 
0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
    @executable_path/lib/libgeos_c.1.dylib (compatibility version 6.0.0, 
current version 6.2.0)

vs.

libevis.so:
    @executable_path/lib/libqgis_core.1.0.dylib (compatibility version 
1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
    @executable_path/lib/libqgis_gui.1.0.dylib (compatibility version 
1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
    @executable_path/lib/libgeos_c.1.dylib (compatibility version 4.0.0, 
current version 4.0.3)


In the past I have problem when the QT libs did not match exactly. Any 
suggestions?

It looks like maybe something went wrong in Tom's 1.0 compilation so  
that it dropped the version numbers.  So there is a version mismatch  
between your plugin and Qgis.

Also, you say you are using my frameworks - GEOS and GDAL, it looks  
like?  Then are you using install_name_tool to change the library  
references in your plugin?  Same problem, though backwards.  I build  
my GEOS framework with the C++ and C APIs combined, thus they can't  
have the two different version numbers, so I use an arbitrary  
numbering system.  I *think* Apple's runtime linker compatibility  
versioning doesn't operate at all across major versions, forwards *or*  
backwards (at least, I've had problems in the past trying to do so).

Well, since you're using my frameworks to build your plugin, and your  
own Qgis, try it out on my Qgis 1.0?  No need to change the library  
paths for GEOS or GDAL.

If you just want to make sure it will work on distributed Qgis  
binaries, Tom may have to try rebuilding to get those version numbers  
in there.

Go to a vector drawing program, say inkscape. Draw a line and go to 'stroke style'. You'll find about 50 types as 'begin markers', 'middle markers' and 'end markers'. I think it would make the class LineSymbol very hard to read if all of those would be hard coded the same way as the _draw_arrow function is now.
And there are more possible decorators for special purposes. Think of cold front and warm front symbols in meteorology. Or another one would be middle markers in certain distance interval (so not at the edge points).
But you might also keep the arrows hardcoded as they are now and additional ones could be added as decorators (e.g. by third party people with special purpose applications).

Marco

I think that would be the most elegant solution for this problem as it allows to add new decorations by adding new subclasses. The code duplication is avoided by a reference to another LineSymbolLayer object and by calling the 'renderPolyline' method of that object before drawing the arrow.

Right, using decorator patter might be a solution. But... in fact what
other decorations will we need? I can't really think of more useful
decorations now.

I'm asking that with KISS principle in mind: unnecessary complexity
should be avoided. Adding support for additional decorators might lead
to more complex code, more complex GUI and new bugs...

There are some possibilities - e.g. adding a function
QgsMapRenderer::setRendererVersion() with an enum as a parameter which
would determine whether QgsRenderer or QgsRendererV2 should be used in
rendering.

Yes, just downloaded your frameworks again today and yes I am using 
install_name_tool to change the reference to match the QGIS binary 
distribution.

I don't think it does and I want to say that that is the same across 
minor numbers as well. When I first started trying to compiled for OSX I 
my QT version was one minor version number different (newer) and the 
plugin would not load. Once I changed Qt versions it loaded up just fine.

I tried the version from your site Qgis 1.0.0-1 for Leopard. It 
immediately crashed at first. Seems that the GDAL 1.6 framework requires 
postgres, though it is not listed as a dependency. Once I installed the 
postgres framework qgis loaded but when I add my plugin it crashes again

There is still a different in the GEOS version numbers. The north arrow 
plugin shows GOES lib compatability version 4.0.0, current version 
4.1.0, when I build with your GOES framework ( 
GOES_Framework-3.0.3-1.dmg ) that is online, I get compatability version 
4.0.0, current version 4.0.3

aye, it would be good to hear if any other folks have had trouble.

Hi QGIS devs,

If there are no objections from your side, I'm going to merge the advanced printing branch 2 in the next days to trunk. I know there are a couple of pending bugs for printing, but they are also present in trunk, so not related to the printing branch that is to be merged.
The merge will add usefull features like printing templates, alignment functions and a better symbol preview for composer pictures.

Thanks for pointing me to Inkscape's stroke style options! It gave me
some additional insight of the possible decorators. This leads me to
an idea to draw arrows (and/or other decorations) as a symbol layer.
There is already MarkerLineSymbolLayer which draws markers along the
line - basically it has the same meaning as "middle markers" in
Inkscape. So you're able to draw cold and warm fronts in case you
provide necessary symbols - see my test:
http://www.mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/symbology-ng-meteo.png

The implementation of line decorators then could be done in two possible ways:
- option in marker line symbol layer telling whether it should act as
begin/end or middle marker
- new line symbol layer that draws exclusively (user-selectable)
decorations at the begin and/or end of the line.
These options should eliminate additional core code complexity.

Hi list

I just tryied the osgeo4w installer to install qgis and python qgis
great job !

I get a strange python error at startup 
can't load PyQgis, so it disables plugin manager and python console, and of
course all the python plugins

May it come from my python path ? (see screenshot )
Do i need to install other deps from OSgeo4w ?
How can i solve this problem ?

Thanks

Yes, minor and point version number changes should not cause  
problems.  So, if you compile to a library with ver 2.1.0 +  
compatibility ver 2.0.0, then at runtime it finds a ver 2.1.1, or  
2.2.0, and probably 2.0.0, it will work.  It won't work at runtime  
with a ver 1.1.0, or with a ver 3.0.0 - the major versions are  
different.  Minor.point compatibility versions are a minimum, major  
compat versions are absolute.

Argh!  I'm working on a better build environment for my GDAL  
framework.  The postgres lib link should be in my post-processing.  I  
got this right for the Leopard build, but missed it in the Tiger  
build. (so it sounds like you are on Tiger?)

I'll package a new GDAL framework later today.

Nope that was with the Leopard build ( Qgis 1.0.0-1 for Leopard )

Sorry if there was confusion. The libnortharrowplugin.so output in the 
original email is from the 'all in one' OSX bundle found on the

I guess you have ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll in your %WINDIR%\system32
Those clash with the DLLs in %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin.  See also [1] and [2].

I ran into a snag trying to setup a python development environment on

However if I do this the PyQT Designer fails to load. Some weird

Then my current GDAL framework, 1.6.0-4, should not have this postgres  
problem on Leopard.

So, where did the GEOS current version 4.1.0 come from? ... Oh, my  
Qgis.app... Ah!  I have a dev version of GEOS 3.1 installed, and  
forgot to enable the stable 3.0 when building Qgis.  But, Qgis should  
still be OK with using GEOS 3.0.


So, are you intending to distribute a plugin binary?  Or just source,  
and you just want to test various Qgis distributions?

For a binary, the plugin should use the same dependencies (GEOS, GDAL)  
as the target Qgis distribution, there are no guarantees that  
different distributions will use compatible dependencies.

With my Qgis, it's relatively simple, since my dependencies  
(frameworks) include the header files.  But with the all-in-one Qgis,  
it doesn't include these headers, so you need to get them somehow.   
Mixing headers from my frameworks with the library binaries in Qgis  
all-in-one could work, as long as they are the same versions.  There  
might be linking trouble because of the embedded relative paths in  
those libraries.

But the way you are trying to do it - linking to my frameworks, then  
redirecting the plugin to the all-in-one libraries - is risky, because  
there is no guarantee of compatibility, as you are finding.

Sorry but it do not work. In order to get this build 
(http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/unixport/Qgis-1.0.0-1-Leopard.dmg) 
to run with this GDAL framework 
(http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/unixport/GDAL_Framework-1.6.0-4.dmg) 
I had to install this postgresql framework 
(http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/unixport/PostgreSQL-8.3.5-1.dmg).

With out the postgres framework, your version of qgis would not start, 
and when started from the command line this is what I got.
localhost:MacOS pete$ ./qgis
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/pgsql/lib/libpq.5.dylib

That is correct.

Even with all of the other frameworks the same (except the GOES), the 
plugin still causes your version of QGIS to crash.

This is _exactly_ part of the problem. There seems to be several 
different flavors of libs being used to build the binary distributions, 
which are not exactly the same as the ones found on the build 
instructions on the wiki. So without the availability of a common 
(accessible) set of libs/frameworks for developers to link against, then 
it looks like it may be impossible for people to deploy binary plugins 
for Mac users.

I'm cooked on mac issues today...

First of all you should update to a more recent version of QGIS, either
1.0.0-preview2 [1] or 1.0.0-stable [2].

Hmm, I can't find anything in the GDAL framework or Qgis.app that  
references /usr/local/pgsql/lib/libpq.5.dylib.  libpq should be a  
relative reference, with @loader_path.

What does this tell you in a Terminal (for libpq):

otool -L /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.6/GDAL

I believe the wiki instructions refer to my frameworks as available,  
plus building a couple other oddball ones from source.  Tom uses his  
own library builds for the all-in-one.

But really, it shouldn't matter what Qgis itself uses for extra  
dependencies - external libraries or frameworks, or bundled.  And it's  
not really up to Qgis to provide these itself (bundled).

You can make your plugin with whatever dependencies you like,  
independent of what Qgis uses.  You just need to make sure that they  
are available somehow, either packaged with the plugin (or linked as  
static libraries, which is good for oddball libraries), or in Qgis  
(not recommended, except for Qt and Qgis libraries) or separately  
(like my frameworks).

Just build the plugin, ie with my frameworks, and don't change those  
references, just the Qgis and Qt references.  Though there is  
something wrong in the all-in-one build with the Qgis library  
versions, which should be fixed for it to work at all.

Message-ID: <4977C134.8000704@gmail.com>

Hi gang,

Can anyone tell me why when I attempt to intersect the geometries of 
these two features[1], I get an empty geometry?

The really odd bit is that differencing or combining the geometries 
works fine... just not intersection... exporting to wkt yields nothing 
for intersection (i.e. empty), whereas exporting the difference or 
combination of the geometries prints out nicely.

Any tips or hints are much appreciated...

Cheers,

Hi Martin,

Perfect. I also think it is a good idea to draw decorations as symbol layers.

Thanks for pointing me to Inkscape's stroke style options! It gave me
some additional insight of the possible decorators. This leads me to
an idea to draw arrows (and/or other decorations) as a symbol layer.
There is already MarkerLineSymbolLayer which draws markers along the
line - basically it has the same meaning as "middle markers" in
Inkscape. So you're able to draw cold and warm fronts in case you
provide necessary symbols - see my test:
http://www.mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/symbology-ng-meteo.png

The implementation of line decorators then could be done in two possible ways:
- option in marker line symbol layer telling whether it should act as
begin/end or middle marker
- new line symbol layer that draws exclusively (user-selectable)
decorations at the begin and/or end of the line.
These options should eliminate additional core code complexity.

Martin

 What I'm trying to do is control the mapping of values to colors -
for example I need 0.0 to be green, 0.5 to be white, and 1.0 to be
red, with smooth rgb transitions between. You can do this from the GUI
by going to the properties/symbology dialog and setting up a custom
colourmap. In the C++ API that uses QgsColorRampShader objects, which
don't seem to be available in the python bindings.

 What I'm giving the user is a way to load in these particular rasters
and then I have a menu of a small number of predefined colour schemes
that are appropriate to the data.

 I've currently worked round it by constructing a QDom document based
on what you get when you save the style from the symbology dialog,
inserting the color mapping that I need, and then using
layer.readSymbology.

PS aagh! I've started spelling 'colour' as 'color' :)

the name of the function is "actioMoveVertex", i think,

Hi Carson,

from a quick check I see that the resulting geometry is geometry
collection - the intersection is polygon and polyline from shared
border. Support for geometry collections isn't implemented in QGIS
(wkbType returns "Unknown"). Here are my ideas for you:

1. implement support for geometry collections: probably a partial
implementation allowing to retrieve parts of geometry collection from
GEOS would suffice for the begin.

2. implement relate() function using GEOS which would take a geometry
and intersection matrix as parameters. In the intersection matrix you
could specify that you're not interested in boundaries so you should
get just polygons.

3. for problematic cases use this trick (G1 and G2 are geometries for
intersection):
 - Gx = G1.combine(G2)
 - Gy = G1.symDifference(G2)
 - G = Gx.difference(Gy)
Now G should contain the intersection, without the border. It works
with your test case, I think it should work in other cases too. This
option takes least effort (no C++ coding) but is also least effective,
so it's your choice :)

Barry,

does this mean that you just need to wrap QgsColorRampShader class and
you're done? If so, I can wrap it.

Actually this went to 1.0.0 but Juergen fixed it few days ago in SVN trunk.

 Not sure. It may also need the objects mentioned here:

http://doc.qgis.org/classQgsColorRampShader.html

 so I would be able to create a QgsColorRampShader and ten call
setColorRampItemList, which means I need ColorRampItem as well...

 I'm trying to make what I'm doing work with 1.0, but I imagine it's
too late for that now!

 The readSymbology() method is working okay anyway, so low priority for me.

It looks like a bunch of raster classes have been forgotten to be wrapped...

Right, 1.0.1 or 1.1.0 would be needed if I wrap any new classes.

These are all much more complicated than I wanted, but that's life I

If I did implement this (as a partial implementation) would you 
recommend simply returning the geometry  collection as a list of 
geometries, or retrieving parts of the collection based on some input 
parameter (i.e. retrieve polygons only). From an initial glance at the 
GOES api, this first implementation looks possible, but I'm not a strong 
c++ programmer, so I'll likely have to run it by others once I'm done...

I don't know if it would be helpful or not, but Qt has a QValueVector 
class that could be implemented as a QgsGeometryCollection to represent 
the geos geometry collection.

According to the Qt docs:

QValueVector<T> defines a template instance to create a vector of values 
that all have the class T. QValueVector does not store pointers to the 
members of the vector; it holds a copy of every member, which is why 
QValueVector is said to be value based.

If I can't get option 1. going, I'll have to go this route I think...

PS. Something occurred to me about distributing a plugin binary - Qgis  
isn't properly setup for 3rd-party plugins.  This requires (on OSX,  
but not necessarily other platforms):

- an external plugin dir, like in the user's home folder.  It's not a  
good idea to install 3rd-party plugins inside an application's bundle  
on OSX.  I don't know if Qgis has this option, but it's dependent on  
the next requirement.

- it can handle an arbitrary location for the Qgis application.  Users  
can and will move and/or rename the Qgis application.

This relocation flexibility has a couple parts:

- the plugin is compiled with the -bundle flag, which is true now

- the plugin does NOT reference any library inside the Qgis  
application package.  And there's the problem.  Normally, the -bundle  
flag gets around the problem of linking the main binary of a program  
(qgis) because that binary is assumed to be loaded already, but Qgis  
plugins also link the Qgis *libraries* and the Qt frameworks.

I'm not sure if the -bundle flag works for secondary linked libraries  
(ie qgiscore as linked from qgis), but I think it should.  It would be  
worth trying to compile your plugin by linking only GEOS and GDAL, no  
qgis or Qt, something like:

-bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup -framework GEOS -framework GDAL

This would also solve the problem of the incorrect library versions in  
the all-in-one build.

Heck, if we figure that qgis also loads the GEOS and GDAL libraries,  
you could also leave those out, then there wouldn't be the GEOS  
version problem.  You just have to assume that builds of Qgis will use  
the same GEOS and GDAL major versions, which could be dangerous.

(The safe way would be to compile separate plugin binaries for each  
Qgis distro.)

The approach with returning a list of geometry parts looks like a more
flexible approach to me.

Looking in Qt docs, QValueVector is only legacy Qt3 class - use
QVector<T> instead, e.g.:
QVector<QgsGeometry> parts();

(or maybe QVector<QgsGeometry*> )

Exactly, the one in the "user space" masks the "system" one, regardless of that 
which one is newer. The next Installer will also compare both versions and warn 
if there is any obsolete plugin masking a newer one.

	drivers
Message-ID: <51464.193.246.86.39.1232641465.squirrel@webmail.customers.iirc.at>

Hi all,

I wrote a Python plugin that uses the QSqlDatabase object with PostgreSQL.
While the deployment works fine on Linux and Windows, I get an error
message on Mac OS X with an error message "Driver not loaded".

I am wondering if there are binary frameworks for the PostgreSQL driver
that can be used with Postgresql and QT - I would like to avoid having to
install a development environment on each Mac OS X client where I have to
install the QGIS plugin.

Anyone knows if such binary drivers for OSX exist and where I could get
them? How do others deploy such plugins that need PostgreSQL a connection?

The interesting thing is that the Postgresql connection seems to work
already in QGIS (for loading spatial tables), it just doesn't work with my
own plugin.

Thanks,
Andreas

Are you using prebuilt Qgis binaries? (mine or Tom's all-in-one)  Both  
have libpq bundled in the package, and Qgis handles postgres on its  
own, as far as I know, not with the Qt database driver.  Neither  
binary distribution includes the Qt postgres plugin.

Qt needs to be compiled with libpq in order to have PostgreSQL in
QSqlDatabase.   QGIS uses libpq directly instead of requiring a
PostgreSQL enabled Qt.

They use psycopg2 (at least the PostGIS Manager plugin does).

I've nearly forgotten to note here that big event:

Yesterday we've reached 10.000 revisions of QGIS source code!!!

Happy winner of the "10.000th commit" contest is Otto with his
documentation fixes.

Let's hope that after ten thousand more commits QGIS will finally
conquer the world ;-)

That would be my fault. I had them wrapped at one time but was having 
some troubles getting them to compile, so they got set aside, then time 
just slipped away. I am looking through my notes trying to recall why 
there was a problem, but I am not seeing it.

I think the color ramp shader class may need more accessors for it to 
work from  python, I am not thrilled with the use of the QLists but I 
kinda just expanded upon what was already there.

QGIS can deal ok with third party plugins, but there is room for 
improvement. However, my problems are largely a mac specific packaging 
issue, i.e., I can't easily link to the shared libraries that are being 
distributed with the application.

Nonetheless I have found a solution (which I don't think is acceptable 
but it works). I took all of the libs out of the 
__app/Contents/MacOS/lib and placed then in my development directory ( 
/Users/pete/devel/libhack), then using install_name_tool changed all of 
the @executable_path/lib/ to /Users/pete/devel/libhack. Then I compiled 
my plugin and linked to the hacked libs, which works just fine because 
they are after all shared libs, the problem is that the linker can't 
deal with the @exe.. reference.

Ack, something's very wrong.  You say you installed on OSX Leopard?   
Those are the wrong library versions for the system.  Somehow the  
Tiger GDAL was installed by the installer.


PS.  The system version answers the question of backward compatibility  
in the library major version.  So, if built with my GEOS with  
compatibility version 4.0.0, then loading the all-in-one libgeos with  
version 6.2.0, that part should work.  We're just left with the broken  
libqgis_core and libqgis_gui version number in the all-in-one.

While I am understand where you are coming from I would make the
following points:

- in South Africa and many other countries in the world, people do not
have easy access to the internet. So what they install with the QGIS
installer is all they can use. If we make the sole means of distributing
plugins the plugin installer the internet they will miss out on many
great and useful enhancements to QGIS.

- I would like to see in the 1.x release series more rich functionality
becoming standard 'out of the box' part of QGIS via python or c++
plugins. I guess one possible approach would be to package them in such
a way that they deploy to the user's .qgis dir on first run of QGIS and
then can be updated thereafter if the user has internet access.

- When we ship QGIS it would be good to ship versioned plugins that
correspond to the release of the QGIS version we are putting out. This
will prevent the situation that a person installing older version of
QGIS (e.g. v1 instead of v1.4) can still get the plugins associated with
the version they are using. Although I guess we can work around this by
having the official plugins hosted in QGIS svn but outside of the c++
codebase, and then coordinate with plugin writers to have their plugins
go through the same release cycle core QGIS does.

W0000t! I saw we were heading towards 10k revisions and was planning to
commit some totally meaningless change to snag it.....I guess I took my

I'd love to see this merged also. My tests a week or two back were  
positive, and I'd like to ditch a separate build for printing maps. :-)

I still have no good luck deploying my Plugin with the Postgresql driver
dependency.

These Apple computers don't have gcc and other dev tools installed and it
would be quite an efforts to install all the necessary dev-tools on each
Mac.

I was neither able to install Psycopg nor the necessary qtsql drivers.

On my own private Macbook it works fine, since I have all the Unix tools
installed.

I would very much appreciate if one of the Mac QGIS-users would have a
hint how I could deploy psycopg or the QPSQL qtsql driver.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi all,

I was wondering how hard it might be to adapt the PostGIS manager plugin
so that it will also support SpatiaLite:

http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/

It seems to me that the two use exactly the same data model and are even
based on the same engine (GEOS) for topological processing.

The cool thing about SpatiaLite support would be to have a single-file
data format that is at least as convenient as Shapefiles, but without
those constraints on file size, attribute table fields, etc.

Just a thought ...

Ben

Try copying the /Developer/Applications/Qt/plugins/sqldrivers folder  
into the Contents/plugins folder of one of the pre-built Qgis apps  
(next to the imageformats forlder that should already be there).

This should enable the Qt sql drivers.

Tim,
I agree with your points. I just want to point out possible problems:
what will we do if some plugins won't be maintained anymore by the
original authors? Keep them in trunk and fix the bugs or remove them
from trunk?

IMO we could do a snapshot of official plugins repository on every
release. They can be appended to windows installer and distributed as
a separate package on linux systems.

I think the port might be relatively simple. PostGIS manager uses
psycopg2 for postgresql access. It implements Python DB-API v2.0 so
replacing it with other db driver should need minimal effort. All SQL
queries are implemented in one file (postgis_utils.py), one just has
to modify database inspection queries because they are using catalogs
specific to postgresql (information_schema doesn't contain all needed
info).

Yes. One then just needs to implement support for it in QGIS itself...
or does OGR already support spatialite?

Marco,

Today, I noticed that there is at least one problem on OS X. When  
trying to save a composer template, the keyboard inputs are being read  
by qgis as shortcuts. I.e., typing a 'h' in a filename does not put an  
'h' character in the dialog box but hides all the layers on the map.  
This is with your most current advanced printing branch code.

John

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 1.0 'Kore'
Message-ID: <1232749558.9990.48.camel@timbuntu64>

Dear QGIS Users, Developers and FOSSGIS devotees

We are extremely pleased to announce the release of QGIS 1.0 and the
shiny new QGIS 1.0 User's Guide. We have also revamped our web site at
http://qgis.org. See the note below from our project chair:

-----------------

This release is the culmination of literally hundreds of hours of work
by a team of developers, translators, documentation writers, and
graphics designers.

QGIS began life in February of 2002, with the first release in June of
the same year. The initial goal was to create a viewer for PostGIS data
that ran on Linux. From those humble beginnings, QGIS has become a true
cross-platform application that runs on all major versions of unix,
Linux, as well as Mac and Windows. It supports editing and map
composition as well as integration with GRASS to provide powerful GIS
capability. QGIS has been translated into many languages by a dedicated
internationalization team.

At 1.0 we provide a stable API from which you can develop custom
solutions in Python or C++. Even though 1.0 is fresh, there are a number
of exciting developments underway in both the core application and
plugins. Although it took nearly 7 years to get to version 1.0, I think
you'll find that this version is the best yet. Thanks for using
QGIS---you, the users, have played a large part in its success.


-- Gary Sherman, Chair, QGIS Project Steering Committee

This is really a question for Alessandro Furieri, the dev of SL. I know
he's already busy with this, but he could possibly profit from feedback.
I think a SpatiaLite provider would be a great addition for QGIS,
solving a long-standing limitation, so if Alessandro agrees I think it
would be good to have the development happen straight into the qgis svn,
possibly in a separate branch.
All the best.

Hi John,

Thanks for the hint. On Ubuntu, everything seems ok. As long as the main map window does not have focus, the shortcuts are not applied.
Seems an OS X specific issue. I'm going to try it on OS X next week. Maybe also the other file dialogs used in QGIS are affected by this problem?

Regards,
Marco

Hi all,

It would really be great to have support for SpatiaLite in QGIS! It may not be necessary to create a new branch for the work, as providers are completely separate modules. And possible dialogs could be developed as a plugin first. So it would be sufficient if Alessandro provides a link to the provider/plugin sources for testing.
Alessandro, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask on the list.

Regards,
Marco

It might be that they are, although I had not noticed. Once you merge  
into trunk I will try again. Are you still planning that soon or  
holding off?

I see in the logs that you did the merge this morning. I'll build and  
test that a bit.

thanks for the hint - I will try on Monday when I am back at work. My 
own Mac Laptop has all the dev-tools installed anyway.

I will report back if it worked.

Thanks,

Right, there actually is a SpatiaLite provider already, based on the
PostGIS provider:

http://www.gaia-gis.it/QGisJanus/

It would, of course, be cool to have the same nice GUI front-end as used 
by the PostGIS Manager plug-in.

Cheers,

Ben

This is really a question for Alessandro Furieri, the dev of SL. I know
he's already busy with this, but he could possibly profit from feedback.
I think a SpatiaLite provider would be a great addition for QGIS,
solving a long-standing limitation, so if Alessandro agrees I think it
would be good to have the development happen straight into the qgis svn,
possibly in a separate branch.
All the best.

Hi all,

I've prepared request for comments for implementation of symbology:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/SymbologyRfc

There is five days period for proposal discussion, if there won't be
any essential problems, we'll continue with five days of voting about
the proposal.

Please take a look at it, possibly check also the python plugin
prototype to see it in action and drop me some comments.

Hi all.
I think the installer should include the grass plugin as a default: as
one of the polls revealed, the vast majority of qgis users also used it.
BTW, it seems that there is still some problem in loading grass rasters.
All the best.

could certainly be integrated into QGIS. A SpatialLight provider would 
be a fantastic addition to the QGIS repertoire. It has been suggested 
elsewhere that if QGIS worked with SpatialLight as easily as ESRI works 
with Geodatabases, then SpatialLight might be able to grow into an 
opensource Geodatabase alternative, which would be great for 
data-sharing and portability...

I have mixed results. I have 3 Macs at hand. On one Mac (Intel) it works,
on the two others (Intel/PowerPC) it doesn't.

The one Mac where it works has more dev-tools installed (the apple
dev-tools, psql, etc.) - the other two were it fails have not dev-tools.

Any other idea?

Thanks,
Andreas

I vote for giving svn access to Sandro now.
I know him, and I believe he'll be a great addition to qgis team.
Of course, he'll ahve toread and agree with our terms, etc.

No, binary/source of your plugin.  I have the Qt stuff.

Or maybe I misunderstood your plugin - did you try a C++ version?  Or  
is it only python?  Maybe that is the problem, the Qt SQL plugins,  
when bundled in Qgis, would be seen by the Qgis binary and any C++  
plugins, but maybe the bundled PyQt can't see those.  Maybe it works  
when the Qt SDK is installed because PyQt looks in the default Qt  
plugin folder (even though Qgis looks in the Qgis app bundle).

Tom - do you know if PyQt uses the same qt.conf in the Qgis bundle  
that Qgis itself uses?  Or is there a way in Python to set the plugin  
paths?

yes - I am talking about python only plugins. No C++ involved.

Yup - this is a general problem that applies to C++ code too. We have to
balance this with providing QGIS with a set of features that enables
people to get real work done in QGIS. I dont know an easy answer to this
but my feeling is that the default QGIS install should provide somewhat
more than it has now, but somewhat less than everything & the kitchen
sink. That said, your suggestion below seems worth a try.

Ok +1 for me I'm willing to give your suggestion above a try if others
are...

+1 For me. If the author is willing I would suggest to add it to the
feature plan for 1.1 at

 http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist1.1

At the same time (assuming spatiallite is backwards compatible with
sqlite), we could update the internal copy of sqlite in QGIS sources to
include spatial lite if needed.

Hi Carson,

I've took your code, modified it slightly and commited in r10026 :-)

Not sure what was the reason of your problems (I've modified it to my
preferences before trying it out). One thing worth mentioning -
casting from const to non-const isn't a good idea as the const
modifier usually has some reason, e.g. when constructing a geometry
with QgsGeometry::fromGeos() you should pass a new instance. Passing
an existing instance will probably cause havoc when deleting the
geometries (because both original geometry collection and its part
will try to delete the same geos geometry).

Looks like it's working now:

>>> g1 = QgsGeometry.fromPolygon( [ [ QgsPoint(0,0),QgsPoint(0,1),QgsPoint(1,1),QgsPoint(1,0) ] ] )
>>> g2 = QgsGeometry.fromPolygon( [ [ QgsPoint(0,0),QgsPoint(2,0),QgsPoint(2,1),QgsPoint(1,1),QgsPoint(1,0.5),QgsPoint(0,0.5) ] ] )
>>> gg = g1.intersection(g2)
>>> gg.asGeometryCollection()
[<qgis.core.QgsGeometry object at 0x8af0b2c>, <qgis.core.QgsGeometry
object at 0x8b1afac>]
>>> GG1 = gg.asGeometryCollection()[0]
>>> GG2 = gg.asGeometryCollection()[1]
>>> GG1.wkbType()
2
>>> GG1.asPolyline()
[(1,1), (1,0.5)]
>>> GG2.asPolygon()
[[(0,0), (0,0.5), (1,0.5), (1,0), (0,0)]]


Enjoy!

I'm sure if we could clone you, and put all those clones to work on 
QGIS, it would be the greatest software ever written!

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0901261723i52136984u6fab935e8aeb558b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

preparing for creation of tests for new symbology, I've started to
poke into unit testing in QGIS. Seems that the tests are slightly
broken: 4 out of 10 tests fail for me:
- regression992 - probably I don't have j2k support at all
- rasterlayertest - landsat gives blank result
- geometrytest - looks like a different number of segments is used in buffer
- rendererstest - i've fixed old qml files, but the sizes are wrong

I remember we had a buildbot running here:
http://buildbot.osgeo.org:8505/
But nothing's there. It seems that also other osgeo projects have
buildbot down. Anyone knows what's the problem?

Only thing I would change is that instead of returning an empty list if 
it is a single geometry, I would return a list containing the single 
geometry. This is essentially what the geos function does, and would 
make using this function much simpler:

Essentially every time I do an intersection, I simply call 
asGeometryCollection(), and loop through the geometries, not worrying if 
there is one single geometry, or 5 parts of a geometry collection.

Thanks again,

Carson

Sorry for slow response!
Yes, you're idea for the plugin makes a great deal of sense - this
could easily be one of the most-used qgis plugins!

my notes:

* Use the working directory by default, or allow for configuration.
You can't depend upon the existence of /tmp on windows, etc.

* Configuration options - in my opinion, the firefox plugin "session
manager" is a really good, very mature example of a autosave plugin.
There are nice docs with pics of the GUI here:
http://sessionmanager.mozdev.org/documentation.html.
It's "recovery management" is nice.

* Where is it?  I added 3rd party repositories, but i still don't see it.

take care,
christian

Hi John,

I tested on a G4 with OS 10.4 and Qt 4.4.1.
Everything seems ok with the template save dialog for me. As long as the save 
dialog has focus, the shortcuts are not applied.
I don't know what the critical difference is between your installation and my 
one. Maybe the OS X version, Intel/not Intel Mac or is it the Qt version?

Anyway, it would be good if other Mac user could test the behaviour of the 
template save dialog on their system.

cheers,
Marco

 I'm trying to keep this as simple as possible at first! I don't want
it to end up trying to be smart and saving revisions of qgis projects
for each project you are working on - it's purely an emergency
recovery tool. If you want to save revisions then you're probably
better off using SVN or git.

> * Where is it?  I added 3rd party repositories, but i still don't see it.

 It's not working well enough for use yet - I spent last night
starting to work out how to save settings in Qgis and projects. You
can look at the code on my google code repository:

http://code.google.com/p/bsrplugins/source/browse/#svn/trunk/autosave

 and if you want to suggest any improvements they would be welcome -
but the code itself doesn't do anything useful at the moment. Maybe
later this week I'll package a release and put it in my plugin repo.

Hi

I suggest we remove my original C++ graticule plugin from svn since
Carson's tools collection now replicates this.

Any objections?

Hi Martin,

Very nice RFC. No doubt the new symbology classes will be a great addition for 
QGIS.

Btw, do you export the cap style and line join options in the dialog for the 
simple line (I don't have Python installed here at work so I can't check right 
now)? If not, it should be straightforward to provide a GUI for it. In the 
current symbology dialogs, we don't have a GUI to set them even though they 
are supported by Qt.

Regards,
Marco

I think we need to decide case by case. There is already a number of plugins 
without maintainer. However, some of them are so important to users that it 
wouldn't make sense to remove from the code base. E.g. nobody would want to 
remove the GRASS plugin from svn because it has no maintainer.

Sounds like a good idea to me to add the python plugins of the official 
repository to release versions.

Message-ID: <200901271224.03745.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Hi Borys (and list)

There is now the possibility to specify a list of URLs in the options dialog 
that don't go through Proxy. It already works for WMS and WFS and would be 
cool if you could use it in the plugin installer too.

It is basically the key "proxy/proxyExcludedUrls" that contains the URLs 
separated by "|". You may have a look in the function 
QgsHttpTransaction::applyProxySettings.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

line caps and joins are also planned, but not implemented in the
prototype. You're right, it should be straightforward to include them
- I just didn't want to pollute the prototype with too many features
(since it's only a prototype).

I've found out that I haven't included anything related to units used
in the symbology. In current symbology options I see some weird
default values like 0.26 and setting pen widths is very unintuitive
(what units are those?). I think whenever in symbology-ng there will
be setting for pen width, there should be a line edit widget +
combobox where the user could specify what type of unit is he using
(points / milimeters / ...)

But I see some reasons why you shouldn't do it like this:
1. efficiency - for single-part geometries this would mean one more
copy of geometry (+ conversion from QList to python list)
2. compatibility - ordinary users of qgis v1.0 won't have
asGeometryCollection() available
3. destruction of geometries - I can't seem to find a way how to
convince SIP to transfer ownership of new geometries in the list to
python. So, while it works, there are leaked geometries after every
call :-(

Right, it would be very usefull to choose unit type.

Currently, the units are mm to ensure it looks the same on screen and when 
printing on QGraphicsScene/printer. QgsRenderContext::mScaleFactor is the 
factor that needs to be multiplied together with the outline width in pixels.

It would be nice if there was also the possibility to specify outline width in 
map units (like in the vector overlay branch, there is already the possibility 
to give diagram size in map units ).

Marco

Yes, I noticed this [3] last night after I tried adding it myself. 
Efficiency [1] is also a problem, and I noticed a significant speed 
decrease when I implemented it in practice. Compatibility [2] is also an 
issue, though perhaps less critical than the other two, as I can always 
check to see what version of QGIS someone is using...

Hmm, any other possible solutions? What about the rest of the devs: any 
ideas?

Thanks for your work on this so far Martin,

Carson

yes - I was very grateful that Marco stepped up with this feature, as I 
was one of the poor guys sitting behind the proxy who wanted to use both 
local (without proxy) and remote (with proxy) resources. I'll be around 
to test this proxy issue with the plugin installer.

FYI this default was set because units < .26 caused display issues on
some devices.

Right - there was an extremely long thread about this on trac. I believe
the issue may be resolved in gdal trunk.

I believe that this may be related to this ticket 
(http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1480) but it is going to be a couple 
of weeks before I can look more deeply into it.

Hi all.
Just now I cannot find an updated roadmap (this appears old:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/QGIS_Architecture_Roadmap).
It may be useful now, after the release of 1.0, to discuss how to
proceed further. In my view there are two major issues we should deal with:
- labelling
- bug fixing (we crossed the 300 bugs line, which is not very nice)
Opinions?
All the best.

in addition to Paolos ideas there could be improvements in the following
areas:

* printing improvements (printing big rasters, grid lines/graticules in
print composer) - its probably mainly Marco Hugentobler, who is working on
it
* improved symbolization (Martin Dobias and colleagues)
* better table handling (handling big data sets (partial table loading),
widgets in the table (not only text input, like in the attribute dialogue)
* forms - a simple form editor would be useful

Of course it is a lot to do and not all needs to be done for the next
release - should be prioritized.

Regarding tables and forms: Autodesk Topobase has an excellent
tables/forms implementations. If you are interested I can put some ideas
together somewhere on the Wiki regarding tables/forms.

Hi Paolo

There would be much more nice features (see e.g. the mail from Andreas).

> - bug fixing (we crossed the 300 bugs line, which is not very nice)

I counted approx. 110 bugs and ca. 30 defects. The rest are enhancements. 
Still the number of bugs is high.

still on my todo-list in the context with the PAL library integration that 
goes quite well. Unfortunately, I won't have much time until end of February

Marco

+1 also for me. For the changes that affect existing dialog(s) in QGIS, it 
would be good if Tim could review them before they are commited to svn.

Yes, exactly: that's why I'm worried. I think it would be better to focus
on a minimum set of features (e.g. releasing 1.1 when labelling will be
available, or when diagrams can be considered stable, and so on).

You're right. However, some of the enhancements are really important. On
the positive side, I'm sure several bugs are invalid (I clean the queue
whenever I can).

Looking forward to it!

I fail to print on anything else than A4 - If printing on A3 i get a A3
paper but the output is of size A4 centered on the A3. The page also
does not display the full output seen in the print composer but only the
A4 portion at the top left.

Currently i print everything A4 into a PDF and then print it with
acroread to A3 - Takes a lot of time for a simple print ...

At least the 1.0 does not crash on me every 2nd print ...

Good news everyone, one guy from our gang is nearly done with the
implementation, squashing last known bugs. Then I'd like to put it
into SVN trunk as a c++ plugin and when everyone's confident with new
implementation we could use it in place of the old one.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS strategy
Message-ID: <622293827.20090128150027@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

this question might have been already discussed, sorry if I missed it.

First of all, the idea to have a centralized plugin storage [1] is great
(I was a huge fan of Arcscripts). What is not so great is that I have to re-upload
our plugins (so far just 1, but potentially dozens) again and again,
as they are developing. What makes it even more painful is that we have our own website with plugin
repo too, that updates on commit, nice and easy. We're quite happy
with our own repo and not going to abandon it anytime soon.

So, one suggestion, please consider putting in [1] not only the plugins
themselves, but also parse uploaded repo.xml, so that, if authors website is up and
running, the person won't risk to deal with even slightly outdated
plugin, that I forgot to update on [1]. Also, it can be made to
periodically store a local copy of plugins (again
automatically from the websites) just in case the author's website is
down.

Authors who don't want to bother with setting up their own repo can
continue using [1] in the regular sense.

I guess this also relates somehow to the question of centralized svn repo for
plugins. We'd like to avoid duplicative tasks.

so my guess is that metadata reads locale translation of someting and
trying to write in the string which causes return error, because both
the name and the source path of raster does not contains any turkish
character.

i think this maybe python specific (i mean pyqgis), because when i
opened the metadata tab in the raster layer properties, i can see well
formatted metadata text with true turkish characters.

i hope this explanation helps to find the problem.

by the way, is there any another way to get the format (GeoTiff, ...)
of raster layer in QGIS with python?

Message-ID: <8b5938320901281356v5aceebfbm826bed24553ce911@mail.gmail.com>

in python, it comes strange to me that raster layer has metadata func,
but vector layer has not. however, both raster and vector layer have
metadata tab in their properties of window.

is it possible to provide such a system that creates the api
documentation from the python code of pyqgis and publishes the api doc
to the internet like the doxygen producing api doc from C++ code for
qgis?

trac has two plugins for this issue:

http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/PluginList

Code Documentation ?

    * DoxygenPlugin -- Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C,
Java, Objective-C, Python, IDL (Corba and Microsoft flavors) and to
some extent PHP, C#, and D.
    * PyDocPlugin -- Python (uses pydoc directly)

i do not know too much which one is appriate for this issue or how they work.
or reconfiguring the existing doxygen (c++ api) to generate second api
doc for pyqgis or maybe other tools ???

it maybe worth to setup to produce api doc from the comments of python code.
it will be good to see the more informative way of pyqgis classes and
functions for developers / users.

just suggestion.

I think this very idea has been passed around a bit on the lists and

I'm too late as usual! Sorry for duplication ;)

It is so straightforward, that feel awkward to share :)
Here is the exlanation: http://gis-lab.info/qa/qgis-repo-update.html
It is all in my language, but I hope everything should be clear
from the code inserts, it involves 1) bash script and 2) python
script, nothing else. Also, note I'm not specialist at all, so there
might be problems, that I didn't know.

But it works, right now. One commit, one plugin update.

Because the metadata contains Turkish characters (which aren't ascii), 
it throws a unicode encode error when you try to print it. But if you 
assign the metadata to a variable, then you could probably convert to 
string yourself, or let python do it for you:

meta_data = layer.metadata()

example:
 >>> test = "?"
 >>> test
'\xc3\xa8'


Hopefully that helps a bit?

I've been working on bugfix for qgsAffine. I think now it's more user friendly as 
it asks the user to start editing if the layer is not editable and the bug 
with the extents was partially fixed in QGIS 1.0 
I hope it's working ok now.
As usual I've uploaded it in the default repository so you should see it in 
the plugin installer, but I had a problem with my older plugins in the repo so 
now we have 2 qgsAffine packages in the repo. At least the user only sees one.

Hi Volkan,

I've hopefully fixed this in r10038 (and without regressions). There
were some mismatches in the qgis python support regarding unicode.
Please check whether it helped. Now the only issue with unicode/str
handling I'm aware of is corruption of entered unicode strings - those
in form u"..." or u'...'. The reason is that prior to running the
command in python, the command has to be converted from QString to
8-bit string. Here is how it works:

>>> "?"
?
>>> unicode("?",'utf8')
?
>>> unicode("?",'utf8').encode('unicode-escape')
\u0148
>>> u"\u0148"
?
>>> u"?"
??

You can see that when using classic strings, they're converted to
utf-8 and then back correctly. Also when you use unicode escaped
strings, everything's ok. Only the last case is wrong and should be
escaped. It's on my todo list but hard to say when I get to it again.

Python bindings are 95% identical to their C++ counterparts. Although
it would be fine to have also special pyqgis documentation, I don't
know how to produce it. The documentation system would have to parse
*.sip files and produce appropriate output from it. In this case,
things like pydoc are simply unusable - pydoc is good for commenting
python code, but this is c++ code wrapped into python.

I have not tried preset paper sizes. Instead, I use custom paper sizes  
to create maps of desired dimensions and then save as an image. For  
example, if I want a 24in by 36in output for large format printing, I  
will make a custom page 610mm x 914mm and save it as an image (png) at  
high resolution (300 dpi). I can then print this image with good  
results.

I never try to print directly from the composer because I like to have  
an archive of the map output anyway. I seem to recall that older  
versions would force any page size to a standard size (either A4 or  
American Letter dimensions). Perhaps this is still true.

Not sure if this helps, but you might try setting the dimensions  
manually and see how that works.

AFAIK, you have to build your binary with the debug option. You can do  
this with 'ccmake ..' from the build directory. You will see an option  
near the top for 'CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE'. Set that to Debug. You can also  
do this manually as an option with cmake or ccmake as '-D  
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug'.

That's the gcc debug binary, I think.  I don't want to run Qgis thru a  
debugger (I don't know much about it anyways).  I just want to see the  
QgsDebugMsg() messages.

You can try to run qgis from the terminal. I do this sometimes and it  
seems to give me reasonable debug output. Alternatively, there is  
Console.app. I think you probably know about these two options, but,  
in case, I execute from the Terminal with:
/Applications/qgis1.1.0.app/Contents/MacOS/qgis

Or whatever the bundle name might be.

hooray, great news! Is this going to be included in the 1.0.1-release
soon? I realy like to test it on Windows, but my processing-chain to
create win-binaries is currently broken (and somewhat outdated...).

btw, is it still possible to crosscompile QGIS for win32?

John,
which is the link to the question(s)? Sorry for the "simple" question,
but all I see are links which lead somewhere but to the poll itself.

Cheers, Nikos

Subject: [Qgis-developer] loading/saving subclasses of layers
Message-ID: <d8ad40b50901290302w1d4f091ag92dc01168e4afd28@mail.gmail.com>

I've created a subclass of QgsVectorLayer, called 'surveyLayer', in
python in order to override some of the default methods of
QgsVectorLayer. My plugin adds a menu item to read data into one of
these specialised vector layer classes.

However I can't see how to make sure that when the project is saved
and loaded that it creates a surveyLayer instead of a plain
QgsVectorLayer. Currently "Save" just saves it as a normal vector
layer but without any <symbology> section (because symbology for these
layers is a bit special and outside the realm of included Qgis
symbolisers). When loaded, qgis errors on creating the layer because
of the lack of symbology and says it can't find the shapefile.

Loading a project seems to unavoidably go via _getMapLayers(...) in
qgsproject.cpp, which creates a QgsVectorLayer. There doesn't seem to
be a way to include something in the project XML to hand off layer
creation to a specific constructor.

 I'm probably just pushing things too far here and expecting too much,
so I'll probably think of a workaround... Meanwhile, any thoughts
would be useful. The real solution might be some kind of layer type
registry, but that's way off...

Hi Barry,
such things are not supported in QGIS - there's no way for QgsProject
to know that there's some other class than Qgs[Raster|Vector]Layer.
This would require creation of registry of layer types, their
registration etc. And I'm not sure whether this is something really
desired :-)

I just poked around a bit.  There it is in qgslogger.cpp - QGISDEBUG,  
enabled by Debug build type, is what turns these messages on,  
otherwise they just get zapped out of the compiled code.  Bummer, I  
wanted some flag to turn this on at runtime, now I need a full  
recompile...

Yes, I've always had to do another compile when trying to get useful  
debug information to the devs. Think of it as an opportunity to step  
away from the computer for a few minutes. ;-)

William,

I am a mac idiot, so excuse me if this is something I am overlooking.

I am writing a python plugin that utilizes the new webkit support in
QT>=4.4.  The plugin is working on my linux and win boxes and I hopped on my
mac to try to do some testing.  With the preview2 build I was able to access
the QtWebKit from PyQt4 on my mac, but now that I have updated all the
frameworks and installed the 1.0 release from your site I get an import
error for my plugin.  Looking in the 1.0 release package it seems as though
the QtWebKit.framework has been left out.  Basically the easy way to tell if
support is there is to open the python console from within qgis and try:

>From PyQt4 import QtWebKit

Was this intentional?  If not, is it possible to get you to add support for
the standard QtWebKit in Qt 4.4+ in the next bundle?  

Thanks 

Aaron

yes - that would be cool - Webkit is a very interesting component for 
future QGIS plugin. I was also considering the use of Webkit for future 
Python based QGIS Plugins.

Hi, Martin,

How can I check?

After svn checkout, is it needed to make a full recompile of qgis?
Even for every small change, is it necessary to recompile the qgis? If
it is necessary, does ccmake understand what has changed and compiles
only changed part?

Actually I do not want to build the qgis from source code? Is there
any other way to check for especially when only the python code has
changed? Does the change of python (or sip part) affect the whole c++
code of qgis?

someone knows what could be the problem?. It only happend in windows, on
Linux not.

I work with qgis 1.0-previo2, and qt v.4.3.0.

Ah, that was intentional, because Qgis doesn't use it.  There was a  
similar issue with someone needing some Qt sql plugins (still haven't  
figured that out).

Odd that it worked in preview 2, because I didn't include it in that  
either.  And it doesn't look like Tom's all-in-one binary includes it.

I'm hesitatant to include it.  My main consideration is size -  
QtWebKit adds a whopping 25MB to Qgis (almost a quarter of its current  
size).  hmmm...

I'll let my brain ponder this...  I'm a little scattered right now  
between GRASS and Qgis issues...

Does anyone know if PyQt sees Qt plugins, or if some load function is  
needed in Python code to use them?

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly  
what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly  
disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely  
inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has  
already happened.

Message-ID: <9DB8617B-F605-4C74-9DFA-F1D470491331@kyngchaos.com>

I'm trying to figure out why Python is not loading, but all that's in  
qgisapp.cpp is a debug message saying it failed.  It's failing at

   pythonlib.load() [qgisapp.cpp line 4109]

It worked in preview 2, but for some reason it won't load in 1.0 on  
OSX Tiger (Leopard is OK).

right - size is an issue - how about a separate install?

The other question is: Webkit is present on every mac anyway - can we 
somehow re-use this webkit and let qt reference/re-use this already 
installed webkit somehow?

I don't know if this is possible ...

Since they are bundled in the OSX application, that would be tricky.   
An actual installer would be needed to put the files inside the app  
package, wherever a user chooses to install Qgis (which is possible).   
But *adding* to an application binary on OSX isn't quite the proper  
way to extend an app.

If it's something that would be used a lot, I'd say bundle it and  
don't worry about the size.

qtWebKit is linked to the webkit framework, so I assume it already  
makes use of it.  Though the large size makes me wonder.  And  
probably, QtWebkit on Windows and Linux needs webkit binaries to  
work.  Windows should have binaries available, since there is a  
Windows Safari.  The source is available to build a webkit on linux,  
but I don't know how prevalent it is.

My take is that moving forward this will be a very useful and well utilized
part of QT within QGIS... especially for plugins.  The windows binaries for
1.0 within OSGeo4W include webkit as well as the generic QT install
associated with QGIS 1.0 on Linux.  The testing I have done so far on
Windows and Linux have been that it just works out of the box.  If people
don't feel the added size is overly obtrusive to the mac build I would very
much vote for its inclusion.

William, your work on the mac bundles is awesome and I in no way want to
make your life more complicated or toss a wrench into your build process...
I would always default to your knowledge and recommendations on what should
be included.  Oh, and thanks again for all your work!

Hi there again William,

Thanks a million for dealing with the webkit stuff and getting it included.
I just dropped it onto my leopard based mac mini and while qgis loads fine,
I get a crash when trying to use anything dealing with webkit.  As a simple
test, I get a crash when doing the following from the python console within
qgis:

>>> from PyQt4 import QtWebKit
>>> x = QtWebKit.QWebView()

This same simple test works fine on my linux and win box.  It is completely
possible that it is something related to my setup (again, I am kind of
lacking knowledge of macs), but could you give that a quick test and verify
your build succeeds/fails with this test?

Thanks again, I am excited that we will be able to produce plugins using
webkit across all platforms!

Aaron

Hi all.
Another round of bugs cleanup. I think the situation is a bit difficult

devs tend to overlook it (quite understandably).
Anyway, I suggest you all to have a look: many fruits are really
low-hanging, or already on the ground.
Perhaps we should set up a more detailed roadmap, and assign bugs&wishes

I'm available for testing and help, if necessary.

also seems to crash on my machine (MacBook Pro Intel, Leopard)

Though I have to admit that I am not experienced with using webkit from 
within python/qgis. But I sure will explore webkit in the future. It 
will be very interesting because of its SVG capabilities to display 
interactive graphics within QGIS (e.g. for diagrams, charts, reports, 
etc.). Compared to qts SVG it also supports Javascript for interactive SVGs.

I am happy to try again, if another test build is available.

Thank you for your work, William!

This is fine by me, we just have to make sure that the find by 
attributes tool uses the same gui, and naming conventions as the rest of 
the fTools.

On a similar note, I was thinking of reorganising the Tools (fTools) 
menu to make it similar to the ArcGIS toolbox: a docking tree view list 
type  interface.
My idea being that as more and more analysis tools are create, it might 
be nice to have a simple architecture for organnising and keeping things 
sane. In addition to this, we could implement a base 'analysis' gui, 
which would essentially be a blank dialog with ok, cancel/quit, a 
progress bar, and some fancy QGIS analysis logo (currently in 
development) as the background. That way, new 'analysis' tools would 
simply have to add their required fields to this base dialog, keeping 
everything using the same conventions. It would be good to implement 
some simple way to automagically add the tools to the 'toolbox' as 
well... This of course would make it easier to add raster tools as well, 
which could also be part of the toolbox...

Anyway, these are just some ideas for the future...

Hi,

this one is ours, we've a student on a team, who is working on his thesis trying to
come up with convinient way to work with OSM. I noticed
there is quite a bit of activity going recently on regarding OSM and
QGIS. Though some replication is inevitable, I think this is great and
make the chance that something workable will crystallize in the end
greater.

Sometime later, we're going to post our planned functionality plan.

This plugin is slightly rewritten version of Martin's one, as we're
all separated geographically, plugin repo is great way to share even
preliminary versions.

BTW: I wish we could have <experimental>true</experimental> in repo
xml and a checkbox "Show experimental" under Fetch plugins switched off
by default, so that plugins in this category will be somehow separated
from the rest and not contaminate the list.

I'll look into why the plugin doesn't load. Sorry for the mess.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GEOS functions
Message-ID: <498473F8.5080300@gmail.com>

Hello devs,

Recently, I have noticed problems with several of the geoprocessing 
functions that use GEOS. It appears as though GEOS frequently returns 
geometry collections when performing overlay functions such as 
intersections.

What ends up happening is that if two *polygons* intersect, and this 
intersection includes a single point, or a single line (in addition to 
say overlapping portions of the polygons), then the geometry returned is 
a geometry collection with (possibly) a point, line, and polygon. If 
this is the case, when attempting to write the resultant feature to 
file, it is skipped because it does not match the geometry specified in 
QgsVectorFileWriter().

Martin and I have tried to look at some solutions, and he has 
implemented asGeometryCollection() for QgsGeometry(). However, this 
solution is currently not optimal, and appears to have some memory 
leaks. Do any other devs know if GEOS has changed the way overlay 
functions are implemented (I'm using GEOS-3.0.3), and how we can 
overcome this problem?

Cheers,

Carson

Just open the python console in QGIS and give it a try :-)

Usually you need to do just "make" and "make install" in the
directories where something has been changed. However if there were
changes e.g. in core or gui libraries then you should usually
recompile also other parts of qgis and python bindings to make sure
that nothing gets wrong.

In case you don't know what exactly you're doing, I recommend you to
build the whole source tree.

Well, you can always wait for a new release, but that may take a while...
In QGIS there are two types of "python" code - one is in python/
subdir which contains bindings to core/gui libraries, the other one is
src/python/ subdir which is a support library for QGIS (i.e. python
console, python plugins). Python support library for QGIS depends on
python bindings to some degree.

as far as I know this behavior was already with GEOS 2x. You have to 
deal with it. In case you get a geometry collection you can extract the 
part you are interested in. In case you are dealing with Polygons, 
extract the polygon part and skip/ignore the line and point part of the 
Geometry collection. Thats how I did it with some Postgis related work.

I don't know if this is intelligent, but it seemed to work in my case.

Hmm, even outside Qgis, in Python, that crashes for me, and this is  
with the untouched Qt frameworks and PyQt stuff on my system (before  
bundling).  Qt 4.4.2, SIP 4.7.8, PyQt 4.4.4.

I don't really know anything about the inner (or outer) workings of Qt  
and PyQt, so I can't really do much about it except ask over in the  
PyQt list...

Yes I think this is the only option at this point, but since most 
'analysis' plugins will be using python, and pyQGIS doesn't have direct 
access to GEOS geometries, we have to have some way to do this based on 
QgsGeometry().

Can anyone think of a more efficient/practical way of accessing the 
geometries stored in a geometry collection?

Folks,

It may be helpful to grant the TICKET_CHGPROP permission to "authenticated"
in the Trac admin interface, if it is not already.

There is "reassign to" on the bottom of the form. I can reassign tickets
- and I'm not aware that I've any special privileges in trac.

Message-ID: <d8ad40b50901310952h4cfde55ev68f3071eff1394c4@mail.gmail.com>

My autosave plugin uses QgsProject.instance().write() to save the
project to a backup location, but if there's a problem writing to the
file then an Exception is thrown by the C++ and it crashes Qgis:

QInotifyFileSystemWatcherEngine::addPaths: inotify_add_watch failed:
Permission denied
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'QgsIOException'
  what():  Unable to save to file /home/rowlings/Work/Qgis/SaveTest/wooo.qgs
Aborted

 To replicate, load a project then set the project's file and folder
to read-only or no permissions at all. Saving the project from the
File menu option brings up an error dialog, but doing
QgsProject.instance().write() crashes it out with the above dump.

 Relevant code is in this method:

http://doc.qgis.org/qgsproject_8cpp-source.html#l00920

 where it throws a QgsIOException.

 I'm trying to make my AutoSave plugin bomb-proof, since there's no
point having a system that's meant to increase your security which
actually makes it worse! Admittedly this might seem an odd case, but
the error could also happen if the disk fills up - which is just the
point where you need this kind of thing to work, perhaps by offering
you a chance to save on another drive. Crashing out is the last thing
you want to happen!

 I'm not sure how fundamental this is. Wrapping the python code in a
try: block doesn't help. Is it because there's nothing to catch the
exception so it falls through to the floor? I'm not sure what else I
can do short of reimplementing most of .write() in python.

Dear mailing list,

as some of you already read from the user-mailinglist, I want to develope
an OSM plugin in the course of my bachelor thesis.
My plan is to build a plugin, that transforms OSM-Data to shp (either
with an existing .osm file or with a given extend) and add a new layer (or
many layers) to QGIS.

I'm now trying to find a beginning. The "official" tutorial for qgis
developers is written for linux-users, to my shame I have to admit that
I'm a windows-user and not that firm to linux. I found a workshop
documentation of Marco Hugentobler from the FOSS4G and will work through
it tomorrow. If anybody of you has an other tutorial or guide for me, I
would appreciate.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Florian

Hi Paolo,

It's true that the trac is full of noise and important new features or
low hanging fruit is often not easily recognizable from others. One
possibility would be to create "easy-to-fix" report in trac that would
list bugs that shouldn't take long time. Also assigning bugs and
wishes to milestones would help, but I have no idea what heuristics to
use for decisions.

Probably a good way would be to remove milestones from tickets by
default and set milestones only for some of them (critical bugs and
planned features). That might cause less noise when looking at tickets
of a milestone. Anyway, it's not easy to find the right approach...

Carson,
I was thinking about the same thing. Creating a simple framework for
the tools seems like a logical step. The framework would maintain the
list of tools and automatically create GUI for the tools. Take a look
at GRASS toolbox in QGIS, it works exactly in this way - it just runs
external grass commands.

Yes, reworking the geometry class in QGIS :-)

William,

I've added error output (to qgis logger) from QLibrary with the
reason. In case you're dealing with 1.0.0 sources, you can apply the
simple change by hand to find out:

I've found out that by default SIP doesn't try to catch C++
exceptions. One has to pass -e option to SIP executable when
generating code (for qgis it's in file python/configure.py.in). From a
simple test it's able to catch the exception. I've tried also to wrap
QgsIOException using %Exception annotation (see SIP reference) but
couldn't force SIP in few quick attempts to identify the exception.
But at least it detects an unknown exception and doesn't abort.

I have a simple test case:
from qgis.core import *
p = QgsProject.instance()
p.setFileName("/root/tst.qgs")
p.write()

In my opinion, rather than trying to catch the exception we should
remove usage of exceptions from QGIS code completely (like in Qt).
There are just very few occurences so it shouldn't be that hard.

HM>  
HM> Dear mailing list,

HM> as some of you already read from the user-mailinglist, I want to develope
HM> an OSM plugin in the course of my bachelor thesis.
HM> My plan is to build a plugin, that transforms OSM-Data to shp (either
HM> with an existing .osm file or with a given extend) and add a new layer (or
HM> many layers) to QGIS.

HM> I'm now trying to find a beginning. The "official" tutorial for qgis
HM> developers is written for linux-users, to my shame I have to admit that
HM> I'm a windows-user and not that firm to linux. I found a workshop
HM> documentation of Marco Hugentobler from the FOSS4G and will work through
HM> it tomorrow. If anybody of you has an other tutorial or guide for me, I
HM> would appreciate.

HM> Thanks in advance.

HM> Best regards,
HM> Florian
