Subject: [Qgis-developer] raster calculator: problems with rasterlite et al.
Message-ID: <4CCE669D.4070604@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Testing the new raster calculator, I discovered that apparently it does not work with
valid RasterLite layers (or perhaps with mutiband?):

RASTERLITE:/home/paolo/qgis-sample.sqlite,table=TrueMarble@1 * 100

is invalid, whereas

w001001@1 * 100

is valid (but the resulting raster is full of NAN, and clipped).

When w001001@1 / 10, NULL values are not handled correclty.

Furthermore, a button "Clear" would be useful.

Should I fill relevant tickets?

All the best.

The new icons for the select tool *are* relevant in that the select tools
are now different, and as a result, the icons reflect this. (At least in my
version) the drop down does work, you just need to click and hold for a
second or two for the additional options to pop up. You will see that the
original select tool icon is used to represent the original select tool
functionality, and there are several new select tools each with a specific
icon so that you know what you're doing when you're doing it.

Hi Micha

You had to press the alt-key to include all intersected features (otherwise 
only the included were selected). I reversed that in r14476 this morning, now 
it selects the intersecting features if no key is pressed.

But for the rest, I really like the new selection tools.

Regards,
Marco

Great. So that will be in the final release?

Yes, me too. Especially the "free form" selection. AFAIK there's nothing 
like that in any of the commercial GIS programs...

But there's still the big problem with Alt + Mouse. This way we're going to 
release functionality working best in selected proprietary operating systems, 
what's definitely not our way :D

What about using Control for swapping the selection and Shift instead of Alt?

Actually it will probably be a little freeze given our short schedule...

Is everyone ok for feature freeze and string freeze now? Bug fixes ok
till the end of the week with branch for release on Saturday?

Assuming yes, could translators do their magic on trunk?

There's a lot of dust lying on top the "topology" plugin which is
supposed to do various checks within one layer and among pairs of
layers. The plugin never reached a productive state and stayed at some
alpha/beta stage due to the lack of time. I have no time nor
motivation to do some work on it in order to make it ready for
inclusion to the trunk. However, if there is anyone interested to
finalize it, I will try to dig up the code and make it available.

Regards
Martin

Hi Borys,
 
See the comment under ticket https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2938.
 
But in short the current keys are in use by the new selection tools:
 
alt key: When used switches from selection by intersects to selection by contains
control key: used for add features to the current selected set
shift key:  used for to subtract features from the current selected set
 
As you can see we have used up all of the practically available modifier keys.
 
Within the ticket I have added a new patch that allows the user to set the default selection method. For KDE or Gnome this at least allows users to set the main way they want to select features. Not perfect but at least functional. Maybe someone else has another idea? 
 
Regards,
Jeremy

But there's still the big problem with Alt + Mouse. This way we're going to
release functionality working best in selected proprietary operating systems,
what's definitely not our way :D

What about using Control for swapping the selection and Shift instead of Alt?

Milena always has another idea ;) and proposes choosing between two modes:
Mode 1 (Win):
- alt for switching intersects/contains
- ctrl for adding features
- shift for substracting features

Mode 2 (Gnome/KDE):
- shift for switching intersects/contains
- ctrl for swapping the selection

I dislike having a different default, but do like the user being able to
configure their preference. Differing defaults makes writing tutorials,
teaching others and switching machines quite confusing.

In quick consultation with some other users. Either Ctrl or Shift as the
main Add/Subtract toggle is good (In my mind Ctrl if more obvious a
choice based on other programs, though some like shift because it's
bigger[usually])

Would Alt switch from the default of Intersect to Contains only for the
duration of the holding of Alt or does it stick until pressed again?
Either way seems ok, just wanted to clarify.

Also, if it's possible to show the keyboard shortcut in the Tooltip that
might also help users figure it out.

Thanks,
Alex

I completely understand Martin! I'm going to try to fix things up
using J?rgen's changes to QgsGeometry and the validateGeometry
function, so at this stage I don't think I'm interested in your other
stuff. However, it might be nice to dig into it in the future; I seem
to recall some pretty nice features in there. Anyone else with some
time on their hands?

Cool idea. Two questions:
 
- Is there a consistency problem for users switching between platforms? Maybe it's best to determine the 2 most used selection modifier functions, and then make the keys the same on both platforms..
- What does swapping the selection exactly mean?

I mean the prevoius behaviour: adding if not selected and substracting if 
already selected.

Hi,

The Yukon Department of Environment is looking for someone to develop a "Streamlined Quantum GPS application or plugin" (http://forum.qgis.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=7417).

The requirements sound a lot like what Martin D. did with his gismapper (was that the name?) project he presented in Vienna last year (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MTegvK05i4).

I think this could be an opportunity to improve QGIS GPS receiver handling.

Best wishes,

Anita

At the moment you need to hold the alt key. To do it the other way would take more work and might be trouble just waiting to happen.
 
Ok how about this as a proposal for the select tools:
 
Shift: switch to contains select (default is intersects, this will not be user configurable)
Ctrl: Symmetric difference of the current and new selected features. i.e. if already selected then remove, if not already selected then add. 
 
Also add the tool tips - very good suggestion thank you.
 
Under this proposal we don't need to use the alt key and all platforms are the same. The only downside is that some users might get a surprise with the usage of the symmetric difference functionality - I guess it just depends on what other software they have been using.
 
Can we please get a vote on this!?
 
Cheers,
Jeremy

+1 from me of course ;)

This is exactly how it worked before, so old qgis users won't be surprised. 
And using Shift for the contains select we just change as less as possible.

sounds good for me. Being also a Linux user I welcome the decision not to
use the Alt-key. Also, it is good if all platforms behave more or less the
same.

Hi all,

I updated my osgeo4w/qgis-trunk installation today and I noticed that
GRASS was updated. After that the qgis-grass plugin is no more available
in qgis.

Also I would like to note that the qgis-grass plugin available in the
nightly builds repository for Ubuntu linux is not compatible with the
GRASS version available in the ubuntugis repository.

cheers

The next nightly build will pick it up.

The nightly builds are made with the "standard" repositories - not ubuntugis.

so If I use GRASS out of the official Ubuntu repository it will work...
ok.

	for a Raster file
Message-ID: <AANLkTikEu4VU0EGdOrw4em6XfaVH-40xUHf_eAwd6Qoy@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Can any body help me to get and set projection parameters for raster files?

I am doing some map calculation using PIL and the data is losing projection,
so want to re project the raster files.

The language I am using is Python on windows platform..

Thanks in advance

 Assuming this is a qgis question...

 If you get the layer in 'l' then l.crs() gets you a coordinate
reference system object:

>>> l.crs()
<qgis.core.QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem object at 0xb3b44ac>

and hence:

>>> l.crs().toProj4()
PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs')

 and to set it, just use setCrs with a QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem object.

Message-ID: <4CCFF458.7090202@gmail.com>

Hi All (and especially translators)

As of today please note that we are entering string freeze for the run
up to the next release.

This is some kind of "inbetween" release due to some facts that are
described here:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2010-October/011194.html

If you are committing bug fixes please avoid changing any strings.
Translation .ts files have been updated in SVN so please update your
local svn checkouts. The period for translations will close 6th Nov.
2010 and then we will be branching for release. Any translations
submitted to us after that time will only be included in the next
release, so please submit what you have by then even if it is not complete.
As always you can track the release plans via the checklist at:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Release_Checklist_1.6

If you have any questions about the translation process, please see the
following page which includes instructions on how to generate a .ts file
for a new locale. http://www.qgis.org/wiki/GUI_Translation Many

thanks to all the translators out there for the great work you do! Regards,

P.S.: The list of Translation Progress is here

Hi,

I think it would be nice to publish this sources. Maybe anyone
else can look at this and improve or adopt for fTools. I'm not
sure about my own time, but I'm interested in this.

Hi Paolo,

I'm currently working on this problem. It appears to be a GEOS error,
but I can't quite pin down what's going on?
I think there is already a bug report for the Union issue, so no need
to file a report there.

Ok I have attached a patch to implement here:

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/attachment/ticket/2938/select_tools_update.diff

Sorry for the delay, I have not been near an internet connection for the past 24 hours - shock horror!

I hope it's not too late to get this committed. If the new tool tip strings are a problem, a dev should at least try to commit the changed functionality so we don't have to change things for 1.7.

Cheers,
Jeremy

This is exactly how it worked before, so old qgis users won't be surprised.
And using Shift for the contains select we just change as less as possible.

Let's go vote! Time is short.

Thanks Jeremy, the patch looks fine.

As it includes translatable strings, it might be better to hold off until code 
freeze / string freeze is over.
Tim: what do you think?

I'd prefer to apply the patch except qgisapp.cpp file - this way we avoid 
introducing the temporary behaviour to qgis 1.6 and strings will wait for 
unfreeze.

HI ALEXANDER;

thanks for your suggestion for link , i followed the link
"http://www.florianhillen.de/qgis-tutorial-en.html"
i done the steps as it is , when i gave configure in cmake 
it shows 

"CMake Error at cmake/FindSIP.cmake:54 (MESSAGE):
  Could not find SIP
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:399 (FIND_PACKAGE)


Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!"

configuration stops showing project files not found ,
i tried to give
find_sip_py = "C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python25\sip.exe"
                                                           or\sipconfig.pyd

i tried both these combinations but werror doesnot get solved so can u plz
suggest any idea to solve it 
for your convenience i ll attach the cmakecache file in the build directory
http://osgeo-org.1803224.n2.nabble.com/file/n5700765/CMakeCache.txt

Hi all.
With current trunk, I'm experiencing alla sort of problems with legends:
- switching layers on and off does not always work
- switching off one layer often switches off another one
- moving layers up and down results in layers being not moved and/or deactivated, etc.
Can anyone confirm?
All the best.

If so, I think this is a blocker for releasing 1.6.

Message-ID: <4CD17D18.4070001@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Currently proxies can be excluded on a case by case basis, and groups of addresses
can be reached directly. The criterion for exclusion seems however based on the first
characters (myurl*). It would seem very useful to have the possibility of defining
addresses based on the last characters (*myurl.it).
Looks an easy improvement: should I open a ticket?
All the best.

I also had problems in the past - but I just compiled the current trunk
and did not see any major problems (ubuntu 10.04, 64bit, qt4.6).

Can you be more specific on what the problems are? Do you have the render
cache active or not? The render cache caused a lot of problems in the
past, so I generally disable it.

I also think that those issue should be properly tested and resolved,
before releasing QGIS 1.6.

It turned out that I have published the code already, just forgotten
about that :-)
You can find the plugin here:
https://github.com/wonder-sk/topol

It doesn't have any special requirements, just copy it to your
src/plugins directory and add the subdir in
src/plucgins/CMakeLists.txt

Rafael,

This question should be in a new thread as it is a new topic.  I don't know
if it can be moved?

Anyway, I have used QtCreator to write c++ plugins.  I have done it on mac
and ubuntu...i think it will work on windows too.  Unfortunately I don't
have it set up on my current computer so I am going from memory.  I think
the way i did it was:

1) Set up a development environment and make sure you can compile qgis from
source with cmake.
2) Then you can open the CMakeLists.txt file for qgis with QtCreator and use
it to compile qgis using cmake through QtCreator.
3) It will create a creator-build directory to build into.  Build it and
make sure it works and that you can debug.  To debug you will need to set
the Project Settings in QtCreator to make, make install, and point to the
application.
4) There is a plugin_builder.pl script (in trunk/external_plugins) that you
can use to build a minimal plugin to use as a starting point.  I think that
it adds an entry in the correct CMakeLists.txt file so that the new plugin
will be built.  Test this.
5) If you set it up this way you should be able to code your plugin and
debug it in QtCreator.

Sorry for the vague details...like i said I am doing this from memory.

Matt

Hi Martin

I tried to install your plugin as you described in your mail. But I get
some error messages. The first message is:

/usr/local/src/sogis/qgis_src/trunk/src/plugins/topol/../../core/qgsgeom
etry.h:103: Error: ??GEOSGeometry?? not declared

Any hints.

Just to give my reassurance, we will hold the final release until
everybody is 100% happy with it. Ok well I'm exaggerating a little, but
we will try at least to not press the release button until I get a bunch
of +1's to an email stating I want to branch...

I tried with and without the cache, but the results are similar: layers do not appear
when moved up and down, etc.

Hi,
I have created new branch 'raster-providers' for true raster providers
support development which is my main task for the upcoming hackfest.
It is not yet ready for testing. I have only submitted some initial
work for passing data for rendering from providers to raster layer.

I will appreciate, if you avoid changes in raster area in this period
to make later merging easy. It involves especially

I appreciate your interest, but as I said, it is not usable at the moment,
with a lot of luck you can display GRASS integer map, but you have to
set min/max manually
to get reasonable colors.

No problem Radim. I think having a rasterprovider layer is of big
interest to be able to bind other kind of raster sources (i.e. VTK).
What about GDAL? It's 'hard-coded' inside the rasterlayer, but I
suppose it will become a raster provider implementation. Isn'it?

Hi Bishwarup,

some time ago I needed something like that. I got it with gdal and osr.

Here is the Python snippet:
---------------------------------------------------------------
# *Python terminal*: First, get the transform parameters, you'll use them
after in the code
dataset = gdal.Open("/ruta/archivo_original.tif", gdal.GA_ReadOnly)
parameters = ds.GetGeoTransform()
---------------------------------------------------------------
# *On a separate Python file*
import numpy
from osgeo import gdal
from osgeo import osr

# Cargue del archivo que contiene la matriz
array = numpy.loadtxt("/ruta/archivo_cp1",delimiter=';')

# Formato de salida
out_driver = gdal.GetDriverByName("GTiff")

# Creaci?n del DataSet de salida
outds = out_driver.Create("/ruta/archivo_salida.tif", 1272, 787, 1,
    gdal.GDT_Float32, options=["COMPRESS=PACKBITS","TFW=YES"] )

# *Here you should put the parameters you got before*
outds.SetGeoTransform([552910.96327099996,28.5,0.0,422591.15634099999,0.0,-28.5])

# Definir el sistema de referencia de la imagen de salida
srs = osr.SpatialReference()
srs.ImportFromEPSG( 32618 )
outds.SetProjection( srs.ExportToWkt() )

# Escribir la matriz 'array' en la primera banda de la imagen de salida
outband = outds.GetRasterBand( 1 )
outband.WriteArray( array )
---------------------------------------------------------------

Hope it helps you.


Regards,

Germ?n

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problems deleting vectors with GRASS/osgeo4w
Message-ID: <1289090026.1902.124.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

I'm experiencing problems while deleting vectors from mapsets under
GRASS installed with the osgeo4w installer under windows Seven.

As I usually use GRASS under QGIS and I initially guessed it could be
something with the plugin, but then I confirmed the problem under GRASS
using the standard wxpython GUI.

The problem does not seems to affect GRASS I have installed in Ubuntu
linux (using the ubuntugis repository).

Actually if I want to delete a vector map from a mapset I have to do the
operation twice


(Sat Nov 06 21:04:18
2010)

vect=provinces@mapset3003                                              
Removing vector <provinces@mapset3003>
Unable to delete file 'C:\Users\gio
\Desktop/location3003/mapset3003/vector/provinces/hist'
couldn't be removed
<provinces> nothing removed
(Sat Nov 06 21:04:19 2010) Command finished (1
sec)                             
(Sat Nov 06 21:04:27
2010)                                                      
g.remove
vect=provinces@mapset3003                                              
Removing vector <provinces@mapset3003>
(Sat Nov 06 21:04:28 2010) Command finished (1 sec)


the first try seems to have the only effect to remove the dbf file (the
vectors are imported shapefiles), while the second try deletes the
remaining folder into the "vector" folder.


Under QGIS: when hitting the "delete selected map" in the grass tools
browser windows the following message shows

"cannot delete map provinces
command: provinces g.remove.exe vect=provinces"

then the 0_polygon, 1_polygon, etc. do disappear but the name of the
vector remains. Hitting "refresh" it produces

"cannot open vector ... in mapset ... on level 2 (topology not
available, try to rebuild using the v.build module)"

Hitting again "delete selected map" just produce the error message

"cannot delete map provinces
command: provinces g.remove.exe vect=provinces"



If I try to remove manually the vector trough the GRASS console (under
QGIS) I get:


C:\>g.remove vect=pontos

GRASS_INFO_MESSAGE(1800,1): Removing vector <pontos>
GRASS_INFO_END(1800,1)

GRASS_INFO_WARNING(1800,2): Unable to delete file

GRASS_INFO_END(1800,2)

GRASS_INFO_WARNING(1800,3): couldn't be removed
GRASS_INFO_END(1800,3)

GRASS_INFO_WARNING(1800,4): <pontos> nothing removed
GRASS_INFO_END(1800,4)

C:\>



while manually directly under GRASS I get

GRASS 6.4.0 (location3003)> g.remove vect=pontos
Removing vector <pontos>
WARNING: Unable to delete file
         'C:\Users\gio
\Desktop/location3003/mapset3003/vector/pontos/hist'
WARNING: couldn't be removed
WARNING: <pontos> nothing removed

GRASS 6.4.0 (location3003)>



If someone can confirm is a GRASS problem in the osgeo4w installer I
will be able to open a ticket.

cheers

Hi folks...

We need to press ahead with the release as soon as possible.

It would not be good to start the hackfest while the freeze is still in
effect.

Can you please +1 this message if you are happy to release or otherwise
provide a substantial reason why we shouldn't.

I will include a note with the release announcement explaining that this is
a rush release and suggesting that conservative users stay on 1.5 if they
already have it installed.

I am travelling at the moment but, internet willing, will branch for release
tonight barring major objections.

That's a pitty we use even numbers for relatively unstable releases (1.4 and 
now 1.6) and then try to polish them as odd numbers. For the 2.x series, maybe 
we shoud try to focus on stability, performance and polishing in the even 
versions :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] symbol levels ignored with rule based rendering
Message-ID: <1289140950.11816.7.camel@mk-desktop-smh>

Dear list members,

A few tickets related to rule based rendering were closed recently, but
one still needs some thinking: 'symbol levels ignored for rule based
rendering'
I opened it here 6 weeks ago:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3039
mhugent said it was addressed in patch #2832
Patch  #2832 was partially applied by wonder, see:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2832

Wonder wrote rightfully: "I've kept back the part regarding the symbol
levels. The renderer should be able to apply multiple symbols if there
are more valid rules. We need to give it some more thoughts on how to
deal with the symbol levels."

I've posted the following as an answer to wonder's message, but maybe
it's easier to discuss it here (or should I reopen ticket 3039?):


"Thank you wonder for putting it in the trunk! Here are some thoughts
about how to deal with the symbol levels. IMHO, here are many examples
where symbol levels are needed (and with the only workaround of having
tens of layers). I cannot think of many examples where using several
symbols (hence many matched rules) is absolutely required; even less
examples where multiple matched rules AND symbol levels together are
required ; for those examples (for instance: rule A and B), if we use
the full patch rule_based_renderer.diff, there is the easy workaround of
creating one rule C with (C <=> (A and B)) and putting it before A and
B. Anyway, thinking of how to deal with combining symbol levels and
multiple-matched rules will be easier if we can test rule based
rendering with symbol levels. I am precisely working on this. I have
just made my own build (based on 14481) by completely the patch in
r14404 (including symbol levels). The first obvious needed feature would
be to reorder the rules (change the priority order). Then, next to the
"use symbol levels" check box, a warning should say that if symbol
levels are activated, only the first matched rule will be applied. Then
qgsrulebasedrendererv2.cpp should be modified to return "mCurrentSymbol"
if symbol levels are not activated, and only the first matching rule if
they are. Finally, symbol levels are saved in memory when closing the
dialog box, but they are not saved to the file yet and this would need
to be fixed. I'm working on rendering openstreetmap data in a customized
way with filters based directly on the full-length OSM tags (but I
cannot save my changes because of the above).

Should we have the changes suggested here, users will be able to choose
between multiple matched rules and symbol levels. We will then have use
cases to think about where to go next. What do you think?"

Thanks for your thoughts!
Best regards,
Mayeul

	and QGIS Plugin
Message-ID: <4CD6BB5E.9060706@kappasys.ch>

I just finished the first beta version of my newly released pgvs support
system. The idea of this system is to enable the editing of a single
PostGIS layer concurrently by more than one user at the same time,
similar to source code versioning systems like CVS or Subversion. You
will find further informations at:

http://www.kappasys.org/cms/index.php?id=23&L=5

You can download the PostGIS functions from:

http://www.kappasys.ch/pgtools/pgversion/createFunctions.sql


To get easy access to pgvs I additionally created the QGIS plugin
pgversion which you can download from:

http://www.kappasys.org/qgis/plugins.xml

I know that not all features of a SVN like system are implemented yet.
But I would like to get your comments and ideas for further developements.

I hope that pgvs can make your life easier.

Regards
Horst

I'm updating the GUI translation, hope to finish it by this evening. Anyway I do not
think we should stop for this, so +1, if not for a regression I think we should fix
before the release, if it's a general phenomenon:
switching layers off does not work the first time. If I switch of, then on, the off
again, it's ok.
All the best.

Thanks a lot Horst!
I think we should merge (all/most) database tools in a common framework, otherwise
life will become very difficult for our users (e.g. there is a different versioning
system in the PostGIS manager plugin).
Food for discussion at the hackfest, I guess.
All the best.

There exists some confusion about the term versioning. Some people
mean historisation = versioning. In the case of my PostGIS extension
versioning is in the sense of concurrent sources editing like CVS,
SVN, or GIT. The PostGIS extension manages concurrent editing
versions, merges conflicts and so on. This is very helpful for many
different purposes and tested in Solothurn.

But I'm looking forward to discuss all the PostGIS stuff. Like the
table join in Vienna ;-)

All the best

Congratulations, this is much needed stuff. I wonder why such tools
are not discussed at PostGIS list.

I really admire Your work with one exception, which pushed me to
develop my own tools (based on Your ideas) [1].
What I do not like is, that after enabling version support, all
editing is done against newly created view '<tablename>_version' (and
set of belonging RULES). This works well in all software which doesn't
care if You are loading pure TABLE or VIEW. In my work, we are trying
to support as many GIS client as possible.
For example Manifold GIS is setting read only mode by default, when
loading VIEW (What about ESRI ? or CadCorp SIS ?). In this case, such
tools are unusable. You never knows, when somebody implements similar
behavior in new version of Your software.

One more question, how is the view  '<tablename>_version' performing
in case of huge tables ?


For somebody interested in my work, look here [1] (published source
code is quite outdated)

Paolo, stuff in PostGIS manager plugin should be the versioning system
developed by Horst.

As I understand your approach correct your aim is to historize table
records. But that's not the aim of the pgversion approach. pgversion
supports concurrent editing like SVN. To keep all non committed records
it is neccessary to log them in a seperate table via materialized views.

What is a huge table. We use pgversion with tables containing more than
100'000 records and it works fine.

Of course it is possible to combine pgversion with the different
historisation approaches.

Congratulations, this is much needed stuff. I wonder why such tools
are not discussed at PostGIS list.

I really admire Your work with one exception, which pushed me to
develop my own tools (based on Your ideas) [1].
What I do not like is, that after enabling version support, all
editing is done against newly created view '<tablename>_version' (and
set of belonging RULES). This works well in all software which doesn't
care if You are loading pure TABLE or VIEW. In my work, we are trying
to support as many GIS client as possible.
For example Manifold GIS is setting read only mode by default, when
loading VIEW (What about ESRI ? or CadCorp SIS ?). In this case, such
tools are unusable. You never knows, when somebody implements similar
behavior in new version of Your software.

One more question, how is the view  '<tablename>_version' performing
in case of huge tables ?


For somebody interested in my work, look here [1] (published source
code is quite outdated)

Hi Luca

That should be the same as in 1.5:
Activate the vector layer and go to menu 'Layer->Labeling'

Hi Horst,

may be this could be interessting as a workshop at FOSSGIS 2011? We were
discussing about having some more specialised workshops on the
conference. Not just the "introduction in ..."-things

Marco

i guess QGIS has even more potential on providing "advanced"-WS at
FOSSGIS 2011 in Heidelberg

aaah... I thought that was the old ABC Label plugin :-)

why do you not remove the old labelling on Layer Properties?

Good Day All,

By the way, Let me first say thank you to all
the folks who have worked hard to make QGIS
a fantastic product. The level of excellence in the
open source world never fails to amaze me.

I have a question about the Photo2Shape Plugin.

When I submit a Geo-referenced JPG from my iPhone
the Photo2Shape will recognize all the geo-referenced
items from the photo when the ShapeFile is created, but the
photo image will not appear on the Qgis Canvas.

I tried it twice with both the add results to canvas checked and not
checked.

The only image I get on the canvas is a camera icon, not the photo I
converted.

The photo path is referenced correctly in the attributes as follows:

filepath: C:\Photos_geo\photo.jpg
filename: photo.jpg

Anyone see anything I am doing wrong?

Thanks,

Lenny

Hi

qgis.utils.iface.legendInterface().addGroup("lfp3")

The added group is in "rename" mode (you can start editing the name of group). I'm using revision

Hi,

I don't know if the branching already happened and I am in no position to
influence you developers about when to branch - but I would like to know
if the issues around nested grouping and more powerful re-arranging of
groups and layers are properly tested and bugs resolved?

If not - I would like to suggest that it would receive more attention by
testers and developers before going forward with the release.

I recently heard that often layers aren't properly turned off and on
properly, sometimes the wrong layers and that sometimes dragging around
layers or groups acts weird.

I think that it is one of the major features in QGIS 1.6 (thank you
J?rgen) and that it should be properly tested before the release.

If the issues still exist I would not go forward with the release, as this
is an area that would immediately be visible, cause troubles and hurt
QGIS' reputation if it doesn't work as expected.

A concerted effort of users and developers should be made to resolve those
issues if they still exist.

Cannot you just create a 1.5 _branch_, not yet the 1.5.0 tag (in SVN terms)?
With the rule that all fixes must be merged to trunk.

I just tested with the most recent nightly windows build (build 14528, qt
4.5.2) and the issue that one clicks on a checkbox of a layer and nothing
happens still exists.

One has to turn the layer off and on and off to turn it off. This is not
the case for all layers, but for some.

I heard that other people experienced similar issues (Paolo, Stefan, others).

I recommend not to go on with the 1.6 release until this issue is properly
resolved.

I think you need to compile against /usr/lib/libqwt-qt4.so instead of
/use/lib/libqwt.so.
You can fix the problem removing the package that provide libqwt.so, install
the one that provide libqwt-qt4.so, doing cmake again and verifying what
cmake said in "Found QWT:" line.

Hey, there are just four new functions.  The online help just lists what the
parser currently supports.  But the parser is used both for search strings and
in the field calculator - apparently the comparisons are only available in
search string.  Hence the "preliminary" - the documentation should probably
split in half one for the query builder and one for the field calculator.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Improving QGIS Measure tool
Message-ID: <AANLkTinz=8dwVgX6J51bUWaAgzMMR7r-VA2HSg-rbWgz@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

We want to improve the QGIS measure tool to make possible distance
measurements in unprojected sessions when latlong data is loaded.
This is helpful when you don't want to project your data for some
reason, but still would like to measure distance in meters. For this
we were willing to use QgsDistanceArea::computeDistanceBearing()
which already has Vincenty formulae.

But, at this time QgsDistanceArea::computeDistanceBearing() requires
projection and ellipsoid to be already set before calling it.

We want to modify QgsDistanceArea::computeDistanceBearing() to add
ability to do measurements without reprojection or coordinate transform,
but passing Ellipsoid as one of the parameters. But we unsure is this
safe because Measure tool doesn't create it's own instance of
QgsDistanceArea but get it from map renderer.

Any thoughts on this?

Thanks

Hi, I would like to ask the possiblity of saving the google layers we
get from OpenLayers plugin as raster layers.

The OpenLayers plugin is of a great help to me.
And the ability to save those layers for moments without internet

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=mESAXZFDrh_-YzcMcmAxheP-SvY7aAJm6Ncuc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List

I have not found any function in QgsMapLayer for getting a layer by its
name. I needed it on a python plugin to let the user choose a layer from a
combo box (already populated with the layer names)
So I created this function http://osgeo.pastebin.com/7EpNA3JL

I have some questions regarding it:
* Is it the right way ?
* I have seen it is possible in Qgis to rename a layer, and 2 layers of the
same type can have the same name. This makes my function not working in all
the cases (which is my problem of course). Is there a reason to allow layers
to share a name ?

Thanks for all the work done in Qgis

Cheers

Kimaidou

I suspect that is how most plugin developers have implemented this
functionality, and for the most part it works (save for the situations
you listed below).

One solution would be use userData to store the layers uniqueID, and
then use that to access layers later on.
First you add each layer name to the combobox, like so:
combobox.addItem ( layer.name(),QVariant(layer.getLayerID()))

and then when the user select a layer from the combobox, get the
maplayer by doing something like (untested):
uniqueId = combobox.itemData(combobox.currentIndex()).toString()
layer = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayer(uniqueId)

Of course, if you are simply listing all layers in the layer list,
then you could just use their order in the combobox, as this will be
the same as the order in the layer list.
layer = mapCanvas.layer(combobox.currentIndex())

Hope that helps,

Carson

Hi again

Still working on my python plugin...

I need to simply select all the features of a chosen vector layer. In
QgsVectorLayer api, there is no method "selectAllFeatures()"

So I use this piece of code to achieve it
http://osgeo.pastebin.com/Ma9DxgKR

* Is there a better way to do so ?
* Do you think a method selectAllFeatures() would be usefull ? If so I will
add it to the trac.

Thx again,

UniqueId is the best candidate !

 That's an interesting approach! My selectplus plugin has a 'select
all' function which does this:

    def doit(self):
        layer = self.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
        layer.setSelectedFeatures(layerIds(layer))
        return None

where layerIds is:

def layerIds(layer):
    ids = []
    p = layer.dataProvider()
    allAttrs = p.attributeIndexes()
    p.select(allAttrs)
    f = QgsFeature()
    while p.nextFeature(f):
        ids.append(f.id())
    return ids

Your rectangle overlay should be pretty quick, but maybe my collecting
all the feature IDs is quicker?

I don't know :) I tried to have a compact code, so I reused the api method
that seemed simplier, in a spatial approach.

...and with the newer PyQGIS API, we can do things even more Pythonically:

def layerIds(layer):
 ?  layer.select([]) # we don't actually need the attributes
    ids = [feat.id() for feat in layer]
 ? ?return ids

Obviously you could skip the step of creating the layerIds function,
and then you'd reduce the entire thing down to:

layer = self.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer() # or however else you
get the layer
layer.select([]) # we don't actually need the attributes
layer.setSelectedFeatures([feat.id() for feat in layer]) # select all
the feature ids

My guess is that this would be quite a bit faster than boundingbox
method, especially because select(QgsRectangle, bool) actually
contains this:

QgsFeature f;
while ( nextFeature( f ) )
{
  select( f.id(), false );
}

whereas setSelectedFeatures is more direct.

Yes , it is more concise and the list comprehension is much more pythonistic
;)
I was on other php projects, and lost my python :)

Hi.

Is there a possibility to add ArcGIS REST services (ArcGIS Map service) to
QGIS.
There is a plugin  - QGISRest (with lack of some documentation), but it
looks that it works only to list info about this service but not to add any
data ?
Any suggestions ?? Thanks.

Hi.
As you know rest services are generics, and the semantics of arcgis
server rest services responses must be known to parse them. The rest
plugin, as far as I see, are generics too. You can easily query an
arcgis service (i.e. rest/services/your_service/MapServer?f=pjson) and
you simply receive the json response, but then you aren't able to use
it to load the listed features in qgis.
The arcgis rest services also permit to request an image response. The
same as above, it doesn't follow any standard format, so the answer
(afaik) is no, you can't load arcgis rest services response (neither
vectors nor images) on Qgis.
Maybe others have experimented with it...

I've given a look to the qgisrest plugin. When a text/plain response
is given it tries to parse it as GeoJSON. Arcgis doesn't follow this
standard, that's why you won't be able to use the returned object.
Anyway, you could easily add support for it, implementing your own
Format for qgisrest [1]

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python plugin - Path to gdal
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=78TaKK6PkqJE5hdLBOZ9oinWwcAKDJ3AZjREM@mail.gmail.com>

Hi qgis dev,

I am still working on my python plugin. Now, thanks to Carson and Barry, my
UI is running smoothly.
Now I am working on the core code.

I would like to use Gdal to perform a gdal_translate on some selected raster
layer.
I have no idea how I can find the path of the gdal binary used by Qgis. Of
course I need an OS independant method.

I tried to read the GdalTool plugin code, but woow, it is a bit too
complicated for me rigth now. E.g, I have seen there is a function :

# Retrieves GDAL binaries location
def getGdalPath():
  settings = QSettings()
  return settings.value( "/GdalTools/gdalPath", QVariant( "" ) ).toString()

But I am not sure it will work if run from another plugin (especially if
GdalTool is not installed/active ).

Thanks in advance for helping me,

Kimaidou

 That's about right. GdalTools has a preferences dialog (in the
Raster... GdalTools Settings option) that lets you specify a path to
the gdal executables. I'm guessing that if the GdalTools guys couldnt
find a better way, then you won't either :)

 I would suggest you try getting the same setting from QSettings, and
if that doesn't exist you'll need to get it from the user and store it
yourself in a QSettings parameter for your plugin. Actually I think if
the command is in your PATH then QProcess should find it without you
having to specify it.

I believe the gdaltools plugin path setting adds that setting to the PATH, so it can run the tools as you say without specifying the full path to any tool.

But, don't rely on the PATH from the environment if you want an OS independent method - OS X applications don't get variables from the shell environment, though they know how to use them.  Plugin developers still need to handle settings like this and add them to the QGIS environment.

I have a feature request for a QGIS-wide generic environment settings so that plugin developers don't have to reinvent various common settings like PATH.

Hi,
OpenLayers supports ArcGIS REST services. So it needs only a few lines of 
Javascript and Python to add ArcGIS REST support to the OpenLayers plugin.

Hi Luca,
I do not know how to do this in python, but I know how to do it with R.
Since R is GNU/GPL, you can probably take some code from it or use the
same algorithms. Have a look here for some examples:
http://www.r-bloggers.com/color-palettes-in-r/
This R blogger also give a link:
http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/Report/UsingColorInR.pdf
which is useful even if you do not care about R (see p. 21 sqq on color
models, including Hue-Saturation-Value model, and the references at the
end).


If you are new to R, just type a function name without parenthesis and
type enter. Example session:

> topo.colors
function (n, alpha = 1) 
{
    if ((n <- as.integer(n[1L])) > 0) {
        j <- n%/%3
        k <- n%/%3
        i <- n - j - k
        c(if (i > 0) hsv(h = seq.int(from = 43/60, to = 31/60, 
            length.out = i), alpha = alpha), if (j > 0) hsv(h =
seq.int(from = 23/60, 
            to = 11/60, length.out = j), alpha = alpha), if (k > 
            0) hsv(h = seq.int(from = 10/60, to = 6/60, length.out =
k), 
            alpha = alpha, s = seq.int(from = 1, to = 0.3, length.out =
k), 
            v = 1))
    }
    else character(0L)
}



Hope it helps
Mayeul

I've not been monitoring the list lately. Feel free to contact me offline if you want to compare notes on cmake builds, although you are probably all caught up with my level of knowledge already. FWIW, this is the cmake command I run when building with your frameworks.

cmake -D BINDINGS_GLOBAL_INSTALL=on\
-D QWT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/qwt-5.2.1-svn/include\
-D QWT_LIBRARY=/usr/local/qwt-5.2.1-svn/lib/libqwt.5.dylib\
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Applications\
-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D SIP_BINARY_PATH=/usr/local/bin/sip\

-D GRASS_PREFIX=/Applications/GRASS-6.4.app/Contents/MacOS\
-D GRASS_INCLUDE_DIR=/Applications/GRASS-6.4.app/Contents/MacOS/include ..

You may have run into the quirky issues with qwt by now. That, of course, is not a qgis issue but qwt. I still have not managed to build qwt in a manner that does not require the install_name_tool command.

I'm glad to know you will be continuing to help out with qgis. I started to panic when I first started reading your email.

Regards,
John

It's all pretty much done now in SVN, and should be in the 1.6 release.  See the INSTALL document in SVN for build details.  For Qwt, I have the install_name_tool step there.  All that's left is the final bundling step for the standalone, but that will have to wait for a gdaltools issue.

Hi Benoit,

Sounds like a bug - could you report?

As a quick fix for yourself you can open the project file in a text editor
and fix that file paths manually, until this problem is fixed.

In theory we could do that but since the point of this release is to
evade a legal threat, I'm going to push out the release with a rider
note to users that we did a rush release etc. and a suggestion that
they stick with 1.5 if they are not happy with the changes made in 1.6
and wait until 1.7 release in December.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimnWifHm3aUtHLc32nhoRtMrvV8K2KCnyJ91Eih@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

--- Note to casual readers --- Please do not pre-announce this release
- give the packagers and release team a chance to do their thing so
that people hearing about the release have a fair chance of finding a
package, reading all our press material etc. --- End note ---

On Sunday I have branched QGIS 1.6.0 for release. This release is an
urgent one due to threat of legal action over the naming used in our
last release. The branch can be checked out at:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_6_0 qgis-1_6_0

Source tarballs can be obtained from here:

http://qgis.org/~timlinux/src/qgis_1.6.0.tar.gz
http://qgis.org/~timlinux/src/qgis_1.6.0.tar.gz.md5


Please do not commit anything to the release branch except packaging
related tweaks.

If you make a package please be so kind as to update the download wiki
page at http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download with the details of your
package.

If you are able to make packages for unlisted platforms / distros
please let me know so that we can avoid duplication of effort.

I would like to make the release announcement next week, so it will be
great to have as many packages as possible ready by then.

SVN (Trunk) is open again for general commits - please seek guidance
from Marco Hugentobler (PSC Code Manager) if you are planning any
major code changes.


Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS a
reality.

Lastly can I call on the release team to put together visual
changelog, press announcements etc. ready for the release date? I will
send you an email when the packages are ready and you can start
broadcasting announcements.

Best regards

Subject: [Qgis-developer] MapServer Export PlugIn
Message-ID: <13672671.402401289492297728.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

 Hi all,

working with MapServer Export PlugIn, I discovered that the STYLE of mapfile has always OUTLINECOLOR  even if the outlinestyle is "Nothing".
I resolved with a control in ms_export.py file.
In writeClassStyleContent, i calculate 

outlinestyle = self.getSymbolProperty(symbolNode, 'outlinestyle')
-
-
-

and before writing OUTLINECOLOR, I insert 

if 'NoPen' != outlinestyle:
            class_def += "         OUTLINECOLOR " + outlinecolor + "\n"



I don't know, if it's helpful.

Hi William,

I am trying to follow your instructions and new cmake build procedure. Upon running the basic cmake command:
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Applications -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -D WITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE=FALSE \
..

I run into an error in finding qwt:
CMake Error at cmake/FindQWT.cmake:41 (MESSAGE):
  Could not find QWT
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:143 (FIND_PACKAGE)

I had to add the paths to qwt lib and include with the appropriate flags or using ccmake.

Thanks,
John

Hi Michele,

you are right, this is an easy fix for polygons without a outline style.

so it is helpfull :-)

I added your patch:

... ah, the cmake check tests /usr/local/lib, but the qwt build uses an isolated versioned subfolder.  It's not just the local copy in the pyqwt source, but the way the main qwt source is distributed, so the qwt detection needs some tweaking, though that could get messy.  Or I could change the Mac instructions to remove the versioned subfolder from the qwt install location (probably matches better how binaries in linux distros are done).

+1 to change the qwt build instructions to better conform with other systems.

It's not just the local copy in the pyqwt source, but the way the main qwt source is distributed, so the qwt detection needs some tweaking, though that could get messy.  Or I could change the Mac instructions to remove the versioned subfolder from the qwt install location (probably matches better how binaries in linux distros are done).

Hi Mayeul

let's keep the discussion in the ticket so it's easier to track the issues.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] easier translation
Message-ID: <4CDCFDBA.4030401@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
During an interesting discussion at dinner time, Giuseppe had a nice 
idea to make translations easier: why not writing a plugin for this?
Trying to elaborate on this: we would need a tool that
- check current language and version used
- prepare a document (which format?) with current translation for 
current language and version, plus the diffs between the corresponding 
english versions
- let the user translate the diffs, and send back the translation (to a 
common sandbox, waiting for approval?).
Does not look too complicated: any thoughts?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Days
Message-ID: <4CDD0045.40503@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Another idea we had (thanks Otto!).
Background0: I think now QGIS is ready to compete in the world arena, 
head to head with all other desktop GIS. OK, we ned some polishing, but 
we basically are there.
Background1: the QGIS meeting in Switzerland was quite successful.
Proposal: prepare a "QGIS Day" package, with promotion material (we 
already have some), slide shows, and a general programme, and ask local 
QGIS communities to launch their own QGIS Day, to let people know about 
QGIS.
A few decision to be made (if the proposal is ok):
- should the users pay for it? (I vote no)
- should we accept sponsors? (I vote yes)
- how could we use the eventual money? (I vote to deduct the expenses, 
and the rest, if any, should go to the project)
- any approval for PSC? (I vote yes, to make sure the message is 
correctly forwarded).
Any opinion?
All the best.

I think we will probably remove it in 2.0 release of QGIS. But in
meanwhile we should put the new labeling into vector layer properties
dialog - as this creates some confusion how to use new labeling - and
I'm the one to blame for that :)

Hi Luca

I'm not sure what classes do you mean. The attribute table classes are
in src/app/attributetable directory in the source tree, but they have
been there for several releases already (I think from 1.2).

I remember a new class for attributes that is used to avoid conflicts (or
something similiar), maybe attributes modified in a latter momemt...

Hi Alexander

You can create your own instance of QgsDistanceArea and use it with
any parameters you like. The idea of having an instance within map
renderer was to have a convenience instance of it which has the same
settings (crs, projections on/off) as the map renderer. But now it
seems to me that it wasn't that good idea and it will be probably
removed in a future version - e.g. when using threaded rendering it's
not clear what should be the result.

So I think you should create your own QgsDistanceArea instance and set
the parameters as you need.

Sorry, I was unclear: I think linguist works well for GUI translation; 
my suggestion was for manual, where finding new string to be translated 
is a major part of the job, that discourages most volunteers.
All the best.

Alexander,

I would appreciate if you save them in your style and then just send
us your ~/.qgis/symbology-ng-style.xml file. QGIS badly needs a basic
list of default color ramps - so that users don't have to create their
own everytime. The same applies to the list of default symbols.

It would be easier if instead of a single xml file multiple ones would 
be accepted, so adding conributed styles would be just a matter of 
copying them in the approoriate folder.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS database management
Message-ID: <201011121222.25345.vincent.ml@oslandia.com>

Hi,
One of the effort having to be discussed at QGIS Hackfest is the way QGIS 
handles databases, especially database connexion and layers.
Here is a little sum-up of current QGIS tools related to databases.

There is currently native support in QGIS for PostgreSQL/PostGIS and 
spatialite, and support through OGR for ODBC, ESRI Geodatabase, OGDI, 
PostgreSQL and Mysql.

As for functionnality, some are in core, and others are in plugins.

== Core functionalities ==
* Add vector layer
Enables to load a new layer from a database through OGR library. Support for 
ODBC, ESRI GeoDB, OGDI, PG, MySQL is present. The interface presents a 
connexion manager enabling to create, edit and delete connexions.

* Add PostGIS Layer
This is QGIS native PostGIS support. The interface presents :
- a connexion manager
- a list of schemas and tables
- a query builder helper
- a table searching interface
- saving and loading connexions

* Add spatialite layer
Spatialite native support. Same interface as postgis layer, without the query 
builder and connexion save/load functionality.

* New spatialite layer
Interface to create a new layer in an existing or new spatialite db. DDL 
creation helpers.

== Plugin functionalities ==
There are a few plugins related to databases in QGIS.

* PgQuery
Enables to create postgis table from a given query
- open/save query file
- run/save/clear query
- add dataset to qgis
- output query to table
- list tables

* PostGIS SQL editor
Uses a shapefile and pgsql2shp to save the query result and load it to qgis.
- load / save queries

* DB Manager
This is a feature-loaded database management with a pgadmin look & feel
- query execution
- import of data
- visualisation of DB objects
- admin tasks (vacuum, empty/delete/edit ddl)
- geometry processing (to new field of db)
- table versionning
- preview of data

* spatialite manager
This is a tool very similar to DB manager, for spatialite data

* RT SQL Layer
This is another tool for DB management, based on DB manager
- DB explorer
- query builder (open/load previous, query helpers : from, returns, where, 
column retriever)
- adds result of query as in-memory layer

* SPIT
Shapefile to PostGIS importer
- connexion manager
- import options
- editable list of shapefiles to import

* RT postgres extractor
Exports geometry based on layer (no details, not working with latest trunk at 
the moment).
=========

Please correct me if I forgot plugins or functionalities related to database 
and QGIS.
I think now it's time to refactor all those plugins into one or a few DB 
management tool, with a specific menu entry and no duplicate functionalities.

I think we can distinguish a set of main functionalities :
* DB connexion manager 
- with all DB connexions, whatever their type
* DB explorer / manager 
Used as advanced database management
It would refactor spatialite manager, DB manager and RT SQL Layer manager
* adding layer from DB connexion
This would refactor Add spatialite layer, add postgis layer
and adding layer from query which can be found in the various plugins.

I've got some draft mockups for that, and ready to discuss more deeply :)

Vincent

I would add the offline editing and the versioning tools to the bunch.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] current state of r.li
Message-ID: <4CDD3805.5010606@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Sorry for crossposting. As some of you know, the r.li suite of GRASS 
commands allows landscape analyses[0]. Its interface is rather complex, 
and is still in TclTk, not ported to either wxpython or qgis. As such, 
it is now more difficult to use than it should be, and it will become 
unusable when TclTk support will be dropped.
The possible solution (thanks Radim) is to rewrite the interface as a 
qgis python plugin. It should not be a huge work (we provisionally 
estimate 2-3 weeks).
The question is: is there anybody willing to invest either his/her time, 
or some money, to write such a plugin?
We (Faunalia) would be happy to help if necessary.
All the best.

I think all should work fine with the v.0.1.17
The previous issue depended from the PyQt4 version, the last one it's a very

strange error...
Anyway, it's fixed!

For GUI translation Werner and Volker will try to find out during the
hackfest, if it is useful to provide an online translation for the GUI
besides using linguist. 

The manual writing and updating with latex seems to be more complex,
and therefore it becomes more and more difficult to find and encourage
people to contribute and translate. I think we need to find a solution
for that, too and maybe it could be a plugin or we switch to something
new.

AFAIK projects such as Mepserver, Geoserver or OSGeo Live use Sphinx.
Don't know if that would work well, especially when we want to
translate the files.

 Otto

Sphinx has a more simple syntax than Latex, but there are same problems
with translation such as finding new strings to be translated

Hi all

Great idea to melt all these plugins into one/core.
One important feature for me : be capable of displaying the result of a
query without creating a new table or layer inside the DB nor a shapefile.
"Memory layer" is much better imho.

Thanks to all devs working on theses different plugins, by the way

I think this is the main problem: currently we spend more time searching 
for what to translate than actually translating.

Hi,

just an idea:

For years, KDE has successfully used docbook XML for documentation and a
couple of scripts to extract untranslated strings into a gettext PO catalog
and to import them back into docbook.

The source was splitted to have each individual semantic unit in a single PO
"msgid", this way a small change or fix in the source does not invalidate
all the translation.

When I was in the translation team (I left a few years ago) the process was
completely automatic, with cron jobs to keep everything in sync.

See:
http://l10n.kde.org/docs/translation-howto/doc-translation.html

This method had the primary advantage to manage both GUI and doc
translations with the same gettext toolchain, this way It was easier to keep
translations coherent (think about fuzzy translations of the GUI menu
strings).

docbook can be easily transformed into HTML (single and multi-page) , ODT,
PDF etc.

Martin,

we try to create color ramps in QGIS but there are some issues:
 - we can't choose custom colors for color ramp
 - there is no option to set up number of colors in ramp

When "random" style is used number of colors can be changed, but
there is no way to create custom colors. Is this possible?

Unfortunately now there is no support for "palette" color ramps - you
can either use the gradient ramp or random ramp. But it would be a
nice addition, since it could also enable people to import ramps for
known formats.

Hi,

I just looked at r.li.setup's .tcl files. it is some
work but as you say not a huge amount to port it to
another GUI frontend. (circa one dozen functions,
~1000 lines of code)

there is no reason to only do qgis or wxPython, we
should do both!

http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/trunk/raster/r.li/r.li.setup


the bigger issue for r.li was r.li.daemon et al
using UNIXisms which didn't work on MS Windows..
but IIRC Glynn already fixed that in grass7?

AFAIK it works also on win.

Message-ID: <4CDE8B45.6000402@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
We have several tools that do essentially the same thing. Take for 
example interpolation:
- Marco plugin
- GdalTools submenu
- GRASS commands
Each of them has a different icon, and for the user this is very 
confusing. I would suggest to unify the icons for these multiple commands.
Furthermore, I would suggest to regroup all the raster commands under 
the same "Raster" menu (I'm thinking of Raster Calculator, 
Interpolation, Terrain analysis, etc.). Analogously, database commands 
should be grouped under a Database menu.
This structure could accommodate also additional python plugin.
Any objection?
Al the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] svn_marker?
Message-ID: <A240379B-659D-4743-8712-B49FBCB59443@kyngchaos.com>

When I overhauled the Mac cmake build, there was one part I thought was odd but I left it alone.  The src/mac/contents info.plist custom target has a SVN_MARKER as the dependency.  This works in SVN source, but now in the release source it doesn't work.  There is an error that there is no rule to make SVN_MARKER-NOTFOUND.

What does it do?  I found it used in some other projects, where it seems to be some dummy dependency

A search turned up some SVN_MARKER usage in old pre-1.0 versions of the source, so I wonder if it was something where a better way to do what it does was found but this Mac target was skipped?

It could be a moot point later, since I've found that there is a better way to package the Mac application bundle built into cmake now, but the current method must be fixed for release until I can figure that out.

Hi William,

I haven't done a release build since 1.0 but my recollection is that it 
had something to do with putting a useful version string into the Mac 
bundle when building from a tarball without an svn connection.

I believe the svn versioning code has been modified since I last did a 
release build; perhaps a Mac tarball build was not tested at the time. 
If you can successfully build from a tarball (or no longer support 
them), you probably don't need to worry about this.

I could probably remove the dependency from the custom target, but for now I used a test and set it to CMakeLists.txt if SVN_MARKER-NOTFOUND.

P.S. have you compiled from source at all since 1.0?  Any comments on my cmake overhaul for the Mac build?

Hi all.

to open relevant tickets. Waiting for a proper solution, I can open them 
on our trac:

Any objection or better suggestion?
If not, I'll start writing them.

I'm not sure how easy/hard it is to migrate those tickets later, let's
see what comes out of the Hackfest in terms of the plan for a central
plugin place and see if we can find a way that will likely import into that.

My understanding from the HF is that we'll not have a bugtracker for 
plugins soon, that's the reason of my request.
Migrating a few tens of tickets shouldn't be a problem, even if in the 
worst case we would have to do it by hand.
All the best.

Actually we forgot to discuss the bugtracker! Let's do it tomorrow. One of 
possible ideas is to set a separate trac in osgeo domain. We'll probably need 
to write a plugin for it to connect #tickets to plugin versions. Another 
problem will be with separated (redundant) user accounts in trac and the repo.

Good night,

To plugin name, maybe version, and put the author's address in the cc: 
field.

I strongly suggest to keep the same access credentials for the current

Alternatively: if there are no objections, can we go ahead and apply for 
a trac instance on osgeo server?

Hi all.
As it has been discussed earlier, having location generated (and 
destroyed) on the fly would help a lot the casual qgis grass user to 
approach grass. The idea is to run an analysis by loading (r.external, 
v.external, v.in.ogr) data, generating a location from it, run, save the 
results as tif or shp, and destroy the location at the end, all without 
users noticing it (but explaining for future reuse).
The good news is that here at the hackfest we got a voulnteer willing to 
help with the coding (preferably in Python). Welcome Peter Loewe!
Anybody willing to help him with the first steps?

IF condition is already implemented:

(value > 100) returns 0 or 1.

Great, Peter!

Sure - note that all ingredients are already there including the
"demolocation" which
comes with any GRASS binary package. Maybe that's easier discussed
over chat?

Hi all.
We have been doing a number of improvements on the QGIS GRASS Toolbox, 
mainly polishing the interface and making it more compliant with general 
GUI rules of QGIS. Hope you'll like it. More work is to be done.
Robert Szczepanek kindly volunteered to prepare new icons, with a style 
uniform with the newgis icon set. You can see a sample done for db.* 
commands. It is a major task, so let's hope he'll be able to carry on 
speedy ;)
I would like to have a peer review of the new icons as they come out, to 
be sure they are easy to understand for everybody (at least as 
understandable than current ones, surely more beautiful).
So please follow the process, and send your comments. Probably the best 
thing would be if Robert can pload the new icons to 
http://grass.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS-QGIS_relevant_module_list, where we 
can collect qualified comments before adding them to the toolbox.
Looking forward for your collaboration.
All the best.

You should rerun ccmake. Several icons were removed. Sorry for the 
inconvenience.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Database Menu
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=730uwF06RCj4taLf4hZz_ePyKxJMB7T82tHoG@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
I've created the new Database menu as discussed at the HF.
This menu is available from QGis trunk r14638.

Here an example which explains how you can insert your plugin into this new
menu:

self.iface.addPluginToDatabaseMenu("&PostGIS", self.action)

and how remove it:

self.iface.removePluginDatabaseMenu("&PostGIS", self.action)

If you want that your python plugin works also with previous QGis version (<
1.7),
you should use the following codes instead.

(add to Database menu)

try:
    self.iface.addPluginToDatabaseMenu("&PostGIS", self.action)
except AttributeError:
    self.iface.addPluginToMenu("&PostGIS", self.action)

----
(remove from Database menu)

try:
    self.iface.removePluginDatabaseMenu("&PostGIS", self.action)
except AttributeError:
    self.iface.removePluginToMenu("&PostGIS", self.action)


I'm going to move the existent trunk Database plugins to the Database menu
and
my (Faunalia) DB plugins too.

Cheers.

Message-ID: <4CDFF38C.8070601@kappasys.ch>

I made a lot of changes of the PgVersion plugin and the underlaying
DB-Functions during the 4. QGIS-Hackfest in Wroclaw.

Change log:

- a lot of bugs are fixed
- introducing new functions: reverse to HEAD, drop versioning from layer
- translation to german
- adding new DB-functions
- enhancements of the help page

To use the new version 0.8.2 you have to update the DB-Functions as
described in the help.

I hope the plugin is helpful for your work.

I find lulu quite expensive but at least you can get a quote on the price 
pretty quickly.  I compared it to some local printers and the cost was the 
same for a very short run, once I included shipping.

I've been researching print on demand options for a while now and am possibly 
setting up a personal publishing account with a full service provider.  Two in 
particular: http://printondemand-worldwide.com and http://lightningsource.com 
- they are not geared toward authors as much as they are toward publishers. 

It takes some cash to get set up in Lightning source but looks like you can 
get some really good reach for pretty low price.  Of course, if you just want 
to push it out there and tell your friends about it, then lulu might be just 
fine.  It's not hard to use.

If you want to do more with it (e.g. work together to maybe make some $) then 
drop me a note and we can discuss more ideas.

Hi,

seems that you try to join two lines that don't have any intersection or
common point. Plugin ca't join those lines, it requires two lines with
intesection or with common point.

You'll need to be as specific as possible and as many details as you can
think of. What step in cmake-gui broke? Did you get and Error message?

Hi Devs, I'd like to a get take on the minimum versions for some of
the software that qgis depends on, namely GEOS, SIP, and GDAL/OGR.
What is our policy on minimum versions, how often do we update them,
and how can I find out what they are for the various bits and pieces?
Do we have any official documents/places where this information is
stored? I ask because a) recent versions of GEOS > 3.1 have several
new features like one sided buffers etc that would be quite nice to
have, and b) the more Pythonic way of interacting with the PyQGIS
bindings requires a more recent version of SIP > 4.9, which would make
python plugin development easier and cleaner for all the Pythonistas
out there...

Thanks in advance for any information,

Carson

Sorry Alex, I'll try it. when I build QGIS using the ALL_BUILD target from
VC2008, I always get this error:

Generating qgssearchstringparser.cpp
C:\Archivos de programa\GnuWin32\bin\bison.exe: m4: Invalid argument
Project : error PRJ0019: A tool returned an error code from "Generating
qgssearchstringparser.cpp"

Before I made .sln with CMake. No problems here.

Thanks,
Vanesa

So, I started opening ticket:

If the plugin developers are listening, please have a look to the trac, 
and see if you can fix the issues.
If anybody wants access to the trac, I'll be happy allowing him to do so.

Hi Carson, I was trying to discuss this in some earlier posts (currently 
I can not find which one). I agree is that this information should be 
properly discussed.
It is important for developers and packagers too.

General suggestion for all open source GIS should be to keep them at 
least as high as they are in current Debian Stable [1].
All of us want to have new features, devs want to work with new 
libraries. But in terms of real enterprise usage, we need stable, tested 
system, with minimal changes to core libraries - this is what Debian is 
considered as in open source world.

Good news is, that we can go on with Debian Squeeze in some half of year 
time.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New plugin repository
Message-ID: <AANLkTinGYhgAi6n7Hm2tUQnRmrybwY1QZAAimN4z=h5R@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would be happy to contribute to this development, I'm quite familiar with
(Geo)Django and I developed two small QGIS plugins.

I think we should start from some specs for the new repo, does already
exists a wiki page for that ? If not, should I create one ?

It would be nice to get in touch with whom developed the actual version of
the repo, so that we can get some initial guidance and advice about
potential pitfalls.

Thanks!

Welcome on board, Alessandro.
We just discussed with Tim and Borys, and I think a Django instance will 
be up and running soon.
All the best.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimtoC8gW40WsTzeVqfDy0eT8RNmWLcGV-CVmyBm@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

There has been a lot of discussion about the way forward for plugins,
the plugin repository, plugin source management and plugin issue
tracking / bug reporting in the last few weeks. Sitting in the same
room for the last few days, we have also been able to go into more
detail about our requirements. We would like to summarise our
requirements and plans and get things going. So here is the synopsis:

1) We will set up a django instance on the QGIS.org virtual machine
(using a python vitual environment) for building the new QGIS Plugin
Repository.
2) The code for the repository will be managed via GIT and is hosted
on github. If you need write access, please provide me with your
github user name. Details for the repo here:

https://github.com/timlinux/qgis-django

3) The management of issues for the repository itself will be done
using github infrastructure.
4) For the plugins themselves, we are going to request that OSGEO SAC
provide us with a trac instance dedicated for plugin bugs. It should
be configured to authenticate users via LDAP so that existing OSGEO
users will not need to create another account.
5) For the management of plugin source code, plugin authors will have
the option of hosting their own project code (e.g. on github,
sourceforge etc).
6) For plugin authors who wish to use an 'official' source repository,
we will put in an OSGEO SAC request to set up an SVN instance for QGIS
plugins. We will provide liberal access to that repository and
existing user name/passwords can be used. Plugins hosted in this repo
will be able to be maintained by QGIS developers should they need
fixing and the original author is no longer available.

Following this email we will post OSGEO SAC requests for the above
mentioned SVN and Trac instances and get going.

I have created a wiki page that we can use to document the setup and
procedures for plugin-repository authors and plugin writers here:

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/PluginRepository

We will use the same QGIS-Django project to include future work such
as reinstating the users map, creating the certification system web
site and so on.

If you are interested and able to collaborate with the django project
development please let us know and add yourself to the wiki page.

Thanks!

Regards

JFYI, news in raster-providers branch:
- raster providers interface extended to support data values (instead
of pictures)
- gdal staff extracted to separate provider
- grass provider modified to serve data values
- wms switched from draw() to readBlock() passing picture as ARGB data
type block

The work is still in progres, all the drivers seemd to work but I
cannot yet recomend any testing.

Hackfest is almost over, last 4 developers in the room.

Thanks Martin. That was exactly the mistake! After setting the main() method and the last two lines at top level, my application now runs :)
Many Many thanks again... this 1 almost got me to tear my hair :D

Hi William,

It appears that some script components in, at least, the MinSizeRel build are not working. They seem to be expecting a directory in the application bundle that is not present. The following is at the end of the 'make install' command:

-- Updating QGIS library paths...
install_name_tool: can't open file: /Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/fcgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi (No such file or directory)

My cmake command is this:
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Applications -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -D WITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE=FALSE ..

... looks like the mapserver component was recently made optional, off by default.  The error is harmless, but I'll fix it to check first.

If you want to test the mapserver, add to configuration:

 -D WITH_MAPSERVER

Yes, -D WITH_MAPSERVER=TRUE works and no complaints from the script.

So change of mind from our discussion on IRC yesterday? Should Pirmin
and I still bother with the test install of Redmine?

To be clear #2 above is where the code for the django site itself will
be hosted, not the source code of plugins.

#3 isn't going to be kinda weird for people to report bugs to github
about things not working on the website, or do we expect to just funnel
email comments about it to the bug system ourselves.

#6 I assume this SVN integrated with the New plugin bug trac site is ok?
Did you still want the ability to set permissions by folder on the svn
(this is doable).

Thanks,
Alex

By the way, just a fast idea from definitely slower train from the Hackfest to 
the home: What about using some CADTools code to join also *not intersecting* 
lines? 

Last time we have to connect a bunch of maybe 50000 ugly drafted segments into 
a reasonable network. Maybe it's slightly different approach, but I believe 
quite common problem, when one has to cope with available data.

Actually I'm still a bit confused and don't want to take one of the two sides 
(mainly because I only looked briefly at the Redmine), but let's just write 
down the disadvantages and threats of the two solutions.

Django:
+ the repository is easy to write
? can we connect a vcs as an integrated backend to the repo? (If no, let's try 
to sketch the workflow with external ones - are all the authors granted to 
upload the release to the repo or only the coordinator is, etc)
? can we handle existing osgeo accounts via ldap?
? can we write a trac plugin for syncronizing #tickets with release versions 
only, or with revisions in the backend vcs too?
? any other thoughts... 

Redmine:
? I assume, all the trac and vcs system is OFTB. Am I right?
? What with the repo itself? Is the API sufficient for uploading and 
downloading zips and downloading the metadata in easy-to-parse format? If not, 
should it be written as a (redmine) plugin? Is there anybody keen to write it? 
(in Ruby, as I think?)
? any other thoughts...

I've probably missed many important points after the 5 unsleepy days and 
nights.

Maybe better let's keep the repository bugtracking inside its trac. Do you see 
any disadvantages (except the case whole application hangs or crashes)

I think the major problem is to grant permissions to create new folders (when 
creating each new plugin). Is it doable?

Not out of the box as far as I know, but nothing's impossible. (might be
faster to use something premade)

Should not be an issue for any of the options.

I think it would be easy to write a django app that pulls from an svn or
git specified by the user, zips up the files and posts the plugin for
download. The user managing a given plugin would just need to ensure the
right link to their source code.

What do you mean by "synchronizing" tickets? Any arbitrary version
numbers could exist in trac, are you thinking you want that to link to a
django site url? That sounds doable to me.

Entirely possible if someone is up for Ruby. Probably also entirely
possible as a TracPlugin which would be python.

I was under the impression the choices were between:
Django Frontend for hosting releases of plugins / Trac+svn backend for
issues and code
VS
Django Frontend for hosting releases of plugins / Redmine+git backend
for issues and code

That way we only loosely couple the front and back which while more
complex is more flexible and allows for easier opt-in components. Also
means the front-end dev won't be held up by backend issues. If people
stick to naming conventions it should be easy to create an easy link to
jump from a given plugin on the Django site to it's page on the trac
site or it's issue summary.

I just thought it was odd to send people to github for issues related to
a QGIS website. Where do we currently log website issues?

Based on my research this is not an issue if we use the following Trac
macros and plugins. When a user fills out the form to register a new
plugin it creates the svn folder.
http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/NewHackMacro (requires slight customization)
Permission per folder can be done through the web, or it could be an
all/none based on if you've been added to the approved list.
http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/SvnAuthzAdminPlugin

Although my read of Tim's announcement was that he no longer cared if
there was folder level permissions on the svn for plugin development.

Thanks,
Alex

In my opinion it's not a discussion between Django and Redmine. The confusion 
comes from not discussing all aspects in one session (yes, people were too 
tired).

I would group the aspects in
1. Package repository + Package download website
2. Plugin source code repository
3. Bug tracking + Plugin home pages

Borys and Martin proposed a solution for point 1, developed with Django. They 
did not couple the package repository with the source code repository to let 
plugin developers choose their SCM.

Tim's announcement includes the following solutions for these aspects:
1. Django application
2. One(?) Github repository
3. One(?) Trac instance

In the discussion Alex is referring to, we came to this:
1. not discussed
2. OSGeo Git server
3. Redmine

We didn't go deeper into point 2 and number 3 was not confirmed by Tim.
I have absolutely no problems with Tim's solution and I'm sure he will clarify 
open points as soon as he arrives in South Africa.

Regards
Pirmin

I think I saw something pass thru the tracker with some isnan updates, after r14601.  But I haven't tried anything in svn yet.

Things are still not working for me, and I have been behind a firewall unable to get on irc to chat with J?ergen. Perhaps I can assist in testing some code ideas he may have later in the week.

... Well, the problem is not isnan, that's just what r14601 mentioned.  The problem is abs(), and this has come up before for OS X - I think it had something to do with the order of includes.

There are a lot of places in Qgis that use abs() (more than just the 2 interpolator sources changed in r14601), and they generally include cmath/math.h after most other includes.  Strange, there is a lot of inconsistent use of the includes and function calls:

some always include cmath and use std::abs()

some conditionally include math.h for OS X and cmath for all other systems, and use abs() (without the std C++ namespace)

... so, cmath seems to work on OS X in those other parts of Qgis (maybe there were problems with cmath on older OS X systems?), so just always include cmath.  Worked for me on 10.6, but should be checked on older systems (at least 10.5).  I might be able to try that this week (I do need to build the 1.6 PPC package still).

I took out all of the ifdef's setting math.h for OS X on these and other header files that used that. Additionally, I had to append "std::" to the isnan and isinf in the two if statements, e.g.:
    if ( std::isnan( inX[i2] ) || std::isnan( inY[i2] ) || std::isinf( inX[i2] ) || std::isinf( inY[i2] )
         || std::isnan( inX[i1] ) || std::isnan( inY[i1] ) || std::isinf( inX[i1] ) || std::isinf( inY[i1] ) )

in the qgsclipper.h file. Likely, there might need to be an ifdef for Q_OS_MACX in this file for this. I got a successful build afterwards.

Worked for me on 10.6, but should be checked on older systems (at least 10.5).  I might be able to try that this week (I do need to build the 1.6 PPC package still).

So following Pirmin's advice I set up a communty repo on github rather
- I've deleted the original one.

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django

If you need access to the new one - let us know and we can add you. My
apologies if you already wrote 10000 lines of code against the old
repo.

In the discussion at the hackfest (following the irc discussion) we
felt that using trac would be a lower threshold to cross - a number of
us know it (as admins), as do the users. Personally I'm not averse to

Ok I think Pirmin broke it down better than I in his follow up post,
but lets try to separate discussion about the management of the
codebase for the qgis-django project which among other things will
provide the new plugin portal, from the plugins themselves. In the
case of qgis-django portal, the suggestion was to completely manage it
using github infrastructure.

Yes the idea was that each plugin author would be given a folder that
only they (or team members) could write to. Its an admin overhead (for
you?) but would be the idea - liberal access so that anyone can have
an svn write account but they can only write to their own dir.

Right lets call this 'the plugin portal' to be developed using django
+ git + github for issue tracking.

> 2. Plugin source code repository

Correct. Proposal from some is to provide an svn with liberal access
(anyone can get a committer account) with each user given write access
only to their project folder. Some in the discussion have suggested we
just skip this part an focus on 1 & 3. Using git instead of svn for
this part would also be fine though the concensus seemed to be that
people are more likely to be familiar with svn and that they can just
create github accounts if they want to use git.

> 3. Bug tracking + Plugin home pages

Right. Bug tracking seems to me to be where the main contention lies
(between trac or redmine). Personally I dont have a strong opinion
either way other than being familiar with trac and unfamiliar with
redmine.

For plugin home pages - isnt this something that can be provided as
part of the plugin portal? Should be easy to do?



I think we need to just pick a set of technologies that a) offers the
best functionality as individual parts b) are easily integrated and c)
that will be most easily adapted to by plugin authors. I say 'just' in
my previous sentance though socially it seems difficult to actually
make the choice between such a mixed bag of technologies, so maybe it
should come down to 'he who is prepared to maintain it has the
strongest argument'. In which case since Alex is prepared to put in
the work on the insfrastructure side for the plugins versioning and
issue tracker we should just let him set something up and go with it.

For the qgis portal side I think everything is catered for with github
and we can just get on with it.

Tim

Hi (plugin repo) devs

I have committed a basic django project (it as yet contains no apps)
along with readme license, installation guide etc. Its ready for you
to start building your apps underneath it.

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django

I was thinking along the lines of having three apps:

plugins
usermap
certification

i.e. please dont hardwire templates etc. around just the concept of
the plugin repo as we will also develop other functionality within the
same project.

Regards

Tim

Hello Hasan,

I think this is not the thread you wanted to reply to, and you only replied to 
me as well -- not to the list.

If the plugin only exists on your local machine, this is exactly the behaviour 
I would expect. This is no bad message. It just says, you can't update it via 
a remote repository.

Hi Hasan,

Well I think your error message tells it all: You have problems with
indentations.
If the only issue is that you have mixed tabs and spaces, then you
could do a simple find and replace to correct that problem.
However, without looking at your code we really won't be able to help much.

Hi,

I need to put into focus the requirements of this project, a couple of
questions before start writing code:

* should we use this page http://www.qgis.org/wiki/PluginRepository for
specs or directly put them on github ?
* a DB dump of the the actual Repository application would be helpful, how
can we obtain it ?
* who wrote the actual application ? Can we get some guidance from the
original author (hints, common pitfalls etc.) ?
* what is the purpose of the "certification" app ?
* since there is a "usermap" application, can we rely on postgis (is it
available) on the server ?

Thanks!

There is something available of this branch in qgis trunk version ?

Hi Andrea

The table join is not in trunk. The threading branch is the first branch that

Subject: [Qgis-developer] gdal and zip archives
Message-ID: <972C6439-A88F-4249-B2B1-4B2250620917@gmail.com>

Hi all,

GDAL has support for reading raster files that are either zip or gzip archived. I've got many 24k topo maps that I would like to leave in their zip format to save hard drive space. GDAL on my system is capable of working on them, e.g., 'gdalinfo /vsizip/o35114a1.zip/o35114a1.tif' provides a summary of the raster properties.

Unfortunately, qgis does not know how to handle these files, at least on my system. As you can see in the gdal trac report ( http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/1369 ), you have to prepend, in the example above, '/vsizip/ to the file name and append the actual file name that is inside the zip archive, unless it is the only file in the archive.

This is probably not very practical for qgis to try and guess the file inside the archive, nor does it make sense to ask the user every time one of these files is loaded. But, it is relatively trivial for the user to create a vrt for one or more source files within zip archives, e.g., 'gdal_translate -of vrt /vsizip/o35114a1.zip/o35114a1.tif o35114a1.vrt'. Although I would hope this file would work in qgis, it does not.

I tested in GRASS by running r.in.gdal on the vrt file as well as on /vsizip/o35114a1.zip/o35114a1.tif and it imported successfully both times. Could others test this on non-OSX systems to see if qgis handles this correctly for them? The file, about 1.5mb, that I used is available here:
ftp://anonymous@dataworks.library.unr.edu/keck/DRG%26Topos/24k/clipped/o37117f4.zip

Cheers,
John

Message-ID: <A9E6BECC-8969-4057-A711-EEC75C85CFBE@gmail.com>

Hi Marco,

The new label placement tools are an excellent addition to qgis. I tried to test these on OSX, but they seem to be non-functional. For my test case, I added a polygon shapefile, used the advanced labeling plugin to label the layer with default settings and a valid text field, then clicked the move tool. I get a plus symbol cursor, but clicking on a label does not do anything. This is true for the other tools also.

I look forward to using this. Let me know if I can provide any details that might help you get to the underlying problem on OS X.

Thanks,
John

Hi John

There is a little blog article about the tools on www.sourcepole.com

The tools only work on data defined label position / rotation / properties. So 
if you want to move labels, you need to have a field with x-values and y-values 
in the layer. Additionally, the layer needs to be in edit mode.

If you don't have x-,y-fields, you could just create them. In case of NULL 
values, the label will be automatically placed.


Regards,
Marco

I believe we are just waiting for the packagers to finish. So sometime
in the next week is fairly likely.

Yes Postgis can be made available on the server, are we sure the load is
high enough to warrant it over Spatialite? I can't recall if we moved
the Joomla backend to Postgres, if we did then +1 to add postgis to it.
If we are still using Mysql then we might want to try keeping the load
lower with Spatialite.

I believe Gary wrote the previous app and has it hosted on his servers,
so we'll need to ask him for the dump(hopefully he sees this).

Alex

Thanks for the clarification. By all means please set a date for the end
of the Redmine test. Note, the only reason we are trying Redmine is
because it's more likely to allow for web based creation of multiple git
repos, one per plugin which would easily take care of the permission issues.

I would like to hold off on setting up trac/svn for plugin-dev until we
are sure that Redmine/git is not what we want or doesn't work the way we
want.

Thanks,
Alex

I'm not sure what code editor you are using but I suggest to try either
SPE or Eric. Both of those will show indentation errors in a way that
you can fix them. There's another edit that was suggested sometime
recently on the list but I can't recall the name, didn't bother to try
it since it was windows only.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Marco,

Thanks for the notes about usage. Once I set things up properly, it worked as expected. Another excellent addition to the codebase.

Cheers,
John

Ok good. For those interested, you can test drive redmine here:

http://demo.redmine.org/

Shall we give it a couple of weeks? End of November work for everyone?
At which point we will do the painfull thing and commit to a
particular set of technologies :-P

Lets ask Gary for it. Gary can you help here?

Gary did. It was written in Ruby on rails if I recall correctly.

This will be used for managing QGIS certifcation - issuing training
certificates, keeping track of those who are certified and to what
level. At the moment it is vapourware.

It would be nice. Alex answered this below. I never used GeoDjango
with spatialite - if it works ok that would be an option to start with
too.

Can you post exactly what the error message said? Usually python error
messages tell you exactly what line and what type of error occurred
which is really critical for figuring out how to fix it.

AFAIK, only python 2.5 works in QGIS 1.5 in Windows.

It is written in Rails. There are some validation checks done when
uploading a plugin that you should implement, however I don't care to
share them in a public forum...

git svn clone --revision HEAD
http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/graphics/trunk/ osgeo-graphics

(I took the whole lot from trunk).

It was nice to see you were on IRC, hope you will hang out there more often!

Regards

Tim

Hi,

this has probably nothing to do with qgis :-)

python is all about 'indentation': your code should have the right
structure: eg the lines after an 'if' should be indented the right way.
Have a look at your indents, are there maybe tabs and space mixed?

http://diveintopython.org/getting_to_know_python/indenting_code.html
http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation

Hi,

I read your code(db.py), your problem is use both, spaces(4 space) and TAB.

Use only one, not possible use both.

I setting my text editor to change TAB to 2 spaces.

See in your code the lines 33 and 34, have TAB, you need change for spaces.

If you use WINDOWS, i liked the Notepad++ editor for write  Python's code to
small project, for complex projects i prefer use the ECLIPSE with PyDev.

Hi,

you should not need to compile pyqt yourself, but download a binary
(already compiled) from:
.. doing some googling ...
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
en take this one for your python 2.5:
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Downloads/PyQt4/PyQt-Py2.5-gpl-4.8.1-1.exe

see:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Writing_Python_Plugins

if you need to build your own gui, you will also need Qt dev tools:
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/

Hi List,

the manageR plugin requires for the action "Import Layer From Canvas" the R package "sp".

The common way to install sp within the manageR CLI fails:

The downloaded packages are in

Warning message:

Does anybody know a way to solve this one ?

 What happens when you try this from the R command line from a
terminal window, rather than manageR? Possibly manageR is hiding some
diagnostic messages.

 Since sp is being installed from source, my first suspicion is that
you don't have the requisite C/Fortran compilers on your system. Is it
ubuntu/apt-based? Do "sudo apt-get install build-essential" from a
command line, that should get them.

Which is the directory of color ramps for New vector Symbology? I mean, where

I'd like to check the format and see if I can put there my own.

Hi Barry,

after having R-dev installed, getting sp works like a charm:

install.packages("sp")

library(sp) 

does the trick.

Using "Import Layer From Canvas" works for point and line layers (tested on the Spearfish dataset)

However, applying "Import Layer From Canvas" for polygon layers leads to a segfault.

Any Suggestions ?

Peter

Hi Peter, would it be possible for you to send me an example of the
dataset that causes the crash?

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=AcFFHQG_VyX5JviW8T=AuhU5sMP2Vu-7h780m@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am currently developping a plugin for QGis. My input data are shapefiles,
and I would like to clean their geometries before doing some processing.
v.clean() found in GRASS seems to do the job.
However, I really have no idea on how to:

1) fill a grass vector layer with geometries readed in a qgis vector layer
2) call in my (c++) code v.clean()

Could you please help me?

Best regards

Olivier

Hi Olivier,
this seems really interesting and useful, if you'll make to develop the
plugin do you plan to contribute it to the project?

Hi Robert

thanks a lot! May I ask you for one more related icon - color ramp?
They are also included in the style, so it would be good to have an
icon for them too.

Hi Martin

Here it is

http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/browser/graphics/trunk/toolbar-icons/color.svg
http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/graphics/trunk/toolbar-icons/color.svg

Now I will work on smaller size of layer properties icons and GRASS toolbox.
If you have some more needs, please open ticket for Graphics component 
in track.
http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&component=Graphics

Or just write mail.

Right - trac is a good option because users know it, developers know
it, some people even know how to administrate it :-) So unless other
bug tracking system comes with some features that we seriously need
and Trac does not have them, we should probably stick to it.

Right, there are two separate things from my point of view: plugin
repository and ticket system for plugins. While we can choose from
various available bug tracking systems, the requirements for the
plugin repository are quite unique and I'm not aware of any existing
software that could be used for it.

I have updated the plugin repository wiki page and tried to dump as
much as possible from the ideas and requirements:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/PluginRepository

My opinion is that we simply shouldn't provide a common svn/git
repository for plugin authors. Why try to provide source code hosting
for 3rd parties if there are lots of easily accessible free source
code hosting services? There is Google Project Hosting
(SVN/Mercurial), SourceForge (SVN/CVS/Git/Mercurial/Bazaar), BitBucket
(SVN/Mercurial), GitHub and Gitorious (Git) and many others. These
services allow users to create their code hosting in one minute and
what is most important - with no admin overhead for QGIS project. We
could just give the plugin authors some hints which hostings are the
best.

Additionally the free hostings usually provide bug tracking systems
and other services, so we could possibly even skip the part with
setting up a common bug tracking system for 3rd party plugins. Because
if a plugin author is not willing to use the common tracking system,
the number of tickets will increase without being ever resolved.

I have updated that wiki page, hopefully making it more clear what
functionality should the new repository offer. In summary these are
the main proposed improvements:
- user logins from osgeo ldap
- easier uploading of plugins (no manual setting of versions etc.)
- more owners for one plugin
- changelogs for new versions
- counting of downloads
- simple online portal for viewing plugins
- trusted/untrusted users - to make it more complicated to publish
plugins with malicious code
- rewrite to Django - potentially larger group of devs being able to
maintain the application than with Ruby on Rails

The feature set is open for the discussion, anyway I would like to
keep the number of features as low as possible for first version.
Volunteers are welcome to start coding :-)

Martin

I feel that a central option would help new plugin authors and authors
who want collaborate on plugins. I've created a sourceforge site for my
plugins in the past and attracted zero developers and only had a handful
of bugs put into my trac. Aside from that, a central place lets us
easily adopt abandoned plugins, and to give 1 place for reporting bugs
which in theory would improve the reporting and tracking of fixes.

I don't think we have to host it, but if we don't I would like to see us
pick one of the 3rd party hosting services and create a collaborative
collective under which people list their plugins(a qgis group).

A large number of plugins right now aren't even under version control
and even fewer of them have public tickets systems. So when I go to hack
on a plugin(that isn't mine) I never know if I have the latest code or
if it's been fixed and I don't expect an update to the release for every
little fix. I also have no idea if it's still under development, or
abandoned in favor of something else, merged into another plugin, etc.

I actually see a bug tracker also serving as a quality check. If like
you say a lot of bugs get filed for a plugin but never get solved, it
gives us the opportunity to ask if the plugin is dead, and if so to
change it's xml so users realize it's no longer being developed. Or to
calculate some measure of the plugins likelihood to work. It's also an
opt in thing, a plugin won't automatically be in the list of things to
report against.

As for the Trac vs. Redmine thing, yes we are specifically looking at
Redmine in the hopes that it can provide a feature that we don't think
Trac is capable of(easily) which is out of the box support for multiple
GIT repos.

Thanks,
Alex

Picking a 3rd party hosting service seems like an option. Anyway there
were such motions before, but did not really succeed:

I just have the impression that the plugin developers mostly will not
use that service. As you say, lots of plugins don't have any
versioning system (or just a private one) and maybe that's because the
authors do not need it for their work - more than 90% of the plugins
are one-man shows.

In the new plugin repository we would like to keep track of plugin
updates - so determining whether the plugin is dead should be simple.

The biggest con is that we can't use osgeo logins if it's 3rd party.
This to me is a big barrier to getting people using it. So picking a
place a bunch of us already use would be good. We could speculate more
about why that one didn't pan out (had forgotten about it) but I think
the important parts are that there needs to be some buy-in (which I feel
we have now that we've discussed the options), some ability for qgis
core devs to admin over it (for rescue purposes), and more visibility
like obvious linkage from qgis.org and in this case the new plugin site
that's being built.

My guess is a survey amongst current plugin and core devs would have
them pick github 1st and maybe googlecode next with
bitbucket/launchpad/sourceforge on the least favorite end.

I also think Paolo is really excited about a central place to report and
track issues. His team seems to do most of it right now and I see how
other users searching the internet could really benefit from knowing
where to look/getting them in search results. Then it just becomes a
cultural thing to convince devs to pay attention to it.

I actually see this as a potential issue going forward as more and more
people rely on plugins to get stuff done and there is potential to
incorporate some plugins that offer central functionality into the core.
A Bus number of 1 is kinda scary and while they may be one man shows
that might be because it too much effort to solicit help (I've heard
this from some developers out there over the years, 'I didn't open up
the code or ask for collaboration because it was too much extra work').

Lack of version control is a little frightening too (Carson lost all his
original work on ftools at one point because he wasn't using version
control, I think he recovered from the already released code). My goal
is to better enable collaboration and encourage good open source
programming practices.

Example, someone files a ticket with a patch to fix a major bug(feature)
in a plugin. Said plugin appears to be dead. So someone else grabs the
patch, forks the code, applies the patch and releases the plugin update.

I'm open to trying github right now before we go and install stuff if we
can figure out how to group stuff. I get the feeling the issue tracking
won't be super central but it's really easy to try it 1st before we
start installing stuff on the servers.

Thanks,
Alex

Ponies!?? :-) Heheh cant wait to see how the portal is going to look
with this kind of inspiration :-)

I was also thinking about a few other apps to go under our django project:

- python snippets
- c++ snippets
- style repository
- symbol repository (svgs / pngs / ttfs)

If we can make them all in pink that would be cool too :-) I know
above are future things but it would be nice to bear in mind where we
are going as we build the plugin repo app so that we can maximise code
re-use.

Regards

Tim

Hi,

so far so good, but I don't understand the difference between trusted and
untrusted users?
What is the difference?
Can this "trust" flag be handled with django groups ?

Sorry, I missed the note. It's clear enough.

And I think a django group could do the job quite right.

Message-ID: <20101121134001.47c11d4e@nature.site>

Hi,

when I compare the english and the german GUI in version 1.6, all shortcuts
are different. For example using the english gui a klick on "CTRL-Q" closes
QGIS. Starting with the german GUI the same is done with a klick on "Q".

Why is this? And can we make a decision what kind of shortcuts to use? Or
maybe is this already changed again in trunk? Don't have it here right now.

 Otto

Hi,

I've just committed a first draft of the plugins app.

I've had not much time to test it, admin seems to be working, while public
views are still missing, I was thinking about using generic views as much as
possible.

I'm not sure about the "last" flag in versions, are not the version and
modified dates sufficient to determine the last version ?

I've also added some globs to .gitignore

Comments welcome!

Hi Carson,

the dataset is the standard Spearfish sample dataset (http://grass.fbk.eu/sampledata/spearfish_grass60data-0.3.tar.gz)[data layers used: archsites (point), streams (line), quads (polygon)].

I am using QGIS 1.6.0 (similar effects were observed in QGIS 1.4). "Reprojection on the fly" is active, using EPSG:4326 as reference SRS.

Here's a transcript from the shell output:

It seems like the segfaulting occurs independent from the geometry type of the layers, but occurs when a _second_ layer is imported into manageR.

It would be a visually important enhancement for us

Hi Micha

It is possible to do the same in the legend too, but it is more complicated 
compared to the labels.

Please fill an enhancement request in trac and assign it to me.

Hi Peter,

Good, and are you using version 1.0 of manageR?

> It seems like the segfaulting occurs independent from the geometry type of the layers, but occurs when a _second_ layer is imported into manageR.
Hmm, I'm not getting the same behaviour here (Ubuntu Linux 10.04,
R-2.12.0, rpy2-2.1.4, QGIS-1.7.0-Trunk-revision 14735). I was able to
import any and all spearfish layers...
My guess is that this is a GDAL/OGR issue. Which version of GDAL do
you have on your system?

Hi Muhammad, I have the same problems and I wrote many times to this 
list but I have not received good answers. When there are problems, 
tutorials don`t work and we need help from the community.
I think this situation isn't good for FOSS, and technical people is 
moving from QGis to others systems like gvSIG. A lot of people are with 
the same problem to create plugin (c++ or python) with windows XP.
I agree with you, but I can?t help you, I?m sorry

regards,
Rafa

Really? I do not find many emails from you in this list (actually I did 
not find any).

Sorry, I think you're being unfair: you are asking for free help, which 
may work (the list archive testify this thousands of times) or may not 
help, if your problem is not interesting for the developers or other 
power users.
That's what technical commercial support is for: if you *need* help, you 
should be prepared to pay for it, nothing wrong with that IMHO.
BTW: my stats say the contrary to your findings: more people are moving 
from gvSIG to QGIS than vice versa.
But of course it's free software, everybody is free to do what they prefer.
All the best.

I am sorry to hear that you have had problems getting help from the
community, normally the QGIS devs and users are quite ready and
willing to provide help, and are generally much more friendly than
most mailing lists. They do however require a minimal level of help
from you (the poster) as well:

In Hasan's case, I think we'll probably need more information about
the problem that he is having before we'll be able to help him. Most
developers are busy people, and without a reproducible example or test
case to work with, we are unlikely to be able to help during the
limited spare time that we have. Things to think about when asking
questions are: What is your operating system (obviously in this case
it is Win XP), What versions of the various bits of software are you
running (in this case Muhammad has provided this information already),
and what *exactly* is the problem that you are experiencing. It is not
clear from the original email what the problem is. Is the plugin that
you are having trouble with one of your own, or is it one of the many
plugins available via the plugin installer? It sounds like it is one
of your own plugins, in which case, what exactly is the error message
that you are getting when trying to load it in QGIS? Have you followed
the tutorials provided for building PyQGIS plugins? When does the
error occur (during QGIS startup, when trying to activate the plugin,
during execution of plugin code)?

If you would like a complete and 'good' answer, then you'll have to
provide us with more information, and 'good' examples of your problem.
If you post a snippet of code that seems to be giving you issues, then
devs and other users are more likely to to able to help (and want to
help), because they can simply fire up their QGIS, and paste some code
into the Python console or similar. Help us help you!

Carson

Paolo, Carson. Thanks for answering. This is what I wrote on November 12:
/Hi,
I've been trying to build QGIS with VC++ 2008 Express and I'm following 
the notes [1], but when I build QGIS using the ALL_BUILD target, I 
always get this error:

3>*C:\Archivos de programa\GnuWin32\bin\bison.exe: m4: Invalid argument*

3>qgis_core - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)
/

/
any suggestions?

Thanks,
Rafael/

In this case, it got no response.

Here, I wrote on November 3:
Morning.
I would like to start with QSIG+QT in Windows XP. Now, I am trying to 
make a plugin with c++ in QT creator. Does anybody have an example of 
.pro file?

Thanks!
Rafael

In this case, only Matt just told me, but the problem was still there. 
Thanks Matt.

I'm sure the people on the list trying to help, but I think these 
problems are very common error, however, we are not getting good 
solutions. Perhaps because we are not very explicit (Rafa, Muhammad, 
Vanessa, ..)
I think for community growth QGis (like the entire FOSS) is important 
for knowledge sharing.
Paolo, I understand you have to pay for that knowledge, in fact it was I 
who asked you budget for a course this morning.

Regards,
Rafa

Add %PROGRAMFILES%\GnuWin32\bin to your PATH.

Are the notes you mentioned the installation guide[1] or are you refering to
something else?

Hi all,

We missed hackfest again :( But we were busy working on several
things, that might be of interest, we:

1. fixed qgis2google, working again ;)
2. created a win-build with OTB plugins based on r14713m
3. modified all three measurement tools to work with
unprojected data in lat-long and automagically give numbers in meters etc
(angles are spherical), calculations are using QgsDistanceArea
and WGS84 based. Handy for those who have rasters in latlong, but
still want to get measurements in meters/km2

Yeah, everyone loves ponies :)

I think the snippets can be kept in the developer cookbook - it was
meant to be both an introduction to the API and a place where to find
useful snippets. Anyway there's djangosnippets.org - site with
user-contributed django snippets, its code is available so we could
reuse it for our site.

Yes, that would be very useful.

My comments from a brief review:
- download count should be rather related to plugin versions, not
plugins - for more detailed stats
- in addition to user-readable name, there should be plugin's package
(i.e. internal) name which is unique among plugins
- the plugin could have two more attributes: active "stable" version
and active "development" (experimental) version. One of them can be
empty, because not all plugins will produce separate
stable/development versions. It should be then possible to change
active version to any version that has been uploaded. I think this is
better than having flags in plugin version model, because only one
stable/development version can be active at one time.

Btw. does anybody know how to deal with logins using osgeo ldap
server? E.g. is it necessary to have some permissions in order to
access it?

Hi Rafael,
you wrote only 2 emails and you got a response to one of them: I unable to
understand what is the problem...

About your emails:

I'm not a Win user, so I cannot help you. BTW there are very few developers
which
used to are on Windows OS, e.g. I've no idea on compiling QGis on Windows.

IMHO it's no reasonable talking about FOSS as well as you do and using Win
for
developing it.

Matthew replied to you explaining a lot of things about plugin developing.
Here your response:

*Thank you for your response Matt. I will try it.

*No other emails... It seems you solved the problem, but now you say that
the
problem is still there! Why you didn't reply again?
There are no magicians here...

But the very problem is that this thread it's just 4 hours old and your
email is just
3 hours old...
Furthermore the Hasan's email its not related to your previous emails, so
why
did you reply to this thread?

Here your message:
*
I have the same problems and I wrote many times to this list but I have not
received
good answers.*

You wrote:
1. "the same problems", untrue because the .pro file it's a different
problem.
2. "many times", untrue because it's just one (even through the .pro file
it's a
different problem)
3. "good answers" is enough different from "no answers"

Summary: maybe are you a troll?
IMHO yes. If you like to talk about gvSIG, go to its ML ;)

Sure, but the knowledge sharing is not "You must share" but "I wanna share".
You cannot pretend someone helps you...

To ALL: sorry for both the noise and my long email. I hate trolls...

Cheers.

Hi guys,

 I just had a quick look at the plugin repo spec. Cool.

 It mentions putting plugin metadata in a config file rather than
having it executable in __init__.py - I've been doing that for a while
with my plugins. I have config.ini which looks like:

[general]
name: autosave
version: 0.21
description: save qgis projects as we go...
author: Barry Rowlingson <b.rowlingson@lancaster.ac.uk>
qgisMinimumVersion: 1.0

and then __init__.py looks like this:

import ConfigParser
import os.path
p = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()
here = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),"config.ini")
p.read(here)

def name():
  return p.get('general','name')

[and so on for the other methods]

The advantage here is that it only uses standard python modules, the
config file is easy for a human to edit (please no XML!), it's
flexible (can have more than just the [general] section) and so on.

 Eventually I hope some kind of config.ini is mandated and I can
delete the methods in __init__.py - but at the moment I can do either!

 A useful thing might be some python code to produce a config.ini from
an existing __init__.py methods... Are there plugins with complex code
in the __init__.py methods? I've just grepped all the __init__.py that
I have in the qgis plugins I've installed and I can't find anything
more complex than returning a string (except in my config.ini-driven
plugins!).

I was about to ask about that. What are the plans for the cookbook and

Plans are to continue documenting various parts of the API, add useful
pieces of code that can be copy-pasted, improve quality of existing
documentation. Basically anything that might be useful for other devs
doing some PyQGIS coding is welcome.

> how can I get access to start adding things to it?

The sources are in QGIS svn, documentation section:
https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/docs/trunk/english_us/developer_cookbook/

In case you have write access to docs section, you can start
comitting! Otherwise you start with sending patches and optionally ask
for write access.

That's nice! I've been thinking about exactly this type of format. And
to make it even more awesome, I thought we could provide a method in
qgis.utils module with some dark magic that would inject the
__init__.py file with the metadata on the fly:

def parse_config(filename, dct):
  import ConfigParser
  import os.path
  p = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()
  p.optionxform = str  # don't convert keys to lower-case
  here = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(filename),"config.ini")
  p.read(here)
  inject(p.items('general'), dct)

def make_func(name, value):
    def innerfunc(): return value
    innerfunc.__name__ = name
    return innerfunc

def inject(items, dct):
  for name,value in items:
    dct[name] = make_func(name,value)

So that in __init__.py file you would end up with just:

import qgis.utils
qgis.utils.parse_config(__file__, globals())

# ... here comes the classFactory() method ...

Exactly, thanks for pointing me to ConfigParser, I was nearly going to
create my own parser :)


> ?Eventually I hope some kind of config.ini is mandated and I can

I think for 1.x releases we will have to provide the metadata in
__init__.py file - at least with that 2-lines wrapper. From 2.0 we
could start with cleaner __init__.py file.

Right - some methods for easier transition could be provided. Anyway,
it's crazy to return anything else than a string.

Hi Stefan,

not sure if this still affects you, but I've just came across this
problem (on ubuntu) and fixed it in trunk (r14743).

If so, then running the following might help:

#in the shell:
which gdal-config
gdal-config --prefix
gdal-config --libs
gdal-config --cflags
gdal-config --version
gdal-config --ogr-enabled
gdal-config --formats

# in R
myPackages<-installed.packages()
myPackages[myPackages[,1] %in% c("rgdal", "sp"),]

Great stuff, very useful.
I know it's an old thread, but: any special reason not to add the plugins to svn?
All the best.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikhPpJav0YapGxMRZQDXPbs7CSdj-t52YWLLpHb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I'm going to follow directions in
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Building_QGIS_from_Source#3.12._A_practical_case:_Building_QGIS_and_GRASS_from_source_on_Ubuntu_with_ECW_and_MrSID_formats_support

in order to have the latest qgis version in ubuntu 10.4.

After reading, I have 2 doubts:

1. I have grass installed from binaries. Do I need to compile it or
can the new qgis just use the version I have installed (from
binaries)?
2. I want to keep my current stable version from binaries. I
understand that after doing
sudo make install

I will substitute the older by the newer.
How could I rename the new version so that after make install I would
have qgis for the current stable and i.e., qgis17 for the latest?

Thanks

Agus

If you compile you also specify where you GRASS lives.  You should point it to
the GRASS you intent to use.

Point CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to an other directory than /usr (/usr/local or
~/apps) for instance).   That way you can have the packages version in the
usual location and your own build somewhere else.

Does it always default to WGS84 when computing distances, even if a
user is using NAD27? or does it just go off the default CRS as defined
in the options?

1. So in my case (Synaptic installing from ubuntugis), I set GRASS_PREFIX to
/usr/lib/grass64 in ccmake, right? Is there an easy way to know where
Synaptic installs packages instead of having to make long searches?

2. I must avoid
sudo make install
to do not overwrite my current qgis, right?

I mean, the best is just copying the new executable to /usr/bin/qgis17 

3. Section "3.12.6. Step 6: compile and install QGIS" tells the reader to
copy tar files, while svn is 
used for gdal in section "3.12.4. Step 4: compile and install the gdal
libraries". For consistency, could the directions for using svn for qgis be
included also? (i.e., like
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/doc/manual/qgis-1.5.0_coding-compilation_guide_en.pdf
p.64-p.66)

4. I also note that reference [12] is broken and there is no qgis > 1.5 in
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/ 
(referred to by [13]) 

5. Is the list of requirements in qgis-1.5.0_coding-compilation_guide_en.pdf
p.62-64 up to date?

Thanks

Agus

If you've changed the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, then you can 
safely run 'make install'. If you've chosen a directory under 
/home/alobo then you shouldn't even need sudo to install.

Then, with sudo privileges, create a soft link /usr/bin/qgis7 
pointing to
  /home/alobo/apps/bin/qgis (or wherever the qgis binary got 
placed)

hmm, funny, I don't get a syntax error there... What about if you
change that line to:

sl = voronoi.SiteList([voronoi.Site(i[0],i[1], sitenum=j) for j, i in
enumerate(uniqueSet)])

Note, the file to change will be in your source directory:
qgis/python/plugins/fTools/tools/doGeometry.py

ok, I finally run make install and got the package built in my

Is it possible to define a different .qgis directory for not messing up the
plugins?

Hi all.
Currently, PostGIS Manager is an enormously useful tool. I would recommend its
inclusion in trunk. To be fully usable, however, users would need also the utility
shp2pgsql. AFAIK, this cannot be installed alone on windows, but apparently require
the installation of PostgreSQL and PostGIS (I may be wrong - I do not know Windows).
This is of course a major problem.
Could shp2pgsql be packaged in the standalone installer?
All the best.

Not that I'm aware of, and I've asked about it before. The exception
would be that you could manually put plugins into the python directory
inside of the install and not in the user's home. But this requires it
all be done by hand and you need sudo privilege.

Most plugins however seem to work fine in both and I can see why it's
not a high priority as it affects mostly just the developers.

Thanks,
Alex

>From 1.5 (or 1.6) it is possible to override the config directory -
this is how to use /my_config_dir instead of ~/.qgis:
$ qgis --configpath /my_config_dir

This will put/get all configuration into/from the specified directory
- also the settings which are typically in ~/.config/QuantumGIS (on
unix) or in system registry (windows).

Works with any ellipsoid. It depend on project settings.

IIRC our discussion at the hackfest, we have concluded that the best
solution would be:
1. implement PostGIS import from any vector layer in core library
2. use that functionality in PostGIS manager + allow multi-file import

This would avoid the necessity for shp2pgsql (pgsql2shp could be
avoided too, by using QgsVectorFileWriter). Moreover, this would allow
us to remove the buggy SPIT plugin, since all its functionality would
be available from postgis manager.

Sounds great, but:
- it means duplicating work
- it will to be kept in sync with upstream postgis changes
- it does not allow writing sql dumps, useful for users without direct access to db.
Thoughts?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] A feature Request: referencing layers or groups
	from other .qgs files
Message-ID: <4CEC2E4A.5090307@carto.net>

Hi,

I would like to discuss the feasibility of implementing a referencing 
technique in QGIS.

The idea is that in many .qgs projects one would like to share common 
layer definitions or group structures. As an example, almost all of my 
.qgs projects contain a number of basic cadastral data layers (a base 
map). I have to redo all settings again and again, including all the 
labeling settings, etc. If I want to do changes in the base map, I have 
to do it in almost 30 different .qgs projects. This becomes tedious.

Ok - some would now suggest: why don't you use a WMS layer for the base 
map? The reason is that I would like to use them as symbolized vectors. 
I would like to be able to snap to vertices and edges and query attributes.

So, the idea would be to offer a linking functionality from one .qgs 
file to another. A central .qgs file could hold all the definitions of 
the base map. Other projects could reference individual layer 
definitions, or whole groups. I think that XML already offers linking 
technology - so maybe we could use a similar mechanism?

What would be the complicated bits of such a linking idea? Would it be 
implementable with reasonable efforts?

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.

Probably the best of both word would be a property (trigger) that sums the
versions counters for a plugin.

Yes, I thought about a trigger/check that makes the "active" version unique
among a plugin branch (experimental and stable) but a version pointer from
the parent would also work fine.

I will be working on these topics in the next days.

Hi Paolo

We are still testing them as there seems to be a problem with plugin
fetching. Hopefully we can put the release announcement out over the
weekend. Juergen's current test build is here:

The plugin installer is actually a python plugin too. So if you didn't
copy the python folder inside your installation it will be missing.
See if you can find the plugin_installer folder somewhere on your system.


That's my best guess.

Not really - the import should work with any vector layer (e.g. kml,
spatialite, or even another postgis db) - so it would be a superset of
the functionality, rather than a duplicate.

I have the impression that postgis is backwards compatible, so no
changes should be necessary until postgis 2.0 - please correct me if
I'm wrong.

The sql would have to be generated anyway within qgis libraries, so
that's just a matter of giving the user a chance to save the dump
instead of executing it in the current connection.

The idea of loading all layers from a base project file was discussed here:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2010-September/009548.html

I think your idea of being able to select a subset of layers is cool
and could deal with the issue of rasters in a different CRS. The
selection dialog could mark those raster layers as being unavailable.

I would vote for option number 1, since it would be much more cleaner 
way as to convert data to SHP and than catch output of some third party 
binary (shp2pgsql). And it can provide much more benefit (like exporting 
all supported vector formats, not only SHP ...).

Also:
- 'shp2pgsql '  has some limits coming out of Shapefile nature like 8 
character column name ...
- in some cases, You can get different/corrupted data when exporting to SHP
- 'shp2pgsql ' has some bugs, You should always keep latest version
- I am not sure about UTF8 support in DBF in all cases
- SHP is rather obsolete format and in general it  would be fine not to 
hard wire  export feature to it

	idea to develop
Message-ID: <AANLkTinYY6pc68yd7Rops2JkQAorHDCtBGntpuGk+gLU@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody.
Recently I've found this very interesting and useful tool, at least for me.
I will propose two ways to improve the tool:
- The tool right now offers the user the possibility to select as many files
as he wants inside a directory. I propose to give also the possibility to
define only a directory that contains raster files (of every kind), with a
check box to give the oportunity to follow the subdirectories of the first
one.
- I think it's better to explain my problem and I think you will understand
the reason of my second proposal. I have directories with up to 2000 raster
files or even more. If you try the tool as is and if you select "add to
canvas", it takes several minutes to load and see the virtual raster catalog
(VRT) into QGIS, but if I zoom in to the right scale QGIS move the images
very quickly. What I suggest is to add in the dialog the possibility to
define the "scale dependent visibility" when the VRT is added to the TOC of
QGIS.
Thanks for you efforts.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikBbrC9gonzD9L63e+kN_JXpDuyWygB57U3bXgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everybody.
I have a suggestion about the thumbnails that are added to the TOC of QGIS.
Suppose that I load a GDAL Virtual Raster Catalog (.vrt file) that contains
2000 raster files or even more. In this case, when I load the .vrt in QGIS
(even if I have configured a good scale dependent visibility) it takes some
minutes to load. I suppose that the problem is that QGIS is generating the
thumbnail to show in the TOC (it has to generate the thumbnail from 2000
raster files). It could be a good idea to add a QGIS preference to allow the
user to decide if he wants to generate/show or not the thumbnail of every
loaded layer.
Thanks in advance.
Santiago Lastra.

Thanks anyway. (special thanks to Tim for opening my eyes)

I have this error too with the osgeo4's nightbuild 1.7.0-11, could you 
join DoGeometry.py as it seems I can't do a correct copy&paste with 
messing up the indentation :p

Attached is the modified doGeometry (with a few other bug fixes added!).

I've also committed this fix to trunk (r14758), so the next time you
update it should still work :-)

Why don't you stop the rendering? So you can set the "scale dependent
visibility"
range using the existent layer properties dialog.

Simply you can disable it either before you add the layer or while QGis
loads it.
Or maybe did I misunderstand?

Cheers.

Hi all,

I think you may reuse some code of the Load Them All Plugin [1] to
accomplish this.

Giuseppe,

I mean, the Load Them All plugin receives a base directory and an extension
(e.g. GML) to look for layers in the base directory and in its
subdirectories. It also loads those layers to QGIS by managing the canvas
setRenderFlag method to avoid an unnecessary waste of time in the process.

Regards,

Germ?n

the BuildVRT tool add only one layer to canvas. I unable to find the waste
of time
in cases like this.

Instead managing the render flag would be pretty useful in batch tools (e.g.
Translate).
Thanks a lot, I'm going to improve each batch tool by properly
disabling/enabling the
render flag while it adds layers to canvas.

Cheers.

The waste of time occurs when you call the add layer methods (either vector
or raster) several times and the QGIS canvas is refreshed once by layer, so
you can see every layer refreshing the canvas unnecesarily. For me it's
certainly a waste of time. Anyway, QGIS manages this in an appropriate way
by providing the setRenderFlag method.

As Santiago proposed, he'd like the Build Virtual Raster tool to take into
account files in subdirectories, so you can use some code of the Load Them
All plugin to achieve this, particularly the getFilesToLoad method in
LoadFiles.py. Of course, you won't load more than one layer, but anyway you
need to look for layers in subdirectories.

I'm just trying to help, if you find my comments causing troubles please
ignore them :)

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=S_n5nbn+H69C3j6KLOw7-EPaAnofW4Yz4aytK@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Android phones are becoming to be cheaper and equip with GPS and
Bluetooth. It is capable snapping of geo tag photos out of the box.
Mytracks app in Android works without 3G and Wifi connection (no
internet). You can get on for $159 (Android 2.2) - Huawei IDEOS.

http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=1559207

Probably someone can develop gps tracker python plugin  using Android
GPS (i.e. droid_gps.py) [1] to work with the gps tracker tool[2].
Droid_gps.py works with gpsd as well.

http://www.praetorian.com/blog/?p=291

[2] GPS tracker tool
http://linfiniti.com/2010/01/gps-tracker-tool-in-qgis-trunk/

Bluetooth gpsd connection to Android GPS would be ideal.

Anybody interested to develop  a plugin for this?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=Wwzz+pgeW0pVXx=1NYpg9BazSbg2vVL9CHdav@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Anybody manage to use bluetooth GPS device with QGIS GPS tracker tool?

Is the QGIS GPS tracker tool (i.e. GPS device port) capable of rfcomm
signal from the bluetooth devices?

It seems that there is no  rfcomm0 as option in the GPS device port? I
suppose Qgis is using gpsd.

Bluetooth and GPSD
http://gpsd.berlios.de/bt.html

Can I run gspd manually in terminal inorder to get GPS signal for QGIS
GPS tracker tool?

I managed to find app for Android phone (i.e. GPS 2 Bluetooth [1])
that make GPS acts as receiver for Google Earth and other desktop
mapping software.

[1] This small widget allows You turn your mobile phone to fully
functional GPS receiver accessible via Bluetooth. You can use any
desktop software like Google Earth or any other NMEA compatible.

Any suggestion how to get the bluetooth GPS working in QGIS.

Thanks.

hi 
  all above i have succesfully compiled qgis1.6.0 in xp using msys,mingw
compiler , the error which i said about the plugininstaller is successfully
solved by adding the files of python to qgis release packager folder while
creating setup.exe 
and its is working fine when i installed in another xp machine 

drawback of the created exe : 1) i didnt configure many drivers in gdal/ogr
library if you people suggest some ideas for that  will be helpful. 


Regards
Sunil

Message-ID: <20101125115325.M69911@lqt.it>

Hi All,

I've just finished merging the latest
SpatiaLite 2.4.0-RC4 in QGIS-trunk:

a) I've updated the 'internal' spatialite
   sources: -/src/core/spatialite/*

b) the most interesting new feature now 
   supported in spatialite is the so called
   "DB self-initialization": this practically 
   means that each time a new DB is created 
   from scratch, then the spatial metadata 
   tables [GEOMETRY_COLUMNS and
   SPATIAL_REF_SYS] will be automatically
   created. And the whole EPSG dataset will
   be silently loaded into SPATIAL_REF_SYS.
   So there is no longer any need to copy
   a template DB as in previous versions,
   because now a brand new DB can be created
   simply calling the appropriate APIs

c) accordingly to this, I've modified
   -/src/app/qgsnewspatialitelayerdialog.*
   in order to support "DB self-initialization"

d) I've applied the same change on
   -/src/plugins/offline_editing/offline_editing.*
   where I found another function strictly 
   corresponding to c)

e) after all this I've then removed any 
   definition of: qgisSpatialiteDbTemplatePath()
   because this seems to be obsolete and no
   longer required:
   -/src/core/qgsapplication.*
   -/python/core/qgsapplication.sip

-------------

question #1: do you foresee any possible
issue deriving from the above changes ?
[I've performed some testing and anything
seem to work as expected, but any further
advice is obviously welcome]

question #2: may I commit the above changes ?
or do you think it would be better waiting
until after the 1.6.0 final release ?

bye Sandro

I'll do the testing ASAP, but I do not see any problem in you committing 
the changes, so more people will be able to test.
Looking forward to compile it.
All the best.

Hi Sandro

These changes seem to be fine, please commit them to trunk. 1.6 is already 
branched off, so no problem there (current sources will be released as 1.7).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] select more than a layer
Message-ID: <f6c9ce29069b2c1b977a3544b8055acb@localhost>


Hi all.
I cannot find an option to select more than one layer. In principle this
should be simple, using the same logic and interface of the identifiable
layers interface in Project Properties. Am I missing something, or this can
be added?
Thanks.

I filed a ticket, see ticket #3254 [1]

The GdalTools batch tools already have a function to get all the files
contained a
directory and that function can also search for files recursively into
subdirectory
(as implemented in the Assign Projection tool).

Hi Paolo

I will have a look on it at weekend. My first guess would be, that this problem occurs, if you snap to feature that's not yet saved, ie. freshly digitized. So saving the layer before using trace edit may help. Can you confirm?

yes, this is due to a change/fix in the rubberband class and happens only with trunk (1.6 still works with cadtools). I will fix it on the weekend.

Hi!

> 2. created a win-build with OTB plugins based on r14713m


I would love to see this tools into qgis code! it is always a pain for
linux users ;) any chance to see them committed upstream?

Just one suggestion: all 7 icons of the OTB tools are placed in the
standard plugin toolbar, I would suggest to create a separate toolbar.


thanks in advance

Hello Paolo,

I tried to reproduce this issue on Windows machine, but there is 
currently only 1.6.0 and higher version of qgis in OSGEO4W installer, 
and I didn`t notice any buggy behavior.
Please upgrade to version 1.6.0, and let me know, if do you see any 
problem with this again.

I tried this also in 1.5.0 in Linux and saw another message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File 
"/home/pavol/.qgis/python/plugins/freehandEditing/freehandediting.py", 
line 158, in createFeature
     if not (s.validateGeometry()):
AttributeError: 'QgsGeometry' object has no attribute 'validateGeometry'

Verzia Pythonu:
2.7 (r27:82500, Oct 20 2010, 03:21:03)
[GCC 4.5.1]


QGIS version:
1.5.0-Tethys Tethys, exported

This is related with code adopted from C?dric M?ri`s traceDigitize 
plugin (many thanks to him) and probably I have to change the flag for 
QGIS Minimal version for this plugin to 1.6.

Thanks for feedback.

Pavol

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WPS-Client Plugin for QGIS 1.5 Windows
Message-ID: <AANLkTik_FCK06=b=gV=iyadyicGG4-EpCWzKZteSoAxy@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

Just made and attempt to install the WPS-Client plugin.

Got the following message:

The plugin depends on some components missing on your system. You need to
install the following
Python module in order to enable it: *ui_qgsnewhttpconnectionbase

*Is this already a compiled component that I can fetch somewhere?

My phase of QGIS is to get into some python plugin development but I am not
there yet.

My QGIS 1.5 is on the following platform:

Windows 7 Professional - 32 Bit.

I have been using QGIS 1.5 now for around a month using Postgresql 9.3
(PostGIS 1.5.3)
to manage my shapefiles along with successfully using a number of Plugins to
manage vector and raster files.

Gotta to hand it to all involved in the development of QGIS. This is one
fine piece of GIS management software.

Just curious, but are there certain camps in the QGIS community that favors
one GIS server over another? I am
leaning toward GeoServer at the moment but would welcome additional comments
from the QGIS Community
regarding WMS, WFS, etc servers to use with QGIS.

Again, congrats to all involved in the development of QGIS and I look
forward to getting involved with the list.

Regards,

Lenny

We modified all three measurement tools to work with unprojected data
in lat-long and automagically give numbers in meters etc (angles are
spherical), calculations are using QgsDistanceArea and based on ellipsoid
from project settings.
Handy for those who have rasters in latlong, but still want to get
measurements in meters/km2.

New measurements patch is in trac http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3240,
can you please have a look and review it. If all ok I can commit this.

Thanks

Just to clarify. I only compile OTB plugins for QGIS (this is a bit
complicated on Windows), they are developed by OTB community, so I can't
directly modify sources. But I will create patch for use separate toolbar
and send it to upstream.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python Plugin Repository - plugins app first
	working version
Message-ID: <AANLkTimZxg_HXGhEXq3cAVC-fiHQhdpEZ4rrQV6EjoLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've just uploaded the first working version of the new Python plugins
Django app.

Implementation is hopefully complete but it still needs testing,
authentication is also missing since it should be handled by an external
provider (ldap ?) but for testing as a logged in user you can log in through
the admin panel.

A few open questions still remain:

1 - metadata are read from the zip file on plugin creation and that is fine,
but what happens when a new version of an existing plugin is uploaded and
there is a conflict in metadata plugin's name ? Should the plugin name name
be updated with the new plugin name or just fail? I guess that updating
description is just fine but changing plugin's name it isn't, so I put some
validation in place to avoid name mismatch or (worse) having different names
in the DB and in the zip packages.

2 - according to specs, the users are initially untrusted and they cannot
publish their plugins. When a staff member grants the "trust" to the user,
he can publish all his plugins. Plugins have a creator and 0 or more
"owners" who can manage the plugin exactly as if they were the original
author. Common sense says that if a user i not "trusted" and he uploads a
new versions, the whole plugin should be unpublished (remember the published
flag is in the Version model)

3 - "last" version in the two "branches" stable/experimental i somewhat
tricky (and IMHO the name is misleading, since if "last" has to do with
time, the upload time should suffice to determine which version is the last
one). I did not put too much magic in the code and this part can be improved
for sure.

So, I'm not sure that the workflow I have implemented is what you had in
your mind.

I need your help in
* testing the application
* check the english strings (I'm not sure about them)
* ldap authentication
* styles: I've stolen the CSS from main QGIS site, ponies are warmly
welcome!

last note: the app was built to be "portable", so moving it around and
changing the routing (urls.py) should work without problems. I also resisted
to the temptation to use custom triggers in the DB.

See the Makefile for some useful dev targets and the docs folder for a (very
short) introduction.

Happy testing !

Hi all

I had a look at the qgis2google plugin. It seems a great addition and also has 
a good potential for the future ( <dream> full KML export considering legend 
groups as folders and possibility to specify extrusion values for layers or 
from attribute values </dream> ). 
Looking at the QgsKmlConverter class, it seems to me that single symbol and 
unique value from old symbology are supported. Are there any plans to support 
symbology-ng too?
Alexander, would you be available to maintain the plugin?

Didn't try the OTB plugins yet, but I heard it contains a very powerfull set 
of tools. Seems OTB has some additional dependencies, so optional compilation 
would be good for it (similar to GRASS plugin). And we would need a maintainer 
from the OTB team to include it into trunk.


Regards,
Marco

Now I keep on getting

The geometry of the feature you just added isn't valid. Do you want to use it anyway?

even if I digitize very simple (and valid) triangles. In fact, the cursor is always
green. Any explanation?

There are two explanations for this: It may be the same issue like
cadtools have with the rubberband. There was a fix of the rubberband at
the hackfest in Wroclaw. So I have to set up the minimum version to 1.7
or I have to add some backwards compatiblity. I just forgot about this.

On the other hand it is very easy with the tool to produce invalid
geometries. If you have a snapping distance of e,g, 20 pixels and your
snapping in the middle of a segment thats about 40 px long or your too
close to a vertex, the tool will snap some vertices that you are not
aware of it. This should only be true if you have set the snapping layer
to "vertex and segment". I have to think about, how to solve this.

The cursor is always green when working with traceDigitze. That's on
purpose.

Checked, I cannot reproduce it either (after upgrading to the latest version), no
idea why.

Right. Maybe snapping to segments should be disabled?
All the best.

I've just tried it - and it's great stuff, working very well!

I think log in / log out can be added now (just without registration)
- if I understand it correctly, once we know how to deal with the ldap
server, we will just switch over to ldap authentication backend from
the default one. Not having log in/out facility makes the testing
harder as it's not possible to log in as ordinary user (only staff is
allowed to login to admin interface).

Inside QGIS we make a difference between plugin name (user-readable)
and plugin package name (the directory of the plugin). We require the
package names to be unique. I think it will be good to add 'package
name' attribute to plugin model, strictly require it to remain the
same and update plugin's name from the metadata on updates. Does this
sound good to you?

I think a reasonable requirement would be to allow adding only trusted
users as co-owners of a plugin. In case someone is willing to add an
untrusted user, he can solve that with admins (e.g. mail them to
request setting the other user as trusted) - this probably won't be a
common case.

I agree that "last" version is somewhat misleading. So let's call it
rather "current" version (stable/experimental). My idea was that it
would be an attribute of each plugin which version is the current one
(and not to have a "current" flag for each plugin version). Setting
the current version should be thus possible e.g. in "edit plugin" form
using a combo box listing available versions.

I have various notes from my testing, mostly smaller things regarding
the gui which are probably not that imporant right now. Apart from the
log in/out and handling of current stable/experimental version, not
many functional additions/changes are required. One important missing
piece is a generated XML document of the repository which could be
used by the plugin installer.

Later I will try to give it another round of testing and write down
any issues (or even fix them if I find some time).

After some more polishing and testing we should be able to put an
experimental instance on the qgis.org site and once everything works
smoothly, ask authors to start migrating to the new repository.

Hi,

Wanted to ask if it would be possible to enable RSS for the SourceBrowser in 
your Trac, maybe not only for the SourceBrowser? (my main interest for now is 
with the SourceBrowser, but maybe there are others that want to also watch the 
tickets).

Best regards,
~lweberk

P.S. Congrats to the 1.6 Release ;). Thank you for QGIS!.

I don't know what's needed for RSS, but there are trac[1] and commit[2] mailing
lists.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposed enhancement: WKT field in delimited text
	plugin
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E06D0FBAC76@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

I've submitted a proposed enhancement and patch to the delimited text plugin to provide support for WKT fields as a way of defining geometries, as an alternative to using X and Y fields to define points.  

I find this very useful for creating small data sets from scripts (eg perl/python), where I want to display line string or polygon geometries.  Also it matches the data generated by copying features to the clipboard.  So features can be copied into a text files and then displayed directly in QGIS.  While this functionality is available via the OGR VRT virtual format, it is much easier to use directly from delimited text files.  

If this all looks Ok could this be installed into 1.7?

Thanks
Chris

Can you point us to a site that has an RSS on the SourceBrowser? I'm a
little confused about how it would be useful. As J?rgen mentioned it
sounds like the commit mailing list would offer the same service.

Thanks Martin for your comments, I will answer you tomorrow, by now just a
quick note to say that the XML view is already implemented, look for
plugins.xml in urls.py and for the correponding template in the plugins app.

Ouch, sorry, indeed you've done that already!

Hi,

There are new versions around of "PostGIS Raster"
(renamed from formerly known "PostGIS WKT Raster").

What's the status of your "WKTRaster Plugin 0.1"?
I assume it's rendering the raster values (e.g. from ST_AsBinary) -
not the polygons/geomvals (from ST_DumpAsPolygons), right?
Is there a chance to get it running on Windows too?
Are there other plugins?

Yours, S.

Right, you can still enter as staff then (while logged in) change the flag
via console or another browser, but adding django-registration is not hard
to do (I woudn't  waste time on styling though)

Ok, let's call them "package_name"  and "name", what prevented me to do so
is that AFAIK in the __init__.py file there is just one field (name). So, we
should read the "package_name" from the main directory name and the "name"
from the __init__.py ? A validation rule should be added accordingly.

Ok, what happens if a trusted owner become untrusted and uploads a new
version? It's a potential security hole.

Ok, I will refactor changing "last" to "current" and make the select.
Do you think the last uploaded version should be automatically marked as
current ?

Perhaps a last thing we missed is some kind of moderation/email notification
on new plugin submissions.

Ok (I'm cross posting to qgis-developer and postgis-users).

I'm still not sure if I did express myself clearly:
You say, that under Windows, there's no QGIS compiled against GDAL
1.7/1.8 with PostGIS Raster support?

What I finally dream of, is using QGIS to display the results of a SQL
query (either as raster or vector) against at least one raster layer.
This query contains raster constructors (like ST_Intersection) and
operations (like ST_Reclass; see
http://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/WKTRaster).

Any suggestions?
-S.

Hi!

Not sure how to get the list of pluggins. What I do is sending you the
output sent to the console, I assume that the offending plugging must
be one those that appear as "loaded". Tell me if there is a better way.
It's certainly a problem with a plugging, as I've just found the same
problem on a third machine running qgis 1.6 (ubuntu 10.04),
I've also started to uninstall pluggings, no luck yet. Just know that
qgis --noplugins works fine:

Hi Jorge,
Good news. The plugin wktraster is exactly a tool to connect qgis to postgis
rasters through GDAL and visualize the data.
Stefan asked about the processing. This is something the plugin doesn't do.
I've tested with a friend both qgis (with the plugin) and mapserver loading
postgis rasters. Both worked fine, and the only requirement is qgis compiled
against gdal 1.7.
I'm interested in updating the plugin this week to work as I've planned.
It's going to speak for itself.
Best Regards,
Mauricio
Ps.: Anyone willing to help and join this effort is always welcome.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Memory data provider persistence
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E06D0FBB42F@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All

I'm looking for ideas/suggestions/comments on the memory data provider.

A while ago I raised a ticket http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2487, the essence of which is that if you save and reload a project nothing should have changed, but if you have a layer supported by a memory data provider then its contents get lost. 

In the ticket I suggested that the user should be warned on saving, and the layers not included in the project file.  That way at least you don't end up with empty layers.

I'm now coming to a different point of view, which is that it would make much more sense to save the data for the memory provider into the project file.  Basically this would involve the following:

1) On saving a project, the data would be serialized into an element, probably in the map layer element in the project file.  For example it could be a <data...> node.  This could include the attribute definitions as well as each feature, or perhaps better the attribute definitions could be encoded into the datasourceUri.

2) On loading the data node would be read to repopulate the provider.  

Also useful, but not directly related to this, would be to enhance the layer "Save as" function so that when it is invoked on a memory layer the memory layer is replaced with the saved version, maybe as an option.

In terms of implementation I think this could involve the following components:

1) Add virtual functions to the QgsDataProvider writeDataXML(QDomNode &layerNode) and readDataXml( QDomNode &layerNode) with default empty implementations.  Call these functions in the QgsVectorLayer writeXml and readXml functions. 

2) Add a signal dataSectionDirty() to the QgsDataProvider, so that edits to the data in a memory provider could render the project dirty.  This signal would ultimately need to be linked to the project dirty() function.

2) Add serialization/deserialisation functions to QgsFeature, and QgsAttributeMap to read and write the data for a memory provider.  There would be a question with this as to how much to structure the data for "human" consumption.  Should the geometry be WKT or WKB?  Should the attributes be simply serialized into a QDataStream and then encoded into XML, or should they be dumped more intelligently as structured XML elements.

3) Implement the readDataXml(), writeDataXml() functions in QgsMemoryProvider, and fire the dataSectionDirty() signal whenever the data is changed.

I guess the main issue with this is that the project file would potentially get a lot larger when large memory data sets are added (eg Contour plugin).  But I think that is better than silently losing the work held in a memory data provider.

Any thoughts on these suggestions??

Thanks
Chris

I meant to just enable log in and log out without having to use admin
application. The log in/out facility will be needed also when using
ldap authentication.

But django-registration is IMHO not necessary right now since the
users can be added easily in admin area.

Yes, that's exactly what I meant.

In addition to trusted/untrusted users, we should add one more state:
blocked user. These would be allowed transitions:
- untrusted -> trusted (marked by admin when the author uploads
something useful)
- untrusted -> blocked, trusted -> blocked (marked by admin when the
author uploads something malicious)

Blocked users have permanently forbidden to log in and do anything. So
if someone trusted will get blocked by admin, he will not be able to
do any further changes (additionally admin will have to rollback some
of his changes).

Yes. Even better, in the upload form there could be a combo with
following options: 1. set as current stable (default), 2. set as
current experimental, 3. do not set anything.

Right, when an untrusted user uploads a plugin, the admins (or staff?)
should be notified that there's a plugin waiting for a review.

Ok, after a few minutes of implementation here it is. Now the plugin lists
the tables from the database and shows some of it's metadata. Now I think
it's fully functional. If anyone finds a bug , please tell me.

I have the SDA4PP plugin installed and I experience no crashes, but the
plugin is not really activated as it doesn't recognize that I have
installed the necessary R packages with synaptic (from cran2deb) and I
cannot compile them either. So I cannot really confirm or not if is this
plugin the cause of the problems.

I've been using GDAL 1.7 and postgis 1.5.1
Both postgis' windows and ubuntu versions are able to load the rasters fine.
We've encountered some trouble with what we believe is the "regular
blocking" issue.
wktraster's QGIS plugin and MapServer source were tested on ubuntu 10.04
with ubuntugis binaries.
Perfomance looks like a huge issue at the moment. I didn't investigate why.
I can probably take look back at this issue when I get back home to my
ubuntu box. I can't test on windows because there is no QGIS compiled with
gdal 1.7 for windows prebuilt.
This new gdal driver version was included in which gdal release? Maybe we
can recompile everything and test again.
Best regards,
Mauricio

As suggested by Giuseppe Sucameli, the plugin causing the problem is SDA4PP.
Is the tracking system for pluggins ready? I do not find a link to it
in https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/
or http://www.qgis.org/

Message-ID: <AANLkTimxFuv31ruvVvJOLZ2cbWyNc2HHXyvn73J6uHYw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I have seen there has been recent discussions about melting all the
different python plugins dealing with postgis into one.

I would like to have some info about this. Is there some roadmap ?

By the way, I find the different plugins usefull, but I really miss one
using the memory provider for vector layers for displaying the query result
instead of creating a table or a view wich pollutes the postgis database.
Perhaps I have missed this features, because all the plugins are improving
parallely, and it is not easy to track all the changes. Sorry if so.

Thanks in advance

Kimaidou

No need for the memory provider, have a look at the RT SQL Layer
plugin in newer versions of QGIS.

Yes, the main issue we found was the performance of display. So something
inside the driver is slowing the reading process done by qgis.
I took a look at the MODE option. It can be set in the user interface on my
plugin. I think that a combobox storing "Read whole table" "Read one row"
and "Read entire database" should pass the right options. Is it the real
interpretation of this parameter? Any sugestions?
Best regards,
Mauricio de Paulo

Great. I've included a new combobox on the ui. I'm going to implement it and
release as version 0.3.
Any other sugestions on what a "Load postgis raster" plugin should do?
Best regards,

Hi Martin,

all done, except the select in templates for plugin upload, but the same
functionality is implemented with checkboxes and sensible defaults.

I've also added some views and functions for a better user handling (block
an trust/untrust), there shouldn't be any need to enter the admin panel for
daily administration.

All staff users can manage plugins and other non-staff users.

Email notification on new plugins is sent to all staff users which have an
email set, can be easily extendend to send notifications on new versions
too.

Message-ID: <4CF556BF.9050608@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
If two different rasters are loaded, the clipper does not seem to work 
well: the new raster created is of the correct size, but all pixels are 
255: any hint?
All the best.

Is this feature request already solved?
If not, I would be happy with a free text input window for entering
SQL queries as an alternative for "power users".

Hi all.
Doing a simple:

dtm_interp4@1 - dtm_clip@1

consistently throws an error:

Error:
         GDAL Error 2: CPLMalloc(): Out of memory allocating -1024 bytes.

bringing down QGIS.
I have sample files available, if anyone is interested in replicating it.
All the best.

Actually the plugin was born in really speedy fashion. I think that at the
moment it speaks for itself as it's actually very simple.
I could test the UI on windows, if that's what you need, but to actually
read the raster you need gdal recognizing postgis rasters so only for 1.7
builds.
That's why i was able to alter it on windows. I can test the plugin part. I
can't test GDAL part.
QGIS is releasing a new version these weeks. I'm going to ask if is anyone
going to compile a windows build with gdal 1.7 or (with luck) 1.8.
What kind of demo do you need? I don't have a hosting for the plugin at the
moment but I can produce some ubuntu's screenshots (or even a video).
The plugin's fairly simple, though.
For the next request (a tool to process the queries), QGIS does have a
really nice tool called RT_Sql to execute PostGIS SQL queries.
I don't really know if I should bring a new tool to the application doing
almost the same thing with just different datasources.
What can be done is to talk with the guys who developped RT_Sql and check if
they don't want a little improvement to cope with raster layers too.

Anyway, there is still a mystic point for me: some processing returns vector
and some return rasters (and I don'nt think that's all). That's... odd to
cope with. I'm still giving some thought to it. I still need to read how
postgis raster processing works and gives results.
