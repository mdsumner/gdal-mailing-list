Hello everyone,

Please find below a report which details the progress made this week on the development of the plugin and feed website.

Merged PR for plugins website:

  *   [Deployed on staging] Fix plugin detail rating<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/359>: this is a fix for #354<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/354>
  *   [Deployed on staging] Add local timezone to XML<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/360>: this is a fix for #353<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/353>. The cached XML files on the staging don?t show this change because they are copied from the production. However, we can request a non-cached XML file, for example, https://staging.plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.36
Still working on:

  *   Update the design of QGIS-Feed to match https://qgis.github.io/QGIS-Hugo/<https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed/pull/72>
  *   Implement Playwright CI testing on QGIS-Hugo<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/179>

We will probably deploy the merged changes next week.

Have a great weekend,
Lova

Bonjour ? tous,

J'ai un petit soucis avec QGIS et ce, peu importe la version (3.34.4 ou 
encore 3.22.9).

Lorsque je lance l'application (depuis un Windows 11, connect?e en 
r?seau par un c?ble ethernet), j'ai la boite de d?marrage qui s'ouvre 
jusqu'au message "QGIS pr?t", mais celle-ci ne se lance jamais.
J'ai donc forc? l'application ? s'ouvrir en l?ex?cutant en tant 
qu'administrateur.
L'application s'ouvre. Mais je ne peux pas travailler sur mes 
projets/donn?es qui sont stock?es sur notre serveur.
L'application ne les trouve pas.

Avez-vous d?j? r?solu ce type de probl?me ? Si oui, quelles actions 
permettent de r?soudre ?a ?

Merci pour votre aide

Bonne journ?e

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] cache management on Github workflows
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+bTaEGmetuhjrM22xmy6wT5e613CpYPQo0=cN=ZRnBufA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

You might have noticed heavy traffic for the last 24h on the Github actions.

There was an issue in the former workflow and I took the opportunity to
clean up the situation.

I have moved to upstream save cache action.
Now, for all architectures and parameters, only the branch builds are
cached (not the PR anymore). This should solve the cache issues we had on
Github.
This means that the builds should be faster again hopefully for PRs that at
least don't edit qgis.h.

You might need to close and re-open your PR to trigger the updated workflow
again.

I'll also try to update the workflow in the 3.34 release branch (3.36 is on
the way already).

Sorry for the mess it has caused.

Have a good weekend,

Denis

Hi All,

FYI: somebody mailed us on security at qgis.org that we did not set X-Frame-Options HTTP response header on our website, which "... could be at risk of a clickjacking attack ...".

As this seemed an easy fix, we now set

  X-Frame-Options DENY

Please let me know if this is (or gives you) a problem somewhere.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsGeometry's .get() and segfaults
In-Reply-To: <230de7a4-a67c-4eb9-a642-93d9de22f3af@wheregroup.com>
References: <230de7a4-a67c-4eb9-a642-93d9de22f3af@wheregroup.com>

Hi,

Calling get() means that you get a reference of the QgsAbstractGeometry used by the
QgsGeometry object, but the QgsGeometry object (g) is still the
ownership of the QgsAbstractGeometry object (g_geom).

So, if you delete your QgsGeometry (g) you delete the owned
QgsAbstractGeometry (g_geom). And you would get quite the same issue if you
wanted to delete g_geom.

Best is to use constGet() and clone() your returned QgsAbstractGeometry
if you want to manipulate it independantly from its original QgsGeometry
owner.

Regarding detach(), it's because of a design pattern called "Implicit
Data Sharing" or "copy on write". When we copy a QgsGeometry, both objects are, under the hood,
referencing the same memory object (QgsGeometryPrivate d). When you end up modifying one of the object (moveVertex for
instance), you detach the modified object so the two are no longer
sharing the memory private object (hence the name "copy on write").

That's what happen when we call get(), we need to detach so other
QgsGeometry object would not be impacted by later modification of the
non-const returned object.


Hope that makes sense :)

Julien

 structure change
Message-ID: <408C4D84-BF60-46C0-B196-803AC8D4195F@itc-halle.de>

Hello everyone,
I have noticed the following: if I have read and write access (DML) to a PostgreSQL table, but no access to structure changes (DDL), then I can, for example, add new columns with the field calculator and fill them with results. Everything seems to run normally, I do not get a warning that I am not allowed to change the structure, the results generated in the field calculator are OK. After saving, all new columns including the data are gone. Can a corresponding preliminary check with warning be added here please?

If a new column is explicitly added, a message appears whose content does not match the situation.
"Could not add field 'Test' of type 'text'. Is the field name unique??
A warning regarding missing authorizations for DB structure changes would be better.

As far as I know, there is no QGIS ticket or change request(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues) to improve the user guidance for these two cases.

There are currently two relevant sections in the error messages(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/i18n/qgis_de.ts). 

 <message>
        <location filename="../src/app/qgsattributetabledialog.cpp" line="969"/>
        <source>Failed to add field '%1' of type '%2'. Is the field name unique?</source>

Message-ID: <444194319d7e08f0162c09ad281b56cd@carto.net>



Hi,

I am wondering if there is a ubuntu (or debian) package repository 
available with a relatively new gdal, LERC and ZSTD support? Ideally a 
repo that can be added to Ubuntu 22.04

I compiled things myself in the past, but it would be convenient for 
docker containers to install from binaries.

Thank you if you know some package source?

Hi devs,

I'm looking for a way in pyqgis to catch the (raw) queries that QGIS is 
sending to the PostgreSQL provider when a table is edited: for example 
the raw "INSERT ... INTO ...", "UPDATE ...".

Basically what the Development Panel is listing when enabled. Is there a 
way in pyqgis?

Cheers and thanks for any suggestion!

An experimental build of new GDAL and QGIS can be found here

This is fresh-paint new and needs some testing. A preferred way to test 
is to enable the UbuntuGIS repo, and then this repo on top of that. If 
people have the skills, please try and report back to UbuntuGIS mailing

ubuntugis for jammy has GDAL 3.8.3 (but lacks LERC support; but has PDAL
2.6.2).

Debian unstable has GDAL 3.8.4 with LERC support (but is not suited for jammy).

We have QGIS builds of the release branches and master for both of them
(ubuntugis and debian just the LTR branch).

Hi Matteo,

https://api.qgis.org/api/master/classQgsDatabaseQueryLog.html does have 
appropriate signals (queryFinished and queryStarted, both include the 
query) but it looks like they are not documented in the Python API 
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsDatabaseQueryLog.html

It *looks* like they are exposed though. So try


def?do_something_with(query):
 ? ...
query_log = QgsApplication.databaseQueryLog()
query_log.queryFinished.connect(do_something_with)


If that does not work, maybe the debugging panel itself has a signal you 
can connect to as a hacky workaround.

Cheers, Hannes

Hi Hannes,

so the only way to get the queries is to read what development panel is 
listing when enabled?

I also found GDALDatasetSetQueryLoggerFunc:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/providers/ogr/qgsogrfeatureiterator.cpp#L417

but seems not directly accessible with python

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Hi Brian,

Thank you for the info about OSGeo Live. We added both the 
ubuntu-unstable and the osgeolive ppa and installed the newest version 
of gdal from osgeolive (3.8.4).

However, these gdal binaries don't link against libLerc.so.3

I think I will have to compile gdal myself ... as J?rgen pointed out, 
neither the Debian-GIS route would work (incompatible) and the 
Ubuntu-GIS unstable repos don't integrate libLerc properly and compiled 
gdal against it.

libLerc is very useful for us for compressing highly detailed terrain 
models.

Thanks anyway, Brian and J?rgen!

Andreas

Hi,

Quick tip, you can skip the special commit to add the branch name by
creating a PR against your own fork.
I did that just now, all the CI is working nicely :)
Just change the "base repository" when creating the PR. No need to remove
the commit when the "fake" PR is ready.

My 2 cents ;-)

Hello everyone,

I observed a situation where QGIS Server caches WMS responses where it should not. The env-var "QGIS_SERVER_PROJECT_CACHE_STRATEGY=periodic" should ensure (to my understanding) that QGIS Server periodically checks for updates in the QGIS project when it is stored in PostGIS. This works for WFS but it does not for WMS.
This issue describes the details: QGIS Server: WMS does not notice changes of QGIS Project in PostGIS, but WFS does * Issue #56622 * qgis/QGIS (github.com)<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/56622>

Is this a known problem, does anybody have a hint how to fix or work around this?

Thanks and best regards,
Jakob

When I use setDisabled on either  action_widget_item.defaultWidget or action_item it sets the disables the entire icon as opposed to the specific action item found.  Maybe I am missing something.  Like I don?t want the user to be able to draw an Ellipse from Foci so I disable that, but it disables the entire icon of menus for drawing Elipses.

Hi Luke,

As you can see on the printed text, objects are QWigetAction, not QAction.
This is because you get each category of the tool bar, where then each one contains one or more digitizing QActions.
[cid:image001.png at 01DA6F01.9FA2FBC0]

Here is a snippet that can help you explore the tool bar:


sdtb = iface.shapeDigitizeToolBar()
for i, action_widget_item in enumerate(sdtb.actions()):
    print(f"{i}: {action_widget_item.defaultWidget().text()}")
    for j, action_item in enumerate(action_widget_item.defaultWidget().menu().actions()):
        print (f"\t{j}: {action_item.data()}")  # id like
        print (f"\t\ttranslated text: {action_item.text()}")

Le 27/02/2024 ? 04:10, Catania, Luke A ERDC-RDE-GRL-VA CIV via QGIS-Developer a ?crit :
Trying to get access to the button menus in shapeDigitizeToolBar.

from qgis.utils import iface

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidgetAction
sdtb = iface.shapeDigitizeToolBar()
i=0
for action_item in sdtb.actions():
    i=i+1
    print (f"{i}: {action_item}")

This prints:

1: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242801E98B0>
2: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242F9E43F70>
3: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242F9E590D0>
4: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242F9E9E1F0>
5: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242F9E274C0>

I want to access each button and the menus of the button so I can disable certain tools.  I need to get the text associated with the tools so I can key on that.

I can?t figure out how to get to them from QWidgetAction. I called all the methods on QAction that returns a string: data, iconText, statusTip, whatsThis and they all return empty strings.  So how are these menus labeled.

Thanks,
Luke

Hi Luke,

It works with setDisabled on action_item.
Be careful not to call setDisabled on every action of a category, then 
yes, it disables the entire icon.

Updated snippet for example:

actions_list = []
sdtb = iface.shapeDigitizeToolBar()
for i, action_widget_item in enumerate(sdtb.actions()):
 ??? if action_widget_item.defaultWidget().menu() is None:
actions_list.append(action_widget_item.defaultWidget().defaultAction())
 ??????? continue
 ??? actions_list += action_widget_item.defaultWidget().menu().actions()

actions_ids = ['rectangle-from-extent', 'circle-from-3-points']? # 
actions ids to disable
[a.setDisabled(True) for a in actions_list if a.data() in actions_ids]? 
# disable the actions

GDAL 3.8.4 is now in experimental ppa for UbuntuGIS (Jammy).
You need to have both the experimental and unstable ppa in your system 
to try this out.

Hi Angelos,

Thank you for the information. Will the new GDAL 3.8.4 also support 
LERC?

If not, then I'll wait until Ubuntu 24.04 which should already ship with 
LERC, according to J?rgen.

Thanks,

Andreas

Hello everyone,

Please find below a report detailing this week's progress. This week, my focus was on:

  *   Doing some maintenance tasks for the QGIS analytics dashboard
  *   Improving the playwright CI end-to-end test for the new website (QGIS-Hugo) according to #210<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/issues/210>. I?ve submitted a new PR for this at #205<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/205>.

Next week, we plan to deploy merged changes in QGIS-Django and QGIS-Feed. We will also perform maintenance tasks.

Have a great weekend,
Lova

Hello everyone,

Please find below a report which details the progress made this week on the development of the plugin and feed website.

Merged PR for plugins website:

  *   [Deployed on staging] Fix plugin detail rating<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/359>: this is a fix for #354<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/354>
  *   [Deployed on staging] Add local timezone to XML<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/360>: this is a fix for #353<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/353>. The cached XML files on the staging don?t show this change because they are copied from the production. However, we can request a non-cached XML file, for example, https://staging.plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.36
Still working on:

  *   Update the design of QGIS-Feed to match https://qgis.github.io/QGIS-Hugo/<https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed/pull/72>
  *   Implement Playwright CI testing on QGIS-Hugo<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/179>

We will probably deploy the merged changes next week.

Have a great weekend,
Lova

Hi,

just wanted to mention that I installed 3.36.0 this morning and happened to
noticed on that loading window thing that appears before qgis has fully
started it is calling itself a "release candidate". It's not the LTR but I
think it's now officially the point release and not a candidate?

Thanks to everyone contributing, especially to much more important issues
than something like this!

Hi Hugh,

This is intentional. Every .0 version is called a "release candidate". This
is because we found out that users won't test a new version prior to a new
release (as we initially thought it should be).

That's why we ship every .0 release of a new version as "release candidate"
- as a warning that users shouldn't use it for critical projects. It has
nothing to do with LT vs regular release. Also regular releases get that
label when shipped as a .0 minor version.

Greetings,
Andreas

Bonjour Lolita,

pour de l'aide utilisateur, le mieux est d'utiliser la liste qgis-user, 
majoritairement anglophone, ou de basculer sur la section QGIS du forum 
Georezo Francophone.

Hi Mike,

well, this is questionnable. One could just add columns during the 
session and save the table in another provider.

This should probably be only a soft warning and not something blocking 
those features.

Please feel free to open an issue with the tag "feature request". 
Implementation though will not appear by magic (sometimes it does 
though, we have some magic elves), feature are usually funded by users 
having this on their critical path.

Best regards

R?gis

Sorry for the late reply.

@Richard; Your advice is certainly useful. I could use some advice on best
practices :)

After *installing* GDAL, I was able to run cmake without issues. But then
make would fail at 56% every time (simply printing "Error 2"). By
coincidence I found out, that if I just ran the same make command one more
time (without cleaning), it would progress beyond the 56%, and run for
another 20 minutes before it failed at 64%. If I ran for a third time it
would progress a bit more (or maybe the output just looks different), but
still at 64%. Any additional attempts give no further progress.

mkdir build; cd build
GDAL_DIR=/home/velle/install-gdal-3.7.2 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
2>&1 | tee cmakelog.txt
time make -j4 VERBOSE=1 2>&1 | tee make_j4_1.txt
time make -j4 VERBOSE=1 2>&1 | tee make_j4_2.txt
time make -j4 VERBOSE=1 2>&1 | tee make_j4_3.txt

The last part of make_j4_3.txt looks like this:

Dependencies file
"src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/vectortile/qgsvtpktiles.cpp.o.d" is
newer than depends file

I don't see anything failing until the point it aborts. Can I get more
details about what is failing?



It took some time to find the VERBOSE=1 option, but even with verbose
output I don't understand what is going on. Is it

When you run "make -jSOMETHING" the error message may be quite above the 
end of the standard error stream. Look further above for a "error:" 
string or something like that. Or just? re-run "make", and wait for it 
to fail. The error message should then just be in the last lines

Hello,
How to change a plugin's owner ?

   - give my QGIS plugins user is not a smart inheritance since user name
   doesn't change.
   - Just upload a new version with a new plugin user (but can the plugin
   name be the same ?)

Impossible is not QGIS
Thanks for your help. I'm not in a hurry, just preparing future

Hi Jean
Great that you are planning for this - sorry I cannot help, but I am keen
to understand this process to write up for the QGIS AU blog.
Do you have someone that you are handing it over to?

Cheers

Hi Jean,

We can help, but it is to me not fully clear what you want:

- if you just want to change the owner of YOUR plugin: please sent me
1) the name(s) of your plugin(s)
2) your qgis/osgeo name/handle
3) the owners new qgis/osgeo name/handle
4) some message from old and new owner that they agree on this

- if you want to rename a plugin or remove one please make clear which one

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

To GIS Developers,

I am looking to the QGIS Developers community for technical advice, we are about to start an IT Citrix infrastructure upgrade to  new Win11 23H2 Virtual Desktops (VM) - All New Tech app PVS Images will be built on a Win11 23H2 Build base, the Citrix XenServer will be upgraded to the newest Hypervisor version (8.2 uses version 4.13.4 of the Xen hypervisor) with a Nvidia A40 enterprise GPU Card (for shared resources).


Subsurface Discipline
Software & Homepage:
CER Installed Version
GIS
QGIS (64bit/32bit)<https://qgis.org/en/site/about/index.html>
3.28.10 (Long term stable release)

Can the QGIS community provide any technical information that QGIS 3.28.10 and future releases will be supported within a Win11 23H2 OS operating on a Citrix hypervisor Dell Server (Ver 8.2) with an on-board Nvidia A40 enterprise GPU Card?

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Regards and Thanks

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Questions about PyQGIS Cookbook documentation
Message-ID: <79a0880052d9d.fcb7936712fd5@odyhpc.com>

Hello,
Firstly, I'm not sure if this is the appropiate list for questions about 
the PyQGIS Cookbook and I apologize if that is not the case. I have 2 
questions about the content for chapter 6 dedicated to vector layers (just 
for clarification I'm using the documentation for v3.34).
Q1 - For QgsCategorizedSymbolRenderer, the snippet details how to define 
the categories but it doesn't have a snippet detailing how to use the 
renderer. I tried following the snippet/example for rendering with 
QgsGraduatedSymbolRenderer but it doesn't render anything. Including 
something similar for QgsCategorizedSymbolRenderer could be useful.
Q2 - There is no discussion of QgsEmbeddedSymbolRenderer in the Cookbook so 
I was wondering if that might be included in future editions.
Thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GDAL processing algorithms issues due the
 default output layer extensions weirdly changed
Message-ID: <85db256c-9cfb-4705-99f3-cdfbacd0985e@libero.it>

I've recently seen 3 other reports from as many users [1] [2] [3] using 
QGIS 3.36 and QGIS 3.34 about the same issue which completely disrupts 
the functionality of the GDAL processing algorithms.

Maybe the fix could be to just totally avoid to use the "-1" value as 
the default for the "Default output [vector|raster] layer extension" and 
use the value 0 instead. I don't have enough knowledge of the settings 
logic to propose a fix, anyway I think it would be great if the 
underlying root cause of the issue could be fixed ASAP.

Best regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Process for approval of newly posted QGIS plugins
Message-ID: <014001da762f$08144ea0$183cebe0$@ziggo.nl>

Greetings,

 

There?s a lot of information and guidance around building and publishing a new QGIS plugin. 

But what appears to be lacking is some information on who is responsible for approving a newly posted plugin.

It is may understanding that newly posted plugins first need to be approved before they become visible to the community.

 

But it isn?t clear how this process is being managed:

*	Is there a focal point, taking care of approvals ?
*	What requirements does a new plugin have to fulfill ?
*	How long does this process take to be completed ?

 

I hope that someone can advise here.

 

Best regards,

Bart Duijndam

So this works but if the action I want to disable  happens to be the default action of the button it disables the entire button.

Also trying to capture what action the user selects and I tried

shape_digitize_tool_bar = iface.shapeDigitizeToolBar()
shape_digitize_tool_bar.actionTriggered[QAction].connect(self.shape_digitize_tool_bar_clicked)

but is never fired when I click on any of the buttons or select the menus

Hi Luke,

It works with setDisabled on action_item.
Be careful not to call setDisabled on every action of a category, then yes, it disables the entire icon.

Updated snippet for example:

actions_list = []
sdtb = iface.shapeDigitizeToolBar()
for i, action_widget_item in enumerate(sdtb.actions()):
    if action_widget_item.defaultWidget().menu() is None:
        actions_list.append(action_widget_item.defaultWidget().defaultAction())
        continue
    actions_list += action_widget_item.defaultWidget().menu().actions()

actions_ids = ['rectangle-from-extent', 'circle-from-3-points']  # actions ids to disable
[a.setDisabled(True) for a in actions_list if a.data() in actions_ids]  # disable the actions

When I use setDisabled on either  action_widget_item.defaultWidget or action_item it sets the disables the entire icon as opposed to the specific action item found.  Maybe I am missing something.  Like I don?t want the user to be able to draw an Ellipse from Foci so I disable that, but it disables the entire icon of menus for drawing Elipses.

Subject: Re: [QGIS-Developer] Access to shapeDigitizeToolBar menu's text

Hi Luke,

As you can see on the printed text, objects are QWigetAction, not QAction.
This is because you get each category of the tool bar, where then each one contains one or more digitizing QActions.
[cid:image002.png at 01DA773B.F4AAC8E0]

Here is a snippet that can help you explore the tool bar:


sdtb = iface.shapeDigitizeToolBar()
for i, action_widget_item in enumerate(sdtb.actions()):
    print(f"{i}: {action_widget_item.defaultWidget().text()}")
    for j, action_item in enumerate(action_widget_item.defaultWidget().menu().actions()):
        print (f"\t{j}: {action_item.data()}")  # id like
        print (f"\t\ttranslated text: {action_item.text()}")

Trying to get access to the button menus in shapeDigitizeToolBar.

from qgis.utils import iface

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidgetAction
sdtb = iface.shapeDigitizeToolBar()
i=0
for action_item in sdtb.actions():
    i=i+1
    print (f"{i}: {action_item}")

This prints:

1: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242801E98B0>
2: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242F9E43F70>

5: <PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidgetAction object at 0x00000242F9E274C0>

I want to access each button and the menus of the button so I can disable certain tools.  I need to get the text associated with the tools so I can key on that.

I can?t figure out how to get to them from QWidgetAction. I called all the methods on QAction that returns a string: data, iconText, statusTip, whatsThis and they all return empty strings.  So how are these menus labeled.

Thanks,
Luke

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] DefaultProxy and ambiguous wording in the options
Message-ID: <4d322bec-6d06-4344-a912-457faf2ae765@wheregroup.com>

Howdy!

Before I make a tiny pull request I better ask:

There has been confusion here because of the wording around the 
"DefaultProxy" and default proxy usage in Settings -> Options -> Network:

- Under the checkboxed "Use Proxy for Web Access" section there is 
a?combobox for the "Proxy type". The first entry is named 
"DefaultProxy", others are e.g. "HttpProxy" or "Socks5Proxy".
- Next to the combobox is a text label saying "Default uses system's 
proxy". This label is always visible. Grey if the checkbox is not 
ticked, as normal text if it is ticked.

There is some ambiguity with this:

- By default the "Use Proxy for Web Access" checkbox is not ticked. So 
this could mean that by default the system's proxy is used, even if the 
checkbox is not ticked.
- If the checkbox is ticked, then by default the first entry of the 
combobox is activated ("DefaultProxy"). Now it could be read that the 
default selection of the combobox, the "DefaultProxy", uses the system's 
proxy.
- Last, and that is my understanding, "Default uses system's proxy" 
actually references the name of the "DefaultProxy" comboxbox option so 
if the user selects "DefaultProxy", then the system's proxy is used. 
(Same outcome as with the previous one but for a different reason).


I'd suggest using the actual full name of the combobox entry in the help 
text: "DefaultProxy uses the system's proxy".
That would be a simple one-line diff in 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/71583dbc0cd33d85d036bcccef5991bbd2e3b632/src/ui/qgsoptionsbase.ui#L5015
It would be nicer to have a combobox entry like "DefaultProxy (uses 
system's proxy" in the combobox itself and drop the help text, but that 
would be more complex.


The confusion was worse in a local environment because in the German 
translation the word "Default" was localized while the "DefaultProxy" 
combobox entry was not. :o)

Cheers, Hannes

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS & field computer and unauthorized DB
 structure change (2nd attempt)
Message-ID: <66BAC257-C2C5-4E72-9D90-039B8931E80B@itc-halle.de>

Hello everyone,

unfortunately there was no feedback to my first request, so here is the 2nd attempt. I think the problem should affect many people, right?

I have noticed the following: if I have read and write access (DML) to a PostgreSQL table, but no access to structure changes (DDL), then I can, for example, add new columns with the field calculator and fill them with results. Everything seems to run normally, I do not get a warning that I am not allowed to change the structure, the results generated in the field calculator are OK. After saving, all new columns including the data are gone. Can a corresponding preliminary check with warning be added here please?

If a new column is explicitly added, a message appears whose content does not match the situation.
"Could not add field 'Test' of type 'text'. Is the field name unique??
A warning regarding missing authorizations for DB structure changes would be better.

As far as I know, there is no QGIS ticket or change request(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues) to improve the user guidance for these two cases.

There are currently two relevant sections in the error messages(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/i18n/qgis_de.ts).

 <message>
        <location filename="../src/app/qgsattributetabledialog.cpp" line="969"/>

Message-ID: <CA+yqJXi=y92KNJiSBh8-VmHq1r-xTEypTiuhjQ1Tf=s7N-rOOw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Subscribers,

How does QGIS leverage the computational resources of a computer system,
particularly in terms of:

?         CPU cores (main / main and additional) ? Does investing in the
number and types of cores significantly impact QGIS performance, especially
when the user will be utilizing QGIS for professional analysis?

?         Cores and RAM ? How does QGIS utilize both cores and RAM, and is
there a recommended balance between them for optimal performance in
professional analysis tasks?

?         RAM alone ? Does increasing RAM capacity alone enhance QGIS
performance, particularly when used for professional analysis?

?         CPU with the utilization of RAM on the graphics card ? How does
the choice of a graphics card with sufficient RAM impact QGIS performance,
considering the CPU's utilization of it, especially in the context of
professional analysis tasks?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards, Adam Wi?cko

Hi Adam,

Both, Ram and CPU, play an important role and you will see better
performance results. Which of the two is more important heavily depends on
the particular use case.
The graphics card on the other hand is currently only used for very
specific needs. It would be possible to further enhance this support, but
this would need investment into the software.

Hope this helps
Kind regards
Matthias

No, if the "Use Proxy for Web Access" is not ticked, there is "No Proxy"
at all

I think that we get the translation directly from Qt Enum. That's why
someone just added the help text just besides the comboBox I think.

Why not having a tool tip instead of a help text just besides the
combobox ? or at least remove the help text when you don't select
"Default Proxy" ?

My point is the ambiguity of the wording and what "default" might mean 
to the user.

The three paragraphs are meant to be potential interpretations by the user.

There is 1) the dialog having its default settings upon first open, 2) 
the combobox having a default selection upon activation and 3) the 
combobox containing something named "Default...".

Am I right that the text is meant to reference the "DefaultProxy"? I 
read up on Qt's proxy handling today and it does seem to work like that.

Changing just that one word would be a trivial PR. Changing logic would 
require me to compile and test and since I am very rarely doing anything 
C++ related it would probably be hours of work (and/or waiting). And 
then I would forget something and have to do it again :)

Cheers, Hannes

 graphical modeler UI and UX

Hi devs,

First of all, I am really glad with how my proposal was received last
month. Now, I tried to address all the remaining issues to finalize the
proposal

I'd suggest cutting back on the scope here. There's a LOT of work here, and
a lot of complexity. I'd strongly recommend dropping the extra "quality of
life" improvements


As Nyall and others have suggested I have trimmed down the proposal to
focus on essential features. Thus I reworked the proposal accordingly, and
shifted the planning to allow more time to handle the amount of new
features and complexity.

Something to consider in your UI designs is that there's two different
"types" of expression based values for parameters

An easy fix in the UI would be to have a drop down to select either
value input or expression input and have the button to open the editor
on the right of the widget.
I went with this solution, and updated the mockup accordingly. The
nodes ended up a bit more crowded than I would like, maybe there is a
more clever way to do it..

To sum up the mapping between old and new UI:

Value -> Exposed directly on the node  with an optional  "Data Defined"
Pre-calculated Value -> Drop down to switch to an expression then
exposed on the node
Model Input -> Drag & drop input socket
Algorithm Output -> Drag & drop input socket

Concerning Custom parameter widgets, I looked in the QGIS source code, and
it looks like the Gdal algorithms use them. I will make sure to include the
Gdal algorithm in test cases during the GSoC. Now if I understand
correctly, custom parameters are not currently reflected when used in the
context of the modeler (see for example the parameter 'Additional creation
options' in gdal algorithm is simplified to the default widget for
string).  How we handle them will also help solve the issue for non-trivial
input like the the "Fields Mapper" or the "Multiple Input Layer". I checked
in other software neither FME nor Unreal Engine(with a HashMap) display
this directly in the user interface. I think we can safely let them inside
the properties windows of the node/algorithm for now.

Care would need to be taken in handling existing models. I think the new
interface would have to be opt-in


I agree with you that we need to take extra care of existing models,
however I am not that keen to have the interface as an opt-in option. I am
afraid of the additional burden to maintain two systems alongside. I'd
rather spend a bit more time polishing the backward compatibility. For
instance, while the more natural flow will be left-to-right in the new
interface, the top-to-bottom will still be possible, and we can also play
with the collapsed version of nodes, I think we could end up with a rather
similar layout for most existing models.

Do you already have a mentor planned for this work?


I don't have a mentor planned yet. I could see multiple people interested
in mentoring a project to improve QGIS as an ETL. Ultimately I trust you to
pick the most appropriate person to guide me through this proposal.

Best regards,
Valentin Buira

Message-ID: <18d49be3-4067-4c24-9811-c777fafd137d@mail.shortwave.com>

I have a plugin that was working fine on 3.28, but not it no longer is working as expected.

The plugin loads a template project using FlagDontResolveLayers (for faster loading), then replaces the source of each of the vector layers, reload them, and then save the project as new project.

Now, in 3.34, to make it work, I had to remove the FlagDontResolveLayers, otherwise, although the layers sources seem to have been changed, when saving the project, none of the layers sources get changed and the final project still point to the template data.

Is this a bug? Or something intended, related to the fact that 3.34 projects now are much faster to load in the first place?

Thanks!

Hi Hannes,

Ok, I finally get your point, and so I agree with the ambiguity, it
would be better to have a label : "DefaultProxy" use the system's proxy.

But I think it would be way better to have translated item in the combo
box [0] with the following first item "Default Proxy (use the system's proxy)".

Regards,
Julien

May I draw your attention to an old PR of me:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/53424

In that one I proposed to set the default to 'Use system proxy", because if NO proxy defined all works, but IF proxy defined, it also works.

Richard

Dear Anita, PSC and devs,

Just to let you know that I posted my QEP just now 
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/295) and 
realized (thanks Julien Cabi?ces!) that the deadline was yesterday evening.
I'd like to tell you it's because I'm in a time zone where days are 36 
hours long, but short of creating envy, it's just poor memorization on 
my part and a preconceived idea that a deadline is necessarily on a Friday.

Sorry, I hope it can still be taken into account for grant. If not, too 
bad, "c'est le jeu ma pov lucette" as we haven't been saying for a long 
time, even in France.

Have a good deadline days,
Regards,
Julien

Hi Selma,
As usual we are all a bit silent, there is so much to follow. Your work is
much appreciated. Keep on this way ?

About transitionning to NixOs, you talk about your computer for everyday's
work ?
I've never seen NixOs used as a desktop main setup, mainly for getting
reproducible environment as an alternative to docker on servers. Let us
know how it goes, but maybe the jump from windows to Nix is high ?

Hi Julien,


I was about to closed the grant application form now. All proposals submitted through the form are in. (It's not an exact process since I haven't found a way to automatically close the form at a certain time). 


Unfortunately, however, I don't see QEP295 in the list of QEPs that have been submitted through the form, so I'm missing the grant request information (requested budget, proposal history, qualification, implementation schedule / plan). 


I'll leave the form open until tomorrow noon. Then I'll close it and send the final summary of all submitted proposals. 


Hope this helps. 


Regards,
Anita

Dear Anita, PSC and devs,

Just to let you know that I posted my QEP just now (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/295) and realized (thanks Julien Cabi?ces!) that the deadline was yesterday evening.
I'd like to tell you it's because I'm in a time zone where days are 36 hours long, but short of creating envy, it's just poor memorization on my part and a preconceived idea that a deadline is necessarily on a Friday.

Sorry, I hope it can still be taken into account for grant. If not, too bad, "c'est le jeu ma pov lucette" as we haven't been saying for a long time, even in France.

Have a good deadline days,
Regards,
Julien

inconvenience.

Hello R?gis,

Thank you for your response and interest in my transition from Windows to
NixOS. The change is indeed significant, but I didn't do it alone. Tim
helped me set up the system. The thing is, on my PC where I work every day,
Windows started causing problems with constant updates, and after one of
the updates, the system failed to boot. I tried everything I knew (it's not
the first time this has happened), but it didn't work, so I decided to
switch to NixOS. As I mentioned, the change is significant, but for now, I
still have access to a laptop that is still on Windows, so I'm combining
the two. And Tim is of great help, I wouldn't be able to make this change
alone.

Selma.

Hola Selma,

Lately, I hear a lot about Nix and its ecosystem. Good luck for your 
transition and interested on your feedback on daily use of GIS tools and 
softwares.

Regarding your (priceless) documentation work, will you still use 
Windows as a a reference operating system? Since most of QGIS users are 
stucked working on Microsoft's operating system, I think it's quite a 
good thing when then found screenshots and menus looking like their 
proper environment. And, to be honest it's a good thing to have an 
advanced user like you testing against a lot of QGIS features on Windows ;).

Julien

Hola Julien,

Your remark makes sense. I'll continue taking screenshots on Windows,
that's not a problem. As for using QGIS on Nix, it seems very good to me
for now, and I generally like the environment. In any case, I'll continue
to make screenshots that are suitable for average QGIS users, and I will
continue my work on Windows while simultaneously testing the Nix
environment. Thanks for your feedback.

Regards,
Selma.

Hi Selma,

Thank you for the excellent work with the documentation.

I was checking QGIS Server documentation and the WMS parameter TIME is 
not mentioned.

The parameter is still valid and WMS queries can use TIME parameter, but 
there is no reference to it in the documentation.

I think it was there some time ago, but I'm not sure. I can update the 
documentation, if necessary, but first I would like to know why it 
disappeared (if it was there before).

You you aware of such modification?

Best regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Hello Jorge,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I must admit, I wasn't aware
of the omission of the WMS TIME parameter from the QGIS Server
documentation. My contributions to the server manual have been minimal, so
I might not be the best person to provide a historical perspective on this
matter. Harrissou, however, might have more insights regarding this.
I see that there is an open issue concerning the WMS TIME parameter:

   - https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/7622

If you could, please open an issue on the documentation repository
detailing the need for the inclusion of the TIME parameter. An explanation
or example of how this parameter is used would be particularly helpful, at
least for me :D

And of course, if you're comfortable making the change yourself, please
feel free to do so. Either way, thank you for pointing this out.

Regards,
Selma.

Hi Selma,

Thank for the feedback. Seems like this TIME parameter never landed in 
the documentation.

I'll continue the discussion on top of the existent issue 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/7622

Regards,

Jorge

From: jea at hbaspecto.com (John Abraham)
Date: Fri, 29 Mar 2024 13:41:54 -0600
Subject: [QGIS-Developer] =?utf-8?q?USA_=E2=80=9CDisadvantage_Business_En?=
	=?utf-8?q?terprise=E2=80=9D_=28for_plugin_development=29?=
Message-ID: <CAPstF47xjVd_uNPqJ7BnyNw6uu0dgwJ81=9OCzxcLNhD2L4AoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greeting friends.

We?re bidding on a contract in California that has a small QGIS component
(plugin development work) and also has a goal for a portion of the contract
about to go to ?Disadvantaged Business Enterprises? which are businesses
owned by USA (citizens or permanent residents) women or minorities or other
disadvantaged people such as disabled people.

For this contract we need an already registered DBE ideally with a
California registration (although other state registrations may also
work).  But this comes up occasionally so if you might qualify as an owner
or consultant, or are working for a business that might qualify, I could
point you towards the registration process for the next time it comes up.

Please reach out if you think you might qualify this time or be interested
for next time.

Here?s some info about the program
https://highways.dot.gov/civil-rights/programs/disadvantaged-business-enterprise-dbe-program

QGIS has gained a lot of traction in the transportation industry so
participating in the Federal Highways DBE program could be worthwhile if
you?re a QGIS developer.
