Hello

I do not agree with the addition QgsGraphBuilder return id adding
vertices and edges.

The idea is that QgsGraphDirector clearly specifies identitfier of the
verteces and its coordinates. But, in the current implementation of
QgsGraphBuilder requirement coincides with desire.

Theoretically, you can implement child QgsGraphBuilderInterface that
constructs the object graph without a unique integer identifier. Or,
conversely, it throws coordinate information. But for the analysis of
these objects, you can not use QgsGraphAnalyzer.

In the version of QGIS 1.7 I used AdjacencyMatrix as a graph object:

typedef std :: map <QgsPoint, ArcAttributes, QgsPointCompare>
AdjacencyMatrixString;
typedef std :: map <QgsPoint, AdjacencyMatrixString, QgsPointCompare>
AdjacencyMatrix;

The integer identifier is not applicable to the type AdjacencyMatrix
and maybe in the future someone wants to create a similar object. It
would be unfortunate if QgsGraphDirector childs will depend on the
integer identifier.
For this reason, there is a double Identification of vertices and
edges in QgsGraphDirector and QgsGraphBuilder classes. By integer
identifier and the coordinates of points.

---

Still need to explain the following. If you implement child
QgsGraphDirector, then the correct implementation of the method
makeGraph () should be:

1. Add all the vertices from id = 0 to last.
2. Add all the arc with correct points identifier.

In reverse order reap QgsGraph get bad output.

Yes, it works now at various screen resolutions.

It might be good to have Popup window for the GeoJSON similar to Leaflet.

This SmartPopup for OpenLayers might work.

Thank you for your response, Sergey,

I think I forgot to say thank you in my last mail, as I'm actually very happy to have found your implementation of Graphs and Dijkstra already in core. It saved me quite a bit of work.

I adjusted my code now, so I'm constructing the QgsGraph without the help of the QgsGraphBuilder. This way, I can use the id that already gets returned from QgsGraph when inserting new edges/vertices there. Is your idea to keep this return value, or to also replace it with an id specified by QgsGraphDirector (or similar)?

Meanwhile, my main concern is an additional QVariant for edges and vertices. What is your opinion on such a parameter?
https://github.com/matthias-kuhn/Quantum-GIS/commit/4ed7759ecb4e3b495ca2c37a7ffcf291df537148 and
https://github.com/matthias-kuhn/Quantum-GIS/commit/ca472fa3321fc8ccb02a876a7e9eb669b04d0f89

Was your idea to put such information into the properties QVector that can be passed with addArc()? Would it be feasible to integrate this also for vertices in one way or another?

Regards,
Matthias Kuhn

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsLegendInterface implementation works only on
	top level items
Message-ID: <1346659209672-4999348.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to read and write an xml file with an hierarchical set of groups
and layer. So I've decided to write a python plugin that uses
QgsLegendInterface but than I've discovered that QgsLegendInterface
implementation is limited to top level legend items.
a simple xml fragment like this:
<group A>
   <my first layer with style informations/>
   <group B>
      <my second layer with style informations/>
   </group B>
</group A>
it is impossible to re-create inside qgis just because
QgsLegendInterface.moveLayer only works with <group A>.

The plugin should also be able to write an xml file starting from a qgis set
of layer and groups. But this is also impossible because of the limited
information handled by the QgsLegendInterface implementation.

Someone could say that I can directly manage qgis project files (.qgs) but
I've already done a lot of work to load layers and applaying the specified
style.

The goal for this plugin is to substitute a custom application for a
commercial gis viewer and continue to use the same xml file as
workset/project.

For these reason I did the following pull request 
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/217
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/217  that solves the group indexing
problem.
Then I would like to add a groupLayerHierarchy method to obtain a true
group<->layer relationship that will be very usefull to produce an output
xml file.

I'm looking forward to see some feedback/approvation before to go on with my
project.
Thanks everybody and best regards.

Massimo

Hi Paolo,

seems this is because of API breakage in QgsRasterLayer.
I'll look at this ASAP

It is easier to use.

Any Popup with do.

I have not seen it (i.e. Popup for GeoJSON table attributes) in your plugin.

OK. I got it. It has Popup.

Nice one.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WMS: disclaimers and tiles
Message-ID: <5044A5BF.6030702@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Currently, WMS layers are printed by subdividing a single WMS request (ok for display
on a video) into multiple tiles. This works very well, apparently better than in
several proprietary systems.
One problem, however, arises: if the server adds a disclaimer (copyright text, or
similar) to each image produced, when the map is printed the text is replicated for
each tile, thus giving an horrible result.
I do not see an easy and foolproof way of avoiding this. A couple of approaches could be:
- add a setting for overlaying adjacent tiles, so that one could choose how many
pixels should be hidden by the left/right/top/bottom adjacent tile; a bad hack, and
fails when labels are placed in the middle of the tile
- add a proprietary extension to the server, i.e. "WMS series": the client could then
ask the tiles as a series, and the labels could be applied to e.g. the first tile
only; this would not solve the problem for other WMS backends.
Any better strategy? Thanks for suggestions and thoughts.
All the best.

Hi,

This should not happen with new users of the cpt-city ramps.

Have you downloaded the new version of Color Ramp Manager?  cpt-city
file locations have changed, so you need to reset them in the color
ramp manager.

To get the "buitlin" ramps (a tiny selection for now), you need to
select "Use gradients that ship with qgis" in the color ramp manager
(this is default for new users).

You also have the option of downloading a more complete selection, and
also the full cpt-city package.

Thanks,
QGIS is now using 2x2 only if following condition is matched:

#if !defined(GDAL_VERSION_NUM) || GDAL_VERSION_NUM < 1920
      if ( strcmp( GDALGetDriverShortName( GDALGetDatasetDriver(

It should be working now. You might have to restart qgis after getting
gradients with Color Ramp Manager.

Hi Maning

There is already a html item in the map composer of the dev version 
(also using webkit). You may select 'add html item' and drag a 
rectangle. Then you can select an html file or a web resource (it is 
even possible to display a web page on the composer). The item can have 
several frames and thus go over multiple pages.

Regards,
Marco

Hello everyone, I am working to implement the auto complete in QGIS
python console.
At the time, I came to this result: [1]
Still a few things missing:
1) run command with multi-line text
2) styled text for errors, traceback, message etc.
3) fix up events when keys are pressed (keyPressEvent)
4) other minor errors.

Basically I changed the class QTextEdit with QsciScintilla using
pieces of code from [2]
and, for API syntax, the files provided by Larry Shaffer (thanks).

I'm having some difficulties as disable the undo/redo and I can not
use styles to the text (font, color, etc) if the Lexer is enabled!

Any feedback and help are welcome!

Regards,

That looks great already! Very welcome addition.

If you're thinking of tinkering with the traceback output dialog,
please consider some of the suggestions put forth here [0], which
include more complete frame info, like variables, etc. There is
already good sample code for this in the Django project debug output
(as mentioned by Martin)[1].

For styling purposes, it may be possible to output the traceback in
HTML, like with Django, then style it with CSS in a QWebView (see
Martin's initial response to my post).

Concerning undo, it looks like you can't turn it off, but maybe you
can just make sure its buffer is always emptied if it contains
anything instead? (not tested)

Qsci-object.SendScintilla(QsciScintilla.SCI_EMPTYUNDOBUFFER)


Concerning styles, some are set for the Qsci object and some are set
for its currently bound lexer (I assume you are using
QsciLexerPython). I believe styles can be adjusted either before the
lexer is applied or after (though you may have to clear them first, if
after).

For examples of doing this see Eric4 source here [0], specifically
__setTextDisplay() method for styling Qsci object at line #2156 and
here[1] for info on setting lexer style blocks. For the lexer styles,
you instantiate the lexer then override the styles you want using
their lexer-specific enum value as a reference (e.g. keyword, number,
operator, etc.) [2], then apply the lexer to the Qsci object:

lexer-object.setColor(QColor, 1) # for setting color of operators

If you change the coloring styles, I believe you lastly need to call
Qsci-object.recolor().

> Any feedback and help are welcome!

I did some research on QScintilla2 APIs and QGIS supported platforms
and their distros. I came to the conclusion that, at this time, the
QScintilla2 API to use is 2.4.5 (no higher). This supports as far back
as Natty on Ubuntu desktop, but is possibly even a bit too new for
some distros like CentOS. You can download the docs as part of the
source here [0].

[0] http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/natty/qscintilla2


Also, concerning the compiled .api files, it would be very
advantageous to have the Python 2.7 .api mixed in there as well (if
it's not). That api file should be included in the current source of
QScintilla2 ( <src-dir>/qsci/api/python or
/usr/local/Qt4.?/qsci/api/python/ ). Not sure if you included a PyQt4
api as well, but that should probably be based off of Qt 4.6 or 4.7,
depending upon current unfinished(?) decision on QGIS base Qt version
to support with next release.

I have most of these api files archived, if you need any. I have
tested the Qsci editor in QGIS with over 54,000 compiled api lines
with no appreciable slow down, though the list of possible completions
gets too long.

In my Plugin Editor plugin, I currently store a user-generated
compiled api file in ~/.config/QGIS_PluginEditor/python.pap [0].
However, if it were QGIS-generic, say, ~/.config/qgis_apis/python.pap
instead, anyone who uses my plugin or Eric4 can compile a custom
python.pap and place it in ~/.config/qgis_apis/python.pap to
user-override the console's auto-completion and call tips (very
handy!). Most Python packages (osgeo, for example) can be loaded into
Eric4 and have a Qsci-compatible api file generated.

Hello experts,

I am trying to port qGIS to my beagleboard i.e. a device with ARM cortex A8
processor.
Any pointers for that,??? or any help If anyone has already done that??

Hi Larry,
thank you so much this is a great feedback! (sorry if my reply is so short!)
I will carefully read your mail.....there are plenty of good advice!

I'll do some tests on the basis of what you told me and let you know!

All the best!

Hi all.
I find ohloh stats quite useful and interesting, and I use them often to show how
QGIS is going. And of course it is a pleasure to inspect them, as all major trends
are quite encouraging :)
The code analysis is now less useful, because of an artefact (lines count doubled
between April and May 2011, possibly because of the move from svn to git):
http://www.ohloh.net/p/3663/analyses/latest/languages_summary
Anybody know how to solve this?
Thanks a lot.

I use discrete quite frequently but wouldn't find it a problem if it
wasn't the default anymore. Just as long as it's available still.

we would miss our history, apparently because svn history was not migrated to git (am
I right?).
so the cleanest solution would be to add the svn history to git, and remove the svn
repo from the list. is this feasible a posteriori?
thanks.

Probably not:

 commit 40ef8c3ee6cab71708f830b24ab6decf7540aac0

    Initial revision

    git-svn-id: http://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk at 4 c8812cc2-4d05-0410-92ff-de0c093fc19c

I guess there are 3 revisions missing from history,
no idea why (in different branch ?)

I wonder if history not starting from revision 1 has also to do with ohloh
not recognizing the commit duplication.

Hi all.
Our next hackfest is approaching, and I still did not receive a request for support
from most of you. If you need it, please send me at your earliest convenience:
- if you need support for travelling expenses, with an estimate
- if you can cover for lodging, or request assistance for it (no need for an
estimate, as we'll stay at the Linux Hotel, and Horst will manage the bill there).
As soon as we'll have worked out a provisional budget, we'll send you the acceptance
of your request, as long as our funds allow it.
Thanks.

I'm happy to announce, that my first bigger request has been accepted.
It has been merged into master and I've just closed all the tickets
related to it.

As far as I can see, everything from the old "Overlay" implementation
should be available in the new one as well. As soon as a few people give
a positive feedback on we'll be able to remove the old implementation.

If you have any comments, I'll be happy to read them here and/or in a
bugreport.

Short list of important changes
- Printing works
- Diagrams can overlap each other (smallers on top)
- Histogram diagrams
- GUI has been reordered (elements are hidden when not available)
- Circles are scaled by area (option to switch back to diameter)

Cheers,
Matthias

Compliments, looks quite nice.
Agreed, fixed size seems unuseful, at least for histograms.
At a first look, it seems tha all needed options from old implementation are there,
so if nobody miss an option, I'd suggest to remove the older implementation shortly.
One minor issue: a variable should be selected also by double-clicking, not only by
clicking on the + icon.
Thanks a lot.

Fixed size is still useful for pies, I think.
Text diagrams are less satisfactory, as the texts are superimposed and unreadable
when zooming out.
Also, when zooming out I get very large pies outside my area of interest. I can send
you a picture if interested.
All the best.

one thing missing from new diagrams are proportional SVG symbols, but I'm unsure it
is really worth the while to reimplement it: opinions?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Better options dialogs
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-+N5p=enrRD+HCNRg6Vu0STdS3g-m5civDMYg9hUngQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been working on reducing overall clutter and excess space, and
trying to increase efficiency and extensibility, with options dialogs.

Problems with current option dialogs' parent QTabWidget approach:

* Tab widget uses unnecessary vertical space (bad for small screens).
* Tab widget limits the use of reasonably needed tabs for option
sections (avoiding tabs-within-tabs unfortunately trumps useability).
* Horizontal parent tabs limit how many option sections can be offered
(already too wide, without text truncation, on Mac).
* Horizontal parent tabs dictate the width of the dialog, causing form
layout elements to optically stretch too far apart.


Possible solution: Move 'tabs' to simple list widget on left side of a
splitter and have option sections loaded on right.

I have done mockups for the app and vector layer options [0], which
show the following advantages:

* Vertical height is maximized without sacrificing layout of option
section form elements (good for smaller screens).
* Number of option sections is not graphically limited.
* Number of option sections no longer dictates width of option section
forms (forms look much better).
* List item widget can have its splitter section collapsed to a set
size to show only icons for sections.
* Consistent look across platforms, with larger icons for sections.
* More current 'look' for v 2.0 without too much work.

Other than making the dialogs clearer and less cluttered IMHO, the
full useability of the dialogs at smaller sizes helps the user see
more map canvas when testing options with Apply.

Any comments or suggestions?

The version with only icons is optional, and is produced by setting an
appropriate minimum width for the list widget. If a user wanted to
size it that way, it is possible (and a saveable window state), but I
am definitely not in favor of it being a default. Thanks for the
input!

Hi Larry and Marco,

+1
I have the same impression as you.
Tabs to the left with captions. That would be great improvement.

Similar discussion was recently on GRASS list [1]

Robert

Hi,

+1 for having icons with captions on the left. Some versions ago we had
this idea already ;-) but with bigger icons.

see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:QGis_Load_mapcolor_style_-_01_properties_window.png

Things are coming and going and coming back, it seems.

The idea is that you should not edit QgsGraph object :-) . Probably I
will not add the properties top. New functional is not a big problem
for me, but I do not know why it.

If you create an object without using QgsGraph QgsGraphBuilder
QgsGraphDirector then a good idea to use other libraries to analyze
graphs. For example, bgl [1] or NetworkX [2]. And I use the builder
pattern [3], so you can use the algorithm analyzes the vector layer
(QgsLineVectorGraphDirector object). I spent a lot of time debugging.

Currently I work of full-feature network and surface cost analysis
plugin, but I will not use more than the shortest path and minimum
spanning tree.

Thanks.

Well now, that looks familiar!  :^)

I pulled the .ui file from 1.6 branch and loaded into Designer. Couple
of differences between my layout and that one.

* Has no scroll areas for option sections
* Icons too big @ 64x64 for desktop use (IMHO, it even makes them look
a little garish)
* No splitter, though not really useful for that layout style
* Unnecessary padding

Basically, though, the overall concept is the same. Icons could be set
to any reasonable (or device-specific) size in the new layout via a
pref.


Little background on why I started looking into this today...

No offense to Matthias here, but I find the toolbox approach used in
that layout to be unnecessarily confusing, with too much hidden. A
couple of tabs with scroll areas and group boxes would not only match
other layouts, it would work in a smoother fashion (click-scroll).
Toolboxes look OK on Ubuntu, but not so nice on Mac (Qt's default
toolbox approach is also very uncommon on Mac). When a developer has
to forgo an obvious GUI choice for good organization of options, it
says to me that the parent control widget should be looked at for a
fix, especially if there are other added benefits.

Matthias should be able to layout the options for Diagrams in a way he
feels is appropriate, relative to the new functionality of Diagrams
and general HIG, or users may get confused.

While not using tabs within tabs is a good call, the more complex QGIS
becomes, the more the possibility of nesting of options and controls
will become an issue. Nesting the *same* kinds of control widgets
should be avoided. Mixing it up graphically, if nesting is required,
should be considered, as well as approaches to parent control widgets
that do not limit the GUIs of their children.

Hi Larry,

Obvious there are some improvements now over the 1.6 version.

We appreciate the excellent work you do for us!

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Larry,

+1 for vertical tabs.

In my opinion, vertical tabs provide an intuitive way of choosing the main category of interest, that uses the 2 dimensions on a screen better than horizontal tabs which expand foremost in one direction (The height of vertical tabs is smaller than the width of horizontal tabs).
Apart from that it leaves the horizontal tabs to the second-level dialog (diagrams in my case).

Some GUI's even use a tree widget to choose the main category (e.g. eclipse options). I would not prefer such an approach as it distracts the user and hides options he might be looking for. Just to have that one mentioned as well

I was actually thinking about the same thing but then told that the idea had been dismissed earlier (the one from 1.6)

Regards
Matthias Kuhn

Hi Larry,

as already was mentioned in this thread similar design of options dialog
was used several versions ago but then we switched to tabs. List widget
only with icons IMHO not user friendly, especially for newcomers.

If icons will be with captions we again come to initial problem for translators:
translating some text when listbox is used is a real pain in some languages.
I think Jean-Roc Morreale can explain all problems for translators better.

	transformation?
Message-ID: <1346915644405-5000110.post@n6.nabble.com>

Since 0.7 (?) we have included OTF transformation. In the beginning, the code
was a bit buggy :-), and I believe that was one of the main reason for
turning it off. Now, it's more stable. So, hwat is the reason for being able
to turn it off now?

1) Some use-cases handles 'raw' data where a CRS is not meaningful (or maybe
unknown even).
2) To skip the OTF code for stability.
3) To skip the OTF code for speed.

Measruement tools uses OTF code to be able to calculate on an ellipsoid.
Currently, when OTF is off, we don't allow that but usees planimetric
calculation only. Is this correct do you think?

Magnus

My problem is the following: I have a layer containing the nodes and another layer (actually even a combination of two layers) containing the edges. They are connected by data definition and not only/necessarily geometry. Each node has some properties which are saved as attributes in the node layer.
If I can store a reference (feature id) to the node in the vertex on the graph I can access all these properties when iterating over a found shortest path. This can be useful e.g. if you want to draw a height profile of this path.

I like to minimize dependencies and your library already fits my purpose pretty well :)

I can stick to the builder pattern and write my own Director / Builder for this.
But I can only do this, if I am able to store at least one additional reference in QgsGraphVertex.

I will definitely leave it for pies and text diagrams.
For text diagrams it is the users responsibility to make sure that he
defines an appropriate minimum size (Smaller diagrams can be scaled or
hidden)
Of course it would be possible to check for every text if it fits into
its field. What do you think is the best way to go if it exceeds its
space?

For reference: Your bug
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6312

A question to this picture. What attributes did you assign. Because this
horizontal line in every pie should have been removed.

I guess the symbology implementation is more meaningful. I mentioned it just for
completedness, and to make sure I was not missing the point.
Thanks.

not quite sure about it.

The lie is actually a variable, much smaller the the other one, but this does not
matter (I used random variables, just to see how the diagrams work).
BTW, I do not see small pies to superimpose on the larger ones, as expected. Am I
missing something?
Thanks.

Thanks for the input. Might you be referring to
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/2202 ?

My proposed layout does not have that issue. The one for 1.6 used
large icons with text that was center-justified and wrapped
underneath, but had no means of increasing the overall width of the
widget by the user. It appears the larger icons were to aid in that
problem, but weren't enough for longer translations.

In my layout, the use of a splitter, whose state can easily be saved
to QSettings, allows for the width of the list widget to customized
(and stay that way) for users of different locales. I have 3 more
mockups to illustrate this [0]:

app-options_nowrap.png - Shows how the splitter can be moved to view
the whole option set label (note French substitution for Map Tools).
Expanding the left column like this, while possible, uses more
horizontal space than necessary. Horizontal scroll bar is still
available.

app-options_wrap.png - Shows the QListWidget's word wrap helping save
some horizontal space. This is with 32x32 icons, which I would
consider the largest for desktop (as with QGIS tool bars). Even larger
icons could be user-/config-set for touch screens.

Given the improved layout over v. 1.6's, I foresee no issues for translators.

> ... List widget
> only with icons IMHO not user friendly, especially for newcomers.

app-options_tooltip.png - Shows the collapsed splitter, with only
icons and tool tips. This is an optional user-adjusted (or possibly
button-enacted) view where the list widget's minimum width is set to
the width of the chosen icon size + some padding (with scroll bar
taken into account, if shown). This is not a default, which would not
be so nice for new users, as you noted. However, also note that with
this icon-only, space-saving view a user is not being presented with
anything less user-friendly than the many tool bar icons in the main
interface, which do not have any labels at all, only tool tips.

Right, this is one of the problems. Not sure if there were others.

Great, then looking forward for this new desing in QGIS. Thanks for

Hi Larry.

I think it's a great improvement. In addition, I wonder if it would
make sense to have the text below the icons (perhaps as an option), in
order to save some horizontal space.

Have you tried that?

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

Message-ID: <CA+TxYvOLqPbsmfPxtsgSDaMxoLGGjM1zf-eB8JSyjgazRMdLuA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Presently when building debian packages, following the instructions in
the INSTALL file, "make Experimental" is run, which adds a lot of time
to the build process and can be problematic when not connected.

How can we tweak the debian rules (or better yet, the build
commandline) to skip "make Experimental" when building packages?

regards,
Etienne

I see 2 problems that result from automatic test execution

- it seems that qgis is built TWICE (at least when first run), after
normal build "make Experimental" builds everything again (without
normal console output). Is this the desired behavior?
- qgis_wcsprovidertest hangs when there is no internet connection (or
if connection is flaky), but at least bails out after 3 minutes
- also submission to cdash can take a long time when internet is not
available, as it tries 4 times to upload
- .deb files are built after lengthy tests

As a result it takes a really long time to have built .deb files available.

IMHO it would be better to skip the tests, unless an option is given
or an environment variable is set. At least allow to skip it in an
easy way.

regards
Etienne

Hi Etienne,  I never build a package, so no idea how it works.
but the equivalent (IIRC) of make Experimental without the cdash upload
is make Test

Hello, I encountered the same problem with my QGIS. The shape is loaded
anyhow, however every time one tries to manipulate or the cursor hits a
layer, this messages is send and one has to confirm it with the 'OK'-button.

Guus van den Berg

The "standard" option is:

DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck dpkg-buildpackage ...

You can also set DEB_TEST_TARGET to invoke an other test target (e.g. the
nightly builds run Nightly instead of Experimental).

Message-ID: <CALCNqkaf8V+92zQDXD9h7-F8LcvRf0DExO3YY-qJ3xBTGm8iPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

In ancient Greece a young couple was sitting by the river, the young
man gazing at his reflection in the water. The young lady sitting with
him, looking a little worried, said 'Tell me Narcissus, is there
someone else?'.....

There has never been a better time to become addicted to making our
own code robust and beautiful than test friday! We now have nearly 40
tests, each one reducing the chance that something will break in the
future without us realising it, and reducing the chance that we ship
QGIS 2.0 with broken features without realising it!

If you would like to contribute a test, just send us a github pull
request or send me your patch, all tests will be gladly accepted!

Regards

Tim

I am unable to compile the latest QGis, I guess this is the same issue? 
(I am using ArchLinux)

Hi

+1 from me to go back to the left if you can manage the issues as
mentioned by Alex. On a more general note, we need to make an effort
to compartmentalise advanced options away from simple ones and I would
really like to see a new QgsPropertyList widget which behaves
similarly to QtDesigners property lists, especially for places where
we have reams of options. If we implement QgsPropertyList it should
make these kind of refactorings 'DRY*' in the future.

* DRY == dont repeat yourself

 Hi,

 Probably, some day in the future, it would be great if we can have a 
 search function. Users could search for a function, menu entry, 
 setting/option or maybe even plugins from the central repository that 
 hadn't been installed in the system.

 As more and more options appear it is hard to find them, but usually 
 one knows what to search for (e.g. merge shapes or snap options) - of 
 course such a search function would have to be a bit "tolerant".

 The idea is a bit similar to the HUD of the new Ubuntu unity version, 
 see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/HUD

 Maybe something for next Google summer of code?

 Just an idea for the medium to long-term future.

 Andreas

 Hi,

 I am wondering about the costs for the Linuxhotel accommodation - the 
 Wiki Page 
 (http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/8_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Essen_2012) 
 - talks about "special conditions".

 Otto or Horst, can you please clarify?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

Yes wonderful idea - and again something we can realise by building
our own configuration management gui and backend classes.

Hi all.
Moreover, several links are broken. Are the authors interested in updating it?
I can help if useful.

Hi all,
after the precious Larry's advice, I made ??some changes to the
console for highlighting styles and traceback one, few things [1] !
Currently lacks only the insertion of text from "mimeData". [2]
Rigth now I'm very busy and I cannot seem to implement additional
features suggested by Larry, I hope in the future I will!

After introducing mimeData stuff, I'll clean the code and then share it!!

Greetings!

Hi Jurgen,

1)
thanks for the explanation. I think that default test should be "make
test", instead of "make Experimental" for the 2 issues I mentioned

- seems that package is built twice - can you confirm this?
- very lengthy if internet connection is flaky or gets lots during the build.

Is there a way to configure which test is run from the commandline, or
is that configurable only in the debian/rules file?

2)
I am also having another issue, it seems the "parallel=n" option for
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS has no effect, but adding -j4 to dpkg-buildpackage
works as expected.

3)
Also, if I  re-run the build process with tests enabled, but keeping
build directory intact it doesn't do any tests... is this normal?
i.e. dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -nc

Do I have to rebuild everything (without -nc option) when I want the
tests to run ?

4)
An lastly, when building packages for oneiric I get an unmet
dependency for debhelper (>= 9), but it's not available for oneiric.

Am I missing a configuration option somewhere to get it to recognize
I'm using oneiric?
Solution is to add "-d" option but that's not very clean.

$ dch -l ~oneiric  --force-distribution --distribution oneiric "oneiric build"

$ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="nocheck" dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -nc
dpkg-buildpackage: export CFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags (origin: vendor): -g -O2
dpkg-buildpackage: export CPPFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags (origin: vendor):

OK. Probably next week I will commit the revisions for the app options
dialog, which can then be tested and critiqued, before doing any
changes to other option dialogs (vector, raster).

This would be an interesting approach, though I see a couple of concerns.

* In QtDesigner, intrinsic input is validated, but not functional logic
* Not all options may graphically fit into a property-list style

Explanation: Designer's Property Editor widget works very well for the
parent-child tree of widget objects' properties; but, short of input
validation, it doesn't care if you input value that won't work (I seem
to do that a lot :^). All relevant object properties are shown and
always editable. There appears to be no functional option-choosing
logic, like when a user selects a radio button or check box and
another part of the GUI become disabled, etc. I guess if a MVC
approach were taken, it might be possible to develop a setup where the
shown widgets (complex view) in an options dialog were decided by a
controller, where you can define the functional logic and handle
filtering for sets (models) of project- and app-level preferences.

Sounds like a fair bit of work that would definitely help create a DRY
design, help devs, but possibly, in the end, not be much different to
the user, since the GUI stills needs the functional option-choosing
logic. Would be very nice to have more of a MCV setup to work with.


In the meantime, maybe we can start with something graphical that
directly relates to the user. Etienne recently introduced collapsible
groupboxes, which he used in the raster Save As... dialog [0]. The
custom widget currently doesn't work right, with some graphical
issues; but, once functioning properly across all platforms, it should
be IMHO a much better solution to hiding sections, like Advanced
options, and a viable replacement for interfaces usually handled by
toolboxes.

I find the latter to be very good thing. Toolboxes are a poor GUI
choice because they force the user to hide one associated option set
in order to see another. The collapsible groupbox would fit nicely in
a side-tabs->tab widget-w/ scroll areas->multi-groupbox layout. It
would overcome the main issue with that layout choice, excessive
scrolling.

However, with Etienne's collapsible groupbox, there appears to be an
if-opened-then-its-enabled approach. I feel the opening/disclosing the
groupbox should be separate from whether its title checkbox is
checked.

Same here, when loading a shp, I get the message, but then everything

I've just pushed an update to QgsCollapsibleGroupBox which should
solve UI issues.

Basically, I swap the checkbox primitive element for a right/down
arrow primitive, using a custom QProxyStyle class. Turns out it's easy
- when you know the tricks.

I have tested this using Linut Mint 12 with Cinnamon, Mate, KDE using
various QGis themes.

I would appreciate feedback on the UI from various platforms /
environments (gnome, kde, unity, windows, osx) etc.

If anything looks funky please send me an email with environment
details and a screenshot (off-list)

I am not decided yet on how this should work. From an implementation
perspective, it's much easier to show/hide the groupbox contents when
the
groupbox is checked/unchecked.  From a UI perspective, the idea is to
draw an arrow (right/down) in the space normally reserved for the
checkbox.

Now would we like an arrow (to show/hide the groupbox) plus a checkbox
(to enable/disable the feature) is up for discussion.

Functionally, when a groupbox is hidden its elements are disabled (by
nature), but that doesn't mean any changes to the values are not
available.
Let's say you change the extents, then hide the extents box - the
changes should be effective. For other elements in the raster save as
dialog (say the create options), not filling in anything has no
effect, so why add a checkbox for it?

I don't see that having an extra checkbox would be necessary in most
cases.  Also it might look a bit weird if you have some groupboxes
with checkboxes and some without - the titles will not be aligned.

If a UI guru is willing to step in to implement that, then it might be
possible - but I don't see how to do it easily. You have many
different styles to accommodate, that might require a lot of tweaking.

Message-ID: <504AF049.3010306@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi Marco, all,
today working on a python plugin using QGIS master I got
AttributeError : 'QgsRasterLayer' object has no attribute 'rasterShader'
and I tought bizarre it works on lisboa, then I thoug ahhhh raster
redesign and Api breakages.

So I went to [0] to see what changed, but nothing was mentioned. the I
looked in the api doc and of course rasterShader() is not there anymore.
So I went to the qgsRasterLayer.sip file and git log it to see when all
disappeared. now I put a small comment in the api breakage page about
the commit that removes some methods.

I'm I missing something? is this not what we define an API change? if it
is It would be nice to have commit [1] (and maybe others part of raster
redesign) documented and maybe with examples for alternatives.

ciao
Marco

Yes, it is the new plugins polyg4qgis and pLine4qgis that cause this error.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis Server and Python. Which solutions to have a
	python API?
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=z1eyXMf8qgqWivwjHaZFQ68KPQb2Rd=ubG5jpyRND81g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a project to port qgis-web-client under Django, witht the
aim to build a Qgis Server web based manager and extended service provider.
We've already implemented a basic structure, with a proxy (a Django view)
to intercept the calls to qgis_mapserv.fcgi, and a view/template to expose
the qgis-web-min.

We would like to work as we used to do with Mapserver mapscript, to be able
to have full control of the requests/responses flow, e.g. to implement
authentication on specific services, requests and layers. We also would
like to manage project options inside Django models. All these kind of
things would be easy to implement if there were some kind of python
bindings for Qgis Server. (PS: in this moment we do it controlling the
query variables passed to the fcgi and filtering the fcgi requests....)

I see that qgis_mapserv.fcgi's code is statically linked in a monolithic
fcgi executable, so it isn't possible to offer specific functionalities
(e.g. project parsing) to external libs. To expose classes and methods we
would need a version of qgis server's code made by dynamic libraries. Would
it be possible?
Otherwise, which solutions would you suggest to build a Qgis Server Python
API?

I premit that we're considering to sponsor its development.

Have a nice weekend,
Giovanni

Hi Marco

Thanks for the notification. Seems there are some api changes which have 
been forgotten on the wiki page. I'm going to update the page, but it 
could take a bit longer because I'm travelling the next two weeks.

>and of course rasterShader() is not there anymore


In master branch, use QgsRasterRenderer::rasterRenderer() to get/set how 
a raster is displayed.

Regards,
Marco

No, the package files are only built once.

But debian/control is rebuilt on each build and that causes the build in front
of the tests to actually run the qgis make.  But on the second run everything
is already in place therfore nothing is actually compiled twice.

The idea is to get as many (uploaded) test results as we can.

You can specify add ctest(1) arguments in ARGS, ie.

ARGS="-R qgis_distanceareatest" dpkg-buildpackage...

an only that test is run.

Implemented in e8a938a0 now.

Not sure.  A touch CMakeLists.txt probably helps.

That's was the expected way.  But you can override DISTRIBUTION now directly.

Because the checkbox itself is a parent control, and obviously
functions that way in QtDesigner. It can and is used as a master
on/off toggle for those sets of options, not just graphically, but in
code, often for saving as a master trigger in QSettings (e.g. should
the buffer be drawn or not?).

Not having one with the title would require an *additional* master
checkbox control (if that function is needed) inside the groupbox that
takes the place/function of the repurposed title checkbox. Why cover
up a perfectly reasonable, heavily used control?

The titles are already misaligned if you have some groupboxes with
title checkboxes and some without.

I think the collapsible groupbox has a lot to offer across many
dialogs in the app. After sending you the stylesheet update, I created
an update to the QgsCollapsibleGroupBox class you started, adding
support for collapsing independent of normal groupbox controls [0].

The added benefit of this approach is that it is seamless inside of
QtDesigner. Once the QGroupBox is promoted to QgsCollapsibleGroupBox,
a developer can utilize all controls as normal. When compiled and used
in the app, the custom groupbox class then just adds the
'collapsibility' [1].

This also means to add the collapsibility to existing groupboxes will
only require promoting in QtDesigner, with no loss of functionality
for those that already utilize the title checkbox.

The small embedded stylesheet will probably need updated to have the
groupbox's top margin look reasonably the same across platforms; but,
other than that, it should work fine. Please test my branch if you
have time. Otherwise, I can commit it to master as something others
can test with nightly builds.

Note: the edits to src/ui/qgsrasterlayersaveasdialogbase.ui where just
for testing, and would probably not be committed as is.

Wonderful what client side libs are you using? ext3 still? I'm a
django + jquery fan and would love to see something along the lines of
what you describe built on that stack.

Note also that LizMap have AFAIK implemented a similar system (proxied
access to QGIS Server with a custom web client) but in php, maybe
there are ideas that can be lifted from their code.

Thanks Tim. What I wanted to know is whether authors are interested in maintaining
it, othewise my minor patches will be rather pointless.

Hi all.
I'm noticing frequent downs in our infrastructure (now it's hub.qgis.org, the other
day was qgis.org, etc.). I feel we're having more traffic, and our current structure
is overstretched. Where can we find server stats to check this?
In any case, I think we should make our infrastructure stronger: opinion, suggestions?
All the best.

This is what I would like to do:

- migrate QGIS.org web site to rst so that we can a) host it on
gh-pages b) make it translatable more easily c) ease the load on the
server
- host downloads on gh
- use QGIS.org only for hosting django and doing builds

An alterior motive is that we will have a single platform for *all
documentation* in QGIS and that we can use git as a content management
and versioning system for our web site.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] migrating plugins from old contributed repo to the
	new one
Message-ID: <1347264013.3811.55.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

there are a number of *working* plugins hosted on the old contributed
repo that have not been migrated to the new one by their authors. Among
them there are very useful tools that now the common user is not able to
install with the plugin installer.

Is there any reason why we cannot migrate them all together in the new
repo (and let the authors know)?

cheers

Message-ID: <43599B91-3E09-41B1-9615-337349C09C8C@archtech.gr>

Hello,

Im building a plugin (c++) and apart from the vector layer that I use I need the user to be able to pick a point on the map (vector layer) as a "seed" for one analysis I have.

I imagine the steps as:

Set all the option on the PluginGUI including the layer name (done) and then before click DO JOB you need to click one button on the plugin to "pick a point" on the layer.

Any help how to do that?

Thanks
Tasos

Why in C++? Do you plan to integrate it to main source code?

Not sure if I understand what you mean exactly, but have a look at the 
CadTools plugin. These tools often need a point or line to be drawn 
before you start the actual function.

Good luck!

Hi,
the project is in very early development state. We've just implemented some
basic things for the current client we are working for, but we want to go
on with the development.
We're aware of LizMap (we're looking forward for its new release; question,
is there a public repository?), but we prefer to use Django, because it
will let us leaverage the Qgis Python APIs in case we will need them
(probably yes).
In this moment we're using qgis-web-client as it is beacuse it fits our
current needs (e.g. we don't need external base layers, it already supports
the Qgis Server print service, etc.) but I would like to implement a
Javascript API to be used independently by any JS framework.
Lots of ideas... we hope to find the needed sponsors to implement them all!

We'll release something as soon as we have a minimally stable project.
giovanni

Hi all,

Lizmap will be release soon, as a Zip file. I do not know yet if I will
create a bitbucket account to put the code here or not. Why not !

Some of next lizmap features :
* access rights management to repositories (1 repository = one folder in
the server containing one or more projects). You can defined, groups,
users, and then set the visibility of each repository to one or more groups.
* simple approach of tile caching, with no configuration needed (just click
on a checkbox in Lizmap plugin for each layer to be cached)
* new ui, etc.

I am writing some documentation right now, and will explain these features
as soon as I find time :)

Cheers
Michael

Hi Michael,
the two projects will probably overlay similar features. We've never worked
with Jelix, and we didn't want to learn another framework :)
Anyway, sharing ideas is always the best way for OS projects.
A couple of questions:

 - will you support the print service?
 - I haven't tried Lizmap yet. Does it handle rights permissions on single
layers within a .qgs project? Can you manage permissions on the request
types (e.g. getfeatureinfo, getcapabilities, etc.)?

It would be great if you could setup an SCM (bitbucket, github, or
whatelse).

Any volunteer to:

- migrate the content (very easy task, just copy>paste>rst2html>commit).
?

Hi Paolo,

In the redmine hub.qgis, it is not possible for me to create a mercurial
repository in the file systme, then pull from my repository and then modify
the hub project to specify the repository path. To be able to do this, I
would need full access (ssh) to qgis.org server.

This is why I am thinking or using bitbucket to mirror my repository.

Cheers

You can apply for it, if there are good reasons for it.
Would you need it just once, or often?
All the best.

Hi Giovanni,

* The print service will be supported in the next version. Not yet to
follow the "release often" mantra
* We think rights management must be kept simple for users. This is why we
choose deliberately to manage rights per repositories and not per project
nor layers. We think it is very easy to set up several dedicated projects
with Qgis to fit the need to protect some layers. One simple project a.qgs
for readers with layer A and B and this configuration, another
mrpresident.qgs for the big boss with all the secret layers and all the
zoom available, etc.
* Why not though add in the future the possibility to manage permissions on
request type (getCapabilities, getMap, getFeatureInfo, etc.).

Do you have a schedule for the next version?

We also thought it but it requires to propagate project and layers settings
to the various projects, A change in one project requires to manually do
the same on the others... Ok, not so bad for two or three projects, but
very time consuming if you have multiple roles = multiple projects.
Anyway, I agree with you, it's times simpler to implement ;)

Ok.
Our goals are very similar. We will think on it...

Not yet, no. We will release V2 today or tomorrow. We have no schedule yet
for the next one..

We totally agree. It depends of the number of projects and roles to deal
with. What could be great in Qgis : be able to set a "master" project file
(with all layers and configurations), and have a tool (or natively in Qgis)
to create "child" projects based one this master one. I am not speaking
about copy/paste as some of the already existed python plugins do. I am
thinking about kind of a dynamic link between master and children.
Would it be possible in Qgis XML project file to dynamically load external
resources on demand ? I am thinking about the way we can import a CSS file
into another, etc.

Are you aware of the project nesting capability Marco added? It should
provide you with the 'define once, use many times' implementation you
desire.

Implementing it as a python plugin, rather than a c++ plugin, means
more people can use it easily. Most plugins are in python.

there is already a quite long list of C++ plugins/tools that were never
added upstream and that died or simply never got the necessary
attention/visibility.

I just tried it, and it works as expected ! I did see this new feature, but
I did not realize the links where dynamic.

Now I will try with Qgis Server. I hope we won't have problems with fcgi
cache...

yes, unfortunately a [probable] memory leak somewhere fills up the ram.
I have no time at the moment to look at it, and I think Pirmin hasn't
either, but he told me some time ago that there was a student (or some

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS python vector layer select behaviour
Message-ID: <CALCNqkZO2zZApdXxiNTW0L22d5Ex0=yTP0tsY=ZhD_-0Ry-TfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

If I take this simple little script and run it in the QGIS python
console after loading e.g. the tests/testdata/points.shp, nothing gets
selected:

from qgis.utils import iface
l = iface.activeLayer()
r = iface.mapCanvas().extent()
m = l.dataProvider().attributeIndexes()
l.select(m, r, True, True)

However this one works fine:

from qgis.utils import iface
l = iface.activeLayer()
r = iface.mapCanvas().extent()
l.select(r, True)

Does anyone know why the first does not work?


Thanks

Hi Tim,

it doesn't highlight anything, it fetches features from
the layer like l.dataProvider().select(m, r, True, True) does
from the provider but it takes care of uncommitted features.

Probably would be better to rename it to fetch or maybe
the other ones from select/deselect to highligh/unhighlight.

Cheers.

It seems to be a memory leak of some sort. Some speculate that it might
be ruby that runs hub.qgis. I actually think finding a new home for the
nightly builds would free up plenty of resources for the web needs, our
web server is not miniscule (2 cores, 4 GB of ram). You can also notice
from the charts that the issue came up several times over a couple of
days and then has not shown up for 5 days at all.

I agree with the moving to rst but would prefer to continue to host it
using Sphinx to build the docs (obviously the files can live in git to
get the benefits that Tim mentions). To me this is more flexible and we
can install caching software. This is the same route Mapserver went a
couple of years ago, and the same setup we use for osgeo-live.

As for downloads, we've always had downloads.osgeo.org available and can
use that at any time. For osgeo-live we actually pushed our downloads to
sourceforge recently to get 20 mirrors world-wide. If we really need
more capacity I can offer university based servers (no $ for bandwidth,
in addition to OSUOSL which is our current host and also at a univ).

Basically I like github but cautious about using it for everything.
Enough files and it will start costing $ to keep it up.

Thanks,
Alex

Can you clarify - are you suggesting that the build processing itself
should be moved or the hosting of the built packages?

Sorry I was unclear - the plan is already to use sphinx.

Ok good to know.

Oh - I thought it was all free for FOSS projects? My main interest is
to consolidate our infrastructure - it has too many moving parts and
not enough grease monkeys to keep the cogs oiled....

agreed, the current structure is very complex, better KIS.

WCS test using Mapserver running on wcs.qgis.org was added during the
summer. I cannot imagine however how it could cause memory leak as it
is running as simple CGI.

I can decrease the number of WCS tests for now.

Hi Tim,
thanks for this. Can we set up an experimental.qgis.org website to see the progresses?
I think this will motivate helpers.

I can't imagine it either - though I have had issues on a clients
server where UMN Mapserver creates runaway processes that never
terminate and eat up all available cpu power. If the WCS test instance
does become an issue I am sure we can make another plan - I prefer
that reducing the number of tests we run should be the last possible
alternative, not the first.

Hi all.
Accessing a sample WCS server: http://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wcs I can use 3 out
of 4 layers. The last one (modis-001) throws an error.
Am I the only one?
All the best.

When saving a raster from WCS, the download apparently stops at 5%, and there is no

yes, I had troubles saving from both wms and wcs, but I haven't tried
really hard...

Hi all, 
I couldn't find a way to style raster with multiband gray levels (R+G+B). It
is currently only possible with one band at a time. Red or  blue or green..
Did I miss something? 

It would be really is usefull for topographic maps and aerial photo, when
needing not to interfer with overlaying colored layers. 

Should I file a feature request? 

Cheers,

R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] secondary mapCanvas and memory layer
Message-ID: <1347359652506-5001051.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

I would like to show my spatial analysis results using a temporary "memory"
vector layer in a secondary mapCanvas hosted inside a python plugin widget.

I'dont know exactly:
- how to clone/copy a feature from an existing layer to a new temp "memory"
vector layer
- how to add the temp layer to my mapCanvas instance since
qgsMapLayerRegistry has only one global instance used by the qgis mapCanvas

The following code produces strange behaviours:
temp_layer = QgsVectorLayer('Polygon', 'temp_layer', 'memory')
temp_layer_provider = temp_layer.dataProvider()
temp_layer_provider.addFeatures([intersected_feature])
canvas_layer = QgsMapCanvasLayer (temp_layer)
self.map_canvas.setLayerSet([canvas_layer])
self.map_canvas.setExtent(temp_layer.extent())


Any help will be very appreciated.

Massimo

No. It is known (to me). I believe that the problem is in server
configuration. The DescrabeCoverage
http://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/wcs?SERVICE=WCS&REQUEST=DescribeCoverage&VERSION=1.0.0&COVERAGE=modis-001

specifies

<temporalDomain>
<gml:timePosition>2002-001</gml:timePosition>
</temporalDomain>

but the layer itself probably is not configured to support time, so a
GetCoverage request with TIME=2002-001 gives:

"The WCS vendor also reported: msWCSGetCoverage(): WCS server error.
Underlying layer is not tiled, unable to do temporal subsetting."

I am a bit reluctant to add (another, how many more?) hack for it in
QGIS, so that if only one time position is defined, the TIME param
won't be used. But that would be probably only for this particular
(wrong?) server configuration.

You have probably combined two issues in one question.

The first problems is if saving WCS works? Have you accidently run
save as with high resolution so that it works on background but it is
slow? Is it frozen or requests are sending to server?

The second one is request for new feature to add a possibility to
cancel saving in progress. Please add a new ticket for it.

Just a heads up that I merged the work that Salvatore Larosa (with
some help from Larry Shaffer) has been doing on using pyscintilla for
the QGIS python console. His work adds a new dependency for
python-qscintilla2

Thanks Salvatore, great new feature!

If it cannot be aborted with normal abort button in progress dialo, it
seems to be hanging on network request. What timeout do you have in

Rendering of the raster works?

It's free up to a size limit, if you look in your account details or the
org details you'll see the quota. I agree with simplifying, which to me
means keeping it all on the qgis.org server, because we can actually
control all of that.

Moving to sphinx instead of Joomla should help reduce the complexity a
bit. I think we were also talking about Poodle for managing the rst
translations (a django app) and we've already moved the wiki into
redmine. So I think we're actually started on consolidation as is.

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Upgraded collapsible groupboxes
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_Tvtn28=DEdLyantoU1hu5j93vbknkuePqWAg1VothbQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Over the past couple of days Etienne Tourigny and I have upgraded the
functionality of the QgsCollapsibleGroupBox class he recently
introduced. The changes have been pushed to master branch and can be
seen in the Save As... dialog for raster layers and in the scroll
areas of the 3 tabs in the PAL Labeling options.

We have tested on some Linux versions and on Mac. *Feedback on the
look and functionality, as well as any OS-specific issues, would be
greatly appreciated.* It would be best to make sure these new changes
work on (hopefully) every supported platform before using them more
extensively.

New features:

* Disclosure triangle collapses/expands independent of groupbox title checkbox.
* Title checkbox also intuitively collapses/expands the groupbox.
* Groupbox title can be clicked to collapse/expand groupbox,
regardless of whether it has a checkbox.
* Collapsed/expanded state is auto-saved/loaded to QSettings,
persisting between dialog openings and relaunch.

Using the custom class in QtDesigner:

* Just promote existing or new groupbox widgets using
QgsCollapsibleGroupBox.h. (Note: there will be no visual or functional
change with the promoted groupbox, either in form layout or preview
modes)
* Work with groupboxes as normal in Designer; it will have collapsible
features when shown in QGIS.
* Default state is expanded.
* Use mMyGroupBox->setCollapsed( true ); to set preferred collapsed
state before first showing. This is always override-able by user
later, but will help devs craft the initial look they want in the
dialog (e.g. hide advanced or secondary settings).
* Please give your groupboxes appropriate names, like
mScaleVisibilityGroupBox, instead of leaving it vague, like
groupBox_3. That name and the object name of the parent window is what
is saved in QSettings for persisting state.


I think these changes will greatly reduce scrolling and clutter as
dialogs become more complex.

Thanks to Etienne Tourigny for introducing the feature and his work on
making it better.

Regards,

Larry Shaffer

Awesome stuff guys. Perhaps you could transcribe some of the above
info into the CODING.t2t doc in the gui section?

Well we are also trying to reduce the resource usage on that server so
if we could look into one of the other available options you mentioned
that would be great.

Yup there is already a pootle instance running but we are on hold
until the user manual transcription is complete. We have taken an
number of other steps in this consolidation process. Bottom line is I
think we are all committed to shifting over to rst/sphinx, and where
specifically stuff gets hosted is something we can discuss and adjust
as we go along. I'm really looking for a 'push to publish' solution
for all our materials (push in git and the site / doc /etc gets
published).

Message-ID: <CABxN9axnbWcesNJ3rHjBLWUzFL6k7ZchxUzhrU3ZNqHK9Nz-Zw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

different powerful tools are available from GRASS GIS AddOns for GRASS GIS [1];
source code and windows binaries are provided from difference web
resources [2] [3].

So, which could be the best strategy in order to integrate some of
these tools in QGIS and redistribute them?
I have few ideas (add them to GRASS Plugin creating new qgm files, add
the to GRASS thought Sextante plugin) and many doubts about an easy
installation and upgrade procedure, so suggestions are welcome

Thanks

Unfortunately I cannot replicate it, for me it is downloading in 20
parts, each part takes about 5s.

Again, what timeout do you have in Options > Network > Timeout? Can
you try to set it to 10000ms?

Can you try to just display the same raster with another instance of
QGIS when saveas is frozen on 5% (keeping the first QGIS instance
running)?

BTW, there is another problem with the written raster, it is somehow
corrupted (0 values grid), I am debugging that now.

On Debian unstable it looks nice. Just one group takes much space when closed (Save
as... --> No data values).
Thanks a lot.

Hi Enrico,
I see two issues here:
- how to distribute GRASS addons (this is out of scope in this list)
- (in QGIS) how to check for the presence of GRASS addons, and add the relevant menus.
For the second problem, I see two approaches:
- add the menus anyway, and add a mechanism to show them only when the module is
available on the system
- add the menu as an additional step in the installation procedure.
The second approach is therefore an issue for packagers only, it is cleaner, and does
not look too complicated.
All the best, and thanks.

Any chance,  we (Mac OS X users) can download the unstable (QGIS
1.9.x) version for Mac OS X?

I think it would be good to have Mac OS X unstable releases as well.

Probably, you can place some of your Mac OS X binaries (QGIS 1.9.x
testing) in sourceforge.

QGIS.org can probably open a sourceforge account just to hosting the
QGIS 1.9.x (unstable / testing) packages for Mac OS X, for example.

William's site does not have QGIS unstable releases now.

Thanks in advance.

In fact, the raster yesterday was produced, all with 0s.
So the problem is that qgis hangs, not that the raster is not produced.
Tried again, with smaller timeout, now it works, but the raster produced is weird
(all gridded, can send it privately).

Thanks a lot.

Exactly, this must be done by user using GRASS g.extension or
installing by hand. We cannot take responsibility of it. As
g.extension manual says "... obtaining successful behavior on all
platforms is rather tricky"

There is really a lot of addons, it seems impossible to maintain up to
date qgm for all of them. It may also happen that user writes his own
addon and wants to add it to QGIS GUI.

I would suggest to add a possibility to autogenerate GUI from module
description with all module options on the fly.

I guess that the server or network was temporarily down, each part
waited for timeout, when it expired no data were written. We must
interrupt saving and report error in that case.

QGIS hangs if server hangs. The raster architecture is ready to run
saving in a separate thread. The pipe is cloned  including the
provider. What is missing is some 'download' (saveas) manager. Martin,
do you see any problem in running save as in separate threads?

It is the problem I mentioned in previous mail, I am working on it and
I'll keep you informed.

It should be fixed, it was bug in data type conversion.

You will notice however, some resampling problem, which I am inspecting now.

Hi again

I forgot the link to the source code :
https://bitbucket.org/mdouchin/lizmap/

It is read-only (i think, it is my first time with bitbucket...). Anyone
willing to help (translation in italian, spanish, etc., ) can send us
patches attached to the hub.qgis.org site : just create a new issue and
attach your patch.

To create your patch, you can use the mq extension of mercurial, which is
very handy.

Cheers,

people can have a look at the administration page (where you can manage
lizmap configuration, users, groups, repositories and rights).

The server is not very powerfull. I hope it will handle the load.

Cheers
Michael

It should also be fixed.

You may notice slightly different colors, that is because default
stretching is applied and min/max estimation is different in QGIS and
GDAL.

I experimented a bit:
- removing the old svn repo misses all the old history
- removing the git misses the recent stuff.
So the only clean way is to import the svn history into git. Could someone plese do
this? Afterwards we can remove the svn repo from

Hi all

I took some time to check if we can use the new feature "Embed layers and
groups" in QGIS Server. It appears not at the moment, because the
GetCapabilities XML returned by QGIS Server with a child project (one with
embeded layers from the parent project) does not contain any <Layer>  item.

I think the server should be able to copy the layer information from the
parent project, and deals internaly with the different relative paths of
each imported layer if needed.

I can open a ticket if needed.

Michael

I've been fairly busy and totally forgot to post that I have this
already set up (running since August, 27th) [0].

Everything about the nightly is outlined here: http://qgis.dakotacarto.com/
 (dang, just noticed it's currently stuck at Sept. 9th, will fix ASAP)

It includes support for the QScintilla2 Python module already (not in
the INSTALL doc yet), so Salvatore Larosa's new Python Console should
work for builds uploaded after Sept 10. Of note, you can run the
builds directly from the decompressed DMG archive. The builds only
support Python 2.7, unlike William's installers, so Snow Leopard is
not supported. Runs fine on Lion, should work OK on Mt. Lion.

The build also runs 'make Experimental' and reports to QGIS's CDash
panel under the site name 'qgis.dakotacarto.com'. Obviously, it's not
currently a fault-tolerant setup, so some days there might not be any
update.  :^)  I currently do not have an available hardware server (or
time) to set up a Jenkins or other CI server.

@Tim, I opted to store the builds in one of my S3 buckets. Also, I did
not post direct download links to the nightly ZIP archive on the
qgis.org website, because that wiki page is editable by anyone with an
osgeo login. Is there a way to make the download page more secure
against unwanted tampering?

It is there, except for revisions 1, 2 and 3.
I suggest you look for support on the ohloh forums.

It may help if you see a specific commit which is missing.
I assumed we only miss 1,2 and 3 because git history starts
with SVN revision 4, but there might be more "holes" due to
commits in different SVN branches not represented in git.

if I enable only the git repo, the history starts from the time when we switched to
git, nothing from svn.

In that case I bet it's the ohloh counter only fetching commits
which are _newer_ than what it already has. If that's the case
things _may_ fix by removing the git repo link and then re-adding
it, but only if the ohloh service drops the whole cache as soon as
you drop the repository. Better to wait for ohloh devs response.

Good to see a Mac developer that's not lazy like me to make regular dev packages.  A couple notes - I've found that the package ID should be changed, otherwise if someone installs the stable package it will probably overwrite the dev version (or simple destroy it).

I never set up a script to do this, just changed it manually when I create a dev package.  the Info.plist should be changed:

	<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
	<string>org.qgis.qgis-dev</string>

The OS X installer looks at the bundle ID and updates/removes old copies with the same ID, even if the name is different.  Changing it solves that problem.

Also, renaming the dev app would be good, so it can be easily installed alongside the release version.  Maybe something like QGIS 2.0-dev.app, or put the revision or date in there also.

You could set up a cmake command to do this in a user bundling script, defined with QGIS_MACAPP_BUNDLE_USER.

Hi,

It seems to be working well for me (compiled under Archlinux). Just one 
small remark:
* For a long dialog like "Save as ..." for rasters, I need to scroll to 
see everything. When the "Pyramids" groupbox is closed, the area scrolls 
automatically to hide the resulting blank space, which is nice. However, 
when opening the "Pyramids" groupbox, the dialog does not scroll down to 
show the newly visible options. It would be nice to show them, as if we 
open the groupbox we are probably interested in its content.

Regards,

Leyan

Hi, thanks for your input

I have tried to fix that issue, but didn't find a working solution yet
(there is code in there addressing that issue). I think that Qt does
not scroll down, because part of the widget is already visible. If
anyone has a suggestion I would appreciate it.

Hi William,

There is a new build uploaded [0], which incorporates your
suggestions. Turns out there seems to be ever more files left over
after running the new tests, so I had to add git clean and reset
commands to the build script to clear the working tree so pulls
wouldn't fail. That auto-build script is available here [1]; any input
on its functionality is welcome.

Good points, thanks. I've modified the build script to change the
CFBundleIdentifier value and set the name to 'QGIS 2.0-dev.app' as per
your suggestions. The short git sha hash is already part of the name
for the embedded DMG, and shown in the running app. The app's version
when viewed in Get Info looks a little verbose, but that's just
cosmetic.

The nightly build should now run fine from /Applications, alongside
your stable version; though, the app can now run from anywhere,
including directly from the DMG. I saw in your Read Me.rtf the
following note:

'Note that QGIS.app MUST be installed in /Applications and must not be
renamed for pyuic4 to work (it has a hardcoded path in it).'

I've replaced the hardcoded path in pyuic4 with this, which works well:

exec pythonw2.7 "$(/usr/bin/dirname
"$0")/../../Resources/python/PyQt4/uic/pyuic.py" ${1+"$@"}

I've also done this in mac/cmake/1qt.cmake.in, for regular builds
(tested). If you don't see an issue with that edit, I'll push it to
master. Do you foresee any other problems running the dev builds from
within the opened DMGs (works fine for me, now) or from anywhere else
that's not /Applications?


On another note, Salvatore Larosa's new Python Console (now in core)
uses the QScintilla2 module/lib (see build script for how I currently
include it, after install). Installing QScintilla2 and its Python
module should be added to the Mac build notes (I can do that); and, to
the CMake finds (maybe as FindQsci.cmake) and Mac bundling CMake setup
(basically similar to how PyQwt was handled). I can do this as well,
unless you have time help with it.

I think, once FindQsci.cmake is set up, adding QScintilla2 support
directly to QGIS for C++ usage should be pretty quick, though nothing
in C++ currently uses the Qsci widget... yet. Would work well for
displaying/editing the new Python project macros done by Giuseppe
Sucameli.

Ah, cool advanced shell stuff - if it works, I don't see any problem including it in master.

One advantage I can see by installing it somewhere is that the Python files can be compiled after installation (I do that in my installers).  Otherwise, from the DMG, python files will be compiled every time they're loaded (I don't really know how much time compilation takes in execution).

Not sure how that would be possible from the QgsCollapsibleGroupBox
class, since the custom groupbox could be placed anywhere, not just in
a scroll area. What Leyan is suggesting (I think) would have to be
some slot in the dialog's class that catches the signal when one of
its children collapsible groupboxes is expanded, then figures the
current scroll position of the groupbox and how much of it is hidden,
then scrolls appropriately to expose the whole groupbox.

This would be somewhat similar to toolbox behavior, though without the
horrible 'hide everything else' aspect of that widget. A nice feature
to have, but probably a pain to add to many dialogs... unless we
create a custom Designer plugin scroll area class with such a slot so
that the signal of every collapsible groupbox it contains could be
assigned to it in Designer. The QgsCollapsibleGroupBox class would
also have to be a QtDesigner plugin, which Etienne has already worked
on.

Larry

This code is already in src/gui/qgsrasterlayersaveasdialog.cpp but
does not appear to have an effect (as the top of the widget is visible
when it is expanded).

 connect( mCreateOptionsGroupBox, SIGNAL( collapsedStateChanged( QWidget* ) ),
           this, SLOT( groupBoxExpanded( QWidget* ) ) );

Perhaps adding margins would help, or calculating the expanded
groupbox size and scrolling to that.

Any way, QgsCollapsibleGroupBox could be hacked to detect if parent is
a QScrollArea (or descendant) and call groupBoxExpanded() on that
parent.

Not necessarily, we can create a subclass of QScrollArea, that is
aware of any child QgsCollapsibleGrouoBox. And promote any widget to
our custom widgets, without resorting to designer plugins.

But working directly in qgscollapsiblegroupbox (as explained above)
might be easier. Should scrolling to the bottom of opened groupbox be
automatic, or would there be cases where it should be disabled?

Hi Michael

Please open a ticket. Embedding layers / groups with QGIS server used to 
work when I implemented the feature. Could be there is something broken.

Congratulations, but I have to say that that the planned obsolescence strikes
back, nothing for Snow Leopard...
How do you manage the change of OS so quickly ?
Personally, I do not have time, with a stable Snow Leopard for work (I need
Rosetta), while my Mac is now a little more than two years old...
Lion was released in 2011 and Mountain Lion, in 2012, what next in 2013 ?

If I want to test this version, I need to migrate or learn to compile QGIS
(take some time, i am geologist and not a programmer). It's very frustrating
and I do not think that I was alone .

I thank William for still thinking of us but for how long ?

I feel your pain. As someone who works in IT, I find the new rate of
Apple's OS versions very problematic. I am just now moving all of the
Macs I manage over to Lion (at a company full of geologists, btw).
Snow Leopard was quicker and so much more stable, though.

Sorry about the frustration. It is really just an issue (for the most
part) with which system Python version is supported. William's
installers manage both versions of Python, relative to OS being
installed on [0]. My nightly builds are only compiled against the
system Python version 2.7, Snow Leopard only comes with up to 2.6. I
suppose I could just as easily make a second build that supports
Python 2.6. That would be considerably easier for me than trying to
automate creating an installer package.

I will look into this today and get back to you.

Thanks,
What is really confounding is that my colleagues on Windows or Linux do not
encounter this kind of problem. 
However, I know many people who work with QGIS on Mac ( Leopard, Snow
Leopard and Lion) but I have the impression that we are not taken seriously
by the QGIS developers and some plugins developers.

But I can understand, William (an now you) for Mac, how many for Windows and
Linux ?

it is not that we dont take anyone seriously, it is the ammount of dev that
use it. I could arge that there is worse... look at android, those poor

Putting a positive spin on it, there are now twice as many Mac devs regularly involved with the project than in the recent past.

I dont think that is a fair assessment. We have been really fortunate
to have William and now Larry supporting OSX  (together constituing
around 10% of our core developer force) and we have a few 'power
users' who hang out on IRC and regularly give feedback to try to
improve OSX. The fact is that we are a small team of developers with a
general leaning towards working on Linux based systems for our
development work - it fits well with the ethos of Free Software which
we are trying to promote with QGIS. Both OSX and Windows in my limited
experience in using them as a development platform are idiosyncratic
and present various difficulties that stand in the way of a productive
coding session compared to the relatively simple platform provided by
Linux, so they don't tend to be 'home base' for the majority of
developers. However we do take care to ensure that new developments in
QGIS are never locked in to one specific platform and try as far as
possible to ensure that things will work seamlessly across all 4
platforms, which believe me is not always a trivial task. The best
task to improving mac support is to speak up as you have done and let
folks know where your issues lie and where possible folks will try to
accommodate you.


Regards

Tim

Gene, I understand how the perception of Mac users not being taken
seriously can occur, but let me assure you this is not the case.

Almost all developers, and other folks like packagers, documentation
writers, translators and web developers, involved with the QGIS
project are volunteers. As such, they individually tend not to have
the extensive multi-platform testing resources like a commercial GIS
product company might have. Each volunteer works on their platform of
choice and often tries to test on as many platforms as they can since
QGIS is based on Qt, which runs on many platforms. While I
develop/compile on Mac, like other devs, I rely upon nightly builds
for other platforms and users to test, which I do in over 5 different
virtual machines via Parallels... but it's very time consuming and
costly.

The fact that QGIS works as well as it does and on so many platforms,
and that it can compete with commercial GIS products is a testament to
those who have contributed.

Since most developers for QGIS work on Linux, and some on Windows, I
understand how labor-intensive (and expensive) it can be to maintain
other platforms, especially like Mac OS X, just for testing. It's not
that those developers aren't taking Mac users seriously, there is just
only so many hours in the day one can devote to an open source project
(albeit, J?rgen Fischer seems to work in a different time dimension).
If it wasn't for William's efforts over many years on the Mac side of
things, Mac users, including myself, would have never discovered or
used QGIS, let alone moved on to help with development.

This is how open source works, people taking initiative to solve
problems. With ever more Mac users will come more Mac devs. I think we
are on the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, in this regard. This is
one of the reasons I took the initiative to help with the project. If
you know of anyone else that can help with QGIS on Mac, *please*
encourage them to do so.

Plugin developers have similar concerns, but possibly with even less
time to volunteer to the project and less resources to devote to
multi-platform testing. They develop on their platforms of choice and
of their own accord, and the project, per se, isn't really in a
position to force those developers to ensure their plugins work
perfectly on all platforms.

There is, however, a concerted effort since after QGIS 1.7 to address
some of these issues with plugins, e.g. plugins.qgis.org, more
stringent acceptance guidelines, etc. There has to be a balance
between strictly ensuring compliance with standards and not making it
too much of a pain to submit a plugin to plugins.qgis.org. This why
some plugins are classified as 'experimental'.

Nonetheless, thank you very much for voicing your concern.
Communication is the key to overcoming open source issues, even if
they are merely perceptual in nature.

Configure options I use to compile for Snow Python 2.6:

export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6
export DESTDIR=~/Applications/qgis-release
export CFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk"
export CXXFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk"
export LDFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk"

cmake ... \
-D CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET="10.6" \
-D CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT="/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk" \
-D PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2.6 \
-D SIP_BINARY_PATH=/Users/Shared/unix/python-snow/bin/sip \
...

Any external dependencies (like the QScintilla2 you added, and Qwt, spatialindex, ...) must be also compiled with the 10.6 deployment target.  My frameworks are OK.  The sip bit above assumes a separate SIP/PyQt compiled for 10.6 in the system Python 2.6 site-packages.  But compiling SIP/PyQt *for* Snow Python 2.6 *on* Lion is tricky, and needs a hack to the system Python.  (the simple solution is to compile on Snow)

Sorry for the late reply, but I find it useful to see quickly whether all my layers have the same CRS or not (which is useful in cases where you want to use a tool where the layers are required to be in the same CRS).

The sip bit above assumes a separate SIP/PyQt compiled for 10.6 in the system Python 2.6 site-packages.  But compiling SIP/PyQt *for* Snow Python 2.6 *on* Lion is tricky, and needs a hack to the system Python.  (the simple solution is to compile on Snow)

@William, thanks for the help. I settled on the latter, '(the simple
solution is to compile on Snow)'.  :^)

@Gene, please test the Snow Leopard master nightly on your 64-bit-capable Macs:

http://qgis.dakotacarto.com

You might see intermittent builds over the next few days, until I can
verify the nightly build script works on that older Core 2 Duo server
and that it reports the unit tests correctly.

Regards,

Larry

The code has been moved to the QGIS repo (in a sextante-branch, not
still merged into master), but unfortunately, I have not had time to
do any work. I am currently rather busy, as I have started a new job,
but I hope to have more time soon (and specially, more energy), to
work on SEXTANTE.

I do not know about other developers who were also working on
SEXTANTE, but I hope people like Camilo or Alexander, who were doing a
gretat work, will keep contributing

Regards

Victor

Hi

Alex and I have had a chat about it - he has been implementing the
needed CMake stuff and when that works he will merge.

Hi all

We will reach the maximum number of beds which are available for
community events in Linuxhotel. These number of beds includes single and
double rooms. So its necessary to share rooms. So I ask you to think
about with whom you will share a room. If you dont like to share a room
please let me know, we can have a look for an alternative accomodation.

Hello Gene, all,

Let me also add my 2 cents. 

Your impression that there is not primary attention on Mac users is
understandable. There actually are many Mac users of QGIS, but few are
power users or developers. 
This can have many causes: among them, the difficulty to set up a
developing environment on Mac, and the rapidity of OS updates. Maybe
there is also the belief that users and developers are separate roles,
and that users are not encouraged to become developers (my opinion
based on discussions with some Mac users I know).

As others suggested already, it would be very helpful that more Mac
users give accurate feedback on the issues they encounter, and aim to
become power users. 
I can assure that there is no selection at all from the present
developer team when accepting new devs according to the OS they use, or
deliberate less care on Mac-specific issues. It is mainly a consequence
of the proactiveness of Linux and Windows users, that become power users
and developers in larger numbers and proportions.

Remember also that closed source software does not always take care of
Mac users - shall I cite ESRI, that still has no native GIS packages for
Mac, despite all complaints (that is the only thing to do, as
it is impossible for a user to become a developer)? 

That said, I hope more Mac users join the dev team and actively help
William and Larry!

All the best,

Anne

Hi


Life wouldn't be the same without me spamming your inbox every friday
encouraging you to write a test would it? First take a look at this
lovely chart:

http://jenkins.linfiniti.com/job/QGIS/test/?width=800&height=600

See how nicely it is growing up up up? Now look at this page:

http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS

Maybe its some of your code making one of those ugly red boxes on our
test stats? Instead of writing a new test this week, perhaps you could
take a look and see if you can help to get all the existing tests to
pass on all platforms!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] mac mini as MacOsX build/test server?
Message-ID: <505315FD.8030600@duif.net>

Gents,

I'm not sure what the status is of a macosx buildserver/service to 
provide testresults for our automated testing framework.

But I have a macmini here laying around with MacOsX 10.6.8 (Snow 
Leopard) which I'm happy to hook on the internet 24/7 (we have a fixed 
IP here) and make available over ssh for a limited set of known users.

There is not a huge internet pipe going in/out of our office, but it 
should be enough to do a daily automated git pull, compile, test and 
push some packages and test results out daily (preferably not downloads...).

If interested, let me know, I can even bring it with me to Essen (or 
make it available over ssh withing a couple of days)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde


ps1: I cannot donate the physical hardware, because once and every time 
we have to check some of our sites in Safari. So it has to stay near my 
desk and have a monitor on it...

ps2: I'm not a mac user, so can not provide much 'mac knowledge'

I tried to see that after seeing that Radim was camping but their
website is a bit challenging for me.....is it the case that we can
camp & do they have showers etc for campers? What is the temperature
going to be more or less at night?

I have pushed a fix for this directly in QgsCollapsibleGroupBox, by
finding the parent QScrollArea widget and scrolling down when
expanding. I needed to call QApplication::processEvents() before
mParentScrollArea->ensureWidgetVisible( this );

This works in both dialogs that use the collapsible group box (raster
save as and label editor).

In the case that layout is different, there is still the
collapsedStateChanged( QWidget* ) signal that is emitted.

I have also pushed a layout fix when using the Oxygen theme (common in
KDE desktops), thanks to the help of Radim and Larry, as well as a few
other fixes by Larry.

I noticed the same thing on osgeo4w builds of a few days ago, with a
multi-band raster (nodata disabled).

However in linux I can't reproduce this.  Can update to latest master
and send a screenshot?

I assume this is with a single-band raster? Does it happen with
multi-band raster?

thanks
Etienne

Many, many thanks, your  master nightly version for Snow Leopard works very
well (the browser also).

I am not a programmer, as I have already said, but I know very well Python,
which allowed me to correct some plugins, like Sextante, so they work on
Mac:

on the QGIS User List:

Sextante on Mac OS X: the solution for running R (problem of shell = True
with Python subprocess on Unix systems) 

and on the Bug  System of Sextante:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6015 Bug #6015: Sextante on Mac OS X: a working
solution for running GRASS commands  
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6029 Bug #6029 A solution for the problem of
shell=True (Python module subprocess) in Rutils.py on Mac OS X and other
Unix system 
Resolved by Victor Olaya.

So if I can help, it is only with Python. My memories of C are too  old and
I do everything with Python now, with QGIS, GRASS GIS, databases, XML and
other geological applications  (for the past 10 years)

Congratulations for this version.

No problem. I will endeavor to keep those nightly builds up-to-date
with William's latest frameworks. If you notice issues with any
nightly first make sure your installed frameworks are also up-to-date.

Here is something of note regarding subprocesses and GUI apps on Mac
OS X: only /usr paths are searched for executables, not /usr/local (or
any custom PATH you have set in your bash profile). However, recently
John Tull and I worked out a simple solution that could use more
testing. See our chat in this IRC log [0], starting @ 22:32:49.

To summarize the solution, put the following in your .bash_profile,
and/or maybe in your .bashrc *after* every other PATH manipulation:

launchctl setenv PATH $PATH

This will allow GUI userland apps on a Mac to use both your bash
profile's custom PATH, which in turn, will allow QGIS, and its Python
plugins to utilize the PATH env variable. However, it may not be
appropriate to have this passed for all GUI apps. Use your judgment
there.

This is how John got the GRASS commands to work in SEXTANTE. Not sure
if it has any bearing on your fixes, but thought you should know.

In addition, your experience with geological applications and QGIS is
not only of interest to me, but possibly the whole QGIS community. One
of my next QGIS projects is a large geological map. While at my day
job I work for geologists, I'm just an amateur at geology myself.

If you have collected or created any geologic-specific symbols or
patterns for QGIS, please consider sharing them with the community
(and me :^). Note, there are already some available through FDGC in
the US. Also, if you have made some of those oh-so-colorful geologic
maps with QGIS, it would be great to have a sample of your work and a
nice case study written up for inclusion @

Hi all,

I just merged sextante-import branch to master. There is some
work to be done (like running tests and rebuild docs), but SEXTANTE
itself installed and works fine.

Hi

working fine for me, but only tried today with the same file
landsat.tiff.  When I implemented it I tried with large-ish files
without problems.

Maybe it's with a specific file you are having problems?

does it mean that every change in sextante will be added into qgis master
every time it is released
 (almost every night)?
and if it's, so, is not necessary to update sextante via svn anymore,isn't
it?

sorry for trivial question

That depends on how the SEXTANTE team chooses to work. Normally new
development work should be donw in individual developers repos and
then pushed over to the QGIS master repo when they are ready for
general consumption. But fixes and small changes can indeed be pushed
over on a nightly basis.

Yes the SVN repo should not be used anymore as there is no longer any
intention to move changes from svn to the QGIS repo.

Ok I was able to replicate, using the file tenbytenraster.asc as
input, but other grayscale images load fine (i.e. landsat_b1.tif).

However, if I convert it to a gtiff file externally with gdal, the
resulting gtiff file can be saved in qgis with compression options.
Can you replicate that?

Have you tried with other (real) files?

Etienne

The scroll-on-expand works very well. Nicely done!

I noticed a couple of things (one I fixed). When many groupboxes are
in the expanded state, on *first* showing of the dialog the last shown
expanded groupbox would cause the scroll area to make it visible, i.e.
it would scroll to there instead of starting at the top. Scroll areas
should start at top on dialog's first showing. Fixed in commit 8f0cb99
[0].

When the available space in the dialog is shorter than the height of
the groupbox, it appears that when expanding the groupbox, and the
scroll area scrolls to show it all, the groupbox is centered, instead
of its top part at the top of the available space. Not a big deal but
the effect can hide some options that are at the top of very tall
groupboxes (try with Data Defined Font section of Adv Labeling).

Seems like if the groupbox is too tall for the available vertical
space, it should scroll so the top (groupbox title) is at the top of
the available space. (I did not try to fix this.)

I changed this to collapsedStateChanged( QgsCollapsibleGroupBox* )
with [0]. This allows direct access to the custom widget's methods,
which I then used to make the label preview part of the splitter in
the Adv. Labeling dialog collapsible [1]. This signal will be useful
when connecting many groupboxes, allowing one slot to handle all the
signals.

[1] https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/d0800fbff9dc93d788f298ce0ea98edea777e662

Unless you have (or someone else has) other features or fixes for the
new QgsCollapsibleGroupBox class, I think we can start using them in
more dialogs. Opinions on this anyone?

Larry

Hi,

Some of us (regular Sextante testers) were using Tortoise svn (Windows) to
download the latest code revision of Sextante. As soon as Victor Olaya
solved one of the bugs we reported, we would download the lastest revision
of Sextante and check if everything was ok.

Is there another program we can use to the same in the new repository? I
tried using Tortoise but it didnt work.

I think this dynamic contributed a lot to the fast paced development of
Sextante in QGIS and kept a lot of people interested. I fear that this 24
hour (or more) delay will break some of the momentum Sextante has had.

Thanks

Regards

well, not really, because commits are much less frequent these days.
However yes, IMHO we should have a quick way of updating also core plugins.
Suggestions/help/sponsorship on this are welcome.
All the best.

It works:

Hi,

Not sure if this has been discussed before, but how about including a
default typeface to package with releases/source? Here are several
reasons for doing so:

* Standard QFontMetrics allow for developing a GUI overhaul around a
known font across all platforms (at least in a pointsize at dpi default
sense).
* Known font metrics allow for standardizing relative font sizes in
app-wide stylesheets, and per platform where needed.
* Adding tests for the labeling engine would need a standard font of
consistent metrics and available/functional on all platforms.
* Currently the only Qt default font on all platforms (Courier, I
believe) is not necessarily of similar metrics, since it is from
various sources, nor is it IMHO very nice looking (apologies to any
Courier fans).
* Have a better/consistent monospaced font for the Python Console and
anywhere editor instances (e.g. QScintilla2) or code snippets are
displayed.
* Have a known set of available Unicode glyphs for translators to rely upon.
* Have a default font that provides a known set of Unicode glyphs for
font markers in symbology. (Could be spread across multiple default
symbol fonts.)
* Provide workarounds for QtDesigner bug where platform-specific fonts
end up embedded in .ui files [0].

There are probably other good reasons. I've looked at several typeface
candidates and think the DejaVu project's family of fonts [1] would
work well. While DejaVu (based off of Bitstream's Vera Sans) is
already available for Ubuntu and other Linux distros, it is relatively
unused, though fully compatible, on all supported QGIS platforms [2].
Downside: about 5 MBs extra (compressed) for package.

As a TTF DejaVu can readily be loaded into QFontDatabase [3] on
platforms that do not have a compatible DejaVu typeface already
installed. This would probably entail only loading 4 heavily-used
faces, like Sans Book/Bold and Mono Book/Bold, though I think the
entire typeface should be included.

Any other ideas for embedded fonts? Note: fonts to consider should be
in TTF format, offer enough font faces, provide enough language and
Unicode character support, and be available under the SIL Open Font
[4] or similarly compatible license.

I agree with you Larry. Your reasons are similar to those undergoing the
choice of having an embedded font, and it is DejaVu ;-)

Hi Larry,

I agree with using a unique font - but it would be best to choose one
which would minimize the need to add size to qgis.

For example, deja vu font has packages in ubuntu (to name one linux
distro), so adding it as an external dependency would not add size to
the qgis package.
Don't know about windows, osx and other linux distros though. Any case
we could provide an extra package, to be installed when needed.

On another note - do you plan to allow user to choose his font of
choice, or hard-code a specific font - based on all your arguments
above?

It seems quite a few linux distros have dejavu packages available, so
it's probably not worth worrying about for the linux packages:
http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download

It seems that Deja Vu is similar to or compatible with Verdana - which
is more widely available in Windows and OS X ?

If we end up embedding fonts (in say Windows and OSX), it might be
worth only embedding what is really necessary to save some space.
If you need only 4 typefaces (out of 21 total), then download size
would be about 1MB instead of 5MB.

I missed a line, I meant the reason of the Mapnik project, which adopted

This would be a consideration for the packagers, given their knowledge
of the platforms they support. Linux distros can probably forgo the
install, but even then, there is no guarantee the installed DejaVu
font (as an example) has the same font metrics as the one QGIS is
expecting (not an uncommon problem). Font comparisons would be in
order, first, before a decision to nix including it with a binary
install.

I don't think the added size of even the complete DejaVu font is too
large (@5MB), considering the advantages. IMHO there should not be any
separate in-app download (more coding to support). I don't think the
user should be bothered to install anything other than the current
packages (e.g. fontconfig, etc). Including a copy of the font along
with the binary is the easiest solution, if there is any chance the
default font may not exist on the target platform.

By 'default' I am suggesting that such a font always be available and
set as the default for the QApplication (QGIS) when the user first
installs, but by no means hard-coded. I see the other user choices for
fonts to be the Qt default or any other font on the user's system,
with the always available option to fallback to QGIS's 'preferred
default' font (i.e. the one in question). While Qt's default fonts
across platforms do reasonably well, it is not the same as using a
standardized, compatible font of known metrics across all
QGIS-supported platforms.

As it stands now, there is no simple means for a user to switch the
app font, or font sizes for specific parts of the app. Once those
capabilities exist for users to switch fonts (possibly causing
numerous layout problem 'bug' reports from users), it would be
advantageous to always have a default font that the project
definitively knows works and has been tested across platforms, and one
that is not at the mercy of what Qt may select.

Larry

It's not a question of similarity or availability. The font should be
an exact metrics match or some loss of advantages will occur,
especially when considering it might be used for label engine output
tests or for other purposes not yet visualized. It's not about syncing
up with availability, it's about control.

I would be in favor of QGIS only using a sans-serif font, as default.
If the DejaVu serif and 'extra light' faces are dropped, the
compressed size is just over 3 MB. Fairly reasonable size, I think, to
ship with every release to ensure complete compatibility.

The only time I see the inclusion of the 3MB as a waste is if the
distro install of DejaVu fonts *exactly* match the provided ones. Then
the provided ones would not be loaded into QFontDatabase to avoid
duplication conflicts (similar to as if the user decided to install
the provided font). IMHO it would be easier to always ship the font
with releases and just code to see if the installed DejaVu font is a
match, than to maintain packaging knowledge and coding for which
platform has a compatible version of DejaVu installed.

Regards,

Larry

Why don't we have the core python plugins are git sub modules we can
then host the code in a separate repo on github but pull it into the
main code base using git submodules [0]

This way they can be included in the main core release but can also be
pulled down and tested from a single repo.

Hi Nathan,
git submodules have been criticized, also in this list.
Maybe we could have a little script that pulls all the core pyplugins from master,
package them, and add as experimental to the main repo?

All the best.

Ok after reading some more on sub modules they sound like a pain in
the butt. Having a script to add the plugin to the plugin repo would
be best.  I know we have had this debate before but there is no reason
that we can't have a plugin in core and in the repo.

Hi,

it might be better not offering that choice  then, apart from font
sizes, to avoid support problems.

I guess I know pretty much nothing about fonts, but my understanding
is that if DejaVu is installed (in linux), it's pretty certain the
source is the official one, or else it would have another name?
I understand this is not necessarily the case for other fonts.

Most linux distros have a dejavu font package available, it's quite
easy to add a dependency on that package and not ship the fonts with
qgis.

I guess an argument to always ship with them is to ensure that the
right VERSION of the fonts is installed, or else some metrics might be
different -
in which case your argument makes sense. Could that be an issue?

Also the base package is already rather large (128MB for 1.8 osgeo4w
standalone, 30MB for qgis-dev in osgeo4w), an extra 3MB isn't going to
make much difference, given the benefits.

Matching version is important, as you never know if the metrics have
been changed to fix a previous bug. But version matching isn't needed
if just a straight QFontMetrics comparison done (if installed doesn't
match, don't use it).

I don't foresee problems with the existing DejaVu in Linux distros,
since they haven't changed much recently, but metric-matching should
still take place. However, on Mac and Windows, it is not uncommon for
users to download fonts of either a similar name or outdated version.
Installing a font face of DejaVu from some other Web source than the
official page, or having the font installed sometime in the past by
some other software, often leaves users with a font of same name, but
possibly very different metrics.

Always packaging a standard font would skip those issues.

I agree. On Mac, compressed DMGs for QGIS/GDAL/GSL (absolute minimum
install) already totals at 117 MB. For my 'normal' Kyngchaos.com
setup, full install with extras (R/GRASS/PostgreSQL, etc), it totals
around 380 MB.

I feel strongly both ways. :^)  Would be nice to offer the user a
choice (possibly allowing them use a font that 'just works' for their
OS). Then, it would help if people who support users know to tell the
user to switch to the default font for testing, but this doesn't
necessarily reduce the number of support issues, at first.

One solution might be to offer only the choice between Qt's default
and the preferred QGIS default font(s), but that seems a bit
restrictive for a modern app to me. It's a good goal to start with
though.

Larry

Yes if you refer back to hte original discussion of moving SEXTANTE to
QGIS core, you will see that I mentioned we can set up an automated
export of the SEXTANTE plugin. We  just need to determine the rules
about how and when such exports should be made.

Thanks Borys for this.
I agree, migrating is important. In case plugin developers have any reason not to
migrate them, I'd ask to please explain (in private if they prefer).
Thanks to all.

Ideally this should be triggeterd by the dev who does each commit.
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] drawing ellipses
Message-ID: <5056D70C.5020607@terglobo.nl>

Two weeks ago I posted the message below (at the user list) but did not 
get any suggestions. Today I did some tests and found a more specific 
problem. The behaviour only occurs when I "centroid fill" a polygon 
layer as ellipses. When I transform my polygons to points in PostGIS and 
create data defined ellipses on those points in QGIS, I get what I 
expect. So this seems to be some kind of bug.

By the way, a very helpful feature for drawing data defined ellipses 
would be a "scale" option since it's a small chance that your data 
values match the ellipse size in pixels. And for cartographic reasons 
you want to "play" a little with these sizes to get a good looking map.

Hope anyone can help!

Raymond

The main is when I use Styles with rules, and categories.

I set a rule A (all is red circle if armoire='A')
I set a rule B (all is blue circle if armoire='B')
I add a category on A where I want to set some symbols (triangle square ellipse
?) depending on a field. But i want that color is always set from upstream rule (here A,).

Is it possible to specify that the color (or, unlike, the symbol) is not modified and taken from upstream rule ?

After that, if it's possible i want to copy categories rules on A and paste them on B, after that symbols from B are all blue

Is it possible or planned ?

Hey Patrice,

Not possible at the moment but a pretty cool idea.  Feel free to open
a ticket for the request on hub.qgis.org so that the good idea doesn't
get forgotten.  Copy and paste in the rule based rendering would be
pretty nice to have too.

Resolved, it was missing QgsApplication instance.

My plate is full, but it will be great if someone can take this on.
Note that I had a chat with the WorldBank/Global Facility for Disaster
Reduction folks and they are going to update the specs so that the
plugin will be written against QGIS 2.0 with backwards support to QGIS
1.8 where the 1.8 featureset allows it. WB/GFDR funding has been
behind many of the new goodies coming into QGIS via Radim and Marco H
in the last few months and this is a great opportunity to extend the
goodness even further.

Regards

Tim

Sorry for the delay in replying. Yes indeed. I'm sending you an example offlist.

Also the new profile combo at the bottom of the save as dialog is a
little confusing as it seems to replicate the functionality up top.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add ST_MakeValid functionality to QgsGeometry?
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8oYQrzGC35kBeDSej-X-g5_tZKv9fSYwuhsTiJH1-spA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Recently there have been several labeling-related issues where the
conclusion is that a label is not shown because the geometry is
invalid (generally polygons). I noticed Sandro Santilli's work for
PostGIS 2.0 with the new ST_MakeValid function [0]. I'm no geometry
whiz, but it appears to be based solely off of GEOS (and some other
PostGIS internals).

What's the likelihood that the ST_MakeValid function could be ported
to QGIS?... ending up with something like:

bool QgsGeometry::makeValid()
Converts an invalid geometry to a list of valid representative geometries
Returns:  true on success and false otherwise

For labeling, this might allow for some invalid geometries to be
labeled, since labeling engine already creates duplicate temporary
feature geometries to send to PAL. I see it in the GUI as a checkbox
PAL layer option, like 'Attempt to fix invalid geometries,' that would
be off by default, since the fixing operation might slow labeling
down. This may also help to label some clipped (but invalid) polygons
around the perimeter of the visible extent, when clipping is used.

While my focus is labeling, I'm pretty sure there would be other
reasons to have a geometry fixing solution in QgsGeometry as well.
Sorry if this has already been discussed, or even implemented
somewhere in the source (if so where?).

I researched some other quick, on-the-fly geometry-fixing solutions,
but the only other option appeared to be 'prepair' [1]. The prepair
results look good [2], but it has an additional dependency on a much
larger library, CGAL [3] (12 MB).

Hi,


I can not save a model in which is used the tool 'Select by location' from fTools.

When saving, it shows the error:


An error has occured while executing Python code:

And then, when I try to remove the module 'Select by location' from the model, it shows the error:

Which will be the problem?

Thank you very much!

Message-ID: <CAP=p+YuNx445ft9ZGkijnN14ZpQ158Z6p1FwzST+jEbDvmDO8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
     I have been using QGIS for a few months now after almost a decade
using Maptitude and TransCAD (from Caliper Corporation).

     Now that I already know how to get around pretty well with QGIS, I
want to use it to production of series of maps (from a few dozens to
hundreds at a time).

     My current problem is to make simple maps with graduated style and
fixed classes for several different fields on the database.

   Looking at the PyQGIS documentation helped a bit, but I got several
errors like "NameError: name 'QtGui' is not defined" and for many other
names/libraries in the sample code I used, so I'm pretty sure that I have
something missing that was not mentioned in the documentation or that I
missed.

   Further, I'm interested in making maps with fields that are not in the
database, so I need to make a join too (which is not mentioned anywhere in
the documentation I saw).

    I would imagine that there is a way to open a project, change something
(like the fields for the graduate rendenring), update the map composer and
save the jpg, but I didn;t see anything like that...

    Did anybody face a situation like this? Any recomendations?  Any sample
code you could share?

Thanks for the help,

Pedro

Hi guys,
Including a standard font has obvious benefits for testing labelling etc, but I'm wondering if the benefits of using it for the gui aren't wishful thinking.

I think it is essential to allow the user to be able to control the font size (preferably by obeying the system font settings), as some screens are at least twice the DPI of other screens, and some people need larger fonts due to eye problems (personally, I usually find applications that specify their font offensive because it is too _big_, and typically they also either force blurry antialiased rendering, or a font which looks awful with antialiasing and cleartype disabled).

If someone was using a larger font than the "standard", would you say, "sorry, that's not a bug, use the standard font"?
Surely it is better to focus on accessibility, making a gui that can cope with different font settings?
Or am I missing something?  Would you design the gui to make sure it works with the standard font at multiple sizes?

Note: unlike other QT applications, at least on Windows QGIS currently ignores the system font size (and there is no qtconfig available on Windows)... I would consider this to be a bug.

Regards,
Alister

I'm not suggesting that the app have a fixed font size across
platforms or per platform.

I'm proposing a standardized typeface; one that has been tested, with
known results and known metrics. Beyond those base requirements, and
regarding font size, sensible defaults per platform/device would need
set to account for differences like OS conventions and dpi. Right now,
QGIS completely relies upon Qt to do this (other than overriding the
entire app's relative font size) with varying degrees of success;
especially concerning Python plugins, where it's not uncommon to find
hard-coded point sizes that are completely illegible, or too big, on
some platforms.

Ideally, I see the use of Qt stylesheets, with reasonable
platform-specific defaults that can be programmatically adjusted or
generated relative to user preferences, as a good candidate. Depending
upon the implementation, even the base defaults could be editable
without recompiling.

Qt stylesheets are inherited down the Qt object parent-child tree
(even down to PyQGIS plugins), and can be overridden or set via many
selectors. This will allow the user to choose not only the size they
want to use in general, but possibly what size they want for a
particular Qt class of object (within reason, and relative to how devs
think the app components should be classified and styled).

For example QGIS already sets its main font with a stylesheet:
  setStyleSheet( QString( "font-size: %1pt; " ).arg( fontSize ) );

but hard-codes the status bar, regardless of platform (rather limiting):
  QFont myFont( "Arial", 9 );

For testing, I would assume the standard font should look OK within a
reasonable range for a given widget, e.g. default at 12, but looks and
functions reasonably well 3 pt sizes above/below for accessibility
concerns. We can use the current Qt- and OS-produced sizes as a
starting point and tweak from there.

In general, when the app ships as a release, we would know what it
looks like on most, if not all, supported platforms when using the
standard typeface, regardless of what the user may change, or Qt would
have changed, afterwards. Trying to troubleshoot any font the user
might choose could be a nightmare; nonetheless, offering the user the
ability to choose their own font should probably still be implemented.

Regards,

Larry

Message-ID: <5058085A.8070908@lanet.lv>

Hi,

There is a possibility in the layer properties window, Fields tab to 
define Edit widgets. One of them is just opposite what the name suggest 
? ?Unique values?. In most DBMS unique is _UNIQUE_ ? no duplication is 
allowed. (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6361)

The question is ? is there any possibility to fill automatically integer 
fields with unique values?

Thank You for your time,
Karlis

Here is a nice code sample of creating a complex map using QGIS 1.8 api.

https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/blob/master/safe_qgis/map.py

Also look at the source of the Atlas plugin. Note that in master
things get considerably easier for creating a map in python since you
can use a lot more templating etc. There are some unit tests which
should provide a nice reference guide:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/test_qgscomposermap.py
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/test_qgscomposerhtml.py

It is better to write coding related questions to the dev list in my
opinion. It would alse be good if you mentioned what OS and QGIS
versions you are using when you write such emails so that we can give
you platform specific advice. It looks very much like the Qt4 python
modules are not in your path or are not installed.

Regards

Tim

Hi Pedro

The problem is that the select algorithm does not generate a new
layer, but just makes a selection on a existing one. It seems that
this case hasn't been correctly considered...

I will have a look at it and see if I can fix it

Hi Pedro,
I'm using the composer + Atlas plugin to automate the creation of map
series. These weeks the Atlas is undergoing a refactoring and the porting
to C++, with more features then the current Python version. It sould come
out during next one/two months.

Hi all.
Would it be reasonable having a sample WMS and WFS QGIS instance,
automatically installed at every commit?
I think it would be useful to quickly spot issues with various clients etc.
All the best.

glad you raised this question. The common users really misses a tool to
allow easily fix geometries in QGIS, and the feedback is that when is
needed they usually use other GIS software (for example many of the
tools in the "vector" menu do not return the expected results if the
geometries are not valid).

Any improvement in this field would be very welcome.

Dear QGis developper Team,

QgsFillSymbolLayerV2 descendants, but also QgsLineSymbolLayerV2 and
QgsMarkerSymbolLayerV2 descendants are missing from sip. 
Working with styles to a deep level it is impossible without such
exportation.
Is this by design or can I add all the missing stuff in sip files? 

Regards
Massimo

You can work around it to some extent using approach shown in [1], but
it would be really awesome to have the sip files updated to properly
support V2 symbology properly.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Map production using Python
Message-ID: <2f4301cd95f2$08c64c10$1a52e430$@gmail.com>

Hi guys,
	I have a few questions that I'd like to ask here.

	1st - I'm trying to write a code that I can run from a python shell
outside  QGIS, but I'm not finding the path where I should be importing qgis
from.

	2nd - I have to print a series of hundreds of maps and I was
planning into using the a map composer, but in the map I get, my layer
occupy a small part of the whole composer. I have this problem when I'm
working manually too, but then I can correct it.  How can I set it right so
my layer take the whole canvas?

I'm using the following software:

- Windows 7 64bits
- QGIS 1.8
Python 2.73

Thanks,

Pedro

Message-ID: <1347987174862-5002739.post at n6.nabble.com>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear QGis developper Team,

QgsFillSymbolLayerV2 descendants, but also QgsLineSymbolLayerV2 and
QgsMarkerSymbolLayerV2 descendants are missing from sip. 
Working with styles to a deep level it is impossible without such
exportation.
Is this by design or can I add all the missing stuff in sip files? 

Regards
Massimo

Regarding the second question, if I remember correctly, you can use setNewExtent on your ComposerMap object (taking a QgsRectangle as argument).

The [1] is usefull and pretty ready to use in case of style creation but
when you have to inspect or change a style you have to test the presence of
a particular property to identify which style you are handling with.
So, I'll update the sip files and I'll prepare a pull request.

Regards,
Massimo

hi
Yes a validity check would be great - although it sounds like a lot of work .
As I already had such problems with data from a friend of mine
(invalid geometry with wrong results in ftools) I also would love to
see such a check in QGIS.

kind regards

The functionality is in PostGIS.  It just uses GEOS calls, but the
actual fixing is done in PostGIS (in lwgeom_geos_clean.c).

But we could adapt the code there for inclusion in QgsGeometry.

I'd also opt for organizing the symbology-ng bindings like the rest and split
up symbology-ng.sip into the same structure as the headers.

I recently used vimdiff on a couple of sip/header combos and fixed some
differences.  On the way I also added some notes in the headers about stuff
that is missing in the bindings.

If symbology-ng.sip had been in several pieces already, I'd probably had
already added the missing bindings - as it is it's now it's harder to spot what
is still missing.

No you are missing nothing ..
Overview is definitely broken .. I already talked with Tim ..
conclusion -> we would need a test for such things but it seems to be
hard to write GUI Tests..
Probably this would be a candidate for a list of things which has to
be manualy tested?

talk about this in Essen?

Hi all,
I just confirmed (if I'm not wrong) that the off-line editing tool does
not work under 1.8/master, while it is ok in 1.7.4

who is the maintainer?

any chance for a fix in master in the next days/weeks?

thanks in advance

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Display raster layer on own Map Canvas
Message-ID: <5059BC65.7040604@gmx.de>

Hello,

I am new to python and the QGIS API and writing a plugin in python to 
simulate/model insect dispersal.

I am using .ui files and Qt Designer. And i placed a QWidget on the form 
and promote it to a new class: set QgsMapCanvas as class name and set 
qgis.gui as header file.

I load a raster layer, set canvas color and so on. But the layer only 
displays if i use QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(self.layer).
Without these code line my plugin only displays the rubber band, but not 
the raster layer. But if i use ...addMapLayer() it also loads the layer 
in QGIS. I want to have a behaviour like in the GDAL - Georeferenzierung 
plugin. There you could add a raster layer and the plugin displays it 
only in the plugin window, not in the QGIS MainWindow.

Here is the method code:

def addRasterLayer(self):
         fileName = "NE2_50M_SR.tif"
         fileInfo = QFileInfo(fileName)
         baseName = fileInfo.baseName()
         self.layer = QgsRasterLayer(fileName, baseName)
         if not self.layer.isValid():
           #error

         #only with this line of code the raster layer will be displayed:
         QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(self.layer)

         self.canvas = self.dlg.ui.mapCanvasWidget

         self.canvas.setCanvasColor(Qt.white)
         self.canvas.setExtent(self.layer.extent())
         self.canvas.setLayerSet( [ QgsMapCanvasLayer(self.layer) ] )

         r = QgsRubberBand(self.dlg.ui.mapCanvasWidget, True)
         points = [ [ QgsPoint(-10,-10), QgsPoint(0,10), 
QgsPoint(10,-10) ] ]
         r.setToGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolygon(points), None)

         self.canvas.setCurrentLayer (self.layer)
         self.canvas.setVisible(True);
         self.canvas.refresh()




best regards,

Daniel

Interesting they are copying QGIS and moving to using
jenkins-ci...hopefully that will mean nice additions to improve CI
with Qt projects and Jenkins.

Also the timing of Qt5 makes me wonder if we should complete skip over
to Qt5 for QGIS 2.0. I'm just throwing the idea up in the air, I know
most will probably shoot it down due to packaging issues etc.

hi!

What about working on a "as is" release "1.9" where most of the bugs
(overview ;) ) are (tried to be) fixed .. and then immediately start
for 2.0 with Qt5 ?
Beside some smaller issues the current state of master seems useable
and stable to me ..

regards
Werner

The next release must be 2.0 since we have really broken the api.  See
[1] to understand the rationale for this.

I agree however that releasing reasonably soon (as 2.0) would be a Good
Thing.
Perhaps we should set up a minimum set of feature we want to be ready
for the release?
Could you add this to the HF page? It would be an important topic IMHO.
All the best.

Try passing False to QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(<layer>, [bool])

The bool options should suppress it being added to the main canvas.

Then manually add it to the map canvas by wrapping it as a
mapcanvaslayer and explicitly passing a set of mapcanvaslayers using
QgsMapCanvas.setLayerSet()

Regards

Tim

PS QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(<layer>, [bool]) is
deprecated, use addMapLayers(<list>, bool) rather.

Thank you. That worked for me. (
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(self.layer, False) )

I am using Version 1.7.4. addMapLayers(<list>, bool) only works in 1.8.,
right ?

best regards,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Refresh canvas does not work
Message-ID: <1348073418840-5003004.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

i have my own canvas map with a layer in my plugin window. I want to
simulate a Cellular Automaton for insect dispersal, but the refreshing of
the canvas only works with a little trick. If I use refresh(), setDirty(),
update(), ... nothing happens. But if i open a MessageBox or leave the
method, the canvas will update. 

I have a button "Start" in my window and a click on it calls the following
method:

def startTest(self):
        self.width = 20
        self.height = 20
        r = QgsRubberBand(self.canvas, True)  # True = a polygon
        points = [ [ QgsPoint(0,0), QgsPoint(self.width*2,0),
QgsPoint(self.width*2,self.height*2),QgsPoint(0,self.height*2) ] ]
        r.setColor(QColor(255,255,255))
        r.setToGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolygon(points), None)

        # - refresh map & legend
        if hasattr(self.layer, "setCacheImage"):
           self.layer.setCacheImage( None )  
        #self.canvas.setDirty( True )
        self.layer.triggerRepaint()
        self.canvas.refresh()
        #nothing happens
        time.sleep(2)
        #only after the message box, the canvas will update
        QMessageBox.information( self.dlg ,"Info", str( self.layer.type() )
)
        time.sleep(3)
        
        self.canvas.scene().removeItem(r)


Is there any way to refresh the canvas without leaving the method
startTest() or displaying this QMessageBox ?


best regards,

DanielK

Message-ID: <CA+TxYvMoA4YkQ2c0Y0cd3SGE5z2fMS5F2UUpCTpGhzB1FRhT5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have been noticing recently an increase in Spanish emails to the
list. While I encourage all users to post their questions, I am
wondering aloud if it would not be better for everyone to add a
qgis-spanish mailing list?
There seem to be many emails in Spanish which go unanswered, so maybe
a Spanish list would be more beneficial.

On the qgis mailing list page there is a link to the german-speaking
FOSSGIS-Talk-Liste - perhaps it would be sufficient to include a list
to the osgeo spanish list ?

Etienne

Assuming there are enough Spanish 'power users' to make joining the list
worthwhile then yes. You just need to put in a request on the osgeo sac
location trac instance and ask Werner to add the list details to the Web

Hi all.
The new functions are not documented. At least for now, could we just
copy and paste simple instructions, e.g. from
http://www.sql.org/sql-database/postgresql/manual/functions.html
?
It would be simple and a big help for new users.
All the best.

The code for ST_MAkeValid is in the LibWGeom library of postgis .
The libwgeom is a portable library.
This mean is is usable and compilable without all the postgis environmnet.

as an exaple of libwgeom usage:
The new release of "Spatialite 4.0" will take advantage from this
capability of the libwgeom and will support ALL" the functions availables
in the libwgeom.
As the ST_MAkeValid and other really useful functions as the snaptogrid and
the AsX3D, and so on.

I'm using the spatialite 4.0 and gain most from its superb capability to
Collect and union of geometries.
Of course this is also thx to the use of the actually trunked geos 3.4.0.
And with the MakeValid on spatialite 4.0 I'm resolving my invalid geometis
(I'm really happy now)

But, please notice, that the ST_MakeValid however need almost the geos
3.3.0 to work.

And actually in the osgeo-setup there is available only an older geos 3.2.0.
AFAIK The ST_MakeValid don't work with the geos 3.2.0.

Regards,

Hi

I have the same issue using Windows 7.

I've changed the code the intersection with pointBuff instead of pntGeom: 

if feat.geometry().intersects(pntBuff).

It returns a result but the only problem is that it will select every
feature within the:
 pntGeom.buffer( (self.canvas.mapUnitsPerPixel() * 2),0). This can create
problems if the user is zoomed out too far. So there must be a better way of
solving the Problem.

The feat.geometry().intersects(pntGeom) also works for Polygons. So I don't
think it's the intersect function that returns no geometry.

Kind regards

Message-ID: <CAHpmJtJOmLVzyidEtB_UgG7FDOa1EyCO=+kJ7vyJZeE0zrgJLA@mail.gmail.com>

i understand that i can load tiles from any web server using gdal WMS;
and i used http://www.gdal.org/frmt_wms.html to create my xml file;

but instead of using google map or openstreet map tiles i wanna use my own
tiles to create the raster layer;

i have tried to change the server url to localhost since i have all of my
tiles locally

<GDAL_WMS>
    <Service name="TMS">
        <ServerUrl>http://localhost/home/myTiles/${z}/${x}/${y}.png

</GDAL_WMS>

however when i load this xml file to quantum gis all what i get is a black
screen;
i am not really sure but is that the right way of doing it if i wanna use
my own map tiles ?
i appreciate any help or direction;

thanks in advance;

I am not sure if I understand You correctly.
If You want to load multiple georeferenced images from Your local
directory as one layer, You can use 'gdalbuildvrt' to create virtual
raster and load it to QGIS.

Message-ID: <505B276E.3010405@gmx.de>

Hello,

I'm working on a customized user interface (based on PyQt) for attribute 
data input while digitizing single points. I know about the interface 
provided by QGIS for capturing these data (i. e. using widgets with the 
same name as the associated attribute), but I would prefer to do the 
processing/storing by myself. In this context I need to retrieve 
programmatically the geometry/coordinates of a newly digitized point 
before the form window ist closed. Can anybody give me a hint how to do 
this? I have already tried to use the last cursor position in some way 
but didn't succeed.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Message-ID: <CAEMrtYoVKaY0j2cePafBL84MSRBqk1uV3Qg0OBG_gif0eFrncA@mail.gmail.com>

I am testing QGIS WCS client with [1] and I found some problems which
are server side, I believe.

1) Coverage og:0 / version 1.0.0  [2] and bm / version 1.1.0 [5]: The
server fails in DescribeCoverage with: java.io.IOException null
Translator error Unexpected error occurred during describe coverage
xml encoding ...

2) Coverage usgs:nlcd / version 1.0.0 [3] and nlcd / version 1.1.0
[4]:  The server does not offer any CRS in DescribeCoverage
supportedCRSs / supportedCRS. If the CRS defined in
spatialDomain.Envelope is used server fails reporting error: Could not
recognize crs ...

3) Coverage 0 / version 1.1.0 [6] and naturalearth / version 1.1.0:
The server fails in GetCoverage with
'java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: xScale:the parameter value is not
valid. xScale:the parameter value is not valid.'
It fails with BOUNDINGBOX=-2,-6,2,6&GRIDORIGIN=2,-6&GRIDOFFSETS=-2,3
and it works with
BOUNDINGBOX=-2,-6,2,6&GRIDORIGIN=2,-6&GRIDOFFSETS=2,-3 (GRIDOFFSETS
signs switched) but other coverages (Arc_Sample e.g.) work OK with the
first.

4) Coverage Img_Sample / version 1.1.0 [7]: The server fails in
GetCoverage with 'java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The specified
dimensional parameter is non-positive. The specified dimensional
parameter is non-positive'.

The problems 1) and 2) occur also with GDAL 1.9.1 while other layers
are working with GDAL and WCS version 1.0.0. I could not verify WCS
1.1.0 with GDAL because all layers fail. I could not verify with
gvSIG-1_11-1305-final because it does not work at all with this
server.

CC to various lists to which it may be of interest. Let us make WCS
really working with OS GIS tools!

Hello everybody,

I've just started work on some alugins and several applications, which 
will at some point interact with qgis. As Python3 is more and more

changes to Python3.

Is there a difference between writing plugins and applications in this

modis-001 / 1.0.0 [M1]: The server advertises
temporalDomain.timePosition 2002-001 but GetCoverages fails with
'msWCSGetCoverage(): WCS server error. Underlying layer is not tiled,
unable to do temporal subsetting.' if TIME=2002-001 is used. The same
with GDAL and gvSIG. This is well known problem which I have already
reported in mapserver list.

Other layers work with WCS 1.0.0, also with GDAL and
gvSIG-1_11-1305-final (it is using 1.0.0 by default).

OTOH, modis-001 is the only one working correctly with WCS 1.1.1.
Other layers have all pixels 0. The same with GDAL.

Short answer is that it is not something we have really discussed
until now. There are broader implications than just QGIS - under the
osgeo4w environment it is nicer IMHO that everything runs against a
common python environment which means tools like gdal etc. should all
move forward together.

If you can run the latest dev version I have changed it so that the
method is passes the full feature rather then just the id.

So the method is: def mymethod(dialog, layer, feature).

In 1.8 there is no way to do want you need.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Access to buffered? point coordinates
Hello,

I'm working on a customized user interface (based on PyQt) for attribute
data input while digitizing single points. I know about the interface
provided by QGIS for capturing these data (i. e. using widgets with the
same name as the associated attribute), but I would prefer to do the
processing/storing by myself. In this context I need to retrieve
programmatically the geometry/coordinates of a newly digitized point
before the form window ist closed. Can anybody give me a hint how to do
this? I have already tried to use the last cursor position in some way
but didn't succeed.

Thank you in advance for your help!

It allows you to change the length of the scale bar, but it is strangely limited to two digits and will get reset if the value is not judged in the good range. 
Try to input a value like 40 and zoom until 40m would be considered an acceptable value. There will be a few level of zoom where the bar is set to 40m. Once you zoom in or zoom out too far, it will get calculated as usual.

I agree that this behavior is not very good nor intuitive ...

Regards,

Leyan

There's an error in
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/src/core/qgscoordinatereferencesystem.h#L475

The pointer should be of type OGRSpatialReferenceH instead of void*

The compilation error must be unnoticed for people compiling QGIS without
-DDEBUG defined, but when -DDEBUG is actually defined, OGRSpatialReferenceH is
no longer aliased to void*. See
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/browser/trunk/gdal/ogr/ogr_api.h#L59

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Need help building QGIS on Windows
Message-ID: <CAOQOUMtj5Dv4Npsc_bmJM46=GZ2kFn1ENgmDWJCJH4Fraym_+A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am trying to build a customized build of QGIS (which will have only a few
tools & menus visible). I tried following the instructions given on page
http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html#toc14, but faced a problem:
The instructions mention that Microsoft Windows Server? 2003 R2 Platform
SDK (for setupapi) is required, and can be downloaded from:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/a/d/fad9efde-8627-4e7a-8812-c351ba099151/PSDK-x86.exe
This
link is now dead.

After searching on Microsoft's side, I found that the Windows? Server 2003
SP1 Platform SDK Web Install is available at
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6510. Will this
work?

Regards,
Devdatta Tengshe

Yes a bit. Check the compilation flags passed in your case. I assume there's
-DDEBUG in them. (or it's defined in some header)

During a long time, OGRSpatialReferenceH (and many other GDAL handles
for other
types) was a typedef of void*, but there were some errors where handles
of one
type were incorrectly passed to functions that were expecting another
type. So
it was decided that in DEBUG mode, a stricter type checking would be done to
help catching such errors, while in release mode, this wouldn't change
to avoid
affecting existing user code.

I call qgis cmake with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug, but I gues I'm not the
first qgis dev to do that :)

Sounds reasonable.

Anybody else experiencing this?

I'm on master, on Linux 64bit.

In PostGIS vectors selection dialog Shift+click does not select a
range, but selects the current layer as Shift was not pressed.

In other places (f.i. in the legend, shift+click works as expected).
Should I open a bug?

When adding multiple layers to a map for quick data inspection,
initial color selection is not perfect.

It happens often that some colors are very similar and I have to
change some of them in order to distinguish them better
The very first colors may be chosen to be visually quite different

Subject: [Qgis-developer] A perfect day to write a new test!
Message-ID: <CALCNqka7XR5k8ooQnDfce+THx+poWR4XB-qNVdNSvbpG=do59Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, today is a great day to add a new test to QGIS. I had a few
offline queries, so I thought I would mention more publicly, that our
first goal for python tests is to get one test class per Qgs class
made available through the QGIS API. You don't need to test all of
that class, just constructing and destroying an instance would be a
good start. The idea is that we build a framework that is a 'jump in
point' for anyone adding a test so that we can eventually work towards
(mandating?) a workflow like this:

* make some cool new addition to an existing QGIS class
* expose it via sip python bindings
* write a test by simply adding a new test case to an existing python unit test
* run your test and verify that it passes
* send a pull request or push your work

Put more simply, I am aiming for breadth in API coverage first, then
depth. That we we can at least know when we do a release that every
single class exposed by the API exists and is usable at its most basic
level.

I am writing some new tests today too, though they probably wont make
it into master today as I am working on a forked copy of QGIS, but it
would be awesome to get any new contributed tests that others may have
inclination to write!

Happy Test Friday!

Regards

Tim

After doing more testing and investigation I have determined that the problem lies somewhere in my corporate (government) IT environment. When I connect the same computer to the internet through a FORTIGATE box that is "tunnelling" through and ignoring proxy rules, etc. then it displays the layers fine. Incidentally the Bing satellite layer in Winnipeg looks really nice, but the Google satellite layer isn't too shabby either.

Would the author of the OpenLayers plugin be possibly able to shed some light on what in the IT environment might be preventing this plugin from working properly?

Thanks,

I can see my vector layer OK but not the google satellite layer. I have verified that QGIS is communicating with the WWW by connecting to an external WMS server.

Can someone help me to get google satellite imagery working, please.

I *think* (untested) it is to enable annotations in print output.

Bob,

Have you added you proxy settings in the Options->Network tab?
OpenLayers doesn't work for me at work if I don't do this.

Nathan,
	Yes, I set up the proxy server properly. If I don't set it up then my connections to the plugin repositories and to WMS servers don't work and I've tested them and they work OK.

Right now I'm focusing on trying to identify ports or protocols that this plugin might be using that my Windows firewall might be blocking but I'm not making much progress so far. I'm using the Wireshark program for that.

Thanks,
	Bob

Bob,

Have you added you proxy settings in the Options->Network tab?
OpenLayers doesn't work for me at work if I don't do this.

Incidentally the Bing satellite layer in Winnipeg looks really nice, but the Google satellite layer isn't too shabby either.

Presumably, Qt5 would lead to some new broken api's relative to what has been done in trunk towards the 2.0 release, but confirm if that is a valid assumption or not. If it is, maybe a qgis 2.2 or higher release is a more sensible target for the switch. If not, then it is more a matter of how long transitioning and testing would take.

My non-dev thoughts,
John

Message-ID: <CABqTJk87Bvq4zvZpBs_RxMgnyjkiF5eG3VuyXZLtM+mgUs9Jmg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I notice the wms raster (the maps from a wms server are substantially
raster) don't allow to set the transparence on a single value.
It allow only the global transparence.

I don't understand why qgis will allow the set for a local png raster
meanwhile don't allow the same set for a png raster coming from a wms
server.

The single level transparency is a properties of the raster provider or a
more higher level property ?

Thx,

Yeah that probably makes sense - will be good to file a ticket with
your suggestion.

With such a big underlying change I would be inclined to make a make
version release (be it 2.0, 3.0 or what ever). My understanding is
that Qt5 is far more backwards compatible that Qt4 was and the impacts
to end users / developers should be minimal (other than new Qt5
dependency).

Tim

For a start I would suggest updating to a newer version of QGIS. 1.4
is very very old.

Would it be possible to revert to previous behaviour for the random
colours? Or were they no random before?

Hi,

It's now about two weeks that the diagram branch is in master. On IRC there has been a discussion to remove the old diagram overlay from master. As far as I can see, all functionality from overlay is included in the diagram tab.
So I think in order to tidy up the vector layer properties dialog ( and to get everybody to test the new functionality instead of the old one ) it would be good to remove this tab (and underlying code).

Are there any objections to this?

I have no commit rights on master, but I can do the changes in my repo and issue a pull-request if this is desired.

get nothin;

am still confused about gdal and wms server .. i dont know how does it work
exactly;

<ServerUrl>file:///mytiles/${z}/${x}/${y}.png</ServerUrl>

this is how myTiles folder looks like starting from zoom lvl 5 to 13:

= 5 (zoom level 5)
==> 20 (x)
===> 18.png (y)
.
.
.
= 13 (zoom level 13)
==> 5253 (x)
===> 4618.png (y)

am i missin any configuration for my tiles ? i dont really know if wms is
able to get the tiles this way;

Hi Matthias

+1 for removing the old diagram tab.

There is still code in QGIS server that uses the old diagram plugin 
classes (and afaik is still used at ETHZ to generate diagrams with SLD). 
So at least the non-gui classes need to stay until this part is ported 
to the new diagram classes.

Regards,
Marco

la capa, sin embargo en las versiones anteriores de quantum no tenia ningun
problema con ello y el resultado era positivo.
Tambien les comento que todas las capas se encuentran en postgres 8.4 y

Segun lo que he leido en la documentaci?n oficial de Quantum se?ala que si

A alguien le ha sucedido esto?
Quedo atento a sus comentarios

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Expressions in print composer
Message-ID: <506172D1.3090605@oslandia.com>

Hi all,

I am currently working on the integration of the Atlas plugin into the core.

I noticed the "replaceDateText" method of the QgsComposerLabel class 
that is aimed at dealing with the very specific "$CURRENT_DATE" 
expression and replace it with ... the current date.

For the sake of homogeneity and considering we have a powerful way of 
handling expressions, why not consider text in labels where expressions 
are surrounded by '[%' and '%]'. So $CURRENT_DATE would be replaced by 
date manipulations based on '[% $now %]' ?

The other change I propose is to enhance the optional "substitution map" 
that can be set on an expression text. It is used to define special 
column names like $layerid, $CWD and so on when using Actions on a 
layer. Until now, they are used for text replacement and cannot be used 
within an expression.
My proposal is to make them first-class citizen within the grammar.

I have a local branch with these proposed changes. If there is no 
special objections, I am about to propose them.

 Hi Hugo,

 I am open to replacements of $CURRENT_DATE(). We'd need to make sure, 
 however, that the new proposal of [% $now %] would also allow a way to 
 set the date format, e.g. german date, french date, english date or some 
 specific user defined format.

 Is your proposed change in line with what other text replacements of 
 the new expression builder do, e.g. in the label placement?

 Would the label in print composer gain a new GUI that would allow the 
 user to specify an expression?

 How about backwards compatibility of $CURRENT_DATE() ? Although it 
 wasn't well documented, I taught a lot of people about using 
 $CURRENT_DATE() - would the old syntax still work with the new proposal?

 It would be best if Marco H. could comment, since he implemented the 
 current label object in print composer.

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Agree on keeping $CURRENT_DATE() backwards compatibility. We use that on every drawing we create.

Hi Andreas,

Thanks for your feedback.

Functions like day(), month() and so on are good candidates.
However, it misses some kinds of formatting (month and day in letters 
for instance).
So a new conversion function may be needed, something like dateformat( 
$now, "ddd MMM yyyy").

It uses the same mechanism as the one used for actions on layers for 
instance or for HTML annotations on the main canvas.

Ideally yes.

Ok, that was the main point of my email. To keep or not to keep backward 
compatibility.

Judging by the first remarks, I am going to keep the backward 
compatibility and add this dateformat() equivalent if I have time to.

Hi all

reviving this old thread because I'm interested in using the z-value
(elevation) from kml files (type wkbMultiLineString25D) in a qgis plugin.

Are there any plans to introduce z-value (25D) support in 2.0?

Experimenting has shown that doing geom.exportToWkt() strips the z-value.

How can I currently handle z-values? I understand that I would have to
parse the wkb directly, is this possible in python? If so can someone give
me some pointers?

Other option - external python library like shapely? It seems shapely does
support z levels.

Or would it be simpler to parse the kml files by hand using an xml parser,
as syntax is relatively simple?


regards,
Etienne

Hi Hugo

Having expression support in QgsComposerLabel will be a great thing (and 
backwards support for $CURRENT_DATE should be no big deal I guess).

Note that I have a new composer item in the pipeline with support for 
rich text formating and with support for multiple frames. It will be 
nice to have expression support also there, hopefully we can look at it 
in Essen.

Regards,
Marco

 Hi,

 When testing a self-written plugin, I noticed a different behavior 
 between QGIS 1.8 and master.

 I used the following code to move a layer into a certain group which I 
 detected by name:

 here is the code:

 	groups = []
 	for group in self.legend.groupLayerRelationship():
 		groups.append(group[0])
 	groupIndex = groups.index(groupName)
 	#move new layer to existing group
 	self.legend.moveLayer(schuelerLayer, groupIndex)

 While this works fine in QGIS 1.8, in QGIS master it is shifted to one 
 group below the correct group. Did some behavior of the groupIndex 
 change?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Hi Hugo,

You may want to consider this proposed implementation for expression-based
tokens for use in composer labels (and maybe elsewhere in QGIS):

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6269

I don't think any coding has been done, just the GUI mockups I did. I'm
happy to help out with coding that approach.

Regards,

Larry

hm - maybe a side effect of this patch? Currently, there is a shift in
the index whereas QGIS master returns an invalid index and QGIS 1.8
returns the correct index.

I could work around it by detecting if it is QGIS 1.9 and substract 1
from the index, but it would be awkward.

Alternatively it would be nice to have a method for direct access to
groups by name, without having to loop through all groups and see if the
name matches ...

I can report a bug on this.

Hi,

legend management is in need of a review, quite a few things are
missing... would be nice to create QMap structures to be able to
access everything from python.

Hello, In Python:
- For shapefiles, , I use the pyshp ( pyshp: Python Shapefile Library/
<http://code.google.com/p/pyshp/>  ) module of Joel Lawhead to read or write
3D shapefiles:
(see  CreateElevationValues  : How to work with elevation (a.k.a. z) values.
<http://code.google.com/p/pyshp/wiki/CreateElevationValues>  
>>>import shapefile
>>>r = shapefile.Reader("MyPolyZ")
>>>r.shapes()[0].points
[[-89.0, 33.0], [-90.0, 31.0], [-91.0, 30.0]]
>>>r.shapes()[0].z
[12, 11, 12]

I use it without problem in the Python console  to process the results with
Shapely, Numpy or Grass.script

- For kml files, it is relatively easy to parse files with standard modules
like Elementtree,  or with more specialized modules (
http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=kml&submit=search
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=kml&submit=search>  )

I also use this approach in the Python console

Hi,

if you are going to review legend management please keep in mind that it
would be very usefull to:
- insert/move a layer into a sub group and not only in a top level group
- move a layer in a cerain position, before or after a specified layer
- read/extract the exact legend hierarchy

In this way it is possible to create a layer/group hierarchy starting from
an external source and vice versa.
I will be happy to contribute to such a work as I partially did with a
previous pull request https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/217 
Regards
Massimo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] uSINF qgis in c++ QT application in Windows
Message-ID: <1348645212439-5004512.post@n6.nabble.com>

hi,
I use QGIS in C++ QT Application with VC complier,

I had a lot of difficulties to make QGIS work on Windows .

The only solution I've found is to run QGIS  is to use compiled VC
librairies found in OSGeo4W.

But this solution causes me two problems:

1)There are plenty Qdebug message. it slowed enormously application and
sometimes makes bugs.

2)I have two windows where I should display the map. when I execute multiple
times, the card explodes outside the View where it should appear.

Can  anyone help me.

I do not know if this is the right place to post this message. but I do not
know where I could find a solution.

thank you in advance for your help

Imane

Yes, thanks for remembering me this ticket.
Well my patch does not handle Python-based tokens. But, I've included 
the expression builder in the composer label (a new button "insert 
expression").
That could be a base for further developments.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] status of Chinese QGIS
Message-ID: <CAPzumuFzoxj=pvhgXpG7LdebT9vYasWzi9-GJTXmYzLeEN1ukg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear users and devs,

Just sharing an experience of teaching a Chinese colleague in the use
of QGIS.  Overall the experience was very good but much improvement is
still needed to accommodate Chinese users.

A few notes:
 - Many parts of the GUI (menu names, icon labels and tool tips) do
not have a Chinese translation.
 - When creating a new vector layer, there are no option to select an
encoding.  It defaults to UTF-8.  We were able to add new geometries
but when adding attribute strings using Chinese characters, it doesn't
recognize the entry.  Creating a cpg file doesn't help either. Perhaps
related to ticket# 5255 [0]
 - gdalbuildvrt doesn't recognize Chinese directory path ticket# 6412 [1]

Apologies if I can't provide a detailed report on each item, I have
difficulty debugging the "Chinese" machine. :) Finally, I appeal to
Chinese users here to help in the GUI translation.

Thanks! QGIS is always awesome!

Like?  Do you have a patch for INSTALL (or better doc/INSTALL.t2t ff)?

Only in the qgis-dev build.

Bugs?  Where?  How?  Please provide more detail.

Probably not.   Your request is a quite broad and doesn't have much detail
about what you actually need help with.

Thanks for the info.

I was able to use shapely pretty easily, by passing the wkb from qgis
to shapely via shapely.wkb.loads(wkb)

This removed the need for actual file parsing, which qgis seem to do
well (apart from the z-level values, which it reads but does not
report),

here is the relevant python code:

from shapely.wkb import loads
feat = QgsFeature()
provider = layer.dataProvider()
provider.select(provider.attributeIndexes())
if provider.nextFeature(feat):
  lines = loads(feat.geometry().asWkb())
  if len(lines) == 1:
    coords = lines[0].coords
    (x,y,z[i]) = coords[i]

Very handy.  Is there any issues with exposing the Z values from QGIS?
 If it's there why not let people get to it.

The problem is that Shapely is based on GEOS and GEOS isn't a 3D library at
all. *The z of the geometries are not considered during any spatial
operations but you can use matplotlib to represent the 3D geometry*

>>> from shapely.geometry import Point
>>> p = geometry.Point(1,2,3)
>>> list(p.coords)
[(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)]
>>> p.has_z
True
>>> p.z
3.

*and wkt et wkb formats do not recognize the z value*
>>> p.wkt
'POINT (1.0000000000000000 2.0000000000000000)'

*The geo_interface format (GeoJson), yes*
>>> from shapely.geometry import mapping, shape
>>> p.__geo_interface__
{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)}

Spatialite 4.0 has 3D and it is using GEOS library for geometry. I
wonder where Spatialite gets its 3D?

I completely agree with the two first issues.

Unfortunately, the first issue should really be solved by a native 
speaker, so I can't help with that. Native speakers of Mandarin do not 
seem to be common on this list ... Also, the issue is larger than that: 
if the interface is translated, but not the documentation, there is no 
community, etc., a monolingual Chinese will have a lot of difficulties.

I think the second one is related to the issue 6327 I reported 
(http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6327). Can you try with the "Ignore 
shapefile encoding" option in QGis ? This seems to revert most of the 
corrupting data issues that appeared in 1.8 and the upgrade to GDAL.

Regards,

Leyan

It is a problem of Shapely. According to the Shapely manual (
http://toblerity.github.com/shapely/manual.html
<http://toblerity.github.com/shapely/manual.html>  ):
    "A third z coordinate value may be used when constructing instances, but
has no effect on geometric analysis. All operations are performed in the x-y
plane"

Nothing prevents you, like me, to use something other with the resulting
numpy.arrays or the GeoJson representation of Shapely.

QGis is also based on GEOS.

I'm not talking about doing 3d operations, just having z level
available.  Currently it is read and copied internally (as I
experienced by exporting wkb to shapely), but not output to wkt and
others.  QgsPoint does not contain z value, but we could add a z() and
has_z() members like in shapely.  Enabling full 3d support is another
ball game entirely.

You are right, strictly speaking 3d points should be represented with
wkt POINTZ(x,y,z).

But perhaps we can be practical and allow for a simple extension?  We
could expose the z-level in the api, and *perhaps* expose it to the
wkt (since it's already exposed in the wkb).

This seems to be what is done in ogr (as it reports geometries with z values).

Using a script like:

def select_all(couche):
    couche.select([])
    couche.setSelectedFeatures([obj.id() for obj in couche])

macouche = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer()
select_all(macouche)

from shapely.wkb import loads
from shapely.geometry import shape
lignes = []
for elem in macouche.selectedFeatures():
    geom= elem.geometry()
    wkb = geom.asWkb()
    lignes.append(loads(wkb))
    list(lignes.coords)
    
You have all the elements (x,y and z) to plot your geometry in 3D with
matplotlib, visvis or others or to use the Python grass.script module to
create a 3D layer in GRASS

That's cool.  It would be cool if there was a QGIS plugin that took
the selected features and rendered them in 3D using matplotlib.... :)

In my application I display the map using qgis in two windows with a
QGraphicview .In the  excusion the card explodes and displayed outside the
QGraphicView sometimes on buttons or other places. it looks like memory
errors. But i do knew where is the problem.

Thank you a lot for your help.

and sorry for my bad english

This solution works in the Python console 

x=[]
y=[]
z=[]
for elem in macouche.selectedFeatures(): 
           geom= elem.geometry() 
           wkb = geom.asWkb() 
           x.append(loads(wkb).x)
           y.append(loads(wkb).y)
           z.append(loads(wkb).z)

*For 3d scatter points*
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d import *
import pylab as plt
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
ax.plot(x,y,z,'o')
plt.show()
or
fig = plt.figure()
ax = Axes3D(fig)
ax.scatter3D(x,y,z,c=z,cmap=plt.cm.jet)
plt.show()

<http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/file/n5004759/3dpoints.jpg> 

*and with a simple grid from the points*
from matplotlib.mlab import griddata
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
xi = np.linspace(min(x), max(x))
yi = np.linspace(min(y), max(y))
X, Y = np.meshgrid(xi, yi)
Z = griddata(x, y, z, xi, yi)
surf = ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=2, cstride=2,
cmap=cm.jet,linewidth=1, antialiased=True)
ax.scatter3D(x,y,z,c=z,cmap=plt.cm.jet)
plt.show()

<http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/file/n5004759/gridpoints.jpg> 
	
No color here because it is a  "discontinuous" surface (griddata).

I am already publishing in our WMS also the tileindex  shapefiles so people can see the image boundaries and make GetFeatureInfo queries from the image metadata that we have added to the shapefile as a few extra fields. In order to make it works we have reprojected images from their original projection zones into one common zone.

I guess also that Mapserver does not read image metadata from the geotiff image files for getting the projection but it relies on the LAYER level PROJECTION setting. In my simple test case with two images, one in EPSG:2393 and another in EPSG:2392 this means that Mapserver thinks that images are 1000 kilometers apart and sharing the EPSG:2393 system that I used in the PROJECTION block.

It would be great to see such a thing in QGIS - any way that mapserver
code could be useful to QGIS?

Or better yet - have a control in the tileindex layer to open the
associated raster layer?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Road shield labels
Message-ID: <5064B034.1040104@carto.net>

Hi,

At the qgis-user list someone has asked on how to create road-shield labels.

I came across http://linfiniti.com/2011/08/shield-labels-for-qgis/

but in current master I can't find a way to define a background shape or
background color (rectangular and not buffer).

Did this never make it into master?

I think that we should offer a way to create road shields in QGIS.

Another option would be to user marker lines and allow SVG markers to
dynamically replace text in an SVG shield for more complex US-style road
shields ...

Any ideas on how to accomplish this?


Other blog posts on the topic:
http://underdark.wordpress.com/2011/10/10/interstate-shield-styles-in-qgis/
 - but without the dynamic SVG parameter style text replacement the road
nr is sort of hard-coded ...

I am looking at implementing this as an addition to the new labeling
engine (inside QgsPalLabeling, not inside of the PAL engine, per se).
Basically, I think we can have a SVG 'shield' centered behind a label.
(I'm thinking SVG Background, not shield, even though that's what it
would be widely used for) That SVG background can also be scaled to
match the size of the label text and its rotation. If there was an X
and Y 'scale buffer' figured in, the shield would be scaled to the
size of the label plus those buffers.

Example:
US Interstate Shield with a buffers of X = 10 and Y=4 would scale
horizontally (before being rotated) to the width of the label + the 10
units (mm or map) on each side; while height-wise, there only needs to
be enough buffer to ensure the top and bottom of the shield would be
appropriately visible outside the text. The buffers would of course be
relative to the SVG background chosen.

Other options could include X/Y Offsets (offsetting the background so
the label text is over a particular 'location' in the SVG) and
Rotation (whether to rotate background with the label, or always stay
upright or at particular angle while the label text still rotates).

With the SVG as a background to the label (e.g. integrated with
QgsLabelPosition), the label manipulation tools can be used to
show/pin/move/rotate the label and background together. If the SVG
background had its own data defined values for offset and rotation, it
could be manipulated with new label background manipulation tools
(though not sure how much use that tool would be to users).

Lastly, it might be possible to also change the color of some SVG
icons (say ones with specific elements that have a known id). This
would allow the background to match other symbology colors, without
requiring the creation of a separate SVG for each color.

All of those options could be data defined as well.

I was going to start in on this project after finishing what I can
with the current updates to Advanced Labeling I have been doing. In my
opinion, SVG backgrounds would be the last need-to-have feature in
labeling before moving the entire labeling options setup to one based
upon 'styles chosen by rules'.

In that scenario, all separate labeling option groups could be saved
as styles (e.g. Text, Buffer, Placement, etc.), then rules could be
defined to select which groups of styles are applied to what features.
Then, the labeling setup could be an extension of the rule-based
symbology setup, or at least share some of its already-defined rules.
(Integrating the symbology and labeling rule-based setups might be
easier after a separate labeling rule-based setup exists.)

Once the label styles system is available, styles can be saved/loaded
from project to project.

If anyone would like to collaborate with me, or possibly mentor my
work, I would appreciate it. I understand the inner workings of the
labeling engine pretty well now (enough to attempt the SVG
backgrounds), but my C++ skills are quite new. I should be able to
start in a couple of weeks.

Regards,

Larry

Message-ID: <CAJbvKNpvBoNHY=1WLxJBR7YBLh489n77jEVG0KyOpKAGCmxxgg@mail.gmail.com>

Where I can find qml specification which is used for store symbology
information in QGIS?
I'm planning to develop convertor from *.qml to my custom format but cannot
find any information abot qml.
Tried to ask at
gis.stackexchange<http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/34361/looking-for-qml-specification>,
but no result.

Some days ago I've faced with the following problem. For example, I have
two overlapped polygons and want to draw this layer such way:
http://hub.qgis.org/attachments/4909/geoserver_sld.png Now it looks like I
cannot do it with QGIS symbology system. Screenshot which I provided above
was made in GeoServer with the following SLD configuration:

<StyledLayerDescriptor version="1.0.0" xmlns:xlink="

I tried to import this SLD into QGIS, but SLD docs containing multiple
FeatureTypeStyle are not supported yet (#6413<http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6413>
). But I think that problem is more seriously. Now in QGIS rendering
performs by features but not by layers. Try to explain it. For example we
have two symbol's layer - first with border, but without filling and second
- with filling but without border. If we try to render such layer we will
get the following result:
http://gis-lab.info/forum/download/file.php?id=5008. It is expected
beacause QGIS is used by feature rendering approach. Another approach is
using rendering by layer: first draw a layer according to the symbology of
the first level, and then second and then overlying each other. In this
case we get result as in GeoServer. I think that this approach is more
flexible, using "by layer" rendering we can get the the same result as
using "by feature" approach (in our case using one level symbology with
border and filling). Is it to makes sense to add checkbox to each symbology
layer wich will be indicate QGIS rendering system used "by layer" rendering
approach?

ArcGIS is used "by feature" approach but solves described issue by using
join operator, for example:

QGIS does already have the ability to control the rendering order of symbol
layers, and should be able to do what you need.

QGIS is used rendering order of symbol layers within features not within
layer. Try to set up layer (two overlapped polygons) symbology for getting
such result http://hub.qgis.org/attachments/4909/geoserver_sld.png. Of
course you can open the same layer twice and set up their symbology
separately, but it is not the right solution.

I can get QGIS to do what you need:

http://img6.imagebanana.com/img/uewfzlmc/Workspace1_155.png

Selected the Symbol:Fill tree item and then selected Advanced->Symbol Levels

Just enable symbols levels and it will render how you need.

Thanks, Nathan! I never used advanced options of symbology before.

 Hi Larry,

 This would be great to have in the future. Road shields in Europe are 
 typically less complex than in the use. Usually we have either simple 
 rects or circles, but having a SVG background option would be great for 
 anything more complex.

 Allowing SVG symbols to have parameterized text content (data driven) 
 would also be great. We already have parameterized fill and stroke, so 
 this would be a natural addition.

 I can't help with C++ coding, but I would certainly be available for 
 testing,

 Thanks a lot,
 Andreas

I never merged it because it was experimental and I wasnt happy with it.

I've tried to add a ticket for plugin "Add Pin" and get
"No tracker is associated to this project. Please check the Project settings."

if I have User plugins selected on the upper right corner

How do I open a ticket for this plugin that does not work (the point

Are you talking about the PinPoint plugin?
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/pinpoint

Were you logged in? Once logged in do you see a New Issue menu item?
It does appear to have a tracker but I might need to check the
permissions on who can add Issues.

Thanks,
Alex

I see the problem,

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins/issues/new doesn't exist,
you have to go the the sub-project for the specific plugin in order to
file a bug. In this case http://hub.qgis.org/projects/pinpoint is the
correct place to the file the bug in question.

The Issues link is valid though because it summarizes all sub-projects.

So I think I need to find a way to hide the New Issues for that
particular parent project.

Thanks,
Alex

Is it possible for a python plugin to get from a QgsVectorLayer
to the name of the schema containing it (if any) ?

I'm spending this friday night on a proof-of-concept topology

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Inconsistant use of VSIMalloc() / malloc() and
	VSIFree() / free()
Message-ID: <201209282245.01359.even.rouault@mines-paris.org>

Hi,

I'm running QGIS master with a GDAL trunk built with a mechanism to detect 
unbalanced use of VSIMalloc() and VSIFree().

To enable it, edit gdal/port/cpl_vsisimple.cpp and uncomment the //#define 
DEBUG_VSIMALLOC line at the beginning of the file. When this is enabled, the 
pointer returned by VSIMalloc() shouldn't be passed to free(). And if 
VSIFree() is provided a pointer allocated by malloc(), it will abort.

This is mainly usefull to detect issues on Windows : if QGIS and GDAL are 
built with different MSVC versions, the C runtimes might not be compatible, and 
a free() done in DLL A of a pointer allocated by malloc() in a DLL B might 
crash. For example, when called from QGIS, free(VSIMalloc()) or 
VSIFree(malloc()) can result in crashes.

And indeed I get crashes in QGIS when it is enabled, for example on the free() 
in qgsrasterdrawer.cpp:73

I've searched in QGIS code and I can see that several classes implement void * 
XXXXX::readBlock( int bandNo, QgsRectangle  const & extent, int width, int 
height ), but they return a buffer sometimes allocated by malloc(), or 
sometimes by VSIMalloc().

Some choice must be made ... My intuition would be that using regular malloc() 
/ free() would be better.

Basically, you would restrict the use of VSIFree() to only strings/buffers 
returned by GDAL. To avoid unnecessary changes in existing code, balanced use 
of VSIMalloc() / VSIFree() in the context of a method is OK. The real issue is 
when a method returns a void* pointer and you don't know which free function 
must be called on it.

Best regards,

Even

PS: The same holds for CPLMalloc() / CPLFree(). In the context of the above 
analysis, they can be considered as strictly equivalent to VSIMalloc() / 
VSIFree().

depends if the schema was passed when creating the
uri string used to load the layer:

QgsDataSourceURI( vl.source() ).schema()

where vl is the vector layer.

If the passed schema was empty you will get an empty string.

Uhm. So if you're using the "default schema" you won't know in
this way, right ? Well, I'll need to connect to the database
anyway so might as well query current_schema() if that's the
case. 

What's the recommended way to perform the connection ?
Anything reusable in qgis itself ?

Hi Even,
thanks for pointing this ou. Perhaps better opening a ticket, not to forget about
this? And/or adding it to coding guidelines?

I think some discussion is needed first to agree on the technical solution. 
From the headers, I see that Marco and Radim are the most active contributors 
in that area.

How do I make QgsProject available to python plugins ?
I read on API docs it's not available but I do see a qgsproject.sip
file under python/core so I'm wondering what's missing.

I'd like to use it to add layers in another project file
to the currently loaded project.

AFAIK, QgsProject already available from Python. Just use
QgsProject.instance() to access it. Maybe you mean that
some methods currently not exposed in Python API?

NameError: global name 'QgsProject' is not defined

Do I need to import anything special to get it ?
I just added a ``QgsProject.instance()`` line into
an existing plugin code... (DBManager).

Fixed by:

 from qgis.core import *

Now what I'm after is adding each of the layers defined in one project
into another one. Would "createEmbeddedLayer" do that for me ?
I do know the names of each layer in the source project.

Hi,

my opinion is that VSIMalloc/VSIFree should be used mainly by the
gdal/ogr providers, and if needed elsewhere (e.g. when calling
gdal/ogr code), but alloc/free only internally to a function/class.

Basically, following Even's recommendations.

for example, in QgsRasterDataProvider::readBlock :
  // TODO: replace VSIMalloc, it is GDAL function
  void * data = VSIMalloc( dataTypeSize( bandNo ) * width * height );
...
return data;


QgsRasterFileWriter makes much use of VSIMalloc/VSIFree but that's
probably ok, because its use seems to be limited to internal use and
passed to QgsRasterIterator, but freed locally

However, QgsRasterFileWriter::writeImageRaster uses VSIMalloc()
followed by CPLFree() - is that ok?

Even - did you try to save a raster (using new raster save as dialog)
with your modifications?


On the other hand, it could go the other way around - make sure that
all frees are using VSIFree() instead of free().

Even - what are the fundamental advantages of using VSIMalloc()
instead of malloc()?


cheers,
Etienne

This is even not needed for code that interact with GDAL/OGR. GDAL/OGR 
functions that take memory buffers just works fine with whatever memory 
allocator you want (malloc, new[], etc...)

The only requirement is that VSIFree( ) *must* be used to free a pointer 
allocated by GDAL, to make sure that the CRT used for free() matches the CRT 
used for malloc().

You didn't finish your sentence here. So I suppose you meant that the TODO 
should be implemented by replacing VSIMalloc() by malloc() ?

Yes, CPLFree(VSIMalloc()) is OK

The difference between VSIMalloc() and CPLMalloc() is that CPLMalloc() calls 
internally VSIMalloc() and aborts if the allocation fails. Thus CPLMalloc() 
never returns a NULL pointer and is only meant for very small allocations that 
shouldn't fail. My personnal opinion on this is that it should be completely 
avoided and replaced by VSIMalloc() with a proper check of the return value.

VSIFree() and CPLFree() are the same: in port/cpl_conv.h : "#define CPLFree 
VSIFree"

I didn't do any modification yet. With the memory allocation debugging enabled, 
QGIS just crashes when opening a raster, so I couldn't test saving ;-)

That's one possibility, but I was wondering if there are other raster 
providers than GDAL. In that case, they are unlikely to allocate with 
VSIMalloc().

> instead of malloc()?

Basically none, from the application's point of view when GDAL is compiled 
with default options.

For the purpose of GDAL developement, VSIMalloc() / VSIFree() are interesting, 
because they can be instrumented to provide debugging and statistics 
facilities. For example, if you enable both DEBUG_VSIMALLOC and 
DEBUG_VSIMALLOC_STATS, you get the following report at the end of each process 
using GDAL :

Current VSI memory usage        : 0 bytes
Maximum VSI memory usage        : 23781 bytes
Number of calls to VSIMalloc()  : 770
Number of calls to VSICalloc()  : 0
Number of calls to VSIRealloc() : 235
Number of calls to VSIFree()    : 770
VSIMalloc + VSICalloc - VSIFree : 0

This is a cheap way of tracking most memory leaks with quite unnoticeable 
slowdown. When DEBUG_VSIMALLOC is enabled, there's also a check in VSIFree() 
to detect that the pointer passed is valid (i.e. allocated by VSIMalloc()) and 
to detect double-frees. A kind of poor man's "valgrind --leak-check=full" to 
sum it up ;-) For my developement activities in GDAL, I enable that all the 
time.

Of course, other applications can benefit from that by using 
VSIMalloc()/VSIFree(). But you must be very carefull to correctly pair 
VSIMalloc() with VSIFree(), and malloc() with free() : any other combination 
will lead to chaos.

I've spent hours on trying to expose createEmbeddedLayer but
had no luck and now giving up (no more fun for me).

When I uncommented the createEmbeddedLayer method in the
qgsproject.sip file, the sip compiler complained with:

 unsupported function argument type - provide %MethodCode and a valid C++ signature

Since I didn't so many %MethodCode used I tried (unsuccessfully)
to provide a %MappedType in conversions.hpp instead.

If anyone has further pointers I might get back on the issue.

Message-ID: <50671B65.4080000@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
It is quite evident that QGIS ecosystem, and the speed of development, is rapidly
expanding. Obviously this is a most welcome news. I notice that it is happening that
more and more often our paths are crossing, and the potential for duplicating work is
high.
I would therefore invite everybody to share their plans very early in development, to
reduce this risk and pool the available resources.
All the best.

I was just quoting the code, where it says "TODO: replace VSIMalloc",
it probably means using malloc instead, because VSIMalloc is a GDAL
function

There is grass provider as well as wcs (but it uses GDAL also).
The Grass raster provider does not use any VSI stuff, but the generic
QgsRasterDataProvider class does use it.

Maybe Radim can comment better on how the VSI stuff is used outside of
gdal provider, notably in the src/core/raster files.

thanks for the info. In regard of this, it might be worth using this
for raster stuff (exclusively) with extra care.

My advice would be stick to VSIMalloc()/VSIFree() where it is for now,
and correct for free() errors.  And come policy must be established
and added to the guidelines.

Etienne

Subject: [Qgis-developer] visualizing 3D data (Z values) or data with z
	attribute: a solution
Message-ID: <1348957057151-5005360.post@n6.nabble.com>

After the post of Etienne Tourigny about "Using/visualizing 3D data (Z
values)", I realized that it was relatively easy from the Python console
with matplotlib or visvis (new pure Python library for visualization of 1D
to 4D data,  http://code.google.com/p/visvis/
<http://code.google.com/p/visvis/>  ).

*1) 3D shapefile*
 *a) with matplotlib.meshgrid*
With a 3d point shapefile, the *shapely* module makes it very easy to
extract the z coordinate:

from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d import *
import pylab as plt
from matplotlib import cm
from matplotlib.mlab import griddata
import numpy as np
from shapely.wkb import loads 
x=[]
y=[]
z=[]
for elem in layer.selectedFeatures(): 
           geom= elem.geometry() 
           wkb = geom.asWkb() 
           x.append(loads(wkb).x)
           y.append(loads(wkb).y)
           z.append(loads(wkb).z)

now, with the x,y,z coordinates, we can build a grid/surface with the
matplotlib.meshgrid function

xi = np.linspace(min(x), max(x))
yi = np.linspace(min(y), max(y))
X, Y = np.meshgrid(xi, yi)
Z = griddata(x, y, z, xi, yi) 

and draw it in a 3D matplotlib window
fig = plt.figure()
ax = Axes3D(fig)
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=5, cstride=5, cmap=cm.jet,linewidth=1,
antialiased=True)
plt.show()
<http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/file/n5005360/splinematplotlib.jpg> 

It is also possible to plot the points or the contours in 3D
<http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/file/n5005360/contourpts.jpg> 


*with visvis*
import visvis
visvis.plot(x,y,z, lc='k', ls='', mc='g', mw=2, lw=2, ms='.')
visvis.surf(xi, yi, Z)
<http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/file/n5005360/splinevisvis.jpg> 

*b) with splines algorithms from scipy*
It is also possible to use other interpolation algorithms like the spline
interpolation class  BivariateSpline
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.BivariateSpline>  
of scipy

*with matplotlib*

import scipy as sp
from scipy.interpolate import SmoothBivariateSpline
spl = SmoothBivariateSpline(x,y,z)
# construction of the grid/surface
x = np.array(x)
y = np.array(y)
xn, yn = sp.mgrid[x.min():x.max():50j,y.min():y.max():50j]
zspline = spl( xn[:,0], yn[0,:])
fig = plt.figure()
ax = Axes3D(fig)
ax.plot_surface(xn, yn, zspline)
plt.show()

*with visvis*

import visvis
visvis.surf(xn,yn,zspline)

*2) shapefile with z attribute*
This is the same thing, but we must use the values ??of the attribute

*Conclusions and a plugin ?*
Build a plugin seems a priori to me very complex and time consuming 
- plot 3 d points is easy.
- but in other cases, all the scenarios (3D shapefile points, lines or
polygons, shapefile with z attribute, interpolation algorithm, ...)  should
be considered before
- you need modules like shapely or matplotlib

I do not have much time to write a plugin and personally I'm very happy with
the Python console, sorry.

Then, If somebody else wants to go,I can help
