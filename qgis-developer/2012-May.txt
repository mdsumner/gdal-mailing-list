i have asked this question before but nobody replied to me;

am using c++ and qtcreator, i dont know if it is possible to get the map
tiles through qgis lib;

or shall i create my own method to get the appropriate tiles according to
zoom level x and y;

my tiles is stored locally as shown below;

*-5-(zoom level 5)*
*-->20 (x)
    -->18.png (y)
-->21 (x)
   -->18.png (y)*

*-6-(zoom level 6)*
*-->41 (x)
    -->36.png (y)
-->42 (x)
   -->36.png (y)*
*-7-* *(zoom level 7)*

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python coding style for QGIS
Message-ID: <CALuHMPDtyVLZ53kqZCphEtbrKP0gT+Haoab36Ghu3YcoXs8p=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

we already have coding style for QGIS C++ code [0]. But in QGIS core
there are also several Python plugins which have a different coding style.
I think we need to create coding style for Python code included in master
and reformat existing code to comply with this style.

There is a PEP-0008 [1], an official Python style guide, not sure if we
should use it as is. Maybe it is better to adopt it a bit and make more
consistent with our C++ coding style.

I would suggest that we use PEP8 - many editors will parse this and
there are checking tools that can be run from the command line. I
would also suggest we use 4 space indents so we can process code using
pyindent. I know it isnt very consistent with QGIS C++ coding standard
but many python coders are used to these standards and they are easy
to check and enforce.

I think it would be great to extend our CODING doc to include python
guidelines. I have already worked on similar guidelines for another
project [1] which we could easily adapt.

+1 for using PEP8 as more tools and projects use it.
I don't think the c++ consistency it is a problem : different language, 
different coding standards.

+1 for PEP8. It'd be easy to publish command line options for pyLint
in the developer docs.

Hi,

I'm new to the list and after reading through some of the archives I don't
believe that anyone else has started working on something like this.

I have thought that a training program or set of classes would be an
excellent addition to the QGIS Community.  After reading through portions
of the QGIS manual, I believe that this would be an excellent basis for
developing an interactive curriculum that can continually be added to as
new features and concepts become available, and mature.

An excellent tool that is available for presenting curriculum is an open
source and free web based platform called Moodle.  I would like to
volunteer to develop a basic curriculum based on the User Manual, and make
this available for free to anyone that is interested.  Eventually adding
more advanced content containing a wide array of topics on GIS.  Also
providing Certificates of Completion for courses that can then be applied
towards the educational component of the GISP certification.  I know that
there is a pretty steep learning curve for any GIS and I would like a way
to ease QGIS users through the 220+ page user manual.

I think that educating users in a structured, and accessible format is the
best way to advance QGIS to take it's rightful place as an industry
standard GIS application.  Do you have any thoughts on this?

Excellent Thank you Marco! This would definitely fall under QGIS
Certification, and this would be a set of self study training courses.  For
each course completed an have a smaller examination and certificate of
completion.  What I am envisioning is a group of courses that once
completed would prepare a person for each certification level.  I saw that
the curricula is already defined for the entry level courses, is this
correct and does anyone know where this is located?

-Thank you

Some of you may know this, but I have incorporated a style/coding checker
into my soon-to-be-released Plugin Editor plugin. It currently checks
against PEP8.py and an embedded version of Pylint.

I have also made several design decisions regarding PEP compliance and
general coding style. I would very much like any input on these decisions,
with regards to anticipated coding standards.

1) The default (smallest) size of the editor window is ~83 characters, with
an edge line at 80, depending upon font and zoom level used. I am releasing
the editor with 3 free fonts tested to ensure correct sizing across
platforms. By default, I hope this helps plugin developers keep their code
under 80 characters [0].

2) The PEP8.py checker is used 'as is,' while the Pylint setup's pylintrc
has been augmented to allow mixed case methods, etc., often found in PyQt
development. I have provided the default pylintrc, the augmented one and a
diff below [1]. I would appreciate any other changes to the pylintrc_pyqt I
can incorporate for QGIS plugin coding standards.

3) There is currently an error with Pylint (and or PyQt) where Pylint
chokes if PyQt4.QtCore is imported before QtGui. I am currently
recommending that QtGui's import is placed first to avoid the flaw [2].

Having run all of the core and many user plugins through the checkers, one
item sticks out every time: line length. Practically no plugin file keeps
within the 79 character line PEP standard. My only suggestion is that for
QGIS standards, a more 'modern' line length cap might be considered. Maybe
100 or even 120? Or should the 79 char style be adhered to?

Hi all.
I see that there are 5 issues marked as Blocker: how are we going to
deal with them? What is the date currently expected for release?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi all!
I just wantedd to inform you that the new about box seems to work well ;)

Richard, J?rgen, I think that was a really good idea to motivate

Message-ID: <CADzbtTLKPgt_d14wfhvG29ZeXqskrdd4SeKfCQch17yFgxUjqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I'm trying to follow a qgis development tutorial I've found on qgis site
(the coding and compilation guide). This document is targeting version 1.6
'Copiap?'. I'm trying to use qgis-devel package I've installed on my fedora
16 linux box inside eclipse indigo. Al packages I've installed come from
fedora official repositories. Qgis is versioned as 1.7.x

Maybe I'm facing a trivial question.

I'm trying to build a simple application similar to that described in
'Creating C++ Application' chapter.

The example code cites:

...
#include <qgsapplication.h>
...

The build gives an error located in qgis include files:
qgsapplication.h includes Qt application class via this include statement:

...
#include <QApplication>

eclipse is complaining that QApplication can't be found. I'm not able to
locate such a file on my filesystem.

What am I missing?

It seems that qgis-devel and Qt installed on my machine are not in sync, or
that I'm missing some step in building my application due to the fact that
I'm new to Qt and qgis development.

Any kind of help is kindly wellcome.

Best regards.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems with gdal and hdf files
Message-ID: <CAG4NReKdey50Pq7weit3N78OKia_WXwunoGOfzp+kY+GYMyLYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

The gdal info of a multiband satellite image in hdf is reported by
gdal as "Size is 512, 512"
in contradiction with the size of the subdatasets. QGIS and R
(raster+rgdal) report an error at opening the file,
while envi and HDFLook can open it with no problem. I include the
gdalinfo output and the
info reported by HDFLook. Any help appreciated.
Thanks

Hello, sorry for late answer.

I examined the possibility to remove rpy2 from HR plugin. Still I am
unsure on how to exchange data between R and QGIS. QGIS could write a
temporary file with input data, that R would read. But it would be
unnecessary disk usage, and will be slow in case of hundreds of points.

I would prefer to restore rpy2 functionality, also for benefit of
other users, and I am willing to support its re-packaging.

Thanks to financial support from T4E s.r.l http://www.t4e.it/
I could implement WCS support based on GDAL WCS driver.

It is available here: https://github.com/blazek/Quantum-GIS branch wcs

Because of WCS 1.1 bugs in GDAL (wrong axis order in bbox for latlong,
no way to specify response CRS) and Mapserver (ignores  RangeSubset)
we have to stick with WCS 1.0 but capabilities parser for 1.1 is
ready.

It was written with possible use of common base classes for W*S in
mind: new classes QgsOWSConnection, QgsOWSSourceSelect.

Open issues:
- How to pass the raster to GDAL Tools. Currently the XML string is
created on the fly by GDAL provider and passed as a string to
GDALOpen, there is no XML file which could be given to GDAL Tools.
- How to specify an extent and resolution in GDAL Tools.
- How to implement save a copy of WCS part

Related:
I believe that it could be better to organize OWS by servers instead
of by services, especially in the browser. Instead of adding a new
connection for each service, user could add just one generic OWS
connection and available services would appear under that connection
in the tree. I have implemented this in OWS meta provider. It reads
and combines all defined WMS, WFS and WCS connections and displays all
available layers (if there are few) or  services under the connection:

please consider rewriting it as a sextante module, could be an easier

I don't consider that to be a problem. The size reported on a GDAL dataset that
is only made of subdatasets (that is to say when the dataset has no raster bands
in itself, which is the case here) has no meaning, and is put to a default value
of 512x512. You have to open the subdatasets to know their size(in the case of
HDF4, the description of the subdataset also give them). There are cases where
the subdsatasets have different sizes, so it would be impossible to set a
significant value for the size of the dataset.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bye bye SPIT?
Message-ID: <CALCNqkbhu_i3CcXBR2VGT=p_xuoPW_vY6CGpV1KBJBTx0LDs9w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

At the hackfest it was proposed to remove SPIT since it's
functionality is present in the DBManager (along with a lot of other
nice functionality). Does anyone have objections to me removing it
before 1.8 is released?

Thanks

No objections from me.

But I also want suggest to remove from fTools "Select by Location"
tool because we have more powerful Spatial Query plugin in core

You are right. I was confusing bands and subdatasets.
The following does not work:
$ gdal_translate -b 4  lndsr.L5169054_05420101216.hdf test.tif
Input file contains subdatasets. Please, select one of them for reading.

The following works:
$ gdal_translate -sds lndsr.L5169054_05420101216.hdf test.tif
which results in test.tif1 to test.tif9 (probably should be test1.tif
to test9.tif)

but there is no way to actually select 1 or more specific subdatasets

The most important
QGIS complains:
Cannot get GDAL raster band:

R (raster) complains
> r <- brick("lndsr.L5169054_05420101216.hdf")
Error in .rasterObjectFromFile(x, objecttype = "RasterBrick", ...) :
  Cannot create a RasterLayer object from this file.
In addition: Warning message:
In .rasterFromGDAL(x, band = band, objecttype, ...) :
  GeoTransform values not available; georeferencing will not be correct
>

but GDALinfo() is correct.
Cannot test hdf5 or readGDAL() in R as the file is huge

I guess the problem is in QGIS (and R package raster)? I'm not sure,
as I do not know if
subdatasets can be selected for reading using gdal.

It is possible to select one subdataset. You must use the name reported in the
lines that contain SUBDATASET_XXX_NAME. For example :

gdal_translate HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:"lndsr.L5169054_05420101216.hdf":Grid:band1
out.tif

I think support for selecting subdatasets has been added in QGIS 1.8 (I haven't
tested myself, just a vague feeling of having seen a commit message about that)

You can likely directly provide the subdataset name instead of the dataset name.
Not sure if R exposes a way of getting the subdataset names from the dataset.

same thing if you use the extended file syntax (e.g.
HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:"lndsr.L5169054_05420101216.hdf":Grid:band1 ) .

You can probably work around this limitation by creating a vrt file
with gdalbuildvrt

pass the vrt file you created to R, it should work as long as gdalinfo
works on that vrt file, although I have never tried it.

Also see if you can load the vrt file in qgis!

Is there a way to programmatically get QGIS network proxy configuration ?
Thanks.

I guess the only downside to that is that SEXTANTE would not be able
to use it (it seems to have an ftools integration). Perhaps we should
wait till next release, move the Spatial Query tool into analysis and
create bindings for it?

Hi,
About removing SPIT:
Yesterday I imported a large shapefile (which was not even loaded in QGIS) into postgis using the GUI from SPIT; I can't find a way to do so with the DB manager.

Now you say it I remember seeing a video (yours?) about this, but anyway it does not work for me (status bar complains about pyspatialite missing). I followed the following guide but failed to install it (Ubuntu 11.04):
http://blog.spatialclastics.com/2011/10/spatialite-and-python-on-ubuntu.html

SPIT only needs shp2psql which is easier to get (provided with postgis). So unless easy support for pyspatialite is guaranteed for all platforms, SPIT might still be useful to someone, no?

shp2pgsql is a quite cumbersome to install on win, pyspatialite should
be a requirement anyway for qgis 1.8

   Afaik SPIT only needs libpq.so/dll (which is used by QGIS anyway). It 
does not use shp2pgsql.

You can just drag & drop a layer from the browser onto a schema in
dbmanager. Guiseppe maybe we need an explicit menu for this as the
interactions are not always obvious?

oh, yes, you're right - it's PostGIS Manager that requires shp2pgsql,
not SPIT.
one of the reasons I'm not happy using SPIT is that it preserves
UppeLowerCase of the columns, making queries more cumbersome to write.
Anyway, I think we should start avoiding the "drunkman syndrome", with
many things doubled in QGIS.
All the best.

Removing SPIT is also ok for me.

+1 to remove SPIT!

Very nice the drag & drop, but why not use a classic file dialog, too??
(perhaps is it a future feature?)

Message-ID: <B398947DCAB85D46809151E678999F210576ACA3@srv01.NPA.LOCAL>

Can anyone else confirm this?

If I have a table with no geometry in my QGIS project, when I push the
Zoom Full button it zooms out further than the extent of the layers with
geometry.

If I remove the layer without geometry, the Zoom Full works as expected.

My mistake.
Sure, duplication of tools is bad. But removing SPIT would mean removing the *only* (correct?) QGIS GUI tool to load shapefiles into postgis without external dependencies. Do we want to get read of this before putting it in DB manager?

The same with me (beside the fact that I just learned howto use SPIT
(thanks Horst)) it seems much more clearer to me using SPIT than using
the dbmanager (for now) ..
Don't get me wrong .. dbmanager is great but as long as SPIT is more
intuitive (maybe because it just does ONE thing) I'd like to wait with
removing it until a filedialog import has been implemented that
creates something like the batch upload which you currently see when
you add more than one shapefile ..
But I am quite sure guiseppe will have that soon :)

So..
- -1 from me for removing it right now (and probably think about the
dependencies too which mayeul pointed out)

Beside that ..
What about creating hints for obsolete plugins that are getting
removed with a hint that the function has been
integrated/extended/moved to "the new plugin" .. or maybe a hint
inside the plugin that this will become obsolete soon because the
function will be available in core/new-plugin-name.

marking plugins like that for at least one "official"-release-period
will probably easen the migration for the user too..

kind regards
Werner

Hi all.
Following the decision taken during the Lyon HackFest, we now have a new
initiative, branded "QGIS friendly courses". The idea is to list on QGIS
website all the courses that will promise to donate either development
time or money for the well-being of the project. We aim at promoting
fair competition, and generating consciousness among users, that can
contribute to the improvement of the very tool they are learning by
choosing an appropriate course.
Details on:
http://www.qgis.org/en/sponsorship/qgis-friendly-courses.html
All the best.

-1 from me.  IMO leave it for 2.0 release.  Maybe add a message into the
SPIT dialog that says "I will be removed in the next release by learn to
use X to upload into PostGIS"

I have never had issues with uploading layers into postgis using SPIT
however on the other had dbmanger still feels very touch and go with if it
will work or not.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SEXTANTE - using calculator tools from SAGA and
	GRASS
Message-ID: <1335990160.946.YahooMailNeo@web164505.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to use the calculator tools both from SAGA and GRASS in SEXTANTE, and both are giving me errors.

For example, making the difference between two rasters in SAGA, with Grid Difference module, all runs ok.

Calculating the difference between the same rasters, but with Grid Calculator module, gives me an error. Looking at the log files, I noticed that the only difference is in the name of the input files, that in the case of Grid Difference uses the .sgrd temporary files, and in the case of Grid Calculator uses the name of the input files, which I put in the formula:

In the?module?interface it's necessary to choose files for all fields (amap, bmap, cmap, dmap, emap, fmap), but in this case I just need the first and the second, because this calculation only involve two raster files. Could this be the source of the error?

Thank you very much!

For me http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5327 has needs to be fixed before the
release.  In it's current state it renders editing polylines and
polygons useless and frustrating.  This would not be good such a otherwise
good release.

Hi Folks

I guess we can revisit this for 2.0 and I will leave both spit and
dbmanager in place for now.

the issues tagged as blockers can be reached using the query linked on
the right in redmine

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=23

beside the node tool issue there are other two regressions and a ticket
about the need to update licence files.

There is also a ticket about a regression in the print composer: since
1.7.x there is an issue when printing large formats on win32. This is
not a new/recently discovered issue, so it should not be a blocker as it
was decided in Lyon, but nevertheless I would like you dev to consider
try fix it in time for 1.8 as it affects *many* users.

cheers

That should be as simple as:

Ok, so in relation to SAGA Grid Calculator, I think the mistake was mine. The syntax to use in the formula to refer the layers is g1, g2, ..., gn, from the top to the bottom of the list of "Multiple selection" rasters.

Remains the question about GRASS r.mapcalculator.

Thank you and sorry for the noise about SAGA Grid Calculator!

importing into PG databases doesn't requires pyspatialite, you
only need psycopg2 and if I understand well you already have it..

Please, could you give more info about the error you get?

Pedro

SAGA calculator does not work like that

To include a raster layer in the formula you have to use  single
letters (a is the first one, "b" is the second one...), but not using
the names of the layers that you see in QGIS

I guess that we need more documentation for algorithms, or the user
should have a good knowledge of external tools like this...

As discussed we will hold the release for the blockers (but strict
criteria must be applied as to what can be a blocker). I still need to
update the whats new etc text before we can get final translations
call in. I hope to get that done over the next week or so.

Perhaps Giovanni, it would be good also to do that 'weekly blockers'
post to the dev list to bring the key issues to the lists attention?

Thanks Martin

Bernhard - I don't think your problem is unique - I have also been trying to do the same thing and spent a long time looking through the docs (particularly the API for QgsVectorLayer) to find the solution. I think one problem is that I was looking for something like "Query" as in the qgis layer, but it is named differently in the docs. 

Now I am looking to make a layer invisible (i.e. click the cross next to the layer in qgis, but keep the layer). Again I am finding it difficult - maybe set in the MapCanvas or Registry?

Hi,

According to

QGIS Server now comes with WFS functionality. Is there some place with

Hi Anita,

in the project properties the WFS tab become "OWS" and if the project
has vectors in it you can check the ones you may want to publish also as
WFS.

cheers

Thanks Ian,

yes I often have to check several classes to find a certain api 
functionality (and sometimes I do not find it). No idea how to improve this.

Someone can test if this issue affects also the code freezed for 1.8? If
yes please file a ticket and -as it is a regression- tag it as
"blocker".

OK, I found the answer to my sub question:

iface.legendInterface().setLayerVisible(vlayer,False)

This time I found the answer from this link:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/1731/how-to-toggle-layer-visibility-in-qgis-using-python

But QgsLegendInterface is not referenced in QgsVectorLayer or QgsMapLayer...

Will stop complaining now and get on with programming, sorry.

Can you check that you are indeed using the legend to manage render order?

That was the problem.

I never set QGIS to change from rendering using the legend. 

Is there a reason this might have changed on its own?

Hi Victor,

Thanks for your reply!

Yes, I think after the initial stabilization of the Sextante, it would be good to work in the documentation and, for example, include a help menu for the SAGA (and or other libraries) similar to the GRASS one, and the GRASS help might be adapted to the specifics of Sextante.

Regarding to the SAGA Grid Calculator, apparently it works the same way with a, b, c, ... and with g1, g2, g3, ..., from the top to the bottom of the Multiple Selection window.

However, it seems I found a strange pattern that looks like a bug.
If you make a simple calculation (a*2) when a single raster layer is selected (in the Multiple Selection window), the result appears to be resampled and the extent increases. 
However, if the same calculation is done, but selecting an even number of layers (2, 4, 6, ...), the result is shown well, with the original raster extent and without resampled values. When selecting an odd number of layers (1, 3, 5, ...), the extent increases by a half of the pixel size and pixel values appears to be resampled.

I created a short screencast that shows this behavior: http://goo.gl/Noflw 

Making the same operation directly in SAGA, there is no problem, as can be seen in this animated gif: http://goo.gl/LtRFc

Can anyone confirm? Should I fill a ticket?

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Pedro

SAGA calculator does not work like that

To include a raster layer in the formula you have to use? single
letters (a is the first one, "b" is the second one...), but not using
the names of the layers that you see in QGIS

I guess that we need more documentation for algorithms, or the user
should have a good knowledge of external tools like this...

It has happened to me once or twice but I assumed it was wild clicking
on the wrong thing by myself rather than a particular bug. If you
think it is a bug, try to find a way to reproduce it so we can try to
fix it.

Hi

 >There is also a ticket about a regression in the print composer: since
 >1.7.x there is an issue when printing large formats on win32

I've just tried to print to A0 with QGIS 1.6 on win7 (64bit, but QGIS 
compiled on WoW 32 bit) and got the crash. For me, it looks like a 
memory problem, not like a regression.

Some more observations:

-QGIS on win7 compiled with msvc 64 bit: printing to A0 works
-Linux 64bit: printing to A0 works (I remember it worked on 32bit Linux 
too, probably because gcc is able to use more memory than msvc 32bit).
- No problem on Mac 64bit

Also, I don't recall larger changes in the print composer that could be 
related (but maybe in core components of QGIS and in the Qt libs?).

So the resolution is to use a 64bit compiled executable on Windows. 
Since at Sourcepole, we need to have a 64bit win version ready for our 
clients, we will also provide a public download for 1.8.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <CAPzumuGWCGZ9rUEWoym4+HAKStAQj7LO5JrCJiRZtdHeqrqzbg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear devs,

What are the immediate plans to integrate terrain/dem tools?
Currently we have several terrain tools available (Raster Terrain
Modelling plugin, GdalTools, GRASS, Sextante).
I am currently preparing a howto on terrain analysis for newbies and I
am evaluating which of the above plugin to introduce.  Perhaps if
there are plans to integrate, I might as well introduce them to the
plugin the will eventually "survive" the integration.

Thanks!

To: qgis-user <qgis-user@lists.osgeo.org>


Currently we have two terrain analysis plugin, one for as a core
plugin (Raster Terrain Modelling) and the other in GdalTools
(gdaldem).

The Raster Terrain Modelling has 4 analysis algorithm (slope, aspect,
ruggedness, total curvature) and has simpler UI (analysis type, input,
output, output format). ?On the other hand, gdaltools' dem analysis
has more algorithms (hillshade, slope, aspect, color-relief, TRI, TPI,
roughness) and parameter switches (i.e. for Slope, scale factor).

I tested the generation of both plugin on the same DEM and I got
different results. ?Visually inspecting the map, the results looks
very similar. ?But the data stats while not very divergent, are
different, see below.

$ gdalinfo -hist slope_terrainplugin.tif
<snip>
?Metadata:
? ?STATISTICS_MAXIMUM=88.384605407715
? ?STATISTICS_MEAN=10.562942081774
? ?STATISTICS_MINIMUM=0
? ?STATISTICS_STDDEV=10.476060265591

$ gdalinfo -hist slope_gdalplugin.tif

?Metadata:
? ?STATISTICS_MAXIMUM=87.754096984863
? ?STATISTICS_MEAN=10.702959382095
? ?STATISTICS_MINIMUM=0
? ?STATISTICS_STDDEV=10.367163780773

I'm asking here for experience of people in using the two plugins,
which of the two has better results in your analysis? ?FWIW, you can
also include GRASS' r.slope.aspect in the comparison.

Hi Maning

The discussion is open. I'm of course biased towards the raster terrain 
plugin (and plan to support it also in the future).

The raster terrain plugin has some new functions in 1.8:
- hillshade
- relief creation algorithm (see 
http://www.sourcepole.com/2012/1/16/shaded-relief-maps-with-qgis)
- z factor (to handle lat/long datasources)

Planned in future is the possibility to give output options (e.g. 
compression).

Regards,
Marco

Hello!

Just an idea, which came to my mind...

Mhmm, maybe, now with sextante, it would also be good to consider the 
"old" idea of the "ecological toolbox 
(http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Ecology_Tools): I had not the time 
and possibility to look at the sextante plugin yet, but I think from 
what I have read, this would be a good basis for implementing such a 
ecological toolbox...

On the page quoted above, there are some questions (just paraphrased here):

- Identify the most common operations and algorithms
- Find a comfortable way to distribute it (customised QGIS? toolbox? 
separated plugins? library?)

I think the second one could be answered with "sextante"...
As I am no developer, just a user, please correct me if I am 
wrong...maybe somebody else had this idea already and/or is it just 
plain obvious...

just some thoughts...

Albin

IMHO it's just a matter of developing sextante models, chaining the
commands to obtain the most common analytical workflows. Then we should
find a way of distributing and sharing custom models (ticket open).
Ideas, and especially help, most welcome.
All the best.

right, this is what it is reported in the tickets. The problem surfaces
only on win32. I also made a few tests months ago (see the ticket) but
for me as for other users qgis 1.6 seemed to work fine (but maybe it was
a matter of the size/weight of the project).

ok, then can we close the ticket? What about also adding a warning when
a user on win tries to print a large format?


cheers

yes, as discussed in Lyon I will do that. Meanwhile I already removed
the "blocker" tag to the printing issue and I believe that ticket about
licence files can be closed.

A similar methodology could apply to developing the related Hydrological toolbox (http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Hydrology_and_Hydraulic_modelling). I would also be interested in contributing to such a toolbox and using any available models. 

I am wary of writing plugin code (as I have started to do) when someone else may have produced or know of plugins that have useful functionality for water related modelling or, in particular, analysing and mixing GIS layers for a catchment management tool.

Ian

Agreed, it is reasonable to add a warning for win32 (though I need to 
make a few experiments to figure out the pixel limit that works).

Hi,

Some new observations I've made.

In the example I used yesterday, the raster input was float32.

I tested now with a Int16 raster input and found that the problems are even greater. On one hand, the rasters are coming out of the Grid Calculator float32. Secondly, the extent is always changed, and the resample is always applied, irrespective of whether an odd or even number of layers.

Screencast: http://goo.gl/A1ccn? 

Using the SAGA GUI, the rasters are also converted to float32, but the Extent is preserved and the resample is not applied.

Screencast: http://goo.gl/ZJhnv? 

I did these tests on Windows 7 and Debian Wheezy, with the same results.

If someone wants to try to replicate, the original data are from FaunaliaPT and Professor Gon?alves from University of Porto.

Hi Radim

Nice to have a WCS client in QGIS!

If it goes via GDAL WCS driver, how does it work with Proxies (via 
libcurl?) Some poor users are sitting behind proxies, so it would be 
nice if the proxy settings from the options are applied to WCS client as 
well.

Marco

Hi all,

I get

The instructions do not say anything about building GEOS and PROJ.4
with Visual Studio (but there are instruction for building GEOS with

Thanks for your help

The resampling is automatically done, so you can use layers that do
not match (which cannot be done in saga). However, if grids do match,
maybe I should implement some mechanism to avoid the resampling.

Let me test those layers and I will tell you what is going on, ok?

Thanks again!

Yup - I sort of silently introduced that - Jurgen and Tim have been
helpful in commiting and some testing.

Like it? It also opens other zip files, depending on the options you
choose in the Preferences (first tab, at the bottom)
Try it out in the browser, you can browse zips with various files.

Wow. I had not noticed that feature of the new browser either. I was
happily surprised when I found that the layer's ZIP URI is auto-accessed on
project load. This is going to save a LOT of disk space. Nice work!

It seems I had overlooked the osgeo4w /include and /lib directories,
which contain all the necessary libs.

However, how can things be setup so that cmake looks for all
dependencies in the osgeo4w directory, instead of specifying each one
manually?

Hi all.
Now that we moved to rst, I think it would be good to suggest tools to
edit it, to make life easier for prospective doc writers. I'm using vim
because it nicely highlights rst syntax, but this is probably not the
most convenient tool for everybody.
Does anybody know if there is a graphical text editor with rst syntax
highlighting? I have searched a (little) bit, without success.
All the best.

I just hope use of "graphical text editors" won't drive people into
extending their lines behind 80 columns, or start line ending wars.

Hello,

*For online*
For this, you can take a look on this online app http://rst.ninjs.org/
You can also think about embed in a custom online app a call to this kind
of api http://rst.projectfondue.com/

*For Desktop*
You can use Enthought editor available on
https://github.com/enthought/rested. It depends from ets (entought) and ets
need python-vtk.
After you install it, type "rested" in command line

Regards

ThomasG

Thanks Thomas. I cannot see a Debian package, am I wrong?

that's the same problem with the WMS provider, there isn't a way to
get the GetMapUrl... and parsing the metadata string is not a good
option :)

I think all the providers should have a method to get useful props,
so plugins can get those kind of provider-specific information,
something like:
QVariant QgsDataProvider::getProperty(QString)

Any reason to not doing it?

Nathan: thanks for the link, but it's outdated (e.g. no gedit3 support
for rst, unfortunately), and I think it will be confusing for newbies.
Are we going to select suggest a couple of tools for our writers?
For now the simplest options seem vim and retext, right?
All the best.

Hi

Are you sure you are launching cmake from in an osgeo4w shell? If you
do that everything should *just work*. Also you should be able to set
a LIB_DIR env var and the cmake find rules will look there for libs.
So normally you should not need to tweak much in cmake other than
fixing the paths for gnu utils.

Regards

Tim

@Salvatore - ReText has a very nice live preview. Fails on sphinx docs
right now, though.

Currently, I use Eric4, which offers syntax-highlighting via Pygments
package for rst. Since I am reimplementing many features of Eric4's text
editor in my Plugin Editor plugin, it also offers highlighting for rst
files, directly from within QGIS [0]. It looks like I could incorporate
ReText (since it is PyQt-based, and just a single file) into Plugin Editor,
as well (maybe second release). I'll have a beta release of Plugin Editor
ready within the next week or so.

Cool! So perhaps we could edit the manual directly from qgis, perhaps adding screenshots on the fly, etv?

Hi,

I got it working last night when running form the osgeo4w shell (my
mistake), but there were still a number of missing entries which I had
to add (which are also installed by osgeo4w)

PROJ_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND
SPATIALINDEX_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND
SPATIALINDEX_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND
SPATIALITE_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND
SQLITE3_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND

I tried adding LIB_DIR to both the osgeo script and as a CMake entry,
to no avail.

Thanks
Etienne

thanks
Etienne

You also need to install those dev libs from osgeo4w. I had to set the proj
lib path manually.
I'm out of home, as soon as I'll be back to my pc I can share my notes.
In the meanwhile I can only confirm that the build procedure for MSVC works
fine for all the qgis components (also python bindings).

Yes I did install them beforehand, the point is that they were not
detected automatically.

The spatialindex stuff is rather new (I thinks\), so there might need
to be some improvements in the cmake files for Windows.
Same for others which have been around for some time (proj,spatialite,sqlite)

this is really super cool, thanks!

just noticed one thing, if the zip file contains >1 raster then is not
shown in the browser, while if it contains just one it works ok (also
from the add raster dialog).

Nice that you like it!

I forgot to mention that gzipped files are supported also! (but not
for shapefiles as they are not a single file)

This is all possible due to GDAL/OGR /vsizip/ and /vsigzip/ mechanism
, more info at
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/UserDocs/ReadInZip

QuaZIP and zlib are used to get zip file listing (this is optional at
compilation, but supported by osgeo4w and linux builds).

You have to change the "Scan zip" settings (in the general options),
the possible values are

- No
- Passthru - this just sets the uri to /vsizip/file.zip (which is the
way gdal/ogr supports zip files) and does not support multiple files
- Basic Scan - this opens the zip file and presents the files which
extension is supported  (.tif, .shp, etc)
- Full Scan - this presents the files inside the zip which are valid
(takes longer)

Default value is Passthru, but perhaps "Basic Scan" would be a better default?
I had chosen Passthru as a default before using QuaZip, but it is
probably not the best default now.

Hi all.
Anybody knows where to find release dates for all the versions? On
wikipedia there is a list, but it in incomplete (the date for 07 is
missing, and 0.7.1, 0.7.2, 1.7.[1-4] are missing altogether).
I'd be grateful if someone could point it out.

Yes you could do that, though the plugin doesn't necessarily browse the
user's whole filesystem, just selected places relative to plugin
development [0]. However, on Unix boxes you can just symbolically link in
whatever you like. The browser has a QFileSystemModel backend.

For a large .rst project like the QGIS manual, it may not be much different
than using a separate text editor. Having Plugin Editor embedded
(installed) in QGIS offers the advantages of consistency of interface/tools
and portability, useful for new plugin developers and teaching/seminar
environments. There are many clever things you can do with it, but if you
are already an experienced developer, you may find its features only
occasionally useful compared with your current workflow.

I'm now thinking more to the documentation writer, which is not
necessarily a developer (most probably not). So anything we can do to
make her/his life easier, the better documentation will have, I guess.
I'm thinking of:
- fetching automatically manual sources
- emitting pull requests with a button, after manual production
- preview of the compiled manual
- automatically incorporating screenshots
- etc.
All the best.

Yes, found on the IRC welcome message, thanks.
So I searched a bit and I found:
0.7    20050906
1.7.1    20110929
1.7.2    20111122
1.7.3    20111215

I still miss dates for:
0.7.1
0.7.2
Anyone could help?
Perhaps better to have a wiki page to keep our history (or sphinx, Tim?).
All the best.

Hello,

We have been working on a hydrological toolbox ENKI since 2002, for the Norwegian hydropower producer Statkraft.

Statkraft has recently decided to release ENKI under LGPL. At this time, however, there is no established OS project (WEB site, mailing list, core committer group etc). I'd be happy to see ENKI developing an interface with QGIS and other Open Source GIS tools.

ENKI is a spatio-temporal model building framework, in which a model is built up from subroutines compiled as dll plugins. Although developed for distributed hydrological models, ENKI poses no restrictions on what the routines do, as long as they're happy with being called once for each time step. The interface between subroutines are GIS variables; either rasters or point networks. ENKI validates the model setup and provides all the administration to initialise, calibrate and run the model.

Having used MFC during the development, ENKI is so far tied to commercial Visual Studio versions. I am hoping for resources to get rid of that dependency. The GUI and core are separated, so it should be possible to call the EnkiAPI.dll from other software.

ENKI was presented at EGU2012 in Vienna, and only the lack of an open data set to go with it as tutorial, is delaying its distribution. We are working on that, hoping to get ready within the coming week. I haven't really looked into the different possibilites for how to deploy or manage an Open Source project, suggestions are welcome.

Best regards,

Sjur K :-)

Hi Robert

Werner wrote the original Wiki page, I just got the idea of a Hydrological toolbox from the other post. However there seem to be a few people interested in the idea, so hopefully we can pool our resources to achieve this.

 and modify the Scale List combo box
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6ot2j6MfuDZY8xFhOLeMjUy_M2t6LOHytOcwFCOLvoJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I would like to learn C++ and understand Qgis code organisation, in order
to participate in making a better Qgis. This is why I am trying to propose
a simple new feature : in the project properties dialog, let the user
choose the scales he vould like to use for the current project. Then, use
these scales to replace the predefined scales in the status bar scales
list. The next step would be to optionnaly force Qgis to stick to these
scales when zooming in/out/extent, etc.

I have already coded the "project properties dialog" part : manage a list
of scales, with add/delete buttons, and read/save in the project xml file.
Now I need to interact with the scale list, wich is normally added by
src/app/qgisapp.cpp by the method
   QgisApp::createStatusBar()

The scale list is creating using the class QgsScaleComboBox :
mScaleEdit = new QgsScaleComboBox( statusBar() );

Now, I need som help. I tried to access the scale list directly using
QgisApp::instance()->statusBar() , but with no success.
I think what I should do is to add a method
QgsScaleComboBox::update(QStringList)  in qgsscalecombobox.cpp which change
the content of the list. But then, how can I access this method from
qgsprojectproperties.cpp ?

Thanks in advance

Michael

Michael,

This is how I would do it.

https://gist.github.com/2626655

I would create a signal on the project properties dialog that gets emitted
when the scale change, which you then connect to a slot in the scale edit
object in qgisapp.cpp.  Once the signal fires you read the new scales from
where every they are stored into the scale bar widget.

Hi again,

Here I am :
https://gist.github.com/2627175

I am stuck and really do not understand why. When opening a project,
setting some project scales via the project properties dialog, Applying and
"OK", I get the following errors :

Warning: Object::connect: No such slot QgsScaleComboBox::updateScales()
Warning: Object::connect:  (sender name:   'QgsProjectPropertiesBase')
Warning: Object::connect:  (receiver name: 'mScaleEdit')

But the slot IS defined.
As you see, I even tried to comment some of the addItem() in
qgsscalecombobox.cpp, but when opening Qgis, these scales remain in the
default scale List...

It must be a dummy typo...

Michael

Hi Giovanni,
I can not even find it!

However, taking advantage of your mail, I noticed a similarity
(duplicates) between plugins PostGIS Manager, Spatialite Manager and
RT_SQL Layer. IMO they should be removed. DBManager already does all of
that!

Am I wrong?

All the Best,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] keeping layer settings tab between layers and qgis
 sessions can cause problems when histogram tab is the last viewed
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=wkuvZ4fnU-VaTE+NuNG6AWXQsw0KMNBE3y6Ku4XnHJyw@mail.gmail.com>

A complex object to say something simple :(
When a user opens a layer settings window and hits a tab, the same tab
index is kept when opening another layer settings, or in a new qgis
sessions.
I had a small raster layer, and I opened the histogram tab.
The today I've opened a big raster layer, and opening the layer settings
caused my pc running and running, till a complete qgis crash.
I supposed it was something with the settings, so I opened the smalle
raster, changed the tab to Style, then I was able to open the large raster
settings
It's corner case probably, and qgis shouldn't crash with huge raster
histograms. Anyway, opening the layer settings to the frist tab would avoid
heartbreaks :)

DB Manager works fine.
The plugins overlap, but they are contributed plugins, so it's up to the
user choosing wether to use DB Manager or the others.
My note was directed to the PG Manager mantainer...

Message-ID: <CA+3oMjucxioEgJh2shzFSCuPKu=4NuLDSiF3tdSBaTYYHEZ+xw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

As I got asked to attend at the agit 2012 [1] and do a short
presentation about SEXTANTE in QGIS (and probably at that time showing
the brand new QGIS 1.8) I wanted to ask if QGIS is able to pay the
registration fee (Which would be 170? in my case as I am currently
registered as a UniGIS Student and doing my masters).
Asking that it would be fine to know the "official" status of QGIS at
this conference .. Am I allowed to call myself a "official
representative" .. I would also take some posters with me (Anita?) and
I think it will be possible to have our own table there next to the
Openstreetmap table (which will be populated by a friend of mine
Markus Mayr)..

It's just that I have to register fast because I will be abroad from
the 16th of May on .. So if someone of the PSC could give me an answer
within the next few days it would be extra fine.

Thanks a lot
kind regards
Werner

Hi,

my pleasure!

I agree that http support would be very cool, and perhaps not that
hard to implement (internally) since .zip support is  there.

However, where would this fit in the interface?  .zip support is
builtin the browser and file open dialogs, as the files reside on the
filesystem.

I personally have no interest in it so I cannot devote some time,
sorry!  Although I can help anybody that wishes to lead this effort.

There is also .tar.gz (and .tar) support that is missing, but that has
performance implications as the files have to be decompressed, whereas
.zip file contents are queried very fast.

.tar support would require the addition of a .tar reading lib, like
what is done in gdal/ogr.

Can you share the dataset?

Hi

During the Lyon HF we discussed some options where the next hackfest
could be located. But we didn't make a decision. My offer to held the HF
in the Linux Hotel in Essen/Germany at beginning of october is expiring
in the next two weeks. I have to book the venue early because it is very
popular for FOSS-Community events. How can we make a decision? The exact
date of the hackfest is 3.10.-7.10.2012.

Please let me know what are the next steps to find a decsison.

Regards
Horst

I tried again and here is the log. basically missing

PROJ_LIBRARY
SPATIALINDEX_INCLUDE_DIR
SPATIALINDEX_LIBRARY
SPATIALITE_LIBRARY
SQLITE3_LIBRARY

although they are in the correct path (c:/osgeo4w/lib)

I do have  C:/OSGeo4W/lib/sqlite3_i.lib but it is not detected,
although the include is.

Where did you get spatialindex_i.lib from ? I did not find it in
osgeo4w installer and I had to download it from
http://download.osgeo.org/libspatialindex/libspatialindex-1.6.1-win32.zip
After copying them to osgeo4w dirs, it was found by cmake.
It would be great to have it added to osgeo4w!

Thanks
Etienne

Hi Pasquale,

just FYI there are *five* geometric errors in your sample:
at least, this accordingly to SpatiaLite ST_IsValid()
[based on GEOS 3.3.3]

rowid=104 Queens / Howard Beach
Self-intersection at or near point 597264.08336830535 
4499924.5422885586

rowid=124 Queens / Corona
Self-intersection at or near point 595483.05876413803

rowid=125 Brooklyn / Red Hook
Self-intersection at or near point 584306.82037598593 
4502360.5177495563

Hi,

this is known issue, currently "Check geometry" tool is a bit unusable.

Reading in .tar or .tar.gz could be added in a similar way than the zip support
by using the /vsitar/ mechanism. See the "How to use that capability with a .tar
or .tar.gz/.tgz archive ?" paragraph of
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/UserDocs/ReadInZip . But as underlined by
Etienne, due to the structure of .tar.gz files, on-the-fly reading in them is
not efficient. .tar archives are different, but not particular popular.

I'm not sure why you would need a .tar reading lib. What is in GDAL should be
sufficient, by using the VSIReadDir() API to get the list of files and dirs in
it and VSIStatL() to know their nature (file or dir). (That could have been used
for zip file listing by the way)

In accord to PostGIS ST_IsValidDetail() function I get _four_ errors:

gid       reason               location
------|------------------|------------------------------------------
104   |Self-intersection |POINT(597264.083368305 4499924.54228856)
124   |Self-intersection |POINT(595483.058764138 4513817.95350787)
125   |Self-intersection |POINT(584306.820375986 4502360.51774956)
128   |Self-intersection |POINT(593198.813899889 4515125.37875008)

here miss row 126!

Confirmed for QGIS, 0 errors!

Yes, DB Manager (now in master, will be in 1.8) aims at replacing
entirely the plugins you mentioned, consolidating much of their
functions and reusing their code when possible.
All the best.

Hi Salvatore,

which GEOS version are you using on PostGIS ?
my own splite test was based on the most recent GEOS 3.3.3;
it could be you are using some older (=buggish) version ?

In python console isGeosValid function () works properly with the same
dataset!
Is there any open ticket for what?

@Sandro: as well in QGIS the geometry 126 is valid!

Hi,

I guess this mail got lost among the other mails of the day. It would be 
of great help if you could help us with this.

Thanks,

Hi,

We have some spatial data exposed as WFS layers using Geoserver. However, every layer has both Points and Polygons (and some have Lines too). We don't want to publish duplicated layers just to get around this problem. I have also seen earlier, an option in QGIS WFS plugin which would list the geometry types in a layer (if there is more than one), and let the user add 1 layer per geometry type. I want to confirm if this option still exists, and if there is any specific configuration required for this.

When I try this now with the WFS layers I have, I am seeing only either Points or Polygons. The rest of the data is also fetched but not rendered on the map (I could see them in the attribute table). I have selected default style as 'Polygon' and Available Styles as 'Point, Polygon'.

Any help or pointers on this issue would be of great help.

Thanks,
Pulkit Goel

This is an interesting set of documentation tools that I am now going to
add to Plugin Editor, and have adjusted the plugin's releases accordingly.
The first release will be for other devs to beta-test the text editor and
plugin tools. The second for beta-testing documentation tools and
commenting on the embedded tutorial (created with Sphinx). Then, after
re-working the plugin, finally a public release.

Here is what I am planning for regular (not plugin strings) documentation
tools:

- Function for rst -> output generation
- Refresh-able graphic tool for previewing .rst files (ala ReText or temp
Sphinx builds)
- Function for generating translation .pot files
- Function for viewing translations (see your plugin in another language)
- Tool for capturing screeshots of the QGIS interface window(s) (using
QPixmap static methods [0][1]), dumping to correct screenshots folder, then
copying doc-folder-relative link to clipboard (is this what you meant by
'automatically incorporating screenshots'?)

Concerning source control, I have specifically not designed anything into
Plugin Editor, except for one button to launch your SCM app of choice
(GitHub for Mac, for example). So, source control is managed outside of the
Editor.

My main design focus of the plugin is to ensure portability and,
ultimately, to require no additional installs beyond QGIS and Qt dev tools.
This means zero (or optional) reliance upon command line tools like 'make',
etc., relying instead upon mostly pure Python solutions.

For these reasons (and also for a perceived lack of tar lib - see
below) I did not devote any time for .tar and .tar.gz support.

I wasn't aware that the gdal api could be used to read zip (and other
compressed files such as .gz .tar.gz .tar), I was under the impression
that much functionality (such as getting a zipfile listing) was hidden
under the hood , in files like cpl_vsil_gzip.cpp but not in the API.

I may have not looked closely enough, but that is why I used quazip,
instead of copying bits and pieces of the gdal vsi functions to qgis.

Reading again VSIReadDir() and VSIStatL() there is no mention that
VSIReadDir() can handle anything other than directories - can you pass
it a zip file with proper syntax (/vsizip/file.zip) ?

How did you import the geometries ?
Loss of precision in the import phase may _introduce_ invalidities
(self-intersections)

Hi all.
The lack of response does not speak well about this. Are there
qgis-grass users around?
Anyway, Victor has kindly written a simple guide on how to add grass
modules to sextante:
http://sextante.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/soft/bindings/qgis-plugin/src/sextante/grass/grass.txt
Anyone wiling to help? Perhaps we should try to involve some power user?
All the best.

As a maintainer of PostGIS Manager I would suggest you to move to DB
Manager since I do not intend to maintain PG Manager and remove it
completely in future. DB Manager is a viable replacement.

I've already moved to DB Manager. This was just a note for PG Manager,
being still available through repositories ;)

Etienne,

yes, the doc is certainly a bit lacking. But /vsizip/file.zip is considered as 
a directory from the point of view of the VSI*L API. So you can do most 
operations that apply to regular directories. If file.zip contains a directory 
foo, you can address it with /vsizip/file.zip/foo, etc etc...

Hi Sandro,
I did test both PostGIS (bv shp2pgsql-gui) and QGIS (by Add Vector
Layer[python-cnosole]), in these case I always get four errors.

libspatialindex is already in osgeo4w.

shp2pgsql uses HEXWKB, so should not loose anything.
Maybe the spatialite import used WKT (text) thus introducing the 5th
self-intersection ?

I got everything (except spatialite) automatically detected by adding
this to the build batch script (which is mentioned in the INSTALL
docs)

  @set LIB_DIR=%LIB_DIR%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%
  @set O4W_ROOT=%OSGEO4W_ROOT:\=/%
  call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\o4w_env.bat"

I guess there is a "etc/ini/spatialite.bat" file that should be added
to osgeo4w so that spatialite is automatically detected

I will prepare a small patch for a batch script which works
automatically, I think this would be clearer and easier for new devs.

Cheers
Etienne

Sorry, I overlooked it - I was looking for "spatialindex-dev"

Hi Werner

It is a good idea to advertise QGIS at the agit conference and I saw on 
the fossgis wiki that you are also organizing the QGIS booth.

Which code? My plugin, or the proposed doc tools? I'll make my private
GitHub repository for Plugin Editor public when I do the first beta
release. If you are referring to the plugin's documentation tools, they are
currently in the design stage.

The ReText tool was mentioned earlier in the thread, though it currently
seems to have issues with Sphinx-specific markup.

Hi all.
If I close qgis before having added a layer, I get a segfault:

Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".

Any special reason not to release it sooner? Yes, I'm a big fan of the
"release early, release often" motto.

Speaking of which, I think such selections should be delegated
to providers, for performance reasons (full table scans can take
minutes over million-rows postgresql tables).

 Me neither, 1.7.4 on ubuntu lucid.

 What exactly causes it? I'm doing start qgis from command line, then
File... Quit, or Ctrl-Q, or hitting the window manager close button
all just cause qgis to exit nicely.

 Is the message about threads a clue? Is a plugin doing something bad?
Does it fail if you do qgis --noplugins?

got it, must be a plugin. now, hunting the culprit can be a long story,
as I regularly test all new plugins, and I have 222 installed.

Serendipity, i.e. finding something useful by pure hazard :-)

Short report explaining this puzzling mystery:
- the disputed Geometry has *two* distinct rings
- the main one is correctly marked in the SHP as the
   exterior ring [about 200 vertices]
- the second one has only 4 vertices (i.e. it's a triangle)
   and is almost invisible, because is incredibly small (just
   few centimeters, measured on the terrain: it looks like
   a possible artifact).
   this second ring is correctly marked in the SHP to be
   an interior ring, and shares a common point with the
   exterior ring. nothing forbids an interior ring like this,
   so GEOS correctly identifies this Polygon as a valid one.

There was a bug in the SpatiaLite's own SHP loader: on
SpatiaLite the second ring was wrongly assumed to be a second
exterior ring, thus producing a MultiPolygon (two polygons).
But the second polygon was fully contained within the main
one, thus causing GEOS to raise a geometry error.

Conclusion #1: we've found (and resolved) an obscure bug
   in SpatiaLite
Conclusion #2: GEOS surely is the better tool to be used
   in order to identify any malformed Geometry
   Highly recommended ;-)

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xXqpZwSfopnG4n1AF-LF-GzyG-8WmGunUW=1Jixtowxg@mail.gmail.com>

Almost all the actual algorithms assume to be inside a QgisApplication.
It's obvious, being born as QGis plugins.
Anyway, I think it would be a good plus being able to run (most of) them
from a CLI, given that SEXTANTE handles the layers I/O from filesystem.
If I remove QtGui calls from my algorithms, they could be used from
console, as far as I have an out-of-gui version of AlgorithmExecuter and
QgsLayers.

What do you think about this?

Excellent!

Concerning the creation of these control files: We discussed this already
on the GFOSS.it list, where I recommended to automated the conversion
from the QGIS-GRASS toolbox XML files.

Andrea Antonello offered to take a look (I hope he can manage to write
the converter). Finetuning may be needed but a bulk conversion of the
160 module entries would be neat.

Good idea - and have gui classes that call the algorithms. I don't
know how many files/classes you have, but it might be a pain to
separate the gui from the execution code if you have many algorithms.

Right now it's 'too early.' :?)  I have two tools to finish, a sister
plugin to make ready, and some messy code to cleanup first. Then, it can
actually offer the tools to build and deploy a complete plugin from within
QGIS, and I can maintain the plugin code. (There is, of course, more 'bells
and whistles' and useful features that can be added later.)

Hi

I remember from the meeting in Lyon that Valmiera (Latvia) and Essen 
(Germany) are the possibilities for the next HF. So I guess the decision 
is made by developers expressing their preference on the mailinglist.

for me: +1 for having the next hackfest in Essen.

Marco

Hi,

P?teris Br?ns offered Valmiera (Latvia) some time ago and Horst
Essen (Germany). I wrote P?teris at the hackest about the venue and his
plans, but didn't get an answer, yet. Maybe Latvia is more like a possible
venue for another hackfest in the future.

+1 also from me for Essen, Germany 

Regards
Otto

Hi P?teris,

ok - sorry for the problems. Here is what I asked you and all other
organisation teams. (Amsterdam is already skipped, because the venue is a too
small.) If you write to the list, we can decide alltogether and vote directly
here.

Hi All,

the detailed Valmiera offer is available here [1] in google docs.
Answering on Otto questions:

1) How many people can be hosted at the venue?
In the venue can be hosted more than 100 people. For example some 2 
weeks ago in venue rooms happened such event like Garrage48 ( 
http://garage48.org/valmiera )
2) Would it be in your company?
Our company also lives in this place but the "official" place is 
Valmiera Business an Innovation Incubator.
3) What kind of accommodation would be available - hotel/hostel/.... Is 
there a nice place nearby, where we all can stay?
See in google docs. We can try to reserve one of hotels or student 
dormitories for all participants.
4) What about train connection from Riga?
Yes, something we have :) See in google docs -  "  Travelling Riga - 
Valmiera - Riga"
5) When would you be able to do the hackfest? This autumn? Or anytime.
We prefer this autumn, but it can happen also in other time.

Best,
Peteris

Well, I don't mean to remove the possibility to interact with the GUI from
the algorithms, rather I would abstract the interaction and route it to the
GUI in case we are inside QGis GUI or to the console output if we are in a
CLI...

Hi all,

I am writing an application to load vector maps/shape files using gdal/ogr
and display them onto a gui designed using Qt. I am  new to dealing with
vector files, I am not able to decide how to render them on GUI. Few
approaches that come to my mind are:
- To convert vector files to raster and display them as raster..
- To draw each shape in vector file one by one (i dont know how to do this,
I dont even know whether it would be even  possible this using GDAL/OGR, or
how complex this would be because in my case vector files can be very
complex)

The decision how to render vector files is very important for me, because
after displaying vector files i need to support some advanced features like
projection change, interactive selection, Geo-referencing etc.

Can any one who has worked on vector/gis stuff, tell me how this is usually
done and what Qt widget is used for displaying such data.

Thanks,
Akshay gupta

Can I ask why you are reinventing the wheel and no just using the QGIS libs
as a base.

Thanks, it works.

I just noticed that today the only way to add a zipped shape is through
the browser and the add vector layer dialog, drag and drop and CLI all
return "is not a valid or recognized data source". If is a zipped raster
all methods work fine.

Can you confirm?

Giovanni,

For now file open and commandline open only work in "Passthru" mode -
which works if there is only one "dataset" inside the file.

it passes the base file e.g. /vsizip/file.zip to gdal/ogr

whereas scan mode actually opens the zip and if there are many files
inside will pass the complete path to gdal/ogr
/vsizip/file.zip/file1.tif
/vsizip/file.zip/file2.tif


For zipped shapes it depends on gdal version I guess.  Should work
with gdal>=1.8 though.

For example, with gdal-1.9 I can do

$ ogrinfo -ro /vsizip//home/src/qgis/qgis-etiennesky/tests/testdata/points2.zip
INFO: Open of `/vsizip//home/src/qgis/qgis-etiennesky/tests/testdata/points2.zip'
      using driver `ESRI Shapefile' successful.
1: points (Point)

and when I run qgis /home/src/qgis/qgis-etiennesky/tests/testdata/points2.zip
it works.

Perhaps your zip files contain more than 1 dataset?

Try this to see if you gdal/ogr version supports it:
ogrinfo -ro /vsizip/path_to_shape_zip.zip

and if not try with the qgis source test file
/tests/testdata/points2.zip and send me your file (or its listing).


Now on to multi-dataset zipfiles:

I fixed that last night, by presenting a dialog similar to the
sublayers dialog.

Check out my repos at
https://github.com/etiennesky/Quantum-GIS/tree/vsifile

Also in there is support for .tar and .tar.gz, although .tar.gz are
not scanned immediately when the folder is opened in the browser, you
have to open the file to scan the contents (because of performance
issues with .tar.gz)
.tar and .zip files are scanned when the folder is opened, because the
time to consult file contents is minimal.

I don't think these features will be in 1.8, but I'll submit them
after 1.8 is out.


cheers,
Etienne

Hi Giovanni,
here drag&drop it in MapCanvas works fine!
but only with zipped files containing a single dataset!
Before it was not so! I could choose which dataset import from a popup
window!
What is changed?

Hmm you could drag&drop a zip file before?   and before  what? Was
this possible before my changes or you mean before yesterday's
changes?

my bad. I was testing on a machine with an old gdal version. Sorry for
the noise.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OSGEO4W vs. Mac OS X Qt version (or ~34 plugins
	slightly broken)
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8tMhmhf-PdNYp8Njt8okji10SgbV557m+_UbmNksPmkw@mail.gmail.com>

During a recent audit of almost every PyQGIS plugin (casually studying
repetitive design patterns) and helping some users on
gis.stackexhange.com[0] I have come across an issue that may affect
over 30 plugins (for now,
only on Mac).

>From what I can gather, William Kyngesburye's Mac builds (and Unix/Linux,
too?) consistently use a current, stable version of Qt, now at 4.8, while
the OSGEO4W package is at 4.4 [1]. This hasn't been an issue since, I
believe (and assume), the bundled Qt in Mac builds included Qt3 support.
The most recent 1.7.4 Mac version appears to have a bundled Qt with no Qt3
support (is this correct?).

This has caused many PyQGIS plugins to fail to launch on Mac, due to their
use of a Qt3-only QAction signal of activated() in a plugin's initGui()
method. Basically, the plugin does not launch (i.e. does nothing), with no
error. However, for Windows users, the plugin launches fine, causing
problems when trying to offer cross-platform support for plugin issues.

Can someone else verify these findings?

I am slightly surprised Qt3 is still supported, and think dropping its
support sounds like a good idea, especially for QGIS version 1.8 or >, but
certainly don't know all the details on versioning for QGIS distributions.
I understand this may cause problems with the OSGEO4W package. (btw: Why is
it still on Qt 4.4?)

Here are the plugins I have found that use the deprecated activated()
signal, including two core C++ [2] and a ZIP archive of the particular
files that I found to contain that signal [3]. Without a complete
examination of each plugin, I am not entirely certain all of the signals
are of QAction. I tried to include only those that appear to be. (Note:
there may be more uses of Qt3 deprecated methods, etc.)

Please correct me if I am off on my assessment of this situation, or if I
am late to the discussion.

Hi Nathan,

I do not want to re invent the wheel, but there are lot of licensing and
security issues, and I will be developing a lot more then what i have
written in my mail this is just the starting.

I forgot completely about proxies (apart getting capabilities). GDAL
WCS is using CPLHTTPFetch which should take PROXY and PROXYUSERPWD
options (>=GDAL 1.8.0) and set CURLOPT_PROXY and
CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD but other curl options like CURLOPT_PROXYUSERNAME
do not seem to be supported.

Folks,

I'd be pleased to have the CPLHTTPFetch extended to better
support proxies though it is often a hassle to surface these things
smoothly.

Best regards,

It is true that providers may have provider specific parameters and
methods you mentioned could be used to get/set them. In this case
however, it would just propagate the problem to other parts of QGIS
(conditional code in GDAL Tools for example). I think, that provider
specific parameters should only be known by the provider and its GUI
(add layer dialog and possibly, in future, some change param tab in
properties dialog).  Once the driver is created with URI, only
standard QgsRasterDataProvider methods should be used to access data.

BTW, where do you need WMS GetMapUrl?

Hi devs,

I am happy to announce I have written my first patch for Qgis :)
The new feature implemented is described here :
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5561

Basically, this patch provides a way to define a set of scales to use per
project. The defined scales are used to populate the status bar scale
combobox.

This is my first attempt to code in C++ and to understand Qgis
architecture, so feel free to comment / modify, etc.

Message-ID: <CA+TxYvPd-5VHoyCX4UHio9X416hKx9ZGeQ5EnnnQVaDP0L9ZCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to add support to draw a grid on the map canvas, in a way
similar to what is done in the map composer (although perhaps without
the annotations on the borders).

What should be the approach used?

1) plugin or core?
2) rubberbands or basic plot functions triggered after mapCanvas update?

I think both drawing strategies are possible using a plugin.

It would be best to write in the core, assuming there is sufficient
interest in this, but it will take time to trickle down to the stable
version (an argument for making it a plugin).

I know the current workaround is to create a vector grid with ftools,
but that is a little clunky.

Any thoughts?

to create the XML file for the GDAL commandline tools.
I think it's the same problem you have with WCS, isn't it?

Message-ID: <1336608475035-4964352.post@n6.nabble.com>

I'm quite despareate trying to extend the result of a plugin named jacktest2,
generated with the Plugin Builder.

Changed the default Ui_jacktest2.ui within the QT Creator by adding a
layerCombo object (comboBox) to the Qdialog named jacktest2. 
Saved it and recompiled this file with pyuic4. Ui_jacktest2.py was
generated.
Left jacktest2dialog.py unchanged.

Then edited jacktest2.py. 
Extending/changing the default section with the run method does generate the
changed userform but doesn't accept any code referring to the added
layerCombo object. Would like to add the visible layers to it:
    # run method that performs all the real work
    def run(self):
        dlg = jacktest2Dialog()
        dlg.show()
        # Run the dialog event loop		
        result = dlg.exec_()
        self.layerList = self.iface.mapCanvas().layers()
        self.layerCombo.clear()
        self.layerCombo.addItem("")
        for i,layer in enumerate(self.layerList):
              self.layerCombo.addItem(layer.name())
              if layer.id() == self.curLayerID:
self.layerCombo.setCurrentIndex(i+1)

        # See if OK was pressed
        if result == 1:
            # do something useful (delete the line containing pass and
            # substitute with your code)
            pass

The message is:

I agree that this should not happen, should the default be always open
the first tab, or only when the histogram tab was previously selected?

Unfortunately there is no function in the provider API to know if
there is a cached histogram, so it would be better to never allow the
properties window to start on the histogram tab.

I have implemented this in a branch of mine to improve the histogram
tab, here is a snippet:

-  tabBar->setCurrentIndex( settings.value(
"/Windows/RasterLayerProperties/row" ).toInt() );
+  int currentTabIndex = settings.value(
"/Windows/RasterLayerProperties/row" ).toInt();
+  // if current tab is disabled, use first tab
+  if ( ! tabBar->widget( currentTabIndex )->isEnabled() )
+    currentTabIndex = 0;
+  // if current tab is histogram, use first tab (to avoid long
histogram queries)
+  // there is currently no way to know if there ia a cached histogram
   int myHistogramTab = 6;
-  if ( tabBar->currentIndex() == myHistogramTab )
-  {
-    refreshHistogram();
-  }
+  if ( currentTabIndex == myHistogramTab )
+    currentTabIndex = 0;
+  tabBar->setCurrentIndex( currentTabIndex );

Generally it is good practice that the UI remembers where the user left it
last time.  In this case this has a bad user experience because of the slow
loading.  My suggestion would be to just add a "Load histogram" button in
the histogram tab that loads the histogram rather then when the tab is
switched to.  This way even if the histogram tab is remembered as the
current tab it will load like normal and user has to click "Load histogram"
to show it.

Message-ID: <4FAB30DD.1030603@carto.net>

Hi,

I tried to override the system locale (english) with the german
localization of QGIS. I can select "Deutsch" as a language in the
options, but upon restart there is a problem:

In the console I read:
Warning: loading of qgis translation failed
[/usr/local/share/qgis/i18n//qgis_Deutsch]
Warning: loading of qt translation failed
[/usr/share/qt4/translations/qt_Deutsch]

I checked what files are in /usr/local/share/qgis/i18n

and there is a qgis_de.qm file and no qgis_Deutsch.qm file.

Why is QGIS looking for qgis_Deutsch?

Anything wrong in my Ubuntu? Am I missing a package?

Thanks for any hints,
Andreas

On further investigation I saw that on Ubuntu 12.04 I see the actual
fully written language name in the dropdown box (e.g. Deutsch), whereas
in other systems where it actually works, the dropdown box contains
language codes (e.g. de). Maybe the mapping of the dropdown list values
does not work correctly in Ubuntu 12.04?

Hi,
I'm not a developer, so this might be a crazy and unnecessary idea, but would it be feasible to create a graticule _provider_?

This approach would mean that like grids created with ftools, the grid would be created as a layer, but it wouldn't be file based and its extents would automatically update.

Unlike the approach used in the composer, this would mean:
- digitising tools could snap to the grid lines.
- the identify tool could identify the grid lines.
- the layer could be used for analysis (e.g. you might want to use it to split vector layers).
- symbology and feature labelling could work just like other vector layers.

If this was to actually replace the grids in the composer, some improvements to feature labelling would be needed.  Some of these would probably be good to have anyway, e.g. an option to label both ends of a line, and an option to align labels horizontally or vertically on the page, rather than N-S or E-W.  I guess the difficult one would be providing a way to display labels outside the map frame...

Regards,
Alister

- From Qt4.8 on the Language abbrev. should be automatically changed to
the full language name.
Strange thing is - I tried it on a ubuntu 12.04 with self compiled
QGIS and everything worked well ..
Don't know why it is looking for qgis_Deutsch on your Computer ..
I am going to check that later today with my 12.04 Ubuntu VM.. if the
self compiled still works there must be something with the package

kind regards

Hi!

You are right .. I tried it last time but appearently missed to fully
switch the language and was satisfied with the written full country.
So there must be something else going on with selecting the language.
It only appears when you are using Qt4.8 because this version is able
to do the abbrev.->Countryname conversion by itself ..
Seems that we have to do it in another way because from my side
written names are much more convenient than abbrevations.

If there will be no fast solution I think we should disable the
conversion for the 1.8 release..

thanks for reporting
kind regards
Werner

We need to get somehow data from (and to) providers to various raster
analytical tools (GDAL Tools is one of them). Provider specific
handling for each provider in each raster tool is very bad hack IMO. I
am asking for some clean solution.

Hi

 >analytical tools (GDAL Tools is one of them)

Good point. A clean solution would probably mean to use only methods in 
QgsRasterDataProvider interface to read data and pass it to the external 
tools like that. Both raster providers and plugins for external 
analytical tools can be added dynamically, so the provider interface is 
a good way to have consistency.

At the moment, not even the QGIS native raster tools use the raster 
provider interface (they have been written before the raster provider 
redesign). Something that I need to change in the mid-term.

Marco

Hi Sjur!

Yes I am still on it an still want to prepare something like an
hydrological toolbox ..
So far we do not have anything "real" working .. but I know that some
people are already working behind the scenes on some plugins which I
hope that later can be integrated in this toolbox.

>From my point I have to say that I never heard of ENKI (shame on me)
and allthough I am from Vienna I even did not realise that it was
presented here ..
Is there already anything public available to take a look at? If you
need any information about QGIS or integrating plugins into QGIS just
ask..
I think your plugin will be more then welcome to extend the
possibilites of QGIS.

thanks a lot
kind regards
Werner

Etienne, I don't think it's a good design to introduce such rules inside
the code (switching ti the first tab in case the remembered tab is the
histogram's).
Having the user to explicitely force the reload of the histogram is what I
would expect to find inside the tab... Maybe with the option, through
settings, to ask for the histogram to be loaded automatically...

Has anyone seen this set of icons?

Would it be worth adding these to QGIS? They are in a .png format in the
download.

According to the site they plan to keep adding things to the icon set.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using group by to set a PostGIS datasource using
	QGIS Python API
Message-ID: <7320b312250cc.4fab90e4@ucd.ie>

Hi

I asked the following question at gis.stackexchange.com, but had no luck so far. Can any of you guys help?

Ian

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/24941/using-group-by-to-set-a-postgis-datasource-using-qgis-python-api

         
I am writing a QGIS Plugin and wish to obtain data from a  PostGIS table using the Group By clause using something like the  following code: 
  uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
uri.setConnection('localhost', '5432', 'postgis', 'postgres', 'xxx')
Query="select param_id, st_union(the_geom) as the_geom from myTable group by param_id"
uri.setDataSource('', '(%s)' % postGisQuery, "the_geom",'','gid')
vlayer1 = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), 'testlayer1', "postgres") 
  
This gives the error "No key field for query given." because it is  looking for the gid key field. But if gid was put in the select  statement of the Query, we won't get aggregated rows, just distinct  rows. If I try an aggregation function on gid, I get the same error. If I  try aliasing the aggregate, I get an "Erroneous query" error (even count(gid) as gid), same as if I put 'param_id' as the key field in setDataSource, because 'param_id' is not a primary key, I guess. 
  
In this case, forcing the key field in the uri seems to make the  group by clause useless. Is there another workaround I haven't thought  of or is this the expected behaviour?

Hi Ian,

I am always using views for such things. I am not sure (never tried) if 
you can use a subselect as table parameter for uri.setDataSource.
So I would create a view on the DB. Be sure, that the id field of the 
view is defined as the pk in its source table (no combined pk) and that 
the values in the id field are unique.

I'm very interested in user-definable grid functionality, and I was
planning on implementing something myself for a plugin I'm writing. My
needs are to have the grid set to an arbitrary angle, and ideally to
know which grid square the user has clicked in, relative to a
user-defined origin.

If anyone wants to collaborate, or just has ideas on how best to
implement it, let me know.

JD

Message-ID: <4FABA5A8.3040009@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
The approval procedure for plugins is somewhat uncertain at the moment. This is
causing delays for users and discontent for developers. I suggest to decide one, e.g.:
- appointing a plugin manager, who is responsible for either:
  - approving it within (one week?)
  - sending to another dev for inspection, or
  - asking the original dev to improve it
- notify automatically the user list every time a new plugin is approved.
Any better approach?
All the best.

Hi all.
10 plugins are currentyl under approval:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/unapproved/
Several of them are missing important information from the plugin metadata (homepage,
tracker or repository). Could please the authors add these infos, so we can approve them?
Thanks.

Hey Paolo,

I'm happy to take that job on if no one else wants it.  Currently I can
approve plugins but haven't recently due to the lack of information for
each plugin that has come up.

thanks for this. I think adding you to the list of people notified should be enough.
Alternatively we could send plugin upload notification to qgis-dev (not too bad for me).
I had a look, but couldn't find the config yet.
All the best.

Those are pretty cool ideas!
Perhaps a new QgsMapCanvasItem, rather than a provider? Or even a new
QgsPluginLayer or QgsVectorLayer, so this is actually a layer? In this
case the layer would have to be in the legend, whereas it might be
better to hide it from the legend.

This kind of modification would require modifying the core rather than
making a plugin I think.

Well I'm already on that list of people that get told everytime a new
plugin is created.  I'll just whack a filter in gmail on it so that they
don't get lost in all the other qgis related mail.

I have seen a few plugins of late that just copy the function of an already
exsisting plugin only adding something small.  What would be the best
action to take with these:

Examples:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ShortestPath/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ROQspatialite/

Can this angle be defined in terms of a projection, or is rather
arbitrary with an origin and angle, relative to current projection?
Could your needs be met with a (polygon) vector layer, which allows
you to select one of the polygons?

I think if QgsPluginLayer is a usable option that would be the way to go,
or maybe  QgsVectorLayer  but I suspect that you will need a provider for
that.

I think having it show up in the legend is a good idea that way it can be
turned on and off, styled, and ordered as the user needs.  E.g. sometimes I
might like to have yellow grid lines rather then black.

My needs are that the origin and angle are independent of the
projection, and I was thinking of just creating a polygon layer
similar to fTools'. It would be nice though to make it smart, so that
the user can easily change the number of cells for instance, also so
that the grid's settings are stored in the project file rather than as
a vector file.

The functionality of ROQspatialite should be merged into qspatialite,
if the author of qspatialite agrees.
Quick inspection shows the differences are not very big, the author of
ROQspatialite could probably manage to include them into qspatialite.

Good idea. I had originally thought to hide it from the legend so it
was just considered an overlay, but to be able to use the QGIS styling
functionality makes a lot of sense.

Is there a way we can create a QgsVectorLayer in memory, without using
a provider? If not , perhaps we could use a OGR in-memory dataset
('/vsimem/') - is this used currently somewhere in qgis?

Another idea - use a QgsPluginLayer which itself contains a number of
QgsVectorLayers (e.g. polygon + polylines) to remove the need to
create a provider - but this might be cumbersome.

I'm definitely interested in collaborating with others in this!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] adding options to sextante grass-functions
Message-ID: <1336653908031-4965610.post@n6.nabble.com>

I seem to have realized that you can put in each algorithm of Sextante all
the options originally planned for grass, by editing the specified command
file .txt which is (in my case) in C:\Users\
skampus\.qgis\python\plugins\Sextante\grass\description

So I did for the command v.transform, in order to perform the transformation
by means of GCP whose coordinates are into a separate table, as shown in the
help of command (http://grass.osgeo.org/gdp/html_grass64/v.transform.html).

I opened the file v.transform.txt and i added the line ParameterString |
pointsfile | GCP_Table |

v.transform
v.transform
Vector (v.*)
ParameterVector|input|input|-1|False
ParameterNumber|xshift|xshift|None|None|0.0
ParameterNumber|yshift|yshift|None|None|0.0
ParameterNumber|zshift|zshift|None|None|0.0
ParameterNumber|xscale|xscale|None|None|1.0
ParameterNumber|yscale|yscale|None|None|1.0
ParameterNumber|zscale|zscale|None|None|1.0
ParameterNumber|zrot|zrot|None|None|0.0
ParameterString|pointsfile|GCP_Table|
OutputVector|output|output

Once the command is launched by Sextante, i add the path to the table (using
both "/" and "\") but everything freezes and after several minutes it gives
an error indeterminate, not reported in the log Sextante.

I'd like to know if the use of this external table relates to
"ParameterString" category or another not listed in
http://sextante.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/soft/bindings/qgis-plugin/src/sextante/grass/grass.txt

thank you in advance

Yeah QgsVectorLayer can take 'memory' as a data provider which will
create a memory layer.

nevermind - just saw QgsMemoryProvider!

Any way the provider classes could be in the API documentation???

In general I agree that integration (and avoid duplication) is the way to go.

You are right, that is the best approach.  However, it might be best
to auto-load when the user actually switches to the tab.

A pain gdal does not have an API to query if the histogram is already
computed - this would require adding PAM-aware code to the gdal
provider.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] adding options to sextante grass-functions
In-Reply-To: <1336653908031-4965610.post@n6.nabble.com>

If the interface is freezing, that means that GRASS is freezing (maybe
it takes too long to process or the data is invalid). If you were
passing wrong data, SEXTANTE would make a wrong call to GRASS and
GRASS would produce nothing, which will cause SEXTANTE to fail
afterwards showing an error message. But since it is not even
finishing and producing the log info, I guess that womething wrong is
happening with GRASS.

You can try to execute the GRASS call outside of SEXTANTE. In the
SEXTANTE log you will find the commands. Execute them from GRASS and
see what happens.

The ParameterString is fine, but You can use ParameterFile as well, like this

ParameterFile|pointsfile | GCP_Table |False

False indicates that it is not a folder, but a file

I need to correct myself - PamFindMatchingHistogram() is available in
gdal_pam.h and could be used to test if a cached histogram exists -
provided the raster is a pam raster.

However, it seems the raster provider uses the C GDAL API - rather
than the C++ API , could this be changed easily?

A raster provider is not said it is a GDAL provider, so such
functionalitites must not be fitted to GDAL only...

I forgot about that... so far there is grass + gdal providers which
implement populateHistogram(), we could add a hasCachedHistogram() to
the api, default returns false.

This way, it would always render the cached histogram if it exists,
but ask to compute if not.

Message-ID: <4FABC9E5.3070808@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
There are a number of tickets[0] on sextante who are marked as Resolved, but not
closed. I think this is a good thing, because it allows original reporter to check
and close it if the resolution is confirmed. As it it now, most of them are not
closed by the user, however. Please do, as this adds considerable noise to the bug
tracker.
Thanks.

This is odd because those plugins then should not even compile if Qt3 is missing.  And spatialquery works for me without Qt3Support.  (GRASS works, but has its own problems)

> and a ZIP archive of the particular files that I found to contain that signal [3]. Without a complete examination of each plugin, I am not entirely certain all of the signals are of QAction. I tried to include only those that appear to be. (Note: there may be more uses of Qt3 deprecated methods, etc.)

Hello all,
one of the things I will be implementing for sextante during GSoC will
be multithreading. I have experimented a bit with the possibilities
during the last few days, but it would be good to know your opinion on
what would be the simplest, cleanest solution.

At this point I feel the obvious place to introduce this functionality
is the AlgorithmExecutor class, as suggested by Victor, converting
that to an instantiable class, inheriting from QThread.
I tend to favor QThread over the python standard threads, because its
signaling system is familiar to all working with Qt and would interact
better with the existing GUI code.

In adition to the standard thread signals ("started", "finished",
"terminated"), the algorithm thread would emit "canceled", "error",
"feedback" and "percentageChanged" signals, when necessary. The later
two would be connected to Progress objects.

All GUI code would be moved out of AlgorithmExecutor.

Please comment if you see a better/easier way to implement this or any
potential pitfalls with this design,

Regards,
Camilo

Hi all.
I'm here with Giuseppe AKA brushtyler, and we're having a very
interesting discussion
about threads & sextante. I would suggest to move the whole discussion to the ML
before starting to coda, as I see several alternative solutions to the
problem; some
of them may be unnecessarily complex, so perhaps all together we could design a
simple and effective solution.
Camilo, could you please resume the issue on the ML, so we'll start a
discussion there?
Thanks a lot.

Hi, 
seems that original reporter cannot edit ticket status, though!
in my case it is!
I filed a ticket for that in QGIS Redmine bugtracker [1]

I was suggesting this too, with the purpose to use the Executo (and the
whole Sextante plugin) from a CLI, i.e. a headless QgsApplication instance,
like Qgis Mapserver.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using group by to set a PostGIS datasource using
	QGIS Python API
In-Reply-To: <4FAB84B4.5020303@jena.de>
References: <7320b312250cc.4fab90e4@ucd.ie> <4FAB84B4.5020303@jena.de>

Wait - I was just working away in QGIS version 1.7.3 and my plugin code like below works, but not in my dev version (1.9.90):

Query="select param_id, st_union(the_geom) as the_geom from myTable group by param_id"
uri.setDataSource('', '(%s)' % postGisQuery, "the_geom",'','param_id')
vlayer1 = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), 'testlayer1', "postgres") 
So it allowed the use of param_id as a key, even though it isn't a primary key. Has something changed in recent versions that doesn't allow such code? In fact there doesn't seem to be an error message in the Log Messages, QgsVectorLayer just doesn't load the layer - using QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer1)

Maybe I should check out the most recent version - or build 1.8 to check?

The problem is not there. That class has almost no GUI, except for a
couple of message boxes.

The problem is that SEXTANTE has to take the layers from somewhere,
and now is connected to the QGIS interface to do so. SEXTANTE itself
does not handle spatial data (does not open or save anything), but
uses QGIS for that. This is mostly done through a class called
QGisLayers, which could be replaced.

I however, think that it will not be so easy, since there are a few
other places where SEXTANTE is linked to QGIS. Anyway, I belive is
better to concentrate on the current version and work, and then move
to that. i have tried to keep things independent, so it will not be
too hard if we keep on developing code that is not directly linked to
QGIS elements

Regards

Victor

one possible way is to take the layer (URI, SRS, etc.) from canvas, store the info in
a temp location, and use these info to run the analyses. In this way, the layers
could be removed from the canvas, with no impact on sextante.
Am I wrong?
All the best.

Yes Victor, I've read your code quite extensively. Anyway, layers could
also be managed through QgsMapLayerRegistry, yet I haven't investigated the
differences betweend QgsMapLayerRegistry::mapLayers() [1] and
QgsLegendInterface::layers [2].
Furthermore, you manage the load of layers from URI, so the layers can be
loaded directly from source (and not as a layer instance already loaded in
the Qgis GUI).
Anyway, I don't mean to remove the dependencies from Qgis. I only would
consider an abstract approach that could handle both a headless Qgis
instance, and a GUI based one.

Absolutely Victor. These were just thoughts for the future, but that in
case you agree they could help to avoid heavy, direct, bindings to the GUI
environment that could raise in future developments.

I admit it: I'm thinking about a Qgis WPS server ;)

I have been approving them as I have time. I also have a Python script that checks each file for questionable coding practices that I will share with those approving plugins.

By questionable practices I mean system calls that may do things that should not be done...

Hi all.
In http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-django/settings , the new qgis web app is called
Quantum GIS Django Site. This may be confusing to an user willing to report a bug on,
say, the user map. Perhaps better to rename it?
All the best.

why don't we add it to the validator so that it's automatically
executed for all uploaded plugins?

I'm referring to Qt4 being compiled with the legacy '-qt3support' option
(supposedly on by default [0]), not direct Qt3 support (frameworks, etc).
Recently, when there was an issue with QWebKit on 10.6, you posted a
configure line for compiling Qt4 to fix the problem [1]. I noted that you
chose the '-no-qt3support' option. Is that the same Qt you used for
bundling the recent QGIS 1.7.4-x? Had you nixed -qt3support in past builds,
or used Nokia's pre-compiled Qt4 builds with '-qt3support'?

Can you think of anything else that might have caused this issue, via
differences between your 1.7.3 and 1.7.4 builds? It may be even between the
latest 1.7.4-x builds. I can try to re-install each of the versions to find
when the issue occurs.

The 'Hello World' plugin is the simplest for testing/exhibiting the issue
[2]. Odd that I get no launch of Spatial Query plugin, on all my 1.7.4-4
installs, but you're having success with it.

We could, but in some cases making these system calls is a valid thing to do. The only way to tell is to manually review the code. Automatically rejecting a plugin because of one of these calls is not desirable. It could be used to add a flag for the approving person to indicate it needs a closer look. Here is an example output from checking SEXTANTE:

"Qt3Support" is the library/framework you get with the qt3support compile option.  I don't think there is anything extra in the other frameworks/libraries when you compile with this option.

There is something going on with the Qt 4.8.1 that I upgraded to in QGIS 1.7.4 (1.7.3 used Qt 4.8.0, which had the QtWebKit problem) - there are mysterious crashes is various places.  There may be other problems in the latest Qt that don't cause a crash, but break plugins.

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

Hi all,

I'm wondering if I'm the only one who thinks the content of the QGis
Plugin Repository homepage [1] is obscure.

First of all I really don't understand why putting the "How to add a plugin
to this repo" section below the "Resources for plugins authors"...

Shouldn't the main purpose of the site be uploading and listing plugins?
+1 to have the "How to submit bug report" section in first position, but
"Resources for plugin authors" could be moved below IMHO.

BTW, the more incomprehensible thing IMHO is the list for the section
"How to add your plugin to this repository":

- first point: how to share a plugin (OK)

- second point: create a projection (OK)

- and third one? what's that??? It doesn't make sense to mix ZIP files, repo
on hub.qgis.org and GH repo, it just makes a lot of confusion IMHO.

The zip part should be moved to the first point (how to share a plugin)
and replaced in the third point by something like "do not use any code
repo", although using a repo should be strongly recommended.

Do you agree should be changed? Who can do it?

Regards.

I would suggest _not_ to create another provider for grids (for use as
a vector layer). A grid is not really made of vector features, and
lots of vector operations do not make much sense for grid. An
interesting approach might be to use QgsPluginLayer class, but IMHO a
grid is not even a layer... e.g. does it make any sense to draw some
other layers on top of a grid?

For me a grid is a good candidate to be implemented as another type of
decoration (currently there is north arrow, scale bar and copyright
label). A decoration is drawn on top of the map when map rendering has
finished. And symbology can still be applied when drawing grid as a
decoration.

What should be the benefit of multithreading here? To run algorithms
outside from main thread so that GUI does not get blocked? Or mainly
to allow running several algorithms in parallel at once? Or both?

Multithreading always comes with some cost... you need to make sure
that data you are accessing in one thread are not being accessed also
in some other thread... and this can be a lot of trouble to do it
properly.

One more thing about threading and Python - there is the infamous
global interpreter lock which prevents native threads to execute
Python code at once. So even if you had several threads, only one of
them can run Python at one time. Most of the time this probably won't
cause problems since lots of algorithms would just spawn some routines
in other native libraries, but it is good to know about this
limitation.

Finally, apart from QThread there is a Qt framework called
QtConcurrent that brings high-level API for multithreading. With
QtConcurrent you do not have to manually spawn and watch threads, it
limits the amount of running threads to the number of cores, it
supports some common multithreading patterns like map-reduce etc. This
framework is however available only for C++, so this means that the
core sextante interfaces would have to be moved to c++ (which would be
good IMO).

Yeah and I would also note that it is possible to obfuscate malicious

Well, a plugin that lacks some basic docs/instructions should be
rejected... if an admin struggles to understand its purpose, then the
users will have probably even greater troubles :-)

I guess it makes more sense to draw the grid on top - are there any
uses to draw the grid below the layers? In any case, a simple
(top/bottom) selector would suffice.

Hmm... symbology applied to what?

Nathan's suggestion to make it a layer to be able to style it makes
sense. Any way we can use the symbology interface on a map decoration?
Can we re-use existing widgets for this, or just a waste or time
instead of designing a new widget?

Thank you for the clarification on the Qt3Support framework.

OK, I think I've figured it out. When compiling Qt, and setting the
-qt3support option, the variable QT3_SUPPORT is set [0]. While this is
expected to produce the Qt3Support framework, it also affects the build of
Qt4 frameworks in ~580 places (results of search for '#ifdef QT3_SUPPORT'
in src directory [1]). This includes QAction, which is reverted to emitting
the activated() signal again [2][3].

The upshot of this is PyQt4, when compiled against a Qt4 build with the
-qt3support option, will have that support, regardless (I think) of whether
the Qt3Support framework is included in the Mac app bundle or not.

So, I'm guessing that when you compiled Qt to fix the QWebKit issue (with
no -qt3support option) you truly nixed the Qt3 support, as expected. BTW, I
think this is good: it will ferret-out the current plugins still relying
upon legacy Qt3 code (unfortunately only on Mac, causing some confusion for
users).

I tried with 1.7.4-4 on 10.7 and 10.6.8 with same results: no launching of
plugins. It works with my nightly builds of QGIS (1.8 RC1), which are
bundled with '-D QGIS_MACAPP_BUNDLE=2', i.e. app does not contain the
Qt3Support framework, but PyQt4 still supports the Qt3 deprecated features
(as noted above), allowing all of the affected plugins to launch [4].

Not very nice of the Qt devs to hide such support in the other frameworks.

BTW, I think this is good: it will ferret-out the current plugins still relying upon legacy Qt3 code (unfortunately only on Mac, causing some confusion for users).

anyways, I am using the Qt 4.8.1 binaries from Nokia.  It was only 4.8.0 that I had to compile my own.  So the current 1.7.4-4 and 3/11 dev build on my site have the latest Qt presumably with Qt3 "support", just not the unneeded Qt3Support framework.

Here's what I found, now.  Both the 1.7.4 and dev builds on my site fail to run the spatialquery plugin.  When it worked for me earlier today, that was a more recent dev build on my Mac that I haven't packaged.  So something has changed since 3/11, as you found in your own recent dev builds.

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

Yes, I think most people would never use vector operations on a grid.  And I guess the digitising tools would be disabled for these layers.  But people do treat grids as features for geoprocessing,.

Certainly not usually, at least for printing, although I can imagine using a grid of alternating filled gray and white squares under the map layers, rather than grid lines over the map layers.  
I can also imagine if someone was working with point and line layers and unfilled polygon styles they might move these layers above the grid to make it easier to see them.  
Anyway, it would certainly make sense in some cases to have more than one grid "layer", to be able to symbolise them differently (which implies being able to control which one of them is above another) and turn them on and off independently.  Creating them as layers would make this simple.

I doubt there are many cases when somebody would want grids below the layers, but I wouldn't rule it out entirely.
But I do think people would want grids below feature labels and diagrams (other map decorations are above these), and below map annotations (other map decorations are below these, although I think that they probably shouldn't be).

I think that's exectly what Martin is saying can be done.

+1

I would definitely want it below labels and annotations at least; and I can also easily think of situations where I might want to move it below other layers.

Hi Koos,

Are you able to provide the Spatialite db that is having the issues, and
the style file.  This way we can test it to see what's up.

Nathan

It is fairly easy to provide a GUI where users would select/modify the
symbol for drawing grid lines (all necessary widgets are in qgis_gui
library - QgsSymbolV2SelectorDialog, QgsSymbolV2PropertiesDialog). For
drawing itself you only have to construct a QgsRenderContext instance
and issue calls to QgsLineSymbolV2::renderPolyline(...). Before first
render call make sure to initialize the symbol with startRender() and
at the end stopRender(). To get screen coordinates from map
coordinates there is QgsMapToPixel utility class.

So the rules should be simply:
- no malicious code
- documentation
- no duplication of exixting functionalities or plugin, unless there is a good reason
for it.
More?

I agree with Paolo. That is the main reason. Executing several
algorithms at the same tiem means more complexity not only because all
the reasons mentioned before, but also in the design of SEXTANTE,
since the result of one algorithm might modify the inputs available
for a different one, and tracking all that can be hard as well.

Of course, this could be done in the future, but for now, an within
GSoC, if we get to run algorihtms in a separate thread robustly and
they do not block the GUI I will be more than happy.

There is a typo at page "ahs at least minimal documentation"
seems here should be "has at least minimal documentation".

Also I think we need a more clean guidelines about some
requirements:
 - should plugin author include documentation in plugin package
   or it is enough to provide link to homepage with description
 - same for test data. Should author include test data into package
   (and make plugin size bigger) or only provide link (where this link
   can be specified?)

Good questions. I am more inclined in having everything in the package, at least a
minimal version. More data and instructions can be linked.
All the best.

I think we should let plugin devs to use external page to do so, at least
the plugin wiki page in hub.qgis.org, as the hub should stay alive

For these reasons I think we should not force developpers to add test data :
* it increases the sise of the zip
* some plugins won't need specific data to be tested
* We can instead ask which data in the Alaska sample data can be used to
test the plugin ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugins.qgis.org: First Impressions
Message-ID: <1336741378.88029.YahooMailNeo@web125403.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hello All-
?? I have a couple minor editorial comments/suggestions for http://plugins.qgis.org that I'd like to share. Apologies in advance if I'm sending my comments to the wrong list. There's no webmaster identified on the site so I don't know where to go. 

I went to the plugins.qgis.org site for the first time today and at first glance, I wasn't sure what I was looking at. The title/logo says "Quantum GIS" and the landing page says "Welcome to the new QGIS Web Application". Its a little confusing until you start reading the content. Here are a couple, really minor suggestions to make the site more readable:



1. I believe the title next to the QGIS logo at the top of the page should be consistent throughout the plugins.qgis.org site. It should read "Quantum GIS Plugin Repository" or something 
similar. Otherwise its a little jarring as you move from page to page 
and its not always clear that your still on the plugin site (e.g. 
Snippits and User Map).

2. Include a header for each individual section (like you have on the landing page and the plugins page). 


3. I believe the title on the landing page should be a little more descriptive like "Welcome to the QGIS Plugin Repository"

4. I suggest a minor reorganization of the content on the landing page. I suggest 3 simple sections: 
?? - Introduction (e.g. what are plugins)

?? - How to Create/Upload a Plugin
?? - How to File a Bug Report
?? - Developer Resources


Respectfully Yours,
Peter

Thanks Martin, this is great to know.  Existing code (composer grid)
does not seem use this infrastructure.

Would it make sense to create a new qgisgui element (or other class)
to deal with grids, and re-use this code in the composer?
Or perhaps just draw in the composer whatever grid(s) have been
defined by the user in the main canvas?

Are there any documentation/examples on using qgisgui elements, other
than the api?

Etienne

Yes, that would be the main goal, and is, I think, relatively simple to  
implement: Main thread handles GUI stuff, this newly introduced thread  
handles the algorithm.

One thing that is missing is the ability for the algorithms themselves to  
signal changes (percentages, text feedback, failure, etc), that is, from  
algorithm.execute()
Should the progress objects be repurposed for this?

Thanks for your comments,

Camilo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Geometry of feature in python while digitizing
Message-ID: <4FAD8A6C.5000801@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi all, I'm trying to make a custom form that can make some calculations 
on poligons when a button on it is pushed. For this I wrote a python 
script like explained by Nathan at [0].

All works when the form is opened by an action in the identify tool, but 
when the form is openend because the digitalization of the polygon is 
finished (right click) the form allways gets a featureID of 0 (using 
identify the ID varies).

So my problem is that I can't get to the geometry of the polygon just 
digitized. I allways get the geometry of feature 0.

My simplyfied function looks like this:

def openForm(dialog,layerID,featureID):
	msgBox = QMessageBox()
   	msgBox.setText("ID: " + str(featureID) )
  	msgBox.exec_()

any hints?
Thanks a lot
MArco

Of course I have:

libqtwebkit-dev
libqtwebkit4

do I need other packages?

I got the same error yesterday .. It seems that the libqtwebkit
package from debian is missing something ..

I think it should be reportet upstream to debian package maintainer ..
for now you can solve it by setting a link from
/usr/lib/libQtWebKit.so to
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

lrssvt pointed out this solution yesterday on IRC

Thanks a lot Werner (and lrssvt), that made it.
I'm going to report the issue upstream.

I always thought that gdaltools and ftools should be non-blocking
(unless I am mistaken, they are currently blocking the rest of the
app), especially if the operation takes a long time.

This might have issues though with

1) progress report - can this be done by the executing thread?
2) what happens when the operation finishes

Ideally, there should be a way to cancel an operation, if it takes too
long (e.g. escape key when the operation window has focus)


Also, this could enable several similar operations to be done in
parallel - as long as they are not working on the same output files.

GdalTools is non-blocking (uses QProcess to execute commands)
and its dialogs are non-modal, so more operations can run
concurrently and users can open all the gdaltools dialogs they need.

That's missing in GdalTools.

Generally speaking, every time the execution thread emits the
progress signal the main thread (GUI thread) updates the progressbar.

Focused to GdalTools, it should get progress percent from the
QProcess output but unfortunately a lot of other info goes to
the process output.

> 2) what happens when the operation finishes

The execution thread emits a signal and the main thread
display a message according to the signal (error, finished).

Stopping/killing the execution thread should be enough.
GdalTools asks for confirmation and then does it.

That must be taken care from the framework: an operation that needs
as input outputs generated by other operations must be started only
after the required outputs are ready...
... and the key is to use signals, again.

I stand corrected then - I guess I was confusing it with ftools, which
is blocking and does not spawn a process.
Any way ftools could be adapted to use the same approach as gdaltools?

If it were using the gdal api directly, it could get the progress and
report it though QProcess - but that's not possible as gdaltools calls
the command-line apps directly.
There was some talk on the gdal-dev mailing list about putting the
gdal utilities in the api, but this probably won't happen really soon.

However - this hack might work - when the characteristic
'0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done.' output
is detected (say after '0...10') then the output would be interpreted
as progress report, which could be used to update the gui every 10% -
until 100 is read. I have never seen output mixed with progress report
in gdal utilities, although I may be wrong.

An example with gdalwarp:

$ gdalwarp -s_srs EPSG:4326 -ts 6000 6000 -of GTiff
/data/research/work/modis/2000-2010_jun-may/MCD45.ba_qa.cerrado.2000-2001.wgs84.tif
/data/tmp/tmp1.tif
Creating output file that is 6000P x 6000L.
Processing input file
/data/research/work/modis/2000-2010_jun-may/MCD45.ba_qa.cerrado.2000-2001.wgs84.tif.
Using internal nodata values (eg. 0) for image
/data/research/work/modis/2000-2010_jun-may/MCD45.ba_qa.cerrado.2000-2001.wgs84.tif.
0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done.

This has to be done manually, externally to qgis though. Would it be
possible to have a "Cancel" button in the dialogs that would respond
to user input, or respond to the Escape key when pressed?

Am I wrong to think that currently, 2 gdaltools operations could run
concurrently with the same output file, with all associated problems?
You are talking about implementing this sort of thread-safe checks
into the sextante framework, right?

yes, it could. The only problem running non-modal dialogs
are crashes accessing deleted objects like layers removed by
the user.

The solution implemented in GdalTools is to use the
QgsMapLayerRegistry signals to update the list of layers
and the combos.

Externally?

Yes, why not?
I'm not sure I've understood.

uhm.. sorry, I've read too fast and I misunderstood your words.

No, I don't know what happens if two tools wrote on the same output,
though I think GDAL locks the output file until it finished.

Let's give me a try :)

BTW, why should two tools work on the same output file?

I mean finding the thread through 'top' (in unixes) and killing it,
rather than having a gui to do it (like a Cancel button)

I was just wondering if the ui could respond to a click on a Cancel
button, or a hit on the escape key - but I guess it could since the
operation is done in another (non-blocking) thread.

user error - in the case of a more complex workflow with sextante this
might happen more often, so it would be good to make sure.

Message-ID: <CABqTJk_F7_R4zPTFYK7NVFHO1Y9yTK71qnyNF4rWfrHekLzCCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm testing the WFS client and notice it don't understand the multiple srs
from getcapabilities.

I try to inquiry with the WFS client from a wfs server where there is three
available SRS for each layer.
I verify this with a call to getcapabilities, that will response this:
For every layer available:

<DefaultSRS>urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::25832</DefaultSRS>
<OtherSRS>urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::3003</OtherSRS>
<OtherSRS>urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326</OtherSRS>

But in the client WFS the only reported SRS is that in the DefaultSRS tag.

Is this a know bug ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] how to create a new geometry from an existing one
	with python
Message-ID: <CAFcNcQbhbiCyFK5jqjuBFxykg4uiHC9B9nknty6Qjih5HNcDbw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

I'm trying to code some tools for working with lines layers using
python. One such tool is meant to create parallel lines.
I am trying to create my new line geometry by first copying the
geometry of a previously selected linestring and then translating it
according to a specified distance.
But I can't seem to find the correct way of copying the geometry.

I am on Ubuntu 11.10, using QGIS compiled from master #033d58d, built today.
For testing, I'm using layers created with the 'New Memory Layer'
plugin, which uses the memory provider.

I've tried the following approaches:

# python code

line_geometry =
qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer().selectedFeatures()[-1].geometry()

# approach 1
new_geometry = QgsGeometry(line_geometry)

-> Exception: unknown

# approach 2
new_geometry = QgsGeometry.fromPolyline(line_geometry.asPolyline())

-> no error is thrown, but nothing happens

# approach 3

wkb = line_geometry.asWkb()
g.fromWkb(wkb, len(wkb))

-> RuntimeError: underlying C/C++ object has been deleted

Thanks for your input!

Hi,

I'm also experiencing this problem after the last Debian (Wheezy) upgrade.

I tried this solution, creating a link, but still giving me this error:

? ?pedro@debian-amilo:~$ qgis
? ?Warning: loading of qgis translation failed [/usr/share/qgis/i18n//qgis_en_US]
? ?Warning: loading of qt translation failed [/usr/share/qt4/translations/qt_en_US]
? ?qgis.bin: /tmp/buildd/sip4-4.13.2/siplib/siplib.c:10938: sipEnumType_alloc: Assertiva `(((currentType)->td_flags & 0x0007) == 0x0003)' falhou.
? ?Abortado

Here is the link that I created:

? ?pedro@debian-amilo:~$ ls -lh /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQtWebKit.so?
? ?lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 Mai 13 00:11 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQtWebKit.so -> /usr/lib/libQtWebKit.so

What am I doing wrong?

I've also tried to upgrade the libqtwebkit-dev and libqtwebkit4 with the sid repository, but QGIS continues to crash.

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Thanks a lot Werner (and lrssvt), that made it.
I'm going to report the issue upstream.
All the best.

most fTools functions already implemented as threaded, but there are some
minor issues. I work on improving processes handing in fTools, and several
tools already don't block main QGIS window, has non-modal dialogs and allows
to cancel running process.

Also I think about rewritting fTools in C++ and integrating its
algorithms into QGIS
analysis library. This makes tools a bit faster and will allow to use
algorithms in
plugins

This approach is correct (and other seems to be fine, too). The
problem is elsewhere: you are being bitten by this bug:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/777

Basically the problem is that the feature containing the line_geometry
gets deleted when the first line is executed. So your line_geometry
contains an invalid pointer leading to these strange errors. To
overcome this, store the list of features and then access it without
problems...

Message-ID: <CALuHMPC2JwEWOD+=xNcALTEm-Sv0VmKEB3AhVtOfDHiVjb_mMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

regarding to PyQGIS CookBook [0] plugin documentation can
be written as HTML files and to open help developer should
use method showPluginHelp() from qgis.utils module.

In same time showPluginHelp() used deprecated method openURL()
from QgsInterface class [1]. And as I can see there are no alternatives
for this method. So what is best solution for displaying Python plugin
help in long-term period? Use showPluginHelp() as suggested in
cookbook or implement own method directly in plugins?

	from python
Message-ID: <CAFcNcQZQQKh70xurz-Bw6kF-a2CxOXb3X9aOcHApjJAWBxeutg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

I'm trying to translate and rotate a geometry using python, in order
to create parallel lines.

For the translation I could use QgsGeometry's translate() method, but
for the rotation I haven't found a ready-made solution. So my current
strategy is to individually rotate each vertex, according to a
specified angle and length. For this i'd like to iterate over the
geometry's vertices.

The problem seems to be that the api methods that return vertex
coordinates (vertexAt(), adjacentVertices, ...) always return a value
even if the specified vertex index is wrong. For example, if I use a
geometry with 5 vertices and call:

geometry.vertexAt(100)

-> (0,0)

I cannot know if there is a vertex placed at the (0, 0) coordinates or
if there is no vertex at all.
Is there some way to iterate over a geometry's vertices? Or maybe get
an exception when asking for an invalid one?

Thanks

Sure.

You can use:

for v in geom.asPolyline():
    print v.x(), v.y()

asPolyline returns QVector<QgsPoint> which is
just a List of QgsPoints in Python.  Access like normal

You can use QDesktopServices [0] in lieu of QGIS openURL(), but I think you
probably know this already:

QtGui.QDesktopServices.openUrl(QUrl(some_url))

As part of my Plugin Editor tools, I have designed a lightweight web
browser for displaying HTML help. It allows you to load pre-defined
bookmarks, and has several useful tools for viewing help and tutorials from
within plugins, but does not support several 'normal' browser features,
like downloads.

It is the first PyQGIS shared widget in the sister plugin to Plugin Editor,
called Plugin Library. The idea behind the Library is to offer, via a PyQt
GUI, a method to demo and browse available shared widgets, modules and
snippets. Once the Library is installed, it acts like a PyQGIS virtual
Python environment, from which other developers can use to import its
different components into their plugins. It is an attempt to share code
amongst Python plugin developers (without bothering the C++ coders to
include into the GUI core), speed the development of plugins, and offer
users similar GUIs across plugins (like a help browser).

I'm not done with the Library plugin, but I am pretty much done with the
first version of Help Browser (except for its help :^). Please download it
and try it out, if you like [1]. Right now, it is just a package, but will
later be a sub-package of the Library, accessible with:

from plugin_library.widgets.help_browser.help_browser \
                import HelpBrowser

I have only tested it on Mac (10.7 and 10.6.8). Currently, on Mac with QGIS
1.8, any access to external web sites crashes QGIS. Works locally, though.

Hello

I am that Eugenpaul doing vector layer generalization. Happy
to be accepted, but it is also quite a responsibility, so I am
feeling a very special mix of emotions right now. You may
remember my proposal, but the work plan has been changed
a bit, so I will briefly tell you what I have decided to do after
several conversations with my mentor, Alexander Bruy.
1. My first aim now is to implement generalization for a
collection of objects keeping their topological relations.
Current implementation handles only one feature and avoids
new intersections as a result of generalization. I'll take its
base algorithm, the Douglas-Peucker, and add tracking of
connected edges of the neighboring objects.
2. Then I will implement the on-the-fly generalization to
speed up rendering. According to some tests done by
Alexander [0], a simple distance threshold routine followed by
the Douglas-Peucker algorithm shows significant reduction
of the rendering time, especially with complex style lines.
3. Then I will look into the render cache realization. It is the
right way of speeding up rendering, maybe there is a way to
improve it.
4. At last, if I will have enough time, I'll try to adapt existing
feature cache patch to the last QGIS version.
Everything is planned to be supported by unit tests.
All the progress will be described in the blog [1].
If you have any ideas on how to do these things better,
please let me know.

simplification

That would be a great enhancement and leverage the analysis library as a

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7wKLL+xfQ12+5Ge42VjiDGuuzfcFAf_F6r+gyKW3eKPBg@mail.gmail.com>

Here is my opinion on all that, in short:

-The main idea of using threads is not now to execute multiplep
algorithms at the same time, so we can remove a lot of complexity
(like 2 processes writing the same file, as it was mentioned)

-Implementing a canceling mechanism is going to be the greatest
improvement once we have the threading stuff

-So, for me, this is what should be done:

  1)implementing the threading part
  2) implement the cancelling mechanism (a responsive cancel button, etc)
  3) modifying algorithm to respond to cancellin events.

I think that would be more than enough for a first part, and it would
be a great improvement for SEXTANTE

Regards

p.s. Just to let you know, I am leaving for Honduras tomorrow, and
will be there working for 2 weeks, so I not might be very active on
the lists during the next 15 days or so

Victor,

I agree on all your points.

May I suggest to have a unique interface/approach that other existing
interfaces can benefit from (i.e. standalone gdaltools and ftools).

It seems that QProcess is an interesting candidate (and QThread when
not using external app.), because it works in both c++ and in pyqt
(ref. gdaltools) - plus there is already code inside qgis that uses
it.

my 2 centavos

Hi folks,

there have been a number of interesting suggestions, I will try to
summarize them this week.

I quickly put together a basic grid in the main map canvas, using the
interface and logic from the map composer.  I have decided to
implement the grid as a decoration and accordingly added an item to
the Decoration menu.  I have also improved the decorations management
to be able to draw the decorations in a particular order (with a new
class QgsDecorationItem), so that other decorations are on top of the
grid.

There is support for grid annotations, but only inside the map border
currently.  Line symbology is still basic (line width+color).

Basically I think there could be 2 concurrent and complementary ways
to implement grids:

1) basic grid in core, similar to what is already in the composer map
(and in my branch)
2) more refined grid(s) as plugin/vector layers, whose rendering order
can be fine-tuned

Those interested can have a look at my github branch:

https://github.com/etiennesky/Quantum-GIS/tree/decorationgrid

I wonder if http://grass.osgeo.org/wiki/Ps.output might give good ideas for
drawing a grid on the map canvas.

Hi all

+1 for using QProcess. I am using it in Lizmap Plugin to run external
librairies (winSCP on windows, lftp on linux), and it works great. You can
easily connect signals like readyReadStandardOutput(),
readyReadStandardError() and finished(int, QProcess::ExitStatus) to your
plugin methods.

Yes, I know how to open any link in default system browser and how to implement
simple HTML viewer with PyQt.

My question was about *recommended* way for Python plugin deveopers, so I can
use it in all plugins I maintain and also show it during courses.

Nice work Etienne! Over the weekend, I've knocked up a little plugin
of the second type - a plugin layer that uses the new symbology
system.

It's marked as experimental, and there are a few things on the TODO
list, but it can be found in my plugin repo:
http://109.123.122.13/qgis/plugins.xml

One of the todo's is saving the styling information - I can't find
where I can get the XML of the symbol for my writeXml() function. Any
ideas?

Regards,
John

I got this error when executing your "Grid Overlay" plugin

An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/tourigny/.qgis/python/plugins/grid_overlay/gridpluginlayer.py",
line 63, in draw

I was looking for that also, found it here
QgsSymbolV2 * QgsSymbolLayerV2Utils::loadSymbol 	( 	QDomElement &  	element 	 )
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsSymbolLayerV2Utils.html#eb26044ca3b2ce149bf2a02075e3f15a

Seems to me most of the symbologyv2 stuff is not well documented yet.


I have implemented this in my branch for both line symbology and new
marker symbology. It creates an xml doc, then saves the content to a
string item in the .qgs project file.
When you load the project the symbology is loaded with the other options.

Hi Bob,

Output looks really nice but I see 2 issues:

1 - grass is optional, not part of qgis core
2 - made for PS output, may not fit nicely with the composer nor the map canvas

Perhaps there is a workaround for 2 ?

I tried your Grid Overlay plugin and this is what I found.

Same error as Etienne reported:

Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/home/tourigny/.qgis/python/
plugins/grid_overlay/gridpluginlayer.py",
line 63, in draw
   self.symbol.renderPolyline(polyline, renderContext)
...

it also occurs when I cancel the dialog. The plugin layer is made
regardless of cancelling dialog on initial plugin launch.


When I click the 'Set Style...' button I get this error:

 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"/Users/larrys/.qgis/python/plugins/grid_overlay/gridpropertiesdialog.py",
line 42, in chooseStyle
    self, False)
TypeError: QgsSymbolV2SelectorDialog(QgsSymbolV2, QgsStyleV2,
QgsVectorLayer, QWidget parent=None, bool embedded=False): argument 3 has
unexpected type 'GridPropertiesDialog'

Is that not implemented yet?


I noticed in your metadata.txt and __init__.py you assigned the Layers
category, but the action doesn't show up there. Does it need to use the
following to be added to/removed from the Layer menu? (worked when I edited
gridoverlay.py):

self.iface.insertAddLayerAction(self.action_newGrid)
self.iface.removeAddLayerAction(self.action_newGrid)


Tested with QGIS 1.8 rev.69ef4de on Mac 10.6.8.

Looking forward to using your plugin on the current map I am working with.

Hi,

Sorry to insist, but still unable to start QGIS on Debian Wheezy.

I appreciate any support.

Thank you very much!


Best regards,
Pedro

Hi,

I'm also experiencing this problem after the last Debian (Wheezy) upgrade.

I tried this solution, creating a link, but still giving me this error:

? ?pedro@debian-amilo:~$ qgis
? ?Warning: loading of qgis translation failed [/usr/share/qgis/i18n//qgis_en_US]
? ?Warning: loading of qt translation failed [/usr/share/qt4/translations/qt_en_US]

? ?Abortado

Here is the link that I created:

? ?pedro@debian-amilo:~$ ls -lh /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQtWebKit.so?
? ?lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 Mai 13 00:11 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQtWebKit.so -> /usr/lib/libQtWebKit.so

What am I doing wrong?

I've also tried to upgrade the libqtwebkit-dev and libqtwebkit4 with the sid repository, but QGIS continues to crash.

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

I have several issues with the new labelling engine.

- I can only set an angle if I also set x and y coordinates (which I have to
artificially add as fields to my data, since they are only in the geometry
initially)
- the labels aren't placed precisely where they should be
- and, finally, as I noted just now, I can't create upside-down labels, as I
have described in
  http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5593

I'd propose the new labelling engine is worked over. I have seen others
complain that it doesn't do as they expect. I can't use it for the reasons
given above, so I'd have a hard time if the old engine was removed.

Hi devs,

I was wondering what is the current status of 1.8 release.  I have a
number of new features I would like to create pull requests for, but I
guess it is better to wait until 1.8 release before that.

Hi Pedro,

probabily depends on the last Qt update in Debina wheezy!

Did you try to recompile?

I recently spotted another bug that caused a crash but Alex promptly
fixed it. So far then the above 3 tickets are still the confirmed
regressions. Other things are surfacing but all stuff also confirmed in
1.7.4.

cheers

That's odd, I'm using 1.7.4 and Python 2.7.2, but I can't imagine the
API to have changed. It runs fine on both my Linux and Windows boxes.
Looking at the C++ docs, indeed RenderPolyline() takes a QgsFeature as
the second parameter, so I'm not sure why it should work for me!

Another odd one. GridPropertiesDialog, the class in which this
function is defined, is inherited from QtGui.QDialog, so should make a
valid parent to the symbol selector dialog. I've set it to None on my
machine with no ill effects.

Ah yes, a copy-and-paste code bug. Ahem...

I'm glad to hear others will be using it, when it works.

Message-ID: <CAN-LTZLzV0t1F=5_mkTEEYi+R=piFVXCN6BQxQ9pNpQqhqiOpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I'm trying to build qgis in my virtualized WinXP (with a little
change in a simple marker) and have one question and one problem... The
batch with the enviroment that both has the VC++ and the OSGeo4W variables
leave in blank PYTHONPATH is correct? And when I run the batch I get : The
system can not find the path specified
(_path=C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python27\Scripts)...
I change in python.bat the line: set
_path=SGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\Python27\Tools\Scripts because this exist but I get
the same.
Do not know if these steps are OK

I continued to cmake-gui, configure and generate and no problem. Then in vc
load (from my build) the qgis1.8.0.sln and Build... How I know if this is
OK? Then the next step is not clear for my. I must close the proyect and
open Install target (which is the file?) and build? ...

That's why I like both Debian...
any idea...

Thanks

1.7.4 method:
QgsLineSymbolV2.renderPolyline(QPolygonF, QgsRenderContext, int layer=-1,
bool selected=False)

1.8 method:

QgsLineSymbolV2.renderPolyline(QPolygonF, QgsFeature, QgsRenderContext, int
layer=-1, bool selected=False)

1.7.4 method:
QgsSymbolV2SelectorDialog(QgsSymbolV2, QgsStyleV2, QWidget parent=None,
bool embedded=False)

1.8 method:

QgsSymbolV2SelectorDialog(QgsSymbolV2, QgsStyleV2, QgsVectorLayer, QWidget
parent=None, bool embedded=False)

I can't even find this method in the current API docs. Just referenced in
the error dialog, and last seen in the 1.7.4 API docs.

Didn't see these documented in the API changes part of the wiki [0]. Maybe
there is a different, or more up-to-date, listing somewhere.


I tested your plugin with 1.7.4-4 on Mac 10.6.8 and it works fine. One
suggestion: maybe allow the rotation for be about a chosen point, instead
of only SE corner?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] new regression on to-be 1.8: crs attribution on
	newly loaded layer broken
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=oB5EOqZfsndrKnipEt9cjXthhpy+QcdqCxHj6+jUH7nA@mail.gmail.com>

Something's seriously wrong with CRS attribution for newly added layers in
qgis-master (soon to be 1.8). I have no idea what is happening, however the
steps below will reproduce the issue:

1) Add moeareas.shp (uploaded as attachment in issue 5598:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5598) to a QGIS project
2) Open the Properties dialog and go to the General tab
3) Take note of the custom CRS applied to the layer

The above shapefile's coordinate reference system is EPSG:3148, defined as
follow:
"+proj=utm +zone=48 +a=6377276.345 +b=6356075.41314024
+towgs84=198,881,317,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs"

The custom CRS created by qgis 1.8 when loading the above shapefile:
"+proj=utm +zone=48 +a=6377276.345 +b=6356075.41314024 +units=m +no_defs"

QGIS 1.7.x correctly attributes the newly loaded layer its proper CRS
(EPSG:3148); QGIS 1.8 however creates the custom CRS with the exact same
projection settings (minus the +towgs84). Something must be wrong in the
CRS attribution algorithm / function.

This issue leads to misalignment with on-the-fly re-projection projects in
which WGS84 layers & UTM layers are mixed together.

It's a pretty serious regression from 1.7.x and it's present on windows and
linux. Issue reported: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5598.

Hi all.
They are now 4 (maybe 5). What worries me is that I see little activity on this.
Should we do something about that? Would starting a campaign "help us releasing 1.8"
be useful to collect some money and devote more dev time to them?
All the best.

This has been discussed earlier. New labelling still needs some more love before
removing the old one. See its list of bugs. I agree that it would be very good to
having only one system, as the current situation is confusing, especially for newcomers.
All the best.

I can confirm the issue with the provided shapefile but does not seems
to happen with any CRS with towgs84 parameters.

Hi all.
Very interesting suggestions about map colouring:

A plugin doing the same (taking colours from great painters works and applying them

I think sample data should be added only if the plugin requires them. For instance,
it is difficult to check the usage of Time Manager without properly designed data. On
the other hand, mosst drawing plugins need no data.
So we should be flexible.

Hi,

we discussed the hackfest on the PSC list and we decided to take the Linux
Hotel opportunity in Essen, Germany while it is available this autumn.  

P?teris, your proposal looks good and we hope for your hospitality for the
first QGIS meeting of next year again.

Kind Regards

I agree it is a bit worrying. It would be nice to see them done so we
can cut 1.8 loose
and move on with the clean up for 2.0.

If you think a bit of publicity is what is needed I'm happy to write a
quick blog
post, throw something up on twitter, facebook and Google+.

As we all know, the plugin approval process is still somewhat slow,
and this plugin is under development (not even 'experimental' yet).

Could we streamline this process by adding a flag 'development'
(similar to experimental) which makes is available to those who allow
them? This by all means would be similar to adding the plugin to
another repository.

Another option would be to add a parallel repository (on the same
server as the official, say http://pyqgis.org/repo/dev) which makes
all unapproved plugins available?

Cheers,
Etienne

That's good to hear. The reason it rotates about the origin is because
my main use-case is for archaeological geophysical prospection where
there isn't a need for an arbitrary rotation point. That said, it
wouldn't be hard to put something in to handle that.

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8t+yf_6q1gL+BwN5bZ5PbTZj=e9N4VfEmjwNVWBSTjvg@mail.gmail.com>

I recently built the master branch with the API docs using Doxygen 1.8.0,
which has a very nice auto-completion javascript search function [0].
Current Doxygen version at API site is 1.5.6.

Is upgrading API site to newer version reasonably easy?

Hi,

A ticket is open (#5544), this problem can be reproduced on Windows XP, 
Windows 7 and Fedora 17 with qgis-dev from OSGeo4W and git master.

As it is making difficult to package qgis or use it on a USB device, 
should I set the affected version to 1.8 and/or raise its priority status ?

regards,
jean-roc

Same problem here. I cannot delete the plugin "1-band..." from the
contributed repo. 

May I suggest that one of the people having admin
access rights to this repo delete the "1-band..." plugin from the repo,
if at all possible and easy to do? 

Cheers,
Benoit

Tom,

Are you talking about the entry here: http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/AutoPlot/

I can delete it so you can upload a new version if you like.

starting QGIS? I'm working with QGIS 1.8.0-Lisboa, a1255fc, Python 2.7.2.

I've just downgraded PyQt4 from 4.8.5 to 4.8.3 on Ubuntu Oneiric. I had to
remove qgis-python before downgrading but I already installed it again. The
error message is:

-------

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in
RuntimeError: the PyQt4.QtCore module is version -1 but the qgis.core
module requires version 1
-------

The strange thing is that I'm able to load PyQt4.QtCore from a Python
terminal.


Regards,

Germ?n

Is it me, or are the bindings for QgsVector missing? If there's no
reason other than oversight, I'll raise a bug and provide a patch.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 'reload' a layer
Message-ID: <CADB6tZuqkqzf+sTMeL1aQrZZBrhSn+_hM_4Y3v_USKaZLNbVfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list, does anyone know of a clever way to (programmatically) reload
a layer without actually removing it and re-adding it to the layer
list. Some context: I have a layer that sometimes gets updated by an
external application, and I want to be able to 'refresh' the layer
from the Python console to reflect these changes (new features,
deleted features, new attributes, etc.). I *could* simply load the
layer again, but I'm hoping there is a more efficient way to do this
(also I want to keep the current styling, layer order, unique layer
id, etc).

Any thoughts/ideas? Note: assume we are working with a spatialite layer for now.

Do you mean refresh the rendering or synchronizing the layer with the data
source?
I usually use QgsMapLayer::reload() for the latter, and
QgsMapCanvas::refresh() for the first.

That sums it up, I think. One main QThread for the GUI stuff + one for
the analysis, controlling the later by mean of signals.
Aditionally using QProcess (or not) is something that can be decided
on a backend-by-backend basis -- potentially some of the backends will
use direct APIs or remote connections, not commandline programs.

Thanks for all the feedback.

No, just the utility class QgsVector as defined in qgspoint.h

I have need of it in my plugin, and I didn't want to reinvent it.

Yes, if someone could delete the version from the contributed repo that
would be great.

Do you think that is what is causing the constant upgradeable plugin
problem?

In my case
there is a version number mismatch between the plugin and the repo.

Hi Giovanni,

Thanks for the tip. To answer your question: I am trying to
synchronise the layer with the datasource. Having said that, I don't
seem to be able to get 'reload' to work. It looks like reload is
reimplemented in QgsVectorLayer, which in turns calls the
dataProvider's reloadData method, so this may vary by provider type? I
tried it with a shapefile and a spatialite layer, and it did not seem
to do anything: I deleted several fields from the shapefile and added
a field to the spatialite layer in an external program, and these
changes were not reflected when I 'reloaded' the layers. Am I missing
something here? Perhaps there is something else needed to get the
changes to 'show up'?

Cheers,

Carson

You're right Carson. I used it only with a WFS layer, and in fact I see
that WFS is the only providers that implements it.
There would be the setDataProvider method on the vector layer but it's
private...

You've raised an important point, that I took for granted :(
I fear that in this moment the only solution is remove it and reload it.

I don't how it was yesterday (maybe someone fixed it in the meantime), but now 
the one in the old repo [1] is ok (v 0.1). The one in the new repo [2] has 
obviously broken metadata. I guess the problem is in line 21 of metadata.txt: 
the space before hash.

Thanks Gary to take action. 

The plugin is called 'one-band raster to paletted or RGB raster', bccAddRColor.

I've no /usr/local/share/qgis/python/qgis/ directory in my installation.
I guess are old files that mask the libs you've built.

Have a look at the modification date of files within that folder:
ls -l /usr/local/share/qgis/python/qgis

and if those are old files just remove that folder (or move it
somewhere).

Have also a look at the modification date of the directory
/usr/local/share/qgis/python/pyspatialite/
it could contain the same old stuff as well.

Regards.

Hi all.
Want to see the shiny new QGIS 1.8, with the many new functions and improvements?
Then help us fixing the few remaining blockers for the release to happen:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=23
You can fix these yourself, hire a developer, or sponsor the ad hoc work of one QGIS
dev. Free and open source software is very much about helping each other.
All the best.

	(libqgis_gui.so)
Message-ID: <CACbtZwQMhCMSXGSV0DXftO9nyvuZTtDoWDY-MxWhDGAHZPtWNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

My GSOC work primarily deals with the GUI enhancement. Hence I endup
modifying the libqgis_gui.so files all the time.My install directory
is  ~/bin/qgis/ Hence whenever I make install, the new .so files are
put in the {INSTALL_DIR}/lib/. But when {INSTALL_DIR}/bin/qgis is run
it doesn't take the .so files from {INSTALL_DIR}/lib/. Instead it
always uses the /usr/lib/ files.

I manually copy the .so files everytime into the /usr/lib into order
to test and debug. I would like to know how can I configure or do
something to make qgis use .so files from {INSTALL_DIR}/lib instead of
/usr/lib

Thank you.

That server runs debian and there dont seem to be any current doxygen
packages for it. The most recent deb I can find is here:

https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/doxygen

but that is a) for ubuntu so I am not 100% sure if it will work and b)
it is 1.7.x so I am not sure if it includes the updates you are
looking for.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Point sampling tool and python console
Message-ID: <CAP=RzasEK1zpYwfcWPPzXnUXR--7SaWiuNMfBy39xquD5iPb6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am new to QGIS and to Python.

I would like to use the plugin point sampling tool in order to merge raster
datasets with my observations (a delimited text layer) and then save the
resulting shape file as a csv file. I know how to do it with the GUI:

Add Delimited Text Layer
Add Raster Layer
Point Sampling Tool
Join the layer
Save as .csv

As I have quite a lot of raster dataset to match with my observations (and
I am quite keen to learn Python), I would like to do it with a loop in the
Python console.

Thanks to this post <http://planet.qgis.org/snippets/2/>, I have:

crops="Wheat", "Maize","Barley", "Haricot Bean","Teff"

for i in crops: layer=QgsRasterLayer("C:/Program Files/LEAP/Images/Water
Balance/Meher/2005/"+str(i)+"_Meher_Final_Index_2005.img",str(i));
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layer)

Any one knows what is the function for Point Sampling Tool, Join the layer
and save in Python?

More generally, how do we use plugins in the python console?

Thanks a lot,

Xav

>From what I gather from the changelog for doxygen [0], the new HTML look,
and javascript search engine were included in versions 1.6.0 and 1.7.0,
respectively. So, as far as what the user sees on the API site, there may
not be much reason to use the latest. One of the Ubuntu packages (>= 1.7.x)
should give the API site a facelift, if it's not too much of a hassle to
use on the Debian server.

I just thought it might be nice to have a fresh look (and quicker search
tool) for the API site, to coincide with the release of QGIS 1.8. Also, it
would mostly match the API docs, as generated and packaged for Ubuntu (QGIS
nightly repository).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding features with an editing buffer - undo
 action unavailable in the GUI?
Message-ID: <CAFcNcQYJaUvNfNw4NYfpqgEE+jthvHk4KKpK1uK44uDsakFa9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

I am writing a plugin that creates new features. According to the
pyqgis cookbook[0], and the API docs[1], when I call the addFeatures
method on a QgsVectorLayer, the features should get added to the
layers editing buffer. It is my understanding that this action ought
to be undo-able, since the changes haven't been commited yet. But the
undo icon in the QGIS GUI doesn't seem to be aware of the changes that
the plugin is making to the layer. Do I have to hook up the changes to
the undo/redo stack myself? How can I do this?

The code is available on github[2], and here is an excerpt:

def create_point(self):
        layer = self.canvas.currentLayer()
        point = self.calculate_point() # returns a QgsPoint
        f = qgis.core.QgsFeature()
        geom = qgis.core.QgsGeometry.fromPoint(point)
        f.setGeometry(geom)
        layer.addFeatures([f], False)
        self.canvas.refresh()


Please note that the new feature is being created successfully. I just
want the user to have the ability to undo the feature creation.

Also, when I press the 'toggle editing' button in the digitizing
toolbar, in order to save the changes I am getting a strange
behaviour:

- If I choose to save my changes, everything goes fine,
- If I choose to close without saving, QGIS crashes with:

Fatal: ASSERT: "mAddedFeatures.isEmpty()" in file
/home/ricardo/dev/Quantum-GIS/src/core/qgsvectorlayer.cpp, line 3982

and a lot more output in the stacktrace.

Thanks for you help!

Hi,

You have to set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to  ~/bin/qgis/lib/.

For a USER ONLY add it to your ~/.bashrc
-------------
LD_LIBRARY_PATH ="~/bin/qgis/lib/"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Hi Carson,

have you tried updateFieldMap() from QgsVectorLayer? I've just had a
similar problem with memory layers and it turned out to do the trick.

have you seen the above comment in the #2714 ticket?

just asking because if we can really get rid of the canvas flickering
would be very good.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Displaying local file's geometries as rubber bands
Message-ID: <CANaz7mxFK4VKcX_nOZBjpoZZzUHKuOr6Wd3rHhyM75t=JBZQFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to get geometries from a local file (e.g. GML) displayed as
QgsRubberBands. However, I wouldn't like to load the layer into the map
because in the real scenario there could be a large number of files to get
geometries from.

I've been attempting it with the following code (you can copy it directly
to the QGIS Python Console), but only the last feature is displayed:

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from qgis.core import QgsFeature, QgsVectorLayer
from qgis.gui import QgsRubberBand

def loadGMLAsRubberBands(fileName):
    featList = []
    rb = QgsRubberBand(qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas(), True)

    vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(fileName, "layer", "ogr")
    allAttrs = vlayer.dataProvider().attributeIndexes()
    vlayer.select(allAttrs)
    f = QgsFeature()

    while vlayer.dataProvider().nextFeature(f):
        featList.append(f)
        rb.addGeometry(featList[-1].geometry(), None)

loadGMLAsRubberBands("/tmp/gml/sample_three_features.gml")
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the solution given in this thread [1] I'm storing the features in
a list, but somehow it doesn't work in this scenario. A sample GML file can
be found at [2].

Do you have any hint?

Germ?n

Subject: [Qgis-developer] configpath vs optionspath
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg8ShE87MKUdAY3DJUa5kqt_zZbNYT2OFC7aueh=VVoTjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to understand when one would use --configpath vs --optionspath.
I understand that --configpath can be set the path to look for things
like python
plugins etc but optionspath seems to do nothing.  Even when set the settings
are still stored in the registry in windows.  ?In the code they both seem to
be doing the same thing in two different places (lines, 318, 421, 484
in main.cpp) :

QSettings::setPath( QSettings::IniFormat, QSettings::UserScope, argv[++i] );

which doesn't seem to do anything unless you also use:

QSettings::setDefaultFormat( QSettings::IniFormat );

so that you have:

QSettings::setDefaultFormat( QSettings::IniFormat );
QSettings::setPath( QSettings::IniFormat, QSettings::UserScope, argv[++i] );

I added the setDefaultFormat line for all three cases
(https://gist.github.com/2764906)
but now if you supply configpath it will create the ini in the config
path rather then the
optionspath.

I'm just wondering what the correct behaviour is meant to be.

Is configpath meant to just set the location for the python plugins,
etc, and optionspath
meant to set the path to the ini file?  If this is the case I have a
patch ready to commit
to fix this.

Thoughts,
Nathan

Greetings,

I am having trouble importing the qgis.core module.  It seems like many
others have had this problem, so I attempted all of the solutions I could
find posted.

1. I am running python from within OsGeo4W shell
2. The PYTHONPATH is set to the qgis installation folder

Still, when I initialize python with the command "python", and attempt

import qgis.core

I still get the message 
Import Error: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.

The command "import qgis" executes successfully, and if I create a dummy
file "hello.py" in the qgis folder, I can successfully "import qgis.hello",
but no luck on importing qgis.core.  Any ideas?

James

I originally asked to avoid leave the extension while dragging and
dropping from the browser, mainly because when dropping into DB Manager
it is annoying to have to manually remove that ".shp" (example) from the
suggested table name.

On the other hand seeing the datatype in the TOC is useful and a thing
that many users have asked in the past.

Real life projects tend to be large, with many layers from many
datasources/types. Vectors are not just vectors, and rasters are not
just rasters: there are vectors that cannot be edited (lack of
permission or because gdal does not allow it), layers that cannot be
used as input by standard qgis tools (GRASS rasters), etc.

Sometimes the users have even layers with the same name but of different
type.

So, seeing the format in the TOC is a step forward in usability, and in
the ticket were suggested a few ways to get it.

cheers!

Dear all,

This is a little beside the point you are discussing, but I think it would
be a nice addition to the File Browser to allow users to delete geographic
data (or only shapefiles). Managing geographic data with Windows Explorer
is quite annoying and I think it would make a lot of sense to add this
feature to the File Browser.

I guess the consesus in the issue is that the browser should display
extension names, and that there should be an *optional* indication in
the legends layer as to the provenance.

However, any other display/tool (drop to DB manager and PG/spatialite
in browser) should not use the extension.

It was also mentioned that drop from browser should be consistent with
"Add Layers" dialog (and also from the commandline). It is not
currently in the case of vector layers.

These alternatives have been presented, perhaps needing a user option:

1) Always adding the extension and stripping it where necessary
2) Never adding the extension and adding it in the legend
3) Never adding the extension
4) the legend could have an optional (for experts) additional column
with data source format.

1) and 2) deal more with a technical aspect in that the display name
is set in QgsDataItem (by the QgsDirectoryItem in the browser case),
so selectively changing that name based on the destination requires
some consideration on the source (probably the uri + provider would be
sufficient).

Consensus on having the extension in the browser means that the
QgsDataItem name must have the extension, but this must be removed
when doing most D&D operations, which means more complexity.
The alternative is to add the extension in the Browser (and possibly

Radim's solution to have an additional column specifying the
datasource format (TIF, SHP, PG, etc.) is interesting, but might add
clutter?

This is a known issue with 1.7.4 [0] (though not really an issue with QGIS,
per se). The plugin may not launch because it still uses some Qt 3 code for
that operation (usually activated() instead of triggered() for QAction
connection signal).

Which plugin?

Hi all

+1 for optionnal additionnal column, as it will be consistent for all use
cases, and leave the choice to the user.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problems printing with qgis web client
Message-ID: <1337704384.2498.33.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

I'm having some problems with the PDF generated by the qgis web client.

I set up the application with qgis-server master and the sample dataset

http://mapserver.uevora.pt/qgis-web-client/site/qgiswebclient.html?map=/var/www/qgis-web-client/projects/helloworld.qgs&format=image/png&visibleLayers=Hello,Country


printing up to 1:100.000 it is ok

more or less at 1:50.000 the layout in the pdf is wrong (the map object
is bigger than supposed and exits the page margins + the extent also
seems wrong)

starting from 1:50.000 the layout seems ok but the map object is empty
in the pdf.

Any suggestion?

cheers!

Sorry about the multiple emails earlier.

Looks like your 'pyarchinit_plugin.py' file has 8 occurrences of
activated() in the initGui() method. Try switching those signals to
triggered(). You may want to check the rest of your plugin for any more Qt
3-only code.

I believe this issue is not currently present on QGIS for Windows or Linux,
because the standard Nokia Qt 4.4.x - 4.8.x distributions are compiled with
-qt3support, which keeps support for ~580 Qt 3 bits of code in the compiled
QtCore, QtGui, etc. modules. It's my understanding that Qt 5 will
completely drop such Qt 3 support, however.

What should an additional column include, in the case of physical files?

1) extension (e.g. tiff / shp)
2) gdal/ogr driver name (e.g. GTiff / "ESRI Shapefile")
3) just the provider key? (.e.g. gdal / ogr)

For others the provider key (postgres, spatialite, etc) should be
sufficient I think.

Attaching a propotype with this idea, using 2) with (V) or (R)  /
(ogr) or (gdal) to differentiate vector or raster

Right now most of the plugins are not prepared to be used from a
console (or from a script) because many times their algorithms are
bound to GUI. But in case some plugins are well-written with separated
GUI from logic, you could use them - it is possible to access plugins
from console - this will show a dictionary with plugin names and
instances:
>>> qgis.utils.plugins
(There are even methods for loading and unloading python plugins)

So to call a plugin's routine, you would do something like this:
>>> qgis.utils.plugins['super_plugin'].do_something( my_data )

Another option is to look at the plugin that has the functionality you
need and use the some pieces of code directly in your script.

Yet another option seems to be SEXTANTE - a plugin that brings a
common interface for algorithms. It should also allow you to run
algorithms from batch script.

Ooops, it seems that some documentation is missing! I have just added
some notes to PyQGIS cookbook, hope that helps:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Developer-Cookbook/commit/869c9e19af3278f67770895326fb9fbcfeece848

That's a check to ensure that the undo stack is working properly - it

The idea behind --configpath is to use the given path for everything
user-specific, that is:
1. QSettings configuration (into .ini file in that path)
2. anything that normally appears under ~/.qgis

The --optionspath overrides just the QSettings part - and probably it
should be removed since the --configpath seems to be what people want
to use.

Looks like a bug to me. Probably it was tested just on Linux which
uses IniFormat by default...

Hi James

I would guess that Windows is unable to locate qgis_core.dll - please
make sure that the directory where it resides is in the PATH variable.

IMHO:
- extensions in legend widget are useless
- new column for layer type in legend widget is are also useless
(there is tooltip with data source / full path)
- extensions in file browser are not necessary (there is tooltip with
full path, so it's possible to distinguish them even when the base
name is the same)

Please keep things simple.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problems debugging my plugin
Message-ID: <CAEP=zx_mrCqPDq8Cg4XeiyHX1LJ6N=kQyQnLQf4ux6=DtGxUfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I've written a qgis plugin for my company, and I'm having some problems
debugging it.  I'm using an qcompleter to provide autocomplete
functionality, and it's....well, not really working out.  The plugin is
somehow crashing QGIS, but I don't know how; or how to log where things are
going wrong.  Here's my setup...

    def autocompleteSetup(self, text):
      if(len(text) == 4):
        buttonName = self.getCheckedButton()
        searcher = self.searchFactory.getSearcher(buttonName)
        result = searcher.autocomplete_execute(text)
        resultArray = QStringList()
        self.result = result
        for i in result:
          resultArray.append(i[0])

        if(len(result) > 0):
          self.autoCompleter = QCompleter(resultArray)
          self.autoCompleter.setCaseSensitivity(0)
          self.autoCompleter.setModelSorting(2)
          self.autoCompleter.connect( \
            self.autoCompleter, \
            SIGNAL("activated(QString)"), \
            self.goToLocation)
          self.textBoxQuery.setCompleter(self.autoCompleter)

Now I've riddled this thing with file outputs (to try to see what's up) but
from everything I can tell, it's not dying within this function; the app
crashes shortly after it executes (sporadically -- it doesn't consistently
crash.).  But none of my code runs after this.  So in short; what I really
need is a way to debug here.  File outputs...really not ideal.  Perhaps a
way to output to the console?  I'm kinda stuck either way, though -- I'm
not sure where to go from here.  Perhaps most frustratingly, my completer
isn't dealing with alpha characters from addresses I'm using.  (I'm doing
an address search with autocomplete here).  So I'll type "123 " and get a
list of addresses, but then I type "C" or "c" for the name of the street,
and it disappears.

Does anyone else have any ideas as to what's up with this?  Any pointers in
the right direction would be appreciated....  Thanks!

I agree.
I guess a layer is just a layer. Distinguishing them by extensions just
means the base name is not complete.
If you have 2 layers with the same name probably they are different
and then you should consider to assign them different names.

IMHO they are necessary for files, otherwise I (but I think users in
general) may become crazy to find the right file to load.

So I would just keep everything unchanged except trimming the
suffix from the layer name.

Regards.

Giuseppe - where would you remove the suffix?

Obviously the db manager and other drop targets in the browser.

How about in the legend? I am 50/50 on that as there is always the
option to change the layer names manually, and the tooltip does give a
clue on the filetype.

In order for users to help out with this and other issues involving
testing of the RC
versions(s) on linux machines, it would be very important to be able
of installing the
RC binary version with a different name (i.e., qgisdev or qgisRC).
Many users can afford
regularly using the RC version, which would be the best and most
simple way of testing and
detecting (and critically valuating) the new features, but if and only
if the stable qgis version (currently 1.7.4)
is still there as fallback.

Not sure how difficult/involved is making this coexistence to happen,
but I think that the effort should be considered taking into account
the gain in terms of real life testing.

(I know compiling is an alternative, but it is one that will not be
considered by most users).

Hi all,

I often use tooltips to see some information on a layer, and do not find it
very helpful though :
* you have to stand still
* you cannot always read the whole line (e.g. for postgis layers / layers
with long WHERE filter on small screens), and it is not very "readable"
some times
* you can only see one layer at a time.

A new optionnal columns with basic (and short) info, like GDAL/OGR Driver,
will be a handy solution. If this new columns is not visible by default,
but only if the user decide it, I think it is the best approach.

+1 It would be great to be able to run two versions of QGIS (without manual
building) on Ubuntu (as possible with OSGeo4W).

Best wishes,

Hi Martin,

Thanks a lot for your help. I will try the different options you proposed. I
solved my problem in between my doing it manually with the GUI, it was a bit
long but OK.

Thanks again,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] configpath vs optionspath

Ok that makes sense.  Everything goes in --configpath is set else use
--optionspath.

Currently it doesn't work on Linux or others so it's just a bug in the
code.  --configpath
works in the sense of setting the path for ~./qgis but not for the ini files.

As this is a bug fix any -1s from anyone to add this in before 1.8 is released?

IMHO no extensions should be displayed in the legend as well.
I thought I replied, now I notice it's not so clear I was talking about
layers in legend.

I quote myself:

Shortly, neither the drag'n'drop of files from the browser should append
the suffix nor the legend should display them, that's my opinion.

I agree.  Showing filetype in the legend is just ui noise that isn't needed. How
often do you open the same layer from different sources with the same name.
Even if people do I doubt it would be more then a couple and then the tooltips
would do fine.  Don't add something that adds UI noise for a 5% use case.
Like Martain said, keep it simple.  This is what QGIS should aim to excel at.

I'm am in two minds about if extensions should be shown in the browser, again
I worry that it is UI noise.

Message-ID: <17638186.204731337770622521.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

Hi all,
a question about convert function.
I'd like to convert a simple shapefile with z field. I'd like to convert that 
shapefile into shapefileZ. 
Is there a way to do that?

Thanks

I don't know if it's possible with Qgis API, AFAIK it isn't possible
because Qgis doesn't support Z vaues.
You could consider ogr2ogr, setting -nlt to POINT25D (or POLYGON25D,
etc.) and -zfield to the field from which to peak the Z value.
You can also do it from Qgis vector tools.

	(v.to.rast.txt)
Message-ID: <CAPwOVCFPzSYY=em6RCL3Z3rHyBGfCdhP64YBSnXXRAGX8GYa7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all
I have problems in using the v.to.rast module in Qgis1.8-Sextante.

When I open the module there are:
-Input (required)
-use (many options available)
-column (auto fills on vector selection)
-value (unique value to use if "val" is selected under use)
-output

If I want to make a rasterization based on a value I must select "val" in
use and set a value in value, but I get an error sayng that I must not
specify a column to use

GRASS_INFO_ERROR(3460,1): Column parameter cannot be combined with use of
value option

GRASS_INFO_END(3460,1)


So

I tried to change the v.to.rast.txt description file setting "true" after
the column parameter (i.e. optional)


v.to.rast

v.to.rast

Vector (v.*)

ParameterVector|input|input|-1|False

ParameterSelection|use|use|attr;cat;val;z;dir

ParameterTableField|column|column|input|True

ParameterString|value|value|1

OutputRaster|output|output


After that the column parameter still auto fills in the module form and I
cannot rasterize by a value (if not coded in a column)


How can I solve this?

Thnx

Pietro

Hi all,

I propose that a reasonable compromise would be the following (by
default) for 1.8:

- show extensions in browser (it is a "file browser" after all, and a
majority have shown support for it)
- no extension in legend nor anywhere else (ui noise, a minority support it)

This can be solved in code by removing the extension in the
QgsDataItem name() member, this way it does not have to be stripped in
drop operations,
and adding a QgsDataItem::fileName() member which the browser would
use for layer items. It very simple to fix now.

And if people really want choice: have an option to disable/enable the
extension display in browser and legend, but do this after 1.8.

Regards,
Etienne

I don't want to insist, but large projects (100 or more layers) are
quite common among... common users. An *option* to allow recognize the
datatypes in TOC (an icon or els) would be much appreciated (tips are
not that handy, I can make a few examples).

Anyway I hope that at least extensions in browser will not be removed,
they are not handy just when D&D in DB Manager.

cheers

 +1 for what Etienne suggests: no extension in the layer tree toc but 
 extensions in the browser.

Hi Pietro.
One of the current major limitations of sextante is that we do not (yet) have
optional parameters. Several modules can be unusable until we have it.
Bear with us, and if possible help us defining the right default options for grass
(and others) modules.
All the best.

It should be possible to get the file name from QgsDataItem::uri().
QgsDataItem is base for various data sources, most of them are not
file based.

Thanks Denis.  That's very helpful.  After some poking around this morning,
I found my issue.  I'm not sure why it was happening, but whenever my I
bound my new qcompleter object to the textbox, the application crashed.
 Changing out the QLineEdit's QCompleter object isn't the preferred method
for working with dynamic content, but at the time it was the only one I
could get to work at the time.  This morning I started using a
QStringListModel to store the list for the QCompleter, and I update that
instead now.  The result has been much better, as the application no longer
crashes.  Thanks again!

Message-ID: <CAA6k8-LXct4jFjH5n4tmznNxib5mCpVm1+tU2XrmSOYSWQDprg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I started to work on adding python support in project files (see [1]).

I've added a new tab "Project routines" to the project properties dialog
where the user can define 3 different python routines:

one is executed when the project is loaded,
the next one when the project is saved,
and the last one when the project is closed (saved or not).

I'm also adding a safe-check, it asks to the user if enabling them.

I've few questions:

1. In [1] Martin wrote: """The routines should be able to access QGIS
application with the use of the interface in the same way how plugins do""".
I'm wondering if those routines must be functions with a specific signature
or they could just access the QGis interface using the qgis.utils.iface
since I'll use the QgsPythonRunner to run them.

2. In a loaded project with trusted scripts (the user has trusted them)
if the user changes their definitions from project properties dialog
2.a. should the new routines become active immediately when the user
clicks on the apply button in the project properies dialog,
2.b. or should become active when he saves the project (the new
projectSaved script has to be called just after the project is saved),
2.c. or should I keep the previous ones until the project is reloaded?

3. should I call them project-embedded-scripts or routines??? :)

Opinions are welcome.
Cheers.

Giuseppe

This is awesome from the point of view of SEXTANTE. One of the biggest
problems in SEXTANTE for gvSIG is that, if you have saved your results
as temporary files, the project will keep a link to them, but they
will be deleted once you exit the program. This problem appears also
in QGIS, but it woould be solved if I could add a script to be
executed when saving a project, so it can check that layers are not
temporary (and if they are, save them to a permanent location).

Even, the algorithms used to generate a given layer could be stored in
the project file, so if a layer is missing, it could be recomputed if
the input ones are available.

Looking forward to knowing more about it and starting working on those
features. If there is anything I can do to help you, tell me and I
will see what I can do.

Regards

Victor

I apologize for posting before you have had your questions answered. This
is an interesting feature and I have a question and suggestion for you.

1) Will the scripts/routines actually be embedded in the project file, or
be as sidecar file(s)? I'm looking at adding editing access to code in my
Plugin Editor plugin.

2) How about offering plugins the ability to programatically 'add'
themselves to a project's open/save/close event? (In addition to running
saved routines.)

Plugins could have standardized method 'hooks' (i.e. slots like initGui)
for each event and only need to register with the user and the project's
settings. There could be a small table listing all plugins found to offer
hooks for each event, with a enabling checkbox next to them (3 tables or 1
with mixed events).

When a user installs or launches a plugin, it could check it's enabled
state for a project event and prompt user to authenticate its adding or
toggling for that event. This would allow plugin authors to add their
plugins to the project's events without requiring a user to write any code,
and allow the user to toggle a plugin's hook on/off/ignore, or deny a
plugin's request. Plugin authors would then have to handle user
decisions/settings, and not annoy users with dialogs at every project event.

This is different than the plugin responding to any project's
open/save/close Qt signal (only open is supported now in API?), and/or a
plugin saving a setting in the project file, as it introduces standardized
user preference and authentication across all plugins wanting access to a
project's events.

what you need is just a signal sent when the project is saved, like the
projectRead() signal available through the qgis iface, although there's
no way to update the URI of a loaded layer.

What I'm working on is a way to define user routines.

Good idea!, but you have to get bad (missing) layers, so while
the project is loading, not after.
When the project is loaded you've already lost bad layers.

There's a setBadLayerHandler in QgsProject, but I suppose if you
create a new handler in the python code it doesn't work due to the
current "asymmetric bindings" (python code can access C++ object,
C++ code cannot access python objects).

If setting the badLayerHandler from python worked, you could do:
1. store info on layers created by sextante using custom properties,
2. create a sextanteBadLayerHandler that checks bad layers' custom
properties to understand if it was sextante their creator and if so
recreates them otherwise call the default bad layer handler.

We have to wait for other people,
hoping they'll join this thread soon ;)

I'd recommend using OpenLayers plugin instead of GoogleLayers because it works better
and has even more functionality.

Hello,

excuse-me for my very bad English I am an italian francopnone 

I use QGis 1.8 on Xubuntu 32bit Precise 12.04 and I can't read ECW files...

If you have a answer I would be very grateful.

Thanks in advance

Silvio

you must add the ecw support to your gdal using the old er-mapper sdk.

It is quite easy to do that with the "libgdal-ecw" package in the
ubuntugis repository, too bad that the "precise" repo does not have yet
most of the packages, including this one.

Dear devs,

the rendering order in rule based style does not work any more, instead 
features rendering is ordered by chance.

anybody confirms?

Hi Bernhard

If you switch the x/y coordinates, you also get an image with 1.3. In 
some cases, the coordinats are switched in 1.3 (usually geographical 
systems). Not a good idea, but that's what the 1.3 spec says...

Marco

Hi Francesco,
are you using osgeo4w? In that case I suggest you to have a look to the
startup .bat files (like C:\OSGeo4W\OSGeo4W.bat), that setup the right
evnironment (python pat, bin dires, etc.)

In general you have to add the various Qt and Qgis DLLs to the PATH, and
configure the python paths to be able to peak the qgis modules.

Thanks Marco,

arghh, I knew there is this difference between 1.1.1 and 1.3.0
I was originally accessing QGIS Server from mapcache but there must have 
been another issue.
Now all is working.

If you close the shell you loose the environmental variables.
OSGeo4W.bat sets env vars for the current shell, they're not kept as system
env vars.

You need those environmantal variables to leaverage the osgeo4w libraries.
You ha mainly three choices:

 - run your python script inside a shell where you have setup the env
variables (like it is done by Osgeo4W.bat)
 - hard code the environmental variables inside your python script and add
them to os.environ, and set the path to the python modules with sys.path
 - make the various environmantal variables statically availables as system
env vars (Control Panel -> Systems -> etc.)

You can install and use both qgis or qgis-dev, therefore qgis isn't address
generally in OSGeo4W(.bat).

Start from %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\qgis.bat or %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\qgis-dev.bat,
which sets up the environment for the particular version and starts QGIS.

I've not yet been game to try 1.8 (I will soon) but with the OSGeo installer in 1.9 all of my rule based styles behave differently than in 1.7 because rendering order/symbology levels are assumed. 

Since that has been in 1.9 for a while I'd expect it to be 1.8 and I'd start there. 

-ramon.

Just to clarify things the old 1.9 now equals 1.8.  If you are running
the dev build of QGIS you are running the upcoming 1.8 release.

So yes the new rule engine will be in 1.8.

Hello Victor,

cc: qgis-developers mailing list.

I am working on the mt thing. You can see the approach I am taking in
the attached diff, but it basically revolves around starting a QThread
for each algorithm & qt signaling.
Still not sure how to replace e.g. the progress objects.

Also, created a blog here: http://sextante-gsoc.blogspot.com/
Hope that platform is ok (I have zero experience with blogs), intend
to write a short intro to my project now and on monday my first
report.

Regards,

Camilo

Hi all

Is there a wiki page describing the changes between 1.7 and next release
concerning rule based rendering ? Or this kind of wiki page won't ever
exists because it will "compete" with documentation ? Anyway, pointing
users to specific chapters in documentations will help people to knwo what
to change between 1.7 and 1.8 to adapt their projects.

We use the "new features" pages [1] and add links to the documentation here
?

Hi devs,

Back to the 1st topic : 1.8 new features :)

I have read this line in the wiki page [0] : "New scale selector with
predefined scales"

Is it related with the patch I proposed [1] ? I understood it was a new
feature, and because we were on "feature freeze", it could not be applied
on 1.8 ?

Michael

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Library linking problems when release changes -
	eg. 1.9 --> 1.8
Message-ID: <e67f7a313ae71011cbd78b019108d486@carto.net>

 Hi,

 Whenever there is a change in the major version of QGIS, e.g. 1.7 to 
 1.9 and most recently the switch back from 1.9 to 1.8 I am running into 
 problems.

 The compile runs fine but when I try to start it I get this message:
 error while loading shared libraries: libqgis_core.so.1.8.0: cannot 
 open shared object file: No such file or directory


 But the libqgis_core.so.1.8.0 is present in /usr/local/lib

 I removed the build directory and ran ccmake .. and cmake .. again, but 
 it doesn't solve this problem that it can't find the library that 
 obviously is present and recent on my machine.

 I would very much appreciate if someone could help me out here.

 Thanks a lot,
 Andreas

Hi Andi

I solved it by exporting LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

It's a bit strange since I think it used to work without this....

 Thanks Stefan and Kimaidou

 Setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH seems to work. It is strange. I was assuming 
 that /usr/local/lib was searched by default anyway. After all this is 
 the directory for libraries (next to /usr/lib )

 Well - always some mysteries we can't understand ...

 Thanks for helping me to solve the problem,
 Andreas

No I suspect not.  The predefined scales it is refering to the ones that were
there before you patch.

Hi List!

I have submitted a patch to fix the bug which related to the map tip
function. It would be great if someone could review it and get it into
master before 1.8. This is my first attemp to contribute to the qgis
project so I might have missed something regarding the coding
conventions or some other part, but hopefully not. I also have a patch
with some, IMO, improvements on the map tips. I think it would be
useful to not only be able to see just one field (the display field),
but to see all of the attributes and values of a feature in the map
tip. This should be a choice and the prefered method should be set in
the settings. See attached screenshots. Is there any interest in
submitting this into master after 1.8 is out?

Regards

Victor

if the layer is file-based get the name from the uri, otherwise get
it from name(). Is that what you meant?

BTW we need another method, right? Something like
QgsLayerItem::layerName()

I agree, having a fileName() method in the QgsDataItem class
is non-sense.

Cheers.

I understand your point.

Getting the filename from QgsDataItem::uri() has some issues with .zip
files (because of the special /vsizip/file.zip/file_in_zip.ext
syntax).  It is possible to strip the first part and get just the
filename.

Unfortunately, it seems that QgsBrowserModel::data() gets called
*very* often, even though the contents of the browser have not changed
-  when hiding or showing the window, or scrolling the browser for
example.

This can be taxing if there are many files and the filename stripping
logic has to be done on all visible files many many times.

So the 2 solutions I see are
1) have a new member fileName() that returns this effectively (say
with an internal member when creating the item) and deals with
provider-related issues such as /vsizip/ issues
2) cache the values of the data() function

This is the approach in my patches, only it is also supported in
QgsDataItem (see below why).

Also, this could use uri() like you suggested instead of path(), not
sure I understand the distinction

QString QgsDataItem::fileName() const
{
  QFileInfo fileInfo( path() );
  return fileInfo.isFile() ? fileInfo.fileName() : name();
}

Again, this works in the default case, but the function should be
overloaded for efficiency in the case of gdal ang ogr /vsizip files
(like I did in my patches)

Etienne

Well unless mistaken, you could have a QgsDataCollectionItem which is
file-based, such as multi-layer shape or qml?

Sounds great to me.

I have given you write access to the SEXTANTE SVN (as I told you, this
might change to another location if it finally gets integrated into
QGIS, but for now it will remain there, at least until the end of
GSoC). Feel free to add your changes there so we can all start testing
them. It affects just a single element of SEXTANTE (though a key
one!), so there is no risk of breaking anything else. Also, SEXTANTE
is still an experimental and unstable plugin, so I see no reason why
you should keep your code in a different place.

Regarding the progress elements, they are very simple now and in fact
only the main parameters dialog acts as a progress display. We can
maybe leave them like that (passing the progress object to the
algorithm) in a first step, and then implement some sort of signaling
mechanism

Great work so far :-)

I think we can add sextante to qgis-master as soon as 1.8 is released,
and the feature freeze is over.

+1, much easier for us to test.
All the best, and thanks.

IMHO it isn't.

In your patch the fileName method is used to get the name
displayed in the browser (see QgsBrowserModel::data() line 153),

instead in my proposal the QgsLayerItem::layerName() would be used to get
the name of the layer to load (not the filename).

You should keep the QgsDataItem::name() for filename (data shown
in the browser) and add a new method for QgsLayerItem::layerName().

BTW, I'm wondering if Radim meant the same.

URI is the string used to load a layer, path is a way to identify a
qgsdataitem in the browser tree.

Cheers.

ah ok, so name() would return the filename, whereas layerName() would
return the filename without extension, to be used in the drag&drop
operations. Sounds reasonable.
Would need to modify mime data stuff also, in QgsMimeDataUtils::Uri

what about file-based datacollection items? I guess only the layers
can get dropped to other targets, therefore no need to change
anything?

Another way is to create branch in QGIS repo and keep work in it. After
releasing 1.8 this branch can be merged into master

Uhm. I am still a bit afraid of breaking stuff, I must admit. I'll post  
patches attached to blog posts till this is more mature, ie doesn't  
randomly crash taking QGIS down. I hope we can switch to git soon, and keep  
a separate branch for mt-related code. Or maybe I should figure out how  
distributed svn works (never used it that way).

Yes, I that is the approach I have taken for now. Eventually there could be  
a mechanism for the algorithms to fire the signals themselves. It might  
also be a good thing if they react to cancel signals. Currently, canceled  
algorithms just keep running and their output is ignored.

BTW, QtConcurrent was mentioned in the other thread as nice, functional,  
high level api for threading. It has the advantage of keeping a thread pool  
around and reusing them, and, I believe, the QGIS core uses it. Only  
problem is, there seem to be no bindings for python, because of some sort  
of incompatibility with the interpreter I don't understand.

Camilo

Hello!

I've done some work to understand QGIS tools development.
Also some topology preserving simplification code has been
written. When i get it to work, I'll make a branch and post a link
to it. Hopefully, I will manage to do this by the end of this weekend.
If you want to see my reports you can visit [0] for some general
info and [1] for more detailed weekly reports.

But I want to ask your advice on one thing. Is it normal for user
to simplify all the features on a layer at once? I'm just not sure
which way is more suitable for a regular user:
- simplify all the features at once as it is now in my current prototype;
- simplify selected feature and all the corresponding vertexes of
the neighboring features;
- or simplify only selected features;
- or even something else.
Although it is not very important for current work, I want to make sure
I don't implement useless functionality.

Thank you.

Personally, I normally simplify an entire layer at once... for mapping
purposes, or simply to reduce drawing time or for computational/space
efficiency. It might be nice to also have the option to simplify
selected features only, but if this was an option, then I would expect
*only* those selected features to be simplified... and *not* their
neighbouring features...

That's my two cents anyway, looking forward to trying it out!

My 02c...

If you have a table with a geometry column, you can add a second geometry column for the simplified ones. As in the script below, for a national coastline with about 10,000 polygons

You can generate the simplified ones using a series of update SQL statements, based on a variety of criteria, including neighbouring (or not) via a ST_Distance() in the where clause.

If you hand craft the update SQL's, you can just copy rather than simplify smaller polygons (ST_Area in the where clause), etc.

A slowish way, but viable for a 1-off is to have a where clause with an ST_IsValid in the where clause testing the result of the simplification. If the where clause includes a test for the target geometry being not-null, the series can apply a large simplification initially, then progressively apply a decreasing simplifcation buffer to features that failed previous iterations, until the last statement copies any remaining features with zero simplification.

I prefer a script with a set of SQL's rather than a function, as it is easier to tweak case requirements. 

The advantage of this approach over the preserving topology simplify function is the degree of control the hand crafted SQL's provide over exactly how to simplify the dataset.

But, as always, your mileage may vary :-)

? Cheers,

????? Brent Wood

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Changes to python/utils.py
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR91htz8HymEkLT1DaJVzYU4=QQhmCQ6s9WPDaAJjTT5vQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have two proposed changes to python/utils.py [0] (and
src/python/qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp). I think I am capable of making the
Python code changes to utils.py, but would like someone to offer to
review my work, or work with me on the changes. Since python/utils.py
is an integral part of Python support in QGIS, I don't want to screw
anything up. :)

1) Python exceptions - add lightweight debug output

Currently sys.excepthook is substituted with the qgis_excepthook
(showException() method). I propose extending showException() to
include lightweight debug info provided by additional inquiries into
the traceback object(s). A similar solution is here [1].

Output from [1]'s very simple example looks like:

# normal traceback info
Traceback (most recent call last):
? File "debug_light.py", line 72, in <module>
??? pad4(data)
? File "debug_light.py", line 55, in pad4
??? return_value.append("0" * (4 - len(thing)) + thing)
TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()

# extended info on module and function/method (i.e. frame) variables
Locals by frame, innermost last

Frame <module> in debug_light.py at line 74
??? ??????? __builtins__ =? <module '__builtin__' (built-in)>
??? ??????????? __file__ =? debug_light.py
??? ?????????? traceback =? <module 'traceback' from
'/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/traceback.pyc'>
??? ???????? __package__ =? None
??? ???????????????? sys =? <module 'sys' (built-in)>
??? ??????????????? pad4 =? <function pad4 at 0x1004b8c08>
??? ??????????? __name__ =? __main__
??? ??????????????? data =? ['1', '2', 3, '4']
??? ???????????? __doc__ =? None
??? ????? print_exc_plus =? <function print_exc_plus at 0x1004b8320>

Frame pad4 in debug_light_2.py at line 55
??? ?????????????? thing =? 3
??? ??????? return_value =? ['0001', '0002']
??? ???????????????? seq =? ['1', '2', 3, '4']

This provides users and developers with pertinent info on
exception-state attribute and variable values, in addition to the
traceback. This additional output could be directed to a second tab,
in a new exceptions dialog, labeled 'Frames' or 'Variables'.

[0] https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/python/utils.py
[1] http://code.activestate.com/recipes/52215/


2) Module import - add deeper module tracking/reloading

There has recently been work on a module [2][3] that recursively
tracks and reloads dependent module imports in a way that I think is a
little more robust and flexible than the current method in
python/utils.py. I have incorporated a custom version of reloader.py
in my Plugin Editor, with good success, for live editing/reloading of
Python test scripts within a running QGIS instance. Plugin Installer,
Manager, Plugin Reloader, and Plugin Editor are the only plugins (I
know of) that utilize the reloading aspect of python/utils.py. I'm
guessing that Plugin Reloader is used extensively in development.

This correct-dependency-order recursive reload not only might allow
plugins to be fully reloaded live, even with in-module sys.path
adjustments, but also *retain* selected module states (see [2]
__reload__() description). This might mean a LOT less QGIS relaunches
during plugin development.

Message-ID: <CABoKswh9+dzzWSLPTxBC1Grm4y13Y7xHNchJB=ouR8DK3hxPVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

What did I do this week?
- Setup all the environment required to work.
- Build successfully from the android branch of QGIS.
- Build an apk and test it on a Android smartphone.
- Get better understanding of the build bash scripts that Marco made.
- Get dive into the core source code of QGIS.

What will I be working on next week?
- Get familiar with the code of QGIS related to Android.
- Try QML on Android and compare it with QWidgets.
- Create a blog for weekly reports.

Did I meet with any stumbling blocks?
- Some broken dependencies of Necessitas QtCreator.
- A missing library in the apk.

Regards,
Ram?n

Good description of  a reasonable approach Brent!  At one point, for a certain dataset, I was able to calculate a pretty reliable (e.g. still made valid features)  ratio of simplification threshold based on map scale.  I don't have the data anymore, but it was almost like an LOD level of detail approach.  

With that in mind, I'd like to see what one could do with LOD approach in OpenGL with map data - probably blows away our best little hacks ;-)  Never got to that yet :)

I agree with Carson main use case is running simplification against whole
layer. Processing only selected features may be an option, and affect only
this selected features without neighbors

In order to use your script users should load their data into PostGIS database.
So this is not universal solution

Hi,

To my understanding, the folder /usr/local is to be used for locally
compiled programs and is therefore not set by default by distributions.

That qgis is installed into this folder is defined by
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX which defaults to /usr/local but can easily be
replaced with /usr so it will work without changing the default path. If
you are releasing a package, that's the way to go.

On your development machine you might want to run a stock version of
qgis and a self-compiled one, so you don't want to install the second
ont into /usr as well. In this case you can either export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (include in .bash_profile to set it automatically) or
you can add the path it in /etc/ld.so.conf (add a file
to /etc/ld.so.conf.d if supported by your distro).

Regards,
Matthias

I think implementing exactly this approach is my second task
through the summer. Don't know what to do with OpenGL there
though. But we will see. Anyway now I know who to ask about
simplification thresholds calculation :)

And thank you all for your answers!

I just would like to clarify here that after quite a bit of discussion
at the developer meeting in Lyon, it was decided not to do RC releases
for 1.8 and to adopt a more 'master centric' approach to future
releases. There are a number of reasons for this, mainly centering
around that our developer team has limited manpower and the concensus
that maintaining additional branches is an overhead we cannot afford.
Rather our strategy will be to maintain master in as close to a
release ready state as possible, build up a substantial test suite so
this is verifiable and get ourselves set positioned to do release off
master with a fairly short turn around time.

Tim

Hi Folks

There is currently one blocker left in the queue[1] before we can
release 1.8. At this time we would like to declare a total string
freeze on QGIS 1.8 and call for final translations. Assuming the last
bug gets squashed this week, we will go ahead and make the final 1.8
branch and create release tarballs on Sunday June 3 2012.  As agreed
in Lyon, we will hold off on the final release until the final stopper
issue is resolved. Werner will send out notices to translators
announcing the final push for translation completion.

Best regards

I confirm that there are not other known regressions.

Marco,

Any chance we can work to get that into a 64 bit osgeo4w branch?
Does it use 32 bit or 64 bit python? Have you found a lack of 64 bit
windows python binaries a problem for some plugins?

Thanks,
Alex

it seems that the patch was applied or the bug was fixed anyway

It needed to be re-opened because I found and fixed issues with other
CRSs, please see my pull request :
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/144

It should hopefully resolve the problem the user is still
experiencing, and has a few unit tests.

Guiseppe,

I have implemented this and sent a new pull request, along with other
small fixes for .vrt and .gz files.

Can you look at this and if possible commit it before 1.8 is released?

Maybe you wouldn't technically classify it as a regression, but if I remember correctly, the list of "Recently used" CRSs is a new feature in 1.8, and a fairly serious bug has been introduced with it:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5030#note-5

If it came down to the choice, personally I think it would be better to revert the new feature than to leave it in with the bug.

Regards,
Alister

Hi, 

I just tested with the attached style and a sample of OSM data and I
cannot confirm... anyone else?

it is just my opinion, but I don't see this as a blocker but certainly
something to be fixed.

If you enter the "set layer crs" dialog is because you want to change
the CRS to the layer. If the crs you need is not listed in the "recently
used CRSs" then you have the filter. If you click "cancel" the CRS is
not changed regardless what was selected.

This is not a safe assumption.

I think after 1.8 release we could have two plugins, sextante and sextante-experimental.

I have just seen that Jurgen has closed the remaining blocker ticket.
Allow me and others do some quick test and then I'll clear the release
of 1.8 ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to change my plugin name
Message-ID: <1338217958615-4977484.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello.
I am trying to change my plugin (grids for atlas) package name from
synoptiquesatlas to gridsforatlas.
Indeed we are using an older unilinguist version in my firm, which is
overriden in the plugin installer by the international version I submitted.
So we have conflict? My idea was that changing the name of the directory in
.qgis/python/plugins would solve this.

The problem is that uploading the zip file gives a "name mismatch error".
The question is the following : how can I do this in a tidy way ?

Cheers.
Bert

There is no way to change the package name in the QGIS plugins
repository (plugins.qgis.org), you should create a new plugin and mark
the old one as deprecated (if you don't have the right to mark the
plugin as deprecated just ask and admin to do it) so that its clear
which should be used/downloaded.

This is kinda offtopic and probably been talked about elsewhere, but
is there any way that qgis-1.7 and qgis-1.8 be installed on the same
ubuntu system - using the qgis and/or ubuntugis repositories?

This would be nice to be able to test the nightlies (and compare with
1.7.4) without disrupting the system too much.

Osgeo4w has this, and I was wondering if the same could be done for
ubuntu/debian/other linuxes.

Etienne

Yes I do that also - I was wondering how I can install the nightly
packages without having to upgrade qgis-1.7.4 to gis-1.9.90+git...

Manual edit of core/qgsspatialindex.cpp still required for building on Mac.
Should that change be considered, or should the edit just be noted in the
Mac build notes?

It's a spatialindex bug.  It should work if spatialindex is installed in the default /usr/local, but may still need -I/usr/local/include in the cmake CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS.  Or fix your installation of spatialindex.

I added a bug report at:

Jurgen applied my fix (for bug #5598) which basically relies on
setting GDAL_FIX_ESRI_WKT to GEOGCS rather than TOWGS84.

The changes might bring a regression with untested shapefiles,
although it is unlikely.
Please test proper CRS support then loading ESRI shapefiles,
especially those which should have towgs84 parameters (that are
missing in the .prj file).

Message-ID: <CAA6k8-L2kRFutpTEuddONyswq+Bwss5CycqBzokv9Gzb+BTF3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

one of the CRS tests fails running it from latest master (9859709e9)
running against GDAL 1.8.0 on Ubuntu 11.04:

FAIL!  : TestQgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::createFromESRIWkt() 'false'
returned FALSE. (test 0 PROJ.4 = [ +proj=utm +zone=48 +a=6377276.345
+b=6356075.413140239 +towgs84=198,881,317,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs ]
expecting [ +proj=utm +zone=48 +a=6377276.345 +b=6356075.41314024

   Loc: [/home/brushtyler/projects/sources/qgis/tests/src/core/testqgscoordinatereferencesystem.cpp(221)]

The difference is due to the rounded +b value in the hardcoded version
(...24 vs. ...239).

Does the fail depends on the GDAL version or is the hardcoded
proj4string wrong?

Regards.

can you post the entire (non-debug) output of the test, which includes
gdal+proj version ?

I tested with gdal (1.8.1) and I didn't run into that problem.  It's
possible that gdal-1.8.0 gives different results.  The important part
is the +towgs84 parameters, so the test should be relaxed instead of
testing for exact proj4 string match.

I assume you are using a 32-bit version  of Ubuntu 11.04? I don't see
this using 64bit ubuntu, gdal 1.8.1

It seems that gdal in 64-bits linux reports differently than i386 by 1 digit.

I guess a better test would be to test for towgs84 parameters (either
in proj.4 string, or qgscoordinatesystem)


Compare the results of today's autotest (lucid i386 vs. amd64) using gdal 1.6.3

lucid i386: http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/testDetails.php?test=10064978&build=85452

XFAIL  : TestQgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::createFromESRIWkt()

Plus ubuntugis i386 failed because of the same precision issue,
whereas lucid-ubuntugis-amd64 passed

Hi Matthias,

Thank you for explaining the reasoning behind this behavior. I can
understand it. The only thing that surprised me is that with older
Ubuntu and/or QGIS version it worked without setting /etc/ld.so.conf or
LD_LIBRARY_PATH - so probably there was some change recently in Ubuntu,
enforcing to actually set /usr/local/lib to be included in the library
path whereas in the past it worked out of the box.

Anyway - it is fine now.

Thanks again to all!

Andreas

Hi

It even worked without setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you installed qgis in your home directory, e.g. /home/stefan/Apps/qgis_master/...
This is what confused me.

Hello again,

in case you missed the post on the soc mailing list, I have posted a
first report on this project at sextante-gsoc.blogspot.com
I haven't figured out how to attach files to blogger posts so I'll
just attach a diff to this thread, so you can have a look at the
preliminary implementation.

As said, I went with QThreads for this paticular case, because:
a) QProcess, I think, belongs in another level (the calling the
auxiliary programs layer) and I am not sure it applies to potential
backends using libraries.
b) QtConcurrent seems not to have pyqt bindings

I might be wrong on any (or both) of these points. Please comment.

Note that iterating parameter values are not yet supported. Am looking
into it, not sure if sextante or the backends make any assumptions
about the order of iteration (that is, I have to use 1 thread or
multiple synced threads) or if I can just run them in parallel.

Thanks & regards,

Camilo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WMTS capabilities error
Message-ID: <4FC498C2.5080606@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

testing the our national WMTS service with the WMTS branch of jef a 
couple of weeks ago, I was able to retrieve the capabilities and show 
the map.

But in current RC1 version (I have both versions parallel running here), 
I get an error for the getcapabilities request in QGIS:

Could not understand the response.  The wms provider said:
Could not get WMS capabilities in the expected format (DTD): no 
WMS_Capabilities or WMT_MS_Capabilities found.
This might be due to an incorrect WMS Server URL.
Tag:Capabilities
Response was:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Capabilities xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wmts/1.0"
xmlns:ows="http://www.opengis.net/ows/1.1"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml" 
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/wmts/1.0 
http://geowebcache.org/schema/opengis/wmts/1.0.0/wmtsGetCapabilities_response.xsd"
version="1.0.0">
....

Is RC1 more strict in it's validation of the schema?
What is the easiest way to check what the problem is here?

If somebody wants to test:

The service url is:

http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/tiles/service/wmts?

BUT be aware that it is serving tiles in EPSG:28992 , maybe that is the 
problem?

If you use this url as service url in QGIS you will see the tiles as 
WMS-C  (also in EPSG:28992):
http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/wmsc?tiled=true

Richard Duivenvoorde

it all goes perfect :-)

The iterating execution could be run in paralell, asumming that
several threads can open the same layer at the same time. the layer to
be iterated is converted in n layers, each on containing just one
feature, but if the algorithm uses other layers, they are used all the
same for all the executions. I guess that opening some kind of formats
might block the file, which might cause other threads to fail.

Unless we are completely sure that all file formats (or data sources,
more generally speaking) can be accesed simultaneously and
independently by several threads (which I am no sure, and I think that
might not be like that), it is better to execute the processes on
after the other, just like calling several algorithms as it happens in
the modeler or the batch processing interface.

Regards, and keep the good work going :-)

Then, in the absence of RCs, having binaries of nightly builds with a
different name so that it
can co-exist with the stable release is even more important for users
to help out
testing.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS' "fetch python plugin" does not see my plugin
Message-ID: <D8CE8E10-A17F-459B-AF0F-8B5854587A2B@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I've made a little plugin, Earthbeat, still in experimental phase.
The plugin is hosted on http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/
My problem is that the plugin does not show in QGIS "fetch python plugin" panel
(I turned on the "show all plugins, even those marked as experimental").

Could someone tell me what I should do to allow the plugin-fetch command
to retrieve my plugin from plugins.qgis.org?

To give more details:
1. I sent the plugins as a zip for approval.
2. after approval, zip was visible on http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/
but not in the QGIS fetch command.
3. I made a git repository, thinking (wrongly) that it would help
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/earthbeat/repository

My codes come with a metadata.txt file indicating the location of the git repository.

Maybe I should not have both zip+git?
Or are there some permissions to fix?

thanks!
Bruno

Hi QGIS devs,

could someone please give this thread's code a try?

I've already attempted several things with no success, namely to store
layers (vlayer), features, geometries and/or rubber bands in a list. Still
I'm unable to get the geometries displayed as rubber bands, is it possible
with QGIS?

I'm using QGIS 1.8.0-Lisboa, rev. a1255fc, Python v.2.7.2, GDAL/OGR v.1.7.3

Thanks in advance,

Germ?n

Subject: Displaying local file's geometries as rubber bands
To: qgis-developer <qgis-developer at lists.osgeo.org>


Hi all,

I'd like to get geometries from a local file (e.g. GML) displayed as
QgsRubberBands. However, I wouldn't like to load the layer into the map
because in the real scenario there could be a large number of files to get
geometries from.

I've been attempting it with the following code (you can copy it directly
to the QGIS Python Console), but only the last feature is displayed:

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from qgis.core import QgsFeature, QgsVectorLayer
from qgis.gui import QgsRubberBand

def loadGMLAsRubberBands(fileName):
    featList = []
    rb = QgsRubberBand(qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas(), True)

    vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(fileName, "layer", "ogr")
    allAttrs = vlayer.dataProvider().attributeIndexes()
    vlayer.select(allAttrs)
    f = QgsFeature()

    while vlayer.dataProvider().nextFeature(f):
        featList.append(f)
        rb.addGeometry(featList[-1].geometry(), None)

loadGMLAsRubberBands("/tmp/gml/sample_three_features.gml")
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the solution given in this thread [1] I'm storing the features in
a list, but somehow it doesn't work in this scenario. A sample GML file can
be found at [2].

Do you have any hint?


Regards,

Germ?n

Bruno,
I do see (and have installed) Earth Beat 0.75

Do you have
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml
as repo ?

Confirmed, I can also see and install it.
Its dependency on qwt5 might make it difficult to maintain it over the longer term,
however.
Thanks.

Thanks Agustin!
I did not realize I had to add http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml
to my repositories list.

Why not adding this repository in the default list? Security reason?

thanks again

maybe matplotlib? the problem is common to a few other plugins, so probably you can
share the burden of migrating.

Message-ID: <4FC4BA02.9050500@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I will by a new server to host the postgis DB and probably qgis server. 
I will not have more than 4 people working on the DB via QGIS at the 
same time. For the server, I'll probably have something like max 10-20 
users at the same time.

I have pretty no idea on what is important to choose as characteristics. 
My approximate budget is something around 4 to 6000 $ and I am tied with HP.

Do you have any suggestion?
Memory? Processor? As I think the storage needs are not huge, is it 
worth using a SSD?

Thanks a lot,

Denis

You can have it added by clicking "Add 3rd party repos.." button in
the Repositories tab of the plugin manager, this adds quite a few.

a) the approach with separate processes would be possible too, but
IMHO not really needed. The main advantage is complete separation of
execution, so if your child process fails it does not bring parent
(QGIS) with it (in contrast to threads). The disadvantages lie in more
complex inter-process communication and inability to directly use
running QGIS environment. Threads fit better your scenario - some
algorithms (e.g. GRASS) are run as separate processes anyway.

(Btw. some internet browsers (notably Chrome) nowadays use processes
(instead of just threads) for each opened tab - AFAIK the main reason
for that is security and stability - Flash plugin will break just the
tab where it crashed.)

b) there are no PyQt bindings for QtConcurrent and there is not much
sense to port it to Python: it is intended as a general high-level
interface for threading - python has its own APIs (threading,
multiprocessing modules).

Victor,

in QGIS the layer data can be accessed just from one thread at the
same time. This is limitation of either QGIS and its underlying
libraries (GDAL/OGR).  When running algorithm without blocking GUI, it
would be good to always open a new instance of QgsMapLayer to make
sure that user's interaction with GUI will not break the access to
data (e.g. simple pan/zoom operation while an algorithm is reading
data from the same QgsMapLayer instance will cause problems).

GIS Data is always more than you expect. You can do 1x SSD 120 GB for OS
and tilesets and then a 1x 2-3TB SATA drive. 16GB ram minimum, any
decent 4 or 8 core processor should do (get faster clock speed to make
your queries/wms faster). Base price for what I just described should
only run about $2500. So you can easily add another storage drive and
ram until you hit your budget.

Enjoy,
Alex

I would really like to see that functionality - in the early times I
was happy with just a traceback - a full report with values of locals
would be surely better :-)
We could avoid adding new tabs, everything could be on one page (using
QWebView and some CSS). The table with variables for each frame could
be collapsible and inline with traceback frames - e.g. similar to how
django error pages look like [4]. Also, it would be good to have a
button to easily save the error report to allow users easily attach
error details to bug reports.

I am a bit afraid of the live code reloading. While I understand that
it sounds good that it would be possible to retain module state, I
think there are various cases where this would fail, e.g. if a module
fails to reload (syntax error?) or the changes from last iteration
were more significant (change of class structure?). Also, the
__reload__() callback would need to be done very carefully as it could
cause even more trouble.

I would like to keep the "hard" reload as a default since you can
trust it to do its work. The "live" reload could be eventually added,
too, as an option for the brave ones :-)

Btw. Plugins should not alter sys.path. I know that some do it, but
that's a bad idea.

Hi,

Yes, what Alex describes should be a decent server. I would at least buy
16GB RAM or better 24GB or 32GB.

It may make sense to split the workload DB (one server) and the
app-server/file storage (another server).

The best RAID level for a PostgreSQL DB is RAID 10 and for regular file
storage probably RAID 5.

However for smaller installations everything on one server is probably
fine. An SSD for the system (and perhaps) the DB and regular hds for the
rest.

At my servers I don't have SSDs (four years ago when we bought them they
were too expensive) - however on my private notebook I have an SSD and
they are nice and fast (though still expensive).

Martin, thanks for the input. django-like error output looks ideally
suited for this proposed change. There is a lot to chew on in django's
debug.py file [0]. It has the HTML template as well as more updated
code for lightweight debug output.

I suppose a single, self-contained HTML file (one displayed?) could be
saved to disk for the error report, keeping it simple.

Using QWebViews for this type of info also follows suit with similar
work Tim posted to his blog [1].

By 'keep the "hard" reload ' do you mean the current reload function,
or the basic reload function of a reloader.py-upgraded utils.py?

By 'live' I'm guessing you are referring to the 'automatic detection
of module changes,' i.e. monitor.py . I don't think that live
reloading would be that useful for QGIS plugin development. I'm mostly
looking at this module's functionality as a more complete basic plugin
reloader. Live reloading and __reload__() functions are secondary, and
will probably cause more problems than they solve.

I think sometimes this is necessary. For example, my Plugin Editor
plugin contains several third-party packages that only work when on a
sys.path. Plugin maintenance/support-wise, I would rather know the
embedded packages, though maybe outdated, will continue to work, and
new versions can be tested before being upgraded.

Larry

Actually I was referring to the current method: unload + load plugin again.

By live reloading I meant the reloading you proposed with reloader
module, without monitoring of files. I thought that your main reason
for introducing the reloader was the ability to keep plugin state
while reloading (with __reload__() method) - if not, where is the
added value of it?

Yeah, with some 3rd party packages it makes sense. Unfortunately some
plugins simply add a plugin subdirectory that is an ordinary path of
the plugin.

Even further, we could have a button to send a full error report automatically;
obviously we have to be careful not being flooded by it. We have been discussing
about this with elpaso, it seems feasible and easy to integrate in the current web app.
All the best.

 Hi all, Hi Borys,

 I noticed recently that the Python Plugin Reloader is not available at 
 http://plugins.qgis.org/. I think that this is a rather essential plugin 
 for plugin developers. Borys or someone else - would it be possible to 
 make the plugin available in the central repository?

 Thanks a lot!

Hi all,

sorry for not responding, I had some days off.
I understand from your mails that there is a change in rule-based styles 
between 1.7 and 1.8 but I would consider it as a bug and file a ticket 
because
1) things that used to work in 1.7 should IMHO still work in 1.8, 
especially when the dialog allows me to apply a rendering order
2) rendering order works with rule-based style and no scale ranges

I extend the request to all other plugins available in old but not in new repos.
BTW, can we have a list of them?

Answer to self for clarity for list.

After little chat on IRC it appears that WMTS will not be available yet 
in 1.8 (jef has a branch if you want to play with it though, or it will 
appear in master after release of 1.8 probably)

Ok, I see. After re-reading my original post, I made it seem that the
extra feature of the proposed change, the __reload__() method, was
more my main point. Sorry about that.

A little background... I have spent some effort trying to get my
plugins to fully unload/load as many times as possible within QGIS
(via Plugin Reloader) before having to restart the app. Inevitably any
complex plugins crash (usually QGIS, too) because something is not
being removed from sys.modules during the unload of the plugin, using
the current utils.py module tracking method.

Additionally, one of the main features of my Plugin Editor plugin is
that it runs inside of QGIS. This can also be a drawback, if the
plugin you are working on requires many unloads/loads, precipitating a
restart of QGIS, especially if some resource isn't being reloaded. So,
I've been looking for a solution robust enough to be able to
unload/load most conventional plugins unlimited times - as a
development tool.

I now see your point on hard vs. live reloading of plugins (delete
from sys.modules vs. reload). Yes, avoid live reloading of plugins =
good thing, keep sanity. :^)  Still, I think there is something to
gain from reloader.py's more extensive dependency tracking
methodology.

In utils.py, the import wrapper takes a conservative approach, by only
including package-dependent plugin modules. I think reloader.py's
approach, with its global parent, creates a more complete dependency
graph. In my preliminary tests, all modules were reloaded (including
those with relative imports or sys.path augmentation for embedded 3rd
party packages).

If reloader.py's dependency graphing approach was used for utils.py's
import wrapper, for cleaner plugin unloads, then at least two things
would have to happen beyond what utils.py does now:

1) On deletion from sys.modules ( _unloadPluginModules() ), important
modules would need to be skipped (qgis, PyQt4, utils, console, etc.).
I had to do this with the reloader.py implementation I am currently
using, which is for live reloading when testing normal
modules/packages, not plugins.

2) A cross-reference check of some kind to make sure the module to be
removed is not already in another plugin's dependency graph. The
developer could then be notified that a clean reload was not possible,
and why. Since this is a plugin-testing reload, a developer is
probably ok with turning off other plugins. Normal plugin unloads
(Plugin Manager, Installer, etc.) could silently ignore the incomplete
unload, as they do now.

So, it looks like the best thing to do now is to make the changes and
test, test, test. I think the new Python exception output, with frame
locals, should come first, though.

mmmm, I had splitted it, and in fact this algorithm just calls the
angle option, but it still complains

This is your command line

v.buffer input=tmp1338388935286 angle=90 tolerance=0.01 -s -c
output=output --overwrite

and it says

ERRORE: Select a buffer distance/minordistance/angle or column, but not
       both.

But it's only passing an angle, not any of the other options!!!. Or
you are not supposed to use tolerance with the angle option?

Any GRASS expert can help?

Hi Paolo, all,
I put QGIS-devs list in cc, as I have some technical questions.

I am of course interested in saving Windows users the trouble that
comes with missing rpy2 for Python 2.7. Apparently there is little
interest from users in promoting rpy2 packaging on Windows, maybe we
did not advertise it enough, or the users feel confident to have other
reliable alternatives?

Still, I'm not yet convinced to migrate the plugin to QGIS SEXTANTE
toolbox, as the latter is a very recent addition, and moreover I have
to fully understand how data are passed from QGIS to R.

In Homerange plugin, the user selects the QGIS layer containing input
point data. The plugins Python code reads features with the
layers'.dataProvider, and creates a Python array. The array is
converted by rpy2 into a R dataframe, and R processes the data. I chose
this approach, so that R relies on QGIS' readable data formats instead
of its own ones.

May I write a similar procedure with SEXTANTE, and let R take input
data from QGIS directly? From the users manual linked by the plugin,
data are read with readOGR and readGDAL. This makes me guess that data
are imported in R independently. If so, I can simply rewrite few lines
of HR plugin code, instead of starting from scratch.

Thanks in advance for your answers.

I can confirm the issue on master and in 1.7.4 used to work. Anyway I

SEXTANTE "passes" all data to backends using files, in a way that is
transparent to the user and the developer. Basically, it passes the
datasource filename and let's the external app open and process the
data. But, it is transparent and convenient to use because if the data
is in a format that the external app does not understand, it will save
the QGIS data to a new compatible file and pass the path to that new
file. That allows to connect you app with GRASS data, WFS services, or
any other source that QGIS (but not your external app) can use as
input. In short, much cleaner and easier for you to implement :-)

The philosophy of SEXTANTE is to make it easier to implement
algorithms, taking away all the data handling and GUI stuff and
letting you concentrate on the algorithm itself.

You can use the current R implementation in SEXTANTE to make a new
script (or several), but you could also, with a bit more effort,
create your own algorithm provider extending the R one, which would
give you more control. Please, ask me if you have questions.

Hope this helped to give you a bit more insight into how SEXTANTE works

How the GUI is going to look like? Should the user enter the Python
code directly into some text edit widgets?

Right, so the interface is similar to plugins (load+unload), with an
addition of a callback when saving project. Makes sense.

How are you going to save the python code? In an external file or
embedded into XML file or even something else?

Good, it would be good to have the check done in a way that does not
disturb the user with some popups - ideally something like a "yellow"
bar that currently browsers use when asking questions.

Before, plugins had to get iface reference directly when a plugin
instance was created because there was no other way to get iface.
Nowadays when there's iface reference within qgis.utils module it is
not necessary to pass iface directly.

I would vote for 2.a: in fact when the user applies changes done to
the python code, the python stuff could get reloaded, i.e. unload
(from old code) would be called, followed by load (from new code) - I
hope this will make the transition quite smooth.

As said above, I would call them macros. But I am not insisting. But
"routines" does not sound very familiar in this context.

Hi Victor

actually there was already some motion regarding this issue. The idea
was to have a common behavior - every time a user would try to close a
project with in-memory layers (i.e. layers with "memory" provider),
QGIS should ask whether those layers should be kept - and store them
in a suitable format on disk (e.g. spatialite) and update the
references within the project. I think it is reasonable to have this
kind of generic behavior directly in QGIS since it is not just a
problem of SEXTANTE.

So we just need someone to sit down and write a patch for that :-)

+1 for macros

yes, 3 text edit widget, one for each macro.
The user has to write python code into them.

I would save it into the project (embedded in the XML) until we will
have a different way to pack project and related stuff together.

I guess you're thinking to macros that make changes to the UI so
it doesn't matter when the macro is executed,
but IMHO this kind of macros should behave like a plugin connected
to the projectRead() signal, so bound to a specific event and executed
just after the event occurs.

BTW one popup only would be needed, i.e. the project is loaded.
If the user trust macros then they become active and ready to be
executed.

I would vote for 2.c instead, but now I understand we aren't so aligned
as I thought :-)

For you macros should be like a plugin embedded in the project file,
so load and unload method, enabled asynchronously, ... (am I right?)
I guess in that case it doesn't matter if the project saved macro exists,
it could be just a iface signal the embedded-plugin load method
connects itself to.

For me they are project macros, hence strictly related to the project
events, i.e not a plugin but slots (routines) connected to signals (project
events), it has to be enabled synchronously and then a project saved
macro makes sense.

Project plugin VS. Project macros:
there's a difference, even although it seems more theoretical than
practical :-)

What do you think about?
Regards.

It would be good to be able to user something like:

import mymodule
mymodule.dosomething()

where mymodule is living in the same directory as the project.  This
would allow people to have say one Python module and reuse it over
more then one project if they live in the same directory.

Even if it is one popup that is still annoying IMO. Like Martin said,
try and think of a nicer way to do it rather then get in the face of
the user to much.  It is well known that users don't read dialogs and
most of the time just hit OK to get it out of there face, so you loose
the safety net.  Consider this approach by Office 2010:

http://peltiertech.com/images/2009-08/SecurityWarning2010.png

You can load the project, disable the marcos, tell the user nicely
that "there are macro in this project.  We have disabled them for your
safety.  What would like to do? Enable | Disable | Enable Always"

You get the idea.

Harder to implement but a nice user experience.

Again this would be a case of giving the user a option to reload the
code or leave as is for now.  I would follow the same browser/office
style notification bar to let the user decide.  If they user ignores
it then so be it.

I would prefer to have just one edit widget with all macros inside.
With 3 text edit widgets it would be complicated to have some common
utility functions, module imports etc. With one edit widget there
could the three predefined functions called by QGIS:

def openProject(...):
  pass
def saveProject(...):
  pass
def closeProject(...):
  pass

Like this it would be easier to add custom imports, utility function
and it would be simpler to navigate the code (if there are more than
just few lines).

Ok - hopefully XML will not choke python indentation :)

See Nathan's post - he better explains what I have meant.

For me the project macros are really not that different from plugins -
they have just different lifetimes.

However, v.buffer.column now throws an error:

remove the directory /opt/qgis-1.8.0/share/qgis/python/qgis/, it contains

Hi Victor,

thanks for the clarification. I usually prefer not to use files for
data exchange, therefore in HR plugin I decided to use QGIS Python
representation of the data, even if it required rpy2 to work. 
I have to test if SEXTANTE approach can be a bottleneck for big input
files - home range calculations use an increasing number of point
locations as input, thanks to GPS collar technology advancements.

Anyway, I have not investigated other solutions yet (pipes, memory
mapping, etc), so at the moment I have nothing else to offer.

I will have a closer look at current R implementation, if I have
questions I will ask you for sure! Thanks for availability.

Yes, I understand the logic now.

Building and installing from source may keep old stuff in the
previous installation path.

If you don't want that such kind of problems occur you should
consider to uninstall QGis (make uninstall) before compiling it again.

Shared lib are loaded by the OS, so old stuffs could blind new ones.
Anyway you could use the LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviroment variable
to override the path where to search libraries.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Sextante: vector to raster
Message-ID: <4FC79A9D.7080403@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I'm trying to use Sextante to convert a vector to a raster, but:
- GRASS v.to.rast does not work (ticket open)
- GDAL rasterization is missing
- SAGA and OTB do not allow easily to use an existing raster to define extent and
resolution (it is quite cumbersome to define it by hand).
Any suggestion?
Thanks.

True. Maybe it should be added

To fill the extent field you can use the extent of a layer, just by
clicking on the button on its right-hand side and selecting "use
layer/canvas" extent. There you can select a layer or even the extent
of the current map view :-) To do this you need to have the parameters
dialog not in table mode, but in the complete mode (this can be set in
the configuration, in the "general" group)

Hope this helps

Thanks for this - BTW, what is the utility of having the "val" parameter here?

I found this in saga, not in OTB: am I wrong?

BTW, I get an error while using shape to grid (saga):

An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):

You have to tell GRASS which option to use. Instead of letting the
user select it, it is hardcoded, giving just one option. I know it is
not a very elegant solution, but it is what I can think of by now.
Maybe I could introduce a mechanism to have invisible parameters, so
they get passed to the application but not shown to the user, and have
hardcoded values.

Right, I haven't changed the OTB descriptions.

I will check it :-)

Paolo, could you explain this a bit more. How would it integrate with
the web app?

If a plugin's error report is to be sent, additional info beyond the
traceback and frame locals should probably be included, to help the
developer:

* Plugin's name and version
* QGIS runtime info (like versions info from the About QGIS dialog)
* User's platform

I suggest a 'Send Report...' button in the Python error dialog that
opens a new reporting window with the following components:

* QTextEdit area for the user to write a comment on what they were
doing when the error occurred
* QTextEdit area with the generated report (additional info,
traceback, and frame locals), where the user can have the opportunity
review it and 'clean' any sensitive info
* Button to save report to disk
* Button options and some text on how to submit the report

Before the buttons for sending the report become active, the user is
required to save the report to disk. The options on how the report is
submitted would be dependent upon the plugin's 'metadata.txt' values,
with a fallback default solution.

If the plugin has an issue tracker or a homepage, there's a button for
each that would launch the user's desktop browser to go there. There
should be a default button of maybe 'Send to QGIS.org'. This might go
to a landing page at hub.qgis.org where a user would be able to submit
a report for orphaned or older plugins that don't have trackers or any
other destination info. (I think having a catch-all issue tracker like
this was discussed before.)

This new reporting dialog could be in C++ gui library, for general
reporting on QGIS issues ('Send Issue Report...' in the Help menu?),
then subclassed and extended with the custom buttons and destinations
for Python errors.

Looks like that issue was closed, and the last blocker (CRS issues) is
ok by me, but needs to be tested with an i386 linux build (ideally
from the nightlies).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Sextante: add QGIS backend?
Message-ID: <4FC8648E.9070801@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Would it be feasible and reasonable to add QGIS as a backed of sextante? This would
be useful from user point of view, to be able to run the same analyses in all
different ways. See e.g. slope and aspect: now it can be done from QGIS GUI through
grass, gdal, and native commands, and through grass, gdal, and saga from sextante.
All the best.
