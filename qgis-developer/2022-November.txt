You have to specify the QGIS profile directory path in which the symbols 
are saved.
For example :
qgs = QgsApplication([], False, 
'/home/jacky/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default')

the line "layer_settings.LabelPlacement = 4" should be changed to 
"layer_settings.placement = 4"
you can also use the enum : "layer_settings.LabelPlacement = 
QgsPalLayerSettings.Placement.Horizontal"

Message-ID: <70aef7da-4711-b155-4f89-669ec9c4f332@gmail.com>

Hi Ethan,

thanks for the work with Revolt. I tried it during the developer meeting 
in Firenze, but I did not persist in using it. Let me explain why and 
please excuse me in advance, this is a pretty long mail!

First, before jumping to a tool, I would like that we discuss globally 
the communication challenges that all those new tools bring for all 
online communities - QGIS included.

I experienced the very same situation with mailing list and a spontaneus 
Discord server ( at my paragliding club) and I learned a few things, 
both positive and negative.

# Where are we now ?

- mailing lists are dying. Younger won't jump in. Being at ease suppose 
a good email client and filter rules. And this is a pain. What is really 
unique is that they are indexed by search engine and accessible via 
public archives. We built a knowledge base each time we post a mail. 
Osgeo also offers a central hub where one can't explore existing mailing 
lists, and this was a really nice to me.? Now that Nabble is dead, there 
is no more forum-like web access. And let's not forget that some people 
just don't want to use apps, and would like to stick to mail forever.? 
So we can't stay without decision here.

- Chats are fun, but messy, and they break our community in sub parts. 
Telegram / IRC / Element -Matrix / Gitter / Signal / WhatsApp etc...? 
Furthermore, there are multiple channels that you can't be aware if 
you're not invited into. This is a serious regression, because 
transparency and public discussion is a key principle of Free software.

- Chats aren't efficient and generate too much traffic. I personnaly 
just don't have enough bandwidth to follow 10% of the channels I should 
follow. And I am pretty involved. Furthermore, each country seems to 
have its preferences on which too to use. I ended up in having 6 apps on 
my phone only for those channels. This is far from ideal. Let's not 
forget that some people will never leave IRC too :) (and some have older 
phones not supporting so many apps).

- Discord / Revolt are organized chats, with topics. They have nice 
apps.? They are still it is some kind of private place if this can't be 
found via a search engine. Maybe Revolt can be indexed?? At one point, I 
think they also start to be messy and require so clear rules for 
category / topics management, and archiving discussions. The Revolt 
instance has too much categories IMO.

- we also have issues, Pull requests and potential GitHub discussions to 
not forget here :)

- adding a new communication channel without stating officially which is 
the main channel just breaks the single source of truth principle we had 
with mailing lists. I have seen recently two feedback from community 
users thinking that there was no debate on major topics, just because 
the discussion on the mailing list topics stalled. But those discussions 
in fact did occur, but spread across those new channels, and we didn't 
have enough bandwidth to summarize the decision on the mailing list (and 
we also forgot). This is the most annoying issue.

- Side note, I didn't have a good user experience with Revolt, the app 
seems still a bit young. But I am pretty sure it will get more mature.

- Last but not least, after discussing this issue in the French OSGeo 
local chapter and with open data groups, I discovered (yet) another 
option, which is Discourse.

Discourse is a modern forum, that can act as a chat if you are inline, 
or a mailing list, and let users tune their notifications levels pretty 
nicely.? Just have a look to the main page, stating the principles of 
this tool [0]

There are tools to migrate mailman history archives to Discourse. Gnome 
project just chose this path recently. [1] (thanks Marco for your 
pointers here)

Soooo, we are all now facing the "too much choice" situation and user's 
confusion.

# How to adress this situation ?

So I would like to propose the following approach, which is basically 
the Gnome's project strategy.

 ?- Discourse as one organized and persistent place, including the osgeo 
history discussions. This would be the main communication channel. I 
will contact OSGEO to see if the system administration committee want to 
go this way for all the osgeo mailing lists.

- We choose on main chat tool for instant messaging. Discord or Revolt 
could be the choice. I would vote for open source first. So this would 
be Element-Matrix or Revolt. Revolt is a bit too much overlapping 
Discourse feature to me. Element Matrix is already bridged to IRC and 
exists.

- We let community driven channels be impulsed by groups (user groups, 
thematic groups), but let's be clear that it tends to break the 
community and should not be advertised as the official channels

I am sorry if this not goes the way you want, and we are here to debate 
and find a consensus. Adding more channels without removing others is 
confusing for all of us.

All the best

R?gis

I found your message to be very thoughtful and helpful.

For background, my involvement in qgis development is so far maintaining
the pkgsrc entry (also gdal, postgis, proj), portability testing on
those projects, and ranting about WGS84 ensembles.

I think it's really unfortunate that people object to using email, for
reasons that to me border on fashion.

Besides archives, mailinglists have another important point, which is
that the set of subscribers to a list are a community, a group that
makes some effort to belong, and people tend to remain.   I don't see
this with other mechanisms.

In particular, community doesn't happen with github; only the very few
dedicated contributors subscribe all, and, at least in smaller projects,
a handful of people deal with and respond to issues that mostly should
not be in issues.  I suspect this is partially github's fault for
pushing all interaction to their systems while not offering
mailinglists, and partly that people expect personalized support from
others rather than joining and being mutual.

Another point I think is very important is that email allows meaningful
participation by people who are only able to pay attention once a day or
even less.  Anything chat-like (which includes many forums in my
experience) generates a culture of instant discussion and moving on.
The things that matter actually happen on slower time scales, and using
fast-only mechanisms effectively excludes slower time scale people.

This is a tools issue, but I find that with email, the conversations
arrive (and in my case are sorted into per-project folders), and I
become aware of them.  I do not have to go to N different websites to
keep up with various projects.

I agree about too much traffic.  Between it being easy to type, vs an
expectation of thoughtfulness in email, and people popping into chats,
expecting help, and then leaving, I find it too much and only follow a
few.

We do, but that's proprietary software and relying on it more raises the
cost of leaving.

I think this should be  fixed by declaring the mailinglist to be the
communication method of record.

This is interesting and I don't have experience with it.  I suspect that
means the kinds of projects I tend to participate in are either
mailinglist culture projects or github only.

I am open to considering this if it functions as a non-broken
mailinglist.  That's a tall order, with From: fields correct without
messing up DKIM/DMARC, but maybe there is good enough.

I would say that open source, clients and server should be an absolute
requirement, and there should be a very strong bias to federated and
already in use.  And, I'd include "people who avoid Google push services
do not have a second-class experience".

You say Element Matrix, but I think it's really "Matrix" and people can
use whatever clients they want (and I get it that most use Element).
(Interestingly, Unified Push seems to work fine for Element and
FluffyChat.)

As a data point for what it's worth, not much:

  I had never heard of Revolt until this discussion.

  I have known about matrix for years and set up my own homeserver in
  early 2021.  (And xmpp 20 years ago, and I've been using email since

Looking at Revolt, it does seem like even the server is Free Software.
The android client is not available in the main F-Droid repository.  In
my view meeting the inclusion criteria is how you demonstrate that the
app is actually Free Software, instead of using proprietary google
libraries.

Also, revolt's terms contain:

  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
  and password, including but not limited to the restriction of access to
  your computer and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility for any
  and all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or
  password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party
  service.

which seems like it is trying to be an indemnification, and it is
clearly unreasonable.  I don't think it's ok for osgeo projects to ask
people to sign contracta with third parties as part of participating.
But, I realize I am likely viewed as an extremist.

That said, revolt's terms (for their site) are less troublesome than
many other centralized services.

Hi Regis,

Thanks for your well though email.

Despite local/platform specific communities can arise without any notice, I
agree that the QGIS project should choose one official mean of
communication. It used to be these mailing lists, but lately it's very
quite, which suggests that discussions and decisions are probably being
taken somewhere else.

So I do believe the project could/should discuss this situation. Something
that could still leverage email and that allows archiving and browsing of
old messages would be great.

Best Regards,

Alex Neto

A key feature is being able to have multiple rooms (channels) for various topics all under one single roof. Need a new room for some major thing without clogging up the main dev channel (such as Qt 6 work)? Need a room for discussing the new QGIS website aside from comments on Figma (already suggested to Anita)? Creating separate rooms for these discussions is very easy (takes a few seconds), and helps organize things, and increases community involvement and feedback.

Hi QGIS Developers,

One last reminder before I go in search of that new network you all would
have been on. It's reassuring to discover that there are other channels; at
least I can say to myself that the total silence to my call is not due to
some disinterest.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Installing pyarrow on QGIS Windows
Message-ID: <1843cd14834.19326cc248795.5033496710249968214@margo.co>

Hello,

? ? ? ? ? ? ?I am currently working on a new version of the plugin AequilibraE, and experimenting with a different workflow for adding dependencies and compiled extensions.



As of now, the user is prompted to download binaries into the plugin folder (the software required on compiled extensions for performance) and keeps a few features unavailable until the user installs the extensions by starting QGIS as an administrator and triggering the install.



This is obviously cumbersome and convoluted, so we are experimenting with installing dependencies directly to the user's folder, which is where I found an issue with pyarrow (I've tried the 2 latest versions as of today).



As far as I was able to establish, everything works beautifully up to QGIS version 3.22, but breaks in later versions (the code to reproduce is below).



My question is: Is there something I can do about this?? Does anybody have any clues/suggestions/words of advise?



Cheers,

Pedro




Code to reproduce issue:



import sys





lines = []

command = f"{sys.executable} -m pip install --user pyarrow"

lines.append(command)

with subprocess.Popen(

??????? command,

??????? shell=True,

??????? stdout=subprocess.PIPE,

??????? stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL,

??????? stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,

??????? universal_newlines=True,

) as proc:

??? lines.extend(proc.stdout.readlines())





import pyarrow as pa

Good afternoon,

The Open Geospatial Consortium, Ordnance Survey and Eurogeographics have
joined forces to bring you the Web Mapping Code Sprint, focused on open
standards that support publishing and consuming maps through APIs:

https://developer.ogc.org/sprints/19

The code sprint will be hybrid, with the in-person part taking place in
Brussels, Belgium, and the online part taking place on discord.

Whether you want to improve the support to OGC standards in the QGIS
ecosystem, or just learn more about OGC standards, this code sprint is for
you (:

Registrations are free and a limited number of places is still available
here:

https://portal.ogc.org/public_ogc/register/221129api_codesprint.php

                      Hope to see at the code sprint

                               All the Best,

Agreed. I think - hoping I am not rewriting history - that Discourse was 
created to address these issues, with keeping the advantages of the 
mailing lists.

Same here.

Clearly, but if we had gitea or a self hosted gitlab, the problem of 
having a good part of the discussions there would be the same, even with 
FOSS versions.

I agree, as long as it doesn't divert too much our workforce from 
focusing on QGIS and that we don't fall into vendor locking traps. But I 
know we have a diversity of opinions in the project.

Yep, sorry for this shortcut. I link both because many non tech don't 
even know about Matrix protocol.

Interesting. I had a look at the project info. The idea is really to 
offer a FOSS Discord alternative but the number of contributors is not 
that high (8). and the rationale behind this project is really to fill 
this FOSS alternative gap. When Discourse offers something radically 
different.

All the best and thanks a lot for those constructive thoughts. I'll 
raise this discussion to the next PSC.

Thank you all for your feedback and responses. I will try to get to them all, but may be through several emails (due to time and length).

Regis:

        Thank you for your thorough reply. I do greatly appreciate the effort you put in to your response. For sake of clarity, I will quote just the beginning portion of large sections, but my response will be for the entire section.


        1. First, before jumping to a tool, I would like that we discuss globally the communication challenges that all those new tools bring for all online communities - QGIS included.

        Yes, I agree. I had a QGIS Open Day announcement and discussion that happened a couple of months ago (you can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrvTnkGNzSw). I wanted to not only "complain" about the existing platforms, but also provide a solution. I had worked with Tim Sutton on this Revolt server, and after it's "launch" at the QOD session, I had some feedback from Amy and Alexandre.

---------------------------------------------------
        2a. Mailing lists are dying...

        Yes. It was actually shortly after the email I originally sent out, that GNOME was dropping it's own mailing lists (GNU Mailman 2) and porting them over to Discourse (as you mention later). Discourse is a forum solution (not a chat solution) that many other organizations and project use. GNOME isn't replacing everything with this one solution. They have 3 different platforms in place for 3 distinct roles/purposes.
        1. Discourse to replace Mailing Lists as the threaded discussion platform
        2. Matrix to replace IRC (which the Matrix room(s) are bridged to IRC) for use as a chat  platform
        3. GitLab for all development, patches, feature requests, etc...

        We could also aim for this kind of platform. It maybe worth while discussing with OSGeo whether they want to migrate all the mailing lists to Discourse instead (as Nabble is no more). (Discourse also has an email-able interface to still have that "mailing list" experience for those who need it (i.e. screen readers) or insist on it). Another "issue" with the mailing lists are that we (as in QGIS) do not manage it. The mailing lists are handled by OSGeo, so if we need anything related to mailing list administration, we have to go through OSGeo for that. (For instance, I had to go through OSGeo to even get me added to the mailing list in the first place as the sign-up didn't work; and even now, I'm still not fully getting the proper emails I should for this mailing list). Just a minor inconvenience with mailing lists, is the archive does a hard break between months. This thread, for instance, spans two months, October and November. One can't navigate to the October message from within a November one with the previous message by thread link.

---------------------------------------------------
        2b. And let's not forget that some people just don't want to use apps, and would like to stick to mail forever.

        Yeah, there will always be those people (see xkcd 1782). We are in a technology field that is moving forward (thankfully we aren't all still using GRASS CLI right?) We can't appease everyone. Usually in doing so, we end up offending everyone. I would think that the people who insist on still using mailing lists (and IRC) are in a vast minority. Our focus should be on the community as a whole who would rather have a more user-friendly way of interacting with this great community, than a few people who use Arch BTW, emacs or vim, and live solely in the command line (this is a bit sarcastic and humorous, and not degrading or insulting. I myself use vim (neovim) for programming and do like the command line for certain things.) As mentioned earlier, Discourse does offer an email solution for interacting with it for those people. Also, bridges to exist to bridge platforms over to others (mainly developed for those who do prefer to live in IRC). What I'm trying to say here is that we have to way the pros and cons, and who our "target audience" is for a community site.

---------------------------------------------------
        3. Chats are fun, but messy, and they break our community in sub parts.

        Yes. Chats are fun. It's great to be able to say hi to fellow QGIS members, ask for help, show off really cool maps (i.e. we're in the 30-Day Map Challenge right now). And yes, they can be messy, but organization is key. One of the purposes for choosing a platform like Revolt (and this does also include Discord) is the ability for multiple rooms for various topics to keep the chatting more organized and less messy. This is meant to unify the various groups under one umbrella (i.e. the various QGIS mailing lists are disjointed), but yet have their own space (either by a single room to themselves, or a group of rooms depending on the needs). In Revolt, all rooms are visible (unless you specify otherwise for things like a moderator chat to discuss internal things like disciplinary action against a user not following the rules). Matrix on the other hand, not so much. As mentioned earlier, it would be nice to eventually phase out some of the platforms in order to bring everyone together and keep the fragmentation minimal and purposeful (some platforms like the Facebook group would remain for the reasons why it was created and given official status). I initially created a PSC chat that only members with the PSC role could see and access. I later changed that such that only PSC members could use the room, but gave the "general public" read-only access so they can see the PSC discussion in transparency. The setup I have is not set in stone, and can be changed and adjusted as we need.

---------------------------------------------------
        4. Chats aren't efficient and generate too much traffic

        This is really subjective. QGIS has a fairly large community (but not as large as Blender for instance). Chat's have their purpose, and for the purpose of replacing a mailing list, forums would be a better alternative (Blender has an in-house forum, plus their Rocket Chat instance). Revolt wishes that people not self-host in order for their users to be able to have one login and one app for all their communities on Revolt. Maybe, OSGeo projects may also want to join Revolt? That now allows one user to have one app and access (for example) QGIS, GDAL, and GRASS all in one place (the Revolt app), similar to Matrix with Element, but with more features and space. Servers and rooms can also be muted in Revolt, so you only see or get notified for what you want. With QGIS being as large as it is, there aren't that many QGIS Masters per say that know everything in every part of QGIS. People who have expertise in certain areas can focus on the rooms that relate to their expertise and help others, and maybe even hop over to one they want to learn to expand their knowledge.

---------------------------------------------------
        5. Discord / Revolt are organized chats, with topics.

        You're not the first to mention the search engine aspect. Honestly, none of the current chat platforms are indexed by search engines anyways (maybe Facebook, but you need a FB login). If we really wanted to, a bot could be written to dump the chat out to something that can be search and indexed by a search engine. Each room does have it's purpose stated, and the mods can keep conversations on topic if they deviate. It's interesting that you think we have too many rooms. I would like to hear your suggestions on what we should have and what to remove. I made the various rooms mainly to show what we can do with this platform.

---------------------------------------------------
        6. We also have issues, Pull requests and potential GitHub discussions to not forget here :)

        GitHub Discussions are a relatively new feature to GH. Some projects like their existing infrastructure (i.e. already existing forum sites). All of the GH stuff (issues, pull requests, etc...) would obviously remain on GH (maybe remove the QEP discussion room to keep things on GH). We could use the discussions as a forum solution, however the feature is not enabled right now (it might be a paid feature, but I don't know that much about it).

---------------------------------------------------
        7. Adding a new communication channel without stating officially...

        I totally agree with this. The PSC discussed the Revolt server, and wanted to try it out before marking it as "official". This is both a blessing and a curse. The blessing is that things can rapidly change, and even be dropped under the reason of "We?re just testing it out". The curse is that it makes people hesitant to use it since its existence is "unstable". As it is not promoted officially, many don't know it even exists (hence the lack of use). I believe if more "official QGIS people" used it, it would gain more traction within the community. As for the source of truth, there is even a bigger issue between the mailing lists and GitHub. There may be a discussion on the mailing list, and another (and diverging discussion) on the GitHub issue/feature/pull request/QEP/etc...

---------------------------------------------------
        8. Side note, I didn't have a good user experience with Revolt

        I'm sorry to hear that. Yes, Revolt is a bit young, and is still in active development. Given time, yes it will mature.

---------------------------------------------------
        9. Last but not least, after discussing this issue in the French OSGeo local chapter and with open data groups, I discovered (yet) another option, which is Discourse.

        Yep (see response for 2a for details)

---------------------------------------------------
        10a. Discourse as one organized and persistent place...

        I agree. Discourse is a great replacement for the mailing lists and provides a great forum experience.

---------------------------------------------------
        10b. We choose on main chat tool for instant messaging.

        I also agree that we should choose a platform. Matrix and IRC already exist (but not managed by us, QGIS). Revolt gives far more feature and benefits than Matrix. I also agree that we should prefer Open Source as the primary choice. I disagree about the Discourse/Revolt overlap. They are very different platforms with very different purposes. Discord, on the other hand, actually implemented forums within a Discord server. However, as mentioned earlier, this is not accessible from a search engine (a forum really should be).

---------------------------------------------------
        10c We let community driven channels be impulsed by groups...

        I'm not totally sure what you mean by this. There were some discussions regarding creating a group of rooms for regional user groups within Revolt where each user group gets just a single room (Open Street Map does this with their Discord Server). This would be great for coordinating meetups and such and have other QGIS users (who may not know about the User Groups) find out about them. But, as I stated earlier, nothing is set in stone. These are details that can be hashed out later and changed if they end up going south.



Thank you for your response, I really do appreciate it. I will get to the others later (this alone took an hour to write).

+1000 for a QGIS* Discourse! Discourse is fun to use and to administer. 
Easy to automate with scripts and bots. Login is possible with openid 
and all that modern bling. As others said, it has a mailing list mode 
that should cater well to those who prefer that method. Etc etc.

I meant to set up a proof of concept during FOSS4G but ended up 
discarding that for personal reasons. Actually I had meant to make a PoC 
three years ago already https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/ticket/2306 but 
back then I was demotivated by too much (understandable and reasonable) 
effort required around with SAC, another mailing list etc. I would be up 
for *joining* a maintenance and moderation team any time, as long as 
responsibilities are well spread and shared. :) Also I'd probably be 
able to help on the initial setup and importing of mailing lists I guess.

It would be fantastic to have a friendly, open and modern, persistant, 
search-index, intuitive communication platform next to the emphemeral 
chat, focused Q&A (StackExchange) and developer exchanges on GitHub. 
Imagine people being able to e. g. showcase their work-in-progress 
GIS/mapping projects or discuss ideas and concepts in-depth, with 
illustrations and graphics.

I agree about R?gis' points about chats being kind of subdividing to 
communities, requiring lots of attention and being kind of silos of 
information (no one will "discover" information that was shared in a 
chat later, it is just for the moment and thus often a waste). On the 
other hand, people clearly want and use such modern chat systems so if 
there was a unified one, potentially for all OSGeo projects, it would be 
a good thing.

While I am a fan of Matrix on principle, the bridges are always broken 
and its UX, at least with Element and any other client I have used so 
far, is really *really* awful. I am not a fan of Revolt, if only for 
their "please don't self-host" approach which is anti-FOSS to me, but it 
was way nicer to use when I tried it in Firenze. Too many options make 
everything worse. I'd probably scream and kick, but if IRC was killed 
of, it would probably effect 5-10 people, for Matrix maybe a couple 
more. If it would mean that 50 others might join in on a better 
platform, then it would be worth it.

<rant, please don't take it too seriously if anyone feels offended by my 
tone>
By relying on mailing lists we ignore the vast majority of users out 
there, who would never touch a system that looks like 
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2022-November/thread.html , 
where every message is on a separate page, text lines are as long as the 
browser window is wide, monospace font rendering makes everything look 
nerdy and >50% of the page is the previous message above or below or in 
between the actual content of the post. It could just as well be hosted 
on gopher://

To me mailing lists are utterly outdated, user-unfriendly, confusing and 
a pain to use. You cannot edit your messages if you made tiny mistakes. 
Message threads are unwieldly messes of different quoting styles and 
signatures. There are no highlighting or formatting features. There is 
no inlining of images and people often have their attachments dropped. 
Search options are nothing compared to well search-engine-indexed 
webpages. Discoverability is zero. Following messages means having to 
submit your mail address instead of just being able to subscribe to a 
RSS/Atom feed. Using mailing lists in your mail account pollutes a tool 
for communication with an information store with (usually) pretty bad 
indexing and search capabilities. Separating actual mails from mailing 
list messages would require extra effort on the user in setup of their 
mail client, if it would even be possible. Access to older messages 
requires manual imports. Participating in mailing lists exposes your 
mail address to everyone and their spam bot neighbor. People sometimes 
reply privately by accident. People sometimes cannot easily configure 
their mail program to not send HTML mails when they are using them by 
default and with great success and happiness for the rest of their daily 
mailings.
And that's just the incoherent stream of thoughts from the top of my 
head right now...
</rant>

Hannes

PS: *or even better: OSGeo! Just imagine if there was a central, common 
place for people to talk about proj, gmt or geoserver easily and with a 
modern interface.
PPS: I do use Arch btw! Archlinux users against mailing lists unite! <o/

Sorry if this was covered before, I googled "qgis revolt gitter" and got 
no hits so maybe it was not:

Apart from IRC and Matrix there is also Gitter, with four rooms 
currently at https://gitter.im/qgis/home

Anita said a while ago that those are actually indexed on Google.

It seems to have a similar "richness" in terms of embedded images, slick 
browser interface etc compared to Revolt.

Does Revolt bring significant benefits compared to Gitter? Probably more 
control about rooms and such? Maybe also the means of logging in are bad 
at Gitter, I see Github, Gitlab, Twitter and Matrix, so all fairly 
involved, nerdy choices.

Cheers, Hannes

Hi Harrisou!

Top posting here since I cannot address the items individually. We are in
the last stages of hiring a QGIS Jr Web Developer for one year under
funding from QGIS.org. I think quite a few of the things on your list below
are things we might be able to assign to the person we appoint. So I warmly
invite you to maybe do some collaboration with the person when they
'arrive' and we can assign them tasks that will help you.

One specific point on #3 below, Mathias Kuhn was working on some Transifex
cleverness at the Firence hackfest for the web site - maybe some of this
logic can also be ported to pull instead of push for the docs.

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

Thanks for replying. I appreciate.

OK, if no one steps up meanwhile, let's see how we can collaborate with 
the new recruit. But I feel that, at the beginning, he will be more 
skilled for general coding matters ("Code/Setup" section) than QGIS 
specific issues as reported in sections "Writing" and "Triage". No?

Kind regards,

Harrissou

Yes their help would be in the context of section #1 in your list. I do
know that Anita has been looking at how to use QGIS funds to get you more
support which hopefully provides some mechanism to address some of your
other items.

How about you come and join the PSC call tomorrow evening - we regularly
discuss how we can help you and the docs team, but it might be more useful
if you are actually in the conversation!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issue with qgis Docker images starting from
 qgis:final-3_22_10
Message-ID: <CADQ4pmAkGTkGWErLag8=0i2u3GYzpJVujB+jv6Vzx1aGt=-_XA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello. I use qgis docker images to run tests for a plugin. Recently my
tests started to fail when attempting to import qgis ("ModuleNotFoundError:
No module named 'qgis'").
I normally run tests using images qgis/qgis:latest and
qgis/qgis:release-3_22, in order to check compatibility with both the
latest release and the current LTR.
With qgis/qgis:latest everything works, but with qgis/qgis:release-3_22 it
produces the error described above.
While investigating the problem, I also tried to use older versions:
qgis:final-3_22_12 -> KO
qgis:final-3_22_11 -> KO
qgis:final-3_22_10 -> KO
qgis:final-3_22_9 -> OK (it seems to work as expected until this version)
Were there any significant changes between 3_22_9 and 3_22_10 that might
have caused this? Do you have any suggestions?
Thank you,
Paolo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS python action with Expression problem
Message-ID: <661195df1cd8f73b872f0eeae95d67ac@carto.net>

Hi,

I am trying to implement a Python action in "form" and "feature" action 
scope that uses a QGIS expression, but fail to get a valid expression 
calculation.

Here is my code so far:

from qgis.PyQt.QtWidgets import *
from qgis.core import QgsMessageLog

expContext = QgsExpressionContext()
expContext.appendScopes(QgsExpressionContextUtils.globalProjectLayerScopes(form.layer()))
expContext.appendScope(QgsExpressionContextUtils.formScope(form.feature(),'SingleEditMode'))

exp = QgsExpression('t_id')

expResult = exp.evaluate(expContext)
QgsMessageLog.logMessage('Expression Result=' + str(expResult))

So even the most basic expression (getting a field value) will not work 
in my code. I always get "None" as a result.

Any idea what is missing? Am I missing a certain scope or an import 
statement?

Thank you very much for any hints what might be wrong here ...

Andreas

You need to set the feature if you want to access the feature fields.

QgsExpressionContext::setFeature( const QgsFeature &feature )

If you want the form feature values you need to use the current_value
or the current_feature functions.

Regards.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/7858) but afaict, tests
were still passing mid october (hence with 3.22.11).

Hi Ale,

Thanks for the hint!

With

expContext.setFeature(form.feature())

it seems to work.

I was assuming that adding the formScope would also add the feature 
context ... but apparently not.

Now I can continue adding the more complex expression.

Thank you for your help!

You're welcome!

the formScope adds another feature: the "form" feature which
represents a virtual feature with the values taken from the current
form status.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS attribute form - changing values with Python
 of disabled widgets
Message-ID: <67e73c5ae4f8c46c342f4d184b02812d@carto.net>

Hi,

I have a QGIS form with a number of widgets that are set to "disabled". 
I don't want the user to change these values manually, but they should 
be updated by a Python action "on demand". Hence I set the editable 
state of these widgets to False.

Now I noticed that while I can change values in the widgets with my 
Python action, the values are not stored when the editable state is set 
to "False". As soon as I set the editable state to "True", then my 
Python action works fine and the values are correctly stored.

I tried with two approaches:

QgsAttributeForm.changeAttribute()

and

QgsWidget.setValue()

Both of these work fine when editable state is enabled, but not, when 
they are disabled.

Is there any way to also change attribute values when the editable state 
of a widget is set to False?

Thanks,

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

How about going the other way around and leaving them as editable in the
config and disabling the widget via python instead?

Hi Matthias,

Do you mean disabling them with a Python init code and 
QgsWidget.setEnabled(False) - right?

Just tried it - and it seems to work ;-)

Thanks for the hint!

Message-ID: <CAGKduJ1bY4YM+FzBSLXRm1S5NEQ5KT6gbU7Czyt3hzDTLJrFVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am preparing the QGIS Windows package file (it's a zip file) for
distribution in our organization (we don't use MSI).

I noticed that the folder /share/proj contains TIF files and it weighs 584
MB, are they necessary for the working of the QGIS?

Thank you and have a nice day
Luca

Only if your users use transformations where certain CRSs in those areas 
might be involved. If you are definitely not going to use local CRSs in 
e. g. Germany or the US, you can remove those TIFs. If your users 
attempt to use those CRS, they will receive a fairly descriptive error 
message about certain files missing their installation so it should be 
easy to fix.

Cheers, Hannes

Hello,

I'm trying to load a specific timeslice from a WMS layer using QgsRasterLayer in PyQGIS.

I've found a previous thread in this mailing list which is about how to make the layer "time-aware":
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2021-May/063594.html

So far so good, I have a time aware layer - but how do I select a specific date out of the published capabilities? I couldn't find any documentation or examples on that. I've tried playing around with the temporalProperties of the layer, but without any success.

Thanks in advance for any help / hints!

PS: I also have a question on gis.stackexchange about this, which could offer some more details as well as the current progress towards a solution:

https://gis.stackexchange.com/q/444332/68322

Thanks,Val

Hello Luca,

Yes, QGIS uses it for do precise coordinate system translations. Your users
may not use all of them, but I would avoid removing it.

You say you don't use MSI, but why don't you use the OsGeo4w installer?
It's much more convenient for larger organizations. You can do a download
only installation to get all packages into a network drive folder, then
reuse that folder for all installations in the users machines.

Also, to update QGIS, all you need is to run the installer again and it
will only download the updated packages instead of all packages. Again,
first installation will fetch any needed packages, the following machines
will just reuse it.

Hi Luca,

There are certain files in this share/proj folder that you should not 
delete, because otherwise QGIS would behave strange:

- copyright_and_licenses.csv (not sure if it s necessary)

- deformation_model.schema.json

- other.extra

- proj.db

- proj.ini

- projjson.schema.json

- README.DATA

- triangulation.schema.json

- world

I also always delete all the other grid shift files that I don't need. 
It is getting a bit overwhelming with all these files (that you never 
need).

Greetings,

Andreas

Message-ID: <fb7dcc165b59b82f32f0b7fb93135f26@carto.net>

Dear QGIS developers,

The PSC is preparing the 2023 QGIS budget proposal.

We are looking for feedback on important work (such as refactoring, 
libraries, Qt6, Python, etc.) that needs consideration in the budget. 
Other than that we will copy/paste last year's budget and make some 
adjustments.

Here is the link to the 2022 budget and current numbers: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17aO8BmBfgp_tmoacjHtYCcwH6EImw2RF3zQHtai6_Rs/edit?usp=sharing

Thank you for your feedback on the budget,

Andreas

Thanks for raising this issue.
I can also confirm the regression in unit testing plugins with QGIS 3.22
with QGIS docker images.

With the tag qgis/qgis:final-3_22_9 and different branches such as 3.16,
3.28, master, everything works fine.
Starting with qgis/qgis:final-3_22_10, tests are not loaded anymore :

"""
Running test tests.runner.test_package ...
ERROR: no output from the test runner! (exit code: 0)
"""

I didn't check if it was also linked to a ModuleNotFoundError under the
hood.

I found that since version 3_22_10 the plugins folder is no longer located
in /usr/share/qgis/python/plugins but now in /qgis/python/plugins , this
may have caused the issue.

Hi,

Is this the same issue as described here https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/50729 ?

Le 9 nov. 2022 ? 14:30, Sergio Alexander Ram?rez Navarro via QGIS-Developer <qgis-developer at lists.osgeo.org> a ?crit :

?
I found that since version 3_22_10 the plugins folder is no longer located in /usr/share/qgis/python/plugins but now in /qgis/python/plugins , this may have caused the issue.

Regards,


Sergio

Thanks for raising this issue.
I can also confirm the regression in unit testing plugins with QGIS 3.22 with QGIS docker images.

With the tag qgis/qgis:final-3_22_9 and different branches such as 3.16, 3.28, master, everything works fine.
Starting with qgis/qgis:final-3_22_10, tests are not loaded anymore :

"""
Running test tests.runner.test_package ...
ERROR: no output from the test runner! (exit code: 0)
"""

I didn't check if it was also linked to a ModuleNotFoundError under the hood.

Yes it is. Thanks for linking to an existing ticket.

By the way, as we are quite a few using this image for testing QGIS plugin,
does anyone have some plans to make a smaller docker image for testing
plugins ? (It's nearly 9gb right now).

I finally found time to try this and it worked very well. Thank you!

one follow up question I have is that I can make the change visible by
running layer.triggerRepaint().

That does not refresh the values in the layer styling panel. I need select
a different layer and then select the original in order to see the changes
I've made in pyqgis. Is there a command that will refresh that pane?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS plugin - update rejected
Message-ID: <2acbf4ab-04de-eba2-9c5a-a04195b391a9@bchartier.net>

Hello,

I attempted to update a plugin 
(https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/datagrandest/ - for which I am one of 
the maintainers) on the official OSGeo plugin repo using the online form 
(https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/add/).
This was unsuccessful.
I only got the following short message:

 ??? You cannot modify this plugin.

I suppose this is due to the fact I am not the original uploader of this 
plugin.
arichard is the one who first uploaded the plugin.

Is there a way to allow more than one person to upload updates for a 
plugin?

Thank you for your help.

You can try

iface.layerTreeView().refreshLayerSymbology(layer.id())

Message-ID: <CAGy7cY=4aoqNYZL-ABfaFLsxkufR3GqycdtQ9XctK1KhGj-diw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I want to create a .msi setup for my build and my compilation was
successful. I am facing a problem while creating a .msi file.

My OSGeo4W structure is
C:\OSGeo4W
Source Code : C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22

Script folder downloaded from https://github.com/jef-n/OSGeo4W
C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22\ms-windows\scripts
C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22\ms-windows\src
C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22\ms-windows\doc

After running createmsi.pl following folders created
C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22\ms-windows\scripts\tmp
C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22\ms-windows\scripts\tmp\packages
C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22\ms-windows\scripts\tmp\unpacked
then I have moved Installer-Files folder to tmp
C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22\ms-windows\scripts\tmp\Installer-Files

Now after running createmsi.pl
It give output as

PS C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22\ms-windows\scripts> perl .\createmsi.pl
2022-11-10 21:09:08 URL:
http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/v2/x86_64/setup.ini [289659/289659] ->
"setup.ini" [1]
FIND: Parameter format not correct
installer.wxs
QGISInstallDirDlg.wxs
QGISUI_InstallDir.wxs

and creates three files

C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22\ms-windows\scripts\tmp\packages\QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.22.12-1.msi
    size 488KB
C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22\ms-windows\scripts\tmp\packages\QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.22.12-1.sha256sum
size 1KB
C:\OSGeo4W\QGIS_3_22\ms-windows\scripts\tmp\packages\QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.22.12-1.wixpdb
size 503KB

Where "FIND: Parameter format not correct" ?

Please help Jurgen Fischer

Thanks

This is supposed to run from cygwin and not powershell.

That's Windows' find, the scripts expects a "regular" (GNU) find, which will be
available when run from cygwin.

Message-ID: <CAB28Asid0ctnd3J3VzWuO8yNL3qTMnoVHQbAwH1H5hFgQphoKA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

It appears that the plugins repo is currently stuck serving up outdated
plugins information. Newly published plugin versions aren't showing, and
newly published plugins aren't available.

Does anyone have any insights/fixes for this?

The issue seems related to the PR 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/224 which has been deployed to 
production server two days ago.
The issue is fixed now.

Best regards.

Hi Benjamin

For the maintainership by multiple people, we should be able to do this by
setting multiple owners. Normally you should ask the outgoing maintainer to
do this in the plugin management areas. If they are not available, you can
always contact me - ideally from the address originally listed in the
contact details and I can manually add you. If you cant use the original
address contact AT datagrandest.fr then please provide some other way to
verify that you are a legitimate manager for the plugin.

Regards

Tim

Greetings Johannes and previous posters to this thread.

I think the discussion needs to be split in three parts:

1) The official discussion area for project discussions and decisions. In
my opinion, for better or worse, this is still the mailing lists until
something better has replaced them. For me I am happy to use discourse or
any other platform that is agreed by the PSC by direct decision or by
putting it to community vote.
2) Which chat / other platforms we allow. In my opinion we should be really
open and allow communities to gather on whichever platforms they want to,
be it FB, Telegram, Gitter, Revolt, Stack Exchange etc. We basically have
no control over this anyway and being open means also tolerating the fact
that people assemble and form subcommunities on platforms that we don't
necessarily prefer.
3) The status of 'official' chat platforms and their discoverability. For
these, we should grant 'official / endorsed' status, have them listed on
our web site, they should have clear contact points for moderators, be
allowed to use the world 'Official' in their name, be generally limited to
one per platform (e.g. the Official Facebook QGIS Group) and enforce things
like our code of conduct and diversity rules.

I think trying to police or control things beyond this is largely pointless
as we cannot as a project dictate how and where people choose to
collaborate.

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,
I can testify Benjamin is legitimate here, as a very well known and famous
figure of geomatics here in France. Go for giving him the plugin's
ownership ?.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Opening,
 closing and removing 3D Map Views from Python?
Message-ID: <32cac38d-c7ab-a610-fd9b-62c89f74116c@wheregroup.com>

Howdy!

I've been looking around to see if we can open, close and remove 3D map 
views from Python code and I ended up not sure if or how :)

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/3d/qgs3dviewsmanagerdialog.cpp 
shows some handling of those views and the QgsMapViewsManager.

In that, https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/qgisapp.cpp is 
used as it provides various methods around this, e. g. open3DMapView, 
close3DMapView, duplicate3DMapView, ...

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/gui/QgisInterface.html#qgis.gui.QgisInterface.mainWindow 
says that iface.mainWindow() "Returns a pointer to the main window 
(instance of QgisApp in case of QGIS)". It returns a QMainWindow though 
and the *3DMapView methods are nowhere to be found.

Is there any way to control and manage 3D map views from Python?

Cheers, Hannes

Morning everyone! Hope you had a good weekend.

I've got a small cmake compilation error when trying to build QGIS 3.28
(from git release branch r49-gdd47d4ab7e9).

The error looks like its from a change in laz-perf:

Hi Johannes

Currently those methods are not exposed. It is not straightforward to
expose them, because classes like Qgs3DMapCanvasWidget are only part of the
QGIS application, not one of the QGIS libraries.

Martin

Hi Martin,

thanks for your quick answer :) Dang, that's a shame but totally 
understandable at the current stage. Can't wait for being able to have 
scripting fun with it all! Is this on a roadmap or not planned so far?

There are no interfaces for accessing existing 3D map views either so 
far, correct?

Thanks,
Hannes

It's only in my wish list, so currently no roadmap and no estimate when
this would be done...

Not really... All the 3D stuff has quite limited python support - one
reason is the fact that some classes should be moved to a library, another
reason is that we would need to get also PyQt3D dependency [1] to deal with
Qt3D objects (python bindings for Qt3D are not part of PyQt).

Thank you!

I'll sprinkle that info around on the StackExchange questions, quite a 
few people asked about this. :)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Project loader profiler Postgres Layers
Message-ID: <MRXP264MB0261C1928DBD450597A5A44EF3079@MRXP264MB0261.FRAP264.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi,

I?m profiling large project loading, I think this mailing list doesn?t support images, so I won?t post any.
I?m posting in the dev mailing list since I dived into the code and found nothing ?.

When you load a Postgres layer, the profiler list 3 steps:

  *   Read layer metadata
  *   Read layer fields
  *   Create postgres provider

This ?Create postgres provider? takes a while on some table (I have ?use estimated table metadata?. In the connection.)

I `git greped` the code and cannot found where this ?span? happened and what requests are made to the server, I could look out on the server logs, sadly I don?t have access to it :-/

I already saw some weird behavior on 3.28 where QGIS launch ~25 SQL requests when loading a new layer, but I?d like to have solid fact before posting an issue on github.

Thx, R?mi.

Hi Remi,

Which profiler are you talking about ?

Did you try to use the the new Debugging/Developement tool ? It's new
since QGIS 3.26 and will give you the list of requests and the time
spent for each one when loading a project/layer or opening the attribute
table.

Regards,
Julien

Hi R?mi,

During the provider creation, a lot of SQL requests are made to check a 
lot of thing even if the use estimated metadata is checked :
* Fields list
* geometry type
* primary key
* extent
* capabilities (read, insert, update, delete)

You can take a look at these PRs to have an idea on all the SQL request 
made at the creation :
* https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/49440
* https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/50186

Regards,
Ren?-Luc

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Windows debug build
Message-ID: <bd7e34e9-b9d8-e405-13af-67c4e54f55de@asman-technology.com>

Hello,


I'm trying to integrate QGIS C++ API into a Qt project (MSVC 2019 64bits 
and Qt 5.15.2 on Windows 11).

I used qgis-ltr package successfully for release build, but is there a 
debug version available ?

I've tried to compile QGIS from source and did generate lib files but I 
suspect some linked libraries are still in release mode, generating 
problems on my qt software (only in debug mode). Do I have to compile 
every dependency from source to ensure debug mode ?


Thanks

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to restore dock widget plugin size after
 relaunch of QGIS?
Message-ID: <AS8P190MB12067E47F21F6473F7F33193A2079@AS8P190MB1206.EURP190.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi,

I am working on a QGIS plugin which is based on QGIS plugin Builder dock widget template. The default behavior of this template is that the dock widget is not restored after closing and reopening QGIS. Here is the repo of my plugin:
https://github.com/jbp35/layout_panel

I managed to reopen the dock widget automatically when QGIS starts by calling the run() function from initGui() function. However, the dimensions of the widget is not saved and I am not able to figure out how to restore the width and height of the widget. I tried to use QDockWidget::restoreGeometry without success. Could someone please point me how to achieve this? Thanks!

Best,

Hi R?mi,

During the provider creation, a lot of SQL requests are made to check a lot of thing even if the use estimated metadata is checked :
* Fields list
* geometry type
* primary key
* extent
* capabilities (read, insert, update, delete)

You can take a look at these PRs to have an idea on all the SQL request made at the creation :

Hi Remi,



Which profiler are you talking about ?



Did you try to use the the new Debugging/Developement tool ? It's new

since QGIS 3.26 and will give you the list of requests and the time

spent for each one when loading a project/layer or opening the attribute

table.



Regards,

Just to clarify -- there's two useful tools in the
Debugging/development tools here:

1. The "Project Load" profiler, which gives an atomic list of actions
taken during project load and how long each took. That's been around
for a number of years now.

2. The new (in 3.26) "Query logger", which lists all database queries
performed by QGIS (and how long they took).

Given that the slow loading of the postgres layers was found through
the first tool, the second tool (the query logger) is the best one to
determine exactly which queries QGIS is making against the database
are the cause of the slow postgres loading times.

Try calling .setObjectName() in the constructor of your dock widget
subclass. That's required for the standard QGIS dock arrangement
save/restore code to work correctly. (That's all that's needed -- you
don't need to manually do any calls to saveGeometry/restoreGeometry).

Also I suggest using the QgsDockWidget subclass as the base class for
your widget, as it has some extra niceness added on top of the
standard Qt QDockWidget class.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Adding geographic filter to browser panel ?
Message-ID: <a3e5ee56-c515-bb5e-3679-47378e5bd96e@univ-brest.fr>

Hi,

It's great that it's possible to filter layers by name in the browser 
panel. Having the possibility to show only layers intersecting canvas 
extent in browser panel could be also quite useful (or maybe some other 
kind of geographic filter ?).

How complicated would it be to add this functionality to QGIS ? Is it a 
"small" task, and if so where to begin, or would it require funding ? 
Sorry if this is a naive question ! And do you think it would be useful 
to have this in QGIS ?

Thanks for your answers !

Julie.

Thanks, adding .setObjectName() in the constructor of the dock widget subclass worked to restore the dimension of the widget. However, the dock widget does not show automatically at QGIS startup even if it was open during the last session. What is the proper way to achieve this?

 Here is the code that I'm using to initialize and run the dock widget:


    def initGui(self):
        """Create the menu entries and toolbar icons inside the QGIS GUI."""
        
        self.log("init")
        
        icon_path = ':/plugins/layout_panel/icon.png'
        self.add_action(
            icon_path,
            text=self.tr(u'Layout Panel'),
            callback=self.run,
            parent=self.iface.mainWindow())
                
        if self.dockwidget == None:
            self.dockwidget = LayoutPanelDockWidget(self.iface, self.iface.mainWindow())
            
        self.dockwidget.closingPlugin.connect(self.onClosePlugin)
        self.iface.addDockWidget(Qt.LeftDockWidgetArea, self.dockwidget)
              

    def onClosePlugin(self):
        """Cleanup necessary items here when plugin dockwidget is closed"""
        self.pluginIsActive = False


    def unload(self):
        """Removes the plugin menu item and icon from QGIS GUI."""

        for action in self.actions:
            self.iface.removePluginMenu(
                self.tr(u'&Layout Panel'),
                action)
            self.iface.removeToolBarIcon(action)
        # remove the toolbar
        del self.toolbar


    def run(self):
        """Run method that loads and starts the plugin"""
        if not self.pluginIsActive:
            self.pluginIsActive = True
            self.dockwidget.show()

Hi,
Any chance someone looks into this issue, please? Thanks.

And generally speaking, should the LTR branding not also concern the docker image we output? This 3.22 docker image is broken for weeks (or almost 2 months according to others)...

endpoint https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search was used originally.

Since
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/42011
we are using our own Nominatim endpoint -> 
https://nominatim.qgis.org/search

Are we still bound to the OSM Nominatim TOS (e.g. the QGIS endpoint uses 
in fact the OSM endpoint) or do we need technically such request 
throttling also for our own endpoint?

If not, maybe we could reduce the delay in-between queries to improve 
UX.

Cheers,
Bj?rn

Message-ID: <da61d526-3f78-0f39-ef57-86829d929497@doublebyte.net>

Hi All,

I was wondering if you think it would be a valuable feature, to add 
support for the newly approved OGC API Tiles standard in QGIS [1].

This way, users would be able to add layers published with OGC API 
Vector Tiles [2].

There is an upcoming code sprint covering OGC API Tiles next week [3], 
so it could be a good opportunity for me, or anyone else who is 
interested, to start working on this.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this,

 ???????????????????????????? All the Best,

 ?????????????????????????????????? Joana

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Offering QGIS installers through Windows store
Message-ID: <1669148217387.3400481725.2379542994@gmx.at>

Hi,

With QGIS functionality and user base constantly growing, the required
maintenance also keeps increasing.
To keep our project budget sustainable, we (the PSC) are considering
investigating the possibility of offering a Windows installers for sale
through the Windows store in addition to the free installers from qgis.org.

This approach would follow the example of projects such as Krita
(https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/).
It would give our users an additional low-threshold way to support QGIS.
And - if I understand the Krita offering correctly - users will also get
automatic updates when new versions come out which is a nice service.

Of course, we will keep offering the free installers and using the store
would be completely optional.

If you have any experience offering software through the store, your
insights would be very much appreciated since we are still at the early
stages of exploring this option.

Regards,
Anita

Message-ID: <65a80ef7-514a-5ead-2ab0-4987f7d02a16@gmail.com>

I'd like to ask a question about Linux installers whilst I'm here.

Software like Firefox is shipped as a tarball that I can just unzip to a 
folder of my choice in my user profile. It saves a lot of time when 
reinstalling Linux when these applications are already in the existing 
user profile on my computer.

Is this an option for Linux installations?

Hi Anita,

A version in the windows store would be great.

I have had a look at this in the past (2 years ago):

- There is a requirement for every library in the package to be "UWP
compatible".
  At that time, libpq (postgresql) didn't have that, so I stopped. It's
hard to say how many other packages will also need special attention. [1]

- Python package management *might* also provide some challenges.
  I think the system is locked down to only run "signed code", I assume
pure python code is fine, but anything that comes with compiled binaries
will likely not work.
  Also for the "pure python" modules, we will need to define how to deal
with these (currently QGIS doesn't offer any internal "install dependencies
from pypi" functionality and I don't think we can have a osgeo4w installer
inside the package)

- Code signing needs to be taken care of

- A manifest needs to be written

Cheers
Matthias

Dear Developers,

in my freshly compiled QGIS a news feed for https://conf.qgis.osgeo.fr/ 
is displayed. As I am currently also helping to organize the FOSSGIS 
(https://fossgis-konferenz.de/2023/), a german FOSS4G, I was wondering, 
if we could also refer to this for German speaking QGIS users in the 
QGIS News-Feed?If so - despite it?s not a conference primarily focussing 
on QGIS -,? who may I contact to create a message according to 
https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed#endpoint-and-accepted-parameters?

Greetings from Berlin,

Interesting. I know that people have contributed in the past fixes to 
make PROJ *compilable* with UWP, but as we don't have a CI target for 
that, it is unknown how it behaves at runtime.

GDAL likely fails to build with UWP according to 
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/1201

Without a CI target that can be hooked into github action (maybe that 
exists. didn't check), UWP compatibility on the long term is going to be 
hard to achieve.

Message-ID: <14439369a86a45adbd00ada4d1d255a9@juntadeandalucia.es>

Hello everyone, 

my name is Jose and I have just suscribed to this mailing list.
Apologies if my English is not very accurate, as I don't practice it
very often here in Spain :-) 

My organization is having problems when using QGIS 3.14.15 with the
"SIGPAC downloader" plugin. And I haven't found any bug tracker for that
specific plugin so according to the QGIS Plugin page I should report the
problem on this list. Upgrading to QGIS 3.22 doesn't solve the problem. 

The first issue comes when the plugin is installed. An error says "The
plugin 'sigpac_downloader' could not be loaded because an error ocurred
when calling the classFactory method" (translated from my spanish
version of QGIS) 

The full error trace is provided in the attached document
"SIGPACDownloader_install.txt" 

However there is apparently one workaround to that issue, you just have
to select "reinstall" plugin and it finishes ok. After re-entering QGIS,
the plugin is loaded and the menu entry appears in the "plugins" menu
entry. 

But the real problem comes when trying to use the plugin: The SIGPAC
Downloader window opens and says you have to accept the Terms Of Use.
When clicking on the proper button, a new window opens with blank
content (nothing is loaded) and after a few seconds the QGIS "Unexpected
Error" window appears suggesting to report the crash and quit the
program. The crash report is enclosed in this email as "stack.txt" 

Some relevant information about our QGIS settings: An HTTP Proxy is used
for web connections, so the server, port, username and password are set
in order to access the plugin repository. 

Looking forward to read from you. 

Kid regards, 

Jose.

The C++ API site is updated near to the end of the debian "nightly" builds.
Last round started Wed Nov 23 00:03:05 UTC 2022 and is still underway.

The previous started Sat Nov 19 21:26:11 UTC 2022 (manually triggered some time
after the still running "nightlies" from before the release finished) and ended
Tue Nov 22 12:11:18 UTC 2022 (long "night": 2d14h41m26s).

So the current state is from back then and will be updated once the "nightly"
finishes.

pyqgis however is updated independantly.

Hi all,

Maybe we should a few explanations to the budget draft - since there are
some substantial changes compared to the last year budget.

We increased two budget items:

   - Maintenance / Sysadmin QGIS.ORG server infrastructure
   - QGIS documentation contribution

The intention is to allow for a regular small salary on these two items for
one person on each item. It is an experiment next year - and if it works
out well, we may continue in 2024.

In exchange for these two increases we had to decrease other items. We
slightly decreased the "bug fixing" positions, and unfortunately also the
"QGIS grant" section had to be reduced to 10k.

If there is additional income, we can again increase the bug fixing items.
We'll also monitor the 2022 income and if it increases substantially until
the end of the year, we will probably increase the bug fixing items.

Do you have any questions or remarks on the budget draft for 2023?

Thank you for your feedback,
Andreas

Hello,

Thanks for sharing the budget with the community.

A?few questions / remarks :
- in most countries, we can see a general inflation, having consequences on every kind of costs ( hosting, salaries?). Did you take this context into account when preparing the budget, especially when basing planned 2023 costs on actual 2022 costs ?
- the cut on Grant budget is really hard. With a "reasonable" mean budget of 5K per grant, this would mean 2 grants only this year. It sounds more or less like the end of the grant program. Who would candidate if chances to be selected are really low ? Wouldn't there be a way to mitigate it a bit, through various smaller budget reductions to other budget lines ? The increase in documentation contribution is huge compared to the grant decrease. I fear that we loose grants as a mean to attract new core developers.

My most important remark is about "allow for a regular small salary .. for one person on each item". Disclaimer :?I am quite strongly against QGIS.org having employees. If we are in the process of having "regular workers" for qgis.org, then we really have to work hard on :
- having a clear, written and transparent process for how to select these people
- .. process including a fair way for anyone to candidate
I may have missed some communications, but I have not seen this in place up to now. This is definitely something we have to put in place before having some internal troubles.

Best regards,
Vincent

Hi Vincent,

Thank you for joining the discussion.

We did not really discuss the hourly rates at the budget meeting. From 2021
to 2022 we raised the hourly dev rates from 100 to 110 - and the hourly
documentation rates from 40 to 44. I know that both rates are low. We can
discuss raising them again.

The plan for the two positions was not to have direct employees of QGIS.ORG,
but to use a proxy company, in our case Kartoza, to act as the employer.
Also - our budget does not allow regular European or North-American
salaries. With these limitations at hand, we can use Kartoza as a proxy to
hire employees in certain parts of the world where the salaries we can
offer can be attractive - and where they have talented people to work on
some of our issues (sysadmin, documentation, etc.)

For the documentation part: Tim and Harrissou are involved in the selection
process of the candidates.

I agree that the grant budget with 10k is not very attractive. We also
discussed skipping it for one year. Not sure what is better ...

BTW: you can all help to find new sustaining members ... that would
increase our budget and would allow us to pay better hourly rates ...

I wish we had a larger budget at hand than the +/- 200k ? we seem to be
able to attract each year. From certain countries where we know we have a
lot of QGIS users (France, Italy - just to name two of them) there are not
a lot of sustaining members or donations other than from a few private
persons and very small companies. Maybe companies like yours could help us
to get in touch with the larger companies with a lot of QGIS users that
could become new sustaining members ... Do you think that would be possible?

Andreas

Hi all,

re the "QGIS packaging work, incl. OSGeo4W, Ubuntu/Debian and Mac builds"
item - I am listed as community manager, but MacOS builds are not under
openGIS/Denis. Maybe you change it in the docs?

Thanks,
Peter

sneaking in from the ouside ...

Hey guys and girls,

you are providing the world (including million-$?-companies) with an
awesome "product" with a budget worth maybe 50 ESRI-licenses!!!

There has to be a way to grab those big players by the balls! THEN such
discussions about payment rates would start to make sens.

Maybe investing some money in marketing psychologists who can help
developing a campaign for that? Obviously different abilities apart from
software development are needed for this.

Just my two micro-cents
Bernd

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Long filename/filepath causing git issues
Message-ID: <CAOM0XWDdt+KDQwek4xxwKtY+LgJ2_gCMAO8gQLCXtwQes=aCUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings everyone,

I'm not sure it warranted a bug report but some control image now have
names that are frankly too long and are causing issues in git if the local
report folder is located some level down.

Would it be too crazy to shrink down some offending name to prevent error
when switching to more recent branches? I can submit a PR if needed.

Here's one of the error I got
'tests/testdata/control_images/labelingengine/expected_label_curved_line_allow_upside_down_hint_reversed_right_positive_offset/expected_label_curved_line_allow_upside_down_hint_reversed_right_positive_offset.png':
Filename too long

Thanks,

Alex

I am not objecting to shrinking, and don't really have standing to, but
can you explain the platform and what you think is going on?

That filename is 210 bytes long, which doesn't seem that big.  Do you
know what limit is being hit, in which program or the OS kernel, and
what properties the file name needs to have to avoid the problems?

I just checked on the box I am reading mail on (NetBSD), and it looks
like PATH_MAX is 1024 bytes.  That actually seems like a low limit these
days.   I am unclear on what the values are on other systems, only that
I have ~never run into this.

Windows has fairly shorter path limitation by default (see

Seems like a good idea. You'll likely have to change references to that 
file in the test suite.

Hello,
I need the GRASS add-ons v.surf.icw in qGIS version 3.22.8, but it is not
figured among the installed add-ons of the GRASS plugin. How do I install
it in qGIS?
Thank you very much,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] missing info in INSTALL.md,
 partial trip report for 3.28 on NetBSD
Message-ID: <rmibkorqktt.fsf@s1.lexort.com>


For background, I have been maintaining the pkgsrc entry for qgis for a
while, and have been staying on LTR, partly because it's easier, and
partly because it sems a packaging system with only one entry should be
LTR, with a secondary entry for the current non-LTR release (which is
sometimes the same, as I think it is now).  I run qgis on NetBSD/9 amd64
and generally it works well, with only a few spurious error messages
(which I suspect are bugs and haven't tracked down.)

In updating pkgsrc from 3.22.13 to 3.28.1, I ran into a minor issue,
which I'll be sending a PR for, but that led me to notice that in
INSTALL.md's "overview", the list of dependencies is incomplete.  (I
realize there are a number of detailed sections for particular systems,
but none of those apply to "a system that more or less complies with
POSIX but isn't listed".)

I'm running my missing list up the flagpole before sending a PR, since
I'm guessing a bit:

  - C++11 compiler (right now, it doesn't even say you need a C++
    compiler).  I see C++17 in a MSVC ifdef, but perhaps that's a
    workaround.  I really doubt C++03 is ok.  And yes, I realize that
    qgis depends on complicated C++ things and hence inherits any
    language version requirement that they export via headers.

  - GNU make, >=4.3

and questions;

  - Is python 3.7 still ok?  In pkgsrc qgis is marked not-for 3.7
    because of gdal, probably because of numpy, but perhaps qgis itself
    works with 3.7?  Also mapserver support is said to need >= 3.6.

  - SIP is said to be >= 4.12.  Does that mean sip 5.5.0 is ok?  6.5.0?
    My impression is that SIP is not API stable, so a >= requirement
    doesn't seem quite right.

  - Is it necessary that the SIP used to build qgis be the same SIP that
    was used to build py-qt5?

Hi Greg,

Cannot help you with most questions, but I'd say: create some PR's (also 
on install.md), THEN you will get to the people who know this :-)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Mesh Layers: Way to update/repaint the
 QgsMeshRendererScalarSettingsWidget after recreating color ramp
Message-ID: <23925e8c5c78d7027c4bbe303c1d3d37@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

I'm loading/styling QGIS via pyqgis.
I create my own (dynamic) color ramp, which is shown in the map.

My issue now is that the color ram in the Layer styling widget does not 
represent the actual ramp I created (see screendump).

I can force a 'repaint' of that widget, by adding a value in the gui via 
the green PLUS sign (and throwing it away).

Is there a way to do this 'update' of the widget via code?

There is no way to get to the QgsMeshRendererScalarSettingsWidget (other 
then maybe walk over the ui widget tree) is it? Or some signal I can 
emit?

Anybody an idea?

Or is this not something that is foreseen (I mean: loading/styling mesh 
via python code)?

Thanks for any hints,

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS expression to get internal ID of a feature in

Message-ID: <fc3e9bf5223e4b66cb5eb6eb4c8aa990@carto.net>

Hi,

I am looking for a way to find out the internal id of a related layer 
with a QGIS expression.

@id and $id only work directly on the feature of the source layer, but 
not on related layers.

attributes(
    get_feature(
       'Other Related Layer',
       't_id',
       fkey_value
    )
)

doesn't contain the internal id of the other layer ...

Any ideas how to get access to internal ids of other layers?

Thank you and greetings,

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

in case of a relation 1:many you can use the /relation_aggregate/ 
function, something like:

/?relation_aggregate('test_n_318_fk_test1_7993_id','concatenate',//to_string(@id),',')/

where the first parameter is the ID of the relation.

Hope this helps...

Hi Richard,

Can you precise how do you set the color ramp to the mesh layer ? Maybe you
set only classes (color/value) ?

Greetings,

It seems there is a local solution by changing a git settings or two ( see
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22575662/filename-too-long-in-git-for-windows
).

Given that there's a workaround, I'm more hesitant about proposing a PR as
it can be fixed locally (though might require admin right).

Cheers,
Alex

Hi Vincent,

Thanks for looking in my mail. These are my first Mesh experiments (using pyqgis). So maybe I'm totally off.
So yes, I'm only setting classes... Hoping that with that I'd also set the Color Ramp?

Usecase is: some model creates nc files (with 100 datagroups), the plugin or script should select one group (the one showing) and then either create some color ramp on the fly (logarithmic).
OR select a ramp which is not in the dropdown, but in the plugin as a .txt file like the one below

Thanks for any hints.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Stefan,

I got it work with "aggregate()" not with "relation_aggregate()"

Not sure if relation_aggregate() works in both directions?

I also got a warning "The generated relations for a polymorphic relation 
cannot be used" ...

I have inheritance in my data model - maybe that is the cause that 
relation_aggregate() doesn't work, while aggregate works.

------------

Here is what works for me:

with_variable(
   'vereinbarung',
   get_feature(
     'Vereinbarung',
     't_id',
     vereinbarung
   ),
   aggregate(
     layer:='Vereinbarung',
     aggregate:='array_agg',
     expression:=@id,
     filter:=t_id = attribute(@vereinbarung,'t_id')
     )[0]
)

'Vereinbarung' is a geometry layer in my project that is related to a 
no-geometry table from which I want to trigger an atlas rendering ...

It is a pity that a "feature" doesn't contain it's internal ID in the 
attributes ... it would make it much easier! No silly workarounds with 
aggregates to get access to an internal id ...

Thanks a lot for the idea with the aggregates!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] createvectorTable error: Could not retrieve driver
 for connection
Message-ID: <3d7f0c0a-9cd4-041f-1489-ac149f8e9f3e@terglobo.nl>

Hi developers,

Recently some users of my plugin started getting errors in the code that 
creates a .gpkg file with a table. I wrote a piece of test code:

gpkg_fn = '/home/raymond/tmp/test.gpkg'
md = QgsProviderRegistry.instance().providerMetadata('ogr')
conn = md.createConnection(gpkg_fn, {})
fields = QgsFields()
fields.append(QgsField('key', QVariant.String))
fields.append(QgsField('value', QVariant.String))
conn.createVectorTable('', 'test', fields, QgsWkbTypes.NoGeometry, 
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(), True, {})


That last line *sometimes* results in this error:

_core.QgsProviderConnectionException: Could not retrieve driver for 
connection



I cannot reproduce the error on my laptop (Linux), but Richard tried a 
few QGIS versions in both Windows and Linux and *sometimes* got the 
error and sometimes not. Even in the same application, the error 
disappeared after running another version of QGIS simultaneously... :/

No clue if this error is GDAL or Qt or whatever related, pretty puzzling 
for me. Hope anyone can help!

Kind regards,
Raymond

Message-ID: <CAGy7cY==gF33XP1CjcTFd6E3YiTXQB_exObHDnzwQj5Kg5r9BQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have line data in Postgresql and while computing lenth of line using

A lot more information is required. Can you open a bug ticket with
reproducible project and sql dumps please?
