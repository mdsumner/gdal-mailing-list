confirmed, saga is back with its 235 algs.
Checked a random one, it works.

sweet! Nathan, would you like me to open a feature req, to better
document the process?
BTW, maybe the tabs could stick, so one could preview previous projects
also during normal work. Opinions?
All the best.

Hi,

I've submitted two Pull Requests :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2189 and
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2322 that stay in a undetermined state ...

The first one (2189) is of particular interest here. It has been opened
in the beginning of July and I've been fixing issues spotted by others
(mostly Nyall), unfortunately at a lower pace than I would have liked,
busy on other projects.

But agreement from other devs seemed needed to accept it. And ... this
agreement never came before the beginning of the feature freeze ...
So can you confirm this is now out of the scope of the 2.12 ? Or is
there a chance this would be an exception ?

I guess this happened because everyone is busy, but it is not an easy
situation for me.
It becomes hard to target a particular release version when selling the
integration of new features and then it does not enforce confidence of
funders, I think.

Do you see solutions to that for the future ? Probably the problem is
that integration of paid development depends on decisions made by
third-party developers that do their best to review PRs, but without
guarantee (i.e. are not paid specifically for that). What do you think ?

Hello Hugo,

I don't know the details of your PRs but generally speaking I fully agree
with your concerns about paid developments and uncertainty of PRs
acceptance.

Hopefully the new commitments of the PSC about the PRs queue handling will
solve this problem in the long run.

Not sure what's the rationale for that line, since I am no GRASS
expert, but this commit should fix it

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/87d8a12e79a4c889d72245fb2b3ba22100aab59f

I am not sure to understand the problem, i.e. what happens with qgis
server that does not with the regular map canvas ?

But to answer your question, there is already a margin taken around the
map extent :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/symbology-ng/qgsinvertedpolygonrenderer.cpp#L95

This is completely arbitrary (x5), but this is just to cheat the concept
of an "inverted" geometry that does not really exist in QGIS. So we can
bump up the factor to say x10 ... and it will just translate the problem
a bit further ...

The solution proposed by Nyall (adding the possibility to have an
infinite distance if I understood correctly) is better I think.

Alternatively I had the idea of showing it at the bottom of the recent
project page with a close button (and a don't show again checkbox),
similar to the message bar.

It would be nice to have the possibility to get back to this page, but
as Kari said, it takes away screen real estate. What do you think about
bringing the page back when somebody clicks "open project" and embed a
file browser window next to the previous projects?

We could also have a menu entry in the "Help" menu or "Project" Menu to 
bring back the start screen?

Or we could have a "Close" project which would bring back the start screen.

I deliberately did not set the milestone version to 2.14 on

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2322

but I did not feel comfortable enough myself to merge it (not due to
lack of quality of the PR but due to lack of expertise).
+1 from my side to have this merged IF sombody can step in and give it
an additional review.

In general, I try to filter and roughly review PR's and delegate them
wherever possible. I agree that they need more attention and a stance on
this problem by the PSC is highly appreciated.

Hi Hugo, 
you're right. If someone has sufficient math skills to avoid a dirty
workaround, I'd be pleased to have him work on it ;-).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] new dependency on GEOS C++ library
Message-ID: <20151001094735.GA18309@localhost>

I've found that qgis is now dependent on the C++ GEOS API,
due to the new src/core/geosextra.

It seems to me that the "geosextra" code in its current incarnation
only exposes a function to basically round coordinates to a precision
grid, but in no way changes the precision of operations performed by
further GEOS functions on the resulting geometries.

This is discussed in detail in https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/713

So my question is: if grid-snapping is enough for QGIS use, is adding
a new dependency on GEOS really needed, or isn't there other internal
code for doing coordinates editing work (would seem easy with Qt
standard library?).

As I've been asked to help with getting the code in place for what
I've understood are good new functionalities I'm here to better
understsand the issue, why the new code is needed and how to best have
it available, considering also that latest GEOS release was published
on August 15, 2015.

Hi all,
I just discovered that QGIS allows you to create a tabel with invalid
column names (e.g. "1"). As a consequence, further commands may
obviously fail. IMHO we shouldn't allow invalid names.
Opinions?

Are you referring to PostgreSQL tables ?
IMHO the identifiers should just be quoted:

 strk=# create table test ("1" int);
 CREATE TABLE

Message-ID: <CACC8nO68eF3qEuf0fNcS8nhrWWD7SHfTt5nSWQ1nOESqyeqF+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I need to use OpenlayersPlugin QGIS behind proxy network.
But I need to use defaultproxy settings configuration.

QGIS works fine with this defaultproxy settings
(also connection to wms/etc...
reading plugin list and download it).

But (with the defaultproxy settings) I can not work with OpenlayersPlugin
QGIS
that return:
TypeError: unable to convert a QVariant of type 10 to a QMetaType of type 2

I can instead use this plugin with http proxy and setting manually the
configuration (Settings->Options->Network)

I have tryed to modify OpenlayersPlugin tool_network.py
commenting setHostName/setPort/setUser/setPassword
and using
QNetworkProxy.setApplicationProxy(QNetworkProxy(QNetworkProxy.DefaultProxy))
obvious I do not get TypeError,
but the plugin not work properly (e.g. I do not get OSM layer).

How can I resolve this problem?
There is another plugin that works with default (machine) proxy settings?
(apologies for my english)...

Cheers,
Marica

As resulted from the discussion in the geos ticket: the goal is having 
the operations run in reduced precision, not just merely snap to grid. 
The discussion revealed however that snap to grid is basically what ends 
up being done with the current implementation, due to a 
mis-understanding of mine of the geos internals. As suggested in the 
geos ticket, I'd like to fix this to work as initially intended, and 
keep geosextra in QGIS until a new release of GEOS comes out which 
implements needed changes in the C-API.

We now depend on something that is not even in the latest GEOS and we also
build on platforms/distributions that would be behind even if the latest GEOS
supported this.  So the geosextra stuff and the geos C++ dependency will have
to stay for those.  In OSGeo4W I'll just update the patch in the GEOS package -
as we don't ship the C++ API there anyway - to avoid trouble with the compiler
abi zoo on windows.

I found python code that does writing data in an existing table, but this is

That's fine by me.
I'm wondering if the easiest way to do it would be something like this:

 GEOSGeometry* GEOSGeometry_setFactory( GEOSGeometryFactory* factory, int roundCoordinates );

But note that for such a call, the "factory" parameter would need
to be alive for the whole lifetime of the returned GEOSGeometry
_and_ for any further product from it (operation involving it as an input).

These GeometryFactory links are sticky, that's what makes it hard to
deal with them.

If one sets the reduced precision factories on the geometries, does one 
still need to explicitly reduce those geometries prior to performing the 
analysis operation, or are they reduced implicitly while performing the 
operation?

Operation never pre-reduce inputs.
That's why I added the second parameter.
The only reason to pass "false" would be an optimization in case you
know in advance your geometry is already constrained to the grid
registered in the factory (that'd be case 1 in my mail from
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geos-devel/2015-January/007097.html)

The only way to construct geometries with the GEOS C-API
right now is via WKB or WKT or passing a CoordinateSequence to any
GEOSGeom_create* function. None of them applies any rounding and
attached a singleton-like GeometryFactory to the result. So right
now all geometries out of the C-API contain a reference to the very
same GeometryFactory.

Exposing function like:

 GEOSIntersection_reducedPrecision

Would pose the question of whether or not the coordinates of input
should be reduced. If we do reduce them, then chained operations
would keep rounding the same coordinates again and again, while
by storing the precision info inside each Geometry we are defining
what is already rounded and to which grid.

As known from the beginning, the challenge here is dealing with
management of the many GeometryFactory objects that would result
from the possibility of expressing them freely, and I start thinking
there's no way out of this than adding refcounting to the
GeometryFactory object so that it self-manages.

I'll be trying something to that extent for the time being.

As for QGIS, I guess you could have a function to "reduce" and a
function to "register" a factory. So chained operations would:

 0. reduce
 1. register reduced factory
 2. perform operation 1
 3. perform operation 2
 4. ...
 5. register original factory

In this case the "reduced factory" would just have a short living, and
at the end of the operation chain there would still be a single
factory alive.

openlayers_layer.py file and replace the row 52:
self.setNetworkAccessManager(self.__manager)
with the following:
self.setNetworkAccessManager(QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance())
I just try and it goes but I don't know if it resolvs your issue.

There is no need to have GISBASE variable set (path to directory where
GRASS binaries live) when GRASS GIS is started explicitly as a 'grass'
command later on. If you have GISBASE, grass command will end with error as
GISBASE says that you are already in GRASS session.

Why GISBASE is set, or if deleting it is just a precaution, I have no idea.

Best,
Vaclav

I've stubbed this mechanism here:
https://github.com/libgeos/libgeos/pull/52

Basically, once you don't need an explicit handle on your
GeometryFactory you can call its "autoDestroy()" method and
it will be destroyed once all the geometries referencing it
are also deleted.

Could be a key to what we're trying to do here.

Note that with such feature, there would only need to be a single
new interface in the C-API, namely requesting reduction of the
precision of a geometry and optional scaling of coordinates.
There would be no need at all to expose PrecisionModel or
GeometryFactory to the outside world. Internally, the C-API might
still try to optimize the memory by re-using existing factories
with the same PrecisionModel.

I guess this discussion would be better conducted on geos-dev
though...

Hi J?rgen,

Have you given it some thoughts whether we should have a longer testing 
and bug fixing period before the LT release? E.g. 2.5 months development 
and 1.5 months testing/bug fixing? Or 2 months dev and 2 months 
testing/bug fixing?

Would be good to know early on, esp. for the devs and organizations 
hiring devs.

Thanks,
Andreas

So while the discussion on geos-dev started, I'm thinking that
for GEOS you might prefer to have a solution that also works
with older GEOS version ? Note that doing that by keeping the
dependency on the C++ interface might be a puzzle for packagers
because every version of GEOS is intentionally marked as being
binary incompatible with the previous.

Would it make sense to just do the gridding internally (dropping
the geosc++ dep) for now and postpone the proper precision model
implementation to only be available with the newer GEOS release ?

The idea is to ship a 3.6 version of GEOS capable of the PrecisionModel
control before February.

I suppose I could replace the incomplete precision reduction 
implementation with a hand-rolled snap-to-grid for now and wait for GEOS 
3.6. If there are no objections, I'll move on with this this weekend.

Sounds good to me.
I'd still love to gather your comments on geos-dev list for the
new interface.

Hi,

Since the integration of the new authentication system from Larry I am 
now getting an SSL error on Startup. See 
http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/qgis_startup_ssl_error.png

I have no idea what it means and what I can do in order to get rid of 
this error message.

Does it mean that the connection to https://www.google.com/jsapi is not 
secure? Is QGIS now contacting a Google server at each startup?

Thank you for any hint about this error message.

Andreas

To add some more information: this is on Ubuntu 15.04 64bit.

I also tried starting QGIS without plugins, because I thought that maybe 
a Python Plugin may want to load something from the web, but the error 
message still appears.

Thanks,

Same here. Can it be an opt-in, to be annoying ? :)

Sadly, after further test I discover that the crashes remain, so I think it
is a qgis bug and not a problem in my code.
The problem happens when I put my custom form into a subform widget
(QgsRelationEditorWidget). If I add a new record in the subform and I move
to another record using the left column QGIS crashes. It seems to be a more
general problem because the crash appears also when I add some simple
control that modify the object in the form.

I can open a ticket and add some test data.
If it is a minor bug and it could be resolved easily I really offer a pizza
and a beer to resolve it.

All the best
Luca

The connection to google is made to download their rss javascript
library to display the news feed on the welcome page.

I don't know why the certificate check fails.

I would be in favor of removing this feed again since it has been
declassified to an easy-to-miss second tab anyway and lost its original
planned purpose as push message system.
Another approach if you'd like to keep it would be to ship the js
library with the QGIS application (possible license issues would still
have to be checked).

If the js code is not free software, I'd not want it to be running
in QGIS, even if downloaded dynamically. Besides, downloading it
dinamically poses a big privacy issue; if I'm not mistaken the
QGIS community itself decided NOT to have the clients ping the
qgis website for this specific reason. And we have it ping google
instead ?

Whatever outside communication should be only enabled by the user,
IMHO.

Hi Matthias,

Thanks for shedding some light on this issue. I'd also be in favor of 
removing the news feed, if it requires download from Google. However, it 
would be useful, to have a menu entry in the "Help" menu, to open the 
website of the QGIS blog. The help menu could have several entries for 
useful web resources - and there it clearly is triggered by the user.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Matthias,

I'm in favour of removing Google lib dependencies, especially if they
give certificate errors :-)

But I did like the news-tab though, and was hoping to attract more
people to read (and write!) about QGIS.

We have a 'news item part' in the frontpage of qgis.org, this is just 10
lines of javascript, which just pulls our feed url:

http://qgis.org/feeds/qugsnews.atom

and pulls the title and url from these, see

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blob/master/themes/qgis-theme/languageswitch.html#L121-L185

Though this script is using jquery (which is in the website, but
probably not available in QGIS), I'm pretty sure we can do without and
am happy to hack some javascript code to grab the atom from our own site
and show headlines like on the frontpage....)

This does still not anwer the question though, if it is alright to fetch
data from external websites upon startup...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Since we're at it, could you consider advertising the license of
published javascript code ?

Ok, thanks. I will wait for the next build.

I am not a programmer, therefore I can't figure out which commit fixes
which bug. This message doesn't mean anything to me:

debian packaging update (take II on fixing #13310)

In cases such as these I would suggest adding a note to the commit message
saying such as: Fixes QGIS Master build. That way end users who are not
programmers can check the log and be warned.

Thanks for fixing this so quickly

Cheers

My original plan for the news feed was a push notification system for
conferences, releases...

I do not see any advantage of the current system over having a link
which opens a browser window.

I would like to clearly separate the two discussions: IF there is a good
reason to ship the news feed internally, THEN we will find a solution to
ship a library instead of downloading an external one.

Best,
Matthias

Hi Mathias,

maybe I missed the point, but if the problem is to not download a js lib,
which I suppose is used to download and parse the feed, why don't use a
piece of (python or C++) code into QGIS to download and parse the feed?

The master build itself was fine.  It was just a missing dependency in the
debian packaging - so manually installing python-qt4-sql also helps.

Before we decide *how* to do it, we should decide *if* we do it.

If we decide not to do it the js lib is gone anyway.

If we decided that we do it, we can decide what kind of parser we want.
And I'd strongly vote for using an existing parser.

A real push mechanism?
Or do you mean just pulling a most recent rss or atom feed?

If you meaned the last, I'm in favour to just hack some javascript lines
together and pull our own 'news feed', which also has the releases and
messages from blog.qgis.org.

If we keep it a 'News and Announcements'-tab (note the tab size ;-) ),
we could download the feed ONLY when the user deliberately has a look
into that tab?
In that way people who do not want to download anything, do not download
the feed (but only miss our nice blog posts).
But off course this is not real push...

Or am I missing something here?

Regards,

Richard

So, it seems that nothing has changed so far.
Still the same error when trying to  install strictly following the  
details on qgis.org.

I see no point in trying to tweak sth to get this running. I would rather  
prefer testing with my normal work environment, which is "unfortunately"  
Ubuntu/Mint with ubuntu-unstable dependencies.

Has anyone a clue whats going wrong?

Cheers

I was referring to pull/push in terms of UX. Originally the user had no
other choice than looking at the news feed (push). Now the user has to
click the tab to get information (pull).

Reasoning: Most pages (github/stackoverflow...) and software (mail
clients) give you a notification by means of an icon when there is
something new available in your inbox, in a folder... In short, the
users knows that there are unread items.

At the moment we do not push the information to the user and we do not
give him any hint if there's something of interest to him on the tab.
Why would he still click on it after having found nothing new the last 5
times he clicked the tab? How does he know the frequency of information
update?

If we integrate the reader inside the app we should give the user a hint
by notifying (icon) or "pushing" the information to him (always show the
feed). If we don't, let's not pretend to be smart. Let's avoid the
overhead. Let's just offer a link, it does the same.

It was a bit short-sighted of me to integrate the feed without first
thinking about a use-case (i.e. what kind of information
deserves/requires to be pushed). Sorry for that.

Cheers,
Matthias

Dont' worry, even without pushing I'm happy with a 'QGIS news' tab!

People go to websites too, to just check if there is something new. As
said, by promoting our blog feed I hope people start blogging and we get
more blogs ...
Though not hyper active, there is a news item once every day..

Richard

I agree with Matthias. If we want to get the news to people who are not
already getting it, it needs to be there on the splash screen, not a
secondary tab. Surely there is plenty of space for recent projects and news
alongside one another, with a little redesigning? The recent projects
currently take up a lot of space, and the news stories don't need the
images.

Like every news feed: you can scan the headlines, and either follow
the interested title, or just skip it and go to work :-)

IMHO the news tab with "push-like" behaviour is a good idea (and I thought
it was already decided).

I'm not suggesting to reimplement a feed parser from scratches, just to not
use any CDN loaded js libraries for that.

A feed stream is a simple XML file and many parser implementations are
available in python.

Cheers

Tab version:
Click tab -> scan headlines

Link version:
Click link -> scan headlines

Sorry, I still miss the advantage, two clicks both, same effect both :-)

For me the difference is that I want to view headlines in QGIS, and
only go to a browser if I think one of the news items is interesting.

But... whatever :-(

I'll shortly summarize the tab vs. link comparison:

 + It's in QGIS
 + We get a ping of installations and can do statistics
 +/- The same amount of clicks for the same information
 - More overhead
 - More code to maintain
 - Less space on the recent projects page due to tabs
 - More potential points of failure (e.g. SSL issue)
 - Users computers connect to online services

Did I forget something?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] using Postgis with Z geometry
Message-ID: <560E91E9.7070401@gmail.com>

Hi all,

When I add a Postgis layer with pointZ geometry, when committing a
feature I get:

PostGIS error while adding features: ERROR:  Column has Z dimension but
geometry does not

Is this an expected behavior?

Best wishes,

Denis

Is it possible to handle with this? I need list of geometry to make some
changes in this list.

My next question: for what is intersect returned 3D geometry and it is not
possible to handle with this geometry in next code.

So, for the record.
The current TRUNK branch of GEOS (to become 3.6.0) contains
a new function to change a Geometry's PrecisionModel in a way
that it'll stick to the Geometry and determine precision of
the operations.

It needs to be used with much care to avoid the stickiness
to strike back. The same function can be used to bring the
precision grid back to the grid of floating points.

I hope this is enough to drop the C++ dependency over the weekend :)

Hi, maybe a bit off topic, 
We released rss-menu plugin here as a feed parser to inform users from some
news. 

Huge drawback, it builds a menu in menu bar, and we discovered very few
users do see those news. 

I would be a great fan of having customizable feeds on welcome screen, so
that new have at least one chance of being read. That way, I could configure
some QGIS + some specifics feeds, such as data catalog feed or internal
enterprise wiki feed. 
Does that help in choosing the right screen design?

Cheers

R?gis

"I have found the solution of the issue. I checked ui_DlgResults.py file
from /usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/processing/ui/ and I have found that
QWebView is not imported correctly. In the file was: from QtWebKit.QWebView
import QWebView I have replace with from PyQt4.QtWebKit import QWebView and
recompile the script using py_compiler. The error is gone. In addition there
are other 3 python scripts with the same error: -
ui_DlgGetScriptsAndModels.py - ui_DlgHelpEdition.py - ui_DlgAlgorithmBase.py
I have changed all files and recompile them using py_compiler.

For the second error when I tried to start the Python script the error was
in the file ui_console_compile_apis.py from /usr/share/qgis/python/console/.
I have replaced from Qsci.qsciscintilla import QsciScintilla with from
PyQt4.Qsci import QsciScintilla. Now QGIS works."

?What's the correct SAGA path for a OSGeo4W64 install (relative to the
OSGeo4W64 folder)? On my system, the SAGA path is not configured
automatically in the Processing settings and log says "Problem with SAGA
installation: SAGA was not found or is not correctly installed".

Thanks a lot and best wishes,
Anita?

?Ok, sorry for the noise. I had to install SAGA separately in the OSGeo4W
installer because it seems like it's not automatically picked as a
dependency.

Should I open a (OSGeo4W?) ticket or is this behavior on purpose?

Best wishes,
Anita?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New GRASS plugin: a test drive
Message-ID: <560F6F78.5080806@faunalia.it>

Hi all,

some tests of the new plugin:
* G6 vectors are shown with a red cross, but there is no clear
indication on how to migrate them to G7
* I got a crash twice by right clicking on the browser > New polygon
layer; from the third time no crash, I'll try to replicate it.
* I can reproduce a crash by:
- right click on a G6 vector from the browser
- choose New polygon layer
- got a warning:
Impossibile aprire il file della topologia per il vettoriale
<riserva_2 at PERMANENT>
- bang!
src/providers/grass/qgsgrassprovider.cpp: 338: (~QgsGrassProvider) [0ms]
entered
src/providers/grass/qgsgrassvectormaplayer.cpp: 330: (close) [0ms] close
Segfault
If I do the same from a mapset name, no crash.
* I created a new polygon layer, but it is unclear to me how to add objects
* if I remove a raster which is already loaded in the canvas, I get a
warning (empty, grey dialog) and QGIS is stuck (I had to force close it)
* loaded rasters display a legend, but not the labels.
Otherwise, great stuff!
Should I open tickets for all this?
I'm available for further testing if useful.

All the best.

Hi folks,
though there was an update of Processing to 2.10.2, my GRASS7 still won't  
work in QGIS 2.8.3 (LTR and ubuntu-unstable dependencies repositories)
Returning to Processing 2.9.3 (which now permanently resides as a zip in  
my plugins folder, so I only have to uncompress it and have GRASS running  
again after an update)

Anyone experiencing the same?

Cheers
Bernd

Hi Bernd,

Did editing(processing version 2.10.1) grass7algortihm.py work for you?  I
noticed yesterday that with processing 2.10.2 GRASS7 doesnt work but
reverting to the edited version of 2.10.1 fixed that.

Andrew

Can you state more precisely what you mean with "on welcome screen"?
I.e. directly on the welcome screen or on a separate tab?

No, I didn't try this cause actually I have no clue how to patch this  
without breaking it (sorry just dumb user) and 2.9.3 worked for me.

Thought that waiting a while will cure this magically, but obviously  
things run out of control will all those different versions.
And I also thought that staying with the LTR, I will be on the save side  
... mhm.

I could patch this if I had a patch file (I really do NOT understand  
github)

This is not related to the new authentication system, though I thought that
was the case for a while and spent a bunch of effort trying to fix it. See
issue http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13471 for a script showing it is an issue
with some certificate chain validations and Qt4.

I think the issue started when QgsNetworkAccessManager was added for proxy
support to the Welcome page. Before that the Welcome page's access manager
did not have its sslErrors() signal connected to the QGIS app SSL error
dialog slot. (On Mac, the page didn't even load until the manager was
added.) There were a couple of days it was connected, then the new auth
system was merged and the dialog significantly changed, i.e. it looked like
the auth system merge caused the issue.

In the future, there are workarounds for the https://*google.com cert chain
in network access:

* Save an SSL configuration with 'Do not verify peer certs' set for 'Peer
validation' section (works on all platforms)
* Copy API script to source tree or remote server where calling page resides
* Use http:// instead of https:// to access the Google API script, though
this not a good approach security-wise

Untested whether this is possibly fixed with Qt5.

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-x8BdFZLM0gz0q-=H-tb3ECHsRr5Lq5S9puG5Hw+wigw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The Mac nightly of master branch for 10.7 - 10.10 (maybe 10.11, too) has
been updated and is ready for beta testing the upcoming 2.12 release.

http://qgis.dakotacarto.com/

Note: the Mac OS X 10.6 nightly is still out of commission.

See changelog for what is not yet supported. Requires latest GDAL Complete
framework, as per current stable releases from
http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis

I will be looking into adding an LTR (2.8 branch) nightly as well.

Sorry for the cross-post to both lists.

Message-ID: <CAC_qv=q+=y6CT4=OhGQ9pkDUv12UCknVmx98rLSZUzfLVpN+oQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

(Note: it's the first time I'm trying to compile QGIS using Qt5, so the
problem might be the user here ;) )

Using the current master (what will become 2.12), I fail to successfully
compile a build using Qt5 libraries. The make process crashes when trying
to compile qgsauthcertutils.cpp with the following error:

/home/webmaster/dev/cpp/QGIS/src/core/auth/qgsauthcertutils.cpp: In static
member function ?static QMap<QString, QList<QSslCertificate> >

     QString org( cert.subjectInfo( QSslCertificate::Organization ) );
                                                                    ^

                 from

Question: is it the case that ATM master does not compile using Qt5
anymore? Or is there something I'm missing here?

Thanks for the help.

Math

P.S. the reason why I'm trying to get a functioning Qt5-based build is that
I've ran into a problem with Burmese character encoding that's fixed under
Qt5, due to its use of harfbuzz-ng. So, one additional motivation to to the
upgrade eventually :)

Yes, it looks like the authentication system is incompatible with Qt5.
In particular this API change:

> QSslCertificate::subjectInfo() and QSslCertificate::issuerInfo() now
return a QStringList instead of a QString

> It's pretty common for a certificate to contain more than entry of a

Larry, Matthias, is there an easy fix that can be applied so 2.12 can ship
and be qt5-compatible?

Oh btw, ubuntu now has qt5 packages for scintilla, qwt, and qca but the
cmake process picks the qt4 versions when cmaking with enable_qt5

Can you check this and report back:

Can you confirm the first call to cmake on an empty build directory
already included the ENABLE_QT5 directive?

Ok, let me try the PR.

As for the directive, yes, I'm using an empty build directory with the
following cmake command: cmake -DENABLE_QT5=TRUE -DWITH_BINDINGS=FALSE
-DWITH_INTERNAL_QWTPOLAR=FALSE

I confirm the PR fixes the compilation error (the build is still in the
making, but the auth source files successfully compiled).

Matthias, re QWT, looking into it some more, ubuntu has QWT _6.x_ builds
against Qt5, can I use version 6.x with QGIS?

Message-ID: <20151005090746.4a6bffc0@indien.Speedport_W_724V_Typ_A_05011602_00_001>

Dear QGIS community,

In the last few years we have been steadily improving the amount of funding
we are able to accumulate in the QGIS project. Our goal in obtaining funding
is always to 'make QGIS better'. Up until now we have focussed funding on
high profile aspects of the project: Funding regular hackfests, paying for
bug fixing work prior to releases, funding infrastructure such as servers,
domain name registrations etc. 

With improved funding levels we now have the opportunity to also start
addressing some of the many less obvious components of QGIS that badly need
attention, but often don't attract volunteers. In our PSC meetings it was
agreed that we would start this initiative by funding one or more
experienced users to improve the QGIS manual. Here, briefly, is the vision:

As an experienced QGIS user you currently have two main resources: The QGIS
manual and the QGIS training manual. In this call we focus on the manual,
which is already an excellent resource on available functionality in QGIS.
The challenge is to keep it synchronised with all new features, and examples
and figures often run the risk of being out of date. This is the case
already for several chapters of the manual for the latest QGIS releases and
we want to start optimizing this.

We would love to see the QGIS manual providing a readable narrative
explaining the purpose (with images and illustrations if needed) of each
feature. It can also provide short sample snippet where useful, which in
many cases you can simply cut and paste into your code and then tweak to get
started.

For this funded effort we are thus seeking one or more individuals to lay
the foundation for this work:

* verify and improve the norms and guidelines of the documentation and
  especially its update process together with the PSC.
* update the manual to include all features that are available within the
  latest QGIS release (2.12).
* update figures, if necessary according to the defined guidelines (size,
  desktop-environment, resolution,...).
* populate the manual with further short examples and improved descriptions,
  without competing with the training manual.
* do these in a nice clear and concise writing style, taking inspiration
  from other software manuals, if available.

If you think this is something you are able to do, please contact the QGIS
PSC using this form and let us know!

Geometry Checker or Topology Checker or both merged together?

What do you suggest? My idea was "Build topology" item in context
menu. But we are over feature freeze and if somebody has already G6
vectors, he should know that he must rebuild topology in G7. It is
described here:

I fixed the crash and removed new layer menu items from the vector if
it is not valid.

Draw features? There should be usual Add Point, Add Line etc. tools in
Digitizing Toolbar.

Fixed, it was trying to show a warning from rendering non GUI thread.

Labels were never supported, you can fill feature request issue.

No, except for color labels. For now, if you find more issues, write
it here and I'll try to fix immediately.

Very welcome. There are still issues in editing, that is why I have
not announced yet the upgrade to be finished. The implementation of
editing became incredibly complex. Basic editing should mostly work
however.

I think the context menu is fine, and adding it should not be an issue
now (I could say not being able to readily use my data is a bug, and
your suggestion fixes it).

great, thanks

yes - I tried, but the newly added polygon etc is not displayed once
digitized. Oh, now I see: the custom grass symbology prevents me from
seeing it. Once moved to single symbol, it is displayed.

I can imagine. Where do I find a guide on how to digitize? I tried
adding polygon, then centroid, but I only ended up with an invisible
geom. I'm certainly missing something here.

All the best, and thanks again.

the procedure described in the wiki works smoothly from the embedded
GRASS shell, but I guess this is intimidating for many users.

I confirm an issue: I load a layer, activate editing, the layer is no
longer visible. When editing is deactivated, the layer remains invisible.

All the best.

There is v.build.all in modules.

There was a bug which I introduced on Friday, it was fixed in b09877b.
The style must be set (automatically) to GRASS Edit to get topological
symbology.

It is correct, it should work with current master.

yes, but the user has no hint about its necessity; further steps:
db.connect -d
v.db.reconnect.all -cd
are not available among modules (BTW, maybe these options could be added
to existing modules?).

OK, thanks, I'll check.

I'm not much of a digitizer myself, better leave it to someone more
expert. If no one is available, I can try.

Thanks a lot.

Building broken topology from browser can be always useful, but I
don't think that browser/plugin must have UI for upgrading GRASS data
from 6 to 7, something which has to be rarely done and which should be
done with understanding (upgrade from dbf to sqlite).

Perhaps a special plugin. Do you think it would be a good idea to have
plugins based on the GRASS plugin? (They would probably just call modules
but in the way GRASS plugin does.)

I have added qgis.v.upgrade.py which runs
  v.build.all
  db.connect -d
  v.db.reconnect.all -cd

but v.db.reconnect.all fails with -d even from GRASS shell:

Which revision? Please use current master if possible.

Please start with points and lines. When you digitize a point or line,
nothing is displayed in canvas? Do you see the elements if you switch
style to default? Do you see the features in attribute table? Are the
elements written to the map when you close editing?

 Note that QGIS can only display features of one type in a layer, if
you add point layer and digitize a line, it will no show in point
layer after editing is closed, a new layer with lines must be added to
canvas.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Analysis ergonomy
Message-ID: <5613D3DC.8030706@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
We currently have two major analytical tools:

* GRASS
* Processing.

The first has a toolbar and a panel, the second a dropdown menu and a
panel. The commands in the GRASS toolbar are mostly available in the
Browser and in the panel. I suggest to make the two more uniform, e.g.:

* rename the Processing dropdown menu in Analysis (this seems more in
line with others: Web, Database, etc.)
* add the commands now in the GRASS toolbar under the same menu
(separated by a line)
* remove the GRASS toolbar - I have plenty of toolbars, getting too
difficult to find them.

I think this will result in a more pleasant user experience. Overall,
the impact should be minimal, and this should be very easy to implement.

Opinions?

All the best.

Thanks for the clarification. I'm currently under stress, I do not think
I'll have time for proper testing during this week, but I can give a
hand. It seems to me that testing is especially important in this phase:
anyone available?
Thanks.

	datasource with variables
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6EMO-kBPm7=zsDXat7PDVFPNPHPOTk_1-ae6cEdTnCZw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have just released the plugin Dynamic Layers which let you

* configure a "dynamic datasource" for any layer with variables. You can
use a syntax like {$myvar}
* Configure a table of variable values to use as replacements
* Use a vector layer as a source for this variables ( fields name must
correspond to variable names
* Define a layer as "extent layer" on which to zoom to full extent when
aplying variables

Then you can apply the variables on the configured layers to see the
changes in you project, and save the project if you want.

Use cases :
* You have some PostGIS layers with subqueries such as
table=(SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE country = 'France')

and you have data for the whole world. You can use the plugin to configure
a datasource such as
table=(SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE country = '{$COUNTRY}')

And then set the variable COUNTRY to 'Spain' or wichever country.

You can also change the path to shapefiles, such as
"/my/folder/mydata_{$COUNTRY}.shp"

A video is sometimes better than a description : https://vimeo.com/141541813

Hi,

Probably I did not understand how a new addition to the code is supposed
to work ...

I received commit rights some times ago.

I've been using them very carefully, since I don't want to force
anything and prefer to know the feelings about design / architecture of
other devs before adding something. I consider this to be a good practice.

But it becomes problematic when deadlines should be met, usually because
funders have to know with some confidence in which release a new feature
is going to be included.

And I thought in this case if minor aspects (or even bugs) of a PR is
being discussed as the feature freeze is pronounced, the PR could be
merged provided fixes will be delivered asap (including during the freeze).

#2189 had a bit more bugs than I initially thought (UI parts are not
always easy to test), but I don't think it has major design issues ...
and I am not sure other devs think it has (Nyall ? Martin ?). So I don't
understand why it's stuck.

In this situation it's exactly as if I've been granted useless commit
rights ...

The #2322 is a little bit more of a hack, so I recognize there may be
matter of discussion (J?rgen ? Marco ?)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Oracle provider slow for large datasets - fetches
	all features every time
Message-ID: <CAF7AqmxQeY70m1WY=AbUWgRFjgKw3vqiuxQGXYMAdXOS5XhGcg@mail.gmail.com>

When I open a QGIS project that has a layer using the Oracle provider, the
provider queries for all of the features even though the display area only
contains a few features:

SELECT
"GEOM","LOC_ID","LOC_LABEL","NAME","GRIDREF","LATITUDE","LONGITUDE","COUNTRY_CODE","IN_USE","REGION","PROTOCOL_ID","GEOG_REGION","COASTAL","PRIORITY","EASTING","NORTHING","EXTANT","ONLINE_REGION","BOUNDARY","ZOOMLEV","SITE_TYPE","PRIMARY_INDEX_REG","CONTEXT_INDEX_REG","AREA_INTERTIDAL","AREA_SUBTIDAL","AREA_NONTIDAL","ANCESTOR_LOC_ID","ACTIVE","COMMENTS","GEOM_EDITED_DT"
FROM "BTOWATCH"."LOC_AUX_GEO_WEBS_VW" "featureRequest" WHERE
mod("featureRequest"."GEOM".sdo_gtype,100) IN (3,7) AND (protocol_id =
'WEBSC')

If I zoom in or out on QGIS, or pan the map, again the Oracle provide
queries for all of the features.

This is a problem for me as the layer contains a large number of features
and the database is remote, and thus redrawing the map each time is very
slow.

It looks as though QgsFeatureRequest provides filterRect() /* Get the
rectangle from which features will be taken */, however the Oracle provider
doesn't appear to use this.

Could filterRect() be used in conjunction with Oracle's SDO_FILTER(...)
operation to restrict the set of features requested?

Were you able to work on the hand-rolled snap-to-grid implementation ?
What would happen by just removing the snapping completely for now ?

I wrote the code on Sunday [1] but didn't manage to find the time to 
actually test it yet. Should find a moment tomorrow, at which point I'll 
do the pull request.

Sorry for the delay.

?+1 for having a central Analysis menu.

Concerning the GRASS toolbar, I'd like to hear from people who use it
whether the tools could just as well be in a menu or if it's necessary to
have the more direct access via the toolbar.

Best wishes,

Message-ID: <CAG-h0-82EwcqD_KHUtHFJ8xbhdRmUtW4XacVTN6ywE6hEiDTjw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Devs!

I would like to kindly ask for help in importing any Python module for
reading HDF5 files on 64bit QGIS in Windows (OSGeo4W distribution).
I tried to use *h5py* and *pytables* binaries from [1]. There is no problem
with importing the modules in a Python session run from OSGeo Shell:

Python 2.7.5 (default, May 15 2013, 22:44:16) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)]
on win32

But in the QGIS Python console:

Please, note the errors differences between first and second try of import.
What is the difference between Python session run from the shell and QGIS
console that could cause the problem?

This problem doesn't exist in the QGIS 32-bit.

Thank you very much for any help!

this is the classic example of bad redundancy we would need to remove
in QGIS. Not only we have now the geometry checker and the topology
checker, but there is also a core python tool to check for geometry.
It seems to me that the last two should should eventually be merged in
the first one, considered that they do not offer any tool to fix the
geometries and that they have a few issues (slow, problems with
reprojected layers, false positives, etc.).

Hello

Further development of the C++ plugins is not on our radar at this time 
beyond maintenance and fixing possible outstanding issues. It will also 
be next year until it will use the reduced precision mode of GEOS as was 
originally intended. That said, I'm happy to answer any question about 
the architecture of the plugin if anyone wants to extend it to 
eventually be able to replace the python plugins.

Best
Sandro

Just as additional note, we have two identical entries under the
Vector menu "Geometry Tools".

Hi, 
At first thought, I would prefer directly on welcome screen, at least users
get used to it (or addicted?). Notification icons are usefull for users that
know what's behind. Most corporate users don't really want to read news.. 
My tests today gave me the feeling that we give a lot of space to recent
project, maybe too much compared to average screen display density in QGIS.
That could be squizzed a little bit to let some room to newsfeed. 

BTW I think a little red cross on the corner of the welcome screen should be
there. I couldn't find how to close it without opening an empty or a new
project. When using "layer's menu from projec" to add layer to my empty
session, welcome screen kept on front.. Am I missing something? Should we
wire up a signal in the plugin for that ? If yes, which one?

Cheers

The cause of this is that fTools creates the "Geometry Tools" vector 
menu entry internally, whereas the C++ plugins use the QgisInterface 
method "addPluginToVectorMenu". I suppose the reason for the fTools 
behaviour is that the QgisInterface method does not allow you to specify 
the icon for the menu entry. And I suppose the reason 
QgisInterface::addPluginToVectorMenu does not allow you to specify the 
icon is because this would lead to potential inconsistent behaviour when 
multiple plugins use the same label text but different icons. So I'm not 
sure how to best solve this.

We also should move the first one to the analysis library, so that the
routines are accessible by plugins and processing framework.... Just
another item on the TODO list!

This was how the original implementation worked, but proved to be
unpopular and so was moved off to that tab. For the record, I'm not in
favour of showing the feed on startup - I don't think it looks
professional and even if we wrote like crazy to make sure that there's
always "fresh" news it will still only be relevant to a small % of our
users...

What messages do you get in the message log?

I suppose it's a view and sdo_filter fails on it.  Because sdo_filter requires
a spatial index and qgis probably doesn't find it on that view and tries one
query with sdo_filter that fails and therefore doesn't use it later.  Another
problem might be the SRID.

And without sdo_filter QGIS only resort is to retrieve all and filter them on
the client side.

+1 on this - I also think it's good practice to get feedback/other

My apologies for any delay I've caused in this PR - I've tried to
respond as quickly as possible, but that's not always easy. It
actually took a considerable amount of time to review/test this PR
(and honestly, it didn't help that the initial implementation was
quite buggy and confusing to test ;)

I'd still be in favor of merging this PR for 2.12 (given the extensive
testing given to the latest version), but that's J?rgen's call to
make, not mine. As mentioned in the PR, it still should be looked over
by Martin as I have no experience with the layer tree code and can't
make a call on those changes.

Glad you like it. Also additional plugins could go here.
Radim, opinions? Juergen, I suppose the change, albeit trivial, is not
allowed by the freeze, right?
All the best.

I would suggest to wait until the freeze is over, and also until we
have consensus on this. It takes a minute to change that, but it's a
big change in terms of UI/UX, so better to be sure that we all agree
on this

OK, ticket opened, not to forget:
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13537
In a way, it would be good to change it now, because of the major
revamping of GRASS interface, but I understand well your point.
All the best.

I must say that I like more the concept of rules in Topology Checker
instead of one big dialog used in Geometry Checker. Both from UI and
programming point of view. It is more flexible and extensible. I am
curious why a new plugin was started instead of improvement of the old
one. I don't think that the Topology Checker should be simply removed
until we have something similar in terms of definition and
implementation of rules.

+1, something that I thought and that I could not express.

As I said, I agree this was not perfect the first time in terms of
design. Once fixed, you spent a considerable amount of time on testing
and that certainly helps.
But my point is I am not sure it is optimal, because everything depends
on you.
Once merged in the master, it would have allowed other people (including
the funder) to test it. This is the point of having a "development"
version (master) I think.

Apart from J?rgen's call, as mentioned in the PR before the freeze, why
not merging it and fixing bugs that could eventually occur during the
bug fixing period (i.e. feature freeze) ?

Generally speaking, I think the commit right should allow to push new
things in the master with an "optimistic" view: if someone has to say
something against a commit, he will still have the opportunity to do so.
For this PR this is a pessimistic view: don't merge before extensive
tests and multiple peer agreements. It just does not scale, because
there is not enough available devs.

Normally, you don't need to care about database, GRASS should do
everything for you behind the scenes. By default, the DB is created as
a file inside the mapset, for which you must have write permission by
definition.

To explain the background - the design was done based on specific 
requirements by a customer. The code was written from scratch to 
properly implement the entire logic of fixing errors and tracking the 
effect of fixing one error on other errors. But from a programming point 
of view the implementation is actually very modular and easily 
extensible. The UI is differently organized, it was felt that it allowed 
the user to more quickly set up the "check session". But as far as I'm 
concerned in it's current form I don't see it as deprecating the current 
topology checker.

thanks, my comments also added. so we do not agree fully, and we need
more discussion to have a common view.
I urge all interested parties to participate in the discussion (perhaps
you can invite also donors who participated to crowdfunding?).

I was planning to add Export functionality to Topology Checker during
next HM in Gran Canaria... but now I'm confused where to focus my
work.
If I read well the code, the Topogy Checker have a result data
structure where all geometry of the errors, bbox and more are
maintained.
I didn't test the SourcePole plugin and I don't know if it manage
inter/layer check... well I remeber the presentation in Nodebo, but I
didn't realize this kind of "plugin conflict". So, in this moment, I
remain focusing my work on Topology Checker.

regards,

Luigi Pirelli

Hi all,
a problem with OSX and QGIS 2.10.
I've loaded a shapefile and just tried to save it as a new shapefile,
that's the error:

Esportazione nel file vettoriale fallita.
Errore: non riesco a creare il layer (errore OGR:Failed to open Shapefile
`/ww.shp'.
)

I've not touched the shapefile (attribute table, CRS.. all the same).

Coding is default (System).

Something wrong with some option?

Thanks

Matteo

Hi,
Isn't there somehing wrong with the name of your file (/ww.shp)? Did you
browse and select a folder + name for your file?

Hi Matteo,

>From the path it looks like you are saving directly to the root folder
`/ww.shp` which is likely to be write protected for regular users. Can
you manually enter your home folder or another path `/home/[matteo]/ww.shp`?

Hi Radim,

it works for me with NC sample Location for G6 [1]. So, the same as for
Paolo [2]. How can I reproduce it? I've tried vector map without a table,
but it also worked well. Tested with latest 7.0 release branch code.

J?rgen,

Many thanks for getting back to me so quickly.

In "Log messages" I get:

2015-10-07T14:55:25 1 No spatial index on column
BTOWATCH.LOC_AUX_GEO_WEBS_VW.GEOM found - expect poor performance.

The view column does actually have a spatial index on it - on the
underlying table.

Looking more closely at the SQL, I see that QGIS does attempt a query with
SDO_FILTER:

SELECT "GEOM" FROM "BTOWATCH"."LOC_AUX_GEO_WEBS_VW" WHERE
sdo_filter("GEOM",mdsys.sdo_geometry(2003,8307,NULL,mdsys.sdo_elem_info_array(1,1003,3),mdsys.sdo_ordinate_array(1,1,-1,-1)))='TRUE'

However this fails with error 29902.

I've tried this same query with sqlplus and I get:

ORA-29902: error in executing ODCIIndexStart() routine
ORA-13034: Invalid data in the SDO_ORDINATE_ARRAY in SDO_GEOMETRY object
ORA-06512: at "MDSYS.SDO_INDEX_METHOD_10I", line 416
29902. 00000 -  "error in executing ODCIIndexStart() routine"
*Cause:    The execution of ODCIIndexStart routine caused an error.
*Action:   Examine the error messages produced by the indextype code and
           take appropriate action.

I don't think this is anything to do with not having a spatial index (that
would be "ORA-13226: interface not supported without a spatial index").

I think the problem is with the coordinates given:
mdsys.sdo_ordinate_array(1,1,-1,-1)

If I change these to (-1,-1,1,1) the query works fine:

SELECT "GEOM" FROM "BTOWATCH"."LOC_AUX_GEO"
WHERE
sdo_filter("GEOM",mdsys.sdo_geometry(2003,8307,NULL,mdsys.sdo_elem_info_array(1,1003,3),mdsys.sdo_ordinate_array(-1,-1,1,1)))='TRUE'

*Is it ok to report this as a bug? If so, which Category should it go
under?*


When I access a table directly with QGIS, I can see that it *is* using
SDO_FILTER(...). However I also see that it is doing the following,
presumably to determine the extent:

SELECT SDO_TUNE.EXTENT_OF('BTOWATCH.HOUMA_TEST_GRIDS','BOUNDARY') FROM dual;
SELECT SDO_AGGR_MBR("BOUNDARY") FROM "BTOWATCH"."HOUMA_TEST_GRIDS";

The first query appears to return a perfectly sensible result
(coords: -11.4,48.9  1.9,60.9), and it takes 0.14 seconds.
However the second query takes 6 mins 9 secs !!

Why does QGIS need to do SDO_AGGR_MBR(...)?

Regards,

Steve

Hi, I'm new in the Qgis Development's world, 
What is the best way to develop Qgis in Windows Enviroment (Programs, IDEs., Dependencies) ?
And what do you suggest me, develop in C++ or in Python? 
Where can i get documentation about how to prepare development enviroment in Windows?

It is a good start point.

Dear all,

   I'm writing my first plugin for QGIS, which is basically a wrapper for
some Python libraries I developed some times ago and that are available on
the PyPi repository. How can I include these dependencies in my plugin? How
can I configure the plugin so that it installs the dependencies when the
user download the plugin itself?

Many thanks for your help, best
Guido

At the moment, you have to ship them with your plugin, in the plugin
zip file. If the lib uses native code, you will need to include
binaries for all OSs that you want to support, and the corresponding
mechanism to pick one or the other.

As an example, you can see how it is done in this plugin

https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-geoserver-plugin/blob/master/src/geoserverexplorer/__init__.py

Dependencies are stored in a folder called "ext-libs", which is added
to the python path by the plugin

Notice that that folder is not in the repo, there is a paver task to
fetch the dependencies from PyPi

Notice also that QGIS has its folder with python libs

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/ext-libs

Make sure that the libs you require are not already in there,

Hope this  helps

Dear Victor,

   Many thanks for your help, I'll include my libs in the plugin then.

Ah, fixed in 684346a.

That might be a result of the undetected spatial index.  If so 684346a should
fix that too.

I'm writing a processing routine for which I want to send a query, receive
a table from PostGIS in return, and then do something with the results. Is
there an easy way to do this in Processing?

Hi, to build you can read:

It is a good start point.

Hi, I'm new in the Qgis Development's world,
What is the best way to develop Qgis in Windows Enviroment (Programs, IDEs., Dependencies) ?
And what do you suggest me, develop in C++ or in Python?
Where can i get documentation about how to prepare development enviroment in Windows?

Thanks, Jorge Bellido

I believe that this bug is relevant:

it makes impossible to use certain type of symbol fill in QGIS Server,
but the strange thing is that in QGIS Desktop works perfectly...

Hi Spencer

I have created a script to do so. You must been able to get it via the
Processing Toolbox : Scripts / Tools / Get scripts from online collection

The script is called "Create vector layer from PostGIS table"
You also have one calle "Create vector layer from SQL query" which allows
to create a vector layer from a query

Cheers
Micha?l

Hi again

I have seen there is a bug in the current versions of the script. I need to
adapt them ( Processing has changed a bit since I write them)

If you cannot wait, juste replace the following line in the script

from processing.core.VectorWriter import VectorWriter

by

from processing.tools.vector import VectorWriter


It must do the job

Testing GRASS Plugin with QGIS 2.11.0 Master 3dcabfb:

with Browser Panel I can navigate to GRASS 7 db folder,
GRASS LOCATION is "duplicated" displayed as a regular file system folder
and as GRASS LOCATION with the GRASS icon

I can load vector layers, GRASS raster layers visualization in QGIS
is not working as rasters appears corrupted (weird colors, missing parts, broken in two)

Vector digitizing: QGIS crash when deleting a line and the layer
is not longer loadable in QGIS because of broken topology,

Thanks, Roy.

I wouldn't say it's really "solved", that's just a workaroud, but there are
no trivial solutions to that longstanding issue: QT engine needs an X
server running for some drawing operations.

Unfortunately the solution outlined here
http://www.itopen.it/qgis-server-setup-notes/
is not yet in the manual: any volunteer?

That is correct, the regular directory is left there so that is it
possible to go for example to dbf directory and load dbf files as
standard QGIS layers.

Rasters are corrupted on Windows? That sounds again like if the module
was sending data in text mode, but I am sure the mode is set to
binary.

I am working on test unit for editing, which should ensure that
everything is working, because due to complexity of the code, I was
still introducing new bugs while fixing others.

Thanks for testing.

Hi Giovanni,

To be honest, I just put the infos together, I don't remember where exactly
but originally I've read about the X requirement and fake X in some mail
archives.

So, thanks to the anonymous mail writer :)

Hi, I haven't suggested to remove immediately the topology checker,
but just said that the redundancy with the python geometry checker and
now with the new geometry checker is very puzzling for final users, so
one way or another we should get rid of it (the redundancy).

Moreover the new tool can fix geometries, and this is of course a
must. All the mentioned tools have issues: the topology checker with
reprojected layers and false positives in particular but also the new
geometry checker has a few ones, see for example
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13535

cheers!

Yep - as mentioned in the original PR, the port to the new geometry core 
is pretty fresh and it didn't get as much testing as our previous 
version based on the old geometry core. So any error reports are 
welcome, I'll look at fixing any outstanding issues.

Thanks

That will be the problem with off_t which is different in GRASS
binaries and QGIS (different compilers on Windows), it is discussed
here, but not yet fixed, not easy:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Possible memory leak in QGIS redraws?
Message-ID: <1444315532419-5228794.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
I try to narrow down a production issue here.  
In long sessions with lot's of redraws on complex projects, memory seems to
increase regularly. 

In a more simple environnement with no plugins, just sending multiple
redraws using F5 key triggers it. 
It grows quite fast on 2.6 up to 4Go sometimes, quite slower in master and
2.10. Every 5-6 redraws, QGIS adds 1Mo of RAM in 2.6, less often in recent
versions. 

If confirmed, and if nothing else is to be blamed (windows?, QT?) this is a
serious issue for enterprise uses, especially if we want to build
application that run all day long with many canvas redraws.  

Could anyone try to reproduce this ? 

Redrawing while previous redraw is not over could be at fault? 

Thanks for your help. 
Cheers

IMHO: i find it's confusing, and GRASS 7 default database is SQLite,
i think it could be smoother to expose only GRASS Locations and Mapset
being evident that we're dealing with a GRASS Database, but i can live 
with that :-)

yes on windows, sorry, i forgot to state that clearly;
I mean the raster is *not really corrupted*, it just looks weird.

I also managed to crash QGIS and 'corrupt' GRASS data working on the 
attribute table
trying to delete the "topo_symbol" virtual(?) field; reopening the vector
layer in GRASS the "topo_symbol" column was still there (i know i'm 
heavy-handed while testing!);

Thank you, Radim, for the great work.

You are not the first who is confused. Fix would be easy, so I remove
regular dir if it is recognized as GRASS location?

I have to debug on Windows. Does it happen with all data types (int,
float, double)?

It is a virtual field keeping topology symbol, it is auto added when
editing starts and removed when editing is closed. That is the only
way to get symbology to renderer. User should never try to delete
that. The values are not editable in form, but there is currently no
possibility in QGIS to forbid deletion of individual columns (either
there is delete column capability or not).

*If you ask*, my opinion is that it's better to remove the regular dir;
those folder are in fact the GRASS database.

A solution could be (if possible) to hide the topo_symbol column
in the attribute table;
or to state on the manual that the user should not try to delete
the topo_symbol column.

Hi Radim,
once you're there, could you please see if it is easy to fix also:
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/8220 ?
Thanks.

Brilliant. I wasn't aware that it was so easy to use DB Manager from
Python. Up to now I've been connecting to my PostGIS database using the
postgis_utils
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/qgis/postgis_utils.py>
included with Processing.

So this begs the question: what is the use of postgis_utils if the same
functionality is achieved through DB Manager?

I've been seeing this with large atlas exports too. I can reproduce in 2.8,
in 2.10 it was much worse, but in master it's back to 2.8 levels.

Tried everything I can to track this down with no luck. My suspicion at the
moment is a leak in either qt or geos. I'd be interested to see if geos 3.5
has any effect...

Indeed having the whole folder browseable might be confusing and users are not supposed to move files around in there anyway.
Yet, having the SQLite DB (or dbfs) of a mapset (if existing) available in the browser would be nice. That way also related / non-spatial tables in there could be easily added to QGIS. Probably even better if a context menu entry would allow to add the DB to "DB manager", so one can actually run queries without using db.execute or v.db.update...  But that`s for the future...

Regarding the tools-widget UI, I noticed that the "Close Mapset" butten takes space from the module tabs. The old "Close mapset" button was much smaller. Would it be possible to move that to the bottom of the GRASS module UI, where the Debug buttons are located (if debugging is activated)?
BTW, the tabs for the open modules can get pretty wide due to the icons (see e.g. v.db.join). Maybe better to use module names in the tabs?

Finally, I was wondering if it could be an idea to place all mapset related buttons (open / close / new / change mapset) at the bottom of the Modules dialogue and to add a "manage mapset access" button, which runs the mapset picker for modifying the search path (g.mapsets -s) there as well? One (I if you like) can add g.mapsets with the s-flag as a module (I tested "g.mapsets -s" in the QGIS-GRASS-plugin and it starts the GRASS dialogue successfully), but it is probably better to have this option a bit more prominent (as it might come in handy with the new multiple map input option)?

Anyway, great work you did and do with the plugin upgrade!

Cheers
Stefan

To reproduce:

1. Open mapset;
2. New Point Layer or New Line Layer (I don't get crash with polygon
layers);
3. Digitize some features;
4. Save edits;
5. Open attribute table;
6. New column;
7. Add a name;
8. Ok. I get the crash and seg fault here. Just with point and line layers.



I also found that saving edits with "Save edits" button in the attribute
tabel takes no effect. With other layers (not GRASS layers), it works well.

I'm using QGIS master compiled after this commit
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/e703fc6044e3119c3b59fe9648f7dcf7edc2b714

I'm getting problems with symbology of polygon layers. Please see the
screencast.

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5772257/qgis/grass_edit_polygons.ogv

Note also that attribute form pop-up does not show up after each feature
creation on polygons.

After this, if I remove that polygon layer from QGIS canvas/toc, and add
again from browser, then the symbology is ok (but the cat field is gone):

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5772257/qgis/grass_edit_polygons_2.ogv

I'm using QGIS master compiled after this commit
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/e703fc6044e3119c3b59fe9648f7dcf7edc2b714

Thank you very much Radim!

of course, I just thought you were more efficient. I can try, but I

I have two raster type:

FCELL (float) : the raster loads but visualization is weird and the 
raster is stretched and broken in two

CELL (int): the raster does not load, the circle keeps spinning and i

Hi Spencer,

When I created these script, I think the postgis_utils did not exist yet
(or I just did not know about it). And I thought all the work around
Databases was focused on DBManager to avoid redundacy.

We should ask Victor about it. Perhaps Victor did not want processing to
depend on another plugin ?

Cheers
Michaël

Which 'old' button?  I think that the button is the same since it was
added in 2.11.

> Would it be possible to move that to the bottom of the GRASS module UI, where the Debug buttons are located (if debugging is activated)?

It would occupy one more line, debugging bar is usually hidden. I
could remove the text from the button to make it smaller, but I wanted
to express di difference between closing the widget and closing the
mapset.

It is hard to decide, maybe optional?

'New mapset' is rarely used, and for an existing location it is much
easier to create new mapset from browser. 'Open mapset' is something
which I would like to remove completely, once user get used to opening
mapsets from the browser. It is the last old style open dialog (in <
2.10 it was used also for rasters/vectors).

When I was adding the 'Close button', I considered also other places,
like toolbar or menu above the tabs widget, but I think that an
application should not have preferably more menus/toolbars than the
main application-wide.

> and to add a "manage mapset access" button, which runs the mapset picker for modifying the search path (g.mapsets -s) there as well? One (I if you like) can add g.mapsets with the s-flag as a module (I tested "g.mapsets -s" in the QGIS-GRASS-plugin and it starts the GRASS dialogue successfully), but it is probably better to have this option a bit more prominent (as it might come in handy with the new multiple map input option)?

My approach, since the plugin was introduced, is that we do not add a
GRASS modules since we have a decent, dedicated GUI in QGIS. That is
why I never liked things like nviz in QGIS. This approach was
partially overcome by reality and various hacks (IMO) requested by
users. In this case, I would really oppose to open GRASS GUI from
QGIS.

Maybe you manage to write a wrapper GRASS script for g.mapsets in
Python which fills 'mapset' options with existing mapsets and sets
'answer' to the mapsets in search path?

Bullseye, fixed in d26765f.

BTW, Pedro is supplying me with bug reports off list over a month, thanks Pedro.

It should not take any effect, because with GRASS, the data are
written immediately to file+table. Are you missing the data somewhere
the data are expected to appear after save edit?

Polygons in GRASS are formed by boundaries and identified by centroids
- point like features keeping the attributes. Normally, you digitize
boundaries and then place centroids inside. Boundaries usually do not
have attributes, centroids usually do have attributes. Without placing
a centroid into an area, the area exists (in layer 0), but does not
have attributes and will not appear in currently edited layer (layer 1
in this case).

The tool you used, 'Add Area' is just a shorthand to digitize closed
boundary (boundaries are line strings, not closed rings). Place a
centroid inside and you should see the polygon when editing is closed.
I would like to add also automatic placement of centroid when 'Add
Area' is used, but I don't know how yet, how to squash it to a single
undo operation with the boundary.

Hi all,

I'm trying to compile QGIS as usual, but today I get this error:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Release/tag for 2.10?
Message-ID: <20151009090027.GA9847@aretha>

hi,

I'm in the process of trying to fix bug#13161 (https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13161), and need the source-tree for version 2.10
I have fully checked out latest master, but there is no release marker for 2.10 (like for 2.8,2.6,...)
which revision is the right one?

thank you very much,
Tom

Apparently qgisgrass7 didn't get built - but the information why is somewhere
above.

Hi Jürgen,

no idea why it didn't get built. During the compilation it scan for
all the grass dependencies:

No that was not my intention. I don't mind if it depends on another
core plugin, that is actually good

If I remember right, I reused that lib because it was also part of
core or of some other plugin, and I found the DB manager architecture
to be more complex and not inmediate for being used as a lib. But yes,
I guess all can be done as well with the DB manager classes

I wouldn't be against it if someone wants to modify the algorithms
that use postgis_utils and use DB manager code instead, so we can get
rid of a library and not have redundant code...

Cheers!

Hi Tom, isn't this 2.10?

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/release-2_10

so you should be able to do

git checkout release-2_10

Or am I missing something?

I think the best would be to ensure an automated C/C++ test exists
in QGIS to reproduce the leak, then any memory checker tool would
do find out more. I can help, if the leaks are in GEOS.

Message-ID: <CAHCHdbJRm_eaGdeXSmNdi7bbz7jM+eYRLu_w2hSMGp20JU-o3g@mail.gmail.com>

In an answer yesterday I learned that I can use DB Manager via Python to
work with my PostGIS database.

Within the Processing framework, I need to get a reference to a database
based on an input layer. In the past, I could accomplish this by parsing
the layer's URI. However, it appears that DB Manager refers to databases
using the DB's connection name as given in QGIS. How can I refer to my
database from one of its tables that exists as a layer in QGIS?

Here's an example:

Table name: foo
Database name in PostgreSQL: bar
Connection name in QGIS: baz

I need to get "baz" based on a QGIS layer that points to "foo".

Thanks for any help!

Hi, apparently my previous email did not get properly sent. Trying again
(supporting Richard with his statement)...

Hi,

Development on the 2.10 branch is best done on the release-2_10 branch.

However it is very unlikely that a further 2.10.2 minor release will
happen given the proximity of 2.12 and the longterm release 2.8. So
unless you have strong requirements for rolling your own 2.10 internally
I would recommend to choose either 2.8 or 2.12 instead.

Kind regards,
Matthias

PS:
Release markers are tags final-2_10_1 is the last. These are non-moving
targets.

Hello Developers,

I just wanted to know, if there has been progress since, or rather if
this is (still) intended to be implemented in the first place?

Hi,

DB connection details are stored in QSettings.
For instance
s = QSettings()
s.beginGroup('PostgreSQL/connections')

you can then list connections by s.childGroups()

Does it help ?

Message-ID: <CAB28Asgk93vqHmmae6NkTCAb1Ot-cj5eZiZgA4PmTJnXhKRO0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm currently working on fixing some issues with svg symbol rendering.
I'm wondering what everyone's thoughts regarding
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10908 is?

Situation is:
- default fill color of svg marker symbols is white, outline is black.
- Up until 5 minutes ago, there was a bug regarding outline widths for
svg images. This meant that the width had to be ridiculously large to
be visible (eg 10-20x larger than desired). After fixing this bug the
outline is now visible in the svg image selector, so possibly that's
#10908 fixed.  BUT - now I think the default svg marker width is much
too large (1 mm). I think this should be something more like 0.2 mm.

So I need some feedback. What should be the CORRECT default SVG marker
fill and border color, and border width?

(Personally, I'm leaning toward leaving it as white fill, black
outline, 0.2mm width.)

Nyall,

Thanks for addressing this serious long-standing situation with the svg
markers.

For default colors, I think a black outline with a white fill is the most
effective way to preview svg markers that allow users to set both the fill
and border color. Alternatives (black fill & black border or black fill &
white border would both fail at this)

As for width, I think the default width should be synchronised so that the
svg image preview area width is the same as symbology width by default.
Most svg images have 0.2 as outline so I'd vote for that.

And while we're fixing things in that area we should make sure the svg
images shipped by default all have the same default outline to improve how
the svg image selector looks nicer and more harmonious.

Thanks again.

Argh, forgot one other related question:

At the moment, changing the symbol resets the full and outline color
to match the default fill/outline set in the SVG symbol. I'd like to
change this behaviour so that whatever user-set fill/outline color is
kept when changing the source svg symbol. Any objections?

Hi Nyall,

if it fixes a bug, I would say: take what you think best.

only issue is if it would hurt peoples older projects/styles, would be
nice if there is a solution for that

Regards,

Richard

Mmm.. first I thought good fix, but now I think: what if people have
different colored svg symbols (like different color green tree's)...

If I played with a symbol's symbol (made it orange), and select another
one. Will that then have the last 'play color'? Or will the tree still
be green?

This will only affect SVG symbols which have been edited to allow
setting the color using parameters. So if someone wants hardcoded
colors which never change, they are unlikely to have gone to the extra
effort to allow customisable colors.

But yes, if they had a tree SVG image which they'd modified to allow
customisable colors and had set the default color to green, then that
green colour would be ignored when switching between different svg
source symbols.

Yes, you are right, this trees will not have changeable colors...

Agree with your point then: +1 :-)

Not so sure about that, what if you put on a white tie,
then you see a grey one and when you switch the white
one with the gray, the gray become white?

you mean only during the session - not persistent?

If during the session, then +1 from me - persistent: -1 - so please 
don't write anything back to the original SVG file - or keep this for a 
new session. There is a reason why the symbol author can specify default 
values in the SVG files - and that should be honored.

Apropos stroke/outline: let's not forget that in most cases, symbols 
don't use strokes at all. I would say the default case is that symbols 
don't have a stroke - it is more an exception if a symbol has a stroke.

Hi Nyall,

Thank you for having a look at the SVG symbol issues.

The SVG specification is very clear about what the default stroke and 
fill color is. See http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#FillProperties

The default fill is black and the default stroke is "none" (no stroke).

Let's not invent something new, if the SVG spec is unambiguous.

If someone wants a white fill by default he could set the fill to

fill="param(fill) white"

Where white would be taken as default whereas in the case of

fill="param(fill)" black should be the default according to the SVG spec.

Note that the param() notation is not yet part of the SVG specification 
- there is only a proposal at http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGParamPrimer/ - 
which unfortunately never make it to a recommendation and was never 
implemented by the browsers. The most likely way to get this into 
browsers is through CSS - these days ... It would then not only work in 
SVG, but also in HTML or other web standards.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Victor,

Thanks for your answer.
Using the db_manager tools has an advantage : you can interact with
Spatialie and Oracle too.

I have no time at the moment to have a look at it, but I will write back
here whenever I have some.

We should first make sure which plugin or algorithm uses it, and see if
this can be changed.

Cheers
Michaël

I think you've misinterpreted my proposal - I'm not talking about
modifying SVG files, I'm referring exclusively to these params. So I'm
proposing altering all the svg files that QGIS ships with to ensure
that the fill color, outline color and outline width is customisable
(but only where appropriate - it won't apply to some SVG files).

My latest thought is:
- as above, ensure that fill/outline are customisable
- remove the DEFAULT param values from all the shipped svgs
- modify symbology so that if NO default param value is specified in
the svg, then the existing fill color/outline color/width is preserved
when selecting the symbol. I think this is the best solution, as it
fixes the annoying color/width reseting which currently happens when
switching svg files but without losing the ability to set a default
color within a SVG.

If no objections I'll proceed with this approach.

Hi Nyall,

what about fixing the first bug you were talking about, and do the rest
in a commit after the release. In that way we can try this out a little
more?

I looked at the other non svg markers, and they have actually exact the
same behaviour as you describe above. So that is a plus.

But what is that 'DEFAULT' value you are talking about? Does that mean I
can create a custom (non shipped) symbolset which have fixed colors? OR
have icons which do NOT change color?
What I'm talking about: I've once created a live map based on more or
less 'standard colored' icons http://i.imgur.com/EHQOkPz.png
What happens when I go from the red star to the blue triangle there? Do
they stay the same color? Or CAN I make that they stay there standard
colors, maybe by adding the 'DEFAULT' param in the svg?

Sometimes it is better to 'just do it' and people can test/try with
their own symbolsets. But as said maybe not in the feature freeze period?

Regards, and again: thanks for fixing http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10908 !

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Use PNG in symbols ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO4-cyHtk82S5hNOCub+2mLoh+2AMgJGgGeXiuPyQJd6Qg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Perhaps I am not completely awake (this is the week-end), but I think a
very simple but usefull feature is missing in QGIS : we cannot use PNG
files to style vector layers.

We can use SVG with point marker, polygon fills, etc. and this is good
because SVG provides nice features such as customizable colors,
scalability, etc. But sometime, I just have a nice PNG icon I would like to
use for my point layers, and I cannot do it. (Or perhaps I have not been
awake for years :)  )

The only way at the moment is to use a SVG filled with a PNG image. This is
a bit cumbersome and not very user friendly.

Am I the only one a bit confused about it ? Or have I missed something ?

Cheers
Michaël

You're not missing anything - it's just not implemented yet.

It's on my (long) to-do list ;)

Hi Nyall,

I saw you commit and compiled. Nice! Now I can see the actual icons in
black and white, instead of faint light grey :-)

One point: apparently all sizes with me are in millimeters? Which meant
that my bus stops looked like the right side of this picture:

http://i.imgur.com/wyWnzGU.png

So I thought: that is the 0.2 mm Nyall is talking about. But then
setting the size to 1 pixel(! it was 1 mm), it looked ok, as you see on
the left side of the screenshot.

So my question: should all the sizes in this marker dialog not default
to pixel sizes? Or is it my setup that all is millimeter based?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Actually, it needs to be fixed before release. A lot of the included
SVG images have ridiculously large border widths set, which in some
cases makes the symbol unusable (eg look under the "backgrounds" group
- the 2nd and 3rd symbols have such large border widths that the
actual symbol is obscured). This wasn't noticable before as all
borders where drawn extremely small, due to #11522.

So I need to at least update all the default border widths in these
images to a reasonable value. Given that, it's the perfect time to
also fix the default colors too.

Yes and yes. You could
1. make your own symbols which have the "param" modification and a
default color so that you can change these colors but they have a
preset default (no change from <2.12)
2. make your own symbols without bothering with the "param"
modification so that the symbols always have a fixed color and the
fill/outline color buttons will be disabled (no change from < 2.12 )

If you haven't done the param modification, then the colors won't be
changed from the svg. If you HAVE done the param modification and set
a default value, then that value will still be respected. (no change
from < 2.12)

So the only change from < 2.12 will be if I go an modify all the
provided symbols to remove the default fill color, outline color and
border width. THEN for just these included symbols the fill/border
color/border width will be preserved when changing between the svgs.
Ie, exactly the same behaviour as you see with the simple marker. I'll
also make it so these symbols have a gray fill in the selector list to
keep consistency with the simple marker selector.

Try with current master - a784d6b implemented this change and also
includes the modification required for just two preinstalled symbols
(the first two in the accomodation group). So you can test the new
behaviour with these two symbols and verify that there's no
regressions with your other custom symbols (I'm confident there won't
be).

If this isn't the right approach I'll revert the commit (but I'm
confident it is ;)

Then I'll just need to script something to remove the rest of the
default values from the preinstalled svg files (where appropriate!)
and also add param support to a handful of the preinstalled files
which don't currently have it.

Ok, clear. Thanks for all this explaining Nyall !

No objections from me anymore. Though it would be good if we write down
all this symbolisation knowledge somewhere...

Another question: this 'Simple marker' class in the 'Symbol layer
type'-dropdown. Can't we get rid of those, and make svg versions of
these then, and create a icon group 'simple marker'?
Actually the same with the 'ellipse markers' (we can do that with svg
also isn't it? Though I see 'rotation' is called 'angle' there....

Or are these essential for qgisserver where I understand the svg path's
are sometimes a little tricky?

Richard

Yep, tested and looking and working good for me!

I'm wondering though if the next step also won't be to have this same
behaviour with the border with, anchor point, because for a certain map
you want the same type of (heavy bordered) icons...

So 'open' questions from me:

- what about the simple and ellipse markers, can we maybe do without and
move the shapes to svg?

Should we not fix captions/terms to be the same (looking at lines and
different point dialogs):
- either choose 'rotation' or 'angle' (not using both)
- either choose 'pen' or 'border' ?
- color vs fill vs fill-color

Richard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] current status WFS client
Message-ID: <561A7DA1.2040807@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

can we please have a look into the status of the WFS client currently.
You can close I think 4 issues with one go :-)

I see some have done some work this release, but I think WFS client is
currently borked.

See
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13117
and also
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13293
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13401
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11968


I have the feeling that 'Cache features' and 'Only request features
overlapping the current view extent' are either misinterpreted by
different devs, OR they do not play well together (the options I mean :-) )


The use case is this wfs:
http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/bag/wfs
holding ALL houses in The Netherlands (couple million)
the wfs maximizes the number of feature returned ot ... I think 15000 or
so...


The working (2.8 behaviour) was:
- if UNchecked the 'Cache features' then the client added a bbox (good!)
AND refetched the features after every Pan and Zoom Action (good!)

Now not anymore: only a first set is retrieved, and after that nothing
happens anymore.

To me the two options 'Cache features' and ' only request in current
bbox' more or less mimic there behaviour


Anyway: create a project:

EPSG:28992
xy: 104676.3,490097.6
scale: 1:1000


The possible combinations

-0-

'Cache Feature' UNchecked
'Only request... overlapping' UNchecked

http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/bag/wfs?SERVICE":"WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=bag:pand&SRSNAME=EPSG:28992&BBOX=104403.35250264131173026,490059.08999344159383327,104862.29637185942556243,490342.09838123025838286

BBOX in request! Good, though it is hard to do caching AND retrieving
new features I think...
But it does not retrieve new features anymore after the retrieval of the
first set (like it did in earlier versions)...

-1-

'Cache Feature' CHECKED
'Only request... overlapping' UNchecked

http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/bag/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=bag:pand&SRSNAME=EPSG:28992

OK, no bbox: we just request the first 15000 features (very outside the
current bbox), but hey, that is what we asked for.
Pan action: does not add anything...

-2-

'Cache Feature' UNchecked
'Only request... overlapping' CHECKED

http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/bag/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=bag:pand&SRSNAME=EPSG:28992&BBOX=104556.77736899332376197,490097.08506930683506653,104851.63538065302418545,490278.90968033944955096

OK, adding a bbox to the feature request (apparently because of the
'only request with current bbox'...
BUT panning or zooming OUT does NOT get new features :-(

-3-

'Cache Feature' CHECKED
'Only request... overlapping' CHECKED

http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/bag/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=bag:pand&SRSNAME=EPSG:28992&BBOX=104556.77736899332376197,490097.08506930683506653,104851.63538065302418545,490278.90968033944955096

OK, adding a bbox to the feature request (apparently because of the
'Cache Features'
BUT panning or zooming OUT does NOT get new features :-(


Hope somebody is able to work on this..

Regards,

Richard

ps will add this tests to the issue 13117

You are right, everything is automatically saved. But I think this question
will certainly be raised by users in the future. Maybe it's something to
explicitly place in the documentation.
Or remove the Save button from attribute table of GRASS layers. Or put this
button with the same behavior of Save Edits Layer from Digitizing Toolbar.
In this case, although the data are already saved, the behavior is similar
to saving other data sources (shapefiles, postgis, etc).

Precisely, it works perfectly in this way. But it is not very intuitive.

That would be perfect! I hope you can come up with this solution!
If it is not possible for now, it may be something for future releases.



Thank you very much for your work Radim!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Georeferencing using PyQGIS
Message-ID: <CAPuWFJf-vsXZL9iQ7teopDtmGLFF58uAd4e7YwhQtW2=6V+y_A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to georeference a raster using PyQGIS.  If I want to
georeference a raster manually (loaded from an ascii file), I can use the
Georeferencer plugin, but I don't see a way to access this core C++ plugin
using PyQGIS.

When I tried using GDAL to georeference a raster, using the script created
by selecting "Generate GDAL Script" in the Georeferencer, the raster was
incorrectly georeferenced when I loaded it in QGIS. It looks like there may
be differences between how GDAL and QGIS handle the georeferencing offsets.

Do you have any advice for georeferencing a raster using PyQGIS, using the
Georeferencer or otherwise?  I'm using QGIS 2.4.

Thanks!

Chris

You can't access the georeferencer from pyQGIS as it is a plugin
itself. You can find the plugin code at [1]. I would like to see it
all tidied up and exposed as public api, especially seeing as the
Helmert 2-point transform is not available in GDAL but is only
implemented in QGIS itself.

I did write my own georeferencer for our specialised purposes [2]
seeing as the QGIS gui is rather poor (45 clicks to 3-point georef
versus 5 in mine). There are Python bindings to gdal that you could
use instead [3], but I found it just easier to call the binaries
directly.

Ok, I've pushed the changes to the preinstalled svg files and closed
off #10908 (yay!). Note that unfortunately there's some symbols I
haven't been able to update as they had non-white fill or non-black
outline defaults. I can't standardise these symbols without
potentially breaking their use in other parts of QGIS, eg as a
composer image. After 2.12 I'll try and make the change so that
fill/outline color for SVGs can be set for composer picture items, and
that should then allow me to update these remaining symbols.

I don't think SVG and the other markers should be combined. Ellipse
and simple markers, maybe, since there's lots of overlap there. But I
think SVG markers are a different beast and especially when we add
support for raster image markers it's good to be able to have SVG
markers as their own seperate option.

Definitely - I hate this kind of inconsistency. I'll do this.

Hi Matteo,

that was a small lack due to some changes in the translation strings.
Just fixed in master.

Sure, I'll start the documentation with warning about this. The
documentation is on my TODO but I still prefer fixing bugs over doc.

The 'Save Layer Edits' is now hidden from 'Digitizing Toolbar' but
'Save Edits' in attribute table is not currently accessible from
plugins.

The user must have some minimum knowledge about GRASS topological
model. Note that 'Add Area' makes only sense for isolated areas,
common boundaries of adjacent areas must be digitized by 'Add
Boundary' because the boundary is shared by areas on both sides.

The lib qgisgrass7 is part of src/providers/grass, so please go to
that dir and try to rebuild that and then check if you have
output/lib/qgis/plugins/libqgisgrass7.so.

Hi Radim,
well in the src/providers/grass folder I have the following directories:

7 CMakeFiles

and actually in output/lib/qgis/plugins/ there is not any
libqgisgrass7.so file

I try to create another build directory in the repo and compile again
from scratch but I receive the same error..

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Errors with some Processing algorithm
Message-ID: <561B8853.9060205@gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm doing some test with Processing and I'm facing some problem with
some algorithm:

* Create grid (QGIS).. each time I try to create a grid I receive this
error:
Grid instance has no attribute 'TYPES' See log for more details

while using the same algorithm from the Vector menu of QGIS no problem


* Zonal statistics: input raster (DEM) and a polygon vector (I'm sure
the CRS are the same). This is the error:

in method 'SpatialReference_ImportFromProj4', argument 2 of type 'char
*' See log for more details

same thing of above: the algorithm works if called from the QGIS menu.


I'll continue testing..

Thanks

Matteo

If you run 'make' in src/providers/grass/7 it compiles without error?
It should either build target qgisgrass7 (libqgisgrass7.so) or give an
error.

I think that the QGIS "Add Area" should be renamed to "Add closed boundary"
(or something like that) because GRASS has the "Add Area" tool that in fact
allow you to add boundary and centroid in one go;

another issue I discovered while testing QGIS digitizer with GRASS vectors
is that there is no difference between node and vertex, in GRASS they have
two different "topological meaning"; as it is now you can't tell
where to connect with a new boundary because of this.

Thanks, Roy.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Release schedule discussion - again
Message-ID: <561B9DB7.3070205@carto.net>

Hi all,

I know - this discussion came up repeatedly in the past - but here I am, 
bringing it up again. Jürgen - please don't shoot me ;-)

As a QGIS user in government (you could also replace this by a company 
or other professional users) I find the 4 month release schedule not 
ideal - and quite stressful. I would rather prefer a half-year or yearly 
release and then proper bug-fix releases. I also find the one month 
window for testing/bug fixing too short.

I think QGIS arrived at a stage where we have a lot of features, but we 
still fight with quality. Every 4-month release has different bugs and 
the first LTS version was not much different (quality wise). After 2-3 
bug-fix releases it now arrived at a stage where the quality is quite 
ok. But unfortunately this can't be said for the 4-month releases that 
may or may not receive updates.

So should we really keep this fast release cycle with releases every 4 
months with the risk that these in between releases are barely usable 
for professional users or should we rather have one release every 6 to 
12 months and invest more (financial) resources into these fewer 
releases? I would personally vote for fewer releases and increased QA 
resources. Maybe change to a release every 6 months with four months of 
development and 2 months of bug fixing/testing - and see how this works?

I'm not confortable with unicode object and binaries binding like osgeo._osr

thanks Matteo for the report. This brings once more the issue of having
a test suite for Processing: I think we cannot afford to ship broken
modules, and it's unrealistic to test a sizable proportion of them by
hand. Sorry for insisting, but I think it's very important and urgent.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I thought that Matthias and Victor are already looking into the 
Processing test suite and will submit a proposal to the QGIS.ORG board - 
right?

So it is a matter of time and funding. We can provide basic funding from 
QGIS.ORG - but more additional funding from third parties will mean more 
tests ;-)

​Could you clarify why this issue is not addressed by the current LTR
approach? Just sticking to the LTR ​

​versions (maybe not 2.8.0/2.14.0 but instead 2.8.1/2.14.1) shouldn't be
stressful.

Yes, that's the reason I'm spreading this out to the MLs - possibly a
clever power user will consider investing in it :)

Hi Anita,

I know that I don't need to update every release.

By stressful - I don't only mean myself as a governmental user - but us 
all (the people involved with the QGIS project). For you as well. Why do 
we have to release so often? Aside from web browsers - I don't know a 
single open source project that releases so often.

In reality, there wasn't a single release that did not need a patch 
release shortly after.

By concentrating on fewer releases we could invest more resources in 
quality assurance, testing, etc.

Who really needs a release every four months?

We also put stress on our users - if they don't upgrade every release - 
they risk that their project doesn't load properly anymore. There are 
many cases where the user tried to upgrade - say from 2.2 to 2.8 and ran 
into troubles because he skipped 2.4 and 2.6.

I think the time based releases are a very good idea - but to release 
every four months is too often.

Message-ID: <CAECJsSp3EJ-3Ler34k_9vnj5qLUyFrMrOZ7VN9mM_CngCLN+yg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'd like to know what are the differences between those two options
available while customizing a legend in a print composer. Except that
"auto-update" does work silently, they both do AFAICS same things :
- update list of layers according to what exists in the map canvas or map
item content
- delete any user-defined label
- delete any user-defined visibility options (hidden, group or sub-group )
- reorder layers according to main map canvas

Hitting "update all" behaves like checking "auto-update". Have I missed
something ? Is it worth keeping both ?

Yes, one is automatic (e.g. for servers), the other update is triggered (or not) by user choice.

Looks like if it was not configured WITH_GRASS7 at all.

This is what I'm saying.
Then, what are the benefits of having "update all" button since it does
same thing than the automatic? Why just not keep the "auto-update" option?
User checks and unchecks "auto-update" and it's okay, his items are up to
date/reset actually (though I agree checkbox is not the optimal tool for
that)
In previous releases (till 2.4 I think), there was another option "Update
item" that keeps user customization and can explain why there was an
"Update all" option that resets all modifications. Now, both options do
reset.

Thanks Andreas to raise the issue again. 

I feel stressed too with that release cycle as a public enterprise manager. 

Why ?

 - We try to push new features and fund them. It requires to test them when
they land in master and  restest them in all versions for regressions in
LTR. 

 - We have a delay between production deployment and LTR, depending on other
schedules than mine. so I currently have to support 2.6.1 in production,
test master during feature freeze, restest in 2.8, 2.10, in case I have to
switch back to LTR for next deployment.

 - If I keep to LTR, QGIS will loose early tester.. that's already the case. 
I can't follow three feature freeze periods in a year. Not sure not testing
only LTR versions helps QGIS project, since QGIS looses enterprise heavy use
cases here. The feature freeze and early patched version appears all the
time as Andreas said.

 - It is more pertinent and effective to test when developers are on the
work.. Six month later, tickets are kept in a pile. more overhead for
everyone.

 - tickets are closed even before good testing, I need to reopen some often.
Risk of releasing a non tested patch.

 - Big features are introduced without QEP's written. Sorry for saying that,
I launch a funding for labeling rewrite and I see an API rewrite land in
Master, no blog, no doc, no QEP. The work is very good, but I can't rely on
such a roadmap with contracts relying on a blackbox project. This ends up in
more costs, because there is risk. We already have high costs with review,
quality, community work overhead.  

This ends to more overhead, which leads to fewer time to test. Unless... I
could hire someone. And this is impossible here. 

 More than all this, QGIS project is not able to review all the pending
PR's. I funded two features that won't make it in 2.12 because there wasn't
enought time for this. Postponing to 2.14 means rewriting a lot of code
because it won't be mergeable easily.  So.. I gain a lot of administrative
work on my side, and funded developpers gain a lot of risks on this. 

This is costy because we have to switch between to much versions at a time
and get lost in it. I also feel developpers being a bit too much "on the
edge" by now.

In my feeling, the 4 months release is more damageable than a 6 month
because of that "urge" feeling.

Please don't say user enterprise can jump over non LTR version, you know we
finance a lot, and if we don't stick to current project, we all loose
something. 

I think we must slow down, accept to postpone some new features, which is
hard to do and explain to funders. We need to all use QEP's, and that take
time to explain what is being done. 


I would love to be able to talk of all this with you in any developper
meeting, but budgets cuts just don't allow me to move from here.

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_FvJ7sJ70UDE3C_9kDTpPxBTn1zo90E0i3x3byBkLz7Yw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm having Crash Dumps in current master, on windows 7 64 bits. After a few
tests and some .qgis2 cleaning I realized it has something to do with
expression functions created by user.

The attached file makes qgis crash dump, if you try to open the expressions
dialog.

It works in QGIS 2.8.3 tho.

Did not test on Linux.

Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

OK, if I don't manage to add centroid placement.

I think that the cleanest way to get nodes displayed will be to add
first/last vertex marker line symbol in boundaries style, which you
can try immediately if you change 'GRASS Edit' style.

Hi Andreas,

As if that would help - there are far too many people out there ;)  I just
wonder why this needs to be discussed again shortly before a release.

And I don't actually see any new points - this has been discussed before and I
never saw any striking arguments that would really make it clear that four
months is too short, while six months would be all that different.

That the initial LTR release wasn't any different from the other releases
stability-wise is correct.  But should it?  We maintain it for a year - and
that's the difference.

That bugs pop up shortly after the release is probably unavoidable unless it
gets intensive testing.   Otherwise the people testing (although they probably
just want to use) a new release will easily outnumber the people testing and
fixing it before the release and hence might find serious things right after
the release - or even before we have all the packages ready.

I guess that's why we always had point releases right after the .0 releases and
I don't think that will change with a switch to a six month schedule.

For those there is the LTR.  That's who we make it for.  If not even those are
using it, why do we make it at all?   

You might say that you can't wait twelve month for new features you fund.
Right, and that's why the release schedule is as short as it is.  It's to make
new features available in a release relatively quickly.   But if it's four or
six month isn't a big difference there either.

If we released every 6 months, how long would we maintain the LTR?  Still a
year and every second release is a LTR?  Or still every third release?

I don't really care that much if we release on a four or six month schedule
(ubuntu does six monthly releases too).

"After changing the symbology in the QGIS main window you can click on [Update] to adapt the changes in the legend element of the print composer"

I think that now changes in the legend element of print composer is automatic when you change, say, layer name color,
and that was the purpose of "update item"

Nice idea, just tried, unfortunately QGIS crashes (on Windows) if i try 
to change line
boundary to "Marker line";

BTW is it possible to install different versions of QGIS (e.g QGIS-LTR 
and MASTER)
on Ubuntu without compiling it?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Release schedule discussion - again

References: <561B9DB7.3070205@carto.net> <20151012154936.GA19074@norbit.de>

Hi Jürgen,

I don't claim that a six months release schedule solves all our issues. 
I know it is not too different.

But every release is a lot of work - for packagers, translators, 
testers, documenters - also for people like Anita and me who help 
evangelizing/promoting QGIS. In the past I tried to promote/advertise 
QGIS for every release - now it became insane - it would be a full-time job!

There was probably a reason to release very often in the early days of 
QGIS - when a lot of features were still missing - but there is not so 
much pressure anymore these days.

I also have the impression that our testing/bug fixing period is too 
short. If I am on holidays for 1-2 weeks during this time, I almost 
missed my opportunity to properly test the release. It would be much 
easier if it would be a 2-month period for testing/bug fixing.

And there is another thing: I usually tell the Swiss QGIS users to test 
a new release - if this happens too often - they don't take you 
seriously anymore - What? There was just a release a couple of weeks ago 
- and now I should already test again? The reality is that many users 
out there work with old releases because they can't upgrade that often - 
due to whatever reasons in their organizations.

Like Régis - even if my users may only work with the LTR version - I 
personally want to stay up-to-date/current with the in between releases 
- test stuff early on. For me, personally, even the nightly is good 
enough for the testing purpose. No need to do a full release for testing 
stuff. But if it happens that feature X only works in version A, and 
then stops working in the next release due to a bug, and then yet 
another feature only worked in the version 2 versions ago - it really 
becomes a burden and nightmare to maintain QGIS in an organization.

If we continue cranking out releases at this very fast pace - we also 
risk a very strong disconnect between the actual professional users out 
there (who may be 2-4 releases behind) and the nerds who can afford to 
stay always at the cutting edge.

And: we could better concentrate our quality assurance efforts and 
finances (employ more devs and/or let them work longer/more concentrated 
on bug fixing) if we don't release too often.

With 'GRASS Edit' style only? When exactly? When you click Apply on style tab?

QGIS crashes when you select "Marker line" in symbol layer type right away,
not only with 'GRASS Edit' style also with default style on a shapefile; so
i think it's not related to GRASS plugin...

But if it happens that feature X only works in version A, and then stops working in the next release due to a bug, and then yet another feature only worked in the version 2 versions ago - it really becomes a burden and nightmare to maintain QGIS in an organization.

Andreas how would you see the LTR releases working in relation to a slower release cycle? I have thought at times that we should make the LTR’s longer lived e.g. 2 years (1 year is not really that ‘long term’).

FWIW, I also find 1 year to be short term :)

I agree, 2 years support for the LTR releases seems more useful. But 
this would then mean, that if we have an LTR release every year, that 
we'd need to maintain 2 LTR versions in parallel.

Or we'll try the Ubuntu release cycle ... every 2nd year there will be a 
release with long-term support and then maintained for 4-5 years (seems 
a bit long to me). The Ubuntu release cycle works really well for my 
Linux servers - I have to say. I use only the LT Ubuntu releases and 
have a good mixture of being relatively up-to-date while only having to 
do major upgrades every second year.

Andreas

Really? This thread is full of frustrations like:

* now it became insane
* barely usable for professional users
* risk a very strong disconnect between the actual professional users
* risk that their project doesn't load properly anymore
* stressful
* big features are introduced without QEP's written
* more overhead, which leads to fewer time to test
* not able to review all the pending PR's

from *exactly the people* who work hard to introduce and support QGIS
within enterprise, government and educational institutions, which now
includes myself.

How are these not compelling arguments?

At Boundless we are seeing both sides of the issue: users who want only the
LTR and users who deploy the LTR but always work with or test the latest
version between deployments of the LTR. The latter group is finding the
current pace quite difficult to keep up with. I'm talking about very large
government agencies rolling out to 100s upon 100s of thousands of users.
They rely upon the advice of their power users who are working with
whatever is the current version (not just the LTR).

In other words, it is not a "one or the other" type deployment situation
for many enterprise rollouts. The LTR *compliments* the normal releases,
which are now too frequent and unstable.

Ideally, something needs to slow down and more effort focused on testing to
address these issues. After all, such large deployments are often where
funding comes from to add features or fix bugs (or keep some of us employed
:^).

OK, then... I think the idea of 6 months between releases (with 4 for dev
and 2 for testing, and an LTR release once per year) sounds like a very,
very good solution to try.

My thoughts (note that I'm not in a position where I have to maintain
an enterprise-wide rollout, so my viewpoint may be skewed):

- If you're using QGIS in a professional setting, you SHOULD be using
2.8 ONLY. I wouldn't recommend non-LTR releases as suitable in any way
for professional use. Treat the non LTR releases as betas or for hobby
use only.
- I also think LTR releases should be every 2 years rather than every
year. I also think that having a new release tagged as the new LTR
release shouldn't be immediate or automatic. Eg, let's say 2.22 (or
whatever) is the next scheduled LTR release. I don't think the LTR
should switch immediately when 2.22.0 is released. Instead we should
let the release settle and manually decide when it's suitable to move
the LTR from 2.8.x to 2.22.x. Maybe this will be a few weeks after
2.22.0, or maybe when 2.22.3 is released. In the meantime it's just a
LTR candidate, and not the recommended release for corporate use.

That said, I think the much more important issue which needs to be
settled ASAP is timing of QGIS 3.0 and the move to Qt5. Honestly, we
are extremely lucky that QGIS isn't totally broken on the latest OSX
release. Qt4 can't build on it, but the homebrew crew have managed to
patch out the broken sections and at least get Qt4 compiling on 10.11.
Who knows what kinds of broken behaviour and regressions are waiting
to be uncovered though... I'm VERY concerned that a future OSX release
(or windows update, or distro decision,...) will totally break Qt4 on
one of our platforms and we'll be forced to rush release a Qt5
version. This would be a huge shame - for QGIS 3.0 to be done properly
and be a nice stable base for the next couple of years we need a
double-cycle to clean up all the deprecated code and API hacks which
have built up over the 2.0 cycle.

We need to be in control of this decision and not have it forced upon
us, and it needs to be made soon...

Ahh... if only we had someone who could check every commit with
hundreds of tests immediately after it's committed. And that person
should be unpaid and work 24 hours a day. Also they should check every
PR before it gets merged. Oh wait, we've already got someone, and his
name is Travis ;)

(sarcasm aside) I realise that we need a combination of real life user
testing alongside the CI unit testing, so your point is still very
valid. But that said, my honest thoughts are that the BEST way to
ensure stable, regression-free releases is to extend the test suite.
We're on the right track, and the test suite has exploded since
Matthias' great work implementing the Travis testing, but we've still
got room to improve.

My plea to sponsors:

If you're funding QGIS development work and the contract doesn't
mention something like "we will totally soak this work in unit tests"
then rip up the contract and run. (Or ask them nicely to revise the
contract to include this ;) ) If you're funding work and it's not
being accompanied by unit tests then you aren't getting what you paid
for, and you'll be forever forced to test your funded features in
every new release manually for regressions...

Just to clarify - I don't mean that we (as a project) should treat
these releases as a beta, just that corporate end users should...

As I said before, it's +1 from me to slow down
(http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Is-the-new-release-schedule-a-success-td5213659.html).

If the devs need more end users to test, then changing to a release every
six months, LTR every two years, would help. However, how would the devs
feel about patching LTRs for twice the duration they do now, and for one
extra non-LTR in between each? To me it sounds like significantly more work
to keep backporting for two years instead of one. 

I don't think the Ubuntu comparison holds (in ignorance) because I presume
they have many, many more end users who test.

I go back to my own experience. I'm part of a partnership of 15
organizations, several of whom have switched to QGIS, with more on the way.
I believe that what holds organizations like ours back from migrating is a
perceived lack of robustness - as witnessed by the 2.8 and 2.10 immediate
patches - and lack of documentation, for which I know there is an ongoing
effort to improve. 

Another angle: we commissioned a QGIS plugin we needed before we could
migrate to QGIS. It would cost us less if we only had to get that updated
every two years to be compatible with an LTR, rather than every year.

the current LTR has been an experiment, and IMHO it has been a success.
Do we really want to change schedule every 6 months?
We know for sure there are contrasting needs, and we'll never make
everyone happy. Some times ago, we had people complaining not being able
to use for many months the supercool feature they have developed or paid
for.
I think it's mostly a matter of communicating appropriately:
* for maximum reliability, use the LTR
* if you need latest features, go for the latest published.
Maybe we should state this clearly on the download page.
On the other hand, I am with Nyall on the Qt5 (and I should add Python
3) issue.

More below.

This touches a *very* imprtant point: large organisations should have
very clear that if they need a more stable release cycle, the best and
most clever thing they should do is to fund:
* more automated tests
* more backfixing
* more and earlier backporting.
I cannot believe someone using any software in such huge numbers not
having a few hundreds thousands bucks to properly support these needs.

All the best.

Hi,
no, i did not solved it.

However, it does not effected my plugin[1].

The main problem that i had was with QgsPluginLayer. All created
layers needed to be managed in addition to the QgsMapLayerRegistry,
since the Python garbage collector seems to delete layers, even if
they are referenced by the registry.

Best regards
Soeren

Hi all,

Thanks all for joining the discussion.

My main concern, is about quality, not so much about the exact number of 
months between the releases - and I have the impression that given the 
current situation (not enough test coverage, large parts of the codebase 
untested, still large chunk of code go into master without 
QGEP/discussion/cross review) - that we cannot deliver good quality with 
such a rapid pace.

The only other software I know that has such a rapid pace of releases 
are web browsers (Google Chrome and Firefox) - but these projects have 
rather small incremental changes in between their releases and very 
rigid requirements for new additions to the code base, and large and 
comprehensive test suites. In addition they have automatic updates and 
much more financial resources than we have.

We can't build on the above things (at least not yet). In our current 
situation we have to rely more on manual user testing - and for that the 
one month testing/bug fixing phase is too short. And again - for someone 
who wants to test all of the releases - the releases happen too often. 
What's the point of releases where people don't have the time and 
resources to test them in depth - and the time to properly react on 
findings?

-------------------------------

The other thing is our long list of open bugs. I also regard many of the 
"normal" bugs as severe or at least very annoying.

For me we should take the time to have a break in feature development 
and invest more in quality - and having a slightly slower release 
schedule gives us at least a chance to do more in this respect.

We have some very good initiatives in this respect: the LTR release, the 
paid bug fixing, more donations, more tests provided, processing test 
suite will start soon, investment in documentation, etc. I am just 
asking for a slower pace to do these things properly.

Andreas

Hi all,

Now each LTR release is not that different from regular releases. Those
LTR releases don't get that much more testing than other releases and
the .0 releases are potentially as fragile as regular releases.
It is mostly the new features that cases bugs and crashes. What if we
don't introduce any new features in LTR releases?
This is just a thought and I don't know if it would work in practice.

Let me explain better what I mean with this.
Basically the last point release would come the next LTR-release. We could
still have three releases per year. If I use ubuntu release
notation those are 15.02, 15.06 and 15.09. The next LTR would be
released in February of 2016 and that would be based on 15.09.2
for example. Lets name that release just LTR 16.
With this release process each new feature in LTR would have gone
through a three months testing during the usage period of 15.09 besides
the 15.09 feature freeze testing.
At the same time a regular 16.02 release could be released with all new
fancy features. Actually this would make four releases per year + point
releases.

Is this kind of process proposed before?
Like I said before I don't know how would this work in practice because I
can't imagine all different bug fixing, back porting or packaging
situations.



Regards,

Lauri

Hi Andreas,
I agree with you, I think you touched very important points for our
future. We discussed about this in the past, but now IMHO we are in a
much better position, because we can think of QGIS as essentially
feature complete (OK, we are never complete, but most people can do
almost all they need even with the "oldish" LTR).
So slowing down the pace of new features, and shifting the attention to
more quality, is now more feasible than ever.
This could be done being more rigid about acceptance of new features, e.g.:
* always request a QEP with a proper discussion before merging (open
questions: possibly also a vote? a consensus? by the community or by the
PSC?)
* only accept code with proper test coverage, and leave it pending until
it has it.
However, ultimately the issue is about resources: we should be able to
communicate our [enterprise|large|power] users that investing in code
quality is good for them. IMHO, with a couple of developers paid full
time for this, things will improve dramatically; without that, we'll
struggle. And all this regardless of the frequency of releases.

All the best.

Huh?  That's what we do.   And the LTR package repositories are fed with the
new LTR release only after it has been regular release for four month.  So you
would probably never see a .0 there.

Hi all,

So there seems to be a general agreement to invest more into quality/bug 
fixing/testing - but not so much about the release frequency.

-----------------------------------

I'd like to mention some more reasons for fewer releases:

* the plugins: plugin authors are more likely to test and fix their 
plugin for a new release if it isn't released every 4 months. We often 
have the case that if a user updates to a new version, that their 
favourite plugin that they need may be broken  and they'll have to wait 
several weeks until the author can fix it
* same applies for inhouse plugins that organizations maintain for 
themselves
* training material, documentation and books - have a hard time keeping 
up. If you are lucky, you'll get a book that covers 2.6 or 2.8.
* the general perception for QGIS users that they are always many 
versions behind - don't you think it is kind of frustrating for our 
users to be always several releases behind - because they need to rely 
on older versions? I remember many email threads where users have 
described a problem and we tell them that is fixed in master - what does 
it help them, if they are on the older version and supposed to use the 
LTR release in a production environment?
* testing: as I said - I believe you will get more/better testing if we 
slow down

Thanks,
Andreas

Dear all, imagine yourself being a new QGIS user. Go on the qgis-website and you see immediately the download option for version 2.10. Click on "documentation" and you realise it refers to 2.8. This situation was even worse in the past (I think 2.8 versus 2.2). The first impression you get, is that the software is not properly documented and this is definitely not a good argument especially for newbies (who we should convince of using qgis).  There is already a lack on people contributing to the documentation, but the short release cycle makes it even more difficult to have up-to-date software help. 
As several others have also mentioned, QGIS has very good functionality now and a slow-down would help to make the software more stable and to improve issues like documentation. Such a stable and well documented version could be promoted on the main page of qgis, while rather unstable versions with more functionality should be rather "hidden" for those who would like to test.

Hi Radim,
don't know if you have made some changes, but I recompiled from

I hope I can make some test of the plugin.. :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SVG Icons from US national park service
Message-ID: <561CCF30.5000002@carto.net>

Hi,

I have recently met Tom Patterson - a fellow cartographer who works at 
the national park service in Washington. I knew him for some years - but 
only recently re-met him again in Pittsburgh.

He gave a nice presentation at the Graphical Web 2015 conference in 
Pittsburgh (nice presentation to look at by the way: 
http://www.graphicalweb.org/2015/abstracts/37-Designing_National_Park_Service_Visitor_Maps/NPS_Maps.pdf 
- and a good inspiration for cartographers).

He also pointed me towards high-quality public domain icons from the 
national park service, available from 
http://www.nps.gov/hfc/carto/map-symbols.cfm

See
http://www.nps.gov/hfc/carto/symbols/map_symbols.pdf
and
http://www.nps.gov/hfc/carto/symbols/other_symbols.pdf

in particular.

Since they are public domain - and high quality - we are welcome to 
integrate many of these symbols with our QGIS distribution.

If you agree - I may volunteer to convert them from PDF/Adobe 
Illustrator to SVG - making sure they also have replaceable fill/stroke 
colors.

Andreas

I'd welcome these additions. Please check http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7981
Ultimately, I think we should have for symbols the same system as for
plugins, so users will be able to both contribute and dowload their own set.
Thanks.

I'm not a sponsor since there is now legal way for me to sponsor you by now.
QGIS project still does not gather all financial ressources that are
possible there. Maybe a discussion on paying Open Source licence for
Enterprise users who wish to contribute could be a workaround?

However, I have included Unit tests in all the new features or plugins I
funded. Yesterday, my plugin broke twice because of an API change. Should we
also push plugin unit tests to Travis? 

Unit tests will never be sufficient for such large and GUI tool like QGIS,
relying on so much different libraries. We need to reinforce that, but not
misconsidering how much user test are critical is a mistake. 

Loosing advanced users for testing, especially in by corps, is not wise. 
When Paolo says that such big enterprises should be able to put some money
for more tests, you are quite wrong for public corps I think.

Why?
 - Geo informatics are still misunderstood by decision makers, except for
those who are in the field of geospatial. We are often only 1 or 2 to
maintain, deploy, teach, fund QGIS, and maintain Postgis, web servers,
metadata catalog, Talend Jobs to feed all that with data. Open Source
revolution gave us tools that offered us more possibilities, less
administrative charges, and allowed uses to explode literally. That does not
make our employer prone to hire more persons. 

 - Some of us do that time to try to move forward with tools, maybe 10% max
of us. I push a lot in QGIS, when my job is to handle data, not softwares.
That worked, user are happy, so I gained new credits (more than in Mapinfo
era !). But now, I can't have enough time to spend it correctly. When I do,
my features are postponed by lack of QGIS resources. We are not on a good
way, please here that. LTR or not is not at stake here. 

I keep on trying to push new use cases, and polish every day's tools, but
that's a bit hard from here. I try to publish roadmaps before contracts,
very few answers from PSC on that.  Could PSC offer a workspace where we can
share the future, and give feedback and set priorities on all those tasks? 
If that place exists, is used and QEP's are always done, I think we can
handle fast releases, because like Mozilla, we plan a bit what is coming.

Hi all,
I believe it is the same stuff already fixed for other commands:

Grid instance has no attribute 'TYPES' See log for more details

See:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/1e958d25b5f120a45e40a0847ca060da91c9823f

I fixed it, but I suspect more broken modules are around. Please test
and report back, the fix is trivial.

Thanks.

Hey all,

I think I would just like to add to this that no matter what we do there is
always going to be someone/some company that doesn't like the process.  No
release process is perfect and is part of the game of software development.
We can adjust if required but I suspect it will be raised again in the
future.

Features, etc are also not 100% guaranteed to get into a release just
because a PR is open before the release.  Somethings are simply not ready
to be included or need more reviews.  Switching to a 6 month or 12 month
cycle doesn't change this fact as something can still be held past the
release date.

IMO the most important thing is consistency in what we do so it's
predictable for people be that 4,6, 12 month cycle.

Regards,
Nathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] FreeCAD integration with/within QGIS
Message-ID: <D971DDD6-962A-40E0-AB95-3E40E0B072E5@laposte.net>

I posted a feature request on the QGIS Application forum, it has been told me to post it there which was more appropriate.
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13581

FreeCAD is Python 2D/3D CAD package with parametric functions.
http://www.freecadweb.org/

It can also be used in console mode only and controlled by the command line.
http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Start_up_and_Configuration

FreeCAD can be run as a simple Python module.

Do you think QGIS could interfer through a plugin and/or scripts to get advanced CAD features from FreeCAD?

FreeCAD could be used for 3D design as well. For example, I want to get a building and then georeference it inside QGIS is the way of SketchUp does.
So FreeCAD could be used to get 3D design inside QGIS.

And maybe it could bring features to create an AutoCAD Map and/or AutoCAD Civil like bundle(s).
It could also bring more simple features of what RhinoCity/RhinoTerrain do with Rhino 3D and GIS.
http://www.rhinoterrain.com/en/home.html#.VhxN969e_MU

Just a set of ideas I wanted to share since I’m using both of them and like both of them. It could give a great open and powerful 3D GIS package.

However, now the process never ends, with messages:

Hi,

In the context of our release discussion I am forwarding the perspective 
of an educator and book author - just posted to the QGIS community 
mailing list. See forwarded mail.

I understand it must be a nightmare to teach, document and write books 
on QGIS at the current pace.

I hope that the devs and QGIS.ORG board can listen to their users and 
understand their perspective.

Andreas

Hi Otto,

In response to your question:

>>I just wonder how can we be more attractive to people writing QGIS book?

As someone who writes GIS book (including a QGIS book for marine biologists
(and a percentage of profits will be donated to the QGIS project from its
sales once I get the yearly sales in), and one I'm currently finishing for
undergraduate biologists, which also uses QGIS), I have given a lot of
thought to how to make QGIS more attractive to writers of books, so maybe I
can add my two-cents worth from this perspective (and as an educator in
general).

The main issue with writing books about QGIS (or indeed any software
package) is the time it takes to prepare, write and edit a book versus the
time between updates of the software package. It will typically take at
least 12 months to develop a book, edit it, test it out and then complete
it, especially if you are aiming for a high quality product. If the software
is updated during this time, this can cause major problems because either
the book is outdated before it is published, or it has to be re-worked to a
greater or lesser extent.

The main thing that causes problems is when there are changes in where tools
or settings are placed within individual menus (rather than the addition of
new functionality). In particular, people working from books can quickly
become lost if things are not exactly where a book says they are. This can
mean having to edit and re-test a book with each and every software update
(no matter how minor they might seem). For example, with the book I'm
currently finishing (which was written over a 12 months or so period), I
started it off under QGIS 2.4, then updated it for 2.6, and then again for
2.8.3 (with the latest version of QGIS now being 2.10, but I will stick with
the long-term legacy edition). The changes might have been relatively minor
between these editions of QGIS, but they are enough to have to re-work
books, and this slows the publication process. In addition, it greatly
reduces the useful lifespan of books written about using QGIS.

One of the things I really like about QGIS is that older versions are always
available, and that there is a long-term legacy edition. This makes it much
more attractive to write books using QGIS as the GIS software package as you
can tell people exactly what version to use (once they know how to do things
in one software version, it is easy enough to transfer this knowledge to
newer versions that might be available). However, this doesn't alter the
underlying issue that changes between QGIS versions, and the speed that
versions are put out make writing books problematic. This is not to say that
QGIS should not be updated regularly, and the addition of new functionality
is always to be applauded, it's just that it causes problems for would-be
book writers and publishers.

One potential way round this issue is to avoid relatively minor changes in
the location of tools and the layout of menus between different software
versions. For example, between QGIS 2.4 and 2.6, the location of the ADD
VECTOR LAYER tool was shifted from one set of menus to slightly different
one, meaning that books would need to be updated to remain useful. However,
as far as I can work out, this does not affect the functionality of QGIS in
any way (I may well be wrong on this point), but it does affect the ease
with which books can be written and remain up to date.

Now, from a programming point of view, it might not be easy to maintain the
location of tools and the layout of menus between software versions, but if
it could be (i.e. if the standard approach was to maintain layout as
appearance between versions rather than make relatively minor non-functional
changes with every update), it would make writing books using QGIS much
easier, and it would make the books more useful because they'd have a longer
shelf life.

In addtion, it would make it much easier to develop other resources that
would remain relevant for much longer periods of time (such as how to
videos, on YouTube - another thing I produce - and so on). Such a policy
would likely to lead to an increased uptake by educators, because they are
not having to continually update their instructions and exercises all the
time (it is the bain of many educators when, just before you start a block
of teaching, a key software package is updated and you are faced with having
to either hastily update your instructions, or somehow muddle through with
something that is out of date). Finally, it would also make producing
effective free documentation for QGIS by the QGIS project much, much easier,
because it wouldn't need to be continually updated (or at least, less of it
would need to be updated between software updates).

All this having been said, this is not a problem restricted to QGIS, or
indeed to GIS software in general. In fact, QGIS is actually one of the
better packages for maintaining menu layouts etc, but still, I feel that it
is limitting factor for those wishing to write and publish books, create
self-help resources and write effective documentation using QGIS.  However,
these are just my thoughts based on my own experiences, and others may
differ on this subject.

I hope this in some way helps, and thanks to all who develop QGIS for
producing such a great alternative to commercial GIS software packages (I
really feel that QGIS has come of age on the last 12 to 18 months).

All the best,

Colin

PS As a QGIS user, I'm always happy to donate a proportion of profits from
books back to the QGIS project, and will do this with all books I produce
that use QGIS.



But it
would be much nicer, if we could publish our own (free) documentation. We
could provide it as free download and people can pay for printed books, if
they want and authors could get payed from that, too. Would it make sense to
go in that direction, too?

Regards,
Otto

Hi,

I do feel for people who try and write books given the pace of QGIS, I
write the training manuals for my employer so I know what it feels like,
however, this is just the world we live in and a fact of software.  I have
tons of books on bookshelf that are outdated, new programming books come
out only to be outdated a year or so later.

If you are writing a book, manual, etc, you should target the LTR version
as it will not change. As we evolve the software, things need to change and
that includes UI. I'm not a fan of keeping stuff in the same place just
because that is how it has always been done. If we can do it better we
should.

Actually, knowing the impact on a list of plugins of an API break would
be a very useful information : an information on where to put the focus
regarding code reviews and what part of code has to be changed for
plugin developers.
I don't know if a Python script able to introspect most of the API usage
of a plugin is easily doable ... just an idea

I agree.
And especially automatic UI testing. I am not sure if we could one day
have some automatic tools to help testing UI, in the meantime human
tests are needed.

Some ideas to improve quality :

- information on who is doing what to the current code is not always
clear among developers (well at least for me ...). Trying to follow
github notifications, mailing lists, QEP, irc and git logs is too time
consuming. So, in order to avoid possible big changes from being merged
without the other devs being informed, could we choose only one channel
for changes that may affect others ? Something like a "purely
informative" PR on github ? With an implicit rule like "If nobody reacts
within a week, it will be merged"

- (re)state when QEP are needed

- try to include documentation when developing a new feature. If unit
tests are not present, this is a minimum to know what the feature is
supposed to do. Some features are not covered by unit tests neither by
documentation, so it is sometimes very hard (and time consuming) to
ensure non-regression ...

+1

I can imagine that the developers are proud of their product and want to  
promote it (2.10 vs. 2.8.3).
And in the past, it was really essential to migrate to the next version  
asap to get needed/missing features.

But even me, who likes to be on the edge and who is not afraid to test new  
things (which most people I know wont), I now stick to the LTR cause the  
advantages to switch the version compared to the hassle to update the  
system (and other peoples systems I would like to share projects with) are  
tending to zero or even minus.

Having to wait for 2 years for another version (and its nice new  
functions) on the other hand seems a little long to me.
A yearly base for a main version of QGIS would be fine. Documentation  
would have time to keep pace, bugs could be eliminated with point releases.

Sponsors who want their paid core features delivered asap should then have  
to take the "risk" and use intermediated releases, at the price of less  
documentation and maybe more bugs.

But the majority of users would benefit from that (which hopefully would  
result in more donations).

Just my 2 cents from my naive user perspective.
Bernd

p.s.
It would also be nice for me as a Linux user to have an easy possibility  
to run the master-version alongside LTR without compiling and stuff (like  
Windows user can).

What if paid core features include paid documentation ? At least in a
drafted, dev-oriented form ?
README-driven development helps to define specifications of a feature,
if other unit tests are missing (like GUI tests)

I'd be more radical, documentation should be included in every paid feature.
If not, we are gonna kill our documentation team with so much new features !

yes, the tmp folder is uique for all processing instances. I did not
consider the case of several of them running at the same time...

That can be easily fixed though.

Sorry, I think I do not well express my thoughts [0] . Maybe it's an UX
matter instead of developer's (so CCing UX-list). Let me reword it. Do we
need at the same place two "buttons" that do same thing?
I'll take QGIS2.4 as basis since these changes were introduced in 2.6 (if
i'm not wrong) and I haven't really tested legends in newer releases till
now.

In 2.4, after you add a legend in the composer, it adds all layers that are
visible. And legend item is by default independent of what happens to the
TOC. For example, renaming layers in the TOC won't be applied unless the
user decided to do so. 3 options were proposed:
- "auto-update" checkbox (checked by default) which automatically triggers
the changes done in the style of an *already added* layer to the legend
item. Issue : changes done to a layer when the option is unchecked are not
applied unless you redo changes in the same layer.
- This issue can be fixed by the use of "update item" option which applies
the classification of the selected legend item, one by one.
- and "update all" a contrario, resets all the legend according to layers
shown in the main map canvas : delete ALL the modifications added by the
user in the legend, add all the visible layers, removes the invisible ones
The main issue with this system is that legend may not be synchrone with
the map item since updating procedure in legend was mainly on either
already added layers or visible layers in canvas and these layers may not
be the ones in the map item. But on the other hand, there are three options
that do three different things.


In the current design (master 43c046b and it should be same thing in LTR),
if you add a legend, it  adds ALL the layers available in the project,
visible or not [1]. And any change applied to the properties of a layer
listed in the legend item is immediately triggered, meaning that the
"update item" option is no more needed. I agree with you. And having a real
and direct relation between layer panel and legend item is a great
improvement.
But I notice that changes in a layer properties are echoed in the legend
with or without "auto-update" option checked. Actually "auto-update" option
just resets the legend list, ensuring that the legend looks like the layer
panel (added/removed/moved layers). And so does "update all". Same thing!
One is automatic, the other one isn't.
Isn't there another way to provide same capabilities without two buttons?

Notice that there is a "Reset default" option in the contextual menu of
legend item. Better move it up?

Update

FreeCAD: Civil Engineering Design functions
http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=6973

The message I posted to the FreeCAD forum following the Paolo Cavallini's
advice.
http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=12803

I got a personal message as well about  QAD <https://github.com/geosim/QAD> 
, but it is more a LibreCAD at this stage and doesn't have the features of
FreeCAD, but it is very good to replace the existing actual CAD tools
available for QGIS.

This seems like a really good idea -
https://github.com/blog/2051-protected-branches-and-required-status-checks

I noticed it's now been rolled out, and think we should enable this on
the QGIS repo ASAP. I can't see any downsides to enabling this and
lots of upsides. Can someone with rights do this?

I agree... looking at this discussion we've got people on two opposing
sides - those who want development to slow down and stabilise, and
those who are disappointed in the slow speed of development and want
faster reviews/merges. We'll never be able to satisfy both sides.

So instead of this becoming an endless debate I think the important
thing is to work out what practical changes we should make. I'd say
the things we CAN change include:

- clarifying the process and role of QEPs and when they should/must be done
- put some kind of guidelines around PR reviews... when is code
suitable for direct merging and when should it be sent via a PR? Who
is responsible for this?
- ditto for unit tests... our contributor guidelines state that all
code added to core must be accompanied by units, so I assume the PSC
or someone made this decision in the past. We just all choose to
ignore it when convenient ;) I've got an idea for a half-way approach
on this, which I'll submit sometime as a replacement to QEP #5 (which
even I'll admit was too hardline)
- decide on the timeline for LTR releases (1/2 years? overlapping LTR releases?)
- and finally.... make a decision about the move to Qt5/Python
3.0/QGIS 3.0 and stop putting this difficult choice off!

Andreas,

+1 for a book section

Otto,

I believe the answer to your original question, "why it seems to be
attractive to write about QGIS there (in books) and not within the project
(oficial doxumentation)?", is given by the early testimony. Writting good
updated documentation takes lots of time, effort and patience,  things that
people don't seem to be willing to give for free (at least not the
desirable quantity).

While adding ad hoc non sponsored new features are fun and give their
authors some prestige and recognition, Writting documentation doesn't. So
there's not many reasons to work on it other than "love" to the project.

So sponsoring that effort is IMHO the way to go.

On the other hand, getting book authors to share their work, migth be
dificult, but there are also teachers and people giving qgis courses that
produce lots of materials and would gain a lot if they all share their work
among their peers and the project. I don't know how to reach them tho.

I think money is not really an issue here: compensation for writing
books is usually ridiculous, and not worth the effort. Want people wants
is recognition: having your name in print, on a book thousands of people
read, is the driving force.
Unfortunately this is difficult to achieve for a cooperative effort, but
perhaps we should giving due and appropriate credits to authors more
clearly (maybe a page with names and statistics: number of lines
written, number of commits?). I'm sure this may motivate some people.
All the best.

Hi,
I think it may be a nice idea. Anyone interested in doing at least an
exploratory attempt at seeing its feasibility?
All the best, and thanks for the suggestion.

I also thought that money is most important. But it seems to be only a
(minor) factor. Giving people recognition seems to be very important, too.
I agree with Paolo and maybe we can improve that.

Another thing I thought about is, if writing the official documentation in
QGIS is still too complicated? We tried to make it as simple as possible,
but I am not sure, if it is easy enough. Maybe not explained good enough?

Otto

Regarding this, I'm more worried about the human side of it then the
tech one. Convincing *hundreds* of plugin devs to upgrade their plugin
is a huge task, and if we fail to upgrade many of them, users will stick
to older QGIS versions, thereby effectively forking the project. I have
seen this in other projects, and the consequences are quite negative.
I think we should:
* start now warning plugin devs to prepare for the transition
* provide guidance and, if feasible, tools to smooth out the upgrade.
I'd be in favour of setting aside some resources for this.
All the best.

Glad of it. Can we start adding the Authors page, and figuring out how
to fill it automatically, with a measure of their contribution?
BTW. this would also apply to translation.

It might be, but I do not think this is really a huge issue. A motivated
person can find his way.

Thanks Otto.
All the best.

And of course the change to QT5 / Python 3 should happen immediately 
after the next LTS release - to give enough time to stabilize for the 
LTS release after the next LTS. Given the cited problems with OSX and 
qt4 it makes sense to do the switch after the next LTS.

Sure. Another option, if we feel there are no compelling reasons to have
another LTR (I believe 2.11 have few additional function people can't
really miss, and 2.8 seems generally quite well accepted), to skip next
LTR and go straight away with the transition after 2.12 is out.
The silence by our Release Manager worries me a bit ;)
Al the best.

When we want to move to 3.0 it has to be planned out well and documented.
There is going to be API breaks on a lot of different fronts, which might
mean it might be best to hold that release off for 12 months while
everything is sorted and people have time to catch up. As it will break
plugins again this isn't something we should just drop and hope that it
sorts it self out.

I know there has been a QEP for it start but I'm going to just start a wiki
checklist and we can put some notes in that for now.  This is something we
will need to move together on and make sure everyone is ready for,
including users.

I honestly don't think we have the luxury of that time frame. Sooner
or later, Qt4 will break on one of our platforms, and that will be a
worse situation for users than some missing plugins. To put this in
perspective, Qt4 IS BROKEN on the latest OSX release and can only be
used with a bunch of 3rd party hacks. We're can't delay any longer.

My thoughts:

- If we need another LTR in the 2.0 series (I'm not convinced we do),
the 2.14 should be this release. Followed by a 6 month cycle for 3.0
-  If not, then the 2.14 release should be 3.0 (with a 6 month cycle)

If you think we are that pressed IMO make the 2.14 as it currently is, the
2.8 and 2.14 API is the same as no need for LTR, and then we start to the
move to 3.0 with a longer release to solve the issues and prep people
moving plugins.

If i understood what bother you is the fact that there are two
options (check box and button) to do quite the same thing, to
me it's ok because i see they have different behaviour (one is fully 
automatic).
If this bother you so much you may open a feature request
and ask for the removal of the button.


all the best, Roy.

Given that i love the QGIS project, and i do not mean to be rude at all:

 From a user perspective

IMHO skipping the next LTR would be a huge mistake, people
find this statement on the QGIS web site:

"Every third release (starting with 2.8) is a long-term-release (LTR) 
that is maintained until the next long-term-release occurs."

so accordingly a migration/project planning is done, and then out of the 
blue there is no LTR (?)

Also i think someone ( surely I do ) miss very much this functions:

Editing join parameters, DBManager improvements, map composer scale bar 
sizing,
match categories to existing styles.

Thanks and best regards.

Also +1 for the idea and the effort. Would there be a (sketchy) timeline

considering to apply but have rather tight schedules.

Exactly, LTR 2.14 must be released as planned, 26.02.2016. People who
invested to new features or want to invest during 2.13, do expect to
get LTR 2.14 with those features.

+1 changing the plan right after making it isn't good.

Shall a change happen, it should be advertised before the next LTR
(following existing schedule) comes out.

Personally I wouldn't care about missing 2.12, but 2.14 LTR is what
I'm looking at (although it is always hard for me to figure out
exactly when it is expected, I guess Feb 2016 ?).

Oi Sandro,

plz bookmark ;-)

http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/index.html

in the section 'Download QGIS' roadmap linking to:

http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#release-schedule

So 26.02.2016 will be YOUR day :-)

(off course 2.20 is only in there because certain people ;-) complained
about missing dates.... given the recent discussions I'm not sure we
will make it a 2.20....)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps my personal idea:

Work hard on 2.14 AND docs for it, to be the last but most stable 2.x
version ever by being very carefull about what put in 2.13 (maybe a
(big)feature freeze)
Then after 2.14 concentrate on moving to Python3/Qt5, so general users
can stick to 2.14 for a loooong time, and dev's have some extra time to
get the 3.0/Qt5/Python3 work done?

+1 to make 2.14 a longer-term release (2 years ?),
I don't see a drawback to that (the weekly-silence rule makes it 
so that if there's nothing to fix, there's nothing to release,
reducing the maintainance cost over time).

Now the question is: when would a QT5 compatible version be needed ?
And, would it be ok for it to not be an LTR before Feb 2017 ?

A Qt5 compatible version is already needed.

QGIS is one of the blockers for the Qt4 WebKit removal in Debian for 
example (see: https://bugs.debian.org/784514).

> And, would it be ok for it to not be an LTR before Feb 2017 ?

For Debian that's probably too late, the freeze in preparation for the 
stretch stable release will likely happen in November 2016.

Kind Regards,

Bas

And would you need an _LTR_ for debian packaging ?

Yes, because the LTRs are most suited for backports to stable (as they 
don't require project upgrades every couple of months).

I also don't have the time to keep up with the frequent regular releases 
(the Debian GIS team is too understaffed for that), so the LTRs are 
ideal for Debian.

Unless someone steps up to maintain the qgis package in Debian, I'm not 
considering switching back to the regular releases.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Like you said the "update all" button behaviour can be done by selecting
and unselecting the Update checkbox. But I find it not very elegant
solution. Therefore the "extra" button makes sense to me.

Besides, it would be nice if, in the future, the "update all" button become
"updated selected itens" if Items are selected. Not sure if that is planed,
but I can sure make a feature request for that.

Hi,

Seems like all protections (against force push, deleting and failing tests)
are a good fit.

There may be instances where some tests are failing on Mac, due to an
oddity with that platform and not with the actual code per se, i.e. the
test needs updated for Mac or some Mac-specific bit needs added to source.
In light of such cases, it might be best to not require that all tests pass
for the Merge button to be enabled, or it may force some devs to wait until
Mac-specific issues are addressed first.

If we if strictly enforce all tests pass, maybe there is a way to tell
Travis that a failure on one of the test platforms is non-critical (Mac),
but a failure on another (Linux) is. ??

+1000 for this approach. An LTR branch (released on the schedule already
set) should *absolutely* be the release prior to a major overhaul, like
with 3.0/Qt5/Python3, if possible.

I would add that LTR is something that has been very well received by sys
admins doing very large rollouts. It would be very detrimental to the
project to miss/skip ANY LTR release, especially just after making inroads
to these enterprise users, and harmful to the project's future if the LTR
(or some concept of long term stability) is not always part of the release
schedule.

With regards to Mac and Qt4 support, it may be that even an LTR 2.14
release will have a very short lifespan, given that the next Mac OS upgrade
will probably significantly break Qt4; and, I seriously doubt there will be
people wanting to resurrect Qt4 again.

Hi Jürgen,

If I haven't understood completely wrong the initial LTR releases have new
features just like regular releases, but no new features are added to bug
fix release of course.
What I ment was that basically now freezed 2.12 will become the LTR in next
February after all its features have been tested the next four months in
2.12. And no new features are added to LTR after 2.12 release.
This was not a proposal but just a thought how we could avoid bugs and
crashes that are caused by brand new features.

-Lauri

so, wouldn't this be a strong argument against 2.14 as an LTR?
I understand the same will hold true for Debian/Ubuntu as well.
all the best.

It's indeed not very elegant nor intuitive. I've thought about a pushbutton
that would stay pushed when automatic option is on and released to stop
automatic updating. But I couldn't find somewhere we have tools using this
kind of effect in QGIS.

Hi,

I am adding the UX (user interface) list about this legend discussion.

The whole situation about legend updates and the current legend GUI in 
composer is indeed a bit confusing and changed quite a bit in the last 
one (or two? releases). I also think that the "Auto update" checkbox and 
the "Update all" button next to it are almost redundant.

As far as I can tell, in the very recent master version, all the symbol 
changes that happen in the legend tree of the main application 
immediately reflect to the composers anyway (without any user 
intervention and regardless of the AutoUpdate checkbox - I think this is 
the expected behavior that most users want) - so can't we remove that 
Autoupdate button? Or better rename it to "Reset Legend" - which would 
more accurately describe what it does?

I also think that the "AutoUpdate" checkbox should not be turned on by 
default. The AutoUpdate now only concerns that new layers or entries in 
the layer are automatically added into the legend. I doubt that many 
users want to have that behavior enabled by default - because it means 
that the legend can grow uncontrolled in size and run off the page 
relatively quickly.

@Alexandre: note that the "Update selected" already works on the context 
menu (right-klick) if you select a layer. But now that updates happen 
automatically, I am not sure if the update of a single layer is needed 
anymore.

Just my thoughts on the issue.

Hi all,
when importing a shapefile, the resulting layer name is taken by default
== to the name of the shp, but is not dsplayed in the interface. When
clicking on Show result, nothing happens. If I give a name by hand, then
all works fine.
Should I open a ticket?
Thanks.

Touché, Paolo. You are probably right here, though there are still a couple
of unknowns at this point.

By "very short lifespan" I am referring to the next Mac OS (10.12?), which
not everyone will use. It is unknown at this time whether Qt4 can be made
to support it (maybe we get lucky again and it doesn't break Qt4 much
more). On the other hand, I still get requests to support 10.6 (from 2009)
for nightlies.

If we look at some basic Mac OS adoption trends by users [0], it is
apparent that they adopt the latest OS much more so than users of Windows.
However, it is unclear how much this reflects the general Mac QGIS user's
OS adoption rate (guessing it is roughly equivalent).

Basically, as Nyall has pointed out, something needs done for Mac ASAP, not
4 or 8 or 12 months from now. Towards a solution, I would like to start
providing a Qt5-based nightly for Mac (after 2.12 is released).

I don't think having Qt5 on OSX is so much the issue but the change the
PyQt5/Python3 as that has the larger impact because it changes all the
plugins.

As the developer of a single plugin, and a very inexperienced one, can I ask
how Py3/Qt5 will work? Will we require separate branches for QGIS2 and QGIS3
versions of our plugins? In other words, it is plausibly feasible to have a
single plugin codebase which will try Py3/Qt5 and fail back gracefully to
Py2/Qt4?

I'm guessing not.

Makes sense, especially since PyQt4 can be built against Qt4 or Qt5. Then
maybe it is reasonable to have the 2.13 dev cycle focus mainly on moving to
Qt5, so that it results in a 2.14 LTR that works with Qt5? Then, break API
and introduce Py3 with 3.0 (assuming 2.14 is last 2.x release)?

Would having a 2.14 LTR that works with Qt5 poorly affect other platforms?

Hey Tom,

I suspect it won't be that bad overall but we do need to just see what is
needed first.  The Python 2 -> 3 change isn't so bad, there is a few things
but they are workable.

The change to PyQt5 is also workable.  You could do this kind of thing for
the imports:

if version >= 3.0:
   from PyQt5.QtCore import *
else:
   from PyQt4.QtCore import *

There is also some other things we could do here to help I think like:

from qgis.PyQt import *

Where qgis.PyQt is a wrapper module around the above version checks so you
don't have to version check in each class.

Changes to the Qt API is the other thing to handle as things have been
removed from Qt4 in Qt5 but I'm not sure on the list.

All in all I don't suspect you will have to maintain two different code
bases just aware of the API differences.  This is mainly what I mean when I
say planning.  Having some resources for people to use

I really like the idea of making one of the focus of the next dev cycle to
be qt5. Even if 2.14 is still compiled against 2.14 by default, it'd be
great to attempt to reach user experience parity between 2.14 & 2.15 on the
major platforms QGIS is shipped on.

Having faced the need to compiled and used QGIS using qt5 libs less than
two weeks ago to fix an issue in qt4, it's nice to see that things mostly
work, but it did show some fine tuning is needed (cmake logic refinements
to handle qt5 libraries, finding a way to deal with qtwpolar, and in-app
issues like broken keyboard shortcuts etc.).

Maybe a hackfest where every dev work on their area of code against qt5
would be cool to finance? :)

Arg I meant to say feature parity between QGIS with qt4 and QGIS with qt5.
Darn smartphones.

Fixed. It was really the text mode output once more, introduced by
bulk WIN32 to Q_OS_WIN update.

It should work in the next nightly build 2.11.0-90.

That is (was?) the plan.

Then I didn't understand what you are proposing.  Are you suggesting to let the
LTR and the regular release diverge indefinitely?   That something we (I?)
would try to avoid - we (I?) don't have time to maintain two versions.
Backports will get harder and harder - and if we switch to Qt5 it might get
impossible to maintain the old LTR any longer anyway.  It it needs to be
replaced by an newer version.

Isn't the plan for 2.14 to be the Febrary 2016 LTR ?
Every third release:
  2.8 LTR
  2.10
  2.12
  2.14 LTR
  ...

Fixed, it was the different off_t size in GRASS and QGIS on Windows.
It should work in the next nightly build 2.11.0-90.

Oops, of course - darn numbers.

What we release in February (ie. 2.14) will the be the next LTR.  And it will
enter the LTR repositories when the following release is put out (ie. after
another 4 months; see [0]).

Unless all of the above gets turned over in the meantime.

​Do we have a ticket for this issue yet?
I'm afraid I haven't had time yet to look into this and form an opinion or
even a suggestion for how the UI should be improved.
It would be great if the users interested in enhancing this part of QGIS
could come up with a draft and open a ticket where it can be discussed in
detail and with images :)
Thanks a lot!

Yes, we can do that. Edit ci/travis/osx/script.sh and modify the
exceptions line (the -E regex) to include the test. Then it'll be
excluded on just OSX but not Linux. You'll see the PyQgsServer test is
already excluded for those very reasons. There's also two tests which
are excluded on every platform (OSM and WCS), as they rely on
unreliable 3rd party services and were occasionally failing for
reasons outside of our control.

Note that failing test protection doesn't block developers with commit
rights from pushing code which fails tests (which I think is a good
thing), it just blocks the merge button on the github page. This means
the reviewer can still manually merge and push the PR if there's a
good reason to allow a failing test in.

Tim can you switch this on our Github repo?

Hi all,  (Radim)

I am getting the following error on building: http://codepad.org/ZZiB2R63
Is this related to a local problem?

Anyone confirms?

Hi,
I'm more missing a discussion about why in fact all loaded layers are  
displayed in the legend, and not only those activated in the canvas.
There is a reason why a deactivate layers: I want to produce a map only  
with those active ones = shown in the map.
So why do I have to manually remove unneeded (in my cases often dozens of  
layers) from the legend, or, even worse, delete them from the project just  
to re-add them when I produce the next map?

It would be much smarter to add just those active in the moment of  
creating the legend. In case I forgot one I need, I will be happy to add  
this one manually.

Or did I miss sth obvious?

Cheers
Bernd

I meant per platform here, not per test. But I see how the PR submitter
could just augment their PR with a commit to exclude the failing test (if
deemed necessary by the reviewer). Or, the reviewer could just push the PR
from their local repo. Either way, the reviewer would then need to notify
someone about fixing the excluded test if they don't know how.

Then, I think that protection should be turned on, since both workarounds
are at the reviewer's discretion.

Odd about the PyQgsServer test... it passes on my Mac, but is the only test
not passing on the Travis instance [0] hooked up to my forked repo (I have
same OS and Xcode versions). In fact all tests now pass on my local Mac,
which is VERY cool. Thanks for explaining why the other tests are excluded.

Objet : [Qgis-developer] [QGIS-UX] Composer Legend items: what are the differences between "auto-update" and "update all" options?
Date : mer., oct. 14, 2015 23:23

Hi,
I'm more missing a discussion about why in fact all loaded layers are displayed in the legend, and not only those activated in the canvas.
There is a reason why a deactivate layers: I want to produce a map only with those active ones = shown in the map. 
So why do I have to manually remove unneeded (in my cases often dozens of layers) from the legend, or, even worse, delete them from the project just to re-add them when I produce the next map?

It would be much smarter to add just those active in the moment of creating the legend. In case I forgot one I need, I will be happy to add this one manually.

Or did I miss sth obvious?

Cheers
Bernd

Dear QGIS community

We would like to better understand how you are using QGIS so that we can
improve the way that we manage the project. We have compiled this short
survey, and would be most appreciative if you could take a few minutes to
complete it for us. All responses are anonymous and we will share the
results with the community so that we can all benefit from the insights
gained. You can find the survey here:

http://blog.qgis.org/2015/10/15/take-the-qgis-user-survey/

Could I also ask you to publicise the survey on twitter / facebook etc. so
that we can get as broad a range of opinions as possible.

Thanks!

Regards

Tim Sutton

Hi all,
Wouldn't this survey reach more people if there was link with translated
versions? Not easy to understand answer when you are not a good english
speaker.

Hmm I don’t see a way to do it with the google forms platform. We would also have the issue of how to translate the results back to english.

What I suggest is that you take the form, copy it and then translate it, then we can share the link. Anybody willing to do that please contact me offlist and I will share a copy of the form with you to work on, and then we can share the link to the translated form here.

Regards

Tim

After some quick vector digitizing tests: awesome tool
for QGIS !!

the only (minor) issue i found is that area boundary color does not
match the simbology settings (e.g. green boundary also if it's not
shared by two areas)

thanks, Roy.

Few remarks if I may:
- Which version of QGIS do you most regularly use? it lacks an option for
those that use a release < LTR (and they are many)
- How often do you think LTR QGIS versions should be made? Miss a "don't
care" option
- How often do you think non LTR releases of QGIS should be made? Miss a
"don't care" option
- When I get stuck using QGIS, I..... ask... What about forums other than
stackoverflow? something as georezo.net, forumsig.org not only focused on
QGIS but QGIS has its place? Are they among what's called regional QGIS
User group? And what about going back to the documentation as an option?
- Which is your highest priority for spending QGIS funds on ? I d'on't know
if google sheet can do that but it would be nice to classify them by
priority. And also miss a "don't care"
- About donation, is "giving time to the project" (testing, reporting and
fixing bugs, documentation) considered as donation? Or is it just about
money?

Most of the questions (mandatory) suppose that the user has a point of
view. If this survey is spread, it means that it will touch people that use
QGIS even regularly but haven't already tought about some questions.
Mandatory answers when they have no idea will give wrong answer imho

I changed the second to say ‘NON LTR release’ hopefully that makes it clearer.

That can go in the ‘other’ box

Again please just use the ‘other’ box for this.

What about forums other than stackoverflow? something as georezo.net <http://georezo.net/>, forumsig.org <http://forumsig.org/> not only focused on QGIS but QGIS has its place? Are they among what's called regional QGIS  User group? And what about going back to the documentation as an option?

I added ‘Other for this’ - I don’t think I can make an exhaustive list

> - Which is your highest priority for spending QGIS funds on ? I d'on't know if google sheet can do that but it would be nice to classify them by priority. And also miss a "don't care”

No I couldn’t find a way to do priority lists so went for the ‘pick the most important’ approach.

I added a note to say you can also donate time.

Well the purpose of the survey is to know people’s point of view and hopefully prod them to think about these things too :-)

Thanks very much for your feedback - much appreciated!

OSGeo-fr has a limesurvey apps working and that allow survey in different 
langage. I think that we can give you access to the admin interface to create 
next survey, we can even have a specific template for QGIS.

If you need a point of contact, I am avalaible!

Green means that both sides are topologically correct. If there is no
area outside a ring, it is correct. Try to attach a dangling boundary
to the ring and it should become orange.
Maybe the name in symbology is not precise.

Message-ID: <8F2D4AC2-8387-40A9-A0D7-B02B4899AF66@qgis.org>

Hi All

The response to the english survey has been incredible, but many of you requested to be able to do the survey in your own language. Thanks to Alexandre Neto, you can now do the survey in Portuguese:

http://blog.qgis.org/2015/10/15/take-the-qgis-user-survey-in-portuguese/ <http://blog.qgis.org/2015/10/15/take-the-qgis-user-survey-in-portuguese/>

I know there is a Spanish survey in the works - I will post it to this list when it is ready. If anyone else wants to translate the survey to their native language, please contact me off list.

Thanks

Tim

Hi Tim,

LTR (Long Term Release) isn't defined until the second page of the survey,
but it's acronym is used prior. Maybe define it in the beginning header of
the survey; and, maybe with a one line description?

If the output name is generated by grass module, it is hard to get it
back to the GUI. I have disabled the 'View output' button if output
name is not entered.

It happens only when run from QGIS GUI and works if the same command
is run from GRASS shell?

It happens both from the QGIS GUI and from the QGIS embedded shell.
BTW: it is apparently not possible to paste commands in the shell, a
major annoyance - should I open a ticket?

So it seem to be a problem in r.contour, thus question to grass list.

Do you mean X Windows selection + paste by middle button? That works
for me. If it does not work for you, please create a new issue and
possibly try to find more details when it does not work (copy from any
application or just from module's output, distribution, KDE/Gnome...)

If you mean Ctrl+C + Ctrl+V, it is not implemented. You can create
feature request issue.

Isn't the sign of marker's Y offset on marker line interpreted
wrongly? I see the marks to go down with positive offset and vice

ok, will do. I suspected an issue from QGIS side because of
QgsGrassRasterProvider::statusChanged( QString ) in
/tmp/buildd/qgis-2.11.0+git20151013+e193c7c+99unstable/src/core/raster/qgsrasterlayer.cpp:842

Subject: [Qgis-developer] custom legend with python API
Message-ID: <CAC_57x+X6TEFsuOw7mgTv4UjymJFuL2JfK6+HHkxQ-q8hjfzpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,


I am using the python API to generate pdf reports. I need to change some
labels in a raster legend.

I attempted to use the QgsLegendModelV2, and QgsSymbolV2LegendNode classes
(setData or setUserLabel), but the "default implementation does nothing and
returns false" according to the documentation.

What is the more appropriate way to access and update the legend nodes?


Thanks

It should show warning dialog if a module is using region and input is
outside current region.
There was a bug, fixed now.

Yes Radim,

Just like Labels placement offset.

What seems to me is that this has been going on for so long that people
have become accustomed! At least that happened to me! But I also think it
is wrong.

Agreed ! I hit that couple of time but it didn't went up to conscious level.
I always thought I understood it badly.

Hi Radim,

Another issue:
The temporal maps are not listed in the input widgets. I assume that a "translation" for GRASS parser options (https://grass.osgeo.org/programming7/parser__standard__options_8c.html) to the QGIS GUI is missing for the temporal modules:
G_OPT_STDS_INPUT
G_OPT_STDS_INPUTS
G_OPT_STDS_OUTPUT ...

Not essential, but makes them easier to use...

Kind regards
Stefan

Which revision? Please use current master if possible.

Please start with points and lines. When you digitize a point or line, nothing is displayed in canvas? Do you see the elements if you switch style to default? Do you see the features in attribute table? Are the elements written to the map when you close editing?

 Note that QGIS can only display features of one type in a layer, if you add point layer and digitize a line, it will no show in point layer after editing is closed, a new layer with lines must be added to canvas.

I think it's better to stick with GRASS symbology convention,
otherwise it's quite confusing if you use both systems;

e.g. consider the *isle* below

++++++o++++++
+          *          +
+          *          +
++++++o++++++

+ area on one side (of the boundary) e.g. orange

* area on both sides, e.g. green


  also
there seems to be some problem with the symbology while
in edit mode, some how all boundaries disappear at some
point, but if you exit edit mode and save everything is ok

Thanks, Roy.

I don't know if this mail was notified to you, but I am noticing a
strange issue compiling qgis with grass support.

If I use only -DWITH_GRASS7=ON I get a build error (as from codepad
link in the previous mail) while adding -DWITH_GRASS=ON
I can build just fine.

is this the expected behaviour?
is it necessary to have both grass versions?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <DB3PR08MB025278836140D15310C498A0A73C0@DB3PR08MB0252.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

I ran some test with GRASS Plugin in particular
digitizing some vetor layers. Given that is
quite nice how well it's already integrated with QGIS
edit tools, I found some minor issue, this may be
by design but i'm saharig my thoughts *(IMHO)*, hoping i'll
find some time for further testing.

(1) *Create new GRASS vector layer in QGIS*:
If I understand well we should use the browser panel contestual menu,
i see there are three options ( New point layer, new line, new polygon);
anyway GRASS vector format AFAIK has no such distinction given
that any vector layer can contain any geometry type. This can
be confusing, developing some kind of hybrid between the shapefile
and GRASS own vector format, will also "invalidate" all
existing GRASS documentation about vector editing and GRASS
vector format. We'll need to be overly zealos to explain when
and how things work differently in QGIS otherwise it will be quite
confusing for new users.

(2) *Attribute table editing*:
not able to figure out how it works, i managed
to edit single feature using the "Identify Features"

(3) *Symbology of topo feature while editing*:
Although i think there may be some bugs, I think
it's better to be consistent with GRASS GIS otherwise
see the documentation problem at point (1).


Thanks and best regards, Roy.

Hi Richard,

I think your question is more suitable for developers list (cc-ing).

AFAIK, such behavior currently not available in Processing, but
I think this is good addition. If I'm not wrong we already even have
similar feature request.

Also I agree that having some utilities class for common operations
in C++ code with Python bindings will be useful.

It is most probably the problem with different off_t size in GRASS and
QGIS. I have already implemented fix, but the problem is how to get
real off_t size from GRASS. On Windows, it is now hard coded 8 bytes.
build_off_t_size was added to g.version but it will but available in
7.1. For now, you have to ensure that QGIS and GRASS are compiled with
the same off_t size (I am not sure how) or change in
qgsgrassprovider.cpp
  typedef off_t grass_off_t;
to
  typedef qint32 grass_off_t;
or
  typedef qint64 grass_off_t;
according to the size used in GRASS.

If you have GRASS 7 installed and you want to compile GRASS 7
provider/plugin, use WITH_GRASS7=ON, otherwise OFF.
If GRASS 7 is not found automatically, specify also  GRASS_PREFIX7 and
 GRASS_INCLUDE_DIR7.

Hi Radim, thanks for the feedback. I have installed (compiled from 
source) GRASS7. I used the option WITH_GRASS7=ON (I also always specify  
GRASS_PREFIX7 and GRASS_INCLUDE_DIR7). But that results in the 
compilation to fail. If however I use WITH_GRASS=ON and WITH_GRASS7, I 
can build QGIS with the GRASS7 plugin. I thought it strange one also 
need to set WITH_GRASS=ON, and from your reaction I get that it 
shouldn't be required? I had seen a similar message on the email list, 
but can't find it right now. But it means I am (probably) not the only 
one experiencing this.

Found this issue testing GRASS plugin in edit mode:

Draw a closed boundary in a GRASS vector layer

add a centroid inside the boundary

now I need to add a node on the boundary
(cannot find how to do that is there a way to
  add a node on a boundary?)

split features seems to do the trick but
the boundary become red (signaling some topology error)

exit editing and save

restart editing and a centroid is displayed where i used the
split feature tool, on the boundary, i was expecting to find
a node instead.

I hope this is clear,

Roy.

There is currently no option in Processing to do that, and you should
probably add that logic to the algorithm itself (like for instance, if
the value of the parameter is equal to the default value, it should be
replaced with the last value, which should be itself stored by the
algorithm or taken from the Processing history)

I suggest adding a feature request, so this idea is not forgotten.

About the common functions, I definitely agree with that. It will also
help plugins look more homogeneous (and most likely, more stable). The
qgis.utils module looks like a good place to put all this functions.

More important that implementing those functions would be to actually
document them and make sure people know about them (the obvious place
to write about them is the PyQGIS cookbook), and try to enforce using
them in plugins.

I have quite a few general functions that I use for several plugins. I
wouldn' mind adding them to qgis.utils (or any other core module that
we agree on using for this) and if anyone does the same, I think we
can end up with a nice collection of them.

Cheers

Hello,

Anybody wants to review my Pull Request to check that I didn't forget some 
books?

DO you think that the structure is the good one, may be there is a more formal 
way to list books.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/285/files

Thanks,

Y.

What's the intended order? Newest first?
Would be good to have a note at the top imho.

	LTR and master version
Message-ID: <CANxjxaqxFVZ_krV5XGww5Jx8HXW6QL9MfCEB=1NGYTxf+4jw3w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just noticed that when a layer has invalid geometries (e.g.
self-intersections in polygon layer) the editing tool behaviour is
different between master and LTR version.
In LTR version you can fix it manually by selecting the vertices and
deleting them eventually while in master version it is not possible
anymore to select the vertices for invalid geometries.

IMHO, better LTR behaviour as allowing the user to handle the
incorrect geometry by editing it manually in addition to geometry
checker tools.

Thoughts??

Best Regards,
-SL

Hi,

I also confirm this behavior. If I have GRASS_PREFIX and GRASS6 and GRASS7
both on, the compilation goes well.

If I put just GRASS7 on, I get:

[ 62%] Building CXX object
src/gui/CMakeFiles/qgis_gui.dir/layertree/moc_qgslayertreeview.cxx.o
[ 62%] Building CXX object
src/gui/CMakeFiles/qgis_gui.dir/layertree/moc_qgslayertreeviewdefaultactions.cxx.o

Linking CXX shared library ../../output/lib/libqgis_gui.so
[ 62%] Built target qgis_gui
make: ** [all] Erro 2


But if I put only GRASS6 on, it also compiles well.

So, it seems that there is something with the GRASS7, which also requires
GRASS6.

Fixed. Unfortunately t.list, which is the only way to get list of
temporal datasets is too slow. I asked in GRASS list:

In the meantime, I have divided boundary with area on one side into
two symbols, so that it is possible to show visually which side is
broken. The style is left the same for now, because I am not sure
which is the best (parallel lines with different color, red markers
with offset to broken area...) but user can set his own style. I have
also renamed the symbols:
  * Boundary (topological error on both sides
  * Boundary (topological error on the left side)
  * Boundary (topological error on the right side)
  * Boundary (correct)

I believe that if a boundary is topologically incorrect, even on one
side and even if the chain is broken in another place,  it should be
visualized. Your argument about consistency with GRASS is important,
but in this case, I'll probably resist.

BTW, try this in GRASS:

+++++++++++++++++++
+                                    +
+    ++++++o++++++     +
+    +          *            +    +
+    +          *            +    +
+    ++++++o++++++     +
+                                    +
+++++++++++++++++++

Does it still make sense for the boundaries of inner areas?

New boundaries digitized in this session or old boundaries which were
present in the map before editing started or both. Are you able to
describe "at some point" with reproducible steps? If it happens again,
try to look into attribute table and check topo_symbol, select a
record and check if it is highlighted in the map and open attribute
form and check topo symbol there.

Thanks

I made this change and with qint64 (typedef qint64 grass_off_t;) QGIS does
not crash, but the geometry just disappears after editing. Please see here:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5772257/qgis/grass_node_tool.ogv

The same is happening with GRASS6.

With typedef qint32 grass_off_t it still crashes.

I'm using GRASS 7.0.1-2~ubuntu14.04.1 from
https://launchpad.net/~grass/+archive/ubuntu/grass-stable
and GRASS 6.4.3-3 from http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/grass
on Xubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Thanks!
Pedro

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Meaning of "Canvas Units" in project properties?!?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiYE_NZ5eFdbvqNPCjpROjGGNGoEoX7-jK4F_vaGbu0yg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm totally struggling to understand what the "Canvas Units" setting
in project properties is there for, and what it's ACTUALLY supposed to
do...

Currently, it seems like a read-only property. Whatever you set it to
(regardless of whether or not OTF is enabled or not), it's always
reset whenever you reopen the properties dialog. But the broken
behaviour goes a lot deeper than just this.... looking at the code
it's very unclear what this setting is there for. I think it's
*supposed* to allow users to override the map units for the current
project CRS, but why would we want this? Changing it would result in
totally meaningless measurements....!

Unless I'm misunderstanding, this setting should be removed and
replaced with a label showing what the units are for the current
projection.


I'm trying to get to the bottom of http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11986
(Area calculation is wrong with OTF enabled), but even after reading
the source I'm struggling to understand how QGIS is supposed to be
handling this. And if a developer who CAN read the source has no idea,
how are normal users supposed to understand this? ;)

Any ideas on what the correct behaviour should be, please let me know
ASAP and maybe I can get this sorted before release.

Hello everyone,

I just want to know how qgis calculates canvas scale when you have a loaded
layer with a SRC in degrees.

Thank you.

Hi Guido,
please have a look to some of the plugins that already implement this.
One of the latest:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/nl_basis/
We are in the process of revamping the Python documentation - please
feel free to open a feature request to add this inf, this would be the
right time to do it.
All the best.

If the same happens with GRASS6, the problem is not related to off_t size.

Could you try to:
- create new line layer
- digitize line with 2 vertices
- close editing (save changes)
- start editing
- move 1 vertex
- close editing (save changes)
- run in grass shell: v.out.ascii format=standard input=<your map>

and post the output of v.out.ascii here?

Hi all,
when downloading Scuole pubbliche WFS from Italian National CSW I
consistently get an error [0]. Is this a server mistake, or the handling
from Metasearch?
Thanks.

That is what I was looking for. In previous version, the layer history
was available from the layer metadata. I found this more convenient.
Thanks.

Hi Paolo,

I guess you are referring to the "command history" of your GRASS session?
It is stored in a file named ".bash_history" which is a simple text file, located within the folder of your mapset (GRASSDB/LOCATION/MAPSET/.bash_history).
You should be able to access it via browser...

Otherwise r.info and v.info should be able to show the history of a raster or vector map.

Hope that helps...

Cheers
Stefan

Yes, GRASS vector can have more geometry types and you can digitize
all types in QGIS. QGIS layer however, supports only one geometry
type.  It is not possible to add in QGIS a layer without a type. So
when a new empty layer is created, a type must be chosen. The type
selected by user is only used for the layer added to canvas/legend,
the created vector map is empty.

I don't think that it invalidates all documents about digitizing, the
principles and the format is the same. The editing tool is different
and it has some particularities which I'll describe in QGIS
documentation. It is not possible to support all the flexibility of
GRASS vector format through QGIS interface.

Changing the values in table cells (when editing) does not work?

Regarding the symbology of boundaries, I am convinced that the
distinction between area/area and area/isle used in GRASS editor is
useless while distinguishing of boundaries with topological error is
essential for effective editing.

Hi,

I'm asking for your input on a discussion concerning the Processing
dissolve tool here: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13502

How should it ideally work, i.e. how should the attributes of the dissolved
features be treated? Given the current Processing limitations, how should
the options look like?

Thanks in advance! Best wishes
Anita

nice discussion you bring up

Shouldn't it behave like the ftools dissolve tool currently does?

Hi,

I think this is a bit of feature request, but I would say it should be
possible to have some control over the remaining attributes. Trimming all
attributes seems poor to me, but keeping the attributes with "first
attribute found" without informing the user it's also not good.
Harrissou Santanna mentioned the Dissolve with Stats Plugin. That's the way
ArgGIS does it, you can have stats or even join/concatenate of the
non-dissolved attributes.

Ok, I see, could it be better to disable point and line tools
while working with polygons and so on? Just an idea.

Well yes, sorry, not all documentation of course.

Opening the attribute table i get a lot of records with NULL values
I can imagine that those are for boudaries and the filled ones are
centroid records (?)

Well actually in GRASS you simply have different colors based
on the topology of boundaries, but I understand now,
given the QGIS layer limitations you explained at point (1),
that this may not be possible because QGIS layer does not
have any information about boundaries relative positions.

Thanks, Roy

Could you elaborate on that? Does it do stats for every suitable field? 
This would multiply the number of fields in the output, besides there 
could be problems with field names (dbf has 10 signs if I recall 
correctly) or can you choose the which field to run the stats on? How 
many fields?

Have a look into the Dissolve with stats plugin.

For each field, the user can choose what "stat" to use. The attribute name
will be maintained since only one stat can be calculated for each
attribute. You can discard the fields that you have no interest in maintain

If I remember well, ArcGIS does it differently. For each field, you can
choose several stats. The resulting attribute name will be a combination of
the original name and s stat suffix.

Hi devs,
could you explain me why:

1. within the clipping of a geotiff there's no (easy) option for 
compression? or why not using something like "clip with the same 
compression as input"?
I think is not so friendly for users to add a code string in the process 
before launching it.

2. overviews/pyramids should be built separately and not directly when 
someone adds a layer? couldn't be helpful an arcgis-style panel asking 
you what you prefer?

Thank you in advance for your time and helpfullness!
all the best,

Nic

Both suggestions make sense to me: there are cases in which you do not
want compression and pyramids, so we should leave it optional, but
having a sensible default seems a good suggestion.
IMHO it is worht the while to open two feature requests.
All the best.

Hi,
I wrote the "dissolve with stats" plugin and it would be great if it 
were not needed any more ! I lack time to maintain it properly, I think 
it is broken now because of the new dissolve behaviour. Is it worth it 
if I try making it a processing subplugin 
(https://github.com/juliepierson/DissolveWithStats/issues/2) ?
Thanks,
Julie.

​Yes, it used to behave exactly like ftools still does. But the arguments
behind the latest changes to the script are that the (ftoos) behavior is
not what users expect.

The current behavior is not deterministic and therefore in the long run
probably not the most desirable behavior. Reading Bernhard's comments in
the issue, it's quite hard to improve without considerably extending
parameter handling in processing.

Best solution IMO:

 * Keep the current/old behavior for the moment
 * Add new parameter possibilities (e.g. a table/array of string
(attribute name) -> combobox (aggregate function) mappings)
 * Use the current behavior as default setting for fields where the
aggregate funtion is undefined

+ Full backwards compatibility
+ Full control (/as soon as it gets done)
+ One tool for one job (as opposed to "old dissolve" vs. "new dissolve"
tools)
- The default behavior may not be optimal (Can still be changed for 3.0
if it's considered to be better)

I think the best soultion would be to add an extra parameter with the
fields to keep and the stats for them, so if it's empty, it behaves as
it does now

The trick here is that there is no support for a parameter such as
this (which should be entered in a table and probably internally
represented as a dict or array of tuples). Should be easy to implement
it using a string, but then a custom UI should be created, otherwise
it will be cumbersome to type in the parameter value

I will take care of moving the logic from Julie's plugin into
processing, and then work on the UI. Shouldn't take long, and I think
this will be a nice improvement

Let me know if you have more ideas

You can digitize other types. Say that you add a new point layer, you
can digitize points, lines and areas, but QGIS layer (in non editing
mode) can only display points. Once you close editing, other types
should appear in browser and you can add them to canvas. So you can
digitize (almost) everything at once, but QGIS lets you visualize only
one layer/geometry type when the layer is not edited.

Yes, all primitives are represented as features (that is the only way
to talk with QGIS). Boundaries usually do not have attributes but may
have. For example, if a road runs around a forest, you can use the
boundary of the forest to form forest area and represent the road at
the same time. In such case, the road will have probably different
attribute fields. Currently only one layer of the same map can be
edited at time. Multi layer vectors are not yet perfectly supported
however.

I see the problem with field calculator.

The information is in topo_symbol field. I could set values of that
field to get visually the same as what is now in GRASS. I just don't
believe that it is better.

Do you mean drop fields (as is now but in debate) or keep first value 
(as it used to be before)?

How would you enter the value? I could imagine a LineEdit where you 
input e.g. a comma-separated list of fields to keep and another one 
where you input a comma-separated list of the stats to apply? To apply 
several stats on one field you would need multiple entries in LineEdit1?

Would be nice to have. On the other hand there is a work-around by first 
applying "Statistics by categories" and then "Join attributes table". 
Would work on one field only because we lack an algorithm to rename or 
drop fields, if I am not misstaken.

Make the algorithm behave like the one from the mentioned plugin

At first, on a line edit, with a string like
"[field_to_keep],[stat_to_apply], [field_to_keep],[stat_to_apply,
[field_to_keep],[stat_to_apply]..."

Not very intuitive if it's not documented, but will do until the UI is ready

Very good analysis of the problem, thanks. 3D editing was broken,
fixed in 295d64b.
Now it is also possible to edit z coordinates in vertex editor.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with empty Postgis views
Message-ID: <3114a53c0e9b103fd66bff0f52257b4f@carto.net>

 

Hi, 

I have QGIS projects that load Postgis views that are sometimes empty,
sometimes contain data. 

I noticed that current master cannot load empty Postgis views anymore.
The error message is that "PostgreSQL layer has no primary key". Note
that I did select a primary key manually. 

Same issue if you load the view using "Add Postgis layer" or if you load
an existing project that has a reference to the empty Postgis view. I
checked the <datasource/> in the .qgs file and the primary key is
present in the datasource element. 

So, there seems to be an issue that current master cannot load empty
Postgis views. It is a regression, as this used to work in previous
versions. 

Note that the reason why my view is sometimes empty is that it contains
objects filtered by status "projected" - there can be dates when there
are no elements with such a status. 

I hope this can be fixed before we ship QGIS 2.12. 

Opened as bug issue http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13638  

Thanks, 

Andreas

I guess the right ticket is now this one

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13209

right? Too bad there was no feedback, does this probably mean that we
will have again a release with wrong area measures? I have put quite a
lot of effort in testing this issue, see for example
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12057, but now I'm out of time. Shouldn't
the reference ticket be tagged as blocker (I mean, we should not
really ship the new release with this issue unresolved...).

cheers!

The thing is, I'm not convinced the area is wrong... it's just that
QGIS' handling of units with OTF on/off ellipsoid ON/OFF is extremely
confusing (ie, I don't even fully understand it). That's what I was
hoping to get to the bottom of with this question... but we're out of
time for this, I'm too cautious to make large changes which would be
required to change this behaviour this late in the cycle.

Hi,
I agree with Giovanni. Please clarify this issue before release. I got
numerous complaints from users when this happened the last time.

My understanding, at least until http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12057 , is
that the confusing bit is that sometimes areas measured on an
ellipsoid are smaller than the same ones measured on a plane, this
because not all projections are conservative for areas. Differences
are relatively small, of course if the area measured with OTF on
differs of several magnitudes then there is probably something wrong
(but do not seems the case anymore).

There is also the issue with measurements being always in m for
projections in feet, this I can confirm after testing quickly (on
master) the dataset of http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13209 (but
transforming the result from square meters to acres give the right
results).

cheers!

Yep, but that's expected/correct behaviour. Ellipsoidal area WILL differ
from planar area and will differ between ellipsoids. So no issue there.

Right, so that's more of a feature request/ui clarification. We need a way
of notifying users what units the area will be in and also allow them to
override this.

I think removing the broken canvas units from project properties is a
start, and maybe switching that to a selector for areal/distance unit
calculations. Can't be solved for 2.12 though.

Hi  all,
clipping a large raster image (1.3Gb) I tried to use "-co 
COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co PREDICTOR=2" but the output grew till getting an 
error (ERROR 1: TIFFAppendToStrip:Maximum TIFF file size exceeded. Use 
BIGTIFF=YES creation option. ERROR 1: WriteEncodedTile/Strip() failed. ) 
because it was trying to create a >4Gb file.

Am I the only one? Any idea?

Working with osgeo QGIS 2.10.1 64bit on Win7.

All the best,

What should compute this operator?

I suspect its the number of different values that the attribute takes.
So if all the chosen attribute values are "42", the variety is 1. If
all the attributes are "42" except for one which is "leopard" and one
which is "slartibartfast" then the variety is 3.

I've got this from playing with selections from a small data set, but
I expect the source will agree with me!

Ah yes, all the statistical summaries are computed here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2aa2040e77b1682f00b4e00a4f19c8ff268e9499/src/core/qgsstatisticalsummary.cpp

and there its defined as the number of items in the thing that is
storing the item values:

case Variety:
  return mValueCount.count();

Make this change before compiling is very simple to me, but may this become
a problem when packages for version 2.12 will be released? Or will depend
on who build these binaries, that needs to make sure QGIS and GRASS are
compiled with same off_t size?


Thanks Radim,

I've done some more testing, using valgrind and massif. Here's what I've found:

- there's a big leak coming from Qt's font database. Fixed in Qt 5.1
(https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-26861). About 50% of the memory
leaked is caused by this one. We could possibly work around it by
having a singleton so we only ever use one QFontDatabase in QGIS, or
just get on with the move to Qt5 and get the proper fix for free. ;)
- I also see a lot of memory used by Python objects. Specifically, a
lot coming from QgsPythonUtilsImpl::evalString and the PyRun_String
call in that function. I don't think these are leaks though (at least,
not within QGIS). But that's the second largest memory allocator I see
reported by massif
- There was a small leak of a GEOS object in labeling... don't think
this would cause too much memory usage though. I'll submit a fix after
giving it some more testing.
- Lastly, the remaining large chunk of allocated memory is used by the
images stored during rendering. I'm 90% sure these are all properly
cleaned, but I still can't throw the niggling suspicion that just
maybe there's some special condition in which these images aren't
properly deleted.

So yeah... no magic fixes to this one unfortunately. (At least, not
until QGIS 3.0!)

Nyall,

Great initiative! The sooner a plan can be agreed upon, the better.

Coincidentally to your QEP proposal, I came up with an alternative timeline
idea over the last few days that would avoid skipping a release cycle but
still give us enough time to complete the port to Qt5.

Basically, we begin the development cycle of both 2.14 LTR _as well as_ 3.0
at the same time, following the public release of 2.12. The simultaneous
overlapping development of those two versions (for the first four months)
would have two distinct objectives and release dates:
- for 2.14 LTR, the development cycle would last 4 months and would be
released, as planned, on 26.02.2016 with a focus on stability and bugfix
based on the feedback from users on 2.12 (small-ish new features could be
pushed too)
- for 3.0, the development cycle would last 8 months, with the first four
months overlapping with the development of 2.14 LTR, and be released on
26.06.2016 (as our 4-month release cycle would have it following the
release of 2.14 LTR) with a focus on porting QGIS to Qt5 and python 3 as
well as significant new features.

This alternate timeline proposal both speeds up the delivery of QGIS 3.0 as
well as insuring QGIS 2.14 LTR is shipped with a focus on stability as devs
can push new features onto QGIS 3.0.

Thoughts?

Sounds reasonable. I think we should have an explicit strategy for
plugins: in case an important (e.g. > 10.000 downloads?) plugin is not
migrated by the original author, should we drop it, of upgrade it with a
direct investment by the project?
All the best.

That's a lot of plugins - over 150, minus a handful of deprecated ones.

Yes, that's why I'm worried.
Many authors will fix them, but I'm not convinced all of them will. I fear many users will stick to older qgis versions because of that.
All the best.

I suspect we don't really have any options.  It has to happen at some point
and it's better to at least have a plan then just drop the bomb and hope it
all works out.

I think something that might be good is if we can get PyQt5 setup for QGIS
we can access how much effort it's going to be and work though one plugin
as team to learn all the traps before scaring anyone with the details.

If you need a guinea pig, I am definitely volunteering for this and to
start porting Processing ASAP.

As you might have realized,  Alex and I haven't had too much time
lately to work on Processing, so we are very low on people for any
Processing-related task. In these circumstances, adapting Processing
might take a looong time (unless someone else jumps in, which woudl be
awesome...), so the sooner we start, the better. Otherwise, the first
3.0 might go out without Processing, or with a very flaky version...
Hopefully Matthias will be able to have the test suite ready when this
happens, and that will ensure the stability of the new version.

You are using 32bits version
grass7-dev_7.0.2RC1-1~ubuntu14.04.1_i386.deb from
https://launchpad.net/~grass/+archive/ubuntu/grass-stable, right? It
is compiled with LFS, which adds -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 compiler flags. Try to add -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 to QGIS cmake CXX_EXTRA_FLAGS  instead of
manually changing grass_off_t.

How about a qgis-plugins mailing list? I don't get great responses to PyQGIS
questions on Stack Exchange, and this dev list should really be for core
development. I certainly don't feel completely comfortable asking plugin
questions here. A dedicated list would be the place for info and support on
3.0 migration, and would hopefully have a useful ongoing life.

I have an Python action using a REST service to get picture. The picture is

Dialog:

WFS layer action code:

from PyQt4.QtCore import Qt

url = r'[% "cyklogram" %]'
data = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
img.loadFromData(data)
lbl.setPixmap(QtGui.QPixmap(img).scaled(650,250,Qt.KeepAspectRatio))
lbl.show()

Actually... Scratch that. Just found some huge leaks in certain

Hi all,
apparently the good old Statist plugin requires a new lib:
cannot import name NavigationToolbar2QTAgg
Anyone confirms?

NavigationToolbar2QTAgg is a module from matplotlib (to draw graph).
This module is used by Statist for a long time.
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/statist/

Do you still have the matplotlib package ?

This could be a good idea. I noticed that many plugins developers are
not on qgis-dev ML, so they are difficult to reach. We might even set
the subscription to a qgis-plugins-announce ML as a requirement for
plugin publishing.
All the best.

The potential downside is fragmentation of the users across too many lists -
specifically, would we lose some subscribers to the dev list? Anyway, I'm in
no position to judge that. I know I would find a plugin list useful, if
others used it, and it would be useful for the 3.0 migration.

In my case ( GEarthView QGIS plugin )  I have  two external libraries:

twisted
zope


that I need to install manually  :(

On windows,  they need to be copied for each new version of QGIS, inside
the folder:

QGIS VERSION\apps\Python27\Lib\site-packages\


Instead, on MacOSX, they are  (once and for all) inside the standard
python  library folder, as I explained in my blog:

http://exporttocanoma.blogspot.it/2015/01/gearthview-20-plugin-per-qgis.html


I have tried several times to make sure that it was not necessary to
install anything, including the libraries in my plugins, so far I have not
succeeded.   So, that your message has rekindled my hopes  :)    but there
are some things I do not understand, in your explanation  (my fault).

Here are my steps:

1) I modified my  geodrinx/__init__.py      adding:

site.addsitedir(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__) + '/ext-libs'))

Question:  where need I to create this  ext-libs   folder ?    I looked
into the plugin that you indicate, but I found no "ext-libs" folder.

Could you please explain me (us)  better ?


Thank you much

A presto

I like the idea of 8 months of work for a 3.0 release, with 4 months
concurrent with the 2.14 dev cycle. Although, I think the last thing we
need during the 3.0 porting process is to be bogged down with new bugs and
regressions introduced by 'significant new features.'

If 3.0 is the first to introduce Qt5/Py3, and we have 8 months of work, I
think the initial focus should be merely to do porting, and do it well,
rather than fragment development with yet more features and end up with a
half-baked Qt5/Py3 porting. However, with 8 months of work, it may be
reasonable to reassess the situation after 4 months of porting effort.

In other words, an approach might be that for the first 4 months ONLY
porting and bug fixing can be done to the 3.0 branch, with no new features.
Then, alongside the 2.14 LTR, we could do a 3.0 beta release for
third-party plugin devs and interested power users, educators and sys
admins to work with. After which, we can open up the 3.0 branch for new
feature development.

Such an approach would have the following effects:

* Developers would be hesitant to add significant new features to the 2.14
if they could not readily port the feature to 3.0. (This keeps everyone
focused on porting efforts for 3.0, and avoids regressions for 2.14.)

* The 2.14 LTR dev cycle will have limited feature development, allowing
for increased focus on stability bug fixes. This is critical if the 2.14
LTR might be a version many users stick with due to plugin compatibility
issues. We don't want the last 2.x release to have new bugs/regressions if
many devs will be dropping work on it to focus on 3.0.

* After the 2.14 LTR is released, new features go into 3.0, and minimal
backporting of fixes would be required for the LTR, because 2.14
development should not have significantly increased bugs and regressions
with its limited new feature development.

The most important thing would probably be to have a working
implementation for

* PyQt5
* Python3

If it is possible to merge support for this in the current codebase -
just like it's currently possible with Qt5 - we can start to collect
experiences. I assume a week or two should be sufficient to get this
into shape. Doing as much work as possible on a single codebase will
have the advantage of minimal fragmentation.

I would propose that somebody is assinged to this job very soon.
This will be required anyway sooner or later and if we do it now, we
have a solid knowledge about what expects us while at the moment there
is a lot of speculation and uncertainty.

Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problem with GRASS 7 when creation a new mapset
Message-ID: <5627A972.5070805@gmail.com>

Hi all,
I hope that this problem is not already been discussed..
I'm trying to test the GRASS 7 plugin but I get always the same error
during the creation of the new mapset:


* in the wizard, after the CRS options I get:

Regions file (/home/ma7730/lavori/QGIS/QGIS-Master/grass/locations.gml)
not found.

and that's right. Actually the file is here:

/home/ma7730/lavori/QGIS/QGIS-Master/src/plugins/grass/locations.gml

* so the new mapset is created, I can also create the new location but
then I get this error:

New mapset successfully created, but cannot be opened: Mapset lock
failed (exitStatus=0, exitCode=127, errorCode=5, error=Unknown error
stdout=, stderr=/usr/lib/grass70/etc/lock: error while loading shared
libraries: libgrass_gis.7.0.1.so: cannot open shared object file: No
such file or directory
)


Don't know what am I missing. However I work with the master version of
QGIS compile on a debian testing machine.

Thanks to all!

Cheers

Matteo

Exactly.

With this flags it also works without problems!

Thanks Radim!

Hi all,

I'm looking to create some colour-ramps in the qml format for
use in QGis, but I'm having some trouble finding a decent
description of the format.

Would anyone know of links to such?

Thanks in advance!

Hi again Radim,

I was looking at typemask Option tag, and his definition says "for vector
input option defines allowed types. Only the layers of one of defined type
are displayed in input", but at this moment, all types are displayed in the
input dropdown list. Is this intended, or is just a side effect of show all
layers of the mapset in dropdown?

Another question, I would like to include v.to.3d in QGIS-GRASS. To do
that, I separated it in three different modules: v.to.3d.fixed (fixed
height for 3D vector features), v.to.3d.attr (attribute column used for
height) and v.to.2d (reverse transformation). Do you think this can be
merged now, during feature freeze, since it is nothing that can corrupt
anything, or should I make a pull request now and you check and merge after
the end of feature freeze?

Thanks!
Pedro

MMm... I disagree here. Some features REQUIRE an API break, so this
would be our only chance to do this within the next ~3-4 years. I
don't think we should restrict this.

Fair enough, I'll concede that point.


Why not:

- branch off master after 2.12 to 2.14. 2.14 becomes an LTR candidate
- ONLY bug fixes allowed to be pushed to that branch, no new features.
This means 2.14 will effectively have a whole release cycle of bug
fixes only, hopefully resulting in the "best most stablest QGIS
release EVA!" (or something). This would benefit all the users who
will be forced to stay on 2.14 for the foreseeable future due to
plugins/other reasons they can't move to 3.0.

- development continues on master for what will become 3.0. Initial
focus is on removing deprecated methods and classes and porting to Qt5
& python 3.0 quickly. Possibly QGIS organisation could sponsor a dev
to look into this (*cough* Matthias *cough*) so that we can make the
transition rapidly and then plugin devs have the largest time
available to port before release. (Of course, API will still change
throughout the 2.999/pre 3.0 development cycle, so it must be
understood that porting will be a ongoing process while the API is
fluid). After we switch to Qt5/Python 3.0, development opens up to new
features.

- QGIS 3.0 is released instead of 2.16, 8 months from now.

I meant specifically during the porting process. Then, break the API and
add new features. For example, some plugin devs might need to fix up their
plugins for all three: Qt5, Py3 and API. If we do all three and introduce
new features, during the porting process, it might be total chaos for them.

If during the 8-month 3.0 dev cycle we:
* port to Qt5/Py3 (however long that takes), then release a public beta
* continue with removing deprecated items, API break and new features

this will allow plugin devs to use the beta to port their plugins to
Qt5/Py3, without worrying about missing deprecated APIs and new API changes
at the same time. They can use nightlies from then on to keep up with any
API changes and port their plugins accordingly. Might be good after the
beta release to have periodic public announcements about what in the API
has changed.

This would isolate the later API changes/breaks, which could be very
difficult to fix for some plugins, from the more straightforward task of
porting to Qt5/Py3.

Is this a reasonable approach, or is it not worth trying to maintain the
current API while porting to Qt5?

Only allowing bug fixes starting next week, without any notification of
such a change in plan to the public, might be bad form. There may be
features that, while not new, might need more work. An example I am
familiar with: it would be good to integrate the new auth system with more
connections.

Such 'features' might need some type of moderator. Could have all 'possibly
a new feature' commits to the 2.14 LTR be required via PR?

Try with latest master. It's made a huge difference for me. Exporting my
most complex atlas (300 pages, with shapeburst, layer effects, some pretty
hefty dynamic labeling):

Initially memory usage is about 320mb.
2.8: memory usage grows to 1.5 gb
2.10: memory usage to about 2 gb
Master: memory usage grows to 480 mb

Win! I suspect Qt5 will make another big difference too.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] encoding in custom python functions
Message-ID: <CAKWoFMJvcxwu7XLOUrJhjbFDPmayqLcma=Z-sB0JEYA_hG4fnQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to figure out some encoding problems when using custom python
expression functions.

I'm using python functions for defining some label texts. I need use some
special characters like ä and ö.

When a new file is created in function editor the file is encoded in my
system encoding cp1252. At least the ä is coded to 0xe4 if I check that
with hex-editor.
Let the custom function just be
@qgsfunction(args='auto', group='Custom')
def encodingtest(feature, parent):
return 'ä'

This displays on a map like 'Ã¤'
It seems that the file is converted to utf-8 before execution and the ä is
then coded to 0xc3 0xa4. Now QGIS still tries to interpret this as cp1252
and then displays this as 'Ã¤'.

It doesn't help to define the ä as unicode like u'ä' because QGIS still
sees the ä as 0xc3 0xa4 and think that it is in cp1252.

The only way to resolve this in the code at least that I have found is to
use
return 'ä'.decode('utf-8')
This works on QGIS but the file can't be executed elsewhere (IDE) since the
file is truly in cp1252 and 0xe4 can't be decoded using utf-8.


Does anyone else confirm this and have I understood right the problem?
Should I file a bug report?


Thanks,

-Lauri

I like it. We'll probably need to be a bit flexible with your last
note and not worry too much about strictly maintaining the api during
the Qt5 port (given that it'll break anyway, it seems a bit silly to
have to code workarounds to temporarly maintain API). But generally,
I'm in favour.

Do you (or someone else?) mind submitting a similar QEP with this
proposed schedule. and then we can send both alternative approaches to
the PSC to decide between?

Also should have said that the sooner we get this locked in the
better... if master is about to unfreeze it'd be better if the
approach for 2.14 was already decided on.

Hi all,
with current master from yesterday, the command returns always line

confirms?

I added check for _FILE_OFFSET_BITS in Make/Platform.h, now it should
compile correctly without manually setting CXX_EXTRA_FLAGS. Configure
should print:

Hi Paolo,

Just tested "Vector grid" and "Create grid" from master,
all seems to works as expected.

Thanks. Tested on more machines, some work, some not.
Trying to understand the reasons.

Yes, it is now intended for two reasons. First, it could be confusing
for user if some maps were missing from input list. Second is
technical, to get list of layers in vector map may be time consuming,
the info must be read from the map (which was not the case with < 2.11
where only layers in canvas were listed).

All vector maps are listed in map input widget, but only the types
specified by typemask will be offered for selection (if there are more
than one) under the input widget. If selected vector does not contain
any layer of specified type, a warning dialog opens when module is
run.

In general it is new feature, but in this little amount, I think that
it can be accepted, it cannot break anything, if default.qgm is a
valid xml. In any case, test well before you create pull request and
after it gets merged.

And I run a relatively recent build of QGIS binaries, from master

Hi,


I need to rename legend items using the qGIS API for python.
The legend items are related to a raster layer displayed in pseudocolor. Is
there any way to set a label for each value of the legend using the API?

Best Regards.

Message-ID: <CAM+zXj39nOE+a_u24eaXj_chd6gNdN9oexkqfHFsTm0NWEu1Qg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Developers,

I'm writing on behalf of my employer, a company that has mixed,
proprietary and open source (especially QGIS of course) gis
infrastructure, with qgis being adopted each day a little more.
Actually in our migration path we have found a road blocker: the very
bad performances (and sometimes results) of most of geoprocessing
tools in the vector menu. Yes I know that there are alternatives in
the Processing toolbox, but that is not an option for most of our very
basic users: they need to do simple operations (clips, unions,
intersections, etc.) with usually very large/detailed vectors (usually
shapefiles). In this scenario QGIS usually chokes or is at best very
slow (compared to other gis packages, the ones we are trying to get
rid of).

What can be done to improve this tools? Rewriting the tools to improve
efficiency and accuracy?

We available some funds: this is the first time I convince people
above me to put some money in QGIS development, and a decision would
need to me made until the end of November tops, otherwise money will
be used otherwise.

Please leave advice and feedback.


Regards
João Gaspar

Hi,
I'm not a developer, but a simple user following this list.

My point of view is, that the ftools are just a relict from the past since  
the processing toolbox was introduced.
I'm glad that people step up for funding QGIS, but in this particular  
case, you would better invest your money and time in lifting your "basic"  
users to a little more advanced users and show them how to use the  
processing toolbox properly.

As far as I know, the toolbox is nearly feature complete with the ftools  
functions, and most of them are so much faster and/or versatile, that I  
did not touch the ftools for ages.
Prepare some centrally stored models for reoccuring use cases, and have  
happy users ;)

Just my two cents
Bernd

Hi Alexandre,

The u'ä' works if I tell the file encoding using your snippet
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

But this works only in qgis and is not a correct way.
I cannot then debug my function in any IDE cause the file is encoded
differently than it says.

Hi João,

Nice that there is interest in improving the analysis part of QGIS.

There was recently a similar discussion with Bernhard Ströbl who also
put some effort into improving the dissolve tool (although it turned out
to be complex and will probably only be merged in 2.14).

In the discussion there, the need for coexistence of these two suits
offering the same tools was questioned. In particular, maintaining twice
the same tool in QGIS is an extra effort in maintenance and there is no
advantage visible.

It would be nice to plan how to resolv this situation, in particular
could you answer the following questions:

 * Why is the processing toolbox not an option for your users? (Do you
require shortcuts (menu entries) to the tools? Is it the parameter
interface which is more fine-tuned? Missing functionality?)
 * Are the processing toolbox tools enough performant for your needs? If
not, which ones require attention? It would be good to have a list.

If the first one is a problem, I think it would be an approach to let
system administrators define "favorite algorithms" (or similar) which
would then be offered as a shortcut in the menu.

If the second one applies, then we already have proven the point that
maintaining the same algorithm twice is silly and the effort should
rather be put into unifying these tools instead of rewriting duplicate
code. I will probably soon be working on a test suite for processing
which should ensure long-term quality assurance for the algorithms
there. Another advantage of consolidating the two code bases.

I hope that it's possible for your company to consider different
approaches for this problem to get to a long-term enhancement.

Best regards,
Matthias

Ah... I think I now understand what you are saying. You are saying that
expression files are always saved in your system default encoding system.

Sorry for the noise.

The GRASS modules cannot find GRASS libs, must be added to
LD_LIBRARY_PATH before qgis is started.

Message-ID: <CACfnYnSrAeB-EpbEp_ZSsAqu=D80re+fpPnu73czvtqve9+u8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Matthias,

the issues are the following:


there is whole universe of very basic users that need to do classic
geoprocessing operations (clips, unions, etc.) sometimes also with
large/dense geometries, possibly with geometry errors. This users are
usually not able to handle (or willingly to) the possible problems of
using a toolbox based on other software. For them the qgis
geoprocessing tools would be enough (now, as a separet menu as now or
only in processing this is not an issue).

problem is that when using large/dense inputs this qgis tools are
usually very slow, especially when compared to the proprietary
software many are trying to leave. In other worst cases the results
are wrong, but not in a way that is openly wrong, making the usability
of such tools even more difficult.

so said that I understand perfectly what João says, and I would say
that is time to the action, especially considering that there is an
offer on the table.

cheers

If what you need is to have the tools in a menu, we have been
discussing that before, and the idea is to mantain the same menu
structure if the users wants that, but have the algorithms based on
Processing to avoid redundant (and more difficult to mantain) code. As
I said, this has already been discussed, but it is not yet
implemented. Maybe your funding could help us do it?

And if algorithms are not performant enough, it's clearly better to
put your effort in the Processing ones (which, in general, are just a
copy of the ftools ones), and have them exposed through the menus, as
explained above.

If we'd replace the ftools (vector and raster menu) through processing. 
What would replace them? Would we do research and see which of the 
alternative processing providers provides best speed/reliability - if 
there are multiple versions? It may be, that for Algorithm A, Saga works 
best, whereas for algorithm B GRASS is better and for C GDAL or the QGIS 
builtin in mechanism.

QGIS 3.0 seems to be a good moment/opportunity to terminate ftools and
replace the menu items to be shortcuts to processing algorithms.

yes.. I run QGIS from build
(/home/ma7730/lavori/QGIS/QGIS-Master/buildM/output)

in the bash script I use to launch QGIS, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is already
specified:


#!/bin/bash
export
QGIS_INSTALL_PREFIX="/home/ma7730/lavori/QGIS/QGIS-Master/buildM/output"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$QGIS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib
export PYTHONPATH=$QGIS_INSTALL_PREFIX/python/qgis
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/$USER/.qgis2/python/plugins
export QGIS_DEBUG=3
#export QGIS_LOG_FILE=./qgis.log

$QGIS_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin/qgis $@


isn't this enough? Should I specify a different path for GRASS?

Thanks!

IMHO all ftools should be replaced by native QGIS processing algorithms. 
For "simple" users it may be not feasible (or not allowed) to install 
additional software. Therefore native QGIS algorithms should be improved 
to be fast, robust and offering choices the users need (see recent 
discussion on dissolve)

There are a number of internal algorithms available in processing (i.e.
no external dependencies).
Unfortunately they are duplicates of ftools algorithms. But they have
the advantage that they can be used in models.
So if something is going to be improved it should be those - or we end
up with a situation where we have fast algorithms in the menus but the
same algorithm slower in the toolbox.

Therefore the plan of action should be:

 * Create menu entries for often used (internal) processing algorithms
 * Remove ftools algorithms
 * Identify slow algorithms
 * Improve performance

This will solve João's problems in the most sustainable and effective
way possible.

Some time ago Carson ported at least some fTools
algorithms to QGIS analysis library. Maybe we can
revise this code, update it and then reuse in Processing
and 3rd party plugins?

Core implementation should be faster than Python code,
also maybe we can adopt multithreading approach for
some alforothms.

Yep. I think the user-friendliness of ftools are that a/ algorithms are
offered in a simple and accessible menu items, and b/ the menu item icons
_greatly_ ease the understanding of what algorithms do.

Both can be added to processing.

Bernhard,

I agree that these tools should be QGIS algorithms - maybe even ported 
from another GIS (if feasible).

One major annoyance with fTools and some processing algorithms is that 
reliance on ESRI shapefile as output. That way I always loose my columns 
- or they are truncated to be meaningless. For that reason I often don't 
use QGIS, but FME for analysis. Or try to do the processing with SQL in 
Postgis.

If we renovate these algorithms in the vector menu we'd have to make 
sure that the output could be any chosen vector format, or at least 
supports geopackage/spatialite/postgres as output.

Icon support is already in Processing. The first versions actually
used the same ftools icons, but I removed that because there were new
algorithms being added, and it was quite messy to see some algorithms
with icons and others with the default icon. Instead, I started using
the same icon for all algorithms for a given provider, for the sake of
homogeneity.

However, the mechanism that I implemented for putting processing
algorithms in a menu allows to set an icon, so the current ftools menu
can be perfectly replicated, including icons

I copy here an example that  I added in another thread, about how to
replicate the Raster/Conversion  menu from Processing


import os
from GdalTools import GdalTools
from processing.gui.utils import addAlgorithmEntry
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

def addRasterAlgorithm(name, group, iconName):
    icon = QIcon(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(GdalTools.__file__),
"icons", iconName + ".png"))
    addAlgorithmEntry(name, "Raster", group, icon = icon)

addRasterAlgorithm("gdalogr:rasterize", "Conversion", "rasterize")
addRasterAlgorithm("gdalogr:translate", "Conversion", "translate")
addRasterAlgorithm("gdalogr:pcttorgb", "Conversion", "24-to-8-bits")
addRasterAlgorithm("gdalogr:rgbtopct", "Conversion", "8-to-24-bits")
addRasterAlgorithm("gdalogr:polygonize", "Conversion", "polygonize")

The addAlgorithmEntry is a part of Processing since quite a few
commits ago, and it allows to put an algorithm "outside" of the
toolbox, in a menu entry.

So the code is basically there, it is just a matter of finding out
which algorithms are missing and deciding where to call this methods
from. Then I guess we could use that funding to improve algorithms and
make them more robust and fast


Cheers

SAGA algorithms are pretty fast, and we wont probably get that
performance unless we move the logic of algorithms to the C++ core (as
Alex suggested). However, I wouldn't put the SAGA algorithm to replace
the ftools menu, for the reason that you mentioned: SAGA only handles
shapefiles. I think that it would be better to get a good performance
(even if it is not that good when compared to GRASS or SAGA), but have
the support for all formats. Processing will give you that support,
converting files as needed, but in the end, it has to pass through a
shapefile, and we have the problem with field names...

Hi Andreas,

AFAIK processing uses shp for in between results in a model, too. So if 
you build a model you loose your fields, no matter which output format 
you choose. IMHO it should therefore be considered to change 
processing's data source. Maybe SpatialLite is an option? Users can 
still export to shp if needed.

shp is the default format for temp files, and as such it is used in
the modeler for intermediate results. That is, however, very easy to
change, so if we agree on any other format, it can be changed and set
as the default for Processing

What what be a suitable format? It should
1) support all geometry types needed
2) be fast
3) support spatial indices?
4) support long (unlimited) field names
5) support all necessary field types
6) store its data on local hd

anything else?

the main issue here is not if leave th vector menu or not, i think we
all agree we should get rid of it and have all the tools in
processing.

The issue here is about the lousy performances (and even wrong
results) of the native qgis vector geoprocessing tools. I think we all
agree that qgis should have a few (at least the most commonly used)
ones, without depending on any 3rd party software.

cheers!

I fully agree on that

Do we have any benchmark or list of those algorithms with very bad
performance or that give wrong results? I don't think that all of them
behave so badly, so it would be good to have more detail about where
we should be focusing our efforts in this

+1000 Yes, please, get rid of this pain in the a.. as soon as possible and  
use SpatiaLite e.g..
Creating these files might take considerably longer and they consume more  
space, but compared to the time I spend refactoring column names all the  
time and finding workarounds, this is nothing.
It's also one of the reasons why I do my heavy lifting work in R nowadays.

Here you add only path to QGIS libs, if path to GRASS libs is not
already in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, you must add it also.

great, so I would suggest try underestand why the tools here

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/fTools/tools/doGeoprocessing.py

are so bad with such "problematic" datasets (that I can easily
provide). If is possible to do something
then take João company offer use it to improve the situation, then we
can decide with calm were to put the
shortcuts :)

cheers!

Giovanni,

Would (some of) these datasets be suitable to include in unit tests for
processing?
It would be very interesting to have these available for this purpose.

Hmm. You mean put in a QEP tomorrow, and ask the PSC to vote on that early
next week? I would think at least a week of dev community comments on such
a QEP would be warranted, given the very large scope.

Maybe ask Jürgen and PSC for one extra week of feature freeze on master
branch while this is decided?

I've tested in several ways, and I think it works:

Hi people,

the new version was just branched off, the new tar ball[1] was made and
packaging can begin and the feature freeze on master is now over.

The new version will be announced once packages for some platforms are
available.

Hi victor,

Because codes are sometimes better than text, I made a pull-request to 
propose optional parameters in script and model.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2396

In my code, all parameters can be optional or not required and didn't 
modify the parameters value setter.

I don't know if optional number, string or extent has to be None or 
default value if it is not set by the user.

Reviews are welcome

Regards,
René-Luc

Subject: [Qgis-developer] r.to.vect issues
Message-ID: <562A7A47.9090300@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
The module is giving me trouble:
* when used in the grass plugin, I get

r.to.vect input=asp_recl at a_user output=asp_recl type=area -s
Estrazione delle aree in corso ...
Module crashed or killed

* when used through Processing, the resulting polygonms have plenty of
topology errors (double vertices).

Anyone confirms?

Current master, G7 on Debian sid.

All the best.

I like Larry's idea of focusing on the porting effort to smooth the
transition.

That's an important decision. So probably it will require a little bit
more discussions before deciding, including feedback from users and funders.

But it does not prevent from starting important work, as proposed by
Matthias on the PyQT5 + Python3 porting side, this kind of work won't be
lost anyway.

Essentially the same - but with the benefit for me that the nightlies and

dependencies in place (ie. Qt5, PyQt5, Python3 in OSGeo4W).

Sorry Jürgen, when I was thinking more about this I realised I also
should have also included you in the potential list of devs who
could/should be funded by QGIS org to complete this work. I realise
that this is a considerable task to get all the dependencies ready
too! Apologies for that, and no slight was intended by not mentioning
this earlier.

My concern with this approach would be that we'd need to make sure
it's known that major changes aren't acceptable for 2.14. If 2.14 was
branched off from master early then this would be immediately evident,
but if not then we need to make it well known to devs that the usual
rules don't apply during the 2.14 cycle...

Also in the ideal world we'd have the Qt5/python 3 test builds
available asap so that people can start testing/porting plugins. But
understandably this isn't an easy task.

Otherwise, I'd also be happy with this approach.

Nyall

As Jürgen said, it's essentially the same. Yet... :)

I also think branching off 2.14 LTR now is slightly preferable. On a
psychological level, as the heavy development of new features has in the
past mostly taken place on the master branch, it'd make it clearer to devs
that the heavy feature development takes place there, and not on the 2.14
LTR branch.

Alternatively, we could branch off 2.14 LTR very early on,  like in a
month's time. That would give a preparatory period for new packages for
osgeo4w etc.

Hi,

I'm not sure how others feel about it, but I was thinking maybe we should
remove or refine the count down to release on the website.  Having people
hanging off the release count down is IMO a bit annoying as it means people
expect it right on that day.

Personally I think a date range would be fine or something like that but a
exact minute count down doesn't feel right to me.

Case in point:

Hi,

+1

I was always annoyed about that.

I also don't like people announcing the QGIS release on Twitter when in 
fact it isn't ready for the average user. Also - visual changelog not 
finished, etc.

It would be good to only announce the QGIS release when it is really 
available. Otherwise we are false raising expectations.

Maybe this could be integrated into plugins.qgis.org.
elpaso, how do you feel about that? Implementing a way to send
anuoncement to all plugin authors and maintainers should be easy, having
an automatic subscription to a mailing list is probably more complex,
and not everybody could be happy about this.
Thoughts?
All the best.

I think this is problematic, as it would mean no new stuff for about one
year, something unacceptable for many of our customers.
rememebr that from our poll the need for additional functions emerged
quite clearly, and (at least to me) unexpectedly.

BTW, it would be good if it would be possible to install qgis3-dev along
with qgis, also on Linux, with a proper non conflicting package, so more
people could keep on testing not disrupting production environment.
This will involve also creating a .qgis3 conf, I suppose.
All the best.

+1. I've told the developer of a plugin we commissioned that 2.10 was out,
but his interpretation of the website was that it was not yet launched.

The plugin mailing list should be equivalent to this list and the users one.
Additional integration into the plugins site would be an extra, but not
required. 

I don't think that occasional emails to plugin devs via the emails
associated in the repo would be unreasonable. Perhaps three or four mailouts
starting when a Qt5/Py3 version is available, through till launch of 3.0.
One could then query the plugins repo db to retrieve all plugins compatible
< 3.0, and perhaps mail them once or twice after launch, pointing then
towards the mailing list. 

A definite no to automatically subscribing plugin devs to a mailing list, 
though. I don't think their submitting their email address to the plugins
repo reasonably indicates consent to that.

Hi Tom,

You probably mean 2.12 - 2.10 is four month old.

For me 2.12 is released - the release branch has been made and there is a new
tar ball of the released source code.  The feature freeze is over and
development can continue.

But that doesn't mean that packages are ready yet.  So while it might be nice
for the average user to know that that happenend, it has little practical
relevance until the packages are there.

The site now states that 2.12 is in packaging.  I'll announce the release once
(our) debian/ubuntu packages and windows packages are ready (and/or the visual
changelog is finished).

No, that's not correct. Current thinking is 2.14 on schedule with only
minor changes/bug fixes, then 3.0 with api break, etc & major new features
4 months later.

So at most 8 months wait for a major intrusive feature. I think that's
acceptable.

I believe people who pays for a feature now expects it to be delivered
in 4 months, not 8. Perhaps we should ask them how they feel about this.

What would then be the difference between 2.14 and a 2.12 LTR?

All the best.

Non intrusive new features are allowed, just no major changes (eg labeling
engine, expression contexts, geometry engine kinda stuff).

We do have to keep SOME say in the release plans/schedule... I don't think
we can satisfy everyone and even sponsors need to fit in with the bigger
picture.

I'm also sure there's a lot of commercial sponsors out there who would love
the idea of a go-slow leading up to the next LTR and final 2.0 series
release.

2.14LTR is what the roadmap says. 2.12LTR isn't.

BTW I don't think there's any need for a second alternative QEP. The plans
seem to be solidifying well and everyone seems to be satisfied with the
general direction this discussion is going. So I'll update my original QEP
to reflect this and then we can hopefully move it up to voting.

Like symbology-ng, multithreaded rendering and the new geometry classes?  I
think most major features have been developed in a separate branch and
then merged into master, when they reached a good enough state.

I think master should constantly be in a reasonably good state - which the
Qt5/PyQt5/Python3 branch will probably initially not be.   But hopefully after
four month of work it will - ready to me merged back into master.

And as for new features in 2.14 I'm not so sure either - new features don't
help with the porting.  And who adds features must be aware, that it also needs
to be mergable into the other branch or if that's not possible reimplemented
for it.  That should keep people from doing major stuff unless they really are
prepared to do it twice.

I'd say we should replace master with the other branch after 2.14 (like in [0]).

Can we not just develop in a separate branch, merge features back into
master whenever they are ready. Be it before or after release of 2.14 LTR.

I am afraid that working on two separate branches will effectively lead
to imporant work being done twice. Bugfixes forgotten to be ported...

Why not:

 * Branch off one py3/pyqt5 development branch now.
 * Introduce a compile time switch to control if python2 or python3 code
binaries should be compiled
 * Merge back into master
 * Release 2.14 (For which the release will happen with python2, pyqt4
but which supports python3 and pyqt5)
 * Drop deprecated stuff
 * Merge API breaking features targetted for QGIS 3.

Hi,
i think that 3.0 should Also be the occasion to reorganize plugins world. Not just upgrade them, it should be the time to say no to redundant plugins and find a way to somehow oblige developers to put their energy on a single plugin, instead of three almost identical with sometimes buggy features. It would a great step in consistency and coherence for users.

BTW I don't think there's any need for a second alternative QEP. The plans seem to be solidifying well and everyone seems to be satisfied with the general direction this discussion is going. So I'll update my original QEP to reflect this and then we can hopefully move it up to voting.

Paolo always does question new plugins if they duplicate. Is that not enough?
It's the reason my plugin was created. Our is there perhaps a historical
issue?

Sure, that's the risk.  I'm also not sure why we have make prediction what the
we'll find when porting to py3/pyqt5 and use those to make plans.

And when we have that, we actually know how large the impact of py3/pyqt5 is -
and can decide if it's better to merge the branch back to master before 2.14 or
after.  If it's feasible to have a version that supports py2/3, pyqt4/5 and
Qt4/5 it's before 2.14 and otherwise it's after.

Hi all,
in fact, Im' always gently pushing in that direction, with variable
success. Having a more ordered structure would be very useful, but I
doubt this can be implemented without threatening individual developer
freedom. Junior, do you have an operative proposal on how to implement this?
All the best.

OK, I see: disallowing major changes != allowing bugfix only.
I believe this can be acceptable for most, maybe all, users.
All the best, and thanks for your thoughts.

The ext-libs folder is not in the repo. It is populated by the paver
setup task. Once you run the task, the libraries will be installed in
there

Hope this helps

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing - SAGA algorithms saves raster data
	only in SDAT format
Message-ID: <CAMCJChvJKxv_Ks_jjJSnOS-aLfMa=QFH=uaeQXCAE=hSwxe6ug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

At this moment, when using SAGA algorithms in Processing, and saving raster
data to a file, the only format available (files of type) is the SDAT.
Nevertheless, after putting the name and doing "Save", it's possible to
change manually the extension and save in GeoTIFF for example. Is this
intentional?

Tested in QGIS 2.12 (compiled from source), xubuntu 14.04.

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

I know you do that, Paolo. And I understand that it works with Tom plugin,
right?

The thing is that, plugin dev that want his plugin to still be available
once we move to 3.0 will need to rework his plugin. Instead of letting each
one go its way, we can :

- based on the description and the tags, make a list of mergeable plugins
and let the dev know

- be more restrictive and reject new plugin that duplicates an already
approved one, unless he proves that it's better than the existing, in which
case he should have improved that one. I'm not a developer and I don't know
how they resist to rules/obligations... but we need rules to expect
consistency and coherence.

but I know that this can't be done by only Paolo and Alessandro (and I may
be available to help). This is also what a plugin dev list may be useful
for: discuss about plugins project as it's done for Core.

My thoughts about plugins are wider. I've read some remarks from people in
the survey and people complains about:

- the duplication of plugins

- no real way to know/understand in which menu the installed plugin is
(maybe, a reorganisation of menus should be done with 3.0)

- the bugs in the plugin, although QGIS project is not responsible of this
(except globe?). People should clearly know that not all plugins are done
by the QGIS project. This should be clearly added to the « Manage and
Install plugins » dialog , meaning that :

* the plugins that are Core should be clearly identified ; currently I'm
not sure they have real description and an author (I don't have QGIS right
now to check so sorry if that exists) ;

* also emphasize the individual authors but also the way people can report
issues. Instead of having on a single line links to homepage, bug tracker
and code repository we can have 3 lines with text like « homepage:», « have
issues or want new features, report it here : », « if you want to download
sources :». When you are not a programmer, the latter expressions are more
understandable than the former.

- the lack of documentation : Requesting from each plugin to have a minimal
documentation. Things are not so obvious for all of us. So, as soon as
there are options to choose from, there should be a text that explains the
choice. It can just be a dialog that pops up in QGIS but there should be
doc.Description is now mandatory and it's a good thing that helps to know
if a plugin can be useful or no but doc is needed once you begin to try it.

- the language: I know we can't have all plugins translated in all
languages but we may try to translate their description. Make translatable
the plugins.org site. I understood from Alesssandro that it will be a huge
project [0] but I still think that it will be a huge improvement for QGIS.
The translated descriptions will be retrieved in the « Manage and Install
plugins » and according to the level of translations, users can have
translated descriptions for all their plugins.


These are just points I put here. Thoughts?

Hi,
i think that 3.0 should Also be the occasion to reorganize plugins world. Not just upgrade them, it should be the time to say no to redundant plugins and find a way to somehow oblige developers to put their energy on a single plugin, instead of three almost identical with sometimes buggy features. It would a great step in consistency and coherence for users.

BTW I don't think there's any need for a second alternative QEP. The plans seem to be solidifying well and everyone seems to be satisfied with the general direction this discussion is going. So I'll update my original QEP to reflect this and then we can hopefully move it up to voting.

But keeping the possibility of merging the branch before 2.14 means the api
is locked... That's not ideal, it'll create a lot of (unneeded) extra work.
I'd say allow breaks in the branch, merge after 2.14.

Hi Nyall,

Well, if we explore if there is a smooth migration path to PyQt5 first, there
might be a way to have 2.14 also support Qt5 and PyQt5 - so we might be able to
have a 2.14 working on OSX with Qt5.  That's why we're in a hurry, right?  But
frankly OSX is not really a priority for me.

For Debian (not so sure about Ubuntu) and Windows the Qt switch is not that
pressing (IIRC last time we discussed that meant after 2.14 goes out of
maintaince - so no need to have both Qts, both pythons and both PyQts in
OSGeo4W).

Anyway, we can probably also use our findings in the new branch to update
master just in that direction before 2.14.

I'm writing a Processing script in pyqgis to simplify my workflow. One part
of the tool needs to run a simple SQL query to update a value in a table in
a PostGIS database. I've looked through the source code but don't see a
straightforward way to do this. Does anyone have tips?

Why does that mean that the API is locked?

Introduction of code to support python 3 and pyqt5 does not break
plugins if done right.

It only may break plugins if it's turned on. Therefore it's not the work
on this code that should be concerted but the deployment of binaries
with support for these features.

Of course we can develop it without breaking anything if done in a branch.
But having a plan around all this is the point of all this I think just so
we are all on the same page

Hi all,
the alg works well on Debian and Win, but fails on OSX:

Error executing algorithm Hypsometry local variable 'prjFile' referenced

Unfortunately I do not have a mac, so I cannot check further: could
anybody check?

All the best.

You are right, It shouldn't be like that

It is already fixed in master

Hi Victor,

Thank you very much!

Any chance of backport to 2.12? Maybe by update of processing plugin?

Thanks!

We do (most likely) not need to keep it in a separate branch. Just like
we do not have a Qt5 branch. It's all in master.

My point is:

If we think about taking the step towards QGIS 3 with py3 and pyqt5
anytime soon, then the first steps are clear anyway. And probably not
even too hard.

Having a plan is good. Having a plan based on solid knowledge is better.

Hi all,

I am working on a script which will generate isochrone polygons based on
weighted route points (produced via osrm).
The last step is to generate the polygons via the Concave Hull tool.

I have encountered two problems here  (using the experilental

* One very simple to debug about the way qgis::dissolve is caled
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2398

* One other I have not understand yet : there is a bug about "progress" not
defined in lines 82 and 92
https://github.com/mdouchin/QGIS/blob/patch-1/python/plugins/processing/algs/qgis/ConcaveHull.py#L82

Anyone has any clue about this last bug ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Future GDAL version?
Message-ID: <562CD9F3.90007@pp1.inet.fi>

Hi devs,

in a workshop here was GDAL newer versions discussed, eg. use of 
ElasticSearch possibility and other new and coming benefits.

Then I tried to find aswers to situation of GDAL 2.x development in QGIS 
and found 2 related texts,

First related:  Bug report #12479 made by Mark Johnson 7 months ago, 
which describes situation of the changes needed.

Second related; One month ago (24/9) Ragi Burhum asked (I didn't find 
any reply for this):
"2.- The second question is related to GDAL versions. Our tool relies 
heavily on GDAL/OGR and I am curious if there are any plans to switch 
GDAL 2.0 anytime soon? If not, we can back port a lot of our changes, 
but I wanted to understand what was the release plan before we started 
pushing one way vs another."

So my question: Is there a plan to upgrade version of GDAL to 2.x and 
what's the target QGIS version?

Best regards,
Kari
PS: There might be also some othe benefits in this upgrade! ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] broken WFS client commit
Message-ID: <562D0006.3030407@duif.net>

Hi devs,

Looking at this commit:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/e4e4839823fad1b980cb815889c18edb9c4352b7

it looks like there there was a checkbox introduced which forces the WFS
provider to add a bbox to the requests.

but this was already working via the 'cached' option.

Currently for the use-case where you get features from a server which
has maximized number of features to return, this is broken, see also [0]

So my question to devs:
- what was the idea of adding this option
- what was the plan to make it play right with the old implementation
- can we come with plan to make it work again

[0] http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13117

My take:

- the 'caching' option never had a real 'caching'-mechanism, because
(correct me if I'm wrong), we do/can not work with features with id's,
so we cannot really cache the features... so the mechanism used was to
resend a getFeatureRequest including a bbox filter for every pan/zoom

- the 'use current bbox' is practically doing the same, BUT only uses
the initial bbox, so does not resend the 'current' bbox

Scenario's I see

- a wfs server serving out an amount of features which can be retrieved
in one take by QGIS (essentially a data-download)
- a wfs server serving out just too much features to retrieve
(practically for QGIS, or because it is a 'limiting' server)
(Am I missing something?)

Should we maybe 'rename' the 'caching' option to be an option which
makes QGIS resend a feature request every zoom/pan?

Or any other ideas/options?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7QfMAgZxDbWZj9CuQVZV0V+ZXcBRXVeBNQTD5x2SVSKg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have just upgraded QGIS to 2.12 on my Ubuntu Vivid via the official QGIS
repository ( qgis.org )
After running it, I saw half of my installed plugins are marked as
"corrupted" because of a missing metadata file.

I would like to update my plugins to make them compatible with QGIS 2.12.
Do I need to rename the metadata.txt file ?

Thanks in advance

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6LUs6CqA5y8Od-Y2QEh295bXA4tnrFDbcBCxncRWT2ow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I discovered my issue with python plugins was much more thant missing
metadata files.

In fact, it appears that all the plugin files have been somehow corrupted
in my .qgis2/python/plugins/ folder !
When doing an ls command in one of the plugins folder, I get this :
https://paste.sh/yOPsb32r#hhoIbJV9PiYaNBt6XYwwgVv_

When I sudo ls in this folder, it seems the files are here:
https://paste.sh/03-NDL3b#lq1Xwua28gqj-2cOYzODd_Bp

A simple "nano" for one file tells me the file is a new empty one
A "sudo nano" shows me the file content.

It seems something broke the files permissions and ownership for me.
Any one has encountered the same thing ?

NB : I was stupidely using QGIS 2.10 while apt-get upgraded into 2.12 which
is surely the reason why everything went crazy in my laptop ;)

I am pretty confident I can find a solution via chmod and chown, but this
can be scary for some users, and hopefully I am the only one concerned


Cheers
Michaël

I agree we should revert to the old behaviour and rename the label.

This change has now broken a major use case for users of large WFS datasets.

2.8.3 is available in the testing repos and I just pushed it to stable, so
could you try that and see if you still run into the same issues?

Hi,


the basic infrastructure for messaging and email notifications is already
in place, depending on the features we want and how complex would be the
required user interface, a rough estimation of the required development
time is one day.

The most difficult part to implement would be email throttling (if we
really need it).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Distance calculation accuracy ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7ZD75yRa-x0xsw-wVYcWgf51Q=_w=z35ix2AzSW6vmZw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Someone reported to me an issue with $length distance calculation and the
"Distance" map tool. It seems to him QGIS was not precise enough compared
to field data collection (about 10% or worst discrepency)

I remember reading some discussions here about wrong distance calculations
in some contexts.
Has anyone a "cookbook" or good practices about distance calculations in
QGIS, regarding different data sources, contexts, SCR, etc. ( on the fly
reprojection or not, data provider, etc.)

Thanks in advance
Michaël

Hi Mathias

seems related with this your commit about Python3 compatbility

-  if ( !PyString_Check( obResult ) )

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FgzziA3yWYn4Q5XyRrA=WdorbuP2mQVeHjAD5RGe8x99w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just updated to the newest version which brought back the startup tips
screen. There, I noticed that we have a tip explaining the different parts
of the QGIS project which I think is outdated. Here's my suggestion for an
update: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2400

QGIS Application --> QGIS Desktop
QGIS Webserver --> QGIS Server (like on the visual changelog)
WMS support --> general OGC standards support

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 2.12 'Lyon'
Message-ID: <20151026123606.GA26862@norbit.de>

QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System
that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.

We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 2.12 'Lyon'. Lyon was the
host city to our developer meet up in April 2012.

Latest Release

This is another regular release following our four monthly schedule.  It again
brings many nice new features to QGIS.  

Please also note that we're constantly keeping our long term release QGIS 2.8
'Wien' in good shape to better suit more conservative production setups.

New Features in QGIS 2.12 'Lyon'

QGIS 2.12 includes many great new features, tweaks and enhancements to make the
most popular Free desktop GIS even more feature filled and useful.  Visit the
visual changelog that highlights some of the new additions
(http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog212/).

Whenever new features are added to software they introduce the possibility of
new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a
ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker (http://hub.qgis.org).

The source code and binaries for Windows, Debian and Ubuntu are already
available via the large download link on our home page: http://qgis.org.  More
packages will follow as soon as the package maintainers finish their work.
Please revisit the page if your platform is not available yet.


Thanks

Finally we would like to thank our official sponsors for the invaluable
financial support they provide to this project:

QGIS is Free software and you are under no obligation to pay anything to use it
- in fact we want to encourage people far and wide to use it regardless of what
your financial or social status is - we believe empowering people with spatial
decision making tools will result in a better society for all of humanity.


Happy QGISing!

from IRC:  i can't compile master on arch due to:
qgis/src/python/qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp:388:58: error: ‘PyUnicode_AsUTF8’
was not declared in this scope

and the commit msg from [0] was:
"
Just to demonstrate a possible upgrade path ;)

Please revert if this makes any troubles.
"

On Debian I do not seem to have problems though...

Richard

Thank you Victor for help.

I inserted your name in the header of my next "GEarthView.py 3.0 Cesium"
source:

          import ext-libs        Enrico Ferreguti
                                       Victor Olaya

With your help (and Enrico) I definitively solved  :)


A presto

Hi,

Related to this problematic (and not specific to processing), should the
future 3.0 version of QGIS be a good opportunity to review a little bit
the plugin management system ?

I am thinking of: using pip to manage plugins.

This would have some advantages :
- allow a plugin to depend on external packages and rely on pip
implementations on the different platforms to resolve dependencies
- this could also be used to have a plugin that depends on other plugins
- metadata could be integrated (rather than the current custom metadata.txt)
- possibly ease the deployment of plugins with binary parts (to be explored)
- ease the development of plugins with Python's virtualenv (say for
instance a stable and a "dev" virtualenv)
- use standard tools, both on client (pip) and server (pypi) part.

I am not sure yet if it would require an API break, but the version
change could be a good opportunity for a clean up.

Thoughts ?

Sure, the problem of dependences needs to be solved in python QGIS. 

But, in the meantime, sure (also) that I (or, better We of GEarthView team :) have solved.  Only, you need to wait my next GEarthView 3.0 version ( "Cesium" named :)

A presto !

Hello Hugo,

IMHO using  setuptools and pip it's a good idea, it does support download
and install from several protocols (git included) out of the box, it also
support dependencies and keywords licence tags, I'm not sure that it can
support custom tags too, but it it's not so important.

I guess that most of the times, a plugin would not even need to be hosted
by us on plugins.qgis.org but it could just be a git(hub) URI (with a big
red warning to the the users that they are installing software from an
external repository  etc. etc.).

I'm not sure about the support on other platforms, luckily (for me) I'm
deeply ignorant about other OSes but it seems that windows users often have
a lot of problems with installing and running python code: would
pip/setuptools make things easier for them?

I don't understand completely what do you mean with the other points
(virtualenvs and binary parts) can you elaborate?

Exactly. That are interesting features.

Actually, this is the main concern I have with the current system: most
of the Windows users get their python environment through the QGIS
installer or osgeo4w. And if a plugin needs another dependency, it has
to be installed by other means.
Pip does exist for Windows and OSX and could act as a package manager
(where Linux users are usually happy with their distro package manager)

These are just ideas for now :) I don't have a strong experience with
these tools, so it would have to be confirmed.
But the idea is that if QGIS plugins are built with setuptools / pip,
then you can setup different virtualenvs with different sets of plugins
available in them. That may be interesting when dealing with different
user profiles or during development.

About binary parts: setuptools allows to insert compilation directives
if a module depends on C(++) parts. I don't know if this feature could
allow plugins with compiled parts ... the idea would be to include C(++)
sources with the plugin and have a standard way of compiling it, so that
it could be compiled by trusted sources on main platforms ... or by the
user if a standard compilation environment is present.

Hi Spencer,
I'm moving the thread to  qgis-dev ML.

Instead of using the postgis_utils.py module,
just import db_manager/db_plugins/postgis/connector.py
and create an instance of PostGisDBConnector.
That class allows you to do everything you need, even run a sql query.

Here's a code snippet acting on the active PostGIS layer:

from db_manager.db_plugins.postgis.connector import PostGisDBConnector

vl = iface.activeLayer()
uri = QgsDataSourceURI( vl.source() )
conn = PostGisDBConnector( uri )

sql = u"SELECT * FROM mytable"
cursor = conn._execute( None, sql )
for row in conn._fetchall( cursor ):
    print row
conn._close_cursor( cursor )

sql = u"UPDATE mytable SET col1='5' "
conn._execute_and_commit( sql )


For more usage examples, have a look at connector.py code,
or just ask ;-)

Cheers!
Giuseppe

Some random thoughts:

Quite powerful... but ... the current plugin packaging has very limited
requirements: it's just a zipped folder with a couple of mandatory metadata
and a class interface, building a simple plugin is definitely an easy task.

I'm afraid that by using a much more complicate system (such as
setuptools), would solve some problem for the (few) complex plugins and
create a lot of problems and increase the barrier for the vast majority of
simpler plugin authors.

We should take this into account and think carefully.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] XYZ_coordinates Plugin
Message-ID: <1445890265777-5232686.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

This is my first plugin: *XYZ_coordinates Plugin*

/The XYZ_coordinates is a QGIS python plugin that allows edit X, Y and Z
coordinates from 3D geometry (shapefile source).

The input data required are a vector layer with points, lines and polygons
with elevation (3D) values from shapefile source. Loading and edit 3D
information on QGIS, Z value will be lost and user cant do anything to
recouver it. With XYZ_coordinates plugin it will be possible to have full
control of geometry features on X, Y and Z coordinates.

New updates will be made in future allowing other sources like PostGIS or
Spatialite./

Please, feel free to test and report feedbacks:

XYZ_coordinates Plugin: https://github.com/paulopires16/xyz_coordinates
Shapefiles with geometries for test: https://github.com/paulopires16/data

Thanks

Do you have any evidence that it's the PyUnicode_Check? I think that
should be supported by Python 2.7 as well.

The other error by Richard from IRC  (PyUnicode_AsUTF8) makes more
sense, since it's not supported by 2.7 but it should be ifdef'd, strange
that this happens. Maybe re-running cmake would help??

Message-ID: <562F282A.6090506@carto.net>

Hi devs,

The visual changelog is almost finished: 
http://changelog.qgis.org/qgis/version/2.12.0/

We miss a lot of "Developed by", "Funded by". While this isn't 
absolutely necessary, it is a good opportunity, to show what you did to 
the project - and who funded it. It shows that things don't happen out 
of the blue - and needs efforts and finances.

If you developed a feature in the changelog - and it isn't yet 
attributed to you - let me know. I can add it. Also - if you have 
improvements/corrections in text and screenshots.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi All

Could I ask you all to peer review the content on:

http://changelog.qgis.org/qgis/version/2.12.0/

Please don't broadcast that link yet to your social networks - once it is
peer reviewed, Richard is going to publish it as RST on the web site and we
will give an 'official' link to send out for general reading pleasure.

If you do wish to make any changes, either make them directly on the site
if you have access, or send me off list your change suggestions. Please put
CHANGELOG in your subject line so that I can easily filter those emails.

Regards

Tim

My bad, install the 32 bit version on a 64 bit OS. Installing the 64 bit
version of OSGEO4W fixed it.

Hi Andreas,

I think it's missing the new GRASS plugin from the visual changelog.

Best regards,

Yes, could someone please revert or solve this? I've been meeting this 
issue since last summer (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13117) and it 
prevents some of my customers to upgrade from 2.8, missing all kinds of 
nice new features.

hm - indeed! The whole GRASS plugin improvement is missing.

I created an entry:

Pedro or Radim: can you please correct/extend this entry? Do you have 
any good screenshots?

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Spatialite database locked after layer removal.
Message-ID: <9BEAE41C5F3C764E84B78481B4AC2D7EABFB49@STGV-BUS01.thinkwhere.local>

Hi,

I am having trouble renaming a spatialite database that I have been using in QGIS (2.10.1-Pisa).  I have been working in Python, but the problem can be easily recreated through the GUI.


1)      Add spatialite layer from sqlite file

2)      Remove spatialite layer (right click, remove)

3)      Rename or delete the sqlite file

Python gives ‘WindowsError’ in Windows 7, or ‘OSError’ in Xubuntu 14.04.  The Linux terminal gets:
mv: cannot move ‘test.sqlite’ to ‘test2.sqlite’: Text file busy

After a few (1-5?) minutes the lock is removed.

With shape file layers, the lock is removed as soon as the layer is removed.  Is there a reason for the delay with the spatialite file?  Is there a command that I can call to refresh/drop the connection more quickly?

Thanks,
John

The WFS client should really get some love by a developer (and our 
funds). Currently, it is broken and does not support the newer WFS version.

Hopefully, we can fund something from our donations/sponsorships.

Thanks for conditional formatting! It's a really great new feature!
But I noticed that with row formatting enable, cell aspect does not update
as the value changes. You have to re-apply rules to update the table.
Is it the normal behaviour or an Issue?

Hey Enrico,

Seems the update when the value changes doesn't have any effect when using
the full row style option.  If you color just the cell it seems to work as
expected.

Are you using the full row style option?

I will take a look into it soon.

Regards,

Hi Veronica,

Did you install GRASS in OSGeo4W? Which version?
On Sunday I made an installation on Windows and I found a problem. GRASS
7.0.2RC is already available on OSGeo4W. However, the .bat file that is
created for the use of GRASS7 with QGIS, does not work, because it points
to the folder structure of GRASS 7.0.1.

I don't know if this has been corrected since then, and whether this might
be your problem. I am forwarding this thread also for QGIS mailing list.

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Hi Pedro:
I'm not on the QGIS list, please forward to them that they would better use
this approach to get the path rather than hardocing it:

grass70 --config path

If they need Python, they could use something like this:

https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Working_with_GRASS_without_starting_it_explicitly#Python:_GRASS_GIS_7

# query GRASS 7 itself for its GISBASE
startcmd = [grass7bin, '--config', 'path']

p = subprocess.Popen(startcmd, shell=False,
                     stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
out, err = p.communicate()if p.returncode != 0:
    print >>sys.stderr, "ERROR: Cannot find GRASS GIS 7 start script
(%s)" % startcmd
    sys.exit(-1)
gisbase = out.strip('\n\r')
 # Set GISBASE environment variableos.environ['GISBASE'] = gisbase#
the following not needed with trunkos.environ['PATH'] += os.pathsep +
os.path.join(gisbase, 'extrabin')# add path to GRASS addons
home = os.path.expanduser("~")os.environ['PATH'] += os.pathsep +
os.path.join(home, '.grass7', 'addons', 'scripts')

Can you please install GRASS 7.0.1-1 instead of 7.0.2RC1-1?

To do so, go to OSGeo4W -> Advanced Install -> Desktop

You should have something like

7.0.2RC1-1   Skip   ...  grass: GRAS GIS - stable release

Please, click in "Skip" and you should get 7.0.1-1. Click Next, install
this version and then try again GRASS plugin in QGIS (search for GRASS 7 in
Plugins -> Manage and Install Plugins).

As Moritz said, Processing GRASS is independent from GRASS Plugin.

Thanks,
Pedro

Message-ID: <CAAMki4HTyCYj4sQrna9nXXk4EXR0rSdtB7yEG6YAS66BsH_v-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi qgis-devs!

I've been asking in grass-dev list today, and Helmut recomended to write
here, so sorry for double posting if any of you is in both lists

I've installed grass and qgis (2.12) from the osgeo4w installer 32 bits (
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/), using "Advance install". To get grass
plugin, I also selected from Libs:

qgis-grass plugin (for grass64)
qgis-grass plugin common
qgis-grass plugin7 (for grass7)

Both, testing with grass7.0.2RC1-1 and grass7.0.1-1, I do not find grass
plugin in Plugin --> Manage and Install Plugins. Using QGIS with grass64
works fine and plugin is there, though.

Am I missing something else?

Thanks a lot in advance!
Cheers
Vero

I confirm this.

I've installed

qgis-rel-dev 2.12.0-3
qgis-dev 2.13.0-3

and I get GRASS 7 plugin working properly, using grass 7.0.1-1 and running
qgis-rel-dev-g7.0.1.bat and qgis-dev-g7.0.1.bat, respectively.

I also installed qgis 2.12.0-1 (qgis: QGIS Desktop), and running
qgis-grass7.bat, I don't have the GRASS 7 plugin.

Moreover, if I try to uninstall grass I get:

grass (7.0.2RC1-1)
GRASS GIS - stable release
Required by: qgis-dev, qgis-grass-plugin7, qgis-rel-dev
So, it seems that it is not a dependency for 2.12.0-1, which leads to
suspect that this version was not compiled with grass 7. Am I wrong?

Veronica, please install qgis-rel-dev 2.12.0-3 instead of qgis 2.12.0-1.

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Hi all

Thanks Richard for your answer.

I made some tests. Here are my conclusions :

* By default, QGIS will use the current project ellipsoid to compute
distances.
* You can change this behaviour in the Project Properties dialog ( Menu
Project > Project properties ), tab "General"
* The safest distance calculation is done when you use the same projection
between the project and the layers. I have seen some weird lengths while
using the map tool with OTF on, with a project in Pseudo Mercator (EPSG:
3857) and a projected layer ( EPSG:2154 ). Like 30% differences (which is
huge)
* You can select "Planimetric / None" instead of an ellipsoid in the
project properties option to avoid discrepencies between distance
measurements (for example inside projects with different OTR parameters).
But you won't then benefit from the precise calculation done by using the
projection ellipsoid.
* It seems many other softwares like ArcGis or grass , they use
"Planimetric / None" to compute the distance (and I read some deactivate
distance tool when OTF is on)

So it seems to me QGIS is advanced here in the field of calculating
distances (and areas, etc.), but the end user must know what he (she) is
doing to fully understand what is going on. Should we not use "Planimetric
/ None" as a default parameter, even if OTF is on ? Advanced users could
benefit of more precision by using the projection ellipsoid, but everyone
else will have consistent measurements ?

Cheers

I am very cautious in rejecting someone's work. Our choice in QGIS has
always been to be inclusive, and this has proved hugely successful, when
compared to other projects.
I try to push gently, rather.

this is partly possible (check the "category" tag, but I agree this

I'm trying to gently push towards this as well. I have about 10 plugin
queueing because of lack of feedback from authors, and I feel sorry
about this, as users are missing potentially useful functions.

I'm not 100% sure having a translated description without a translated
plugin is very good for users. Feel free to open a ticket on this.
More importantly, remember that the whole plugin management is voluntary
work (except for some funding for specific improvements of the
infrastructure), so securing some funding is crucial to implement all
the above, and more.

All the best, and thanks for your thoughts.

Hi All (with apologies for cross posting)

We are planning to get the QGIS Podcast running again on a regular (weekly)
basis. We are looking for volunteers to help with the production of the
podcast e.g.

* building a nice website for http://podcast.qgis.org that updates each
time we add an episode (yes I know the current page looks aweful)
* writing some nice original intro/outro jingles to play during segment
transitions
* joining us as a guest to tell us about how you are using QGIS in your
work, academic or personal life
* helping with post production work to edit the audio content into a nice
neat podcast
* helping to post shownotes for the episodes onto our libsyn stream
* helping with ideas for the kind of content you would like to hear
* appearing as a regular show host

We will try to include a mix of content for both users and geekier
developer types. We will be recording every thursday at 14h30 GMT+2 (South
Africa time). I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards

Tim Sutton

Hi all,
I'm back using FUSION lidar tools' and I can see that there are some 
things that need to be changed in the interface to make all the tools work.

I'm not a programmer and I know very basics about python, but I tested 
my modifications on personal .py files; now I would participate to the 
changes in master, in order not to change manually the files at every 
new release.

may I join the dev group only for these small changes? how can I do it?
many thanks in advance!

all the best,

Nic


PS
In the while: is anyone able to explain me why the text "[optional]" 
appears in the input parameters even where is not specified? (before 2.4 
this didn't happen)

Just make a pull request to the QGIS repository, and I will review it
and merge it is it's ok

I will see why there are those [optional] labels that you mention, and
come back to you with an explanation

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QEP process
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg9smu-6YEweBcqXevMMnDKp+YRjHaEmBMy43mMGyd5TFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

After watching the QEP process since it was created I will admit that using
the Pull Request system wasn't the best solution and I'm not happy with it
and the problems it causes.  It was confusing and just clunky, live and
learn I guess.

I have decided to use GitHub issues instead as it's a lot easier to edit
and follow what is going on.  All the existing Pull Requests have been
moved and authors assigned as the owners. Sorry if I missed anyone.

Over the next few days I will convert the text to markdown so it renders
correctly.

Using issues should make things clearer on what is going on as you can see
clearly what the QEP is about and the talk around it at the bottom.
Hopefully everyone is happy with this move.

This will also make editing the QEP easier as it can all just be done
though the web and then copied into the main repo when done.  I am happy to
do the last step after they are approved.

A note on the current process:  I would also like to review the current
process as I think it's failing mainly because it's just to much red tape
for what we need.    This will be a different email but it will be mainly
around which QEPs need what votes and who focuses on what to keep things
smooth.

QEPs now at: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues

Regards,
Nathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] use ogr2ogr in a plugin
Message-ID: <5630D71F.90609@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to use ogr2ogr in a plugin, and I wonder if it's possible
to call the one that has been installed along QGIS, independently from
the OS.

The idea is to connect to a Postgres DB and writes content of tables
into shapefiles. One way would be to load the tables in QGIS and write
content manually, but a single ogr2ogr would be quite straightforward.

Thanks a lot for any lead,

Denis

The ShellDB plugin has a carefully written and maintained documentation page in a file called "ShellDB_Help.html".  Alas, it's buried in the ShellDB plugin directory ('~/.qgis2/python/plugins/ShellDB').  I worry that nobody sees it there and everyone thinks that I haven't made an effort on documentation.  Is there an Approved Way to present usage information for plugins that I've missed?

Thanks Charles for poiting this out.
In fact, we have various ways of presenting the documentation, e.g.:
* on the home page of the plugin
* as a submenu of the plugin menu

plugin1 --|--plugin1
          |
          |--help

* as a menu of the plugin popup window
* etc.

IMO we should provide clear guidelines on where to put it.
All the best.

You need to write a SHP directly ?  Do you need something like a batch, for mass production purposes ?

Why don't you use simply the standard Qgis postgis connection ?
You can "add" a PostGIS connection and open a table. 

It is not sufficient, this ?

Explain it better. 


A presto

​+1​ I think this is a good step towards making the process easier. I have
to admit that I felt kind of overwhelmed whenever I tried to check and
contribute to the QEPs.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Pyqgis add field to PostGIS table fails
Message-ID: <CAHCHdbKY7sg4vdQs=vpFnnFfy8Sr1uLGXQ7ujX-eUN75yksn2g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to add a field to my PostGIS table using the following code:

--------------------------------------------------------
from PyQt4.QtCore import QVariant
from qgis.core import *

inLayer = iface.activeLayer()
provider = inLayer.dataProvider()

# add field
field = QgsField('test_field', QVariant.String)
inLayer.startEditing()
provider.addAttributes([field])
inLayer.updateFields()

# commit
inLayer.commitChanges()
--------------------------------------------------------

The commit fails and the PostGIS log shows an error:

2015-10-27T08:13:28 1 Erroneous query: ALTER TABLE "received"."env" ADD
COLUMN "test_field" returned 7 [ERROR: syntax error at end of input

LINE 1: ALTER TABLE "received"."env" ADD COLUMN "test_field"

Seems the call to PostGIS fails to include the column type. Is this a bug,
or am I going about this the wrong way?

Yes, I need to write the SHP directly, I'm not much intersted to load
this in QGIS.
QGIS is used to define the bounding box and to offer the UI for this
batch processing. The idea of using QGIS is that it will not depend on
something installed either on the server or the desktop computer.

Hi,

QGIS 2.12:
testing the new features of the new geometry checker plugin (very nice 
indeed)
i got QGIS to crash trying to fix a multipolygon shapefile layer, in 
windows;
if you can confirm this issue I can open a bug report

best regards.

I also got a couple of crashes, but had no opportunity to find a way to
replicate the issue with a minimal test suite. If you can, I can check
it here.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Denis,

I assume the path env variable should be appropriately set in all OS'es
when inside QGIS so calling ogr2ogr (e.g. subprocess.call( 'ogr2ogr
params' ) should just work. But to be honest, I never tried.

If with test suite you mean steps to reproduce the crash:

(1) load a multipolygon shapefile

(2) open up geometry checker plugin and set polygon as allowed geometry 
types

(3) set "modify input layer"

(4) run the tool

(5) once finished select one of the multipolygon from the table

(6) on Error resolution settings select "Convert to corresponding multi 
or single ..." and press OK

(7) click "Fix selected errors using default resolution"

100% crash

That's actually what the ogr2ogr algorithm in Processing does...

Just taking advantage of this thread to advertize RFC 59.1 : GDAL/OGR 
utilities as a library that will be part of GDAL 2.1 :

https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc59.1_utilities_as_a_library

And the current hardcoded list of formats and extensions could be dynamically 
populated from the metadata of drivers starting with GDAL 2.0 :

from osgeo import gdal
for i in range(gdal.GetDriverCount()):
    drv = gdal.GetDriver(i)
    if drv.GetMetadataItem(gdal.DCAP_VECTOR) and \
      drv.GetMetadataItem(gdal.DCAP_CREATE):
        extensions = drv.GetMetadataItem(gdal.DMD_EXTENSIONS)
        if extensions is not None:
            print('%s: %s' % (drv.GetDescription(), extensions))

I discovered Random3Dcity, it's a nice Python software that let design

Since QGIS already support GML, maybe it could be used in QGIS some day?

Thanks for the detailed steps, I've fixed this in my geom_checker_fixes 
branch [1] (which I periodically push into master).

A backtrace might already be sufficient to pin-point the issue. Clearly, 
the more info, the better.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New test for python binding coverage
Message-ID: <CAB28Asjd4uCK0pjH_POKca0-cngZ4qdXysx32q7Swu6thCq+uw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Recently I pushed a new unit test to master which is designed to test
coverage of the python sip bindings. I thought it's probably a good
idea to give a quick run-down of how this test works, and what it
means for you.

First, the motivation for this new test is to prevent new classes or
methods being added to the public API which aren't available in the
python bindings. It's not perfect, as various limitations mean that
I've only be able to test whether a particular member exists within
the bindings, and can't test for matching signatures/overloads (seems
this isn't possible in python).

The test uses the doxygen API docs to determine what public api should
be available in the python bindings. So if it's not in the docs, it
won't be tested. Just like the doxygen coverage test, there's a
hardcoded limit for the number of members which are missing bindings.
If your commit causes this threshold to be exceeded, the test will
fail.

To avoid this test tripping, you can:
1. Make sure any public/protected methods or public members you add
are also added to the python bindings.

2. If this isn't possible, the test will skip any classes which have a :
"@note not available in Python bindings"
doxygen note for the class. So if you add a class to core/gui/...
which ISN'T intended to be public API, either exclude it from the docs
with the doxygen
/// @cond
...
/// @endcond
directives, or tag the class with the @note

3. For individual members/methods, the test will skip any with a
doxygen note containing the word "python". So, notes of the form:
"@note not available in python bindings"
"@note available as getStuffV2 in python api"
will be skipped. (The thought here is that it indicates that some
consideration has been given to the python bindings and it's not just
an intentional omission).

If the test fails, a full list of the classes/members missing from the
bindings will be available in the test report on cdash
(http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS). This will help
identify which added members have tripped the test.

Like I said at the start, the test is far from perfect/infallible, but
at least it's a quick indicator/reminder to add stuff to the sip
bindings before submitting commits/Pull Requests, and a good
indication to reviewers if these haven't been added yet.

Hi, 
I see various versions in debian and debian nightly packages, following
debian's versions. 
We still have wheezy Debian 7 servers here (sorry, not able to boost that),
and I found only 2.10 version for qgis and qgis server amd 64. Did I miss
something or is wheezy too old to be maintained?
Thanks for your lights! 
Régis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to access the QgsVisibilityPresetCollection()
	in pyqgis
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_G-yw2epBCq+yQNXg-wf1vC85oLqu4p9bVEU6kQp8+VQg@mail.gmail.com>

Is it possible to access to presets in a project using PyQgis? I found
QgsVisibilityPresetCollection() in QGIS API, but I can't seem to find how
to access the current one used by the active project.

My plans were to create a plugin that allows to manage all the projec
presets. Things like update or rename a preset (without the need to remove
the current ones), and also return a list of presets to be used in Map
Composition.

Thanks

You access it through the project instance (in 2.12 at least... it
wasn't accessible to PyQGIS in previous versions). See
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsProject.html#a33240f824d62c40d56ee569f6b0ac2a5

QGIS 2.12 and above require GEOS 3.4.   I just updated INSTALL and the download
page to reflect that - but we still carry packages for 2.8 on wheezy.

may you use processing wrapper to ogr2gr?

e.g.

import processing
processing.runalg("your processing command get with
processing.alglist",... etc etc)

is that you are looking for?

in this waqy you are os independent.

Cool, Thanks Nathan, in my opinion a wise decision! For me too it was
rather abstract to find the right link to read the QEP sometimes.

Will it be possible to update the plugin or is it mandatory to recompile
QGIS as a whole to test the bug fix?

Hi all,

I have tested the HTML map tooltip, and it does not resolve relative path.
I tried to look at the code [1] and [2], but could not find where the
context is defined for the webkit HTML

Does anyone have a clue ?

In short, you'll need to recompile the entire QGIS. But if you then keep 
the sources and build directory, subsequent builds will be incremental, 
hence much quicker.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Postgresql provider - Use ST_RemoveRepeatedPoints
	for server-side simplification
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6ngmUEDqBSQ=sMw4vay88BZn+fM0w6YmUB2eR-Ec=tsg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Following the blog post written by Paul Ramsey [1], I decided to propose
using PostGIS 2.2 ST_RemoveRepeatedPoints function instead of ST_SnapToGrid
to do the server side simplification

We could also investigate other new features, such as the 3rd parameter for
ST_Simplify, but we use St_SimplifyPreserveTopology in QGIS, and I do not
think this function has got this new parameter too.

I made a pull request : see [2]
Please help me to test and review it

Message-ID: <5633536A.8070802@duif.net>

Hi Mac users,

in this issue

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/issues/281

somebody suggests to install qgis via:

brew cask install qgis

as I'm not into this, I ask Mac users/devs to let me know if it is wise
to use this option or not. If you let this know in the issue discussion
I can decide how to close that one.

Hi Richard,


this is interesting, about   "brew cask" :

http://caskroom.io/

This evening, I will test the install of QGIS using brew on my Mac (and I
will report you what happens)


A presto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] master build cannot load Python support
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=z3zfGAGVDKOeMKrxGLYsbuCmas+JJknQ6rfODAt2jwsw@mail.gmail.com>

I can't have Python support loaded when running QGIS master from my own
build, and no traceback is available (getvalue() did not return a string).
I run it from the build directory and staged plugins.

I already built QGIS various times, with the same configurations, and I
can't figure out what has changed... Is it just a problem with my setup?

Solved. The problem was missing PyQt4 QtSql, which is missing from the apt
string in INSTALL doc.
I will push a PR to update the doc, also for the new QPA dependencies.

Hi,

There was any problem with QGIS 2.12 (with ubuntugis dependencies)
packaging for Ubuntu 14.04? They are only available for 12.04. For 14.04
the version available is still 2.10.1.

Thanks!

The cask project is merely a means of automating Mac drag/drop or package
installers of applications via the *command line*, nothing more. So in this
instance, the QGIS cask install is a third-party install method (cask) of a
third-party installer (kyngchaos). It bares no responsibility or obligation
to the QGIS project or the Kyngchaos.com project, whose installer it
downloads and installs, nor involves any long standing Mac developers
associated with the QGIS project.

I highly recommend avoiding listing such an install method on the QGIS
website, especially since a user can just get the same installer directly
from the project-recognized packager, Kyngchaos.com.

Hi,

Here are some other considerations:

Cask's simplicity obfuscates necessary communication. If you look at the
[qgis cask formula](
https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/qgis.rb) you
will see it automates several installs, **all** of which have very
important README files that the user should read during every
install/update/upgrade.

Also, considering William at Kyngchaos.com has bundled the GDAL Complete
frameworks into the application bundle for QGIS 2.12. It makes no sense to
use a third-party installation method of that installer.

I also would not consider installing Homebrew, then adding cask, then
running the install commands (all via command line Terminal sessions)
simpler than downloading a DMG and double-clicking the installer.

All 'official' QGIS installers should be stored on OSGeo resources and
distributed via the QGIS project's web site and be supported by the actual
developers/packagers that created them, not via some third-party middleman
style installation with no obligations or responsibility to the QGIS
project.

Another aspect is trust. The official Mac (and possibly Windows) installers
will soon be code signed with valid certificates. With the cask project,
there is no guarantee or chance to check that the installation is from the
trusted source (other than a internal hash check), as compared to visually
verifying all of this through the standard Apple installer utilities, e.g.
double-clicking and running the .pkg installers, where the entire
certificate trust chain can be reviewed.
