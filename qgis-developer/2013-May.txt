Hi All,

following a dicussion at the HF  and a request made by Borys, I've added a
couple of fields to the plugins.xml:

<downloads>3041</downloads>
<average_vote>3.285244965</average_vote>
<rating_votes>7</rating_votes>

this fields can be used to show more informations in the installer, maybe a
nice star array would be the best for showing ratings.

Also, don't forget that we still have the XML-RPC methods available to
allow rating a plugin directly from QGIS (a valid OSGEO account is needed
though).

OK, I just want to let you know that the first impression for somebody
who has not invented the logo may be different. I see three creatures,
Wassermann and his fellows trying to divide the Earth.

This is my second impression: http://bench.qgis.cz/ms-google-qgis.jpg

Thanks a lot Alessandro for this. It would be good to integrate QGIS desktop with our
web infrastructure, e.g. allowing osgeo registration, ticket reporting etc.
Something for >2.0, perhaps we shoud start putting down ideas and RFC for this.
All the best.

Thanks a lot! I'll implement them (incuding sort by rank) next week. 

I'm thinking if sorting by just <average_vote> is the best option. Maybe 
better use a more complex rank computed from <average_vote> and <downloads> or 
<average_vote> and <rating_votes>. Do anybody has any ideas for such rank?

I can't promise I manage to do it for 2.0, but of course, it goes to the TODO 
:)

We (Alessandro with limited help from myself) tried to develop one, but it proved
more tricky than expected. Ideas welcome, try a few tests to see if they are
reasonable. In practical application.
All the best.

I like that one as well for it's style, but I'm afraid I'll hear people

I prefer #336  
(http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/336)  
over #338.

Could we have a version with more vibrant colors? I appreciate the story  
behind the color selection but I still don't like the colors ...

The current darker grey could be much darker still. I think it would make  
the logo look fresher and more modern - less faded ... Maybe that's what  
puts me off: It looks like it has been printed a long time ago and lost  
almost all color.

Thanks for all the effort everyone!

Best wishes,
Anita

Agreed; I would prefer to add a small logo (the Android, etc.) rather than characters
(Mobile Android is impossible to read in a small logo, a green small monster is easy
to spot).
See e.g. the thunderbird-win|-linux etc. icons.
All the best.

Not #338 because the curved tail, the grided globe + the hands are not 
usable for small icons (taskbar, favicon, etc.).

I'm rooting for #50/#308.

Maybe should we ask for a 16x16 version ?

Not sure. A user might want to have a more natural mapping of attributes

should rather be a help than a default value IMO.

Last, but most important: Sure. Because I broke it all yesterday. This
field in fact is no multiplier, but needs an attribute value reference
field (which I removed). So it should say

Bar length: Scale linearly, such as the following value matches the
specified size:
Attribute value [100] = Bar Length [50]

Which attribute is selected does not matter here at all. It's really
just a helper to get a reasonable default value in this context.

I gave it another try.

I must say I had exactly the same two impressions. I'm not a designer nor 
visual communication expert and I definitely don't feel competent to rate 
logos, but probably most of the community isn't too, so I decided to write my 
2 cents.

I must confess I don't like Larry's work at all (Larry, please don't be 
offended! :) ). For me it's still far too much complicated. Yes, the story 
behind is nice, but for me (as I said I'm not a proffesional) an ideal logo 
contains one shape and one colour. For example, Apple's logo is a good logo. 

For that reason I strongly prefer #50. It's not ideal still, but it's a 
completely opposite: simple, clean and tidy. And - what is also important - it 
refers to our good old colours and - in quite clever way - to the old shape.

Of course you can find #50 too cold, or too corporation-style. Well, for me 
it's just proffesional and it's not a disadvantage. I guess with the two logos 
we send completely opposite messages:
- "We're cool guys, we try to make nice things"
vs
- "We're a proffesional GIS"

and, after consideration, I prefer the second one.

So it looks like #50 and a variation of Larry's stuff is the go at the
moment.

I will also note that once we pick a logo we will get the IP for the logo
so we can tweak the final logo to add or remove things.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rendering order for canvas vertices
Message-ID: <CAOJAE5rstzSG=+CVasSOk--Ye0QCAtL2fmEAEwfq+cHjgQSH-A@mail.gmail.com>

Is there some way to change the rendering order of elements on the canvas?
In a plugin I'm working on, I have a large number of vertices implemented
with QgsVertexMarker(). As the user selects different vertices, the colour
changes from green to red. This all works fine, but it sometimes happens
that one vertex is hidden behind another one nearby, and in these cases you
can't see the red vertex on the map (see http://snag.gy/9fB5s.jpg for
example).

Is there some way to change the rendering order of a vertex to bring it to
the top?

Regards,
Rudi

While I generally have no problems with criticism, I do take issue with
having my work parodied in a cartoon which implies plagiarism.

A simple "it looks too much like Chrome's icon" would have sufficed.

I think it was not meant personally .. As far as I know Radim .. :)
There are a lot of people outside that do really like your designs
(including me) but I also understand the points of others..

It is indeed a important decision and probably everyone wants to see his
favourite design as the final logo ..
That's why I always say I am fine with whatever will win the contest..
Personally I go with Paolo and would like to see "on of ours" as the
winner ..
But I have to say that #50 is also a very clear design and would
probably fit as Icon on the Desktop better..

As I am no Designer too (as Borys already mentioned) I would say every
design that made it on the final page would be good to go and there
should be a clean vote (i am not clear if it should be public or only
the qgis team which stands behind the whole dev process).
There are a lot of stories out there about "wrong" desicisions in logo
design or naming (I remember some automobile which was called I think
"dick" in another language) .. So I guess in some parts of the world the
logo (and the colours) would have different meanings to people. We
should try to be aware of that - but we cannot completely avoid such
collisions. You never can do it "right" for everyone on this world.

Let's just choose the "most voted" .. think about it from different
viewpoints.. try to give the designer feedback about our concerns and
afterwards we should avoid mails like "this one or that one would have
been better"..

To complete this mail.

#50 for simple and clear usable as Icon on the Desktop
#338,#336 and still #280 (for me) to be a logo for a shirt and a very
nice design with a story behind to remember.. but probably not an icon

so let's try to be objective and choose the best one and also accept the
decision

with kind regards
Werner

We need to be able to show/hide some toolbars when QGIS starts up.

I've found some helpful Python code to do this, but where can I put it?

Is there a .py script somewhere that always runs (or has a function that is
always called) after UI initialization where customization code can be
added?

Thanks.

IMHO this decision should be taken only by the active qgis dev team behind the whole design process. Why? I am in the mailing list and I can certainly give my opinion, however for any reason I may or may not stick with QGIS in the future (dropping Quantum from the name by the way would be good), however devs have shown commitment with the project, gone to HF, solve user problems, etc. for me that is enough reason for the dev team to make the decision. I say most of the logos that made final round would make a better logo that what is currently used (no offense intended, just reality), like someone mentioned one logo looks more Corporate/Professional, the other looks more Community/Open-Source, I do not know which look would be better for QGIS, I do know if the aim is to displace COTS (because of the benefits it brings to communities which can invest that money in other ways not expensive software) then #50 would certainly look better and would attract more commercial/government interest just because of brochures, website, etc. If the aim is just to be community,open source driven then I would go with dakcarto logo with more rich colours and write a special place in the website explaining the logo and its story behind (would make a nice logo story), remember you should look the brand overall and think all the branding possibilities not just icons, but website colors, brochures, manuals, etc.
I would strongly suggest whatever the decision, once made final do not question it, embrace it and move on
P.S. My vote is for #50, probably with some tweaking of the color for richness.....btw if it get confused so much, you can always rename to OGIS, OpenSource GIS ;) Cheers

Yes, but we need to have this happen automatically without users having to do
it manually.

+1 for the final decision be made by the developers.

That said, at this stage, my favorite logos are #308, #307 and the bottom
one in #394. They look new, refreshing and professional. and I believe
would give nice icons.

May the best (or consensual) logo win!

Hi again,
Have you guys that think #50 is more suitable for small icons actually tried shrinking them to small sizes?
#50 is fine as a large icon, but when you shrink it right down as a small icon, the triangle becomes so small that it pretty much disappears and you just have a bland circle icon.
When you shrink #336/#338 right down, the globe essentially disappears and you can't really tell that the hands are hands, but the overall design is so distinctive that it is still very easy to recognise.

Hi !

Actually, even if some of the proposed logos look good, there's none that I
like more than the current one.
Of course, that's because by seeing it and seeing it again, I grew attached
to it... But that counts too !!

By reading this thread, it seems that there's no proposal that
really stands out, and for me, all of the proposals fail to find enough
meaning/graphical strength/consensus to justify a radical change from our
good old logo.

If you search for "logo evolution" in google, you'll find a lot of examples
of logos being slightly refined rather than radically changed.
That would also be a way to go, which isn't explored at all in the contest
(at least in the final phase).

I just made this to illustrate my thoughts (and have absolutely
no pretension of any kind with this) :
https://www.dropbox.com/s/o6xhsl8bv6ns30p/QGis-logo_03_for-contest.png

(I know it's a bit late to come up with this, so feel free to ignore it)

Regards,

Olivier

Wouldn't a "featured"/"recommended"/"staff pick" (or call it whatever you
like) flag be a good idea too ? Those would be plugin which are good and
useful for most of the users (not too specific).

It would make it easier to find the best plugins, since when sorting by
rating, you can't distinguish good plugins for general usage from good
plugins which are very specific, and when sorting by downloads, you'll
mostly find good and old plugins, but not good and new plugins.

Re total download showing oldest plugins, might be nice to offer another
indicator based on total download _for the last four weeks_, that would
reflect better current interest.

Four weeks is arbitrary, could be eight, or two :)

Hi,

Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment: we do not record each
single download but just increment a counter.

Might be worth adding to server a one month log for plugins download and
come up with that stat.

There were many "evolutionary" redesigns of our current logo in the first
phase but nobody spoke for them. I think that decided it: We drop the
"uantum" part and go for something new.

I beg your pardon Larry. I am sure that you were not inspired by
Chrome logo. I was thinking about impression it can make on people not
about the origin of the logo.

If you save the ini file out and edit it by hand.  It's just a bunch of
true and false switches.  You can can then load QGIS using the
--customizationfile your.ini option and it will change the UI on load

QGIS can also take a --code yourpythonfile.py that will run after the
project is loaded.

Hi,

Could a git expert tell me how to clean my repo ?

The situation : my fork origin/master is synced with upstream/master but 
if I do a pull request, some old commits are taken into account even if 
they aren't relevant.

The desired solution : wipe all my local history and get a "pure" copy 
of upstream as if I just forked, without deleting my actual github fork.

Regards,

Jean-Roc

assuming that you have commited something to your origin (your fork on
github)
you should first clean your local repo with upstream - to be in sync with
upstream

git reset --hard upstream/master

and then force your local to your origin..

git push origin +master

the bad thing is that you will loose all local changes .. but you did only
ask for cleaning not for saving your data ;)

and i found this solution also on stackexchange
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8134960/git-how-to-revert-master-branch-to-upstream

kind regards

Hi Werner,

Thank for the answer, I already tried git reset but got stuck on that :

$ git reset --hard upstream/master
fatal: ambiguous argument 'upstream/master': unknown revision or path 
not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'

But applying the command 'git remote update' before it did the trick !

I didn't knew this command, should it be used instead of fetch/pull 
upstream ?

My opinion is we should rather break as many things in possible in one
go, instead of multiple times. So if there is someone willing to do
the API change to PyQt V2 I would prefer that we lift the API freeze
and draw out the release rather than stick dogmatically to the
deadlines and create huge inconvenience to plugin writers twice.

Regards

Tim

Generally you should work and push branches to github and issue pull
requests on those.  It will make it easier to keep your pending commits and
changes out of your master branch so you can update it like normal

git checkout -b mywork

do you stuff..

git commit -m "My changes"

git push origin mywork

Pull request on mywork branch.

You can then keep master in line by doing:

git checkout master
git pull --rebase upstream/master

upstream == QGIS github repo, might be different for you.

That was exactly what I was proposing. Provider WHERE clauses are cool 
because they're powerful and fast (executed on the backend and only 
relevant information transferred). QgsExpression WHERE clauses would be 
cool because they provide provider independence. So they both have 
their pro's and con's and I would not artificially restrict users and 
devs. Of course some good explanatory labels on the interface (and in 
the API) would make life easier.

Sounds like handling lots of special cases (e.g. recently somebody 
noticed, that OGR SQL handles string concatenation with NULL's 
differently... [1] )

QgsExpression is suited for filtering as well (e.g. used in the 
attribute table). The calculated value is treated as a boolean then. 
But maybe a tweaked UI could be good for this usecase (The example 
there is pretty useless, it just shows a 1 or a 0).

Thank you Tim and Marco.

Your link looks interesting indeed, Marco. But I wonder if the problem 
there is the same. I think they have a library, which is used by 
different python projects which will use either SIP API V1 or V2 and 
their library is able to deal with both scenarios. So this would rather 
be a possibility to make a plugin work with both API Versions (QGIS 1.8 
and 2.0) by rewriting the plugin to use this compat library.

What we would rather need would be to "inject" some legacy code if a 
plugin is using QString or QVariant (which is sometimes hard to detect 
as in the case of QSettings methods returning a QVariant in API v1 and 
native python objects in v2 so you can't tell from the plugin code, as 
it will just call e.g. toString() on a native python object)

But if we're able to integrate this, all the better! I just don't see 
the solution now.

It seems to me, that the main part of the remaining work is to update 
the core plugins. It would probably be the easiest, if the developers 
of these could do this, because they know the code best. Of course 
these people might not even be active developers any more, might be 
busy with other projects at the moment or have other reasons to leave 
the work to sombody else.

I still looked through the metadata.txt files and gathered the 
information, so if any of you is willing (or not) to port, please give 
a signal.

DB Manager: Giuseppe Sucameli
fTools: Carson Farmer
GdalTools: Giuseppe Sucameli (Faunalia)
MapServer Export: Gary E. Sherman
Plugin Installer: Borys Jurgiel
SEXTANTE: Victor Olaya

To make things easier, I think some automation would be nice. I've 
found two tools which could help, but I don't know them. Maybe somebody 
can help here or bring up another one which I forgot?

* Python rope refactoring library [1]
* Python 2to3 [2]. Actually a tool for performing upgrades from Python 
V2 to Python V3, but it has an interface for custom "fixers" which will 
rewrite code.

Kind regards,
Matthias

Hi JR

It all depends how YOU called your "upstream" .. your fork on github after
cloning is always called "origin" ..
The rest depends which repository you cloned and which one is the remote
attached ..

You can take a look at:
http://quantumofgis.blogspot.co.at/

there i explained "my" workflow for translations ..
I will extend that with a GRASS entry in the next few weeks too - and
afterwards I'll move to branching and merging explanations .. :)

git is not THAT difficult once you are used to it ..

regards
Werner

I've the same process/repo names than described on your blog, the 
exception is 'git pull --rebase upstream master'. You're using it before 
or after a add/commit ?

Sorry, I should have mentioned from the beginning that we're on Windows.

Just did a test using GDAL 1.10.0 on Windows XP. It looks like ogr2ogr is
now giving the correct results with both +no_uoff and +no_off.

Now we'll wait for QGIS to pick up the new GDAL.

Radim, thank you very much for addressing my concern. Your point that the
logo should not look too much like an existing one is important.

I submitted a last minute design (actually I had 3 minutes left) in which I
tried to incorporate a cleaner and more professional look like many devs
believe is needed [0], while at the same time paying homage to the old logo
and it's funky green arrow. Instead of an arrow I used only a green
arrowhead and styled it with a hint of a modern location icon seen on many
mobile devices.

I think it is my best and most straightforward work on the logo. Hopefully,
it doesn't look like anything else out there.  :^)

OK, now fine, thanks.

Agreed, but having a prefilled field ensures that an unexperienced user can always
get a result, and refine it later. I still vote for the autofill.
By default, the attribute used should be the first one selected, or even better the
one with the highest value.
With these two changes, the user is guaranteed to get his graph plotted and visible,
otherwise some frustration may occur.

A few minor notes:
* It would be nice that on reopening the user will find the last used tab, instead of
going back to the first one.
* The default for scale dependent visibility should match those on the General tab
rather than being -1.
Overall, a good improvement, thanks.
All the best.

I like this logo, not so keen on the colors though, but keeping into consideration the time constrain its understandable. I would prefer darker shade of grey and a more vibrant green, looks a bit opaque for me

I beg your pardon Larry. I am sure that you were not inspired by

Chrome logo. I was thinking about impression it can make on people not

about the origin of the logo.

Radim, thank you very much for addressing my concern. Your point that the logo should not look too much like an existing one is important.

I submitted a last minute design (actually I had 3 minutes left) in which I tried to incorporate a cleaner and more professional look like many devs believe is needed [0], while at the same time paying homage to the old logo and it's funky green arrow. Instead of an arrow I used only a green arrowhead and styled it with a hint of a modern location icon seen on many mobile devices.

Actually, now that my browser has admitted to Larry's new ones being up there, I still like the colour story, so #412 to #418 would have my preference. 
(https://99designs.com.au/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/412)

Both of these are unequivocal Qs.
#419 is cleaner, simple and distinctive.
#412 is still fairly clean, very distinctive, and has a bit of a story.

To me these recent ones (>411) are absolutely the best of the bunch.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Blend modes for printer/pdf outputs - advice?
Message-ID: <CAB28AshbWgapbr-tr3uN1pvkZqod6r5vQg=P6HNwPJ3e=0wY9w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm after some advice on the best way to handle pdf or printer output
of compositions when the composition or map contains blending.

Since QPrinter doesn't support the QPainter composition modes, any
blending options are currently ignored when exporting a composition to
pdf/printer. There's two options I can see to handle this, and I'm
wondering what everyone thinks is the best approach.

Option 1 - Automatically export compositions with blending using rasters.
This approach would check whether the composition contains any
blending, and if so would use the "print as raster" option to
effectively flatten the output before exporting. This is probably the
most user-friendly approach, since the user doesn't need to do
anything extra to get the printout looking correct.

Option 2 - Warn the user that blending requires 'print as raster' checked
This approach would display a warning dialog when attempting to
print/pdf a composition containing blending (similar to how svg
outputs currently show a warning). The warning would tell the user to
check "print as raster" if they want the blending modes used in the
export.

The advantage with option 2 is that it leaves the possibility for
vector-based exports even when blending has been used. This way, a
user who wants to further edit a composition in a vector illustration
program (inkscape/illustrator/etc) can still export to an editable pdf
to tweak the map and re-apply the blending in the external program.
Option 1 would make this impossible, since any blending would force
the output into raster format and prevent any manual editing of the
composition.

For this reason my gut feeling is that option 2 is a better way to go,
but I thought I'd raise it with the list for other opinions.

I think option 2 is the best here but don't just warn the user let them
pick it from the message box.

So something like:

You have blend modes enabled but we can't print them as vectors.  What do
you want to do?

Enable Print as Raster | Print as Vector | Cancel

When someone pressing Enable Print as Raster it should tick the box and
print from there.

How about option 3: do option 2, but right below the warning offer a "Print
as raster" checkbox (on by default, IMO).

This way a user is warned and can just choose the option to skip
rasterization, without closing the dialog. Then, only a single "Continue"
button (along with Cancel) would be needed and the dialog would work for
preceding both PDF exporting and printing.

Oh, just saw Nathan's similar reply. Therefore, just adding my 2 cents
worth.

Regards,

Larry

#420 is really cool.
Maybe it would even look better with a little bit less of the 3D effect?

But definitely among my top favorites.

#419 looks really nice. The bevel / gradients need to be a tiny more
discrete, but the overall feeling and direction is great.

Hey Arun,

That looks good and is something that would be great to have you work on
from last year.   Happy to be your co-mentor for UI stuff like last year,
or full mentor if no one else is free.

Martin did you want to co-mentor on this with me?

Regards,
Nathan

Arun

I would be ready to help on the part concerning SEXTANTE elements. I
think this would be a great feature, so it would be awesome to have
you work on it

Cheers

When I try to use "code" or "customizationfile" as a command line option, I
get an error message like:
"The layer C:\Users\Public\ThumbImage\--code is not a valid layer and cant
not be added to the map"

The "--configpath" option doesn't result in an error message, but has no
effect: the UI settings are still read from (and written to) the Windows
registry.

Perhaps on Windows, QSettings always uses the registry now?

David,

Can you paste the command line call you are using.

--configpath does work, I use it one of my projects here
https://github.com/NathanW2/qmap/blob/master/src/loader_src/qmap.bat

This is from a .bat file:

start "Quantum GIS" /B "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\qgis\bin\qgis.exe --configpath
"%cd%\QUANTU~1\Esm.ini"

I notice in the example you mentioned that you are not using a file name
with --configpath, you're using only a path.
Is there a specific file name that must be used?

Thanks for the help.

David

You will have to running the latest dev version of QGIS for this to work as
--configpath is broken in 1.8.

This is what you should do:

start "Quantum GIS" /B "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\qgis\bin\qgis-dev.exe
--customizationfile "%cd%\QUANTU~1\Esm.ini"

If you call the batch file rather then the exe it will set everything up
for you

"%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\qgis\bin\qgis-dev.bat--customizationfile
"%cd%\QUANTU~1\Esm.ini"

the --configpath and --optionpath args just take a folder, there is no
convention.  I am using app in my example just to keep it simple but it can
be anything.

Hi,

I've added several comments to the #420 design that address some of the
concerns raised here and describing the rationale behind the design choices
[0] (scroll right web page frame to top to see comments). Because it is the
shape of the two objects that defines that logo, it can even be reduced to
black and white (like for monochrome printing, though I don't know how
relevant that is nowadays), to a simple colored line drawing, and maybe
even to a font glyph.

While I could post links to the 2D, 2.5D, black/white and other variations,
I think at this point in the logo contest it would be inappropriate of me
to do so, unless asked.

Because I was lacking a better idea, I just filled in
* the maximum value of any attribute for histograms
* the maximum value of the scale attribute for circular diagrams

IF the field is left empty. This way, I don't have to care for not 
overwriting any manual changes of the user and subsequent actions such 
as adding attributes.

All done. Thank you for the inputs.

I'd be glad if you could give it a short test.

Hi Nathan,

Thanks for the help.

It's too late (for this project) for me to move up to the dev version right
now, but that could be very helpful in the future.

I assume when QGIS 1.9 is released, all this will "just work"?

Thanks again,

David

Hi all,

I just installed the latest master available for Ubuntu and noticed
that many "classic qgis" SVG symbols have disappeared (most of north
arrows for example), is this on purpose or is a bug?

Oggetto: [Board] Would you be concerned if the "GeoServices REST API" became an OGC standard?

OSGeo Community,

Currently, voting OGC members are to decide whether to accept the 
"GeoServices REST API" as an OGC standard. This is already a contentious 
issue, with 13 votes for, and 10 votes against, 72 outstanding votes, 
with voting halted temporally, being reopened again in a few days, and 
closing 2 weeks after that. [1]

I'm wanting to hear whether people in the OSGeo community have strong 
opinions regarding this proposed standard, and whether we as a 
collective OSGeo community should make statements to the OGC, and voting 
OGC members, stressing our thoughts.

If there is sufficient interest, I'll raise this issue with the OSGeo 
Board, with the intent of drafting a statement on behalf of OSGeo.

As background:
* "The API was initially developed by Esri and implemented on the ArcGIS 
for Server platform." [2]

* The proposed GeoServices REST API specification overlaps with most OGC 
standards already deployed, including: WMS, WMTS, WCS, WFS, SE/SLD, 
CS/W. This effectively means that for most use cases covered by the 
GeoServices REST API, applications would now have two standards to 
support. Also, spatial infrastructure programs will be impacted, as OGC 
compliance won't necessarily equate to interoperability.

* Most (all?) current OGC web service standards to date have an Open 
Source reference implementation, which was often (always?) part funded 
by OGC testbeds, and open source implementations were tested against 
proprietary implementations during OGC testbeds. As far as I'm aware, 
there has been very little up-take from the Open Source community of the 
"GeoServices REST API", and I'm unaware of any testing of non-ESRI 
applications during OGC testbeds. (Someone may be able to correct me here).

Hi all,

in the bug tracker there are 111 bugs tagged as blockers (regressions
or new features not working as expected)

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=23


and 37 tagged as "causes crash or data corruption"

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=27


I would like to underline that if hypothetically all the blockers were
fixed today, it would be pretty hard to make the necessary tests in
time for the programmed release date.

cheers

I'm starting to wonder if anything becoming a OGC is a good thing.

What impact would this have on QGIS?

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7xc6-i6iSMi+Nap=gB-n-f7qWON9r9vvRn25KdV=HBv_A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I commited a new functionality a few days ago: the SEXTANTE commander.
It is basically a command bar where you can type commands to run
SEXTANTE algorithms, but also QGIS commands, and custom Python
functions.

This is part of SEXTANTE, but since it is a QGIS-wide tool, I would
appreciate comments and opinions, to see how to make it more useful
for everyone. Eventually, I wouldn't be against separating it from
SEXTANTE and making it a QGIS plugin.

For more info, you can have a look at the corresponding documentation:

http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/html/en/docs/user_manual/sextante/commander.html

Many thanks in advance.

Victor.

p.s. Thanks to Paolo for having the idea for this functionality while
we were at the Valmiera Hackfest :-)

Personal opinions in a nutshell:

>From an OGC perspective (yes I'm a member via NIWA's affiliation - once I pay the current bill :-)

This is not a genuine attempt to improve interoperability & support open standards, it is an attempt to undermine open standards & replace existing open standards which are widely used & supported in the community by ratifying standards currently used by one commercial vendor.

I'm currently responsible for implementing federated (interoperable) systems between research agencies & central/regional govt based on OGC standards. It these standards provide for disparate ways of doing the same thing, then "OGC standards compliant: will mean one of two things:
- may or may not work together depending on which OGC standards are supported
- everyone has to support both standards to be OGC compliant.

My organisation has been quoted a few 10's of thousands of $ to develop a CSW service for ESRI datstores because, despite their claimed support for these standards - it is pretty minimal & of limited functionality & use. 

At present we can build federated, interoperable systems including CSW, SOS, WMS, WCS, WFS, etc, and if an agency fails to interoperate, that is their problem. This change would fundamentally reduce, if not destroy, the value of OGC standards to the wider community. 


>From an OSGEO perspective (I'm in the Australia/NZ chapter)

This weakens the FOSS community & strengthens ESRI's place in the global GIS community. OSGEO is there (IMHO) to support FOSS GIS. Agreeing to a change which gives a commercial competitor a strategic advantage - giving them a mandate to let the FOSS community play catchup for a couple of years - is NOT in the best interests of the FOSS community.


>From a FOSS perspective (I'm a council member of the NZOSS),

This is pretty much a repeat of Microsoft's refusal to support an existing, community based XML document/file standard & their forcing of a competing standard on the community, which has been of no value to the user community & created problems for the FOSS community.

We should learn from that fiasco & not make the same mistake again, as much as it in our power to prevent it. 


Regards,

? Brent Wood

 For QGIS it would mean you could create a way to read GeoServices
REST API-compliant data from servers. The specification would be open
and so you could check your implementation against the spec to make
sure your code is creating the right requests.

 However, unless an open-source implementation of the server is
available, you won't be able to test it against a real server unless
you pay up, or are beholden to the good nature of someone who has paid
up.

 Imagine testing the WMS code in Qgis only by inspecting the URL it
creates, and not by whether a WMS server returns the image you were
expecting.

 There's a slight parallel with google and KML. Google bought the
company that originally made Google Earth and so got all the code for
KML files. They went to OGC and got KML made a standard, but, unlike
Esri, released libKML as open source. Perhaps if Esri released their
GeoServices REST API server as open source I think we'd be a bit
happier (once we came round from the shock).

[this discussion is also going on a bit on the osgeo-discuss mailing
list, I've tried to focus on the impact on QGIS here rather than on
the FOSS Geo community at large. Plenty of other people making those
points!]

Hi Victor,

Thank you for another great improvement for QGIS!

It would be interesting keep the Commander fixed somewhere (since it does not take too much space on the screen), to avoid having to always start.

Another improvement would be the ability to run complete commands directly in the Commander, eg GRASS/SAGA/etc algorithms, with input and output paths, parameters and so on.

Thank you very much Victor!

Best regards,
Pedro

Hi all,

I commited a new functionality a few days ago: the SEXTANTE commander.
It is basically a command bar where you can type commands to run
SEXTANTE algorithms, but also QGIS commands, and custom Python
functions.

This is part of SEXTANTE, but since it is a QGIS-wide tool, I would
appreciate comments and opinions, to see how to make it more useful
for everyone. Eventually, I wouldn't be against separating it from
SEXTANTE and making it a QGIS plugin.

For more info, you can have a look at the corresponding documentation:

http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/html/en/docs/user_manual/sextante/commander.html

Many thanks in advance.

Victor.

p.s. Thanks to Paolo for having the idea for this functionality while
we were at the Valmiera Hackfest :-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Union Tool - Ftools/Sextante - How should the real
	result be?
Message-ID: <1367770312662-5051419.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

At present the union tool does not give correct results in sextante/ftools.
After looking at some bug reports, I feel that even in QGIS 1.8, the union
tool was not producing the correct output either attribute-wise or
geometry-wise.

My question is how should the real output be? I have two cases here.

1. Union of a single layer against itself  - 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/asicnvr71vxeaz2/TKVUpdleIX#f:singleLayerInput.png
2. Union between two different layers -
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/asicnvr71vxeaz2/TKVUpdleIX?lst#f:twoLayerInput.png


It looks to me that for case 1, the result could be like below(11 geometries
in total)
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/asicnvr71vxeaz2/TKVUpdleIX?lst#f:singleLayerResult1.png

and for case 2, the result could be like below 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/asicnvr71vxeaz2/TKVUpdleIX?lst#f:twoLayerResult1.png

what do you think? Anybody knows how it looked in 1.8?

Thanks
Vinayan

Great idea Victor.  I remember talking to a few different people about the
same kind of idea a while ago.  Isn't it funny how we all have the same
ideas at the same time :)

Rather then making it a plugin I would prefer to see it built in like the
Python console.  You can still leave it in Python but just load it like we
do with the Python console by using QgsPythonRunner and calling the module.

I like the idea of being able to expand it by using simple Python
functions.  I might be good in the future to have a decorator that has some
basic arg validation or things like checking if any of the arguments are
callable and returning the result.  You could chain methods by handling the
callable switch.

I think we might just need to tweak that combo box a little.  It looks a
bit strange in the notification area that small.

Hi all.
Is there anybody who plans to do specific, wide ranging bug fixing
work. Anybody committed to it?

Hi Victor,
thanks a lot for this. In fact, I would call it (without detracting
from SEXTANTE) QGIS commander, because it can run almost anything, and
that's IMHO his main advantage.
All the best.

IMHO, this would put an additional burden (supporting Yet Another
standard), being at disadvantage with the proprietary equivalent,
without any possible advantage. An arms race among standards in which
we (and I believe the GFOSS world at large) would only have to lose.
If we agree with this, I believe we should raise our voice with OSGeo.
All the best.

sounds good to me. Anyway, the code is there, so please you or someone
else, feel free to take it and put it whenever it fits better. I will
try to improve it a bit and then move it and put it as a built in as
you suggested

Sure, there is plenty of room for improvements... I hope that people
will have new ideas and we can keep improving it for the current basic
version

I went the easy way and used a combo box, but I think that actually it
would be better to just use a tet box with a completer.

Another thing to fi in the UI is that it does not resize when you
resize the QGIS window, so it can leave an ugly bar in the middle of
the screen...

Thanks for your comments!

Hi Borys

(sorry for the lag - I have been on holiday last week)

Not sure how far you got with the implementation, but for the record I
would surely choose the solution 2. It is generally a good idea to
keep core structures separated from Qt model - ideally the model
should be acting just as an adapter to the core data structure. If we
decide to change the plugin manager dialog and model, it will not
affect the way how other parts of QGIS deal with plugins.

	Composer items
Message-ID: <1367835638124-5051541.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi All, 
Last week, i could specify if a composer item had a transparent background
or not. 
Today, I only have a color option for background with a alpha band value.

I couldn't have it opaque . Does alpha value works? 

I think alpha tuning must be used by powerusers only. 90 % user don't know
about alpha bands. I preferred by far a checkbox and a transparency slider. 
Why did they disappear? Did I miss something?

Just a complement. I did get transparency work with alpha band, but it needed
a full refresh of composer to start working correctly. 
Could we simply rename "Alpha channel" to "Alpha channel (transparency)" in
color picker, so that beginners know where to search for new forms of 1.8
options?

Maybe better "Transparency (Alpha channel)".
All the best.

Yes actually I've been doing some work on the SVG library, and removed some
of the symbols I though were looking a bit amateur or old-fashioned.

But it may be that I've been too drastic, and if anyone feels we should
keep them, I'm OK with it too !

Actually there was a concord (well, only a few folks discussed it) we should 
keep the metadata inside manager, as there is no use for it outside, so I'm 
implementing a mixed solution: replacing the messy QgsPluginMetadata and 
QgsPluginItem classes with one robust QgsPluginMetadata, but wih no external 
QgsPluginMetadataRegistry.

It's not very likely other part of QGIS could be interested in plugin metadata 
(except Python plugins, but it's already implemented in PyQGIS).

I leave all the stuff in the src/app directory, what isn't available by API, so 
all communication with Python (eg. adding metadata of available plugins) is 
done by QgsInterface::doSomethingWithManager(). What shhould I do in your 
approac h? Move QgsPluginMetadata, QgsPluginMetadataRegistry to the src/core 
directory? Is it worth the effort? I guess it's the only problem for me to 
adapt your solution. 

Anyway, I'll work on it from Wednesday, so in first step I'll evaluate time 
needed for your suggestion. Considering extremely limited time (both: 
available for me and the delay in QGIS schedule) and the fact I'm not very 
fast in c++ we will see... In the worst case I can go a mixed way to allow 
further improvements without backward API breaks.

Hello all,

Using "Size scale field" does not seam to be  working with centroid fill,
both in 1.8 and master. Is this intended?

Does anyone know if there is a feature\bug ticket for it? I could not find

Hi Mathieu,

thanks for your answer.

I don't think it's the same problem (although I have noticed it too), as
that issue only affect master, whether the issue I'm talking about affect
both 1.8 and master, but only in centroid fill (in polygon layers), in
point layer it works well.

Not sure if it's a bug, a not implemented feature, or simply a not intended
one.

Agreed. ticket filed here: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7771

if someone has some time to take it, that would save me lots of efforts in
the "hotline" period after 1.8 to 2.0 switch.

Please don?t remove symbols. Even if they are ugly. If people are using them for a while there will be a lot of projects that will be ruined and need to be rebuilt ?

Yes actually I've been doing some work on the SVG library, and removed some of the symbols I though were looking a bit amateur or old-fashioned.

But it may be that I've been too drastic, and if anyone feels we should keep them, I'm OK with it too !

Yeah can we have those back.  People are free to remove the svgs if they
don't like but I wouldn't remove them unless there is technical reason.

I was asking that question on this thread :

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Ideas-on-the-SVG-symbols-library-td5040508.html#a5046486

Maybe I didn't emphasize enough on the deletion of symbols...

IMO, the most elegant solution is to keep only the good-looking symbols so
we provide a simple and consistent library, and then to provide a link on
the website to download the unmodified 1.8 symbol library in case one needs
to keep full backwards compatibility (it's quite easy to install : you just
have to replace the SVG folder in your installation folder).

The whole pull request already breaks backwards compatibility with all
other symbols, since by removing their background, the may become
unreadable on most of the maps...

So if the priority is the keep old projects looking the same rather than
having a clean and consistent library, the best is not to change the svg
library at all.

(just as an illustration, do you really think it's pertinent to keep this
in the library ? :

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Could ubuntugis PPA be a recommended repository
 for QGIS 2.0 on Ubuntu ?
Message-ID: <5187A90F.3090807@gmail.com>

Hi,
I wonder if ubuntugis PPA could be a recommended and only one repository
for QGIS 2.0 on Ubuntu instead of distribution packaged version and
package from 'http://qgis.org/debian'. Reasons are following:

1. Currently there are many installation sources for the same Ubuntu
platform which is confusing, providing different features and causing
the mess when people trying to switch between them.

2. Distribution package in Ubuntu is outdated, I doubt anyone i using it.

3. Package from 'http://qgis.org/debian' is build with outdated
dependencies, at least often missing upstream fixes from maintaining
releases and when the time is going on they are older and older.

4. UbuntuGIS can provide a solid platform for GIS packages maintained by
skilled Debian and Ubuntu devs, can quickly apply fixes from maintaining
releases of all dependencies and QGIS itself when provided by upstream.
UbuntuGIS can upgrade all packages from time to time to keep version up
to date.

5. Using uniform and only one package source can lower maintainig costs
either to build and test packages and also when trying to solve bugs.

5. PPAs could depend on each other so one can create separate PPA for
1.x version and separate for version 2.x which will depend on some
general PPA providing all build dependencies.

6. Using UbuntuGIS in more massive scale can bring more credit and
satisfaction for people who maintain it.



What needs to be done ?:
1. Fine tuned Debian 'control' file to prevent conflicting installation
of packages after upgrading from distribution packages to UbuntuGIS
(this is the case for example in GDAL)

2. More clearly described relation between ubuntugis-stable and
ubuntugis-unstable repositories (when the packages move from unstable to
stable ...)

3. Maybe creation of more complex PPA architecture for development,
staging and production.


Looking for you opinions.

Recommended: ok.
Only: why?

I don't see the problem with a less intrusive version (ie. qgis on plain
ubuntu) and a more intrusive version (ie. qgis on ubuntugis).

Switching between the same versions from different repositories might be a
problem, but I suppose that doesn't happen often.

Maintaining both versions wasn't a big problem in the past, so I don't expect it
be come one in future.

The packages are only built on release, with the current dependencies at that
point - and only updated, when manually when necessary.  But that also applies
to both repositories.

0. Report those problems.

Yes, that would be nice to know - I only upload to ubuntugis-unstable ;)

Ubuntu distribution packages stick with 1.7 version which is obsolete.

Maybe a bug fixing could be easier when you deal for example with lesser
GDAL versions. Also when a time goes on distribution libraries goes
older and more version dependent workarounds must be provided (for
example GDAL 1.10 has better support for PostGIS raster and SpatiaLite)

PPA build could be less error prone than self made PBuilder. I am often
not sure if my pbuilder updated build deps when building packages
depending each other.

Yes, I am going to fix them in my PPA and send a patch. But I am not
sure where reports for PPAs should be submitted.

What I am missing for PPAs is some kind of wiki where these informations
could be placed.


Jurgen, thanks for your Debian/Ubuntu packaging.

That's a function of inheriting official packages from upstream Debian. 
Get newer versions into Debian and it trickles down.

I think new users get confused about which one they really want and the 
reality is most actually want the Master builds because of features (but 
that's impractical because of stability). So we should make one of the 
options the Recommended. For me this has always been ubuntugis-unstable, 
primarily because the newer gdal builds support the formats people are 
trying to work with and some of the nastier bugs occur there (if you 
can't read/write your data everything else is pointless).

Unless it's an error in the DebianGIS version which we pull from their 
git repo. I need to go looking for where to report those besides mailing 
list and IRC.

That is the correct place. Sadly the naming convention borrowed from 
Debian causes nothing but confusion.
Testing - where to put stuff when you're not sure if it will work.
Unstable - where you put stuff you want people to use.
Stable - where we move things to from Unstable when a newer version is 
staged to go into unstable, so that if you want to stick to the older 
one you can by switching to stable. Or if you need to get the older 
version or older deps for some reason (regressions).

Hm, if it is like this, it is really sooo confusing. Is there any
possibility to improve this workflow ?

Yeah that ain't pretty...

Personally I like Oliver's patch and I think we should clean up house
for 2.0. Keeping compatibility is useful but most of my project files
from 1.8 are already broken to some degree and I would prefer we do
all the big changes in 2.0 and then become more conservative in
subsequent 2.x releases.

the situation with qgis in debian has been the same for years.

if you need something sync'd in the DebianGIS side of things,
let me know, &/or ping the DebianGIS mailing list. Frankie is
usually on IRC too.

many of you already know this well, but since there is divergence here
I thought to explain the Debian convention anyway for those that don't,

> Testing - where to put stuff when you're not sure if it will work.

in the Debian world that's the "experimental" branch, not "testing".
"testing" is automatically populated from unstable pkgs a fixed amount
of time after it has been uploaded, with no (or at least fewer) bugs vs.
the last version, and no other dependency conflicts.

> Unstable - where you put stuff you want people to use.

in the Debian world it's simply where new & untested packages get
uploaded. I would not recommend for a new user to use Debian's
unstable branch unless they knew enough to dig themselves out of
trouble. (it's called "sid" [from Toy Story] for a reason, 'cause it
breaks stuff)

in the Debian world "stable" simply the "testing" branch after some time
(often ~6 months) of new version freeze, which then gets blessed with
a version number. Similar to Ubuntu LTS release cycles, often ~18 months
between versions.

The last Debian/stable was released two days ago, and so as of now
the unstable branch is finally unfrozen for new packages. It's sad that
1.8.0 is not in it, but there's no magic pool of people to do it for us.

I am completely on Tims side..
Cleaning up the house for 2.0 is very important - probably we would not get
any chance that soon anymore..

So I would also suggest that those "old" symbols can be provided as a
download somewhere for people that would really like to use "old" symbols
(or have to) ..
It's just the question where to communicate it to that persons..

kind regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Creating a pool of maps showcasing QGIS upcoming
	v2.0 features
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=oWfncE_oM-pLOqarq86EXQdqXxZEbsbGsAzyQqgwmaig@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings all,

As we are fast approaching the day QGIS v2.0 will be release, I thought it
might be useful to create a public pool of nice maps showcasing some of the
new features that'll be available in v2.0. That should help writing release
notes (as visual examples of features will be readily available) as well as
being a nice PR effort to attract new users.

I believe quite a few of us QGIS users, as well as developers, have by now
moved on to using QGIS 1.9 to produce maps. As such, we might already have
a pretty good number of already-made maps exemplifying what's coming in
v2.0. Anita has already posted a couple of nice blog posts with photos, so
did Nyall. It'd be a matter of regrouping the maps under one umbrella.

A Flickr group has been set up over here:
http://www.flickr.com/groups/2244553 at N22/

Nathan and I already uploaded a couple of maps. The concept would be to add
maps and a description highlighting the new features (see
http://www.flickr.com/photos/60284107 at N00/8715653609/in/pool-2244553 at N22for
example).

To upload to the Flickr group, it requires a Flickr account, which
shouldn't be too troublesome as one can link its yahoo or gmail account to
log in.

Is this something you guys would be interested in participating to?

I think it's a great idea, hence why I have already added a map of my own :)

This could also come in handy for local user groups to do Map Walls by
having some images to pick from, full credits given of course.

I would ask though that no one upload screens shots of the application
itself.  Keep screenshots for the manual.  This is meant to be just maps
that have been created using QGIS.

Nathan

Yep, Nathan's right, let's keep this to rendered maps (via "Save image
as..." or the Composer). There's plenty to show there :)

Great initiative.
Am I right that without logging in, only one map can be seen?
All the best.

I did some experiments with the new SIP API with the gdaltools core 
plugin.

It's completely untested and incomplete, but if somebody intends to 
update the gdal plugin, he should have a look at this diff before 
giving it a go.

I believe photos posted within Flickr Groups can be seen without need to
log in (see for e.g. http://www.flickr.com/groups/theleague/pool/). That
being said, it doesn't seem to work for the Flickr QGIS Group set up
earlier today. It might have to do an incubation time required before
Flickr opens the pool to everyone? I'll investigate reason why this is
happening today or tomorrow.

In the meantime, feel free add member status to group to see the
(hopefully) growing number of maps. :)

Alright, the problem is with my account, it's been inactive for too long
and it's considering my photos as suspect for the next few days. Nathan has
an active account, hence his map(s) showing when not a member.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] composer export fails for maps with label shadows
Message-ID: <1367912435109-5051774.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, This morning I tried to export in pdf some multimaps composers. 
I encounter an error - not crashing qgis, but leaving composer blank - on
maps using new dropshadows for labels. %Maybe it's related to blending or
only shadows. I switched back to buffer, and it works OK, even A0. 
Anyone confirms?

If we can get hold of the old symbology lib than that's fine by me. But please don't make us and others rebuild their entire organization's cartography just because you don't like the symbols.

Yeah that ain't pretty...

Personally I like Oliver's patch and I think we should clean up house for 2.0. Keeping compatibility is useful but most of my project files from 1.8 are already broken to some degree and I would prefer we do all the big changes in 2.0 and then become more conservative in subsequent 2.x releases.

Tim

in my case, it selected the attribute with the max value, but it did not autofill the
max value.
I think the correct behaviour would be:
* the user should select the attribute(s) to plot (so this should go to the top of
the form, as it is now the only thing the user has necessarily to deal with)
* the max value should be autofilled with the highest value of the variables selected

Done, thanks a lot. Much more usable now, I believe.

another option wouold be to leave all the SVGs, but move the ugly ones in a
"deprecated" category.

Hi Victor,

I'm testing 1.1, could you tell me how to switch back the modeler to 
the advanced GUI in the modeler ? I've not found a parameter to do so in 
the settings.

I appreciate that the boxes are now smaller and are directly showing 
the edit/del tools but I found the arrows to be confusing, they're now 
passing behind the boxes and often have to be read from left to right.

Regards,
Jean-Roc

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Creating a pool of maps showcasing QGIS upcoming	v2.0 features

Greetings all,

As we are fast approaching the day QGIS v2.0 will be release, I thought it might be useful to create a public pool of nice maps showcasing some of the new features that'll be available in v2.0. That should help writing release notes (as visual examples of features will be readily available) as well as being a nice PR effort to attract new users.


I believe quite a few of us QGIS users, as well as developers, have by now moved on to using QGIS 1.9 to produce maps. As such, we might already have a pretty good number of already-made maps exemplifying what's coming in v2.0. Anita has already posted a couple of nice blog posts with photos, so did Nyall. It'd be a matter of regrouping the maps under one umbrella.


A Flickr group has been set up over here: http://www.flickr.com/groups/2244553 at N22/

Nathan and I already uploaded a couple of maps. The concept would be to add maps and a description highlighting the new features (see http://www.flickr.com/photos/60284107 at N00/8715653609/in/pool-2244553 at N22 for example).


To upload to the Flickr group, it requires a Flickr account, which shouldn't be too troublesome as one can link its yahoo or gmail account to log in. 

Is this something you guys would be interested in participating to?

Can you give me a few more details about this? Do you get an error message, or just the missing elements in the pdf file? A day or so ago I added a warning message when pdf exporting a composer view with blend modes to prompt you to export as raster, did you get this warning when exporting?

Sorry, yes it's what I meant. I did not saw the list at the bottom of 
the toolbox, I thought this option was somewhere in the SEXTANTE 
configuration :)

No, the smaller boxes are great ! my personal suggestions would be :
- to focus on one linear way of reading the screen (top to bottom, left 
to right)
- put in/out on opposite side of the box
- use of zigzag/besier lines instead of straight ones

Hi Victor,

I'm testing 1.1, could you tell me how to switch the modeler to the 
advanced GUI in the modeler ?

The smaller boxes are good, showing directly the edit/del functions is 
also a good thing but now I found the arrows to more difficul to read as 
they often pass behind the boxes and go left to right.

Would it be possible to avoid the modeler's windows getting a 
unswitchable focus ? Sometime I would like to get back to the main to 
check a simple thing like the name of a column without closing the 
modeler, open it back and reload the model.

Regards,
Jean-Roc

Hi to all,
when I add a new feature to a vector layer (from file) using a custom UI
file ("Attribute editor layout" set to "Provide ui-file") a new row full of
NULL values is added to Attribute Tables. It doesn't happen with an
autogenerated UI.
The ui file is correct.
QGIS is 1.9.0 rev 12b39d6
Does it happen only to me?

You mean the list of algorithms classified by providers (SAGA, GRASS,
etc)?? The modeler uses the same configuration as the toolbox, so you
should change it in the toolbox. Maybe I shoud add that in the modeler
as well, so it can be changed from there...

I agree that the interface now might be less clear in some cases... Do
you think that it would be interesting to have an option to use the
older modeler?

Thanks!

fine, +1 for me. As for the eventual GUI freeze, I'd be in favour of raising an
exception for this.

Message-ID: <5188F192.5050609@gmail.com>

Hi all,

As some of you know, I have created a plugin to do rollbacks on postgres 
layers using the Postgres Audit Trigger 91 plus [0].

The plugin is called Postgres 91 plus auditor is made for QGIS 1.9+ and 
is now flagged as experimental.

I wrote a short howto [1].

If some of you are ok to test the plugin (maybe not on production data!) 
and to give me some feedback on the plugin,  I would be very pleased!

Thanks a lot,

Denis

Can you give me a few more details about this? Do you get an error
message, or just the missing elements in the pdf file? A day or so ago
I added a warning message when pdf exporting a composer view with
blend modes to prompt you to export as raster, did you get this
warning when exporting?

The problem I see here is, that
a) you don't know when the user finished selecting attributes (unless 
he's clicking ok, that's what I do now)
b) if you change the field after every change in the attribute 
selection, a manually defined value may be overwritten

The way around this would IMO be a checkbox
[x] Use maximum value

I don't know what the current release plan is (GUI freeze, as fas as I 
remember, should already be in place?)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Displacement and SLD's
Message-ID: <CAA-xNcW-bOujTptxnV96RqUSoz1ptwZjgmcjjxKAktEeZU-37Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,
  We've contracted some work on GeoServer to try and get the SLD 1.1
"displacement" tag implemented, because we wanted to replicate the sort of
results you can get in QGIS 1.8 here with the SVG filled green areas:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/OS_Styles

Those are QML files, but QGIS allows them to be exported as SLD.

So my question is - how should that style be created with SLD's? Does QGIS
does it "properly"? Andrea (who's implementing it), has noted that
displacement alone can't do this, so has proposed a solution which would
work, but would require an SLD file different from the one that QGIS 1.8
exported. His proposed solution is:
https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS-5794?focusedCommentId=324800#comment-324800

What is the QGIS solution to this? Does it implement it at all from an SLD
file? When I try and load the SLD it saves back into QGIS, I encounter a
QGIS bug (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7759), so can't actually confirm it.

I ask because I think one common implementation concept would be better
than multiple divergent incompatible ones as QGIS is used by some people to
style SLD's for GeoServer.

Thanks,
Jonathan

Hi all,

I'm new to this community and starting to learn QGis. I've seen in the
documentation some c++ code examples to work with QGis libraries. In fact
I've seen in github[1] the code itself, but it seems quite outdated.

Is there a place where I can find updated (qgis 1.8) examples?  I've seen
too in stack overflow references to http://blog.qgis.org but it's not
active.

Any hints?
Thank you.

Hi all.
As someone may have noticed, now forms (.ui) can be stored in DB. This is IMHO a Good
Thing, because people using PG can have all the elements needed in the same place,
instead of being scattered in several files.
However, forms can only be associated to a layer as a file (from the layer properties
window), not as tables. Alternatively, it would be good to incorporate the .ui xml
into the style, but in this way there is not an easy way to edit the form (Designer
requires a file).
A simple, yet not very elegant, solution to this would be to add an option to the
Load UI menu, to be able to load it (for PG layers) also from a table, perhaps
applying it as a default if present. Additionally, loading an UI file should
(automatically?) add it to the table.
Does anybody have a better suggestion, or see a problem in this approach?
All the best.

Hi again, 
I'm working on a huge map (for map contest ;-)) : A0 printing with 3 submaps
, raster , lots of complex labels.

Adding new layers (postgis)  is often very long and often doesn't lead to
real opening in project. Nevertheless, GUI is very responsive, probably with
new API design effects. 

Anyone confirms? (If yes, this is a blocker)

R?gis

My idea was to replace (or complement) the max value button with a 
checkbox. If you check the box, the field gets grayed out and synced to 
the max value, whenever
* in case of histogram: the attribute list changes
* in case of circular diagrams: the scale field changes

This way, a user action is required to transfer the control of this 
field from user responsibility to software responsibility and the 
current state is communicated transparently.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Preventing bad raster filenames - advice?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiTzmVqCgKZakPtUHDP01490ig-yX0=_CiA-LokN=aiFA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm after some quick advice - in investigating
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7624 I've tracked the crash down to users
entering a destination raster filename without a path (only occurs
under Windows). If they use the "..." button next to the filename
field then the full path is correctly filled in and no crash occurs.

While the bug report is specifically for the heatmap plugin I've since
noticed this behaviour applies to some other areas too, such as the
raster calculator dialog.

I'm thinking it's probably best to make the file name edits read only,
so the only way to choose a destination file is by clicking the ...
button and using the file chooser dialog. This will force the
destination filename to be a full absolute path. (After all, if a user
enters a relative path for the destination there's no way of
identifying what they'd like it to be relative to..! The input file?
The project?)

Before I make this change, does anyone have any ideas on alternative
ways to handle this situation?

Nyall

Hi Nyall,
thanks for taking this; you jit a soft spot, saving rasters is implemented in
different ways within QGIS, something that has to be corrected sooner or later.
I agree that browsing rather than typing the filename is a good practice.
I do not agree this should be made compulsory: most dialogs remember the last used
dir, so just changing the filename is faster than browsing.
IMHO, better fix the crash upstream.
All the best.

Hi all,

is it possible to change composer map extent (and scale) programmatically without changing its width and height? When using setNewExtent() method width and height of the composer map frame
changed and overlaps with other composer elements, so resulting
image looks differently from template.

no way in this moment, you could use Displacement tag with SVG images
created ad-hoc, i.e. with some empty space around the original image.

IMHO the displacement shouldn't be used in that way, as empty space between
graphics, though the SE1.1 specs doesn't define a proper tag to do that...
In fact the Graphic->Displacement tag is already used in other contexts
with the meaning of "distance in pixels from the hot-spot", not as space
around the graphic symbol neither as offset between neighbour graphics.

I would define 2 new tags as GraphicFill tag's children, like it's already
done in the GraphicStroke tag.
GraphicStroke has Gap and InitialGap, we should use the same approach.

Right, but at the same time, the SE does not say how to use it in
GraphicFill, so one is free to interpret.
For example, GeoServer does not need SE 1.1 gap and InitialGap in graphic
strokes because it uses the dasharray for that, another thing that is
already in the SLD 1.0 spec and that had no proper definition of usage in
combination with graphicstroke (moreover, it's more flexible than the
simple gap syntax, one can create irregular symbol along lines, something
like two circle, space, one circle, space, repeat).

Extending SLD is a minefield, what happens if OGC releases a corrigendum
that adds the same tags, but with a slightly different semantic?
Also, every extension done that way needs modifications to the parsers and
modification to the programming interfaces, something that in
GeoTools/GeoServer is allowed only on the devel series (the one that spawns
a new stable branch every six months)

The way we handle extensions in GeoServer is to use a VendorOptions tag,
which can accomodate key/value pairs, for example, in this case
we could have something like:

<PolygonSymbolizer>
   ...
  <VendorOption key="gapAbove">10</VendorOption>
  <VendorOption key="gapBelow">5</VendorOption>
  <VendorOption key="gapRight">5</VendorOption>
  <VendorOption key="gapLeft">15</VendorOption>
</PolygonSymbolizer>

Cheers
Andrea

yes better to make sure the filename contains path when file dialog is not
used.

Not at all, it says:

""" The GraphicFill element both indicates that a stipple-fill repeated
graphic will be used and specifies the fill graphic. [...] A ?graphic? can
be defined very informally as ?a little picture?. The appearance of the
graphic is defined with the embedded Graphic element, which is discussed in
Subclause 11.3.2. """

so the meaning of Graphic elements is supposed to be the same for both
GraphicFill and GraphicStroke.

It's surely more flexible, but I've few inventiveness. For me a dash is a
dash, so those dash-something elements should be used to render dashes, not
graphic strokes. From my side I would draw both a graphic stroke and a dash
line, BTW the XML schema allows to put GraphicStroke and SvgParameters
toghether without explain how it must behave.

The same that would happen if OGC defines what dasharray/dashoffset
elements must be used for.
I agree with you extending SLD should be avoided, additions to GraphicFill
tag could happen soon:
""" Additional parameters for the GraphicFill may be provided in the future
to provide more control the exact style of filling. """

We do the same in QGIS, and even the tag name it's the same! ;)

s/key/name/

We already have a <VendorOption name="distance">20,15</VendorOption> that
handle the distance between graphics in fill, but we are open to a shared
naming convention, as far as possible.

Doh, I'm having a bad day, it's name in GeoServer as well

Now that I think about it, we already have a "graphic-margin" option that
is used in labelling + label shield,
to set the distance between elastic shields and the label,
which has a very similar syntax and allows 1 to 4 values, like css margin
does:
http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp

The name seems suitable for the fill as well, since in the end we're
talking about a graphic again.
Is it something QGis could use?
Otherwise I could have GeoServer interpret distance as an alias of
graphic-margin.

Cheers
Andrea

Hi Denis,
some time ago I wrote my own PG History tracking functions [1] which I
never made production ready. I still see some advantages of my approach to
'PgVersion' of Horts Duster and 'Audit trigger', but it is another story.
However, 'Audit trigger' seems nice and I am interested very much to Your
plugin.

I have tried plugin on latest master QGIS, Ubuntu 12.04 and very simple
PostGIS polygon layer. After choosing layer in 'logged action layer
chooser' some window just blinks and returns me again to 'logged action
layer chooser'.
Also both items in  Plugins -> Postgres 91 plus Auditor brings me to the
same dialog window 'logged action layer chooser'.

What I am doing wrong ?

Paolo, that issue has been fixed, thanks to flickr's quick response. The
flickr group now shows all six maps without need to be a member.

Thanks to Anita for having posted some of her QGIS 2.0-dependent maps in
the last few days.

Hi Alexander

Afaik if you set the new extent such that the width/height ration of the 
extent is the same as the item's one, it won't change size.
Another possibility is to set the new extent and call setSceneRect() 
just after that.

For the scale: QgsComposerMap::setNewScale should not change the item 
widht/height.

Regards,
Marco

How can I update the map in my composer, using python?

My python script changes some layer properties and exports my composer 
afterwards. But I cannot get my map updated before exporting, so my 
exported file still shows the "old" map.

I tried a lot, including:

QgsComposerMap.update()

QgsComposition.update()


but it doesn't work.

Can anybody help??

hi, in master version it's not possible to edit a layer when it has a

is this bug planned to be resolved before official release of 2.0 version?

It is classified as a blocker, so it should be.
Of course this depends from the work and input of everybody.

Hi,
Not sure if this is a developer or user question.  Should be very basic
for Developers!!!

I am running  opensuse 12.3-64 and have done a pull on the QGIS
repository as per http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html#toc9.

I ran cmake several times to get all the (reported) dependencies
installed.

On running make I get the following error:

On my machine there is a file /usr/lib64/libpq.so.  Is this file that
is required?  
Does a new version need to built?  
How do I set it up so the make file finds it? 
Is a symlink all I need to do?

Thanks in advance

Sorry for the late reply. The idea of having inputs on one side and
outputs on the other one is good. I will wok on changing that, since
it looks like a good usability improvement.

The window is already not supposed to be modal, so I will also have a
look at that

thanks for your help!

Hi Victor,

If you can, have a look to Blender's node editor for guidelines. It has 
some nice features which ease the use of complex models (such as visual 
grouping, nested group, zoom in/out, color scheme, etc.).

http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Ref/Release_Notes/2.67/Node_Editor

regards,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] setSubsetOfAttributes() doean't work?
Message-ID: <20130513115032.6a62ea187f613f9c71994642@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I try to get features within some rectangle, and want to get only 
some attributes without geometries. So I use next code:

request = QgsFeatureRequest()
request.setFilterRect(self.extent)
request.setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.NoGeometry)
request.setSubsetOfAttributes([0, 3, 6])
f = QgsFeature()
fit = layer.getFeatures(request)
while fit.nextFeature(f):
  attrs = f.attributes()
  # process attributes
  ...

but in attrs valiable I always get *all* feature attributes. Is this
bug or maybe I miss something?

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] changing srs.db with coordinate system updater
	Plugin
Message-ID: <20130513104314.4f15bb96@nature.speedport.ip>

Hi,

for QGIS 1.8 I tried to update the srs.db file
in /usr/share/qgis/ressources/ with the coordinate system updater Plugin. I
see the changed crs in tbl_srs and the former original crs is stored in
srids4restore - so the plugin seems to work. 

The problem is, that the projection according to the new parameters does not
work, although I can see the parameters in QGIS. QGIS still seems to use the
former parameters. 

If I define a user defined projection in QGIS with the new parameters, the
layer is projected with the new parameters.

Does anybody has a solution for this? 

Thanks 
Otto

Message-ID: <CAOJAE5rn1p=u_khx8pAR8Yw-TEyj5NwN3a4MoFdWF3txKxmZqA@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to implement a plugin for identifying environmental outliers
in point data, and I thought the scattergram plugin would be a useful
starting point. I have installed PyQwt, but both versions of the
scattergram plugin crash QGIS on my system (Ubuntu 12.10, PyQt4 v.4.9.3-4,
PyQwt5 v.5.2.1). Tested on QGIS 1.8 and master.

I'm assuming this is tied to problems with PyQwt5, but before I dig too
deep, I thought I'd check if anyone else is having problems with the plugin?

Thanks,
Rudi

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding labels
Message-ID: <519101A6.7050307@heurisis.eu>

Hello,

I am not sure to be on the right place to ask my question. If not, I beg 
your pardon.

I am trying the write a Python script that :
- load a set of shapefile ;
- automatically add labels based on a field ;
- set the color, the size, etc. of my points.

For the moment, I can load the shapefiles. I also succeded in labeling 
but I am not able to move the labels manually once created. Here is my 
piece of code for labeling :
         def add_label(self, layer):
                 layer.enableLabels(1)
                 myLabel = layer.label()
                 myLabel.setLabelField( QgsLabel.Text, 17)
                 myLabel.layerAttributes().setAlignment(4)

Is there an other way of doing this ? Is there samples of code ?

Thank you in advance.

Beno?t

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Context help - locale (Consider country?)
Message-ID: <51910357.1070708@gmx.ch>

Hi,

The context help (e.g. click on the ? in the attribute table) does take
language AND country into account. If a help file for this very specific
combination does not exist, it falls back to the en_US help, which is
not always the best choice.

E.g.
de_CH should rather fallback to de_DE instead of en_US.

I see the following possibilities:
 * keep the lang_COUNTRY suffix for these files and in case the specific
country does not exist, just take a random file with the same lang (e.g.
-de_CH will then use -de_AT because of the same -lang part and listed
before -de_DE).
 * always provide a fallback file (e.g. -de_CH would then search for
-de_CH, and if not existent for -de which it will find, because the file
-de_DE has been copied or symlinked there.)
 * drop the COUNTRY suffix (only look for -de and if that does not exist
take -en)

I'm not really an expert in translation, so I would go for option 3. But
I'm sure somebody will discourage me and tell me, that he wants to
provide a native swiss-german translation as soon as there are official
grammar rules :-)

Cheers
Matthias

Another possibility:
Do something like I did with the grass modules, ie. generate cpp-code from
en-US version and let linguist pick those up.  And let the rest work as usual.

I've started to do that (ie. create a QHash for QgsExpression and something for
the context_helps).   I'll also replace the help viewer with something in gui
(we use webkit in qgis anyway).

That way we would also not have to worry that the context and function help
gets translated at all (AFAIK it's currently in the normal process) and also
see when something needs to be updated (that doesn't happen now either).

Hey all,

There is now a poll on the logo site
http://99designs.com.au/logo-design/vote-aqu952.

We need to pick a design that we like, or at least something that would
like to extend further.

Please vote and leave any comments.

At the moment we only have 2 days. I will ask for a few more days, but act
like we only have two days.

P.S Sorry I would have done this early I have just been busy with work and
uni.

Regards,

Remember everyone you are also voting for something that should look good
as a icon, not just a logo.

There are now two polls:

http://99designs.com.au/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/poll/aqu952

http://99designs.com.au/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/poll/ls2bf1

I have to run the second poll in order even out the playing field as I
missed some of Larry's in the pick and the ones I did where not a fair
comparison.  As I can't not close a poll (I have requested it from
the company but not word yet), or edit a poll (which is really dumb and
makes this harder for me) I have to run two.

Regards,
Nathan

Is there still a possibility to keep the the present logo? If so, I'd allow to 
vote for it too (if not in the pool, at least here on the ml). IMHO none of 
them is really worth the change - I'd rather cancel the competition and hire a 
good proffesional designer.

Vote on the second if your are only going to vote once. The second one

Now that you've mentioned this I'm noticing it all the time. I've

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster drawing style always set to single band gray
Message-ID: <20130514133405.cf7f0717f216c29fc5484b1f@gmail.com>

Hi all,

seems something broken in raster subsystem. Method drawingStyle() of
QgsRasterLayer class always returns 1 despite which rendering style
is set via properties or qml file.

Steps to reproduce:
 1. load singleband gray raster
 2. open layer properties and in Style tab set "Render type" to
    Singleband pseudocolor
 3. add several classes and assign colors for them, apply changes
 4. close layer properties
 5. open Python console and run next code (raster layer should be
    active):

    l = iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
    l.drawingStyle()

This always returns value 1, but for Singleband pseudocolor it
must be 2.

Should I file ticket?

If you are using a master branch build, you can script the new labeling
engine via Python. The following test script has some sample code [1].

Hello,

I read some posts about how to import 'delimited text' using plugin in
QGIS.

I have plenty of .csv files to cope with. Do you know how to cope with it
using python script ? Thank you very much for the help !

I had to cope with the same problem a few weeks ago. Have you seen this

For the moment, I am using the 1.8 version of qgis. Will it work ? 
Otherwise, I can download the latest branch build as suggested.

Many thanks Larry !

I eventually installed the weekly build. I used the test script you 
mentionned and it works great ! I had struggled for two days.

Thank you again.

You can use both the "delimited text" or the OGR providers. In my
experience, the delimited text plugin is more flexible (for example,
you can exclude lines at the beginning of the file) but it has some
issues in QGIS 1.8 (see http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7493)

As Beno?t said you should check the cookbook. Also, you might find
useful the examples I've included in issue 7493.

Hi,

together with Diethard Jansen we found that the plugin we wrote seems to
work. But if we use the plugin and the crs is updated in srs.db the new
parameters are not used. But the parameters are used, if I create a user
defined crs.
 
Maybe I am missing something? Does QGIS save/use crs information somewhere
else?

Any help/information about this is welcome.

Regards
Otto

I realise this is late in the game, but I've got strong reservations
about how well #50 will work as an app icon. It's going to need
substantial changes to create a good icon from it. My main concerns
are:

1. The solid near-black color doesn't work well for an icon. If you
compare it against a selection of well-designed icons, the solid color
looks flat and lifeless:
http://imgur.com/5Xmd6TA (quick and nasty photoshop job, ignore the
artifacts). You can also see that having a solid dark color like this
doesn't work against a dark background. At the minimum it will need
some outline/shading/shadow/highlighting effects to bring it to life
and modernize it.

2. The shapes in the "Q" will also need to be modified to work for
smaller icon sizes - directly scaling down the logo causes the icon to
almost disappear at small sizes: http://imgur.com/F3IOTE1 . This may
be fixable by increasing the thickness of the circle and exaggerating
the size of the green arrow for the icon, but again, it's going to
require a lot of tweaking.

My final concern is that we haven't seen a version of this logo
without "Quantum" in it yet. It's hard to get a good idea of the final
product when a major change like this still needs to be done.

Again, I realise I'm voicing these concerns late, but I thought I'd
point them out in case it influences anyone's voting!

Just in case anyone was wondering, 5 means that you really like it, not that you really don't like it (the system here strips out some content on those pages, so I guess maybe everyone else can see some sort of explanation of that, but I can't).
And if your browser gives you a choice of 0-5 rather than 1-5, it looks like 0 means you don't want to rate it, whereas 1 means that you really don't like it.

Alister,

In Chrome there is a popup when you hover over each start with 1 being the
lowest and 5 the highest.  0 does in indeed mean you don't want to rate.
There really should be a impartial result so that you can say you are on
the fence.  Such as life.

Hi Otto

As far as I understand if you change an existing crs in the srs.db you have to change it also in the /usr/share/proj/epsg (.\share\proj\epsg) file. And I had to delete the existing crs definition in /usr/share/gdal/pcs.csv. Probably you can change the definition here too (instead of deleting) but since it does not contain the parameters itself but only the ids of  the values I just deleted them.

Regards
Stefan

Hi !

yeah I like the bottom one of #394 .. but it's not in the voting ..
Nathan has a really hard job to do to do this ..

>From his screenshots I have to say .. although the design is simple and
clean it does not fit as an icon ..
I wonder if we should not do such photoshopped screenshots from all the
designs that made it to the last round .. and I wonder why #394 has not
been considered ..
taking the facts from nathan I'd say #420 would give a nice Icon .. but it
is not even rated .. :(

Probably we all now know what the "User" would like ..
But I would suggest to let the PSC go through ALL of the suggestions again
considering the design of the User-voted .. and choose a cool one
(but that would be probably after the contest).. winning does not
necessarily mean that we HAVE to choose it or does it?

kind regards
Werner

BTW, Tim, could you please publish a new roadmap to QGIS2? Things are slipping,
better rework it.
All the best.

Hello all,

Thanks, Rafael.

Following Rafael's post and QGIS cookbook, I solved the issue.

Attached is my script to read and convert .csv to .shp. I would like to
share with you. Thanks for the help.

Definitely the best possibility, because it fits best to the rest of 
the UI translation.
Can you give me a hint on where to find what you have done with the 
grass modules?

+1 for an embedded webkit widget somewhere. Right now the help  is a 
separate process and I see no reason for or benefit of this, but the 
behavior that it does not close when exiting the application seems to 
be a disadvantage. As well as the recent hack to the paths get it to 
run properly from the build directory because it resides in lib/.
You said you have started. Is that code already pushed to master?

scripts/update_ts_files.sh (ie. scripts/qgm2cpp.pl)

I think we also still need something alike for the algorithm descriptions in
sextante - didn't look into that.

I now do.  Spawning a modeless dialog from modal dialogs doesn't work well...
I noticed only after moving the helpviewer into qgscontexthelp. So I reverted
that ;)

But I made the helpviewer read the help texts from stdin and qgscontexthelp to
write it to the helpviewer.

There is now a cmake recipes that creates a cpp file each for function and
context help from the -en_US version in resources and that is integrated
automatically into the ts file using the normal process.

I also added the non-en_US versions of the help files into the respective ts
files.  They are still there, although they aren't used anymore.

So now if there are updates to the help, only the en-US versions should be
added or updated - and the translations are in the ts files.

Drawing style was left in raster layer from 1.8 where rendering was
done by raster layer and each DrawingStyle had rendering method in
raster layer. In master, rendering is done by renderers set by
setRenderer() and you can set even your custom renderer. There is no 1
to 1 mapping between renderer and drawing style.

My suggestion is to remove mDrawingStyle, drawingStyle() and
setDrawingStyle() completely and keep only
setRendererForDrawingStyle() for simple renderer setting. OK Marco?

How / why do you need to use drawing style getter? Can you use the
renderer directly?

An option to get the old symbols should suffice, right? Instructions on what needs to be done with these symbols for each platform might also be helpful.

I've been producing pdf output maps from Composer using labels with drop shadows during the past week. Can you share the specific blend settings or, better, create a simple example qgs file you can share?

Well, even though I agree with the new changes, it will be a harsh
situation for those who have used the deprecated ones in their projects.
And, kind of rude (from the users standpoint) to force the change and
require a manual rebuild of existing projects.

There are still some issues regarding the new symbol setup:

1) IMO, the deprecation of many symbols is fine, if they are moved to a
'deprecated' folder. Such a folder may or may not be part of the SVG search
paths, but still in source and installed. Then, just like when you move or
restructure a web site, create some path rewrite rules that will
auto-update a <2.0 project and rewrite the deprecated SVG paths to the
deprecated SVGs folder.

This could remove the deprecated SVGs from the selector interface, but not
break existing projects. When user goes to work with the symbol, the
correct path is visible, but they can only select new-style SVGs for which
to update the symbol, unless they specifically browse to the deprecated
folder and link to a deprecated one again.

I think such an approach will keep good karma with the user community.

2) Many of the new symbols are white as default. This is probably so they
work well on top of a colored background when layered. However, this makes
them very difficult to preview (especially on Mac). Either the widget view
needs to have a medium gray background, or the default color for those SVGs
should be gray (or maybe black, but gray would work better). This assumes
that all those SVGs have color parameters that can just be changed later.

3) The new SVG backgrounds for labels do not yet support such 'layered'
symbols. Currently only a single SVG can be used. There needs to be a
decent selection of background SVGs for labels (e.g. road shields) that do
not require layering. Layering backgrounds may not be a good fit for
labeling in the future either, since single SVGs with drop shadows already
slow labeling down.

Regards,

Larry

 Hi,

 In #336 and #338 I really like the three hands from differents parts of 
 the world. It is a nice symbol of our collaboration around the world - 
 developers, community managers and users. It may be too detailed at 
 smaller sizes. But for smaller sizes one could omit the "GIS" part and 
 use just the Q with the globe and the three hands.

 From the ones that are in the final voting, these are my favourites.

 I also like #399 and #400 for the simplicity and the usage of just one 
 color - which opens ways for various brandings (e.g. server, desktop, 
 mobile, etc.)

 Andreas

I can use renderer directly and get its name for my purposes. But as previously
for drawing style getter worked fine I tried to use it first and get
abovementioned
issue. Thanks again for clarification

Yes,  I think so. That would allow a simple upgrade path inside an organization/company/state agency.

An option to get the old symbols should suffice, right? Instructions on what needs to be done with these symbols for each platform might also be helpful.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Is there any random part process the label engine?
Message-ID: <5194ED9D.2010501@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Everything's in the subject: is there any random process in the label 
engine?

In other words, if I render one million times the same extent with the 
same layers, the same symbology, will I have everytime the same image?

(if it is true, I could use an efficient synchronization process of the 
tiles generated by QTiles for mobile devices: generating a md5 on the 
image, and only upload new tiles).

Thanks for your answer,

Denis

I guess QGIS could use "graphic-margin" as well.
Let me have a look at the code, whether our "distance" option is ever
worked (it doesn't work at the moment on QGIS 1.9, probably due to
API breaks), to understand if we should handle both the options.

Cheers.

Hi

I have to say when I compare them to our existing logo, none of them
really do it for me. Perhaps we need a new mandate to freshen our
exisiting logo rather than to try to create something new. Our current
logo may have issues but it is:

* distinctive
* bright
* clear
* recognisable
* already has a strong association with our 'brand'

If the new logo does not meet these or in some way offer an
improvement over the old, we should rather focus on tweaking what we
already have.

Regards

Tim

Ignoring the current contest and whether any of those designs work, I
personally think the current logo's look is unprofessional enough to
actually be considered a detriment to the project at this point.

While that may seem like a strong statement, I think difficult decisions,
like abandoning the old logo and going for a more modern and professional
look, need to be made if QGIS is really going to have a chance to directly
compete with the likes of ESRI and other commercial products in the
enterprise, institutional or governmental workplace.

I do think QGIS 2.0 has a chance to make great inroads into such areas, but
the project needs to win over those users. Whether we, as open source
developers, like it or not marketing is a key factor. First impressions are
often greatly influenced by such things as logos.

Sorry to say, but I think the current logo may unfortunately convey the
following to users in the enterprise, institutional or governmental
workplace:  amateur.

After spending quite a bit of time 'under the hood' I can honestly say the
programming comprising QGIS is anything but amateur. It is very high
quality and painstakingly well thought out and implemented. I strive every
time I write code to meet those criteria.

Not only do I think the project's logo needs to meet the expectations of an
ever-expanding number of existing and potential users, I also believe it
needs to do justice to the quantity and quality of the work done by so many
devoted developers and testers, and to those who support the project,
either financially, via the community or by providing user services.

Sorry, again, but I think the current logo falls far short of those goals,
and any focus on revamping it is just prolonging the inevitable decision to
move to a better one.

Best regards,

Larry

I totally agree with Larry on this, the logo we currently have, might be 
"legacy-loved" by devs and the likes, but if we want to have mmore 
corporate users we need to be shiny and polyshed from the outside. we 
only get one chance to make a first impression.

I would like to see something in between the first and the last in #394, I
mean, I like the look of the first #394 (and #50) but the lower right
triangle of the Q should be more pronounced (but not as much as in the last
#394).

So "Quantum" should NOT be part of the branding?

I'm not saying either way - but one part of the debate I have not seen discussed (missed it?) is whether the brand we want to market is QGIS, Quantum GIS or both.

If we can decide on that aspect, deciding on the logo may be easier.

Cheers

I'd make the Q more unique though. It's why I like the concept of #50: it's 
clean, it's memorable and it refers to the old recognizable colour and arrow. 
Anway, I don't claim #50 is good as the final work.

IIRC that has been decided. No more Quantum.

Just to clarify - I am not opposed to replacing the logo at all. I
just want to replace it with something that properly addresses our
needs rather than taking an option we are not happy with simply
because of the 99designs competition deadline. Currently there isn't
an entry in my opinion that does this - for me anyway.

In fact the file (libdelimitedtextplugin.so) is not there, only has the libdelimitedtextprovider.so.

Any idea about what may be happening?

Thanks!

Hello all,

kudos to all users and developers who made QGIS the most popular tag on
gis.stackexchange:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/tags

Please note that arc* produts have multiple tags, whose sum is higher
than QGIS one, but note also the wide presence of open source tools and
technologies.

This is only a very basic metric, so everyone is welcome to further
examine the data (how many questions have been answered, how many users
are involved etc..).

All the best!

Anne

The current logo doesn't convey at all professional status, it looks really outdated and amateur, ?difficult decisions need to be made, even big companies rebrand because of customers?

I would suggest releasing a press release mentioning dropping Quantum for QGIS only.?

QGIS is an awesome software but it gets less attention due to the branding around it and marketing, a better logo is needed, a better modern website, complete branding and finally some active marketing.

Now what's the roadmap ahead for the project not in programming terms but in market terms, what is QGIS goal beyond being great GIS software

Hi

I have to say when I compare them to our existing logo, none of them
really do it for me. Perhaps we need a new mandate to freshen our
exisiting logo rather than to try to create something new. Our current
logo may have issues but it is:

* distinctive
* bright
* clear
* recognisable
* already has a strong association with our 'brand'

If the new logo does not meet these or in some way offer an
improvement over the old, we should rather focus on tweaking what we
already have.

Ignoring the current contest and whether any of those designs work, I personally think the current logo's look is unprofessional enough to actually be considered a detriment to the project at this point.

While that may seem like a strong statement, I think difficult decisions, like abandoning the old logo and going for a more modern and professional look, need to be made if QGIS is really going to have a chance to directly compete with the likes of ESRI and other commercial products in the enterprise, institutional or governmental workplace.

I do think QGIS 2.0 has a chance to make great inroads into such areas, but the project needs to win over those users. Whether we, as open source developers, like it or not marketing is a key factor. First impressions are often greatly influenced by such things as logos.

Sorry to say, but I think the current logo may unfortunately convey the following to users in the enterprise, institutional or governmental workplace:? amateur.?

After spending quite a bit of time 'under the hood' I can honestly say the programming comprising QGIS is anything but amateur. It is very high quality and painstakingly well thought out and implemented. I strive every time I write code to meet those criteria.

Not only do I think the project's logo needs to meet the expectations of an ever-expanding number of existing and potential users, I also believe it needs to do justice to the quantity and quality of the work done by so many devoted developers and testers, and to those who support the project, either financially, via the community or by providing user services.

Sorry, again, but I think the current logo falls far short of those goals, and any focus on revamping it is just prolonging the inevitable decision to move to a better one.

Or does it mean that the documentation is not comprehensive enough and 
not explaining clearly different topics or does it mean that there is a

Hi all.
Thanks Larry and all for raising the marketing issue. I agree we have
an issue here; I do not agree it is a devastating one. Our stats are
all positive, our market penetration is thrilling, etc.
The root of it is the fact that QGIS is developer-driven, with
determinant input from customers, who "vote" paying for their needed
feature. This explains the quality of code, the dev-friendly
environment, and also the limited attention to marketing. As PSC
marketing advisor, I tried to raise interest on these and other points
in the past, without success. I think times are ripe to examine the
question once more. Especially the website needs to be redone; we have
done some work in Valmiera, but there is still something to do (as
usual, volunteers needed).
All the best.

If you think that the average user reads the documentation before

I agree 100% that a logo should not be settled upon, but happily selected,
regardless of any competition deadline. It's a very important decision. I
have a couple of ideas to overcome the current impasse:

1) Run off - Currently there seems to be two popular designs, but a general
consensus that neither is the 'right' one. There could be a short-term 'run
off' competition that allows those two designers to try and come up with
better designs, in an attempt to find a good solution for 2.0 release.
Again, this should not mean the result has to be binding, i.e. the winner's
logo used.

2) Use current logo - For 2.0 release, just use the current logo, as is.
After 2.0 release, I suggest the forming of an design committee to manage
another go at finding a new logo, and for the reasons mentioned below.

3) Design committee - Kudos to Nathan for his efforts on the competition
and getting everyone involved in the process. In retrospect I think a logo
by popular consensus, as a means of getting to final logo selections, may
not be the best course of action. In many organizations there are people
with design background or knowledge who work on making the initial
selections to bring to the community or those who make decisions.

For example, the popular #50 has a inherent design flaw of being 95% black,
even though the rest of the design is OK. Such a committee could have
spotted this early on and asked the designer to work on a fix, before the
logo was presented to the community/PSC to vote on.

I suggest such a committee be formed and comprised of 3-5 people who's job
is to manage and make initial decisions on:

* Project logo, design style, fonts
* Marketing material design style
* Documentation/web site template style and fonts
* Program's general icons, toolbar icons, splash screen and style

A design committee will allow a cohesive 'look' for all parts of the
project to start taking shape. The committee should probably answer to and
be under the purview of the PSC marketing advisor, and have specific
abilities bestowed upon it members to vote internally to act on smaller
decisions without needing full PSC approval.

Basically, I feel design by community popular vote is not a good approach:
too many cooks in the kitchen. This committee could be formed now, with an
initial goal of handling the current logo situation. While personally I
have a lot of design experience and would like to be on such a committee, I
understand my current conflict of interest regarding the logo, and would
recuse myself regarding its decision.

An active community member who has clear public examples of quality,
design-oriented work would be Anita Graser. So, I would nominate her to be
on such a committee.

Larry

That all sounds like a very reasonable approach. I think this kind of
filtering would be good as in retrospect there was such a high noise
to signal ratio in the design competition I didn't find the process
worked well for me. Hats off to Nathan for all the effort he put into
it, but a more filtered and considered approach as described above
sounds good. It would be also good to have a more rigorous set of
criteria - the emotional response to a logo should be the last part of
the process not the first, basic design principles should first be
ticked off.

+1 on your suggestions above

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Labeling gui redesign branch ready
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR82HLLeGE78SmFwRS7-TEiuBAs4hz7McZDESu2yqcXjOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I think the branch I have been working on for the labeling gui redesign and
expression-based data definitions is ready to merge [0]. Here is the commit
message:

Update labeling gui and add expression support as data defined value
- Add QgsDataDefined class
- Add QgsDataDefinedButton class
- Add data defined Python support
- Add standalone SVG selector dialog to QgsSvgSelectorWidget class
- Fix for #4607, show only pertinent fields when setting a data defined
value
- Fix for #5048 and #5049, data defined settings are literally used
- Fix for #5726, number formatting does not work for expressions
- Fix for #7755, using bufferSize to enable/disable label buffer is
confusing
- Fix for #7779, labels do not register in label collision engine; and for
#4719, inactive options in labeling dialog
- Prepare label text's expression upfront when preparing layer; makes
rendering much faster
- Change name of 'feature obstacles' to appropriate terminology

(Due to my workflow between 3 computers and constant rebasing, my branch
was squashed down to one commit; sorry about that).

I would like to merge this branch sometime this weekend, but will hold off
if someone objects. I can create a pull request if needed.

The goal of this redesign was to add expression-based data definitions,
make a small data defined tool button with visual feedback that can be used
in-line in any form layouts [1, 2], and bring all the new labeling features
to a finished looking state for 2.0. Also, the redesign was done with the
intent that it integrates well with an eventual move to rule-based labels
and styles (2.0 >).

The work was mostly financed through a generous donation by a community
member (thank you for the support).

Notes:

There were 83 labeling data defined options added or updated, with well
over 100 basic label configuration combinations that need unit tests. Full
data defined labeling Python support was just completed in this branch, so
now a complete test suite for can finally be built for labeling. Currently
there are no tests, so anyone who can help manually test this update would
be greatly appreciated.

Enabling a label buffer is no longer triggered by it size. I have added
code to compensate where it was used by older projects. Please let me know
ASAP if there is an issue with any layer-level or data defined buffers in
any new or converted projects.

The implementation of quadrant offset for 'Over point' has be changed to an
enum setup. This feature was not in 1.8, but may have been set by users
working with 1.9 projects. I can add code to update projects from 1.9 to
2.0, but it seemed extraneous given it was a change between releases. Users
with 1.9 projects will have to manually reset quadrant choices.

The code for migrating index-based data defined project settings to
name-based ones was updated. My tests show it is OK, but please contact me
ASAP if you find opening any 1.8 project seems to have issues.

Ok, I see that there have been changes in commit 350f2245284621c03881c0585fa8332cf4dc132b by J?rgen

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/350f2245284621c03881c0585fa8332cf4dc132b 

I'll try again, I may have used an earlier version of this commit.

Hi,

I'm trying to compile QGIS master as usual but it gives me an error:

dh_testdir
dh_testroot
dh_installchangelogs ChangeLog
dh_installdocs
dh_installexamples
dh_install --sourcedir=debian/tmp
cp: imposs?vel analisar ?debian/tmp/usr/lib/qgis/plugins/libdelimitedtextplugin.so?: Ficheiro ou directoria inexistente

make: *** [binary-arch] Error 2
dpkg-buildpackage: error: debian/rules binary gave error exit status 2


In fact the file (libdelimitedtextplugin.so) is not there, only has the libdelimitedtextprovider.so.

Any idea about what may be happening?

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

I dont think it is consistent with the goal of cleaning the code base
for 2.0 to have migration code for 1.9 to 2.0. USers on 1.9 should
understand that things are in flux until 2.0 comes out. So -1 from me
for that.

+1 from me for you to go ahead and merge. We have been testing your
changes here and they are absolutely awesome. I would really love to
see a good unit test for this follow.

Tim

Hi all,

How up to date are the unit tests? I seem to be getting quite a lot of
failures by the look of things but I am not sure if these are up to date or
not. BTW, the program compiles and seems to run so these unit tests might
just be very outdated.

It should be up to date - but some tests only work on the configuration they
were made on - and assume that stuff is contant, although it differs on various
platforms and dependency versions.

+1 from me to have some kind of design committee.  If we don't focus on
this area of the project in the near future I feel it will always reflect
an amateur project status, and as we all know that is not the case.
Provided we have a mailing list that we can see what is going on and have
some input if we feel then I'm all for that kind of thing.

I'm happy for Larry to be on said committee regardless of his work on the
logo comp.  Anita would also get my vote. Nyall would also be another
person I would like to see added as he has some skills in this area. Mathieu
(nIRV) is another.

So the committee so far for me:
 - Larry
- Anita
- Nyall
- Mathieu

I think it's best to keep it small or else we end up back in this situation
again.

The current situation is that we HAVE to pick a design from the logo comp
and pay the "winner" regardless of if we use that logo or not. 99design
rules not mine.  If everyone is currently not 100% happy with what has been
presented I suggest that we pick one of Larry's, give him the money, and
ramp up the committee to design something better.  I would rather see the
money go to one of our devs if we are not happy so the money stays with the
project and we can keep working on it.

I will send an email to PSC asking for a vote on this and if I get all +1s
then I will pick Larry as the "winner" so we can all move on and not have
this hanging above our heads.

Regards,
Nathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] I am trying to add a class to core
Message-ID: <CAD+mzoza2egRkWS0m50KRSVt0iWaU39s7mbvxRtJ5hcnLLXHrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to create a brand new class for the core section of the code
but I am getting linker errors. I am trying to include gui/qgsmapcanvas.h
and then create a QgsMapCanvas object but I am getting an error which says
that:

undefined reference to `QgsMapCanvas::QgsMapCanvas(QWidget*, char const*)'


I am guessing this is because I am trying to use an object found in the gui
library but somehow isn't getting linked correctly to the core library. I
added the core class I created to the CMakeList.txt and it seems to build
so I assume I did that correctly. Adding ../gui in the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
section didn't seem to help but at least I can now refer to the header as
just "qgsmapcanvas.h" instead of "../gui/qgsmapcanvas.h"


Basically, I can't figure out the magic that is required to link a class
from the gui library to the core library. What do I do?


Thanks,

~Ben

Hey Benedict,

The core library is not meant to just be non-gui bits, hence why we have
core and gui.  As QgsMapCanvas is a class in gui you can't use it in core.

What did you have in mind we might be able to work out a way to fit it in.

Regards,
Nathan

So I am trying to create data frames with a QgsMapCanvas. I assumed this
went under core but it might touch too much to not go under app for the
time being or perhaps even gui. I only asked after about an hour of trying
to figure out a linker error before sticking it under app. I think I am
going to get a basic set of functions working and we can figure out where
QgsDataFrame actually goes.

Thanks for the help.

Maybe just build it in app at the moment until we have a better idea of how
it all works together.  We can refactor it out and up later if we need to.

I have no problem ostensibly being labeled the winner. Under the
circumstances, though, I would feel a bit odd accepting any money,
regardless of whether I'd just turn around and use it to offset development
hours. I think the best thing is to leave the funds with the project and
have it pay forward to a final logo solution. Not sure if
99designs.comrequires or tracks transactions, but if so, I'd be happy
to accept the
funds to my PayPal account and donate it right back to the project.

Concerning the proposed design committee, I see those people as more of a
'filter,' as Tim mentioned, whose perspective is design-oriented, not
necessarily those who come up with a logo design. I think another contest
or large-scale submission would probably occur to arrive at some final
designs again.

Hopefully, future designers can somehow still reference the submissions
from this contest, so we don't end up with a whole bunch of similar designs
the community already feels don't work.

+1 for leaving logo as is for 2.0, focusing on the release, then trying to
find a new logo and icon again, ideally for 2.1.

Regards,

Larry

Hi Benedict

I put on the delimited text tests, but only have Ubuntu development platform set up at the moment (on which of course they pass!!).

What platform are these results on, and do you have any more details for the delimited text failures?

Thanks
Chris Crook

Hi all,

How up to date are the unit tests? I seem to be getting quite a lot of
failures by the look of things but I am not sure if these are up to date or
not. BTW, the program compiles and seems to run so these unit tests might
just be very outdated.

This is my output of make test

+1 to Logo design committee.

+1 to "Winner" to Larry so we can keep the money :-).

I read the we are using QGIS instead of Quantum GIS now.

I think we should focus on designing a logo on Q now.

Gary Sherman uses the arrow in the Logo. And Tim likes abstract.

I was inspired with Nathan posting on git logo. Although, I thought
that I seen similar logo before. The git logo is similar to USB logo.

Going back to "Gary S. arrow", Tim liking of abstract and Nathan git
logo liking, I decided draw a QGIS Logo. I always like this "dynamic
arrow".

I got 2 designs;

1). 3 dynamic arrows + smaller one.
2). 2 dynamic arrows + smaller one.

The dynamic arrow represents (dynamic) / moving, progressing,
evolving, etc. just like QGIS is evolving!

These logos give tribute to Gary Sherman original Q logo with an arrow.

I am not saying that we should pick one of these logo. (I like the 3
dynamic arrows). What I am saying that we should design a abstract
logo based on Q.

However, I would be happy if we can use this concepts - dynamic arrows
and improve the designs.

You can view the 2 logo designs and icon representation (below URL)

what about Robert Szczepanek? IIRC he is the one that did most of the icons.

there was a similar logo in the competition IIRC and was dismissed 
because the 3 arrows metaphoirically remember the recicling logo.

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GTX=Pag=puRcH_NUbOq11MAWYZ8YtSWarph82GtUUFjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm looking for "add feature" code for inspiration for a plugin. But I
can't seam to find it. My idea was to see the correct procedure to draw in
canvas (respecting topology, avoid intersection, and so on).

For what I have read, I think the procedure is something like:

- Start a rubberBand;
- On left-click add points to the rubberBand;
- Update rubberband drawing as mouse moves;
- On right-click finish rubberband;
- Use finished rubberband somewhere (in my case use it to replace a feature
geometry)

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Now, looking the standard dynamic arrows. Yes. it looks like the
recycling logo :-).

However, the one render by ballpen does not.

Now, the challenge is how can we create a good Q logo

Yes, I guess we can't use the 3 arrows.

https://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&site=imghp&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1343&bih=622&q=recycling&oq=recycling&gs_l=img.3..0l10.2312.5769.0.6030.13.11.1.1.1.2.634.2235.2j4j2j1j0j1.10.0...0.0...1ac.1.14.img.uF_GqfTjgtI

But probably 2 or 1 arrow.

Have a look at the new ballpen renders (1 and 2 arrows Q logos).

Hi Alexander,

You probably would want to create your own class which inherits 
QgsMapTool to receive the mouse events and manage the rubberband.

You'll find the code for the add feature tool in 
src/app/qgsmaptooladdfeature.{h|cpp} if you're looking for C++ code.

The attached link [1] points to a map tool I wrote (in python) which 
makes use of a line rubberband and some additional snapping stuff.

Regards,
Matthias

Message-ID: <F58537D0-737B-4561-91D7-6CD6F43B7A53@westnet.com.au>

Hi,

I'm noticing an odd behaviour in recent 1.9 builds at work. When I edit a layer it automatically snaps to the layer that I'm editing.
Can anyone else see this?
Is it intentional?

How do you stop QGIS doing this?

This is probably some new setting that I missed, but I can't work out what it is. I don't see anything in Prefernces -> Digitise that implies this behaviour, and I have *no* snapping set in these projects. 

It isn't happening on my home computer with a 7e30da2 build.

-ramon.

Dear Team:

Last week, I uploaded a new version of Geospatial Simulation (v1.1) to the repository.  A manuscript on the software is currently in peer-review, so it would be helpful for the reviewers to have access to the latest code.  Can I ask admin to take a look soon and approve?

With the last two nightly builds from Dakota Cartography, if I try to save a layer style to a qml file for a shape file, GGIS crashes. This works with the nightly build from May 16, so it appears to be a recently introduced bug. Is anybody else having this problem?

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-Rnj1VJD4d8Lf=EWWOj6zgN8Ou9=LToWtpN-20GgX+xQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Recently William upgraded his Mac support frameworks to GDAL 1.10 and
Spatialite 4.0 [0]. However, it appears that QGIS core code may not be
ready for Spatialite 4.0 [1].

Is anyone using QGIS master branch with Spatialite 4.0 successfully?

If Spatialite 4.0 is still not supported yet, is anyone working on it?

I can get a vector layer to Save as... to a Spatialite 4.0 db, but can't
create a new one.


Same questions for GDAL 1.10. Are there issues within the QGIS codebase
concerning its use that would cause it not to be recommended for 2.0?


These are two major new FOSSGeo releases that seem a shame to not include
support for in QGIS 2.0.

The submitter apparently is - it's just that it doesn't seem to work with empty
tables.

I cant speak for spatialite, but I normally use a trunk build of gdal
on my desktops with no adverse affects....

IMHO it would be great to make sure latest spatialite and GDAL are tested
and packaged with 2.0 in Mac, osgeo4w and ubuntugis-unstable

I personally use gdal-1.10 with qgis master without any problems (Linux
 Mint 14)

Hi Kelly

I've approved it - nice work! I would be nice to update your plugin so
that the menu items fall under the vector or analysis menus as is now
becoming SOP from QGIS 2.0.

The other issue I have had with SpatiaLite 4 is with DB Manager. DB Manager does not recognize geometry for a table in a Spatialite 4 created database (new spatial metadata). Displays the same as a table without geometry. If the database was created with Spatialite 3 or converted to a version 3 database with spatialite_convert, then it will show the table as having geometry. It would appear that DB Manager is not testing whether the database containing the table is using the new or old version of the spatial metadata.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Dataprovider.select() doesnt exist
Message-ID: <CAOZxMvW37ZYYw+Mzd0KiDMzVLyfPAc68NXrzWWAgokgULaqcCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am using QGIS 1.9 Master in Ubuntu 12.10. I am trying to develop a plugin
and need to extract data from attributes tables of the .shp.

I created a GUI for the user can Open shp from the computer and the code
recognize the shp file and I can get the name of the .shp, name of columns,
etc. but I can not get the values for each row and work with them.

I follow the cookbook but when I type "provider.select(allAttrs)" the
python console in QGIS says:

"AttributeError:QgsVectorDataProvider' object has no attribute 'select'

here is the code I used: (i didn't copy the definition of GUI because  with
that is any prolem)

from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore
from PyQt4 import *
from qgis.core import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

import qgis.utils, sys
# supply path to where is your qgis installed
QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/usr/", True)
#load providers
QgsApplication.initQgis()

*******

        self.ln_lnk.setText(str(self.filename_lnk))

        lnk_shp = QgsVectorLayer(self.filename_lnk, 'casires', 'ogr')

        if not lnk_shp.isValid():
            print "doesnt work"
            QtGui.QMessageBox.Warning(self, "Warning", "shp not valid",
QtGui.QMessageBox.Ok)

        try:
            provider = lnk_shp.dataProvider()
            feat = QgsFeature()
            allAttrs = provider.attributeIndexes()


            provider.select(allAttrs)
            attr_list =[]


            while provider.nextFeature(feat):

                attrs = feat.attributeMap()
                for(k,attr) in attrs.iteritems():
                    attr_list.append(attr.toString())

        except:
            self.ln_save.setText("Falsch")


I try the same plugin in a oldest version of QGIS 1.7.5 and it works or at
least doesn't show this "Falsch". I am wondering during a  week and have no
idea to sole this. I would really apreciate if someone can solve this
problem because is really important to create this plugin and for tha I
need to take the data from the attribute table, if not I can not continuous
anymore.

Does anyone what is wrong and why my QGIS doesnt recognize the
provider.select(allAttrs)?
I would like to know if somebody knows how to install a oldest version of
QGIS (e.g. 1.7.5)??

thank you so much!!

We removed the select() method in the new version to make way for
multithreading in the future.

You can translate you code into this:

for feature in lnk_shp.getFeatures():
    for attr in feature.attributes():
      attr_list.append(attr.toString())

Hi Kelly,
thanks for this. Would you mind announcing it on the ML, with a bit of
explanation? Even better if you add the description to the plugin
page, or point to a dedicate web page.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] State of Spatialite 4.0 and GDAL 1.10 for QGIS 2.0?
Message-ID: <CAN8Jn0B7QzqP7JRKBjy3sHibP9TwOywuuunvUR1dCdXTah0aSA@mail.gmail.com>

As I understand from discussion with SpatiaLite author Sandro Furieri,
version 4 is really strongly recommended over version 3. Version 3 was some
kind of not very successful release.

Version 4 should be fully supported in QGIS master [1]. I use SpatiaLite 4
in my GIS PPA [2] and I am building QGIS master with it. Some things are
still not working (I will report if not already) but it may be GDAL problem.
Definitely, I think that QGIS 2 must be released with SpatiaLite 4.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server - GetPrint with a composer containing
	HTML block causes segfault
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7jygF50B2Ta5eC1T+kUENOn=hD7-OAq-vZHpg8yph6=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

I have tried it with today's qgis master.

I have a very simple project with one shapefile containing 3 polygones. I
created a composer with a map. GetPrint request works fine with it. If I
add an HTML block in the composer (refering to one HTML file or not), the
getPrint request raises a segfault.

Apache error log is the well-known :
"Premature end of script headers: qgis_mapserv2.fcgi"

By the way, I compiled QGIS with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug , but I do not
know where I can find complet log for QGIS Server. Is there a file where I
can get complete log for QGIS Server ?

I can provide a sample project if needed. I have not found a ticket in the
hub, so I will fill one, but I would prefer to do so with a self-explaining
log.

Michael

Hi Michael

I also encountered that problem. Unfortunately, it seems that QWebKit 
requires a running x-server. So it won't be possible to use html items 
in server projects (or you can run an x-server and set the DISPLAY 
variable in the fcgi conf).

Regards,
Marco

Hi

You might also want to consider using Xfvb as a 'fake' xserver.

that's not completely true; version 3 simply was the final evolution
step of the legacy development line started since version 2.4

version 4.x starts a brad new development path, is actually based on
a profoundly refactored code base and includes many more advanced
features. just to say:
- v.4 is now supported by an almost complete test coverage
- v.4 has been extensively checked using Valgrind so to completely
   erase any possible memory leak or memory-related issue
- many possible buffer overflow causes have been carefully identified
   and completely eradicated
- many performance optimizations have been introduced here and there
- lots of new cool features are now available

all this considered, I see no reason at all to still continue
using v.3: it's a less advanced implementation, it surely contains
many bugs now definitely resolved in v.4 and it certainly has a
less robust and more error prone code base.

Please note: I'm planning to release v.4.1.0 in the very next days;
a Release Candidate is already available:
https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=4.1.0-RC1

v.4.1.0 is certified to be a completely API/ABI compatible replacement
for v.4.0.0, so I suppose that directly switching to 4.1.0 should
be the most appropriate solution to be adopted for QGIS 2.0

a very closely related topic:
two days ago the SQLite folks have released the latest v.3.7.17:
this very recent release seems to be a significant milestone in
SQLite evolution. please see:
http://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_7_17.html

IMHO directly including libsqlite 3.7.17 in QGIS 2.0 should be
a very good opportunity to be carefully evaluated.

as the SQLite developers state:
"Version 3.7.17 of SQLite is recommended for all new development.
Upgrading from all previous SQLite versions is recommended."

bye Sandro

both issues are closely related.
since many months the QGIS-spatialite data-provider has been
updated so to be able to connect indifferently both spatialite
v.3.x and v.4.x DB-files. any specific difference affecting the
data layout for Spatial Metadata tables adopted by each version
will be always silently handled in the most appropriate way
by the revised data-provider.
the whole process will be absolutely transparent from the end
user POV.

the relevant QGIS-trunk cumulative patch corresponds to commit
#47097b72 [2012 November 30]

anyway, simply updating the data-provider code itself isn't enough
in order to effectively activate full support for v.4.0.0 DB-files:

a) QGIS binaries must be absolutely built on the top of libspatialite
    4.0.0 (if binaries are actually built on the top of some
    earlier libspatialite version the whole code implementing 4.0.0
    support will be conditionally disabled by CMAKE)
b) at run time QGIS must effectively load libspatialite 4.0.0 (or
    any later version)

if one or the other of these two conditions aren't satisfied, then
QGIS will be completely unable to access any DB-file created by
libspatialite 4.0.0

so the real issue is in that quite almost Linux major distros still
support obsolete versions of libspatialite; the same is true for the
OSGeo4W Win distro.
the net result of this situation is that even building a fresh copy
of QGIS-trunk starting from sources will easily produce an executable
binary completely unable to support v.4.0.0 DB-files.
on the other side, building QGIS-trunk after installing a custom
built libspatialite-4.x will always create binaries perfectly able
to access v.4.0.0 DB-files, even on Windows MSVC/OSGeo4W.

-----------------

the second issue (DB Manager) requires few more considerations.
Spatialite (exactly as PostGIS) supports several "high-level/abstract"
SQL functions allowing to correctly handle Spatial Metadata tables
in the most transparent way; such an approach is obviously intended to
shield against fine-grained implementation details, which can easily
change from version to version.

case A)
if the developer always correctly invoked the expected "high level"
SQL functions, then transitioning from v.3 to v.4 is expected to be
a completely painless process; because in this case the underlying
library will silently accommodate for any possible physical data
layout difference introduced by the most recent version.

case B)
on the other hand, if the developer decided to completely skip
using any appropriate "abstract" SQL function so to directly perform
some INSERT or UPDATE statement affecting the Spatial Metadata tables,
many painful transition issues should be expected to arise while
transitioning to the most recent version.
in this case a patient code correction action has obviously to be
applied case by case.
I strongly fear that this second (worst) case is the most probable
scenario we can expect to face for DB Manager (and possibly for
others plug-ins).

no insert nor update statements are performed to understand what's the
layer's geometry type, and the db v4.0 wasn't created by DB Manager

Surely the problem is a different one, I guess it could depend on the
python connector DB Manager uses, aka the pyspatialite library.

Cheers.

I understood that you're going to change that by becoming the maintainer of
spatialite in OSGeo4W - at least Paolo said so IIRC.

certainly yes; I'll start working so to update OSGeo4W immediately 
after
releasing the final "stable" 4.1 ... just few days, reasonably before
the end of the current week (so I hope).

this will surely resolve many issues on Windows; sadly enough, will 
have
no effect at all for Linux distros (and I presume on MacOsX as well).

Hi Denis,
I have found a problem. The problem was that menu item 'Define logged
action layer' was confusing for me and I was choosing my PostGIS geometry
layer there. I recommend to rename it to something like 'Choose audit
history table' (avoid using 'layer') with some description that the table
should be loaded to QGIS. Now 'search history' windows opens correctly.

Also I recommend to exclude at least any geometry tables from 'logged
action layer chooser' dialog and also exclude 'history table' from choosing
itself from selecbox in 'search history' window.

One more question, how do you activate audit if table exists in some schema
outside of default search_path ? Using

SELECT audit.audit_table('<schema>.<table>');

is not working for me.


I have found some other bugs which will be better to submit in bug tracker.
Do you have some ?



 I have hesitated with creating something like your approach, but I decided
> to use something which is "official". As, the trigger is available on

I see one big disadvantage with this Audit trigger implementation which is
performance, if history of all tables is recorded to one huge table. If you
have many changes in one big table it will affect all other. Moreover I am
missing tests (which of course can be added).


Thanks,

Ivan

QGIS is using Spatialite 4. If I execute SELECT spatialite_version() in DB Manger, I get 4.0.0.

The problem with creating a new layer is that with SpatiaLite 4, QGIS will not load an empty table. The debug info shows:
Debug: src/providers/spatialite/qgsspatialiteprovider.cpp: 523: (QgsSpatiaLiteProvider) Invalid SpatiaLite layer

The database and table appears to be created correctly. If I use SQL to insert one record with geometry into the table with DB Manager, then I can load the table to the canvas in QGIS.

I am using OS X 10.8.3 with QGIS daily builds from Dakota Cartography and frameworks from kygnchaos. SpatiaLite 4.0 appears to work without problems in python programs I have written. The fact that SELECT spatialite_version() in the DB Manager SQL window indicates to me that DB Manger is loading the correct version of pysqlite from the kygnchaos frameworks.

both issues are closely related.
since many months the QGIS-spatialite data-provider has been

data layout for Spatial Metadata tables adopted by each version

layout difference introduced by the most recent version.

case B)
on the other hand, if the developer decided to completely skip
using any appropriate "abstract" SQL function so to directly perform
some INSERT or UPDATE statement affecting the Spatial Metadata tables,
many painful transition issues should be expected to arise while
transitioning to the most recent version.
in this case a patient code correction action has obviously to be
applied case by case.
I strongly fear that this second (worst) case is the most probable
scenario we can expect to face for DB Manager (and possibly for
others plug-ins).

Hi Giuseppe,

thanks for your further clarifications (really useful to completely
focus the question).

All right, now I finally understand that the question was about 
querying
the spatial  metadata tables in order to detect geometry-type, srid,
dimensions and so on.
(sorry, I previously understood that the problem was creating a further
geometry column, thus defaulting to use AddGeometryColumn() or not)


I'm not really completely sure about this, but I suppose that the
optimal way should probably be the one to ask the data-provider
itself to return such infos. If I remember well the data
provider is always fully aware of metadata related to each single
layer, and the access methods are always fully independent from
any possible versioning idiosyncrasy.

If for some good reason such an approach isn't suitable for python
plug-ins then the alternative approach is obviously the one to
directly query the metadata tables.
and (sadly) in this case v.3 and v.4 behave rather differently:

v.3 (and earlier versions) layout:
------------------------------------
SELECT srid, type, coord_dimension
FROM geometry_columns
WHERE Lower(f_table_name) = Lower('points')
   AND Lower(f_geometry_column) = Lower('geom');
======
4326  POINT    XY


SELECT srid, type, coord_dimension
FROM geometry_columns
WHERE Lower(f_table_name) = Lower('lines')
   AND Lower(f_geometry_column) = Lower('geom');
======
4326  LINESTRING    XYZM


SELECT srid, type, coord_dimension
FROM geometry_columns
WHERE Lower(f_table_name) = Lower('polygs')
   AND Lower(f_geometry_column) = Lower('geom');
======
4326  MULTIPOLYGON    XYZ



v.4 (and subsequent versions) layout:
-------------------------------------
SELECT srid, geometry_type
FROM geometry_columns
WHERE Lower(f_table_name) = Lower('points')
   AND Lower(f_geometry_column) = Lower('geom');
======
4326  1


SELECT srid, geometry_type
FROM geometry_columns
WHERE Lower(f_table_name) = Lower('lines')
   AND Lower(f_geometry_column) = Lower('geom');
======
4326  3002


SELECT srid, geometry_type
FROM geometry_columns
WHERE Lower(f_table_name) = Lower('polygs')
   AND Lower(f_geometry_column) = Lower('geom');
======
4326  1006


in other worlds:
- in v.3 you have to query both "type" and "cood_dimensions"
   columns, because the geometry-type and the dimensions are
   defined separately
- in v.4 just querying "geometry_type" alone will be enough,
   because now each geometry is fully qualified by its numeric
   type (as strictly required by standard OGC and SQL/MM specs).
   a "coord_dimension" column still exists (merely for standard
   conformance, but is completely redundant and meaningless).

1 = 2D, POINT
2 = 2D, LINESTRING
3 = 2D, POLYGON
4 = 2D, MULTIPOINT
5 = 2D, MULTILINESTRIN
6 = 2D, MULTIPOLYGON
7 = 2D, GEOMETRYCOLLECTION

1001 = 3D, POINT
1002 = 3D, LINESTRING
1003 = 3D, POLYGON
1004 = 3D, MULTIPOINT
1005 = 3D, MULTILINESTRIN
1006 = 3D, MULTIPOLYGON
1007 = 3D, GEOMETRYCOLLECTION

2001 = 2D+M, POINT
2002 = 2D+M, LINESTRING
2003 = 2D+M, POLYGON
2004 = 2D+M, MULTIPOINT
2005 = 2D+M, MULTILINESTRIN
2006 = 2D+M, MULTIPOLYGON
2007 = 2D+M, GEOMETRYCOLLECTION

3001 = 3D+M, POINT
3002 = 3D+M, LINESTRING
3003 = 3D+M, POLYGON
3004 = 3D+M, MULTIPOINT
3005 = 3D+M, MULTILINESTRIN
3006 = 3D+M, MULTIPOLYGON
3007 = 3D+M, GEOMETRYCOLLECTION

bye Sandro

Hi devs

There seems to be a performance issue in QGIS Server. I tried to compile
different versions and got the following results :

QGIS master df19fe5e04b0c2ae8f1b13000099715559e6bd50 --> works as expected
= pretty fast ;)

QGIS today's master -> a lot of performance issues. I get a lot of the
following errors: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5690303/

So there is a commit in between which raises the issue. I can go on the
process of compiling every commit to find the one which triggers the issue,
unless someone knows

Anyone confirms ?

Regards
Michael

I checked other commits :

pyqgis-console] allow to disable automatic parentheses insertion from
settings (commit 942d6bfa5d5e9cc7471efcd34717613fa6a8b7db )  -->
performance issues

Fix wmsserver: Do not manipulate maplayerregistry directly (commit
df19fe5e04b0c2ae8f1b13000099715559e6bd50 ) --> Good perfs

So the problem is in between. I continue testing commits

I don't.  But git bisect will probably take you there pretty quick. ;)

Thanks J?rgen for this great tip

I almost trapped the "vicious" commit !

Following commit has BAD Server perfs
Fix wmsserver: Do not manipulate maplayerregistry directly
df19fe5e04b0c2ae8f1b13000099715559e6bd50

Following commit has GOOD Server perfs
Merge pull request #591 from ccrook/delimited_text_to_core ?
91f3ceab26013d6c97a0047c344f5e2570df34c3


I tried to compile commits between these 2 above but cannot due to
compilation errors.

I let users with better C++ skills and good QGIS Server knowledge find the
problem

Thanks for any further help regarding this regression

Michael

Hi Michael,

It's probably the commit you identified:

Fix wmsserver: Do not manipulate maplayerregistry directly 
df19fe5e04b0c2ae8f1b13000099715559e6bd50

I'm almost sure if you revert this one and commit 
35de29df9bea0a8d36d54aec677df054d7cd37ba it will run fine.

I'll have a look and revert these in case I don't find a solution to 
get around this.

As I don't have a mapserver running here, could you assist with testing 
if I have a possible fix ready?

Regards,
Matthias

Yes, sure I will !

I would like to try reverting only this commit, but I will need help here.
Your idea is to revert this commit, then checkout into latest today's
commit ? Could you help providing relative git commands ?

Thanks

On top of current master (so checked out most recent commit with bad 
performance):
git revert df19fe5e04b0c2ae8f1b13000099715559e6bd50
git revert 35de29df9bea0a8d36d54aec677df054d7cd37ba

One more question: Do you have any plugins running? (Is this even 
supported by server)?

Ok. So I reverted these 2 commits. I am now runnin the compilation (it will
last approximatively 10 minutes)
I will tell you if the regression occurs or not after this changes

QGIS Server does not support plugins, so I think this won't change anything.

Thanks for your help

Matthias,

Reverting the 2 commits above latests master works -> regression is gone,
and QGIS Server is as fast as usual.

Let me know if you want me to try some branch of yours for testing QGIS
Server.

Cheers
Michael

The pull request [1] solves this. I don't really like this fix, but I 
don't know the mapserver source well enough to provide a better fix.

Marco, could you have a look at the pull request and give a short 
feedback. Further discussion could also happen there.

Regards,
Matthias

Thanks Matthias for helping me to solve this out.
I subscribed to the Git pull request page.

Hi List, Hi Martin,

TLDR; New QgsFeatureRequest filters
- FilterExpression
- FilterFids
Available here [1]

For another project I'm currently working on, I need additional filter
possibilities in QgsFeatureRequest to filter with a QgsExpression.
As I
- did not want to repeat the code inside each iterator
- but need the possibility to override the behavior (e.g.
vectorlayerfeatureiterator only needs to filter changed features bot
does not need to refilter features already filtered by the provider)
I extended QgsAbstractFeatureIterator to handle this but allow derived
classes to override the method if they want. I introduced a small API
change such that, the nextFeature method calls
nextFeatureFilterExpression which can be overridden by subclasses. Main
filtering is done within a new method fetchFeature which gets called by
nextFeature and should not perform any filtering as long as
FilterExpression is not implemented.
Same goes for FilterFids which takes multiple featureids but is now
implemented to iterate over all features, but can easily be
reimplemented inside providers to be executed on the server side.
The change updates the API, but only for the implementation of iterators
and not for any module which uses the iterator (same nextFeature call as
before).

Anyway, before spending more time on this, I'd like to hear your opinion.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Delimited text issues and ideas
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E12B69B64B2@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi R?gis

Interesting thoughts.  I've renamed this thread and copied it  in to qgis-developer, as I think it is worth getting broader input  on this.  Hope you don't mind my putting your email there....

If I've understood the main points of your suggestion are:

1) The delimited text provider and the GUI should be able to read a VRT/CSVT file if one is present to determine field types etc

2) The delimited text provider GUI should be able to save settings to a VRT/CSVT

3) The user should be able to explicitly set data types for each column

This is inline with some of my thinking in this.  I was planning to add some way of saving settings as a "delimited text file type", that could then be selected when adding a new text layer.  At the moment (ie in master, not 1.8)  the plugin remembers settings based on file extension, but that doesn't provide enough granularity for me.  This would be analogous to saving styles in QGIS.  I hadn't decided where to store the settings yet (ie whether in a file, or in the QGIS settings, or... )

Like you, I am also not very happy with the way that the provider determines field types by scanning the file when it loads it.  So if you put different data in the file, and reload it into QGIS, then the data types may change.

I hadn't thought about using VRT or CSVT files and I really like the idea.

As a really simple first step, which would not be a major refactoring, the provider could check for a CSVT file when it loads as CSV and use it to determine field types - this would not require any UI or API changes at all.  That on its own could be very useful.  The only difficulty I can foresee with this is how to manage files with names other than ".csv".  Should it just look for a file matching the name of the input file with a "t" at the end?  Or should it only use this options for files that are named ".csv".  Or should it look for ".csvt" whatever the name of the file.  Other than that this really isn't much work, and I'd be keen to implement it.  I guess the simplest approach would be the first options, looking for a file named the same as the data file but with a "t".  If it exists and can be interpreted, then it will be used to define field types.  This would make it really easy to manage when creating data, and would be compatible with GDAL/OGR.

The VRT file is much more work as you suggest.  The mapping between VRT and the CSV options is not complete.  So the options around delimiters, skipped lines, regular expressions, and so on are not available for the VRT file.  Conversely several of the VRT options don't apply within QGIS.  So there is quite a lot of work in specifying how this should work.  Also it would entail a major reworking in terms of how the file is opened (ie you would select the VRT file in the GUI, which would then have to identify the CSV file, and also handle politely VRT files which did not define CSV files, but which defined other data source types.  This seems a lot of work and would end up re-engineering a lot of what is already in OGR.   So (even as I'm writing this)  I'm becoming less clear that this is a good approach.

Returning to the CSVT idea - once the provider can use the CSVT  then there remains the question of what GUI/API changes should be made to support it.   Two thoughts come to mind immediately.

One is, should the CSVT idea be extended to support the other metadata information required in setting up the file, such as the delimiter, etc.  The OGR specification for CSVT just defines the field types in the first line.  I don't know if it would ignore subsequent lines, in which case additional metadata could go there and still be compatible with OGR usage.  Or should another metadata file (eg .metadata, .qgs, .dlt, ...) be used to hold all the information specifying how the file should be used (sounds really messy).  But it would be really nice to be able to just select a file and have all these options automatically populated if the metadata file existed.

The other thought is around your suggestion of writing the CSVT/metadata file.  The main extra work involved in this is the user interface for defining field types.

The dialog box is already quite busy, but I guess a simple approach would be just to add a row to the preview box under the column headings with a field type selector for each column, and values "Auto,Text,Integer,Real,Date,Time,DateTime", or something like that.  The field types could then be passed through to the provider in the datasource URI (ie with a parameter such as "fieldtypes=text,text,integer,...").   This also doesn't sound like too much work.

Once this is done it would be simple to add a "save settings to metadata file" type button to the GUI, which could write the CSVT/metadata file.

This would create one more tricky question, of how to handle conflicts between metadata read in a CSVT/metadata file and that in the datasource URI.

Enough rambling.  I expect it will be a couple of weeks before I can consider this much more (though I may consider handling the CSVT file sooner).

Cheers
Chris

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS on Ubuntu Tablet
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8yB-JckVQ0s2LjS92q4u5cBrewGN-apbu0_0Q0qycGdg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just yesterday I was approached at work about making a mobile gis-based
field mapping program for dinosaur bone excavations (my current day job is
IT- and design-related for a professional paleontology company). Of course
I thought of a QGIS-Android and QMap first. Then, I read about the upcoming
Ubuntu Tablet (Touch) [0], a replacement for Android on modern tablets
(e.g. Google Nexus, etc.) currently in development release [1][2].

As I understand, it is the full OS, with a stripped GUI down using a custom
version of Unity that allows both desktop and mobile apps to run
side-by-side, both literally and graphically.

Has anyone tried this OS on a tablet yet; and, if so, do you have a guess
on how QGIS might run under it? (I'm looking into a Nexus 10 for testing.)

Marco Bernasocchi, since it appears to be just getting everything to
compile and run under ARM chip, any thoughts on what may be needed to get
QGIS up and running under such an OS? I have not found whether Python is
supported yet, but I anticipate it will be.

If you can get QMap running on that platform I would be very interested to
see it.  Once Python support is in Android I should be able to cover that
base with QMap.

Hi Larry,

The latest QGIS Mobile SoC is using Qt QML as UI for QGIS Mobile.

http://rcarrillo.org/tags/qgis-planet

Probably, you can hack this code and run native in Qt5 QML in Ubuntu
Tablet (Nexus 10).

Ubuntu Tablet Mir (new replacement of X-server in Ubuntu)  is very
friendly with Qt QML.

Thanks,

Noli

Hi Chris (second attempt at this email as I think I got your email address wrong last time!)

We (the QGIS PSC) would like to invite you to become a 'core' committer on QGIS. Core committer status would transfer to you the ability to directly maintain code in the following areas:

* delimited text provider

Our expectation is that if you wish to contribute (by direct commits) to other areas of the code base that you should please discuss your plans with Marco Hugentobler (who is the PSC member in charge of the code base) and the developers mailing list in general in order to make sure that your plans are aligned with the general goals and ethos of the project.

Before we can accept you as a core committer, we ask you to please read http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Contributor_Guidelines and reply to this message indicating that you have agreed with these pages.

Also please let me know your github username so that I can add you at that time.

We look forward to welcoming you as a new committer to the QGIS team! Once you have been given commit status, please add your details to doc/AUTHORS in the format defined in that file.

Best regards

Tim (on behalf of the PSC)

Hi,

also another useful option will be ability lo load multiple CSV files
at once using same
settings. Now, if I want load many CSV file I should open them one by
one, set settings
and then load. I know, this can be implemented as script but not all
users like scripting.

Apparently its development is going faster than liblas, which

Hi Chris, thanks for enlarging the discussion here, that's always better. I
really like the idea to interpret CSVT, but users will need a gui to create
it. That remains a good patch for 2.0 if possible. 
We could also add cvst / vrt writing in a standalone function (vector menu)
.. not urgent to me, these are workaround of a good import assistant. 

We kept on digging all import problems, and have no simple solution. MM QGIS
gives some functions, but needs to write at least two intermediate shapes
(01 for import + XY, 2 to convert text fields to real when needed) . 

Additionnal problem, almost no common tool is exporting csv correctly
according to csv specs, we then have to build good import tools, dealing
with all existing variations of txt and csv files (including BOM problems)..
Excel does good when dealing with decimal delimiters, but skips text
delimiters, so GDAL will interpret all numeric-like identifier as
identifier. My "09" is read as 9 when imported.. No possibility for me to
reinvent french administrative codes.
Libre Office is hard to use when dealing with commas/point as text
delimiters

What I have in mind to let my user work: 
*1- Short term proposal for actual users :*
QGIS 1.8: 
Me (funding or coding) : developp a quick plugin to add in vector menu:
Create point / geometry from text  into a memory layer. I will advice users
to import with a clean xls 2003 format when dealing with such data sources.
GDAL works Ok (better than csv, with no csvt needed)
CSV is OK with your import tool, but will put numeric fields in string. Use
of MM qgis or add field + update in shp is mandatory

*2 -QGIS 2.0 :* well, feature freeze is her, so having the create point
plugin compatible with new API. 

3- QGIS 2.1 : 
 fund (me certainly, if a consensus is reached) what have been previously
discussed here [0] with Nathan mockups of unified data access dialog, and
migrate your importer transparently there. 
      1: Unify data access : previsualization of data / character enconding
choice / text delimiter / decimal delimiter / data type chooser assistant /
advanced options to write csvt and/or vrt for power users
      2: port to C++ create point or geometry plugin
      3: add basic ETL functions to Core : rename, reorder, change type,
change names, save through OGR or mem Layer

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Clarifying-access-to-non-geographical-datas-td4986567.html#a4987225

Thoughts?

That looks pretty cool. Let me have a look at it and see how it can be
integrated. Not maybe for an urgent priority, but I would like to
rework the LiDAR part of SEXTANTE, and this looks promising

Thanks for the suggestion!

I just added a mockup based on nathan's work, and actual appearance of Qgis
Browser. Forgive me for the poor image work, it's a draft to help
understanding what's in my mind sith "unified data access"
see

Hi Tim and Marco

I come back to this subject after helping to solve the performance problem
with Mathias.
So, I am first runnning my tests on my ubuntu laptop. Since it is my
computer, it is not ubuntu server but the classical Ubuntu with an X server
running.

I tried in my terminal
echo $DISPLAY
:0

So it seems (but I am far from being a X server guru !) that this is the
DISPLAY value I should pass to QGIS Server.
This is why I added the following configurartion in my virtual host (and in
the fastcgi config file):

In the virtual host
        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
        <Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin">
                AllowOverride None
                Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews FollowSymLinks
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all
                SetEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/home/kimaidou/src/qgis/build/lib"
                SetEnv DISPLAY :0
        </Directory>


In /etc/apache2/mods-available/fastcgi.conf

<IfModule mod_fastcgi.c>
  AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi
  #FastCgiWrapper /usr/lib/apache2/suexec
  FastCgiIpcDir /var/lib/apache2/fastcgi
  FastCgiConfig -idle-timeout 70 -maxClassProcesses 50 -minProcesses 3
-init-start-delay 3 -restart-delay 20 -startDelay 15 -initial-env
DISPLAY=:0 -initial-env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/kimaidou/src/qgis/build/lib/
</IfModule>

I am pretty confident the default configuration is not used but I doubled
it just in case

After restarting my Apache Server, QGIS Server just hangs with the very
simple URL
http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi
which should reply with an error in XML format.
So it seems Apache/QGIServer do not like my DISPLAY parameter.

Any hint ?
Would it be simplier to test this in a real server with no existing X
Server by using Xfvb ?

Michael

I report my progress here

I managed to get a PDF via the GetPrint request by following these steps

1/ Create a fake X server
Xvfb :99 -ac -noreset &

2/ Add the option in the fastcgi , for example
  FastCgiConfig -idle-timeout 70 -maxClassProcesses 50 -minProcesses 3
-init-start-delay 3 -restart-delay 20 -startDelay 15 -initial-env
DISPLAY=:99  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/kimaidou/src/qgis/build/lib/

3/ Restart Apache
service apache2 restart


After this, I tried the GetPrint request from my QGIS project with a
composer containing a HTML item. The request get a PDF as an answer, but
the HTML item is empty.

I will try with another composer, etc., and report here.

By the way, is there a way to pass an HTML string via a parameter to the
getPrint request for HTML items, as it is possible for text item ? This
would rock !

Ok, new report here :

* Instead of using an HTML item which forces to load an external html file,
I just use a classical Text item. I have checked the "Display in HTML"
checkbox

* I setup an ID for this text box, for example "myid"

* I can request the getPrint and add the parameter and content, for example
...&LAYERS=commune&myid=<h1>a small test</h1><br/><br/><p>lorem ipsum
blablabl</p>

* It seems to work, but I get a tiny tiny box with some unreadble text in
it.

I think I must pass some extra parameters to the fake X Server, like the
screen size, etc.

I will report further attempts

Cheers
Michael

Ok, so I ran some more test. Here are the results

I have set up a simple composer in QGIS (last master, compiled this morning)
http://picpaste.com/Capture_du_2013-05-23_15_48_30-9NozmDib.png

When I export in PDF from QGIS composer, I get this
http://temp-share.com/show/KdPfy1yuh

When I ran the request [1] which is the getprint (wrapped by Lizmap, but it
is kind of a proxy to QGIS Server)
Basically I added the parameter truc=MY FOO TITLE <b>BOLD</b>
I get this :
http://temp-share.com/show/Pf3YjoO62

When I ran the same request but with a longer "truc" parameter, like
&truc=MY FOO TITLE <b>BOLD</b><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
adipiscing elit. Quisque luctus adipiscing fringilla. Fusce eget justo
tellus. Maecenas dolor augue, sollicitudin at iaculis et, congue et metus.
Aenean tincidunt ipsum sit amet ipsum ornare fermentum. Proin fringilla
laoreet hendrerit. Curabitur dui urna, interdum tempus blandit eu,</p>

I get this:
http://temp-share.com/show/f3YgiOWwn

So it appears that the dynamic replacement via the GetPrint request does
not respect the position and size of my "truc" text box. Have I missed
something or shall I report a bug ?

Thanks in advance
Michael

Hi all,

Every time I load the composer (Ubuntu 12.10) it takes about 4 minutes to
load (even starting from a blank project). Is this the general pattern, or
is it perhaps something strange with my system?

Thanks,

I run also Ubuntu 12.10, and I have no problem with latest QGIS master nor
with QGIS 1.8.

Thanks Michael. I should have said I am experiencing the problem on today's
master (827f2d4), but also on 1.8. I just timed it and it also takes 4
minutes.

Any suggestions for debugging?

 Hi,

 This is definitely not normal.

 It takes less than a second with QGIS master (from last night) on my 
 Windows machine - regardless if it is an empty composer or an existing 
 one. This is on Windows from the OSGeo4W installer.

 Perhaps you have thousands of SVG files that need to be loaded and 
 cached?

 Andreas

It's a fresh install of master, and with the 1.8 install I've just deleted
the .qgis folder to see if it's something to do with that. The result is
the same - with a blank project and without adding any layers it takes 4
minutes to load the composer. So I don't see how it could be caching SVG
files.

Could there be some libraries that composer needs which I don't have
installed? Composer seems to work fine though when it loads, so it's a
strange issue. There are no messages to stdout when I run it from the
command line, but are there some error logs I could check?

Paolo,

You're mistaking liblas with laslib

laslib/lastools :
- https://cs.unc.edu/~isenburg/lastools/
- only dev is Martin Isenburg
- the part for conversion, export, etc. are under LGPD, the rest is 
proprietary

liblas :
- www.liblas.org
- main dev is Howard Butler
- everything is BSD

Please read http://www.liblas.org/lastools.html

PLAS is based on the second and dev by Howard

I haven't completely verified this but I'm convinced that when you define additional symbols' folders that the composer takes more time to startup. Do you have this kind of folders added to the Settings?

Am I to understand that this is directly related to running Python under
ARM, not necessarily an Adroid issue? The Ubuntu Tablet OS image would be
replacing Android on the device [0], so maybe some of your troubles with
the Android API could be entirely bypassed?

absolutely but I think that the number of ubuntu devices will hardly be as
big as android.

I guess it should just work. well actually it will still require arm
packages no? I have 0 experience with ubuntu on tabs.

the only (hopefully) problem I have left now is that my ubuntu has sip
4.13.3 were the android env has sip 4.10.2 and they have incompatible Api.
I m trying now to downgrade my ubuntu sip. the problem is that sip 4.10.2
requires python 2.6.x

any suggestions?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Layers rendering order swapped (behavior change)
Message-ID: <20130523202039.GH28043@gnash>

I saved a simple project with 3 layers from 1.8.0.
Opening it with current master (commit:83445af) renders those
3 layers upside down (layer on top in the layer manager is
rendered at the bottom in the map canvas).

Moving layers around confirms the behavior: you have to move
point layers at the bottom in order for them to NOT be covered
by lineal layers.

Is this intentional ?

order or is the layer panel controling the layer rendering order?

Moving layers in the layer panel changes the rendering order.
I do not see a layer ordering panel.

Right-click menu shows "Update drawing order" is unchecked,
if I check it things work as they used to (top layer is rendered on top);
unchecking it again that order is swapped. 

Activating the layer ordering panel indeed shows that items in
that panel are always following changes in the layer panel, so
to be always in the reverse order of the latter. Funny :)

I also found that long time users find quite irritating being forced to switch. IMHO,

Hi,

It's good time now to add colours to similar sets (like open * layer).
Waiting for proposals... with short description of your associations.

Hi

I just tested the same "long" text replacement passed in the parameter, but
after unchecking the feature "Display in HTML". It appears that the
behaviour is the same : when using this feature (dynamic strings for text
item in composers) in the GetPrint request, QGIS does not respect the
position and size of the text box. All the text is displayed in a single
line which make the box "overflows" to the right.

I have not yet find the specific server code wich handles this part, so I
cannot propose a pull request for it.

Michael

+1

i.e. The difference between the "Add PostGIS layers" and "Add SpatiaLite
layers" is that one has a regular cylinder and the other has a fat-waisted
hour-glass cylinder - about 20-30 pixels are different in an icon that's
got 1024 pixels! I have to look at them in detail to see the differences.
And there's still MSSQL and Oracle icons to be created in the new schema
which using this system will only confuse things more.


Don't get me wrong, I like the style of the new icons, but they're really
hard to visually differentiate.


I did a quick google and came across this:
http://turbomilk.com/blog/cookbook/icon_design/10_mistakes_in_icon_design/

The QGIS icons do all of the top three things.

There are no additional svg folders defined in the settings. I have tried
to compile QGIS with debug enabled, but it doesn't seem that there are any
additional messages. Are there log files I should check? If I run make
test, there are quite a few failed tests:

I would like to ask the "powers that be" to keep the old and trusted icons. They never failed me and the gui is quite uplifting. The new set may be technically better but is not as friendly to users.

Please keep both.

+1

i.e. The difference between the "Add PostGIS layers" and "Add SpatiaLite layers" is that one has a regular cylinder and the other has a fat-waisted hour-glass cylinder - about 20-30 pixels are different in an icon that's got 1024 pixels! I have to look at them in detail to see the differences. And there's still MSSQL and Oracle icons to be created in the new schema which using this system will only confuse things more.


Don't get me wrong, I like the style of the new icons, but they're really hard to visually differentiate.


I did a quick google and came across this:
http://turbomilk.com/blog/cookbook/icon_design/10_mistakes_in_icon_design/

The QGIS icons do all of the top three things.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to enable labeling tools to move labels (since
 last merge of Larry's work)
Message-ID: <1369393493665-5055535.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
Larry, first, congratulations for the great labeling refactoring, this is
huge! 

I couldn't find a way to enable the move / rotate tools in toolbar, in edit
mode, after having defined fields for X and Y in expression. Tools that
opens a dialog to modify font, text.. is working, but I couldn't change Y X
values in it. 
Is this an issue or a I missing something? 
r?gis

Hi!

-1 for keeping the old Icons..

I'd rather vote to probably leave them for 2.0 but get rid of them
afterwards.. It does not make any sense to have different sets of icons ..
And as GRASS is using the same icon set in their GUI it does indeed make
sense to use it probably in every open source GIS ..

I know that the first time might be hard but that"s just the usual human
behaviour of refusing new things.
But for e.g. I am working with the new icon set since a very long time (to
use GRASS and QGIS in parallel) and I can find everything at once but
rather have some kind of problems when I switch to the old ones..

So I know that I could adapt myself to the old iconset within a few days ..
It"s just human that every "more work" you have to do gets refused at first
regardless of the advatnages it might bring later

So maybe for a period of migration I"d leave the old icons inside but
definitely not for 2.1 or later ..

OF course that all is just my personal experience and opinion

kind regards
Werner

Hi,

-1. I agree with Werner. Having used the "gis" icon set for many months, I
have problems using the old ones. That's just how the human mind works.
Let's improve the "gis" icons where it makes sense but let us focus or work
on one set.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi,

I fully agree with Werner and Anita. "gis" theme is consistent, clear
and looks much better
then old icons. Maybe all we need is only some small improvements in
color scheme as
suggested by Robert.

So, -1 for keeping old icons.

Hi Jonathan,

You are right. Problem with new icons is that we have started with some 
idea (add raster, vector, PostgreSQL layer) and end up with several 
icons of the same type. First three icons are different, however have 
too many elements. Next are worse, and Oracle and others wait for more 
general problem solution.

What are the options from my point of view (just layer toolbar)?

1. We could remove green plus leaving the others (yellow star and red 
minus). This will give some more space to increase symbol size.

2. Remove 'layer' symbol, but in this case 'create vector layer' will be 
identical to 'create vector' in edit toolbar. But considering toolbar 
context is could be OK.
Definitely we should remove 'layer' from WMS, WFS and similar.

3. Due to variety of database formats replace them with clones of 
database logo.

All changes are possible, but after general agreement. We can do it now 
or after QGIS 2.0 release.

regards,
Robert

Agree as well with Werner and Anita.
It is just matter of a short adaptation period.

Ciao

Hi Marco,
I'm afraid I respectfully disagree. A "short adaptation period" won't make
the icons more obvious.

I'm not a big QGIS user. If I want to use /any/ function in QGIS, I have to
stare at the icons and use the tooltips to figure out what button does
what, so I'm not "adapted" to the 1.8 set, let alone the 2.x ones.

That said, when I look at the 2.0 set what I see is many icons that are
almost identical. Any icon that is only ~3% different from its neighbour
(i.e. the database ones) is never going to be any good for its purpose. I'd
imagine people with a visual impairment may struggle even more.

Also remember, not all users navigate by knowing where the buttons are (in
fact, most don't). For those users you *have* to have a good set of icons
that are easily differentiated at a glance.

I think colour would be a start, but the designs themselves are still too
similar.

I think resolving this in time for the 2.x release makes sense. Otherwise
those who do learn these icons will have to re-learn them for 2.1. It
doesn't make sense to change something as fundamental as the iconography
twice in as many releases.

Just my 2p.

Kind Regards,
Jonathan

There is a short description about this below those settings:
"( Define attribute fields to enable labeling map tools )"

It means that only an attribute field mapping data definition can be used
to enable the labeling map tools (e.g. Move, Rotate, Change Properties). An
expression does not work. Since those tools directly edit the attribute
table, access to the field needs to be established, i.e. a data defined
mapped attribute field.

While it is possible to find out what attribute fields (aka columns) are
referenced within an expression, there is no simple means of determining
any one of those fields are intended to be open for writing new values. It
is possible when there is only one field in the expression, and no other
parts to the expression, to use it directly, but then why not just map a
field?

There are use cases for allowing expressions for all of those settings (X,
Y, Alignments, Rotation), so limiting those data definitions to only
allowing attribute field mappings would not be a good idea.

It looks like the 1 line help description, noted above, needs more work.
Maybe invert the logic?:
"(Defining expressions will disable labeling map tools)"

Also, a good and concise contextual help needs drafted to explain new
labeling options and how they work. Then, expanded upon for inclusion in
general documentation.

Regards,

Larry

Hi,

I'm along the lines of Werner, Anita, Marco... The new "gis" icon set 
looks much more professional than the old icon set and the look of the 
icon set actually gives the software a whole different look.

 From what I've read here, the main concern lies on the add layer icons 
which look too similar. If I remember correctly there was a plan to 
collapse them all into a single add layer button. I don't know what 
happened to this plan, but that would help to overcome this problem and 
enhance the gui as it will get cleaner. Is there anybody working on 
this feature still?

Please allow me to ask, which other icons (apart from the add layer 
icons) look too similar or have other problems.

For me the icon set is something similar to the logo. The current (1.8) 
designs look hobby-ish and need a redesign. But as you mentioned, a 
change should happen once only and not in every minor release.

So please let's focus on making the "gis" icon theme better. The old 
version gets a big -1 from me.

Matthias

Sorry I was unclear. I agree that the new theme must be the default, and our efforts
must focus on this one. What I think our users will not like it being *forced* to
change. Leaving the old theme does not cost us anything, and would be a favour to the
many who, understandably or not, do not like the change.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adjacency Matrix - Connectivity Matrix
Message-ID: <CAOZxMvU3suJGPDFjL0+pGMjxbCHfWBntpjq2S4NDQVDwdd8WjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to develop a plugin for QGIS with PyQgis and I am wondering how
is possible to get the adjacency for a network.

I have two layers, nodes.shp and link.shp. The nodes.shp are the vertex of
the links.shp. So my idea was to create a buffer of nodes.shp and then
intersect this buff_nodes.shp with link.shp and get the the attributes
which are connected between them.

I tried to do in this way, and when I intersect the buffer with link
doesn't give me any  file with the intersection. I don't  know if that is
because can no be intersected polynes and polygins or what.

I am new using the libraries of pyqgis and maybe is already developed some
library which calculates it automatically. So...

Anyone knows or has any idea how to get the adjacency matrix of a
vectorLayer?


Thanks in advance

+1 with Paolo
I prefer the new default qgis icon set, but I do not understand why we need
to remove the other icon sets, as long as the "qgis" theme is the new
default one.

A big -1 for the project maintaining 2 themes. If the old default is not
maintained with distinctly different icons (it hasn't been for a while)
then it only presents more hodge-podge-looking design for the project to
end users.

If something ships with the final release package, it should be maintained.
IMO, the old default theme is not maintained (and looks like it), therefore
it should not ship, and no more energy should be wasted on maintaining it.

This is similar to the decision to focus on only master branch and release
the app from it, instead of maintaining multiple version branches with
backports. It really comes down to streamlining the whole release process
and providing a quality app, all with limited development resources,
instead of trying to be everything to all users. Using that paradigm,
maintaining a second, defunct theme just doesn't seem reasonable.

I do think the multi-theme code should be left, so third-party devs or
users can use their own themes, but this does mean those users need to
recompile the app. (Current theme support does not allow run-time switching
of the theme, even after a restart.)


A big +1 for only focusing on fixing the current issues with the new
default theme, AND extending the GUI/string freeze until it is ready for
2.0 release (though the hard feature/API freeze should happen really soon).

Towards that move-forward-only goal, and given the obvious time
constraints, I propose the following:

1) List all icons on a single wiki page - Something similar was started
back in 2011 [0]. Just updating that page should work. This means all icons
in main image.qrc and for core plugins that have their own .qrc files.

2) Comment on specific icons or groups of icons - Everyone puts their
comments on that wiki page, hopefully in a constructive and timely manner
(within the next 3-5 days?).

3) Fix a subset of icons for 2.0 - Once problem icons are identified, fix
the most problematic ones for 2.0 release. This does mean that some more
icons will later change on 2.1 release (to update all of the theme), but no
icon should change at both releases, especially the core, main interface
icons.

Using this method, Robert, and anyone helping him, can focus directly on
what needs fixed, and prioritize those fixes for a 2.0 release.

Layer toolbar could look like this [1], except OWS icons.
Oracle Spatial logo was not found, so I took 'O' from Oracle, but it 
looks ugly in this context. Combination of this 'O' with database symbol 
doesn't look nice either. Some proposals ...?

We could leave old database symbol with different colours, but MSSQL, 
SpatiaLite and Oracle icons are mainly red so this will be hard. 
Additionally we must remember about color-blind persons.

regards,
Robert

Hey all,

So lets say I want to drop a QGIS raster layer out into a numpy array order
to do some calculations.  What is the best way to do that? or is there a
way to do raster math in QGIS via python?

For accessing raster files, the GDAL library is used. 

so:

   rasterPath = "the original path of your layer" 
   ds = gdal.Open("rasterPath")
   band1 = ds.GetRasterBand(1)  
   band2 = ds.GetRasterBand(2)  
   band3 = ds.GetRasterBand(3)  
 
and with numpy
   import numpy as np
   from osgeo import gdal
   ds = gdal.Open("rasterPath")
   band1 = np.array(ds.GetRasterBand(1).ReadAsArray())
   band2 = np.array(ds.GetRasterBand(2).ReadAsArray())
   band3 = np.array(ds.GetRasterBand(3).ReadAsArray())

Yes, use the networkx Python module with one layer (see How to transform a
shapefile in Python or a ESRI feature class in a topological network in 
http://www.portailsig.org/content/python-comment-transformer-un-fichier-shapefile-ou-une-feature-class-d-esri-en-un-reseau-top
<http://www.portailsig.org/content/python-comment-transformer-un-fichier-shapefile-ou-une-feature-class-d-esri-en-un-reseau-top>  
in French)

     import networkx as nx
     G = nx.read_shp('mylines.shp')
     print(G.nodes())
     [(1.0, 2.0), (3.0, 2.0), (0.0, 0.0), (3.0, 1.0), (4.0, 4.0), (2.0,
1.0), (2.0, 4.0), (1.0, 3.0), (2.0, 3.0), (1.0, 4.0), (4.0, 3.0), (4.0,
2.0), (3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 1.0)]
     print(G.edges())
     [((1.0, 2.0), (1.0, 1.0)), ((3.0, 2.0) ....
     
and the adjacency matrix with

<http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/generated/networkx.linalg.graphmatrix.adjacency_matrix.html> 
?

The Network analysis library
(http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/network-analysis.html) use this Python
module and see the direct application of graph theory in "QGIS and Graph
analysis" in  http://groupefmr.hypotheses.org/1254
<http://groupefmr.hypotheses.org/1254>   (in French),  with an experimental
QGIS plugin

You can also use the Shapely modules for planar graphs

Hi

I also think there is no point in maintaining two iconsets - lets
rather use the good feedback in this thread to make Roberts icon set
awesome.

@Robert - what about using a background colour scheme whereby e.g. all
add layer icons get the same background colour and then you can remove
e.g. the + and layer picture elements as they are visually grouped.
Just a thought anyway....

Regards

Tim

Ok, I hadn't really thought about the browser much .. so far I've not used it much myself and nor have most of the people I work with. 

It certainly creates a challenge with delimited text files generally, as they don't have any inherent spatial intelligence.  So just dragging them to the map without a intermediate dlalog is going to be limiting.   Which I guess is where you are coming from with the CSVT/VRT file idea.  Seeing it in the browser makes it much clearer to me.

I think it may be better to extend the CSVT idea than use VRT.  The advantage of CSVT is that it is implicitly associated with the data file.  The VRT file could be anywhere, and have any name - the user would be selecting the VRT file rather than the CSV file with the actual data.  It seems more intuitive to me to be selecting the data file. 

The CSVT file is also analagous to metadata files that are alongside images (eg world files), so there is a good precedent. 

Perhaps the way to go is to add more functionality to the CSVT file (to incorporate the features of the  VRT/DLT driver).  I wonder if the place to do the work is in GDAL/OGR, rather than in QGIS?  Once the capabilities are there, then the QGIS dialog would just be a way of writing the csvt file if you wanted to...

So we would be looking at something more like a VRT file in content (though perhaps not XML in terms of end user accessibility) but automatically associated with the file by its name, rather than the other way round as in the VRT file.

If we were doing that, then we might want to use something a bit more identifiable than just adding a 't' to the file name.  Maybe adding an extension like .gmd (geographic metadata) would be better.  Also much easier to identify with confidence in the browser, particularly since we wouldn't just be using data files with .csv extensions.

Cheers
Chris

Hi Chris,
you are right, reading csvt is enough at the moment, and merging spreadsheet with ogr data source in one only dialog might be complex and need prototyping.  In the other end, we have growing toolbars with more an more datasources, and many users switch to browser panel. I'm trying to have QGIS as simple as possible for the end users I manage here, and few of them have advanced informatic skills.

I think I will first hire someone to prototype things as you suggest and submit it to community. Work is important if we want that all access (drag-drop / browser / toolbar menu) lead to same behaviour, but it's necessary.

Thanks again, I see things more clearly now.

Hi R?gis

Don't get too excited, I just said I wouldn't start looking at it till then!!!

As it turns out, not true. I figured out overnight that adding reading the csvt file is a very small safe change, so I've pushed it up to master.  Hope no one minds - my first real commit since being given the privilege.

So the provider will read .csvt files (or .xxxt files, basically the data file name with a 't' appended to it).

A long way short of the ideas you were talking about, but a start.

On your question about a unified vector dialog, I'm not sure.  I guess it may be good to mock something up in python first.  If I understand correctly you are wanting to add spreadsheets etc to the dialog, and manage the OGR drivers as well.  The dlt txt dialog is already busy with just it's own stuff, so I'm not sure how it would work.  Maybe something similar to the way renderers are handled, so each file type has its own widget.  Also the OGR/dlt txt options are different, so that could be challenging.

My thinking so far is more about improving the dlt txt dialog so that it is easy to select all the options at once, or have them read from a metadata file if one is present...

Cheers
Chris

Hi Alexander

Good thought.  If you are loading several files at the moment QGIS should remember the settings between files, so you only have to select them and add them, not redo the settings.  But it is still a lot of clicks for each file.

It would be fairly easy to add multiple files.  I guess you'd just use the first selected file in the preview and then take those settings for all the files.  Only a couple of messy user interface things ..

1) Once a list of files are selected from browse buttin, how to display the selected file names in the text box.  Would this become a drop down list? Or would we use a list of file names with a separator (and if so, what separator)?  Should the text box allow wild card file names?  There must be a precedent for this somewhere, just can't think of one straight away.

2) Handling of layer names for each file.  Could just be the file name (which is the default layer name anyway).  Could have some way of entering the filename into a string (eg <filename>).  Whatever is used it should be consistent with the rest of QGIS (expression builder? not sure there is anywhere variables are used in this way), and obvious for the user...

Any thoughts on this?

Cheers
Chris

Hi,

also another useful option will be ability lo load multiple CSV files
at once using same
settings. Now, if I want load many CSV file I should open them one by
one, set settings
and then load. I know, this can be implemented as script but not all
users like scripting.

Hi,

I'm going to have to do a series of actions about 20 times, so I'd like to
automate the process, but I don't know how to get started. What to import?
What functions to call?

Here's what I need to do:

Add Vector Layer
  File/Latin1/ -> 2 layers

One layer has points with address information, the other has polygons of
building shapes

Vector/Analysis Tools/Point in Polygon

-> PNTCNT

Query on the new CNT layer -> save buildings with one PNTCNT=1 to
only1address.shp
                                                   save buildings with
PNTCNT=0 or PNTCNT>1 to not1address.shp

Vector/Data Management Tools/Join Attributes By Location
  Target Layer: only1address.shp
  Join Vector Layer: AdPt
  To: BuildingsWith1Address

Then I want to remove several fields and create new fields with the field
calculator, to create one field with both French and Dutch names combined.


I create a few more vector layers (one with the other set of building
shapes, one with the address nodes that didn't become one address
buildings) and in the end I need to merge them once again.

Vector/Merge Shapefiles to One


Could somebody get me started with that? Point my nose in the right
direction?

Thanks,

Jo

Hi Bob and Deb

Field in the VRT file is fine .. and VRT covers most of the other requirements (needs a bit more in terms of delimiters etc).  CSVT is at the moment completely inadequate as a metadata format.

The issue isn't about the format or content though, it is about the association between the data file and the metadata.  The premise here is that from a users point of view it is the data file they are interested in.  So when they select the data file the metadata needs to be associated with it by default.  This isn't the case with a VRT file, which defines the data source independently of where it is. 

All this could perhaps be handled by expanding the VRT format  to allow it to sit alongside the datafile readily (say an option like besideVRT instead of relativeToVRT)  and adding the additional parameters OGR CSV driver, as well as making the CSV driver handle files with extensions other than csv.  For data files the besideVRT option would also make it much easier to create VRT files, as they could just be renamed to be used for a different file.  besideVRT would mean use the file with the same name as the VRT, minus the VRT extension.

Cheers
Chris

It seems more intuitive to me to be selecting the data file.

The CSVT file is also analagous to metadata files that are alongside images (eg world files), so there is a good precedent.

Perhaps the way to go is to add more functionality to the CSVT file (to incorporate the features of the  VRT/DLT driver).  I wonder if the place to do the work is in GDAL/OGR, rather than in QGIS?  Once the capabilities are there, then the QGIS dialog would just be a way of writing the csvt file if you wanted to...

So we would be looking at something more like a VRT file in content (though perhaps not XML in terms of end user accessibility) but automatically associated with the file by its name, rather than the other way round as in the VRT file.

If we were doing that, then we might want to use something a bit more identifiable than just adding a 't' to the file name.  Maybe adding an extension like .gmd (geographic metadata) would be better.  Also much easier to identify with confidence in the browser, particularly since we wouldn't just be using data files with .csv extensions.

Cheers
Chris

Hi Chris,
you are right, reading csvt is enough at the moment, and merging spreadsheet with ogr data source in one only dialog might be complex and need prototyping.  In the other end, we have growing toolbars with more an more datasources, and many users switch to browser panel. I'm trying to have QGIS as simple as possible for the end users I manage here, and few of them have advanced informatic skills.

I think I will first hire someone to prototype things as you suggest and submit it to community. Work is important if we want that all access (drag-drop / browser / toolbar menu) lead to same behaviour, but it's necessary.

Thanks again, I see things more clearly now.
R?gis

Hi R?gis

Don't get too excited, I just said I wouldn't start looking at it till then!!!

As it turns out, not true. I figured out overnight that adding reading the csvt file is a very small safe change, so I've pushed it up to master.  Hope no one minds - my first real commit since being given the privilege.

So the provider will read .csvt files (or .xxxt files, basically the data file name with a 't' appended to it).

A long way short of the ideas you were talking about, but a start.

On your question about a unified vector dialog, I'm not sure.  I guess it may be good to mock something up in python first.  If I understand correctly you are wanting to add spreadsheets etc to the dialog, and manage the OGR drivers as well.  The dlt txt dialog is already busy with just it's own stuff, so I'm not sure how it would work.  Maybe something similar to the way renderers are handled, so each file type has its own widget.  Also the OGR/dlt txt options are different, so that could be challenging.

My thinking so far is more about improving the dlt txt dialog so that it is easy to select all the options at once, or have them read from a metadata file if one is present...

Cheers
Chris

Hi Chris,
I wish I had some time to help you coding . That's faster than contracting!
What is your opinion about a unified vector dialog? If I start a call for offers, I must at least be sure community agrees..

Can we finally remove the old label UI from the layer properties dialog?
 Could we remove it by default and just enable it for old project that have
old labels defined.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
geod and invgeod, programs for performing geodesic calculations, have
been part of proj.4 since at least 1995.  There are several problems
with them:

* the overall accuracy is limited;

* the results of inverse calculations are sometimes wildly wrong;

* there's no documented API for the geodesic capabilities;

* there's no provision from computing various quantities associated with
   geodesics (in particular the area of a geodesic polygon).

These problems will be addressed in the next release of proj.4 with the
inclusion of the algorithms for geodesics from GeographicLib.  These are
documented in

   C. F. F. Karney,
   Algorithms for geodesics,
   J. Geodesy 87(1), 43-55 (Jan. 2013)
   http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00190-012-0578-z
   Addenda: http://geographiclib.sf.net/geod-addenda.html

Points to note:
[...]

* Several libraries that depend on proj.4, e.g., GRASS, use approximate
   methods for computing polygonal areas.  They can now use proj.4 to
   compute areas accurately.

Good morning,

So I'm not a developer by any stretch - but I'm using QGIS for 90% of my 
GIS desktop needs. I have a suggestion/question on snapping. I'm 
currently using QGIS on a large project in the US Virgin Islands. We ran 
into a problem (I hate to call it that) with snapping between two point 
layers. If I set up snapping properly I can add a feature and have it 
snap to the other data layer (point on top of another point). If I bring 
in two existing point layers I can't get them to snap. Example (excuse 
poorly drawn attachment).

  * I had an existing layer of Houses as points.
  * I collected data using a GPS and needed the new GPS point to snap to
    the existing house point. I know I can most likely do this in
    postGIS (and I can do it in openjump).I can also do this in ArcGIS.
  * I move the GPS point towards the house point (within snapping
    tolerance) and it doesn't snap.I tried several different things to
    try to make this work.
  * This also came up in the QGIS class I taught last week and several
    of us tried but couldn't get it to work. All the people in the class
    were arcgis users.


Question (and I know this should head to the user list) am I missing 
something?
If not - Can this functionality be added to help users in the snapping 
realm?

Thank you for all of your excellent work on the 2.0 release.

Randy

Hi Chris,

2013/5/26 Chris Crook <ccrook at linz.govt.nz>:
> Good thought.  If you are loading several files at the moment QGIS should remember the settings between files, so you only have to select them and add them, not redo the settings.  But it is still a lot of clicks for each file.

Right, now settings are saved between files, but users still need to
select file one by one. Not userfriendly IMO.

> 1) Once a list of files are selected from browse buttin, how to display the selected file names in the text box.  Would this become a drop down list? Or would we use a list of file names with a separator (and if so, what separator)?  Should the text box allow wild card file names?  There must be a precedent for this somewhere, just can't think of one straight away.

Why not show full file names with separator like semicolon? If I'm not
wrong, same approach used in GDALTools plugin when
multiple files selected.

> 2) Handling of layer names for each file.  Could just be the file name (which is the default layer name anyway).  Could have some way of entering the filename into a string (eg <filename>).  Whatever is used it should be consistent with the rest of QGIS (expression builder? not sure there is anywhere variables are used in this way), and obvious for the user...

For me using filename as layer name is fine

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using QgsMapLayer's title for QgsComposerLayerItem
	?
Message-ID: <51A26A09.8050509@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to know if youthink it's a good idea to use QgsMapLayer's 
title for QgsComposerLayerItem.

My idea is to use the title, set in layer metadata, in the legend by 
default.

If you're OK, I can push my commit.

Hi

The python cookbook is a good place to start:

Also look at other plugins that do something similar to your
requirements and see how they work.

Hi Alexander

Quite agree that it is still not user friendly.  I have a patch which allows multiselect in the dialog.  It is a little unclean in that it may ask for the coordinate system for each file (depending on current settings), but that would require changes outside of the provider I think.

I've not pushed this to master - I think it should wait till after 2.0 now as it will add a few more translations.  That said, it would be nice to have it consistent with the AddVectorLayer dialog.  It is available at..

https://github.com/ccrook/Quantum-GIS/tree/csv_multi_select

Cheers
Chris

Hi Chris,

2013/5/26 Chris Crook <ccrook at linz.govt.nz>:
> Good thought.  If you are loading several files at the moment QGIS should remember the settings between files, so you only have to select them and add them, not redo the settings.  But it is still a lot of clicks for each file.

Right, now settings are saved between files, but users still need to
select file one by one. Not userfriendly IMO.

> 1) Once a list of files are selected from browse buttin, how to display the selected file names in the text box.  Would this become a drop down list? Or would we use a list of file names with a separator (and if so, what separator)?  Should the text box allow wild card file names?  There must be a precedent for this somewhere, just can't think of one straight away.

Why not show full file names with separator like semicolon? If I'm not
wrong, same approach used in GDALTools plugin when
multiple files selected.

> 2) Handling of layer names for each file.  Could just be the file name (which is the default layer name anyway).  Could have some way of entering the filename into a string (eg <filename>).  Whatever is used it should be consistent with the rest of QGIS (expression builder? not sure there is anywhere variables are used in this way), and obvious for the user...

For me using filename as layer name is fine

Hi Ivan,

I updated the plugin with your useful comments. You have a version 0.4 
available.

Regarding the schema tables names, I have filled a pull request here 
<https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/audit-trigger/pull/2>https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/audit-trigger/pull/2/files
You can use my branch if you like: 
https://github.com/3nids/audit-trigger/blob/schemasafe/audit.sql

I have an issue tracker on github: 
https://github.com/3nids/postgres91plusauditor/issues

Thanks a lot for your comments and for your time at testing, it's really 
appreciated! I am waiting for these bugs ;)

Greetings,

Denis

Hi Larry,
Thanks for the explanations.
I do understand very well that expressions won't work with  label manual tools. I now understand that I didn't find the field list because it is below expression item, and I went to fast. See [0]. Putting expression item to the bottom of list, and renaming the entries as follow should be better IMHO, since expression is more advanced:
"Field types : String, Int, Double"  -> "choose Field ( enable map tools)"
"Edit expression" ->" Calculate value with expression (disable map tool)"
Does that sound good?

All the best

Hi R?gis,

Hi all,
Larry, first, congratulations for the great labeling refactoring, this is
huge!

I couldn't find a way to enable the move / rotate tools in toolbar, in edit
mode, after having defined fields for X and Y in expression. Tools that
opens a dialog to modify font, text.. is working, but I couldn't change Y X
values in it.
Is this an issue or a I missing something?

There is a short description about this below those settings:
"( Define attribute fields to enable labeling map tools )"
It means that only an attribute field mapping data definition can be used to enable the labeling map tools (e.g. Move, Rotate, Change Properties). An expression does not work. Since those tools directly edit the attribute table, access to the field needs to be established, i.e. a data defined mapped attribute field.
While it is possible to find out what attribute fields (aka columns) are referenced within an expression, there is no simple means of determining any one of those fields are intended to be open for writing new values. It is possible when there is only one field in the expression, and no other parts to the expression, to use it directly, but then why not just map a field?
There are use cases for allowing expressions for all of those settings (X, Y, Alignments, Rotation), so limiting those data definitions to only allowing attribute field mappings would not be a good idea.

It looks like the 1 line help description, noted above, needs more work. Maybe invert the logic?:
"(Defining expressions will disable labeling map tools)"

Also, a good and concise contextual help needs drafted to explain new labeling options and how they work. Then, expanded upon for inclusion in general documentation.

Regards,
Larry

This sounds good to me, as I had the same problem easilly finding the way
to choose fields here.

One more tip,
Users here often don't get immediately that labeling with toolbar require to put layer in editing mode. Maybe could we append a comment in data defined options :
[..] Define attribute fields and activate editing of layer to enable labeling map tools. [..]

Hi R?gis,

Hi all,
Larry, first, congratulations for the great labeling refactoring, this is
huge!

I couldn't find a way to enable the move / rotate tools in toolbar, in edit
mode, after having defined fields for X and Y in expression. Tools that
opens a dialog to modify font, text.. is working, but I couldn't change Y X
values in it.
Is this an issue or a I missing something?

There is a short description about this below those settings:
"( Define attribute fields to enable labeling map tools )"
It means that only an attribute field mapping data definition can be used to enable the labeling map tools (e.g. Move, Rotate, Change Properties). An expression does not work. Since those tools directly edit the attribute table, access to the field needs to be established, i.e. a data defined mapped attribute field.
While it is possible to find out what attribute fields (aka columns) are referenced within an expression, there is no simple means of determining any one of those fields are intended to be open for writing new values. It is possible when there is only one field in the expression, and no other parts to the expression, to use it directly, but then why not just map a field?
There are use cases for allowing expressions for all of those settings (X, Y, Alignments, Rotation), so limiting those data definitions to only allowing attribute field mappings would not be a good idea.

It looks like the 1 line help description, noted above, needs more work. Maybe invert the logic?:
"(Defining expressions will disable labeling map tools)"

Also, a good and concise contextual help needs drafted to explain new labeling options and how they work. Then, expanded upon for inclusion in general documentation.

Regards,
Larry

Not sure.  This commander lists only algorythm, am I right?

The HUB idea is create shortcut and search facility for every menu item.

Or is it me who's missing something?

Switching the order should help. Originally, the button's menu didn't have
a field's submenu, and the fields were listed at the bottom of the menu (to
allow for an unknown number of entries). That didn't work well for tables
with lots of columns, since it often pushed access to expression menu
actions off the screen; so I made a submenu.

Changing the menu action text to long descriptions, like the proposed one
for expression, may lead to 'missing' the entry to the submenu while
mousing that far to the right. The text's width will dictate the total
width of the menu. This was a problem with the expression string menu
entry, which is now truncated.

I'd prefer to just explain it better in the text below the buttons and in
those button's description/tool tip.

Regards,

Larry

Hi all.
I get rare and random bocks in qgis-server. This may be due to accumulating errors
because of invalid geometries:
ignoring invalid feature 141
etc.
Anything I can do to improve the situation?
Thanks.

Hey all,

So what is the current plans for once QGIS 2.0 is released.  Are we
planning on making minor point releases, or at least weekly builds on a
different branch for the major platforms e.g 2.0.1. As 2.0 is going to be a
massive release I have no doubt there might be things that pop up after we
have it out the door.

Do we have provisions to be able to make easy 2.0.1, 2.0.2 releases?

I think we should try to do it, if at all possible.
Before that, what is the current plans for the QGIS 2.0 release?
I see we have a lot of blockers, and new tickets are flocking in.
All the best.

Hi Nathan, 
good top open this thread, you are right that bugfixing releases will
probably be necessary. 

Concerning new features, I just point out that I will work and try to focus
on improvements and new features  described here [0] , if that helps to
define roadmap versions:

 Hi Paolo,

 Sorry - I can't help with this. I do not observe these issues. Maybe I 
 do not have too many geometry errors in my data.

 You probably need to debug this with a debug release and gdb.

 Hi,

 The Ubuntu HUD seems to be quite new and the information for developers 
 is still missing - see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/HUD

Hi Paolo

If you have a small and easy reproducable test case, you could create a 
ticket and attach the data.

Regards,
Marco

 Hi,

 I just tested it. Apparently, this only works in Ubuntu mode (with 
 Unity) - not in KDE.

 So it already works for the QGIS menu entries. You need the latest 
 Ubuntu 13.04, start QGIS and press the alt-key. Then a text input field 
 comes up and you can start typing, e.g. "Postgis" or "Layer" or "Vector" 
 - all matching menu entries come up, regardless of their location in the 
 menu.

 I do not know if such a HUD could be developed in a 
 platform-independent way. Would be cool if it were. But currently this 
 looks like a Ubuntu Unity only technology.

 Andreas

Hi,

OK.

I have 12.04, the HUD enabled and it is not working.
I'll wait for next LTS to upgrade.

So, nothing to do more on the dev side apparently.

Thanks

Denis

In-Reply-To: <CALCNqkZuFfzCJRB6pYnJN2+aia3aNQ8ADGtAnUbVAFuRjkfSbA@mail.gmail.com>

Message-ID: <201305271423.17196.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

Hi All,

The new manager is ready. Here is a screenshot for impatient ones :) 
http://tmp.borysjurgiel.pl/manager4.png

The code is in a branch "newmanager":
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/5ee09d362148c411047a0fc7bc22679d9989f771

As it affects a number of classes, please review the architecture summary 
below and if there is no veto, it's ready to be merged to master. Otherewise I'll
make requested changes before merging.


*QgsPluginItem*
==========
Removed. It only used in the old manager and wasn't usefull anymore.



*QgsDetailedItemData, QgsDetailedItemDelegate and QgsDetailedItemWidget*
==========
Untouched. It was used in the old manager and Grass Plugin, now it's used
exclusively by Grass Plugin.



*QgsPluginMedatadata*
==========
Untouched, however I propose to rename it to QgsPluginItem or QgsPluginRegistryItem 
for consistency. It's only used in QgsPluginRegistry and it mainly conatains 
pointers to loaded plugins instances, while its name may imply a rich metadata 
map. If some day during QGIS 2.x lifetime the Manager will need a separate class 
for storing rich metadata (now QMap is enough), and it would be nice to use this name.



*QgsPluginRegistry*
==========
Info: This class is a registry for instances of lodaded plugins. It has nothing to to 
with metadata and it works independently from the manager, just by restoring 
session plugins from QSettings. Manager only calls its method to load and unload plugins.

Small change: as it already had methods loadCppPlugin() and loadPythonPlugin(), 
I've added also unloadCppPlugin() and unloadPythonPlugin() too keep the 
loading/unloading stuff in one place. 

Diff:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/5ee09d362148c411047a0fc7bc22679d9989f771/diff/src/app/qgspluginregistry.h
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/5ee09d362148c411047a0fc7bc22679d9989f771/diff/src/app/qgspluginregistry.cpp



*QgsPluginManager*
==========
Completely rewritten and moved to src/app/pluginmanager/ subdirectory 
class for the dialog window. Important facts:

1) It keeps plugin metadata registry just in nested QMap:
QMap< QString, QMap<QString,QString> >   mPlugins;

where the first key is library/module basename, and the second one is attribute 
name. There was no need to create a separate class for storing metadata, 
however, some day it may become convinient to create a class called QgsPluginMedatadata. 
For this reason I propose to rename the current QgsPluginMedatadata 
(what actually has nothing to do with metadata) before releasing QGIS 2.0. 
The list of used attributes is provided in the "metadata" file and it's an unification 
of existing fields from repository xml, metadata.txt, the old installer and c++ plugins. 
QgsPluginManager populates this field (let's call it metadata registry) with 
c++ plugins when the window is opened. On the contrary, Python plugins 
are handled on Python's side and they are appended to mPlugins by API.

2) The plugin list view uses QStandardItemModel populated from mPlugins 
and also QgsPluginSortFilterProxyModel for filtering and sorting.

3) The html metadata browser is quite simple, and we can extend it in QGIS 2.1. 
For example, some tags can be clickable and set a new filter (filter by clicked 
author/tag/status). Also the separate buttons Install/Uninstall can be 
implemented by html "buttonsm", and the popup dialog with installation progress 
can be replaced by animated image (this way we don't freeze the gui when installing).

Code:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/5ee09d362148c411047a0fc7bc22679d9989f771/entry/src/app/pluginmanager/qgspluginmanager.h

*QgsPluginSortFilterProxyModel*
==========
New class: just a sort-filter proxy for the metadata. Filtering is done by status 
in the left list as well as name/description/tags/author in the filter input line. 
Sorting is done by rightclicking on the list. Foltering and sorting is based 
on a few user data roles. I tried to read necessary data from mPlugins everytime, 
but it affected the performance too much.

Code:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/5ee09d362148c411047a0fc7bc22679d9989f771/entry/src/app/pluginmanager/qgspluginsortfilterproxymodel.h

*QgsAppPluginManagerInterface, QgsPluginManagerInterface and SIP binding*
==========
New classes: just the interface to QgsPluginManager. Is's exactly based 
on the existing Qgs(App)LegendInterface

Code:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/5ee09d362148c411047a0fc7bc22679d9989f771/entry/python/gui/qgspluginmanagerinterface.sip

QgisApp
==========
Small change: initialize the QgsPluginManager and Python module 
pyplugin_installer in the constructor. Only open the QgsPluginManager window 
when called from the main menu.

Diff:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/5ee09d362148c411047a0fc7bc22679d9989f771/diff/src/app/qgisapp.h

QgisAppInterface and QgisInterface and SIP binding
==========
Small change: instantiate Qgs(App)PluginManagerInterface 
exactly the same way as Qgs(App)LegendInterface

Diff:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/5ee09d362148c411047a0fc7bc22679d9989f771/diff/src/app/qgisappinterface.h

pyplugin_installer Python module
==========
New python module in python/pyplugin_installer. It contains just slightly refactored 
code of the old plugin_installer plugin and provides backend for handling Python 
plugis, e.g.: fetching remote repositories, loading installed plugin metadata, finding 
upgradeable plugins, (un)installing python plugins etc. It's methods are called from 
QgsPluginManager and it calls QgsPluginManager methods via QgsPluginManagerInterface.

Code:

Hey Borys,

That looks bloody great!  Going to give it a test soon.

Hi all.
Since a few days, I'm getting

RuntimeError: the sip module implements API v8.0 to v8.1 but the qgis.core module
requires API v9.2

Packages from debian-nightly, sid.
Anything wrong?
All the best.

mmm, I guess so. The toolbox will not show up until invoked, so it's a
good idea to have it active by default. Only the "Analysis" menu will
be shown.

It might take a bit longer to load SEXTANTE than other plugins, but
not so long, i guess...

Thanks for pointing this out!

If I would speak for myself, I would agree; however, most GIS users do not do
analyses (surprising, isn'it?), and Sextante eats up a lot of scree space, so this
choice should be considered carefully.
All the best.

If I remember correctly by default toolbox is hidden, only "Analysis" menu added
after plugin activation

Borys, I think this is not working. I have received reports of people
having SEXTANTE 1.0.9 interfering with the core 1.1 version, and I
tested it myself. If you have a plugin in .qgis2, it will override the
core one (as you mention), but no warning is produced.

Thanks in advance

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server - GetPrint request does not respect
 text boxes size and position if dynamic content passed
Message-ID: <51A3C0AC.3000708@gmail.com>

Hi Marco and other devs,

In src/mapserver/qgsconfigparser.cpp:530 we can read :

   //replace label text
   foreach ( QgsComposerLabel *currentLabel, composerLabels )
   {
     QString title = parameterMap.value( currentLabel->id().toUpper() );

     if ( title.isEmpty() )
     {
       //remove exported labels not referenced in the request
       if ( !currentLabel->id().isEmpty() )
       {
         c->removeItem( currentLabel );
         delete currentLabel;
       }
       continue;
     }

     currentLabel->setText( title );
     currentLabel->adjustSizeToText();
   }

This code is used to draw composer label with value defined by the QGIS 
WMS Server Request GetPrint.

The bug defined in the issues #7894 http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7894 is 
probably du to the method adjustSizeToText()
Someone can confim it ?

Question for Marco, Why removed label, if the request doesn't define a 
value ? Why not used the default value ?

Regards,
Ren?-Luc D'Hont

This is an interesting idea, but I'm afraid hard to implement. We could 
get very strange mixture of colours (location of icons changes...). We 
could also make one background colour per toolbar. But there are several 
toolbars and we (man) - in opposite to women - don't recognize so many 
colours :)

Maybe simply skip some icon elements in toolbars, with many similar 
operations (like add layer)?

Robert

Just a thought, but most of the problems are due to the fact each *add feature* has an icon for "quick access". I would simply vote to have an unified add data button and then select the data you want, someone has proposed something about it but don?t know if it will make it for 2.0 nor do I remember the exact reference. IMHO QGIS has way to many icons cluttering the UI and using precious space specially on small screen laptops

We are waiting for the last feature from Borys to make its way into master
and then we will be feature complete. Once that is the case I will put out
a new timetable for getting 2.0 out the door, but you can expect delays
from the original anticipated early June release.

Undoubtedly we will have to release with blockers open or delay the
release.

Hi Ren?-Luc

I guess yes. 'adjustSizeToText()' works for text, not html. Html support 
for composer label was added recently to the composer label class. 
Please adapt the relevant lines to work with html labels too.

 >Question for Marco, Why removed label, if the request doesn't define a 
value ? Why not used the default value ?

The idea was that the web client has the possibility to remove an 
advertised text label completely if it is not used. E.g. if a 
composition defines a text item with id 'author', the web client can 
simply ignore it if it does not want to have author's name printed. Note 
that the labels without ids are not removed as they are considered to be 
fix, so not subject to client text replacement (original meaning of 
label id was that this text item is subject to text replacement by web 
client. Later, the id has been generalized as an id for every item type).

Another possibility would be to remove the item only if the client gives 
an empty text and use the default text otherwise. What do you think?

Regards,
Marco

+1 for unified data adding button. From a use-perspective there's no good
reason that raster adding should be separate from vectors for instance.


Relating to the new iconset - I agree with liking the style and see what
it's trying to do. The design philosophy seems to be that there are common
components which are then glued together. A yellow star seems to mean
"new", a magnifying glass means some sort of zoom thing etc.

It's logical, the sort of thing that makes sense to a developer.

The problem is, I don't believe it works. Icons should be
immediately recognisable - if you have 10 (TEN!) icons which have a big
magnifying glass and then only a small portion of the icon is different
between each of them, they become harder to use.

In depth example: take the Back, Next, and Refresh view icons. The new QGIS
icons all have a magnifying glass behind them (I can barely make out the
"refresh" circle). Why? In comparison, I have four web-browsers in front of
me, all have these buttons and all of them are simple arrows/refresh
circles. None of them have a picture of a web-page behind them.
ArcGIS and MapModeller both use simple arrows/circles too. MapInfo doesn't
seem to have this functionality.
At this point these icons are standard conventions, but the QGIS 2.0
iconography makes that part only 1/6th of the actual icon, instead giving
prominence to a magnifying glass that's entirely unnecessary.

I prefer to remove the label only if the user gives an empty text.
Can I do it ?

Hi

I just made a small test and commented the line
currentLabel->adjustSizeToText();
Then recompile QGIS master and tested it with a classical text box (not
html rendered) with a long text.

I personnaly prefer the behaviour when this method is not called : the text
box keep the size set by the user in QGIS. And the text wraps when it
reaches the right side of the Box. I even tried with "HTML rendered" on
(and my fake X Server running), and it worked well too.

At the contrary, when adjustSizeToText is used, the box is transformed in a
one line box, which goes to the right of the entire composition (out of it)
: text does not wrap.

So for me, simply removing the adjustSizeToText call would be enough. Or we
have to make sure this method does the job correctly, which may be a bit
hard to implement : we need to avoid to have collision with other
composition items, etc.

Regards
Michael

While I agree to some degree (+1 for unified data adding button), I think
we have to be fair and recognize that a GIS is a little more complex than a
web browser and will always have more buttons. Many functions which have
only one meaning in a simpler application can have different meanings in a
GIS depending on context. To simply assume the context from the placement
in a certain toolbar could raise other issues.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi list

Since a couple of months, a hug work has been made by some devs to bring
the expression based feature almost everywhere (styling, labelling, field
calculator, etc.) : a big thank for this.

I would like to know how much effort would be neede to add the expressions
in the diagrams. For example we could let the user choose an expression for

* the value of each class
* the color of each class.

I have already talked about it on irc, but unfortunately I cannot remember
with who (sorry...).

Any chance to have it for 2.0 ? (hum hum, I know this is feature freeze )

Subject: [Qgis-developer] new QgsDebugCall macro
Message-ID: <20130528103012.GJ17967@gnash>

I've pushed a new debugging macro for use to simplify tracing of
functions enter/exit events.

Use like this:

 void QgsMapToolNodeTool::canvasPressEvent( QMouseEvent * e )
 {
   QgsDebugCall;
   ....
 }

To get (with debugging builds) log messages like this:

 Debug: src/app/nodetool/qgsmaptoolnodetool.cpp: 348: (canvasPressEvent) Entering.
 Debug: src/app/nodetool/qgsmaptoolnodetool.cpp: 348: (canvasPressEvent) Leaving.

With non-debugging builds there will be no overhead.

Hi Michael,

There is also a feature request open for this
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6768

I think this won't be an option for 2.0 but if there is a sponsor 
around, I could make it for 2.1. But we should first think about what 
features this would include.
Do you see a benefit of having data defined colors? Having the same 
class with different colors on different diagrams seems odd to me. Can 
you give an example of where this might be useful?

Ok, thanks for pointing it.

Unfortunately I cannot be the one sponsoring :(

I totally agree. Diagrams have a lot of options, so we must focus on most
wanted options imho.

I forgot to say I would like to use this with text diagrams. I would like
to be able to choose a color (here for the printed text inside each text
diagram slice) depending on data values. For example, print
* slice 1 : temperature in green under 20?C, orange between 20 and 25, red
above 25?C.
* slice 2 : pressure with text color depending on other values
* slice 3: ..., etc.

We could also imagine to draw the "text diagrams" not in a circle, but in a
rectangle, or in honeycomb shapes, etc. The basic idea is to represent some
fields in the same order for each feature (as the text diagram does), and
to use the color (which could be the background color instead of the text
color) in order to represent the value intensity.

Cheers
Michael

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS vs. GEOS geometry validation
Message-ID: <20130528115757.GB24931@gnash>

I'm playing with editing a ~50k vertices polygon with qgis and found
that the QGIS geometry validation takes a lot lot more than the GEOS
one (Settings -> Options -> Digitizing -> Validate geometries).

Is there a reason why QGIS is the default, when GEOS is available ?

Is there a reason (other than an historical one) why raster Thumbnails, Legend, and

No objection from me. Currently, I'm not using the text replacement

a bit hard to implement : we need to avoid to have >collision with other 
composition items, etc.

The problem is if the client provided text does not fit into the 
predefined label box. It would be good to combine dynamic resize 
capabilities with line breaks somehow.
I'm open for suggestions.

I agree, but it is better than "now", and quite logical to me : if the
content does not fit, only the part which fits is visible. This allows the
output PDF to be like the author wanted to, with the position and size of
each text box as set in the Composer. And above all, text wraps correctly
without dynamic resize. We could try to add an option "max length" for the
text boxes which could be advertised in the getCapabilities ? This way the
client could warn the user whenever he tries to use a text which too many
characters ?

I think dynamic resize should be used only if we can use it with line
breaks.Better respect the position and size defined by the user in QGIS
composer than having a text item which get so long that it get out of the
composer limits.

Thanks, and please forgive my english which sometimes prevents me from
souding moderate enough. I know that giving ideas is easy and developping
features is harder !

Some suggestions (I am thinking out loud...)

* new option with max text length, advertised in the getCapabilities
* linked text boxes. In softwares like Adobe Illustrator, or Scribus
(open-source), you can link serveral text boxes, so that the text is
written is the first box then in the linked one if the content does not fit
the first one.
* If "linked" text boxes is implemented, the killer feature would have to
dynamically generate new pages with linked text boxes so that all the
content is written in as many boxes as necessary to have the full content
written down.

Sincerely
Michael

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Grass algorithms doesnt appear in the sextante
	toolbar
Message-ID: <1369752207173-5056443.post@n6.nabble.com>

I had some problems with some algorithms in the 1.8 version of QGIS, so I
decided to install the 1.9 master version of QGIS. It seems to work fine but
when I activated the sextante toolbox the Grass, Taudem and even the QGIS
algorithms doesnt appear on it nor in the list nor in the browser.

I have tried activating and deactivating them in the toolbar configuration
but nothing happens and the algorithms still missing. I have reinstalled the
plugin through the QGIS plugins fetcher and manually, the result the same.

Could anyone help me with this issue, I need the tools for my classes.

Regards, 

Marlon.

Fair point, but that's why I also compared other GIS's where I could
(ArcGIS, MapModeller (FME Data Inspector uses the refresh circle but
doesn't have a back/forward feature) and noted that they hold the same
convention.
Also, that was only one single example, there are others.
These days people *expect* certain icons for certain things. To use a
different icon throws away the years of pre-training the user will have
already have using other applications that stuck to the convention.

I don't think I've ever seen a single application that had 10 icons that
were mostly the same before in the same that the magnifying glass ones in
QGIS 2.0 are.

Regards,
Jonathan

Hi,

please no :)
It would be a huge blow to QGIS reputation as there are actually
blockers that make QGIS really unusable for any real life job.

I agree with Giovanni. As an end user I'd rather wait a few more months
than get an imcomplete version of QGIS 2.0.

Just to reinforce the point raised
The pan icon currently in Master are four arrows which are more associated with moving a graphic or a nudge, I would think the most well known symbol for that would be the famous little hand to pan

In depth example: take the Back, Next, and Refresh view icons. The new QGIS icons all have a magnifying glass behind them (I can barely make out the "refresh" circle). Why? In comparison, I have four web-browsers in front of me, all have these buttons and all of them are simple arrows/refresh circles. None of them have a picture of a web-page behind them.

No reason to dish out a QGIS version just to comply with deadline, IMHO its better to delay it a bit than to deal with lots of unsatisfied users from bugs and crashes

Something similar happened to me last week, just after I updated my version
of sip (manually compiled). Guessing here, but it seems that a change in
sip version does not trigger any rebuilds of already-built QGIS Python
modules during subsequent compiling of source code.

However, your error seems to be the reverse of that, almost like an older
sip version is still installed somewhere on your machine, then found during
runtime, while the built software referenced the newer version. This may be
because during compilation, your environment is referencing a different
version of Python (i.e. newer site-packages/sip.so) or a virtual env, than
the one used during runtime of the app, which has an older sip.so installed.

I 'fixed' my sip compile error by deleting my build directory's contents
and doing a fresh CMake configure and build.

Regards,

Larry

I just noticed you mentioned 'Packages from debian-nightly, sid,' which I
assume means for QGIS. If the sip.so module is not part of those packages
(I would suspect not), maybe just upgrading your local sip install will fix
the issue.

Hi Larry,
thanks for your reply. My situation is a bit different:
* I have only Debian testing and unstable boxes, clean and up to date
*  python-sip 4.13.3-2
* I installed qgis from jef nightly repo
So I recompiled (dpkg-buildpackage) it myself, but now I get:

qgis.bin: /build/buildd-sip4_4.13.3-2-amd64-4XEr_m/sip4-4.13.3/siplib/siplib.c:6400:
sip_api_can_convert_to_enum: asserzione "(((td)->td_flags & 0x0007) == 0x0003)" non
riuscita.

Obviously there must be a problem with sip somewhere.
All the best.

1) Do not reinstall. That will install 1.0.9. The version shipped with
qgis-dev is the most recent. Please, remove the "sextante" folder from
.qgis2/python/plugins to make sure you remove the 1.0.9 version

2) Have you switched to the advanced mode, or are you in the simplified mode?

3) Please, refer to the corresponding SEXTANTE chapter in the QGIS
manual [1] to know more about how this works

Cheers!

Hi again

I reply here because I have just noticed a very cool new feature in QGIS
composer. You can add an HTML box, give a file stored in the disk
containing the HTML code to display in the box. I knew this option. What I
did not notice was the ability to let QGIS create as many pages as
necessary to dispplay the full content of the HTML file related to the box.

So instead of passing long parameter to getPrint text boxes to dynamically
replace the content (html rendered or not), I could use this feature
instead. What is missing for me right now to achieve this goal :
* be able to pass the HTML file path via a parameter. We could use the id
of the HTML item in the composer.
* be able to make it work in getPrint : I managed to create a PDF from QGIS
with the HTML content from a file, but could not via QGIS Server: the HTML
block stays empty. This is not because of X server, because I can use HTML
text for text blocks via the "fake" X server.

Any comment appreciated.

Good evening
Michael

Subject: [Qgis-developer] External calls to SEXTANTE?
Message-ID: <CADcOYKs8Xdz9ZAQvksHHADoXdLp-2bgirvrjbi2f-D9G+VorjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to make external calls to SEXTANTE with a Python script
or via the command line. I'm interested in using all the
geoalgorithms, but in particular I am interested in the GRASS
geoalgorithms, and specifically in r.viewshed at this moment. Is this
possible?

I found this post which seems very close to answering the question:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/28701/how-to-run-sextante-algorithms-outside-of-qgis-python-console/60725#60725

However when I try calling sextante.runalg I get an error seemingly
related the fact that the code is not being run inside the QGIS Python
console (qgis.utils.iface is None).

Our FOSS software (naturalcapitalproject.org) is developed on Linux
but packaged for Windows. Any suggestions or advice? We are hoping to
reduce our development time and eliminate duplicated efforts.

Thank you,
Martin

Thanks, Victor.

I was really confused, and I made the hard stuff I mean the reinstallation,
the registry cleaning, etc, and I totally forgot to check the advanced
mode......

Hi, Im really new in this community and I think its great!!

I?m trying to use the TauDEM extension in the Sextante plugin in my QGIS
master version 1.9, but when I run the module "Pit remove" I got the
message: "Oooops! SEXTANTE could not open the following output layers: Pit
Removed Elevation Grid:
C:\Users\HIDROT~1\AppData\Local\Temp\sextante\taudempitremovea9b8c8b800f74ac8843709f1aab51c18.tif"

I checked the folder and its empty, and in the log file there is just the
following:


Algorithm Pit Remove started.
Converting Outputs.
Loading result layers.

I thought it was a data problem but i have tried with some DEM obtaining the
same result.

There is any incompatibility problem with this plugin (W7, 64 bits)? 

Thanks for you very appreciated help in advance.

Did you install and configure TauDEM? Unlike SAGA or GRASS, it is not

I've made improvements today to the QgsDataDefinedButton, along the lines
of your suggestions, in commit dd60a34 [0].

Commit message:
Update QgsDataDefinedButton
- Add 'Usage info' functions; displays in description and tool tip
- Reorganize menu, adding conceptual section titles
- Add ability to paste in expression
- Add ability to clear defined expression
- Add check for non-matching data field types
- Add better truncation of expressions in tool tip and menu

Of note, I added the ability to set custom 'Usage info' for each button,
which allowed me to remove the general text "( Define attribute fields to
enable labeling map tools )" from below, and include more descriptive,
contextual information in the tool tip and description popup:

Usage:
In edit mode, layer's relevant labeling map tool is:
  Defined attribute field -> enabled
  Defined expression -> disabled

I would appreciate any further feedback on the button's new menu layout. I
consider the button's functionality to be ready for release, but there is
always room for improvement.  :^)

We used to have a hand icon:

Wonder if it still exists somewhere. But I admit, it wasn't too good :)

Hi!

Well I think in different places in the world different icons would be
"usual" ..
It's just about what you are "used" to have ..

Beside the really hard fact that the icons are not too colourful I think
this discussion would last forever ..
With a lot of personal different meanings ..

To speak for my own person .. I am also not satisfied with ALL the icons I
see, but Robert is doing an amazing job and spend a lot of time in creating
this icons .. And I am glad that this iconset is under active development
..
So, as long as I cannot make it better (and provide it) I am just happy
with what is there ..
Thanks to the Creator and active Maintainer of the GIS Iconset .. May it be
used in every OpenSource GIS Software so that we can have a common face to
the outside

kind regards
Werner

	files with sublayers
Message-ID: <CA+TxYvN0ukKuyskk=+brCiahjz8cA0+8G2uw=faL+ESEWm0rxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have just pushed a commit to fix the loading of raster and vector files
with sublayers. I have also added 2 files to test this in the testdata
folder.

This may cause some bug(s) that I have not tested for, especially regarding
non-file based data sources.

cheers

And over 100 blockers in the current queue...I don't want to make a
buggy release either but I also don't want to put master in perpetual
feature freeze while we wait for perfection to make itself apparent.

For me there is mainly one thing (feature) is missing for QGIS 2.0: The 
upgrade to the new PyQt API (aka. SIP API V2) I would really not want 
to see a QGIS 2.0 without this update. I really hope, that this is 
going to be taken care of by someone.
We could also look for sponsors to make this more attractive. I 
remember Martin announced once, that he'll be looking into this again, 
but I don't know if this is still valid.

Apart from this, I agree, that releasing QGIS with blockers is not a 
good idea, but also remember, that not every bug which is tagged as a 
blocker necessarily really is a blocker so we might decide to downgrade 
some.

ALL the blockers should make QGIS really unusuable, otherwise IMHO
they shouldn't be blockers. Many of the items in the blocker list are
indeed irritations but I think the blocker list needs to be
aggressively pruned of items that aren't actually causing crashes /
data corruption or serious inability to use QGIS.

As I said to Sandro, and as we discuss with each release, we will need
to make compromises - including considering making a release with a
known issues list where there are items that we have no strategy in
place to deal with them.

If there is a candidate for doing the work I would be happy to delay
the release for this. In the absence of a volunteer (or sponsor dev)
to do this, I don't think we should discuss if we can reasonably delay
the release for this.

Right that is essentially the same as releasing with blockers since we
are just reclassifying items in the blocker queue to be non-blockers
:-) But seriously yes I agree many items in the queue should not be
classified as blockers IMHO.

Hi,

To me - if a feature worked in QGIS 1.8 but fails in 2.0 - esp. if we
paid for its development in QGIS 1.8 - then it is also a blocker.

How could I otherwise justify our expenses in QGIS to my boss? Well you
know - we paid for this feature to be developed - but maybe with the
next version it is broken again ...

Hi, you are working on InVest right? If so, have you considered making
InVest "inside" Sextante Toolbox? In CC I'm copying Victor Olaya, who is
the main developer of Sextante so he can help with that.

As a QGIS user it's very exciting for me to know that you are working on
bringing Invest into QGIS.

as we agreed in Lyon, a blocker is a regression or a new feature that
does not work as expected, this is the way I tried to maintain the
tracker.

I would agree to eventually downgrade a few about new features that
are not perfect, I do not agree to downgrade any regression.

Cheers!

Once we have the last two features (new plugin manager and SIP v2 -
latter being a little bit in question still for me) in the code base
we can embark on a campaign to get the blockers (as curated by
Giovanni) closed.  However strategically we also need to accommodate
the possibility that no fixes may be forthcoming for certain issues,
and decide on some e.g. time limit or other criteria for which a
blocker can remain in the queue before it should be downgraded.

Giovanni could you do a triage of the blocker issue queue - it seems
like some could be removed (e.g. http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7619
could be closed?).

I just want to clarify that my position is not that I *want* to make a
release with blockers, but I also want to avoid that we indefinitely
delay the release without a decent plan of action in place of how to
deal with the blockers.

Regards

Tim

Definitely that sounds interesting, and I guess that SEXTANTE is a
right choice for reimplementing your ideas.

about calling algorithms from python, if you are mainly going to use
GRASS ones, you can probably do it without SEXTANTE, but using
SEXTANTE will allow you to get more functionality.

I would suggest you to start by writing a simple SEXTANTE algorithm
that calls the algorithms needed for you model. I could help you on
that, and then we can see how to maybe take it out of the "normal"
QGIS/SEXTANTE framework to allow it to be executed without the full
QGIS GUI (I uderstand that is what you are looking for)

feel free to contact me if you need more help

Hi,

This problem persists. I've done tests on two machines and I know that is also happening to other people.

I'm using Xubuntu 12.04.

Anyone else confirm? Should I fill out a ticket?

Thanks!
Pedro

yes I can, but (full time) not until later *next* week as I'm Cape
Verde to give an extensive QGIS training course.

You're right, there is a bug. I'll fix it next week.

As a first step, could we all individually go to the hub and review our
blockers to possibly remove some blockers that are not crucial to a 2.0
release or dups of previous reports? That would facilitate Giovanni's job.

Also, while ideally a product should be shipped regression-free, this needs
to be balanced with a practical need to actually release a product in a
timely fashion too. People are - at least in Southeast Asia - expecting a
major update of QGIS by mid 2013, and IMO that expectation should be
matched as closely as humanly possible.

Balancing things out would mean let's not ship QGIS with 100 open blockers,
but let's not wait six more months until we reach an elusive 0 blockers :)

Alex,

Seems like a bug.  I just ran into it trying to fix
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7781

Martin do you have any idea what might be going on?

Hi

I agree the release needs to be delayed, but not indefinitely.
My impression until now was that the feature freeze was interpreted in a 
very broad sense. Maybe we could have another period with only bug fixes 
(so no api improvements or new features coming as usability fixes).

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

as Victor already said, you need to install and configure TauDEM by
yourself. Please note,
that currently TauDEM provider supports only version 5.0.6 of TauDEM.

If you have TauDEM installed, but plugin don't work, try to execute
same command directly
in console and look if it works.

Hi Alexander!

TauDEM is a nice thing to work with ..
Could there be somewhat like a "check" made that checks for the existence
in "usual" places and if TauDEM is not found pop up pa warning with "You
have to install TauDEM by yourself in order to get TauDEM running"?
That would be really nice .. because a lot of people think that every
plugin in QGIS has the whole functionality inside the plugin and does not
need external tools..

Anyway .. Thanks a lot for creating TauDEM plugin!
kind regards
Werner

Hi!

+1 For Marco and Tim

Means: two last features should go into the Release :
1. Plugin Manager (already waiting to be merged)
2. SIPv2 (status unknown but would definitely easen the life for the next
years if it would be in 2.0)

And we should really go into deep feature freeze right now (except the 2
things above) and extend for another 3 Weeks to fix the blockers.
Not to forget that I should give the translators at least one week to catch
up with translations after string freeze..

Also I would like to relegate translations with less than 30% from the 2.0
Release because I think with less than 30% it would not make any sense to
include the translations ..
That would currently mean ~ -10 languages.

kind regards
Werner

Werner

Other SEXTANTE providers have that check, not just checking usual
places, but in some cases even running a tiny sample algorithm and
check it returns a result.

I will add a similar one to the TauDEM provider

Thanks for the suggestion

Message-ID: <CAPkCcEaDrXM2dNE0wtAyn63s55CSvzJ1beWRm7pMQto3uib-1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm testing Oracle connection, and I can't select a layer to add it to my
QGIS project.

The window 'Add oracle Layer' prompts an alert 'Select a layer' when I
click on Add after clicking on a layer.
When I click on a layer, the line doesn't give me information about
selection: background blue.

Someone has also the same bug ?
Someone has an idea about correcting it ?

Ren?-Luc D'Hont

PS, I'm working on QGIS from SOGEO4W

Download failed.

Might be good to check the projection and give a more useful message if
it's not geographic (or translate coordinates before download).

Hi,

When registering for FOSS4G in Nottingham (Early Bird closes 31st May), I 
noticed that the conference starts at Thursday Sept. 19th with 2 workshop days 
before (http://2013.foss4g.org/dates/)
The Hackfest in Brighton is planned from Sept. 13th-16th. To shorten the gap 
for many of the FOSS4G attendands, wouldn't it be possible to move two 
Hackfest days to the FOSS4G hackathon which is scheduled for 
Tuesday/Wednesday?

Hi Pirmin,

Do you suggest to move the QGIS HF to Nottingham for those 2 dates or just
shift the dates so that QGIS HF will coincide with hackathon in Nottingham?
When we did the initial planning no programme was ready for FOSS4G.

Cheers
Saber

That's why "maintainance releases" are important.
We're only 1 blocker away from a 1.7.5, and 10 blockers away from 1.8.1.

Hi list

How could I extract the current project's CRS from python?

I've tried looking for it in QSettings but came up short. Mybe somewhere in
QgsProject? I can't figure out how to use the readListEntry() method though.

Thanks

I suggest to use the FOSS4G infrastructure for the 2 days. An additional 
advantage would be the possibility to attend a workshop and the contact to 
other OSGeo projects. I saw at least one UMN Mapserver contributor in the 
hackathon attendance list.

Let me talk to FOSS4G organiser to see if we can use their facilities for
those 2 days. Also, I need to shuffle the dates with Sussex University.
There might be a problem as it will be the start of the term and the uni
will be very busy.
How about:
 - Starting on 13 Sept (Friday afternoon) in Brighton - 
 - Moving to Nottingham on 16 Sept: so that people who are not attending
FOSS4G will be around for at least 2 full days.
 - 17 and 18 Sept continuation of the HF  in Nottingham

If it is sensible to you folks, I can start re-arranging the plan?

Cheers
Saber

Hi Pirmin,

if I understand correctly, Tuesday 17 and Wednesday 18 are the hackdays 
of foss4g which normally were done after the conference. But now 
combined with the workshops which normally preceded the conference.
My experience is that most core developers of the different foss4g 
projects show up on these days (and other interested shove by).

QGIS hackfest was/is planned from 12 - 16

Isn't this perfectly planned? We first hack for 4 day full steam on 
QGIS, and then optionally 2 extra days with some extra new people (OR 
you can choose to attend another hackbof (I'm very interested in 
OpenLayers and MapProxy for example).

And we have to travel from Brighton to Nottingham also (which I think 
takes maybe a small day??).

In your next mail you suggest to use FOSS4G infrastructure for 2 days, 
but I think we already have this option?? And breaking 2 days OF from 
the normal 2-4 days of a hackfest does not leave very much time in 
brighton (if we have to travel anyway).

Off course, the organizers decide what they feel best.

Regards,

Richard

Hi

canvas = self.iface.mapCanvas()
mapRenderer = canvas.mapRenderer()
srs=mapRenderer.destinationCrs()

Then for example
str(srs.authid())
would return for a project in WGS84:
?EPSG:4326?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] mapCanvas refresh does not show newly created
 features in memory layers
Message-ID: <51A60477.1050202@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have filled a bug some time ago[0], which I find weird.

In a plugin:
1. I create a memory layer
2. I add a feature in it
3. mapCanvas.refresh() does not make the feature visible but 
mapCanvas.zoomIn/Out() does.

This is truly weird, anyone has an idea what to look for?

Thanks,

Denis

 I think there may be some confusion between the FOSS4G Hackathon and
the Code Sprints...

 The Hackathon ("Hack Days") is a thing sponsored by The Met Office
where a bunch of random geeks get together to work on developing
solutions to problems, guided mainly by Met Office ideas.  The plan is
to be similar to the NHS Hack Day (where geeks work on projects for
health data and clinical procedure) or other "Random Hacks of
Kindness" (RHOK) projects.

The Code Sprint is intended to be a free space for open-source project
devs and interested parties to get together and work on their
projects. FOSS4G supplies the room and the electricity and phone
numbers of local pizza places. We should be able to provide code
sprint facilities during the main conference as well as the special
code sprint day on the Sunday.

 Now, I'm not saying QGIS couldn't run a code sprint during the
hackathon days (personally I think its a great idea, would have to run
it past the committee and make sure there's space) but that's not what
the hackathon is.

http://2013.foss4g.org/programme/hackathon/
http://2013.foss4g.org/programme/code-sprint/

 Hope that's all clear!

Personally I would prefer to have the QGIS hackfest independent from
the FOSS4G - I think it will be a distraction on various levels to be
at FOSS4G - QGIS developers will get lured away to other groups and
random people will wander in and distract QGIS hackers from their
geekery. If the hack days coincide with workshop days it would be
doubly bad as those wanting to attend workshops would do so at the
detriment to their QGIS hack time.

I appreciate that there would also be some advantages to Pirmin's
suggestion - encouraging interoperability with other projects and so
on, but that could also be facilitated at BOF sessions in the FOSS4G
conference.

Regards

Tim

I totally agree. We've been pushing many new features and changing API is a
great step. 
2.x branch will be the start for complete switch from arcgis or Mapinfo in
some administrations here. We will then need maintenance releases and
relative stability. A release every 6 months is fairly enough to me, I have
no time to publish more often. 

Are we able to plan what will justify 3.0? (multithread / data frames -
arcgis like? )

Hi all.
What is a blocker? something that prevents users from upgrading to the newer version.
IMO we want to get rid of previous versions as soon as possible, when a new one is
released. To do so, we must assure users that they can keep on with their work with
the latest version, without a need of switching back to the previous one. That's why
we adopted the current classification for blockers. And please remember: we are not
talking about *perfection* here, as we still have >1k bugs.
On the other hand, I think now it's the time for power users to seriously contribute
to the solution of their most annoying bugs. The best option is of course hiring a
bunch of developers for this.
Please also note that in recent times qgis-dev is seriously broken, so very few
people are using it regularly (we normally run many courses, all on qgis-dev, but had
to switch back since the beginning of the year). Therefore, probably we had less
testing than usual. I suggest to put out a beta release after feature freeze for
wider testing, possibly followed by the usual RC sequence.
I think we have > 1M users now, better be more careful than usual not to disrupt
their workflow.
All the best.

Alexander:

I realized that tauDEM is not included in the sextante toolbox, I think it
could be a common mistake between new QGIS users like me.

I have installed the tauDEM as showed in several pages (including the MPICH2
service, and the TauDEM 5.0.6 routines, and I have directioned in the
sextante configuration options).

As you recommend I tried to run the algorithm from the python console, but
there is no result, I mean, the process seems to start and my QGIS start
processing but never ends ( I have waited for more than 4 hours) with a
small raster and the pit remove algorithm.

There is any other consideration Im omitting?

Thanks and apologies for my simple questions.

Could you report the error or warning messages you get in SEXTANTE history
and log?
Also, does  pit remove command work under normal shell/command prompt?


Cheers

Saber:

There are not  error or warning messages in the SEXTANTE log.

Just the run.alg instruction and then seems to be processing but nothing
happens, after a while the QGIS closes.

(sextante.runalg("taudem:pitremove","C:/Users/HIDROTOAPI03/Desktop/TempMC/TauDEM/Logan/logan.tif","C:/Users/HIDROTOAPI03/Desktop/TempMC/TauDEM/logfill.tif")

If I execute the command from the SEXTANTE toolbar and from the python
console, the result is the same.

Regards.

The feature freeze was already postponed for 2 months. We cannot
extend it forever, especially waiting for new features not yet
implemented and nobody is working on.

I agree, another 3 weeks to fix blockers and release by the end of
June. The next possible release date IMO is the end of September (2
months of holidays + one month to consolidate again).

We have currently 85 blockers, about 10 active developers and about 20
days, that means:
85/10/20=0.4 blocker per developer per day. It should be possible to
fix one bug in 2 days. Don't forget to set 'assigned to' when you
start to work on a blocker.

Agreed. If at all possible, we should do it before the end of June.

Moreover, a thorough screening of tickets may reveal sveral misclassified or
duplicate bugs. I did some cleaning just now, more work is needed. I encourage all
bug reporters to check the status of their bugs.

This is why we (in a public organization) are still using 1.7.4, due to a
stupid blocker (the famous postgres duplicate primary key bug with split
tool) present in 1.8.0 (but not in 1.7.4).

The fix was ready month and month ago, but it was only for 2.0 and we never
will see a 1.8.0 release.

Alexander.

Thanks for your advice.

I have tried to run TauDEM from the cmd, and I discovered a lot of missing
things....

It seems that TauDEM didnt run because the MPICH2 was wrong installed (I
mean i consider a little difficult to install without mistakes at the first
time), I reinstalled everything and now the routines in the sextante are
running normally, I will perform some tests to check if it is true.

Regards.

Luca, what about taking the responsibility to maintain a stable branch ?
I'd also love to see a 1.8.1 coming out :)

Hi Devs,

most qgis-related blogs I see are running wordpress (I think).

I just put www.qgis.nl to a new server, and looked at the acces logs.

It is horrifying (see http://www.duif.net/wp.png ). Every second 
(probably) scripts try to login via the wp_admin page.... See the 
screendump, all different IP adresses, more then every second...

Am I the only one with this problem?

Someone a solution for this?

No - my site was hacked a couple of times already :-( I've been
planning to move to a static content management system but just never
get the time to do so....

Limit the IP range allowed to access the wp_admin page, change the url 
of your wp_admin page, get a free cloudflare account... There are lots 
of options but this is all way off-topic and better for some wordpress 
security forums.

Thanks,

It is not a bad idea. I'm pretty sure that if  QGIS 2.0 will be out soon,
it never will be used in production, due to critical bugs (we will wait at
least for 2.0.1 or 2.0.2).

The only problem is that we use Windows at work and compiling all things is
pain, OSGEO4W doesn't release debug libraries ...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding a feature to a layer with joined fields
Message-ID: <51A6ED6C.6070508@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Regarding blocker #7072, I wonder if it really makes sense to have 
joined fields than can be filled by the user in the edit form while 
creating a feature. These fields should not be edited at all.
I would suggest not to show them at creation and to disable the joined 
fields while editing.

What do you think?

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SIP API Update
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg_GbEAsGHWb-Jp8ywT5H_v+cjht1y+UNXF5Lt7=FEpQwA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I have decided to manage the SIP API update process so that we can have it
done by 2.0.  This is an important update as leaving it for later will
break every plugin yet again at later date which just leaves a really bad
taste for people to deal with. A few plugin authors have already expressed
that they would not be impressed having to do another major update again in
the future. And I agree.

So having said that this is the current plan:

- I have created a branch with the SIP API v2 update
 - Update all the core plugins in the sipapi-udate[0] branch over the next
couple of days
-  Merge into master

I couldn't update all the core plugins myself BUT it would be a lot easier
if I could call on the plugin authors to run though their own code and do
the quick update.  The risk of me doing it is that I might break something
and not know it.  You know your code best so the help would be greatly
appreciated.

I updated most of the console code and Salvatore has already cleaned the
rest up for me so that is one thing out of the way.

And here comes the kicker: I would like to do this as quickly as we can so
to reduce the gap between master and the branch.  The sooner we merge it to
master the sooner we can open it to wider testing, but I don't expect to
run into any major issues when we do.

If you are not aware of what benefits the SIP API update will bring here is
a quick example:

Before:

>>> str(yourlineedit.text().toString())
'Hello World'
>>> feature["column"].toInt()[0]
100

After

>>> yourlineedit.text()
'Hello World'
>>> feature["column"]
1000

It will make life for us and plugin authors a hell of a lot easier.

I have put together a quick guide[1] with some examples.  It is open edit
so feel free to add any notes you have. It might be good to turn it into a
plugin translate guide for future plugin authors moving to 2.0.

Regards,
Nathan

Thank you Nathan, Great to see somebody tackle this task.

I sent a preliminary patch for gdaltools to the list a couple of days 
ago.
I don't know if it helps and it sure is buggy, but whoever is going to 
upgrade this plugin could have a look.
It's attached again here for convenience.

I think it's right. In 1.8, joined fields are editable. Input values
are displayed in the attribute table, but their values are not saved
when I save the layer as a new file.
My patch[1] does not hide joined fields in new feature form, but it
makes joined fields uneditable. As soon as we create a new feature on
join layer, fields in the joined table are bind to the new feature

Hi Minoru,

Then I can't wait for your patches to be integrated!
Is there any reason why it's not accepted yet???

Also, it would be really nice to see joined fields automatically updated 
while changing the target field...

Cheers,

Denis

As said, I think backporting fixes should really be important for the future of the
project, and power users should seriously consider hiring a developer to maintain this.

Plugin authors want to maintain support for multiple qgis versions,
so changing an API is really only _more_ work, not _less_.

Is there any facility to deal with that ?

The new plugin manager can handle different versions of the same plugin.
With the new vector API this is already the case so changing SIP isn't
going to hurt much more.

Does the old way of doing it stop working? What I'm a bit  worried about is
that the result is 100 before and 1000 after, but I guess that's a typo?

It seems the code will be cleaner and more concise, that's certainly a good
thing.

There is this link from Marco Bernasocchi:

http://spyder-ide.blogspot.ch/2011/06/pyqt-api-1-pyqt-api-2-and-pyside.html

This abstraction layer along with another one for the vector layer API 
changes would make a nice little help for developers targetting 
multiple versions.

The old way e.g toInt()[0] will not work anymore hence why we have to
update everything.  The 1000 is a typo.

Personally I would prefer to have the QGIS hackfest independent from the
FOSS4G - I think it will be a distraction on various levels to be at FOSS4G
- QGIS developers will get lured away to other groups and random people will
wander in and distract QGIS hackers from their geekery. If the hack days
coincide with workshop days it would be doubly bad as those wanting to
attend workshops would do so at the detriment to their QGIS hack time.

I appreciate that there would also be some advantages to Pirmin's suggestion
- encouraging interoperability with other projects and so on, but that could
also be facilitated at BOF sessions in the FOSS4G conference.

Regards

Tim

Is there anyone for qgis to detect such missing dependency
and report it to the user at runtime ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] First time compilation
Message-ID: <CAJ33Qva+Q+1oF0TS=UfpC7Rdee6zf+Ouk7aO-QsN7VS83Lp6dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all
I'm about to start using QGIS for some projects of my organization, but I'm
facing some problems (maybe they're not a problem at all)

I've set up the QGIS development platform.
I've downloaded and installed QGIS Lisboa apart. (not from OSGeo4W)
I've followed the "qgis-1.6.0_coding-compilation_guide" (line by line) and
I've been able to configure and generate the qgis source code to be
compiled.
I'm using cmake 2.8, and Visual Studio 2010 express edition
I could sucessfully compile the qgis source code.

But right now I want to compile the files in the code examples, and every
time I click configure on cmake, I receive the error:

CMake Error at cmake_find_rules/FindQGIS.cmake:135 (MESSAGE):

Could not find QGIS

Call Stack (most recent call first):

CMakeLists.txt:6 (FIND_PACKAGE)


I've tried change the paths in the file FindQGIS.cmake, but with resulting
in failure.

This may be a dumb question, but I'm stuck on it for two days.


Thanks in advance for anyhelp.

I've attached the FindQGIS.cmake file

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SIP API Update
Message-ID: <6968362923142290004@unknownmsgid>

Hey all,

There is currently a issue in the new sip branch with calling
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers() making QGIS crash. I know
where the issue is and will try to fix it ASAP.

If anyone knows sip and can lend a hand that would be great. The crash
is in conversions.sip QMap<TYPE, TYPE*>.

There is this link from Marco Bernasocchi:

http://spyder-ide.blogspot.ch/2011/06/pyqt-api-1-pyqt-api-2-and-pyside.html

This abstraction layer along with another one for the vector layer API
changes would make a nice little help for developers targetting
multiple versions.

Message-ID: <CAFcNcQZ=RkeDV8osQweo7gARV-ngT85rPgzwPHw7qGiUeCbQcg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

I created a new plugin in hub.qgis.org and I'd like to use a git
repository. I've done this in the past and had no problems but now I am
having dificulties pushing the initial commit to gitosis.qgis.org

In redmine I created the repository and added my SSH key. Then I
initialized my git repo locally and added the remote repo using the URL
that redmine gave me. I did my first commit and now I want to push it to
the remote repository. I keep getting an error about not having permission
when I input my password.

What could be the problem?

Must I first upload the code and ask for approval in order to get the
remote repository created?

The plugin's name is 'Conefor inputs'.

The first sign the something isn't right is if gitosis asks you for a 
password. It uses ssh keys which at most will ask you to unlock your 
local passphrase for the key in use.

Can you please list the git commands you ran.
Also what's the output of:
git remote -v

Thanks,
Alex

so plugin authors would potentially need to maintain 2 versions of their
plugins, on for qgis <= 1.8 and one for qgis >=2.0.

This is probably easier than adding a bunch of if statements where sip1 and
spi2 need different syntax I guess,

cheers

I am trying to update a plugin (tileindex) using your branch and I get the
following an error

     fileName = feature[self.attrStr]

TypeError: PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant represents a mapped type and cannot be
instantiated


It seems that feature[], as well as feature.attribute() return a QVariant
(defined in qgsfeature.sip), which is incompatible with SIP API v2.


How can this be fixed in the plugin or qgis?

Yeah they both return QVariant but that is auto converted to a Python
object by SIP.

Not sure what is going on there I'll look into it.

I get the right return result if I called feature.attribute().

Which platform are you on?

Etienne,

If self.attrStr() is something like QVariant(value) then you need to remove
the QVariant() bit call.

Etienne,

Basically QVariant no longer exits in PyQt so if you have from PyQt4.QtCore
import QVariant you can remove it, or if you have: myvalue = QVariant(10)
change it to myvalue = 10.

Hi,

Sorry to insist, but I'd like to hear your opinion on this issue.
It will be a local problem? Or should I open a ticket?

Thanks.

Best regards,
Pedro

Hi,

This problem persists. I've done tests on two machines and I know that is also happening to other people.

I'm using Xubuntu 12.04.

Anyone else confirm? Should I fill out a ticket?

Thanks!
Pedro
