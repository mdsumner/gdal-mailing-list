Hi Paolo

You don't need the admin.sld if you work with the project file as a 
configuration. 'admin.sld' is still supported for backwards compatibility (also 
because it uses the same code as parsing SLD sent by clients).

The publish to web plugin in this form is not necessary any more. In future, 
it would however be usefull to turn it into a graphical editor for the 
mapserver related properties in the project files.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco.
Thanks a lot for clarifying this.
Any plans to incorporate an updated documentation into the main QGIS manual?
Overall, I must say it's a pleasure to set up and use the server.
BTW: any plans to extend it to WFS as well, so we could replace the good old (UMN)
Mapserver?
All the best, and again many thanks.

Hi Paolo

Yes, it would be very helpful to integrate the updated docs into the manual. 
Unfortunately, at the moment, I don't have time to work on the docs, so any 
help in this respect would be greatly appreciated.

Not from my side. But it would be possible e.g. by creating a class 
QgsWFSServer (similarly to the QgsWMSServer class that is used for the WMS 
requests).
Btw., TinyOWS is also quite good as a light-weight WFS server with support for 
WFS-T.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <4C7E8E19.1000100@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Android, although not really free, is a very interesting platform for mobile. A range
on cheap and reasonably powerful tablets has been announced by various HW vendors, eg
http://www.archos.com
Is anybody interested in porting QGIS to Android? Does anybody have an idea on how
difficult this could be? What are the major issues, apart from resizing the dialogs?
Qt porting is underway: http://code.google.com/p/android-lighthouse/ but of course a
number of dependencies will have to be solved.
Any opinion?
All the best.

It depends on the aim (gps tracker, field editing, etc.) but a mobile 
gis is far from being a simple scale-down of the software, I would say 
that it would requires a complete GUI overhaul to fit with the reduced 
space screen and the limited user input. If you have the opportunity, 
give a try to Trimble TerraSync, this tool is an ergonomic masterpiece 
for small screens.

I did not have many problems using tex4ht to convert to HTML, the output
seems reasonable. The OS images are a bit too big, though (huge penguins
;-).
At least with version [tex4ht.c (2009-01-31-07:33 kpathsea)] it is no
problem to convert it here.

Maybe a 'private' configuration would help (to split document, nicer
'buttons' etc.), according to:
http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn-commands.html#QQ1-9-41By
the way, I found some bugs (\label inside caption), patch for evis part
attached...
There remain some similar label problems, e.g. in the following there is
no number defined for the graphics (no caption), and the label will be a
double of the previously defined one (e.g. a section):
plugins_gps.tex:   \caption{\label{gpxloader}The \emph{GPS Tools} dialog
window \nixcaption}

for today I have to go, but I found some other dubious places using:
grep '{\\label{' *.tex

I was trying with hevea with much less success, could you upload your

Hi Paolo,
I would personally wait a few months to see how much sucess the Meego platform 
(http://meego.com/) has. It is a very promising choice for "QGIS mobile", 
since it includes QT as the standard GUI library. It's supports Atom based 
netbooks and the first tablets are coming...
Regards
Pirmin

P.S: As an Android owner I would naturally support a QGIS port ;-)

Dual booting Android arm / x86  tablet / netbook with Ubuntu
Maverick-Meerkat is a good option. Ubuntu has arm port.

Right now, you can buy x86 Tablet with Window XP or Windows 7 and dual
boot with ubuntu and use QGIS as is. uTouch has driver for Sintek touch screen

Ubuntu arm and Ubuntu -Maverick-Meerkat
http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Canonical-uTouch-and-Ubuntu-Maverick-Meerkat/

I think GQIS needs a UI makeover for Meego and Ubuntu.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bringing the raster processing algorithms of the
 Orfeo Toolbox Monteverdi in QGIS
Message-ID: <4C7F7176.5080801@cnes.fr>

Hi all,

I am a member of the Orfeo Toolbox Team ( http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/ 
) and since last year some developments have been made to try to bring 
some OTB functionalities inside Quantum GIS.

Some OTB plugins (C++) have been develop and there are also developments 
around the integration of  the Monteverdi application as a Qgis plugin. 
Monteverdi is an integrated application allowing to create a complete 
processing (ortho-rectification, segmentation, classification, etc.). It 
allows building processing chains by selecting modules from a set of 
menus. It supports raster and vector data and it is based on  already 
existing OTB filters. Also the architecture takes advantage of the 
streaming and multi-threading capabilities of the OTB pipeline ( 
http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/monteverdi.html. )

The current OTB-QGIS plugins (as of August 2010) rely on writing the 
data on the disk after processing before reopening it to be available in 
QGIS. The goal is to provide now directly the result of the processing 
without going thought disk writing.

The proposed architecture is to develop an otbprovider in QGIS modeled 
after the WMSProvider to be able  to add a streamed otb raster layer in 
the Qgis viewer. That's the difficult part...Our provider do not work 
for now but I think that we're not too far from a solution!
(Technically, there is perhap's the need to define a specific method 
AddRasterLayer for otb layers inside the QgisInterface class...But we 
need to discuss first with members of the qgis team who will have a more 
complete vision of the internal Qgis architecture of data providers...)

By the way, we'll present the Orfeo Toolbox and the latest developments 
around the library at FOSS4G2010 in Barcelona next week: 
http://2010.foss4g.org/presentations_show.php?id=3655

We will be glad to discuss with QGIS developers about these topics 
during the conference!

The source code of this project, based on the Orfeo Toolbox can be found 
here : http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-Qgis-plugins/
Informations and current state of developments can also be found on our 
wiki : http://wiki.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php/Quantum_GIS_plugins

Manuel

+1 for Meego. It seems to be the more natural target, since Nokia is
owning qt and it will probably well supported. Also, the platform is more
open than Android.

I am not against Android, but I would have to choose in which platform to
invest (time or money) for QGIS mobile, I would prefer Meego.

Hi,

Have a look at geomajas site. Probably Qgis can have similar format as well.

Hi Paolo,

During the last few days, we have been discussing about html
documentation for QGIS manual and plugins. And I thought that this
site, Geomajas has a good documentation especially there plugins. I
don' t want to be verbose. Just visit the site. The site rating for
their plugins, link to forum and probably a bugs reporting as well.

The stars for each fulfilled requirement are great - it should encourage

Hi Manuel

Wow, OTB looks like a very powerfull set of tools and it will certainly be a 
great addition to have a plugin for them in QGIS.

It is possible to add other raster providers besides the WMS one (see e.g. the 
grass raster provider in src/providers/grass/qgsgrassrasterprovider). 
There is however only drawing support available, e.g. it is not possible to 
access the raster values itself through the raster provider interface (but you 
probably don't need that anyway). The raster system would need some redisign 
for a real generic raster provider support.
PluginLayer (as mentioned by Pirmin) would be another possibility. But then 
you cannot use the desktop tools working on raster layer on them (e.g. raster 
properties dialog, raster symbolisation, raster stat).

Looking forward to meet you at the FOSS4G conference.

Regards,
Marco

Quite interesting, but I do not think it is suitable for production.
So it may not be appropriate to add it to trunk.
I think it would be better to use libredwg directly, rather than passing through
GRASS. The GRASS addon itself seems fairly simple, so it should not be too difficult
to rewrite it for QGIS.
All the best.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=tWgv5AwihRYJ=+mLF=NjYuZpkDxGpbzUtmAUY@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

I'm trying to toggle my plugin's availability based on the presence or
absence of loaded vector layers of type 'line'.
For this purpose I have a _get_loaded_layers() and a
toggle_availability() methods (code follows in the end of this
message).

After searching the online API docs, it seems that the
QgsMapLayerRegistry class is the one that notifies the rest of the
application about layers being added or removed.
So I connect my plugin's toggle_availability() method to the
layerWasAdded() and layerWillBeRemoved() signals of the
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance() object.

When the user adds a new layer everything goes fine, my plugin's
availability is toggled based on the presence of vector lines,
including the new layer that was added.
Also, if the user removes just one layer at a time, everything works
as expected as well.

Unfortunately, when several layers are removed at the same time (for
example, if the user had an open project and decides to create a new
one), my plugin is causing Qgis to segfault (very ugly!).

It seems to be connected to what is happening with the
QgsmapLayerRegistry instance when the layerWillBeRemoved() signal is
emmited repeatedly. It seems to me that I am crashing Qgis because I
am trying to call QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers() while the
layers are being deleted... and that causes the segfault.
I don't know what happens to the mapLayerRegistry instance, but its
mapLayers() method seems to be the source of the error.

Reading the pyQgis cookbook, I realized that when layers are removed
from the mapLayerRegistry they are also deleted from Qgis, which seems
a bit inconsistent, compared with the loading procedure. What I mean
is, if layers can be loaded without being automatically added to the
mapLayerRegistry, maybe they could also be removed from the
mapLayerRegistry without being deleted from Qgis (Maybe this is the
reason for having a layerWillBeRemoved() signal instead of a
layerWasRemoved()?).

Anyway, I don't understand why it works OK if layers are removed one
at a time and not if they all get removed.
I've tried to use the QgsMapLayerRegistry.removedAll() signal to catch
those situations when all layers get removed at once. It does work,
but the problem is that the QgsMapLayerRegistry.layerWillBeRemoved()
is still geting called at the same time and will crash Qgis.

So, I'd like to request your help in determining the best way to be
notified when a layer is removed from the map canvas.

Thanks

Hi Ricardo,

what if you use the legendInterface class for getting the loaded layers?

Try this (in the Python console):
-------------------------------------------------------
from PyQt4.QtCore import SIGNAL

q = qgis.utils.iface
l = q.legendInterface()
def f( layerId ):
for i in l.layers():
 print i.name(), i.geometryType()

q.connect( QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance(), SIGNAL(
"layerWillBeRemoved(QString)" ), f )
-------------------------------------------------------

I'm not sure it works if the user starts a new project...

Regards,

Germ?n

Ok, I figured this out. It was as simple as:

*
resultsLayer.setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm(QgsContrastEnhancement.StretchToMinimumMaximum)
*

That computes the min and max, and stretches the grayscale (to black and
white for boolean rasters).

In the mean time I was futzing around with:

       * band = resultsLayer.bandNumber(resultsLayer.grayBandName()) *
*        minVal = resultsLayer.minimumValue(band)*
*        maxVal = resultsLayer.maximumValue(band)*

and

      *  resultsLayer.setMinimumValue(band, minVal, generateLookupTableFlag)
*
*        resultsLayer.setMaximumValue(band, maxVal, generateLookupTableFlag)
*

but it turns out that  *resultsLayer.**setMaximumValue(band) *returns the
theoretical maximum (255) rather than the real maximum (1), which is not
what I wanted. You can get the correct value with

*        maxVal = resultsLayer.bandStatistics(band).maximumValue*

However, it says that calling bandStatistics is very CPU intensive, since it
also calculates a lot of other stuff. As it turns out, the
StretchToMinimumMaximum algorithm seems to calculate the minmax anyway, so
none of that is needed.

My big mistake, as I was rushing through this, was to confuse extent and
values, as I was trying to copy from a tutorial and wasn't paying close
attention. Once I figured that out, it was easy.

On the other hand,

*resultsLayer.setColorShadingAlgorithm("PseudoColorShader")*

Doesn't seem to do anything at all. Strange.

Cheers,
JP

Howdy JP,

Not quite sure what the question is at this stage. However, here are 
some general comments.

When the raster is first loaded, the min max values for each band are 
provided by GDAL but are estimates. You will not get the exact min max 
values until the band statistics are generated, which depending on the 
size of the image can take be slow. The raster has to be rendered at 
least once for computeMinimumMaximumFromLastExtent() to provide 
meaningful values.

Re:
"On the other hand,
resultsLayer.setColorShadingAlgorithm("PseudoColorShader")
Doesn't seem to do anything at all. Strange."

Pseudo color shading does not just use the minimum and maximum values, 
it requires you to define the number of standard deviations to apply. 
Also the pseudo color shader has to be used with the correct drawing 
style, i.e., QgsRasterLayer.SingleBandPseudoColor


-pete

Hi all.
The EPSG def for ED50 (EPSG:23032) is a standard one:
+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs
For Western Europe, the corrected datum is:
+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs +towgs84=-87,-96,-120,0,0,0,0
Any objection to add it, as we have done for 3003 etc.?
All the best.

Paolo,

I would note that the EPSG init file now (perhaps only in trunk,
not the release) has:

# ED50
<4230> +proj=longlat +ellps=intl +towgs84=-87,-98,-121,0,0,0,0 +no_defs  <>

For some reason, this EPSG derived towgs84 value is slightly
different than the one you propose.  I would like to encourage
the QGIS team to work with me to ensure that such adjustments
are not done differently in QGIS than in the upstream database.

I will note that a substantial overhaul was done over the last year
to incorporate better datum shift selection when converting the
EPSG database to a proj.4 init file.

Best regards,
--

Thanks a lot Frank.
It is certainly better to use the new EPSG than patching it (improperly, as you show)
downstream.
Any idea on when this new EPSG will be release? Or perhaps we can incorporate the one
from trunk into qgis?
All the best.

Hi Peter,

Thanks for the response. Sorry if I wasn't clear - there was no real
question at this point, I was just following up on my previous question with
the resolution of the problem, mostly for the users list, and I copied the
message to the developers list as well, just for completeness.

However, the information about when and how Mins and Maxes can be calculated
is interesting. I am not sure that computeMinimumMaximumFromLastExtent is
what I want - I was using code form a plugin that was adjusting the color
scheme for the visible extent, not the whole layer (which is what I want to
do). Where does it store the result? This code:

        QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(resultsLayer)
        resultsLayer.triggerRepaint()
        band = resultsLayer.bandNumber(resultsLayer.grayBandName()) #Should
be 1
        minVal = resultsLayer.minimumValue(band)
        maxVal = resultsLayer.maximumValue(band)
        QtGui.QMessageBox.information(self, self.tr("MinMax"), self.tr("Min:
%s Max %s:" %(minVal, maxVal)))
        resultsLayer.computeMinimumMaximumFromLastExtent(band)
        minVal = resultsLayer.minimumValue(band)
        maxVal = resultsLayer.maximumValue(band)
        QtGui.QMessageBox.information(self, self.tr("MinMax"), self.tr("Min:
%s Max %s:" %(minVal, maxVal)))

Produces the same values (0.0 and 255.0) for a raster with values of 0 and 1
before and after calling computeMinimumMaximumFromLastExtent.

Calling this next:

 resultsLayer.setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm(QgsContrastEnhancement.StretchToMinimumMaximum)
        minVal = resultsLayer.minimumValue(band)
        maxVal = resultsLayer.maximumValue(band)
        QtGui.QMessageBox.information(self, self.tr("MinMax"), self.tr("Min:
%s Max %s:" %(minVal, maxVal)))

stretches the grayscale colormap to 0 and 1, with the layer properties (from
the GUI) Min and Max set to 0 and 1, so I assume that it is computing the
real values itself, I can't quite follow the internals. Without this call,
the properties window in the GUI shows 0 and 255 for min and max, even after
calling computeMinimumMaximumFromLastExtent (I can't seem to find a way to
figure out if this call does anything at all - I can't find any values or
results that indicate any effect, although I am probably looking in the
wrong place).

Of course, the MessageBox continues to report 0 and 255, so I not sure where
the correct information is stored.

The tip on using the PseudoColorShader was exactly what I needed, thank you.
I knew it was just something simple I was going at wrong.

Anyway, my plug-in works very nicely now, and I will add it to the QGIS
repository here in a few weeks when I hand in my assignment.

Cheers,
JP

JP,

the computeMinimumMaximumFromLastExtent() methods _do not set_ minimum 
and maximum values, they return them for you to use how you want. Using 
your variables names from below, you would want to use:

resultsLayer.computeMinimumMaximumFromLastExtent( band, minVal, maxVal )

After this call, your local variables minVal and maxVal would have 
values of 0 and 1 respectively. There is another convenience function 
called setMinimumMaximumUsingLastExtent(). This will _set_ the internal 
minimum maximum values of the band(s) currently being displayed.

However, you have not indicated which version of QGIS you are using, so 
both of these functions that I have mentioned may no be available to 
you. You would need to be compiling QGIS from the svn trunk (v1.6) to 
have access to these two functions.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help on Qt bug report
Message-ID: <201009071548.58451.volker27@gmx.at>

Dear developers!

I recently reported an artefact-bug I noticed in QGIS. It appears when you use 
a rubberband.

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2929

After some fiddling around, it turned out, it only appeared with Qt 4.6 and up. 
I therefore reported the bug upstream.

The Qt guys now want something, that I can't give to them: A sample 
application.

http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-13112?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-
tabpanel&focusedCommentId=125652#action_125652

Can somebody help me out?

Regards, Volker

JP,

In version 1.5 the python bindings were not correct. Python could not 
use the computeMinMaxFormLastExtent(int, double*) so the new method 
computeMinMaxFromLastExtent(int, double, double) was added.

Since you are running on windows, you could install the "nighly-build" 
QGIS package which would give you the developers version 1.6 and would 
not require you or your professor to compile manually. This would have 
all of the updated python bindings and newest methods mentioned in the 
responses.

Hi,

Anybody would like to develop a plugin for 4 dimensional data set using netCDF?

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/

Here are some of the netCDF viewer.

1. Ncview
http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html

2. Panoply netCDF, HDF and GRIB Data Viewer
http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/

There are python packages already

Thanks.

Hi,
you can also have a look at the CDAT python package for that :

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problems with xp/osgeo4w
Message-ID: <1283977645.1687.89.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

today I was testing osgeo4w on a windows 64 bit systems (see posts on
the users ml), but at some point I understand that something was wrong
also under 32 bit system.

I made a clean install of windows Seven 32 bit and no problems, but
under a clean installation of Windows XP 32 bit QGIS fails to start with
the following message:


the application failed to initialize properly (0xc01500002)


qgis-dev fails to run with the same message as does the standalone
version (QGIS-OSGeo4W-1.5.0-14109-Setup.exe)


cheers

Does installing the vcredist bundle help at all?  Also check if there are no
stray dlls e.g. proj.dll. in your system dir that may be causing problems.
Depends.exe is a handy tool to use for tracing the problem.

Hi,

doesn't help. I'm not a windows user, but I remembered posts about this
and was the first thing I have done.

This installation was made on a *fresh* windows Xp sp3 installation, no
other programs installed at all. The only proj.dll I see is in c:
\osgeo4w\bin



> Depends.exe is a handy tool to use for tracing the problem.


I need really more info on how to use it.


cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin elevation
Message-ID: <339bdff3c8b70b48a0f3898ee9a27e2e@localhost>


Hi all.
When using the plugin, if the bounding box of the canvas is outside legal
values for longlat, we get a crude error (see below). I guess this should
be handled a bit more nicely. Alternatively, on the fly projection could be
activated by the plugin itself, selecting the appropriate one.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi all.
When using the plugin, if an output file is improperly defined, we get an

All the best.

Hi All,

i'm tring to start some coding on the qgis api
i'm on osx 10.6.4 running qgis 1.6

following the example from : 


http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/html/canvas.html#using-map-tools-with-canvas

it works fine if i call it from a qgis-python shell

but i tried to make small changes to have it running as a standalone application,

i eliminated the "layer" from the init line :  

QMainWindow.__init__(self)

used a custom extent :

self.canvas.setExtent('15.1845401903089403,40.6214856769878665 : 15.2339879807105998,40.6477493100907381')

and commented out the line :

#self.canvas.setLayerSet( [ QgsMapCanvasLayer(layer) ] )

then from a standard python shell, i tried :

>>> import mywnd
>>> dir(mywnd)
['MyWnd', 'QAction', 'QMainWindow', 'QString', 'QgisInterface', 'QgsAnnotationItem', 'QgsColorButton', 'QgsColorButtonV2', 'QgsComposerView', 'QgsEncodingFileDialog', 'QgsFormAnnotationItem', 'QgsGenericProjectionSelector', 'QgsLegendInterface', 'QgsMapCanvas', 'QgsMapCanvasItem', 'QgsMapCanvasLayer', 'QgsMapCanvasMap', 'QgsMapCanvasSnapper', 'QgsMapOverviewCanvas', 'QgsMapTip', 'QgsMapTool', 'QgsMapToolEmitPoint', 'QgsMapToolPan', 'QgsMapToolZoom', 'QgsMessageViewer', 'QgsProjectBadLayerGuiHandler', 'QgsProjectionSelector', 'QgsQuickPrint', 'QgsRendererV2PropertiesDialog', 'QgsRendererV2Widget', 'QgsRubberBand', 'QgsStyleV2ManagerDialog', 'QgsSymbolLayerV2Widget', 'QgsSymbolV2PropertiesDialog', 'QgsSymbolV2SelectorDialog', 'QgsTextAnnotationItem', 'QgsVertexMarker', 'Qt', 'SIGNAL', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__']
>>> w = mywnd.MyWnd()
QWidget: Must construct a QApplication before a QPaintDevice
Abort trap


it give me a python crash ... obviously i'm missing something basilar,

have you any clue on what i need to change to have the example working outside qgis ?


thanks a lot !!!

I confirm, using the plugin builder [1] the generated Makefile seems invalid

on my Ubuntu too.

Could anyone fix this issue?


@Tim: replace your Makefile contents with the following code:

# Makefile for a PyQGIS plugin
UI_FILES = Ui_MeshPoly.py

RESOURCE_FILES = resources.py

default: compile
compile: $(UI_FILES) $(RESOURCE_FILES)

$(RESOURCE_FILES): %.py: %.qrc
    pyrcc4 -o $@ $<

$(UI_FILES): %.py: %.ui
    pyuic4 -o $@ $<


Make sure there are tabs (at least one) instead of spaces
before both pyuic4 and pyrcc4.

I hope this may help.
Cheers.

the MyWnd is a QWidget.

You must create a QApplication instance and only after this you can
show widgets within it.

Here an example (main.py):


from PyQt4.QtGui import QApplication
from mywdg import MyWdg

class MainApp(QApplication):
    def __init__(self, args):
        QApplication.__init__(self, args)
        wdg = MyWdg()
        wdg.show()
        self.exec_()

if __name__ == "__main__":
        import sys
    app = MainApp(sys.args)


Then open a terminal and run: python main.py
and if all went fine you can see your widget.

Cheers.

How interesting. Any plans to incorporate this work into main QGIS? I think this
would be a great enrichment of the project. Just 2 days ago we were discussing with a
colleague about the importance of a simplified QGIS to catch also the many
non-skilled GIS users.
All the best.

Will be more interesting than last year, with many more participants, esp.

Message-ID: <4C89E7D6.3070103@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
In the occasion of the release of GRASS 6.4, I think it would be good to revise the
current QGIS-GRASS modules. Specifically:
- there are modules that IMHO are of no use, and potentially confusing (e.g. several
of those who manage projections, etc.)
- there are new and useful modules to add to the toolbox
- not all modules have been thoroughly tested.
I encourage therefore GRASS users to help us defining both a wishlist for modules to
be included ad a deprecated list, and to let us know if there are non-functional
modules, so they can be fixed.
Thanks.

Hi Andreas,
Unfortunately, no slides from the FOSS4G are published yet. And since they had 
not enough WIFI logins, we were more or less offline this week.
QGIS mapserver had similar problems as other teams to get consistent results 
with the spanish dataset. So this years exercise was more about learning how 
to make a meaningful benchmark, than comparing the final numbers. The great 
thing is, that the benchmark machines will remain dedicatet for performance 
tests. So we have the possibility to solve the problems we had with the huge 
countour line layer. Anyway the FOSS4G was a good opportunity to let the 
people know about WMS mapserver and we got very positive feedback.

Thanks for the preliminary report.

QGIS Server is still a very young project. It probably can learn a lot
from the benchmark and the other implementations that are partially around
for many years.

Maybe also the desktop can profit from such efforts. And maybe the Google
Code project "QGIS on steroids" from Martin will also help to partially
enhance performance.

Thank you for participating at the benchmark and looking forward to hear
further conclusions.

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] viewing feature form
Message-ID: <4C8A0289.1090509@jena.de>

Dear QGIS devs,

since this is my first post on this list I want to thank all of you for 
your efforts in providing and improving this wonderful piece of software.

My question is as follows: How can I open the feature form for a feature 
through Python i.e. how can I make the same happen as if the user used 
the identifyTool and clicked on actions - "View feature form"?

regards

Benno

Hi,

Is there any reason why the shapefile is not rendering in this code
(below)? I tried several shapefiles and yet I am getting a white
canvas or blank canvas without a render. I was able to open the
shapefile and the form with mapcanvas are showing. Yet no render of
the polygons - totally blank.

self.canvas.setCanvasColor(Qt.white)  <---- a White Canvas without
render - BLANK

Thanks. Noli

Hi Noli

seems you're missing self.canvas.refresh() at the end of your code.

Hi  C?dric

I inserted self.canvas.refresh() as showed below but still a blank canvas.

~~~~~~~~
 # Set up the map canvas layer set
    cl = QgsMapCanvasLayer(layer)
    layers = [cl]
    self.canvas.setLayerSet(layers)
    self.canvas.refresh()
~~~~~~~~~

Thanks.

I solved it. I am using Ubuntu 10.04

I need to properly place the QGIS Install directory

qgis_prefix = os.getenv("/usr")


And I have to put, QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/usr", True)

Instead of using: QgsApplication.setPrefixPath(qgis_prefix, True)

Here's the code.

def main(argv):
  # create Qt application
  app = QApplication(argv)

  # Initialize qgis libraries
  QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/usr", True)
  QgsApplication.initQgis()

  # create main window
  wnd = ShapeViewer()
  # Move the app window to upper left
  wnd.move(100,100)
  wnd.show()

  # run!
  retval = app.exec_()

  # exit
  QgsApplication.exitQgis()
  sys.exit(retval)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main(sys.argv)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS - Selecting Spatialite Datasource at runtime
Message-ID: <AANLkTimSjzLtRgV9L_H4BgFBAMoH3GcxRsHtGTt66HCO@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Given, this example from PyQGIS documentation.

~~~~~~~~
uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
uri.setDatabase('/home/martin/test-2.3.sqlite')
uri.setDataSource('','Towns', 'Geometry')

layer = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), 'Towns', 'spatialite')
~~~~~~~~~

How do you do a runtime for the above. I want to select the table /
layer to load. How you figure out the  uri.setDataSource('',' ',
'Geometry') and  QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), ' ', 'Spatialite')?

~~~~~~~~
    file = QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(self,"Open Spatialite", ".",
"Spatialite (*.sqlite)")
    fileInfo = QFileInfo(file)

    uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
    uri.setDatabase(file)
    uri.setDataSource('',' ', 'Geometry')

    # Add the layer
    layer = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), ' ', 'Spatialite')

~~~~~~~~~

Paolo - agreed, an important issue. Please suggest a

Hi,

Paolo, if it is not of a too high level, could it be possible to write a 
wiki page explaining how to wrote and update the grass modules in qgis ? 
I would like to help on this point but I don't know how.

Hi Noli,

you could use this [1] (sorry, it's in Spanish). It uses the Sqlite3 Python
module [2].

Hi Germ?n,

Thank you.

German, would be able to share the whole source code of the project?

Thanks again.

Thanks, it's just a xml file so I think I'll be able to give a try :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] AutoGCP plugin and library
Message-ID: <4C8B339E.9030206@lantic.net>

Hi everyone.

For those interested, our AutoGCP C++ library and python plugin are now 
available for trying out.

These allow for the automated detection and cross-referencing of Ground 
Control Points between reference and raw images.

The library is distributed as a patch for inclusion into the main QGIS 
build at https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2987
The plugin is hosted at http://pyqgis.org/repo/contributed

Both the library and plugin are still in an early development stage.

We would really appreciate any comments or suggestions.

Thanks

James Meyer

Hi,

Is there a way to compile the actual svn trunk without 'qgis mapserver' 
? I don't want to make a build depending on fcgi but I've not found if 
there is a cmake's flag for it. I don't feel confident enought to 
editing CMakeList.txt :p

Hi Jean-Roc,

sure! you can set
WITH_MAPSERVER=FALSE

in cmake's options, or make a small text file containing something like:

cmake -Wno-dev \
  -DGRASS_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/grass-6.4.0RC5/include \
  -DGRASS_PREFIX=/usr/local/grass-6.4.0RC5 \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$1 \
  -DPEDANTIC=TRUE \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=FALSE ..\
  -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2.6\
  -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.6.so\
  -DWITH_MAPSERVER=FALSE

save it, set it executable, and run it instead of cmake command.

HTH!

Hi all,

I am starting an plugin for work with spatialite and postgresql/postgis, 
then, maybe is usefull (part of code for make an list  with connections 
of spatialite):

lstConnection = QGisDatabase.getListConnection("SpatiaLite")
if lstConnection.count() > 0:
  lstPaths = QtCore.QStringList()
  for item in lstConnection:
    lstPaths.append(QGisDatabase.getStringConnectSqlite(item))
  self.ui.comboBoxDatabase.addItems(lstPaths)

class QGisDatabase():
  @staticmethod
  def getListConnection(typDb):
    """ typDb = SpatiaLite OR PostgreSQL """
    typConn = QString("/%1/connections").arg(typDb)
    settings = QSettings()
    settings.beginGroup(typConn)
    lstQstringConn = settings.childGroups()
    settings.endGroup()
    return lstQstringConn
  @staticmethod
  def getStringConnectSqlite(connection):
    settings = QSettings()
    sKey = QString("/SpatiaLite/connections/%1/sqlitepath").arg(connection)
    return settings.value(sKey).toString()
  @staticmethod
  def getStringConnectPostgres(connection):

	type)
Message-ID: <AANLkTin7rDsw5jT=Y1MUQG-aSoG2QsX002cuPQJHeoAs@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
when trying to run QGIS Table Manager on Debian Lenny (Qt 4.4.3) it is
crashing with following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/ivo/.qgis/python/plugins/tablemanager/tableManager_plugin.py",
line 62, in run
    dialoga = tableManager_gui.TableManager(self.iface)
  File "/home/ivo/.qgis/python/plugins/tablemanager/tableManager_gui.py",
line 146, in __init__
    self.setupUi(self)
  File "/home/ivo/.qgis/python/plugins/tablemanager/tableManagerUi.py",
line 31, in setupUi
    self.progressBar.setProperty("value", 0)
TypeError: argument 2 of QObject.setProperty() has an invalid type

Changing line 31 to 'self.progressBar.setProperty("value",
QtCore.QVariant(0))' is fixing the problem.
File  'tableManagerUi.py' is generated, so I have no idea what to
change in 'ui' file to get it working correctly with older Qt
versions.

AFAIK it's a pyuic4 bug.

In GdalTools I fixed this issue by resetting the "value" property of
progressBars and spinBoxes to the default value in the .ui files (you
can use QtDesigner or remove the following lines from your .ui file)

<property name="value">

Hi All

Paolo is taking applications for travel assistance to the hackfest in
Poland in November - I'm putting in my request and I suggest others
who need financial help to get there do the same!

Any americans coming this time?

Thanks for providing this example - at least it supports my assumption
that I did not completely misunderstand the various documentation
samples  ;-)

Now, did anyone succeed in building recent QGIS SVN trunk against a
GRASS7 from SVN trunk ?  As an example, I'm calling 'cmake' this way:

cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/QGIS -D WITH_BINDINGS=TRUE \
-D GRASS_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/GRASS70/grass-7.0.svn/include \
-D GRASS_PREFIX=/opt/GRASS70 -D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=TRUE ../qgis_trunk/


Obviously GRASS is configured with "--prefix=/opt/GRASS70", but I'm
repeatedly getting the message:

-- Could not find GRASS


This is in no way troublesome for me, I'm just curious to know if
GRASS7 support in QGIS is supposed to be present or not.

Cheers,
	Martin.

Hi guys and girls,
I sent this message once before, but I do not think it got through, so I'm
reposting.

I know this is slightly off topic, but I ran out of places to ask... I'm
looking for a piece of software, it could be a standalone app, or some
JavaScript somewhere, that can calculate the 7 parameters of Helmerts
transformation from the coordinates of identical points. Lots of
applications can transform CRS, even on the fly, but I need something to
calculate the parameters...

The thing is I'm preparing for an exam, this is like a bar exam so I can get
to be a certified surveying engineer, and one of the questions is to
calculate the params. A decade ago, when I was a student, I had the formulas
in a Sharp programmable calculator (that I borrowed :-)). Alas, both the
knowledge, as well as the programmable calculator got lost somewhere over
the years :-)

Hi all,

I have asked this last week already but got no response. Is it possible 
to open the feature form from a python script?
Maybe the answer is so obvious that nobody felt responsible to give it. 
I read the api-doc back and forth and did not find any clue. So if I was 
asked I would answer no, this is not possible. Can anybody confirm (or 
better disprove :) this?

Hi Zoran

QGIS supports Helmert transformation in the georeferencer plugin and outputs 
the transformation parameters (optionally also as a pdf page output). Is this 
what you are looking for?

Marco

Hi Richard,

thank you for your answer. What you describe is exactly what I am aiming 
at: I have a custom form (ui) which should pop up when the user clicks 
on a menu-action. There is some Python work on selected geometries prior 
to the form showing. I could of course translate the form into Python 
but then I would have to programmatically enter all form values in their 
respective fields. Generally speaking I like to use as much 
out-of-the-box functionality, so for users the plugin behaves as they 
would expect from their prior experience using QGIS.

all the best

Bernhard

Message-ID: <cc6ad99c32d16bb38ef76bee1103af32@localhost>


Hi all.
we're using the very nice FH plugin, and we encountered the following
issues:

- when clicking (a single click) on the canvas, with simplification
parameter >0, we get an error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/paolo/.qgis/python/plugins/freehandEditing/freehandediting.py",
line 152, in createFeature
s = g.simplify(tolerance)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'simplify'

- if simplify is >0.2, no polygon is drawn

- if on the fly projection is on, the new polygons are placed far from the
relevant area.

Any feedback is welcome. I think this would be a good candidate to be
incorporated as a core plugin.
All the best.

Yes, this will happen because it will try to create polygon feature from 
one point geometry. We should catch such features and do nothing on them.

- if simplify is>0.2, no polygon is drawn


There is a problem with QGIS simplify function, which is creating empty 
features in case when you draw feature vertexes very near to each other. 
Maybe there is some problem with decimal numbers.
Try to zoom out and You can use simplify > 1.0.

AFAICS if the fly projection is on, the polygons I draw are placed in the
position they would have using the layer CRS. Instead, the polygon should be

placed using the canvas CRS!!!

I see. So why not setting an optimal (?) parameter and letting user just
tune it (say, +-50% respect to the optimal value)? Currently it is rather
difficult to use.
Thanks a lot.

Too bad,

I hoped that was because of the "old" version of GEOS shipped with qgis
for windows (there is already a ticket in the osgeo4w bug tracker).

Hi Paolo,

Could you please file a ticket for this (please be sure to assign it
to me), and if possible a test dataset? I can't reproduce the problem
here on Ubuntu 10.04 self compiled trunk. Please also mention which
version of GEOS you are using.

Thanks,

This site is not working. You better copy the whole code and post or attach it.

Hi Massimo,
as I wrote to you:

class MainApp(QApplication):
    def __init__(self, args):
        QApplication.__init__(self, args)
        wdg = MyWdg()
        wdg.show()
        self.exec_()

if __name__ == "__main__":
        import sys
    app = MainApp(sys.args)

That is, you missed the "args" variable ;)
Cheers.

Hi Giuseppe, 

i tried with the "args" variable, 
i have :


MacBook-Pro-15-di-sasha:~ sasha$ python /qgistry.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/qgistry.py", line 66, in <module>
    app = MainApp(sys.args)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'args'


so i tried also without the "args" value,
what i'm missing ?

thanks to help me,

Massimo.

Hi all.
Can someone tell us more about this?
Thanks a lot.

-------- Messaggio originale --------
On the desktop GIS side, I attended the Quantum GIS breakout session in
which QGIS developers and users discussed current and future
developments. We were shown a very interesting 3D extension currently
under development and there was also much discussion about QGIS and SLD
and how moving towards the use of SLD would be very desirable.
Reprojection on the fly of raster datasets was also added to the QGIS
wish list.

Hi  Paolo & devs,

We have organized a QGIS user & developer meeting in the breakout session 
slot. There attendance was good, despite the rare information from the 
organisator.
Marco made a short presentation with an overview of the new functionality in 
QGIS 1.5 and information what's going on in current development.
He talked about the table join improvements, the threading branch (GSOC 
project) and the QGIS WMS server.
We presented some plugins which came with QGIS 1.5 and I demonstrated my Globe 
plugin (http://pifx.blip.tv/file/4076305/). It is an early stage, but I plan to 
work on it at the hackfest in Wroclaw.
A survey about whishes for coming versions gave the following result:
-All PostGIS errors available for plugins
-Raster reprojection
-Show WMS style name in WMS layer legend
-Show WMS legend (GetLegendGraphic) in layer legend
-Show Raster style in layer legend
-SLD import/export (QML<->SLD?)
-C++ implementation of fTools plugins
-Put student project ideas in Wiki

After that we had to hurry up for the Gala dinner...

Regards
Pirmin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] cmake error on OS X 10.6
Message-ID: <AANLkTim_XgssbaVniwtxg78XjJPEoB41B1F6zJJ3iZ4c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Devs,

I am trying to build QGIS on OS X 10.6.  I have not exactly followed the
instructions from the Installation
Guide<http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Installation_Guide#Building_on_Mac_OSX_using_frameworks_and_cmake_or_Xcode>because
I had lots of trouble getting PyQt built/installed.  Anyway, I ended
up installing the dependencies using KyngChaos frameworks where available
and MacPorts for the rest.  I am new to Mac (was using Ubuntu before, not
loving Mac right now), so I am hoping I can sort this out and get it to
build.  I am now getting an error running cmake, it says:

FindGSL.cmake: gsl-config not found. Please set it manually.
GSL_CONFIG=GSL_CONFIG-NOTFOUND

How would I go about doing this?  GSL was installed from the KyngChaos
frameworks, so I was surprised to see this error; I was expecting others
since I didn't exactly follow the instructions.  GSL installed in the
Library/Frameworks.

Thanks in advance,

Matt

Okay - so I seemed to fix this error by adding the following to cmake:

-D
GSL_CONFIG_PREFER_PATH:STRING=/Library/Frameworks/GSL.framework/Versions/1/unix/bin

Now I receive the following error during make:

sip: /Users/matt/Development/qgis/python/core/conversions.sip:269: Mapped

Any ideas?

I confess that since setting up the Xcode project, I use it exclusively and haven't tried a cmake build in a while, though others have with success.

The Qgis cmake configure should automatically find known frameworks.  GDAL and GEOS are known, but GSL is fairly recent as a framework and the cmake stuff wasn't updated.

Odd, I see that the cmake test for PROJ doesn't check for a framework.

I don't know about this.  I have heard about a problem related to some already defined or undefined error with the latest SIP/PyQt (unrelated to Qgis directly).  I've been holding off on trying them until I see new versions.  (last versions I used are SIP 4.10.5, PyQt 4.7.4)

I personally don't use and don't recommend MacPorts (or Fink) when using other available binaries like my frameworks.  Past experience (though mostly old, but some recent from others) has shown that they often interfere with or override other binaries.

The build instructions should work just fine with a minimum of fuss.

Hi All!

I'm trying to use custom forms for adding and editing features within a layers.

The forms that I'm creating need to query a PostgreSQL database to populate controls. Using the UI init function seems like the thing to do here. I've managed to populate the controls by setting up a new connection and executing the query from within this init function.

However these forms will be opened up all the time, and from a database administrators point of view I would like cache the database connection so a new connection is not created every time the form is opened. To make things more complicated I would like to share this connection across multiple feature forms within one QGIS user project. I also have a few other functions relating to the admin of these layers that I currently have in a plug-in which also needs the same database connection.

Is there a way to do connection caching with all of this? I thought about having a singleton class in my plug-in that stores this connection, but it looks like I can't access the plug-in registry from the PyQGIS api :(

Note I'm using psycopg2 for the database connections.

Thanks,
Jeremy

Can I suggest you to use QSqlDatabase and QSqlQuery (both present in Qt
classes) ?

Hi Jeremy,

I had a similar problem recently when I wanted to share the same 
connection amongst several plugins. What I did is to create a "master" 
plugin which adds a menu in the menu bar when initialized. I created a 
psycopg.connection - Object and attached it to the menu. Each plugin 
using this connection creates an instance of the master-plugin class. If 
the master-plugin class has been initialized by another plugin (menu 
added, connection set up) the master-plugin object is initialized 
differently: the existing connection is used.
I am not sure if this is the way one should do this but it works :)
Be sure to end the transaction after each sql-command issued 
(con.commit() or con.rollback()) even after a SELECT, see:
http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/faq.html

How do you access the widgets in the custom ui in your ui-init function?


Here is the code:

class MasterPlugin():
     def __init__( self, iface ):
         self.iface = iface
         self.menu = None
         self.title = "&Master Plugin"
         self.con = None # ini
         menu_bar = self.iface.mainWindow().menuBar()
         actions = menu_bar.actions()

         # has the menu been added by another plugin?
         for action in actions:
             if action.text() == self.title:
                 self.menu = action.menu()
                 self.actMenu = action
                 self.con = self.menu.con
                 break

         if self.menu == None:
             # create the menu
             self.menu = QMenu()
             self.menu.setTitle( self.title )
             lastAction = actions[ len( actions ) - 1 ]
             self.actMenu = menu_bar.insertMenu( lastAction, self.menu )
	    #some stuff left out here
	    con = self.dbConnect( selected )

             if con:
                self.con = con
                self.menu.con = con


class OtherPlugin():
     def initGui(self):
         # create MasterPlugin object
         self.mp = MasterPlugin( self.iface )

     def selectFromDB( self ):
	cur = self.mp.con.cursor()

hope this helps

Bernhard

How nice! Can you tell us more about it? I see osgearth is not in Debian repos, do
you know why? Why don't you add to the standard repo, so we can start palying with it?

We have a plugin for this.
For the others, have you opened appropriate tickets?
Again, many thanks.
All the best.

Because it's integrated into QT framework.

Again, in my QGIS 1.5 Windows install if I do this at Python Console:

>>> import psycopg2
Traceback (most recent call last):

File "U:/Applicazioni/qgis-1.5.0-2/apps/qgis/./python\qgis\utils.py", line

Hi all.
Sorry about my ignorance about Windows: if one installs the standalone version, then
needs to update, or add additional libraries, is it possible to use the osgeo4w
installer to just add/update, or the two systems are alternative?
Thanks for clarifying (maybe an explanation could be put on the download page too).
All the best.

Oh ok I haven't try the QPSQL driver.  So does the QT framework have rich support for using PostgreSQL? 

I'm also gathering that the QT driver fits in better with the QT model control paradigm?  

Thanks,
Jeremy

Hi Bernhard,

Thanks for the suggestion. I think I could get that to work. The only problem is my python init script needs to know how to import the MasterPlugin module... So I would have to install the module into a directory in python path. Not ideal in my environment at the moment.

Wouldn't it be nice to just have access to the qgsPluginRegistry via the PyQGIS API?

> How do you access the widgets in the custom ui in your ui-init function?

I access the controls using the findChild method of the QDialog object i.e.

def featureFormInit(dialog, layerid, featureid):
	dialog.findChild(QLineEdit,"myLineEditControl")

It would be a good practice to ensure that each control is defined and available before doing any other stuff in the ui-init stuff.

Cheers,
Jeremy

I use it regulary in my plugin. For example, there's a very useful class:
QSqlQueryModel, you write a query and you can "push it" results in a
QTableView automatically (no need to define columns, iterate over records,
etc). See all QtSql classes here:

http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qtsql.html

(it's QT 4.5, the same version of the windows QGIS 1.5 distribution).

Yes, but if you want to distribute that plugin "worldwide", using the QT
library is a better option.

Message-ID: <OF2FB3FBA2.FDB01B09-ONC12577A0.004CD08C-C12577A0.004CF72C@comune.trento.it>


from:
http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2010/09/16/spatialite-is-not-the-shapefile-of-the-future/

"In this case SpatiaLite is dying a slow death because no one is actually
implementing it. Now yes OGR, FDO and other libraries support it, but you
don?t see that making its way into mainline software (QGIS aside, but even
its support is poor) and in turn you rarely see it in the real world.
Offhand I can only think of the ?beta? format that GeoCommons has on their
service (and they?ve had beta attached to it for almost a year).

Now yes, I think we all need a better format than the venerable shapefile
(and it?s three amigos) which as a transmission format fails miserably. But
there doesn?t seem to be any indication that this is a problem people
actually want solved. I?ve seen much more effort put into KML, GeoJSON and
LAS by the community than SpatiaLite or even SQLite. This isn?t because the
SpatiaLite project hasn?t given tools to us to implement, it has been the
community could care less about it. SHP works for them and there isn?t any
reason to change.


So what is going to change things? Well it will be web services, not GIS
formats that matter for users moving forward. So I say lets stop focusing
on SpatiaLite as a consumer format and actually work harder at making
better web services for these users (like stop it already with the WxS
please). SpatiaLite still has its place in the world, but does anyone
really want to bother downloading GIS files anymore? Of course not?"

Hi Pirmin.

Interesting.  You don't have problems with GSL or PROJ frameworks?  Maybe you have an old /usr/local GSL from before my framework?

I suppose I should give it a whirl to make sure it's all working...

As far as I can tell, I do not have any remnant gsl laying around. I upgraded my hardware in the past 6 months and started afresh with additional unix libs, binaries, etc. I did not install any gsl other than your framework to my knowledge.

I believe some updates occurred in the past 6-10 months with egis where your frameworks are automagically picked up by cmake. Here is my commandline output from running the cmake command I posted:

Hi All OSGeo4W users/developers,

If you are like me, you cannot run any of the plugins that are dependent on
the matplotlib module.
Each time I install such a plugin I've got an error telling me that a
dependency is missing: tkinter.

I've just realised that the default 'gui backend' in the OSGeo4W matplotlib
is tkinter, but tkinter is not installed and not available (AFAIK) in
OSGeo4W!

The solution, change the default 'gui backend' from tkinter to qt4. Here is
how:

1) copy the file 'matplotlibrc' from
"C:\...\OSGeo4W\apps\python25\lib\site-packages\matplotlib\mpl-data" to
"C:\Documents and Settings\--your user name here--\.matplotlib

2) edit the above file and change the line 31 from:
    backend      : TkAgg
to:
    backend      : Qt4Agg

3) restart QGIS and install a matplotlib-dependant plugin. It should work.
I've tested with Lionel Roubeyrie's contour plugin and could, at last,
generate contours from shapefile points!

Hope the above is of some help!

Cheers,
Benoit

P.S. If an OSGeo4W maintainer reads this could you please change the default
gui backend to QT4?

I've uploaded an osgearth package to ubuntugis-unstable. I'd be happy to 
submit it to debian-gis, if someone could give me some guidance.
The globe plugin is a C++ plugin based on the threading branch and can be 
downloaded from

No. If submitting a ticket is the right way, it would be nice, if someone

Just noticed,

if the TOC is empty and you click the right mouse button you still get
"add group, etc.". If the TOC contains at least one layer the menu does
not show anymore.

I don't know if it is related with the ticket I opened today: in trunk
in the TOC does not show anymore the symbology/legend of vectors.

Tested on both linux and windows.

John and William,

Thank you for your input.

So both of you have used the procedure presented in the Install Guide?  I
guess I will uninstall the MacPorts libs, etc and try the methods from the
guide again.

Could one of you please tell me the name of the Qt pakage you used?  It
looks like there are a number to choose from, SDK, debug, etc.  I think this
might have been where I went wrong before.

Thanks again for your help.

Matt

Hi Brett:

I do indeed see a problem exporting to the AGD84 CRS. I get a "Latitude 
or Longitude exceeds limits" error. This happens when the global CRS is 
set to WGS84 (which is the default in QGIS). Attached is a screen shot 
of the error.

Here's how to overcome the problem: Change your Global CRS to AGD84 zone 
51 (BTW, that's EPSG code 20351). This is done in the 
Settings->Options->CRS dialog window. Now re-import the csv file and 
then save as shapefile and you should be able to select the AGD84 CRS 
and have it saved correctly.
Alternatively, if you don't want to change the global CRS setting, you 
can select (in the same Settings->Options-CRS window) to "Prompt for 
CRS".  Then when you import the csv you'll be asked to specify the 
correct CRS for the points, You again select AGD84 and all should be well.

Cheers,
Micha

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Saving shapefile and Global CRS
Message-ID: <4C934898.80803@arava.co.il>

A user posted a problem on the qgis-user list [1] regarding saving a 
shapefile in the AGD84 zone 51 CRS  = EPSG code 20351. (This CRS is in 
the S. hemisphere).

I opened a ticket for this issue [2]

But the problem he raised got me rethinking the Global CRS setting.  
Suggestions have been raised in the past regarding choice of the global 
CRS. Here's another case where someone got tripped up partly due to the 
default setting of WGS84. I think the current behavior is still not optimal.

The different approaches for choosing a global CRS are sometimes coined:
the "ArcMAP way" - the global CRS is set according to the CRS of the 
first layer loaded.
the "GRASS way" - the CRS MUST be chosen at program startup.
the "QGIS way" - the global CRS is always WGS84 until the user sets 
something else.
 
When loading new data layers, we have the option to choose either 
"Prompt for CRS", or "Use the global default CRS". I'd like to suggest a 
parallel setting for the global CRS. That is, the user can choose, just 
like in loading layers, to either "Prompt for CRS" whenever a project is 
started (i.e. whnever QGIS starts up) or "Use global default" whenever a 
project is started. In this second case, the same global default will be 
used for new layers with unknown CRS, and for the project itself.
What problems will this solve?
"Naive" users who mostly work in a single CRS, can set that once as 
their global default, and have all new projects honor that CRS. Then 
loading, saving etc will work transparently.
"Advanced" users who need to switch between different CRS will select to 
be prompted each time, then QGIS will prompt at every program startup 
(and every opening of a new project) which CRS.
I think an arrangement like this will help float to the surface some 
workflow problems that get hidden under the Global CRS setting.

Regards,
Micha

It's hard to get the wrong one.  Either the SDK or the library-only package works (though the SDK has a few 100 MB of extra stuff you don't need), and the debug libs (unnecessary) won't install without the libraries or SDK installed.

Note: do you want to try latest new features/bug fixes in trunk, or just use Qgis as released?  I have the binaries on my site.  I haven't done a dev build in a while, so maybe I should do that this weekend...

Last night I downloaded the 64bit Qt library-only package (The SDK didn't
say if it was 32 or 64 bit).  I went through the Installation Guide again
and this time was able to get past the SIP/PyQt installs following the
guide.  The only thing I had to do that wasn't in the guide was add the
non-framework path to PYTHONPATH in my .bash-profile.

PYTHONPATH='/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages'
export PYTHONPATH

When it came to actually building QGIS I successfully ran cmake.  However I
am still receiving the same/similar error as before:

Linking CXX shared library libqgis_analysis.dylib
[ 63%] Built target qgis_analysis
[ 64%] Generating analysis/sipanalysispart0.cpp,
analysis/sipanalysispart1.cpp, analysis/sipanalysispart2.cpp,
analysis/sipanalysispart3.cpp

sip: /Users/matt/Development/qgis/python/core/conversions.sip:269: Mapped
type has already been defined in another module
make[2]: *** [python/analysis/sipanalysispart0.cpp] Error 1
make[1]: *** [python/CMakeFiles/python_module_qgis_analysis.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

I suspect that this may be due to the fact that it took me multiple tries to
get SIP/PyQt installed correctly.  Any idea what this message means?  I am
thinking that maybe I have SIP installed in multiple locations from failed
past attempts.  Do you think that would cause this error?

I need to build from source because I am working on a plugin that is written
in C++.  This is a project that I had to set down a few months ago.  In the
mean time I have switched platforms and am now trying to pick this project
back up.  I use the QtCreator IDE for coding and CMake to build.  This setup
has worked well for me in the past and allows for easy gui development and
debugging all in QtCreator.

Even that should not be necessary.  That path is wired into the system python.  If you installed and use the python.org python, it's not set there, but then you should compile python extensions into it's site-packages.

I don't know at this point, though it does sound familiar.

If you did a basic SIP/PyQt build at one time, without the flags to set explicit install locations, you may have some leftovers in the system python, which you can delete.  Look in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6:

bin: pylupdate4, pyrcc4, pyuic4, sip

include: sip.h

share: sip folder

lib/python2.6/site-packages: sip and pyqt files

And possibly /usr/bin, /usr/include and /usr/share for the same.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Error installing QGis from ubuntugis-unstable ppa
Message-ID: <AANLkTikqPVSw-5TjN9W==5y0kSBCE+vy8_t_=C2YTwp+@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I tried to install qgis1.5 from ubuntugis-unstable ppa on my Ubuntu Karmic,
but using Synaptic (Package Manager) I get this error:

E: python-qgis: subprocess installed post-installation
script returned error exit status 1

Here the Synaptic output [1]

I have also qgis trunk installed by compiling the sources.
Maybe does the new installation conflict with the previous installed qgis?
If it does, how can I keep both trunk and stable at the same time?

Thanks a lot!

Cheers.

Oh.  Okay.  I have the python.org version installed. so my SIP/PyQt
configure should have "-d
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/python2.6/site-packages"
not "-d /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages"

I am still figuring out the whole OS X directory structure and though that
that was the system python...not realizing that there is a python at
/System/Library/...  As a result I have SIP/PyQt split into two places.
None in the System Python but in both other locations mentioned above.

I guess I have some clean-up to do.

With the python.org python, you just use the first form:

python configure.py

That defaults to putting everything in the python framework.

That said, I haven't tried it in a long time, since I don't use the python.org python.  You may get deployment target complaints from python.

Using python configure.py takes care of the architecture (I.e. 32 vs 64 bit)
too?

I think it will default to 32bit.

Matthew,

Is there a specific reason to use python.org? Generally speaking, it seems to prove best on OS X to avoid overriding system provided bins and libs when possible.

Cheers,
John

John, I guess the only reason was that I wanted to use Idle at one time.  I
don't care anymore though.  In your opinion would it be better uninstall the
python.org version?  Will that remove
\Library\Frameworks\Python.frameworks...?

I am just trying to figure out how to proceed to get this cleaned up and
working.

There are 2 camps on this: system and python.org, though I don't want to start a debate about that here ;)  Both are valid, though I prefer the system version, and it's also the one most tested with Qgis as far as I know.

If you want to uninstall python.org, deleting /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework is a start.  It probably also has added something to your PATH in your ~/.bash_profile.  And there also may be symlinks and scripts in /usr/local/bin, and maybe some headers or symlinks in /usr/local/include.

William knows much more about all of this than I do. With that said, I am a significant portion of the testing on OS X, and I have never used python.org. I would say dump it if you don't explicitly need it. Also, work out getting a build system for qgis that works, then start to tinker if you have to do so.

Cheers,
John

Thank so much to both of you for your input.  You both know much more about
this than I do so I shall follow your lead.

I discovered that there is some guidance in the python documentation
regarding uninstalling...and it agrees with Williams advice so I will do it.

Update:  I removed all old SIP/PyQt installs (I think I got them all) as
well as the python.org version of python.  Reinstalled everything from the
Installation Guide, but alas I am still getting the same error.  I think I
may have found the solution though, it looks like it may be a known bug
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2985.  There is a diff included that
might fix it.  Is applying a diff difficult? (ha).  I will poke around the
internet and see if I can find out how to do it.  Any direction would be
appreciated.

Well, if I am understanding this correctly, it looks like this diff has
already been applied to trunk.  However, it seems like this is where the
problem might be.

I just ran a trunk build from Xcode.  No patches for that Qgis SIP bug have been applied yet, so I had to do that ot my local source copy to get it to compile.  The PyQt bug mentioned there about utf8 *has* been applied to PyQt trunk.

2 ways to apply a diff: patch command and manually.  Since the patch is lines of text on a web page instead of a file download, this one is simple enough to apply manually, it's just deleting a bunch of lines.  Delete lines 268-318 of python/core/conversions.sip.

Hi all,

friday (17.9.) I uploaded newiest version of Freehand Editing plugin to 
repo (including patch from Ivan). I also tried to fix the "on the fly 
issue" changing line of code responsible for coordinate transformation. 
So please let me know, if this change was helpful some way.

All the best

If you want update you need to install using the osgeo4w installer.   The
standalone installer isn't updateable.

Hi Pavol.
Seems to work better. However, if I digitize with OTFP on, layers are
digitized using the canvas coord rather than the layer coord.
Thanks a lot.

Hi all.
Our roadmap looks outdated:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/roadmap
1.6 should be due in 10 days, which is unrealistic.
I would suggest to postpone 1.6 to after the hackfest (let's say, 30 Nov),
and 2.0 to 30 April.
Of course that's not terribly important, but is a bit of cosmetics that can
make users happier.
Any better suggestion? Comments?
All the best.

I'd rather say Dec 15 or 31 - otherwise we'll need to freeze the features 
before the HF! 

Marco and Martin - do you plan to merge your branches for the 1.6?

Hallo all,

I was, well, not really surprised by the quick fix. I experinced very 
fast reactions before. Thank you very much, jef!
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3015

It would be great if any changes made to the attributes by user input 
would be saved to the feature if the layer is in editing mode (same as 
when opened through "view feature form"). Is there any chance of 
implementing this with a reasonable effort?
In that case I would open a new ticket (or reopen #3015?)

Otherwise I would go throug reading out all values and applying changes 
through my code. How can I access the QDialog from Python then (after 
user clicked "OK")?

regards

Bernhard

yes, I'd like to polish the things in the threading branch and get it
into 1.6 release.

Hi Golubev,

Did you manage to get this to work?
I am having the same problem, trying to build QGIS 1.5.0 in Qt Creator under
windows xp. I get the same errors. Can anyone suggest a solution?

Have you read this[1] instruction how build Qgis?

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Installation_Guide

I think if you don't follow this instruction you are own your own.

  Hi,

I notice the Geos version used in the osgeo4w installation of qgis-dev 
is the 3.0.3.

There is some incompatibility with a more recent version like the Geos 
3.2.2 version ?

Thx,

No(t that I know).  OSGeo4W simply has 3.0 and updating probably would mean
rebuilding a bunch of stuff.

Ok.

Actually there is a bit of difference versions.
because
Postgis 1.5.1 use the 3.2.0 version.
Spatialite 2.4 use the Geos 3.2.2.

This has some results on the precision of the results.
Because a more recent version of geos has more fixed bugs.

So I think if a plugin on qgis use geos available with python it will be affect from all the bugs
presents to Geos 3.0.3 level.
for example this bug was resolved in the 3.1 version of geos.
http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/275

This is not a little question because to use a qgis plugin to do a Union or a Clip instead of postgis or spatialite
can give different results on different problems.

Another exaple was on a plugin we are developing.
It will use the WKT of a geometry, but the WKT developed in qgis will have some little difference from the WKT generate from postgis.

So I'm thinking perhaps is possible to compile only the dll and substitute the dll to the actual dll of geos used from qgis.
Don't ?

Thx,

Andrea Peri.

Hello Paolo!

I recently discovered that as well. If you take a look at your exported kml 
file, you'll notice, that pratically all data is embraced by <ExtendedData>-
tags. I wrote to the GDAL ML (http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2010-
August/025800.html), but the results are a bit unclear:

Whilst one argued, KML would not map well to OGR, one suggested it might be 
the driver. We planned to compile GDAL with libkml to see if it would change 
the situation. That sadly didn't come into existence in Fedora, because our 
libkml was outdated and there was also a license issue. GDAL's packager was 
busy as well -- so no results from our side yet.

Bottomline: The KML file is most likely OK, but you won't see the tabular data 
in QGIS.

You probably need to define _WIN32_WINNT=0x0500 to enable some areas in the Windows headers, which weren't available prior to Windows 2000.

In CMakeSetup, CXX_FLAGS should be -D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0500

This appears to be an issue only with MinGW building.

How much interest is there in building QGIS with MinGW?

Hi Golubev,

Did you manage to get this to work?
I am having the same problem, trying to build QGIS 1.5.0 in Qt Creator under
windows xp. I get the same errors. Can anyone suggest a solution?

Just a follow up.  After applying the patch and upgrading to PyQt trunk I
was able to get QGIS installed from source.  And I learned some things along
the way :)

William and John:  Thanks again for all your help.

I'm glad to hear you had success. I played catchup today with a bunch of stuff and ran into the same build problem you had reported. Thanks for your good research on the patch as that saved me some grief. I still managed to have a corrupt cache database and some other issues that made the upgrades slow me down quite a bit.

Good luck with you qgis work,
John

hi Martin, sorry for delay in response,

It is not clear from the wiki page [0] but I confirm that GRASS7 is not
supported, nor 6.5 develbranch.

Hi Volker.
Thanks for helping me to understand. So if I understand it correctly, the internal
GDAL KML writer is buggy, and should better be replaced by libkml. What are the
licencing issues? AFAIK libkml is BSD, more or less like GDAL.
If this is so, the issue is mainly a packager one, am I wrong?
All the best.

Well, I'm not certain, libkml will help. It was only suggested. I also don't 
know if that is really a bug. I suppose they just made it that way.

Fedora is rather strict on license issues. Libkml includes a third party 
directory which is tedious to get rid of in the Makefile. These are the trouble 
makers for Fedora. They may have good licenses. Yes, it's a packager's problem 
-- nothing else. But this is one of the reasons, we didn't try yet.

Hello,

I'm preparing my master's thesis on the subject of handling fuzzy objects using the fuzzy logic, with the focus on geometries (not on the thematic level).
I wanted to know, if there has already been a discussion about implementing this in QGIS or in a plugin.

Showing the uncertainty of boundaries is needed in some cases of spatial planning, when the "crisp" geometries are not yet defined.

A possible use case could also be to draw a polygon with certain attributes, then the border of the polygon "copied" to one or more oriented polyline layers with special attributes (e. g. the distance of the uncertainty, to which the fuzzy-function is applied). These polylines are linked by a foreign key to the polygon-feature. This would certainly require the use of a database, namely Postgre/PostGIS.
A polyline layer (linked to the polygon) can also be "crisp" e.g. if the border is a street or a river. So it should be possible to combine crisp and fuzzy segments for the same polygon.
Visualising this could result in a polygon with a sort of "thick pen-trace"  (the thickness corresponding to the distance-attribute of the polyline) boundary, showing the uncertain band. The thickness corresponds to the distance-attribute of the polyline.

Another possible visualisation (sort of fuzzy buffers) is presented in the following paper: http://www.geo3.nl/12%20fuzzy%20set%20theory.pdf (fig. 1b).

If there are developers interested in this, I would be glad to know, as my own programming skills are rather basic.

Thanks in advance
Annina

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Selecting a shape with the mouse?
Message-ID: <1285190832014-5560908.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hi,

I'm writing an GIS application using QGIS 1.5.0. 

I have been trying to select one shape with the mouse from the canvas to
then maybe change its color or query its data. But I still don't know how to
do it.

I'm using QtCreator.

Help!!!

Many thanks,
Carlos.

That's ok, at least I know that I'm not supposed to try harder  ;-)

Thanks for clarifying,

Message-ID: <2BC3EB38-7745-41FF-A950-CD2D5F9511F7@yahoo.it>

Hi :-)

i'm tring to use my bluethout gps device with Qgis,  but it is no recognized 
(there is no way in Qgis  to manually add the path to device) ..

To fix i need to add manually "/dev/tty.GarminGPS10-Gps10" in : qgsgpsinformationwidgetbase.ui 

(i added my device in the .ui file using "add item" in the combo box widget)

The weirs is .. after build qgis with the changes in " qgsgpsinformationwidgetbase.ui " 
i have no new entry in the combobox, it is empty

but  just "select the first entry (position 1  in the combobox, where i added the item in the .ui file)
it is empty ... (no device visible) but i'm able to connect to the device.

Is inside qgis a place where i can "statically" set the path to my gps device ?

Like a dialog to set manually the device address ?
(instead or in addition to choose it from the combobox, beacouse autodetect device doesn't works as aspected)


thanks for any hints!


Best regards,

Massimo

Hi,

in my project options I've set snap tolerance for a layer of 10 pixels.

How can I get this value with QgsTolerance (or similiar)?

Hi Massimo,

This is a known issue on OS X, but has received little attention to date. Other than manually setting up the path as you have done, I know of no other solution.

Hi Mohammed

Yes, it is possible (but the application needs to be licensed under the terms 
of GPL).

> which part of code is responsible for vector editing/digitising ?

Basically the class QgsVectorLayer (qgsvectorlayer.h). This class caches the 
edits in memory and commits changes to the providers.

> what all includes from Qgis do i need to use?

You need the core library (libqgiscore.so) and probably also the gui library 
for display.

> Any please help me with an example

You could look at the edit tool classes (e.g. qgsmaptooladdfeature.cpp/h, 
qgsmaptoolsplitfeatures.cpp/h).

Regards,
Marco

Way lost a so cool enanchment ?

What a bout a small changes in  the gui ?

the combobox is good to select the device .. but it has no  way to be populate manually, hence,

why not add a "tool button" beside the combo-box, to open a file-dialogue 
se the user  can choose a device manually and when click on ok it will update the combo-box with the device address ?

what do you think about ?


thanks!

Massimo.

That would be a good option. You should review the ticket and add a comment accordingly.

Hi,

You can get a series of examples from:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/code_examples

Some of them need a bit of workout to make them work with the latest version
of QGIS but its a good start.

Carlos.

Solve it by:

Creating and EmitPoint too;:
    mpSelectTool = new QgsMapToolEmitPoint(mpMapCanvas);
    mpSelectTool->setAction(selectAct);

Connecting the signal canvasClicked to a custom slot   
connect(mpSelectTool,SIGNAL(canvasClicked(QgsPoint,Qt::MouseButton)),this,SLOT(pointSelected(QgsPoint,Qt::MouseButton)));

Custom slot
void browseMap::pointSelected(QgsPoint point, Qt::MouseButton button)
{
            QgsPoint end(point);
            end.setX(point.x()+0.1);
            end.setY(point.y()+0.1);

            QgsRectangle rect(point,end); //Very small rectangle because if
point = end QGIS select all shapes

            QgsMapLayer * currlayer; //A layer

            currlayer = myList[0].layer();  //My layer of interest

            if (qobject_cast<QgsVectorLayer *>(currlayer))  //If it is a
shape layer
            {
                qobject_cast<QgsVectorLayer
*>(currlayer)->select(rect,false);  //Select the shape
            }
}


Hope this help others.

Hi,

I'm testing the "topocolour" plugin under qgis-trunk/Ubuntu and when it
comes to choose the colour palette the dropdown doesn't show any.

It is supposed to pick somewhere the palettes and copy them in the
system, or it is just a bug?

thanks in advance

 Ooh I wrote that...

 Once you've computed the graph colouring then the Layer Style tab
should be active, and that should have fields for Colour Scheme, Line
Type, Width, and Line Colour. The Colour Scheme drop-down should give
you a nice list of palettes derived from the ColorBrewer system.

 However the ColorBrewer palettes only supply palettes with a certain
number of colours, and if your map can only be coloured with 23 unique
colours then it may well be that the colour scheme drop-down is empty.
When you hit the 'Compute Colouring' button it should tell you how
many colours are needed.

 I suspect your map needs either only 1 or 2 colours or more than 8. I
need to handle these conditions better. Patches for topocolour
welcome. Source is in google code repo.

But when I compiled the error is in the below line

  QgsMapTool * mpEditTool = new
QgsMapToolAddFeature(mpMapCanvas,QgsMapToolCapture::CapturePoint);

Hi

QgsMapToolAddFeature is not part of the qgis API, therefore it is not in 
libqgiscore and libqgisgui. 
You could try to add the .cpp / .h files (and dependent ones) to your 
standalone applications or to reimplement a new maptool similarly to 
QgsMapToolAddFeature.

Regards,
Marco

Thanks a lot Hamish.
Anyone willing to carry on the work? For instance, I assume all d.* modules are not
relevant for QGIS, right?
If we can come out with a clean list, we'll do our best to implement the missing,
important modules.
All the best.

Not that it would be very difficult to implement it: anyone willing to help?

Message-ID: <4C9CD8FD.90102@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I do not understand well how this option (in the Map composer) works: in my
interpretation, it should freeze the map as it is, so one could meke whatever change
to the canvas, and add a totally different map view. In reality, is seems that the
option only prevents a layer from disappearing when removed or hidden in the canvas;
colours and symbols are updated.
I think the behaviour I described first would be more useful. Am I wrong? Am I
missing something?
All the best.

There is no such build   target so consequently  no such lib is built.

Also note that the application does not have any stable api so there would
be little sense in turning it into a library for others  to code against.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] adding graduated symbol classification algorithms
Message-ID: <AANLkTimP0Ck=p3wp5SgtxUwGRaFStGpZSpOe5RUZ214K@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Devs, attached is a diff that adds 3 new modes to the graduated
symbol renderer, including Jenks' Natural Breaks Optimisation
algorithm, a standard deviation classification algorithm, and the
'pretty' algorithm from the R statistical programming language. An
explanation of the algorithms is provided as comments in-code, and you
can also have a look here: http://www.carsonfarmer.com/?p=761 for the
initial Python version, along with a brief overview of the algorithms
etc. I'd really appreciate any comments, suggestions, or fixes, as I'm
not really a C++ programmer. I'm sure there are a few spots where
things could be sped up, especially in the Jenks algorithm. Right now
I'm using a random sample to speed things up, but I'm sure others more
familiar with C++ could find other speed improvements. I don't really
want to commit this directly, again mainly because I'm not really
confident in my C++ abilities, but if it would make it easier, I can
also add the patch as an enhancement ticket?

Thanks,

Carson

BTW: if we can have a well-thought list, before the upcoming hackfest[0], we'll do
our best to implement the suggestions.
BTW2: if any grass-dev or grass power user would like to join us at the hackfest,
they'll be most useful, and this can result in a greatly improved GRASS toolbox.
All the best.

Hi

As Marco has explained in a separate thread, you need to copy both .h and
.cpp files and compile the functionality you need directly into your app.

In case I don't leave Wroclaw before the hackfest, I'll be there for a

Hi Paulo:
Two questions about the table - Do you think it's necessary/desirable to 
have a separate column for each release of QGIS?
How about color coding the rows like the DebianGIS "thermometer". (If 
this idea is acceptable, I'm willing to do the wiki formatting.)

Hi Paolo

This option keeps the visibility (on/off) of the maplayers. Main use case is to 
have an overview map where not all layers are visible. 

As the composer uses the central  QgsMapLayerRegistry, it is not easily 
possible to have a totally different set of layers as in the main canvas.


Regards,
Marco

Great idea.
So I would need to create a wiki {{template}} with, i.e.
Present
Should be added
Should be removed (is this category really necessary??)
Not relevant
Not possible

Hi Noli,

This error:
> RRuntimeError: Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : could not find
> function "lsf.str"
Means you don't have the lsf-str R function visible in your
environment, do you have the utils package loaded? Normally this
package is loaded by default? What version of R are you running?

Ok, weird that this would ever actually happen, but since it has, I'll
have to catch it...

Thanks for the report,

Hi Carson,

Thanks for responding to this error.

Here's my R logs (below) and I am using Ubuntu 10.04. What is this
"utils package".

Thanks.

Noli,

What do you get (using a freshly started R, with no packages manually
loaded), why you type something like:
lsf.str("package:base")

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS - French Ministry of Environment
Message-ID: <4C9F3C25.6030606@enoreth.net>

Hi, here is a very short resume of a QGIS party that was organized a few
days ago by the French Ministry of Environment (MEEDDM [1]) to exchange
informations on Quantum GIS, in order to determine the possibility of
its use as one of their GIS desktop tools. Most of the participants were
technical members of the ministry and its local branches, and Vincent
Picavet (OSGEO-fr treasurer) and I (OSGEO-fr/QGIS).

QGIS is being used internally for months by some of their agents or
departments in parallel with the actual official tool, which is MapInfo.
The ministry is ongoing a rationalization of their actual software base,
leading to the adoption of web gis and the study of alternative desktop
tools, namely QGIS. This ministry has already switched to OpenOffice and
changed their Access databases to PostGIS.

No decision has been taken yet but the general opinion on QGIS was
positive, the ministry's technical teams have already produced
documentation set for their internal formations and are conducting use
tests with several services. The main point was to determine if QGIS was
able to fulfill 100% of MapInfo's uses and the answer was mixed : no on
some aspects (no "font/annotation" layer type, different proportional
symbols aka #960, etc.) and far more on others (labelv2, symbology, sql,
etc.).

Several tests were also done to determine the effort needed to customize
QGIS, and two tools were developed :
- SelectPlusFr, a plugin based on Barry ROWLINGSON's SelectPlus
extending the selection tools
- OpenWOR, a plugin which allows to partly open .wor file in QGIS (I'll
post more on that later)

A decision on migrating part of the software base is still to be
discussed, but the technical team of the ministry already intends to
contribute code (aforementioned plugins at least) and would like to
provide financial support to QGIS in some way.

Patch looks OK, but I have not any proxy to test either. I can't confirm 
or falsify if it is working well.

I have changed urllib to urllib2. Seems to work without any change. If 
You can use 'environment settings' it can be easier way.
I will upload it to repository ASAP. Currently I have some problem to

  Hi,

For me, keeping the layer visilibity was the main reason we wanted the 
feature back then. We did not want a real freeze, which means we wanted 
the behavior that changes to geometry and symbology would be reflected 
in the map layouts.

I can see that for other purposes you would want a complete freeze - but 
in that case wouldn't it be more useful to just export the map to a file 
and add it to the layout?

In any way, the current behavior of the layer lock should be kept I 
think. If other types of freezing are introduced they shouldn't 
overwrite the current behavior, but add a new type of freezing/locking 
in parallel.

Just my opinion.

Thanks,
Andreas

  Hi Jean,

Thank you for this interesting information. I understand that the 
decision is still pending but that there is a positive attitude towards 
QGIS.

As far as labeling/annotation features, there had been recent 
improvements in the trunk. And there will be more. This work is funded 
from the cities of Uster and Thun in Switzerland. The recent 
improvements are around data-defined text properties (font-family, size, 
color, rotation, offsets (vertical and horizontal), etc) - basically 
porting the old data-defined settings to the new label engine.

Marco will also soon start work on manual label placement with the 
option of having different anchor points (aligned with the Swiss 
Interlis text placement). This would potentially also be useful for MEEDDM.

Are you aware that annotations also exist in newer QGIS versions? This 
was funded by the Kanton of Solothurn. I don't know if the current 
annotations satisfy your needs, but it is worth exploring. The 
annotations as they are implemented currently are stored in the project 
file, not in a separate layer. You probably want the annotation layer 
type - but I think that this will be covered by the work mentioned in 
the paragraph above. Please let us know your requirements regarding 
labeling/annotation - Marco is currently working on them, and maybe your 
requirements could be taken care of at the same time.

The Swiss QGIS users are coordinating QGIS development and sharing the 
funding efforts as well. We collaborate with the companies Sourcepole 
(Marco Hugentobler, Pirmin Kalberer) and Norbit (J?rgen Fischer). If you 
are interested, we can also do more international 
collaboration/coordination. Of course a lot of issues could be discussed 
on the mailinglists, but there could be meetings as well, maybe also at 
an upcoming Hackfest, or separate.

In my opinion, new features can be included quite fast into QGIS, if 
funding/financing can be organized. Often faster than with commercial 
software. Some coordination should be done to avoid double or triple 
efforts (same feature developed several times by different parties) and 
to maximize the benefits from the financial contributions.

Please keep us informed about the upcoming decision/plans of MEEDDM.

Andreas

Hi all.
I'm not authoritative here, but I believe we should target only current QGIS trunk.
There has not been any backporting until now, so any fix will go on trunk only.

Yes, I think a rating "crucial - important - minor" or similar would be very good to
help focusing our efforts.

Thanks a lot.

Thanks Marco for clarifying. So layers can be fixed, colors not.
I think sooner or later it will be good to have both options.
I'm going to open a ticket, if you don't mind.

ok, "Priority" column now added to the wikimedia table.
  http://grass.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS-QGIS_relevant_module_list


...oh, so the qgis wiki is really a themed Mediawiki? I make the table
in the GRASS wiki because I thought it wasn't. Feel free to move it over
to the qgis wiki-space if you think that's a more appropriate home for it.
hmmm, but then the module man-page templates links would stop working.

freezing/fixing colors is probably harder to do then just remembering
layer states. Layer states are only off/on.

For remembering colors you have to keep track of symbology changes and
keep a history of past states. Potentially any symbolization option (label
options, categorization, etc.) can be adapted later on. If those have to
be remembered for certain layouts it basically means that you have to
introduce a version control system of past symbolization states in a .qgs
project. The layout could then point to the corresponding symbology
version. Not impossible, but probably a lot of work.

On the other hand one could probably also introduce an undo/redo system
for symbology changes, just like we have for editing.

But I would expect such work to be rather complex.

Merci Jean-Roc for the report, and for the good news.
Andreas has already nicely suggested a good way to contribute to the project. I for
my part can advise not to work separately, but collaborating closely with the QGIS
core team.
The Project Steering Committee is here to help the process, if necessary and useful.
Looking forward to hear more from France.
All the best.

As far as I know, no one is working on this or has discussed it. But its
an interesting topic and it would be nice to see some real innocation
happening in QGIS.

Right - one could probably apply blur effects and similar to lines to
represent their fuzzyness - Qt4 already has some infrastructure for this
kind of thing e.g.
http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/qgraphicsdropshadoweffect.html#details 

I'm not sure about using two separate layers as you describe above - it
might be nicer to make fuzziness simply an attribute of the feature -
though I guess it doesnt cope well for the scenario where individual
segments of a feature have different fuzziness levels...

Gary will need to look at that as it is hosted on his server I think.
Macho & web folks - can we host this in our vm too?

Gary also it would probably be good to remove the 1.0 docs, or have:

1.0, 1.x (current release) and trunk

Giovanni, in the meantime you can build the docs yourself - just do:

sudo apt-get install doxygen
cd <qgis source tree>
doxygen

Docs will be placed under api_doc/

Dear Tim

In fact, the fuzziness attribute has to be somehow 'attached' to segments.
In the use cases I know often there are some segments along the
boundary which are not fuzzy but crisp on purpose.
An example might be where a street touches the fuzzy feature.
So since segments of a polygon can't be accessed from 'outside' one
solution might be to have a "shadow" layer which consists of
polylines.

=> Do you have another idea on how to implement such "line segment
atttributes" in QGIS?

Yours, S.

Hi,

Adding to the discussion: is there a central resource where people could
see on what features/enhancements/bugs developers currently work on?

It would be useful if an organization that is missing a certain feature
could check against such a resource and then contact other interested
parties and the developer of the feature to see if the interests of all
parties can be addressed.

If there is such a resource, could you please point me towards it, if not,
could we create one? Maybe it could be an extract of trac, where one could
see which bugs/features/enhancement are currently active?

I would vote against creating another resource (difficult to maintain).
IMHO, it is better working towards maintaining the trac, e.g. a ticket which is
accepted should mean the dev is currently working on it.
So if someone needs a feature, he can open a ticket, and he knows nobody is working
on it unless a dev accepts it.
I periodically do my efforts in keeping the trac queue clean, and I often find old
garbage here and there.
All the best.

Quite nice!
A few issues (on r14295):
- bar chart does not seem to work
- while moving over the chert, the cursor becomes a cross, but this does not seem to
be related to any additional option
- it would be good to have an option to save the chart.
Thanks Tim!
All the best.

Hi,

I am totally fine with using trac for this purpose. However, at the
beginning I had a hard time for using it. I just recently discovered that
there is a "Custom query" feature - it is a bit hidden.

Can I also save a custom query for easier use later on? According to
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/wiki/TracQuery it is not, but there is a
wiki-like notation for embedding in the Wiki.

I probably should have invested some more time for using trac early one.
Would have made my life easier ...

Thanks,
Andreas

True!I'm using trac for lots of things, other than sw development, it's so convenient!

Message-ID: <4CA095A9.5090108@duif.net>


Hi Devs,

looking at: http://doc.qgis.org/stable/classQgsMapCanvas.html
is my conclusion ok that I cannot change the size of the mapcanvas from 
within a python plugin / programmatically?

For the htmlimagemaplugin there is a feature request to be able to 
determine the exact size of the output map image.

Another use-case is when I needed to have an image of a map in an exact 
size to be used in some html/css page.

Till now I tried to resize the window in such a way combined with saving 
the map as an image to determine the right size (pixelperfect :-) )

Am I missing something here (eg can I use the qt-parent of mapcanvast or 
so?) or should I file a feature request?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all.
Now (r14297) I only see the chart, no options available. Is this meant to be zen[0]? ;)
On the other hand, the cross seems to be gone (which is good).
All the best.

Hi Andreas,

I'm following trunk (svn junkie) so during this meeting I've shown up 
the label properties panel and it was appreciated but this is not the 
excepted functionnality. These "annotations" are text objects and do not 
derivate from an attribute, the user can manualy modify their font size, 
their oritentation, etc. It is a feature available in MapInfo (ArcGIS 
too) and users are expecting it. This isn't the best way to label a map 
but even with the huge improvements brough by PAL/labelv2 (even if it 
isn't ready to replace the old yet), manual editing is often required to 
get a correct output.

The development done by the MEEDDM was a way for some technical persons 
to get their hands into the PyQGIS API and a mean to know how easy it 
would be to make these changes. They want a deskop GIS that can evolve 
and can be modified, both things MapInfo isn't. Further works will be 
coordinated with the community as there is a real will to mutualize the 
work. If everything goes well, you will soon see new names on this list.

For notice, at first they estimated the time needed for first OpenWOR 
version to 30 days, it turned out that 7 days were enough...

Regards,
Jean Roc

Hi,

I just like post this idea and link.

Pie Chart thematics to display multiple types of data [1]

This involves Unpivot and Pivot data.

http://testdrive.mapinfo.com/TechSupp/MIProd.nsf/2fa3e3416d06d61d85257125006b2533/fdae38d1b4e6fe2305256b8a0054a937?OpenDocument

It might be useful to develop this plugin in Qgis.

I think MapInfo has good thematic mapping features

Could you do this now in Qgis?

now I see what you want: manual editing of text labels, including 
position, rotation, anchor points (vertical/horizontal alignment), text 
style attributes, etc.

The infrastructure is there with the new label engine, but the manual 
editing part is not. But you can expect this manual editing 
functionality rather soon. Marco Hugentobler is currently working on it.

  Hi Patrice,

Unless there is a french QGIS community member (or support company) is 
working on it, it is unlikely. If noone is working on it, it would be 
good if the french QGIS community could collaborate and come up either 
with the developer resources or funding and pay a developer (or QGIS 
support company) to implement it.

In Switzerland we also have a country specific format used for all sorts 
of official data, called Interlis. The Kanton of Solothurn paid for the 
development and the plugin is available for all Swiss QGIS users - which 
is nice.

Hi Jean,
 
Just for your information the development/trunk version of QGIS now has many more selection tools build in. With the exception of select by diameter, the excellent tools from SelectPlus are now covered with these new selection tools.
 
I would urge you to look at these tools and see if they cover the enhancements you require with SelectPlusFr.

Cheers,
Jeremy

Message-ID: <4CA1896B.6050709@jena.de>

Dear all,

can anybody explain the use of the QgsFeature's changeAttribute() function?
this is my code:

newFeature = QgsFeature()
newGeom = #some geometry-creating function here
newFeature.setGeometry( newGeom )
myLayer.addFeatures( [ newFeature ] )
myLayer.setModified()
newValue = "a string"
myIdx = myLayer.fieldNameIndex( 'myfield' )
newFeature.changeAttribute( myIdx, newValue )
   #does not change the field value to new value :-(

what is the second argument of changeAttribute supposed to be?

regards

Bernhard

 Also there are some bugs in my SelectPlus plugin concerning
projections that I've never had time to fix properly. I may well stop
distributing it once I've had a play with the new selection tools.

 Of course the SelectPlus license doesn't stop anyone keeping it,
taking it and making it better!

Could like us more about this OpenWOR? I guess it is about having your
mapinfo workspace migrate to qgis project, right? Is this is qgis
plugin? Where you can get it?

Yes its super zen  :-) - I had a good think about the options on that
panel and also from showing them on training courses and decided they
were pretty useless / meaningless for the average user so I have
stripped them out. Hopefully we can do more of this elsewhere in QGIS
to get rid of feature bloat. Biggest remaining issue with that chart
(which is generated using the underlying gdal histogram functions) is
that the x axis is pretty meaningless (its actually showing the number
of histogram bins at the moment).

I really like the new functionality your patch adds - I even wrote a
little blog post about it :-) [1] The code works fine my only comment
regarding the c++ implementation is that it doesn't follow our coding
style guidelines. See the CODING document in the root of your source
tree for details. e.g variable names should be camelCased, and so on.
If you resolve those, issues I would be most happy to see your work
added to trunk.

Regards

Tim

Most of this functionality is already available via the digram overlay
plugin (c++ plugin). Just go into the plugin manager and enable it.

Hi Luca,

thank you for your reply, which made me trying further, much 
appreciated. Your code works perfect with an existing feature (will use 
it some other place), however my new feature has no id assigned!

For those interested I elaborated the following:

newFeat = QgsFeature()
newGeom = # some magic :-)
newFeat.setGeometry( newGeom )

# important: create attributes at this point with null values...
for att in layer.pendingAllAttributesList():
     newFeat.addAttribute( att, QVariant() )

# ...in order to change attribute's value...
newFeat.changeAttribute( idx, 'string' )

# ...before adding feature to the layer
if layer.addFeatures( [ newFeat ] ):
     layer.setModified()

when a feature is added to the layer a copy of it is added, thus the 
feature is not accessible any more before the layer's changes are 
commited (because the new feature has no id)

Bernhard

Thanks Carson.

However, the diagram overlay plugin (c++ plugin) is not working in
Qgis 1.5.0.2 Ubuntu 10.04. I could not find the menu and icon. I
disabled the all the plugins and check / enable only diagram overlay
plugin yet nothing is displayed in the menu, and no icon also appeared
in the toolbar.

Displacement plugin is also not working - no icon and menu.

BTW, are we suppose to see any icons and menu items for these 2
plugins? If not, then please provide any instruction where they are?

the diagram overlay shows as option in the vector properties, the point
displacement show as option in vector symbology.

I see. Are you aware of the (somewhat related, I guess) issue:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1380
(see also my note on pyramids).
I still think it would be good to have the option to copy or save the chart: would it
be difficult to do?
All the best.

Hi Jeremy,

just to be clear I'm not the author of these plugin. All these 
informations have been given to the concerned persons during the meeting 
but as pointed before the main aim was to get familiar if the API. 
However there is some features of their plugin that aren't included in 
the svn (possibility to invert selection, activate/desactivate topology, 
etc.).

These plugins are GPL and the authors willing to contribute, as I said 
they'll suscribe to this list.

Hi developers

There is a new plugin available for synchronising an offline spatialite table 
with a master datasource (e.g. PostGIS or WFS-T). It was developed by Mathias 
Walker.

I wrote a little blog article about it:
http://www.sourcepole.ch/2010/9/29/offline-editing-plugin-for-qgis

It would be nice to add this plugin to qgis svn. What do you think about it?


Regards,
Marco

Hi,

I didn't test it yet - but it sounds like a very useful plugin to me.
Whenever people collect data in the field and then want to sync it with
the master db.

+1 for including it in the SVN.

Hello everyone!

 

I've been struggling with this for quite some time now, but I can't seem to
find the proper solution.  We need to set the projection definition to
provided datasets, and have, up to now, been doing it by using our own
projection dialog. We now want to change our plugin to use the, already
implemented, QGIS projection dialog.

So my question is as follows:  

Is there a way to convert a projection definition such as those returned by
the QGIS projection dialog 
eg:
   +proj=utm +zone=36 +south +a=6378249.144808011 +b=6356514.966204134
+units=m +no_defs

to the extended form such as the following:


   PROJCS["UTM Zone 36, Southern Hemisphere",GEOGCS["Unknown datum based
upon the Clarke 1880 ellipsoid",DATUM["Not specified (based on Clarke 1880
spheroid)",SPHEROID["Clarke
1880",6378249.144808011,293.4663076556303,AUTHORITY["EPSG","7034"]]],PRIMEM[
"Greenwich",0],UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mer
cator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",33],P
ARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER[
"false_northing",10000000],UNIT["Meter",1]]

 

The reason for this is that the GDAL functions for setting the projection
definition, only accepts the extended form.  If this is already implemented
in a QGIS or other class that you know of, I would greatly appreciate it.
(I don't think I am qualified enough to attempt doing it myself. J )

Thank you for your time and efforts!

Hi Francois,

If you are in Python, you could use GDAL with something like the following:

import osr
...
theProj4Str = "+proj=utm +zone=36 +south +a=6378249.144808011
+b=6356514.966204134 +units=m +no_defs"
outSr = osr.SpatialReference()
outSr.ImportFromProj4(theProj4Str)
outWkt = outSr.ExportToWkt()

and use outWkt as the 'dst_wtk' parameter for raster creation.

HTH,
Benoit

I think this is probably what you're looking for:

crs = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem ()
crs.createFromProj4(theProj4Str)
print crs.toWkt()

no need to use additional libraries or anything!

Thanks Carson.

Power resides with knowledge... I was sure there was a QGIS equivalent!

If so, why not including it in main source code, and possibly drop quickprint?
All the best.

Hi
Yes I am planning to get rid of it and make various other core Plugin
related changes at the hackfest.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsMapCanvas - Special zoom
Message-ID: <4CA4E169.8010504@gmail.com>

  Hello,

Is there any trick I can use to zoom into a canvas with a specific 
centre AND a specific scale.
I have 2 map canvases, and I want to zoom into the same position and 
scale on both canvases at the same time: If i zoom into canvas1 at 
location (x,y) with factor 0.87, canvas2 should also zoom in with 
factor0.87 at position (x,y).

What I currently do is:
1. When the user zooms on one canvas (zoomLastStatusChanged signal), the 
signal is caught and the continues to step 2
2. Zoomin -> QgsMapCanvas provides 2 functions that can be used: 
zoomWithCenter and zoomScale

The problem is that there is not a function that can zoom into a certain 
point WITH a certain scale.
If zoomScale is used and one image is moved/paned individual, the 
zooming will have the same scale, but with different locations.
Hence if I zoom into one point, both canvases should the same location 
(zoomed in with the same amount)

If zoomWithCenter is used a fixed factor will be used to zoom in. Hence, 
if I zoom in on canvas1 with a factor different to 1, canvas2 will be 
zoomed into the correct location, but with a factor of 1 and not the 
factor of canvas1.

Does anyone have a solution to this problem? And is it even possible?

Thanks
Christoph

Hi,

not sure if it's the same, but the Aaron Racicot's MirrorMap plugin does
something similar. Have a look at it:
