While the impact of this decision is still very minor for us right now,
as you say it is a very good illustration on how putting us in a vendor
lock-in situation is bad.

I would say that it is not too late to re-work on a self-hosted GitLab
instance, which would be more future-proof. That would need a great deal
of efforts though, and would require specific funding for the
forthcoming non-funny tasks.

At Oslandia, we would be willing to help, if it is the path chosen by
the community.

A Git mirror would be great of course, but does not solve the full problem.

And personally, this kind of attack against free information and
knowledge is a concern, for sure.

Best regards,
Vincent

Hi,

Thanks for bringing up this discussion.

My personal opinion is that we should be worried by such development and 
should have a plan B for hosting our code.

We certainly want QGIS and its source code to be available world wide, 
not just to parts of the world at the mercy of some governments and 
corporations.

But the decision to move away from github should be discussed and voted 
on by the core devs and voting members because apparently it has a lot 
of implications and a lot of work went into the CI integration 
(according to some devs).

We already have 10k € in the 2019 budget for github to gitlab (hosted or 
self hosted?) migration. This money would already be available this 
year, but first we need to have a plan and the support of the developer 
community to do this step. If this isn't enough, we can have additional 
budget in 2020.

Greetings,

Andreas

Hi Nyall,
sorry for the iface issue my bad. When I used it was to attempt to load the
layer after the creation of the vector layer.

1 lesson learn - Hey iface stay away from processing :P

Thank you for your time this small fix is now working.

Best regards.

Hi,
I have just installed QGIS 3.8.1 in my MacBook using the official installer.
The python in QGIS is not able to access the packages which are installed
in the local python user directory.

How can install the packages in the python bundled with QGIS 3.8.1?

I would suspect that switching to gitlab would not be sufficient as it is
still with in the USA and would be subject to the same restrictions. Also
if self-hosting we will need to make sure it outside the USA.

There is also a suggestion that China could be added to the list of
"banned" countries too.

Yes - our self-hosted infrastructure is in Germany.

We are aware that gitlab is also hosted in the US.

However, a self-hosted version of gitlab in our current infrastructure 
adds a significant additional burden. That's why we need to discuss it 
first, reach consensus and allocate resources for maintenance.

As to China: this is kind of a "black hole" for us. China (and probably 
also North Korea) are some of the very few countries where we have 
almost no feedback on usage, have almost no income of donations and 
sponsorships, etc. My assumption is that in China they just pirate ESRI 
software, or they have some alternative GIS they programmed themselves.

Hi

> I'm not writing this email because I have a proposal, 

In addition to Nyall’s reply, can I ask what the actual proposal you have is? Hint: proposals like ‘I would like to donate 10 million USD to support LTRs and fix every known bug’ would be warmly accepted. But seriously if you have a good proposal to improve things of course we would love to hear it.

Regards

Tim

just to dissolve doubts: the work and efforts in bug fixing (LTR and not
LTR) is awesome. Kudos to QGIS and every one that provides financial
support on this and kudos to all the devs.

Let me just try to explain it better.

>From an user point of view having tons of new feature every 4 months is
incredible: it makes the user happy, more curious and conscious that the
QGIS community is very active.

>From another user point of view having some daily tools broken in the
LTR release makes me think on the global efforts in the QGIS community:
I have then to downgrade to another version or wait for the fix (even if
users should not wait but be part of the community, but that's another
thing). And maybe as user I would prefer to have the "same" tools but in
a safer way (software cannot be bugless of course.

Of course bugfixing is not fun for nobody and making new stuff is 10000
times better.

So just to be even more clear: I don't have a proposal (ping @Tim ;) )
and I think the bug situation is not bad at all (regression or not
regression) and really think the efforts and work behind the scenes is
incredible.

Just my 2 cents (after an unlucky workflow where I hit different bugs).

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Message-ID: <CAJOp35mLzgt0f-tx8AZavRRqC9og1YsgqnaL-EkUXMai2vQgMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

SAGA has released a 7.3 version at the end of june, and I intend to keep a
stable branch based on this release, and drop support of the old branch
(which was not maintained well).
I am aware of the next-gen processing plugin at
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/processing_saga_nextgen/ which now targets
7.2, but wonder if we should not consider switching to this version also in
the normal processing plugin.

I'll be at FOSS4G later this month, so perhaps this is a good time to
implement/discuss some of these changes?

Kind regards,
Johan

This is great news, thank you so much for this! It will definitely
make things much easier for users.

What I'm thinking is that we should make the core plugin handle both
2.3 and 7,3, as it's likely to be some time before 7.3 is available on
all target platforms. The next_gen plugin might be a good starting
point, but to my knowledge it hasn't been widely tested and I would
expect there's many algorithms in it which don't work (since they
haven't been updated from the 2.3 definitions)... So there's quite a
bit of work for someone to do on the QGIS side.

This would be a great task for a motivated, knowledgeable SAGA
processing user to contribute to QGIS. Any volunteers?

Right -- but again, I see no concrete issues here. We have one issue
which isn't a regression (postgis rasters) and is instead a feature
request, and one regression which was caused by an important fix
(broken grass for Windows non-English users), not a feature! (And one
unknown issue cos you pasted the wrong link ;)

Also - just to point out - Alessandro implemented the feature request
overnight. Big kudos to him -- we finally have a stable way of using
PostGIS rasters in QGIS.*

Nyall

* Ironically enough, this is a feature.

Message-ID: <CAB28AshLKt9hVdcYQcQdXi5_w0jj3RZ4NE7Q_ZZW-PsXWNNWQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

This is something which has been on my mind a lot lately. Whenever a
question comes up about regressions or stability, the argument is
often thrown around that developers are writing "fun new features, not
fixes".

I personally think this argument is a red herring. At best, it's a
misleading argument. At worst, it's side-tracking difficult and
important discussions with a point which has no corroborating
evidence, and offending contributors to the project.

Has anyone actually tested this argument? My gut feeling is that it
would not hold up to any form of statistical testing in any way, and
that the mutually exclusive choice between writing a feature or a fix
NEVER comes up in reality.

Can we PLEASE drop this argument, at least until someone does a survey
targeting the developers behind feature PRs, e.g.

"
If you weren't spending time writing this feature, would you have instead:

[ ] Just done my original task using alternative software or lengthy
workarounds instead, knowing that I'll have to repeat those
workarounds in future tasks

[ ] Ignored the issues with my mapping product caused by the missing
feature and supplied it to clients as is

[ ] Gone to bed early, and got a good night's sleep

[ ] Gone for a hike in the mountains, re-invigorating my soul with the
beauty of nature

[ ] Thought about going for a hike, but spent the time scrolling
endlessly through Twitter and feeling guilty and lazy

[ ] I was being paid to work on this feature only, and would not have
been contributing to the project in any alternative way instead

[ ] I had a mutually exclusive choice between writing this feature or
fixing bugs, and I explicitly choose to write a feature instead
because it was more enjoyable.
"

Until we have evidence that this argument is valid, I think it's
actually causing much more harm to the community than good. (It can
easily be mis-interpreted as "you wasted your time volunteering this
contribution, you should have fixed #xyz instead.")

Thanks for the consideration!
Nyall

Thanks, But if I want to share my plugin with other users who are using
this new installer, there should be some way to install libraries  by the

Hi all.
I'm often unhappy when I'm right. Although the practical impact this time is low, I would take this as a clear signal (after the loomio move, and I expect more) that we have to change our strategy, keeping our infrastructure as simple as possible and avoiding wherever possible to rely on proprietary, non free, stuff.
Cheers.

Hi all,
I understand the frustration from both sides. Roughly, our users mostly demand more stability, whereas customers mostly pay for new features. We have balanced this using QGIS.ORG budget, by having more tests, but obviously we can't cover all. I'm pretty sure over time things will keep on improving.
What is new to me is the growing tension.  I think we can and should do something to recover our friendly environment.
All the best.

Same situation as with grass here:

- A first issue was reported

- The fix for the first issue had unintended and unlucky side effects (a 
risk that comes with every bugfix/change unfortunately)

- Followup problem was reported

- Patch was supplied within some days after reporting the regression

Hello list,

Some more thoughts on this topic, because it comes up repeatedly.

One the first principles of every of our developers is to try to avoid 
regressions. Whenever a QGIS developer writes code or reviews code, 
there is this process in the back of the head going on thinking "could 
this cause side effects?". Most of the times we are quite efficient in 
detecting side effects and if in doubt running some tests (manually or 
by adding unit tests) to check and adjust if required. This is what 
makes QGIS a rock solid piece of software (are you in doubt? Take QGIS 
2.0 and QGIS 3.4 and perform some common GIS tasks). It's pretty awesome 
actually!

Once in a while though, this process fails to detect a risk or 
implication or use case of which "the developer" was not aware [1]. 
Unfortunately we are not able to completely avoid this situation.

We could of course

   a) Throw more review power to it. If we have the resources to 
download, build and run every pull request, that will help to catch some 
additional issues.

   b) Perform more real world testing. The more testing is done on 
nightly builds, the quicker the turnaround to detect issues.

   c) Combined with b) have more continuous developer power for 
bugfixing (not only before a release)

   d) Stop shipping bugfixes (hint: joke, that makes the LTR concept 
pointless and anyone can do that today already by sticking to the .0 
patch release ;) )


As you also, Matteo, I am not able to offer a solution (unfortunately). 
So this is mostly food for thoughts.

Any initiative or strategic decisions to improve a), b) and c) is very 
welcome.


At the same time, let's not obstruct our view too much by outliers. In 
my opinion we are doing very well with what we have available and are 
overall heading in a good direction!


Let's rock on and make QGIS even better

Matthias

Matthias, you're raising a good point on the 2.0 vs 3.4 (I'd argue 2.18 vs
3.4 too). Sometimes we tend to get so "passionate" about specific bugs that
impact our own workflows that we end up not seeing the forest for the
trees. 3.4 LTS is overall a much, much more solid product than 2.18 was and
our ever growing number of test cases insure this positive trend can be
maintained.

and here is the resulting image: 

Note the white borders on the top and on the right of the image. 

The other interesting thing: despite the fact that I asked for an image
with 76x38 px in size, I get an image with 79x51 in size. If I cut out
the "yellow" part I roughly end up at 75x38 px. 

Any idea what parameter could help to get rid of the white margins on
top and right? 

Thank you very much for your help!

Hi, 

Sorry about the missing GetLegendGraphics image result. Here it should
be visible (hopefully): 

Thanks,

Hi,

Thanks for bringing this up Nyall.


 From my side, this survey would have had ticks in every of the 
available options over time.


And I'd have mentioned in the "feedback" part of the survey that some 
relevant information to answer the core question was missing because the 
question only targets feature pull requests:

- [ ] I spent the time to fix this bug instead of writing a new feature 
because the task was well defined and a reachable goal.

- [ ] I did not open a pull request because while the feature was 
actually working for me, the quality was not deemed high enough to be 
acceptable, so it's still rotting somewhere in my repository in a 
meanwhile unmergeable state.

- [ ] While I worked on a feature I noticed a bug, so I fixed and 
backported it to LTR. The next day someone showed me a workflow and I 
realized that 50% of the time was spent to work around the bug.

- [ ] It would have been easier to write a band aid for a bug, but 
instead I decided to spend the time to write this feature which also 
fixes the bug, but does so properly.

- [ ] Others (like Skiing, spending time on discussions on open source 
and sustainability, writing grant proposals, bug triaging, answering 
questions on gis.se, reviewing pull requests). Write in the comment 
section below.

nobody should ever ever judge how a volunteering contribution should be
made: everybody can/should and must focus on what is the most important
task to work on.

of course this is far far far away from what I have in mind and I
understand what you mean when you say that the not knowing the whole
community-effort could lead to some misinterpretation.

Cheers

a good comparison is also Processing frawoek in 2.x and 3.x, steps made
are impressive.

yes we are doing well QGIS :) I just would have raised a topic but I
understand that it is super easy to such a delicate topic to be
misinterpreted.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GetLegendGraphics: image of single category

Just an update: 

If I use a rule name instead of the SLD, it works fine without the
margins, with the exact same parameters. 

So it seems to be a bug when an SLD is provided, that the dimensions of
the square are broken. 

Here a request without an SLD but with a rule parameter: 

http://localhost:8083/qgis/oereb-wms-gpkg?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetLegendGraphic&LAYERS=ch.so.arp.nutzungsplanung.grundnutzung&FORMAT=image/png&SYMBOLWIDTH=20&SYMBOLHEIGHT=10&WIDTH=76&HEIGHT=38&LAYERTITLE=FALSE&RULELABEL=FALSE&DPI=96&%20LAYERTITLE=FALSE&RULELABEL=FALSE&BOXSPACE=0&ICONLABELSPACE=0&LAYERTITLESPACE=0&SYMBOLSPACE=0&LAYERSPACE=0&RULE=Wohnzone%202%20G


This request works fine, but the very same request with an SLD instead
of a RULE fails.

Hi Nyall and Johan,

Alexander Bruy had updated his SAGA provider for Processing to SAGA 7.3.0
already, so it is the best candidate to be merged to core! :)

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement: Week 10 Report
Message-ID: <CAEh5jtH2bw4jPxqs3oMRvU2CzNyEtzSuWp2f6neRH8fv2KWA3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

Here is my 10th-week report for my GSoC Project[4]. You can also check the
project wiki page [2]. Comments and suggestions are welcome :)

GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement Week 10 Report

*Period*: 30 July 2019 - 4 August 2019

*Report*
1. What did I complete this week?
   - Adding QgsSymbolButton for the UI (thanks to Nyall for the help)
   - Implementing billboard from the user input. It's still in progress.
Only work once, perhaps missing signal handling. Currently debugging it.
2. What am I going to achieve for next week?
   - Solve using a symbol from QgsSymbolButton
3. Is there any blocking issue?
   - N/A
4. Code
   - Branch for billboard feature [1]
   - Repo for QT C++ billboard [3]
5. Misc
   - This week I was quite busy with my last week of the block course and
got sick that needed me to have some bed rest. I couldn't manage to work on
the project like previous weeks. Fortunately, the class is finished, now I
can focus again on the project.

Actually - jokes aside - this does raise a good question.

We've never (as far as i know) formally defined about what the goal of
the LTR is. Is it:
1. a version of QGIS with every bug fix possible backported
or
2. a version of QGIS with only absolutely critical bugfixes
backported, such as security risks or data corruption bugs

(or somewhere between the two)

Currently, it's very much 1. We see everything backported from crash
fixes to string updates to performance optimisations to backported
API. Maybe this is the problem. Maybe we should only be accepting
absolutely mission critical bug fixes, and the expectation is to see
only 1 or 2 commits between LTR patch release versions. Reality is
that every bug fix, regardless of how trivial it seems, brings with it
the increased chances of regressions into the stable LTR release...

Possibly this is a question we need to raise with our voting panel or
user communities, in order to work out exactly what people's desires
from the LTR are.

Oh gosh - yes, this one. I've some 100+ rotting features/bug fixes
sitting in git branches in various states. Some because the result
didn't turn out as useful as I first thought, some because the funding
died before the work was finished, some because what I first thought
was going to be an easy fix turned out to be insanely complicated...
This one hits home too hard!

and now we need another category:

[ ] I opened this PR only because I had a rotting branch sitting in
git and my internal sense of completion-ism wouldn't allow me to rest
until this was fixed and merged

;)

Yep, I'll be ticking this one too...

Hi,

so if I understand correctly, we need to hold it until GRASS is compatible
with PROJ6 or should we switch to proj6 nevertheless for mac packages?

Thanks, Peter

That's a very good question.

While there's no binary crystal clear categorization possible anyway, I 
realize that we tend toward 1. if it's a fixes affecting 
(experienced/sponsored/implemented by) ourselves and 2. for any other 
fix. Which introduces a bias that can cause tension.

So I agree that:

IF the concerns with the current (1.) approach are too high, the 
decision for 2. is better taken as a community and made official so it 
can be communicated easier to our clients and users.

(And then even with the decision taken, the situation will be tricky. At 
the time a client reports a bug and funding is available, it almost 
always looks like a trivial fix and it's easy to promise a backport 
"what could potentially go wrong?". Whereas the question about the 
categorization of a bugfix mostly appears in retrospective when it turns 
out something has gone wrong and the situation is already difficult.)

thanks, very important indeed. I assumed we decide for 1.
In fact, experience showed that it is preferable to be more
conservative, and only include fixes with very low chances of
regressions. I don't see a way to decide other than relying on the
developer's assessment. The only (costly) improvement I'd see is having
another independent core dev to check any bugfix before accepting it.
Cheers.

As already said, I think this is a cartographic issue that can get more benefits by a better GIS approach. Label positioning is not "substantial" but can exploit proper data.

Looking to further developments, I think there is not a "best" algorithm, but that it's useful to keep alternatives. I doubt the algorithms could really work well without an interface that can reach useful data, but

Ok, we've hit a stalemate then. I was hoping to drop the additional
algorithms to allow some desirable new features like avoiding
duplicate text labels within xxx mm of others (e.g. avoiding too many
labels for dual-carriage highways), and use that some logic to start
implementing things like automatically abbreviated label text when the
full text cannot be placed. But, if we keep all the existing
algorithms, it basically means this logic has to be written multiple
times. Ouch!

> I also think that keeping them available without any special interface could keep them in a place that is not really influenced by the frequent enhancements of QGIS.

Sounds great in theory, but the labeling code structure and logic
doesn't work that allow that.

I'd be +1 for removal. I know about the setting, don't understand the
algorithmic differences, have tried them in the past, didn't see meaningful
differences in the results.

+1 for the removal too. Never could explain the difference. Playing with
number of candidates is a lot more useful than changing the algorithm.

Hi Nyall

"Ok, we've hit a stalemate then. I was hoping to drop the additional
algorithms..." please remove. Try and error without a good statistic or
collection of maps where these options can do the difference IMHO is not
strong enough respect cleaning code and void bug fixing.

Hi

I don't think there has been a strong enough argument to keep the extra bloat.....and the potential goodies you hint at coming if they are removed have a broader benefit to all users over some hidden features that nobody understands.

As already said, I think this is a cartographic issue that can get more benefits by a better GIS approach. Label positioning is not "substantial" but can exploit proper data.

+1 for removal. Never understood the differences in details.

Latest Gitea release (1.9.0) introduced support for also migrating
issues/pull-requests/labels/milestone/wiki/releases from a github
project. I'd be happy to try that out if anyone can give me
credentials to hit the API to do so (drop me a note).

Release announcement: https://blog.gitea.io/2019/07/gitea-1.9.0-is-released/
Open platform running that version: https://gitea.com (I already
created a QGIS organization there, ping me if you want permissions)

In which particular aspect are you right?

Loomio is FOSS and we benefited from free hosting. We could have hosted it ourselves but we chose to not divert our minimal free time to managing more infrastructure. I think it is normal in life that things change and we need to adapt as they do, really it isn’t a train smash IMHO.

GitHub impact is more conceptual than actual as has been shown in this thread. So sure, lets have a plan B in place, that was always the long game plan for our code etc. But lets do take our time and do it right and in a considered way. We reached agreement in A Coruna to use GitHub for issue tracking and I don’t think it is constructive to turn around a few months later and try to roll back on what has been years of painful and protracted community negotiations and planning to get to where we are now.  IMHO moving to GitHub issues has been a great improvement for the project - and thanks again especially to Jorge and friends who did all the heavy lifting!

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <CAFkojsbxjFBdnQ1M6pG4k5N9h5iakPzMxRfvd2YpcOX5U0qKXQ@mail.gmail.com>

I would just like to draw your attention to issue 30162
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/31062.

I would appreciate any comments on what people with more experience than I
do think about my two different ideas to fix this bug. It has clearly been
an issue in the past as there are issues referencing the same error message
which were closed through being stale rather than a commit to fix.

Another option is to make people set an environment variable to load the
files properly, but this seems a very sub-optimal solution.

Let me know if anything is unclear.

Thanks

Stephen

So sure, lets have a plan B in place, that was always the long game plan for our code etc. But lets do take our time and do it right and in a considered way. We reached agreement in A Coruna to use GitHub for issue tracking and I don’t think it is constructive to turn around a few months later and try to roll back on what has been years of painful and protracted community negotiations and planning to get to where we are now.  IMHO moving to GitHub issues has been a great improvement for the project - and thanks again especially to Jorge and friends who did all the heavy lifting!

I agree. But I think what Sandro was proposing was just a read-only
mirror of the issues on gitea. Which I'd be totally in favor of.

Sandro - can you confirm that osgeo infrastructure isn't subject to
the same trade restrictions as github and gitlab.com?

My understanding is that it WOULD be, given that osgeo is a US based
organisation. And if so, osgeo isn't a solution here, and we need
something based in a less early-19th-century region of the world.

/me is googling for cloud hosting services in North Korea :-P

Sandro's comments about migrating issues to gitea make me think he has more in mind than a simple mirror of the code….

If we want a mirror surely it is easier to simply have a small hetzner server running a public read only git repo? No objection from me to have mirrors btw. Also isn’t this something we can just leave up to interested community members to work on? Nobody is complaining and it doesn’t seem useful to spend time and effort on something nobody is asking for.

“This” = host a simple Git mirror (+1 from me if he is, and our disenfranchised nation friends can access it)?
Or
“This” = full migration of GitHub issues to gitea (-1 from me unless we have a very clear understanding of what we will land up with at the end of the process and there is full community buy-in)?

I guess I probably am over-interpreting this paragraph from Sandro:

"Latest Gitea release (1.9.0) introduced support for also migrating
issues/pull-requests/labels/milestone/wiki/releases from a github
project. I'd be happy to try that out if anyone can give me
credentials to hit the API to do so (drop me a note).”

Sandro: sure we can set you up with credentials if you just want to test it out and show us what it looks like….

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Filtering features in a layer by a report group
Message-ID: <83867EEA-26DB-4F8E-B85A-D3E14E4D7F27@kartoza.com>

Hi All

I am trying to create a section in my report (not layout) which iterates over my plant types lookup table and applies a filter to my vegetation points layer based on the plant type ID.

Ideally I should set my filter of my vegetation layer based on the atlas feature id like this:  "plant_type_id" = attribute(@atlas_feature,id)

Instead I tried to make a rule using the same above expression so that symbols are blank for non matching plant features.

However in my report group, ‘Controlled by report’ is greyed out for my map and so when rendering the report the map comes out as a single blank copy instead of one per plant type. 

I suspect this is because report wants to have geometries to zoom to for each record. Other than adding a fake geometry column to my plant type lookup table, is there any way to get reporting to control my map by report when the reporting layer is a non-spatial table?


Side note: QGIS layer filtering is a "poor relation” it is one of the few places in QGIS where a non standard expression editor is used. The other major one was the raster calculator but now at least we have the raster calculator processing algorithm.

BTW using 3.8 on macOS here.


Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Hi

Sorry small correction:

> Ideally I should set my filter of my vegetation layer based on the atlas feature id like this:  "plant_type_id" = attribute(@atlas_feature,id)

Should have read:

"plant_type_id" = @atlas_feature,id

I added a fake point geom to my lookup table and it lets me control map by report now, though still trying to figure out how to get the atlas current feature in my symbology rule.

Regards

Tim

You shouldn't need that check box -- that's only used when you want
the map extent to center on the report feature. But, if I'm
interpreting your request correctly, you want a fixed map view but
iterating through different sets of visible features only? If this is
the case it should work fine regardless of the "controlled by report"
setting.

>

Only if you want the map extent to vary page-by-page. For fixed extent
maps using geometry-less tables is fine.

> Side note: QGIS layer filtering is a "poor relation” it is one of the few places in QGIS where a non standard expression editor is used.

That's because it's always done on the provider side, so the filter
syntax varies by backend, and can't use all the nice QGIS-only stuff
like variables.

To empathize this even more, let's remember that it is _not_ github, it
is trade sanctions by the US, so it is more a question of where we host,

I see two "technical" and one economical issues here.

- there is a sort of "regression obsession", IMO bugs are bugs, and they
should ideally be fixed whenever possible (also see Jürgen's answer on
another tread [1])

- assessing a "low chance of regression" is a gray area and as Nyall
said before "...every bug fix, regardless of how trivial it seems,
brings with it the increased chances of regressions into the stable LTR
release..."

- on the economical point of view,  limiting the bugs that can be fixed
in an LTR will make it very difficult to actually get larger users to
pay for bug-fixing, they are the target group for the LTR and slowly
they are understanding that fixing bugs needs resources. To me limiting
the amount of bugs that can be fixed in an LTR would be a very unwise
move since it would also reduce the number of bugs that get fixed in non
LTR releases.

I just want to test this new feature of Gitea.
OSGeo isn't running a recent-enough version to have this, but
gitea.com is. I didn't verify, but following the "hosted by"

Ok cool - pop us a note telling me what you need when you are ready to test and I or Marco B can help.

Ok but is there a way to access the equivalent of @atlas_feature_id in my style rules when running the report so I can hide vegetation points that don’t match the plant name I am iterating over?

OK I am using a fixed extent.

Yup I am aware of the provider part but shouldn’t one still be able to interpolate QGIS expressions (or at least variables) into the filter expression? I am thinking the equivalent here of doing 

Select * from layer_foo where name=“@some_name”

Which gets replaced with the actual name each time a read request  is made.


Thanks!

Yes - just use it, exactly like you do with atlases :)

Because there's currently no report preview mode, you can't see the
effects of this on the canvas or in the layout designer. But it WILL
work correctly at export time.

That would work in some cases, but variables can also be QGIS specific
values like geometry objects. So then every provider would need logic
to convert these to something which works for that backend. I suspect
this is a dangerous path to go down, since we'd constantly be trying
to close corner cases where a particular filter isn't working
correctly for a particular backend.

I think I'd prefer a mode where you could choose from either filtering
using the backend syntax OR qgis expressions. Given that we now have
good support for "compiling" QGIS expressions back to the closest
possible provider native equivalent, and that all providers handle
this, in most cases there should be very minimal loss of performance.
And the benefit would be that ALL QGIS expressions would be guaranteed
to work correctly regardless of the provider backend...

Hmm I had been trying this the last couple of days with no luck……but now I got it to work! Yay! I’m sure not enough people tell you this, but the report stuff is awesome! Thanks!


We don’t have anything equivalent of the layout atlas’s filter features right? Would be nice to be able to filter report group records by some criteria.

Thanks for the feedback above - I will go with the cheating approach of using rule based renderers for filtering data for now.  But nice to know you have a plan in mind for some crowdfunding or grant work in the future :-P

Unfortunately not yet. I was hoping someone would step up and sponsor
this, but it's also been on my wip document planning future
improvements to layouts/reports which could be done in a co-funding
manner...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Can I change the schema of table
	"public.layer_styles"?
Message-ID: <CAGKduJ2kxrSkeBgbDWwnvBn+2AF2RCGNC7jwW7fdqeQCPYdYng@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I wonder if there's the option to change the schema of the postgres table
"public.layer_styles" that is used to store the laye styles. For example, I
would like to put it into "main.layer_styles".

When we do backups on the table, we always skip the public schema since it
contains also a table with PostGIS functions. When we restore the backup to
a new Postgres version, it's useful to skip that table.

Hi Mathias, Hi Rainer,

Rainer, I update all ports and I cannot reproduce the issue... Tested on 
FreeBSD 12 (jail) with clang 8.0.1 and clang 9.0rc1.

Do you still have this problem?

Best regards.

Message-ID: <CAEh5jtG8DfZr28NBRWXtBzzzo=Ho7QFM+E=4XZ2wcyKkx=018g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

Here is my 11th-week report for my GSoC Project[4]. You can also check the
project wiki page [2]. Comments and suggestions are welcome :)

GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement Week 11 Report

*Period*: 5 August 2019 - 11 August 2019

*Report*
1. What did I complete this week?
   - Fixing transparency for the billboard to make it smoother on the edge.
It looks better than the previous result, but still not as smooth as I
expected

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1421861/62839460-4f181d80-bc8a-11e9-9387-b7800fdfbc3b.png
   - Adding the layer parameter to the QgsSymbolButton, so that user can
set the symbol using the data from the layer (like common symbol)
   - A lot of debugging why the billboard symbol does not change when the
symbol changed. It does change when I switched the symbol shape (e.g. from
billboard to torus to billboard) or when the altitude clamping is changed
or when the size is changed.
   - Set size from the symbol, still needs some tweak since the billboard
seems too small or too big.
   - Get a fix from Peter regarding the problem with the shader syntax in
macOS
2. What am I going to achieve for next week?
   - Solve using a symbol from QgsSymbolButton
   - Fixing the size issue
3. Is there any blocking issue?
   - Changing symbol doesn't always change the billboard
4. Code
   - Branch for billboard feature [1]
   - Repo for QT C++ billboard [3]
5. Misc
   - N/A

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Looking for tips to avoid unnecessary
 configuration reset when building QGIS
Message-ID: <CAECJsSpgebX5VTbK+oAA=3zyF2GMW8usQVvA+_V1tihQMHMkZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,
I'm facing a recurrent issue with the process of building QGIS and I'd like
to get feedback/advice from you.

I checkout and build master branch
Whenever I modify files I can run the build command and it applies rather
quickly. only the diff is taken.
Now that I'm satisfied with my changes, I create a new branch, commit the
changes and push to github
Locally, I checkout back my master branch (so back to the original HEAD -
no pull from upstream!)
I do new changes (for another fix)

*Issue*: If I run the build command, it looks like it reads again the
configuration file and instead of building only the diff, it builds all,
taking too much time. Like if I hadn't already built QGIS.

So, how do you avoid this unnecessary waste of time?

Thanks for any advice.
Harrissou

Hi Harrissou,

You can setup ccache, which will cache previously compiled files for you.

Best regards

Hi Matthias,

Thanks for answering. You mean
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.html#toc7?
I'm pretty sure I did that in the past but I'll give it another shot as
soon as possible.

Harrissou

>From one specific project file accessing "Processing Toolbox" makes QGIS
hang.
If I start on a new project I have no problems.

The project includes Geopackages and background maps from QuickMap Services.
A lot of different stuff has been in and out of the project like an MSQL
connection and WFS connections, but these are not in the project anymore. 

I am suspecting that project files are not always cleaned 100% when deleting
layers?

Anybody got a clue on what can trigger this behaviour from Processing - it
is quite a big project, would prefer not to start it all over....

More and more your work is revealing that we'll eventually need to
tackle this issue head on, and implement proper opacity support in the
3d renderer. Everything else is going to be just a hack which won't
work in all circumstances. I'd suggest not spending much more time on
this issue given this (current) inherent limitation.

I looked over your branch, and it seems the issue is in saving and
restoring the symbol, not the retrieval of the symbol from the button.
Is that correct?

Message-ID: <FD6CD008-25BD-46A0-A619-D17946CD0DDA@kartoza.com>

Hi All

I am running into a bug on macOS using QGIS 3.8 using the project load python hook [1] and was curious:

1) Can anybody replicate this on other operating systems
2) Does the macro run *after* layers have been loaded in the project or before?  Former seems more logical to me but you should never assume to much eh? :-)

Thanks

Tim

Hi Tim,
I have exactly the same error with QGIS 3.8.0 on Archlinux.

Cheers

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Copy Exact coordinates of a Vertex
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqYn0T7oKkenoFZ-7TZB_fBhA5U0CppswZG5aqJAW_trg@mail.gmail.com>

I received a request for "Lat Lon Tools" to support snapping for the
purpose of copying exact coordinates of a vertex or the location where two
geometries intersect, to the clipboard. That second part might be much more
difficult.

What is your opinion on this? Is it something that should be supported and
if so what would be the proper method for implementing this? What part of
the QGIS API should I be looking at?

Thanks for any guidance on this,

Calvin

Sure.

The billboard changes IF the previous billboard is not a symbol. But IF the
previous billboard is a symbol, and I changed the symbol's properties (e.g.
color, rotation, shape) the billboard stays the same.

In my latest code (pushed by now), I set the billboard to use an external
image (the success-kid.png) if the symbol's color is white (for debugging
purpose).

If I set the symbol to white, the billboard uses the success-kid as the
billboard (no matter what is the previous billboard as expected).
If the previous symbol is the* success-kid, *then I changed the symbol's
properties it will change as expected.
If the previous symbol is not the *success-kid*, then I changed the
symbol's properties,  it won't change the billboard.

When I close QGIS and reopen it, the billboard will show as expected. So, I
think it's not an issue in saving and restoring the symbol.

Previously, I thought the problem is the changed signal from the button or
the saving and restoring, but it seems it is something else.

Best regards.

Hi Tim !  (Greetings from Denmark :-)

On Windows 8.1 64 bit and QGIS 3.8.1 64 bit:

I've modified your python code a little bit:

from qgis.core import QgsProject
from qgis.utils import iface

def openProject():
     layers = QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName('kommune')
     layer = layers[0]
     iface.showAttributeTable(layer)


def saveProject():
     pass

def closeProject():
     pass

It works after enabling macro's. (You'll have to change the layer name 
back to your original layer name)

Thanks Bo! @Mario can you confirm which behaviour you replicated? The exception when calling traceback.print_exception() failed
or my dodgy code simply failing with a nice exception message as Bo demonstrated (which is expected behaviour).

Regards

Tim

Looking over your branch, I'm almost certain it is.

Try using QgsSymbolLayerUtils::symbolProperties to save to symbol to a
string (see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/callouts/qgscallout.cpp#L237
)

and something like
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/callouts/qgscallout.cpp#L261
to restore.

Bo's code works as expected, but even for me the traceback fails if there
are errors.

Hi Nyall,

Thanks for your suggestions. I followed the code that you pointed out. It's
in this commit
https://github.com/ismailsunni/QGIS/commit/2a4caa41e23edfe183055863cee84de60e7b71b9

Unfortunately, it doesn't fix the problem. It still behaves exactly like
the previous approach. Perhaps I missed something?

Best regards.

Hi All,

We cannot figure out how to share upload rights for our plugin. I am
currently the only maintainer  (osgeo id "joskal") but we would like  to
have permission for  "henrikspa" to have upload rights as well.

If it is not possible to share upload rights, can someone please help us
and set "henrikspa" as the maintainer for the midvatten plugin (
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/midvatten/)?

kind regards,
Josef

I agree 50% here. Of course obsessions are bad. However, breaking an
existing functionality scares people away from upgrading, and undermines
the credibility of the project. Having people using older version has
always been an issue for the project.

fully agreed, this is obviously the main problem here.

this is also a good point. of course clearcut solutions are impossible,
so I think it's just a matter of personal judgment. The only practical
alternative I see is the one below.

Hi Nyall and others here,

I'm writing here to the dev list because the PR has already been pulled 
and closed.

We implemented this new code in our plugin and it works very well! One 
thing is bothering me though, and I hope I am wrong here.

As I wanted to do a clean up in the plugin unload method, I figured I 
can never remove the preprocessor. Since our plugin overwrites the 
pathPreprocessor, it also overwrites any existing preprocessor. Or even 
worse, another plugin could overwrite ours! :)

I think the most elegant solution is a list of pathPreprocessors that 
will return either the input path or an edited one (like now). The path 
resolver would run them all in a chain and fix all paths for all 
plugins. By giving them an ID, it would also be possible to remove them 
(or overwrite them with a processor that always returns the input) on 
unloading the plugin.

I guess this is quite some work for a not much used feature (yet) and 
maybe the reason you chose to implement it this less comlplicated way. 
But it is potentially really hard to debug problems if 2 or more plugins 
collide on this and we want to reproduce the error. We would need to 
know all the plugins and versions our users have installed and look into 
that code.

Am I right? Please let me know your thoughts about this.

Kind regards,
Raymond

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How can I connect to events in a QGIS main window
 from a Python plugin - or: How can I trigger a function once the main
 window has actually been displayed?
Message-ID: <9a7046cf-b73c-cad8-6c91-1ff53cd27a74@pleiszenburg.de>

Hi all,

in a QGIS Python plugin, I want to run a function (a single time) when
the QGIS main window has actually been displayed / fully loaded.
`initGui` appears to run "long" before the main window is actually being
displayed and ready. My only viable idea so far has been to attach an
event filter to the main window object. The problem is that it does not
get triggered at all (for any type of event).

I attached a minimal, (not) working example below this email.

How can I either make my example work OR how else can I trigger code
based on the QGIS main window having been fully loaded / displayed?

QGIS 3.6 and 3.8 on openSUSE Linux.

Full disclosure, I also posted a related question on SO:
https://stackoverflow.com/q/57534440/1672565

Best regards,
Sebastian



```python

class something:

    def __init__(self, iface):

        self.mainwindow_obj = iface.mainWindow()

    def initGui(self):

        self.wait_for_mainwindow = True
        delay_on_load(self.my_func, self.mainwindow_obj)

    def my_func(self):
        "MUST ONLY RUN WHEN mainwindow_obj HAS BEEN FULLY DISPLAYED"

        if not self.wait_for_mainwindow:
            return
        self.wait_for_mainwindow = False

        # do something useful NOW ...

def delay_on_load(func, qt_widget):

    from PyQt5.QtCore import QObject, QEvent
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMessageBox

    QMessageBox.warning(None, 'TEST', 'Installing filter ...')

    def wrapper():
        qt_widget.removeEventFilter(filter_obj)
        func()

    class filter_class(QObject):
        def eventFilter(self, obj, event):
            QMessageBox.warning(None, 'TEST', 'Got event type "%s"' %
str(event.type()))
            if event.type() == QEvent.Polish: # and obj is qt_widget:
                wrapper()
                return True
            return QObject.eventFilter(obj, event)

    filter_obj = filter_class()
    qt_widget.installEventFilter(filter_obj)

    QMessageBox.warning(None, 'TEST', '... install done.')

iface has a signal initializationCompleted, that you connect in initGui.

Hi Loïc,

Sorry for the late answer, I had been on vacation for some days.

I tested again on a recent HEAD amd64 (r351113) and it fails with clang
8.0.1, but builds with clang 9.0rc2! So this really seems to be a
special problem of clang and should be solved until 9.0x.

In the next days, I will prepare the updates for graphics/qgis-ltr and
graphics/qgis.

Best wishes,
Rainer

Message-ID: <CAEh5jtERmBvvViG9TnLXFPzVWJY1W8M4j9g9TJXt1d_piiHDtA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

Here is my 12th-week report for my GSoC Project[4]. You can also check the
project wiki page [2]. Comments and suggestions are welcome :)

This time, I made a video to show the progress after stuck with a blocking
issue.

GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement Week 12 Report

*Period*: 12 August 2019 - 18 August 2019

*Report*
1. What did I complete this week?
   - Debug "Changing symbol doesn't always change the billboard"
   - Get help from Martin to fix the problem. It's updated because
QgsTerrainTextureImage thinks it doesn't need to update the symbol due to
the same extent.
   - Removing unrelated UI (transformation and material widget) for the
billboard
   - Add set height option for the height of the billboard
   - Save the billboard symbol as a symbol attribute (previously using
serialization)
   - Add `selected` symbol for the billboard. It's showing a black-symbol,
not yellow-symbol like a normal selected one.
   - Save the billboard symbol to the project.
   - Fix flipped billboard
   - Video about this progress: https://youtu.be/QZr16uq8Pco
2. What am I going to achieve for next week?
   - Addressing black selected symbol
   - Address size symbol issue
   - Finalize and submit PR
   - Write final report
3. Is there any blocking issue?
   - N/A
4. Code
   - Branch for billboard feature [1]
   - Repo for QT C++ billboard [3]
5. Misc
   - N/A

Hi,

I am waiting for the approval of a new version of the plugin (GPX 
Segment Importer) since 1 week. All previous versions were approved 
fast, so I want to ask for some feedback on the plugin approval (holiday 
season, some issues with the plugin, ...)!?

Yes, it seems so. I am not sure either since sometimes it happens sometimes
it's not. I also opened the same project with QGIS 3.8.1, it shows the same
thing. Perhaps the problem is already there (not related to the feature
that I develop) or the project that I have. I haven't checked further. See:

Perhaps the problem is already there (not related to the feature that I develop) or the project that I have. I haven't checked further. See: https://imgur.com/a/cisqkiX

Right, that is independent from what Ismail has been working on. Those
"cut" circles are a texture on the terrain. Because the project extent
is very small, the circles are not fully drawn.

Generally when using 3D renderers it is useful to set null 2D renderer
to such layers to avoid the confusion of having a single feature
rendered twice... And also it is useful to also have some background
map so in the 3D scene it is clear where the scene starts and where it
ends :-)

Cheers

Hi Simon,
Both me and Admire, the plugin managers, are currently mostly offline. I'll deal with the plugin queue in a few days, during the QGIS contributors meeting.
Sorry for the delay.
Cheers.

	meeting
Message-ID: <26ab87be-f45a-0092-724e-ffe38548cea3@di.uminho.pt>

Hi QGISers,

We have just one slide to present at the OSGeo annual general meeting.
The slide is still empty. We have a few days to prepare it. The link is:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1imiG7x09ry7lGvmS15FCVq2Z7yaICY00fcpXBK27TXY/edit?usp=sharing

Can I have your collaboration to fill the slide? Possible topics are:

0) Events
- QGIS UserConf & Hackmeeting, March 4-10, 2019, Coruña
- ? (someone mentioned one event in US on the mailing list)

1) key accomplishments
- 2/3 features (which ones?) from Changelog for 3.6
- 2/3 features (which ones?) from Changelog for 3.8
- Proj 6 integration ?
- Issues on Github ?
- Better support for Mac OS installation ?
- ?

2) Board and members initiatives
- Elections for voting members (1 more voting member)
- Call for Grant Proposals 2019 (summary of the call, budget and results)
- Google Summer of Code

4) Outlook for the near future
- 3.10
- 3D (works from Martin + Ismail Sunni)
- DB Manager refactored ?
- ?

See you in Bucharest,

J. Gustavo

Hi Jorge,

Thanks for bringing it up.

Just one slide or 2-3?

 From your contents (which I agree those are important to mention) this 
would be a  very dense slide.

Note that we also have 2 full presentations: on the state of the QGIS 
project (myself) and on new features (Marco or Matthias I think). So we 
can cover QGIS progress more in these 2 presentations.

Greetings,

Andreas

Right. I debated this a lot internally when writing that API hook, and
came to the conclusion that it's not really intended for use in public
plugins, but rather just for those "internal only" organisation
plugins. I guess this was the wrong choice :P

I'd propose we could adjust the api:

    static void setPathPreprocessor( const std::function< QString(
const QString &filename )> &processor );

to

   static QString setPathPreprocessor( const std::function< QString(
const QString &filename )> &processor );

which returns an automatically generated unique string identifying the
processor.
And then we add new call

   static void removePathPreprocessor( const QString& id );

Internally, the processors would just be called in the order they've
been set, chaining the result from one into the next.

How's that sound?
Nyall

Hi Nyall,

That sounds exactly what we need!

In this case I would think addPathPreprocessor() would be a better name 
than setPathPreprocessor().

The chain order should not matter since every preprocessor will check 
for something specific, in our case paths with our plugin name.

Kind regards,
Raymond

Hi all,
I'm still trying to save a simple text report created by a plugin as a pdf
file. I'm using QTextDocument().setHtml() because I want to set some text
effects (bold, italic, font size, ecc.) but it seems to support only a
subset of HTML. For instance, I tried to add a table border using the
attribute style but it doesn't work.
Do you know any alternatives to QTextDocument().setHtml()? Do you have any
suggestions?

Thanks in advance,
Roberta

Hi Roberta,

I don't know how to do this in Qt, but could you use a QgsPrintLayout 
with an html frame and then export that to pdf?

Kind regards,
Raymond

Good to know. FYI, there is a plan to bump LLVM_DEFAULT to 90. It may be 
worth indicating that llvm80 should not be used.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Event woes in QGIS
Message-ID: <6EDB455314CAD940983B0F3ACAC4B0A53B14D747@Mail2010.LIFA.DK>

Hi bold developers of QGIS.

I've recently begun digging into utilizing the event (signal) model of QGIS (3.4).

And I've encountered a number of frustrations, as the events don't work the way they're supposed to, at least according to the available documentation (https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/index.html).

E.g., the event "layerLoaded" on the project instance with the description "Emitted when a layer from a projects (sic) was read", which to me indicates, that the loading is done (due to the use of "loaded" and "was").

But the event is emitted before the loading of the layer is done, and you are therefore unable to find the layer it concerns.

Another example is the event "metadataChanged" on a loaded layer, which again to me indicates a past/done action (due to the use of "changed"). But again, it's emitted before the change actually takes place, and the changed metadata isn't available.

If the two events are indeed preload events, their names should instead be something like "layerLoading" and "metadataChanging", or even "layerPreLoad" and "metadataPreChange".

Is there a guide somewhere to tell how the event system is envisioned, and which events are emitted pre-action and which are emitted post-action ?

Or must I (hopefully not) take a deep look into the QGIS source code itself for this kind of information ?

In general, pre-action events are of limited use, except when it comes to deletions and destructions. For loading and changing stuff, post-action events are almost always what you need.

I agree the name can be misleading misleading, "Emitted when a layer from a
projects was read." the key is in "read", it means "read from the project
XML file", also, it takes two arguments:
     * \param i current layer
     * \param n number of layers
so, the first time it is emitted "before" any layers is read: layerLoaded(0,
<number_of_layers>)
and then it is emitted exactly once "after" each layer has been read and
(this time for real) loaded in the layer registry.
Be aware that the loaded layers may still be invalid because they might be
broken layers.

actually metadataChanged looks like it is called "after" the change takes
place.

 I'm afraid that, set aside a few cases, most of the signals have been
created to meet particular needs for internal synchronization of QGIS
application, they are now part of the stable API and I agree the we should
improve the naming and the documentation and make them more
developer-friendly for Python plugin developers.

Something to keep in mind for QGIS4.

You could also file a ticket for that, just to keep it under the radar:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis4.0_api/issues

Hope this helps.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] DBManager TopoViewer silently fails to load
	edge/node layers
Message-ID: <20190821133252.GA24824@liz>

It's been a long time but I just clean-built QGIS from master branch
(commit 8145f8f9276bb0b71ffb076e9b4115d800c41747) to find that the
TopoViewer of DBManager is failing to provide proper layers.

The TopoViewer creates a layer tree composed by a top group
named after the target topology and 3 sub-groups:

   - Faces
     - face_mbr
     - face
     - face_seed
   - Nodes
     - node
     - node_id
   - Edges
     - edge
     - directed_edge
     - edge_id

Of the 8 layers, only the ones under "Faces" work, while the others
not only don't show anything but do not even present the user with
a right-click->Properties (or double-click) menu to inspect
properties. The right-click menu shows only a few entries
(copy layer, rename layer, duplicate layer) and show no geometry type.

Do you have any idea what could cause this ?

The logs, for one of the layers, report:

	src/providers/postgres/qgspostgresprovider.cpp:100 : (QgsPostgresProvider) [3ms] URI: dbname='p' port=5432 key='edge_id' estimatedmetadata=true srid=4167 type=LineString checkPrimaryKeyUnicity='1' table="test0"."edge_data" (geom) sql=

You probably want to use the layersAdded or layerWasAdded signals
instead. They sound like what you're after.

(We should really hide layerLoaded from the python bindings. It's for
internal purposes only and is evidently misleading)

Hi Lars -

I hazard a guess, that you want to execute some action after a /project/ 
has finished loading.

You might have a look on how to execute macro's after open, save or 
close events for the project:

In the project properties, you can enable macro's and write some python 
code that will be stored in the project:

Example: (Open an attribute window with data from layer 'kommune" after 
the project has finished loading)

|#--- macro start --- from qgis.core import QgsProject from qgis.utils 
import iface def openProject(): layers = 
QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName('kommune') layer = layers[0] 
iface.showAttributeTable(layer) def saveProject(): pass def 
closeProject(): pass||#--- macro end ---|

Hi,

Is there a place where I can check what dependency versions are being used
in our Linux, Windows and Mac official releases?

The INSTALL.txt file as information about the minimum versions, but not the
actual versions that are used to build and run QGIS.

Thanks,

Alex Neto

I don't think so.  You would need to check the actual packages and the current
state of the underlying distributions - eg. not all dependencies in the
debian/ubuntu packages will be versioned.

	Meeting in Bucharest
Message-ID: <4D5FD657-AE20-408E-8D89-5968F739E8F5@kartoza.com>

Hi all

So we are settling in nicely at the great hackfest venue in Bucharest and I wanted to confirm the remote sessions for the meet up. Could I ask 

1) Take a look at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/23rd-Contributors-Meeting-in-Bucharest#making-your-first-pull-request-to-qgis and the subsequent sections and...
2)  Those who have their names next to a session as the presenter confirm if you are able and willing to present on this topic again, then write me an email with your proposed day and time if you are available, or let me know if you are not.
3) If you are participating in-person or remotely and would like to have a discussion about a specific topic, add it to the wiki page using the existing template and then also pop me a note so that I can find a session presenter for your chosen topic if possible.
4) if you are participating remotely and really want to join a discussion but are constrained e.g. by living on the wrong side of the world (looking at you Australia :-) ) pop me a note so that I can try to schedule it at a time that will work for you.

Have a great hackfest all!

Regards

Tim

If anyone is still around on Tuesday 27th August and not in the workshops I
am keen to join a session then if there is anything planned.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Documentation wish list for "hackfesters"
Message-ID: <CAECJsSq=Ad+oYtVxny9Q9-Jnk=SgpvHOKRzE=RadjrWuM8M-XA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

With the QGIS Community Meeting beginning, a bunch of developers and
writers will meet to brainstorm and improve QGIS. Here are some suggestions
of topics (among many others) some documentation contributors would be
REALLY interested in having a fix for. We need a developer to address and
ease our "life" (sounds tragical enough? :D ). Well.

In short:
1/ *Improve the automatic creation of screenshots* [1]
2/ *Redirect docs links *and ensure that changing links in docs does *not
break the help button* in application [3]
3/ *Document/improve the doctest architecture for PyQGIS Cookbook *(kind of
[4])

For the details:
1/ QGIS is moving fast. Dialogs are changing at every release, making
screenshots in the docs obsolete. There was a plan to avoid writers
manually take each screenshot, and instead generate them in series,
browsing tabs of a specified dialog eg. A work had been initiated in the
QgsAppScreenshots class [1]. It could be nice to get more news on it.
Incidentally, with such a feature, we can expect more translated
screenshots (which may not be good for our server but helpful for
non-English readers and translators).

2/ Because features are getting bigger, we sometimes need to reorganize the
chapters in documentation in order to match how things behave in the
application and also avoid very loooong chapters. Moving sections or
renaming them (to match their actual scope) breaks the Help button
associated to the feature, for at least three releases (the next-to-be LTR
and the two previous versions since they point to the same doc). To fix
that, doc writers have to update the links in the code and this change only
applies to current release(s), not for EOLed one (eg 3.6 could have more
not working links than 3.8 or master - we have a script for checks [2]).
We need to find a more viable way to address this issue and redirect
requested links to their actual place in the corresponding doc.
This issue is a long standing one that has been reported/discussed a couple
of times already (eg [3] has some suggestions)

3/ During the La Coruna hackfest, a doctest infrastructure has been set up
to ensure code samples provided for PyQGIS Cookbook are still working.
Months later, it looks to me like it's less used than it should:
 - partly, because we did not make it mandatory,
 - partly because it does not apply (or we did not figure out how?) in some
cases. Eg it seems it does not know about iface [4]. Also there are test
projects the system should rely on but nobody uses it and afaics there's no
example someone not used to this could follow.
It could be nice clarifying the system and help writers adopt it.

[1] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/qgsappscreenshots.h
[2] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/scripts/chkdoclink.sh
[3]
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/2258#issuecomment-352246124
[4] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/3776

Et voilà... Sorry to have been long. Looking forward...
And for information, docs still have unallocated founds...

Happy hackfest,
Harrissou

Hi all,
any news about this? I believe it's a bad regression.
Sandro, did you open a ticket? Any idea about when this popped up?
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issue priorization for bugfixing: go flag your
	favorite issues
Message-ID: <026a213e-98f9-2697-364a-0b6e161d3d98@opengis.ch>

Yesterday at a dinner with many well known friendly faces, a discussion 
started about the priorization of issues.

One of the main problems when deciding which issues to tackle is, that a 
developer perspective often differs from the one from the average user 
perspective.

So we thought it might be a good idea to start giving our users a bigger 
voice in how bugs are prioritized - and how the projects funds are spent 
- by giving the developers more information about the "impact footprint" 
of issue reports.

*In short: if you particularly hate an issue (or two or three) go to 
this issue on github and just give the first post of it a thumbs up**👍**.*

The following link will then show the leaderboard of annoying things

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3ABug

While there is no guarantee that these bugs really will be solved first 
(there are a couple of other things also to take into account, like a 
well defined solution being at hand) this should give us a much better 
(democratic) idea of the often-cited user expectation.

Thanks for reading

Matthias

I find the idea interesting and positive, but I see a couple of problems:
* this may generate frustration among users (why the hell an issue with
tens of "likes" has not been solved already? You crappy developers don't
listen to us!)
* thumbs up is cheap, and does not necessarily reflect real interest.
I would be more in favour of an honest expression of interest: I put my
money where my mouth is. Can we have a mechanism of donations attached
to a articular ticket?
Cheers.

I think this is mainly a point of communication.

If explained well as an "indication" and not as a "guarantee" - online 
and live while teaching - I think we'll get the message out.

And, even if not fixed it will help us triage the important ones and add 
status information (for those who read carefully).

It's an interesting idea, but I am afraid we'll put the project in a bad 
position. In particular, it brings the project into a situation where it 
acts as a service provider proxy, where it's easy to interpret the 
project as the one to take responsibility for those bugs being fixed 
(just like you wrote above "why the hell has issue X not been solved 
yet", but with money involved this time), and last, it's hard to come up 
with a good process (should there be estimates first? or money first and 
when there's enough someone picks the issue?).

I would say we better leave this role to the developers and have 
earmarked fundings for well defined projects (like the mac builds) or by 
directly advertising current crowdfunding projects from developers.

Cheers

Thanks Matthias, thanks for this, as of course it *is* the eright thing to
do,

I only hope that next time this will be at least announced a little bit
more in advance other than a Saturday morning, during August, at the start
of the dev meeting.

I did in the past several "priority lists" and it takes a while to decide,
togther with you developers, what is worth prioritizing and what not.

Speaking  about that, and just to clear air about a thread on a similar
subject in the PSC list:

There is no "paranoia" (I kindly ask stop using this word around this
matter) about/around regressions. Regressions *always break someone
workflow*, and it is not about you or me to decide if not fixing them (who
are me/you to decide that someone else workflow is not important?). They
should be always fixed, at least in our LTR release (and also thanks to
Sandro Santilli for basically saying the same thing).

As someone else said is not true that a "bug is a bug": while certainly
there are issues that is not easy to classify if they impact a lot or not,
the vast majoity is easy to to say if they are important or not. Do not
confound the fact that maybe a ticket do not gets much attention or
comments: just a few people actually do that (file tickets, comment), part
of them were also educated to have faith and expect fixes (of important
issues) at least in the upcoming LTR releases, sometimes just to wait in
vain (just because the the paid bug fixing effort do not comes with any
sort of priority list).

have fun there

what role, to choose what to fix? if yes then... no, not completely at
least.

I actually fixed it in master branch
(ae0721891b6b521ee0d0a3dd8b8a8b092b017554)
and backported it to 3.4 (f3ce1b44d734a4a3c08d01be04d39779ef001c9a)
and 3.8 (6cbfb360b47580bd854283b5c5cad91b3367ac8c) branches.

Thanks for the followup!

NOTE: next issue I have is a crash on startup, see

Putting aside the rest of the conversation regarding regressions for
now, something I'd like to see clarified is what exactly classifies as
a regression? There's SO much users can potentially do in QGIS which
goes far beyond the original design of any particular feature, and
which works by sheer chance alone. If this breaks in a future release,
is it really a regression? To use a ridiculous example, if I wrote a
custom script which relied on hooking into QGIS dialog's widgets via
raw PyQT api, and then that dialog is rearranged in future and the
button I was tapping into is removed -- is this really a regression?
I'd argue strongly not, and that all along I was playing it dangerous
by relying on unintentional behaviour.

So maybe something explicit like: "a regression is a clearly
documented feature (or a feature with pending documentation ticket),
or a feature covered by existing units tests, which breaks". This
means:
- clicking the browse button in the file attachment widgets crashes
qgis: regression
- a project which depends on postgres foreign data wrappers to
evaluate a default field value by performing an aggregate on a related
layer from the current project breaking in a future release: not a
regression

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GitHub Issue Tracker Triage Members
Message-ID: <D1EF3874-F5C2-489A-BA94-AD13D1846C52@kartoza.com>

Hi all

Last night we were discussing a bit the GitHub tracker. One thing we don’t have is a way for non-core developers to self assign issues. Or for example for me to assign a ticket to someone from my company to work on. I understand that developers do not want random people to assign tickets to them but we do need a way for assignments to be managed, and generally to have more people able to triage tickets.

Our proposal is to liberally assign triage permissions to anyone who requests it by adding them to this group (which has no commit rights, only triage rights):

https://github.com/orgs/qgis/teams/community/members

Members of that group can then be assigned tickets or self assign tickets. If anyone misbehaves in that group we can simply remove them from the group again.

Regards

Tim

Hi Nyall,

in my mind, a regression is some functionality that worked and does not
work anymore. It also does not have an acceptable workaround (or
alternative path to achieve the same result)

clearly a regression, and it does not matter that is an upstream problem.
We knew about it for about a year and only took action (removing the
button!) only now.
This particular regression should have been handled much more gracefully
than we did.

clear example of something that likely is not used by many, unlike the
previous example, so something that can be discussed if is urgent to fix or
even a won't fix.


In the real of "technically not a regression, but pretty bad one" I could
make a recent  example:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/31251

which is clearly something that was overlooked when re-writing/re-designing
that edit tools

agreed, but I'm still unsure we'll be able to convey the right message.
I have see social networks taking strange directions easily, regardless
of the efforts by the transmitter. Of coourse, GH has already a bit of a
barrier for casual users, so we might be sheltered.

again, it's a matter of communication ;)
I don't think we should expect for the users to pay fully for the fix,
but rather use the money donated as an honest indication of interest,
more reliable than a cheap click.
this approach wouold also alleviate or solve the previous point.

Cheers.

Please continue this list. I see the two things as complementary and 
wouldn't want to sacrifice one for the other! I even think that if the 
thumbs up work nicely you can take it as input for your list too.

Can we move this discussion to a different thread?

I fear this does not help to bring the discussion here forward.

Thanks anyway, we'll send some pictures :)

	hackfest?
Message-ID: <b444cd22-99cf-ba73-af13-2bebe9941128@rasterra.nl>

Hello Nyall and all contributors,

I while ago I made a PR to improve on the 'world' easter egg (have 
better data under it),
as well as adding two more layers:

  - province/state boundaries
  - disputed borders

Those would not be added to the canvas when invoking the 'world' easter 
egg but could be used in the CRS selection window and as default layer 
in a project template.

Nyall was one of the people who said he would be happy to see this merged,
so he could work on a few ideas around it (mainly what I mentioned 
above: CRS selection window and project template) before the feature 
freeze on August 30th.

Here is the PR:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30647

I know that there are mixed opinions about shipping data with QGIS -
therefore I thought it would be handy to discuss and decide during the 
hackfest whether this PR should be merged or not as it is.

I also have my own concerns, mainly about starting to manage data, and 
their processing pipelines which I think is not a good idea, (discussion 
on the PR is starting to head in that direction now)

Id be glad for to hear your thoughts on this.

And if you are here in Bucharest too, I would be happy to sit together 
and have a chat about it;
can also sum up the story if you want to have a quick understanding 
without reading all comments / commit messages.

Thanks,

Best regards,
Aron

	graphical modeler
Message-ID: <5ef823d1-0f7d-4e48-9fbf-9a017c22e114@gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Devs,

Recently, I received two messages from users concerning the speed of 
processing algorithms which are implemented in the QNEAT3 plugin. More 
specifically, they report that the execution time of algorithms slow 
down up to 10 times when the algorithm is used in the graphical modeler 
compared to manual execution from the processing toolbox (used 
algorithm: OD Matrix from Layers as Lines (m:n)). I link the ticket from 
the QNEAT3 repository here for reference: 
https://github.com/root676/QNEAT3/issues/21

I would like to identify the cause of this problem because on the first 
look I can't relate it to any implementation flaws on the plugin side. 
Has anyone else experienced this problem with other processing plugins 
or core algorithms? I didn't have time yet to check if core algorithms 
are affected too. Could it be some kind of bug related to the graphical 
modeler? Do you have any hints what could cause this problem on the 
plugin side so I can fix it? Tanks in advance!

Best regards,
Clemens

The only difference I can think of between running them in the toolbox
vs models is that when you run a model it's always run in the main
thread, including all the child algorithms inside that model. When you
run direct from the toolbox then **some** algorithms are flagged as
safe to run in background threads and won't be run on the main thread.

So potentially they are seeing a slowdown due to this, and other stuff
clogging up the main thread and slowing down the execution...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GSoC 2019 - Final Report - QGIS 3D Improvement:
 On-Screen Navigation, Bookmarks, Rendering Point Feature as Billboard,
 and Measuring Tool
Message-ID: <CAEh5jtGV6p=KBhZJSps71nKiX=C0AGNGf68XQ5g_dpxehosz4w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS and OSGeo community,

The day has come, it's the last day of my GSoC project. Here, I present my
final report for the past three months of m work on this project.

I have made easy to remember the simple website for it also, you can check
it here: https://ismailsunni.github.io/GSoC-2019/

It's a really amazing experience, thanks for all your support.

Final Report
QGIS 3D Improvement: On-Screen Navigation, Bookmarks, Rendering Point
Feature as Billboard, and Measuring Tool

*Google Summer of Code 2019*
* Student - *Ismail Sunni* https://github.com/ismailsunni/
* Mentors:
  * Mentor 1 - *Martin Dobias* https://github.com/wonder-sk
  * Mentor 2 - *Peter Petrik* https://github.com/PeterPetrik
* Organization - *OSGeo* (http://www.osgeo.org/), *QGIS* (https://qgis.org/)
* Developer Community - *QGIS Developers *(
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/)

*Abstract*
QGIS 3D is a great feature that has been introduced in QGIS 3.0 in 2018. It
is still missing some features that are needed or can be helpful for the
user though. In this project, I will work on 4 improvements to fill that
missing features:
- On-Screen Navigation: help the user to navigate the 3D view
- Measuring Tool: measure distance in 3D view
- Rendering Point Feature as Billboard: show a point feature as a billboard
(use case: show icon location and point cloud rendering)
- Bookmarks: help the user to save a 3D view and/or go back to a saved 3D
view

*QGIS Before GSoC 2019*
* It's possible to navigate in 3D Map View by using mouse or keyboard. It's
quite easy to do it unless you are not familiar with it. Just like me. It's
easy to get lost and confused. You are not sure which key or movement to
zoom, tilt, pan, or rotate the map view.
* There is no way to do the measurement in 3D Map view.
* There is no billboard rendering support for a point in 3D.
* There is no bookmark feature to save a specific scene in the 3D map view.
There is only reset view which set the view from the top.

*Added Value of GSoC Project*
* On-Screen navigation for 3D Map View is added with these features: zoom
in and out, pan, rotate with a compas-like widget, tilt up and down. It is
merged to the code base and will be released in QGIS 3.10.
  screenshot:
https://github.com/ismailsunni/GSoC-2019/raw/master/img/3d_on-screen_navigation.jpg
* 3D Measurement Tool to measure distance in the 3D Map View is added. It
is merged to the code base and will be released in QGIS 3.10.
  screenshot:
https://github.com/ismailsunni/GSoC-2019/raw/master/img/3d_measurement_tool.jpg
* 3D Point Rendering as A Billboard is added that gives the option to
render a point a billboard. The billboard can be set with a symbol from
QGIS (including SVG).
  The PR has been reviewed by QGIS core committers, ready to be merged in
upcoming days.
  * The Pull Request https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31308
  * Last commit:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31308/commits/c0f6982fc00da7284f9960ef25c798e740c52e5e
  screenshot:
https://github.com/ismailsunni/GSoC-2019/raw/master/img/3d_billboard_rendering_for_points.jpg

*Work to be done / potential future work*
* 3D Map View bookmarks is not implemented in this project duration due to
time constraint since the billboard rendering implementation needs more
time than the initial expectation.
* Extra feature for 3D On-Screen Navigation: Make it as a floating widget,
but it will need to add another dependency if implemented with QtQuick or
extra work if implemented with manual rendering in the 3D map scene
* Extra feature for 3D Measurement Tool: Show the Z-value difference
between two consecutive points
* Extra feature for 3D Billboard Rendering for Point:
  * Add data-driven symbol support: It needs multi-texture rendering,
currently it only supports one texture.
  * Add a vertical line from the feature to the billboard

*How to use the features*
* All merged featured can be used in QGIS master by building it from source
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL) or in the incoming QGIS
3.10 release
* Video about how to use it:
  * [3D On-Screen Navigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp197BEymks)

Thanks Ismail, booth for your work and for documenting thoroughly every
step of it. Your input to the project is very valuable, and I hope
you'll get support to keep on collaborating with it.
Cheers.

Hi Ismail,

Congratulations! Thanks for your contribution and for providing new
features in QGIS.
If I may, is there a plan to have the feature(s) documented for the QGIS 3D
users in the official User manual (or any end user oriented documentation)?
I think it would greatly complete the work.
3D in QGIS is (one of) the least documented area in the official user
manual. I'm not asking you to fill the gap but...
Btw, I can't find some of the features you developed, in the doc issues
(only 3d measure is listed).

Regards,
Harrissou

Thank you Nyall for your reply!

This gives me some more insights about how algorithm execution is 
implemented in models. I will try to test this issue with other 
processing algorithms (also other plugin algorithms). Maybe this gives 
some insight on whether it is a plugin or QGIS related issue.

Best,
Clemens

Message-ID: <CAOM0XWD4VHCH0HGecDT2gAw3AxhKTL3g2qZe_wiMahiS=xEQGg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings everyone,

I've been noticing that most builds today timeout, usually building and
testing take some time but today the build time are far higher than some
days ago.

I'm wondering if we should increase the timeout to 3 hours (it timeout
after around 2:26 hours) or if there is a way to use ccache and only
compile files that were changed instead of compiling the whole project when
there is the slightest change.

With out ever-expanding codebase things don't seem to scale well.

I just wanted to start an internal discussion between members of the
project regarding this issue.

Thanks and have a nice day,

Alex

The builds normally use ccache, but something has broken in the last
week and the cache either isn't being correctly stored or restored
between Travis sessions. Not sure if it's in our setup, or an issue on
Travis itself. (But there's been no related changes in our code, so
I'm pointing the finger at Travis)

It seems that the timeout were done in time to correctly save ccache
information.
It looks like build are a bit faster today.
If not, we can try to drop all the caches to start with something clean
again.

I did that earlier today -- but I don't think any builds have
successfully completed since :)

Dear developers of profile plugins,
as you know, we do our best to keep the plugin repository tidy and
clean, to reduce duplication which is confusing for the users and makes
management and maintenance more difficult. With >1,000 plugins now, this
is a necessity more than a choice.
A suggestion from Calvin[0] in the qgis-dev mailing list pushed me to
approach you again, to check together the opportunities to improve the
current situation. I would be grateful if you could take the time to
check his suggestions and discuss together the way to come up with a
beautiful, unified plugin. I know this is extra work for you, and that
everybody tends to like his own solutions, but the gains from having an
unified solutions are great from all points of view.
Looking forward for your suggestions.
Cheers.

Hi, I'm the developer of the VoGIS Profile Tool.

I understand the goal of unifying and it makes total sense to reduce
redundancy, but this plugin was contract work for the Austrian province
Vorarlberg (
https://vorarlberg.at/web/land-vorarlberg/-/landesamt-fuer-vermessung-und-geoinformation-lvg)
tailored to their needs (eg hectometers)

I have to consult with them about their thoughts first before being able to
provide any suggestions.

Cheers

Hi Paolo:

(Current maintainers of ProfileTool here.)

I agree with you that having multiple plugins for the same task (given 
the limited resources available) seems far from an ideal situation, and 
would be glad to collaborate with other developers to join forces in a 
unified solution.

I am not aware of the situation of the other plugins at the moment, (we 
checked on both "VoGIS Profile Tool" and "qProf" and decided to work on 
Profile Tool when we had to make a choice), but here goes my status 
report on Profile Tool codebase/functionality/documentation/support. It 
would be nice if we could get a feature list from the other plugins, see 
what is missing/what users find important in every plugin, and trace a 
'unification routemap' from there.

Codebase:

-We made quite a refactoring effort during migration to QGis 3 to keep 
ui and calculations mostly separated. There are still some minor changes 
to do, but we are close to get there.

-We have no unit tests, and this is something that should be worked on.

-Some parts of the code would appreciate a little love to use more 
pythonic/dry constructions.

-We got rid of most of the stability issues (crashes and python errors), 
though some may still remain.

Functionality:

-Profile plotted along an interactively defined path, a polyline 
selected interactively or a vector layer.

-Elevation information can be taken from raster and mesh layers. 
Multiple layers can be added to obtain several profiles simultaneously.

-Profile can show height (i.e. the raster value), or slope (in % or deg)

-Profile can be sampled all along the input line or only on specified 
input points.

-Profiles can be exported as an image with axes, labels etc in png or 
svg format, and as a 3D polyline / 2D profile on dxf format (using 
pyqtgraph backend) and also PDF and PostScript when using Matplotlib.

-Profile can be exported in text/csv format (on the table tab).

-This is experimental and not documented, but thanks to refactoring 
ProfileTool can be controlled from another plugin/algorithm, feeding 
points programatically to create a 'live' profile.

-Supports PyQtGraph or Matplotlib backend (not really sure on why there 
is a need to support both backends).

-GUI feels a bit crowded, with many controls and tabs, I think that we 
can do better.

Documentation

-No user manual, there are however some tutorials available on blogs, 
webs, etc.

-Not much code documentation.

Support:

-We are currently on maintenance mode, fixing bugs and making minor 
modifications/adding small features when possible, but we have less time 
and resources to work on this than we would like. Next year we may be 
able to put some more work on it.

Regards,

Javier

I will try to make the documentation for them. Is it ok if I put it in this
part:
https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_gui.html#d-map-view
I
couldn't find 3D specific part in the documentation.

I am currently trying to build the documentation locally :)

Btw, I can't find some of the features you developed, in the doc issues
> (only 3d measure is listed).


The billboard rendering PR is merged this morning, the doc issue is in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/4154

For on-screen navigation, I am not sure. It should be created automatically
if we put a feature label, right? The original PR is
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30105 Or must it be a tag [feature] in
the title?

Best regards.

Ok, I will put it there also. I realized that there is no documentation for
the other 3D tool also :)

I hope you succeeded. If ever you had some troubles, keep us informed so

I got it working, but with docker one (HTML and PDF). But, I got this error
message when I built the PDF one: https://pastebin.com/4WRPjqx4

Anyway, it's enough for me to start writing.

[feature] in the title or in a merged commit is the trigger. If you plan to

I will create manually then.

Feedback: adding docker support to build the document is really save a lot
of time.

Thanks.

Best regards.

thanks for your reply. I believe these are general requirements, that
can be useful to many, eventually as options.
Looking forward to hear about their thoughts.

Agreed fully, this seems the best approach.

Could this be linked to the image issues that we had, maybe the image issue
was a symptom of something.

I just find it strange that we have nearly an hour increase in build time.
Would it be a good idea to contact someone at travis to inquire about what
might be the issue?

Message-ID: <CAOM0XWCiPShBpd5wXdn=rffC4x4wqyX_3F2nVjsXc55f-2sgSw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I have a particular PR ( https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31061 ) that is
in limbo, that PR proposes changes to the QgsVectorLayer and I know that
Matthias wanted me to make this PR in order to obtain feedback from the
community regarding these changes.

This message is simply to see if any other dev/contributor could leave a
simple feedback on the PR.

The changes are minimal and entail caching some information in the
QgsVectorLayer and add a function to access that data. Change are
relatively minimal and I don't think this would overcrowd the vectorlayer
API all that much. If anyone shares the same opinion or otherwise I would
appreciate to know.

Thanks and have a nice day!

Hey Alex!

Can you strip out the unrelated changes from that PR? There's changes
in there to the aggregate method which don't seem related, and the
long commit history obscures the rationale behind the changes.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Packaging Qgis standalone python app with
	PyInstaller
Message-ID: <5378b19cd09b49629a9b64550f97cedf@SCPEX2K13-1.scp.fr>

Hello QGIS dev team,

Currently I am developping a standalone python app and I am now working on the packaging with PyInstaller.

Configuration :

-          OS : Windows 10

-          QGIS : 3.4.9

-          PyInstaller : 3.5


Pyinstaller correctly finds many dependencies and manages to create an executable.
When I run it, the output is :

  File "C:\PROGRA~1\QGIS3~1.4\apps\Python37\lib\site-packages\PyInstaller\loader\pyimod03_importers.py", line 627, in exec_module
    exec(bytecode, module.__dict__)
  File "qgis\gui\__init__.py", line 27, in <module>
RuntimeError: qgis._gui cannot import type '����' from PyQt5.QtCore
[6752] Failed to execute script main

When it reaches the line `from qgis.gui import QgsMapCanvas`


I found that the sip folder in QGIS 3.4\apps\Python37\ contains many files that might be useful, so I manually added the content of sip\PyQt5 in the PyInstaller package with other PyQt5 stuff and the new output is :

  File "C:\PROGRA~1\QGIS3~1.4\apps\Python37\lib\site-packages\PyInstaller\loader\pyimod03_importers.py", line 627, in exec_module
    exec(bytecode, module.__dict__)
  File "qgis\gui\__init__.py", line 27, in <module>
RuntimeError: the PyQt5.Qsci module failed to register with the sip module
[4092] Failed to execute script main


After many google research I found this issue (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/31166) which gave me the idea to ask for help on this mailing list.
I hope I am on the right mailing list !

Any idea about a file or folder I forgot to package ?
For PyInstaller I use a default .spec file.

Thanks a lot,
Best regards

Hi all,

As many have noticed, it didn't too long to make Travis fail at the HF ;)

Nyall and I have been / are currently digging into the issue, and it is
about to be fixed.

Please wait before merging any PR to master or re-triggering builds, as we
will prioritize the build of this PR (by canceling others) to get it merged
as soon as possible.

Thanks for your comprehension

Denis

Hi Luca,

The first one sounds like a bug and I''d suggest reporting it to the 
qgis bug tracker.

For clarity: Are we talking about the layer Name or the layer Title? The 
Name is a unique ID for a layer; the vast majority of WxS servers don't 
use spaces in their layer names, instead they use underscores.

The Title is the human-friendly title of the layer and should only be 
used to represent things to us humans.

(Also this question would have been better asked on the QGIS Users list; 
the dev list is for actually developing QGIS)

Cheers,

Jonathan

I disagree. Yes a thumb-up is a "cheap", but the only people who find 
the issue in the first place to thumb it are those it affects. For this 
sort of thing Cheap is a virtue not a problem (I very much doubt there 
are any troll-farms out there targeting bug lists (yet...)).


I think this is a great way of communicating how much certain issues 
affect people and then the limited resources can be directed appropriately.

Not necessarily UML, anything graphical pleases my eyes ;-)

I just filed https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/31471 after finding
out that a .qml file created with QGIS 1.9.0 is not fully honoured
with curretn QGIS master (and I think 3.4.0 as well).

Yes, I know 1.9.0 is old but... is this level of backward
compatibility supposed to work ? Or are there tools to convert
saved styles across versions ?

my understanding is that maintaining compatibility is just too hard to
achieve, and we never promised to our users.
What I always recommend in training and support is to convert projects
from one version to the next, as this should be mostly handled correctly.

How are them converted ? And note we're talking about styles, not full
projects here. And styles that are shipped with QGIS itself (could
this be automated, for shipped styles?).

Hi there,

in the current dev build (3.9.0-53), proj_6_1.dll is missing on Windows
64-bit builds.

There's proj 5.2.0-1 and proj-dev 6.2.0-1 only.
You can't select proj 6.1.x-x at all :-(

Yep - 1.9 to 3.x is a HUGE jump, especially if the project was first
created in an even earlier version (my timeline is shaky here, but it
likely could even be using symbology v1. ouch!). All this old 1.x
compatiblity code was dropped in the 2 -> 3 migration, with the
recommendation being that users who need to open a 1.x project first
load and resave it in 2.18.

> How are them converted ?

See above -- open in 2.18, save, open in 3.x, save.

> And note we're talking about styles, not full projects here. And styles that are shipped with QGIS itself (could this be automated, for shipped styles?).

I don't think it's worth the effort of automating a transition to be
honest. This situation occurs so infrequently (once in the past 10
years) that it's unlikely to pay off. If you want to ensure the style
is future proof, then I'd suggest building it dynamically when
required, and doing it in c++. Then it's effectively guaranteed to
keep working and if anyone changes API, they'll need to fix your code
in order to build....

Ouch, destructive move.

Will try that. Then I guess I'll have to update DBManager templates
in all supported branches: 3.4, 3.8, master -- correct ?

So not even python is API safe ?
Remember we're talking about a core plugin here.

Do you have examples of building style dynamically ?

You can do it on master only and add backport labels which will trigger 
the backports if there are no conflicts.

It is stable throughout version 3.

Longer term, with C++ it's more likely that breaks are noticed just in 
time, because the compiler is quite good at detecting incompatible api 
changes.

Something like this 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/test_qgscategorizedsymbolrenderer.py 
?

No, not at all. And honestly, I'm surprised to hear this attitude from
you. You'd know full well that the opensource community is a finite
resource.

It was the right move to drop this unused legacy code rather than
waste the valuable maintainer power on something completely unused.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Packaging Qgis standalone python app with
 PyInstaller
Message-ID: <18deee6ba0c44836b022b6d9aa8b66ab@SCPEX2K13-1.scp.fr>

Hello QGIS dev team,

Currently I am developping a standalone python app and I am now working on the packaging with PyInstaller.

Configuration :

-          OS : Windows 10

-          QGIS : 3.4.9

-          PyInstaller : 3.5


Pyinstaller correctly finds many dependencies and manages to create an executable.
When I run it, the output is :

  File "C:\PROGRA~1\QGIS3~1.4\apps\Python37\lib\site-packages\PyInstaller\loader\pyimod03_importers.py", line 627, in exec_module
    exec(bytecode, module.__dict__)
  File "qgis\gui\__init__.py", line 27, in <module>
RuntimeError: qgis._gui cannot import type '����' from PyQt5.QtCore
[6752] Failed to execute script main

When it reaches the line `from qgis.gui import QgsMapCanvas`


I found that the sip folder in QGIS 3.4\apps\Python37\ contains many files that might be useful, so I manually added the content of sip\PyQt5 in the PyInstaller package with other PyQt5 stuff and the new output is :

  File "C:\PROGRA~1\QGIS3~1.4\apps\Python37\lib\site-packages\PyInstaller\loader\pyimod03_importers.py", line 627, in exec_module
    exec(bytecode, module.__dict__)
  File "qgis\gui\__init__.py", line 27, in <module>
RuntimeError: the PyQt5.Qsci module failed to register with the sip module
[4092] Failed to execute script main


After many google research I found this issue (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/31166) which gave me the idea to ask for help on this mailing list.

Any idea about a file or folder I forgot to package ?
For PyInstaller I use a default .spec file.

Thanks a lot,
Best regards

It could have been moved to a convertion tool.

Yes I know time is a finite resource, just think about all the time
that has to be spent to convert project/style files ! As I'm writing
this I'm converting the 11 (11!) style files that are shipped with
QGIS itself and are incompatible (since 3.0, is my take?).

Are style files versioned ? It could help to do that, moving forward.
At least QGIS could warn user/error out when trying to open a file
older than 3.0, and give the hint about using 2.18 to convert them.

You get little models in the API docs for each class etc. There is no one big super model I am afraid.

Here is an example of the diagram you can get:

There was no volunteers to do this, and no sponsorship for work of
this nature => no conversion tool. ;)

Yes

That's a good idea -- can you submit a PR?

Hi Sandro,

Maybe I'm missing something, but the Travis failure is not related with
MS ODBC Driver (which is used by the mssql provider).

Travis is failing with:

507/559 Test #507: PyQgsPostgresProvider .........................***Failed

https://cdash.orfeo-toolbox.org/viewTest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=14455

That is related to your PR, right?

Are Postgresql tests running file on your local environment?

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Uhm, does it take going to CDash to know what's wrong with a build ?

> That is related to your PR, right?

Yes, PyQgsPostgresProvider was touched by my PR

> Are Postgresql tests running file on your local environment?

When I remove all tests but the one I added, yes, they
run. When running the full tests, they also fail in master
branch for me.  How I'm running the test:

	ctest -V -R PyQgsPostgresProvider

Example of failures I'm getting:

I've filed the PR and added backport labels:

  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31490

Do backport happen automatically after merge or is there anything else
I should do before proceeding ?

Ok, it was actually my PR.
Wasn't easy to spot the problem, because the QgsVectorLayer.isValid()
call doesn't tell what's invalid about a layer, but at the end the
problem was that QGIS was not able to find a primary key for a view.

I've added the primary key manually as part of the URI, as the test
is meant to test something different and didn't want to get distracted
by that, but if you think QGIS should be capable of finding a working
primary key in a view I'll file a ticket for that.

Other issue: sslmode needed to be disabled for the test to pass.

My PR is now Travis-Green:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31468

I think that some logic to retrieve a pk for a view would be great to have.

If I'm not wrong, the data source select dialog offers a pk when you select
a view, maybe it's just easy as porting that logic to the provider and use
it to guess the PK if there's no information in the URI.

Hi,

As promised on the QGIS Hackfest chat, I want to make a new splash screen
with the group picture that was posted. However the resolution is of the
picture I could download via the chat app is quite poor (just 1280px wide).
Can anyone send me a higher res version of this image please?

I'd think whoever introduced the _new_ format should have taken
care of providing an upgrade path for those with an old format.

Do you know which commit dropped the backward compatibility, exactly ?
Note that "something completely unused" (just re-reading your quoted
text) was actually still used by QGIS itself...

I could try. My first exploration brought me in
src/core/qgsmaplayer.cpp, in this block:

  // get style file version string, if any
  QgsProjectVersion fileVersion( myRoot.attribute( QStringLiteral( "version" ) ) );
  QgsProjectVersion thisVersion( Qgis::QGIS_VERSION );

  if ( thisVersion > fileVersion )
  {
    QgsProjectFileTransform styleFile( myDocument, fileVersion );
    styleFile.updateRevision( thisVersion );
  }

It would sound like QgsProjectFileTransform::updateRevision should throw
an exception when unable to do what's been asked for ?

Do you have any reference of the exact commit which removed such
compatibility ?

This does not give me any hint:

  git log --stat src/core/qgsprojectfiletransform.cpp

for versions as old as 0.8.0:

Hi all,
while upgrading the 3.4 deb package, I get a series of:
proj_create: crs not found
Anyone has an explanation?
Thanks in advance.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Select/extract by location algorithm with same
 input layers (un)expected results?
Message-ID: <CAECJsSpRn17JiGsM9TcF1DMWQ3Vw_=xUUX2pcj7t6s6HRnK76w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I don't know whether it's an issue to file or a design so i'm asking
beforehand.

If you use select by location algorithm with the same layer as source and
comparing, and select a predicate like "within" for example, it returns all
the features since it considers a feature to be within itself. Logical but
this means that you can not rely on this tool to check whether there are
features in the same layer that are within others.
This applies to most of the other geometric predicates, making them useless
in this context.

Question: Should the algorithm not skip same features comparison when we
use the same data source? Or are there other tools for features comparison
if the layers are the same?

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi Paolo,

I am the developer of "Temporal/Spectral Profile Tool" and I am afraid that
Calvin misunderstood the purpose of this plugin. As stated on the plugin
description it is for "interactive plotting of temporal or spectral
information stored in multi-band rasters". This is a different use-case than
plotting a profile along a DEM. More details are on the plugin's GitHub page
[1]. It was based on the Profile Tool code because I wanted to keep a
consistent UI. This is no longer the case and when I have more time I might
try to rework the GUI to return the consistency. But I don't think that it
makes much sense to combine the two plugins into one.

Cheers
Rado

Ha - good question, and not something I've seen discussed before!
Could I request you to do a quick audit of other applications (ArcGIS,
GRASS, etc) and see what behavior they have adopted here?

What proj version do you have?

Not necessarily -- this was a wide group decision, with consensus from
all currently active QGIS developers and maintainers. It was deemed
unnecessary at this point in time. I strongly suspect that there's a
cultural or language effect in play here, but it's hard not to
(mis)interpret this thread as disrespecting the decisions made by the
active QGIS developers and community of the time. Just like I wouldn't
dream of jumping onto the GDAL or Qt lists and questioning design
decisions made by people with intimate knowledge of the code base and
wider context and constraints of discussions, I'd ask you to extend
the same respect and courtesy to our community and the individuals who
have made these informed decisions. These decisions were made,
accepted, and implemented -- let's not argue them retrospectively, but
accept and move on instead.

It's GREAT that you're seeking to address what you see as a feature
gap/bug in QGIS, but I just want to caution that your language is
likely mis-representing your intentions here. (Also I hope that my
tone won't be misinterpreted here either! Cross-cultural community
building is HAAAARD :O )

No, no idea sorry. It would have been 2-3 years ago now, and it was a
mass deletion commit, so git blame won't be much use. You may be able
to git blame qgsvectorlayer.cpp or qgsvectorlayerrenderer.cpp to find.

In this case QgsProjectFileTransform will be a red herring - there was
never a transform in place for this code, so there won't be any clues
there.
