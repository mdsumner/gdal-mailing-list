Subject: [Qgis-developer] Renaming Save Style -> Save Properties (Vector
	layer dialog)
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg86gx+y7z7wJtXcCzzikKUzDmUN7s6zmtzjQ_t2i3x2HA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I would like to get some opinions on Save, Load, Restore Default Style..
buttons.  Personally I find these labeled wrong for what action they take.
 Originally these buttons would only save the information from the Style
tab out to a .qml file however now that has evolved to saving other
information that is not related to style, things like;:the edit forms;
included WMS, excluded WMS, etc.   To me these are more properties of the
layer and less about the style so the name is misleading.  Sharing these
also becomes hard because if I only want the style part it can also
override the label and form settings I have.  Hand editing the XML is the
only real option to remove the other settings, which is a pain

Proposing: Rename from Save, Load Style to Save Properties, Load Properties.

Motivation:  I would like to add the ability to save just the style
information out to a new file type (maybe something like .qstyle) that
would just contain the renderer-v2 XML block.  This would allow sharing of
just the renderer style and would also give me the ability to expand the
Style Manager to allow saving of prebuilt styles e.g I would like to
premake a planning scheme style that all ready contains the right values to
symbols that I could share and load.     By Mixing non style information in
the .qml files means this is not as simple as it could be.

We could also expand the above logic to only save the label section out to
create a label "style" manager.

Thoughts?

Hi All,
Please treat this as "thread enhancing" and not "thread hijacking" :-)

If there are going to be modifications done to styling, please consider 
adding a feature whereby the various styles chosen or experimented with, 
are auto-saved for that mapsheet (perhaps in your project files).
I find when editing, edge-matching or QAing various mapsheets, I want to 
easily switch between styles - I might choose "single symbol" for the 
map I am editing, but "rule-based" for the adjoining maps. Rule based 
choices would change depending on scenarios, so it does not make sense 
to save a rule-based set (I could end up with too many).
So, what I am seeking is the ability to switch between the 5 style 
categories, and not lose the ones I may have set up a few minutes ago. 
If I close QGIS, and come back to the project later, I would like to see 
the last styles I had set up for a mapsheet, still be available when I 
click through the style options.


Hope I'm making myself clear.
Thanks & regards,
Zoltan

You didn't install the ECW plugin v1.10.1-1 from [1], did you?

Because "The GDAL plugins and other extras are not included".

The windows version has ECW too (also optional in OSGeo4W, but included in
qgis-full and hence the standalones).

Hey Zoltan,

That pretty much is a thread hijack.  Please start a new thread, and maybe
open a ticket for the feature request, which is a good one by the way.

Hi Nathan I agree with your proposal of renaming style by properties. 
Users don't understand they also inherit labels, metadata and so on when
loading a style. 

By the way, I think some improvements can be made for reloading style use
case. Problem occurs (maybe occured, didn't check recently) when user want
to transfer graduated or single value style classes from one column to
another. Copying style from another table often leads to that situation,
where field or expression is not in target table.   I know this can be
tricky since graduated classes are in autosync with numeric data. 
Another issue occurs when geometry type is not the same. Maybe we could save
at least color when reapplying style (from point to polygon for instance). 
This was my small thread highjack ;-)
Cheers,

R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] What about a qgis project add function ?
Message-ID: <44EB4301-4A15-4D71-A274-7BBFA549C8A3@gmail.com>

Hello,

I am asking if it just exists an "add project..." function in QGis. 

If not just exists, somebody can tell me if it will be insert in near future?  I think that "add a project" tree should be very powerful to share plans. 

It would be a good plus for QGis. 

What do you think about ?

Anyone is just working on it ?

If not, I am a candidate for it. 

Regards and thanks for any info about it

Hi Nathan, all,

I completely agree we should change the "Save/restore Style" into
"Save/restore properties". I also think it could be great to have a button
"save style". But the latest should not lie in the bottom of the layer
dialog, but instead in the Style tab only, to avoid confusion.
By the way, having a "save style" button could also lead to the ability of
saving/restoring more than one style for each layer (via a combo box for
the restore button), which could be great too.

Regards,
Michael

Hello all,



As in object,  I have this error :



RuntimeError: module compiled against API version 9 but this version of
numpy is 7
Versione Python:
2.7.1 (r271:86832, Jun 16 2011, 16:59:05)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2335.15.00)]
Versione di QGIS:

I installed   GDAL_Complete-1.10  that contains  also NumPy.pkg  that is
the "1.6.2-1 2012-8-21" version .


May I install some other version of NumPy  ?   Where I need to download it ?



Thank you for any help

+1 because I think "Save/Load Properties" describes better what the button  
does.

Personally, I quite like to keep style and labels together. Sure, it might  
be a little less flexible but on the other hand it's faster and often  
labels styles and symbology are designed to work together (e.g. label  
buffer in same/similar color as polygon fill).

Thanks for bringing this up!

Best wishes,
Anita

This could work quite well. Do you think the "Save style" button could be  
a simple button with the save icon or do we need a labeled button?

The current GDAL Complete 1.10 (2013-12-21) has NumPy 1.8 on it.

Python can also be used to find duplicate attributes. It isn't as
straightforward as a sql query, but it works. And if your data isnt in
spatialite/postGIS, I don't know if you can do a select distinct without
creating a more complicated subquery using the expression builder. From the
console:

from collections import Counter

# get a reference to the layer to be searched
layer = iface.activeLayer()

# get the position in the attribute table of the attribute to be checked
idx = layer.fieldNameIndex('attribute_name')

# create a list of all the attribute values
attributeList = [feature.attributes()[idx] for feature in
layer.getFeatures()]

# print the duplicate entries in the attributeList
print([attribute for attribute, count in Counter(attributeList).items() if
count > 1])

Hi all.
Installing qgis server on a fresh Jessie machine, I get a 403.
In previous instances I do not remember such issue: the server was
responding as soon as installed. I tried to add ServerAlias directive,
etc, to no avail.
Anyone know whether something has changed on apache config? Any updated
install instructions?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi William,


I downloaded  GDAL from here:

http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/frameworks/GDAL_Complete-1.10.dmg


and it contains:

GDAL Framework 1.10.1-1 2013-9-2

NumPy Python Module  1.6.2-1 2012-8-21


It is not the correct download link ?

When did you download that?  The current GDAL Complete is dated 2013-12-21, with GDAL 1.10.1-1 (2013-9-2) and NumPy 1.8 (2013-12-7).

But now, I found this other:

and it seems to work   :)

Hi, 
In fact, what would be great is a small evolution of Embed Group and layers
actions. 
I would love to call it "Add or embed from other project", and just add a
checkbox choose embed or hard copy of the layers and groups. Existing dialog
is already correct.
I just ported Import Project plugin to 2.0 to satisfy that need. Just be
aware that you need to give a new id to imported layers, to be able to
import some layers n times. Code is quite simple, I would love to see that
in core!

Hi Zoltan,

This is what I'm currently doing to sort of get this effect. This isn't as complex as yours, but it might help. 
For some of the geology maps (say geology.shp) that I work with I normally look at them coloured by rock type. So my styling for maps becomes (geology.qml). Sometimes it's also useful to look at them by other features, say age or formation name, so I'll make some other styles for those (geology_age.qml) and geology_name.qml). The the layer opens up they way I expect, but I can also switch betweeen styles reasonably quickly.

Do the rule change completely? or are they variations? If they're variations then saving still be useful. You might end up with a style files that you used as a road rulesets template and vegetation ruleset template, and then modified these for the job at hand.

-ramon.

Hi Regis,

do you intend this :

"ImportProject is a plugin that lets you load layers from another project
file. Just select a project (.qgs) file,

check off the layers you wish to load, and it will include them in your
current project with all styling.

Works with vector, raster, database and web service layers."


Barry <barry.rowlingson at gmail.com>


?


I have a note :   in the Info panel, you have "CopyPasta" in the title   :)


And ,  you have right :  it should be insert under the "Project" menu, and
not only between "Plugins"   :)



BTW, Great !!!

Unfortunately, it throws error messages for me:

Adding a project with absolute paths and without tile layers works, so I 
suggest to catch these cases before the error message occurs.

The plugin Homepage is a little odd:

<http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/importLayersFromProject/>

calls this bug tracker page:

<http://hub.qgis.org/projects/ImportLayersFromProject>

which does not exist. From the plugin page inside QGIS, these pages are 
not accessible either. I think you messed up with "import" and "Import".

Andr? Joost

Thanks for the thoughts, Ramon.
The rules do change because I create the spontaneously. When I am QAing 
map compilations using various orthos, satellite imagery and whatever I 
have, the tone/clarity/resolution/ground colour changes as I pan accross 
the area, so I am changing the styles to (for that moment) suit the 
quality of the backdrop.
So what happens is, is that I might set up a "currently useful" rules 
based style, I then pan across the AOI, and get to an area that is 
tonally very different so I might switch single-symbol, and then a few 
minutes later go back to my rule-based - but then I have to set it up 
again (because I didn't manually save it).

The bigger picture:
What if the QGIS Dev Team considered creating a mapname.qgis file in the 
directory where the map is stored. When a map layer is deleted 
(removed), one could get a pop-up asking if the .qgis file should be 
deleted or not (or just leave it, so as not to be irritated by pop-ups 
each time you remove a layer)

The availability of this .qgis file is likely to then then inspire a 
host of other map-layer related uses (like the .prj file is for your 
project), but for me the currently useful one would be to stare the 
style-related states of the layer - ie: as you flip through the 5 style 
possibilities, you would not lose the most recent parameters you had set 
for any of the style options.

My 2c.

Regards,
Zoltan

Hi,

This is a long-standing feature request:

The ability to save more than one style and quickly select a different
version of the stored style definitions. This should only affect the
style and not the field widgets, filtering or other layer properties.

This is also required for certain WMS: For example the SIA 2045 WMS
standard in Switzerland requires to serve a color and a black-and-white
version of the same data.

So, there should be an arbitrary number of saved styles, also for the
same classification method, not just one style per classification method.

QGIS server should list all the available style sets and let the user
choose from one.

Is there already a feature request for this functionality at hub.qgis.org?

Andreas

Hey Andreas,

I was going to start working on adding export ability for just the style
part of the layer when I have some free time.  This would go half way
to achieving this goal.

Hi Nathan,

Yes it would be useful to let the user decide what parts of the layer
properties should be exported and imported.

Thanks for starting to work on this.

Hi,

How do you envisage to implement this?

Personally I would think it would be useful to have an export dialogue
where the user can choose (with checkboxes or a list widget) which
properties he wants to export:

* General properties (like the filtering, encoding, layer alias, scale
dependent visibility, CRS )
* Style properties
* Labeling properties
* Field properties (incl. display field properties)
* Actions
* Joins and Relations (see the new relations manager that Matthias
recently introduced)
* Diagrams
* Metadata

As a shortcut one should be able to export all at once without having to
press all checkboxes.

---------------

When importing, the importer of the layer properties should list what is
available in the .qml file and offer just the available bits of the
layer properties. Again - a short cut to import all layer properties
would be useful.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hey Andreas,

I'm not 100% yet.    I'm not sure what it is but I really hate the Load
Style../Save Style buttons at the bottom of the dialog.  I was thinking a
new page in the properties dialog would be better with the title
Import/Export.  For me this would mean not having a open another dialog,
which I really don't like the idea of, and we have more room to play with.

One of my goals is to be able to export just the style part in order to
expand the Style Manager to handle prebuilt styles.  I was planning on
adding some Save and Load buttons on the style tab that would just load the
style information from the .qml file.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Sale dependent visibility
Message-ID: <53131B85.4030905@carto.net>

Hi,

With the discussions around UX, layer properties import/export I also
want to question whether the "Scale dependent visibility" property
really belongs into the "General" tab of the layer properties or rather
in the "Style" tab. I personally would prefer the "Style" tab.

BTW: there is also the long-standing feature wish being able to have
multiple scale ranges per layer with different filtering, styles and
labeling for each scale range. Autodesk Map3D offers such functionality
where each layer property related to labeling and styling can have
multiple scale ranges.

This is somehow possible with rules and data-defined styling (with
expressions) - but it is neither very easy to do, nor does it generate a
proper legend, nor do you get a good overview of the style settings if
you go this route.

Andreas,

Something like this is what I was thinking. (With a better UI of course)

Hi,

If you just want to embed layers or groups from other projects - this
functionality already exists in core. Embedded layers are read-only
(which is good in some situations, but bad in others).

For situations where you want to change the layers, you can use the
ImportProject plugin as already mentioned. At this stage the layer would
be an independent layer not linked to the project imported from anymore.

Embedded layers that are still linked have to be read-only, otherwise
they have to be copies.

Hi Nathan,

Yes - I like the idea of a separate tab for import/export of layer
properties.

I guess the "Save style" would then be renamed to "Save Property"?

The only thing I am missing in this mockup is the ability to
check/uncheck all checkboxes. It is kind of boring having to uncheck a
lot of checkboxes if just want the styling or labeling.

Cool - looking forward to these improvements!

Just an implementation detail.  That is something I would add.

I like where it's going. Re check boxes, I'd love to see "intelligent"
switch buttons beyond "check all" "uncheck all". A "check styling only"
(symbology + label) button, a "check non - style only" button would be
really useful. Like some media players do to check audio only vs video &
audio.

+1 for the proposed mockup, which would be great to have.

Perhaps something could be added to the import/export panel : some place
where the user could access in one click the 5 last applied set of
properties ? This could be optionnal, but could help the user to switch
from one to another set of properties very easily. This means the user
would have the possibility to give each "set" a name, so that he can
distinguish sets. What about saving the couples name/set of properties in
QGIS project file, like

<sets_of_properties>
    <set name="one_set" datasource="./layerA_set_one_set.qset">
    <set name="another_set" datasource="dbname=some_database user=bla
password=*** table=styles id=1111">
</sets_of_properties


Anyway, the idea of letting the user choose the properties to save/restore
would be a great improvement without my proposal (which is a little bit off
topic).

Hi !

 I also want to question whether the "Scale dependent visibility" property

It could also be in the "rendering" tab, besides feature simplification,
which is also scale dependant (and feels lonely in its tab).

(is this thread supposed to be in qgis-ux only, or both in qgis-dev and
qgis-ux ?)

I have cross-posted to ux and developer, because this conversation seems 
to be running on both lists.Perhaps someone shopuld pull it from one of 
the lists?
Your call, but see my bottom-posted thoughts:

Please consider this methodolgy:
Currently, when QGIS loads a map layer, certain default things happen: 
Styles get assigned, etc etc.
As a maplayer is loaded (or perhaps only when the user changes something 
(like style)), QGIS should dump a [maplayername].qgis file, text format, 
perhaps keyword-value layout, into the directory that the map is stored. 
This file will then contain all the internal QGIS defaults, and of 
course updates to the current (style ) status, as the user changes them.
The benefits of using this implementation scheme could be vast:

  * For deployment purposes, users could create/edit this file outside
    of QGIS
  * QGIS Dev could implement a methodology whereby user scripts could
    read and write to this maplayer specific file - for example: map
    production information whilst capture staff are creating features.
  * This file could even be designed to live at the project level, and
    at the user level - this way departmental level defaults could be
    set (deployed), and for those users who need it, these could be
    over-ridden by having that filename als local to the user, but with
    user specific values.
  * Should any of these filenames only have some of the default
    keyword-values, QGIS could look for the other defaults at higher
    filename level (ie project level if user-level does not exist), or
    as currently, at the internally stored default actions.


The above implementation strategy would not need a special "export" menu 
as the information would then always be stored in a user useable file.
If this file becomes corrupt or nonsensical, QGIS actions could revert 
to the default internal actions.

As time goes by, I reckon QGIS developers would find many more uses for 
this map-layer specific file mechanism, should it be available.

Hope I'm making sense.

Kind regards,
Zoltan

* Working on a shared file store you are going to wreak all kinds of havoc

Hi

What version of apache does Jessie have? I posted a possibly similar
question [1] and had no response to it.

I suggest a slightly different approach (which may not be all that different once the details are? worked out?) 


A project stores lots of info about more items than just a layer... but I often want to add a layer with the same style, actions, label, etc settings to several projects, or just to the current canvas without changing what is already in the canvas.

Does it seem useful to others to be able to store such info in a "layer setup" file rather than a QGIS project file, so layers can be opened with all such info attached & optionally read on opening? 


Regards,

? Brent Wood

I'm running Jessie here and there, and bumped upon the following thing:

This stuff:
2.2 configuration:
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
becomes
2.4 configuration:
Require all denied

see:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html

I hope this is your problem too :-)

Brent,

Perhaps I have misunderstood your question, but I think you can achieve
this simply by "save style as default" . Every time you will use the layer
in any QGIS project, the default "style" (which mean the default properties
of the layer) would be applied.

Michael

Yeah iirc I had done that but still wasnt getting it to work. I have to
revisit the test machine I was using to give more details.

Hi Michael,

That is very close... (but does have a bug- #9687 - I can save a style, then try to load it for the same layer opened a second time & get an error:
 
"error occurred while parsing reference at line 113 column 155")

The line in the QML file is the action, which is appended to"labeling/shapeFillColorB" as well as an action later in the file.
<property key="labeling/shapeFillColorB" value="255"/>eom https://atlas.niwa.co.nz/login/SearchService?SERVICE_REQUEST_TYPE=100&SERVICE_REQUEST_USERID=833&SERVICE_REQUEST_ASSETID=[% "atlas_id" %]&SERVICE_REQUEST_PASSKEY=public"

(Change the Atlas_ID value to 247002 or 247224 & open the URL in a browser to see the result if you are interested - it is for a map layer of echosounder transects to retrieve the echogram from our image management tool via a web service)


Anyway, apart from the bug, as I understand it, that allows me to save a style, which can then be applied to a layer, but does not inlude the layer data source.


I'd like to be able to open a layer  (sort of like a virtual dataset in ogr) by opening the QGIS layer file, & have the layer load & all settings applied automatically. Currently I need to open a layer, open properties, select style, load style, apply style every time I load the layer.


Cheers,

Brent

Thanks Andr?, 
I will have a look at it, I just ported the plugin to 2.0 after having asked
the permission from Barry, but I admit I did very little tests! 
Geo DrinX, can you tell me if you're going to work on that? I'm planning my
budgets for the on-going year, and I have that on my list (low priority). I
would fund the checkbox in embed layer dialog, and maybe an option in open
project dialog to ask for opening as new or append to current project.
Opinions on that second option? I'm experimenting it in a French plugin
(create menu), and I must say it's quite convenient to add the whole
project, and drop the layers I don't need. This is pure ergonomy, maybe we
should discuss it in UX list

Hi Andrea, 
interesting feature. However, we should find a simple UI that keeps it
simple for common users (a dropdown "advanced" box) . I would use it a lot
(water courses and river are somewhat fractals and need special scale
dependent symbols).
I think we should share that with Martin Dobias who is thinking a legend
refactoring. Here we have a scale dependent legend. I other use cases, we
have data dependent legend. So IMHO, QGIS really need now another type of
legend, ie a legend generated on the base of the currently rendered
features. Data and expressions, and scale dependent symbol are not
predicatable, so we probably need to render the datas, and then render a
legend (except for determinist predefined legends)
Cheers
R?gis

Too true. But that's the same as if two users tried to edit the same map 
layer on a central server, from two different clients, so it would have 
to be implemented with the same locking or shared update mechanism that 
the map layer itself is enjoying.

Yes, there will always be situations where this won't work, but then 
QGIS could fall back to it's current methodology.

True - my fault. I work with simplistic file types (mainly shape-files), 
as my clients dictate what I have to capture and deliver in. This 
mechanism would work well for Shape files, because they don't support 
concurrent editing, and thus the .qgis file I am thinking of, would also 
not have to worry about concurrent updates.
Incidentally, I implemented exactly this sort of status tracking with 
scripts in my proprietary GIS package, and it worked really well, so, 
truth be told, I am missing this facility when using QGIS.

now I remember some other Debian specific thing, that took me some time
to find out: since a certain update the config files (or links in
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled have to have the .conf extention. I had an
old server which was upgraded, and my configs was named 'qgis.nl', I had
to rename it to qgis.nl.conf (and the 'require' fix').

Hi Martin,

The hangs are gone now with your fix. Also, the lag between feature
drawing and label drawing is much, much shorter now. Still noticeable
(as you also described) but very short.

The total rendering time is now subjectively shorter than before the
multi-threaded improvements.

Thank you for this fix.

Andreas

Hi all.
My situation is different: a clean install from our repo, on a clean
jessie machine, freshly installed, no custom config. According to our
tutorial, this should just work.
Thanks.

Hi Martin,
thanks for this. It helps, but my question remains: why should we reload
data, just to *disable* a layer from the legend?
All the best.

In order to remove a layer from a map, you simply need to redraw the
whole map _without_ that layer. The render caching helps by recording
image of each layer separately, so removing a layer from legend
requires just combining the rendered images together without the
removed one - without having to redraw also other layers. Maybe we
should just make render caching default.

Martin

Martin, maybe render caching should be turned/forced on by default on qgis
master builds right now so there can be a higher of ppl using it and
reporting possible regressions? If it's now smooth and problem-free
following mtr merge, it can be left on by default for final 2.4 release.

Hi, just tested with cache enabled and multi cpu . 
Memory do not stop increasing on each new rendering, from 240 Mo starting
with no upper limit. 
With cache disabled, I also face memory growth, but very slow, and probably
related to only some drawing actions (labels or raster? not sure). 
Cheers,
R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] virtual fields
Message-ID: <5314966F.6010408@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was wondering about the idea of being able to create simple views in 
QGIS, "views" in terms of database.
Often, I use views (in postgres) to be able to create labels, title, 
simple calculation or whatever and also to combine data from joined tables.

Somehow, all is already there in QGIS but in distinct features:
- joins which will add the fields of the joined table to the main table
- expressions are used in many places where views are meaningful: 
labels, styling, search, etc.
- field calculation

I was thinking that these features should be grouped and improved in 
what could be called virtual fields -- so basically a "live" field 
calculation without writing to the provider.

First, the idea would be to define virtual fields using expressions.

Then, it should be made possible to integrate the joined fields in qgis 
expressions without adding them to the current attributes (as it is now).
One way to to it could be a function: joinField( joinName, joinedFieldName)
Hence, the user would be allowed to choose which joined fields he really 
wants to be accessible in the layer.

I believe this is a deep refactoring of the fields behavior, isn't it?
This could be a chance to clean up the joins, which I believe are a bit 
messy now.

This is totally above my skills and somehow my available time, but I 
would have (a part of) funding for this.

What do you think of this idea?
Would it be "easily"achievable without breaking the API?
Would you be interested in taking part of the dev?

Cheers,

Denis

Hello,

I have a very strange issue on Windows 7 with web views in attributes form.

I opened a ticket for that [1] but nobody has answered. Maybe I'm the only
one who has this issue? If you are on Win 7, could you please test and
confirm (or not) the issue.

Thank you very much.

Hi Denis,

I proposed this a couple of years ago:
http://osdir.com/ml/qgis-user-gis/2011-07/msg00313.html

But no-one dared to implement it until now.

Meanwhile the expressions are almost like "virtual columns" - but for
some purposes it would still be good to have (e.g. in forms, for QGIS
server outputting calculations, etc.). I can also see virtual columns
that are aggregates of linked tables (e.g. the sum/min/max of linked
records).

So I would also like to support such a development if someone wants to
do the work.

I also need this for TopoGeometry columns, in that often
TopoGeometry are referenced by "id" but no such attribute
as "id" exists.

In this case the expression would need to run in the database,
and the "virtual field" would be injected automatically rather
than being selected by the user.

I have thought about this functionality before and I think it should
be relatively easy to add this functionality. The
QgsVectorLayerFeatureIterator could simply compute the values of the
virtual fields according to their definition in QgsVectorLayer. It
should automatically work lazily - if the field is not requested, it
would not be evaluated.

Do we actually need such functionality? Wouldn't it be enough to hide
the attributes you don't want?

On a similar note see this recent thread [1] which should be able to 
provide this kind of functionality. I don't know if Nahtan has already 
started to implement his POC.

Hi

I have many people asking for this kind of "virtual fields". The first time
I show people the field calculator during curses, people often tell me :

* I have done a mistake, how can I change the formula and see the result
updated ? -> they often compare this feature to the excel formula
* I do not want to create a new column, just use it for labelling/styling .
I answer them "Just use expressions in the label/style pannel" and they
answer back "But how can I preview the results in the attribute table for
all features before ?"

This is definitely a nice feature to have. We must take performance into
account though, for big datasets.

cheers
Michael

Hi list, 


I have a plugin where I choose a layer from a comboBox. 


How can I get the layer path and directory name in the code? 


For example, in order to get the layer name and use it in the code, I use: 



layer_name = ftools_utils.getVectorLayerByName(self.comboBox.currentText()) 


Is there something to get the layer path and directory name? 


Thanks.

I thought it might allow to clean the code related to joined fields by 
moving it to QgsExpression evaluation.
I don't know really well how it's implemented, but I just notice that 
there has been many bugs on a long period.
If you think it should be kept separated, ok for me!

Cheers,

Denis

What would be the advantage of such a beast?

I think this was a change implemented in Apache 2.4 at least on
Debian/Ubuntu variants. I too have had to add the .conf to the end of
vhost config files.

Not sure about dis- and atvantages. I just thought I'd throw it in :-)

Honestly: injecting expression fields at the vectorlayeriterator level 
sounds like a good and flexible approach. There are quite a few tools 
which still operate on vlayer.provider.getFeatures() etc. Those will 
unfortunately not be able to benefit from such an approach.
The virtual layer approach discussed in the other thread is more like a 
Swiss army knife for a couple of different things.

I didn't spend much thoughts on all of this, please read it with a 
pinch of salt.

Hey all,

The SQLite virtual table thing and these virtual fields are two different
beasts.  Both should be features.  Virtual columns should be a easy-ish one
so lets start with that.   The advantage of using SQLite virtual tables is
it would give us a high level SQL language with all the spatial functions
and the ability to do joins over any QGIS layer without too much work on
our side.  No point reinventing the wheel.   It can be slow for complex
things but if you are doing that you should move to a proper database
engine and store all your data in there.

Hi all.
Upon installation, LizMap compiles (in temp/) all its paths. When moving
to a different virtualhost, the app is therefore no longer working. Of
course I can change all the paths by hand, but this is boring and error
prone. Is there a way of recompiling it automagically?
Thanks.

Hi paolo,

LizMap is based on Jelix. http://docs.jelix.org/en/manual-1.4
In the temp/ directory of the application you can find a lizmap 
directory. Doesn't remove it but remove all its content to have a clean 
install.

The explaination is here :
http://docs.jelix.org/en/manual-1.4/create-application
   You have also a new directory temp/myapp, where all cached files 
generated by Jelix will be stored.

Regards,
Ren?-Luc D'Hont

Hi all.
Thanks for the replies. For the record, the solution is:
a2enmod cgi
If you do not want to enable cgi for the whole server, add to the single
site:

 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
 <Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin">
         AllowOverride None
         Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
        Require all granted
 </Directory>

All the best.

Hi list,

I'm currently implementing an edit form with a lot of fields and I've got
some ideas to improve the user experience. What about to offer some new
features in the layer fields options, like those ones:

- Set a default value (text, checkbox, date, list, etc.)
- Set the order of the items in a values list
- Set a field as mandatory and highlight it if empty (or even better, get
constraint from the data provider)

What do you think?

Thank you for your feedback.

+1, very useful . If possible, get it from the provider if possible
(database)

I usually use a separated CSV file, and the value relation field type, so
that I can order alphabetically.

Hi

For me these are questions which are part of a bigger topic, namely the 
decoupling of the graphical representation (editor widget) and the 
field definitions. I think they are treated as one thing currently 
because they are defined in the same tab in the layer properties.
The main reason for decoupling them is, that they are then better 
available for other parts of the code/python plugins as well (e.g. add

Message-ID: <8771A6C267F35440AA2A82DE6EBE9EC536B4F97D@EXMAILBOX.dag.aeag.fr>

Hi All,
I'm currently installing QGIS 2.2 in my administration, and suddenly discovered an (new ?) behaviour.
We put some "mandatory" plugins on a network drive, and every client is open with the environnement variable QGIS_PLUGINPATH to use that centralized place.
Problem occurs when upgrading a plugin there. Default conf of the QGIS clients activates the plugins, but it seems that the installer checks if the version has changed, and if yes, deactivates the plugin.
That means QGIS stores detailed informations about installed plugin somewhere, but I couldn't find it in .ini (or registry key). Anyone knows how it works?
Secondly, this implies that I don't know how to manage those plugins, since they will be unloaded by default... Any idea on how to do that?

Cheers
R?gis

Hi,

now QGIS has multithreaded rendering but seems QGIS server still not updated
and qgis_bench too. Are there any plans to update both to use all advantages of
multiple cores?

 Answering to myself.

Please ignore the thread, the error was due to a renaming of plugin directories names, I wasn't aware of.

For a centralized repo its recommended to use a webserver with an xml
file like the one described here:
http://www.qgisworkshop.org/html/workshop/repositories.html

Then you just give QGIS the url to that xml file and it handles the
detection of newer versions whenever the server gets updates.

I'm not 100% sure but qgis might not check the version of current
plugins until you open the updater tool. Maybe one of the devs can chime
in if it's stored in a file somewhere, I guarantee it's not a registry
item since thats not cross platform. List of plugins is in QGIS.conf
(location varies by OS) with a true/false for activation but not the
version of the plugins.

Thanks,
Alex

You are right, something is amiss. I can't tell which Redmine plugin is
supposed to handle that. I expected to see something like the Gitosis
plugin but there's only a post-commit hook and a qgis customization
plugin. Neither of which integrate with git keys on the back end.

Did someone change the configuration of Redmine?

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alex, 
a xml repository is not exactly what I need, since those plugins must be
activated without any user action, and centralized to ease upgrade and save
some disk space. 
Anyway QGIS_PLUGINPATH does exactly what I need, and a good script on
sessions opening to maintain qgis.ini is enough for me. 
Cheers
R?gis

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-bbTND7UwDNgjYfwLWWh9M5JG1c51172ur5E1Au0QOLw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Martin, et al.,

Maybe I'm missing something elemental here, but I can't seem to find a
simple way to apply my built-up QgsMapSettings to QgsMapCanvas or
QgsMapRenderer, initiate a render from Python, then save into image on disk.

This is what I would like to do (for simple screen-res renders):

cnv = iface.mapCanvas()
ms = cnv.mapSettings()  <-- or create fresh: ms = QgsMapSettings()
(manipulate map settings)
cnv.applyMapSettings(ms)  <-- shouldn't this be possible?
cnv.refresh()  <-- since cnv.map().render() is stubbed now
cnv.saveAsImage(my_imgpath)

This is functioning (for creating unit test control images), but seems
excessive:

ms = my_map_settings
pal = QgsPalLabeling()
pal.init(ms)  <-- is this necessary?
r = QgsMapRenderer()
r.setLabelingEngine(pal)

# couldn't the next lines be covered by a r.applyMapSettings(ms) function?
r.setOutputSize(ms.outputSize(), ms.outputDpi())
r.setMapUnits(ms.mapUnits())
r.setExtent(ms.extent())
r.setProjectionsEnabled(ms.hasCrsTransformEnabled())
r.setDestinationCrs(ms.destinationCrs())
r.setLayerSet(ms.layers())

image = QImage(ms.outputSize(), QImage.Format_ARGB32)
image.fill(ms.backgroundColor().rgb())
image.setDotsPerMeterX(ms.outputDpi() / 25.4 * 1000)
image.setDotsPerMeterY(ms.outputDpi() / 25.4 * 1000)

p = QPainter(image)
r.render(p)
p.end()
image.save(my_imgpath, 'png'):


This is already convenient in QgsComposition, using QgsComposition( const
QgsMapSettings& mapSettings ), then just render the page.

Any ideas on the best approach here?

Regards,

Larry

if you are using a PostGIS db you can try my plugin DataDrivenInputMask

if a not null constraint is defined on a field, changes cannot be 
submitted if the field is still empty; null fields are indicated

Allright then what is the working procedure to upload a plugin
other than having an external git repo.
Besides given that you have to upload to an external
server how can you modify your repository configuration
inside hub.qgis.org to point to your external repo?

thank you!

Hi to all,
I'm trying to realize a little plugin to install python modules on windows
via pip.

In first, I would like make a simple thing:
Run get-pip.py inside the plugin  but I encounter two different problem:

What is the shell to call? (Please, don't mind If I point at dufour, is my
qgis crushtest dummy )

subprocess.call('C:\\PROGRA~2\\QGISDU~1\\Osgeo4W.bat python get-pip.py')

or

subprocess.call('"C:\Program Files (x86)\QGIS Dufour\OSGeo4W.bat python
get-pip.py')

Apparently they are the same, but if I install something through  python
inside one, I cannot import the module inside the other.

So, what's the right way to call inside a python plugin the shell?

I found also some problems in using subprocess on windows, and I'm
developping using QProcess class.

Second question:
If I run
subprocess.call('"C:\Program Files (x86)\QGIS Dufour\OSGeo4W.bat python
get-pip.py')

I receive: Nothing distributions at all found fo install...

So the solution are easy: distribute qgis with pip and easy_install inside,
or install pip and easy_intall from shell as I did, then we can use the
plugin as you check out in my screenshots:
[0]

So, if you have suggestions plese let me know.

Best regards
Luca

Subject: [Qgis-developer] C++ plugin setMapTool access violations
Message-ID: <CAGmLy+85-apjqD==AiEui8aP-nwj63UA36sZmo2djhg2xH6wTA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,



Since I upgraded my C++ plugin code from 1.8 to 2.x and started building
against the 2.01 and 2.2 release code, the plugin has been experiencing
access violations when switching from my plugin's to any of the built-in
map tools (0xC0000005, "The thread tried to read from or write to a virtual
address for which it does not have the appropriate access.").  All it takes
to trigger a crash is to enable any of my map tools, then click on any QGIS
map tool--boom. This happens only when I run the plugin with the official
standalone or OSGeo4W binaries on Windows. It will **not** happen when the
plugin runs in my own QGIS binaries built from the 2.2 (or any other 2.x)
release code in Visual Studio 2008. The access violation occurs somewhere
deep in QGIS and I cannot debug it because it won't happen in my own build.



Have there been any changes since 1.8 that may explain these crashes and
that I may have missed? I would be most grateful for any suggestions or
leads that might help me get to the bottom of this crippling issue.



Cheers,

Hartmut

Hi,
 what I usually do, if the purpose is to only send a message to the user, is
having an unfixed semi transparent annotation in the MapCanvas.

I also configured a default project on startup having such an annotation,
that is always displayed on screen, including when users do screenshots:

** Project description:
    author:
    context of use and constraints:
***

We could imagine to use OWS project properties to store such informations..
By now, the annotation is enough for me. 
Cheers

None that come into mind.   Does it also occur with the master build (qgis-dev
is build in RelWithDebInfo mode)?   Is your code available somewhere?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PostGIS raster access in QGIS using DBManager (or
	wktraster)
Message-ID: <000d01cf3880$472fad70$d58f0850$@jrc.ec.europa.eu>

Dear Developers,

I am using QGIS 2.2 .0 (Valmiera) and trying to load a raster query result
via DBManager, using the following query:

select 1 as rid, st_union(st_band(rast, '4,3,2') ) as rast
from o_8_lc81970232013202lgn00_all_rds_sub, gemeentegebieden
where gemeentegebieden.wkb_geometry && rast
and gemnaam = 'Veendam' 

(in short: Band 4,3,2 of a Landsat-8 image (overview 8 version) for a
"gemeente" polygon (administrative commune boundary).

Execute (F5) correctly returns a single row. 

When I try to "Load as a new layer" to visualise the result in QGIS, I get
the following error message:

Erroneous query: SELECT DISTINCT upper(geometrytype("rast")),st_srid("rast")
FROM (select 1 as rid, st_union(st_band(rast, '4,3,2') ) as rast
from o_8_lc81970232013202lgn00_all_rds_sub, gemeentegebieden
where gemeentegebieden.wkb_geometry && rast
and gemnaam = 'Veendam' 
) AS "subQuery_0" returned 7 [ERROR:  function geometrytype(raster) does not
exist
LINE 1: SELECT DISTINCT upper(geometrytype("rast")),st_srid("rast") ...
                              ^
HINT:  No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need
to add explicit type casts.
]

Apparently, my query get "wrapped"  in the SELECT DISTINCT outer query above
(which obviously does not work).

Is this a known issue, and, if so, can it be modified, for instance by
providing explicitly geometrytype and srid (and if so, how?).

I also checked out the wktraster plugin, but that does not work for 2.2. Is
an upgrade expected soon [or should I try writing it myself].

Thanks for all the wonderful stuff,

Guido Lemoine

Subject: [Qgis-developer] pyuic4 and ui files in subfolder
Message-ID: <53173C4F.2090802@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have been annoyed by a small problem for a while without finding a 
solution for it.

In my plugins, I place all the ui files in a subfolder named ui.
The resources file is at the root folder.

So, in the ui file I have
<iconset resource="../resources.qrc">

But when I compile, I got in the python file (also located in ui folder):
import resources_rc
which gives an error, because it can't find the resource files.

What would be the solution to this (something else than moving the file)?

My makefile is like this:
UI_SOURCES=$(wildcard ui/*.ui)
UI_FILES=$(join $(dir $(UI_SOURCES)), $(notdir $(UI_SOURCES:%.ui=%.py)))
RC_SOURCES=$(wildcard *.qrc)
RC_FILES=$(join $(dir $(RC_SOURCES)), $(notdir $(RC_SOURCES:%.qrc=%_rc.py)))

$(UI_FILES): ui/%.py: ui/%.ui
     pyuic4 -o $@ $<

$(RC_FILES): %_rc.py: %.qrc
     pyrcc4 -o $@ $<

Is it a problem of my rules or a pyuic problem?

Thanks,

Denis

This is a limit of the pyuic4 compiler. When it parses resources it doesn't
consider relative paths.
I generally keep a "proxy" module inside the ui folder, named as the ui
compiled module wants (e.g. resources_rc). In this module a do all my
imports from other packages/modules.

So how can access the label toolbar?

Thanks for the immediate reply, J?rgen. I appreciate your help.
I've tried the master branch, and also a release build of my plugin; both
display the same crashes I described in my orignal message.
The code isn't published anywhere, but you can certainly see it if you are
willing to take a look at it. I can zip it up and send it (probably best
off list).
Thanks again,
Hartmut

Hi J?rgen,

Thank you very much, it worked.

By the way, do you know if there is a reason that only this toolbar is not
accessible QgisInterface?

Probably just because nobody added it (the (new) labeling once was a plugin).
But is it really the only one?

You didn't add the changelog entry for raring (INSTALL 3.8), right?

Hello everybody,

Well, I'm trying to put my plugin (transectizer) beyond the 
'experimental box' of plugins and thus improving it a little and, of 
course, fix its many problems.

One of this problems concerns the visibility of the plugin itself. I've 
decide to make it a dockable widget rather than a floating dialog, 
mainly because the plugin needs canvas interaction and the dialog goes 
to the back of the main QGIS dialog when clicking the canvas. Also, 
because many transects can be defined one after the other, it looks more 
fancy to have the dialog docked and always visible. Forcing the user to 
click in the taskbar again and again doesn't look like a nice idea.

Anyway, I've detected two behaviors that I'm not sure that they are 
intended/desired:

1) Even when the user 'shuts down' the docked widget, it looks like the 
plugin is still loaded and working and it has just been hidden (when I 
used the single dialog approach, the plugin just get closed and destroyed).

2) I can't figure out how to add the panel to the panels menu (in linux 
it's under Settings->Panels, I think in windows it changes and don't 
know about Mac), and in fact I don't know if it is a desirable feature 
(maybe it is reserved to non-experimental plugins or featured ones)


In both cases... Are they the expected and desirable behaviors? Human 
Interface Guidelines don't say much about this. Regarding to this, HIG 
discourage the use of stacked widgets, but... What about toolboxes (like 
tab widgets but with a more 'vertical' design?

And one last question... I think I've read about 'proper' icons for 
plugins, etc. I think someone was 'in charge' of this and I would like 
to ask about this to someone, providing there aren't (AFAIK) 
documentation about this topic.

Thank you very much, have a nice day

Jorge Tornero

I don't know what's the ongoing progress on this topic but I think that a
system for the dependencies management should be embedded inside QGIS. I'm
not in favour for a plugin to do that.
Having an integrated pip would be more transparent to the user and the
plugin developers. The developer should only provide a requirements file
which should be transparently managed by the QGIS' Python system.
I heard that Nathan is working on something similar?

In my opinion, a much simpler and cleaner approach (at least from the point
of view of a normal user), would be to allow, in QGis Windows (standalone
installer), the user not to point to (or not install) an internal Python,
but to refer to an external installation. For instance, to point to a
Python installed via Python(x,y), where there is already a plenty of
modules installed and it is very easy to install/update via
pip/easy_install and so on.

But I'm not sure if some Python modules are customized to be compatible
with QGIS Windows interface: for instance, some months ago, I tried
unsuccessfully to update, via copy-and-paste from the Python(xy) site
packages, numpy to a more recent version than the one available in Qgis
(don't remember if 1.8 or 2.0).

Windows doesn't ship with any version of Python. Yay Windows!  So we bundle
our own.  I personally don't mind this so much because it's easier to
control the setup if we bundle it.

The main thing here is just including pip and easy_install in all the
windows installs, standalone and osgeo4w.  Jurgen has told me that
easy_install is included in the 64 bit versions but not 32 bit versions. Is
that correct Jurgen?

If pip is included we can easily have plugins tell us what they need and we
can install them.

Hello all,


as in object, I had an error from  RealCentroid plugin  in  QGis 2.2  on
Windows 7  64 bit.

This is the error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/rrr/.qgis2/python/plugins\realcentroid\realcentroid.py",
line 124, in run
    self.centroids()
  File "C:/Users/rrr/.qgis2/python/plugins\realcentroid\realcentroid.py",
line 93, in centroids
    x2 = part[1][0]
IndexError: list index out of range


Of course, the resulting centroid layer is empty   :(


Somebody can help me to understand what happens ?


Thanks a lot and Regards

+1, this is exactly what I was imaging.
A requirements.txt for pip would be all that a dev should write.

That would require it to contain a PyQt4 build against a compatible Qt.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SQL Injection vulnerability
Message-ID: <CAFO80_oZo7Fcc6_82Xq_UyneFfPqswgXJ=-+U4Q-Ajh1nxhyBg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was expanding saveStyle functionality in spatialite provider using the
same code model used in PostgreSQL provider.
Reading the c++ code of the provider I figure out a possible vulnerability
to SQL Injections.

QGIS PostgreSQL provider [1] extensively use of two internal functions to
prevent injection

[2] QString QgsPostgresConn::quotedValue( QVariant value )

and

[3] QString QgsPostgresConn::quotedIdentifier( QString ident )



but they quote only ' or \ so they are -not- enough to a complete sql
injection protection [4]


every DB have it's internal functions to manage this cases, but better
use parametrized queries as in many parts of the provider... but not
in all parts.


using parametrized queries need an extensive rewrite of providers... a
intermediate approach is to add specific quote_* call in the above
functions


let me know what do you think

+1, this would be great (we currently manage and bundle deps in MetaSearch
as a workaround).

- we would have to make sure the requirements file is standardized
   (others may have different / additional ones, like requirements-dev.txt,
   pip-requirements.txt, etc.).

- for MetaSearch, the requirements.txt file never makes it to the QGIS
   runtime, so plugin providers would need to make sure it does

Hi

The only gotcha to this is that different plugins might require different
versions of dependencies. We also toyed around in the past with the idea of
each plugin having its own virtualenv for deps and then linking in the QGIS
provided site_packages dir into that virtualenv too.

Regards

Hello,

I have created a pull request that should fix all inconsistencies/bugs in
WMS GetFeatureInfo response, one for master and one for relese-2_2 branch.
I wasn't able to test mapserver from current master cause it is probably
broken, but the same changes in release2_2 branch works as expected.

Master branch: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1227
Release-2_2 branch: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1226

Marcel

This would be great because it would solve the problem of users not being

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [FeedBack] import a DB with QGIS styles table
Message-ID: <2589502.AfkidKxEGu@tatras>

Hi,

I would like to share a feedback on an issue on layer style in DB. 

One user wanted to migrate his database from pgsql 8.4 to pgsql 9.x. (the 
postgresql release is not important). He get some issue when importing the 
dump:

ERREUR:  invalid XML content
LINE 1: ...ion', 'communaute_communes54', 'the_geom', 'v40', '<!DOCTYPE...
                                                             ^
DETAIL:  line 1: StartTag: invalid element name
<!DOCTYPE qgis PUBLIC 'http://mrcc.com/qgis.dtd' 'SYSTEM'>

Googling about this, it seems that we can't import a DB with qgis layer style 
easily when a column is of XML type with a doctype inside. Even if the xml is 
valid.

The correct way is to SET XML option to DOCUMENT this way:

SET XML OPTION DOCUMENT;

before the insert statement.

Hope it can help someone later!

Y.

or we can manage a
- light way (light in the plugin point of view) with simple requirement.txt
(or whatever)
or a
- robust and idependent way managing virtualenv
or a

+1 for a virtualenv approach. -1 if virtualenv is *not* the basis of the
implementation.

The last thing users need is to download/install a plugin just to test it
out, then have it automatically muck about with their global or user Python
installation.

I think starting with a single app-wide virtualenv backend and pip-based
GUI installer/manager for all plugins and console, first, would be prudent.
Then, implement per-plugin virtualenv if that goes well.

Wouldn't per-plugin virtualenv reek havoc in the console, where global
access to plugins is often very useful?

I think, as a starting point, reviewing PyCharm's simple module manager and
virtualenv creator would be good for including something similar in Plugin
Manager, or as an independent dialog [0].

I would like also suggest that the installation of python modules it is not
necessary linked to a plugin, but also for every experiment we want make
through the python console. Ut is usefull keep it on mind for the futures

Thank you J?rgen, I feel safer ;) but... I can't figure out how postgres
quote_* methods manage "--" Comments or String without Quotes that can
break SQL statement or introduce elements that can't be escaped...

I would appreciate opinions by DB experts because looking around all says
that escaping it's not enough.

Hi Gino,

are you worried about functions exposed by QGIS Mapserver or by the
desktop?

Yes, this was the main downside we (Martin Dobias and myself) thought of
when considering this idea some time ago. But with the current situation it
is also possible to have interference between plugins (e.g. if more than
one plugins has a top level package called 'utils' the package which will
actually get loaded may be not the expected one). One simple work around
with the virtual env approach would be that we have a global plugins
virtual env (as you suggested above) and a per plugin virtual env which is
optional. In metadata.txt, a plugin could nominate itself to be part of the
global plugins venv (and thus have access to and be accessible by other
plugins, but also vulnerable to changes to package versions made by other
plugins) or in a private venv (in which case it would have access only to
the app site-packages). I would include core plugins in the global QGIS
site-packages so that e.g. processing is always available no matter what.

Yeah they have a neat implementation (though it is probably all done in
java so no cut  & paste coding for us :-( ).

QGIS Server does it's own escaping and filters allowed characters and words
in filters.

Yes, but it does some sanity checks.

quotedValue puts ' around the value and duplicates all inner ' so that they are
not interpreted as quotes that end the string, but as quotes inside the string
and also duplicates backslashes so that they are interpreted as backslashes
instead of giving the following character a special meaning.

What else is there to handle?

AFAIK in a SLD style should never be put a direct sql string.
The SQL is at datasource level for dataset filter and this is a question 
outside from the style.

In the style should be put only some filter for classifications.
This is more affordable with the CQL rather than SQL.

Apart from this,
in the SQL the more suitable character for sql injection is the ; char

The ; char is the break for every command and so
it allow some trick.

As example:

string= ";delete from <name-table>;"
with the ; ias first char is capable usually to do work this string also 
in a system where it
is is a concatenation in

'select * from table-2 where (' || string || ');'

it became:

'select * from table-2 where ( ;delete from <name-table>; );'

a dbms that try to execute this will do an error of-course, because

select * from table-2 where ( ;

is an error, but after this it could execute the

delete from <name-table>;

and this is not an error.

my 2 ct.

Andrea.

You are right - so sorry! I got it to build ok following the steps

Just a remark:

dch requires the devscripts package but that is not explained in INSTALL.
 Is that required for ubuntu only? If not this dependency be added to
INSTALL

$ dch -l ~raring  --force-distribution --distribution raring "raring build"

The program 'dch' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt-get install devscripts


regards,
Etienne

Are you trying to upload a release of your plugin or looking to host the
source code and bug tracker of the plugin?

Release of plugins is handled separately via plugins.qgis.org

What you've pointed out is a bug that the admins need to figure out why
something changed. I have a working repo key with hub as do many others,
so the interface was there at some point. I'm copying the person who
originally setup the site to see if they know what's going on.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi everyone,

Digital Mapping Solutions, and myself, would like to announce the first
version of IntraMaps Roam - a simple, but flexible, Windows based data
collection application built using Python and QGIS.

IntraMaps Roam (or Roam for short) is a standalone, fully bundled, Python
application that was created to do data collection with a QGIS backend.
 For those of you who have seen my QMap project I started a year or so ago
you can consider this a reincarnation of that project. Most of the code has
been reworked and using the QGIS libs gave me full flexibility in layout.

The release page can be found at
https://github.com/DMS-Aus/Roam/releases/tag/v2.0 and the wiki with all the
information to get started at: https://github.com/DMS-Aus/Roam/wiki You can
also take a look at the FAQ for the common questions:
https://github.com/DMS-Aus/Roam/wiki/FAQ

Roam has been a great exercise in using and bundling QGIS libs with a
Python application.

As Roam is based on PyQt and QGIS it is under the GPL2 license. Pull
requests are welcome.

Happy mapping!

Nathan

Hi Nathan,
thanks for this. Why is this for Win only?
All the best.

There isn't really a lot of Windows only things in the code itself, well
nothing that can't be abstracted away, but I mainly dev on Windows and so
are most of our clients so that was our first priority.  The build scripts
should be flexible enough to use something something py2so or py2app for
Linux and OS X.  Happy for a pull request if people got it working on those
platforms, I just have more experience on Windows and little time :)  It
can also run from the src folder but might need some tweaks for a non
windows setup i.e I assume a OSGeo4W folder setup for paths, but that is
just a if statement to change.

great Nathan... this can be a good platform where to insert a future mobile
use for Geosisma

can we plan to transform/fork/ it in a sort of framework? I'm going to test
it :)

Hello,
Thanks a lot Nathan for this work !
Note that we at Oslandia are working on a new PostGIS / Spatialite versionning 
and offline system, intended to be used by Roam to edit data offline and merge it 
with online PostGIS database.
A prototype should be opensourced in the next weeks/month. We will keep you 
posted.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] My God: plugin palette disappeared :(
Message-ID: <CAFF9ZhvLb4WGtKWPMZeM-CQYOWXVEbPFWjXtwdmDv2fi3=h8xw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,


this morning I had a bad surprise in my QGis 2.2 64 bit  on  Windows 7 :

the plugin palette disappeared, and there is no way to find it, or to make
it reappear.


Someone other had same problem ?

I have seen in   View > Tools  >  Plugins   checkbox, but it is checked  (
ON ).

I have also seen in  "Impostazioni" > "Personalizzazione"  (sorry, my QGis
is in italian...)  and  "Toolbars"  "mPluginToolBar"   is also ON.

But,  the plugin toolbar  is not shown, in any place.

I moved all other Toolbar, to search if the Plugins toolbar was hidden
under another.   No.   It is probably in the "HiperSpace"   :)


Also, I tried to re-install completely  QGis 2.2.  :   nothing changed.


Could somebody help me.    Need I to switch to some other Arc program   ?
  ;)

I am joking, but I don't know how to use QGis, now,   also to test my own
plugins  :(


Thank you for any help

Roberto

What is a plugin palette? Do you mean the toolbar?

Can you provide a screenshot of your running QGIS.

Have you tried right clicking on the blank space in the toolbar area and
checking if it is enabled.

Did you maybe accidentally drag it and drop it somewhere and it is
displaying in compressed mode?

I'm not sure if your life will be any better in Arc* :-P

Tim

There is a broad similarity in that both parties (as below) are 
generally wrong

(would be) proprietary software user think they've got someone to take 
their problems to.
(would be) opensource software users think they haven't

Hi Tim,

You mention something that awoke me here ha.  I teach intro to GIS at a
local college this term, and of course I am using QGIS (1.8, yes I know
old, but I am lucky to have anything installed in their locked down
environment).  The one problem that the students face constantly, and
the one problem I cannot solve, yet, is when they do something like you
just mentioned: they drag and drop a dialog somewhere, close it, undock
it, or I'm not sure what they are doing exactly...and then anytime they
start GIS on that same machine that dialog is no where to be found (and
for the life of me I cannot find how to turn it back on for them).  I
have struggled all term with this.  One example are the Properties
dialog windows in the Print Composer - students do something it seems to
close these, and they can never be seen ever again.

I know, maybe this is solved in QGIS 2.2, but I just wanted to give you
this feedback.  I love QGIS, but this one thing keeps coming back to
bite me in the butt.  Ha.

Talk soon my friend,

-jeff

Hi Jeff,

Apologies for jumping into your conversation with Tim, but that issue with
1.8 was fixed before the 2.0 release [0]. I recommend, if possible, finding
a means of your students running 2.0.1 or 2.2.0, where a user can now just
select the items under the View menu. There are a couple workarounds for
1.8 listed on the issue page, however.

If it is some dialog disappearing in the main app, that is probably a
separate issue.

Larry

This problem is some ways exists in both Arc and QGIS. Students make a
toolbar disappear and can't seem to get it back. Sometimes you just need
to re-enable it in the View->Toolbars

But often what you need to do is reset the GUI back to defaults which
can be done by clearing out the QGIS.conf file. Note doing this will
also destroy stored databases links and web service urls. Good news is
that you can save out those parts of the text and add them back in.

Where to find the QGIS.conf file varies by OS and install method.

Thanks,
Alex

This might be better:

#!/usr/bin/python
from PyQt4.QtCore import QSettings
QSettings( "QGIS", "QGIS2" ).remove( "/UI/state" )
QSettings( "QGIS", "QGIS2" ).remove( "/ComposerUI/state" )


(for 1.8 it's QGIS instead of QGIS2 IIRC).

Seems like adding a tool/plugin/command to reset GUI to defaults should
be easy.

In addition to the other responses to this message, you could also prep by
getting your QGIS install into an ideal stage (UI layout wise) and then
close QGIS. Then use regedit and navigate to:

Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\QuantumGIS

Then right click on that entry in the tree in the left and chose export.

Save the .reg file as RestoreQGISState.reg on the desktop (or similar).

Now when a royal stuff up occurs, the user can just double click that file
(close QGIS first), then open QGIS and it should be restored to default.

See you in CT in July!

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <CAO_8yh0vuRaP=fDNA2_t5=6QOSDMOPDrfBNYihBtix8TBieBaQ@mail.gmail.com>

hello,
using "save as" function from layer to export to dxf from a vector polygon
I ran into 2 issues:
1) export version of dxf cannot be opened by autocad 2009 unless converted by a
more recent version of autocad: wouldn't it be nice to have dxf
version to choose?
2) Polygon Vector gets exported only as hatching and not as polylines
which would
be the right way to export to dxf format.

at the moment for issue 2) there's a workaround: converting polygons
to lines function from Vector -->Geometry tools and then export to
dxf, but the issue 1)
still remains

While this is true, both the 10.7+ and 1.0.6 nightlies are currently built
against William's frameworks. In the event his supporting frameworks will
not install for 10.6, that nightly will be suspended. The nightlies are
very 'bare bones' for running unit test suites and for testers to help
debug the core application. They are a far cry from the out-of-the-box,
heavily bundled installers from William, and the nightlies should not be
considered, or recommended, as a production tool.

On the brighter side, the OSGeo4Mac project [0] (a 'tap' for Homebrew) is
coming along nicely, with about a 90% feature parity with William's
framework builds. I have not tested a full build (QGIS and Processing
supporting installs) under 10.6 yet, but it looks like I should do this
ASAP. If anyone knows how to use Homebrew, they can give it a try
themselves, basically without having to read QGIS's INSTALL doc.

These are the pending changes that will affect future nightlies:

1)  Move to using OSGeo4Mac as the basis for 10.6 and 10.7+ nightly builds
2)  Continue an additional 10.7+ nightly built off of William's frameworks
3)  Add new modules to QGIS (in parallel to current) to leverage CMake's
built-in bundling utilities
4)  Implement pull request #1804: Add objective-c++ interface to Mac Cocoa
libraries [1]
5)  Add Sparkle framework (hopefully goes well) to allow for in-app,
auto-download/install updates

Reasoning for these steps:

1) Since Homebrew offers support for 'bottled' builds (pre-built binaries),
the nightly 'downloads' can be just moved to bottles, and Homebrew can
automate their installation. Such bottles, especially for supporting libs,
can also be used to sustain a Travis (or possibly Jenkins) continuous
integration server [2].

The Homebrew setup offers an additional testing facet to nightlies: testers
can readily build and use the latest versions of supporting libs, like
GDAL, to test against the latest QGIS. This will help the QGIS project stay
ahead of possible incompatibility issues.

2) Since William's installers are so mature, widely-used and known, it
makes sense to continue to offer nightlies for testers that don't want to
(or can't) compile anything. This helps debug releases and subsequent
fixes, and makes it as simple as possible for users to work with a nightly.
However, this setup requires the most bandwidth, which is another reason
why I'll be dropping it for 10.6.

3) CMake's BundleUtilites [3, 4] are considerably more mature now than when
William tackled the large effort of creating QGIS's current bundling setup.
Leveraging CMake's toolset will allow for quicker adoption of bundling ever
more Processing supporting libs/executables and allow to future-proof
complete bundling of QGIS off of the OSGeo4Mac installation (as well as
others).

4) and 5) An embedded auto-updater will allow for testers to just launch
QGIS and choose to download and auto-install the latest nightly, regardless
of its build backend or supporting lib setup. This will also test the
auto-updater itself, which, when found to be stable, can be incorporated
into release versions.

I do all of this nightly build stuff on borrowed CPU time and disk space
from my gracious employer. It would be really nice to do this on hardware
provided by the QGIS project or OSGeo, but this means purchasing at least
one highend Mac, since legally virtualizing or installing any Mac OS X
requires Mac hardware. A minimum of 4 (ideally 8) CPU cores would be
necessary.

Anyone have $1000-1200 USD they can donate to the QGIS project, for their
very own decent Mac Mini? (That would include AppleCare.) I'd donate my
time and know-how.

Giuseppe,

Starting from QGIS 2.2. there is an alternative DXF export. Look a the
"Project" --> "DXF Export" - which is not the same as the "Save layer
as". The first is a native exporter from QGIS, the second is through
OGR. The first does not support polyon fills, but better supports
dashing, labels, svg symbol to dxf converters, etc.

Neither of the two is perfect, but the "DXF Export" native exporter is
more powerful (export multiple layers at once, export the current map
extent, etc.)

If you still have troubles with the DXF export please consider to
sponsor its development. Marco Hugentobler from Sourcepole is the one to
contact if you want further improvements.

As to dxf version to choose from: the documentation of the DXF format is
not very complete. This unfortunately means that the newer DXF versions
are a lot of trial and error due to the lack of documentation. Blame
Autodesk for this ...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Common QGIS Plugin configuration accross multiple
	Linux users
Message-ID: <531CA793.90109@geograph.co.za>

Hi,
I have posted this a couple of hours ago on QGIS-user, but this might be 
more of a dev question:


I've got a number of users created on an Ubuntu 13.10 PC.

Is there a way that I can add the same plugins and proliferate the same 
QGIS configuration to all users?
Perhaps by updating a master-User (icon arrangement, plugins etc) and 
then copying that config file to the other users?

If yes, what files need to be copied accross?

Regards & thanks,
Zoltan

	hasCrsTransformEnabledChanged signals
Message-ID: <CAALdH9W09VucOTstQyzYNfFd-7XsR9ZNvHN_uxKez42b2TsqoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
i'm not able to connect to *destinationCrsChanged *and
*hasCrsTransformEnabledChanged
*signals from  a map canvas, in a Python plugin.

My code sample is:
*self.canvas.destinationCrsChanged.connect( self.get_current_canvas_crs )*
*self.canvas.hasCrsTransformEnabledChanged[bool].connect(
self.get_on_the_fly_projection )*
and an instance of error message, when loading the plugin, is:
*AttributeError: 'QgsMapCanvas' object has no attribute
'destinationCrsChanged'*

I've tried successfully, just to test, with two other signals for a
QgsMapCanvas instance:

*self.canvas.zoomLastStatusChanged[bool].connect(
self.get_current_canvas_crs )*
*self.canvas.layersChanged.connect( self.get_current_canvas_crs )*

Perhaps the two signals with errors are not implemented in PyQGis? And in
that case, are there any workaround?

thanks,
mauro

The two directories you care about in this case are

~/.qgis2
and
~/.config/QGIS

You could e.g. rsync the user plugin dirs from a central one, or put them
in an nfs mount (read only might have issues as plugins try to write .pyc
files or even write data to the plugin dir).

The ~/.config/QGIS/QGIS2.conf is a standard ini style config file so you
should be able to pick through it and awk/sed/bash your way to nirvana :-)

Tim

Sorry actually more specifically you probably only want to sync the plugins

I'm actually thinking about to make this OS independent, by creating a
'save QSettings' as file option. Then with a command line option you
would be able to (just before reading the QSettings) actually read/write
this settings file back into user settings. Thereby making it possible
to for example transfer a certain setup across a class room (as long as
the plugins are available in .qgis2 off cours).

Would this work? Or do I miss something?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

A platform independent solution would be an elegant solution.

What we do (on Windows) is having a folder on a server containing QGIS default settings (e.g. reg-files for DB-connections, Connections for web services, but also, most popular plugins, map and print composer templates). These default settings can be imported by the users by executing a simple batch-script we produced for that purpose. If that is of interest for somebody I could post the content of the .bat file...

>From that starting point, colleagues can adjust the default settings to their personal needs and preferences...

Cheers
Stefan

Hi Richard/Tim/All,
One of the biggest problems I have with my data capture projects is 
uniformity of capture environment for my project staff.
You have just quoted a school scenario, but map production has that too.

I would really like to see a system wide (maybe network wide for both 
Windows & Linux users) config file that looks after all the icon 
placements and plugins installed and activated.

It could perhaps work like /etc/profile in linux - where that is loaded 
first, then ~/.profile if it exists, modifies the systemwide settings 
for that specific user.

To be honest, if that was extended to a "master" qgisprofile file on a 
specific server that would be even more useful - I often use multi-seat 
linux PCs networked together, for larger data capture projects.

So, possible implementation could be:

  * At install time, the user is asked if this is a
    "qgis-profile-server" PC, or to supply the qgis-profile-server PC
    name if there already is such a server on the network.
  * If such qgis-profile-server exists then the install procedure could
    get profile and plugin details from that PC, and copy over the
    config files and plugin binaries.
  * If the person installing qgis ignores the "profile-server"
    questions, then an autonomous installtion of qgis could take place,
    even if there was a qgis-profile-server on the network.
    (This would allow test installations and non-production
    installations to co-exist with a production environment)
  * It would be great if in the setup of the qgis-profile-server PC, a
    flag could be set that disallowed a (specific list or all) PC to
    change the icon placements or fiddle with any config or plugin. ie:
    Such PCs would always be dependent on the setup dictated by the
    profile-server.

This could also be made dynamic in that if the qgis-profile-server was 
updated or changed, it could set a flag. Whenever QGIS is started on a 
PC belonging to a profile-server group, it could first check with the 
server to see if changes need to be made, and if so, update the local 
copy of the profile. This way one could make changes to the master copy 
of QGIS and by restarting all the QGIS users on the network, propagate 
the changes to them immediately. (This is preferable to always obtaining 
your profiles across the network from a server.)

I haven't thought this through in "algorythm fashion", but that's the 
gist of what facilities and mechanisms would be really nice in a 
production environment.

HTH,
Zoltan

This is great - the extra step that I would like to see is that it is 
not only built in and automated, but has controls whereby an 
administrator could "force" certain PCs on the network to only be able 
to use the configs stipulated by the master installation of QGIS.
When one is managing 15+ PCs it is not trivial to make sure that you 
have copied identical configs to all of them, and to know when someone 
has kindly messed up one of your production PCs.

Actually there is a way to handle this.
Puppet http://puppetlabs.com/

The computers running a puppet client will check the master at a given
time interval any files not matching the master conf will be reverted.
You can also use this to install plugins or QGIS itself and repair the
installation of them easily.

Enjoy,
Alex

PS: Yes windows machines can be puppet clients (server might need to be
a nix machine)

My Plugins Toolbar desappeared in the hiperspace  :(

But,  with the help of Antonio ( that I thank publicly )  it returned on
the screen :


> PLUGINS => CONSOLE PYTHON

Thanks,  Antonio !  :)

BTW,  I think   QGis permits  toooo  looong  toooolbar, as you can see
here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwg_m86uaXY1T1hyTm1TdHRYV1U/edit?usp=sharing


What about a group for QGis interface restiling ?   I am sure it just
exists.

If not,  I would like to create the restiling group  :)

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GpdaMDkD3U7RXxU6y5m2qHVX_hgrU1Sjkc+hftrQSJgg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

In Valmiera, I started to have problems with QGIS using postgis spatial
views.

Adding a spatial view using the browser throws the following error:

"The layer dbname='postgis' host=192.168.100.7 port=5432 user='postgres'
> password='postgres' sslmode=disable key='cadeado' srid=3763 type=POINT
> table="PGHP"."infra_portoes" (geom) sql= is not a valid layer and can not
> be added to the map"


Adding the spatial view using the "add postgis layer", the layer can be
added (sometimes) but with odd behaviors.

I then noticed that using the last method, QGIS fails to identify a good
candidate for a primary key. Selecting it in the primary key, solves the
problem.

Using DB Manager (add layer to canvas), QGIS sucessfully identify the
possible primary key and everything goes well.

I think this was not happening in 2.0.1. Can anyone confirm this?

Best Regards,

Alexandre Neto

QGIS just offers all integer fields as candidate.  It doesn't select any.

I think that changed before 2.0.1. QGIS used to identify which view field are
primary keys in the underlying tables, but that makes sense if the view is a
selection of that table, which is just a very small subset of possible views.
E.g. for joins between two tables being a primary key in one of the table,
doesn't mean that the attribute is also unique in the view.

If you use add Postgis layer dialog, it uses one of integer fields by
default in the primary key column (not always the same).

I have a Portuguese user that says that this 2.0.1 is working as before
(and that he won't change to 2.2 until it gets "fixed"), but personally I
can't confirm this.

What was the downside of the later behavior? I.e. qgis identifying several
primary keys and try to guess what to use? Even if it is a small subset of
possible views, I think it would make user's life easier in some cases.

Also, as it is now, unless the view only have one integer field, the
browser became useless for adding views. We should, at least, change the
error message, informing the user that he must select a primary key
manually (only possible in the add postgis layer dialog).

Thanks for your answer.

Alexandre

Hi,

opening in 2.2  a project that was created with 2.0 one of my customers
noticed that all Postgis  layers disappeared.

It seems like MultiPolygonZM layers are not visible anymore in QGIS, is
this a known issue?

This is really good topic and there is no schematization tools in any FOSS GIS as of now. There is one generalization plugin but no tools for schematization in QGIS. 

There is an active academic community interested in this. For example, see one of the workshops on schematization http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=10461 

This will a really useful tool for lot of students and faculty (and there are many students and interested faculty wishing to work on this SoC topic), so it will be great if any QGIS developers can be a mentor for this project as it will then help build schematization platform for QGIS. Thanks.

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR9S4fB4SgJTuwY0JiMAJHbKaZBZYRxLXLz+8RuL7u0UXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

After recent discussions, it was my understanding that...

* we could backport necessary fixes to the release-2_2 branch
* there would be no point release, or even additional tagging, only an
available source branch

Am I correct?

If not, are we really expected to maintain a set of external patch files
for packagers willing to roll out these fixes?

What about automatic installers that can pull directly off of that branch,
e.g. Homebrew on Mac? Surely those maintainers aren't expected to track and
maintain a set of externally hosted patch files for those as well.

Regards,

Larry

And you could also write a fabric script to do this very easily (and if you

Thanks J?rgen,

The bug description is not exactly the same as in
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9748
are you sure that 9748 is also fixed?

BTW I'll test master ASAP...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Field width when converting MID-MIF to SHP
Message-ID: <531E09A4.1020707@geograph.co.za>

Hi Dev,
I know this is more an OGR question, but rather than signing up to 
another list, I'm hoping someone here knows the answer.

I want to create _a lot_ of blank SHP files with schemas I currently 
have in CSV files.

(For me) the easiest way is to create a script that reads the CSV files 
and generates  empty (geometry wise) Mapinfo MID-MIF filesets.
I then use ogr2ogr to batch convert these into empty shapefiles that 
have the correct attribute schema.

But!

In the MIF file I can say "character 36", or Decimal 6,0 or Real.
Can I get any reassurance that the resulting DBF file will contain the 
36 char length character field - If I look at the table in QGIS, I do 
not know how wide the attribute field is.
Likewise for integer and real data types I too need to nail down the 
field widths.

TIA,
Zoltan

We discussed it on IRC [1] at this month's PSC meeting and basically it is
still unconcluded - but we are working on figuring out a good strategy for
bug fixes - Juergen's domain obviously so he can comment more once there is
a concrete plan of action.

Nope we want to avoid that. AFAIK there is nothing stopping your pushing
fixes to the release branch already, the issues are more about quality and
cadence of bugfix releases.

I would really like to ask if it possible consider a point release in
the next weeks, we have a nasty regression that was not spotted before
the release (kml and gpx attributes tables are empty), one that was
already fixed in master (the identify and feature form that show at
the same time)  and unresolved issues when computing areas and
perimeters when otrf in on.

cheers!

Message-ID: <CANkSeKOuQoD5dJWz9E+w_t1y9hakiBfV0LtDyYwyjnokk0=ELw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I'm wondering if there is there a simple way to run stable and master
versions of QGIS on Ubuntu? By simple, I mean - if possible - without
compile QGIS from source.

For now, as described in doc [1], I edit /etc/apt/sources.list to define
which repository to use : http://qgis.org/debian or
http://qgis.org/debian-nightly. But doing like this, I cannot run the two
versions at the same time.

Thank you in advance for your answers.

R?mi

AFAIK, you have to build your own version (preferrably master) with a
different install prefix (e.g. /home/softdev/), and when you want to use
that version you need to add relevant paths to PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

I have a shell function that sets this up on demand:

setup_softdev()
{
export SOFT_PREFIX=/home/softdev
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/home/softdev/lib"
export LIBRARY_PATH=/home/softdev/lib
export LD_RUN_PATH=/home/softdev/lib
export PATH=/home/softdev/bin:$PATH
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/softdev/include
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/softdev/include
export CPPFLAGS=-I/home/softdev/include
export PYTHONPATH=/home/softdev/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
export GDAL_DATA=/home/softdev/share/gdal
}
export -f setup_softdev

Hi, if you disable on-the-fly simplification in rendering layer properties, the problem persists?

Hi Giovanni,

Thanks for that one. I did not know about the GPX-bug. Would have been expensive to discover that bug first during field work...
So, I second Giovanni`s wish. Otherwise going back to 2.0 would be the only alternative...

Cheers
Stefan

Yes: changing simplify does not affect visibility  - still not visible.

Now I'm testing latest master, the problem is still here.

In the logs:
rc/core/symbology-ng/qgsrendererv2.cpp: 362: (renderFeatureWithSymbol)
feature 359: unsupported wkb type 0x800007d6 for rendering

Hi all.
We are discussing about bugfix releases. Please bear with us.
As this involves some extra work along the release and package chain, my personal
opinion is that users, and especially institutional users, with large installation
base, have their best interest in supporting this effort, thus releasing energies for
core development.
It would also help if you could maintain a list of fixes to be backported.
All the best.

Hello all, and sorry for cross posting,


in little less than one hour (March 10th, 19:00 UTC) Google Summer of
Code students application period will open [0].
The application period closes in two weeks, on March 21st.

Here [1] is a link to all common questions on GSoC, that cover the
basics about the program and also specific questions on how to apply
and what are the requirements for students and mentors.

OSGeo homepage on Melange shows the application template [2] that
students shall use and will contain the direct link for application
submission.

Our suggestions to students are summarized as follows:

- check the eligibility requirements first (see the link to common
  questions)
- get inspiration and info from the OSGeo Ideas wiki page [3]
- if you are new, introduce yourself to the developer team you wish to
  join
- register on Melange and submit the application, even as draft, not
  later than next week. You are able to edit it or withdraw it anytime
  during the application period.

Interested students and mentors are welcome to ask for clarification on
the soc list soc at lists.osgeo.org or, if privacy is needed, to the
admins directly..

Let us remind that you don't need to already be an expert to take part
to GSoC - if you are unsure, just ask what are the required skills for
a given idea!

You can't convert a string that represents a float to an integer, you
should first convert to float then to int:

int(float('36.30'))

BTW this kind of questions should not be asked here but on one of the
several python mailing lists.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] windows package creation
Message-ID: <CAMMN2u3CYgE7PvcZ6_GWj7YxPax3nKP3XVRJnvhKCfW=QKbDQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
I'm trying to create a windows installer, but I'm facing some troubles.
Briefly what I made:

- forked and cloned the repo (obviously)
- given that I want to create a QGIS 2.2 installer I switched on the
release-2-2 branch
- then cd ~/QGIS/ms-windows/osgeo4w and launch ./creatensis.pl
- at the end of the process, I get an exe package in the ms-windows
directory.

First problem: the package is named QGIS-OSGeo4W-2.3.0-1-Setup-x86_64.exe
so it seems that, even if I'm on the release_2-2 branch, the script creates
a master version

- I go further and I launch the ./quickpackege.sh script (editing the
version name and other small stuff in the script).

Second problem: after launching the script I get:
Usage: LicenseData local_file_that_has_license_text | license_lang_string
Error in macro MUI_PAGE_LICENSE on macroline 21
Error in script "QGIS-Installer.nsi" on line 232 -- aborting creation
process

So I remove some line in the QGIS-Installer-nsi script (230-231-232),
thinking that this is just related to something I can change in a second
moment. But then I get another error:

Usage: File [/nonfatal] [/a] ([/r] [/x filespec [...]] filespec [...] |
   /oname=outfile one_file_only)
Error in script "QGIS-Installer.nsi" on line 315 -- aborting creation
process


I found only the documentation of Tim here [0] that is a kind of how-to.
Maybe in the meanwhile something is changes in the procedure and we should
update the documentation.
I think that the creation of a customized package is an awesome chance to
spread QGIS, but the procedure is a little bit complicated and there is a
lack of documentation (unless there are docs that I haven't found).

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Hi all.
I noticed a strange behaviour in data defined symbol size. With this expression:
( year(  "data_inizio"  )-1985) /10
I get the attached image1.jpg (labels are made with the same expression).
With this one:
( year(  "data_inizio"  )) /100
I get image2.jpg, also attached. Same scale. So size is calculated correctly, but
displayed wrongly.
Seems like a bug, right?
All the best.

Are you positive that your toplevel CMakeLists.txt is unmodified?  Because
that's where creatensis.pl gets the version number from, if you don't explictly
tell it to use something else.  And release-2_2 should have 2.2 and not 2.3.

I don't think it is maintained.

Looks like it isn't ;)   You need to also set the LICENSE_FILE in the makensis
call (see creatensis.pl).

Documentation tends to age and get out of sync. I'd stick with the source, that
at least the most verbose and up-to-date you can get ;)

To create a custom installer I'd take a different approach:  Produce a packages
with package.cmd and put it into the packages directory and run creatensis.pl.

Something like this (looks a little bit complicated to, because it excludes all
original package files and includes the qgis-custom package instead).

#!/bin/bash

export PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/NSIS

arch=x86
package=qgis-custom
version=2.0.1
binary=1
release=Dufour

pkg=$arch/release/qgis/$package/$package-$version-$binary.tar.bz2
if [ ! -f $pkg ]; then
        cmd /c package.cmd $version $binary $package $arch
fi

cmd="perl creatensis.pl -verbose \
        -arch=$arch \
        -binary=1 \
        -version=$version \
        -releasename=$release \
        qgis-full"

for i in "" "-common" "-server" "-devel" "-grass-plugin" "-globe-plugin" "-oracle-provider"; do
        pkg=$arch/release/qgis/$package$i/$package$i-$version-$binary.tar.bz2
        if [ -f $pkg ]; then
                cp -uv $pkg packages-$arch
        else
                echo $pkg not found.
                exit 1
        fi

        cmd="$cmd -exclude=qgis$i $package$i"
done

$cmd

The only non-compile way I can think of on an Ubuntu box would be to run
a virtual machine. Otherwise you have to compile to avoid package
manager conflicts.

So up to you which is more time/hassle to setup.

Enjoy,
Alex

Hi J?rgen,
thanks for the reply and your observations.
Well, as an almost-complete ignorant, I tried to do what you said.
Unfortunately without results.
I have created a script (copying/pasting) in the osgeo4w directory,
but when I launch it I get an error related to the cmd command, simply:


./script.sh: line 13: cmd: command not found
./script.sh: line 24: syntax error near unexpected token
`"-oracle-provider"'
./script.sh: line 24: `"-oracle-provider"; do'


I'm on a debian 7.3 machine and I looked for a **cmd** package but I
didn't found anything specific.

Sorry for bothering with this simple question, but no idea how to go on..

Thank you

Matteo

Thanx Remi for bringing this up ... I didn't dare to ...

The problem with compiling the dev version imho is, that you will have 
to recompile it permanently if you are trying to be of any help with bug 
tracking, am I right? (Haven't compiled anything yet, cause I don't get 
rid of the knots in my brain)

On the other hand, to use QGIS "professionaly", I need GDAL with FGDB 
and MrSID support, so I will have to compile GDAL myself beforehand.
But wanting to use it for work, I better not use the master version but 
the stable.

So, as I see it, it would be much better to compile the stable version 
and then get the master version for the candies and the testing from 
debian-nightly.
But all guidelines propose it the other way round, which I do not really 
understand ...

Said this, when I want to compile the stable version instead of the 
master, but with a "handmade" GDAL, is there any way to take benefit 
from the ubuntugis-unstable repository (things I can install beforehand 
and then disabling the repository again)?

As I said, I have knots in my brain on this and never managed to have a 
nice and easy environment on Ubuntu as I have with Windows (which is 
saaaad....)
Can someone help me with the surgery?

Cheers
Bernd

I run QGIS from ubuntugis repos and build master when the whim strikes
me, like I want to check a new feature.

With handmade GDAL, the answer is a maybe, since you will still get
pre-built geos, proj and QGIS, all of which will work with your custom
rolled GDAL. So that's compiling 1 things instead of 4+
I haven't kept up with how to keep Mrsid and FGDB working but does that
require a whole GDAL recompile? Mrsid used to just require a compile add-on.

The other neat thing is the apt-get build-dep qgis which pulls in all
the -dev libs you need for you.

I think a virtual machine is a good way to keep up on master (and you
can just use the qgis.org built ones) and still have a working stable
build. You can easily share data mounts between.

Thanks,
Alex

if I define an expression like

("column_int" -1985)/4+5

the preview is ok, but...

after re-opening the expression for the data defined size it shows as

"column_int" - 1985/4+5

the parentheses are gone and of course the result is much different
from the expected one...


cheers!

You could try downloading the source package for gdal and modifying
the debian/rules file to add the necessary --with-FileGDB and
--with-MRSID=... lines. Installing the modified gdal with the package
manager should allow it to be used with the stable QGIS from the
ubuntuGIS repo and the development version from debian-nightly. I've
never actually done this with ubuntu/debian but I do the equivalent on
Arch Linux. For ubuntu you would do something like:

mkdir ~/build
cd ~/build
sudo apt-get build-dep gdal
apt-get source gdal
cd gdal-1.10.0 # or whatever directory it unpacks...
nano debian/rules
##edit file to include the necessary --with-FileGDB and --with-MrSID
lines and cd back to the main package directory and build the package:
cd ..
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -nc

install the packages with something along the lines of
sudo dpkg -i gdal*

Assuming that worked, you would then probably want to put a hold on
gdal so it doesn't get updated and lose your customizations.

disclaimer: I have never tried this with ubuntu, but that appears to
be the general flow from a little bit of googling.

I also noticed that "some_column" / 5.0
is changed to "some_column" / 5
and thus the result may no longer be a float value.

Hi Eric,
thanx a ton for your input.
I'm still quite unfamiliar with building from source and how all these  
things play together.

What I still do not get is, why my requirements seem to be so "exotic",  
that there is no easier way for all this. But maybe I manage to solve all  
this and maybe post it somewhere.
Lots of googling ahead ... after already googling a lot.

I assume that too, but how would I do "put a hold on gdal"?

It's called Pinning in the debian world. In synaptic you highlight the
package in the list, then to Package -> Lock Version

The command line fu way is to edit an apt file like this example (just
change the package names)

Hi all.
Apparently, the descriptions of the colour ramps are missing from Win installations.
They are present in Debian and Ubuntu. I kind of remember a similar problem in 2.0,
but I'm unsure whether it was fixed.
Could anyone confirm? Is the bug still open?
Thanks.

Bernd,

I recently installed gdal with filegdb on ubuntu 13.10. My notes-to-self
about the installation procedure are found here:
http://hydrogeotools.blogspot.se/2013/07/install-gdal-with-file-gdb-and.html
Then I installed qgis 2.2 from ubuntugis-unstable. And now I do have qgis
with filegdb-support.
Is this what you were trying to achieve? ( I have to admit I did not read
the full thread.)
/Josef

Subject: [Qgis-developer] copy/paste: Z dimension in geometry
Message-ID: <53215B6B.50205@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I recently modified the copy/paste mechanism in QGIS so geometries are 
automatically transformed to the destination layer geometry type.

Now, I have a problem when I copy features from a dxf to a postgis layer.

I get a PostGIS error saying the geometry has Z dimension while the 
layer has not.

This happens if no transformation occurs (e.g. both source and 
destination layers are single line) since the QgsGeometry::convertToType 
returns a copy of the given geometry.

Now, is there a better solution than returning 
QgsGeometry::fromPolyline(geom.asPolyline()) ?

Do you have any idea on how to solve this properly in the copy/paste 
mechanism in QGIS?

Or would it be an option: remove Z values from geometries in selected 
features?

Best regards,

Denis

Hi all.
Probably I was nclear: I refer to the description in the Add a new color ramp dialog,
where clicking on a ramp I can get the path, licence, and info about it.
Thanks.

Hi

I'm adding the entries for OSGB36 NTv2 to srs.db.
For the .gsb file, you could probably contact the proj4 project if they 
want it to distribute it togethere with the library (if the license 
allows that).

Marco

Hi all.
I noticed that, when selecting the "Show all items" option, diagrams are disappearing
for some polygons (apparently, those with islands, but I have to check further).
Zooming in will show the diagram, but smaller than others. Same for labels.
Apparently a bug, probably related to simplification, In fact, activating editing
will cause labels and diagrams to display correctly.
All the best.

Hi all.
Working on a small screen (1024*768) I noticed that the tab Fileds has several issues:
* the horizontal scroll bar for field properties gets hidden
* when selecting the D&D designer, closing and reopening the Options, the designer
occupies the whole window, and fields definitions cannot be seen; to have them back,
one has to switch to Auto form and back to D&D.
Seem trivial to fix.
Tickets?
All the best.

So I figured I would start here and work my way out...or up. Sorry for 
the cross posting. I'm hitting a little bit of everything on this one. 
Same action - different results (sorta). This is all of my attempts at 
adding a REST Service from ArcGISOnline to QGIS (using GDAL in some cases).

On Ubuntu 12.04 LTS gdal 1.10
This command: gdal_translate 
"http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/USA_Topo_Maps/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true" 
ESRITopographicLayer.xml -of WMS
Gives me a segmentation fault

On windows 7 OSGEO4w 32 bit installer gdal 1.10.1
This command: gdal_translate 
"http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/USA_Topo_Maps/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true" 
ESRITopographicLayer.xml -of WMS
Gives me:
ERROR 4: `/vsimem/http_1/file.dat' not recognised as a supported file 
format.
ERROR 4: `/tmp/file.dat' not recognised as a supported file format.
GDALOpen failed - 4

In QGIS 2.2  On windows (OSGEo4W installer) python console:
qgis.utils.iface.addRasterLayer("http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/USA_Topo_Maps/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true","raster")
Gives me an error saying /tmp/file.dat is not a recognized format.

On Ubuntu 12.04 QGIS 2.2 Python Console
qgis.utils.iface.addRasterLayer("http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/USA_Topo_Maps/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true","raster")
Crashes QGIS.

Once again my apologies for cross posting. I *think* it's all related. I 
think.

Hi all.
On Gnome 3, I cannot find the close button for Processing>Model builder.
Anyone confirms? A pretty annoying bug, it seems.
All the best.

Hi Randy,

You are requesting json format from arcgisonline. That is a vector format
and you are trying to use it as a raster image.
Secondly you are trying to translate that into WMS with gdal_translate.
Gdal supports WMS-reading only, not creation (
http://gdal.org/formats_list.html).

I recommend for you some introduction to GIS and raster and vector formats.
http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/index.html


Regards,

Lauri

Do gdal service description files no longer work? I was hoping for an 
XML output.

From:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Arcgis_rest:
1. In the QGIS Python console, run this:
|qgis.utils.iface.addRasterLayer("http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true","raster")|
2. Create a gdal service description file, e.g. by running this in a 
terminal:
|gdal_translate 
"http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true" 
s.xml -of WMS|
You can now load this file into QGIS, e.g. by drag-and-drop.

I've used it several times - this morning it wouldn't work - Unless it's 
something I'm doing wrong and I really hope it is. I thought it was odd 
using json but I was just following directions as posted.

I guess that's unlikely they would add it to the binary packages, as it
would add a few MB to the base install.  But they might add it to
proj-datumgrid-1.5.zip (which contains many free datum files), as the
licence for the grid is BSD.

Makes me think - could QGIS ship with the freely available gsb grids, in an
optional package (say qgis-datum-grids)?  It would be rather convenient,
especially as QGIS now supports them (but does not ship with any grids yet,
unless mistaken).

cheers,
Etienne

I wouldn't get on his case too hard he's following:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Arcgis_rest

There's probably some clues in:
http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#/The_ArcGIS_REST_API/02r300000054000000/

I think other workarounds could be to pull the layers in the OpenLayers
plugin.

confirmed.

And on my machine (debian 7.3 with gnome 3, 13" screen) in the print
composer there is not the maximize button. Can it be a a screen
resolution problem?

Moreover, if I open the layer properties window, I cannot
move/minimize/maximize the window without moving the entire qgis
window on the back. A gnome problem or just a problem with my computer?

Hi Randy,

I'm really sorry and little embarrassed for my previous post.
You sure noticed that I don't have much knowledge in arcgis rest services
and especially in using those with gdal.

In this case that json isn't a vector data. It is actually a description of
a raster service and therefore should be accetable for gdal. This was
totally my mistake.

Randy,

So it was working at some point? Is it possible the service has changed?

Seems to work fine here with a PostGIS layer (Win7 nightly).

Might be OS specific. I'm on a quite small screen, Win7, but cannot  
reproduce this behavior.

Oh yeah - it was completely working. I haven't tried it since the 
upgrade to 2.2 on Ubuntu. That's why I ran through all the variations: 
windows/linux/etc to make sure it wasn't one thing vs something else. It 
seems ultimately to be a gdal thing since it failed on linux and 
windows. Linux was a bit more extreme with the segmentation fault.

Anyway - I'm hoping it's me - but I don't think so.....

Hi Josef,

yes, I do want to have "stable" qgis with fdgb (+mrsid) support AND master  
for testing/new features, and yes, I already found your blog and also  
managed to build gdal on a virtual machine. But as with all those blogs,  
there is the "glue" missing.
For example I never found a text describing building gdal AND using the  
rest from the repositories. Normally, they only cover building everything  
and only latest versions and master and other cutting edge stuff, but  
simple how-tos how to set-up an easy to maintain system comparable what  
you get on windows out of the box with osgeo4w seem not to exist.
Fortunately, Alex and Eric already gave some very important hints.

This was completely new for me and I would never ever have managed to find  
out on myself just through googling cause for that you need to know the  
terms to search for.

Ok, at the moment I have no time for the experimenting, but at least I  
know how to "pin" this thread in my mail-client for later use ;)

Cheers
Bernd

Message-ID: <374F2A33A0F46242B3A1F52EB8A1E8B4FB98C4270E@EXCHMBX-V.cg67.fr>

Hello,

I'm using Pyscripter to develop standalone application with QGIS API.
When using 2.0.1 API (and former 1.8) there's a realy "confortable" pyscripter behavior for debugging code, console print all messages from QGIS API, like that:
d:\src\qgis-2.0.1\src\core\qgsvectorlayer.cpp(477) : (QgsVectorLayer::drawRendererV2) Total features processed 46

SINGLE: MARKER SYMBOL (1 layers) color 0,255,0,255

With 2.2 API no more messages from API :(
Switching  QGIS_DEBUG var does nothing...
How can I retrieve former behavior from QGIS API?

Thanks

Thanks for testing. Tried again here on shp and pg, it does not work at first, simply
enabling and disabling OTF reprojection shows everything fine.
Tested on Debian and Win7, on EPSG:3003 layers.
All the best.

The first one (D&D dialog too wide) is an issue I experienced as well 
(maybe gnome specific?) and should not be too hard to fix.

I think the second one should be considered a design issue caused by 
too many stuff put into the fields tab

 * Info about attributes
 * Form layout style
 * D&D designer
 * Python init script path
 * Relations

I could imagine splitting this into two (or even three) different tabs 
would be nice:

 * Fields (in the future will contain controls for default values, NULL 
constraints, domains etc.)
 * Forms (D&D designer, .ui definition, form layout style, python init 
script path)
 * Maybe a relations tab where relations can be managed (This could 
eventually replace the join tab as soon as all functionality is covered)

If somebody wants to do some mockups for how this could be visually 
improved I would highly appreciate that.

Best
Matthias

Hi all.
AT plugin seems seriously broken: once activated, I cannot stop editing with right
click, and I'm essentially stuck.
Verified on Debian and Win 7 & 8.
All the best.

Hi all.
The tool to capture orthogonal lines by pressing Ctrl seems not to be always working:
on some machines yes, on some not: anyone confirms?
Sorry for flloding the list, we are in a course now, so we're finding several issues.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I can't reproduce your problem in win7 and Ubuntu. Could you let me know
step-by-step procedure so that I can reproduce the issue?

Cheers,
Saber

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Pb transforming points in mulitpolyline
Message-ID: <5322D208.9030800@espaces-naturels.fr>

Hello all,
I've got a strange problem with a python function in my QGIS 2.2.0 plugin:

This first function works perfectly:

/def points_linestring (pointgeoms)://
//    return QgsGeometry.fromPolyline([point.asPoint() for point in 
pointgeoms])/

pointgeoms contains points.
The function transforms these in a linestring.

BUT, if I want a multipolyline, and if I try :

/def points_linestring (pointgeoms)://
//    return QgsGeometry.fromMultiPolyline([point.asPoint() for point in 
pointgeoms])/

(I've juste added "Multi"),
Qgis returns :

"/home/vincent/.qgis2/python/plugins/bdtravaux/convert_geoms.py", line 
70, in points_linestring
     return QgsGeometry.fromMultiPolyline(polyligne.asPolyline())
TypeError: QgsGeometry.fromMultiPolyline(unknown-type): argument 1 has 
unexpected type 'list'

Does somebody know why this function works with fromPolyline() and not 
fromMultiPolyline()?
I found nothing about this in the doc and in google searchs.

Thanks for advance.
Vincent

I am using a custom UI created with qt4 designer in QGIS 2.2 on Ubuntu 13.10.
When I try to load the form using the identify tool QGIS crashes. 
I know that this was an issue on Ubuntu 12.04 with QGIS 2.0

crashing persists.

Hi all.
Having the list of recent expressions is very handy. Apparently they are missing from
the field calculator, however. Seems an easy fix: should I open a ticket?
Thanks.

On master seems to work ok on Windows and Linux.

On 2.2:

On Linux I cannot make the mirror work at all.

On Windows seems to work in general. At some point it wasn't working
and the "trigger" to make it work wasn't enabling otfr but just
opening any dialog.

Hi

The info for OSGB36 NTv2 is in srs.db now.

 >Makes me think - could QGIS ship with the freely available gsb grids,

I'm receiving frequent suggestions of bundling .gsb files with QGIS. The 
problems I see with this are:
- It adds the extra MB for QGIS too.
- They come with various licences.
- .gsb files are usefull for all tools working with proj. So a logical 
choice would be to have an optional package for proj4.

Marco

Marco,
            I think that is a great idea to ship GSB files with QGIS. If the developers of GDAL were to make a decision to bundle them then QGIS should just make use of them. We often encounter datasets in older datums/adjustments and need to use these files.

Thanks,
            Bob Bruce

For the .gsb file, you could probably contact the proj4 project if they want it to distribute it togethere with the library (if the license allows that).


I guess that's unlikely they would add it to the binary packages, as it would add a few MB to the base install.  But they might add it to proj-datumgrid-1.5.zip (which contains many free datum files), as the licence for the grid is BSD.

Makes me think - could QGIS ship with the freely available gsb grids, in an optional package (say qgis-datum-grids)?  It would be rather convenient, especially as QGIS now supports them (but does not ship with any grids yet, unless mistaken).

it should be an extra package, not part of main QGIS packages (for osgeo4w
and linux)

that would require a bit of time to make sure all added packages are ok to
distribute, but it's a one-time process.

Yes, but that would be up to others not QGIS, so adding them to the QGIS
packages would have more chances of actually happening.

It would be nice to have a point of view from those responsible for
packaging QGIS.

they are also missing from the "select by expression" tool, but
avialable in the expressions for labels or data defined properties.

Hi all.
I noticed that the map cen be rotated both inside a frame, or with the frame as a
whole. In the first case an image (e.g. north arrow) can be rotated in sync, in the
second not; IMHO this is a bug.
Opinions?
All the best.

feature. The right click does not finish edition in any case. It was 
reported with QGIS 2.2 but I got the same issue in QGIS Master as well.

Hi Minoru and all,
I like the qgis2threejs plugin. I think that an option to limit movements would be
usaful: tiliting laterally does not seem useful, and reversing the dem upside down
makes navigation only more unpleasant: opinions?
Thanks.

When you have a project with two layers in different datum and OTF 
transformation enabled, a dialog appears to ask how to transform between 
the two datums. Try it with a layer in WGS84 and a layer in Beijing 1954 
for example.

Once this datum transformation is chosen, it will be saved in this 
"Default datum transformations" list visible in the options. The - icon 
allows to remove a default datum transformation. The + icon seems to not 
have any effect for the moment. I expect someday it will allow to define 
directly a default datum transformation from the options?

I think this feature is very important but still needs a lot of polish 
to be actually usable, and should be hidden from the next release if the 
interface is not improved.

Regards,

Leyan

Hi All

I was just wondering if anyone has made submissions to run QGIS workshops
at the upcoming FOSS4G 2014 event. As I write this it is about 13 hours to
the closing event. It would be great if those planning to submit workshop
proposals coordinate a little to avoid duplication. I know Jeffrey Johnson
is putting in to do a QGIS Analysis workshop. Is anyone planning to offer
an introductory workshop (or anything else)?

It would be great if the US folks could pool effort - perhaps also giving a
quick start guide to writing QGIS plugins would be nice!

Regards

Tim

I have just submitted a Processing workshop, which will also include
some exercises with the OpenGeo Suite plugin, to show how Processing
integrates with it and allows to run a processing workflow before
publishing to a Geoserver instance

Jeff will propose a workshop about data management with QGIS,
including analysis (but not using Processing) and describing the Suite
plugin in detail, including publishing to GeoServer and GWC, working
with PostGIS, etc.

We were thinking about a PyQGIS one, but only in case no one else
proposes it. Is anyone interested on that?

+1 for those suggestions.

I also wonder if it would be easy to add panning using cursor keys?

Hi Tim, et al.,

I am currently working on a presentation and workshop for the upcoming
inaugural QGIS user group meeting in DC [0]. The concept is on how to
become a QGIS developer. There is an obvious dearth of developers in the US
compared to around the globe, though most certainly not because there is a
lack of potential developers.

The focus will be on the many avenues one can gain working knowledge and
apply their ideas to help the project and themselves or their business,
whether it be with writing plugins, standalone apps, documentation or
tutorials, or submitting code pull requests. The goal is to get potential
US developers excited about and involved in the project.

The presentation/workshop covers taking the first steps from user to
developer and an overview of the project's structure and organization. It
includes an overview of the technologies used and recommends tools and
workflows for working with and managing both QGIS and Python/plugin source
code. It is not about how to specifically write code, but how to gain the
knowledge and set up the development environment to do so, regardless of
platform, and what to do with the working and finished code/plugin/app.

Additionally, it covers the benefits of becoming a developer, or sponsoring
one as a business.

I think this would make a good FOSS4G workshop, especially once the
presentation/workshop has been trial-run at the US user meeting. I've done
smaller, similar presentations for the local GIS community here in the past.

If others agree this would be a good workshop, I'll submit something today.

Hi all

Thanks everybody for responding - it is nice to see that there will be good
representation of QGIS there, and from what I can see nobody is duplicating
each other's work!

Tim

Hi Randal,

I'm not really sure why gdal isn't creating the xml file. It looks
like it is gdal, since using the iface.AddRasterLayer() method
produces the same error message as using gdal_translate from the
command line.

As a work around while that issue is being sorted out, if you download
the gdal ArcGIS server TMS xml definition from
http://www.gdal.org/frmt_wms_arcgis_mapserver_tms.xml and change the
url before the /tile/${z}/${y}/${x} portion, it will load the tiles
when dragged into QGIS. I tested it with several of the raster layers
from http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/ and they all
worked.

Yes it is a great plugin. I use it to visualize boreholes in 3D (
http://goo.gl/8pDR4o). For this usage I need to reverse the dem upside
down. (I also would like to add several DEMs to visualize boundaries
between different geological stratas.)

Therefore, if the reverse is implemented, please make it optional and not
mandatory.

Hello all,

If I may share my suggestions...

+1 for some control

And I , I think that having a cursor representing the center of rotation
and zoom might help with navigation.

Once again, great job Minoru.

Unless you are interested in sub-terrain feature, like caves,
waste-water systems, tunnels, boreholes, geologic features, garages,
basements, etc.

Personally, I am very interested in being able to look below the
terrain and regret that many tools prevent that (like Google Earth).

Hi Paolo,

This is not a bug. Every object in the composer can be rotated now. It
is a general feature of all objects in the print composer.

The other rotation is just the map content, which is different from
rotating the map frame.

Of course you could do stupid things with it - but then you can do
that with a lot of other features within QGIS.

I appreciate it - yeah I have several xmls I have created here for 
pulling in REST services from ArcGISOnline and other spots. I modified 
one and was able to grab what I needed - I just can't figure out why 
it's bombing. That's why I tried it two different platforms and got the 
same result. It appears a tmp file isn't getting made with proper 
permissions - but I have no clue.

Anyway - Thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] processing.runalg() issue with grass algorithms
Message-ID: <CAMM2+Yo1otK+wEpF4qpz0EJerSG97m2+xPzr_fT82D737mB9aw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm using QGIS 2.3-Master 64-bit, fa157b0 with GRASS 6.4.4svn on linux.

When I pass a grass command to processing.runalg() without specifying
the GRASS_REGION_PARAMETER or GRASS_REGION_CELLSIZE_PARAMETER, I get
an empty output because the region/cell size are invalid. For example,
using the qgis sample data, if I run:

lpf = processing.runalg("grass:r.neighbors", "SR_50M_alaska_nad", 0,
9, False, False, None, None, None, None)

there is an output key in lpf that points to a tif, but that tif
doesnt exist. Looking at the log, the above command is translated to:

processing.runalg("grass:r.neighbors","/data/GIS/qgis_sample_data/raster/SR_50M_alaska_nad.tif",0,9,False,False,"None","0,1,0,1",0.0,None)

If one runs the r.neighbors algorithm from the Processing Toolbox,
leaving the region and cell size at the defaults (blank and 0.00)
works correctly. How can a similar behavior be achieved  when running
the command through processing.runalg()?

And on a somewhat related note, when running a grass algorithm from
the toolbox there is an option to select extent on canvas--can this be
used in custom processing scripts?

Thanks!
Eric

Hi,

Does the data-defined size feature for vector features work for you?
I tried to create spheres with data-defined radius but they were always  
gigantic - no matter which factor I tried to use as a multiplier.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi all.
I'm getting a regular, nasty crash when activating one of these plugins.
qgis 2.2.0-1+unstable1 on Debian sid.
A local or systematic issue? I imagine recompiling could solve this, but I would like
to check the status of the package.
Thanks.

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/89287/how-do-i-catch-postgis-postgresql-raise-messages-in-qgis
but
it hasn't got the attention of anyone who could help.

I have a trigger set up in PostGIS/PostgreSQL which will show a RAISE
WARNING when an inserted or updated polygon is within a certain distance of
some predefined planning constraints. I want this warning to be sent to
QGIS to alert a user to the proximity warning, but with a WARNING this does
not occur. On the other hand, using RAISE EXCEPTION shows an error in the
QGIS message bar but doesn't allow the insert/update to be committed (which
I want - it should be a warning, not an error).

Hi all.
The Reshape tool is not working on the attached shp (it is working on the first of

If confirmed, I can open a ticket.

Hi all.
The idea is not new, but now may be the right time to discuss it again: I think
usability of QGIS for several specialized uses (e.g. field work, digitizing, etc.)
would be enhanced if it would be possible to load one of a series of preset profiles.
In short I suggest to:
* store not only icon Customization, as it is already possible, but also menu bars
toggling and placement
* prepare, with the help of power users, a series of profiles
* ship them along with main QGIS.
Opinions?
All the best.

I personnaly think it is a great idea. It would actually be even better if 
users could create their own toolbars and save/share them.

Integrating UI custom settings sharing into the (future) django-powered QGIS 
resource sharing site would be great too.

exactly, along with symbols (unfortunately still hanging around), Processing models, etc.

It does not seem a big task, any taker?

To me this is overkill and brings a lot more problems then it really needs.
 It feels like a solution without a problem.  We already have plugins in
which users can create their own toolbars and add logic.  If the usability
of the main toolbars are an issue (which they are at times) then we need to
fix it in core for everyone rather then band aid solutions.  If there is a
need to have custom toolbar layouts using existing actions so a user can
create there own "super toolbar" then this would be a (easy) core feature
but I don't really think it needs to be shareable - expect maybe a export
from settings for admins if needed.

My idea is the following:
* I start an editing job > I select the Editing user profile > All the useless icons
and bars disappear, the editing toolbars go on the side, where I find them more useful
* I then go out in the filed, I select the Field profile, and again I only have what
I need, etc.
All the best.

Yes I don't disagree with that at all. Just the online sharing part I think
is unneed.

I agree with Nathan here, and we discussed the 'exporting' of the
QSettings already... For my use-cases I think that is enough: the
QSettings holds connection names and params, which plugins are enabled
and which toolbars are visible and where they are placed.

After we have the "Djago based sharing sites (like for icons/styles etc
etc), we could create profiles there and make QSettings aware of that.
Same with other preferred settings: if we make QSettings the central
place for that, we should be fine with sharing QSettings files and
loading these?

Off course that means that if you move (and load TBD!) this (QSettings)
file around, you also need the plugins to be available. But that can be
fixed to?: while reading in the QSettings (file), and finding a plugin
activated which is not there, we can maybe fetch it?

@paolo: I see your mail about 'profiles'. To me it seems that you want
to duplicate something like QSettings (a file holding ALL information
for given 'profile').

This would work if you pass around different QSettings-files and start
up QGIS with one of those?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi, 
agreed with Nathan and Richard, this would be really tricky to handle, and
over complicated, especially for administrators of user's profiles. 
We already predefine profiles for users, but after that, they are free to
modify them. Toolbars and panels positions are stored, but are screen size
dependant. So we would need some kind of default profiles, that user can
modify and save on the fly .. complex.

Today, modifying the registry or ini file with administrator tools is enough
for us, and really simple enough. I have been trying to install two
differents icons on test desktops, one ultralite, one complete, and user's
didn't vote for it, preferring a web client for very simple uses. 

My two cents
Cheers

Hi Andreas,
while I completely agree with you from a developer point of view, I still think it
violated the Principle of least astonishment [0]: if an user chooses to sync a north
arrow with a map, it expects it to be in sync both when the map is rotated inside the
map and when the whole frame is rotated.
All the best.

Hi all.
Apparently in Debian they are applying backported fixes to packages.
Good news, I'd say. I believe this propagates to Ubuntu and other distros.
All the best.

I managed to replicate the problem by having the projection OTF on. It works
fine with no OTF. 

Seems the plugin does not support it yet.

Thanks

I have no plans for multithreaded rendering in QGIS server and QGIS
benchmark tool. Feel free to update them if you are interested. I
think for either the MTR should be just optional (especially if we
want to have comparable numbers for the benchmarks).

the QgsMapSettings object inside QgsMapCanvas is meant to be read-only
(it is a const reference in c++, however there is no such thing in
Python). The configuration of the map in canvas should be set by
calling the setter methods directly on QgsMapCanvas instance, which
will make sure that appropriate signals are emitted (so that other
components can react to it). Some of the QgsMapSettings properties are
meant to be automatically handled by QgsMapCanvas (e.g. output image
size or DPI), but it makes sense to have a method like
"applyMapSettings(ms)" that would apply all the allowed settings from
an external QgsMapSettings.

Martin

Message-ID: <CAMB2qw2SPVnCHLdKVkjYqOZMzZ7r-ejz7MdARj9AFa1HNkzTgA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

on 32 bit Windows XP systems, loading WMS layers in QGIS 2.2 are
considerately slower than in QGIS 2.0.

On my tests, QGIS 2.2 takes more than a minute, while QGIS 2.0 loads the
WMS in 1-2 seconds.

To test, you can use our WMS server:

http://webapps.comune.trento.it/ogc

Another test: on a Windows 7 64 bit, QGIS 2.2 64 bit loads the WMS layer in
1-2 seconds, while the 32 bit version over than a minute...

I suspect that Qgis 2.2 - 32 bit should be recompiled (or Qt libraries
should be updated? The are still at 1.7.1)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] API break
Message-ID: <5326FE01.70000@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I noticed an API break has been introduced after 2.2:

2.2: void QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2::startRender( QgsRenderContext& 
context, const QgsVectorLayer *vlayer );
2.3: void QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2::startRender( QgsRenderContext & 
context, const QgsFields &  fields );

I was using this in a plugin to determine if a feature was rendered or not.

This was introduced by Martin for multi-threading
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/2fcf556c3cb9c2618753adee390bf84a5ead4775

Although I believe that for such a change, some breaks were acceptable. 
Anyway, it would be nice to have this documented at some place. If it 
is, I did not find it.

Cheers,

Denis

The prototype with QgsVectorLayer as an argument is still available in
master and it calls the other version with QgsFields argument, so in
theory you should be still able to use the version with
QgsVectorLayer. If not, it is a bug (supposedly related to shadowing
of virtual methods with the same name).

The change should only matter to implementations of renderers, which I
believe are very rare in third-party code, and therefore somewhat a
bit more acceptable to break if there is no chance to fix it without a
break.

I have a list of such changes which I would like to document with more
in-depth docs of the MTR implementation. I hope to get it ready for/at
hackfest.

Hi Martin,

Thanks for the feedback.

I did get an error in a python plugin using startRenderer with the 
vector layer.
I fixed this using a check on QGIS version.

Cheers,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems editing WFS in QGIS
Message-ID: <53273273.8030505@gmail.com>

I've been having no success using the digitizing toolbar with WFS-T.   
I'm using QGIS 2.2.0 with a GeoServer 2.4.  The layers are displaying 
fine when added through the Add WFS dialog, and the editing UI is 
functional.  However, on save, it fails (after freezing up QGIS for a 
minute or so) with the following message:

Could not commit changes to layer geonode:incidentes_copeco

Errors: ERROR: 1 feature(s) not added.

Provider errors:

unhandled response: html



   It's not specific to these layers and it fails on all of the layers I 
pick.  I've successfully tested editing using WFS-T on this particular 
server using both our OL3 and our mobile client.

   Any ideas on workarounds or what might be going wrong?

Thanks,

  Scott

Hi,

this is only a "safety" question on weekly win64 master version.
I do weekly upgrade of weekly master version (today 2.3.0.11) to one of 
machines but I noticed the size is only 57M compared to normal ~184M?
Is't broken or just the testing maps left away ? (I like to test with 
Anita's book ;) )
I haven't updated yet as not willing to test broken installations. ;)

Cheers,
Kari

Hey Matthais,

Yes it seems to be a bug caused from another bug fix in 2.2.  There is now
a timer on canvas resize in order to stop it rendering all the time when
changing the size of widget, however the resize event is also fired when
the widget is first shown so it starts the timer and then never repaints
the widget hence why you don't see anything.

I ran into this in a recent standalone app of mine and it drove me crazy
for about a week.  There is a fix so not to worry.  Just do:

self.canvas.refresh()
self.canvas.repaint()

once somewhere after the canvas is created.  You only have to do this once.

refresh() stops the timer, repaint() tells Qt to rerender the widget, which
the canvas doesn't do if the timer is running.

P.S this is also not a issue in the latest dev version due to the
multithreading

Hi Paolo,
took me a while till I figured out what you mean. I was a bit puzzled by  
the wording of user profile.
I think this would be a great UX-enhancement, especially for novices, to  
have something, I would call it presets or contexts, to filter the tool  
bars and other stuff. Beginners (and not only) are often overwhelmed by  
the sheer amount of buttons and sidebars etc.  So choosing a preset for  
your present focus which eliminates all unnecessary stuff will definitely  
decrease power-draying searches for the right tool and lower the learning  
curve.

Actually, the MS Office Ribbons are kind of such presets for different  
work areas.
Doing this with hundreds of plugins ( and another trizillion of plugins to  
come) for a lot more work environments sounds challenging ...
So you would need to have predefine context tags for plugins and their  
tool bars, create some best-practice presets, but still offer enough  
flexibility to customize that. Maybe by proposing additional plugins for a  
preset, that have the according tag?
That would be somehow revolutionary ...

Over and out
Bernd

The only barrier is QGIS compiling on ARM had some issues the last few
years. Might be fixed soon.
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=739029

There's no other reason it won't work.

If you're running Debian then it should just be a matter of waiting for
the packages to be available to try.

Thanks,
Alex

Mmm, but that is Qt5 isn't it? QGIS is still on Qt4?

while a very nice project, I'm not sure if the user experience will be 
ok on this low end (for X) devices. For example running a 'normal' webbrowser 
(other then Midori), already makes me pull my hair out..
On the other side: it is a very nice platform to make automated field work 
devices.

But plz try and show us, and make me look a conservative fool :-)

Message-ID: <CAJJa6h_gWXYhEAtrHVVwLKRYFUdANrVPwUc-GfV8AX=E-OTk=A@mail.gmail.com>

I?m developing a plugin and I want to call an external program that
takes as input a string and outputs a string. Under Mac and Linux I
successfully used subprocess.Popen() but under Windows it doesn?t
work. For instance, from a Python console inside QGIS under Mac/Linux:

import subprocess
p = subprocess.Popen(['ls', '-al'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
print p.stdout.read()
total 17101
drwxr-xr-x   35 root  wheel     1258 Mar 13 09:11 .
drwxr-xr-x   35 root  wheel     1258 Mar 13 09:11 ..

d--x--x--x    8 root  wheel      272 Nov  5 10:02 .DocumentRevisions-V100
?

But under Windows if I try to catch the output (which is a requirement for me) :
import subprocess

What?s the best way to call a program and catching the output (a

Hi Etienne,

I have integrated your test and updated it.
I also updated SIP API and corrected my code to account for negative

Though I have not tested whether this is better on Windows, try instead:

  print p.communicate()[0]

See:
http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate

I had a similar file handle issues on Mac, and that fixed it (though it
seems like p.stdout.read() should just work).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Feature][RASTER] Generate band name with NetCDF
 EXTRA_DIM funded by Ifremer
Message-ID: <53286D2C.50605@gmail.com>

Hi dev,

I have open an issue http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9810 and a pull request 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1253

The NetCDF provided extra dimensional information. This information 
provides metadata on each band. These metadat can be used to explain the 
name of each band.

For example, the bands of a NetCDF file represents the temperature at a 
given depth. For the user, it is easier to select a band with depth 
information, rather than the number.

If the GDAL version is equal or greater than 1.10.0, the band name is 
generated with the extra_dim information.

Ren?-Luc D'Hont

Message-ID: <7447393869595D4EBC20745A4F48BA1F14A3F3AE@RTPWEXC18.RCC_NT.RTI.ORG>

I uninstalled QGIS 2.0.1 and just installed 2.2 using the Windows
standalone installer 64 bit. I now am unable to use any of the 157 GRASS
tools.

I get the following messages in a Missing dependency window that pops up
when I try to use a GRASS tool:

Missing dependency. This algorithm cannot be run :-(

This algorithm requires GRASS to be run. Unfortunately, it seems that
GRASS is not installed in your system, or it is not correctly configured
to be used from QGIS.

Click here
<http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/html/en/docs/user_manual/processing/3rdParty.h
tml>  to know more about how to install and configure GRASS to be used
with QGIS.

So I click the "Click here" link and just gives me the User Guide home
page, which does not help much.

The same goes for all the SAGA tools (243), and OTB tools (76).

This is a huge loss. Do these not get installed with the Windows
standalone installer?

Any help in a fix would be greatly appreciated.

Have you made a change to your WMS server? I can't replicate this -
for me loading the server in 2.2  32 bit only takes a few seconds.

However, I suspect that you may be encountering an issue I ran into
with connections to a WMS with many layers. This was fixed in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/99d030d67594766c5acb452adb84cc0f803f201d
. I'm planning on backporting this fix to the 2.2 branch too so it
will be included in any potential 2.2 point releases.

Are you able to test with the current master dev version and report
your findings?

Hi, thank you for your answer.

I tested QGIS 2.3 dev and I can assure you that ALL of WMS slowness
problems are gone!

The commit in your email regards the WMS layers list in the connection
window; but there is also the WMS loading slowness (when you add it from
connection window). In 2.0 and 2.3 WMS loading takes 2-3 seconds, while 2.2
takes 1 minute!

Can you backport  the entire WMS code from 2.3 ?

Hi

I haven't heard of such a plugin. I guess you mean like you get using osm's
id and josm editors? It would be a nice addition to QGIS.

Regards

Tim

Hi,

good that nobody answered. Everything seems to be OK now.
I think that for some reason the upload was still hanging when I looked 
it (though I reloaded the page).

Thanks,
Kari

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qlr files gets no extension + general utils
Message-ID: <5329B801.909@duif.net>

Hi,

I'm playing around a little with Nathans 'layer definition files', and
it appeared to me that when I do a 'Save as Layer Definition file', and
name the file 'bla' (without extension), it is exactly saved like that
(without extension .qlr).
That makes the file invisible to open via 'Layer/Add from Layer
definition file', because 'bla' is not shown to me as there is the .qrl
filter.

This is off course a pretty common problem, which can be seen in more
places and plugins. I've programmed that in my plugins several times
too: check for certain extension, if not, add it...

Question: is there (or possible to create) some 'utils' function for
doing this? Preferably usable both in cpp and QGIS?

I've also seen a python 'utils' class somewhere (nhv?). Maybe we could
'centralize' this kind of utils.

Another candidate, if I'm not mistaken there is already some 'LineEdit'
available which has this nice 'clean input'-brush in it. Is that
available for python too?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QspatiaLite plugin 4.1.1 error message
Message-ID: <7447393869595D4EBC20745A4F48BA1F14A3F3B6@RTPWEXC18.RCC_NT.RTI.ORG>

I noticed the QspatiaLite plugin was recently upgraded. I have QGIS 2.2
and when I click to use the QspatiaLite plugin, first a small error
message window pops up with just the text "4.1.1." I have to click twice
to close the error message and then the plugin opens. Is this a bug?

Hi all.
I'm finding master terribly slow in loading large rasters: anyone confirms?
Exploring the various options is painful, because every load takes minutes.
Once loaded, it is reasonably fast.
One unpleasant effect is: when zooming in, it first loads a preview, then the image
disappears, then it shows at full resolution.
Sample files available for testing.
All the best, and thanks.

another issue, probably also a side effect: WMS downloading progress is no longer
shown on the status bar; I personally miss it.
All the best.

On Win7 (OSGeo4W), Globe does not seem to work at all. When I try to  
launch it, it just shows a "bad allocation" error without any further  
information. Then I tried to change the base map in settings but on  
closing settings QGIS crashed.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi all.
Whan selecting Reset UI default, the icons of plugins are no longer visible.
Restarting QGIS make them to appear, along with all panels (e.g. LRS, shortest path,
etc.), making the GUI very cluttered.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

please see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1232

In my opinion that implementation is not working, I propose another way
there.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Missing labels in polygons
Message-ID: <7447393869595D4EBC20745A4F48BA1F14A3F3B8@RTPWEXC18.RCC_NT.RTI.ORG>

This is in QGIS 2.2. When I label a polygon layer, in my case a very
simple shapefile of just a few sates, only 2 of the 8 labels appear and
the rest are missing. When I go into edit layer mode, I see all labels,
then turn off edit mode, and only the same two labels appear. When I
zoom so far out that my group of U.S. states are nothing but a dot, the
rest of the labels appear. Very strange. I see that this is some kind of
logged bug with the new label engine, correct? Is there some kind of fix
planned since this pretty much causes the inability to label polygons?

Thanks for any help that can be provided.

Hi, 
I'm facing the very same bug. Does it works if you disable on-the-fly
simplification in render tab of layer properties?

Hi, it seems as 'http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9655' and 'http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9777' issues.

There are two fixes?related with them?recently merged to master and 2.2 branchs:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/5b824ac85e86ff4bccc7aeb81a5c48461fcc4def

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/1f21273accba005fa651b3bff027929e9fcacabb

Also there is other pull request, not merged yet, to fix in more general mode this issue:

Hi Tim
I haven't used the osm stuff so can't comment on it.
But it is a facility I've had in my proprietry GIS package (Genamap) and 
have often used it. One sets up global tolerances and runs it on a 
select set of polygons.

If someone does create this as a QGIS plugin, then please make it 
batch-run-able and not a "Click on feature to be squared off" facility.

Regards,
Z

Subject: [Qgis-developer] auto aligning adjoining features
Message-ID: <532AADB5.7090909@geograph.co.za>

Hi Dev list,
Is anyone aware of a plugin that can:

  * auto-snap (make concurrent) borders between adjoining polygons
    (perhaps also in different map-layers)
    (Like topologically aligning cultivated land polygons with river
    banks or other adjoining polygon features)

  * auto-snap (make concurrent) polygons borders with line features
    (perhaps also in different map-layers)
    (Like topologically aligning cultivated land polygons with road or
    other line features)

  * Drop in vertices at places where features intersect each other
    (perhaps also in different map-layers)
    Like a road crossing a field (but not dividing the field into two
    pieces), or a bridge feature running on top of a road feature
    (placing vertices on the road feature directly under the start &
    endpoints of the bridge line)

It would be cool if this could be automated, with the ability to set 
snapping tolerances, and choosing whether to have a master feature set 
to move to, or to average the gap between the features (ie: move both 
features to the averaged common boundary). The final result must have 
identical vertices in both the adjoining features even if they are in 
separate maps, and the ability to set a master (aka unmoveable) feature 
is critical in case you need to align more than 2 features (eg: 
Municipal boundary with cultivated land with road), as you would not 
want a previously aligned feature set to "walk" whilst you are aligning 
a further feature set to it.

Thanks & chat soon,
Zoltan

the plugin lwgeom could be extended, adding snap to grid functionality.
I agree this would be useful.
contributions welcome.
all the best.

Hi
By what name is lwgeom in the plugin repository? I can't seem to find it.
Also, "snap to grid" is not what I'm thinking would be useful, but I'm 
not seeing it in relation to lwgeom.

agreed, snapping to grids is only a part of the story.
you can achieve a part of this by importing/exporting to/from GRASS, but again a
smoother more configurable solution would be preferable.
All the best.

Hi all,

I have noticed some problem with custom feature forms when using dates.
In my form I use a QDateEdit.
If I leave the field in QGIs as line edit, the date is not set in the 
widget.
If I set the field as calendar, it messes up the form.
Here it is in picture: http://imgur.com/a/X7chU

Is there any way to use QDateEdit???

Cheers,

Denis

Hi Denis,

I've had the same issue here.
After looking at the code, a QCalendar object is needed for a date
field. There is no support for QDateEdit.

yes, apparently it depends on the size of the raster (I'm trying with pretty large ones)

Thanks Piotr, QProcess did the trick. 

process = QProcess(iface)
process.start('dir')
process.waitForFinished()
returnedstring = str(process.readAllStandardOutput())
print returnedstring
process.kill()

I've had the same problems with master.   And when I load a project that
has an OL layer,  it crashed WGIS too.  It even crashes when I uninstall OL
and then load project with an OL layer.  So I edited the project file and
removed all references to OL, but that project still crashes QGIS. So I
finally deleted the mapcanvas extent in the project file and now the
project loads fine.

(just fast wothout overviews).

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7zt3t5mZi0ftLzhs5tSSYOmZxuO8Or1-+5D0jOEzZe7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

3liz has just released the first version of the plugin "Quick Export",
funded by the "Conseil G?n?ral des Pyr?n?es-Atlantiques" (France). It aims
to let the user export the active vector layer to CSV ( I must say TSV :
tab separated values), HTML, PDF and to the default printer, in one click.

Any feedback and contributions welcome !
Version 1.0 is tagged as experimental, waiting for users feedbacks

Full description here :
https://github.com/3liz/QgisQuickExportPlugin/blob/master/README.md

Best wishes

Michael

If I configure une layer as png8, the server displays an unreadable image: anyone

Hi Paolo,

I have the same issue on Ubuntu 12.04 servers. I discussed this with
Marco Hugentobler and he wasn't able to reproduce the issue on his
machine. My assumption is that it may be a some sort of library issue
and my hope is that this issue will go away once Ubuntu 14.04 is
released with newer qt and graphic libraries.

Here is what I found about the issue:

- - it only happens for purely black and white and purely grayscale output
- - if you have only the slightes bit of color you are fine. It is good
enough to e.g. have a gray or 230,230,229 - which still looks
identical to 230,230,230 - the issue is gone

As a workaround you could undo the commit titled:

Revision 8990b66eed2f00253653e64c0ceb695c08a359b7: WMS server: even
more performant png8 conversion

I would love to see this fixed or gone as well. It is annoying for me
to always have to patch QGIS server after each update.

Andreas

Hi,

I'm looking how to programmatically set on or off the snapping option:

"Enable snapping on intersection"

I can't find how! It seems not set in QGIS2.conf

without setting this option the QgsSnapper.snapToBackgroundLayers(...)
method doesn't return snap points.

thank you,

Hi

Since there is now a second user describing that problem, I'm going to 
revert the performance optimisation in master (I'm using it without

It works for me. Unit of the value (attribute value * multiplier)
should be that of project CRS. If the problem becomes clearer, please
report issue to GitHub repository of the plugin.

Thanks for your suggestions.

Hi Marco.
It's a pity to miss a performance improvement (and I do not want to be blamed
responsible for it ;) ).
Perhaps we can try to debug it during next week? I have a sever where I can easily
reproduce the issue.
All the best.

In my case, the issue pops up with a simple point layer.

Hi all.
The area in which an user can click around a point to trigger a popup is very small,
and it is quite difficult to hit it. Ren?-Luc from 3Liz had somewhat fixed this
months ago, but now the issue it seems to be back.
In any case, I think the area should be substantially larger, possibly configurable
(or it could take the setting from the Search radius option).
Opinions?
All the best.

Hi Paolo

No problem, I think reliability is more important for a server software 
than a small performance improvement.

Wouldn't be appropriate to backport this also to 2.2 branch?

Hi Devs,

pythin iface has a slot 'addToolBar' to add a toolbar to the gui.

but it seems that there is no way to remove it? At least I cannot find a
'removeToolBar' slot on:

http://qgis.org/api/classQgisInterface.html

(and my plugin is throwing an exception when I try to remove the toolbar
in my unload of my plugin, using the 'reload plugin')

am I missing something?

worth an issue?

Perhaps this has something to do with colour table?

Hello Rochard
Use del statement to remove toolbars:

#add toolbar
tb = iface.addtoolBar("My Toolbar)
#remove toolbar
del tb

Hi,
I find very interesting your project and I would like to contribute.

I would have two ideas:

1 - the possibility to load files. Obj and / or. Ply

2 - to integrate a system like the plug-in html image map written by
Richard Duivenvoorde in order to create a mini webgis

In this way we could have a 2D map queryable together a 3D map displayed

Do you think it might be a good idea?

ciao

enzo

Hi Paolo,

I'm verifying the code source of GetFeatureInfo and my code is still there.
With which client have you tested and found the problem ? WHich version ?

Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A28056B3E919A@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

I have some issues with QuickWKT and Zoom to Layer Extent.

Example WKT: POLYGON ((518036.41 6264805.47,518056.41 6264805.47,518056.41 6264825.47,518036.41 6264825.47,518036.41 6264805.47))

When I right click the layer and select Zoom to Layer Extent, it zooms very far out even though I can manually zoom in to the coordinates and see the rectangle.

This is using QGIS 2.2.0 - can anyone confirm this?

Regards, Casper

checking the code I can find that ticking "Enable snapping on intersection"
checkbox activate this callback

void QgsSnappingDialog::on_cbxEnableIntersectionSnappingCheckBox_stateChanged(
int state )

{

  QgsProject::instance()->writeEntry( "Digitizing",
"/IntersectionSnapping", state == Qt::Checked );

}


writing the option in the project...


there's is a reason why it is not set in QSettings

Looks like this setting is not exposed in the API of QgsSnapper or QSettings:

http://qgis.org/api/2.2/classQgsSnapper.html#addd2b16ecac193e56f7bdedd6b78ac59
<http://qgis.org/api/2.2/classQgsSnapper.html#addd2b16ecac193e56f7bdedd6b78ac59>  

and

from PyQt4.QtCore import QSettings
print QSettings().allKeys()

thanks Jacob

seems it works setting all QgsProject parameters as in:

void QgsSnappingDialog::apply()


My doubt is that probably should be useful to add a default option on
snapping/digitinzing as "snap on intersection background" getting all
layer in background by default.


I'll try to propose this new config option in Vienna next week... the
main reason to have a default behavior is that if you add a new layer
I expect snapping should work also with the new layer, but It doesn't
work if no one set list of snapping layer in the QgsProject (doing
apply in SnappingOptions)


thank you

Hi,

I'm moving this discussion to the developers list.

It seems the repo for QGIS on RHEL is broken. Is there any chance to see it
fixed soon ? Do you know who's maintaining it ?

Thanks !

What happens is that first the previously rendered image is shown
zoomed in, then in next map update (by default 250ms) it shows the
newly rendered map. If it takes longer to render the layer, it may
happen that empty map is shown. I guess this can be solved by keeping
the preview from previous rendering for each layer until there is
sufficient amount of new data to show.

Yes this is a side effect of MTR. I have removed the downloading
progress from status bar, because the situation is more complex now -
there could be more such requests at the same time and the existing
mechanism wasn't flexible enough to reflect that. I am thinking about
having some better progress reporting, maybe something to discuss at
the hackfest.

agreed, this would probably give a better user experience

ok, ready. giving no feedback at all can be really bad, especially in case of slow
connection, or server issues.

all the best.

I don't know the progress on refactoring LegendInterface by Hugo, but it
could be the place
where to show progress bar for each layer

I solved adding the same peace of code of the C++ apply method

in my case the code is

        project = QgsProject.instance()
        layerSnappingList = [layer1Id, later2Id]
        layerSnappingEnabledList = ["enabled", "enabled"]
        layerSnappingToleranceUnitList = ["0", "0"]
        layerSnapToList = ["to_vertex", "to_vertex"]
        layerSnappingToleranceList = ["0.300000", "0.300000"]
        project.writeEntry("Digitizing", "/IntersectionSnapping",
Qt.Checked)
        project.writeEntry("Digitizing", "/LayerSnappingList",
layerSnappingList)
        project.writeEntry("Digitizing", "/LayerSnappingEnabledList",
layerSnappingEnabledList)
        project.writeEntry("Digitizing", "/LayerSnappingToleranceUnitList",
layerSnappingToleranceUnitList)
        project.writeEntry("Digitizing", "/LayerSnapToList",
layerSnapToList)
        project.writeEntry("Digitizing", "/LayerSnappingToleranceList",
layerSnappingToleranceList)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Possible bug when turning edit mode off and on
	"too often"
Message-ID: <532C5A7B.9070501@geograph.co.za>

Hi Devers,
Using 2.2 on Win 7 64 - but this was also evident in 2.01 on the same 
platform.

I'm dealing with a number of shapefiles (2 point layers, 9 line layers 
and 18 area shape file layers) - the total number of geometry elements 
is not high (probably less <1000),  but there are still a reasonable 
number of vertices in the mapset.

I find that after toggling edit mode a few times (may even less than 
10), the time to save the layer edits increases to "minutes", and so 
does the time taken to toggle edit mode.

Last year November I was running around on a field trip with a laptop 
running QGIS 2.0.1 in the car all day, and occasionally it hung, so we 
rebooted and redid our most recent edits. I'll bet that that was the 
same issue as below.

Last week, now using v2.2 on my desktop I found that the above slowing 
down scenario started, and I just left the PC supposedly with a "hanging 
" QGIS. I came back much later and QGIS was responsive again until I 
touched the toggle edit button, or saved my edits.
I timed it and it took an hour and 5 minutes to be responsive again.

The same thing is happening right now, but it is currently only going 
dizzy for about 3-4 minutes.

I'm going to try restarting QGIS to see if that helps, if not then I'll 
re-boot and if it still does not help then that would suggest that the 
issue is with the data structure and not necessarily somewhere else.

But for now, has anyone else had these "slowing down" issues?

Regards & chat soon,
Zoltan

Hi Zoltan,

Please have a look at the following likely related issue:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9229

Try to start QGIS with --noplugins and see if that helps. If yes, 
upgrade your plugins and if this doesn't help you can use the issue 
linked above to find the affected plugin and file a bug for it.

Regards,
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Label position colliding
Message-ID: <1395420939795-5130393.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi devs,

Is there a way to prevent labels to collide features, see sample 
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/n5130393/analysis_ALERA.jpg> 
apparently the feature only works over the layer labelled. I would like the
labels to try alternate positions to not obscure lines. This can be done in
other COTS by using feature weight to assign importance

Also can we try to keep label withing BBOX of the print composer frame?

That's who maintains it. At this point though you might need to compile

Great !! Many thanks :)

Do you have an estimate of when you could be done ? (hours / days / weeks ?)

2.2 is not that easy because it requires qt>=4.7 and rhel comes with 
qt-4.6.2.
So without reverting some commits or compiling new qt packages (which 
likely have additional dependencies) this won't be an option.
Instead there are now new packages (qgis-2.0.1-2) available which are 
based on the latest release-2_0 patches (f802808)

I tested here in a docker container and was able to install (didn't do 
any more tests actually):

docker pull centos
docker run -i -t centos /bin/bash
--------------------
rpm -Uvh 
http://mirror.karneval.cz/pub/linux/fedora/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uvh http://elgis.argeo.org/repos/6/elgis-release-6-6_0.noarch.rpm
wget fedora.vitu.ch/EL/qgis.repo -P /etc/yum.repos.d/
rpm --import http://fedora.vitu.ch/Fedora/RPM-GPG-Key-vitu
yum update
yum install qgis

Hope this helps
Matthias

Hi,

I just tried, but still the same :
"Error Downloading Packages:
  qgis-2.0.1-1.el6.x86_64: failure: qgis-2.0.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm from qgis:
[Errno 256] No more mirrors to try."

:(

Hmmm... This looks more like a problem with connecting to the repo than
a package problem.
Maybe the following helps?

yum clean all
yum update qgis

if not, are you able to communicate with the server:

ping fedora.vitu.ch

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add Attributes,
	Features and Geometries to QgsVectorFileWriter
Message-ID: <DUB122-W183A2CF731BC3BEA01A588EE780@phx.gbl>

Hello
My goal is to write some features and geometries to a JSON file. I searched for examples however in QGIS 2 (I am using 2.2) something seems to have changed so it does not work. Here is a very simple example of what I want to do:

fields = QgsFields()fields.append(QgsField("name"))fields.append(QgsField("description"))writer = QgsVectorFileWriter("/path/to/file.geojson", "utf-8", fields, QGis.WKBPoint, None, "GeoJSON")feature = QgsFeature(fields)feature.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(1, 2)))feature.setAttributes(["name", "xyz"])writer.addFeature(newFeature)del writer

The result is a JSON file with the following content:

{"type": "FeatureCollection",                                                                                "features": [{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { }, "geometry": null }]}

So the feature is added but attributes and geometry are ignored. Do you have any idea what I am doing wrong? I also tried to create a memory layer:

layer = QgsVectorLayer("Point", "temp", "memory")provider = layer.dataProvider()layer.startEditing()provider.addAttributes([QgsField("name"), QgsField("description")])feature = QgsFeature(fields)feature.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(1, 2)))feature.setAttributes(["namex", "xyz"])provider.addFeatures([feature])layer.updateFields()QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormat(layer, "/path/to/file.geojson", "utf-8", None, "GeoJSON")

The result looks a little bit better:

{"type": "FeatureCollection","crs": { "type": "name", "properties": { "name": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::21781" } },                                                                                "features": [{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 1.0, 2.0 ] } }]}

But the attributes are still missing. Does anybody know how this is done correctly? Thank you very much!

Hi,

I have tried to place JSON objects on 3D terrain before (still in
local repository, see attached image). OBJ and PLY files might also be
possible to be loaded. However, these might be features for experts
because web server is required (It might be possible to avoid
cross-origin limitation by writing models into js file, but not easy
way) and all objects may not be displayed without any problems.

Sounds good. Not only popup attribute list for clicked object but also
label placement would be good features.

Thanks,
Minoru

I would recommend having a look at the pyqgis cookbook [1] there are 
some nice hands-on examples that should get you started.

Hi Matthias,
Thanks for the pointer - spot on - I am using many of the plugins 
mentioned..

I did look through the buglist before posting, but didn't notice that one.

Thanks again, and keep well,

Message-ID: <1395491212614-5130469.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi guys,

OS: Win 7 64-bit
OSgeo Installer: 32-bit
QGIS version: 2.3.0-Master
QGIS code revision: ab920ba

The MSSQL connection works fine in Valmiera (2.2) when i select and press
the add button to add a shape but in the master, i do the same thing and
when i click in add button, the QGIS master crash.


Can anyone report the same issue?

If yes, we need to put a ticket of this subject?

I have de .dmp file where i can send it? I Can put into a google drive
folder and share.

Regards
Jo?o

Yes it's a known issue the MS SQL driver is not updated yet.  I have
someone working on it and it should be in master soon.

 Features and Geometries to QgsVectorFileWriter

Hello

I found out that it works when I initialize the layer like this:
QgsVectorLayer("Point?crs=epsg:21781&field=name:string(255)&field=description:string(255)", "temp", "memory")

So my code looks like this:

---------------
layer = QgsVectorLayer("Point?crs=epsg:21781&field=name:string(255)&field=description:string(255)", "temp", "memory")
feature = QgsFeature()
feature.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(1, 2)))
feature.setAttributes(["namex", "xyz"])
layer.dataProvider().addFeatures([feature])
QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormat(layer, "/path/to/file.geojson", "utf-8", None, "GeoJSON")
---------------

But is there a possibility to directly write it to a file with the QgsVectorFileWriter without using the memory layer?

It would be nice if PyQGIS Developer Cookbook (http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/vector.html#writing-vector-layers) is updated, the second example still contains QVariant.

Thank you very much.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add Attributes,	Features and Geometries to QgsVectorFileWriter




Hello
My goal is to write some features and geometries to a JSON file. I searched for examples however in QGIS 2 (I am using 2.2) something seems to have changed so it does not work. Here is a very simple example of what I want to do:

fields = QgsFields()fields.append(QgsField("name"))fields.append(QgsField("description"))writer = QgsVectorFileWriter("/path/to/file.geojson", "utf-8", fields, QGis.WKBPoint, None, "GeoJSON")feature = QgsFeature(fields)feature.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(1, 2)))feature.setAttributes(["name", "xyz"])writer.addFeature(newFeature)del writer

The result is a JSON file with the following content:

{"type": "FeatureCollection",                                                                                "features": [{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { }, "geometry": null }]}

So the feature is added but attributes and geometry are ignored. Do you have any idea what I am doing wrong? I also tried to create a memory layer:

The result looks a little bit better:

But the attributes are still missing. Does anybody know how this is done correctly? Thank you very much!

Hi all,

student application period is over. There are four proposals related to QGIS:
 - QGis Plugin: Report generator out of spatial data
 - Schematization Plug-in for QGIS
 - LiDAR support for QGis
 - Unified "Add Data" dialog for QGis

I would like to ask mentors and other devs review and comment them.

Thanks

Hello again,

Still having issues with processing, QGIS master (942d5da) compiled
today. I have a script I wrote for GRASS that i'm trying to port over
to QGIS. I'm testing the first step to make sure it is going to work
before I write the whole thing; it consists of:

  1 ##dem=raster
  2 ##radius=number 4
  3 ##lrm=output raster
  4
  5 lpf = processing.runalg("saga:simplefilter", dem, 0, 0, radius, None)

If I run this script, I get the following error:

Oooops! The following output layers could not be open
lrm: /tmp/processing/caa3afc6e3c6437893392b173985697c/lrm.tif
The above files could not be opened, which probably indicates that
they were not correctly produced by the executed algorithm
Checking the log information might help you see why those layers were
not created as expected

The Log contains:

Algorithm local relief starting...
Converting outputs
Loading resulting layers
Algorithm local relief finished

If I run the same line in the python console, it works correctly:
>>> radius = 4
>>> lpf = processing.runalg("saga:simplefilter", "SR_50M_alaska_nad", 0, 0, radius, None)
>>> processing.load(lpf['RESULT'])

Results in the map being loaded.

Also, if I change the output folder in the processing settings to a
different location (in this case, tmp/processing in my home folder)
and run another algorithm in the python console, the RESULT key still
points to /tmp/processing/...

Any pointers on why the script doesn't run would be appreciated. I
didn't see an existing issue on hub.qgis.org regarding the output
folder issue, so it might be a new bug...

Thanks!
Eric

Not sure why this is happening. I will try to reproduce the error and
see if it can be fixed

This is not a bug. If you do not enter a filename, the output will
always go to a temporary file. The output folder that yu can set in
the settings  is the folder to be used when you enter a filename
without a path (like "myfile.shp", but not "/home/myuser/myfile.shp"),
not the folder to use for temporary files.

Thanks again!

I have also experienced extremely slow edit mode toggle on several computers
running W7 and OSGEO4W when the QGIS project has been opened for some hours.

I believe this might be due to accessing data through VPN. The QGIS projects
used has c. 10 small shapefiles and 1 or 2 WMS/WFS services included.
Restarting QGIS fixes the toggle edit mode issue for a few hours. 

While we're at the slow stuff: Also start of QGIS is very slow taking up to
2 minutes.
Closing VPN and restarting QGIS 2 times solves the slow QGIS start for data
not on a VPN network. The slow start is probably QGIS looking for data on a
not opened VPN network.

As you are reusing this thread, can you please also check if this also
happens if you disable all plugins too?

VPN or network related issues are for the dev pretty hard to fix,
because we cannot reproduce your setting to test.

I think the best way to be really sure that it is indeed the VPN that is
a problem, I would suggest to first check if it is maybe related to your
QGIS version/OS or computer, and see if it also happens from another
computer with a newly (that is without plugins) installed QGIS.

IF the problem still exists and is reproducable for you, then create an
issue/bug report for it, see:
http://issues.qgis.org/

Please provide as much information as possible, in your case because
devs cannot exactly mirror your system. Eg if you are on Linux, provide
the log output if you start QGIS from commandline, or on Windows provide
output via DebugView (see
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#log-output-on-windows)
Devs only have this output then to try to analyze your possible network
time-outs/connections.

Hello everybody,

I also work on a 2D map. I tried to render the texture image directly from
the input file (as base64) and it's working fine. Next step is to add click
event on both 2D and 3D.
We can keep in touch to do this task.

Ciao
L.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Wrong feature order after commiting changes
Message-ID: <1395601983534-5130555.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,
Recently I encounter strange QGIS behaviour after committing changes. Here
are steps to reproduce:

1. Start editing vector layer.
2. Add two or more new features.
3. Stop editing and save changes.

New features are added at the end of layer but in reversed order of
digitalization. This is present in QGIS 2.0, 2.2. and master (Win7 and Mint
15). Is this is expected behaviour or I should fill a a ticket (if there is
no one)? I think features should be saved in order that user digitize them.
This is also present if features are added from Python addFeature method of
QgsVectorLayer.

Regards
Piotr

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Labeling layers
Message-ID: <532FF8C3.5020100@oslandia.com>

Hi all (from Vienna :)),

I've been working on some evolutions of the AEAG "Mask" plugin. This
plugin allows to define a "stencil" layer on top of other layers. The
idea is to be able to highlight a part of the canvas by hiding
(completely or with some transparency) the other parts. And it has to
work when the atlas rendering is turned on, adapting the current
geometry to the atlas geometry.
A first step to integrate this into the core was to add a new "exterior"
filling mode. I've sent a pull request and the merging process is on its
way.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1254

There is still some tricky issues to overcome if we want to have
something properly integrated. One of the remaining issues is related to
labeling, because we want to be able to also hide labels from "masked"
parts, or to display them "below" the mask layer (in case of transparency).

There is some partial solution to that using kinds of hacks. For
instance, labeling expressions may be used for that, something like
"CASE WHEN contains($mask_geometry, $geometry) THEN ... ELSE '' END" or
using the 'show' data defined labeling field.

But this has some limitations : it is not very user-friendly, and the
spatial predicates must be choosen wisely, especially when on-the-fly
simplifications are enabled.

So ... I was thinking of something more integrated. And it might imply
to enhance a little bit the labeling engine.
I was thinking of :
- adding something like a label layer with a 'Z' ordering that the user
could place with drag and drop in the rendering 'stack'. I am not sure
yet of the technical details, and PAL possibilities or limitations here,
but there is apparently ways to define 'obstacles' objects for the
labeling engine. So labels from a layer would be placed with label boxes
from the layers below considered as obstacles.
- exterior fills would also be considered as obstacles (if they are opaques)
- label layer rendering would be mixed with vector layer rendering, so
rendering options avaiable to vector layers could be also used on label
layers (blending modes and so on).

Are there some interests for that ? Can you see other ways to do ?

	trackers
Message-ID: <CABr3zxWnhjcVsrGzQt=ePit4F9fHomBALnqbSFpWh-kzLwrhgA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

QGIS-Processing (former Sextante) has open tickets on two bugtrackers:

- the plugin bug tracker, built when it was a plugin, but with a lot of
active tickets -> http://hub.qgis.org/projects/sextante/activity

- the main bug tracker with a few open tickets ->
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues

I understand those two can't be merged in one go, because the
plugin-bugtracker has categories (QGIS-Processing SAGA GIS, QGIS-Processing
GRASS GIS etc) that don't fit in the main bug tracker. But this should be
solved ASAP, because the current situation is quite confusing

Regards
F.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems editing WFS in QGIS

Upon further investigation it appears that WFS authentication is 
broken.  Further testing shows that the Add WFS dialog does not display 
layers that require basic auth - even when the login is supplied.  It 
will only show the public layers.  Note that the WMS auth works great 
for me.

When you try to edit a WFS-T, I believe it is also failing to use the 
supplied login info.  Which results in the error I'm seeing below.

I've added the additional details to the existing bug at 
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9234

Since this makes WFS of very limited use, is this planned to be fixed in 
an up-coming release?  I'll happily be a tester for this!

Message-ID: <CAPTqJ6oV0rpFb1C8emDSNsCJzubF1on+b78g5kaCraYW_Cansw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello to everyone, i'm new to this mailinglist!

I've ha question about QGIS 2.2.0 API.
I've developed a qgis plugin in python for version 1.8 and now i'm
rewriting it for 2.2.0 version; i've encountered a problem:

i've defined a raster layer with QgsRasterLayer, eg.

rasterLayer = QgsRasterLayer(fileName, fileBaseName)

and i've defined a drawing style (with new rules of 2.2.0 APIs)

rasterLayer.setDrawingStyle('SingleBandPseudoColor')

So i need to define a color shading algorithm, in the same way that i used
with 1.8 version

rasterLayer.setColorShadingAlgorithm(QgsRasterLayer.PseudoColorShader)

but i see there's not

setColorShadingAlgorithm()

in new API....

Someone can help me to find a way to define it?

Thanks in advance

Nicola

I'm of the opinion that the tracker should continue to be the Plugin
tracker, not the main QGIS tracker. So I'd propse moving any
Sextante/Processing tickets from the main or linking them into the
Plugin tracker.

To me it's still a plugin, just a core plugin but big enough that it's
really a subproject. If we wanted to move the Plugin tracker as a
sub-project of QGIS that would also make sense.

Also Processing bugs aside from Processing not loading aren't
showstoppers for release.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi
I think Processing tickets should be in the main bug tracker, since GDAL
tools, fTools and Grass plugin tickets are also there.

Also, Qgis-Processing is a really big (and great) feature, that interests a
lot of users, so it makes sense to keep its tickets in the main tracker.

Regards
F.

As a sub-project, it would show up in queries of the main QGIS ticket
system, but at the same time be able to have it's own internal categories.

This to me seems the best compromise. It's really a big plugin with a
myriad of backends. That complexity is what makes it a little different
from the others mentioned. The others mentioned could be sub-projects of
the main QGIS too. In reality all of them are core plugins, but they are
still plugins. None of them are required to make QGIS work (boot). Hence
they each have their own category. The challenge here is
Processing/Sextante(I always call it by both since I do the the
possibility of Processing stuff that isn't sextante) needs it's own
categories/sub-categories.

Also it's really easy for use to try moving it to be a subproject and
then reassess (Takes about 30 seconds to move it). If it's still not
right then we can talk about how to move tickets.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Cleaning up the plugin queue
Message-ID: <5330A22F.2050803@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
After a short talk with Richard, I feel it is important to clean up the
unapproved plugin queue: we had about 40 plugins, some from 2012.
I'm writing the authors to ask for missing info, then I
approve/unapprove as I believe it is best for the project.
Of course I may be wrong, please forgive me: I think it is better to
approve a less than perfect plugin than leave dozens of potentially good
ones in the shade, and frustrate their authors and potential users.
Any suggestion and feedback welcome.

Agreed, the point of approval isn't to vet the quality of the program -
"experimental" is always welcome. I'd say anything with less than
perfect information/quality just be flagged "experimental".

I understood the intent of approval process was to prevent distribution
of malicious code, spam and other nefarious purposes.

yes, this is also the spirit with which I am revising them now.
You'll notice a spur of "new" plugins: please install and test them, and
promptly report any issues.
All the best.

Oops, my mistake. I have ##lrm=output raster in the header, but lpf = ...
Is the only line in my code.

I don't get the error message after changing lrm to lpf in the header. I do
get another error message, but I think I broke my processing by trying to
force an update. I'll test it tomorrow. Sorry about the confusion!

Sounds perfectly reasonable. That's exactly the criteria I think this

Hello,

I open a new composer in QGIS with Python, and I'd like to zoom to the 
QgsComposition extent (like the "zoom to full extent" button in the 
composer).

I just can't find the way to do so.

I sought in PYQGIS cookbook, in Qgis API documentation, I tried to find 
the classes and methods used for this button in QGIS sources... (I 
basically want to include this already made code into mine, in Python)

Have you any idea?
Thanks in advance for any reply.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Debugging Python plugin with Eclipse: breakpoints
	do not wotk
Message-ID: <000901cf4805$cf65b7e0$6e3127a0$@ch>

Hi Everybody,

I'm new on QGis developing and Python and I'm trying to setup a developing
environment for building plugins on QGis.
My problem is that breakpoints on Eclipse do not work, process does not stop
on them.

This is what I do to debug:
1) On Eclipse I execute PyDev->Start Debug Server
2) On QGis I press "Remote Debug" button
3) On Eclipse I then see, under "Debug Server [Python Server]", a new node
named "unknown"

This is what I do to setup plugin and Eclipse project:
1) on C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\qgis\python\plugins I've created a
folder named "MyFisrtPlugin" with all files I need for a basic test. 
   This test work fine in QGis
   Code is nested by use of TAB
2) on Eclispe I've created a new PyDev project with 
	- Directory = c:\app\Eclipse\Workspace\MyFirstPlugin
	- grammar version = 2.7
	- Interpreter = Python 2.7
	- Create links to existing sources
	- Project External Source Folders = C:\Program Files\QGIS
Valmiera\apps\qgis\python\plugins\MyFirstPlugin
	- Referenced projects = none


Here you are in detail what I've done for installing and setup:
- I use Windows 7 64 bit

- I use QGis 2.2

- I've installed PyDev on Eclipse 
	- Help->"Install new software" set "http://pydev.org/updates" and
install PyDev

- I've configured PyDev on Eclipse 
	- Windows->Preferences choose page PyDev->Interpreters->Python
Interpreter, press "new" and set
		- Python 2.7
		- C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\bin\python.exe

- I've installed on QGis "Plugin reloader" and "Plugin builder"
	- Plugin->"Manage and install plugin"
	- Settings: check "show also experimental plugin"
	- search for "remote debug" and install (I did not find, check the
following section on how to install)
	- search for "plugin reloader" and install
	- search for "plugin builder" and install

- I've installed on QGis "Remote Debug" (it is not reachable by
Plugin->"Manage and install plugin")
	- download from https://github.com/sourcepole/qgis-remote-debug
	- copy RemoteDebug folder to C:\Program Files\QGIS
Valmiera\apps\qgis\python\plugins

- I've enabled Eclipse debugging:
	- create a general project
	- go to debug perspective
	- PyDev->Start debug Server
	- Open QGis and start Debug Remote
	
- I've made Eclipse understanding QGis API
	- Click Window=>Preferences=>PyDev=>Interpreter - Python
	- press "New folder" on Library tab
	- add C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\qgis\python		
	
- to enable pyrcc4 and pyuic4 I've set Windows system variables
	- PYTHONHOME = C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\Python27
	- PYTHONPATH  = C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\Python27\Lib


Any suggestion?...

Best regards

Franz

I've also taken a try with an alternate RemoteDebug plugin
(https://github.com/luipir/qgis-remote-debug) but with no luck.

It's strange... RemoteDebug is not in the list of installable plugins and
you have to manually download and install it. But on downloaded version,
inside metadata.txt, I find qgisMaximumVersion=2.99; so I guess that it
should be compatible.

I usually do it without using the QGIS remote debugger.

Message-ID: <53318745.2040209@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
QGIS core team is committed to provide everyone the best possible free,
libre, open source GIS. In this complex process, there are areas that
are more difficult to cover with either volunteer or contract work,
especially:
* bugs fixing
* backporting bugfixes, and
* packaging and releasing minor, bugfixed versions.
Our first experiments, drawing from our funds from sponsors and donors
to support ad hoc work from core developers, was a clear success (tens
of bugs fixed immediately before the release of QGIS 2.2).
In order to make this effort sustainable over the long term, we need
more resources. Please consider supporting us, by directly hiring a
developer or by sponsoring the project. We believe this is in your best
interest, especially for corporate and institutional users, as it will
allow us to release cleaner versions, with far lesser bugs.
Please do not hesitate writing the list, or to me directly, in case you
are interested.
All the best.

After some investigations with Process Monitor, we discovered that QGIS
2.2, during the operation of adding a WMS Layer, is querying continuously
the file "srs.db".

How did we discover it?

 - with QGIS installed on local hard drive, adding a WMS layer is
instantaneous;
 - with QGIS installed on a network samba folder, adding a WMS is very slow
because it is repeatedly accessing the srs.db file (hundred times!).

The problem doesn't occur with QGIS 2.0.

Maybe the SRS caching code is changed?

Hi Giovanni,

Many thanks for help, it works :)

But... it seems that, with this approach, dynamic breakpoints are replaced
by static calls of pydevd.settrace() written into code. I'm right?... This
can be good for simple scenario, but with complex code it could be tricky to
statically write pydevd.settrace() wherever you suppose to need a break.

So... that's a very good starting point for me, but I still need to fix
RemoteDebug (and use breakpoints) for developing scenario I would like to
open in the future.

Best regards

Francesco

Does the QGIS debugger starts correctly? I mean, does the message "PyDev
debugging active" appear?

+1 from me to make Processing/SEXTANTE subproject if

If you refer to option "RemoteDebug", that's what I do:
- On Eclipse I execute PyDev->Start Debug Server
- On Eclipse, debug panel, I see a root named ?Debug Server [Python Server]?
and a node named ?Debug Server?
- On Eclipse, console panel, I  read ?Debug Server at port: 5678?
- On QGis I press ?StartDebug? button
- On Eclipse, debug panel, I see a new node under ?Debug Server [Python
Server]? named ?unknown?

I don?t see anywhere the message ?PyDev debugging active?. Where would I see
this message, in the console?...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Duplication of functionality: Data-defined size
	and Size scale field
Message-ID: <op.xdadhfk3na7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

I'd like to discuss the future of symbol scaling :)

We currently have two ways of controlling symbol size using attribute  
values: using data-defined properties (newer) and size scale field (older).

Theoretically, the user could enable both but to me it seems that size  
scale field does not take effect if data-defined size is activated.

Additionally, size scale field had some issues, e.g.
"Size scale field does not work with symbol levels"  
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3659

For the sake of simplicity, I think it would be preferable to only have  
one control for controlling symbol size using attribute values. And for  
me, data-defined properties are the more refined and better working  
solution.

Can we move to git rid of the size scale field option?

Best wishes,
Anita

just a note... there's no alternative RemoteDebug plugin... my changes
where merged in the main project

https://github.com/sourcepole/qgis-remote-debug

In my case it works... now I can't rememnber If I set something particular
(and I've no time to check now)... what I can say is that remote debug
plugin connect pydev server only if it is strictly clearly started...
otherwise sometimes it does nothing.

so my procedure is... running pydev debug server... then start qgis... then
start remotedebug plugin then I start to debug

see you Luigi Pirelli

Message-ID: <CAFO80_odukEOafL-rto+ni-BQ-UfqEH_jN69vBjQGYCMaf9-MQ@mail.gmail.com>

my agenda is focused on add functions to rt_mapserver_exporter plugin to
support missing parameter passed to map file

first goal was reached negotiating a solution with mapserver team to allow
managing of external graphic  (svg too) thanks to introduce a validation
block check in applySld mapscript api (
https://github.com/mapserver/mapserver/commit/e18424940d5c48391c61cf62b0bda883805bc871
)

next steps are to investigate how to integrate current
rt_mapserver_exporter code (that use SLD interface) with some missing
feature inspiring me from the Hugo Mercier fork of the same plugin.
The goal is... programmatically add new symbols and manage some not managed
parameters from qgis sld as GAP in point pattern.

Guess no one has looked into this since you last emailed about the

to fix.

I don't remember there is need of a key to upload plugins... am I wrong?

"git push origin master"
could be a problem related to you remote git repository configuration?

ciao Luigi Pirelli

I guess so since you're telling me so let's say that I choose SCM ->
Git inside my hub.qgis.org
account and name it "my_plugin", then I would have to add this
repository with git inside my local folder:

git init
git add .
git commit -m 'init repo'
git remote add origin gitosis at qgis.org:my_plugin
git push origin master

and it should be working
right or am I missing something?

Hi,

I'm giving a quick look into the gsoc PR
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/11

Frankly speaking it's a very good student exercise, but I dont' think it's
production ready.

It's missing basic validation, unique constraints, i18n strings,  list
views, integration with the main app and there are a few cosmetic issues.

I'm busy on other tasks and I don't want to work on this. Is there anybody
willing to complete the job?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Duplication of functionality: Data-defined
 size and Size scale field
In-Reply-To: <op.xdadhfk3na7rjy@anita-pc>
References: <op.xdadhfk3na7rjy@anita-pc>
Message-ID: <1395777476158-5131055.post@n6.nabble.com>

agreed, current situation is confusing and prone to bugs.
first drawback of proposed solution: advanced fields were a bit more user
friendly (user interface> no formula), and data defined settings are hidden
one step deeper in dialogs. I also remember how trainees reacted last week
when I explained data defined properties: lost..

If we do that, we need to find a more readable interface interface for data
defined properties. It is unclear to the user if some options are activated
in there or not. A visual flag could do the trick, or a complete gui review,
to avoid another subdialog. (hierarchical view is the current ergonomy
option, and I like it).

I'm really wondering if the right solution could not be an assistant asking
for min size, proportional rules to apply( linear, square tail, improved
square tail (exp 0.57) .. ) and showing and generating a legend preview
based on a data sample. Assistant will then fill the right expression in
data defined expression, and tell the user where to find it. 

I have been sharing thoose thoughts with Martin Dobias who has legend
refactoring in his roadmap. Martin, any opinion?

Cheers
R?gis

Hi Vienna hackfest participants

tomorrow (Wednesday) I would like to have a session on QGIS Legend
(the thing on the left side of map canvas) and its future - starting
from 10:00. I am planning some refactoring of the legend widget and it
would be great to discuss various possible future use cases - the
refactoring may help to make our dreams come true :-)

Some items from my wishlist:
- make legend available in GUI library
- split legend into model/view architecture
- allow more flexible display of symbology in legend
- make legend easily customizable
- inline editing of symbols

Cheers
Martin

hi,

just a little input from my last QGIS beginners course. Many (!)
participants did not understand that toggling a layer group swutches ALL
layers on/off instead of the visible layers. Infact if some layers of a
group are visible toggling the group activates ALL layers (and may
result in QGIS trying to render a big bunch of layers).

May be there are alternative (or customizable) ideas.

Martin - I'm not sure if it falls outside of the scope of this but an
idea which has been bouncing around my head is the ability to set
transparency and blending options for a layer group. Here's how I
think it should work:

- Have a setting for layer groups for something like "render child
layers together"
- If this is set, then all child layers from that group are first
composited together onto a blank image using their individual layer
blending/transparency settings
- This entire group image is then composited onto the map using the
group's transparency/blending setting

There's two main use cases I can see which would benefit from this:
1. I've played with exposing the various QPainter masking blend modes
to QGIS (see DestinationOver, SourceIn/DestinationIn and
SourceOut/DestinationOut at
http://doc.qt.digia.com/qq/qq17-compositionmodes.html ). However,
since these modes currently apply to all underlying layers in the
stack (including the canvas background color) the end result is
confusing and not very useful. If the scope of the masking operation
was restricted by the process outlined above then it would be possible
for these masking modes to only apply to underlying child layers from
the same layer group.

2. Sometimes it's cartographically desirable to have several layers
completely obscure each other (100% opacity), but be rendered as a
group with some level of transparency.

I'm happy to code this up myself sometime, but if changes are being
made to how layer groups operate then it may be beneficial to consider
the possibility of layer group settings like this for the future.

I think the ultimate solution would be to port the data defined gui
control which is used in the labelling settings over to symbology.
Larry's done a great job with this control and it's behaves very
nicely - it's much easier to set fields, copy expressions, temporarily
deactivate expressions, and see immediately if a setting is data
defined.

I'm hoping during 2.4 to make some composer item settings data
definable, and I plan on using this same control. It would be nice to
add it to symbology too so that there's consistency across the entire
QGIS gui.

The runalg method does not return a layer. It returns a dict with the
outputs of the algorithms. Keys are output names, values are paths to
output objects

Hope this helps

Hi !

Great news !
(by the way, I'm crossposting to qgis-ux as well)

I've been thinking about this a little and have some more long term ideas I
want to share (see the mockup below, it may be more clear):

1. Trivalent checkboxes (neutral, visible, hidden) (#5787)
When neutral, a layer/group is shown if it's parent is shown (top level
neutral elements are shown).
When hidden, a layer/group is hidden regardless of its parents.
When visible, a layer/group is shown regardless of its parents.

This would make big groups much more usable. Cinema4D's object manager
features this, and its very efficient. Also Qt's checkboxes can be tristate
out of the box, so it may not be that hard to implement.


2. Display the data source as an icon in a column on the left (not
indented, separated by a thin vertical line)
The icon would help to know whether it's a WMS, Shapefile, postgis, etc.
layer.
The icon would be grayed out when the source is unavailable.
Right clicking on the source would only source related actions (subset,
relink source, save data as, open in db manager, ...).

It would make the distinction between layer and source much clearer. This
distinction is obvious for experienced GIS users, but I've seen a lot of
beginners being very confused because of that (software working with
external links/files are quite rare for common usage). We could also
display the "edit pencil" on the source, giving one more hint to the user
that he's not modifying the QGIS file, but the datasource behind.


3. Display labels/diagrams/actions/etc. as icons just after the layer's name
Allow for quick toggling of those frequently useful features.
Right clicking allow for related actions (edit, set label expression, etc.)
Imagine what plugins could add there !! Any per-layer setting could be
shown as a tag. Think of Anita's TimeManager or Minoru's qgis2ThreeJs... We
could put the snap settings there too, or new features like alternative
styles, saved feature selections, snap settings, .... !!!

Again, this is how Cinema4D's manager works (they call those icons "tags",
and C4D makes extensive use of them). In their version, they align all the
tags after another vertical bar, which may be the most elegant way to solve
the layout with long layer's names.


Conclusion.

I think it's worth making the Legend GUI a bit more rich than it is now.
This is the part of the GUI where the users spend most of their clicks, and
IMO the potential efficiency bonus is by far worth the small
complexification. And it's not only complexification, it's also
clarification.
The segregation of source/layer/addendi in the legend GUI will be very
powerful in combination with contextual menus. By having three different
contextual menus, we'll be able to have much more actions at finger tips,
without over-crowding the menus.




About Nyall's idea :
+1 !
It could be implemented as it is in Photoshop, i.e. group's blending mode
is "transfer" by default, which simply draws the children as if there was
no group. But setting the group's blending mode to anything else
("normal","multiply",...) composites the group as one layer, and blends
that composition.
Having this in the legend UI rather than in the layer style would also make
the UI much clearer. Right now, the UI is a bit confusing because the
transparency at layer level, feature level, and at color alpha level are
almost at the same place.
In general, using Photoshop as a reference for the UI in regard of
layers/blending modes makes much sense since PS is the leader in that
matter (as a remainder, they just have a drop-down menu at the top of the
layer panel which applies to the selected layer).


What do you think ?
If the community likes the principles, I'd be happy to work on the mockup a
bit more (by integrating Nydall's suggestion), so we can have a common
reference for further development.

Anyways, I'm very happy to know some improvements are in preparation !


Kind regards,

Olivier

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR98i9sDTh0H6CD2W3S4jPQLwWi2aYgez_Ej30GuBgV2_A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've mostly finished the labeling unit test framework (at least for *nix).
You can read about the setup in its README [0] and about the local test
server [1], if interested.

I'm happy to report that there is considerably good parity between all
outputs now (at least from my testing on Mac), especially since the advent
of mulit-threaded rendering. However, there are only a few actual unit
tests right now. The only outstanding issues revolve around too much
antialiasing in test renders.

There is still some CMake coding to do, adding modules for the now-required
utilities when ENABLE_TESTS=ON. These are currently:

* lighttpd (local HTTP server)
* spawn-fcgi (qgis_mapserv.fcgi spawner)
* poppler, with cairo support (composer PDF -> image rasterizer, for
comparisons)

There still needs config files set up for lighttpd/spawn-fcgi on Windows.

I'll be triaging labeling bugs and trying to fix them, while ensuring
regression tests are in place and passing. Then I'll add more unit tests
for general API stuff.

Lastly, I will be putting forth a proposal concerning a redesign of the
labeling classes, which includes rule- and style-based labeling. That will
come after an effort on the previously noted bug fixing.

Any help with the bug squashing (or anything related to this stuff) would
be greatly appreciated. :-)

A big +1 to this from me. Having an immediately accessible label toggle
checkbox in the layer control is one of the few things MapInfo does right...

Thanks, I knew they returned dictionaries, but I forgot to change the
call to runalg to have lpf as the output argument. The script executes
with the SAGA algorithm.

Hi Olivier,

I like your ideas, currently the layer settings dialog is a bit crowded 
and easy access is certainly a plus. More comments below.

What you write about beginners is also my experience in several courses. 
So a big +1! I would like the distinction between layer and source 
related settings.

Hm, some thoughts (all IMHO):
- wouldn't it be more intuitive to left click on an icon (which would 
then open the layer settings with the appropriate section). Right 
clicking in the way you describe could be implemented additionally.
- Although this would be nice to have it makes the legend a lot broader 
which might be a problem on smaller screens.
- I would not put diagrams there as they are much more seldomly used 
than labels. I think most common usage is the style but I cannot see an 
icon for this in your mockup.
- +1 for having the snap options there (in addition to the dialog we 
have now).
- The current behavior (opening settings by double clicking/context menu 
on the layer name) should stay. I understand your proposal as an 
additional way to get there.

+1 !
really nice mockup.
I would add another visibility state for layers that are checked, but are
not visible due to scale visualisation threshold. 

A word about tooltips over those elements. We could then have the current
datasource tooltip on the datasource icon, and a tooltip showing metadata
title and details of the layer, when the mouse goes over the layer's title. 

Finally, I we manage to have working legend for varying size , we should
take attention that some symbols could be larger than today.

I think the left click on an icon could simply toggle the setting on/off.
Opening the layer settings could be the first item in the context-menu +
middle click + shift or control click, so it's easily accessible.
But I agree the central place to define the settings should remain in the
layer properties dialog (even if I find we should emphasize the distinction
between data/layer a bit more in this dialog too).

>
I thought the icons would be shown only if relevant. Of course it makes no
sense to display a "diagram" label for every layer, but it makes a lot of
sense to display it for the one or two layers that do display diagrams. The
user could delete those icons, which would simply disable them, and to
display them again, one would have to reenable the corresponding feature
from within the main layer properties dialog.
And it's true that symbology the could be displayed as an icon too. Maybe
one could have several symbologies on one layer, and clicking them would
simply activate one (and deactivate the others), since toggling off a
symbology doesn't make sense.

One very powerful and intuitive feature would then be to be able to
move/copy those icons from one layer to another. A very convenient an easy
way to copy symbology/labelling style/snap settings etc. (I think I read
some discussions about implementing the ability to copy/paste/import/export
only parts of the layer's properties).
Again, that's exactly how C4D works, and it's very pleasant to use. I'd be
happy to make some screencasts if you think it may make it more clear how
this works.

Yes definitely.

R?gis Haubourg :

True, that should be displayed in the legend too. It could be an icon too
(again, this would allow for easy and consistent copy/move/enable). If the
icons support different visual states.


Best,

Olivier

Hi Piotr,

The order comes from the provider, in this case it's ogr. We don't/can not
control the order in qgis.

Nice mockup Oliver!
I like the idea of putting the "tag" icons after another vertical bar  
since I hope that it would look cleaner if the icons are aligned.

Looking forward to the discussion.

+1 The labeling solution (with the small icon to the right of every  
setting that can be controlled) is much better than the current  
button+dialog solution in the "Style" tab.

I'll open feature requests for this.

Best wishes,

Hi all

This discussion is very interesting indeed. I am thinking about some
features we already talked about in the past and which could be great to
have (but which can be antinomic...)

* let the user choose an image for the legend instead of the QGIS image.
SVG would be the best format for this. Imagine complicated expression based
rules. I am not sure we can have an robust programmatic way to build an
automatic legend image taking all QGIS style capabilities into account
(expressions, rules, blending mode, etc.). Sometimes, an SVG image made in
Inkscape would be the way to go

* display the legend as an interactive tree to let the user deactivate one
or several rules or classes. Toggling one of the classes will just hide the
corresponding features in the map. I think the feature would be a great
addition, but it is a different approach that just diplsaying an image.
What about having both options if possible : the user could decide layer
per layer if the legend must be interactive (with checkboxes) or if he just
want a static image to be generated and displayed.

* As Regis Haubourg often recall, it could be great to have an option to
parse the vector layer data and display a legend which takes expressions
based style into account, for example for proportionnal circles or coulours
depending on an expression. But as I said before, it can be tricky to
generate a good looking image for some styles;

ok, makes sense to me but if different symbologies why not having 
different labels or different diagrams. This would become too 
complicated, I am afraid. One anything per layer is ok IMHO. If you need 
several symbologies use several layers or rules.

Or better grey them out to be consistent with the rest (greyed out = not 
visible) but keep their check state. Layers could even be greyed out 
because they have no feature in the current map extent. So a grey layer 
name would indicate that you cannot see this layer in the current map. 
Possible reasons are:
1) layer is not set visible
2) scale thresholds are not matching current map scale
3) no features in current map extent

Bernhard

Hi all,

thanks to Alex, now Processing/SEXTANTE bugtracker is
a subproject of QGIS. All Processing tickets should be visible
inside main QGIS tracker, but for submitting issue one should
use Processing tracker.

Please test. If this solution will not work fine for us we can always
restore previous state.

Great, thanks Alex.

I see a minor issue: users who are not aware of the Processing tracker will
probably open tickets in the main tracker with the general category
Processing/Sextante and won't be able to specify which is the affected
backend (the Processing bug tracker has a subcategory for each backend:
SAGA GIS, GRASS GIS etc).

A possible workaround would be to replace the category Processing/Sextante
with Processing/SAGA GIS, Processing/R, Processing GRASS GIS etc.

Thanks
Regards

Do you think Larry would be willing to apply the labeling solution to

One small issue: Sextante bug tracker/subproject is not listed on  
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis

For those who have trouble finding it:

Hello all,

before issuing a feature request, I would like to know if QGIS 2.2
offers the possibility of having a default format for bitmap output in
composer.

So far, offered formats are alphabetically ordered and, everytime you
save a composition to bitmap, you have to choose through all the
combobox.  Maybe it would be better to, at least, have the chance to set
a preferred file format or just recall the last used.

But I have been looking throug QGIS and Composer settings and I haven't
found such option... Is there any other place to look?

Best regards,


Jorge Tornero

Is it possible to share results somewhere for those who interested,
but can't attend in person? For example I was thinking about
establishing QUG here in Ukraine

upcoming QUGs
If you can, please join us on IRC #qgis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [BUGFIX] 9234 - WFS client doesn't expose Header
	Authorization
Message-ID: <5332B39B.8020605@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I have opened a pull request to fix the bug #9234 - WFS client doesn't 
expose Header Authorization.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1266
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9234

Like for the others OGC providers: WMS and WCS, the user can set the
login and password to access to WFS protected data. But the QGIS WFS
provider doen't expose header authorization. It doesn't use login and
password.
This mean that QGIS is not able to acces to WFS protected Data. It can't 
be used to edit vector data through the web with user adminsitration.

I would like to see this fix backported so that we don't have to wait 4 
months before we can use QGIS to edit data through WFS with authorization.

Regards,

Hi Paolo,

I think we could not prevent them but we could release a bugfix version.

Thanks Nathan,

But this behavior is also present in SpatiaLite and Memory Layers which
AFAIK are different providers than OGR. I also try to test postgres provider
in home.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin approval: current state
Message-ID: <5332CD88.6010302@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Just to let everybody know: I'm going on testing and approving plugins.
This is my workflow:
* check that a link is present for main info (code repo, bugtracker,
home page)
* check that the links are correct
* if not, write the author
* check that the plugin has nothing unusual (e.g. we have an apprently
simple plugin with a 2.5 Mb resources file, mostly binary)
* case, ask
* if necessary, ask for sample data
* check installation and basic functioning
* open tickets as appropriate.
If/when all goes well, I approve the plugin. If I find not too serious
bugs during the above process, I flag it as experimental.
A problem I'm encountering is that many authors do not reply to email,
so we have to decide what to do in these cases (maybe approve the plugin
as deprecated?).
Any suggestion on how to improve the workflow, or help in checking, will
be appreciated.

Hi Alessandro,

Thanks for switching! So good to have the new site online!
Whom can I talk to about some fine tuning of the style, e.g. the headers  
in the left side bar which are currently still using images from the old  
design.

Best wishes,
Anita

That's because it's a subproject of QGIS-Application
I don't think it can be in 2 places at once, so not sure on the solution
here.

It's really easy to move existing tickets. What I was looking for but
didn't find yesterday was a way in a New Issue to assign it to a
Sub-Project. If we do that it might be easier for tickets to end up in
the right place to start.

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugins.xml slow
Message-ID: <5332FDE3.1020602@wildintellect.com>

I've been seeing reports that the plugins.xml is slow
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml

I know there is work to move this to the Docker hosting.

But I had another idea. I'm assuming that it's currently generated out
of Django. I think we need to find a way to put a cache in place to make
the server response faster. Obviously a cache would be tricky if a new
plugin is uploaded. But the cache expire is say every 10 minutes, that's
still only 6 reloads of the view per hour instead of how many hits from
people checking plugins (100s-1000s per hour).

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/
FYI we should cache this file in RAM since it's 1 small file.

Looking at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/views.py

I see that it might be tricky because the server is trying to filter the
list before sending to the user. Maybe there's some way around that like
redirecting users to a slightly different url when they request 1.8
plugins. No change necessary on the desktop side if the fetch is allowed
to follow to a different url.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alessandro,

just found minor cosmetic issue. When I use "About plugins" link in
top menu, browser title changes to "QGIS - -". Same for "Planet" and
"User map". Only for "Plugins" item correct title shown:
"QGIS - Python Plugins Repository".

So Nathan noticed the website wasn't coming up. Specifically
"The requested URL /en/site/ was not found on this server."

I believe the issue is disk space. I'm guessing the sphinx is built
elsewhere and transferred in on a schedule without checking how much
space is left on the server. I got to this conclusion by noticing that
other languages are working fine.

Looking at the space:
There are 10G of backups in various places, all current
There's also 6G of apache logs of various sorts. We should find
somewhere to archive things over a few months old.


Temporarily I'm moving all *.gz files in /var/log/apache2 over to the
osgeo downloads machine in my user home folder. Frees up 1.5 GB, leaves
last 2 logs for all services intact (ie log and log.1)

I did not touch the www_qgis.org folder inside apache2.

Thanks,
Alex

PS: Now that the osgeo backup server is in place, we can talk about
backing things up to it, and about reallocating more space to the qgis VM.

Yep disk was full again. Site is still being build on the same server,
and ends with a move/relink/remove-old step (apparently even when the
build process died in the middle)... Have to fix that.

Fact that only english was affected was because only english and polish
(new) was being rebuild...

Thanks for that. Untill now we moved plugins.qgis.org to new server, but
are waiting for some time to remove old one.
I'm also trying to clean up now.

Besides admin/doc things, one of my plans for this HF was to make it
possible that the context-help content should come from the
documentation (that is deeplinking to either the website (first step)
and then to a local copy of the website (second)).

To me this seems nice because:
1) we have one place for all documentation: maintainebility of txt
2) looks better (I think :-) )
3) no double translation

Anybody comments or willing to help? I'm probably in need of some deeper
Qt/cpp knowledge.

Oggetto: [Qgis-user] lidar visualization in qgis

I would like to start a discussion about the minimal functionalities that a
new lidar plugin or a  core function  should present.

Based on my experience the minimal requirements are:

- to read data in LAS format
- to visualize points based on classification or intensity
- to allow the filtering of points based on classification
- to allow the selection of points with spatial relationship with other
layers
- to export filtered points or selected points in LAS format

Well, it is easy :-)

1) move builds to qgis2 (prefereably in a docker, but can start plain)
2) apache config (there is a lot of redirecting/old fixes involved)
3) dns update
4) check fix check fix check fix etc

feel free to help or do it. It is better if I'm not the only one
doing/being able to do it.

Eggs in one basket?

Why not load balance 2 servers in different parts of the world?
Bandwidth at OSUOSL is unlimited, hardware is already paid for (It's
raid SAS drives, not cheap hardware).

Sharing people time also helps. I was the only one awake when this issue
came up because I'm in the western US. I'd also rather see SAC and QGIS
admins work together, not just divide into territories.

I got involved with SAC as my way to contribute to QGIS originally, but
now find myself guessing and without the ability to help on the new
servers at all. So I'm all for experimenting with the right balance, and
hope we can collaborate. Part of the point of the shared hosting is that
QGIS server admins benefit all OSGeo projects if there's an incentive to
work together.

I'd prioritize upgrading Redmine and fixing the missing ssh key
management over moving any other sites. That's the site that cause the
most trouble in terms of hosting. Then there's things like CDN/DOS
protection, SPDY optimization, https for all downloads, caching. All
sorts of better ways to spend time than just shuffling static
html/sphinx all over the place.

Thanks,
Alex

Shall I create a new container on qgis2?

Hi,

Project -> Export DXF is only for exporting DXF, while dxf to shp is
about importing.

The import of QGIS through OGR is still unsatisfactory. I would still
keep this plugin around.

It seems to still work in master.

The bug mentioned is probably because the user used a format version
that is too new. Also OGR would not be able to load such a file.

I also agree with Alex when it comes to ssh ..
That's still a big issue ..

load balancing would be nice too ..

http://plas.io should fulfill or nearly fulfill all of these requirements at this time.

The only requirement is a WebGL-capable web browser.

FYI, you just need to give Martin Spott the IPs that we need to
whitelist for OSGeo LDAP. Also it would be nice to get access to help
out. We can easily provide our ssh public keys.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS & QGIS: the future
Message-ID: <5333FAEC.4010709@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I learned during dinner that GRASS7 RC1 is due very soon. This opens the
issue of its functioning in QGIS. IMHO:

* the qgis-grass-plugin might stop working (this has to be tested)
* some of the module options will be different
* new modules will not be available in QGIS.

I think we can deal with this in several ways:

* dropping the plugin, and concentrate the work on Processing
* upgrading both the plugin and Processing.

In the first case, we have two major issues:

* upgrading Processing GRASS modules
* changing the current Processing behaviour, avoiding the import-export
phase when piping consecutive GRASS commands; this makes GRASS modules
slower than the equivalent commands of other backends.

While the first issue can be solved easily by a couple of people in a
few days, the second one is more tricky, and requires hard coding skills.
In addition, we'll no longer be able to edit GRASS vectors directly.

In the second case, we'll have more work, and a not-so-nice duplication.

I would like to have an open discussion on this, avoiding things to just
happen, with the possible negative consequences.

All the best.

Anybody helping here, either here or from remote? I think this would
streamline our translation and documentation process considerably.

Hi Alex,

whitelisting ip's is done. Thanks.

please sent me or macho your public key and usernames you want to use on
qgis2, you'll have acces.

Hi Paolo,

my QGIS/GRASS usage is as follows:
1) To process in GRASS I I do neither use the plugin nor processing but 
"native" GRASS
2) I use the plugin to visualize the results, especially together with 
data in other formats (shp, raster) which I otherwise had to import into 
GRASS
3) I use processing but not with GRASS processes.

So I would propose a third way which negotiates between the two ways 
porposed by you:
* upgrade processing and reduce the plugin to those features not covered 
by processing (visualization, digitizing ...)

IMHO if someone wants fast processing with GRASS modules he should do it 
in GRASS, if automation is needed a shell script is the way to go, so no 
need to change processing in the proposed way (no export/import if 
consecutive GRASS operations), though this would be nice to have, of 
course :)
If there are many persons out there that use processing for consecutive 
GRASS processes and think this is too slow and are not capable of doing 
it in GRASS, please step forward!

my 2 cents

Bernhard

For the time being people can certainly continue to work with GRASS 6.

I think that the plugin needs to be "cloned" for GRASS 7.

There might be only a few which could be of interest here (e.g. the
highly specialized evapotranspiration modules not but some others
yes). For an overview, see

http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures

(the second: yes)

I'll do that. I already started with Pirmin and Victor to discuss it.

... this would not be a good idea.

I expect that we'll come up with a "Processing" prototype for which
supports GRASS 7 soon.

I would vote for dropping the plugin and just updating the processing
plugin.  Having both ways is bad for us and bad for users, even worse when
some functions are missing from one but not in the other.

I understand well the point; however, the plugin has additional
functions, e.g.:
* a grass shell
* a grass data browser
* a grass digitizing environment.
Whether these are important or not, it's a matter of users.
All the best.

Good point...
I'm not sure if would be a good idea to have the symbology as a tag
anyways, since every layer will necessarily have one, and it's a bit more
than just an optional addition to a layer, like the other tags are. The
only thing I'd like about having the symbology as a tag, is that it would
be easy to copy styles from one layer to another. But maybe, the current
copy/paste style is enough, especially since it's not that frequent to copy
symbologies from one layer to another.

Bernhard Str?bl :

Ok for 1&2, but I find 3 is an overkill. Not seeing the content because of
looking somewhere else doesn't mean the data is hidden. It may make the
whole graying out of invisible layers thing less readable.
But another reason to gray out would be "the data source is unavailable".


I updated the mockup, with the aligned tags. I find it more clear and it
may solve the concern of the width for small screens : it would be possible
to completely fold the tags part (and maybe even the sources part), so to
display  the legend as it is now.

About the opacity/blending mode, I think the most consistent UI
implementation would be to use tags as well : any layer with no (or
disabled) blending tag has 100% + normal (or "transfer" for groups).
Changing those would require a blending tag.

I'll see if I manage to open a wiki page so once we've got an agreement on
the mockup we can keep reference to it.

Best,

Olivier

I test to compile QGIS master with GRASS7 but it doesn't work, the
GRASS7 directory it seems not be recognized bu QGIS.
Can I open a ticket on QGIS bug tracker?

I'm not using at all GRASS from QGIS, so I think could be useful make

Hi, 
processing is also limited only to some tools that have input and ouptut. 
I think Grass plugin remains necessary (it is to me). Another point,
processing is not yet in a production state, under high developpement, when
plugin is. We should take some time before thinking of dropping a stable and
heavily used tool. 
Cheers
R?gis

Dear all,

>From my user perspective (I am using both GRASS and QGIS, or the other way around, depends on topic), processing is not really a replacement for the GRASS plugin.
It is handy and probably better for those who do not use GRASS but are interested in single functions / modules.

Yet, once you have a GRASS database with a considerable amount of data, the GRASS plugin is very valuable for accessing those data in QGIS (e.g. for cartography). Also users with no or little GRASS experience benefit from the GRASS plugin in cases where they have access to a GRASS database.
That way they can work on it without acquainting themselves with a "new" GIS in depth...

Concluding, if you have the possibility to maintain it, keep the GRASS plugin in QGIS!

Cheers
Stefan

Hi Larry

I finally have the time to sit down and try to get your recipe for building
/ debugging QGIS under QtCreator a try, but I cant seem to find your notes
on this. I have two screenies showing some of the settings but not quite
enough info to get it working. Currently I am getting this (see [2] below)
output when trying to run cmake in QtCreator. I am building using options
in [1].

I also made this dirty hack so that some python libs could be found [3].

Can you point me in the right direction of any notes etc you have?

Regards

Tim

Here is my opinion about this:

I think it might not be a good idea to get rid of the GRASS plugin and
leave only Processing, since there are some tools that do not fit into
Processing, So, at least for this tools, there should be a GRASS
plugin to make the available fro QGIS.

Having said that, I also think that the GRASS modules that are
actually processes (the have input and output and do some computation)
are much better in Processing, and it would be better to keep them
only there, to avoid confusion. For this, I guess that first we need
to implement some mechanism in Processing to handle layers in a GRASS
database (maybe not a easy task), so they are used just as a normal
layer. That would provide a seamless inegration, and allow Processing
to do all that a GRASS user might need in term of analysis.

In this scenario, I do not see a reason to use the GRASS plugin for,
let's say, calculating a slope layer from a DEM, when you can do it in
Processing. But until we have that, I guess it's better to keep it,
provided that there are people that still need it (basically people
with GRASS databases, as it has been said above)

my 2 cents

I would not say that ... besides copying labels or diagrams might be 
even more seldom. In order to be consistent I would favour symbology as 
a tag, too. Why do I have to use a context menu to copy the style while 
I can make a simple drag and drop for the diagram?

Hm, difficult, I could argue "looking with a different scale does not 
mean the data is hidden". The map canvas has a current scale and a 
current view port. Why should only the scale qualify for graying out and 
not the viewport?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Gui design - non modal layer properties dialog ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7nOP2YqBMfXenWrz7ZBfGSBzDfQB8PxbuhujFO_vHy7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I am not in Vienna, but still very interesting by the ongoing discussions.

I have one thing in mind which IMHO would be great to have in QGIS
regarding the layer properties dialog :

* Make it non modal, so that the user can still pan/zoom the map, or even
select other tools
* When the user changes the active layer, the whole content of the opened
layer properties dialog is refreshed with the layers properties.
* The active tab is kept. This way the user can for example check and
change the scale visibility for a set of layers. Or if I have opened the
dialog for the wrong layer, I can quickly change it by just clicking on the
right layer in the legend.

I am sure this would implies other problems (for example if the user tries
to use a different tool via QGIs menu), but I think this could be resolved
(for example, if the properties dialog is opened, deactivate some gui
elements to prevent unwanted actions).

Any feedback welcome !

Michael

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Is it possible to read a OGR datasource with
	EXecuteSQL statement?
Message-ID: <1395926342038-5131553.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I'm trying to developp a processing script that would save a lot of
complexity if I could open in qgis a ogr datasource using ExecuteSQL
statement. 
I'm reading my datasources with OGR python API with no problem, and a simple
SQL allows me to keep only one fields, and calculate on the fly area, maybe
intersections between ogr layers. 
I would like to know if it is possible to dynamically load that OGR
datasource as a QGIS layer, or if I have no other choice than writing a temp
file somewhere.. 

see that snippet inside a processing script (for automated GUI) where I
would like to load layersqlpg as a qgis layer:
--------------------
import os
import tempfile
from osgeo import ogr
ogr.UseExceptions()         # if something goes wrong, we want to know about
it
drivershp = ogr.GetDriverByName('ESRI Shapefile')
# dataSourceshp = driver.Open('three_points.shp', 0)#0--read-only

databaseServer = "vslin147"
databaseName = "refgeo2	"
databaseUser = "visu"
databasePW = "visu"

connString = "PG: host=%s dbname=%s user=%s password=%s"
%(databaseServer,databaseName,databaseUser,databasePW)

conn = ogr.Open(connString)
layerpg = conn.GetLayerByName('ref.admin_departement_ag')
layersqlpg= conn.ExecuteSQL("SELECT a.insee_departement, st_area(geoml93),
geoml93 from ref.admin_departement_ag a")
tempdir = tempfile.gettempdir()
outShapefile = tempfile.gettempdir()+'\output_ogrexecute.shp' 
outDriver = ogr.GetDriverByName("ESRI Shapefile")


Cheers, 
R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Next Code Sprint?
Message-ID: <5334280C.7020104@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
In the meeting about the location of the next Code Sprint, a general
consensus was reached:
* same period (Feb-March)
* probably same duration (Mon to Fri)
* probably Philadelphia.
We should decide whether to join "officially" or not (of course,
individual QGIS devs will always be welcome.
Since most of us are from Europe, I guess moving _en masse_ to USA will
not be an option, both because of logistic and financial constraints.
An alternative will be to participate, but also having "satellite"
simultaneous HFs in other locations, investing more heavily in efficient
communication (videoconferencing, etc.).
This will have the big advantage of facilitating the growing communities
in locations far from both Europe and North America (I'm thinking of
Australia, Japan, etc.).
Let's talk about it.
All the best.

That sounds very reasonable to me.

Proper GDAL/OGR handling for GRASS 7 would be very nice in any case (see http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2953).

As for a "GRASS data browser", I think, a plugin would be required with regards to user friendliness, because one needs to know what files to access from a GRASS data base when using GDAL.

I also understand that at some point in time one will have to use GRASS directly in order to access full functionality (e.g. ortho-rectification, nviz, mapswipe, animation and stuff), which makes the way Moritz suggests maybe even more reasonable...

Cheers
Stefan

If we are talking about accessing GRASS data for loading into QGIS, wouldn't it be a better idea to improve the GDAL/OGR handling in order to be able to load GRASS data just like any other data format ?

Maybe this could be split out into a specific plugin ?

+1 What I really would want is to be able to pan and zoom the map to be  
able to see how the style looks at different zoom levels and regions.  
Sometimes it's also necessary to use the identify tool while designing a  
style.

What's the worst case that could happen if we just make the dialog modal?  
Somebody could try to delete the layer from the layer list, or close the  
project, or ...

> * When the user changes the active layer, the whole content of the opened
> layer properties dialog is refreshed with the layers properties.

+0 That might be confusing if changing layers happens by accident because  
of a wrong click. The user might not notice and start misconfiguring a  
layer.

Best wishes,

Anita

I hope that we find the way to start these tools from QGIS. Tck/Tk nviz is
starting in this way. I hope that it will be possible to do the same for
g.gui.* modules.

Also, it would be nice if the QGIS GRASS vector digitizer (plugin/tool)
would use the same backend as vector digitizer in GRASS wxGUI (Python
subprocessing exit-safe wrapper). Now the first problem is that there is no
reusable backend in wxGUI.

Apparently there is no way to access to the underlying OGR datasource
object for a QgsOgrProvider.
So you'll have to use an OGRVRT.

It seems we really need to have such a mechanism in QGIS (using
Spatialite virtual tables for instance as discussed on this ML earlier)
... :)

Hi all,

Here is my wish list:

- To be able to access GRASS data within QGIS. Similar to PostGIS and other
GDAL/OGR data sources, it should be up to users to create GRASS
geodatabase/location/mapsets. QGIS will be able to simply add layers for
viewing and editing 
	
- Having access to GRASS shell. It will be a very handy shortcut to run
GRASS modules without the need to open GRASS. GRASS modules which are
available in Processing toolbox can use the same UI. Otherwise, user has to
run it in shell.

- Simple import data to the mapsets...similar approach as drag-n-drop for
PostGIS databases. Right-click and save as... in QGIS does a great work for
Export.


In summary, Processing toolbox should be a good one-stop for one-off use of
a specific GRASS module. But if a user wants to dig more, GRASS already
offers all that. For those who have already got their GRASS set up, they
should be able to view and edit their data in QGIS with the added benefit of
having access to shell.

Some of the stuff can be ported to plugin(s) as mentioned by others: e.g.
creating location/mapsets, setting region from qgis canvas or other qgis
layers, etc.

Cheers,

Saber

To: grass-dev
Subject: Re: [GRASS-dev] [Qgis-developer] GRASS & QGIS: the future

In the gvSIG CE project, we had to make the same type of decisions and came
to our own conclusions.

Allow me to summarize our reasoning, maybe it will be useful for the QGIS
project, as well:

1. The number one cause of irritations among novice users is having to set
up a GRASS mapset and having to understand how GRASS data management works.

2. The number two cause of irritations are the effects of importing vector
data with bad topology into a GRASS mapset.

3. The original QGIS plugin does nothing to alleviate (1).
No plug-in, however cleverly designed, can do anything about (2): garbage
in, garbage out.

4. GRASS "power users" gain very little (if anything) from running GRASS
through a host GIS, such as QGIS or gvSIG. But they do lose functionality,
such as the
d.* family of modules.

Therefore, we gave up trying to design a plug-in for advanced users. We
assume that such users will use GRASS through its native CLI and/or native
GUI.

The resulting design of the original SEXTANTE-GRASS interface (which is now
also mirrored in the Python re-write that became QGIS' Processing) addresses
users that either don't care much for GRASS' CLI capabilities and internal
data management, or are willing to switch to native GRASS as needed.

If you want to change this and address another type of user, then you will
need to re-examine the entire design of the current SEXTANTE/Processing
approach, which is to use only temporary mapsets and perform data
import/export every time a GRASS module is run.

You can optimize the I/O performance of Processing by using r.external to
directly access raster input maps. But there is little you can do about
vector data with the current design, as GRASS needs to build its own
topological data structures (and rebuild them every time you run a GRASS
module on non-topological input!).

In any case, I do not think that it is worth maintaining the original QGIS
plugin, since it is neither very well suited for novice nor advanced users,
IMHO.

Best,

Ben

Hi all.
Following the training Processing manual, modeler_hydro_calculator.rst,
I have a problem in adding reslts from Calculator: I add the suggested
formula, but when closing the popup all the connecting lines are
disappeared, and the calculation is gone.
Anyone confirms?
All the best.

I have actually always created my locations/mapsets in QGIS. Just made

Then once in GRASS usually went directly to using GRASS commands in a
Terminal. But I can see for non-Linux the shell inside the plugin would
be much more obvious. Perhaps a GRASS Launcher in QGIS would take it's
place.

And as others have mentioned, 99.9% of the time my cartography work with
GRASS layers is done in QGIS, including intermediary viewing of results
before additional steps.


Some of the other discussion about how to chain GRASS functions in
Processing without having to dump to file outside GRASS actually gets at
the biggest downside to Processing. If one has big data in GRASS or
Postgis, it needs to stay inside those tools - shapefile is not an
option. If we can some up with some way to encourage the various makers
of tools that end up in Processing to implement all GDAL/OGR drivers,
then we can pipe between things without having to drop to intermediary
formats outside of ram.

Thanks,
Alex

I will add documentation about this to the site [0]. I have been debugging
this setup and now having it working smoothly on Mac 10.7.5 and 10.9.2. You
can use the following notes for now and we can work on making the online
docs better, eventually including it in INSTALL somehow.

Basic instructions:

1) Ensure deps are installed:

Install required build Python modules (use pip on system or Homebrew's pip
when using its Python). You can also tap homebrew/python for some more
complex modules [1]:

* numpy  <-- this is used by gdal.rb install, if building with python
option, which is the default

$ brew tap homebrew/science
$ brew tap dakcarto/osgeo4mac
$ brew install qgis-22 --only-dependencies --with-grass --with-globe
[--with-oracle]

Install required run-time Python modules :

* psycopg2 matplotlib pyparsing

2) Copy the following directory elsewhere and use it from there:
HOMEBREW_PREFIX/Library/Taps/dakcarto-osgeo4mac/scripts

Note: it's important to not edit the scripts where they are located, in the
tap, because it is a git repo. You should keep that working tree clean so
that `brew update` always works.

Open and review scripts:

* qgis-cmake-options.py - for generating CMake option string for use in Qt
Creator when built off dependencies from homebrew-osgeo4mac tap. Edit CMake
options to suit your build needs. Note, the current script usually has
CMake options for building QGIS with *all* options that the current
Homebrew formula, e.g. qgis-22, supports, which can include things like
Oracle support, etc. You will probably want to edit it and comment out such
lines for an initial build. I add this as an external tool in Qt Creator
[2].

* qgis-set-app-env.py - for setting env vars in dev build and installed
QGIS.app, to ensure they are available on double-click run. Needs to stay
in the same directory as the next scripts.

* qgis-creator-build.sh - sets up the build environ and ensures the
QGIS.app in the build directory can find resources, so it can run from
there.

* qgis-creator-install.sh - installs the app and ensures QGIS.app has
proper env variables, so it can be moved around on the filesystem.
Currently QGIS.app bundling beyond QGIS_MACAPP_BUNDLE=0 is not supported.

3) Configure a Creator Qt version and kit [3, 4].

4) Configure Creator project with prepended environment variables and to
use the build and install scripts [5].

This whole setup supports builds where the OSGeo4Mac deps are in a
non-standard Homebrew location, e.g. /usr/local/osgeo4mac or
/opt/osgeo4mac, instead of /usr/local. This allows for multiple build
scenarios, including placing the deps on an external drive, though that
requires building all deps with special 'bottle' parameters.

I've tried to make the setup as simple and flexible as possible, though I'm
sure it can use some work.

Let me know how it goes!  :-)

Hi,

Are there any technical reasons why the new QgsMapRenderer*Job classes [0]
should not be exposed to Python interface?

Then renders could readily be output to QImage like in
QgsRenderChecker::runTest() [1], instead of direct access to QgsMapRenderer.

Thanks to all for the interesting comments. Obviously we have a varied
and rich ecosystem here, that's why I want to preserve it.
Obviously we all want to have all. IMHO the points are:

* can we (GRASS+QGIS) agree on a specific course of actions?
* can we find the resource to implement it?

Of course we could think of sticking with GRASS6, but I think sooner or
later this will be untenable (e.g. major distros will switch to GRASS7
once out), so better prepare now.

All the best.

The recent ugrade contained no changes in the validation rules, the only
change was adding the "about" field to optional attributes in metadata.txt

I think you're right Paolo. Flights and hotels to the US - even for only  
the core developers - would probably quite quickly reduce our project  
budget.

+1 Having video conferencing available - at least in one room - would also  
allow us to connect with developers all over the rest of the world and  
with interested users.
It would be great if anyone knows somebody experienced in  
videoconferencing who could help in setting things up.

Best wishes,
Anita

Exactly ! Not just for styling and labels, but also for other properties
such as actinos, fields, etc. . This will help a lot configuring some tools
.In the current state, the workflow is a bit exhausting sometimes :
change properties -> close the window -> check the changes (actions,
fields, lables, etc.) -> confirm you need to change the properties ->
re-open the windows -> change properties -> close the windows -> try, etc.

This is a good point. However, many softwares behaves like this. For
example Illustrator. When you select an object, all the properties panel
are refreshed or even changed if the properties are not the same that the
previous object. When you think about it, even the QGIS composer dialog
behaves like this : the "Object properties" tab is refreshed when you
select another object.

I think the user can learn this new behaviour. We can try to help him a bit
by writing the layer's name (title) in some place above the properties
dialog in big letters and a bright and shiny background. During courses, I
often have people who indeed open the properties dialog for the wrong
layer, but are not able to even see it because the layer name is written
only in the small upper window bar.

Quick interesting chat with Luca Delucchi and Martin Landa from GRASS
dev team.
One interesting option would be:
* to add GRASS browsing capabilities in QGIS file browser
* to add support to direct GRASS reading (possibly writing) in
Processing, and avoid import/export whenever possible; v.external and
v.out.external could be used for this; this is probably the thoughest part
* of course modules should be upgraded anyway
* GRASS direct digitizing can be skipped; heavy digitizer can use GRASS
directly
* keep a GRASS shell?
* with all the above, upgrading the plugin may probably be skipped.

Any thoughts.

Hi Devs (GRASSers and Others as well)!

I hope you enjoy and have great fun in Wien.  I am so sad that I could not 
join (various reasons) and assist in whatsoever. Thanks for the beta release 
of G7.

On the discussion of having (some kind of) access to GRASS via QGIS: it's so 
Important!  My most recent example was on the first week of March.  I had a 
wonderful experience exploring GRASS GIS through OSGeoLive7, along with 20 
people (unfamiliar with OSGeo in general). In order to understand GRASS's 
Locations & Mapsets, as well as the region extent, we choose to approach it 
via QGIS. The transition to GRASS was then so smooth, so nice. The integration 
of QGIS and GRASS was so attractive to the people -- they loved it!

Cheers, Nikos

Hi Paolo,

Yes, it will stop working, since the API in GRASS7 has changed (Raster
API functions have now "Rast_" as prefix). Besides of that must the
cmake files be modified to detect GRASS7.

> * some of the module options will be different
> * new modules will not be available in QGIS.

Yes, but this shouldn't be a problem if the module interface
description created by the GRASS modules itself was used to generate
the module interface in QGIS. New and modified modules will not work
if the interfaces are handcrafted.

That is IMHO not a good idea. I think to provide the full
functionality of GRASS7 to QGIS user, this plugin should be maintained
and updated to support the new GRASS7 API. Handling and processing of
massive datasets, especially time series, is only meaningful if GRASS
is used as data storage as well. The processing interface will add
massively overhead in data processing. The temporary location/mapset
creation approach is not well suited to process massive data, even
though r.external and v.external are used to link external data
temporary into GRASS.

Yes, that's the way to go.

My suggestion would be:

Full integration of the GRASS7 into QGIS via C++ or Python plugin.
This includes the temporal GIS capabilities as well.
The existing plugin is a very good start point, lots its functionality
can be reused, especially the vector editing, grass shell and map
management.

But there is a major problem with the GRASS QGIS plugin: it links
directly to the grass libraries and calls plenty of functions that can
QGIS cause to crash in case of an error. We face the same problem in
GRASS with the vector editing tools. My solution would be to use a RPC
(Remote Procedure Call) interface to calls GRASS library functions in
a remote process using binary data for inter-process communication.

IMHO the best tool for this is apache thrift[1] which allows us to
implement a RPC interface in GRASS7 to the needed library functions.
IMHO the number of RPC functions is limited since only vector editing,
raster map rendering and some map/stds management functions are needed
for direct access, all other functionality is provided by GRASS
modules.

So the first step is to implement an RPC interface in GRASS7, that
supports C/C++, Java, Python and JavaScript on the client side out of
the box. This interface can be used by the GRASS GUI itself to
implement exit safe vector editing and it can be used by QGIS and
other nice GIS desktop systems to provide GRASS database access, fast
raster rendering and vector edit functionality.

The beauty of this approach is, that the client side (the QGIS plugin
for example) do not need to link against GRASS libraries, since it
will communicate via pipes or sockets with one or several persistent
GRASS7 processes, which can be restarted in case of a fatal error. The
client side do not need to be updated in case the GRASS7 API changes
again, only the server side which will be implemented in GRASS7 must
be updated.

Implementation effort In case of the QGIS plugin:
All direct GRASS dependencies and function calls must be removed and
replaced by the client RPC solution. Hence the provider classes needs
to be rewritten, the C++ plugin code itself needs to be modified to
support the new interface datatypes that are used for inter-process
communication. Access to the temporal GIS functionality must be
implemented to list space time datasets.


What do you think about this approach?

Best regards
Soeren

The support for GRASS is already in the browser - if you enter a
directory that is a GRASS database, it will detect it and show
locations/mapsets/maps/layers.

That's great news, never tried. Works beautifully, thanks.
In the GRASS plugin there are a few more features, i.e.:
* showing history (important)
* copy/rename/delete.
If we can add these, I think the corresponding section of the plugin
would be rather useless.
Am I missing something?
All the best.

The browser does not support these operations, but it would be cool.

What about writing down the minumum set of requirements to be preserved?
Please add it to this thread, we can note it on a wiki page once bolied
down.

I have submitted the "Processing" for GRASS GIS 7 to Pirmin and Victor
for git upload.
Now the user has GRASS 6 and 7 both supported in Processing.

I updated all existing modules incl the newly included r.stream.*.

A few more new modules might be interesting to add. That's easy...

Hi,

Ok, I've finally figured it out.
Here it is for future reference, if anyone has this question again:

>>> renderer.setUsingSymbolLevels(True)
>>> symbols = renderer.symbols()
>>> symbols[0].symbolLayer(0).setRenderingPass(0)
>>> symbols[1].symbolLayer(0).setRenderingPass(1)
>>> symbols[2].symbolLayer(0).setRenderingPass(2)
...

Of course one should check how many layers each symbol has:
symbols[0].symbolLayerCount()

Cheers,
Jorge

It's been on my idea list for a while:
http://bigbluebutton.org/

Though sometimes it's just easier to do a ustream
OR for the super simple but still meeting style, Google Hangout.

If the EU devs can't make the US, the Pacific Northwest might be a good
location - since there is interest from Alaska. Lets see how the DC QGIS
user meeting coming up goes and play with the ideas some more.

Also, don't forget about the possibility for a few people to face to
face at FOSS4g in Portland this year (Code sprint room provided).

Thanks,
Alex

Hi,
I was wondering how to load a project file (.qgs) file and subsequently 
load the layers within it using python without the QGIS interface. I 
have tried to use QgsProject but can't fin any mention of reading the 
number/id of the layers within.

Thanks,

Hi Tim,

Just a quick note that the homebrew-osgeo repo (tap) is now under the OSGeo
user account [0]; switched over today. Since it was transferred on github,
the dakcarto/osgeo4mac tap should still work, since it is aliased by
github. If you run into issues, follow the new notes here [1], i.e. switch
taps. Sorry about the timing.

If you have the Kyngchaos stable QGIS packages installed, you may be better
off using the Homebrew python (and rebuilding), but only if you run into
significant Python issues, some of which many not show up until you run the
app. This is because the Kyngchaos GDAL.framework and others already have
*.pth files in your system site-packages.

This is the reason for the 'isolation' mode in the qgis-22 formula and the
use of the osgeo-osgeo4mac/enviro/python_startup.py script: to coexist, and
not interfere, with the Kyngchaos install. Isolation requires a separate
Python, for now, since initializing a virtualenv for QGIS.app on
double-click startup is not yet supported (at least I think it's not). In
isolation mode, no modules from /Library/* locations are loaded. So, you
will have to install all modules in Homebrew's site-packages, using
HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin/pip.

Be really nice to have a virtualenv creation and configuration GUI in the
main Options, as previously discussed.

Ok thanks. I have avoided putting William's packages on my system so that I
can do a 'pure' homebrew install. The qgis-22 step worked for me but I
needed to do a

brew update

before

brew install qgis-22 --only-dependencies --with-grass --with-globe
[--with-oracle]

In order for the above step to work, so you may want to add that to your
notes. I'm still working my way through the rest of your recipe.

Thanks!

Tim

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-wKek14cimUJbDgswxitFB2AMo3KrTAiUBQVvsbs9Nvg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

Just thought I would anyone know who has been following my Roam project
that I have started to work on making it run in Linux too, and then OS X
with help.

You can find the in progress code here:
https://github.com/NathanW2/Roam/tree/linux

I'm am not a Linux expert so any help or advice would been welcome.

Download the source and first run: ./linux_build.sh  You will need the PyQt
dev tools installed and it assumes QGIS is in /usr/

After the UI files are built you can run ./run_linux-config.sh to load the
config manger to create a project and forms.

Run ./run_linux.sh to launch Roam itself.

Here is a screenshot from me running it last night on Ubuntu
http://i.imgur.com/SrBPlai.png

Most things should work however there might be some stuff that still needs
updating, I'll fix them as we go.

Regards,
Nathan

Hi (plugin site) Devs,

I see there are two Github repo's which say they are for the plugin site:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Plugin-Repo

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django

Only the last one has recent commits.

Any idea if QGIS-Plugin-Repo was a temporarily repo and can be removed?

Message-ID: <CAN8Jn0BSBJkAUEjKYk5jneY-JWEXvErbSSWcYNbh+BwHRzx6tQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I was thinking how to improve situation with pyspatialite and spatialite 4
incompatibility. I have found that loading dynamic libspatialite module
instead pyspatialite is easier than I thought, at least in Ubuntu 12.04.

Here is working code example (python-pysqlite2 required):

from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
conn.enable_load_extension(True)
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT load_extension('libspatialite.so.5')")
cur.execute("SELECT ST_Length(ST_GeometryFromText('LINESTRING(30 10,
10 30, 40 40)'))")
print cur.fetchone()[0]
conn.close()


Has anybody tried to replace pyspatialite with python-pysqlite2 and dynamic
libspatialite loading ?

Hi all,

am I the only one that when loading a project (double clicking on the
project file) get the initial extent wrong? Then if I close the
project and load it again (without closing QGIS) it opens with the
right extent. The project has OTFR on, for what it can matter.

Cheers!

that is the plan now: building on the (much stronger/faster qgis2),
rsync to qgis server.

Well. prioritizing depends on your goals and knowledge. We differ in
both. Feel free to help and get me on par with you on knowledge about
sysadmin stuff. But please also try to help us if we maybe have other
(maybe less professional, or even wrong in your eyes) views. I try to be
pragmatic about the redmine problem: if somebody want to pull that:
fine. Otherwise: get rid of it (by using Github). As you say: it is a
problem too long already.

As most other functionality is now moved away (plugins site, building
nightlies and docs en website), we now have a better opportunity to
bring down/update qgis...

Regards,

Richard

Perceived faster, the drives are actually slower (OSGeo has 15k rpm SAS
drives in RAID6). RAM is non-ECC, CPU is probably faster (can't tell
what the new machine has but osgeo machine are actually 8 core).
Bandwidth from OSUOSL is likely Gigabit.

It's probably performance overhead from older ganeti, and limited cpu
allocation to a particular VM.

It may not actually be faster with the same load per allocated resource.

Just minor points to keep in mind when trying to figure out the balance.

Hi !

>> One unpleasant effect is: when zooming in, it first loads a preview,
then the image
>> disappears, then it shows at full resolution.

I have the same problem here on master, but it seems to affect vectors as
well as rasters.
It's more easy to spot (and more annoying) with layers taking a long time
to load/render, such as big rasters, complex vectors, or layers from a slow
distant server.

As far as I see, here what's happening upon user interaction (zoom or pan)

1) the previously displayed image is displayed offsetted/resampled
(instantaneous)
2) the image disappears for a short amount of time (probably during the
recalculation of the image)
3) the recomputed image is show.

The problem seems to be that the previous image is removed while rendering,
instead of being kept until the layer has been refreshed.

This can be also very annoying when working with a lot of layers.
Since layers are made invisible while rendering, they all reappear
progressively, one after the other, leading to a map canvas which seems
almost animated after finishing to interact with it.
Here's a video of the effect, displaying a lot of shapefile layers :
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ofa3pe5mqss3gm2/LayerRendering_01.avi
(sorry, it's quite abstract, but because of rights, I can't give a better
view of this data)

Do you confirm ? Did someone open a ticket related to this already ?
(didn't find one in the list)

Thanks !

Hello All,

I just released a new version of DronePlanner plugin for QGis  ,  that
solves some error during area path calculations.

For who do not know it, DronePlanner permits so simulate photogrammetric
flight paths  for  Drones.

Please, test it and approve it, if you like.

Hi ,
Some questions here since French users are really interested in that work,
and need some info before being able to fund some work :

- I saw Lutra Consulting calls for fundings on that item. Is the budget
fullfilled or are you still looking for funds? [
- We previously discussed of legend for size varying symbols and diagrams
[0]. Is that also included in that work? 
- Can some give us some conclusions of what what said in codesprint legend
workgroup on this? (sorry for not being able to come and contribute there)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] selection tool behavior
Message-ID: <CACfnYnR5xZQt=HNHD_ah=bgOJOLmeqmSue0gH3s++AW6Y2V90Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have been pointed that the selection tool ("select by rectangle")
unselects features already selected even when the ctrl is pressed.
This way a user can add a selection to the existing one, but only if
it carefully avoids the already selected features, and most of the
times is very hard to do.

What do you think?

That's usually where I break out the polygon select tool - which is quite handy for places where you need to be careful. 

The unselect already selected behaviour is true for all the selection tools - so at least it's consistent. 

Sometimes I get annoyed at accidentally unselecting stuff, but more often I'm glad that I have a way of unselecting blocks of features without having to start again.

Hello,

I find it also annoying, and not in the line of how other software do
(e.g., Inkscape). In Inkscape if you press Ctrl while rectangle select it
will always add features to the selection, If you click over an element
(still pressing Ctrl) it will toggle selection on and off for that
particular element.

An alternative could be:
- Using Ctrl would toggles selection on and off (the current behavior)
- Using Shift or Ctrl+Shift would add to selection;

(Or vice-versa)

Cheers,

Alexandre Neto

You haven't found min. requirements because QGIS can run on really old
hardware. I see it doing ok on netbooks (aside from occasional dialog
window size issues).

So short answer if it can run Win 7, Mac OS X, or Linux 2006+ then it's
probably fine for QGIS. In reality most Windows XP machines also work.
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Re-Is-Quantum-GIS-compatible-with-Windows-7-64-bit-td4133870.html


Of course if you want a machine that will run GIS well in everyday use
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/23300/specifications-for-gis-desktop-hardware

Quick summary for a GIS professional:
i5+, 4GB ram, discrete graphics not necessary with i5 HD4000+ but a 1 GB
card is nice or more ram if using the i5 built in, 100 GB - 1 TB free
space (GIS layers get big and you make lots of copies)

64 bit OS, pick your flavor.


Enjoy,
Alex

One upon a time there was a plugin for this
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/pgvs

No idea if it's actively maintained. Could use some love. It had quite a
complex system, probably worth reviving or using for ideas.

There are some Postgis ways too

The biggest problem of pgvs is that it is based on on replacing table by a
view, which than is "edited" by rules and triggers. I always through that
it could be done in better way for example using some copies of table in
user's schema which will be merged to master table when editing is
finished.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Postgis Caching - Enhancement
Message-ID: <533A45CA.3000502@wildintellect.com>

Searching tickets I don't see this one, but wanted to check that it
wasn't on the roadmap.

Often when working with Postgis layers, it's a read-only relationship
directly to a table or view that is not expected to change anytime soon.
To speed up panning/zooming etc we should implement and optional caching
mechanism (maybe this is a general feature for all vector providers?).

It's one of the only things I've seen OpenJump do that QGIS doesn't do
at all. See the Check box in the add table dialog - Cache Features
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jump-pilot/index.php?title=Working_with_Databases

Topic comes up often:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/q/46967/3183
There are plenty of previous conversations like this around.

If it's not anywhere in the plans I'll be happy to open a ticket.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alex,

we are using a PostGIS database here with several clients connected at 
any point in time (geoserver and QGIS users). I am always impressed how 
fast QGIS draws even layers with many features and complex rules. Even 
when working on my old laptop with a local postgreSQL instance (base 
configuration) it is impressively fast. So I would not say that the 
PostGIS provider _in general_ is slow (as [1] suggests). Looking at 
OpenJump: are there configurations where caching really improves speed? 
If I understood the explanations right only those features intersecting 
the viewport are cached, so any panning/zooming results in a database 
request, too.
Still speed improvements are always welcome, but if a layer is read-only 
for one user this does not neccessarily mean that it is read-only for 
others, too, so care must be taken when to activate caching. Although 
there are definitely layers for which changes cannot be expected during 
one QGIS session, so caching (in memory) might improve performance. 
Looking at other providers I know that shape files from network drives 
are sloooowww. So I would opt for a generic approach that works with any 
provider.

my 2 cts

Bernhard
