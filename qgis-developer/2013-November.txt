To that end, would it be possible to create an update that's more like a
patch of the sort that Windows, ArcGIS, most-games use, rather than (or
maybe on top of) an entirely new install? I realise this would be a lot of
work to initially set up (I don't think QGIS has this ability yet?), but
for end users, it would make keeping up to date much easier.

I have experimented with a couple of binary patch making tools, never could
get any of them to really work but that is a good idea if someone has the
skills.

Seems like a positive response all round, I'll get started...


Do you have a plan about how to make sure, that the fixes did not

My plans are to push any bug fix only (no new features) commits across, but
to exclude:
- Any processing related commits (since that's been updated via the plugin
mechanism)
- Any specific packaging related commits (I'm assuming all commits required
to build qgis 2.0 have already been push to the 2.0 branch, if not, i'll
leave that up to the packagers who know the situation better then me)

If a bug fix commit references an issue number I'll read up and check with
any attached datasets/etc to make sure there's no side effects. If in
doubt, I'll err on the side of caution and not port the commit. I'll also
put together a list of commits I'm unsure about and post here for further
input.

I'm not sure about translation related commits - does anyone have any
thoughts regarding this?

Hi!

I guess if you have committed the fixes to the release-2_0 branch they
will be taken anyway ..
I am going to commit some german updates as well in that release branch ..
(I think that's what the release branch is meant for)

regards
Werner

Hi, I`m working at the moment on an OsGeoLive virtual box.?

I`m using QGIS 1.8.0
I tryed to create a simple Symbol, but it failed to load the props, showing me on the mapCanvas just a symbol with a random color.
This would be the code:


self.gol2_categ_7 = QgsSymbolV2.defaultSymbol(self.gol.geometryType())
self.gol2_categ_7.createSimple({"color": "0,0,0,255", "color_border": "0,0,0,255", "offset": "0,0", "style": "diagonal_x","style_border": "solid","width_border":"0.26"})

Could you tell me please how to resolve the problem, so that the symbol loads the props?

Thanks!

However editing tools are similar from user point of view, the
implementation of data modification is different because of different
topology models. Non topological editing can be shared by more
providers because elemental editing operations have no consequences.
In topological editing, each simple edit changes also higher level
topology structures and that depends on topology model. It means that
topology editing has to be done mostly in providers.

We want however some common user interface. The question is, if it
makes sense to share more than the same icons? Each topological
provider could have a method returning a list of QAction which would
be inserted to editing toolbox by main application when editing is
started. All editing would be done by provider or better in some
separate class.

In topology editing it is important to visualize topology state of
elements (e.g. free line ends). In GRASS, when editing starts, the
symbology is switched to topology meaning. It would be nice to find a
clean solution how to display both topology state and features
symbolized by attributes. This scheme should also be shared by all
topological providers.

Topology models are usually using multiple geometry types (e.g. nodes,
edges). Multi geometry type layers may also be useful for non
topological layers. How difficult would it be to support multiple
geometry types in a single layer?

Hi all.
I think we hit a bug: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8995
It seems strange to me that nobody has found it before: am I missing something?
Is there a workaround?

Hi!

Within of qgis_core I need know if a QgsRenderContext comes from a print job (from composer) in order to disable one functionality.

I get that information from QPainter, QPaintDevice, QPaintEngine::Type ?


Thank your very much!

Hi

You cannot get that information from the painter itself (a print 
composition can be printed into QImage, pdf, QPrinter, etc...). The 
safest guess is probably to look at the QgsRenderContext. If the 
parameter 'scaleFactor' is very close to 1.0, it is most likely the 
rendering comes from a print composition.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Does spatial index improve performance using the
 class QgsGeometry.intersects()?
In-Reply-To: <1967754577.4147630.1383561904741.JavaMail.root@zstore.arpa.piemonte.it>

Hi list,

I don't know exactly how spatial index works, so I ask this question.
I have two layers and I want to check which features of the first layer intersect the features of the second one.
I write a simple script where I create the spatial index for both themes and I use the class QgsGeometry.intersects() to check the intersections.

I cannot understand why the executing time is the same even if I create or I don't create the spatial index for the layers.
Note: 
- The first layer (polilyne) has 20000 features, the second (polygon) has 600 features.
- To test the script insert the path of a check file
- To compare time executing you have to comments the two lines (21 and 22) in which I create the spatial index and cancel the file *.qix on the hard disk.

Thanks
Stefano Masera

separated. They are still correlated one-other (changes in one layer
may result in changes propagating to other layers), but they are
still seen as separate layers in the layer management, so that you
can set their visibility independently and/or style them differently.

I think it may be useful to have support for mixed geometry types
within a single layer but don't feel any urgent need for them to
edit topologies.

How do you like the separated layers approach ? Do you think it could
work for GRASS topologies ? I guess one limitation of it is that when
you enter "edit mode" you do so in a single layer, thus implicitly
(rather than explicitly) also editing correlated but
not-marked-as-being-edited layers. But this would already be the case
by opening the same datasource twice...

Hi, Marco, finally I added a flag in 'QgsRenderContext' class indicating that it works in a 'print composition' task.
The ScaleFactor is distinct of 1 when the composition engine must paint the map to one specific map scale.

At any rate, thank you very much!

      The safest guess is probably to look at the QgsRenderContext. If
      the parameter 'scaleFactor' is very close to 1.0, it is most
      likely the rendering comes from a print composition.

I think you are mixing up QgsRenderContext::scaleFactor() and 
QgsRenderContext::rendererScale().

Marco

Hi Marco, in "QgsMapRenderer::render" method there is....

...
? //calculate scale factor
? //use the specified dpi and not those from the paint device
? //because sometimes QPainter units are in a local coord sys (e.g. in case of QGraphicsScene)
? double sceneDpi = mScaleCalculator->dpi();
? double scaleFactor = 1.0;
? if ( mOutputUnits == QgsMapRenderer::Millimeters )
? {
? ? if ( forceWidthScale )
? ? {
? ? ? scaleFactor = *forceWidthScale; <------------------------ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
? ? }
? ? else
? ? {
? ? ? scaleFactor = sceneDpi / 25.4;
? ? }
? }
...
??if ( mRenderContext.scaleFactor() != scaleFactor )

? {
? ? mRenderContext.setScaleFactor( scaleFactor );
? ? mySameAsLastFlag = false;
? }
...

I have debugged the code and?I have verified.
:-)

Hi all,

I am wondering if you had any feedback regarding the call for funding
around the multi-threaded renderer.

>From the Swiss QGIS user group we decided to split this into 2013 and
2014. We can already pay CHF 3000 (approx. ?24xx - depening on the
exchange rate) in 2013 (approval pending on Nov 21). We would then pay a
similar amount then in early 2014.

Did you hear back from others who could contribute financially?

Can Martin already start with his work now? To me it would be important
to get this in QGIS 2.2

Best greetings,
Andreas

Hi all.
I suspect a few issues surfacing on QGIS are indeed upstream Qt bugs:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8980
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8974
Do you agree? Anyone has QGIS compiled against newer (5?) version of Qt, to see it it
behaves better?
They are minor issues, but may prevent serious usage in production.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi all,

I would like to see multi-threaded rendering in QGIS 2.2. Martin
Dobias could work on it. QGIS-CH could sponsor parts of it - but we
would need additional sponsors.

See these emails:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2013-October/029066.html

I don't know the status of it. The swiss QGIS user group obviously
could sponsor only parts of it. We would need additional sponsors.

Andreas

Hi,

Marco Hugentobler is working on DXF export and there are also label
speed improvements in the pipeline that did not make it into 2.0

Nyall is working on improving the print composer to behave better like
a DTP/graphic application, including better navigation in the print
composer view, selecting and manipulating multiple elements at once,
etc. Nyall also included a new symbology option for gradients.

Matthias included his work on database relations - which is already in
master for you to test.

Victor and Alex are continuously improving processing.

I am sure there is much more.

So there is already a lot of interesting work in the pipeline for QGIS 2.2

Andreas

As others have pointed out, there's already a substantial amount of new
features in qgis master. Beyond what was mentioned above, there's: world
file on qgis composer export, expression based {categorized, graduated}
symbology, notable improvements in the spatialite & postegresql drivers,
improvement to plugin manager etc.

That's on top of a number of bug fixes following public adoption of qgis
2.0, which Nyall was offering to look at and backport to 2.0 branch.

Question: is there already enough to justify a qgis 2.2 Christmas release?
The master branch is quite stable at the moment, wouldn't need as much of a
cool down period as 2.0 required.

Just a thought :)

Which just need some fixing but seem to be working fine.

It would be cool if we could do a Christmas release for 2.2 and then we can
look at things like multithreading for the next one.  I don't think trying
to rush in something like multithreading is a good idea as there is a bit
that can go wrong with that kind of thing.

Hi Paolo,

You can add the problem of dashed lines rendering. I don't think there 
is an issue entered but we were facing this while introducing the dashed 
line in digitization. It has been fixed in Qt5 [0].

[ 0] https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-24762

Cheers,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Troubles with features (QgsVectorLayer)
Message-ID: <1383637532998-5087389.post@n6.nabble.com>

Try this code. When i add feature to layer it says to me that id is negative
and not depend from layer (-2, -3, -4... for first and -6,-7,-8... for
second layer), but feature iterator says that ids are positive (1, 2, 3 ..
for first layer and 1, 2, 3 ... for second layer).

Is this a bug?
What i`m doing wrong?


        QgsVectorLayer *layer1 = new QgsVectorLayer("Polygon", "test1",
"memory");
	QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2 *renderer1 = new
QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2(QgsSymbolV2::defaultSymbol(layer1->geometryType()));
	layer1->setRendererV2(renderer1);
	map->addLayer(layer1);
	layer1->enableLabels(true);

	QgsVectorLayer *layer2 = new QgsVectorLayer("Polygon", "test2", "memory");
	QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2 *renderer2 = new
QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2(QgsSymbolV2::defaultSymbol(layer2->geometryType()));
	layer2->setRendererV2(renderer2);
	map->addLayer(layer2);


	layer1->startEditing();
	QgsFeatureIds ids1;
	for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
		QgsFeature f;
		f.setGeometry(QgsGeometry::fromRect(QgsRectangle(i * 10, i * 10, (i + 1) *
10, (i + 1) * 10)));
		f.setValid(true);

		layer1->addFeature(f);
		ids1 << f.id();
	}

Hi Hubbatov,

Negative ID's are temporary, while Features are in an un-committed 
state and get replaced by real ones generated by the Provider as soon 
as you call commitChanges().

Regards,
Matthias

Thanks for answer. But...

QgsFeatureIds ids1;
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
	layer1->startEditing();

	QgsFeature f;
	f.setGeometry(QgsGeometry::fromRect(QgsRectangle(i * 10, i * 10, (i + 1) *
10, (i + 1) * 10)));
	f.setValid(true);
	layer1->addFeature(f);
	layer1->commitChanges();

	ids1 << f.id();
}

Ids are stil negative. But if i get feature iterator after commit changes
and go to last feature - id is correct.
Like this

QgsFeature feat;
QgsFeatureIterator it = layer1->getFeatures();
while(it.nextFeature(feat)){
}
ids << feat.id();

But it is not comfortable...
Any other ways to get correct feature id after adding feature?

It would probably work to use
   layer->dataProvider()->addFeatures( QgsFeatureList )
instead. If you directly work on the data provider and not on the 
layer's edit buffer, no temporary id will be generated.

Release soon, release often.
We should take advantage of this consolidation period to release a good and 
stable 2.2 version for Christmas. That should give us time to consolidate a 
2.3 with important core change like multithreading.
There is enough new features and enhancements in master just now to justify a 
release.
If the multithreading branch is worked on before christmas, we could release a 
2.3 alpha not long after 2.2 and gather some testers to have it stable after a 
few RCs.

Hi,

It would be fine for me to have another release by Christmas/end of the 
year. In that case, of course the multi-threaded work should be done in 
2.3

However, we should not postpone the multi-threaded work further. It is 
core stuff and has a lot of implications. The longer we wait, the more 
complex, more work and thus more expensive it will be. With the new 
vector API Martin has laid the ground work for the multi-threaded 
rendere, we should not wait too long to do the remaining work.

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

There have been no donors coming forward from the general email I sent out to the lists but I am in the process of asking an organisation here in the UK directly but have been delayed in this task due to various people being on holiday.  

The funding arrangement you describe sounds great.  I will be contacting others that you mentioned directly this week to see if we can raise further funding.  

In the meantime, as far as I am aware, the work on the MT has already begun.  I will chat with Martin and see how the programme ties with the 2.2 release schedule.  


Kind regards,

Pete

Hi all,

I am wondering if you had any feedback regarding the call for funding around the multi-threaded renderer.

>From the Swiss QGIS user group we decided to split this into 2013 and 2014. We can already pay CHF 3000 (approx. ?24xx - depening on the exchange rate) in 2013 (approval pending on Nov 21). We would then pay a similar amount then in early 2014.

Did you hear back from others who could contribute financially?

Can Martin already start with his work now? To me it would be important to get this in QGIS 2.2

Best greetings,
Andreas

Hi Paolo,

My/The plan is to have a fixed release every four months.

So if we started with the last release the next release would be in january,
then may and september and so forth.

What I didn't expect was that the 2.0 release would take this long for me -
mostly not actual QGIS problems, but stuff in OSGeo4W.   So I'm still busy
catching up with my other duties and got behind with the release plan.

Anyway, the 4 months would be split into three months of development and one
month for testing, bugfixing, translating and release preparations in a freeze
period.

So if everyone knows beforehand when the next release will happen, new things
can be scheduled to be introduced into a certain release slot.  Things that
take more than one slot, should go into a seperate branch and merged when they
are ready.

So the release should just be determined just by time and be not be tied to
some desireable feature set/level of improvement or some other thing that might
or might not have happened at a given point in time and delay the next release
for an unknown amount of time.

Does jan/may/sep sound preferable?  feb/jun/oct or mar/jul/nov or apr/aug/dec
any better?  Any preference on the week or weekday such a release should happen
(eg. 3rd friday of the month)?

The idea also was to thereby reduce the need to stable releases and not to do
any. As I originally thought, we didn't have the manpower to maintain them.  As
we already established two times and I'm still doubtful that we're now.
So this doesn't cover stable releases at all.

Opinions?

Hi J?rgen

Sounds good to have a fixed release schedule instead of waiting for 
features ( that might eventually come ).
Things are more predictable with a fixed schedule. Additionally, with 
releases every four months, it's not too bad if a feature needs to wait 
until next release.

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

I agree with J?rgen and Marco, fixed release schedule is better than
waiting for features. Also having month for testing should be enough
for finding most major bugs/regressions, so releases will be more
stable and robust.

+1 from me for this kind of release schedule.  Knowing that there is a
release coming in X months puts users minds at ease and lets devs focus on
what they can do and when, and not rushing things last minute.

Waiting for features is just asking for the "we will just wait for this,
and that, and this, and maybe this"

I think we are in a good place now to be making faster releases.

Great to have a fixed time release plan ! Definite +1 for that !

Do you think that it will need a "commitfest" period, when ready features 
would be merged into trunk before the one-month testing ? (That's how the 
linux kernel or PostgreSQL work).

Or would it be the responsibility of the commiters to only accept PR whenever 
the proposed feature is complete, tested and documented during the 3 months ?

The situation we do not want is a wrong evaluation of development time for a 
feature, which would as a consequence be only partly commited to trunk when 
the three months period of development ends.

Ok, then the question is, do we merge regularly, or at a fixed time in the 
development cycle.

Better not have a release in august because of summer holidays.
feb/jun/oct would be my favorite.

I'm new to QGIS and am incredibly impressed. I like seeing all the
discussion of new releases and improvements. I see that Nyall is working
on improving the print composer. As a guy who basically makes maps for a
living, this is huge. Since so much of our final products in GIS are
maps, having software that allows more functionality for quality map
design is extremely important. It can be the single reason people chose
one software package over another. For many years ESRI's ArcMap has had
a leg up on open source GIS software because it has such a nice
print/map "composer" (the Layout in ArcMap) but I believe this can
change from what I see happening in QGIS. Multiple insets/data frames
would be very nice. Also, I was surprised at how few preloaded line and
polygon symbols there are. Just a handful. No railroad symbol? Would be
really, really, good to have more of these available. Map designers love
this kind of stuff.

 

Thanks so much,

David

Hi,

We in Tuscany Region are study-ing a set of qml and svg symbol to full draw
a Cartography Technical Chart with QGIS.
When finished we plan to release all with a cc-by license.

Hi David,

We deliberately held back on the publication of too many map symbols - 
for now.

There was a Gsoc (Google summer of code project) by Arunmozhi this year 
that worked on a central symbol repository (django webapp) and a QGIS 
integration which will help people to exchange styles and SVG symbols. 
See http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Google_Summer_of_Code_2013

Too many (SVG) symbols pre-installed slow down QGIS considerably. So I'd 
rather prefer having fewer symbols pre-installed. If there was a way to 
browse symbols online easily and then just pull the symbols that one 
actually needs that would be wonderful.

I don't know the current status of the GsoC project. It seems to have 
done fairly well but I do not see that integrated in qgis master 
currently. Anyone knows? Is the django based website publically 
available?

I see that there is an "import from URL" method in the GUI of the style 
manager - but wich URL? Is there already a central repository?

Not that I know of. I agree, it is important to bring this into production.

Merci Denis,
AFAICT, the bug you mention is on Qt5 only, a regression from 4.8: is this right?
Anyone knows what is the state of the other issues I mentioned?
All the best.

For the topology editing, I was thinking of considering the topology as a
 special group (or the vector layers as sublayers of a topology layer):
* When adding a topology, all the vector layers (node, edge, face, etc.) would be added at once
* Each vector layer would appear independently in the layer tree, but be a part of the topology group
*
 It would be impossible to turn editing on a single layer, editing state
 would be controlled at the topology group level, so if one layer is 
edited, all layers are. This would be explicitly shown.

This allows to not touch anything for the
 visualization part, all the symbology can be applied on a single vector
 layer as usual. Only the editing features would have to be modified to 
deal with the topological modifications of the other layers and keep 
everything consistent. Of course, the definition of consistent will 
depend on the kind of topology considered.

I never used GRASS 
topology, I still have to learn about it, but I think this 
representation would be flexible enough to adapt to different 
situations. It would also be possible to build "ad-hoc" topologies with 
simple normal vector layers (shapefiles, etc.) and have editing 
operations follow basic topology rules including several layers, which 
is something I would like to see (I work with networks and casual users 
who can open shapefiles, but not install PostGreSQL). This kind of 
topology would be like an extension of the existing pseudo-topology 
editing, just extended to several layers.

Topological editing (i.e. following topological rules) is completely
different from editing topological data structures. The two concepts are so
different that I can hardly think of a common base...

Message-ID: <1383671937520-5087509.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
I am opening a dataset made with LINESTRINGM (using postgis linear
referencing). 
2DM geometries simply do not display in master, where they do well in 2.0.
Anyone confirms? 
This is a potential blocker and we should have units tests for this. 

Cheers 
R?gis

Hey Andreas,

I am reviewing that code right now.  I will merge the QGIS side of things
into master first then get someone to merge the django bit.

Hi Paolo,

No, it also occurs in 4.8 and it's why we had troubles to have a dashed 
line for the last segment in digitization.
It was solved in Qt 5.0.2 but not for Qt 4.8.

ok, thanks. do you believe this has also fixed the other two bugs?
in case, I suppose moving qgis to qt5 would be a major task, right?
qt5 at least on Debian comes only with Python3, so it seems quite bloody.
all the best.

I would say yes for #8980, but no idea for #8974.

I would let more aware people answer about Qt5.
But if we have to change to Python 3, I think it would be considered as 
an API break as older plugins might not work anymore....
So, sadly, I suspect we won't see this happening very soon, willwe?
Or maybe, if this time we take care of porting every plugins with 2to3?

I'd like to hear (read) these aware people ;)

Cheers,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] doc dir in github
Message-ID: <5279EC9E.9040804@duif.net>

Hi devs,

while searching for the template for the doxygen templates for
qgis.org/api I stumbled upon the doc directory in Github:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/doc

Can someone tell us what this is?

Apparently the INSTALL text in the root of the QGIS project is generated
from that, but I think that is not clear to everybody (as for example
Mathias is editing that file directly:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/8d0d7df22b6d586bec63b386060de82aaab16cd4#diff-6a755e7d228a2b491321dbae0a7a248b

while I think his edit will be overwritten next build of this file,
because I do not see his edit in:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/linux.t2t

which apparently is the source for INSTALL

Can we please:
- add a tiny README in the doc dir to tell what it generates (not the
docs :-) )? apparently INSTALL, but I see more scripts and docs??
- or remove stuff which is not needed/used anymore?
- add a line in top of INSTALL that it is a generated txt so should not
be edited directly?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Does spatial index improve performance using
 the class QgsGeometry.intersects()?
In-Reply-To: <CAJ41gF607ctAeg88soBdnqJB9mxEHuiFA3wtms0Ui8qrYLa2DQ@mail.gmail.com>

Thank you very much. 
It's a good explanation. 
Only another think. 


Which is the difference to create a spatial index in this way: 


feat_all = layer.dataProvider().getFeatures() 

layer_spIndex = QgsSpatialIndex() 

for feat in feat_all: 
layer_spIndex .insertFeature(feat ) 


Or in this way: 


layer.dataProvider().createSpatialIndex() 


It seems to work only in the first case. 


Thanks 


Stefano

Hi list, 

I don't know exactly how spatial index works, so I ask this question. 
I have two layers and I want to check which features of the first layer intersect the features of the second one. 
I write a simple script where I create the spatial index for both themes and I use the class QgsGeometry.intersects() to check the intersections. 

I cannot understand why the executing time is the same even if I create or I don't create the spatial index for the layers. 
Note: 
- The first layer (polilyne) has 20000 features, the second (polygon) has 600 features. 
- To test the script insert the path of a check file 
- To compare time executing you have to comments the two lines (21 and 22) in which I create the spatial index and cancel the file *.qix on the hard disk. 

Thanks

Yes, moving to qt5 and python3 would break the existing plugins -
something we should leave for QGIS 3.0.

Anyway I believe the above mentioned issues are not Qt bugs:
- #8980 - it would help to have just one repetition of the input
pattern in the SVG to avoid the unwanted effect
- #8974 - something wrong with preparation of the image for the
pattern (there are various artifacts also when changing the angle)

Basically you are suggesting the same as Sandro, right?

Terminology suggestion:
  * element layer - layer representing topological elements, e.g. nodes or edges
  * compound layer - higher level layer of compounds from elements,
e.g. polygons formed by edges
Users usually work with compound layers, element layers are only used
for editing or debugging.

Element layers would be added automatically when user starts editing
of compound layer or user has to explicitly add element layers group
before editing?

Element layers will be displayed with topological meaning symbology
above compound layers? I.e. for example polygons symbolized according
to attributes + edges symbolized according to topology state?

How would be implemented the consistency? Currently each layer
instantiates single provider and providers do not know anything about
each other. The changes have to be propagated to other layers via
provider because of different topology models. It means, that
topological providers have to keep opened data sources in static
members, and editing has to be done on those static members. After
each edit operation all providers/layers using the same data source
has to be informed about the change. How? Signals on provider level,
between providers sharing the same data source?

Hello All,


pyQGis 2  changed many things  :(

For example:  how is possible, now, to set the transparency of a raster ?

Before, simply was:

l_raster.setTransparency(50)


And now ?

Thank you for any info about it

Hi folks,

Couple of thoughts on the website:

1) - There doesn't seem to be a link to the weeklies, or at least not one I
can find on http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html

2) That same page has a link under "QGIS testing" which 404's -
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Application:/Geo/VERSION/ -
looking closer that link is on the page three times.

for openSUSE packages "VERSION" means you add the opensuse version you work
with instead, e.g.:
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Application:/Geo/openSUSE_12.3/

I will better describe it, so people know what to do...

Hello,

now i try my luck here hoping not being ignored :-)

I want to write a plugin for QGIS 2.0 Dufour in C++. Do I have to take the 
sources/API from Version 1.8 (Lisboa)? It is right, that the actual API 
only can be used for the actual Releases(Weekly Master)? In this case I 
have to download the actual sources and recompile it everytime I want to 
deploy it?

Thanks for any suggestions.

hi all
(sorry for my bad english),

Giuseppe P. and I have posted a new experimental plugin topog4qgis;
it is a proof of concept intended to manage the surveys and to correlate

Hi Susann,

As long as there is no API break, your C++ code should work across 
versions.

There was an API break shortly between 1.9 and 2.0.

If you target QGIS 2.0 or higher you do not have to deal with QGIS < 
2.0.

You can get the sourcecode directly from github at 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/

See http://www.qgis.org/de/site/getinvolved/index.html for additional 
information how to get started.

Compilation has to be done for each platform and major version 
separately, as you have to link to the QGIS core libraries. If your 
plugin is just for inhouse you just need to target the versions and 
platforms you deal with. If it is for general usage and of general 
interests and good quality, it would be better to include your code in 
trunk with pull requests, so that packagers can bundle it with the 
installers.

Good luck,
Andreas

Hi Susann,

Any reason to not write your plugin in python? It is much easier (to
start with).

But if you want to write a C++ for QGIS 2.0, you will have to program
against the 2.0 api:
http://qgis.org/api/2.0/

Myself I have no experience with writing cpp plugins, and I do not think
there is very much documentation about it..
I found this link:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Writing_C++_Plugins_%5BNew%5D
I tried the plugin_builder.py script which is mentioned there, and all
was working/building fine (also a nice README). Only the links in the
created dialog are not ok anymore:

In particular look at the following classes:

QGisInterface
http://svn.qgis.org/api_doc/html/classQgisInterface.htm
QgsMapCanvas
http://svn.qgis.org/api_doc/html/classQgsMapCanvas.html
QgsMapTool
http://svn.qgis.org/api_doc/html/classQgsMapTool.html
QgsPlugin
http://svn.qgis.org/api_doc/html/classQgisPlugin.html

instead of
http://svn.qgis.org/api_doc/html
use
http://qgis.org/api/2.0/

Good luck and have fun (again... why not python?)

Where did you feel ignored anyway?

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <7447393869595D4EBC20745A4F48BA1F0D599EF9@RTPWEXC18.RCC_NT.RTI.ORG>

Folks,

 

It looks like there is an error in the QGIS 2.0.1 stand-alone installer.
I have this installed and my browser does not recognize .xls files and I
get a data type error when trying to add using Add Vector Layer - All
files that states: not a valid or recognized data source.

 

However, from what several people have indicated to me, QGIS installed
with the OSGeo4W installer, there is no problem adding .xls tables to
QGIS and the software performs just as expected like Anita Graser
describes on page 50 of her Learning QGIS 2.0 book.

 

Can the stand-alone installer be fixed so that it has the same
functionality as the OSGeo4W installer? A wise QGIS expert told me they
should have the same functionality.

 

Thanks so much,

David

Terminology accepted, adding aliases:

 * compound layer AKA features layer

Note that this is the model used by the "TopoViewer" included with 
the DBManager plugin. It creates a group and adds different vector layers
for the primitives. I suggest you both take a look at it if not done yet,
just to have a common reference.

I guess this depends on the kind of editing we want to allow.

One level of editing is, imho, simply selecting which elements/primitives
takes part in the definition of the compound. This is an high-precision
editing level where it is ensured that no changes will occur in the
elements. For this kind of editing I envision a system that would
automatically add on the map one or more layers containing candidate
elements (one layer per element-type) to let user pick the one he wants.

Another level is modifying the elements that compose a compound.
I still don't know what would work for this second level, when coming
from "editing of a compound layer", but it does sound like a short-cut
to open editing of the element layer. 

Yet another possibility is allowing arbitrary modification of the
shape of a compound and automatically add elements in the topology
to account for those changes. This is what I've implemented in QGIS
for editing of TopoGeometry (aka "compound") layers.

We should have good defaults, but still possibly also allow users to set
"template styles" for their element layers.
I think it makese sense to allow for symbolization of states, generally.
The states could be seen as dynamic attributes of the element tables.

We could eventually require a minimum set of attributes for these kind of
tables to unify symbology for them. Could you write down a list of the
states, to add to the terminology ?

I don't think we want to provide cross-provider topologies, do we ?
In that case each provider should take care of the required book-keeping
to maintain the link between layers related to the same topology.

Dear list,

I am trying to use r.profile within QGS 2.0 ( Windows 7, 64 bit), both
using an existing python GRASS script via the new processing command
line (writing the standard txt description) or from the older Grass
plugin shell

when running

C:\PROGRA~1\bin>r.profile.exe (script)
or
C:\PROGRA~1\QGISDU~1\apps\grass\grass-6.4.3\etc\gui\scripts>r.profile.exe (cli)

r.profile doesn't start  / crashes without any message

If started from GRASS GUI (always from QGIS 2.0 package), r.profile
doesn't give any problem

Any hint?

many thanks

Why not python? In the last year our company began developing an extension 
for ArcGIS 10 in .Net C#. Our intention is a similar working plugin in 
QGis. For me it was first easier to port the Code to C++. Indeed i'm not a 
save C++-Programmer but from python i don't understand anything. And so 
the decision comes to C++.
The start over a year ago was not so easy but for Lisboa i could get a 
small testplugin get running. Then i've made an error and get new sources 
from github and my plugin only runs with the weekly masters. So 
sporadically when I added some features to my plugin i get the new sources 
from github and the adequate weekly build to test my plugin. So all seems 
well,  I thought I wait for the new Version (2.0 Dufour) and then we could 
have a nice beta-version of our plugin. But now i can't get running the 
plugin in 2.0, only in 2.1 its working. I get no error in 2.0, it isn't 
shown in the pluginlist, not even in red. So i don't know the reason. I 
assumed it was the api break between 1.9 and 2.0. 
Maybe i don't have the right proceeding. But how can I get the sources of 
2.0 to compile my project in VS 2010, from github i get only the actual. 
Is this the fault? I don't know.

Hi,

Whenever there is a new release you have to link to other qgis core 
libraries (e.g. libqgis_core.so). This explains why 2.1 C++ plugins do 
not work for 2.0 even if the API did not change. You have to compile C++ 
plugins for each major version.

You can get the source code for the 2.0x branch at 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/release-2_0

see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/branches for all the available 
branches.

Message-ID: <CAFF9ZhtM_oYu6pwBzanO5i+VPKkRqY+gjOLwFVh355=x7Ug+Dw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I created  a new plugin for QGis 1.8 and 2.0.1, named "Rasparenza" , that
changes the transparency of all raster layers.

Please, test it and, if you like,  approvate it.


Regards

Hey Roberto,

Are you able to add some more information on your plugin to the plugin
page.  As a user the name doesn't tell me anything.  You should also add
some meaningful tags, something like raster, transparency, etc

Hi Nathan,


I inserted these description and tags to
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/rasparenza/


"rasparenza : change all raster layer transparency

*Author:* geodrinx <http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/author/geodrinx/>

*Author's email:* geodrinx at gmail.com

*Maintainer:* geodrinx <http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/user/geodrinx/admin>

*Tags:* raster <http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/tags/raster/>,
transparency<http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/tags/transparency/>

"

is it enough?   :)

Re: [Qgis-developer] WG: Re:  cpp-plugin for QGIS 2.0






Hi,

Whenever there is a new release you have to link to other qgis core 
libraries (e.g. libqgis_core.so). This explains why 2.1 C++ plugins do 
not work for 2.0 even if the API did not change. You have to compile C++ 
plugins for each major version.

You can get the source code for the 2.0x branch at 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/release-2_0

see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/branches for all the available 
branches.

Hello,

There is just one git URL for all the branches: 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git

but you can change to a different branch using the -b command switch 
(e.g: git checkout -b threading-globe origin/threading-globe).

You can use this page to get more info on git:

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/Using_Git

or you can Google for it.

What the hell ? :-)
It is so nice, There are opening doorways...
I got the sources for the release 2.0.1 - however :-) and cmake builds me 
a qgis2.0.1.sln for my VisualStudio. Now compiling my QGis is in progress. 
Thank you for guiding me a few steps forward! I'm curious about it if it 
is running after this, i will tell you...

Hello,

There is just one git URL for all the branches: 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git

but you can change to a different branch using the -b command switch 
(e.g: git checkout -b threading-globe origin/threading-globe).

You can use this page to get more info on git:

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/Using_Git

or you can Google for it.

You could also use the libraries shipped with OSGeo4W (also in the standalone
installer).   Note that the 32bit version is built with VS2008 and 64bit with
VS2010.

Message-ID: <CAFkzVYQHKUfx4HnBKEvjG2Q8SDquhsZqdO4e-k-51i_eUmss=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm using QGIS 2.0.1-Dufour from the repository ubuntugis-unstable.

I have a plugin that is used to translate a vector layer with a shift
"delta_x" and "delta_y".
To do this I use the function translateFeature() as you can see from the
code below:

vlayer = iface.activeLayer()

feature = QgsFeature()

for feature in vlayer.getFeatures():
    vlayer.translateFeature(feature.id(), delta_x, delta_y)



For every translated feature, the following message is displayed on the
screen:

undo index changed 1
undo index changed 2
undo index changed 3
...


and the plugin execution seems very slow compared to same run under version
QGIS 1.6.0-Copiap?.
Looking at the source code it seems that the message is sent through
Qdebug().
This means that the QGIS was compiled with debug system activated?
How do I get a non-debug version?

Thanks

Message-ID: <CAGyPVTvMWgXc6wFSisrVL1+wK_tTYXx+fD1Q_xW30N_H+-airg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

We have an important QGis digitizing issue that is blocking and generating
a lot of work for us.

The issue has been described in more then 3 bugs (
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8174, http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4880, and
others) and it really hurts QGis image as a software.

This is something that cannot happen. In our current setup we have 10 GIS
Analysts working on a large area, doing land use maps. This problem is
killing us!

I'm cross posting in GEOS dev list to see if there is interest in fixing
this bug, one way or the other and our company is willing to fund part (or
depending how much, all the costs) of the development of this fix.

Please, let me know.

Thanks!

IMHO you need very strong arguments not to do this job as a Python
plugin. All the external C++ plugins I have seen have died out sooner
or later for the problems in keeping API and ABI compatibility.
All the best.

Hi,

thanks for raising this issue. I have tried to do so weeks ago and
didn't get much feedback even if this bug is a real show stopper for
certain use cases (that after all are pretty common).

cheers!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Select datum transform in QGIS
Message-ID: <527BB437.1080304@sourcepole.ch>

Dear qgis devs

In QGIS, there is currently no possibility to choose the type of datum 
transform used in otf-reprojecting. Additionally, some national mapping 
agencies provide datum shift grids and they cannot be used conveniently 
in QGIS ( a user needs to make user defined crs and store the +nadgrids= 
parameter there).
Some proprietary systems pop up a dialog box in case there are several 
datum transformations available and let the user choose an appropriate 
one. Therefore, I've been in charge of implementing a similar solution 
for QGIS, and the code is ready for first testing / feedback now:

https://github.com/mhugent/Quantum-GIS/commits/datum_transform

Here a short summary of the changes:

- There is a new table in srs.db created from the gdal file 
'datum_shift.csv'. It contains 3/7 parameter towgs84 parameters. 
Additionally, there is also the possibility to extend srs.db with ntv2 
(grid shift) transformations (with the .gbs filename as first parameter).
- Once otf-reprojection is enabled and QGIS detects more than one 
possible datum transformation between the two CRS, the user is asked in 
a dialog which one to use. This is stored into the project file, so only 
needs to be entered if adding the layer or changing the layer / map CRS. 
The user is also asked if saving a layer in a different CRS and the 
datum transform is of course also picked up by QGIS server.

possible problems from user perspective:

- The dialogs asking for datum transform could be annoying. Does it need 
an option to suppress it (and should it be enabled / disabled by default)?
- The synchronisation of srs.db with datum_shift.csv makes the install 
time longer (maybe it can be solved more efficiently?)

technical details for devs:

- QgsCoordinateTransform currently contains srcCRS, destCRS. It is 
extended to hold optionally source datum transform / dest datum 
transform (int is coord_op_code in srs.db). In 
QgsCoordinateTransform::initialise, the datum transform strings are 
modified to match the choosen datum transforms.
- QgsCRSCache is extended to search by datum transform too (to avoid 
expensive lookups in the sqlite db every time)
- QgsMapRenderer stores the information about layer / datum 
transformation and reads / writes to project filename
- To receive the current QgsCoordinateTransformation for a layer, tools 
may query QgsMapRenderer::tr (or QgsMapRenderer::mapToLayerCoordinates 
etc.). Creating a new QgsCoordinateTransform from layerCRS and mapCRS is 
not correct in all cases any more.


What are your opinions / suggestions?

Regards,
Marco

I'll do once I find time. Please look on GRASS editing.

This can be a higher level editing, but elements editing is necessary.

It depends on model, for GRASS:
- point
- line
- boundary (no area)
- boundary (1 area)
- boundary (2 areas)
- centroid (in area)
- centroid (outside area)
- centroid (duplicate in area)
- node (1 line/point)
-node (2 and more lines/points)

How do you say to compound layer that element changed? Also in GRASS,
all elements are stored in single file, so element layer providers
have to work with the same datasource.

Can you explain better what you mean?

my 2cts from a user's perspective:

- annoying dialog:
How about an option "Store my choice and do not ask me again"
This choice will go in a user setting where all choices for all datum 
shifts (encountered by this user) are user-accessible and can be deleted 
or changed.
This probably extends the whole thing a lot but as a user I might always 
want to use the same paramter set and therefore need an option to save 
my choice.
the dialog should be enabled by default to make users aware of what they 
are doing

Or the OTFR dialog could already produce a list of available transforms for
each CRS used in layers - maybe with the last used transform for each
combination preselected.

Is that really significant?  I suppose using the same connection as syncDb()
would help (just because it does it's thing in a transaction).

Who's bad idea was it to call that thing tr()? ;)   transformation() is
probably better for a public method.

Why is it in a separate branch?

Hi

I have seen another "bug" or misbehaviour IMHO : I would expect QGIS to
automatically create a node at the intersection of 2 linestring when
topology editing is ON, with no need to do it manually. This would help a
lot too.

Regards
Michael

Areas (faces) are generated automatically in PostGIS too, but those
are not considered "compounds". Rather they are considered "primitive"
(elements) at the same level of nodes and edges.

It is true that faces are defined by edges, but they are not intended
to be attached user attributes. The rationale is that you must be able
to cut any face by adding more edges w/out the user-feature changing
its shape (the same as you can cut any edge by adding more nodes w/out
the linear user-feature changing its shape).

I understand that in GRASS you attach attributes to faces (areas) instead.
Maybe GRASS could just not support this level of editing.

Are those "topology states" ? I'm not sure I understand them.

Can "point" and "node*" be states of a "node" layer ?
Can "line" and "boundary" be states of an "edge" layer ?
Can "centroid*" be states of a "face"/"area" layer ?

What I mean is that signalling of changes to related layers should
not necessarely be provided by the generic API, but could be handled
internally by each provider. As a provider of a topological layer
you (the provider) must know how to dispatch information about changes
happening. Supposedly all "related" layers will be provided by you
(the provider) so you should have all it takes to take note about
how many layers you created that are related to a given topology,
and dispatch accordingly.

+1

GEOS-3.4.0 introduced a GEOSNode interface that could be handy for that.

Explicit noding would also probably help fixing other issues,
which I suspect are due to the conceptually wrong assumption
that you can snap a point to a line:

Hi,

I am bit late but here are my two cents.

I was researching ways how to compile applications with QGIS. I did not 
get very far
in terms of developing my application, but I think I solved some 
compiling / linking
problems.

Here is a  small manual

1. All what you need is Os4geoW with development files and VS 2010 Express.
      Make sure you install appropriate headers / libs from os4geow web 
site.

2. Create your CPP fle. Example is attached.

3. Fire Os3GeoW command window (I used windows  cmd, not MSYS) and navigate
   to you folder. Type

qmake -project

This will create .pro file fore you.

4. Now you need to adjust it.  Edit with your favorite editor.

What you need to change:

QT += xml

INCLUDEPATH += . C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/include
DEFINES += CORE_EXPORT= GUI_EXPORT=

LIBS += C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/lib/qgis_analysis.lib 
C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/lib/qgis_core.lib \
              C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/lib/qgis_gui.lib \
              C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/lib/qgis_networkanalysis.lib

I attached my "pro" file. You can adjust as you need. Better if you use 
relative paths.


5. Now again use qmake but this time to create VS  project

qmake -tp vc qgis1_clone.pro


6. Switch to VS 2010 Express. Start it and load "qgis1_clone.vcproj"
VS will show conversion wizard, just go through.  Now you can compile 
"release" for your application.
So far I got only "release" working but  by adjusting libraries it 
should be possible to get
"debug" as well.


7. You need to change some project setting in VS, apparently qmake did 
not make them
Here is for release version

- change executable for debug:   release\qgis1_clone.exe
- change debug environment: add PATH=C:\OSGeo4W\bin;C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis\bin
    or whatever our path is

Now you can start application within VS (Crtl+F5)

I did not get debug working. I am getting

"The application has failed to start because its side-by-side 
configuration is in
    correct. Please see the application event log for more detail."

   It's something wrong with VS redistributable. Perhaps someone could 
shed a light
on this.


I hope it helps,

Best Regards
Mikhail

QGis does the explicit noding of the first adjancent feature, but the
results are inconsistent.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. I've tried many things to see if I
could find a reproducible series of steps, but without success.

Right now we are comparing the results ArcGIS is giving us against QGIS
topology checker. It looks like QGIS topology checker is finding a lot more
errors (I think QGIS is correct), but the main difference is visualization
of the errors (which is another deal).

Any ideas?

I confirm. In one of the tickets I attached a screencast that shows
that is seems pretty random

I also would like to stress that this is a really serious issue. In
QGIS we don't have (yet) tools to define the topology rules *before*
starting digitizing as other software does (see the other thread on
this matter). If the "avoid intersection" rule fails, we loose the
basically the only weapon we have and vectors need to be cleaned with
the "usual" tools (GRASS, postgis).

Hi Devs,

while adding a minor pull request, I saw that we have 30 open pull requests.

While not able to judge them, some of them look like feasable to pull.

Maybe I'm wrong, and they are all nasty ones, but then (as a community)
I think we should at least add a comment to them, telling the requester
that/why it is hard to handle his pull request.


My favourite one

add non-earth coordinate reference systems in to QGIS:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/982

I'm not sure if adding those will be in the way for us earthlings, nor
am I aware how this list of sql-inserts should be incorporated into our
srs.db proces.

But I think it is just cool to know that QGIS could be used in one of
the next Mars-journeys ;-)

Regards,

Richard

Hi George,
it's not clear to me from the QGIS tickets that there is a problem in GEOS.
Can you come up with a clear description of what you think is a GEOS bug ?

Following the words of Richard ..

Maybe we could just meet on IRC one evening a month and discuss the
open pull requests and probably merge them if possible ..

Like every second thursday in a month or so?

Would that be possible?

Hi Paolo, 

yes, our company has to come to a strategic decision in the next time. And 
I'm not sure what to suggest. I don't know python but i think i need much 
time to port ca. 3000 lines existing code, otherwise in future it should 
grow up much more. Besides I'm spoiled of the IDE of VS, i need to look 
what pythondeveloper use for it. And do pythondeveloper not depend on sth, 
like PyQt? QGIS and Qt are programmed in C++, so there wait perhaps no bad 
surprises?... difficult

IMHO you need very strong arguments not to do this job as a Python
plugin. All the external C++ plugins I have seen have died out sooner
or later for the problems in keeping API and ABI compatibility.
All the best.

Hello Sandro.

I dont think this is a GEOS bug. I was following the various discussions on
this bug/unexpected behavior.

On one of them, in discussion with Marco, you said that it might be a
problem with GEOSDifference. And after that theres our chat in IRC, which
seems to fit the problem.

We can easily test this inserting the geometries directly in Postgis, I
mean, the result of an ST_Difference.

Im not sure where the bug resides, but I would like to come up with
alternatives, or at least a very clear method of constructing these
polygons in Qgis that will not result in errors.

It seems to me that if the new polygon only intersects another one, works,
but that is not always the case when doing land use maps.

The plain simple test that Qgis MUST pass is that polygons created with
avoid intersections options, should have NO topological errors.

Im just travelling right now, but we'll come up with test cases.

Anyone on Qgis community has any ideas?

Thanks everyone

Compared to C++, Python is pretty easy to pick up.  There are some really
good Python videos and after you watch a few of them (or even just one) I
would say you would feel comfortable in it.  Because the PyQt and Qt C++
APIs are almost the same in terms of porting the code it almost comes right
over; plus or minus a few little tweaks.

I would even say that you would reduce your 3000 line count because Python
is a lot less verbose then C++ and allows for some pretty handy styles that
reduce the needed code.

I use PyCharm as my Python IDE which I have so far found to be the best.
 It supports PyQt API auto completion.

What's known about GEOS is that constructive operations (like ST_Difference)
can return geometries which don't necessarely match anymore with the inputs.

This is due to:

 - Introduction of intersection points, slightly changing slope of the
   2 new segments created from the slope of the original segment.

 - Vertex coordinates shift, due to heuristic attempts at working around
   robustness errors thrown while using floating point precision.

As I just commented on the second ticket you reported, I think QGIS is
making wrong assumptions about the results from overlay operations in GEOS.

My suggested solution is polygonizing the linework resulting from the
editing (after noding).
The result from polygonizer is always topologically correct (assuming
input is correctly noded).

Richard, Werner: this is a long standing problem. We have tried to deal with it, with
limited success. We do not want to spoil our code contributors, but on the other hand
code has to be checked before accepting it, this takes time, and not many people are
able to do it.
Certainly writing to contributors would aready be something good, but ultimately we
need someone who has bot the time and the skill to do this job.
All the best.

	default anymore?
Message-ID: <CAFcNcQZYFBVSDwmv=hk=k_zOq8L37eDw6XhSM0Ym0izsM-Nj+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

I don't know it this is related to the recent processing upgrade, but I
cannot get plugins that add themselves as processing providers to get their
geoalgorithms loaded by default when I start QGIS.

This is hapenning with a custom plugin that I am writing, but I have
noticed it happening also with the LecoS plugin, which has already been
published.

What I mean is that even though plugins are loaded by QGIS and are
supposedly activated in Processing settings, they are not loaded when I
first start QGIS. To make them appear in the Processing Toolbox I always
have to visit the 'Options and Configuration' dialog and press the OK
button in the dialog (I don't have to make any changes, just press OK)

Does anyone confirm this behaviour? I'll open a ticket for it if it is
really general.

Best regards

Hi Paolo!

Thats exactly why I suggested a monthly IRC meeting with the developes
that have time ..
Discuss .. Pull .. or just assign the code to the developer that is
"responsible" for that part..

I mean .. easy code that I cann fully read and understand - like
Richards corrections with just new URL .. I can pull that ..
But code that I do not really understand I dont pull ..
And if more developers on IRC are looking at one pull request it would
be easier to discuss und understand and probably pull in the end ..

one hour every first thursday in a month from 20:00 to 21:00 GMT ..
That should be manageable ..

kind regards
Werner

That was it, I moved everything into a transaction and it is super fast now.

He, he. At least it saved a few bytes on the development machines :-)

Ok, I'll merge it into master. Hopefully it does not cause too much 
damage...

This discussion reminds me of a discussion in the Gnome team not long ago.

I think QGis developers might be helped with this:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2 becomes slow and freezes when editing and
	saving PostGIS layers
Message-ID: <1383945870.74979.YahooMailNeo@web122303.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

In the recent times it has happened to me a strange thing, and I do not know what is the source, it may be that you have already identified something.

When working with Postgis layers in QGIS, every time I "save" changes of an editing layer, I notice that the recording process is slower, until the moment when QGIS ends up freezing.

Another situation where QGIS freezes very often, is when creating new fields/columns in the attribute table of PostGIS layers. I add new fields, but when I try to save them, QGIS freezes and PostgreSQL keep the UPDATE process of the table as IDLE. In some cases, after stopping the process, I see that the changes were saved and applied to the table, but I have to kill QGIS because it is frozen.

This has happened to anyone? I really do not know if it is a QGIS problem, but the truth is that I do not remember this happening with QGIS 1.8, and now it happens to me very often.

PostGIS (2.0.1 / PostgreSQL 9.1.10) is in a remote Linux machine, but on the same network. QGIS is version 2.0.1 on a Windows 7 machine.


Thank you very much.

Best regards,
Pedro

Confirmed for me yesterday! A commit process stays idle in database server. I
was blaming antivirus at start, but it seems related to the number of commit
done in an edit session..

Hi Regis,

Do you also think that this does not happen (at least as often) with QGIS 1.8?

Dear Nathan and fellow QGIS Users/Developers:

I am sorry that people are not encouraging the use of C++ for programming. I think this is not helpful at all. There are many reasons to skip Pyhton infavor of C++. In my experience Python is very slow for real computationally intensive work. Also QGIS itself is written in C++, why are do some asking it is too hard. I think it is the lack of documentation that is making development in C++ very difficult for many of us who are not in the QGIS development all the time. This also means that there will be less and less developers that can help with enhancement in expanding QGIS capability. I don't know if some are thinking that "We are the ones who can do it in C++ and let others be content with Python." But I am assuming trusting that that is is not so. 
So please answer questions and provide feedback when you can, but please do not discourage others from pursuing C++. In my opinion, it is still the most robust programming tool available.? Why is QGIS written in C++ and not in Python?

I would even say that you would reduce your 3000 line count because Python is a lot less verbose then C++ and allows for some pretty handy styles that reduce the needed code.?

I use PyCharm as my Python IDE which I have so far found to be the best. ?It supports PyQt API auto completion.

Hi Maaza, I think that for a plugin python makes much more sense due to the
easier distribution. I developed plugins in both c++ and python and I must
say that python was much faster to develop also.
I m not saying c++ is bad, on the contrary, i like its structured and
robust nature, I m just making a point for python ease of distribution and
quick  development.
Regarding performance, python is not as bad as you describe it, foremost if
using numpy for the numerical crunching. and even, you could just move the
computation in a c module _after_ you actually measure that python is too
slow.

so it is not that some want to be the ones that can do it in c++ (I had
basically no c++ knowledge when I did my first c++ plugin) it is just that
Python advantages are noteworthy.

ciao

This can be the case however in most cases this is not what people are
doing.  Pythons speed is perfectly fine, or not even noticeable in most
cases.  If you need to do something that requires heavy processing then you
can use external Python libraries that are written in C, things like numpy
or scipy.  Calling those is just as fast as doing it in C (minus the
overhead of the Python parser).   Qt is written in C++ so most of the time
calling it from Python is fast anyway.    This comes down to a case of not
over optimizing before you need, if there is one part of the application
 that needs to be really fast but you can gain improved dev time with
Python then I would use Python and write the extra needed fast bit in C.

Developing plugins for QGIS in Python is the preferred route because they
are more portable and easy to deploy i.e we don't have to compile anything.
Creating a C++ plugin means you have to build it for each platform that you
want it to run, in Python you just run the code and it works (provided you
are running the same version of Python which we normally are).   Most
plugin writers are not C++ devs (or even developers at all) so Python is a
easy to learn language for them.  I could teach my wife Python in about a
day, C++ not so much.   That is the two main reasons we don't encourage
people to create C++ plugins.  But if that is what you need then we are not
going to stop.

QGIS is written in C++ because of a lot of reason. PyQt was not as feature
rich as it is now, Gray was a C++ developer, we do need the speed in some
places in the code, etc.  QGIS could be written in Python if someone ever
wanted to do it.

I d try to avoid august and December due to many people having holidays.

jan/may/sep would coincide with the hack fest which might be sub optimal.

+1 for feb/jun/oct or mar/jul/nov

if we consider the hack fest in sept/april, then the feb schedule would
have the hackfest in the feature freeze month while the march schedule not.

opinions?

Good plan! I do not care which three months, it will always coincide
with something or a holiday somewhere in the world :-)

Pick one, and let us try to stick to that.

This happened to me in 1.8, but was never able to pin down why. QGIS would become responsive again after a while, and the slow down when you tried to save the next edit.

It was with point layers that I had the problem with. Not sure if it affected lines or polygons.

Had to close down QGIS and open again.

Hi,

This happens to me with other layer types, these latter cases were with polygon (multipolygon) layers.

Message-ID: <3303607C363326428068EA203A921FA307F37823@EMAIL.neath-porttalbot.gov.uk>

Hi Everyone

Is there a way to access the Run Feature Action tool from the API?

Most other tools can be switched with 

qgis.utils.iface.action...().trigger()

but I can't see any reference to the action tool in there.

In the API I can see actionFeatureAction under QgisApp and
QgisAppInterface but I'm not sure how to or if they can be accessed from
inside QGIS.

Thanks

Tom

I d try to avoid august and December due to many people having holidays.

jan/may/sep would coincide with the hack fest which might be sub
optimal.

+1 for feb/jun/oct or mar/jul/nov

if we consider the hack fest in sept/april, then the feb schedule would

Noding should involve all nearby features, updating each of them to
include the new node.

I bet, it's not easy to "manually" put points in critical spots of a
floating point grid !

Good plan! I do not care which three months, it will always coincide
with something or a holiday somewhere in the world :-)

Pick one, and let us try to stick to that.

Hi Denis

 

Thanks for your reply.

 

What I'm trying to do is set Run Feature Action to be the active tool
(equivalent of user pressing the action button on the attributes
toolbar) rather than actually programmatically firing the action itself.

 

This command does exactly what I'm looking for but with the identify
tool 

 

qgis.utils.iface.actionIdentify().trigger()

 

Hope this makes sense

 

Thanks again

 

Tom

	Good plan! I do not care which three months, it will always
coincide

	Pick one, and let us try to stick to that.

Ah, ok, sorry.

Not sure you can actually set a predefined map tool using the API since 
mFeatureAction is defined in a private class Tools [0].
I would ask confirmation for this.

Otherwise, you could create your own map tool QgsMapToolFeatureAction 
with your defined action. You can use as example the code in [1] and 
[2], that would be:
featureAction = new QgsMapToolFeatureAction( self.iface.mapCanvas() )
featureAction->setAction( yourAction )
self.iface.mapCanvas().setMapTool( featureAction )

Hope it helps a bit.

Cheers,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Print composer item resizing broken?
Message-ID: <5280ED37.1060904@carto.net>

Hi,

In the current master I cannot resize items interactively in the print
composer. It reacts to resizing, but after I release the mouse button
the width or height of the item jumps back to the original width/height.

Resizing through the "Position and width" settings in the item
properties panel seems to work.

I created a new issue: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9044

-------------

On Windows I noticed that many shortcuts are not available: e.g. delete
(del), paste in place (ctrl-shift-v), undo (ctrl-z), select all
(ctrl-a). Somehow they are not assigned anymore? On Ubuntu they are
still correctly assigned.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi all.
Trying to put data entry in production, I spotted a few potential issues:
* the Value map widget does not seem to work correctly, as it invariably enters it to
the table the description, not the value: anyone confirms?
* the checkbox widget adds a single box; it would seem more appropriate to add two
radio buttons, with their respective values (e.g. Yes/No) besides
* it does not seem possible to replace the name of the field with a more descriptive
label: am I missing something?
* as an alternative, a description can be added as a title of a group in container;
thins is a reasonable workaround; in this case, however, hiding the name of the
column would be good.
If confirmed, I can open issues and feature reqs.
Thanks.

Hi Paolo,

Some remarks inside:

> appropriate to add two radio buttons, with their respective values
> (e.g. Yes/No) besides

I think a checkbox is reasonably well suited for yes/no, true/false.
What you describe is a radio-button - which would be a different
widget in my opinion. It should not replace the checkbox but should be
an additional widget.

> * it does not seem possible to replace the name of the field with a
> more descriptive label: am I missing something?

Have you tried the "Alias"? It should do exactly what you want and
works for both the standard form and the d'n'drop form

IMHO a checkbox is a non-exclusive choice among a list, a radio button is an
alternative between two items. If this is true, the current behaviour of the widget
is one of a radio button.

Great, thanks: I was trying to use the comment, as Alias was hidden on a small screen.

Andreas, can you confirm the possible bug on the Value map widget?

Thanks a lot.

Hi all,

Following Thomas' question, I wonder if it is possible to set a QGIS map 
tool using setMapTool.

The map tools are private variable so I suppose it's impossible for 
example to set the identify map tool as the current tool.

Am I wrong?

Thanks,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Globe Navigation Buttons
Message-ID: <5280FDD0.4090200@gmx.ch>

Hi all,

Working on the globe I realized, that

- The "Home" button is a duplicate of the "globe" button between the arrows

Is this intentional? Is it okay if I remove the home button? IMO the
globe uses less space and the icon is better suited than a house.

- The "Sync" button (two round arrows looking like a recycle sign) does
not do anything

Should this sync the globe extent to the current map canvas extent?

If there is no problem with these two changes, I'll happily implement them.

Thank you for a short feedback,
Matthias

[0] originaly it was not there, I guess it sneaked in ;) yes please 
remove the house

Originally it did refresh the globe view and there was another button 
for syncing [1] (yay quoting myself ;)) and [2]
> If there is no problem with these two changes, I'll happily implement them.
probably both should disappear and there should be only one symbol for 
syncing the extents. not big fan of the recycling icon for syncing 
extents but maybe it's ok.

ciao :)

Hi all.
Several Debian users (including myslef) have noticed that following an upgrade of the
system QGIS crshes on startup. It is therefore likely that a strict dependency is
missing from the package, so that an ABI incompatibility may arise.
All the best.

Hi Denis

you can do that by triggering identify action (will call setMapTool for you):
>>> iface.actionIdentify().trigger()

A bit of an update on how this is progressing:

I got reasonably close to cherry picking a large number of commits from
master which apply to the 2.0 branch. Originally, I'd included any fixes
which were applicable, including commits which introduce new strings or
change strings. In hindsight this was a mistake - I don't think any string
changes should be pulled into the 2.0 branch as this would then require
translation updates/etc. So I'm going to re-go through my branch and remove
these fixes.

There's quite a lot of useful fixes which do apply nicely to 2.0, so I
still think a point release is a good idea. I'll post an update when I've
got my branch ready to merge.

What's the chance we can get the minimum qt version bumped up to 4.6?
There's a large number of issues relating to rotation of composer
items [1] which would be much easier to fix if I can use
QGraphicsItem::setRotation and QGraphicsItem::rotation, both of which
were introduced in 4.6.

Andreas,
Can you try clicking the "Unlock all" button and then try again?
That's the kind of behaviour which applies at the moment to locked
items. It's not great, but it's waiting on me implementing
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4358 (it's underway at the moment, see [0]
). Then I'll make it so locked items can't be selected at all, and
pass any mouse interactions to the next unlocked item below them.
Let me know if unlocking the items helps with this.

I can't replicate this myself -- is anyone else seeing this behaviour?

I'd be in favour of setting it to the minimum available in major OSs.
In Debian stable the standard is 4.8.2. What about Windows and OSX?
All the best.

Hi Martin,

Thanks a lot for your answer.

It does bring me a bit further!

But I was looking for setting the "run action feature" map tool (I took 
identify as an example).

I see the function returning the action for it is missing. Do you know 
if it's intended or not?

Thanks again,

Denis

Hi

I think it depends on what is the "oldest" distribution we would like
to support ..
I guess that would be Ubuntu 10.04 lucid lynx - LTS .. which has
libqtcore4 (4.6.2) at the moment..

Dropping the "support" for lucid would bring us to Ubuntu 12:04 which
is precise pengolin - LTS and has libqt4-core (4.8.1) currently

so in either way .. if I am not wrong with assuming that for every
other OS there is newer QT available QT4.6 is currently the minimum
version anyway (unless we drop lucid which will make the jump to QT4.8)

Lucid is officially supported by canonical until May 2013 (Desktop) -
We already passed that .. And April 2015 (Server) - thats 1 1/2 years..

So as a conclusion .. I assume as QGIS is a Desktop application we
passed the life cycle of lucid ..
Still the QGIS-Server part might be of interest ..
Is it possible to compile "just" the server-part with Qt4.6?

I'd rather take the step forward to 4.8 either .. even the stable
version of debian (which is usually behind everything) has QT4.8.

Opinions?

Kind regards
Werner

For me +1 to set Qt 4.8 as a minimum for next release of QGIS.... Qt
4.8.0 is now nearly two years old - seems like distributions have had
enough time to get the packages ready.

It would be nice to finally be able to use the new features (e.g. QML
- and have qgis_qml library with QML canvas, legend...)

Martin

Hi Denis

I think it is missing just because nobody needed it yet - instead of
leaving it out intentionally. Feel free to add it.

Message-ID: <CALuHMPAvdjB7Mm0p+f_ZyWh7chHwNqmL7SUJWckfTk-SC+uD6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

playing with QGIS composer I found that it crashes after setting composition
via Python. If I just open new composer from plugin all fine, but if I
try to set
prepared composition (to allow user tweak it) I got crash. Interestingly, that
same code works fine from Python console, issue exists only if I run code
from plugin.

Ticket in redmine with test plugin and crash dump [0].

Anyone confirms? Any ideas what is wrong?

Hi all.
I just noticed that adding a custom title to a plot does not remove

Hi all.
I think multithreading has been removed from the new version of

Hi Nyall,

You were right - these were locked items. Depending on the zoom factor 
the lock icon is hidden under the handles - that's probably why I did 
not see the lock item.

I closed the bug report http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9044

-------------

The shortcut issue still exists. Maybe it is because I have installed 
QGIS 2.0 and 2.1 in parallel? Do the settings of the two versions 
interfer with each other?

Thanks,
Andreas

Maybe the composition gets garbage collected and you need to make sure, 
you keep a reference to it, as long as its used?
Or is it supposed, that ownership is transferred?

Thank you for your work Nyall.

I think one important safety measure when doing point releases would be
ensuring that the existing successful tests remains successful.
I know it's not easy as there's no 100% succeeding testsuite right now
(would help _a_lot_ to have one), but you could compare the runs between
the two branches (2.0.1 and 2.0.2-dev).

Ideally (one day) backports would not be allowed if without a testcase
to prove the fix was needed :)

I keep reference to composer and composition. I will check

Hi all,
just got an error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"C:\Users\pippo/.qgis2/python/plugins\cadtools\tools\parallellinetool.py",
line 146, in createParallelLine
    print "************************888"
IOError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor

Hope this helps debugging it.
All the best.

Hi

I'm using qgis 2.0.1 64 bits on ubuntu 12.04.
I got one l:ayer, a point layer named points.shp.

When I scroll the map, the vector layers appear and disappear without reason.

Any idea ? Is this a bug ? If yes, is there a bug tracker that I can feed ?
For some times : the data are available here :

Julien

Hi Paolo,

Can you please provide the QGIS version to test against?
Did you use master or 2.0.1?

Thanks,
Angelos

I think if a case be made that x amount of money would put 3 full time
positions for the project ( I would suggest mainly squash bugs) people might
actually contribute.

+1 nothing more motivating that seeing bugs fixed quickly, it gives faith in
the tool

Subject: [Qgis-developer] wrong classification class boundaries in joined
	data?
Message-ID: <52827CA4.30202@duif.net>


Hi Devs,

I'm pulling a discussion from users list to this list. See:

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2013-November/024914.html

We see that when symbolizing data with a joined table, based on an
attribute from the joined table the 'wrong'(?) values are used to
determine the class boundaries.

Eg:
point 1
point 2

and table
1 1
2 2
200 200
300 300

will be joined to

1 1
2 2

(left join)

BUT when you ask QGIS to create a classification it will use the 200 and
300 values too! While available in the original table, they are NOT
availabe in the joined data.

We think this is an error. See
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9051

I could think of scenario's in which you want this behaviour, but I
think it is more obvious to NOT take those values into account, and
maybe make it option to use ALL values.

Do you agree?
Or do we miss something?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Thomas,

In the latest master, you can now use:
iface.actionFeatureAction.trigger()

Cheers,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SOAP from the Python console in QGIS
Message-ID: <1384340353966-5088922.post@n6.nabble.com>

I?m trying to install a SOAP API kaldet SUDS, on a Windows 7 OS, to be able
to run SOAP from the QGIS Python console and pyQGIS/Python scripts.

The only Python I have installed is the one comming with QGIS 2.01
standalone. How can I install an external Python library like SUDS, to be
used within QGIS Python?

Thanks,
Jakob

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rotation of Labels
Message-ID: <528396EE.7040701@jena.de>

Hi,

I am wondering if the rotation of labels is as it should be. I am using 
a point layer containing text strings and rotation angles.
When setting the "Quadrant" of the label (option "Offset from point") 
the label is first displaced from the point and then rotated around _the 
label's centre_. IMHO the behaviour should be to rotate the label around 
_the label point_.
Opinions?

Bernhard

The default placement for "Offset from point" is the center of the label
registered over the point (or Quadrant wouldn't make much sense). Applying
a rotation that rotates the label around a different point seems
unintuitive to me, but maybe I am not understanding your alternative.

Can you show this graphically, along with the settings that would produce
the individual graphics? And, maybe expand more upon the general use case?

I am unclear what you mean by _the label point_. Do you mean the label's
default rotation origin (lower left), or do you mean the feature point?

I also chose rotating around the center of the label to ensure the label
stays 'contained' within the specified quadrant. There is extra code to
ensure the label's location is shifted to keep the overall label inside the
quadrant; otherwise, applying a rotation would break the concept of
choosing a quadrant.

Regards,

Larry

When this was last discussed [0] (over a year ago, and to no conclusion),
the lowest version for Qt, on a production platform providing QGIS, was
4.5, but there were third-party updates for those platforms even then.

+1 for at least Qt 4.6 as the new minimum. However, with some more
research, we may find 4.7, or even 4.8, reasonable.

On the Mac side of things, I think William has routinely shipped QGIS with
the most recent stable version of Qt 4 at the time. The nightly is also
built that way. Currently on Mac OS X 10.6-9 this would be Qt 4.8.5.

For OSGeo4W, it looks like the x86 installer provides 4.7.1, while the
x86_64 installer is at 4.8.5 [1].

[1] http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/versions_diff-x86-x86_64.html

It would be nice to finally be able to use the new features (e.g. QML

+1 for this. In fact, I think it is very important to investigate what
moving to an entire QGIS GUI built upon QML would take (or if it is even
possible, yet). And personally, I see Digia focusing most of its energy in
QML, though I think Qt Wdigets have at least a good 5-year "shelf life."
Side note: new Ubuntu Touch OS (to be installable on many Android tablets)
runs QML natively for its GUI [2].

Hi Larry,
you're right, this is taking too long. I'd suggest to move to 4.8. The
only major distro where we'll have issues is win32, but upgrading
there shouldn't be a major problem (and it is anyway desirable to keep
64 and 32 in sync).
I'd suggest that if nobody raises serious issues within, say, a week,
we move forward.
Thanks.

Hi Larry,

description of problem:
I have label points and rotation angles ranging from 0 to 360 degrees. 
The label point is the lower left corner of the _rotated_ label.
Current behaviour is:
If I set a quadrangle the label is displaced and rotated, the lable's 
center being the rotation centre. I see from your answer that this is 
the intended behaviour because, as you write, "otherwise, applying a 
rotation would break the concept of choosing a quadrant."
My expectation was:
The centre of rotation is the feature point to be labeled. Thus choosing 
the right quadrant and roting with 90 degrees would result in a label 
being straight upward from the feature point. I would call this 
intuitive but the current behaviour is intuitive, too :-)
My current workaround:
Set the quadrant data defined from the rotation angle (CASE), results are ok

regards

Bernhard

Hi Stefano,

The necessary files are already on your computer. They are in
%OSGEO4WRoot%\bin - pyuic4.exe, pyrcc4.exe and designer.exe for creating
forms.

If you use the OSGeo4W shell they should already be in the path. If you
use the regular cmd.exe DOS console you should make sure that
%OSGEO4WRoot%\bin is in your PATH variable.

Hope this helps to get started.

Hi George

I had a lot of trouble with those issues too, and I would really love to see them fixed. In other words, I agree with Giovanni that these are pretty important bugs for many and not really uncommon digitization use-cases and would support his categorization as blocker...

However, my current workaround is to ignore the untidiness in the topology at first and then send the vector dataset through GRASS which is (at least for not too big datasets) quite convenient using the Sextante/Processing framework (see also discussion here):

Hi,

So if there is so much interest in having this issue fixed I assume that
there would be plenty out there who would fund the fix!

The fix won't happen if noone pays for it - just complaining about this
does not help.

Get an estimate from some developer (e.g. Sandro Santilli oder
Sourcepole) to know how much it would cost to fix.

As much as I like GRASS - and it is very good to know that this
workaround exists (thanks Stefan for mentioning it!) - I don't think it
is reasonable to ask people to go through GRASS to get proper data out
of their QGIS digitized data set.

Who will take the lead to ask a developer?

Andreas

	Ah, ok, sorry.
	
	Not sure you can actually set a predefined map tool using the
API since mFeatureAction is defined in a private class Tools [0]. 
	I would ask confirmation for this.
	
	Otherwise, you could create your own map tool
QgsMapToolFeatureAction with your defined action. You can use as example
the code in [1] and [2], that would be:
	featureAction = new QgsMapToolFeatureAction(
self.iface.mapCanvas() )
	featureAction->setAction( yourAction )
	self.iface.mapCanvas().setMapTool( featureAction )
	
	Hope it helps a bit.

I can't remember how many times I blamed the user not to digitize the
right way, and at the end discovered that is a qgis issue... that by
the way affects not only postGIS, but Spatialite and shapes as well...

This bug is critical because among the other things is misleading
about how correct can be the work of digitizing topologically correct
maps.

cleaning afterwards is certainly a possibility, especially now is
easier with processing/sextante,
but still it is not an easy solution for the average user. Moreover
importing vectors into GRASS data model using the snapping
can do miracles, but also can change slightly the geometries, and
sometimes this is not an option.

having a topological editing toolbox, that will allow to choose the
rules beforehand, seems still a long shot so relying on basically the
only rule available should be possible o should work.

I already asked a few devs without response.

Ive even dug under the cpp hood to see if I could find somethimg
interesting, and I did, but Im not sure on how to resolve the issue, since
cpp is kinda of  a black art for me :-)

Devs around the world! How much it will cost to fix this bug?

Hi Stefano,

To convert an ".ui" file to ".py" , you have to run on windows command :
"pyrcc4 -o interface.py interface.ui", where interface.ui is the file you
have created and interface.py is the output python code you want.

To conver ".qrc" to ".py" you have to do the same process as I described in
the "ui" to "py" convertion. It will be something like this : "pyrcc4 -o
resources.py resources.qrc".

pyrcc4  is a tool which comes with PyQt4 (Python library for GUI
applications). If you dont have it installed , just download it and install.

Regards,

Alex Theleritis

Shouldn't it be pyuic4 for compiling the UI file?

Hi ,

Yes Matthias, you are right. The command to convert the ui to py should be
"pyuic4 -o interface.py interface.ui". Thanks for pointing it out.

I think the slow poke is actually likely to be CentOS/Redhat based
linux. This probably matters more for QGIS server but we do list desktop
packages for that family. Qt 4.6.x appears to be what's in the current
CentOS/Redhat 6

+1 for moving minimum to 4.6

It's probably reasonable to bump Qt version once per year, so in 2014 if
CentOS/Redhat 7 comes out I expect it will have something newer (4.7+)

Traditionally this distro is the the furthest behind but is quite common
in corporate/enterprise deployments (more servers than desktops).

Thanks,
Alex

I do not like the idea of being held back from upgrading minimal
requirements by one distribution. I think it is fairly reasonable to
expect that only older software will work with older distributions.
Moreover, I guess the share of CentOS/Redhat users is quite low even
just among linux users because it is mainly server oriented. And even
then those users should not have trouble installing newer Qt from
third-party packages.

Finally, newer versions of Qt are also more stable - with a release of
new minor Qt version the older branch typically stops receiving
further bugfixes.

Martin

agreed fully - with tens of Linux distros, keeping with the one with the oldest Qt is
a major drawback.
besides this, I think we should move forward with a decision: having the same
discussion as one year ago, and not taking a decision, would be pointless.
in short: +1 for 4.8, please send your opinion.
all the best.

+1 for 4.8 too

As mentioned in earlier posts .. old Qt might only be interesting
running on servers .. and people using server should be able to
configure them (meaning being able to install everything by themself
if they really want to use very old distributions)

Hi all.
I just confirmed a nasty bug here:

It has to do with style, I suspect it has to do with a custom form defined in it.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Showing the QGIS Map
Message-ID: <1384506932649-5089298.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

I would like to be able to show the Map from a QT plugin mainwindow.

In the __init__ I do this:

# Save reference to the QGIS interface
self.iface = iface
# a reference to our map canvas
self.canvas = self.iface.mapCanvas()

And I connect this method on click on the "Show map" button :
def showCanvas(self):  
  self.canvas.show()

This does not run on linux. But at the beginning it seemed to run on
windows.
The problem is that now even on Windows, it does not run.

Can anyone tell me more about that ??

Thanks,
Bert

I am also for jumping to 4.8. I think that people using RHEL would still
not install QGIS 2 until it settles down a little. Until than RHEL 7 will
come out. I think i should have been done when QGIS 2 development began.

Hi Andreas

Of course I fully understand your point about the need for financing, and hopefully George`s offer will change things for topological correct editing.

However, there could be several reasons for a lack of funding until now:
Probably, many users are not really aware of the bug(s)? Back in 1.7.4 editing was no longer possible once invalid geometries were produced by "Avoid intersection" and users got an error message. Nowadays, you can continue digitizing without noticing that geometries are not topologically correct. The result looks good and you have to actively search (or check) for such digitization errors. I guess, not everybody does that, so I assume also a lack of awareness could be a reason for the lack of funding...

Furthermore, some users who are aware may prefer such (of course not too convenient) workarounds over trying to raise some money for funding a proper fix.
And finally, as it is unfortunately the case for me - for example -, even if I am seriously affected by the bug it is really very difficult (for not to say impossible) to raise a reasonable amount of money to get this (or another bugs) fixed, because:
In my Institute ArcGIS is the "Standard" GIS application, and I am one of few "nerds" (that is at least how I feel I am sometimes being looked at) who use OSGeo products. I was and am actively promoting (amongst other OSGeo applications) QGIS in my institute because I am convinced that QGIS is in many cases much more suitable for our purposes than ArcGIS. One very important activity is mapping (and digitizing) habitat types for public authorities, who request data with proper topology.
So, the topology problems are definitely an obstacle regarding promoting QGIS here. And since my bosses already paid for ArcGIS licenses (which does not have these problems) and a wider introduction of QGIS will also cause some extra transaction costs (e.g. learning) in short term, the consequence is that my institute will stick to ArcGIS. This makes it extremely difficult to convince my bosses to donate some money for bug fixing, even though QGIS offers (from my point of view) superior solutions for our problems and we will benefit from using QGIS in the long run... It is a bit of a witches circle in a way, and the only alternative would be to use private money...

Cheers
Stefan

Hi,

So if there is so much interest in having this issue fixed I assume that there would be plenty out there who would fund the fix!

The fix won't happen if noone pays for it - just complaining about this does not help.

Get an estimate from some developer (e.g. Sandro Santilli oder
Sourcepole) to know how much it would cost to fix.

As much as I like GRASS - and it is very good to know that this workaround exists (thanks Stefan for mentioning it!) - I don't think it is reasonable to ask people to go through GRASS to get proper data out of their QGIS digitized data set.

Who will take the lead to ask a developer?

Hi Stefan,

just approved the plugin.

Can you please make some docs more visible for new users. As in the
metadata.txt or so. (I finally found some when I actually started it in
step 2...). It would be nice if potential users also could see what
possibilities there are. And for me personally: which kind of garmins
can handle this custom maps (as I have two older types lying around
somewhere :-) ).

I was able to create topology in PostGIS, open it with TopoViewer and
digitize 2 nodes. But I gave up on edges because it asks me to fill in
values which are not known during digitizing ( e.g. next_left_edge
...). Anyway, the necessity to enter all topology info
(start_node,end_node, next_left_edge, next_right_edge...) makes it
unusable even for tests.

Do you have any demo data?

Why there are separate layers for next_right, next_left, face_right
etc? To display labels?

And what is this http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/pgtopoeditor/ ?

Then we have to extend/modify terminology. Definitely an area is not a
primitive, it must be distinguished from edges/nodes. Is it the ISO
standard calling areas primitives? What is the upper level above
areas, features?

OK, not really important for primitives editing, I think.

Attributes are attached to centorids.

Yes, GRASS does not need that, centroids are auto attached to areas.

point/centroid/node could be states of punctual layer
line/boundary may be states of linear layer

Layers are not provided by providers, providers know nothing about
existence of layers. But that is not that important, it can be done
somehow.

Until now, I was following your idea of multiple primitive layers
added on editing start. However it seems the easiest way to implement
it, I am not convinced that it is the right generic framework from
user point of view. Especially the manual switching between layers
during editing makes it inefficient for regular work. In general,
plenty of primitive layers is ugly.Could be the primitive layers
limited to maximum one per each geometry type?

Hi Richard

I shall add more documentation to the next (then hopefully stable) version. 

However I am not sure where that would be most suitable...
For the time being, I think an "about-dialog" (like e.g. in MergeShapes) would be best.

I do like the idea to include a more comprehensive description in the metadata.txt very much, but it would be too much text for the bold letters the text from the description-entry has in the plugin installer. Here I noticed quite different usage among plugin-devs. Compare for example, "MultiEdit" and "New Memory Layer".

For adding more documentation in the metadata.txt it would be really nice to have a "short_description" and a "long_description" which can be shown in bold or normal type in the excellent new plugin-installer...

Best regards
Stefan

Version 0.99 did not georeference images correctly.
Should be fixed in new version (0.100) which I uploaded a couple of minutes ago.
Furthermore, the new version has an improved dialog (fewer clicks).

Feedback very welcome...

Hi all.
When printing with Atlas, the labels for polygons outside the one in
focus are often cut. Using various options (a bit hackish, not very
easy to understand for the average user) the problem can be reduced,
but apparently not avoided altogether. I know in master we can use
conditional labelling (with an even more hacking method), but: is
there a simpler solution for qgis stable?
Thanks.

Hi Paolo, 
Do you somehow mask the area outside the polygon ? If yes i'm really
interested.
 If not, we are also wondering how to limit labeling only to objects within
the Atlas object. A way is to use expression generator to filter labels only
when the layer's object intersects Atlas current feature. We have to add
some global variables as Atlas output for this. 
Prototypes using user functions do work, but we have to check what happens
with big polygons. And that doesn't solve the labelling issue, where labels
can fall outside the Atlas polygon. 
IMO, we should end up with a global "Area of intersect" variable, and we
should have labeling options to tell if label must be drawn only for object
part inside AOI or not.. 
We'll produce probabaly a prototype of what could be a good behaviour and go
further with the community. 
Cheers
R?gis

In this case, it is OK to label polygons outside the current one; what is bad is to
truncate labels. I assume this means Atlas generates the whole map, the moves the
frame around, so lables are not placed according to the frame: is this interpretation
correct?
In any case, truncated labels should never occur.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Keep track of features in memory provider
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYoi8A=rw-W3oA0TxjpAxe6h8joC_zpoCRhHWiZeNNBBKw@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a trick how to keep track of features added to memory provider?

Say that feature with id is added to a memory provider. Original id is
overwritten by the memory provider. How to access the feature in the
provider by original id without additional attribute or hacks like
counting mNextFeatureId outside the provider.

Is it possible to add support for GDAL Rasterize to Processing? I see  
Polygonize but not Rasterize.

Hi, it was added to Qgis Master sometime ago. If you want to use QGIS 2.0.1
you can upgrade Processing from the plugin installer and get the code from
October 29th.

As far as I know, currently the most appropriate thing is to use 
layer.dataProvider().addFeatures() and to skip the edit buffer. But I 
think that layers should broadcast information about changing feature 
ids. This is not a problem unique to the memory provider.

That is what I am doing, but QgsMemoryProvider::addFeatures()
overwrites original feature id.

Another issue with writing directly to provider is, that attribute
table is not updated. So how to programmatically change features
avoiding edit buffer?

I'm new to android.
What do I need to do to install this version of QGIS on my Samsung Galaxy
Note 8?
I've tried the Android QGIS Installer on the nightly builds (last one
20131118), it downloads the package but fails installation.
Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] docker container: unshare namespace (sysadmin talk)
Message-ID: <528A6F64.5010804@gmx.ch>

I hope we have some experienced sysadmins here on the list who can bring
light into the dark.

The situation is

I try to build rpms for fedora/centos on our shiny new server where we
have docker.io set up, so we can easily create multiple containers for
the different tasks the server will run. So I have created a container
based on centos and installed mock (the tool fedora uses for packaging).

However, running mock (inside the container) fails:

  ERROR: Namespace unshare failed.

As far as I can tell, mock needs the "unshare" system call to create a
new mountpoint inside the process, where it can create a virtual build
environment. But calling namespace with CLONE_NEWNS fails with EPERM.
The manpage states:

       EPERM  flags specified CLONE_NEWNS but  the  calling  process 
was  not
              privileged (did not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability).

Trying to change this capability of the binary does not work, although
we are root inside the container, so I guess this kind of capabilities
gets inherited from my non-privileged user on the host itself. I assume
(untested) that the following command would fix this issue:

sudo lxc-docker run centos/qgis-nightly setcap cap_sys_admin+ep
/usr/sbin/mock

I would be very happy, if somebody with server administration and
especially capabilities experience could let me know, if this is a safe
thing and the right to do in order to solve this problem, because to me
this is all still black magic.

Regards
Matthias

It will return a (list of) new feature with the real id:

status, features = l.dataProvider().addFeatures( feats )
features[0].id()

I think we should rather fix this issue. I would very much like 
QgsVectorLayer to emit a signal, when it commits the features and 
changes their ids.

QgsVectorLayer::featureIdsChanged( QMap< QgsFeatureId, QgsFeatureId )

So you could connect to this and would not be forced to directly 
interact with the dataprovider.

Thanks Filipe!

Guess the AlgorithmExecutor error kept me from trying to go through with  
the update. Now I can access Rasterize.

I reckon since you are just bringing up your container, building your
package and then bringing it down without hosting any public service from
the container itself  (correct?) , its probably fine.

Indeed, that would be really great. Many times I had to use the provider 
because of this!

It would be nice to be able to modify data through vector layer but
 - without showing editing mode in legend
 - avoiding editing buffer (don't need to fiddle with id changes)
 - modify more features in one call, i.e. the same methods as provider
(hopefully to make efficient sending signals to attribute table)

OTOH, provider should also have a chance to let layer know about
changes, for example dynamic layers or ongoing discussion about
topological editing (multiple layer with the same source).

Doesn't the layer emit featureDeleted and featureAdded when the id changes
anymore?

I think it does.
The drawback of the current approach is, that you don't have any 
context and don't know if the feature was really deleted or got a new 
id. Therefore updating a reference to a temporary feature id (in memory 
or inside another layer) with the real feature id is almost impossible.

Agreed, I don't think this is possible yet. This would solve some of the
problems you outlined above.

Concerning the efficiency of sending signals to the attribute table, I
think it would be good, if besides the QgsVectorLayer::featureAdded(
QgsFeatureId ) signal another signal QgsVectorLayer::featureAdded(
QgsFeature& feature ) would be introduced. This way, it would not be
necessary to create a new feature request with a FilterFID for every new
feature the table receives. I guess this would already avoid a lot of
overhead. And then we could also send batch signals like we do for
QgsVectorLayer::selectionChanged so there would be only one signal
instead of one per feature.

There is a (very concise) text here:

http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/support.html#issue-tracker

which is working for me :-(

After creating an Osgeo account (of which I'm pretty sure Mike already
has (if he is the mike I know :-) ), you can 'just login' at qgis with
your osgeo account (which if you have not 'registred' yet with QGIS will
add you to our 'shadow list of users', giving us the opportunity to add
some user related info/permissions).

So the right track would be
1) create a new osgeo user if not already done:
https://www2.osgeo.org/cgi-bin/ldap_create_user.py
2) use THAT username/password to login at QGIS
via (http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues)
https://hub.qgis.org/login

if this is NOT working, please let me know what your (osgeo/qgis) userid
is, I can look it up in our user list.

And if the text is not clear enough, please take some time to make it
clear (an email to me or community list is ok). As
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/support.html#issue-tracker should
be clear and working.

Hi all.
I have problems with this simple model:

* if I put I dummy parameter (0), the model fails.
Any hint?
All the best.

Hi all,

QgsMapToolEdit and QgsMapToolCapture are in src/app and not available in

digitizing tools.

Are there any specific reasons for having them in src/app? Is it
possible to expose
them in Python?

Message-ID: <7447393869595D4EBC20745A4F48BA1F0D599F6E@RTPWEXC18.RCC_NT.RTI.ORG>

I installed QGIS 2.0 using the Window standalone installer (64 bit) on
October 4, 2013. Has there been any fixes to this installer and a new
one made available on the website since then? I noticed there are some
things missing and certain features do not work. Seems to be missing
some GDAL components. 

I cannot add or view Excel tables.

When I run some GRASS tools like v.sample I get this error in the log:
GRASS_INFO_ERROR (48804.1): Unable to load GDAL library.

When installing the new GarminCustomMap plugin, I get this error loading
plugin message: The plugin depends on some components missing in your
system. You need to install the following Python module in order to
enable it: _gdal_array.

I see this was reported by Nathan Woodrow back on September 20 and he
said: Can someone please look into this as having all these broken
windows builds going out isn't very good.

Has this issue been addressed and has the windows standalone installer
been fixed?

 

Thanks so much for any help,

David

Message-ID: <CANwy9RTSjDGBDGaDRtCnv4shm_fX--QJ4+zHHcvRAKtExJGK2A@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings everyone!  I am new to the list and the QGIS community, and I am
looking for a bit of strategic direction from the experts.  I am building a
landscape-level wildfire simulation model.  The model will simulate change
and development of a natural forested landscape over centuries of time as
forest grow and wildfires occur.  The mechanics of the model are fairly
simple, and I will likely implement these in a c module for reasonable
performance.  The model simulates wildfire ignition and spread on a raster
surface, with generations representing future time periods.  As the model
runs it will gather statistics and save information about conditions of
each generation.

I am considering using QGIS as a platform for the simulation model.  I
think there would be some nice benefits of making my model be a
python-based plugin that could leverage a lot of the data handling involved
with the spatial data sets, plus it looks like I could build an attractive
and function ui quite painlessly.  Here are some of the features that I
would like that I am pretty sure I can get from the QGIS platform:
- easy access to raster data sets via gdal.
- easy way to capture input parameters (data sources, regions of interest,
simulation model options) using pyQt and qgis platfrom.
- nice way to display final results from simulation, by save results out to
raster data set and then displaying in map canvas
- quite likely easy ways to display summary results as charts and
histograms.
So far +++ for QGIS.

I have done a little bit of research to find out what it will take, and I
think the pieces are there. But there are a couple of things that I am not
sure about and I would like to ask the experts before I dig myself in to a
hole.

The simulation model will take a long time to run and I don't want it to
stall the GUI as it is performing.
1) Does qg support background processing?  Where can I read about the
synchronization mechanism?  If not, what is the best way to handle this?

It would be really nice to be able to have a dynamic display of the ongoing
simulation as it is running.  I was thinking that I could use a GDAL
in-memory driver (http://www.gdal.org/frmt_mem.html) to hold simulated
conditions.
2) If I did this, could I display this type of raster in the qg map
canvas?  What kind of synchronization is required so the simulation pauses
when the map is redrawn due to user interaction (zooming or panning for
example).

3) How will I be able to signal the map canvas when it is time for an
update?  Is QgsMapLayer.dataChanged() sufficient?   I see that someone else
has tried this and had difficulty:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.qgis.devel/21481.  I assume that
the problem there was that the method was stalling the event loop.  What
are the rules for event loop interactions?

4) Can I update my raster map layer without having to re-draw the other
layers that may be on the the map canvas?  Does the map canvas support
compositing?  I see that QgsMapLayer supports an image cache, but I have
not found any explanation of how to use it.

At this stage I'm looking for some clues.  I think there may be some
multi-threading issues to my design that require careful attention.  I see
that multi threading has been discussed in the context of rendering (
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/2037) but I am not sure about the current
status, or if this is the solution to my problem (perhaps not).  Any
suggestions, opinions or pointers to code or documentation would be greatly
appreciated.  If this is just a case of rtfm then I would be happy to hear
that also.

Cheers,

Tom

Hi, Tom. Your PyQT plugin would stall the main thread with a long process.
You can launch threads, but that would still cause problems because of the
python interpreter lock, which only allows a single thread access at once,
so stall other threads.

You will need to launch a process to calculate the results.

There are mechanisms in python to chat between the processes in shared
memory. I've played with some of them, and they can vary between fast and
slow, depending on the details- it can still lock your main thread if you
do it wrong.

I had a multi-process app filling four cores with analysis, but it would
slow down once the individual runs started bringing data back to the
central collator. It would block the queue of all process, bringing
performance to a crawl.

If you are doing what I hope you are doing, then I would love to
participate in bringing an FBP fire simulator to QGIS in open code.
Particularly if it can then be used to do crazy things like be a process
step in a forest simulation...

Yes, I am a fellow Canadian QGIS user, and I believe we have met, although
it's been a while... :-). I think we had a beer in Montana's in Thunder Bay
in 2008, if that helps... :-)

If you were interesting in collaborating, drop me a direct email. As long
as it is open source, I can play. If it's tight to your company, I will
have to defer.

Cheers,
Angus Carr.

Hi Angus

We have met for sure.  How ya doing?  Yes, the simulation model will be
open source :).  In the longer term it would be nice to make this be part
of a larger forest simulation, including links to a spatial management
model, but that is not the immediate priority.

Thanks for the tips about multiple processes and shared memory.  Hmmmm... I
suspect that it might be slightly tidier to keep this all within one
process, at least I would like to give it a try to start with.  Once I have
built up enough callous tissue on my forehead maybe I'll come back to this.

As you can imagine from my newbie questions I'm not a python guy.  While I
really like a lot of the modern mechanisms in python I have never been able
to look at a python script without being puzzled by the retro/hipster
nature of using whitespace as syntax.  As someone who once lined up fortran
statements on punch cards you will have to pry whitespace indifferent
languages from my cold hunt-n-peck fingers. Anyway, I'm expecting to use
python for the ui and glue code, and do all of the number crunching in a C
module.  Horses for courses eh?

Good point about the global interpreter lock.  This might not be a problem
because I should be able to instantiate the simulator in the main
interpreter, and then kick it off into its own compute thread (PyQt QThread
I guess?).  It looks like the GIL gets released when entering compiled code
(
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1595649/threading-in-a-pyqt-application-use-qt-threads-or-python-threads)<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1595649/threading-in-a-pyqt-application-use-qt-threads-or-python-threads>,and
I should be able to use the Qt QueuedConnnection signal/slot mechanism from
within C to safely communicate back and forth between the worker thread and
the app.  But regardless, the simulation code wont need to interact with
python once it has been initialized other than a few housekeeping bits that
can probably be handled using signals and handlers in the C code (send
status to app, accept pause/continue/terminate in the worker thread, etc).
I think I'm OK here.

With respect to my previous point 2) I'm hoping that I can subclass the
raster data source, and add a QMutex/critical section around any calls to
fetch data through GDALDataset::RasterIO.  The simulator would use the same
critical section around the places where it is modifying shared data
structures.

I assume that I handle 3) using a signal/slot mechanism: set the
dataChanged() state on the map layer in the simulation thread and then send
a qt signal to the app that it needs to refresh the map canvas.  Can anyone
confirm if this is the way to do it?

As for my previous point 4)  (map layer image caching and map canvas
compositing), I was hoping that someone could point me towards some
documentation about this apparent feature.  Does anyone know any more about
this one?  Although I can just give it a try, it would be nice to know what
I'm getting in to before I get too far down the road.

Thanks,

Tom

Hi Tom

Besides the technical aspects, just in case you do not know them yet, you may probably get some scientific inspirations from e.g. r.los (and related modules) in GRASS (see http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/r.ros.html) which represent existing GIS models for wildfire spread. Maybe something to build on...?

Cheers
Stefan

Hi all,

I want to create a subproject of User Plugins at hub.qgis.org, but there is
no create new Subproject option avalaible. So I created a new project, named 
Vertices Counter <http://hub.qgis.org/projects/vertices-counter>   to
complete the required metadata for my plugin, but it's not a subproject of
User Plugins. Is it possible my project to be moved under "User Plugins" by
the Administrator or should I follow another procedure?

Thanks in advance,

Alexis Theleritis

Hi Anita,

It sounds similar to this issue:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6476

Maybe data-defined anything won't work on ellipse markers??

Message-ID: <1385042699659-5090480.post@n6.nabble.com>

I'm trying to build QGIS with QtCreator. I am following the instructions
found in:
  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/CODING
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/CODING>   (4. Getting up and

the build but fails.

I am able to build QGIS using Visual Studio 2008 but with the aim of more

Any idea?

My goal is to build a slightly modified version of Qgis able, among other

Thanks in advance.

Already fixed,

I changed the setting of "pyconfig.h" for not use the library
"python27_d.lib".   But it is also necessary to comment the definition of
Py_DEBUG like this:

# ifdef _DEBUG
/ / # Define Py_DEBUG
# endif

------------

In summary, pyconfig.h:

Changes:

# ifdef _DEBUG
# Define Py_DEBUG

to

# ifdef _DEBUG

and

# Ifdef _DEBUG

Message-ID: <1105033563.706464296.1385058905052.JavaMail.root@zimbra75-e12.priv.proxad.net>

hello,

FYI, I have just sent a PR to add some information for the final user in the ui. This PR add classes with boundary limit like [ 0 - 12] or ] 12 - 24 ] for the next classes instead of 0 - 12 and 12 - 24.

As I am not a developper, I just do some modification in the cpp files which seem to work as expected, if anything is wrong, I will try to improve my patch following your comment. :)

thanks,

Hello Qgis Developers,

I am using Qgis 2.0.1 on Windows 7 64 bit and I am running into the same
problem as http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8670 and would like to get this fixed
and need to know an approximate cost to fix the bug.  Any information you
could provide would be appreciated.

Hi Alexander

in theory those two classes could be moved to the GUI library. However
they feel more like base classes for few particular classes, without
API that would clearly suggest when / why /  how somebody would need
to use them. So I am wondering what is the actual list of features
that you would like to use from QgsMapToolEdit and QgsMapToolCapture -
maybe a better solution would be to create a new utility class in GUI
library that would provide the desired functionality in a cleaner way
(e.g. message bar notifications, rubber band according settings,
geometry validator that creates vertex markers, ...)

Martin

QGIS does not have any special support for background processing.

One side thought: seems like your computation could be done within
Processing framework (used to be SEXTANTE before QGIS 2.0). The
obvious advantage is that you just write your algorithm and register
it, all GUI for input of parameters would be done by the framework.
But I do not think it currently supports things like continual updates
of the results in canvas.

You could have a dynamic display, but I am afraid it will not be very
simple / efficient.

I am not sure how could you do the dynamic display with in memory
raster - as far as I know it is not possible to pass existing GDAL
dataset to a raster layer nor get access to GDAL dataset of a raster
layer (but I have just limited knowledge about rasters in QGIS).
Probably you could use a temporary raster file for that. Also I do not
know what happens if a raster file changes while it is open as a
raster layer - whether it will pick up the changes or not (probably
depends on particular GDAL driver).

Regarding rendering of canvas - it is currently done in the main
thread, it simply iterates over all visible layers and reads data from
their providers. As mentioned above, the provider uses its own handle
to data (in your case GDAL dataset), so no synchronization is required
because the handle is not available outside of the provider (the
question is how GDAL handles external change of data of an opened
dataset).

Clearing layer's cached image and calling canvas' refresh() should be enough.

There is a feature called render caching - when turned on (in QGIS
preferences), all layer rendered images (for particular extent) are
cached in memory, so if only one layer changes, only that one will be
redrawn.

Let me note one more thing here: if you think of writing number
crunching in C, things will get more complicated: you will need to
compile and ship the binaries somehow - the plugin repository does not
accept plugins with architecture dependent binaries. Maybe try to have
a look at numpy module, it's fairly common for fast array/matrix
operations in python.

Message-ID: <CAFF9ZhvL7Pb5nS40rL-cE1xrnhjV76KkH3sw8yYF+vzqcKtGyA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I need to move raster layers in QGis of a specific delta X Y, all together,
or singularly.

They will be ECW, GeoTIFF, and also Tif +tfw .

My problem is:   the raster layer(s) need to move without rewrite them on
disk, but only changing in some way (that I want to discover with your
help) dinamically the origin, possibly using pyQGis programming.

There is some access to (something like)  "rlayer.origin.x, y'   to change
them ?


Thank you in advance to any info about it

Roberto

Dear Ed,

Nice to hear that someone is willing to pay for working on the OpenLayers 
plugin! The possibility to work on the plugin during day time would empty the 
bug list within a few days.. Will send you a quote off the list. Sould be a 
matter of 1-2 hours work. 

Regards
Pirmin

Hi Martin,

In short I need to create rubber band, where user digitize geometry
(snapping should be considered). Later this digitized geometry will
be applied to existing feature(s) and modify them.

Something similar to "Add part" or "Add ring" functionality.

Hi all,

I'm trying to debug QtCreator with QGIS in Windows 7-64 and Visual Studio
debugger (cdb.exe).

The build phase finished correctly but when i start the app or debug the
app in QtCreator, always fails with the following error:

:0: warning: Exception at 0x77121d82, code: 0xc0000139: DLL entry point not

:0: error: Exception at 0x770ce3be, code: 0xc0000005: read access violation

I tried whit CDB for x86 or x64.
The executable builded with QtCreator also fails. I am able to build QGIS
using Visual Studio 2008 and works correctly but the executable generated
with QtCreator fails.

I'm newbie on QGIS development, but it is necessary to do so. What is the
best way to debug QGIS in WIndows?

Thanks you.

	Tilesets
Message-ID: <1385124194.97303.YahooMailNeo@web172403.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hi!

I have :
QGIS 2.0.1 standalone
Windows XP Service Pack 3
MapServer 6.1
Apache 2.2.21 with mod-mapcache/0.5

I think there is one bug regarding the GetFeatureInfo tool for Tilesets.?

It does not work neither the mapserver/mapcache ?nor the geoserver!

The log is:

Map getfeatureinfo error: Cannot open /?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetFeatureInfo&BBOX=-4733798.08569699991494417,1434202.91430300008505583,5284956.08569699991494417,11452957.08569700084626675&SRS=EPSG:2100&WIDTH=1000&HEIGHT=1000&LAYERS=countries&STYLES=&FORMAT=image/png&QUERY_LAYERS=countries&INFO_FORMAT=text/html&X=509&Y=702&FEATURE_COUNT=10: Path is a directory [/?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetFeatureInfo&BBOX=-4733798.08569699991494417,1434202.91430300008505583,5284956.08569699991494417,11452957.08569700084626675&SRS=EPSG:2100&WIDTH=1000&HEIGHT=1000&LAYERS=countries&STYLES=&FORMAT=image/png&QUERY_LAYERS=countries&INFO_FORMAT=text/html&X=509&Y=702&FEATURE_COUNT=10]

Obviously, qgis tries to open the url without the host name. The correct url is "http://localhost/mapcache/?SERVICE=WMS.........etc", and not ?"/? SERVICE=WMS.........etc"

Please mind that the problem derives from point-query to tilesets and not wms layer.


Thanks in advance

My personal experience with numpy/scipy is that it is very slow for generic
computation (aside from matrix operations) compared to c/c++/fortran, so
I'm not sure it would be good for an efficient fire spread algorithm, with
non-trivial number crunching.

r.los is based is based on the US Fire spread model (BEHAVE), or at least
it was a few years ago (10? 15? Augh!). It is not based on the Canadian
model (FBP).

The two models are significantly different in their parameters, and they
don't model the same things. For what it is worth, the r.los model models
the question "How long will fire take to spread from that other burning
neighbour cell to me?", so it ends up being an event-driven system, not a
time-driven system.

Having said that, it's a good point that looking at that code could be
informative.

I'm personally most interested in taking a page from the model built for
the prometheus project where they did the fire processing in a vector
model, which seems to reduce the nearest neighbour spread issue. They
published a paper on that, but I don't have it to hand. The idea was that
each point in a tiny circle around the start point would have a fire
prediction made, and then the assembled ellipses would be dissolved and the
new fire front would emerge as the collection of unique points on the
outside of the fire.

The topography and fuels are all straight point samples from rasters. The
weather is from a common hourly weather data set.

The advantage of the vector system is that the raster leads to strong pulls
in the direction of the raster grain (usually NS and EW). If you design it
for an 8-neighbour system, there are other effects. You could do a
six-neighbour system with a hexagonal "raster". All of them lead to effects
from the grain of the raster. These effects are exacerbated with a
time-driven system.

Anyway, I'm obviously off on a discussion that has a time and place
elsewhere... :-)

Cheers,
Angus.

Hi Martin

How does one go about distributing an architecture dependent plugin?  I am
expecting to be developing mine for the windows 64-bit environment.  I wont
have the facilities to prepare packages for other environments, but of
course others can take the source code and do what they want.

Can I set up a package that windows 64 users can download and click to
install?  Will I need to set up my own repository for this purpose?

Thx,

Tom

Hi Anita,

The bug I mentioned yesterday is not there anymore in my version. So I 
tried to change the colour as well and it also worked. I used a 
shapefile with a text field (80 char) and entered values like "#f952ea". 
I'll attach is as zip so you can try it too.

The most common way of doing this is to get it into the core distribution
of QGIS but that requires:

* the plugin to have a general usefulness to a wide range of users
* and undertaking that the author will continue to maintain it.

If that is not an option, rolling your own QGIS package with a build of
your plugin is another common way of doing it. See [1] for notes on how to
do that.

The last option would be to prepare a dll / so for each platform you wish
to support and create an installer to copy it into the QGIS plugins
directory.

Tim

You can distribute the python part via the official repository, then
during the plugin start up it could check for the presence of the
binaries - if not found, it would ask the user whether to download the
binaries for their platform (if available) from your website. For
example, Crayfish plugin [1] does that, providing binaries for windows
32-bit / 64-bit.

It is also possible to set up your own repository (a matter of having
one XML file with metadata about the available plugins) and ship
everything packaged - the downside is that users would first need to
manually add your repository to QGIS. With this approach, the downside
is that potential users will not likely discover your plugin (unless
explicitly instructed to add your third-party repository).

Thanks for your feedback! Indeed, the color works with the '#ff0000'  
format but the color functions e.g. color_rgb( 100,255,255) do not work in  
combination with the ellipse renderer. So that's still a bug.

I've reported it here: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9114

I've installed the package I thought installed SIP - and apparently I

You can always do:
sudo apt-get build-dep qgis
Which reads the qgis package for dependencies on an ubuntu/debian system
and installs all the perquisites.

Of course on 13.10 some of these might be older versions, so you can
also add the qgis.org repo briefly to get the updated dependency list
(probably the same).

Then you can always look at the package control files:
https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntugis-unstable/+files/qgis_2.0.1-1%7Eraring1.debian.tar.gz

Alex - thank you!

I saw where he was updating but I wanted to learn a bit more on how all 
of this clicks together. I've got two sore spots - Mr SID and ESRI File 
Based Geodatabases so I decided to do a custom build to see if I could 
get it done and remotely do it in the right order. I learned quite a bit 
on my first go around. I might try it again tonight for kicks.

Thanks again.

Great -- seems like there's a consensus that 4.8 is the way to go.
I've made a pull request which bumps the minimum qt version to 4.8
here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1006

I'll leave it to someone more senior to make the final call and merge this in.

Lucid which still isn't out of LTS has is - although that's probably not that
important.

But OSGeo4W 32bit has 4.7.1.   So that would be the maximum version for me and
there's not much requiring 4.8 in current QGIS.

Ok - https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1007 sets the minimum version
to 4.7. Can we merge that and get the minimum up to 4.7, and then
continue the discussion around 4.8?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Disable Syntax Highlighting in DB Manager
Message-ID: <52926EA7.5090909@gmail.com>

I find the DB Manager SQL window to be unusable, and have confirmed that 
it is because of syntax highlighting by disabling this feature in my 
installation. There is an issue already in the tracker 
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/6995 entitled "db manager's SQL window 
freezes with long query (due to syntax coloring?)". Giuseppe suggests:

 > Pasting or editing such a query makes highlighting process slow here, 
but it doesn't freeze (it could depend on resources available on my 
notebook). I could check the query length, but using a 124190 chars 
query long is something not usual anyway...

This is correct in that QGIS does not completely stop responding, but 
the latency is so high as to make the dialog unusable for anything other 
than pasting in an already tested query. Try, for example, typing 
`SELECT 1;` into the window, and see how long it takes you. I'm running 
QGIS on a Linux Mint 13 laptop with an i7 processor and 8GB RAM, so I 
don't think this has anything to do with system resources.

At the moment, I have altered my local version by commenting out lines 
34 and 56 of 
/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/db_manager/dlg_sql_window.py. I would 
like to suggest that until some time can be invested in making the 
syntax highlighting functionality usable (if there is even interest in 
doing so for a feature that is just eye candy), that this change be 
tested and incorporated in the official version.

Respectfully and with thanks to those who have created and contributed 
to the DB Manager plugin,

I can't repeat the problems doing this... can you post a better test case?

Hi,

I can now say that the slowness problem does not only affects PostGIS layers. It also happens to me with any kind of shapefiles (points, polylines and polygons).

It's an erratic behavior, does not have a regular pattern, and does not always happen. What seems to me is that only happens when I have labels in the project (not necessarily in the layer being edited).

Since, apparently, it is not a behavior that everyone can confirm, may be some plugin that is causing this behavior?

Thanks.

Best regards,
Pedro

 A very long query (>100.000 chars) takes a long time (>10 secs) to be
parsed... linearly.

It highlights it quite immediately, I'm unable to see any latency.
How many time does it take to run on your system?

The syntax highlighting is already usable as it is, nobody else is
experiencing any issue with it... Surely it can be improved, but definitely
it's not just eye candy, as it helps in writing queries.

We may add a check to skip syntax highlighting when the query is very long,
but it won't help in your case.
It's better to add a way to disable it when not needed or whether it cause
any trouble.

Regards.
Giuseppe.

I don't think it's the syntax highlighting that's the issue - I think
it's related to the auto complete function. I regularly see this lag,
and it always occurs for me when the sql window is trying to populate
the autocomplete drop down list. Sometimes it will take 2-3 seconds to
display the list, during which the window is unresponsive.

(This is using the osgeo4w nightly builds with a Postgresql 9.3 server) .

I've created two screencasts [1] of me keying in a 310 character query. 
With syntax highlighting enabled this took 6 minutes, while with 
highlighting disabled it took one-quarter as long (1? minutes). The 
query was a query I had already composed (viewing off camera), so when 
you see the cursor pause that is not me thinking what to type next, that 
is me waiting for the characters buffered to hit the screen so that I 
can continue typing. Please view the videos (Ogg Vorbis format) to see 
what I am talking about.

Occasionally there were typoes (mimicking real life typing). The latency 
introduced by syntax highlighting aggravates typo-ing, because I'm 
usually typing several characters ahead of the display, whereas without 
the latency I see the typoed character right away and backspace to fix it.

My first thought was also that it was code completion (thought it was DB 
round trips), but the second video shows that with highlighting off and 
code completion on, there is no latency.

It seems one person has observed what I'm talking about, and two say 
they don't see the latency. If I may ask those who say they aren't 
experiencing it, is there really no latency, or is it just that waiting 
a few seconds here and there for the characters to catch up to your 
typing is not that big a deal? Obviously, this could be a difference of 
opinion as to what one person considers useful/usable or not useful/not 
usable. And also, "eye candy" was perhaps too strong of a term. Syntax 
highlighting *is* useful, I just find the latency so bad on my 
installation as to make the benefit not worth it.

BTW, I also just now tested on Windows (QGIS 2.0.1 installed with 
OSGeo4W) and found the same behavior. Latency normally, but no latency 
if I disable syntax highlighting.

Would be curious if there is a compromise that could satisfy those of 
who find this to be a problem and those of us who do not have the issue 
and want to retain highlighting. (With, of course, one possible 
compromise being that I just edit dlg_sql_windows.py every time I 
upgrade QGIS.)

Best,

IMHO syntax highlighting and auto completion are two important
features (remember: QGIS is aimed *also* to SQL beginners), not to be
removed. If something is slow (and I agree that sometimes it is), this
must be speeded up, not removed.
Also, adding (yet another) optional switch is confusing, and should be
avoided.
All the best.

Hi Juergen,
wouldn't having two different versions, with possibly different side
effects, make things a bit more complicated? How much work would it be
to bring also 32bit to 4.8?
Thanks.

Message-ID: <52930D1D.5070207@gmx.ch>

Hi,

Although the winter in the northern hemisphere just started, it's time
to think about spring already.

Does anybody have an idea where the next hackfest could be and probably
even started to organize something? I remember, there were a couple of
ideas around, but I am not sure, if any of these was further examined.

I would very much like to go to a place somewhere in the south of Europe
(e.g. Italy, Portugal and Spain coming to my mind) as we have good
chances to already find warmer temperatures there than north of the Alps.

At the end of March, there is the Spanish FOSS4G in Girona, near
Barcelona [1]. Although this is not a conference where everybody will be
going, it might be interesting for some and a possibility to combine the
two events. Victor has a contact in Girona who could be helpful in the
organization of such an event.

Are there other ideas or comments around?

Best,
Matthias

Hi Matthias,

I remember there was discussion about this and if I'm not
wrong there were two locations proposed. One is Girona
and another is Vienna.

Discussions were mainly in PSC list, see

Hi Alex,

Thank you for pointing out, I wasn't aware.

So it seems, that the majority of people who commented so far were in
favor of Vienna. I would love to go to Spain, but the c-tribe sprint in
Vienna sounds like a good reason to go there as well.
One thing to consider is, that the c-tribe sprint offers space for 30
people, and 23 places are already taken according to the wiki page.

Anyway, we should start to organize this, so the participants and the
organizers can keep the dates free and start with preparations.

zero latency. The chars I type are displayed and highlighted immediately.

It would be just a way to disable it when cause issues... instead of
answering
people they has to edit the source code...

Matthias, all,

the venue sponsor of the Vienna code sprint, the city of Vienna, offered
already to extend the space to also suit the QGis community. So no
worries about the mentioned 30 spaces limit.

I think it would be great to have a joint code sprint and I'm looking
forward to welcome you all in Vienna in March ;)

I think (Paolo?) there has already been some informal decision on the
PSC mailing list for Vienna, only we/QGIS did not take further action.
>From Stephan via IRC I understood he and Paolo have communicated about it..

Next friday there is a PSC (irc) meeting, so hopefully we can try to
decide about this, and start an 'organising team'.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Creating a list of reference plugins for learning
	purposes
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7wmqwosc6rPorPthJ7CxqR1EFZXf6wPE2EX88kpfH49eg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am going to start working on additional materials for developers,
but instead of expanding the cookbook or adding more
documentation/tutorials/etc, I have an idea that i would like to share
with you all.

We have a large collection of plugins already, and most of the things
that can be done in a plugin are already implemented somehow in one or
several plugins.The plugins are a great example of how to do things,
but, just like it can be difficult for a user to find one that does
what he wants, it is even harder for a developer to find one that
implements what he is lookign for.

My idea is to take a set of 5-10 plugins that are representative of
what most people what to know, and document them in detail so they can
be used as reference plugins. Also, if these plugins are written with
different sytles, I will homogenize them so they have a common style
and can serve to set some guidelines for developers. In short, create
a set of examples to follow, and from which a developer can learn.

Finally, I would like to tag those plugins or add a list of topics in
a separate document, so you can find what you want easily. Let's say
that you do not know how to create a map tool. You can go to the list
and see which plugin in that set of reference ones implements that.
The same for all other topics that might be relevant.

Links can be also added in the cookbok, so at the end of each section
we can provide a link to the code of a real plugin that uses the
technique that the section describes.

I think this would be very useful, but I would like to know your
opinion. Recommendations of plugins to use as reference ones are also
welcome, since I haven't read the code of all of them...

Cheers, and thanks in advance.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Table joins
Message-ID: <52934C43.6020309@oslandia.com>

Hi all,

I have some questions regarding table joins in QGIS.

Looking at the GUI, there are two locations where such "joins" can
currently be declared :
- through the "Joins" tab of a layer's properties (1:1 join)
- through the "Relations" properties of the project (1:N joins)

Relations are very cool when used in edit mode on a layer (see
http://blog.vitu.ch/10112013-1201/qgis-relations).

But nothing appears in the attribute table, there is no new columns
(which is the case for a "Join" definition), so I guess one cannot use
"related" fields for symbology, labelling, and so on (even with some
assumptions on the relationship, like that is really a 1:1 relationship)

This seems a bit confusing to me, because they seem very closely related
concepts (and well-known concepts in databases), I find strange to have
them defined at two locations.

I did not yet have a look at the code, but are there any chance we can
treat fields of a "relation" as first-class fields in a layer ? The idea
would be to use them to define 1:1 (current "joins") and get rid of
layer's "joins".

We are also asked for the possible addition of spatial joins within
QGIS. I would find it nice to be able to define them as "relations".
Probably starting with a 1:1 "intersects" join, but with an open
possibility for 1:N spatial joins (contains, etc.), and why not free
custom user expressions as join predicates (including "left" and "right"
geometries for instance)

+1 , we should have all relations in the same location. 
Arcgis users are already trained to choose between a join (1:1) or relates
(1:n), we could keep something alike. 
Arcgis shows a dialog to assist user in choosing correctly what kind of
relation he needs. I think this could be a good idea to have something like
this, many users don't understand clearly those concepts.

A join isn't really 1:1, it's also 1:N.
E.g. two tables with buildings and city, where each building is in a 
city but a city can have several buildings. You can easily join the 
city to the building, which will make the city show up in the attribute 
table of several buildings, but it won't work the other way around.

The difference I see personally at the moment is, that a relation is 
sort of a "dynamic" (bi-directional) thing and a join is rather "hard" 
and one-way.

How they are shown in the attribute table should be a users choice. 
Sometimes a relation can just be a value list, so it should rather show 
up as a ValueMap widget instead.
Or it could be that you actually wanted to show an "array of linked 
rows" (show me a list of all the buildings in this city) or some kind 
of group operation on it (max(b), avg(b)) which would be a "calculated 
field"
or as we are used to from the joins "show me the row referenced by the 
foreign key column on this table" (show me the city of this building).

As relational models can get rather complex, just showing related 
records is not always what we want. Sometimes, the related table has 
another relation to another relation and this can get very complex (and 
time-consuming), so I would rather opt to have some switch about which 
relations we should treat as first-class fields of a table.

For the expressions, there should be a syntax introduced for joining 
other tables / resolving relations.

Spatial joins definitely a nice idea, I hope we can get to this one 
day, but I didn't think a lot about it yet.

When it comes to the API I think the joins (outer, inner, left, right) 
is a rather easy call to relation object returning an iterator. What I 
am not sure is about an appropriate UI where the user can define such a 
thing as a join so the attribute table shows the resulting table.

And an entity relationship diagram would be a nice addition as well. I 
was thinking of shared code with the processing modeller, but it seems 
the code is very hard-wired to processing models (and in python) so it 
would be a rewrite of this in the end.

+1

As someone still learning the basics of Python mainly for GIS needs, I think that would be great.
I already looked in some plugins code, but it wasn't easy to understand. A clear explanation will help a lot.

plugin guidelines are much needed since long, so +1 for me.

Hi all.
I'm using heathmaps rather heavily, and I found that they would be far more
convenient (easier to interpret in many contexts) if they could (optionally) be
expressed in % rather than in absolute values. The change seems trivial:
* calculate the maximum
* dividing the raster values by that
* adding an option to choose between abs and %
Any opinion on this? If not, I'll fill a ticket.
All the best, and thanks.

Yes, exactly. The "left" part of the join will always be fixed.

For the aggregate functions, we do not have this kind of things for
regular, "unjoined" tables, so we won't have it for joined tables.

We could stick to the current behaviour of QGIS joins for now : keep
rows of the "left" part and get the first row (or null) of the right
table(s).

You're right. We would have to specify somewhere what relations we would
like to see in a join.

The only issue I see is fields from different tables that may have the
same name. So either we need some kind of "." prefix, or we need a way
to declare a remapping of names.
And this should be applied to the different $geometry fields of the
tables involved in the relation.

Relation properties can be used to define the type of join you want
(left, cross, "qgis old join style", etc.) and the predicate to use (==
by default, or an expression with "intersects()" or whetever you like).

Then in the layer's properties, you could define what relations are
"seen" by this layer, and so what fields are available to the attribute
table.

And then, we could tag the old "Join" functionality obsolete.

I would prefer to leave this choice to the user.

Just thinking out loud, so these are just ideas...

A "." notation would be unambiguous and could be chained over several
intermediate relations.

However, I'm not sure if we want/need to stick to only the defined
relations in the case of expressions. A JOIN x ON y may be suited as
well? So if you want to join something you didn't define (and you maybe
need only once) there is no need to open the relations dialog first.

The predicate sounds like an idea. However, the current solution is
targeted at fully normalized databases with 1:N relations only.
intersects() or > or similar would introduce N:M relations and should be
treated as a different kind of relation (e.g. unlink and link would not
be available there).
Do we always need the relation in the same way? Or should the "type" of
a relation be defined on a per-task basis rather than a project basis?

I somehow like the idea, I would see the remapping of names at the same
position (==> Choose manually which fields you want to have
"hard-joined"). Chaining should also be available here, so fields on a
table C linked via a table B should also be visible on A.
If we do this, the fields should be considered parts of the features, so
I guess if we change a feature on table B which is linked by several
features of table A, layer A should emit appropriate attributeChanged
signals for all the features?
Really interesting this becomes with the N:M relations introduced above
with the predicate. If you change the attribute of a feature on table B,
you have to do an intersect with table A to check for affected features
to emit the appropriate signal.

To be honest, I would like to tag it obsolete. But it seems like a
tricky thing and I don't want to reduce the flexibility of the new
solution or still miss a feature of joins, before tagging the joining
obsolete.

One more thing we need to resolve before we can mark it obsolete is
performance. The joins have been cached, the relations are not. Maybe
there will also be a cache, but for a real database I would like to have
a more sophisticated solution executed on the back-end rather than
trying to solve the issues locally. Again the scenario of a complex
database: you need to keep a local (possibly huge) cache for every table
just for the joins and you will still be slower in joining the data than
a dedicated database server will have the joined data ready.

So my conclusion for the moment is, that with relations we are entering
an area where we need to integrate database backends better, while joins
offer an easy approach to solve a lot of issues. Therefore I would like
to keep the two solutions side-by-side for some releases and wait for
the relations to settle down and declare joins as obsolete, once we are
sure that nobody will miss them.

Message-ID: <CACC8nO5xoRa5n+kP2dXMv20tW_kBPa5v=dLv=x7046DDvJcTxw@mail.gmail.com>

dear developers,
we need to add our custom SRS in qGis2, in order to build the right call to
our WMS with the correct EPSG,
for example:
http://servizigis.regione.emilia-romagna.it/wms/ctr5?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=760705.00661945529282093,931095.61931572866160423,761403.97892956342548132,931660.17387389298528433&CRS=EPSG:202003&WIDTH=988&HEIGHT=798&LAYERS=Ctr5&STYLES=&FORMAT=image/png&DPI=98&MAP_RESOLUTION=98&FORMAT_OPTIONS=dpi:98
until the version 1.8 we added manually in qGis our EPSG:202003
specifications accessing directly to the apps/qgis/resources/srs.db:

-- EPSG:202003
insert into tbl_srs ( srs_id, description,  projection_acronym,
ellipsoid_acronym,  parameters,  srid,  auth_name,  auth_id,  is_geo,
deprecated)
values( 10271, 'Monte Mario / UTMRER - ESRI', 'tmerc', 'intl',
'+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=500053.0 +y_0=-3999820.0
+ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs',  202003, 'EPSG', '202003', 0, 0);

we have done the same in qGis2 but still our EPSG:202003 it is not visible
in the list of available SRS in qGis2.

the question is?
-          how the list of available SRS is created when qGis starts?
-          is it possible to access to that list adding a ?custom? EPSG
specifications ? (note that the qGis ?Custom SR? functionality is not
enough for us, because then the call to WMS would be done with the value of
the parameter CRS=USER:100001 (for example) that it is not accepted by our
WMS server)

of course would be nice that the call to the WMS with a ?Custom SR? with
the ?name? (field ?description? or  fields ?auth_name?+?:?+?auth_id?) of
the SR and not with the ?USER:?+auth_id, as actually is. this would solve
our problem of adding manually our SR in the srs.db.

thanks in advance,
Marica

Hi people,
For me is an inconvenient that Hackfest QGIS and Girona in the same time.
I' going to do a workshop to "IIntroductory Workshop to QGIS 2.0" [1] the
first day in Girona!!!!
I'd like to go to the next spring HackFest QGIS!
Is it posible to change the dates? a days before o after this event in
Girona??
I'm not mind to go to Viena or Girona, but not at once!!

Message-ID: <CAC2XbFfvRZcVt1xu+s2J-8ND+eGugdKZpKuZ-Hxb97urjBsKJg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all (and especially J?rgen)

Following the previous thread [1] about the roadmap, can we set up a
preliminary roadmap for the next release? It seems that J?rgen's
suggestion to do time-based releases every 4 months was widely
accepted, with the combo Feb/Jun/Oct being most popular. So... what
about sticking to the plan and aiming for the next release sometime in
February?

Also, in the previous thread the talk was about 2.2 release. Was that
just a mistake/typo or I have missed something and we are really going
to skip 2.1 and release 2.2 after 2.0.1?

Regards
Martin

Not much response there on actual dates.   I think there were only two people
saying that feb/jun/oct was good - without any objections or other preferences
from others.   The question for the weekday was completely ignored.

So I would say, we release on the 3rd Friday of feb/jun/oct, with a code freeze
starting four weeks earlier.

Week	Date
4	24.01.	Freeze  2.1
8	21.02.	Release 2.2
21	23.05.	Freeze  2.3
25	20.06.	Release 2.4
39	26.09.	Freeze  2.5
43	24.10.	Release 2.6

No, no typo.  We have nightly packages that go under 2.1 already and I'd like
to have the release to have a different version number.  So that'll be 2.2 and
master 2.3 once 2.2 is out and so on.  I don't care much about the actual
numbers, just that they are always increasing (no 1.9.99 back to 1.8 forward to
1.9.0 again).

Hi

It would be great if someone with approval rights could approve the latest version (0.100) of the GarminCustomMap plugin.
The earlier version did not geo-reference the jpgs properly in the kml/kmz, in other words: output from version 0.99 will be useless...

Hi Stefan,

just did. BUT first could not find it, while it is sorted on version
number in the list.

it is because you went from 0.99 to 0.100 == 0.1
So in normal versioning scheme you DOWNgraded your plugin.
So also for the pluginmanager I think your latest version is 0.99

Please version this version as either 0.991 or 0.99.1 or so if you
really want to stay away from the magic one :-)

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <52959C9B.2080302@duif.net>

Hi,

to be able to clean up the Pull Request list, I ask people if anybody
objects to bumping minimum Qt to 4.7

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1007

If I understood correctly, osgeo4w still needs 4.7, so this is the
highest version possible at this moment.

Anybody objects to #1007 ?

If there is not, we will pull (somwhere in the end of the week).

Regards,

Richard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Context help is evil and old
Message-ID: <5295ADE3.4020505@duif.net>

Hi,

while the idea of context help buttons in dialogs is great...

In practice that help is either not available, or outdated or not
translated or (differently) duplicated into the Documentation
(and as a tranlator it is pretty boring to translate all the context
help texts....).

What about unifying all help in the Manual (website). With Sphinx (our
docs are generated with it) it is pretty easy to point to a specific
paragraph in the manual ( right click on the paragraph sign next to the
heading ). Eg the section about loading shapfiles:

http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/supported_data.html#loading-a-shapefile

We could:

1) either just put a link into the context help so a connected user can
jump to the docs website

2) or we could load that page in the QGIS help dialog (in a webkit widget)

3) or (??) we could try to package the docs into the QGIS install and
load the local file inot the QGIS help dialog.

Only 'problem' I see is that we maybe have to write some more
specialized or more general paragraphs in the manual which are suited
for the context help. I'm thinking about for example the description of
all the functions in the field calculator etc. Or in case of the 'Open
Vector Layer Dialog' about a more general paragraph about the loading of
vector data via OGR.

Another example of very different results for the same topic:

The context help for delimited text context help is VERY verbose and
helpfull:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/resources/context_help/QgsDelimitedTextSourceSelect

While compared with the docs, these are rather thin:

http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/general_tools.html?highlight=delimited#add-delimited-text-layer

So my proposal: let's get rid of help TEXT in the context help. Put all
text (and energy) in DOCS and link to them or show them.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I don't see a point in this.  The pull request will just break the lucid builds
without adding anything new (or cleaning out any old code that requires Qt
<4.7).

Ok. Clear. Then we should close the two pull requests with the message:
we want to provide lucid builds untill .... so before that time we will
not upgrade Qt...

BUT: I read that Canonical does not support lucid on the desktop
anymore, but given that we also have QGIS-server, we cannot move until
april 2015 :-(

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ubuntu_releases#Ubuntu_10.04_LTS_.28Lucid_Lynx.29

Same counts for the old Red Hat/RHEL versions.

If companies like redhat and canonical stop upgrading applications
(being desktop or server), should we as a project keep supporting QGIS
with our testing/master version?

People who use RHEL and Canonical LTS are used to older versions of
applications, so in QGIS case, could stay with QGIS2.0?

Sorry for stirring this up again. As a project should take a position on
this, I think?

I agree that this specific Pull Request does not clean up code. But we
can also ask the PR-owner to either do that, or see this PR as the first
step for this.

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi!

As I already wrote in some of my former emails and Richard pointed it
out in his email

DESKTOP support for lucid is already ceased
SERVER support is still valid until mid of 2015

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS

As our packages are not in the "official repository" of these projects
anyway I doubt we MUST take care of that.
Personally I think there is only a minority still using Lucid out there ..

If there is a _good_ reason for pushing QT MIN to 4.8 I would drop
lucid and do it.

kind regards
Werner

Apparently not so clear.  Lucid is not the point.  It that it's just breaking
something w/o achieving anything else.  And that's essentially the only thing
it does.

QGIS currently works with earlier versions.  That (tiny) change could be part
of a larger PR that removes all the old ifdefed code, that will become useless,
once QGIS refuses to be compiled on Qt <4.7 anyway.  Or when something else is
added that requires Qt 4.7 (and which needs some effort to to maintain for Qt
<4.7).

May I ask why this discussion is happening here rather than 
on the pull request page ? I'd feel pretty lonely if I was
the contributor of it... :(

Ok - to add some context to this discussion -- I originally requested
that we bump the dependency to 4.6 to get access to
QGraphicsItem::rotation() and QGraphicsItem::setRotation(). I need
these to fix composer item rotation. It's a bit of a code cleanup, but
mostly a feature win in that using those methods I can add rotation to
all types of composer items. It's 98% of the way there in these
commits:
https://github.com/nyalldawson/QGIS/commit/bd92774ea7ea5ed50a4fad9c83f45540125d61e0
https://github.com/nyalldawson/QGIS/commit/f05dceb4bd63ca786aa36c0a60a8302567854889

Pull request 1007 is basically a prerequisite to finishing this work.
If there's no chance of getting the minimum to 4.6 then I'll have to
abandon this branch. That's why I'm hoping to get 1007 pulled before
spending too much more time on a feature which currently is impossible
to merge to master.

Early in this thread there was overwhelming support for setting the
minimum to 4.8 - that's why request 1006 was opened. 1006 can probably
be closed now since 4.8 looks unlikely.

Because I thought this was the appropriate audience. I can myself start
 discussion on the PR page, but then the most important devs are not
aware of it.

Also because I thought this was a typical/principal question.

For me this discussion was helpfull. I will point the PR-owner to this
thread (actually I already commented there that I would ask the lists)

Hi Richard,

this topic was discussed several times, last discussion was
initiated by me about month ago [0].

I completely agree with you, we should drop context help and
move all texts into docs. This help us to keep context help
updated and translated.

agreed: let's reduce duplication.
in this case, I would distribute the html manual along with the
application, and point the context help to the relevant page.
before dropping the context help, please documenters check that all
the content is also present in the manual (e.g. I have found the
description of Heatmap plugin quite good in the CH, unsure if it's
also on the manual).
Thanks.

Hi again

And Thanks for approving and the hint with the version number.

I was not aware that the loogics change from 0.99 to 0.100.
I shall keep that in mind for the future...

I thought I make it 1.0 (and non experimental) when people out there confirm the plugin works properly on their (probably different systems)...

Cheers
Stefan

Hi Stefan,

just did. BUT first could not find it, while it is sorted on version number in the list.

it is because you went from 0.99 to 0.100 == 0.1 So in normal versioning scheme you DOWNgraded your plugin.
So also for the pluginmanager I think your latest version is 0.99

Please version this version as either 0.991 or 0.99.1 or so if you really want to stay away from the magic one :-)

Hi guys,
trying to customize the qgis toolbar and menu I found something weird 
(maybe a bug)

  * saving the customization, you have to add manually the .ini suffix
    to the file, otherwise you are not able to load it
  * there are some problem with the customization of the menu: e.g.
    after removing "geoprocessing" and "geometry" from the Vector menu,
    when qg restarts they are are still enabled. Same issue for the
    others menu

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Projection of ESPG/ESRI
Message-ID: <52964067.5010103@northrivergeographic.com>

So this question was going to be epic and confusing - and I just figured 
it out. I also Cross posted this to the developers list - so excuse the 
duplication.

I have a user who sent me  data in Georgia West State Plane NAD83 Feet. 
In QGIS this comes up as a custom projection so I decided to define it. 
According to QGIS I ended up with two EPSG choices - EPSG 102667 and 
EPSG 2240. So this lead to some back and forth on my part mostly because 
I was working tired. I searched the EPSG database and there is no 
102667. This led to some head banging on my part.

I searched http://spatialreference.org/ref/?search=Georgia+West+ and 
102667 is defined as an ESRI projection. Except in QGIS it comes up as 
EPSG. Can this be fixed - can it be referenced as ESRI as opposed to EPSG?

Also - it seems when I pull data without a projection it inherits EPSG 
4326 (WGS84) - is there a way in QGIS to pull in data with no 
projection? In some cases we have to figure it out - so it coming in as 
undefined is more helpful than inheriting an incorrect projection.

Anyway - Happy Thanksgiving for those of you who fall in that geographic 
social area.

I think that's a minor semantics issue, it's common knowledge that EPSG
code's over 10,000 are not actually official EPSG. But I'm not sure that
the label is stored in the db. Will have to look into that. More a
request to the developers list than here. And then of course I wonder if
we'll get in trouble for using the term ESRI without a trademark note.
Technically yes those projections come from the ESRI definitions, but
I'd guess that someone outside ESRI actually converted them to proj strings.

Just leave Projection on the fly off (the default). That will give you
the behavior of a naive coordinate system and a chance to figure out and
define the correct coordinate system.

Awesome - OK - I didn't know project on the fly would assign a 
projection. I usually leave it off - All the data needs to be in one 
projection anyway.

I should have known about the EPSG thing - I was too wrapped up in the 
data. I think having it as something other than EPSG would be better and 
probably would help some - but you are right the name ESRI would most 
likely kick up a stink of some sort.

I appreciate it.

We also have IGNF: projection definitions, so why not giving ESRI the 
appropriate reference? They did not invent them, just gave the number.
Referencing to EPSG for projections that they did not publish is not 
better either.

I guess it comes from GDAL or PROJ4 after all. They have tables called 
ESRI with the extra definitions.

Message-ID: <2C5F82DA3EE3E449BD473075F2C290BF976E9509@NINSRV05.nina.no>

Hi again

I just reversioned the GarminCustomMap plugin to 1.0, removed the experimental flag and uploaded the new version to the repository.
If somebody with approval rights would be so kind to approve...
It should now work properly with QGIS 2.0.
In case of issues: the plugin has a bugtracker (http://hub.qgis.org/projects/garmincustommap/issues)...

Cheers
Stefan

Regarding last emails from J?rgen and Nyall, is this is a sufficient 
reason to bump to 4.7?

I don't what is worth my opinion, but +1 for me.

I believe we should reach a decision soon???

 I found out the reason but I cannot fix it.
I think that the problem is related to the fact that all the function in
the Vector and in the Raster menu are provided by ftools and gdal. I looked
in the .ini file and under the Vector and Raster menu there are no entries
that describe neither ftools function and gdal ones.
For example, under the Vector menu, there are only a few lines:

Menus\mVectorMenu=true
Menus\mVectorMenu\menuOpenStreetMap=true
Menus\mVectorMenu\menuOpenStreetMap\mActionOSMDownload=true
Menus\mVectorMenu\menuOpenStreetMap\mActionOSMExport=true
Menus\mVectorMenu\menuOpenStreetMap\mActionOSMImport=true


Same for the Raster menu.
And so I think it is not possible to customize the menu (unless you want to
unselect all the functions).
Is there a way to edit manually the .ini file?

Thanks in advance

Matteo

Message-ID: <529725DB.9010302@gmx.ch>

Hi,

I just tried out the search engine http://www.ixquick.com and entered qgis

Top search result is a project page on the famous sourceforge service:
http://qgis.sourceforge.net

Maybe some get nostalgic (look at that cute favicon).

Despite the emotions, I would recommend, that this page gets redirected
to the current project page, as ixquick says it is still found by yahoo
and gigablast.

The page http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgis/ states that this is
"Brought to you by: gsherman, timlinux".

Thank you in advance,
Matthias

Hi!

>From what I can see (and I agree there with Juergen) only bumping the
version does not make much sense without deleting the
ifdef QT_VERSION ( < = 4.6) in the cpp source code.
Because after bumping the version these lines would not make much
sense anymore ..

I don't know if this can be done somehow in an automatically way.
(and unfortunately I am not a cpp dev - but if anyone explains how to
do it I'll try it)

from everything else ..
+1 for 4.7

regards
Werner

Message-ID: <52975A58.9000409@gmail.com>

Hi Marco,

I found time to test QGIS-Server master on gdb.

I'm testing GetCapabilities, and QGIS-Server segfaults after sending the 
document.
</WMS_Capabilities>
[Thread 0x7fffc6b49700 (LWP 1477) exited]
[Thread 0x7fffc73d7700 (LWP 1475) exited]
[Thread 0x7fffc7bd8700 (LWP 1474) exited]

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007ffff4029cdb in malloc_consolidate (
     av=av at entry=0x7ffff436c740 <main_arena>) at malloc.c:4094
4094    malloc.c: Aucun fichier ou dossier de ce type.

If the segfault arriving before the client receiving all the document, 
the connexion is closed and the document is incomplet.

The GetCapabilities request is not the only one to generate a segfault.

Do you have an idea ?

Ren?-Luc D'Hont

Message-ID: <1385651490.34353.YahooMailNeo@web28901.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hi, I would know objections in order to change some shortcut keys in QGIS desktop.

+ Delete selected features in map canvas -> DEL key without ask for confirmation.
? ?Now QGIS ask for confirmation first.
? ?Other GIS app desktops, Arcmap, gvSIG.... use DEL key.

+ Delete selected features in attribute table -> DEL key without ask for confirmation.
? ?Now QGIS uses Ctrl+D shortcut and ask for confirmation first.
? ?Other GIS app desktops, Arcmap, gvSIG.... use DEL key.?

+ Remove selected node of a feature -> 'backspace' key without ask for confirmation.
? ?Now QGIS uses DEL key, and similarly?'backspace' already deletes a node when drawing a feature.
??
+ Remove layer from legend -> Ctrl+D with ask for confirmation.
? ?Now QGIS does not ask for confirmation.

Our purpose is to standardize these keys and avoid unnecessary and continuous confirmation messages in an edit session (You can easily undo the removal using the UNDO option menu or Ctrl+Z shortcut).


You can see the current discussion in:

Thank you very much!

Hi,

I think the confirmation messages are mainly from a time where there was
no undo possibility available. Assuming that the undo works properly I
am ok that the confirmation message is suppressed.

Alternatively we could ask for confirmation if there is more than one
feature deleted.

Regarding backspace and delete: ArcMap has an easy situation as it only
supports Windows where there is always a del-key. We have to support
multiple platforms. Some keyboards (e.g. Macintosh) do not provide a del
key - on those keyboards the del-key has to be emulated with
fn-backspace which is not very efficient and can't be triggered with one
hand.

+1 for the additional confirmation when removing one or more layers -
because there is no undo for that! If there were an undo I would not mind.

Thank you for bringing up this issues - wonder what the other users
think - esp. the OSX users.

Andreas

Hi Andreas, thanks for your comments.

I think that the edition (delete features) is much more agile without many and repetitive messages boxex. In principle UNDO tool works fine.

There is a pull request with these changes:

We could also ask for confirmation the first time and then let the user
flag a "Stop asking for confirmation", or something like that...

What about leaving the possibibility to remove the layer without confirmation 
with a separate shortcut? 

Actually the first what I do after a fresh install is changing "Ctrl-D" to 
simple "D", as I couldn't imagine myself using two fingers for such basic 
action like layer removing ;)) The same with a dozen of other Ctrl-* 
shortcuts. And I believe I'm not the only one.

I already got a similar behaviour and I tried to fix it anywhere in
QgsGeometry class one year ago (see d8ca9193b1)... but maybe I miss
some cases or something was changed from that date.

GeosGeometry and WKBGeometry are not synced, that's it.

Try to call polygon.convertToMultiType() multiple times without
exportToWkt().
I'm quite sure you will get false all the times.

File a ticket, please.
Cheers.

Given that adding/removing a complex layer can be expensive and there is no
undo I would suggest to have a single key shortcut (D) with confirm and a
modified one without (Ctrl-D).  You want to avoid the user doing something
dangerous and in this case that is removing a layer layer without undo.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] featureAdded(QgsFeatureId) signal
Message-ID: <CAHXrU-Kqe0ZO7wfjUo+4GcVRUuv35gR1vsBJxo-V0gUbcz-psw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs

Within a plugin, I need to make some kind of geometric topological
manipulation on every feature as soon as it is added to the layer by
the user.

My best guess was to use the featureAdded(QgsFeatureId) signal and to
modify the geometry within it.
Unluckily it looks like the geometry is effectively updated only when
the edits are saved by the user. In that case the featureAdded is
emitted again and it works correctly.

Workflow:
* the user add a feature within an edit session
* the featureAdded signal is emitted a first time, the qgsfId is
negative, the changeGeometryValues results to True but nothing happens
* the user save the edits
* the featureAdded signal is emitted a second time, the qgsfId is now
positive, the feature having been stored, changeGeometryValues results
to True and the geometry is effectively updated

Is there a way to implement what I need (having the feature's geometry
modified just the first time the signal is emitted)?

Here is the stub code I am using:

QObject.connect(self.mylayer, SIGNAL("featureAdded(QgsFeatureId)"),
self.featureAdded)

def featureAdded(self, qgsfId):
        request=QgsFeatureRequest()
        request.setFilterFid(qgsfId)
        feat = self.mylayer.getFeatures(request).next()
        .... (some more code here)
        self.mylayer.beginEditCommand("Feature manipulation")
        self.mylayer.dataProvider().changeGeometryValues({ feat.id() :
newgeom })
        self.mylayer.endEditCommand()
        self.canvas.refresh()

thanks in advance

I have the same problem, see the bug report (closed as invalid) and add any
information

It is somehow related to the gdal build, because if I used libgdal-dev from
ubuntugis my qgis build is ok.

I agree with Nathan.

I think that 'D' should ask confirmation, we can imagine the reaction of a user removing accidentaly a configured layer.?

'Ctrl+D' could remove layers without confirmation.

Hi, it is a good idea, we can wait other opinions.

Please don't understand me wrong - I don't insist to use single-key shortcuts 
by default. We had them in early versions and we decided to drop them, so it 
wouldn't make much sense to mess with them again. Personally I miss them, but 
It's no problem for me to change them.

I only refered to the singe-key shortcut in order to underline the importance 
of this action and protest against removing the non-confirmation option 
completely ;) IMHO, it would be a painful regression. But it's no problem for 
me if it's not connected to any key by default.

Instead of a confirmation when deleting a layer, an Undo-action for  
already deleted layers would be much more helpful.
Cause you can happily confirm to delete sth, but figure out you were wrong  
just a minute later ...

Cheers

Hi Ren?-Luc

I don't have a segfault with GetCapabilities here. Maybe it happens not 
with all projects?

Hi Paolo,

In your code you update the geometry in the provider.
You should not do this since the feature is not there yet, it's still in 
the edit session (edit buffer).

There is two ways to do this: either work totally in the buffer or 
totally in the provider.
There is an agreement that working in the provider in plugins should be 
avoided. Moreover, if I understand correctly your workflow working with 
the buffer seems more appropriate.

Then, you should use
layer.changeGeometry(fid, geom) instead of 
layer.dataProvider().changeGeometries(...)

Hope it helps a bit,

Cheers,

Denis

I'm using the libgdal-dev from ubuntugis.

I'm testing QGIS under valgrind but I don't find where it comes from.

Hi Marco,

This is an unstable but constant bug.

If I QGIS-Server accessing 2 layers, I have the bug. If I accessing 1 
layer, I don't have the bug.
It is unstable because it's not always the same bug. Sometimes it's a 
'corrupted double-linked list' like when I close QGIS Desktop, the other 
times is a malloc.

I would like to debug QGIS-Server with valgrind but I'm not able to find 
the line which malloc.
Herre it's my make config :
sudo ccmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/***/***/***/build 
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug -DENABLE_TESTS=True -DWITH_MAPSERVER=True ..

How do you do it ?

Ren?-Luc

"Save to file" is using standard dialog with "Automatically select
filename extension (.ini)". For me it works as expected, i.e. adds
".ini" suffix to file.

Customization only works for objects with objectName. objectName is
automatically set by Qt for objects created in designer (compiled from
.ui). For objects created programmatically it has to be set. I have
added object names to fTools in d334b46, but they have to be added in
all plugins.

Recommendation for plugin authors: when you are adding QMenu or
QAction, always set its object name, e.g.:
   myMenu = QMenu('My menu")
   myMenu.setObjectName("myMenu")

Thanks Denis
that was, now it works perfectly :)
and yes, working in the buffer is more appropriate, as I want to
manage the user edits within a standard QGIS edit session.
I should have read more carefully the documentation.

I know the same problem from my desktop QGIS as well. The problem seems 
to be, that when exiting qgis and doing the cleanup it's trying to 
delete a QString that has been already been cleaned up and deleted 
before. Unfortunately I was not able to track it down yet. It looks 
like we have several of these "segfault on close" issues.

Thanks Matthias,

I'm arriving at the same conclusion...

I thought that it's when QGIS clean up layers and providers.

It seems there are at least two opposite approaches in the TOC usage. When you 
do any kind of data processing, you have billions of intermediate layers you 
have to remove one by one, and it doesn't hurt you if you remove too much, as 
you don't care about their style. Furthermore, then you have to remove them 
all from disk and it also isn't especially dangerous if you only use 
reasonable versioning and backups. Also I guess every admin spending her/his 
days on browsing and fixing countless layers from her/his users might agree 
with me.

But you're right, I didn't consider your point of view, and seems that one is 
definitely more popular. For the non-confirmation variant, I can see two 
solutions:

1. We already have a number of actions without default shortcut. Maybe we 
could create an action that is neither placed in any menu/toolbar nor assigned 
to any shortcut by default. Just waiting to be connected to a custom shortcut 
if anybody wants it.

2. If we don't want to make such "orphan" actions, let's drop it. I'll write a 
supersimple plugin for adding non-standard actions and release it if anyone 
interested.

I think this recommendation should be added to plugin guidelines
Voctor mentioned recently.
Victor, should I open a ticket on the documentation, not to forget
about this?
All the best.

By default, I would prefer that single "normal" keys (letters and number)
would be used only to swap between tools. Anything that implies changings
the project (adding, removing, duplicating,... layers\features\nodes...)
would use other keys (del, backspace, ...) or a combination with
"Ctrl\Shift\alt"+, with or without confirmation.

Why? Because it's quite easy for a user to think he is typing somewhere,
and by mistake he is altering something that he might not even notice.

There are sometimes that the confirmation is also informative ("Delete 5
features?"), if the confirmation is removed, this info should pass to
non-blocking message.

Ok - so what's the final call here? Is someone willing to make a final
decision between bumping to 4.6 and keeping support for lucid or
bumping to 4.7 and dropping lucid? (Looks like 4.8 is out of the
question at the moment).

If someone can make a call I'll update the pull request and make sure
all #ifdef's for versions < 4.6/4.7 are removed.

(For anyone new to this thread, this change is being driven by the
need to access the QGraphicsItem::rotation()/setRotation() methods
which were added in qt 4.6).

Hi Nyall,

if I am correct, I think the general view of devs is that a bump to 4.7
only is not worth to pull without:

1) a cleanup of stuff that is not needed anymore because of the change
2) a (good) purpose on why to do it

one of the devs told me: "why not a good PR with
1) the bump
2) the cleanup
3) the new stuff

I think this whole discussion is because of different ideas about this
kind of pull requests between different people.

@psc maybe we should write down this kind of things in governance?

@nyall is a PR like above doable for you?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all.
Any hope of having this merged? I think it would be a pity to wait too
long, thus adding possible conflicts.
All the best.

Hey Paolo,

It looks OK to me I just haven't had time unfortunately to commit to
reviewing it completely for a merge.  The code is at
https://github.com/tecoholic/Quantum-GIS/tree/gsoc13 and
https://github.com/tecoholic/qgis-django/wiki/Symbols.

Sorry I didn't have time to commit fully to this.

Thanks a lot Nathan for this. Anyone else could help us here?
It seems a reasonably easy, yet important, task.

For me upgrading to 4.7 is a +0 - I still use QGIS on 12.04 systems and I
suspect that others do too. However 14.04 is just around the corner so it
wont be hard to wait an extra few months before running QGIS 2.2.

What about being more aggressive and actually porting to Qt5? Its been out
for a while now and should represent a stable target for us to develop
against.

Regards

Tim

I will be giving the django stuff a once over as I redeploy the plugins
registry on the new server. It would be great if others can review it too.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Nearest Neighbor List and Vector Layer Selection
Message-ID: <1385843272787-5092015.post@n6.nabble.com>

I was using Python Spatial Index and select from a vector layer using the
result from nearest neighbor (list) and get error messages saying it does
not recognized the list. I see in the API the input to the select 

QList< QgsFeatureId > QgsSpatialIndex::nearestNeighbor ( QgsPoint  	point,
int  	neighbors ) 

and the vector select allows input of feature Id's but the documentation is
very scantily covered to give what the python representation might be

void QgsVectorLayer::select 	( 	const QgsFeatureIds &  	featureIds	) 	

The format for the  QgsFeatureIds is typedef QSet<QgsFeatureId>
QgsFeatureIds

How can I coerce this magical transformation using soemthing similar in
Python (may be a Set) ? I tried making a Python Set but Vector layer Select
refuses to accept it. 

How do I transform QList to QSet<QgsFeatureId> in Python?

Thank you,

I am using VS Express 2008 but I think the issue is very similar to any
version. If you compile look at the compile error messages, it must not be
able to compile the QGIS_Core library file. It is the glue that holds all
the important base tools. Some dependency may have been missing for the
compiling to be missing. 

You must also remember rebuild all to make sure QGIS_Core is rebuilt on your
machine and not take the one you downloaded from the source. It may be
present from the source system but it may not be recognized on you machine
since the signature is from a different machine. It may be wise to clean the
build and recompile everything again.

Maaza,

Are you using QGIS 2.0?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGis 2.0.1 Compile error on QGIS_Core
Message-ID: <1385860632849-5092023.post@n6.nabble.com>

I got this error message while compiling QGIS 2.0.1 from Master 

1>Generating qgsexpressionparser.cpp
1>C:\GnuWin32\bin\bison.exe: m4: No such file or directory
1>Project : error PRJ0019: A tool returned an error code from "Generating

1>qgis_core - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)
========== Rebuild All: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 skipped ==========

I do have the Bison executable and I think it is not able to find the
expression parser source I am not sure what is missing here.

I am using VC express 2008 and CMake 2.8.

Thank you for your help,
