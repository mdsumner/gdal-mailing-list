I think I just had a "Eye-opener" moment. While I have been thinking about
reducing the modal dialogs and decoupling things, I think somewhere along
the line I forgot almost entirely about the usability. After reading the
above feedback, I realize, Symbology suite will have to provide tools that
would allow live experimentation and editing. It should be something like
the toolbar of a graphics editor.

Nathan, the link was really an eye opener.

I think I will stick with the decoupling, but
  - make the editing affair a Dockable Widget, that would render the
changes on-the-fly or on request in the main canvas itself.
  - Have icons in the dock to perform actions like symbols editing
activities and symbol management (say a import button to add the remote
symbol repository)
  - Effectively utilize the single clicks, double clicks and the
Right-click context menus on the symbols in legend to perform legend item
specific tasks rather than to layer properties. Layer properties can be
called by double-clicking on the layer itself anyway.

So its about two things, one a whole new dockable widget that would allow
all the customization things like creating symbols, and the second is
adding power to the legend to apply any symbol at any state, or even change
the renderer for the entire layer.

Now that the entire symbology editing is brought out as a dock which will
let you perform all the editing, saving of symbols live on your map, I
think going somewhere just once to summon that dock won't be much of a
turn-off :)

Hi!

SEXTANTE is still marked as experimental and not stable - so you 
probably have to enable the experimental plugins ..

The repository should be automatically added when you hit the "add 3rd 
party repositorys" button..

Please keep in mind that live experimentation is not feasible with bigger
datasets because rendering takes too long (especially on old/slow
hardware). So don't rely on it too much. There has to be a good alternative.

Hi list,

Another thing that would be great for symbology would be the ability to
define symbology properties taken from layer columns, so that for the same
layer, feature "A" can have svgA.svg, feature "B" have "svgB.svg", or
decide which columns set the svg size, color, transparency, rotation, etc.
For now, in 1.8, we can only set rotation and size with the "advanced" list.

This would be a great feature which will help a lot to add some dynamic
symbology.

Michael

Nathan, if I understand correctly, your mockup is for labelling, but you
say we could use exactly the same kind for symbology ?. If so, I proposed
in my previous post the "Data defined settings" tab for symbology, which
will list all the properties wich can be configured this way.
The icon idea is a good one too, and could make the "Data defined settings"
useless if all the settings can use it.It will require more efforts as you
will have to change the ui so that each control can be turned off and on
again depending of the database icon state, but this will be a great
enhancement. No more 2 different dialogs to set the same property

Yes the goal would be to use it across the board anywhere this kind of data
binding happens, so labelling or symbology.  I only used labelling for an
example because I had that ready for a couple of months ago.

 It will require more efforts as you will have to change the ui so that
> each control can be turned off and on again depending of the database icon

Yeah that is the downside, that it would require a little more and smarter
code, but I think the user experience would be better.  Having two places
to define the same property is a bit confusing, especially if you set the
property in the data define area but then can't understand why the setting
you have in the normal section isn't working when you change it.

Just some of my thoughts anyway.

Hello  all,

Here is a update to the discussion. I have posted a few mockups here <
http://www.arunmozhi.in/2012/04/a-qgis-symbology-dock-mockup/ > that will
give a idea of the new UI that I propose. This wouldn't make it completely
modal-less however.

For some situations like a Line symbol using SVG marker, there will be a
modal dialog at least to select the SVG symbol. But most cases can be
handled with just these two tabs.

Considering Anita's warning, the rendering will be made as on-demand using
the "Apply style" button or we can include a checkbox for the on-the-fly
rendering.

The mock-up is just to give a rough idea, it can discussed and refined.

I can confirm Noli's experience. With 1.7.4 there is no new plugin repo
link, regardless of adding 3rd party repos (on Mac). I thought this was as
per noted at [0].

I was guessing that it wouldn't be available until 1.8 due to work still
being done on the new repo. I have had to manually add the link to the new
repo, which I have only found on the page noted, to all Mac installs of
1.7.x I manage. The link to the new repo is not noted at
plugins.qgis.org(seems like it should be main page and initial plugin
listing page).

Is this expected experience until 1.8?

Yes the 'new repo' is only available by default in QGIS  versions >
1.7.x. Older versions need to manually add the new repo.

JFYI,

AttributeError: 'QLineEdit' object has no attribute 'setPlaceholderText'

setPlaceholderText was introduced in Qt 4.7.

QT_MIN_VERSION  in QGIS is 4.4.0.

A couple of general thoughts after reviewing your mockups and also
from discussions we had in the Lisbon Hackfest:

- the mockups look really great! I'm not sure if the dock approach
makes sense for me but I'll watch from the sidelines to see how
discussion on that goes.
- in the tree, each node should have a small preview icon for that
node. So for example if a node is a symbol layer, it would just show
that simple line or whatever. If the node is a symbol, it should show
the composited result of the symbol layers beneath it. If the node is
an aggregate symbol, is should show the composited result of the
symbols beneath it.
- Assuming a tree that works this way:

  - Class Symbol
   - Aggregate symbol
     - Symbol
     - Symbol
       - Symbol Layer
       - Symbol layer

The tree could also include nesting:

  - Class Symbol
   - Aggregate symbol
     - Symbol
     - Symbol
       - Symbol Layer
       - Symbol layer
   - Aggregate symbol
     - Symbol
     - Symbol
       - Symbol Layer
       - Symbol layer

 or even

  - Class Symbol
   - Aggregate symbol
      - Aggregate symbol
         - Symbol
         - Symbol
           - Symbol Layer
           - Symbol layer
    - Symbol
       - Symbol Layer
       - Symbol layer
   - Aggregate symbol
     - Symbol
     - Symbol
       - Symbol Layer
       - Symbol layer

- The gui we had envisaged in Lisbon would provide a tree and to the
right of it would be a widget which would update based on the context
of the node you are on.
- I am not sure if we discussed it in Lisbon, but I also envisaged
drag and drop support where to the right of the tree you could have
your symbol library and you could drag any symbols into the tree, so
adding additional symbols to create aggregate symbols etc.
- There should be a big emphasis on re-usable, custom Qt widgets (see
for example the projection selector dialog) that would be used at a
low level (e.g. colour button) and at a higher level (e.g. simple line
style widget). The idea being that developers could easily use any of
these components in their custom plugins / apps and always receive
improvements to the underlying widgets (e.g. when database binding
support gets added for a property). With that in mind it might be nice
to desconstruct your ideas down into 'what are the widgets we need to
create' as well as looking at the high level gui ideas as you have
mocked up.

Hi all,

Just wondering, would the RC be let out as source only, or also compiled for various platforms?

thanks,

I have also recalled the GUI brainstorm from Lisbon hackfest - I have
put together a quick mockup to explain what we designed one year ago.
The image is attached. Please note that this one dialog should replace
the recursive series of symbol selector + symbol properties dialogs.
The idea is that there would be just one dialog for setting symbol
properties that dynamically updates its content depending on the
selection within the symbol tree.

I will comment on other ideas/proposals later.

Cheers
Martin

Agreed, I think this will be a major improvement in many respects.

Thanks Radim

That means that some distributions of QGIS might have a QT version
lower that 4.7? The one I am using works fine, so i gues is > 4.7. Is
there any way of checking it on the fly, so I can execute that line
only if the version is recent enough?

Thanks in advance

Ok, I will do it. Gary suggested numbering version as 1.0.1,
1.0.2...eventually reaching a stable 1.1, and that is a good idea. I
have a few small fixed to finish and I will publish a new one.

Thanks for your collaboration and suggestions!

Hi Victor

in Python you can use 'hasattr' builtin function:
edit = QLineEdit()
if hasattr(edit, 'setPlaceholderText'): edit.setPlaceholderText('foo')

Hi Victor,

you can use qVersion() macro to get Qt version. Something like
this

minQtVersion = '4.6.0'

def initGui(self):
    if qVersion() < minQtVersion:
      QMessageBox.warning( self.iface.mainWindow(), "Error", "Your message")
      self.loadingCanceled = True
      return None

 def unload(self):
    if self.loadingCanceled:
      return

Hi Alex

there may be a problem with above code. Imagine that PyQt4 is built
with e.g. Qt 4.2 - that means that it will provide only methods
available in Qt 4.2 and below. If the user updates Qt version to 4.8,
the new methods and classes will not be available in PyQt4, however
qVersion() will return '4.8.0'. There is also PYQT_VERSION_STR
variable in PyQt4.QtCore that returns the version of Qt used to build
PyQt.

Hi,

This question just appeared on gis.stackexchange again. Can anyone explain
why GML and KML cannot be edited? It would be good to be able to explain why
it doesn't work.

Best wishes,

Hi Anita,

state of the "Toggle Editing" button depends on provider (driver) capabilities.
It enabled only when driver has ChangeAttributeValues capability and don't
rely on DeleteFeatures or AddFeatures capabilities.

With this approach many OGR formats that support adding or removing
features but don't allow editing existing features are not editable.

Message-ID: <618F7164-B407-485D-A61B-2F197C6B1C09@kyngchaos.com>

I've been debating whether to make a fuss about it, and I think I will.

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3999

As stated in the bug report, my workaround fix only partially works.  


Even so, it's not really an OS X problem - it's more of a conceptual problem: PROVIDERS AND PLUGINS ARE NOT SHARED LIBRARIES.  It just becomes a problem on OS X because it is enforced by the system dynamic loader.  The solution is not OS X specific, so we don't need to sit around waiting for a Mac developer to fix it. (I'm not a C++ programmer, I just know enough to tinker and cause trouble ;)

Even though I don't use GRASS in QGIS, I'd hate to see a 1.8 release with partially working GRASS support.

although this is not a OSX problem we also can't forget the GRASS
plugin works on the quite all the platforms except OSX.

We have 3 alternative options: 1. refactoring the provider+plugin
code at all, 2. choosing to drop it, 3. just keep it as it is.

The third option is the easier way, the current one. Even though it
not solve the problem it requires no additional effort.

The first option requires enough work. I tried to separate the grass
plugin and it's provider while I was in Zurich for the HF in
November, but the editing part of the grass plugin uses a lot of
methods defined in the provider so I threw in the towel.

The second one instead can be done with just few changes, but
IMHO it's mindless to drop it without any good reason,
furthermore considering it works on the other platforms.

I understand your point of view, but if OSX users agree the plugin
is useful they should also consider to sponsor the fix.

What broke the plugin in the first place? It appears to be working fine in
1.7.4.

Hi,
Using QGIS 1.9 I've rendered one third of the Alps with 15 different
zoom levels as a hobby project (and serve the world at work on QGIS
server with a simpler symbology). See links and what I've learned from
this below.

Here would be my wish-list should we want to compete with open renderers
like Mapnik and Osmarender:

- Better (point) displacement plugin and/or rules on how to manage
overlapping symbols (ignore some symbols). For an example of what is
wrong, see here:
http://www.outdoormaps.org/simple_map.htm?zoom=15&lat=46.10527&lon=7.07953&layers=B0


- Manage z-index (show bridges above roads above tunnels above...). (I
proposed a quite simple implementation.)

Here one example where Mapnik gives good results but my (qgis-made)
outdoormaps fails:
http://www.outdoormaps.org/map.htm?zoom=16&lat=45.72481&lon=8.62683&layers=0FFTTTTF

It's a road over a railway over a road. Picture below:
http://fr.structurae.de/photos/index.cfm?JS=170534

OpenStreetMap statistics show that this (and more tricky) examples are
common.

- if/else / priority of rules functionality (as it was in 1.7.4 or with
other implementation)

I have detailed most of those in the thread below:
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.qgis.devel/17094

Other note: For the "sample dataset" function the user can simply load a
simple dataset and experiment with it, then save the styles and apply
them in another project. I worked with a sample area on an old machine
then applied it to the world (OSM) with success. For average and fast
machines, then the postgis indexes do the workas long as you do not zoom
out too much so live experimentation with OSM world dataset is possible
with QGIS.

Mayeul

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS Dev Lib plugin idea
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-G+MkFV=qSn67trZ2gZKj0ZPcRhYZY0uhu9HXHQuKZqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have an idea that I am not sure has been discussed before:

How about a core, or install-able, plugin that consists of reusable
Python functions and subclass-able PyQt widgets?

I envision this plugin containing community-submitted functions and
classes that any Python plugin dev can call or instantiate from their
plugin. This would help plugin devs from reinventing the wheel for
many common tasks, offer reusable custom or common widgets, and
possibly standardize some user interface widgets across plugins.

Here are some plugin components that might be in such a dev lib:

* Syntax-highlighted text editor

* Syntax-highlighted SQL, regex, etc. edting widgets

* Tree widget class that collects and displays all legend layers (with
filtering)

* Any other custom widget that could be made PyQt subclass-able (QGIS
browser, etc.?)

* Common routines for editing/importing/exporting layers or their features

* Routines for interacting with the PyQGIS console, logging, etc.

* Any routine, portable package, or widget that is stable, helpful to
other plugin devs, and/or just plain reduces code redundancy

This is similar to the snippets section of plugin.qgis.org, but
embedded in QGIS and importable into plugins, like the qgis.utils
module or like calling a method of an installed plugin (e.g.
sys.modules[plugin_package_name].method() ). Might be most helpful to
have the plugin dev lib package referenced to a single object by
qgis.utils module, similar to 'iface' (maybe 'devlib'?). Then...

self.editor = qgis.utils.devlib.text_editors.TextEditor(file_path, parent=self)

... would yield a complete text editor widget with loaded file.

Running the lib plugin directly might yield a gui, listing available
functions and classes with their docstrings displayed, showing a
plugin dev the API to available components (generated by Sphinx).

Submitting code to such a dev lib plugin should have some oversight,
like submitting to the official plugin repository. All submitted code
might be required to have a supplied unit test (or at least a doctest)
and translatable strings. There should probably be noted minimum QGIS,
Python, PyQt or Qt versions and imported modules required to use the
code.

Part of the dev lib might also include common icons and other
resources as importable modules. Maybe useful for standardizing icons,
etc.

Any opinions on this idea? Any suggestions on a preferred implementation?

Message-ID: <CAEP=zx8OFi0i6PUXnGR2AvA589_E-33u-TY+PmXgS1a5um_x4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm creating a qgis python plugin.  One of the functions of the plugin is
to customize the qgis interface by turning off a few toolbars.  For most
toolbars, this isn't a problem, but for some reason I can't find a way to
shut off the "Label" toolbar.  For most toolbars, the following statements
are working...

self.iface.digitizeToolBar().setVisible(False)

But I can't find a labelToolBar() object that I can do this operation with.
 Does anyone have any guidance on why this is different?  I'm not noticing
any plugins that might be influencing this...  Thanks!

Aaron

Sorry for rush! Uninstalling the pug-in, closing QGIS and reopening QGIS 
dismiss the error.

Seems there is no method in the QgisInterface class for accessing the
new label toolbar yet.

Try...

    iface.mainWindow().findChild(QToolBar,"mLabelToolBar").setVisible(False)

I found the object name for the label toolbar using:

    toolbars = iface.mainWindow().findChildren(QToolBar)

    for toolbar in toolbars:
        print toolbar.objectName()

Which returned this on my QGIS setup:

    mFileToolBar mLayerToolBar mDigitizeToolBar
mAdvancedDigitizeToolBar mMapNavToolBar mAttributesToolBar
mPluginToolBar mHelpToolBar mRasterToolBar mLabelToolBar OpenStreetMap


There's probably a more direct solution than the 'findChild()' method.

Hi all,

There is an "advanced" button in the single symbol mode (layer style)

Is this a missing feature or is there a specific reason?

I believe that could be fixed relatively easy. The GRASS provider code
could be all moved to the existing shared library qgisgrass and only
provider identification and loading functions would be kept there.
(But currently I have no time to try it)

To me it seems that qgis_gui library would be the best fit for such
classes since it is supposed to be a library of reusable GUI stuff.
But I understand that for many people c++ is not an option.

You could try to start such a project - create a dev lib plugin,
create a repository, add some useful widgets... soon you should see if
there is interest or not. Obviously requiring another plugin will be a
burden, so another possibility would be that the dev lib would be a
python package inside a plugin (that would demo the functionality) and
other developers would just copy the whole package to their plugins
(or just some bits from it).

Such dev lib could work also as an incubator for widgets - some
widgets that prove to be useful may be picked by core team and ported
to qgis_gui library (with python bindings).

Is there a way to reach the QgisApplication reference from a python plugin?
The iface object is exposed by the application object, but afaik it doesn't
expose it.
I need to control some aspects of the application lifecycle, but I fear the
plugin system is designed to not allow it...

 Hi,

 It turned out that our student could not commit. He has a 40% position 
 and it seems that GSoc requires a full commitment.

 This student is nevertheless still interested in working with QGIS and 
 will continue to work on QGIS globe, but outside of GSoc.

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7w02t3JRgtndSiB8H=G39krf+o0q9bcpmF3tRRG4V_-mg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am trying to get statistics from a raster layer, using the
bandStatistics() method. I get the statistics object, but it seems
that it hasn't been initialized. According to the documentation,
calling this method should compute the statistics (it warns against
using it often, since that calculation takes time), but it seems it is
not doing it. Am I doing anything wrong? any suggestion? I haven't
found any other method to force the calculation of stats, but just one
hasStatistics to check if they have already been computed.

Regards

Victor

Hi Giovanni.

If you want to get some information from QgisApplication, just type like 
"QgsApplication.showSettings()".
But I'm not sure you can control some aspects of the application....

Yes, the static methods let me access informations, but now I'm quite dure
(having searched the source code) that the application instance is kept
"hided" to plugins, probably to avoid interferences (especially from bugous
plugins!).

 Hi,

 Shouldn't the Oracle driver work for both versions? I would assume so, 
 but I may be wrong ... To me (not an oracle specialist) it seems like 
 this is only a licensing difference?

 Thanks for clarifying,
 Andreas

A new GDAL version was uploaded to ubuntugis-unstable (only lucid and oneiric),
which doesn't trigger automatic rebuilds or notifications.  But apparently QGIS
needs a rebuild to work...

I've just copied the packages to ubuntugis-stable.  The builds are pending...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Extending SEXTANTE algorithms in QGIS (a new
	plugin/example)
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zmq05WuQ80swuCQoLus5cGYFw_XOi00Mm=yjG0CoYcbg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

As some people mentioned, is important to incorporate more algorithms
into SEXTANTE to make it become some kind of standarized geoanalysis
platform within QGIS. For this reason, I have added a small plugin
named SEXTANTE Example Provider, which is a plugin with a single
algorithm provider that "plugs" one algorithm to SEXTANTE. It should
serve as an example for all who are interested in developing new
algorithms based on SEXTANTE. The code is fully commented to explain
each thing that is done.

One of the main goals of SEXTANTE is to make it as easy as possible to
develop spatial analysis algorithms and make them available within a
GIS, and I guess this example show pretty well how easy that is. I
hope it encourages other users and developers to add new algorithms
and to use SEXTANTE as their base platform for that.

The plugin requires the latest version of SEXTANTE with some recent
changes made to include this pluggable architecture, which I have just
uploaded, so please update in case you want to use it. Also, GRASS
algorithms are now available, though it is rather unstable and I have
to polish algorithm descriptions, but at least those of you who are
curious about it can have a first look at it (although is likely not
to be really usable yet).

Regards

Victor

AFAICS the only thing that is missing[1] in Locator the provider would actually
directly use is SDO_GEOM.RELATE.   But that would only be necessary to
determine exact window intersections and that can also be done with GEOS after
fetching a bit more with SDO_FILTER.

Well, the hourly requirements are indicative, but it is recommended to
consider GSoC as the primary occupation for the summer. Of course some
vacation and other occupations are fine, as long as they don't block
progress in the SoC project. 

That said, best of luck to all students and mentors! More proposals are
welcome. I suggest to submit the application as soon as it is readable,
in order to allow comments from mentors, and to avoid problems due to 
last-minute Melange overload :)

best,
Anne

Hi all.
Concerning the potential inclusion of Marco resampling code, or other, 
I'm not so much worried about introducing potential bugs, but about 
testing thoroughly for it. Latest releases contained several serious 
bugs, and I think we should avoid this.
May I ask not releasing 1.8 until it has undergone serious testing, and 
no crucial bug is still alive? Of course we'll always have normal bugs, 
but we should agree on what is crucial, and what not.
All the best.

With this sample I can confirm. Also I have same problem
with this data when try to add new fields containing coordinates
using FieldCalculator.

Hi!

To my knowledge there will be at least 1 rc release ..
And Giovanni said something about thoroughly testing with a team - but
we agreed to have a short meeting about a to-be-built testing team on
the HF.
So I guess the next release will surely be tested with live data (and
not only with prepared data that surely works).
There is no fixed date of 1.8 release until yet and the HF is in
between. I am sure 1.8 will not be released before HF ..
I am looking forward to the testing team meeting in lyon ;)

only a few days left ..
kind regards
Werner

I see your point here. There are some good reusable widgets in the
qgis_gui library I have not used yet in my plugins.

A Python dev library/plugin package would allow for plugin developers
to import pre-designed classes/widgets, which might not be so useful
for the QGIS dev community on a whole (i.e. not 'worth' the effort of
porting to the base C++ libs), but very useful for the 5-10 developers
who do import it. Kind of like a Python virtual environment where pip
has been used to install a diverse set of Python packages for a
particular purpose: to help other Python plugin developers.

Yes, starting this as a separate plugin seems like the right first
step. It's not ideal to to have users install a requisite plugin to
use another plugin, but this is how shared libs work (e.g. linux
package manager). May be best as a regular plugin, especially if it
significantly grows, since the plugin installer already handles
updates.

Running the dev plugin, in addition to listing the widgets, etc.,
might also demo them, as you suggested. The copy/paste function might
be a good fit for some widgets/routines, and could be a fallback
choice for all, especially useful for devs who don't want to import
from another plugin.

Maybe 'Widget/Snippet Library' is a better name for such a plugin. It
could also have a section where it pulls down the current, un-vetted
snippets listed at plugins.qgis.org.

Yes, this makes a lot of sense. Anything heavily reused by plugin
developers points towards something possibly worth porting to the base
libs. This could be ascertained now, with an audit of existing plugin
code. Redundant patterns of plugin development may not be apparent to
most developers, unless they have written several plugins.

Ciao Paolo,
I did some test to figure out the issue!

The error occurs when the SHP is 3D MultiPoint as in your attached file.
If you convert SHP geometries from 3DMultiPoint to Point, the
calculation of the coordinates works fine!

Hope this helps!

could this also be due to 3d point?

I received this from a forum user:

"I have seen that this forum is closing and I'm wondering where conversations unrelated to questions and answers will go to now? i.e. experiences in using QGIS, directions for development, resources being developed to support QGIS, training events, etc. "

Your thoughts are appreciated.

Response is inline, basically I think all of those are covered by the 
other tools. In some cases I think the Wiki could do an even better job 
by allowing for more organization and interlinking of topics, of course 
a wiki overall/update wouldn't hurt to kickstart that.

Only thing that users might want is a lower volume announce list? Maybe 
limited to release announcements, plugin announcements and event 
announcements? Read-only perhaps, to push conversation over to the other 
lists.

I just realized there's a QGIS-edu list...

i.e.

* experiences in using QGIS - Blogs (On QGIS website?), QGIS-user 
Mailing list, Qgis Wiki (case studies)
* directions for development - Qgis-developer mailing list, Qgis Wiki
* resources being developed to support QGIS - Qgis-user mailing list, 
Qgis Wiki, Plugins site
* training events, etc. - Qgis-user mailing list, Qgis Wiki

The problem is solved changing:

at [...]/sextante/ftools/FixedDistanceBuffer.py [12]

At first sight It could be a problem with the overloaded _builtin_import

Don't the mailing lists cover all that? I know email is old school but
it works and at least we are not making people use usenet...

There is also stackexchange...

good point, gis.stackexchange is seriously changing the game.
I have seen a lot of users, including power users, moving from forum
and mailing list to it.
Now on a total of 7.294 questions there are 418 tagged as QGIS, not
bad at all considering that 1.164 are tagged as ArcGIS and that the
Esri Discussion forum is consistently migrating to it

First of all thank you for the mockups. It is much easier to discuss
GUI ideas with mockups...

Here are my comments:
- I would avoid using two tabs (Library+Editor) and have everything in
one form. Have you seen the mockup I have posted earlier? It is
supposed to integrate the current "symbol selector" dialog and "symbol
properties" dialog and I believe it could be embedded into that dock
widget - to save work and to provide common GUI for users. The dock
widget could work in this way: whenever the user selects a symbol in
legend, the preview would be shown together with general symbol
properties, list of symbol layers and list+tree to pick an existing
symbol from style. When any symbol layer is chosen, symbol properties
should be shown instead.
- style tree with symbol groups and symbols: to me it seems better to
have a tree just listing the hierarchy of groups and a separate list
view with large icons for picking symbols from currently selected
group. You can expect that there may be lots of symbols in groups and
you need a larger preview than the one which would fit into the
preview column.
- the dock widget for symbol properties could be more general - for
example, it would show renderer settings when a vector layer is
selected, or even appearance settings for raster layers (when
selected).
- you mention that for some cases there should be a modal dialog -
e.g. for selection of SVG symbols. It would be good to avoid that -
each symbol layer has a defined widget for setting its properties,
having to define one widget for "big" dialog and another one for dock
widget would be unfortunate. I would suggest to use a dock widget that
can be docked to bottom part of the main window, using more space (and
no tabs!) and therefore diminishing the problems with lack of space.

The deadline for student applications is this Friday! I would like to
urge you to start preparing the application on GSoC website [1]. You
can start now - it is possible to keep updating the application until
the deadline. Mentors from other OSGeo projects may also give you
valuable comments. Write a great proposal, get accepted and have fun
in summer! :-)

Hi Giovanni,

I reinstalled the plugin and follow your statement and it worked! Thanks!

Still could not find on the "options and settings" where to put the path to the SAGA folder and SAGA tools are not working probably because of that.

I would like to stress this point. The deadline is a hard limit.

Hi all.
I think now it's time to be more careful about QGIS licences. It's the second time
that the long awaited Debian package gets rejected, because of problems in licensing.
E.g. the PROVENANCE file is not up to date.
I understand DD can help spotting specific problems.
Thanks.

I recall there is the following question in the students application 
template:

'Do you understand this is a serious commitment, equivalent to a 
full-time paid summer internship or summer job?'

I was waiting for the comments from Martin as he has indicated in his
previous mail, he would comment on the mockups later. My proposal is in the
final stages and would upload it anytime soon.
Thank you.

any problem (besides the logistic one, of obtaining it from all old devs) in moving

exactly, but if you really want gsoc and another position, you just have to
see that you can work more than 8h a day and maybe partly on weekends. And
i think that a student is normally used to this.

I think it depends on the student-mentor willingness to do it. If the
student is quite enthusiastic and the mentor is actively helping him I
think it is not a problem to have another partial position.

Last year, my brother (student) and I (mentor) were in a similar
situation for gvSIG and had no big issues with this.

At some point it is necessary to elaborate a planning. I think that's
the critical point to know if one is able to meet the requirements.

Regards.

mmm, it's curious. There were no changes to the code since yesterday
evening.
I would like to know what was wrong...
Anyway, it works ;)

I used mainly that file to point possible issues. But it appears largely not
sufficient and obsoleted. Having a look to single files all together is a
time consuming activity.

That's what I thought. Paolo didn't say that you did or where.  The rejection
notice was all I knew about.

FYI

-------- Messaggio originale --------
Hello all,

time is getting short for students applications, and we only have few
proposals so far.

Students, please prepare with your mentors the first draft of the
proposal and submit it on Melange as soon as possible. I'd suggest to
avoid last minute submissions, as the site will be presumably
overloaded!

Proposals can be edited until the deadline, April 6th 19:00 UTC so in
about 2 days, 11 hours from now.

You can use the date command to get the deadline for your timezone:

  date --date='TZ="UTC" 19:00 next Fri'

or open the Melange homepage, where there is a countdown.

Also, we hope that Geoserver, Mapserver, OSSIM...  will participate
this year. Let me know if there are any issues with applications and
registration.

Looking forward to see many good proposals!

Anne

Jonathan,

Spot on (British?), Bull eye (American), Das Stimmt / Genau (German)
on your observation on first port of call for new users who are use to
non FOSS software for forum support.

I wonder why I don't like forums :-), not a member of QGIS forum.

That was the aim of my latest changes to http://qgis.org/
Have you seen them yet? I added big buttons that lead to the support
channels.

Hi,

SEXTANTE incorporates Raster (r.*)  and Vector (v.*) components from 
GRASS. What about Images (i.*), e.g., i.pca, i.cca, i.fft etc.?

Thank You for the great plug-in!

Thanks for the comment

The list of available algorithms is not comprehensive at all. Even
some of the algorithms currently included have to be improved, and I
am manually editing the descriptions. The idea is to include as many
algorithms as possible, of course, and I am working on it right now.
So, in short, i.* algorithms will be there in the final version :)

And, again, GRASS algorithms are still at an early stage, so they are
likely to be rather unstable...

Thanks for all the pointers. I fixed the typos and put the "manual" button
on the community page too.

Should we just have the same buttons for the other language versions?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster resampler branch
Message-ID: <4F7C597C.8030103@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs / power users

Today, I've uploaded a lot of changes to the raster_resampler branch on 
github ( https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/tree/raster_resampler ).
Compared to the previous version (which already provided resampling 
capabilities and code refactoring into raster renderer classes), there 
is now quite a lot of GUI refactoring. The style tab of the raster 
properties dialog now contains an embedded renderer dialog for the 
current renderer type (similar to how it is in the vector props. 
dialog). Furthermore, it is now possible to dynamically add new raster 
renderers and corresponding dialogs.

I'm interested in feedback and like to discuss the raster changes also 
in Lyon. The user interface could be improved for sure and there will 
most likely be some new bugs. If you find one, please fill a ticket and 
assign it to me.
Note that the branch also has a number of advantages:
- Raster look much nicer with resampling
- The raster banding issue when printing transparent layers is solved
- Fixes problem with raster transparency band that was not saved in master
- Efficiency has been improved for some common cases (e.g. faster lookup 
when rendering paletted rasters)
- It is now easier to make changes in the raster layer class since most 
of the symbology and rendering related code is moved out of QgsRasterLayer.

The next thing I'm planning to make in the branch is to add project file 
transformations. The new xml format is different than the old one, so 
old symbology settings won't load properly from project file right now.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Victor,

Installed and trying out SEXTANTE for the first time today. Very well done!

Unfortunately, on Mac 10.7.3 , I couldn't get any algorithms to load
in the modeler on double-click (inputs add fine).

I saw that bug just today. It comes from a quick modification I made a
couple of days ago following some advice given here in the list

I you want to fix it manually, edit the
"/Users/larrys/.qgis/python/plugins/sextante/modeler/ModelerParametersDialog.py"
file
an change line 262 from

     if hasattr(self.item, 'setPlaceholderText'):

to

     if hasattr(item, 'setPlaceholderText'):

Basically removing "self."

Sorry for this

Hi,
I realise the gui code would be pretty much rewritten, but do you think it would it be worth adding a first step to review and apply any existing patches for missing functionality? e.g.

Hi

in general your proposal looks good. My suggestions:
1. support for hierarchies (symbol groups) in style should be done
first, so that non-recursive GUI in next step can immediately count
with usage of hierarchies.
2. regarding legend functionality - I would prefer to keep the legend
interaction to a bare minimum necessary for non-modal symbol editing
in dock widget. The reasons are mainly technical: a) mapping the
operations in legend to renderers may be difficult; b) legend widget
code as of now is not in the best shape, pending refactoring to
model/view approach etc. There are other things that would welcome
some usability improvements, e.g. a) add support for color ramps
defined by a palette (list of colors) - currently only hardcoded
ColorBrewer palettes are supported; b) faster/simpler color selection
- instead of showing a big color dialog, it would be better to have
just a small popup with color triangle or with commonly used colors -
color dialog would be an advanced option; c) poor man's sharing of
symbols: user enters an URL, its content would be downloaded and
imported to style; d) anything else :-)

Martin

Right now, I think you would need to bring the question or request
directly to the OSGeo board. In the future the responsibility of at
least initial review of requests will likely be the marketing committee.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] enabling the overview map
Message-ID: <CAEP=zx-Euk9ShtbOuXOZs0=k3Xf7sgwvObkKxwA9A6iL6PXt-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,  I'm creating a plugin that modifies the qgis interface defaults
when it's installed.  One of the things I'm trying to do is turn on the
overview map by default.  I haven't found a way to do it yet.  I could only
get as close as...

self.iface.mapCanvas().enableOverviewMode(QgsMapOverviewCanvas(None,
self.iface.mapCanvas()))

This ends up crashing qgis altogether.  I'm guessing it has something to do
with the fact that I have no reference to the existing overview map object,
and trying to create a new one is bad news.  Any insight you could provide
on the best way to accomplish such things (and where in the api I can look
for answers like this) would be much appreciated.  Thanks!

Aaron

Hello Martin,

Since you said the legend code isn't in good shape, I have modified
the proposal to include, rewriting the lost functionalities such as
line and fill customization of symbols and Creating a API and
specification for easy sharing of symbols via remote repositories.

However I am a bit lost, how would we put the dockable symbology
widget to good use without mapping functionality from legend to symbol
dock?

No matter how much people rave about git, I still find it more difficult than svn.

So, my local release-1_8 branch refuses to merge and I can't backport my install doc updates from master.  I think I successfully did a reset, but trying to push my commit gives a error about a non-fast-forward updates.

Can someone backport bd916b1 and 2a126af to release-1_8 for me while I straighten out my local copy (and get some sleep first)?

Hi,

Thanks all for your work on the proposal.

One thing to keep in mind is that the interface should also work on
mobile devices (phones, tablets). On mobile devices the dock approach
may not work because there is not enough screen space for both the map
and the symbology dock.

Just to keep in mind that there should be an alternative for those devices.

Now I understand that one would primarily style maps on a PC and not so
much on a mobile device but one should also be able to modify styles on
a mobile device.

Thanks for considering this as well.

Andreas

I think the overview object is already created on project load (if the
project has one).

If you are looking to just show/hide it's dock widget, try...

    overview = iface.mainWindow().findChild(QDockWidget, "Overview")
    if overview:
        overview.show()  # or hide(), etc.

The following should get your local release tree back into line with
upstream (main git repo) release-1_8

git checkout release-1_8
git fetch upstream
git reset --hard upstream/release-1_8
git rebase upstream/release-1_8

now to get your commits over from master just use cherry pick:

git cherry-pick bd916b1
git cherry-pick 2a126af

To keep your local up to date just do:

git pull --rebase upstream release-1_8

then

git push upstream release-1_8

After a hard reset, the local branch _will be exactly the same_ as the
remote branch. After this, a rebase is pointless as there are no commits
unique to the local branch that can be replayed on top of the remote.

True.  Ignore the rebase in that part; I was thinking to far ahead.

Mapping from legend item to a symbol should be quite simple to do. I
meant that the advanced stuff (from the arcgis idea) like reordering
of symbols, changing renderer type, change of classification attribute
etc would be better avoided, keeping just the simple functionality:
user clicks a symbol in legend -> symbology dock widget will show the
symbol (and allow modifications)

Hi Andreas

defining symbology on a phone/tablet could be done also traditional
way in vector layer properties dialog.

 Hi Martin,

 Ah I see - the new work is not replacing the current existing way of 
 defining symbology?

 Thanks for the clarification,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Quick switch symbology styles
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR80sD-EA8wE6Cervnu9qFat=-hh0UU8GZPyi086KA48kg@mail.gmail.com>

Often when defining whole layer styles, I find one rule set of units and
dimensions (usually in mm) works well for general work on a screen and
output via server, but high quality, denser output to print requires a
different set, relative to expected output scale (where I often use map
units). This is an example of needing to quickly switch layer styles,
possibly across a whole project.

How about a means to quickly switch between stored, named styles for a
layer?

There could be named style store and load gui functions in the layer
properties dialog. Loading/Saving a .qml file, for example, could offer to
add a named style to the layer, prompting for a name. Load and/or Store
once, then quickly switch between those saved named styles in future use of
the project. A 'Stored Styles' submenu of the contextual menu for a
selected layer in the legend could offer a quick switch between stored
named styles.

On a project level, there could be a submenu of uniquely used named styles,
across the project's layers, to switch between. Then a looping function
could switch all layers with a linked stored style of the chosen name in
one operation, for example to 'Print' or 'OSM'. (Sure would beat
import/exporting for many layers.)

I see with the QgsMapLayer saveNamedStyle() and loadNamedStyle() already do
the saving/loading bit, via a URI to the user's personal qgis.db or a .qml
file. Storing of the named layer styles and their URIs could be in the
project file. Named styles could be multi-linked at the layer level and
stored at the project level, making them available to all layers of similar
kind.

Is this just crazy talk? Or something that has already been discussed?

Tim,

The board has prepared guidelines on how to decide on sponsorships for
sprints and hackathons.  I think the latest version is at:

   http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Code_Sprint_Guidelines

The guidelines, as I recall them, tend to lean towards multi-project
sprints.

If you wish to request funding, I'd suggestion you prepare a fairly
specific request for the board.  Try to get it on the board agenda - you
might want to contact Arnulf who normally chairs or perhaps Michael as
secretary or just add it yourself if you see when the agenda becomes
available in the wiki.  Getting at least one advocate on the board
would be helpful.  Attending the board meeting at which it is discussed
(in irc) would be prudent.

Board meetings are roughly monthly and the board isn't always good at
jumping on informal one time requests.

Best regards,
--

Thanks for this Frank (and for the background info). We have probably
missed the boat on this one given that the HF is next week, but we can
try our luck for the next QGIS meeting.

 Hi,

 Thats a good point. Probably we should introduce media styles, just 
 like CSS does for websites. We could have print, screen - maybe mobile?

 I also have the issue that font-sizes for screen need to be different 
 from font-sizes on print. But for this purpose a global scale factor for 
 all fonts usually works fine.

 I think this discussion is quite useful and could lead to some useful 
 functionality - esp. if you target multiple media.

I am using QGIS Master on Windows 7 64bit. 

Whenever I add a new layer to the map QGIS zooms to the extent of all
layers in the map. This can be very slow when using layers with lots of
data in them.

Also, if I select all of the layers in the layer control and untick
them, not all of them untick. It seems to untick different layers each
time I do it but not all of them.

Can anyone else reproduce?

Yes, checking/unchecking works unpredictable :(

No it is not supposed to be a replacement. It should be another option

Marco,

Is there a reason the addItemsFromXML() method is commented out in the SIP
bindings.

Hi

Yes, that was the reason. It needs conversion code for the map.

Nathan: are you using that function in a plugin?

Yes I was hoping to use it in a script outside QGIS, in a custom Python app
using QGIS as a mapping platform.

The plan is to:


   1. Load QGIS via QgsApplication
   2. Open composition
   3. Print composition to .png
   4. Use .png in other app

The other app is a service that run on the computer in the background and
generates maps for search requests that come in, so I can't really use a
QGIS plugn because it has to be automated and run in the background.

That's basically what I tried to do, but without the upstream (I'm not working on a fork, so I figure I don't need that).  adding 'upstream' gives other errors.  But the errors point to the solution: change upstream to origin.

phwew! back to normal operation.

I do not know QtLinguist, will give a look for sure before the HF.

I have created a (very basic) Sphinx project infrastructure, with support for
Internationalization. I have also migrated a couple of .tex files to .rst,
and tested the infrastructure with Italian .po files.
You can find everything here [1]: you can easily build the solution by
running the ./build.sh script and access to the EN and IT version, both
builded under _build/html.
Or you can check it online [2], but just the EN (master) version, as RTD
does not support internationalization at this time.

By the way, I have been using your qgis-theme from the Governance
project, and will send you a pull request with some slight modifications for
supporting the .rst rules I have been used (actually only rendered with
the html builder, need to figure out how to get the same with pdf).

Will give a look at this.

Checklist of things to do for me, before and during the HF in Lyon:

* solve problems with .pdf output
* using Intersphinx to tie various QGIS documentation projects
(basically the CookBook and the Governance project at this time, I am
not aware of other ones)
* giving a try to pootle
* giving a try to QtLinguist
* testing Sphinx for context help
* consolidate editor workflows (both with gettext or with tools like
gtranslator and pootle)
* create an ad-hoc python script for migrating latex doc to .rst (I
have already some idea, in this respect)
* migrate the documentation
* consolidate the build script (build.sh) and use it live on QGIS site
for putting the whole thing in production

let me know your ideas and give me some feedback, thanks :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] geometry with geography type column not displayed
Message-ID: <1333656800.28340.21.camel@localhost>

Hi,
I created the following table in PostGIS:

CREATE TABLE test.geogQGIS(gid serial,geog geography(Point,4326));

INSERT INTO test.geogQGIS (geog) VALUES
(st_geographyFromText('SRID=4326;Point(-110 30)'));

ALTER TABLE test.geogQGIS ADD CONSTRAINT gid_pk PRIMARY KEY(gid);

but I can not see the table in QGIS! it is loaded but not displayed!

While, if I create a geography column as PointZ, in column "Type" of
PostGIS provider, I see "Detecting...." grayed-out and can do nothing!


QGIS version: master

Anyone confirms?

All the best

I've done a bit of testing with this it seems to be working well. Some comments:

- the user interface needs to be sorted out for the symbology tab -
the load button sits too far from the min/max controls. Ultimatelye I
think we need to completely rethink the style ui - maybe using a
property list would be better....
- Some of the settings are not intuitive - its not obvious how you
return to the default behaviour for the large/small scale combos
- Its also not obvious what the threshold is where the large kicks in
over the small scale resampling approach
- the number spin box - its not obvious what it is for

Other than those issues it was working well for me though I still need
to test it with some of my larger datasets.

Yes that would be good!

Ok - please pull again from teh governance theme as I integrated some
of the features from my company private theme. In particular styles
for :kbd: :menu-selection:, ..notes:: etc. There are still lots more
of these needed to provide the range of options we have in the LaTeX
docs but I think most things will be possible in the html verison
anyway.

Yes to start with at least I think we should support / document a few
different ways for translators to work so we can find which is
preferred.

Currently it is updated every 20 min. Unfortunately I don't have any
server which could be dedicated to it permanently. If anybody can
offer a free server, I can migrate it.

Great job Radim, thanks a lot!
What are the requirements for the server?
Can we host it on one of the qgis machines?
All the best.

This is probably a side effect of my recent legend bugfix. I'm going to 
look at it.

It wasn't related to those fixes. Nevertheless, the first issue is fixed 
in 30eaf192e731aeaa74780123ada445bfda971737. I cannot reproduce the 
second one (didn't try on Win yet).

	calculation inside QgsDistanceArea
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=ytmwaqMc=xB1NYrij-4eNjWehdPYNbWxce6c8viq_oPg@mail.gmail.com>

In Qgis the semi-minor axis of the ellipsoid is calculated [1] with:

b = a - (f/a)

where
b = semi-minor axis
a = semi-majot axis
f = inverse flattening

while it should be:

b = a - (a/f)

In Qgis the WGS84 semi-minor axis is 6378136,xxx
while it should be 6356752.xxx

This causes wrong distance calculations on ellipsoid as reported here:

To get comparable results, the benchmark must be run on a computer
with no or little other load (Linux kernel counts process switching
overhead in process time) and CPU parameters must not change
frequently (all the data collected are relative).

The requirement would be a dedicated time (1-2h per day should be
sufficient) on a server with 2 CPU/cores (the second for database in
case of db providers).

Just so that you know: All the nightly builds on qgis.org currently take about
~9h to complete - from 4am PDT to around 1am PDT (or 1am to 10am CEST;
nice(1)ed and using ccache).

Message-ID: <4434CCE4-1148-445C-B080-ECFE6CC8DA76@geoapt.com>

Currently there is a plugin sitting in the approval queue that is written entirely in French. I have not approved it because I don't know what it does and find it difficult to review the code (yes, I know about Google translate).

Should we require English as the base language for plugins and follow that with i18ln support for translators? 

Otherwise, someone who speaks French will have to review the plugin and approve it. 

The approval process should require code review to make sure it doesn't have external requirements that are not documented and doesn't make suspect system calls.

Hi Tim

Thanks for looking at the branch. I agree that the ui should be improved 
and I appreciate help in this regard. Hope we can work on the ui design 
(and on other issues in the raster branch) in Lyon.

 >- Its also not obvious what the threshold is where the large kicks in
 >over the small scale resampling approach

The treshold is the zoom level where one screen pixel equals a source 
raster pixel (the zoom level applied with the 'zoom to best resolution' 
function).

>- the number spin box - its not obvious what it is for

It is the maximum oversampling ration for the average resampler (afaik UMN has the same parameter). Depending on the zoom-level, the average resampler pulls data in higher resolution than on screen (depending on raster source resolution). A value of 2 e.g. ensures the resampler does not pull more than 4 times the screen resolution when zooming out.



Regards,
Marco

Ah ok good to know - also something we should make understandable for
users and probably hide away in an advanced section.

I think this is a module conflict with the new SEXTANTE plugin. I got the
same error when trying to install mmqgis, only *after* I had SEXTANTE
installed. SEXTANTE's mmqgis module was already loaded and does not have an
__init.py__ file with the PyQGIS classFactory function, etc.

Since the plugin installer (and the qgis.util module) function off of what
has been imported into sys.modules to load a plugin, the SEXTANTE module
fails to load as an independent plugin. I think maybe one of the plugins
should renamed.

I noticed the duplicate module problem when my Plugin Editor plugin refused
to navigate to the mmqgis install directory, showing the mmqgis dir of
SEXTANTE instead.

There is also another error with the mmqgis plugin[0]. I'll contact Michael
Minn about this as well.

So, it may be better to have a dedicated virtual server for this?

BTW: can we have an overview of the "qgis servers"? How many, which 
services, who is root on which? I think if we need additional resources 
(as this thread implies), we can plan for a consolidation & upgrade, and 
search ad hoc funding for this.
Thanks.

Are there more servers than the qgis.org vm?

This is the type of info that needs to go in the QGIS -Governance
docs. But due to all the consolidation work there is only now:

- qgis.org server hosted by OSGEO
- android.qgis.org hosting donated by me

Gary and I used to run much of the project infrastructure on our own
servers but that has pretty much all been rationalised to the servers
above now. Possibly we could ask OSGEO for another vm if needed. We
could also build benchmarks on my server, but it wouldnt be a zero
load environment as Radim suggested.

Hi

Top posting here to pick up the original thread:

Radim you mentioned QPixmap vs QImage. I was looking at why one of the
unit tests is doing wierd rendering today and happened to read this:

"Performance

QPainter is a rich framework that allows developers to do a great
variety of graphical operations, such as gradients, composition modes
and vector graphics. And QPainter can do this across a variety of
different hardware and software stacks. Naturally the underlying
combination of hardware and software has some implications for
performance, and ensuring that every single operation is fast in
combination with all the various combinations of composition modes,
brushes, clipping, transformation, etc, is close to an impossible task
because of the number of permutations. As a compromise we have
selected a subset of the QPainter API and backends, where performance
is guaranteed to be as good as we can sensibly get it for the given
combination of hardware and software.

The backends we focus on as high-performance engines are:

Raster - This backend implements all rendering in pure software and is
always used to render into QImages. For optimal performance only use
the format types QImage::Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied,
QImage::Format_RGB32 or QImage::Format_RGB16. Any other format,
including QImage::Format_ARGB32, has significantly worse performance.
This engine is also used by default on Windows and on QWS. It can be
used as default graphics system on any OS/hardware/software
combination by passing -graphicssystem raster on the command line
OpenGL 2.0 (ES) - This backend is the primary backend for hardware
accelerated graphics. It can be run on desktop machines and embedded
devices supporting the OpenGL 2.0 or OpenGL/ES 2.0 specification. This
includes most graphics chips produced in the last couple of years. The
engine can be enabled by using QPainter onto a QGLWidget or by passing
-graphicssystem opengl on the command line when the underlying system
supports it.
OpenVG - This backend implements the Khronos standard for 2D and
Vector Graphics. It is primarily for embedded devices with hardware
support for OpenVG. The engine can be enabled by passing
-graphicssystem openvg on the command line when the underlying system
supports it."

Currently we are using:

gui/qgsmapcanvasmap.cpp:  mImage = QImage( size, QImage::Format_RGB32 )

Which is good as far as using the Raster backend, but maybe there will
be some performance gain from using opengl where the processing can be
done on the graphics card?

Regards

Tim

Thanks Tim for clarifying. Does this include the osgeo4w build server? This seems the
most stressed part of the infrastructure now.

Yes, this seems the best option to host Radim benchmarks, right?
Should we go and ask?

Yes - I almost have all the tests passing for QGIS now. After that I
want to set up automated testing so that as soon as something gets
broken we are all made aware of it. It would be nice to have a place
to do that.

> Should we go and ask?

http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/report/1 would be the place to ask I guess.

Message-ID: <CAG4NRe+6=ujihB5uQqh6nM1pxD0KvPt54a8X+nbbk1xg-0N0zQ@mail.gmail.com>

Results for large polygons are wrong when calculated with

Example in
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3180464/BorneoLCv2google.zip

Check, for example, polygons with ID 25967 and 26570: according to the table,
the areas are
25967: 8550196769
26570: 1736474738

while visual inspection indicates that 26570 is obviously much larger.

Both results are different than those calculated by R:

25967:    9294889613
26570: 205414657947

Discrepancies with R are particularly large for polygons with area > 1E+10

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS Auto-completion and Call Tips in Eric
	Python Editor
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR9G_sQ4G+Zanrw4xA+fnMKGBn1xYi-HAO6_-UYOQWX07w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've successfully generated QScintilla2 API files for the QGIS Python
bindings and utility modules [0]. If you use the Eric4/5 Python editor (or
another based on QScintilla2), you may be interested in installing and
compiling these APIs.

This allows for auto code completion and/or call tips for 3,450 items in
the QGIS API:

    qgis.core.api
    qgis.gui.api
    qgis.analysis.api
    qgis.utils.api
    qgis.console.api

Also included in the archive is a description of how to reproduce the API
files and some screen snaps on using with Eric4. The CMake edit might be
considered for inclusion in the QGIS source, but (I suggest) only with an
additional compile option for triggering creation of the API files, since
it is not usually necessary to produce them, excepting for when the API
changes.

Seems a better approach, instead of changing SIPMacros.cmake, would be in
python/CMakeLists.txt [0]:

--- python/CMakeLists_orig.txt    2012-02-19 13:41:41.000000000 -0700
+++ python/CMakeLists.txt    2012-04-08 21:00:16.000000000 -0600
@@ -54,0 +55 @@
+set(SIP_EXTRA_OPTIONS ${PYQT4_SIP_FLAGS} -o -a
${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/python/qgis.core.api)
@@ -68,0 +70 @@
+set(SIP_EXTRA_OPTIONS ${PYQT4_SIP_FLAGS} -o -a

@@ -79,0 +82 @@
+set(SIP_EXTRA_OPTIONS ${PYQT4_SIP_FLAGS} -o -a
${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/python/qgis.analysis.api)

This worked fine on compile, creating the same output as the
SIPMacros.cmake edit. Each SIP_EXTRA_OPTIONS could be wrapped with a
conditional based on a compile option for generating the APIs.

That's for the debian packages that are built on qgis.org.

this depends on

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4955

if you compute areas (with both the filed calculator or the "add
geometry columns tool") you get

ID Area_FC
25967 8550196769.93
26570 173647473841.47

that makes sense according to the size of polygons

Can't understand these differences.

ok, it seems there are 2 issues here:
1. The wrong results I get with
vector/Geometry Tools/Export/Add Geometry Columns
that are just missing digits to the right for large numbers

Giovanni: which version are you using?

2. The fact that results provided by R are so different. The most
intriguing/worrying is
that the R results are using package sp and package Rgeos.
I'm dealing with Edzer Pebesma regarding this issue in R-sig-geo and
will keep the list
informed. Perhaps I will open a new ticket on this specific subject
but lets wait
to see what Edzer says.

I think I already patched the plugin builder to do i18n on the Github repo.
Gotta check though, as my memory tends not to remember every commit sha1 ;)
If not, that's a task for the HF.

Message-ID: <201204091951.24855.yjacolin@free.fr>

Hello,

Hakcfest will begin in a few days. I would like to be sure that you have all 
information you need. You can contact me in private to get my professional 
phone number in case you need to contact someone when you will be lost at Lyon 
:)

The hackfest will begin thursday 12/04/2012 at 14h00. University can't host 
the hackfest **in the morning** (due to power outage).

I checked the subscription list and it seems nobody will be at the hackfest in 
the morning. If so, jsut contact me directly by email, I will be at Lyon the 
day before (on wednesday to sunday evening).

Dinner: one restaurant has been planned friday evening. I will share all 
information as soon as the restaurant will confirm it. :/ It should be a 
restaurant cooking lyon speciality. I try to see if you can have some beer but 
wine is the official drinks in France.

I propose to use the #qgishf2012 tags for the hackfest 2012 in Lyon.

If I forget some important information, just ask :)

Y.

Two quick comments:

1) Could you submit your patch via github? If it is a cmake
conditional compilation I see no reason to exclude it from master -
others may have a different opinion.
2) What I would really *love* is to have QGIS api completion (and
other standard python modules if it is easy to achieve) in the built
in python console that is activeated from the QGIS plugins menu. I
often like to demo stuff to people using the python console and always
flap around trying to remember syntax. Obviously this would add a
qsctintilla dependency to QGIS core - how do others feel about this?
Given the other work you are busy with that dependency is probably
coming anyway....

I would seriously consider upgrading the Python console, first of all to
support autocompletion. I suggested the incorporation of QScintilla a
couple of years ago, but it didn't raise much interest. A few weeks ago I
gave a look to iPython, and it's Qt console [1].

It certainly looks good - but how about installing it along with it's
dependencies (such ZeroMQ and PyZMQ), particularly in windows or mac?

Sometimes these things take time to gather interest....we have a much
larger python userbase and probably these ideas are more likely to
gain critical mass...

Larry has a very nice simple integrated IDE plugin in the works that
also uses scintilla, which I would like to see become part of QGIS
core, so scintilla is probably a good fit (though I don't know if it
is mutually exclusive of iPython Qt).

@Paolo Corti - I have published my theme on github and it is much more

Sure. I'll sync my local master branch and test the edits (since I only
tested builds of 1.7.4, which didn't have qgis.networkanalysis). I don't
see any issue with leaving the changes as is, if the .api files are not
going to be packaged with the target. Generation of the .api files does not
seem to slow down the compilation, as far as I can tell.

 :^)  Porting the QTextEdit of PyQGIS console.py to QScintilla was what I
was going to look into next. I have already bootlegged it into Plugin
Editor and done some customizations.

The Eric editor has a nice Python console based on QScintilla (syntax
coloring, code completion and call tips), but I had difficulty trying to
port it to Plugin Editor, because it leverages Eric's entrenched debugger
classes. The ported base debugger I tried consistently crashed QGIS. Maybe
it can be included in a later version.

Currently I have code completion and call tips working well in Plugin
Editor [0]. The compiled API files I am testing with are:

    PyQt4-Qt4.8.api, Python-2.7.api, QScintilla2.api
    qgis.analysis.api, qgis.console.api, qgis.core.api, qgis.gui.api,
qgis.utils.api

The compiled API 'python.pap' file for a given QScintilla editor widget is
~37,500 api items total, and 900 KB in size (yet is still quite responsive).

The IPython console is very powerful, but required compilation of ZeroMQ on
my Mac. I think it would be great to add to Plugin Editor, but a
QScintilla-based PyQGIS console, I think, would be a good first step.

Having played around with the code completion, I added another .api file
for the qgis.utils.iface instance [0]. This allows direct access to the 149
QgisInterface slots/functions when typing just 'iface' [1], which is common.

@Tim - I have recently added templates (built-in and custom) to Plugin
Editor as well. Using the run_script() template (formulated as per Script
Runner) you can quickly open a test script, with code completion and call
tips, type a few lines and run it within the Editor. Also, you can copy
text selections via drag/drop to the PyQGIS console for running. Those
steps would help you to show some example code quickly.

Switching from QTextEdit to QScintilla for the console looks like about a
50% rewrite, plus some refactoring. Certainly an all-weekend kinda project,
considering new features would be added, too.

Maybe not needed as a priority if you think you could achieve the same
using your script runner like support in the editor?

you can still edit your changelog being logged in using

I usually fill manually the changelog.

So I think that it's better to fix the problem in the django application

Hi James,

I still cannot see the issue on Ubuntu (64bit), did you updated to the

Hi James,

I still cannot see the issue on Ubuntu (64bit), did you updated to the latest build?

Hi Radim

Awesome, thanks a lot!
It is very interesting to see the performance relevant changes and it 
certainly helps to avoid performance regressions.

Regarding the hosting, I have to check if it is possible to run the 
application on a server at Sourcepole.

Regards,
Marco

Some links and notes for those knowing nothing about osgeo
infrastructure (like me):
  http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Transition_Plan_2010
  http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/AdhocVM
  http://osuosl.org/
  http://www.linux-kvm.org
If I got it, osgeo3 and osgeo4 are hosted in OSU OSL using KVM managed
by Ganeti with vCPU/CPU 1.75 and 1.5 (i.e 14 and 12 virtual CPU on 8
physical cores).

I know little about virtualization. I worry that it may be difficult
to get information about real physical resources and configuration
changes within a VM. The number of VM/vCPU may change while
/proc/cpuinfo on a VM remains the same.  It seems to me, that for the
benchmarks, it would be necessary to pin VM vCPU (and only those vCPU)
to reserved physical CPUs:
http://docs.ganeti.org/ganeti/master/html/design-cpu-pinning.html . I
am not sure if that would be accepted by OSGEO SAC. If we ask for
dedicated CPUs, we should be able to document that CPUs will be used
most of time. Nightly build + tests + benchmarks running on the same
VM could guarantee such effective CPU usage.

Apparently PyQt doesn't have that method[1].  What do you need that for in
Python?

Hi Jurgen,

I needed this for subprocess.call/Popen since it does not accept QStrings.
I always read at doc.qt.nokia, that's where I found it.
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qstring.html#toStdString
" This operator is only available if Qt is configured with STL 
compatibility enabled."

I thought that everything in qt was in pyqt, but this is apparently not 
true.

I finally end up using str("%s" % myString), which works.

Thanks a lot for your answer.

Denis

Hi Denis,

maybe you should use unicode(..) instead of str(...) and be sure to work 
with unicode for ALL your strings in your code.

Otherwise you will end up (like me :-( ) to find out that you have 
certain character encoding problems in certain code area's (non ascii 
character used for example by .... the french ;-) )

OSgeo used to have a buildbot infrastructure. It got abandoned due to
lack of maintainers. Volunteers to take it back up ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] new plugin: test on windows and security policy
Message-ID: <4F8572EA.4000402@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just uploaded a plugin, "Custom Launcher". It can be used to c 
ustomize your own actions to launch your preferred apps or commands 
within QGIS.
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/customlauncher/
(video demo is here http://www.youtube.com/v/B6811zAuXhw&hd=1 
<http://www.youtube.com/v/B6811zAuXhw&hd=1> )

Can someone test this on windows (mac?) with a shell command, to see if 
everything is ok?


Also, when using shell commands, subprocess.Popen is called using 
shell=True and This is not recommended in python doc.
However, I consider it is safe in my plugin since the action is saved in 
the application settings and NOT in the project settings.
Indeed, there might be safety issues, as you could open someone else's 
project with a "rm -rf /" command hidden in an action. But this is not 
the case.
And if someone takes time to modify something in QGIS, he could do any 
other hack.
Do you agree on this?


Greetings

Denis

Interesting question - I'm also wondering.

I arrive at the airport from Amsterdam at 16:05 - so even an hour later.

The sourcepole crowd arrives by train at 14:26.  Not sure about the others.
Werner?  Richard?

Hi Victor and Paolo,

Sorry but how can I add the path for SAGA on Debian?

Thank you very much!
Pedro

Sorry, I was wrong, the path is needed, because it is added then to
PATH in the batch file. The R call does not use one, since it passes
the batch process to R directly, and assumes R to be on the PATH...

Hi Pedro,
it is not needed in Linux!

Check if in /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin the saga_cmd is found!

As said to Ian, we will be on the venue at least until 8pm, probably later if 
some hackers are already on the track, melting ideas into code.

Do not hesitate to come to the venue in the afternoon then. Adagio hotel is 
not far from the venue by foot, so you can as well drop your bags there and 
come.

Vincent

Ok!
Maybe it is a problem with LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

Hi Salvatore,


Shows the old error message:

The same doing:
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/ saga_cmd


and

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/saga:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 



Weird...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 125 meters error
Message-ID: <CA+qUSTQnpA8_JhdUZDHfo5p1=WvyFGUtnRMV=XZZ7bBsFpHsmw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I am a user of QGIS 1.7.4 on 11.04 ubuntu natty and am experiencing
some issues while trying to transform shp or raster files from Pulkovo
1942(58) EPSG:3120 polish coordinate system to ETRS89 EPSG:2180 (also
a polish coordinate system). Process runs smoothly itself but produces
a placement error causing dislocation between original true placement
and transformation result (about 125 m distance between identical
points). Problem occures allso when trying to transform to ETRS89
EPSG:2179 or ETRS89 EPSG:2178. Allso trying thesame operation on QGIS
1.7.4 installed on windows 7 provides no errors at all. Seraching QGIS
forums led to simple conclusion - different gdal transformation tools
implemented in ubuntu and windows QGIS installation files (or sth like
that). Question is - will it be fixed in the nearest hackfest? This is
a serious issue which prevents companies using open source software
(like the one i work for) to grow. Allso a question refering postgis
database and raster management - rasters stored in database via
PostGIS Raster with created pyramids load slowly in QGIS cause there
is no support for pyramids. Can this support be established by a
plugin or other means to make QGIS and PostgreSQL database compatible
in this mater? If it is possible will it be implemented in one of next
QGIS releases or by plugin?

Best regards

Bartosz

Known issue

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5142


don't know why, but if you compile qgis against gdal 1.9 then it will
work correctly (but used to do so also with older gdal versions)

cheers

Ciao Pedro,

add access to SAGA libraries, if you have not done:
$ export SAGA_MLB=/usr/lib/saga

Also, try it using plugin SEXTANTE in QGIS!
For example: running the command "Convert Polygons to Lines"!

Hi Salvatore,

Thank you very much, it works now on terminal!


However, still can not run any SAGA tool from the SEXTANTE plugin...

For instance, "Polygon centroids". SEXTANTE logs:

SAGA execution commands
libshapes_polygons "Polygon Centroids" -POLYGONS "/home/pedro/Limpezas/caop_2011_pinhel.shp" -CENTROIDS "/home/pedro/sextante/outputs_centroids.shp"
SAGA execution console output

error: Library could not be loaded [libshapes_polygons]

In the terminal it works with exactly the same syntax as SEXTANTE:

pedro@debian-amilo:~$ saga_cmd libshapes_polygons "Polygon Centroids" -POLYGONS "/home/pedro/Limpezas/caop_2011_pinhel.shp" -CENTROIDS "/home/pedro/sextante/outputs_centroids.shp"



I still found something strange in some algorithms. 
For example, the tool "Create Graticule" gives SEXTANTE error. Logs:

SAGA execution commands
libshapes_tools "Create Graticule" -EXTENT "/home/pedro/Limpezas/caop_2011_pinhel.shp" -X_EXTENT_MIN 0 -X_EXTENT_MAX 0 -Y_EXTENT_MIN 0 -Y_EXTENT_MAX 0 -DISTX 100 -DISTY 100 -TYPE 0 -GRATICULE "/home/pedro/sextante/grid.shp"

By running the command directly in the terminal, it gives an error by the fact that the module is "Create graticule" and not "Create Graticule" (case sensitive).

Then, there are some parameters in the syntax that does not match the accepted SAGA_CMD sintax. And the module only works like this:

$ saga_cmd libshapes_tools "Create graticule" -LINES "/home/pedro/sextante/grid.shp" -LIMIT_SHAPES "/home/pedro/Limpezas/caop_2011_pinhel.shp" -X_EXTENT_MIN 0 -X_EXTENT_MAX 0 -Y_EXTENT_MIN 0 -Y_EXTENT_MAX 0 -DISTX 1000 -DISTY 1000 -TYPE 0



The same applies, eg with the tool "Shapes Buffer". logs:

SAGA execution commands
libshapes_tools "Shapes Buffer" -SHAPES "/home/pedro/sextante/outputs.shp" -BUF_TYPE 0 -BUF_DIST 100 -BUF_FIELD "AREA_T_HA" -BUF_SCALE 1 -BUF_ZONES 1 -DCIRCLE 5 -DISSOLVE??????? -BUFFER "/home/pedro/sextante/outputs_buff.shp"

This is how it works:

Someone confirm this behavior?

Environment:
Debian 6.0.4 (squeeze)
QGIS 1.7.4 (SEXTANTE 1.0.2)
SAGA 2.0.4


Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Can you run it with 'make check' and provide the detailed log it provides?

Also useful for diagnostics are:

* /tmp/*_diff.png, providing any of these that have red in them.
* the versions of gdal, proj, geos etc that your qgis is linked to.

Thanks

Tim

Is the *.so file found in /home/pedro? it sounds weird!
The libraries should be in /usr/lib/saga (SAGA_MLB) as you know already.

pheraps because you run command "export SAGA_MLB" before!

I have a doubt, how did you to install SAGA lib? build, binary....?

Also try to install (build) the latest version 2.0.8!

Rudi,

For what it's worth the problem seems to be that while your libgdal.so was
upgraded, the Python bindings were not.  So the _gdal.so from the python
bindings is still looking for 1.8.

I'm not sure how you upgraded GDAL, but if you built it yourself just make
sure you also are building and installing the python bindings.  You might want
to get rid of the old ones (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/osgeo) first.

Best regards,

Ciao Paolo,

It is an error in quote string, I get this in log:

Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string

So, if you change in SagaAlgorithm.py (line 238) file:

from:

commands.append("libio_gdal 1 -GRIDS \"" + filename2 + "\" -FORMAT 1
-TYPE 0 -FILE " + filename + "\"");

to:

commands.append("libio_gdal 1 -GRIDS \"" + filename2 + "\" -FORMAT 1
-TYPE 0 -FILE \"" + filename + "\"");

It should work, for me it is!

Cheers,

-SL

I'm back!

It seems a misprint!

Try to change:

form:

if isinstance(param, ParameterVector)

to:

if isinstance(param, ParameterTable):

in RAlgorithm.py file (line 215)!

Hi All:
    I use QgsGraduatedSymbolRendererV2 to simulate colorbar (like
matplotlib.colorbar)
    use rendererV2.setClassAttribute to show using certain field
    But there are some feature where its value of that field is NULL
    I found that value NULL seems to be shown as value zero (range 0 - 0 )
    Could I distinguish value NULL & zeros with different symbol?
    or Could I make a symbol for NULL value?

Hi,

another idea from Lyon. 

There are discussions and plans about sharing development costs for QGIS
features behind the scenes. We would like to make this process more
transparent and visible for the community. Aim is that QGIS users get an
overview and the chance to promote/support developments by sharing the costs.

If this sounds interesting, please have a look at the wiki and contact us,
if you would like to add your project:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem when using CRS on the fly.
Message-ID: <4F89C020.80407@coldsea.co.za>

Hi List

I'm trying to lay a shape file and a geotiff file(converted from .ecw)
over each other, using "on the fly crs". I also have a 'control' shape
file that can be overlaid on the geotiff raster file without using the
"on the fly crs" function.
The two shape files can be overlaid correctly using "on the fly crs",
every thing matches up. But there is a problem when bringing the geotiff
raster file into the equation.
When enabling the "on the fly crs" function the shape file and the
geotiff file block each other out. If the geotiff file is visible in
Qgis then the shape file is blocked from view, and the other way round.
Lets say I can see the shape file and the geotiff is blocked out. Now I
put the mouse pointer on the geotiff layer,  click to highlight the
layer, then right click and click on "zoom to layer extent". Now the
shape file is blocked out and I can see the geotiff.
The geotiff is above the shape file in the "Layer" panel and I have set
the geotiff to 50% transparency. This also happens when using the
"control" shape file.


Not sure if this is a bug or if there is something else I need to change
to get the right behaviour.
If additional info is needed please ask.

Thanks in advance

evert

PS - Mmmmm, I just tested the geotiff  and "on the fly crs" against two
other shape files that contain data pertaining to the geotiff and they
both work correctly.
       I will do some scratching so if I can get around this.

Right. In case you happen to be there earlier, you could ask at the main 
entrance to open the door for you (?accueil?, just on the left after the big 
stairs).

Hi

right now the graduated symbol renderer does not distinguish between
NULL and zeros. Please feel free to file a feature request.

Hi all.
I'm enjoying sextante and otb immensely, so I've packaged otb and
uploaded to my repo:
deb    http://int.faunalia.it/~paolo/debian testing/
In case someone needs it. It is compiled on clean testing, with just
gdal from experimental (1.9.0-1~exp2).
Thanks a lot to the otb team for helping in packaging (especially
Sebastien Dinot and Julien Malik).
Enjoy.
All the best.

Volevo dire:

/usr/local/share/qgis/python

Mentre se ottiene il seguente errore:

libqgis_core.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory

c'? da impostare anche:

/usr/local/lib (come LD_LIBRARY_PATH)

Solitamente quest'ultimo PATH ? gi? impostato nelle variabili d'ambiente

As we have discussed in the HF, it is good to add the plugins of general

I cast my vote for the Atlas plugin, also as a form of gratitude for our

Hi all.

Running slope, aspect etc results in:

Could not load layer: /home/paolo/sextante/tempdata/1334329842.3813.tif
Check the SEXTANTE log to look for errors in algorithm execution


and in fact:

Sextante.runalg("saga:slopeaspectcurvature","/home/paolo/Desktop/corso_qgis_grass/Dati_corso_QGIS/dtm/hdr.adf",0,None,None,None,None,None)


All the best.

Would moving to master imply a loss of flexibility? I mean, currently
any update/fix to a python plugin
is immediately made available to users. Would moving plugins to master
imply that users have to wait
for the next release or compile themselves?

If I understand correctly, after moving to master plugin will
be updated directly in master, as now done with fTools and
GDALTools

I, too, thought the loss of flexibility would be an issue, if I had a
plugin get accepted to be in core. However, upon inspection of the
qgis.utils module, and the following command in PyQGIS console shows this
would not be the case:

 >>> print qgis.utils.plugin_paths


returns (on my Mac 1.7.4 kyngchaos.com.app install):

['/Users/larrys/.qgis/python/plugins',
'/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/plugins']

This confirms what I've seen in the past: if a core plugin is released via
a user repository channel, and the user installs it, the installed user
plugin takes precedence over the core module of the same package name (e.g.
fTools user plugin is used instead of fTools core plugin).

So, it is my understanding that a core plugin shipping with a release would
not be 'pinned down' to the QGIS release schedule.

Someone please correct me if this scenario is not the true.

StartFragmentHi all.

While translating the GUI in IT, I spooted a few wrong strings in EN:


* Field %1 ignored, because of unsupported type type %2

* MSSQL is sometimes spelled as MS SQL

Better fix them upstream.
Thanks.

Paolo

Just got back from a relaxed weekend, and founds tons of work to do!!!
:-)  ,...tomorrow I will start fixing your bugs and adding your
suggestions (thanks for them!!)

Regarding the OTB settings, Julien though that it would be better for
now to let the user configure that manually in linux, since OTB
installation is a bit more complex. Since he is the OTB expert, I
followed his advice

With SAGA and GRASS I followed yours, and there is no need to set anything.

Yes, exactly. You can release a plugin update this way and it mask the one 
bundled with Qgis release. If, some day, the user upgrades qgis and the 
version of the plugin bundled with master becomes higher that the one 
available in the repository, QGIS displays a message to encouage user to 
uninstall the update, that is now outdated.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qt image formats issue in Mac release
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_OWX7_43QD_LVGUg2fYFqotaO7K8JFzRLU2oBfRvaeew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In the course of working on a Python plugin, I put together a lightweight,
tabbed web browser for help files [0]. When using it, from within QGIS.app
on Mac (1.7.4) to view sites that had GIFs I noticed that they were not
loading, but would load when the plugin was run independently from my
system.

Upon checking the image formats that are bundled with the release, I
noticed only one:
    /Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/PlugIns/imageformats/libqjpeg.dylib

Whereas /Developer/Applications/Qt/plugins/imageformats  (for Qt 4.8.1)
contains 6 more:
    libqgif.dylib, libqico.dylib, libqjpeg.dylib, libqmng.dylib,
libqsvg.dylib, libqtga.dylib, libqtiff.dylib

Using the following shell commands, I quickly got GIF support patched into
QGIS.app [1]. I also see uses for libqico.dylib, libqsvg.dylib and
libqtiff.dylib for plugin developers. It looks like 'Quantum-GIS / mac /
cmake / 1qt.cmake.in' could be readily updated to include some or all of
the Qt image formats. Total size for all image formats is ~ 1.2 MB on disk.

Is there a reason only libqjpeg.dylib is included in releases? Are there
any formats that might (or are known to) cause issues, if bundled with Mac
releases?

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4058089/qgis/help-browser_qt-imageformat-issue.png
[1] http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4058089/qgis/qt-imageformats-fix.sh

BTW: I can confirm Qt 4.8.1 (FOSS version) fixes the issue with QWebView
Mac OS X 10.6.8 that Qt 4.8.0 caused. QWebView loads fine on that OS now.

Only jpeg is included because it was needed by something in QGIS.  If external plugins can and will make use of the other Qt image plugins, I can add them.

something else about me. I am available via skype (skype_id: ugnpaul).
I am from Voronezh, Russia (UTC +4) and you could find me on-line
something around UTC 7:00 - 14:00 and 18:00 - 21:00. If there is a better
way to communicate, please, let me know. I'm waiting for responses of
those who are interested in my project and me. Sorry for being so late.

Thank you.

Thanks for the introduction - some of us have read your proposal and
are quite interested in what you will do. I'm not sure if the
different approaches you mention take this account, but perhaps your
approach can also take into account the pixel resolution of the render
device - since there is never any reason to draw more than one of the
features vertices per pixel, and if a feature is completely contained
within a pixel it can be simply drawn as a coloured pixel. Perhaps
this approach is less efficient than simply rendering everything but
it may be work looking into.

Optimisation of our render routines will certainly be a welcome
addition to QGIS!

Tim

You should as well have a look at Sandro's work on Mapnik :
http://blog.cartodb.com/post/20163722809/speeding-up-tiles-rendering

Performance tests speak for themselves...

I think Sandro even showed up at some point on IRC or mailing list saying he 
could try to implement that on QGIS. You should be able to get in touch with  
him to discuss the matter.

Just a few lines, meant as examples:

  * fix Globe plugin and make it available in major operating systems
  * write unit tests to cover all major core functions
  * renting a server to run Radim's benchmarks

All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Release plan updates for 1.8
Message-ID: <CALCNqkby7nMqYO8JkGA8w1+_iBEs4zmYH-Zk8kY5LNvc9QCTcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings all

I just wanted to post a quick summary of the plans for the release for
1.8 and a general change in approach for the future. First let me
explain the general approach change:

* We are going to abandon the approach of maintaining multiple
branches (1 or two release branches plus master)
* Instead release will be directly off master
* The release branches in future will be nominal and receive minimal
maintenance, only being used as a marker for the release and on
occassions where we need to apply a critical fix soon after the
release is made
* Feature freeze and string freeze will take place directly on master
* At the point of release a branch will be made and normal activity
can continue on master

And for 1.8:

* We are going to delete the existing 1.8 branch and release based on
what is currently on trunk. This way we can be sure that all the 'good
stuff' gets into the next release.
* There will be a couple of very minor api breakages in the release
will only affect those who are using the map printing (composer) API.
I realise that this is not the norm for a point release (and it will
not be the norm for our point releases), but we want to be pragmatic
about this rather than dogmatic. If you need any assistance in
adapting your plugin to the new api we will be happy to help (and we
suggest to place a small wrapper around the changed calls so that you
plugin works both with 1.7 and 1.8).
* On this Tuesday (17 April) 12 pm GMT, feature freeze will take
effect on master - after that no more features should be added to
master until the freeze is lifted.
* There will be a string freeze effective from 24 April, although
translators are encouraged to start translating sooner)
* There will be a three week period for testing - following that, if
there are no blocking tickets remaining, we will branch 1.8 and put
out a call for packages on 8 May 2012
* The final release announcements will follow approximately one week
following that

I know many out there prefer a 'stabilised branch' approach as we have
been following with the 1.7 series but after a lot of soul searching
and based on our available time and our priorities we have decided
that it is not viable for us to continue in this manner and we would
like a 'one branch' approach to our project for the forseeable future.
Of course new developements should continue to take place in your own
branch or fork of QGIS - the master should always represent 'the best
that we have'.

Please note again: THE CURRENT 1.8 BRANCH WILL BE DELETE ON TUESDAY

Regards


Tim

I believe the hold up previously was a libtiff linking issue in gdal
which should be resolved now. I'll look into testing and copying from
the otb ppa to the ubuntugis repo.

I see https://launchpad.net/~otb/+archive/orfeotoolbox-stable-ubuntugis
but that seems to be gdal 1.8 and might need a rebuild.

Of course anything that is not in standard repos is suboptimal.
Would it be feasible to maintain otb together with our builds on our
qgis.org repos?
That would make life far easier for Debian and Ubuntu users, and we
could share efforts in building.
All the best.

how about creating more dependencies to python-libs, ... by adding
plugins to core? I think this should be taken in focus of this
discussion. IMHO it's not good to add plugins to core that make it
necessary to install e.g. mysql with qgis.

I'm not talking about a specific plugin, but I want to keep in mind that
some plugins have specific dependencies (may bee not the two ones
discussed for adding to core right now) and adding those plugins to core
may be problematic.

There was a wrong version number in the __init__.py (it was the old 
one). I fixed this by adding a new version, hope it works.

Statist has external dependency ? matplotlib package (used to build
histogram). Maybe it is better to rewrite in C++ and use QWT for
graphics?

StartFragmentHi all.

Just upgraded from svn, to test your fixes, now I get:


It seems that SAGA is not correctly installed in your system.

Please install it before running SAGA algorithms.


No options are available to add the path to saga, so I'm stuck.

In fact, starting saga_cmd returns a couple of errors:
error: module library
...
error: Library does not contain executable modules [librecreations_games.so]

...
59 SAGA Module Libraries

Should I wait for the next release of the plugin before keeping on
testing, or can I go on with trunk?
All the best, and thanks.

That is just something that I added to automatically test if SAGA is
installed, so it does not let you execute a SAGA algorithm if SAGA is
not installed. Clearly, it is not working, since it is obvious that
you have SAGA installed...

Let me work on it a bit more, because I am not sure that it is a good
idea... I am just thinking about how to make the configuration of
external applications easier, while being robust at the same time

Regarding the SAGA error, that is not a problem, do not worry about
that, you are just missing a library on the command line, because taht
library just contain interactive modules that cannot be run on the
console. It is a SAGa issue, but it should not bother you

Indeed, I just tested to get the needed qgis dependancies from
ubuntugis-unstable (oneiric) via
aptitude build-dep qgis

which returns :
sudo aptitude build-dep qgis
Les NOUVEAUX paquets suivants vont ?tre install?s :
  grass{a} grass-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev{ab} libdap-dev{a}
libgcrypt11-dev{a} libgdal1-1.8.0{a} libgdal1-dev libgif-dev{a}
libgnutls-dev{a}
  libgnutlsxx26{a} libgpg-error-dev{a} libhdf5-serial-dev{a}
libjasper-dev{a} libspatialite-dev libspatialite3{a} libtasn1-3-dev{a}
  libxerces-c2-dev{a}


No libgdal1-1.9.0 here... although it seems gdal 1.9 has been "released" in
the ubuntugis-unstable repo...

Hi,
I've just realized that the python api does't support the
QgsGeometry.asGeos() method.
I understand that it would require SIP to manage the marshalling and the
bindings to GEOS too, so what is the best way to obtain a GEOS geometry
from the QgsGeoemtry?
I mean, is there something better then passing through the WKB
representation and creating a GEOS instance from python?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add a simpler default setting for a fresh

Message-ID: <4F8BE0BD.3080506@enoreth.net>

Hi,

Would it be possible to change the default parameters of QGIS ? For now 
a new user gets all the tool bars on the first launch and most of the 
tools are not visible. Some such as advanced digitizing, grass, overview 
should be off by default. The others should be spread out, for example 
the navigation bar could be set on one side of the application.

Somme other changes could be :

- to activate the north icon and the scale bar for the canevas
- to add a default 10 pixel radius for snapping tolerance and vertex edit
- activate "show makers only for selected features"
- switch to "zoom to mouse cursor" to have the same behavior than most 
of the web-mapping tools

These changes would make the software less frightening, less cluttered 
for newcomers.

Sounds reasonable, even though I'm sure there will be users opposing
this, perhaps strongly in some cases.
An alternative (a bit cumbersome) would be to have a "first run wizard"
that asks the user which plugins should be activated, etc.
Not that I am a big fan of wizards, but it might be easier for
newcomers. Maybe it could be activated on demand.
All the best.

 Hi,

 I agree with all of your ideas, except for adding the north icon and 
 the scalebar by default. The map always points north in QGIS, so why the 
 arrow? Also, the map scale is already in the status bar, so why the 
 double information?

 All other suggestions make sense to me.

 I would also add the following default settings:

 Tab Map Tools:
 - mode: Top down, stop at first hit
 - checkbox enabled for "open object form if only a single result ..."

Afaik the release-1_8 branch is going to be deleted anyway tomorrow

Message-ID: <4F8BE32E.3050808@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Currently, most R plugins are broken on windows, because Rpy2 is no
longer available for that platform.
Among the ones I find important, manageR, SDA4PP, and Home Range.
A possible alternative would be to reimplement these functionalities
through R scripts in Sextante (should be easy for HR, possible for
SDA4PP, probably unsuitable for manageR).
Opinions? Takers?
All the best.

Those opposing it are those who already have their own parameters, what 
I'm suggesting is only for newcomers.

I think that all the persons giving formations would like not to waste 
time showing how to catch and move that toolbar which is mostly 
invisible except the anchor :p

Tell me where to make the change in the repo and I'm doing it right now 
in time for 1.8 !

In my experience, new users are quite fond of having them :
- the north, so then they realize that their data isn't projected correctly
- the graphic scale, because they can't figure a number but can relate 
to a line (and use their thumb to compare (not a joke))

Thanks for raising the point, if we start thinking there are quite a few
options that may have more sensible default. And we have about 24 h to
change them now :)

 ok - I am not strongly against it. It really depends on the map scale 
 and projections one is working at. I only use one projection and very 
 large scales (street or community level). I usually print north arrow 
 and scalebar on the print layout. On the main QGIS screen they usually 
 get in my way. But I can always override the setting - so not a problem.

yes, the problem is that the versions of the libraries are not
necessarily aligned (most notably for GDAL).
having one common repo for qgis+otb would make things simpler for users,
and possibly would reduce the work for packagers

After uploading the plugin to the "old" repo, I've noticed the version 
problem and tried to correct it. Unfortunately I cannot edit the plugin 
on the repo anymore, so it will stay as it is up to the time an 
administrator can delete it from the "old" repo.

Alternatively, a more recent version of the plugin (0.1.1) is available 
on the BC Consulting repo [0] (I know, it should be moved to the "new" 
repo!)

Thanks for the clarification. I edited '1qt.cmake.in' in my copy of the
master branch to bundle all of the Qt image formats into a .app build [0].
It builds fine, with correct referencing to the bundled Qt frameworks.

Now, my help browser loads favicons and gifs [1], as well as rendering SVG
[2]. I ran into an issue where the browser would crash master whenever
there was an external website trying to load (not related to image
formats). So, I copied the extra image format .dylibs over to my local copy
of your 1.7.4 install, where they worked well, with no crashes from the
browser.

At only ~1.2 MB on disk, 400 KB compressed, is there any reason not to
include all of the image formats?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Project file backward compatibility
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYovDRyOvmMKLL9jNFTGK4KDDXtOAv54pcOZ4eUCBDriNg@mail.gmail.com>

What is the project file (PF) backward compatibility policy?

PF written by a lower major release must be supported? Example:  QGIS
2.0 must support 1.7 PF?

PF written by a lower minor release in the same major line must be
supported? Example:  QGIS 1.8 must support 1.7 PF?

PF must be readable by a lower major release? Example:  QGIS 2.0 must
write PF readable by QGIS 1.7?

PF must be readable by a lower minor release in the same major line?
Example:  QGIS 1.8 must write PF readable by QGIS 1.7?

Is it current master considered to be 2.0 in this context?

I have modified WMS to use extended QgsDataSourceURI but the new
encoded URI would break backward compatibility. I can do conversion
when saving/reading to/from PF but is it necessary?

When developing the OTB->Sextante->Qgis bridge during the HackFest, I 
was using qgis 1.7.4 from ubuntugis-unstable ppa, and otb from our own ppa.

It works since we took a different approach than before and now Sextante 
is calling the OTB command line tools ('otb-bin' package).
Previously we used the otb python bindings, so qgis and otb were loaded 
in the same process, and this is where we hit the issue with 
libtiff/libgeotiff. I confirm this issue is fixed with gdal 1.9, but 
gdal 1.9 is not available (yet ?) for all the distro.

Now, it should just work.
I believe it is safe to copy the otb packages into ubuntugis-unstable. 
It works ok for the "otb inside sextante inside qgis" project.

Cheers,
Julien

Hi Radim

I have similar issues regarding the merge of the raster_resampling 
branch (I wrote the project file conversion code in Lyon). The problem 
there is that even with the project file conversion code, the old qmls 
won't load. Maybe I'll try to access the project file conversion methods 
from the qml loading methods.

>What is the project file (PF) backward compatibility policy?


Afaik there is no official policy yet (can be added to the coding 
standards document if there are no objections). My opinion is that if 
2.0 can break the API, it should also be possible that it breaks project 
file compability:

>PF written by a lower major release must be supported? Example:  QGIS
>2.0 must support 1.7 PF?


Is not required but would be nice.

>PF written by a lower minor release in the same major line must be
>supported? Example:  QGIS 1.8 must support 1.7 PF?


Is required

>PF must be readable by a lower major release? Example:  QGIS 2.0 must
>write PF readable by QGIS 1.7?

Forward compatibility not required

>PF must be readable by a lower minor release in the same major line?
>Example:  QGIS 1.8 must write PF readable by QGIS 1.7?

Forward compatibility not required

Marco

I think every version should be able to open projects from at least the
previous one, otherwise users will have to recreate all their projects.

That would be a 'required unless there are good reasons to break it' 
(same as for API compatibility, otherwise plugin developers will have to 
recreate all their plugins).

I fixed that. The checking I do is to try to execute saga_cmd without
parameters and see if the response is the saga help screen or the
console complaining about not finding that command. but I was not
correctly checking the output of the saga_cmd (mispelled "-----"
instead of "___")

It is still a simple mechanism, but should work for now, and that at
least guarantees that SAGA is installed before letting the user run
anything. I created a similar thing for the R bindings

Hi Victor,
gracias for this. Unfortunately I still get:

It seems that SAGA is not correctly installed in your system.

Please install it before running SAGA algorithms.


after upgrading to r101

Julien,

Rather than guess which ones to copy, can you tell me your launchpad ID
so I can add you to the UbuntuGIS team and you can just upload future
releases there.

As for Paolo's question...Launchpad is actually the ideal place to keep
everything as it's more open for contribution and we can better rely on
the Debian packagers too. I'll be honest that I always have people
install from Ubuntu-GIS unless they want nightly builds because the
dependencies are usually updated faster there. I was actually
considering that we move the Ubuntu nightly builds there too so that we
lower the load on the qgis server (of course this might add complication
to Jurgen's work, which I'd like to avoid since he does such an awesome
job now).

Thanks,
Alex

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR__HnCOPJwS2aE3-s4Yz-7+PKRmUDWO=hcY65FE9OK0NA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

On builds of master branch (Mac OS X 10.7.3, Qt 4.8.1, Py 2.7.1) the
following simple QWebView window crashes QGIS:

  from PyQt4.QtGui import QMainWindow

  from PyQt4.QtCore import QUrl

  from PyQt4.QtWebKit import QWebView

  win = QMainWindow(qgis.utils.iface.mainWindow())

  helpviewer = QWebView()

  helpviewer.setUrl(QUrl("http://www.xkcd.com"))

  win.setCentralWidget(helpviewer)

  win.show()

Local URLs work fine; it's just when accessing external ones (any web site).

Can someone confirm this on Mac or any other platform?

Thanks,

The only holdup is someone to maintain windows compiling of Rpy2, the
main author just doesn't have time/machine to do it. I think we tracked
down a current version for python 2.7 but haven't tried it yet. Once
tested could be re-added to osgeo4w.

Here's the link Giovanni found, can someone please test
https://bitbucket.org/lgautier/rpy2/issue/85/ive-tried-to-compile-rpy2-under-windows-xp

This is another question, where should be isolated the conversion
code? I would prefer to keep it in one place, OTOH it may be often
related to providers so it should go to providers. BTW, there are
providers specific blocks of code in QgsRasterLayer and even in
QgsMapLayer  read/writeXml methods.

I wrote to the doc, that it must support previous major version, but
that is probably too much. OTOH, previous minor version is not enough
IMO. What compromise would be the best and how to specify it, by a
number of minor releases or by a maximum period between releases?

Is it required that a development version (from master) understands
projects written by older version of the same major.minor? Probably
yes, because many people are using devel versions. The problem is,
that in that case, it would not be possible to use the version written
in a project to decide if it has already new format (the version is
for example 1.9.90-Alpha) and guessing the format from a string value
may be complicated.

Should we use a separate versions for project files? It would be also
possible to add version attribute directly to XML tags if necessary,
because in readXml() methods we don't have access to project file
version.

I think there are 2 different issues here:
1. The functionality of a given plugin should be in QGIS core
2. An specific plugin, covering a core functionality, fulfills the
requirements to be in QGIS core

We should agree on a list for 1 and a set of criteria for 2
The criteria for 2 could be, at least:
 -stability
- speed
- conform to a limited list of external dependencies

Setting general criteria (that can be reviewed as this must be
flexible) will prevent many problems.

Nothing scheduled as far as I know. Looking at the server the directory 
is empty, so I'm guessing a sphinx build broke, though I can't seem to 
find the cron job that would auto build (not sure if there is one).

I'll tried regen by hand and got:
/var/www/pyqgis_cookbook/english_us/source/vector.rst:396: (SEVERE/4) 
Title level inconsistent:

So looks like there's a bug that crept into the code.

Thanks for reporting,

Hi,

I changed the title level in vector.rst and build again, please tell, if
the level I chose is wrong.

I agree. In some way user should be able to keep their project uptodate with

PS:?I have a clean installation with SAGA 2.0.8 now. My old problem should be local, because it works on other machines! Now I'm on Debian Wheezy.

Ciao Paolo,

It is an error in quote string, I get this in log:

Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string

So, if you change in SagaAlgorithm.py (line 238) file:

from:

commands.append("libio_gdal 1 -GRIDS \"" + filename2 + "\" -FORMAT 1
-TYPE 0 -FILE " + filename + "\"");

to:

commands.append("libio_gdal 1 -GRIDS \"" + filename2 + "\" -FORMAT 1
-TYPE 0 -FILE \"" + filename + "\"");

It should work, for me it is!

Cheers,

-SL

today I update my qgis-server trunk version

The cmake configuration was passed without problem so I guess there isn't
any missing module.

but when try to compille with "make "
I see this error.

It seems a SIP problem, maybe related to what discussed here:
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/build-error-td4350904.html

I could compile with MSVC on Windows.

Yes, it would be good to support reading of versions with the same 
major.minor. One possibility would be to define a new version number for 
every project file change (e.g. 1.9.0.1, 1.9.0.2, ...). That way it 
would be possible to invoke the proper project file transformation. For 
the sake of clarity, it would be good to synchronize it with the 
official version number, otherwise it might confuse people.

In the case of the raster resampling changes, it should be 
straightforward to detect old versions from the xml itself. But yes, 
this kind of recognition could be difficult to do in other cases (and 
get messy if the xml format changes often).

Right. It may be cleaner if providers would have their individual 
readXML/writeXML methods. I'm not sure where the conversion code should 
go. For providers it might be good to have it in the provider lib (as 
providers can be added dynamically). For conversion code not located in 
plugin / provider libs (e.g. symbology code), it would be good to go to 
QgsProjectFileTransform to have everything in one place.

Marco

Hi all.
Currently, most plugins do not have an About dialog, and those who have
it are often quite different. Can we choose a layout, make a template,
and ask plugin devs to please use it?
A small thing, but it will sooth out the user experience, and will give
a more integrated ovarall look.
All the best.

Which version of SIP are you running?  Looks like it doesn't support the -o
switch introduced in 67c77e553.

Hi,

testing with:

>python
>import sip
>print '%x' % sip.SIP_VERSION


I see the version is:

40903

The last version of qgis-server I compiled (using this SIP version) was on
7 april
always from trunk.

Hi Paolo,

I agree with your proposal. Automaticly including 2 plugin menu items ;
"help" and "about" make also sense for me.

Hi,

I update the SIP version to the last 4.13.2.

Now the SIP error was gone, but another error there is . :(

Perhaps qgis don't like the last version of SIP ?

Hi Pedro,
your problem is very like to this: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5364

It sounds like a problem of SAGA lib!

Also, have a look to /home/sam/sextante/sextante_qgis.log!

Furthermore, I suggest to move all the plugins' About dialog boxes
into the main Help menu: 

 Help->Plugins->About plugin X

Help->Plugins->About plugin Y
 Help->Plugins->... 

Another suggestion
is to make standard that the plugin GUI includes a "Help" or "About"
button. 

Now, to come back to Paolo layout idea, what about (it is what
I'm using for my plugins!!):


+--------------------------------------+
| PLUGIN NAME |
| author |
|
|
| version |
| date |
| |
| Plugin purpose line 1 |
| Plugin purpose
line 2 |
| Plugin purpose line 3 |
| ... |
| link to the help
page|
|--------------------------------------|
| legalese blahblah
|
|--------------------------------------|
| Close
|
+-------------------------------------+

 An example is at:

Hi,

I agree with Paolo's idea, we definitely need more consistent
About dialogs. Regarding two menu items (About and Help)
I think it is better to have only About dialog with button to
open help browser

Subject: [Qgis-developer] No-Data-Value and 3-band rasters: a bug?
Message-ID: <c27415530e60df7db998e566c5fbfffd@bc-consult.com>

Hi Devs,

On 3-band (RGB) byte rasters, if I set the no-data-value to 255 using 
GDalTools (translate) then the white [255,255,255] colour is effectively 
set as transparent, This is OK.

But, any other colour that has 255 in either its R, G or B value (e.g. 
[255,0,0]) is also set to transparent. Is it the expected behaviour or 
is it a bug?

The raster, once imported into QGIS shows:
  - 255 in the "no-data-value box"
  - 255, 255, 255, 100 in the "transparent pixels list"

If I change the "no-data-value box" to -32000, everything is displayed 
as I expect it to be!

Using master version from last week from OSGeo4W on Win7 machine.

Regards,
Benoit

Hi,

I try it, but the error is still here. :(

I'm using python 2.6 . perhaps QGIS-Server has lost compatibility with
python 2.6 ?

Hi Viktor,
I find your proposal very interesting. I've worked a lot on GRASS where
data structures are topological, and with ArcGIS GeoDB where topological
rules can be defined to keep geometrical integrity. I feel that this kind
of tools are foundamental to supply sound data management.
As you know Qgis supports basic topological controls for editing, but what
we miss is something like the validation tools that we can find in
OpenJUMP, or JCS (Java Conflation Suite) [1] .
I feel that your project could help also in the direction of geometrical
validation for a single layer.

I think a reference data model for your project (like OGC/SFS, TC211,
SQL/MM) should be provided.

One question/suggestion: is it possible to have some kind of
link/coordination between GSoC projects? I am saying this because the
main aim of the " Orfeo Toolbox backend for the Sextante framework in
QGIS" one is to improve SEXTANTE and add new tools to it, but it would
be a bad idea not to try to incorporate the result of other ones line
"Vector Layer Generalization for QGIS" or " QGIS tool for vector data
merging" into SEXTANTE as well. If, as we discussed in Lyon, the idea
is to try to have a common place for all analysis tools, it is not a
good start if new proposals of analytical tools do not get included in
that common framework.

I will be more than pleased to help whoever works on those
projects(mentors and students), in order to have the routines and
methods incorporated as SEXTANTE algorithms as well. It might be some
extra work, but i think it is worth the effort.

Regards

While I think that is a good idea in general.  I don't, personally, think
it applies in this case.

- Vector Layer Generalization for QGIS
 From what I understand of the proposal, it will be a more lower level core
QGIS thing.  Implemented at the rendering/fetching level into to speed up
vector layer drawing.  Not really a post process step.

-QGIS tool for vector data merging
This should be more core IMO too. While I love SEXTANTE, and what is being
done with it, I don't think this is analysis per sa.  IMO it would be
implemented in core C++ and have a public API in order to wrap it into
a SEXTANTE plugin in Python.  As QGIS already has a semi-decent merge tool
I don't see this proposal as a lot of work - mainly merging of objects
might be a problem.

Hi Andrea

If you are doing the compilation to use QGIS server, you might disable 
compilation of the bindings (set WITH_BINDINGS to OFF).
QGIS server does not use python at all (python is for the desktop).

Marco

that was exactly what i tried to say :-) That extra effort I mentioned
is just that public API and that wrapper. But it would be good to try
to have all analysis tools wrapped somehow, to make the analytical
side of QGIS more compact and homogeneous. i was basically encouraging
people to create SEXTANTE wrappers or at least thinnk about that when
designing their tools :-)

I, once again, remind that I will be pleased to work on that and help
people who work on such analytical plugins.

I am thinking about wrapping the Statist plugin, keeping its nice GUI,
which will be a perfect example for showing how to do that and enjoy
the advantages of SEXTANTE (such as, for instance, being able to use
the value of one of the generated statistical values as input for
another algorithm in the modeler). Hope to have it ready soon.

Hi,

setting WITH_BINDINGS = OFF
will resolve the problem.
:)

As information,
To compile qgis-server (only server) , actually set this options:
WITH_DESKTOP OFF
WITH_MAPSERVER ON
WITH_BINDINGS OFF

Regards,

Hi all,

now SEXTANTE has several backends and more backends are under
development. Most of this backends (like fTools, mmqgis and others)
are distributed within SEXTANTE core plugin. Maybe it is better to
rewrite them a bit and distribute as separate modules, so peoples
will install only required backends? Opinions?

that is a question that should be discussed.

Algorihtm providers in SEXTANTE can be turned off, so I would prefer
to have them all together, since the size is rather small, and to
activate them within SEXTANTE.

However, there is already a mechanism for creating plugins that
connect their algorithms into SEXTANTE, for those who prefer to
develop them outside of SEXTANTE and distribute them separately as
well.

As I said, in the case of small plugins, it should not be a problem to
include them in SEXTANTE. The main issue I see is related to providers
using external apps and how to distribute them. I think that this
should also be discussed.

For now, I will keep all the backends and algorithms that I develop in
one single plugin along with the SEXTANTE core. If other developers
want their algorithms also included there, just tell me. And if
someone creates its own provider as an external plugin, it should be
clearly stated that it requires SEXTANTE, so people can install it in
advance and also can search for SEXTANTE-based plugins.

Regards

Hi,

I just updated the categories name to differenciate between backend 
related issues and pure sextante issues.

I personnally don't like "General", does not really mean anything.
Do we miss a "Core" category ?
Any better proposition ?

Julien

Core or Framework sound good to me. It should be something easy for
tester to decide where to put a bug

Hello all,

the ranking discussion should not have been made public, as mentioned
in the soc list email...

Please finalise the ranking list, and send it to me in a private mail.
Thanks!

Hi,

Does the Qgis plugin system support dependency between plugin ?


Now that there is (already !) a lot of backends integrated directly into 
the core plugin, I guess there will be more and more people proposing 
improvements. I think moving to a DVCS would help, so that people can 
"pull-request" you, with all the advantages of dvcs : lower down patch 
work for you, honor contributors in the code base by preserving 
authoring, help for work on more mid/long-term feature before 
integration into your reference repository, etc...
If my understanding is ok, the redmine instance can host a git 
repository, at the cost of two mouse clicks.
Victor, others, what's your opinion on this ?


About integration of the binaries, as discussed at the HF, I'm afraid 
this would be impossible to maintain. Probably even impossible to do at all.
It makes no sense on linux where the habit is to install software 
system-wide through the package manager.
My opinion is that it is a packager-related issue, and should not 
interfere with the plugin deployment.
Even for windows, a package can be a bit more than just a zip to unzip. 
You'll be reimplementing osgeo4w-setup inside your plugin if you take 
that road.

For windows, I see there is already a "qgis-grass-plugin" osgeo4w package.
Maybe there could be a qgis-sextante-providers package, sort of virtual 
package depending on all the necessary packages for sextante backends ? 
Then, if it proves usefull and stable enough, it could even be 
integrated in the standalone qgis installer so that people downloading 
qgis out of osgeo4w also can get saga/otb/... easily ?
Someone would need to step up to provide and maintain a saga osgeo4w 
package [1]. The rest of the current sextante backends are already packaged.
Such "sextante" virtual package is something which is doable on 
Debian-based distros (I don't know anything about non-Debian-based linux...)

Thanks Martin.

    my observed data ( some station ) has value zero at a time, and has NO
value ( NULL ) at another time.
    I create a timebar slider to show value of a station on certain time.
    If that station has no value at that time, it show NULL symbol, not ZERO
symbol.
    
    So... maybe I can remove NULL value feature.
    Or I can make some change to the attribute table which has NaN (NULL).
    maybe get dataset's data range, then fill NULL with certain value that
excluded this range
    then give value a symbol to identify NULL, and set RangeListItem's label
to represent

    Thanks Martin again :)

AFAIK there is no such support, but this easily can be solved at plugin
level. For example, SAGA module interface plugin needs QGIS Processing
Framework plugin and check in __init__.py for this module using try-except
statement

try:
  import saga_api
except ImportError:
  PyQt4.QtGui.QMessageBox.warning(window,
      window.tr("Could not find SAGA python bindings"),
      window.tr("<html>Could not find the Python bindings for "
                "SAGA, which are required to run the this plugin.<br/>"
                "See instructions on how to install them in the "
                "<a href=\"https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki/"
                "How-to-install-the-SAGA-Python-Bindings\">"
                "QGIS SAGA interface wiki</a></html>"))
    raise ImportError("Missing SAGA")

Same approach can be used for SEXTANTE.

I also support this idea. This can be also github not only redmine.

All external binary packages should be installed ONLY by user using system
package manager (or installer). IMO, SEXTANTE itself should only provide
interface for this programs. If necessary backends can check for required
binaries/bindings on start and show message when this binaries/bindings are
missed.

Well, I think SEXTANTE with some backends should go into QGIS core. All other
backends can be available as additional modules in plugin repo.

Hi all

And core plugins that ship with the QGIS code should remove the about 
dialog (currently gdal tools and db manager).
For third party plugins it is ok.

No problem :) just use private osgeo gsoc mentors list, that has been
created primarily for ranking discussions.
https://groups.google.com/osgeo-gsoc-mentors

Almost all mentors are registered, only few are missing. Mentors
registered in the list can see the full list of mentors, unlike in
Melange. 
I apologise if this missing information has caused delays in ranking
procedure.

Cheers,
Anne

already tested,
unfortunately the above build works for the Home Range plugin but does
not for the ManageR and SDA4PP ones.

in any case, rpy* proved a fragile solution, that's why I suggested
porting it to pure R scripts, and use Sextante as a GUI

JFYI,
I have extended QgsDataSourceURI with some generic methods setParam,
param, hasParam, encodedUri, setEncodedUri. QUrl is used to
encode/decode the URI.
I have used the new  QgsDataSourceURI for WMS so that various WMS
related hacks in QgisApp and QgsRasterLayer, browser etc could be
removed.

I think it is a good idea - perhaps agree on a common interface and
add it to the plugin builder?

This might have been discussed before - but it would be nice to have a
base "QgsPlugin" python class that all plugins would inherit from and
implement this kind of standardization, but I'm not sure if this would
be easy to work with.

Message-ID: <000001cd1cdd$8d03d080$a70b7180$@wanadoo.fr>

Hi,
I remember that french MEDDT, at QGIS day Paris-D?fense, tell us they have developed a little tool to convert mapinfo projects (.wor) to .qgs!?
They have said that they will give it to the community...
Many people and students cannot migrate easily to QGIS because they have worked several years with mapinfo, and ' like to keep their projects!!
I've begun to write a wor2qgs, but it will be better to share our sources!?
Anyone have their contact??
Regards

Fred (sorry, sorry, i could not come to Lyon...grrrrrr!)

Right, it would need some kung-fu across QGIS-GEOS python bindings. It
was never really a top priority for me since QgsGeometry exposes the
most important GEOS geometry algorithms.

That's probably the easiest thing right now. Internally, QgsGeometry
is by default stored in WKB anyway.

I would like to extend it, to include the linearref methods exposed by the
C API:
 - GEOSInterpolate
(- GEOSInterpolateNormalized)
 - GEOSProject
(- GEOSProjectNormalized)

and other buffer methods like GEOSSingleSidedBuffer

That's probably the easiest thing right now. Internally, QgsGeometry

For now I will use the geos_c lib throug ctypes, but supporting some more
GEOS C/API methods directly from C++ would remove a lot of overhead and
would speed up performance, obviously.

Hi All

Please note as per my previous email that we are now in feature freeze in
*master*. String freeze is not yet in effect as we still need to update
various text in the UI, but I encourage translators to start with
translation now if possible.

Since most of this 'about' information is in either the plugin's
__init__.py or metadata.txt file, I put together (as a proof of concept) a
quick Python plugin to generate a menu of active plugins, which, when
clicked, shows an About Plugin dialog with textBrowser widget [0][1][2].

The About Plugin dialog only shows the following basic info: name, version,
qgisMinimumVersion, description. These are the base fields in Plugin
Builder's __init__.py file. Currently, metadata.txt fields are not parsed
in this proof-of-concept version.

Caveat: parsing metadata, whether from __init__.py or metadata.txt files,
could present difficulties for translating. I'm not sure how metadata.txt
would have a translation setup.

My point with this plugin is to show only a minimum more may be needed (or
required of plugin developers) to create an About Plugins style menu.

I have built a solution for standardization of displaying help and
tutorials within plugins, but will post as a different topic.

@Etienne, I agree, a base "QgsPlugin" python class would be a nice starting
point for many standardizations.

This is a good point: we don't have already find a way to translate
metadata text fields, anyway, I think that using metadata.txt
(__init__.py is deprecated) for all common plugins informations would
allow us to show those informations in the plugin web application and
to expose them in the xml web service.


+1 for using metadata.txt for plugin description, "about" and all
other textual common informations regarding the plugin.

I am very sorry,
I have missed your previous mail about 1.8 release (not being
interested in 1.8), I have just checked with git branch that
release-1_8 branch exists so that I can commit to master.
Unfortunately the d637c677 introduced more API breaks related to
adding of WMS layers
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/API_changes_for_version_20

So what should I do, revert the changes?

Hi Fred, 
plugin, description and sources are described in this extranet site:
http://extranet.geoinformations.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/extension-openwor-version-beta-a1792.html 
login and password are given in connection window. 

or there:
http://piece-jointe-carto.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/NAT002/QGIS/plugins/plugins.xml
(no login but no description)

Anyway, that plugin is good to help reopen layers with similar styles, but
can't reproduce a complet .wor.. 
For me, as datasources changed to postgis, it is faster to build again maps
from scratch. 

You should contact the author directly and ask for a deposit in qgis
repository

Hi all

I think that now that SEXTANTE is having a lot of activity in its QGIS
version, it might be a good idea to separate it from the Java version.
Although the apps are almost the same and have the same name, I think
it is good for each one to have a separate place, and make that clear
in our main website.

I was thinking about opening a GIT repo at the hub.qgis.org site, but
would like to hear your opinions about it. I am more or less new to
GIT, so maybe someone with more knowledge can guide me in this so we
can upload it without losing the history of changes. Also, if anyone
feels like doing it, I wouldn't mind a bit of help :-) I think that
getting SEXTANTE as a project of the QGIS community is the way to go,
so adding more people (other than me) to its management is what i
would like to do

+1 to moving to git.

I however would put the main repo on GitHub as it is more feature rich, has
pretty cool project web page feature, and is good for handling
contributions from other people better then what hub.qgis.org is.

And is neither opensource and may have downtime or security problems we won't 
be able to have a gripe on...

Why not having an official repo on hub.qgis.org, and people can clone it on 
github if they want, merges being applied to hub.qgis.org ?

And bytheway, would that be an opportunity to rename the plugin to something 
more generic like ?QGis geoprocessing framework? ? And get rid of the upper 
case name which is not really HIG-compliant ?

Good idea to extend the QgsGeometry API.

Ehm, please call it OffsetCurve (single-sided buffer was a wrong name,
and means a buffer on a single side [areal result]).

Why don't you extent QgsGeometry API ?

I prefer the hub.qgis.org, since my main aim is to put it where the

I was thinking of changing the name of the main menu to somethiing
like "analysis".
However, I cannot change the SEXTANTE name. SEXTANTE stands for
"Sistema EXTreme?o de AN?lisis TErritorial", and it is being payed by
the goverment of the Extremadura region in Spain. I guess they will
want to keep their name and identity...or otherwise remove the
fundings that allow me to work on it...

I do not see a problem anyway. Just like the email client in Mozilla
is called Thunderbird, the processign framework in QGIS can be called
SEXTANTE. As I said, renaming the main menu name can be a good idea to
make it easier for users to find it, but then I would like to keep
then "SEXTANTE toolbox", "SEXTANTE modeler", etc, menu entries

 From SEXTANTE / Java / SVN  / googlecode
 To   Qgis Geoprocessing Framework  / Python / git  / qgis.org

Now, _this_ is Easter :D

Because I'm not so much experienced with C++, and I'm scared :D
But this could be a good occasion to get back to it ;)
I will extend it on my github fork and send a push request as soon as I
have it.

Official QGIS git repository is on GitHub, I would recommend you to
use it too. The site hub.qgis.org is used for bug tracking.

In future I would love to see SEXTANTE core (framework) included
directly in QGIS instead of being just a plugin that users need to
install from a repository. E.g. to have a qgis.sextante python module
next to qgis.core and qgis.gui. That would also simplify the current
situation of plugins requiring another plugin. Only 3rd-party
algorithm providers (e.g. saga, otb, ...) would need to be installed
by users. Would that work for you or do you prefer to keep working on
it separately?

Martin

Yes I was going to suggest the same - just drop it straight into the
core repo after 1.8 is done and then it will have maximum eyeballs on
the code.

+1 Also to call the menu item 'Analysis'

Ok, great

Then I will keep on developing it in our SVN like until now, and once
it is more or less working and you have 1.8 done, we switch the code
from one place to the other.

thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Error when using pyuic4 on Windows 7
Message-ID: <1334762600058-4894647.post@n6.nabble.com>

I was going to try and start to develop a plugin using this 

http://www.qgisworkshop.org/html/workshop/plugins_tutorial.html

and 

http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/plugins.html

but when I try to compile the UI file I get an error, see below:

    import optparse 
ImportError: No module named optparse 

I am using QGIS 1.7.4 on a Windows 7 64bit.  I used the Plugin Builder to
create all the necessary files.  I haven't written any other code yet. 

Thanks for you help.

No need to apologise we are changing the playing field under your
feet. Yes if you could revert your API breakages and then reapply them
after 1.8 is released that would be perfect.

I am going to delete the 'old' 1.8 branch now.

There is a very useful bit of information in the GDAL tool's about 
window. It is showing the _actual_ GDAL version. QGIS's about window 
shows the compiled against GDAL/OGR version.

Already reverted by Jef.
The commit also introduced the new WMS URI format. WMS layers will
fail to load from project files written in the mean time.

Message-ID: <CALCNqkYk+arwMAHc1PE4_hFeV5EhQ4dz-irC3yJwHdBVeAN--Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Does anyone know the appropriate way to connect to the new
QgsMapLayerRegistry signal I added in python:

void layersAdded( QList<QgsMapLayer *> theMapLayers );

I tried:

            QtCore.QObject.connect(QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance(),
                    QtCore.SIGNAL('layersWillBeRemoved(QList<QgsMapLayer*>)'),
                    self.getLayers)

But that doesnt seem to be hitting my slot.

Thanks

tim

Oh but its not a string list that the signal is emitting but rather a
QList of pointers to map layers?

Oh sorry I see I was the source of confusion with my python snippet -
yes it is the added slot I am interested in.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [WebClient] rule-based style SLOW
Message-ID: <4F8FE224.7000904@jena.de>

Hi,

I realized that using a rule-based style makes the client dead slow. 
Normally the log shows a timeout on the server for qgis_mapserv.fcgi. If 
I put the rules into the data source (postgres) and use a categorized 
style the client performs as expected. The slowliness can only be 
experienced when zooming or panning.

I prepared an example (will be probably removed in a couple weeks):
http://map2.jena.de/kartenportal/test?format=image/png&visibleLayers=Stadtplan&lang=en

after loading please activate one of the layers and zoom in on the 
colored area in the south
rule-based style: loads forever (Navigation history brings you back)
categorized style: loads ok

if I enter the WMS request directly both layers load reasonably fast!?

System: QGIS 1.7.4 on OpenSuse 12.1, mod fcgi

any hints welcome

Bernhard

Is it slow also in QGIS desktop app or is it something specific to the
QGIS server?

> if I enter the WMS request directly both layers load reasonably fast!?

Then it is probably not a QGIS issue at all...?

In any case, sharing the project would help - to look for any anomalies.

desktop is fast
and so is QGIS server; compare
http://map2.jena.de/wms/test?LAYERS=Stadtplan%2Ccategorized%20style&FORMAT=image%2Fpng&DPI=96&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&EXCEPTIONS=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_inimage&SRS=EPSG%3A31468&BBOX=4470654.5050516,5638947.4195052,4471988.6271692,5639432.5548208&WIDTH=1012&HEIGHT=368
and
http://map2.jena.de/wms/test?LAYERS=Stadtplan%2Crule-based%20style&FORMAT=image%2Fpng&DPI=96&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&EXCEPTIONS=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_inimage&SRS=EPSG%3A31468&BBOX=4470654.5050516,5638947.4195052,4471988.6271692,5639432.5548208&WIDTH=1012&HEIGHT=368

both are reasonably fast

I have no idea where the problem comes from because on my PC (running 
OpenSUSE 11.4) both layers are fast in QGIS WebClient

what would you need? project and a dbdump? If you are willing to look

Did you have a look at Firebug (or the Google Chrome equivalent) to see what exactly the client is requesting?

Hi

I am having problems signing in to hub.qgis.org to update the wiki or report
a bug. I am getting Invalid user or password. Probably I have forgotton the
password. I have tried emailing info@osgeo.org, but got no response. Is
there someone from qgis who can reset the password?

userid: ipackham

Thanks

Ian

no objections for me to remove the db_manager's about dialog,
but I'm wondering where I can put info about who supported the
development of the tool.

I was sure adding them to that dialog was possible, so I was also
about to add the sponsorship from Silvio Grosso.

Any opinion on how to handle such things?
Can I change the commit message to add those info?

Regards.

Hi Stefan,

the WMS requests in my last posts are from firebug. Is that what you mean?

Yes. 

What do mean by "desktop is fast". Do you load the WMS layer into QGIS or the original project file with the postgis layers?

Putting the information in the commit message seems ok to me.
Another way to give acknowledgment to sponsors is to write a blog

yep, I meant QGIS desktop with postgis layer, just to make clear there 
is no problem with the styling.

Ok.

But if I do the request below directly in Firefox I don't get an answer:

http://map2.jena.de/wms/test?LAYERS=rule-based%20style&FORMAT=image%2Fjpeg&DPI=96&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&EXCEPTIONS=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_inimage&SRS=EPSG%3A31468&BBOX=4470952.2051116,5639101.6991152,4471361.7998382,5639353.578998&WIDTH=883&HEIGHT=543

And some rule-based styled request in the web client are also fast... Strange.

I can help you out Ian, there are a few of us with admin access, though info@ address is usually best bet.
But let's take it off list or ping me on skype, user: spatialguru and I can help you if you are still stuck.

It seems to me every second/third request gets no answer, the other 
requests are fast. Maybe one of the fcgi processes has a problem.
If you kill all the processes with 'sudo apache2ctl -k restart', do you 
get the same behaviour with the newly started processes?

Marco

I get an answer here but am of course sitting closer to the server :)
Do you get an answer for the categorized style?

I think I see yours and Marcos requests here in the log files. They get 
timeouts

Well, I'm no PyQt wizard, but did you try:

Decorating your slot?

    @pyqtSlot(list)
    def getLayers(self, layers):
        do stuff


Or maybe define it in the connection? (i.e. add [list]):

    QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().layersWillBeRemoved[list].connect(self.
getLayers)

Seems QList should be auto-converted to Python list type anyhow by PyQt.


Does the QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance() need assigned to a variable before
making a connection?

Another silly question: does getLayers() have enough parameters?

I noticed that signal is already defined in the API:

void QgsMapLayerRegistry::layersWillBeRemoved (QStringList  theLayerIds)

Are you replacing or overloading it?

If you're overloading it, could PyQt be getting confused by seeing both
signals as returning a list?

Thanks for the ideas - I got it working using the @pyqtslot decorator
instead of the older @pyqtsignature decorator.

Hi all.
Visualizing monoband rasters could be improved:
- why not loading it with a greyscale by default? or with a colour ramp?
- why not adding a dtm colour table (we can take the one
in/usr/lib/grass64/etc/colors/terrain), possibly replacing the Freak out
one?
Small changes, much more pleasant experience for users. Thoughts?
All the best.

All good ideas but we are feature frozen so lets first focus on
releasing 1.8 and then we can do these.

BTW Freak out will go after resampler branch is merged....

Hi

I've managed to convert freakout style to singleband pseudocolor in the 
project file / qml conversion to the new format :-)

I'd like to improve selecting colorramps in the raster resampler branch 
(that would even allow us to add a freakout color ramp for trips down 
memory lane).

Default style: I'm not sure what would be a good default, since we don't 
know the value range at the beginning (at least not without doing a time 
consuming value scan). Do you have any ideas (maybe a partial raster 
scan to speed things up?).

Regards,
Marco

Yes - Julien had a really nice suggestion to implement the following logic:

- on initial load of a raster, generate a quicklook that is the larger
of 1/4 screen resolution or 500x500 pixels by sampling every nth pixel
- generate a histogram from the quicklook
- calculate clipped 2% - 96% range min max for each band
- apply a histogram stretch based on the above
- the histogram could be used for generating the graph in raster
props, and the quicklook could be used to create thumbs and previews
etc
- ideally we should cache these quicklooks and only regenerate them if
the underlying dataset has changed

I believe if we do this we will have fast initial load and the images
(grayscale and rgb) will 'look right' when first loaded (i.e with good
contrast) and it would not be necessary to assign any color value to
grayscales by default.

Tim

Hi,
just my 2 ct.

I guess the more important capability with raster is to open they faster
possible.

I fear calculate all these values on first opened take more time than what
is waitable for the open of a raster.

Perhaps this action should be choosable by settings ?

Of course I see our situation.

Our situation is of more sets of raster (7-800 each set) where every raster
is grey level or true color of 3-400 Mbyte each.
And all these raster are accessible by a remote shared server to our users.
For a total, actually, of about 13.000 rasters.

I don't understand if this new feature could be really usable in a
situation like our.

I've seen in CMakeLists that the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is evaulated to set
QGISDEBUG definition, but there's no entry inside the cmake list of options.
I had to manually add it (and set it to RelWithDebInfo in my case) to

Am I doing something wrong?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] crssync causing build failure on OS X

Hmm, so now some tests run crssync. ... during compilation, executables and libraries are put in the "output" subfolder of the build folder... but the relative links in the libraries here are not designed for the folder structure there (ie @executable_path/../Frameworks/qgis_core.framework/...).  heck, on installation, crssync is not even put in bin/, but in lib/qgis/.

I remember there were recent changes to allow qgis (or tests) to run in the build dir, but I didn't think about it - running any of it on OS X depends a lot on the app folder structure, which is not present in the build folder, and I don't know if it's possible to make cmake mirror an app structure at that point.


P.S. crssync probably hasn't worked even installed on OS X since introduced - I missed it and it doesn't get the library bundling treatment.  That I can fix easily...

I set ENABLE_TESTS to OFF and everything built fine. Who needs tests anyway? They are overrated :)

Message-ID: <CANMJH-vWMaw4sHyV3nMOLd3aW=zcibjpBPns0CZgTdW3WAR7KQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Developers,

I am a developer for OSSIM (Open Source Software Image Map). I am working
on creating Python wrappings for OSSIM and in order to make the
functionalities of OSSIM benefit other open source GIS software users,
particularly the QGIS users, I want to create a downloadable Python plugin
to make things easier in the same regard.

For now, what I have been able to do is create a _PyOssim.so library for
OSSIM (by doing the wrapping) using which one can access OSSIM functions
from a Python console using a simple "import pyossim" statement. Can anyone
guide me as to how should I proceed further towards creating the QGIS-OSSIM
Plugin?
I had a look at the PyQGIS cookbook but as far as I understood it, the
tutorial there seems to be tailor-made for simple plugins whereas this
shall provide a whole library of image processing functionality. Is
something like this possible?

Any help/guidance will be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,

I think the current answer, is that you rely on the user installing
OSSIM and the OSSIM pyhon library (eg. on a linux distro python-ossim,
prebuilt can be shipped with osgeo4w on windows).

That ensure's its on the python path. Then you can write a plugin that
simply imports your lib.


Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alex and Peter,

Thanks for your replies.

Sure, I understood the first part of the process regarding the Python path.

As for the second part, will the plugin writing involve all the Qt stuff
too? Since you said it would simply import the Python-wrapped library os
OSSIM, will the plugin need to handle the UI for every OSSIM function also?
As in, how every functionality of OSSIM will look like and work in QGIS?
Sorry if it's a noob question, I really have no idea about the plugin
writing and am trying understand it clearly.

Kind Regards,
Vipul

So you could approach it that way, where every tool you want to expose
has an interface (could be built from templates), look at the QGIS-GRASS
plugin. Or you could approach wrapping it in the new SEXTANTE plugin the
way OTB, SAGA and GRASS are done.

It somewhat depends on what you're trying to expose and what it needs
from QGIS in order to work.

Thanks,
Alex

Okay, that clarifies things for now. Thanks for the insight Alex, I will

As Alex Said, SEXTANTE is the easiest way for you to incorporate OSSIM
into QGIS.

Feel free to ask me for help, I will be pleased to guide you and
explain you how to do it and how to create a SEXTANTE plugin for OSSIM

All-
??? Dave Burken and Ming Su at GeoEye implemented an OSSIM image provider for QGIS. The primary motivation was to provide OSSIM users a mature, rich UI to visualize and analyze raster and vector data. Users would have the option to use OSSIM instead of GDAL to visualize raster data. 


I saw an early prototype last summer. It was only 1-2 weeks old but we were able to load images and view images in the QGIS viewer (simple ortho-image chain). It looked promising at the time. I have no idea what happened to the code. I think the GeoEye guys were having some GIT issues and eventually ran out of funding. Would be really nice to resurrect it...



Peter


PS. I have nothing against GDAL!! I think its an awesome library. There are simply things you can do in ossim that you can't do in gdal and vice versa. That's why it would be nice to allow users to switch between renderers.

Please also remember that OSSIM is embedded in OTB, currently usable

And yes, an OSSIM provider would be very good to have.

a bit redundant, right?

Vipul-

??? Ideally, I would love to see the following:

(1) Develop an OSSIM Image provider used to render raster data in QGIS. There is a little refactoring required to do this since a lot of the core rendering is hard wired to use GDAL. Dave Burken and Tim Sutton should have a copy of the original prototype. There should be a gui component to this where a user can select which provider to use for rendering (GDAL, OSSIM, etc.)


(2) Implement a visual chain editor for OSSIM in QGIS. For this, you may be able to leverage the SEXTANTE or OTB plugins but it might make sense to have a custom/standalone plugin specific for OSSIM.

I think it makes more sense to have just ONE visual tool, that can
incororate ANY algorithm, and then plug all the algorithms into that
tool, whether they come from OSSIM, OTB, or whatever. That is, at
least, the idea behind SEXTANTE :-)

Sure, no objections here. 

In that case, Vipul would simply develop python bindings for individual OSSIM algorithms (e.g. pan sharpening, orthorecitification, histogram matching, etc) and expose them in SEXTANTE. SETANTE would provide a visual front end to create processing chains. Correct?

Right. That's the point, SEXTANTE handles the graphical stuff and the
integration in QGIS. The only thing the developer has to do to create
a SEXTANTE algorithm is to write the algorithm itself, the processing
part

Makes sense. I guess the only doubt I have has to do with rendering the output from SEXTANTE. SEXTANTE would be used to construct an OSSIM image chain but for performance reasons, we'd want to pipe the output directly to the OSSIM image renderer without having to write out an intermediary file. Hopefully that will all be handled transparently bu the OSSIM image provider.

This procedure would not work well for thematic maps (qualitative variable) but
I think it is reasonable as initial default. Nevertheles, a
qualitative scheme should be
ready for thematic maps (i.e. landcover, vegetation or soil maps). Maybe the
12 classes color table from colorbrewer could be a good first option:
http://colorbrewer2.org/index.php?type=qualitative&scheme=Set3&n=12

Also, median should be used instead of mean and mad instead of sd to calculate
the clipping (at least optionally) as raster layers do have outliers:
mad is just
the median of the absolute value of the differences to the median:

median(abs(x-median(x))

Andrea,

Opening the raster layers very fast but getting a bad visualization
would not be a major
waste of time? This is what currently happens to me: the initial
display is always useless.

If your raster layers have similar statistics and or you want to
display them with the same stretching so
that grey levels or colors are comparable (which is often my case
also, with time series of ndvi for example), a common style file would
be the best solution. Perhaps, in
case a raster style is present, the by default procedure and
calculations could be bypassed. Would this be a good solution
in your case?

Hi Agus ,

I understand your point of view, but i guess is not a need for every 
users. Same users can't wait the 4+ minutes need for the elaboration of 
a raster.
Again because an user could open usually more than 20 rasters for every 
session, I guess this elaboration should be absolutely optional to avoid 
a really big lost of time.

Your solution seem good to me.

We have more set of rasters of ortophoto type colors and grey.
Eachset of colors photo is surely with comparable levels, instead I 
don't know for the gray photo sets.
They are too older (1954 and so on).

Instead for raster cell (grid data) from Lidar:
Just now we begin to merge all our sets to have a full land-cover.
So we are merging 1x1, 2x2 and 3x3 meters cells.
I don't know if this could have some trouble with having a comparable 
set of values, but guess of no.

Surely is not possible to find a unique style good for all the sets, but 
is possible to establish a good style for each set.

You mean a file raster-style in the same folder of the raster set or of 
the catalog file ?
I guess this could be a good compromise to help the use in situation 
like ours.

Andrea.

Message-ID: <4F94EC6C.4060402@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Apparently, there is a problem in dependencies in debian nightly packages.

qgis:
  Depends: qgis-providers but it is not going to be installed
  Depends: qgis-common but it is not going to be installed
  Recommends: qgis-plugin-grass but it is not going to be installed
  Recommends: python-qgis but it is not going to be installed

There is some date problem between 20th 21th.

Greetings

Andrea,

Depending on the number of cells, dealing with > 20 raster files
requires a totally different approach.
Even for visualization, this is clearly a different problem than the
common RGB or multi-spectral imagery.
We cannot deal with 13000 raster layers in the same way as we do with a dozen.

Have you tried rasterlite?

No problem with shp. Master from yesterday.
Anyone confirms?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] --configpath unactive on QGIS master
Message-ID: <dc793707896220cdc3542bc37b926363@enoreth.net>

Hi,

I would like to know if anybody here is using the configpath option on 
Windows 7 with qgis-master (rv991c7ba for me) to confirm the following 
behaviour so I can open a ticket.

We package QGIS with many default parameters to ease the deploying, one 
of the modifications is the location of ~/.qgis :

C:\OSGeo4W\bin\qgis-dev.bat --configpath D:\SIG\qgis\

If I install a new plugin, it gets correctly downloaded in to 
D:\SIG\qgis\python\plugins but when QGIS tries to load it it doesn't 
find it as it is looking everywhere  for ./python except the configpath.

Can't load plugin 'sextante' from ['C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis-dev/./python', 
'C:\Users\morreale jean roc/.qgis/python', 'C:\Users\morreale jean 
roc/.qgis/python/plugins', 'C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis-dev/./python/plugins',

No not really. An ossim integration into sextante makes much sense.

OTB only uses a subpart of the ossim core lib (the sensor modeling aspects)
We do not use all their image-rendering algorithms.

Try setting the environment variable SAGA_MLB prior to starting qgis. EG:
SAGA_MLB=/usr/lib/saga qgis

This is because you use an older version of SAGA than the version
sextante was build against.

You should try running the latest version of saga. I'll have a look if
I can bring it to the backports archive.In the mean time you can just
try to build the version from unstable yourself..Don't hesistate
contacting me if you have any troubles. There are quite some
advantages in the new version:
- export SAGA_MLB is no longer needed. You can still use it though if
you have custom build modules.
- many modules have changed syntax
- it is much better tested on linux

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Vector Layer and geojson protocol - bbox parameter
	?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO4ypZk33DV4w3rW2_fUa69CLBjCr-3mhDg19+t=b8vsmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I would like to use Qgis to dynamically see the data provided by a custom
web service. This webservice excepts a "bbox" parameter and sends back a
geojson containing features availables for this bounding box.
Using the "protocol" option of "Opening Qgis Vector Layer" dialog, I can
pass a complete url, e.g. :
http://localhost/index.php?query=getFeature&bbox=2.2175,48.7896,2.4764,48.928
But obviously, Qgis only gets the features contained in the defined bbox. I
would like to find a way to "tell" Qgis to dynamically set the bbox
parameter on each zoom/pan, etc.
Is there a way to do so programatically, such as with python snippet ? I
think using a memory layer will be one of the first step, but I have no
idea how to go further.
By the way, I do not need a complex feature management, such as feature
cache, etc. Refresh the whole layer on zoom/pan (destroy all features and
get new ones) will do the job.


Thanks for any hint

Michael

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zsn9FnR89Vmn7amMNrfcaqetPFGfgF=yWs6LvkBfgXZQ@mail.gmail.com>

I think that it could be great to have GPS tools in SEXTANTE,
specially to automate tasks. However, I see that it is a C++ plugin,
not a python one. Anyone can help me and tell me how (if possible) the
functions in that GPS plugin could be called from my python code??

Thanks in advance!

It would be nice to add to the plugin output also the date for each

All the best.

Hi Victor

in my opinion the best way to proceed would be to port the basic
interfaces like GeoAlgorithm and AlgorithmProvider interfaces (and few
more auxiliary classes) to QGIS core library. Python bindings for such
c++ classes can be done quite easily. SEXTANTE then could access c++
algorithms via the same interface... GPS tools plugin would simply
register as a new provider with its algorithms. There are more c++
geoalgorithms that are worth porting to SEXTANTE framework:
- interpolation plugin
- raster terrain analysis plugin
- zonal statistics plugin
- raster calculator
- heatmap plugin
- maybe roadgraph plugin (?)

Most of the above functionality is implemented within QGIS analysis
library (without any common interfaces) and the plugins just enable
access to those algorithms.

Another solution would be to add python bindings to the existing
algorithms as they are (and that has been done already for zonal
statistics). But the first solution seems much cleaner to me.

Martin

There is some delay in graphics [1].
Do you have some suggestions concerning Zonal statistics icon?
I will appreciate that.
Remember - there are just 24x24 pixels available.

Hello all,

I've written a piece of code that will search a database for a given point,
and then return that point so we can center the map canvas on it and zoom
in.  Unfortunately, it's not working.  QGIS crashes after the code
executes, leaving no error messages behind.  Is there a better way to
center/zoom to a given point?  I've tried the canvas method
"centerWithZoom" as well, with no success.  (It also crashes.)  I have
checked my coords -- they are in the proper projection (the same as the
mapCanvas) and I haven't reversed them.  Any other ideas/methods of
accomplishing this are greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Hi Aaron,

the code works for me when entering it in the console directly (QGIS 
1.7.1/WinXP)
Maybe there is something wrong with your coordinates? Try to enter 
values for x and y directly in the code and see if it works.

Please remember that also Interpolation and Terrain analysis plugins
icons are not very easy to understand, and could be improved.
Thanks a lot.

Would you like it?
I promise, next time I'll be more imaginative! ;-)

Thanks to Alex for hint!

Hi,

I agree. There are surely more than one approach type to the raster usage
problem.

Surely there is the user that need a thematic map and need a really good
analysys . It need all the statistics to do and so it agree if the qgis to
it by default.
But there is also the user that need a base map for their work. This second
kind of user is principally a vectorial user. An user that work principally
on a vectorial dataset . It need a raster only as base map where apply
their vectorial data. This user tipically is not a power-user for qgis, but
instead it is a power-user for it dataset. It know all of its vectorial
dataset , but instead is a poor user of rasters.
The big difference is that the power-user for thematic raster is able to
understand what it need for raster and so is able to open the porperties of
qgis and set qgis to calculate the statistics. It open properties and set
all he need to have.
The power-user for a vectorial dataset is not always able to understand
what mean usage a raster. So it is not so able to open qgis and remove the
settings that slow the qgis.

This is the main difference I guess should be pointed when plan the
usability of the interface. Think that a user that don't know so well the
raster theory cannot understand why qgis is so slowly to open a raster
rather than other programs so it cannot resolve this slowness. Instead an
user that know the raster theory is able to open qgis and set it to
calculate all it need to know.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Loading WFS layer with multiple geometry types
Message-ID: <4F97CE12.1030400@yahoo-inc.com>

Hi,

We have some spatial data exposed as WFS layers using Geoserver. 
However, every layer has both Points and Polygons (and some have Lines 
too). We don't want to publish duplicated layers just to get around this 
problem. I have also seen earlier, an option in QGIS WFS plugin which 
would list the geometry types in a layer (if there is more than one), 
and let the user add 1 layer per geometry type. I want to confirm if 
this option still exists, and if there is any specific configuration 
required for this.

When I try this now with the WFS layers I have, I am seeing only either 
Points or Polygons. The rest of the data is also fetched but not 
rendered on the map (I could see them in the attribute table). I have 
selected default style as 'Polygon' and Available Styles as 'Point, 
Polygon'.

Any help or pointers on this issue would be of great help.

Thanks,
Sunil

Hi Bernhard,

I tried again this morning (using the Python Console, which I didn't
actually realize existed before your email) and sure enough, it worked.
 I'm still having the problem, but I think I've been able to narrow it down
a little better.  The method actually works when I'm using a push button to
trigger it.  However, I'm also using a QCompleter to provide autocomplete
functionality with a list of addresses.  When the QCompleter is activated
(a value is selected) the program crashes.  This seems odd to me, since I
can tell from the output that the whole method executes -- it crashes some
time after I refresh the map canvas.  I don't think the map canvas refresh
in itself crashes it (logging seems to indicate that that method finishes)
but rather something related to my QCompleter's activate signal.  Any ideas
on why this might be the case?

In any case, thanks for your help...it got me a bit further down the stream.

Nevermind; I found my issue.  I had an infinite recursion that was calling
the search function and recreating the QCompleter each loop.  That's why it
was crashing the application.  Again, thanks for the Console tip -- that
was invaluable.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Dropdown menus order
Message-ID: <4F992F6D.2070207@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Our list of dropdown menus keeps on increasing. I think we should decide
a more predictable sorting order for it. I suggest:

* File
* Settings
* View
* Edit
* Layer
* Vector
* Raster
* Database
* Web
* Analysis (sextante)
* Plugins
* Other external plugins after that (e.g. CAD Tools, Forestry, etc.)
* Help

I think in this way QGIS interface will be easier to use, and more
predictable.
Easy to implement, once decided.
Thoughts?
All the best.

I think this is limited to File, Edit, possibly Help.
But for us, Edit is rather different than for other apps, where it is
more about cut&paste, not digitizing (so mayebe we could rearrange also
this).

Hi Paolo

Until Sphinx don't provide an s5 builder, you can use the po4a toolkit [1]:

$ po4a-gettextize -f text -m myslide.rst -p myslide.pot
$ cp myslide.pot myslide.IT.po
$ vi myslide.IT.po

edit your translations, then generate the internationalized rst file
and convert it to s5:

$ po4a-translate -f text -m myslide.rst -p myslide.IT.po -l myslide.IT.rst
$ rst2s5 myslide.IT.rst it/myslide.html

Remember that you need to use pure rst directives (we are not using Sphinx here)

Hello Paolo,

I am using rst2s5 for all my training materials but there are some issue:
* you should use header of level 2 for each slide. Level 1 is for the main 
title. Level 3 and other are shown in the same slide.
* Some directive are not working correctly (ie :ref: for instance).
*  I create link to s5 html page from an index file (rst convert into html). S5 
html pages are created from the MakeFile this way:

$(RST2S5BUILD) --theme-url ui/c2c slides/1_presentation.rst 
$(BUILDDIR)/s5/cours/presentation_slides.html

So you can just add s5 target into the Makefile to create s5 html page from a 
specific directory (aka nammed "slides" for instance) where you can put some 
files (one slideshow by file).

Am I clear?

Y.

Yes, the problem (as noted by PC2) is that it is relatively difficult to
integrate them in the translation process, so we can probably wait
integrating this material until s5 will be supported by sphinx. BTW,
does anybody know if there are plans for this to happen soon?
All the best.

Mine was just a guess (or rather a hope).
Please ask directly to the sphinx-dev list [1] or write a custom
builder [2], the process is not too much complicated.
I think the workflow I suggested you can be fine for now ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding GRASS modules
Message-ID: <4F9965F3.6040500@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Now that sextante is in full swing, I think reaching feature parity with
the current grass plugin modules (GPM) is a priority.
This is a very easy task:
* check if a GPM is present in sextante
  - if yes, check if parameters match those in GPM
    . if yes, ok
    . if not, change the description file, e.g. [0] in order to
replicate the behaviour of GPM
  - if not, you can add it to the list of missing modules, or add it
yourself.
This will greatly improve the usability, and will make the user
migration easier.
I'm ready to help volunteers, and I'm sure Victor will be happy too.
All the best.
================
[0]sextante/soft/bindings/qgis-plugin/src/sextante/grass/description/r.buffer.txt

r.buffer
r.buffer
Raster (r.*)
ParameterRaster|input|input|False
ParameterString|distances|distances|100,200,300
ParameterSelection|units|units|meters;kilometers;feet;miles;nautmiles
ParameterBoolean|-z|-z|True
ParameterBoolean|-q|-q|True
OutputRaster|output|output

To add a parameter as Advanced (GPM: advanced=yes), just add a "*"
before the parameter (*ParameterXXX) and it becomes advanced.

Hello all,
that is me, and I am very happy to have been accepted to work with
QGIS for this years GSoC. Thank you, org admins and mentors, for
making this possible!

Just like last year, when I ended up doing something a bit different
than what was described in my formal project, my project this year,
while still QGIS- and sextante-related, will probably have less to do
with OTB than apparent from the title, since J. Malik is already
working on that. Looking forward to be contributing to the core of
sextante and incorporating some ideas from PF, instead.

On a practical note, which might also be of interest to the other
students: What do you think is the best channel to publish progress
reports? One option would be to start a blog or similar (where? last
year I used the github wiki, but I think it wasn't too visible),
another to just start a thread on the qgis-developer mailing list for
that purpose.

Best regards,

Camilo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS regions
Message-ID: <4F99688E.6010403@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
As you know, sextante aims at replacing most of the functions of current grass plugin, and much more.
To achieve this, we have to solve the problem of how to use grass regions, a very useful concept for subsetting an analysis or changing its resolution.
The current basic solution is to generate a location on the fly, at the resolution of the input raster, run the analyses there, and export the output. Additionally, one can "Select GRASS region on the canvas" do do subsetting. This works fine, but current grass users cannot use their locations, their regions and their data. I think we need more general methods for them. Optionally reading current grass variables if a mapset is open, and reading rasters, vectors and regions from there, could be a suitable solution. 
Alternative approaches?
I also think we should use r.external instead of r.in.* to "import" rasters.
All the best.

As I'm having to do with topology in PostGIS I'm very interested in the
concept behind GRASS regions. It's interesting that you mention a resolution
as I've been thinking for a while that a default resolution could be computed
given an extent in that the maximum error double precision floating points can
represent depend on the biggest absolute value one may ever want to use.
An extent (region) would then give you these upper limits so to be possibly
usable to compute a resolution.

Is this anything close to what GRASS is using these regions for ?

Yeah, I know this is probably not the right list to discuss this, but
I'm hoping grass people are also here and can help in harmonizing topologies
some more, on a neutral gameboard :)

I guess the concept of region on grass is limited to only the rasters.
It was used to limited the portion where the grass raster analysis was
applied.
It don't work for vectors.

"sextante aims at replacing most of the functions of current grass plugin"

For that it would require that SEXTANTE works on all platforms, which is not
the case with Mac OS X 

I prefer the plugin that can use all the Locations of GRASS

Message-ID: <4F9A47CB.6060805@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
If I understand correctly, the default for manual production is make
pdf. Is there a reason why we did not choose make latexpdf?
BTW, make pdf is producing invalid pdf here:

Error: May not be a PDF file (continuing anyway)
Error: PDF file is damaged - attempting to reconstruct xref table...
Error: Couldn't find trailer dictionary
Error: Couldn't read xref table

All the best.

Hi Paolo

no one still decided, at least me, if to go with latexpdf or pdf (that
is using rst2pdf).

In any case, regarding your error: do you have in your system PIL? [1]

For me the pdf build for user_guide is working well, instead with
latexpdf I have errors, and the process fails.
Will give a look into this later, now I am consolidating the directory
structure for images, in order to have the possibility to have image
internationalization as well

ciao

This is true with pre-existing vector layers, but if you apply a treatment
as r.contour whose result is a vector layer, the result will be strictly
limited to the region

Message-ID: <4F9A8EA1.1070509@gmail.com>

Dear list,
with Qgis 1.7.4 on Windows XP and a Garmin map60CSx I am not able to use 
the GPS tools download from GPS if I use the 'save as' button and 
specify a .gpx file. It hangs. However, if I just type in a name in the 
output file space, I'm able to download the waypoints, and then I can 
save the layer as whatever I want. I assume this is not the way it is 
meant to work or am I missing something? Please let me know if I should 
file this somewhere else.
greetings,
Janneke

Very helpful: Using the flag "-r" (v.in.ogr -r) will allow you to limit the import of a vector file to the current region.
You thus don't need to clip as postprocess but can do that directly when converting.

@strk: Do you know of projects/options to implement the grass topology inside PostGIS2.0?

I use

with_binding = off.

Any hints ?

Thx,

You need to install libspatialindex.

(On Debian/Ubuntu >apt-get install libspatialindex-dev)

or set SPATIALINDEX_INCLUDE_DIR and SPATIALINDEX_LIBRARY to the right path.

Comment:

  I did one general icon for mobile devices (interfaces) and one icon
  related to zoom. Adding pan as an image would decrease redability in my
  opinion, so I decided to leave it simpler.

Thx both,

I was not understand the spatialindex was added just now.

To add it I will like try to compile the spatialindex from source.
So I download it from this link:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/spatialindexlib/support

To compile it , seem is need also the Tools Library,
but it seem not available.

Is the sources of tools library available
somewhere ?

Thx,

Andrea -

First, why don't you follow the previous suggestions and install
libspatialindex-dev ?

Second, that link seems way outdated, you should check out
http://libspatialindex.github.com/ - if you really want to build it!

because the Linux where I'm running the qgis server is a RedHat AS 64 bit.

Of course I could try the centos version if any, but to avoid some mystic
incompatibility I prefer to recompile.

Was there an outcome of these observations and questions?

Has anybody tested it with ArcSDE 10.x (especially under Windows)?

latexpdf seems more picky, and the results seem cleaner to me.

yes, I have it, so it should be something else - I'll try again more
carefully when the sources will be cleaned up.

I think a blog would be a better option. I have been blogging for
about a year now (I write posts less frequently than plugins get their
updates though :P) and I think keeping something like a daily
devlog[0] has helped me look back and introspect what useful coding I
have been doing. Later you may want to write a detailed progress
report as a blog post.

Message-ID: <CAG4NReL-3xESrVziT48BBhVV7z1rgyUC4sMEStUY85oZ_iArKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

Having been an ubuntu user for a long time, I do not like ubuntu
versions > 10.04 LTS, even after introducing the necessary tweaks to
get something similar to the classic gnome. I feel ubuntu is heading
towards simple
desktops for office users, not convenient for technical and scientific
work. Perhaps it's time to change
to another linux distribution.

I would like to know if anybody has experience on installing qgis et
al (grass, gdal, otb, saga, sextante...)
on linuxmint, i.e. would the very useful ubuntugis repo be appropriate.

Also, perhaps some exchange of opinions among linux users of qgis
could make most of us converge
towards the same distribution (i.e., perhaps linuxmint is not the
right choice, debian, scientific linux, or just
remaining in ubuntu would be better), which would be very convenient.

Thanks for your inputs,

Agus

Hi Stefan,
1. I made no progress with the problem of connecting to a remote SDE server (as opposed to a local server, which I don't have access to).
2. I don't know whether Marty made any progress with read-write access and the other issues.
3. After I sent that message, Marica also posted to the forum thread with another question which was not answered.
No, I haven't tried with SDE10.x, either.  Please let us know what success you have though :)

Message-ID: <CAD_XFPuGgM_hb6x_D3T-UAUH8uTXudqoaRZX+VvvmEwLo4igoA@mail.gmail.com>

hello all;

i have the map tiles according to zoom level x and y coordinates as shown
below:

*-5-(zoom level 5)*
*-->20 (x)
    -->18.png (y)
-->21 (x)
   -->18.png (y)*

*-6-(zoom level 6)*
*-->41 (x)
    -->36.png (y)
-->42 (x)
   -->36.png (y)*
*-7-* *(zoom level 7)*
 .
 .
 .
*-13- **(zoom level 13)*

i want to do three things:

*1) *i want to request these tiles according to zoom level x and y
specified by the user.
i am not sure if i can do that with wms xml file since the tiles are
available locally.
so for example if the user double click on the screen i will increase the
zoom level and i will request the appropriate tiles according to x and y

*2) *i want to show the exact coordinates system (lat, log) on the tile
when the user moves the mouse cursor

*3) *i want to add a new layer on top of my map to create markers on a
specific lat and log position

am using c++ language with qtcreator,

i appreciate any directions or help since am totally new to qgis and gis
programming ..

Hi,

The QGIS page on http://www.osgeo.org/qgis would need some updates, such as
removing the link to the forums and probably changing the link from the old
blog to the new planet. What's the usual steps to get our OSGeo material
updated?

Best wishes,

Hello Anita, all,

I logged into osgeo.org with osgeo general credentials, and am able to
edit the page.
I am not aware of a specific procedure for OSGeo materials update.
Shall I go ahead and edit it?

Best!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Config fails on find of spatialindex library
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8H5B_46KMYUFj32NXOO51VmNQPs5Aotq7MnjvPJ-cbBA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Tried building master branch today, on Mac 10.7.3, but build fails when
searching for spatialindex library.

-- Found GSL: /Library/Frameworks/GSL.framework
-- Found FCGI: /usr/local/lib/libfcgi.dylib
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are
set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake
files:
SPATIALINDEX_LIBRARY
    linked by target "qgis_core" in directory
/Users/larrys/QGIS/github-nightly/quantum-gis/src/core

I did some searching and found this change by JEF 5 days ago [0]. Also,
there appears to be no 'spatialindex' directory in src/core anymore in the
master branch.

Is spatialindex library now a system environment build requirement, instead
of internal? If so, where can I get the appropriate library?

There's a header file here (Kyngchaos.com GEOS framework):

/Library/Frameworks/GEOS.framework/Versions/3/Headers/spatialIndex.h

but, it doesn't look like what I should be including.

I see [1][2] is where internal spatialindex support was removed along with
spatialite (which was then readded, later). I tracked down the library [3]
and installed (successfully) versions 1.7.1 back to 1.4.0, but QGIS build
always fails at same point [4] regardless of library version installed.

Yes go ahead and edit the page as you need since you are a

Yes, spatialindex was remove from the source, so it's now an external dependency.  I started working out compilation details for OS X and got distracted :(

It has nothing to do with the GEOS spatialindex.h.

For detecting spatialindex in configuration, I see that spatialindex installs its headers in a subfolder of the include folder, and the cmake find spatialindex doesn't check this.  If you specify SPATIALINDEX_LIBRARY and SPATIALINDEX_INCLUDE_DIR it should be OK.

Once found, I see another problem - internally, spatialindex headers include each other by spatialindex/*/*.h.  But QGIS does not - I think it's previous internal spatialindex had these includes all changed.  ...and indeed, changing the one include in core/qgsspatialindex.cpp to:

#include <spatialindex/SpatialIndex.h>

does the trick.

Hi 

I'm trying to log qgis server messages. According to this thread [1] you only have to create a "qgis_wms_server.log" into the directory of the fcgi executable. 
Does it still work the same way since my log file stays empty even with Debug build type?

Hi Stefan

Logging into qgis_wms_server.log is not supported anymore. A newer 
mechanism is to define the environment variable QGIS_LOG_FILE. But it 
does not work for me as supposed (logging stops after entering the fcgi 
loop).
Anyway, I think it needs a new log mechanism. Because 
qgis_wms_server.log/QGIS_LOG_FILE only worked if compiled with debug 
information. It is however also a frequent need to log fatal errors 
(e.g. invalid layer) in release mode to find out why a setup is not 
working as expected.

Regards,
Marco

One advantage for me with latexpdf target is that we can post process
the output a little - we already have some expertise to do that within
our group and for my own projects I do this e.g. using the wallpaper
style to put a watermark / image footer on every page. I'm not sure if
this is possible with rst2pdf?

I found I did not need to specify these. I didn't have issues with
spatialindex not being found (once it was installed in /usr/local). Seems
cmake/FindSpatialindex.cmake has 'PATH_SUFFIXES spatialindex' already to
aid in that. Note: I installed from spatialindex-src-1.7.1.

Yes, this worked. It was the only edit needed to build successfully.

Does this mean libspatialindex.dylib will need to be added to
QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/lib and linking updated for successful app
bundling, as well?


The built app is useable, but I'm still getting two crashes, under Lion
(haven't tested on Snow Leopard, yet):

1) The networking issue is still crashing on any call to external resources
[0][1].

Typing the following into PyQGIS Console causes an immediate crash:

 from PyQt4.QtWebKit import QWebView from PyQt4.QtCore import QUrl

webviewer = QWebView()

webviewer.setUrl(QUrl("http://www.qgis.org"))

2) Crashes on quit, regardless of having worked in it a while or only
having launched it.

Do you have these issues with your builds?

But now I find that spatialindex has the bug in one of its headers, it's not a QGIS problem.  Hopefully it will be fixed soon.

After removing ~/Library/Preferences/org.qgis.QGIS.plist, for a clean
rebuild of it, QGIS 1.8 is no longer crashing on quit. Just the network
issue crash remains.


Side note: Do you think the Qt image formats edit of '1qt.cmake.in' I noted
here [0] could be considered for the 1.8 release, or would it not be under
the current feature freeze? (not really a feature, per se, imho, just
additional Mac bundling) If you think it could be included, should I submit
a pull request, or would you want to test it and submit the change yourself
(if it doesn't cause any breakage)?

I don't know if we have enough "experts" who speak spanish (yet).
There is an osgeo spanish mailing list (Lista de correo)
http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/spanish

and a Spanish language chapter
http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Cap%C3%ADtulo_Local_de_la_comunidad_hispano-hablante

The only other project that appears to have a spanish language list is
GRASS. Which makes me think gvSIG uses the Spanish chapter list, but
thats a guess.

Hi, gvSIG has their own (non osgeo I think) mailing lists:

http://www.gvsig.org/web/home/community/mailing-lists

I'm not an expert on qgis at all so don't count me in.

Hello all.

I'm Ram?n Carrillo, computer science engineering student on Ecuador. I'll
work on the new GUI of QGIS for Android.

I'll follow your advices. I'll write a weekly post on a blog about the
progress of the project, starting at the second week of GSoC.

I hope to have a great summer working on QGIS!

Regards.

3. script-save
4. gcp-open
5. gcp-save
6. settings

7. gcp-create

Hola,

El c?digo fuente est? en github [0]

En lugar de modificar el c?digo de QGIS, podr?as hacer un plugin. Puedes
hacerlos en C++ o Python.

Si eliges C++ puedes encontrar informaci?n en "QGIS Coding and Compilation
Guide" [1]. Aunque est? un poco desactualizada ser? una muy buena
introducci?n. Si eliges Python hay excelente documentaci?n disponible [2]
[3].

Si un plugin no cubre tus necesidades, lo necesario para poder modificar
QGIS es saber C++ y Qt.

No creo que sea buena idea continuar hablando en espa?ol sobre esta lista.

PD. Soy de Ecuador, igual que t?. Pongo a disposici?n mi correo si tienes
alguna otra duda. He hecho plugins C++ para QGIS antes.
