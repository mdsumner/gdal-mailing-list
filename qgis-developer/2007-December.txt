Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with large attribute tables
Message-ID: <20071201130729.0eb164d7@nature>

Hi, 

I tried to open the database table of a very large shape file.

dbf -> 770 MB
shp -> 384 MB
shx -> 7   MB  

Loading and visualizing the file works fine, although it takes some minutes, but
opening the attribute table fails. 

The error message is:

QIconvCodec::convertToUnicode: using ASCII for conversion, iconv_open failed
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc
Abgebrochen (core dumped)

When I generate a stacktrace, all it says is: 

#0  0xffffe410 in ?? ()
Cannot access memory at address 0xbf8e8520

Before I write a bug report I would like to ask if maybe someone else has
similar experiences. I thought it might be an encoding problem first, but I
checked and the encoding of the shape file is utf-8 and my system encoding, too.

kind regards,
 Otto

Hi Otto,

The problem is that you run out of virtual memory (RAM and swap partition are 
full) and so the bad_alloc exception is thrown.
In the short run we should add a try/catch block and in the long run not read 
all the rows into memory. Please write a bug report about it.

Regards,
Marco 

Maybe we should

While other have reportedly done this, I'm getting the following error

It looks to me to be a problem with the moc generated file not being  
linked in the qgis library, but I can't seem to trace the cause. I  
suppose it could be in the sip code as well.

The exception catching is in svn now. Though I didn't test it because it seems 
to take a very long time until virtual memory is really finished (delayed by 
swapping actions of the os).

Hi

This is really a side effect of ticket

https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/135

The table display needs to be redesigned to use qt interview
framework. I have some in progress work to do this, and martin has
been doing some similar work in python.

Regards

Tim

Hi Gary,

I haven't seen such message before, but actually I haven't tried to
build qgis with bindings with MSVC.
Couldn't be this just a broken build? Rebuilding doesn't help?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS Edit very slow when on the projection enabled
Message-ID: <47544974.4050603@o2.pl>

Hi

Unless OTFP to a metric CS is enabled, area and distance
measurements are forced in degress. Also the map scale
displayed in the bottom-right corner of QGIS window changes
while panning then (which I guess is normal as it impossible
to have a constant scale in degree-based CS).

The above are good reasons to have OTFP enabled most of the
time, even if you actually don't want to reproject your
vectors on the fly (ie. you have to set project CS to match
your data CS and set OTFP on). However, a major negative
side-effect is that GRASS Edit gets extremely slow with OTFP
enabled, even when the CS of your vector data and the
project are identical.

Is it currently possible in QGIS to have working area,
distance and scale measurements in metric units, along with
GRASS Edit working fast enough? If not, I'd say it's a
defect. Should I report it to tracker?

QGIS SVN head 7709.

No extensive testing, but shell does now come up and accept keyboard  
input without spawning general qgis actions from shortcuts in rev 7709.

Thank you very much for working on this! I look forward to more  
testing and general usage of the now functional grass shell in qgis.

Hi there,

any opinions about http://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/843?   Should a
static PostgreSQL dependency be introduced to the GRASS plugin?

Hi J?rgen, Horst and Leonardo, 

J?rgen, I tested your fix for #843 in Revision: 7711 for public schema and it
works fine - thanks!

@Horst D?ster and Leonardo Lami: can you also test to import PostGIS data with
schemas different from public into GRASS with the current qgis svn? Would be
great if this problem is fixed now.

kind regards,
 Otto

Hi list
I'd like to use r.in.xyz from a python plugin in the aim to extract the
x,y,z values of a tiff dem file to an ascii file. I know that grass tools
aren't supported yet in PyQGIS, but i'm going to call directly the
r.in.xyz.exe of the grass directory with an os command. I have actually two
questions

How can set any loaded dem layer as the current layer to work with ?

Can I specify arguments into a os.system command as in a traditionnal grass
command
os.system('r.in.ascii.exe') input=~/CURRENT LAYER  output=rast

Which python syntax or os command must i use to do that ?

Many Thanks 4 answers

There should be a python equivalent call to this:

mpMapCanvas->setCurrentLayer(0);

The parameter being the index of the layer in teh canvas that you want
to be active.

I dont know python but since I guess you are using PyQt, isnt QProcess
available to you? With qprocess you can pass arbitary arguments to the
command - see docs at

http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qprocess.html

Hope that helps a little...regards

Dear all,

I am participating in the planning for a long-term project which (if the
proposal gets accepted) may come up with a budget to pay for
some QGIS extensions.

There will be a heavy focus on surveying data in 3D.

My question is: in how far is the QGIS kernel prepared to deal
with 3D vector data? Are the data structures in place and does
QGIS maintain Z coordinates or do they get discarded?

Best wishes,

Benjamin

Looking at e.g. the ogr provider, the data for a point for example
gets read in as an OGRPoint which includes support for z values.

http://gdal.org/ogr/classOGRPoint.html

e.g. in teh ogr provider:

 489         OGRPoint* p=new OGRPoint();
 490         p->importFromWkb(wkb,1+sizeof(int)+2*sizeof(double));
 491         err = feature->SetGeometry(p);

however other places in the code dont persist Z data e.g. from QgsGeometry:

  95 QgsGeometry* QgsGeometry::fromPoint(const QgsPoint& point)
  96 {
  97   GEOS_GEOM::Coordinate coord = GEOS_GEOM::Coordinate(point.x(),
point.y());
  98   GEOS_GEOM::Geometry* geom = geosGeometryFactory->createPoint(coord);
  99   QgsGeometry* g = new QgsGeometry;
 100   g->setGeos(geom);
 101   return g;
 102 }

I think that some work would be needed to go through all providers and
make sure they are retrieving Z data where available. Additional work
would be required to ensure the Z property is set in geometry class.

I think this is quite do-able...others who are closer to the vector
code please correct me if I got anything wrong above...

Hi Benjamin,

currently there isn't support for Z coordinates - as our class
QgsPoint doesn't include support for Z coordinate. However we aim to
implement proposed changes by the following RFC:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/GeometryHandlingRfc
Then, QGIS kernel will be more or less prepared for 3D data handling
(once also providers get updated to load Z coordinate).

Regards,
Martin

Hi list, hi Martin
Does it mean that it is planned to view 3D layers within Qgis, or do you 
plan to use nviz through grass plugin to implement 3D access ?

Hi,
actually we didn't get so far with planning 3D support :-)
I personally think that once we start to support some 3D
visualization, we will do it natively, i.e. without GRASS. The reason
is that we still would like to deliver full functionality also without
GRASS, moreover currently we have no active developer for QGIS-GRASS
integration. And finally AFAIK nviz is not supported on windows, which
is also important platform for us.

Hi All

Just a reminder that there are just two more days for making changes
pre tagging the 0.9.1 release. I'll be tagging late in the evening
Brazil time on Thurs December 6. Could those people who normally make
packages please make test packages against trunk so that we don't need
to make packaging related changes after tagging. On Friday I will put
out a call for final packages with the aim of making an announcement
of the release of 0.9.1 with whatever packages are available.

Thanks to all those who have worked so hard  on QGIS 0.9.1 (bug
fixers, bug reporters, translators, documentation team) - its really
great to see the combined efforts of the community  cranking along so
nicely! Last count of bug fixes I made was around 66 by the way!

Hi Tom,

Do you remember which strings you changed or at which revision you committed 
the qt_xx.ts files (was it r6461)? I think we should add your qt_xx.ts files 
to svn prior to release tagging for 0.9.1 and I'd like to look at possible 
solutions in the next time.

Thanks,
Marco

Hi Martin,

obviously, there are some major architectural changes in the
pipeline that should sensibly be finished before proper
Z-coordinate handling can be enforced throughout the QGIS API.

I suppose the changes proposed in the RFC are for a post 1.0
version?

Best,

Benjamin

Hi Benjamin,

Yes, the geometry refactoring is planned post 1.0 as it will make fundamental 
changes to the qgis internals.

At the moment, the only 'support' for z-coordinate handling is that the 
z-coordinate is contained in the wkb format of the 25D types (e.g. 
WKBPoint25D, etc. coming from 2.5D shapefiles).

Regards,
Marco

I must have been doing soemthing wrong. Now I can change the
desired units in spite of not having OTFP enabled. Sorry for
the fuss.

Shortly put one has to set units to meters in Project
Properties -> General. Somehow I could not make it work
before. Now it's OK.

Hi Marco,

I added the qt_xx.ts files from Trolltech in r6461 and Magnus added one 
more in r6465. The only class I modified is QMenuBar because it contains 
Mac-only strings which are sometimes untranslated.

Those files are all from Qt4.2. Qt4.3 contains three more languages that 
we use and there may be new strings for all languages as well. Later 
this evening, I will merge my QMenuBar strings into the latest qt_xx.ts 
files and submit them to svn.

I also thought a little about a better place for the strings. I tried 
putting the qt_xx.ts files in a different directory but the 
update_ts_files.sh still finds them. My current idea is to add some code 
to update_ts_files.sh to search for and delete the references in the 
TRANSLATIONS section of the project file after it is generated by 
update_ts_files.sh.

After solving the update problem, we should encourage our translators to 
translate additional qt_xx.ts files and submit them to Trolltech too.

Hi Maris

Many thanks - I will apply it in time for 0.9.1 release. Regarding
your comments about wiki translation issues page, these are certainly
things we should address. Hopefully someone will volunteer to go
through the whole codebase and normalise the strings.

Your translation update was committed as r7719

Hi Marco,

I restored the deleted qt_xx.ts files and replaced them with the latest 
files from Qt 4.3.3.

QMenuBar is translated for most files. I copied "About," "Options," and 
"Exit" to es and sv from qgis_xx.ts. I modified de "About" ("Info" to 
"?ber") and fr "Exit" ("Quitter" to "Sortir").

Hi Shota (cc qgis users)

Probably you should join the QGIS users list for this kind of enquiry
- there are many other users there who have great experiences and
coursework based around QGIS. In my experience the QGIS community is
always helpful and willing to share resources and advice.

Regards

Tim

This sounds good. Could you also place a text file into i18n directory that 
describes the modifications?

+1

Hehe, qgis already has more translations than qt itself :-)

Message-ID: <d368056f0712062125s48f1fdm19bb5c5ff41aa8cc@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers

QGIS 0.9.1 branch is now created and the code freeze is lifted off
trunk. You can checkout the branch here:

svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/Release-0_9_1

I will be making source tarballs from teh branch tomorrow (fri)
towards the end of the afternoon brazil time. Please checkout a copy
and if you need any small changes to support building packages on your
platform get them into the branch before then. Any changes made in the
branch should be simultaneioulslt committed to trunk. Once the source
tarball is created, work in the branch should stop and stabilisation
work should continue in trunk. I will be making the 0.9.2 release off
trunk in around 30-40 days from now. Although trunk is open for
general commits again please remember any major changes should be
carried out in branches, tested via test builds and packages,
accompanied by unit tests and cleared by PSC before making their way
into trunk. Any minor changes to trunk that change the core and gui
API's should be cleared here on the mailing list first so that the
python bindings and 3rd party apps dont get broken.

We would like to welcome our three new committers - J?rgen Fisher
(prolific bug fixing and our  new postgres maintainer) , Tisham Dhar
(windows build magician) and Leonardo Lami (GRASS modules maintainer)
to the development team - we are really glad to have you on board!

We are also happy to welcome some more folks on the documentation
team: Mario Pisa and Carlos D?vila (Spanish Documentation), Leonardo
Lami (Italian Translation) and Eve Rousseau (French Translation).

There are many other people who have sent in patches, filed bug
reports, provided translations and generally helped the project along
- and we are thankful for their contribution.

Please go ahead and create packages if you are a package builder, and
notify Gary when they are ready so he can upload them to the qgis
download site. I will make press announcements on monday to let the
world know about all your hard work!

I (Tim) will make gutsy, etch and probably feisty packages.

Hi,

first of all sorry for my late reply.

I've been thinking quite a lot about the current design and future of
vector providers, database connections etc. The things as you've
designed them can be used well with the current status of QGIS - in
case you will put the new classes to 'app' sources and not to the
libraries.

My vision is that after 1.0 we should improve our architecture for
providers - and make it more similar to the one used in OGR.
- OGR uses 'data source' for a compound of layers, this can be e.g. a
database or a directory in file system. With data sources you open or
create layers
- QGIS uses 'providers' for accessing directly layers, but there's no
abstraction on the level of data sources as in OGR. With addition of
data sources (which are currently equivalent to database connections
in your design) we will add much more functionality which is not
supported currently by QGIS like some generic way to
list/create/remove/rename etc. layers). This is I guess important part
for our future common Load layer / data manager dialog.

The future redesign is the reason why I think that the new classes
you're working on should not go to core library. Once your new
features land to trunk, we will be able to reuse the code when
introducing 'data sources' term to QGIS slang. So go ahead with the
coding, we're all looking forward to see the new features in action
:-)

Regards
Martin

Message-ID: <d368056f0712070541j19eb9ac5tce3424ea5d34fc11@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

QGIS 0.9.1 is tagged and only work to do really on it is packaging and
press releases which we are aiming to happen by Dec 10 2007 (early
next week).

Turning our release machine to 0.9.2 I want to keep the momentum and
reach my release nirvana of a minor point release every two or so
months. The 0.9.1 bug triage was a great success (70 bugs killed!) and
so I've started a new triage page for 0.9.2 here:

https://svn.qgis.org/trac/wiki/BugTriage0.9.2

There are still some low hanging fruit in the bug queue so it will be
really good to get rid of those first. I've also started a new release
checklist:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist0.9.2

and bumped the version numbers and splash in trunk up to 0.9.2. Could
we hold another developers meeting next week to discuss plans for the
0.9.2 release. Currently there seem to be the following possible
feature additions:

- raster transparency branch merge
- diagram branch merge
- advanced editing merge
- qml / default symbolisation (and some vector props dialog cleanups)
- J?rgen was wanting to make some changes to CMake (use only relative
paths for install prefixes)
- I would like to start going through the dialogs and addressing
consistency issues (label capitalisation and writing style, layout
consistency, reduce unneeded popups etc). I wont have time to go
through all dialogs, but I would like to start with the grass dialog
(I've posted some thoughts on this to the list last month).
- anything else?

No doubt not all of the things above will make it into 0.9.2 but it
would be good to get together and discuss what can / cant be done.

Regards

Hi Godofredo

I also had a look through your design documents during the week and
generally liked the proposal. I think Martin makes some good points
below. My only concern of putting it in 'app' is that this
functionality wont be available to 3rd party apps using QGIS libs -
which would be a pity because I suspect in many cases it would be very
useful...

Regards

Tim

Hi

Currently we dont support launchpad. If you look at
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/TranslatorsCorner you will find some
hints to get started translating with Qt Linguist or KBabel.

Hi all,
I made some test on this release and I see that the mapcomposer has some
problems.
I can see the function icons on the top, the help and close buttoms on the
bottom but I can't see the layout area and the general and object men?.
All the center area is grey. So I can't use the map composer.

I see the same probelm in a little older Debian developer release.
I thinked it was a developer versione but when I see that this problem is
present also in this version I write about it.

Any ideas about this problem?

Regards
Leonardo

Hi

I beleve that its just the new splitter Gavin or Steven added. Try to
look on the right of the window for a splitter bar and pull it over to
the left. I had the same problem when the changes first went into svn
and it was resolved by just pulling open the splitter bar.

Regards

Tim

Hi:

Thank you Martin to take time to check the design and plans
for ogr database access I will keep the classes in app and also
I think like you about the architecture for providers, changing to
a datasource approach will lead to integrate easily file type layers
and datases layers.

Regards
Godofredo Contreras

Hi Tim:

Thank you for checking the design. I also want to reuse the classes
for some plugins like SPIT and placing them in app will make difficult
to reuse them, but  at this first stage I think the classes could change a 
lot so is a good idea to keep them in app until they are more mature.

Regards
Godofredo Contreras

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Patch for the WFS plugin
Message-ID: <4759BE1A.5030603@amnh.org>

Hi Marco,

I ran into a problem connecting QGIS to Geoserver. The WMS worked fine 
but I error out while trying to get the capabilities in the WFS plugin.

It seems the '?' was missing from the url. I created a new ticket (#856) 
and also submitted a patch. It would be good if someone could try that 
patch on mapserver to make sure everything still work.

Thanks!

Tim is correct.

However, there is a real bug overseen in the map composer -
label fonts (I mean the labels one sets with layer
Properties -> Labels, not the "Add new label" tool in map
composer) are garbled most of the time in "render" mode, and
unredable small in "cache" mode.

It seems to me that this bug could use the same workaround
which Steven Bell applied for fonts in the legend and scale
tools of map composer. Is this correct? Could it be still
done for 0.9.1, if so?

And - in render mode, the labels in map composer are circa
2.7 times smaller than on the canvas in main QGIS window;
one has to set "Font size scale" to 2.7 in the composer.

(BTW - in layer -> Properties -> Label -> Font, the
"Strikeout" doesn't work - you can check it but it never
takes effect on the display and becomes reset once you press
OK and enter the dialog again).

In theory, yes, the same workaround can be applied.  However, that code also
handles label drawing in the normal map view, so I'm reluctant to change it
on the verge of a release.  If Tim deems it ok, and someone has time to do
it, it probably isn't that difficult.  Unfortunately, I really have no time
at all between now and next Tuesday.   However, I hope to do some more
serious work on the composer over Christmas break.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 0.9.1 Ubuntu Gutsy debs available -
	please test
Message-ID: <681d07c20712072257s6949911brcdb50ab2b431f46a@mail.gmail.com>

On ubuntu gutsy, install via "dpkg -i" was quick and easy.

Thanks for the map composer tip - I was able to drag the bar across to
access the composer - the initially blank page is disconcerting.

I successfully loaded a .qgis file saved with 0.9.0, and ran into some
odd rendering issues, seemingly related to wms?  If i resize the
window, for example by "maximizina and unmaximizing", i seem to go
into a rendering black-hole with the mouse pointer progress spinning,
and repeatably get this error, (though if i save,  delete, and re-add
the wms layer then everything seems fine).

"
Could not draw LANDSAT because:
(Unknown error code from a post-1.3 WMS server)
The WMS vendor also reported:
    Small request sizes are not supported. For tiled access, see
available layers, described at http://onearth.jpl.nasa.gov/tiled.html

This is probably due to a bug in the QGIS program.  Please report this error.
Tried URL: http://wms.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=-106.864872,34.384790,-106.728444,34.517957&SRS=EPSG:4326&WIDTH=251&HEIGHT=246&LAYERS=global_mosaic&STYLES=pseudo&FORMAT=image/jpeg

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Buildbot fails finding qmake
Message-ID: <475A796E.9000605@loskot.net>

Hi,

Recently, the QGIS buildbot has started to have problems with finding
qmake on telascience buildslave.

http://buildbot.osgeo.org:8505/builders/telascience-quick/builds/7/steps/cmake/logs/stdio

I checked and QTDIR is correct.

Does cmake test $QTDIR/bin for qmake?

I'm not sure, but recent problems with QT/buildbot might be caused by
some "big" updated of FC4 packages on the telascience host.
I will check it, however QT 4.3.2 is installed and configured correctly.

Cheers

Hi Peter,

Thanks for reporting this. Afaik, the wms provider checks, if the '?' is there 
and modifies the url accordingly. I'll add a similar check for WFS?

BTW, I also like to remove the 'unstable' warning from the WFS dialog and 
increase the version numer of the plugin to 0.1. I hope there are no 
objections.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] UTF-8 Filenames, SVN, Qt and Macs
Message-ID: <475C9F15.2060601@comcast.net>

Hi all (especially Mac builders),

Since a UTF-8 filename was recently added to svn and the filename is 
also read as text from the AUTHORS file, here are some Mac notes 
regarding the use of UTF-8 filenames and text.

1. Mac users need to define LC_CTYPE to use svn with UTF-8 filenames.
2. Developers should call setCodec("UTF-8") when reading UTF-8 content 
using QTextStream.

If LC_CTYPE has not been defined, you will encounter the error:

svn: Can't convert string from 'UTF-8' to native encoding:

To get past this, define the following (locale can vary):

export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8

There are still some problems but I think they are due to the bash shell 
distributed with OS X 10.4. Installing a newer one is rumored to help 
but you can also just ignore the following:

'ls' will display ?? for each UTF-8 character.

'svn status' will respond with both a '!" (file is missing) and '?' 
(extra file is present) for any file with a UTF-8 filename. This results 
in a 'M' (modified) in the version number even when nothing is modified.

Since the AUTHORS file also contains UTF-8, setCodec("UTF-8") must be 
called for a QTextStream reading the file. Linux reads UTF-8 by default 
but the Mac does not.

Tom

Hi Tom

Thanks for the clarification - I was trying to find a decent resource
that explains the issue since I ran int the problem when testing on
mac to as did others on IRC. How have you defined LC_CTYPE? I tried
adding to my bash_profile but still had some issues. I was able to
skirt the issues by exporting LC_CTYPE in the same line as my svn
checkout or make comand.

Regards

Tim

I define and export everything in .bashrc; all my .bash_profile does is 
invoke .bashrc. I think .bashrc is used in more places than .bash_profile.

You could however simply rename that to Juergen_Fischer.jpg and be done.

Then we must devise a way to map 'J?rgen Fischer' to Juergen_Fischer.jpg.

Or, is one could use

QCryptographicHash::hash(<real name>, QCryptographicHas::md5)

As base name of mug shot. Nice, general, solution :-)

Hi

Or we could rename is picture to match Juergen :-) However it seems to
me to be a general enough problem that it may be worth trying to
resolve since in the future we may for example have developers who
dont have ascii text equivalents to their names.

Regards

Hi All,

A new installer is available with recommended version of grass 6.3RC3  
and the best version of GDAL I could get to work with Xerces - r12630  
in the 1.5.0a (GDAL trunk). Hope it works for you. Enjoy.

Dear Tim Sutton,

 

I still can not compile QGIS head on openSUSE 10.2 platform. Reason is that
I haven't found dedicated latest (minimum required) binary of following
packages for QGIS compilation: 

 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------

gdal-bin libgdal1-dev libgeos-dev proj \
libgdal-doc libhdf4g-dev libhdf4g-run python-dev \
libgsl0-dev g++ libjasper-dev libtiff4-dev subversion \
libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 ccache make libpq-dev flex bison cmake txt2tags \
python-qt4 python-qt4-dev python-sip4 sip4 python-sip4-dev

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------

 

I found http://www.nature-consult.de/software/suse/10.2/ URL, but those
binary things were old version. For example grass version is 6.2.2.

 

Do you know latest binaries on openSUSE 10.2 x86_64 for required compiling
QGIS? 

 

 

Best regards,

Byambaa Mendbayar

Hi Tisham, 

maybe I just haven't found it but can you tell, what database drivers (sqlite,
pg, mysql, odbc) are supported for the GRASS version you integrated? And what
file formats are supported by gdal/ogr?

thanks a lot

Hi all,
I think that the SQLite is very important to be integrated in this release.
I see that the support is present in v.in.ogr command in GRASS 6.3 csv
but it was not present in the QGIS.0.9.1.09_12.

Now i'm going to test the new release!

See you later

Leonardo

Exactly. If you file a bug against 0.9.2, I'll implement an md5 hash. :-)

Message-ID: <d368056f0712100428m42abb0aeg6584280c53272f23@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I would like to simplify things in trac with regards to bug
priorities. My major concern is that a) we have too many categories
and b) the categories are not descriptive enough for lay people
needing to file bugs. Currently we have:

Possible Values
---------------
blocker
critical
major
minor
trivial

I propose to the following changes:
 - merge minor and trivial into a new priority 'minor: annoyance'.
 - rename major to 'major: does not work as expected'
 - merge blocker and critical into 'critical: causes crash or data corruption'

Any thoughts / opposition to the idea? I would make the changes as a
batch update to the trac db.

Regards

yes and postgres, too, because it is a nice feature to connect to PostGIS via
QGIS and import the files with v.in.ogr into a GRASS location then.

You can find test packages for Fedora 8 i386 here:

http://www.silfreed.net/download/repo/packages/qgis/

If no problems are found these are the packages that will go into Fedora 7 and 
Fedora 8 when 0.9.1 is ready.

Python integration is finally enabled in these packages since PyQT4 is now 
included in the distribution.

Let me know if you run into any problems with the packages.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New angular renderer
Message-ID: <475D3F0A.3040409@homann.se>

I got inspired be the eVis plugin (great!) and took the liberty of 
hacking a new renderer, called angular renderer.
With it, you can select a column that determines which angle the symbol 
should have:

Screenshot:
http://img264.imageshack.us/my.php?image=angularif2.png

It's very much like the single symbol renderer, only this extra field 
for determining which column keeps the direction angle.
In fact, my changes should maybe be incorporated into Single Symbol instead?

Looking at the rendering implementation, perhaps it would be good to
make a renderer interface similar to plugin/provider, so that qgis finds
a catalog of renderers? Is this perhasp the same thing that is being 
done in diagram-branch? Don't know much about that, though.

I can see a couple of options
a) Change Single Symbol to include angle.
b) Add another hard-coded renderer for angular symbol (as shown in 
screenshot)
c) Make the interface for renderers a bit more general, but still 
require them to be compiled with Qgis. A new renderer requires just two 
more files.
d) Create a new render DLL interface.
e) Make renderer and diagram overlay the same stuff (no idea if this is 
possible).

The order is how I prefer to do it. a) -c) I can manage myself, but 
d)-e) requires knowledge and stamina I might not possess. :-)

The new test on

http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis_setup0.9.1.10_12_2007.exe

confirm the absence of the driver for SQLite infact if I see the db.connect command by GRASS shell in QGIS I see that the supported drivers are only dbf,ogr and pg.
It is strange because the GRASS version used seems to be GRASS 6.3.ORC3 while in GRASS scv for Linux the SQLite driver is present.

Markus do you know why that?


Thanks of all

Horst Duester just found an small but important bug #860, which I fixed.
I commited it to trunk and to 0.9.1.  It seems that wasn't a good move.
Should I revert that?  Is that possible at all?

I think this is a very good idea. I would aso be useful to set the
default milestone to Version 0.9.2
BTW: a few bugs seem solved now (eg #841, #702), right?
All the best.

Hi !
I think this renderer goes in a good direction
I am personaly trying to find a way to draw arrows for each of my point 
, with the angle corresponding of the wind direction. I think this 
fonctionnality should not be used as a "unique value", "continuous 
renderere", etc. symbol type, but separatly, as it is done for the 
labels : we must be able for example to draw the points with
* a colour depending of one column (eg "boat speed" from green to red),
* a label representing another column (eg "name of the boat"),
* and another symbol like arrows (or anything else) drawn from the point 
with its angle contained in another column (eg "wind direction"). The 
best would be to have the possibility of changing the length of the 
arrow with another column (eg "wind speed").

What do you think ?

A scale dependant rendered would be nice. So, how general should we make 
this?

Is this close to diagram branch?

Good Idea - Ill try to figure out how to do that.

Good I closed 841 and I see 702 is already closed.

Hi

Looks neat! Could you bear in mind that I hope to introduce the patch at

https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/840

in the next release which includes some layout changes in the vector
props ui. I'm still sorting out a last few things in tha patch (pixmap
fills mainly and dealing with non file based datasources) but will be
great if you can make your angular renderer work in the context of the
ui changes I am planning.

Yes that makes sense to me too - so basically make symbol rotation an option
on all renderertypes when they are rendering point symbols.

For dynamically colouring symbols my hope / plan was that we can

a) get rid of the 'fixed' symbols (currently the only ones that allow colouring)
b) implement SVG css and a convention for our svg files to that we can
dynamically colour them

Anybody looking for a bit of diversion? - the above would be a great
contribution...

Those categories will be much more useful. I have always wondered the  
meanings of the categories in the past, but your suggestions will make  
it perfectly clear. IIt might also be useful to have a "Feature  
Request" category at the end to match the filing of type "Enhancement".

Somethings about testing:

- When I open QGIS it say "PyQt bindings missing" and so Python support
is disable

- using GRASS modules the supported driver seem to be only pg,ogr and
dbf. But if I use dbf default driver and I try to import a sahpe with
v.in.ogr or I create, in any way, a new GRASS vector , I see that QGIS
does'nt create the dbf linked table.
So I think there are some problem about general driver database support.

- If you open a GRASS mapset, when you want close it with the rigth
buttom it say "Cannot close mapset. Cannot remove mapset lock
C:/...../$mapset/.gislock. In fact the file is not create when you open
the mapset.

Other tests are coming....

It's not.  I applied a reverse patch. A reverse merge would have been
the alternative.

Hi All,

I may not have SQLite setup in my build environment. It has not been
requested. I will put it in today's builds. I usually make one every day
during the Qgis release period.

Tisham.

To not have the SQLite driver would be sad...

No idea- you need to have SQLite present (including devel files)
to get the driver compiled. But it's known to work on Windows AFAIK.

Using DBF driver, when you open spearfish location and run
eg. v.to.db in GRASS Tools, are you able to select a column
to be populated for any vector, or does the drop-down list
of colums remain blank? I had such an issue with 0.9 on
Windows (haven't tried 0.9.1 as not often I have Windows
handy). Can anyone verify how it works now?

FWIW, I have attached all my notes on how to get support for
SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and ODBC into GDAL and GRASS using MinGW.
I don't know whether all of this is optimal, but it works
for me.

If you find anything wrong or missing in the instructions, please
let me know.

-------------- next part --------------
1. COMPILING DBMS DRIVERS




**** ODBC ****

ODBC support is part of the standard Win32 functionality. A recent version of MinGW's Win32 API should have the necessary header file sql.h. In addition, you need to copy over odbc32.dll to a location where the MSYS shell and the GRASS configure script can see it. On a Windows 2000 system, the library we need is located in C:\WINNT\system32. On XP it is in C:\Windows\system32.

You also need to rename the library to odbc.dll so the GRASS and GDAL configure scripts will detect it. E.g., on a Windows 2000 system, do:

cp /c/WINNT/system32/odbc32.dll /usr/lib/odbc.dll
cp /c/WINNT/system32/odbc32.dll /usr/lib/odbcinst.dll

Note: In order to correctly parse the declarations in the odbc header files (sqltype.h, etc.), the file /mingw/include/windows.h needs to be included in every source file that uses ODBC function calls (especially important for GRASS ODBC support: see notes in ).

Note: Windows' own odbc32.dll is not free software and cannot be re-distributed freely! This should not be necessary, however, as every Windows installation should come with a copy of it. To make sure you do not accidentally re-distribute a copy, you may want to delete odbc.dll from /usr/lib after you have finished linking your software to it.


**** PostgreSQL 8.2.5 ****

Download the file postgresql-8.2.5.tar.bz2 from  and save in the source folder.

cd /src
tar -xjf postgresql-8.2.5.tar.bz2
cd postgresql-8.2.5

In file src/include/port.h: Comment out or delete the line with the definition of the function gettimeofday().

In file src/include/port/win32.h: Comment out or delete the entire definition of struct timezone{}.

In file src/port/gettimeofday.c: Rename the function gettimeofday() to gettimeofday2().

Now continue:

./configure --prefix=/usr --with-libs=/usr/lib --with-includes=/usr/include --bindir=/usr/local/bin --with-openssl
make
make install
cp /usr/lib/*.dl* /usr/local/bin/
cp /usr/lib/postgresql/*.dll /usr/local/bin/ -R



**** SQLite 3.5.1 ****

SQLite is a drop-in replacement for DBF as a file-based attribute data storage that is more flexible and less limited (e.g. no 2GB maximum file size limit).

Download sqlite-3.5.1.tar.gz from  and save it into the source directory. 

cd /src
tar -xzvf sqlite-3.5.1.tar.gz
cd sqlite-3.5.1
./configure --bindir=/usr/local/bin --prefix=/usr --disable-static --enable-shared
make

We now need to create the DLL files for Win32 and install all neded binaries and header files manually, as the ``make install'' fails for various reasons with MinGW:

make sqlite3.dll
cp sqlite3.dll /usr/lib/libsqlite3.dll
cp sqlite3.h /usr/include
cp sqlite3.exe /usr/local/bin



**** MySQL 5.0.45 from Binaries ****

Download the file mysql-noinstall-5.0.45-win32.zip from  and save it to any folder.

Uncompress the zip files contents, below the top level directory mysql-5.0.45-win32, to C:\msys\1.0\local\mysql, so that the subfolders bin, data, Docs, etc. go directly into C:\msys\1.0\local\mysql.

In order to get headers and DLLs to work with MinGW, a few adjustments are needed.

First, the libmysql.def file shipped with the MySQL binaries is missing mangled function names which the MinGW linker needs. Open the file C:\msys\1.0\local\mysql\include\libmysql.def in a text editor and make sure it has the following content:

Now, re-generate the libraries:

cd /usr/local/mysql
dlltool --input-def include/libmySQL.def --dllname bin/libmysql.dll --output-lib bin/libmysqlclient.a -k

You need to adjust some lines in C:\msys\1.0\local\mysql\include\mysql.h. Locate the paragraph that reads:

#ifndef my_socket_defined
#ifdef __WIN__
#define my_socket SOCKET
#else

typedef int my_socket;

#endif /* __WIN__ */
#endif /* my_socket_defined */
#endif /* _global_h */


And change it to:

#ifndef my_socket_defined
#ifdef __WIN__

typedef int my_socket;

#endif /* __WIN__ */
#endif /* my_socket_defined */
#endif /* _global_h */


In C:\msys\1.0\etc\profile, extend the system path to include the MySQL programs:

export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/mysql/scripts"

Unfortunately, we need to do a little more clean-up work so that other software will be able to link to the MySQL libraries later.

Open the file C:\msys\local\mysql\include\config-win.h in a text editor. 

Remove the entire code block that re-defines the function ``rint'' (ca. lines 227-232):

inline double rint(double nr)
{
  double f = floor(nr);
  double c = ceil(nr);
  return (((c-nr) >= (nr-f)) ? f :c);
}

Remove the line (ca. 453) that re-defines the function ``popen'':

#define popen(A,B) _popen((A),(B))

Next, open the C:\msys\local\mysql\scripts\mysql_config in a text editor. This script tells other programs where to find MySQL libraries and include files. We need to fill in some information manually. Locate the lines that define the items ``pkglibdir'', ``pkgincludedir'', ``cflags'' and ``libs'' and change them to the following:


pkglibdir='/usr/local/mysql/bin'
pkgincludedir='/usr/local/mysql/include'
cflags="-I$pkgincludedir " #note: end space!
libs="-L$pkglibdir -lz -leay32 -lssleay32 -lmysql"



2. CONFIGURING GRASS

./configure --with-includes=/usr/include --with-libs=/usr/lib --enable-shared=yes --with-opengl=windows --with-curses --with-cxx --without-fftw --with-mysql --with-mysql-includes=/usr/local/mysql/include --with-mysql-libs=/usr/local/mysql/bin/ --with-odbc --with-postgres --with-sqlite --without-x11

Hi All

By popular request I spent a couple of evenings figuring out how to
get my ubuntu packages into a apt-get installable archive. Now you can
add the following sources to your /etc/apt/sources.list :

# Tim Suttons PPA on ubuntu
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/timlinux/ubuntu gutsy main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/timlinux/ubuntu gutsy main


Then just do

apt-get update
apt-get install qgis qgis-plugin-grass

The archive icludes x64 native packages too. Note you need to have
universe enabled too as far as I know. After doing the above, updated
packages should automatically be installed via the ubuntu update
manager etc.

Regards

Tim

Hi all,

In the long term it would be good to have a new plugin type for renderers to make it easier to add support for special needs in visualisation. Up to now, we have provider plugins, GUI plugins and in the diagram branch there are overlay plugins. A renderer plugin would basically provide methods to return a renderer and a method that returns a dialog to enter the settings for this renderer. The QGIS main application could then (at runtime) look what renderers are available and embed their specialised dialog types into the vector layer properties.

Cartographic signatures may differ in colour, shape, texture, saturation, direction and size and each one may describe a different variable. Therefore I think it would be a good way of code reusing if renderers could be connected such that we have a chain where renderer A sets colour according to variable X and renderer B direction according to variable Y (and maybe more...). I'm also going to ask people at my workplace (we have some cartographic experts here) how they would handle such multivariate visualisation.

In the short time, it could be a general renderer option. As Tim suggests, it could be integrated in the new symbology dialogs in Tims patch? I already tested them and like their layout very much.

>b) implement SVG css and a convention for our svg files to that we can
>dynamically colour them

+1

>a) get rid of the 'fixed' symbols (currently the only ones that allow colouring)

I'd vote to keep them. Because they describe the so-called 'well-known symbols' that are usefull to be compatible with several standards, e.g. SLD.

Marco

Yes that makes sense to me too - so basically make symbol rotation an option
on all renderertypes when they are rendering point symbols.

For dynamically colouring symbols my hope / plan was that we can

a) get rid of the 'fixed' symbols (currently the only ones that allow colouring)
b) implement SVG css and a convention for our svg files to that we can
dynamically colour them

Anybody looking for a bit of diversion? - the above would be a great
contribution...

Hi Tim,

There has been some confusion about what can be commited to the release branch and what not. So I'd like to ask in order to make sure I'm not commiting the wrong things to release branch. 

Up to know I commited fixes and additional translations to release branch and to trunk ("until the source tarball is created"). Is this how it should be?

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco (and others who may be confused)

So the idea was to create the branch and then only commit any changes
needed for packaging to the branch. Once the main packages are created
I will make the source tarball. In reality there should be few if any
packing changes required post branching (those kind of changes should
have gone intro trunk in the run up to the tag date of Dec 6).

SVN doesnt really have a concept of a tag since a tag is actually a
branch that you can commit into too. Since we have had some post
branching commits, I'm going to suggest the following:

- declare a moritorium on further commits to 0.9.1 branch (Ill look to
see if I can make it read only some how)
- get the revision number of the release branch as it stands today
- make a source tarball
- ask packagers to refresh their packages to the fixed revision number
(with my apologies)

How does sound everyone?  It will mean delaying the release
announcement for another week probably while we wait for package
updates to be made.

Regards

Tim

Yes I like this approach you are suggesting (for a post 1.0 release
project) too.

Ok I wasnt clear. My intent that these same symbols would be available
but as svg symbols and the fixed symbols would go the way of the
dodo...

Hi Benjamin

Great -  did you make your edits in INSTALL.t2t ? If so, could you
supply your changes as a patch? Be sure to include your name in the
credits at the bottom of the file too.

> **** ODBC ****
>
> ODBC support is part of the standard Win32 functionality. A recent version of MinGW's Win32 API should have the necessary header file sql.h. In addition, you need to copy over odbc32.dll to a location where the MSYS shell and the GRASS configure script can see it. On a Windows 2000 system, the library we need is located in C:\WINNT\system32. On XP it is in C:\Windows\system32.
>
> You also need to rename the library to odbc.dll so the GRASS and GDAL configure scripts will detect it. E.g., on a Windows 2000 system, do:
>
> cp /c/WINNT/system32/odbc32.dll /usr/lib/odbc.dll
> cp /c/WINNT/system32/odbc32.dll /usr/lib/odbcinst.dll
>
> Note: In order to correctly parse the declarations in the odbc header files (sqltype.h, etc.), the file /mingw/include/windows.h needs to be included in every source file that uses ODBC function calls (especially important for GRASS ODBC support: see notes in ).
>
> Note: Windows' own odbc32.dll is not free software and cannot be re-distributed freely! This should not be necessary, however, as every Windows installation should come with a copy of it. To make sure you do not accidentally re-distribute a copy, you may want to delete odbc.dll from /usr/lib after you have finished linking your software to it.
>
>
> **** PostgreSQL 8.2.5 ****
>
> Download the file postgresql-8.2.5.tar.bz2 from  and save in the source folder.
>
> cd /src
> tar -xjf postgresql-8.2.5.tar.bz2
> cd postgresql-8.2.5
>
> In file src/include/port.h: Comment out or delete the line with the definition of the function gettimeofday().
>
> In file src/include/port/win32.h: Comment out or delete the entire definition of struct timezone{}.
>
> In file src/port/gettimeofday.c: Rename the function gettimeofday() to gettimeofday2().
>
> Now continue:
>
> ./configure --prefix=/usr --with-libs=/usr/lib --with-includes=/usr/include --bindir=/usr/local/bin --with-openssl
> make
> make install
> cp /usr/lib/*.dl* /usr/local/bin/
> cp /usr/lib/postgresql/*.dll /usr/local/bin/ -R
>
>
>
> **** SQLite 3.5.1 ****
>
> SQLite is a drop-in replacement for DBF as a file-based attribute data storage that is more flexible and less limited (e.g. no 2GB maximum file size limit).
>
> Download sqlite-3.5.1.tar.gz from  and save it into the source directory.
>
> cd /src
> tar -xzvf sqlite-3.5.1.tar.gz
> cd sqlite-3.5.1
> ./configure --bindir=/usr/local/bin --prefix=/usr --disable-static --enable-shared
> make
>
> We now need to create the DLL files for Win32 and install all neded binaries and header files manually, as the ``make install'' fails for various reasons with MinGW:
>
> make sqlite3.dll
> cp sqlite3.dll /usr/lib/libsqlite3.dll
> cp sqlite3.h /usr/include
> cp sqlite3.exe /usr/local/bin
>
>
>
> **** MySQL 5.0.45 from Binaries ****
>
> Download the file mysql-noinstall-5.0.45-win32.zip from  and save it to any folder.
>
> Uncompress the zip files contents, below the top level directory mysql-5.0.45-win32, to C:\msys\1.0\local\mysql, so that the subfolders bin, data, Docs, etc. go directly into C:\msys\1.0\local\mysql.
>
> In order to get headers and DLLs to work with MinGW, a few adjustments are needed.
>
> First, the libmysql.def file shipped with the MySQL binaries is missing mangled function names which the MinGW linker needs. Open the file C:\msys\1.0\local\mysql\include\libmysql.def in a text editor and make sure it has the following content:

Hi

I also want to revise those but types some time. Adding a 'New Feature
Request' category sounds reasonable.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add new GRASS modules in QGIS
Message-ID: <FBCMMO02n5WJRE4G6A500020925@FBCMMO02.fbc.local>

Hi,
 
as you can read in the mail object, i need to add new GRASS modules in qgis. Actually I have other questions related, so I will divide this mail in 2 different parts:
 
1. I'm recently using QGIS 0.9 under windows xp; I need to use a module, called r.horizon, developed by JRC (http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/index.cfm) researchers. I have source files (C) and i would compile them to create a GRASS command to run under QGIS. Reading the following article http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Adding_New_Tools_to_the_GRASS_Toolbox, I found how to create a new QGIS GRASS module usging existing GRASS commands compiled for win32 platform, but I'm not able to build my r.horizon.exe starting from source code. I tried using Visual Studio C++ 2008 (Express), but it seems I have problems linking libraries, locating headers, and so on.... So my question is: "can I build a win32 GRASS command on windows using only the resources I find in Quantum GIS\grass folder?"
 
>From this location https://grasssvn.itc.it/grasssvn/grassaddons/trunk/grassaddons/r.sun_horizon/r.horizon/#_trunk_grassaddons_r.sun_horizon_r.horizon_ <https://grasssvn.itc.it/grasssvn/grassaddons/trunk/grassaddons/r.sun_horizon/r.horizon/#_trunk_grassaddons_r.sun_horizon_r.horizon_>  I downloaded source code files: main.c, local_proto.h and Makefile.make; main.c includes the followings:
 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <malloc.h>
#include <grass/gis.h>
#include <grass/gprojects.h>
#include <grass/glocale.h>
 
local_proto.h has no includes, while Makefile is:
 
MODULE_TOPDIR = ../..
PGM = r.horizon
LIBES =  $(GPROJLIB) $(GISLIB)
DEPENDENCIES = $(GPROJDEP) $(GISDEP)
EXTRA_INC = $(PROJINC)

2. I noticed that in QGIS some GRASS commands are missing, like NVIZ and d.3d module; actually I'm very interested in creating 3D imaging starting from DEM rasters (imported in GRASS from ArcInfo ASCII files)... can I do that using QGIS? or should I use GRASS directly via cygwin?
 
Thank you for all your help,

I've confirmed this today on Win XP Home using 0.9.1
downloaded from [1]. *Any* command in the GRASS Toolbox,
which requires selecting an input or output column of a DBF
table, fails to let user select the column - either a blank
dropdown or a 'cat' column alone and all other discarded.
Can anyone say if this is due to QGIS or GRASS on Windows?

Hi All,

Thanks a lot for all the pointer regarding DBMS support building. I have
grass built with ODBC, Sqlite, MySQL and PostgreSQL. GDAL is being more
of a problem and would not link with these dbms drivers enabled. I have
undefined symbol linker errors even if the initial detection succeeds.
Any ideas about fixing these are welcome. Otherwise I am going to
release with what I have now.

I found a problem today when using the GRASS dbf driver from the MSVC
build.

QGIS failed to use the dbf driver and therefore the attribute table was
empty.  I considered this a MSVC problem only, but maybe it's not.

Do you see attributes in the attribute table in QGIS?  If not the
attached GRASS patch might also help with MinGW and fix both problems.

Hi J?rgen

I'm not using Windows. I might have a chance to try on
another box, but can't say for sure. Windows QGIS users
please step forward.

Tisham,

did you read the attachment to my last email?

There are many little annoyances with the GDAL linking.
But they can all be rectified (at least I managed for
version 1.4.4, don't know about 1.5 yet).

I think I left out that final bit in my last email.

Here it is.
For 1.5, you will probably need to update the last bit
somewhat, since I think all user tools are now in the
"apps" subfolder.

Let me know how it's working for you.

Best,

Benjamin


-----------


Unfortunately, the GDAL configure script has some flaws on MinGW which
we need to correct. Open C:\msys\src\gdal-1.4.4\configure in a text editor.

We'll need to fix the check for PostgreSQL. Locate the line (around nr.
21800):

LIBS="-L`$PG_CONFIG --libdir` -lpq"

... and replace it with:

LIBS="-L/usr/lib -lpq"

Likewise, replace the lines (around 21873)

LIBS="-L`$PG_CONFIG --libdir` -lpq"

PG_INC="-I`$PG_CONFIG --includedir` -I`$PG_CONFIG --includedir-server`"

... with:

LIBS="-L /usr/lib -lpq"

PG_INC="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/postgresql/server"

(Note: the reason for this is that somehow the `$PG_CONFIG` statement
does not produce a correct string, so we have to insert the information
manually!)

Use the following line to compile a version that includes all
capabilities mentioned in these instructions (provided that you have
installed everything up to here):


./configure --prefix=/usr --bindir=/usr/local/bin --host=mingw32
--without-libtool --with-pg=/usr/local/bin/pg_config.exe
--with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql/scripts/mysql_config --with-xerces
--with-xerces-lib="-L/usr/local/lib -lxerces-c -DXML_LIBRARY"
--with-odbc=/mingw --with-sqlite=/usr --with-geos=/usr/bin/geos-config
--without-python


Unfortunately, this is not all. Some of the Makefiles generated by the
configure script will be flawed and we need to hand-edit again!

In order to link the system ODBC libraries with GDAL, you need to edit
C:\msys\src\gdal-1.4.4\GDALmake.opt a bit. Find the line that defines
``LIBS='' at the start of the file. After the item ``-L/mingw/lib'',
delete the lib items `` -lodbc'' and ``-lodbcinst'' and add ``-lodbc32
-lodbccp32'' instead to correctly configure the ODBC libraries on MinGW:

LIBS = ... -L/mingw -L/mingw/lib -lodbc32 -lodbccp32

Note: re-running the configure script will reset GDALmake.opt to its
original content, so the changes above must be repeated!

For Xerces support, edit
C:\msys\1.0\src\gdal-1.4.4\ogr\ogrsf_frmts\ili\iom\GNUmakefile and edit
the ``CPPFLAGS'' definition:

CPPFLAGS        := -DXML_LIBRARY $(XERCES_INCLUDE) $(CPPFLAGS)

We also need to edit some of the Xerces-C related source code. Open
C:\msys\1.0\src\gdal-1.4.4\ogr\ogrsf_frmts\ili\iom\iom_utilities.cpp and
rename the _searchenv () function so it does not collide with MinGW's
own version. Change the line (ca. 56):

static void _searchenv(const char *name, const char *envname, char *hitfile)

to:

static void _searchenv2(const char *name, const char *envname, char
*hitfile)

In addition, open both
C:\msys\1.0\src\gdal-1.4.4\ogr\ogrsf_frmts\gml\GNUmakefile and
C:\msys\1.0\src\gdal-1.4.4\ogr\ogrsf_frmts\ili\GNUmakefile in your text
editor and add ``-DXML_LIBRARY'' to the lines defining ``CPPFLAGS'':

CPPFLAGS := -DXML_LIBRARY -I.. -I../.. $(GDAL_INCLUDE)

When all is fixed, compile the software:

make
make install

Finally, edit two lines in the file c:\msys\usr\local\bin\gdal-config.
This is necessary to make the GRASS configure script work later on.
Here, every library that was linked to GDAL as part of its feature set
needs to be mentioned following an -l switch. Make sure that all
external libraries are referenced properly (note: ``CONFIG_DEP_LIBS=''
should contain the same items as ``CONFIG_LIBS='', except for ``-lgdal''
itself):


CONFIG_LIBS="-L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/mysql/bin/ -lgdal
-lz -ltiff -lpq -lmysqlclient -lxerces-c -DXML_LIBRARY -lodbc32
-lodbccp32 -lsqlite3 -lgeos_c"

CONFIG_DEP_LIBS="-L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/mysql/bin/ -lz
-ltiff -lpq -lmysqlclient -lxerces-c -DXML_LIBRARY -lodbc32 -lodbccp32
-lsqlite3 -lgeos_c"

Now, we need to put in some extra work to make the Windows shared DLLs
and link the GDAL tools with them. Note: some of these are very long
command lines. I have put in some extra spaces, so it is easier to see
what commands need to be pasted as one line. First, delete the static
copy of the GDAL library (important: GRASS configure script will
otherwise fail to detect GDAL correctly!):

rm /usr/lib/libgdal.a

In the next step, we do the actual linking to create the shared DLL.
Make sure that you have the gdal-config script in your executable path
at this point and that issuing a:

gdal-config --libs

Will give you a list of all the libraries which GDAL tools need to be
linked against. Now continue building the shared GDAL library and the tools:

g++ -s -shared -o ./libgdal.dll ./frmts/o/*.o ./gcore/*.o ./port/*.o
./alg/*.o ./ogr/ogrsf_frmts/o/*.o ./ogr/ogrgeometryfactory.o

Hi Tisham,
I think this bux fixing is very important because it enables more than
half of the function develope in GRASS-QGIS integration and I think the
rigth way is fix this bug before release the 0.9.1 version.

What other developers think about it?
Sorry I'm not able to find the solution in the problem, but I hope
someone can help you.

Regards
Leonardo

In principle I also prefer the symbols from svg files to the hardcoded ones as 
the svg symbols have much nicer appearance. My only concern was that if 
should be possible to find symbols by (well known) names without hard coding 
file names. But I think there are possibilities to do so even without the 
current code for fixed symbols, e.g. by having the svg text of the well known 
symbols as a string in a source file.

Actually even simpler, we could just put them in a qt4 resource file...

Hi all,

I haven't find how to add new lines to an existing shapefile with the

writer = QgsVectorFileWriter("my_shapes.shp", "CP1250", fields, QGis.WKBPoint, None)

Is it possible yet ?

Hi,

yes, it is. The only changes you have to do:
- use QGis.WKBPolyline instead of QGis.WKBPoint when creating the
vector file writer
- assign geometry with type polyline to the features, e.g.:
fet.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolyline( [ QgsPoint(10,10),
QgsPoint(20,20) ] ))

Regards
Martin

Sorry martin, I made a mistake in my previous question: it is "new 
points" and not "new lines" I want to add
Let me explain my problem with more precision..

I scan a directory containing csv files. Each file contains several 
data. One of the data is "date".
I would like to write a single shapefile for each date encountered 
during my processing..
That is why I would like to know how to open an existing shapefile (with 
data on it)  in writing mode, and then append the new data from the csv 
file.

Example :
A shapefile called 071212.shp exists.
My script open a csv file with the date "071212" --> I want to add the 
data of this csv file to 071212.shp
If I use :
writer = QgsVectorFileWriter("071212.shp"), "CP1250", fields, 
QGis.WKBPoint, None)
it doesn't do anything.

In an short way "Is it possible to open a shapefile in write mode and 
then append some new data at the end" ?

Thanks a lot
Michael

Yes, that's possible too :-)

You can open your shapefile as a vector layer and then use its
provider to add some features:
layer = QgsVectorLayer(...)
provider = layer.getDataProvider()
provider.addFeatures( [ feature ] )

And that's it. I didn't try it now but should work as expected.
addFeatures() expects list of features, but of course you can add them
one by one.

Hi,

Just to tell what Martin adviced works well.
Careful : the
provider.addFeatures( [feature] )
doesn't work with only one feature, but needs a list of features.

Below is a bit of my code to
* create a new shape file if it doesn't exists and add the features
* open an existing shapefile to add some features to it

************
       if not os.path.exists( "myshape.shp") ): # si le shapefile 
n'existe pas
          #we create the new shapefile
          writer = QgsVectorFileWriter("myshape.shp"), "CP1250", fields, 
QGis.WKBPoint, None)
          existe=0
          if writer.hasError() != QgsVectorFileWriter.NoError:
            print "Error when creating shapefile: ", writer.hasError()
         
        else: #when the shapefile exists
          #on ouvre le fichier shape existant
          mylayer = QgsVectorLayer("myshape.shp"), "ma_couche", "ogr")
          myprovider = mylayer.getDataProvider()
          existe=1
        list_fet=[]
        for i in range(0,len(donnees)): #donnees is the list[[]] 
containing the data from the csv file
              fet = QgsFeature()
              fet.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint( 
xform.transform(QgsPoint(longitude, latitude)) )  )
              fet.addAttribute(0, QVariant(local_date) ) #date
              fet.addAttribute(1, QVariant(local_heure) ) #heure locale
             # .......

              if existe == 0:
                writer.addFeature(fet)  # directly add each feature 
inside the loop
              if existe == 1:
                list_fet.append(fet)  # we add the feature in the list 
of feature "list_fet"

        if existe == 1:
          myprovider.addFeatures(list_fet)       #here we add all the 
features from list_fet to the shapefile

Message-ID: <5443A5D0641CB94F8B1EA98218121250EA00B3@EX3.d.ethz.ch>

Hi,

The list of tables in the postgis connection dialog may become quite long for users that have a lot of tables and views. I therefore would like the following extensions:

-Convert the table widget to a tree widget. For every schema, there would an item that can be expanded/collapsed and contains the tables/views of the schema. Like this, there will be much better overview in situations with many schemas/tables/views.

-Add a line edit that takes regular expressions and, if not empty, displays only the entries where the table name matches the regular expression.

Are there any objections or suggestions to this?
Godofredo, does this fit together with the work you are doing in the ogr-plugin-branch and shall I code the dialog extensions also into this branch?

Regards,
Marco

Hi

Could I suggest using Qt model/view for this - whever list become lone
I think the model / view approach will always be more efficient. It
also has QSortFilterProxModel by which you can easily add sorting and
filtering.

http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qsortfilterproxymodel.html#details

I was going to suggest also that we create src/models and src/views
for any custom models and views we create.

Regards

Tim

Hi Marco:

I think is a good idea, but how could we deal with databases that don?t use schemas
like mysql? maybe in this case we could place all tables into public schema.

I have made several changes to this dialog and I have planned some others
I can move your changes later into ogr-plugin-branch after I have finished
with dialog design.

Regards

Godofredo Contreras

Hi Godofredo

One thing I meant to comment about your API proposal was just a
pedantic issue. The QGIS coding style guidelines follow those of Qt
i.e. not using 'get' prefix for accessors. Also normally class names
should not contain abbreviations so QgsConnectionParams would become
QgsConnectionParameters. I know much of the code in QGIS doesnt follow
our own standards ( that will change eventually I hope ) but it is
good to ensure any new stuff does adhere to it to reduce overhead of
getting all the code standards compliant later.

Best regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer]  calling the grass shell
Message-ID: <14321318.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi list !
I'm trying to call the grasstools (.exe) from a python plugin, with some
common os.system commands, as the grass tools aren't supported in PyQis yet.
My idea is to call the grass shell from python, and to pass grass commands
as arguments ( in .bat files for example)
Does anyone has already done that ?
I found the different grasstool's .exe in the Qgis Grass directory, but i
didn't manage to indentify which one is used for the mingv32  shell.
Do you know that ?
Thanks 4 answers

Hi all

In the absence of further feedback on this thread I have gone ahead
with the proposed changes. In order to accommodate John Tulls request
and only keep three priority levels I included enhancement as part of
'minor'. We now have the following priorities:

Possible Values
-----------------------------------------
critical: causes crash or data corruption
major: does not work as expected
minor: annoyance or enhancement

Many thanks to all who provided feedback.

Regards

Tim

Is there a signing key available from a public keyserver? I've never

	wIND
Message-ID: <1073.83.181.218.199.1197631557.squirrel@www.faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I make new tests on QGIS 0.9.1 13_12_07 vers.

I see the binding Python is now present and so the Python plugin works. Good!
The SQLite is present. Very good

I tested also the DBF driver but it does'nt work again and the same
problem is  also with SQLite driver.
For example when I try to import a shape in GRASS, the geometry is
correctly imported but the table linked to the shape is not imported.

No DBF is created on $GISDBASE/$LOCATION_NAME/$MAPSET/dbf/ if I set dbf
driver with db.connect
No SQLite.db file is created on C:\Documents and
Settings\leo\Documenti\cartografia\Toscana\leo\dbf\sqlite.db if I set
SQLite drive with db.connect

QGIS read without problem the bdf table of the shape.

Maybe there is a general problem with database driver.
It is very strange because in the last (before december I think) versions
this kind of problem is not present.

Any idea?

Regards
leonardo

Merging "minor: annoyance or enhancement" sounds _very_ sensible.
Seems like the proper solution (with self-explanatory labeling) to a

Hi Godofredo and Tim,

Thanks for your feedback. So I'll make a patch for svn head with the proposed 
extensions.

This is a good idea. QSortFilterProxModel will certainly help me with 
filtering.
Reading through the Qt documentation, the model/view concept seems to be a 
very flexible way of accessing and displaying data. In a way, the qgis vector 
data provider is also a model.

As models are always non-gui related and views are dialogs, would it make 
sense to have src/core/models and src/app/views?

Also possible would be to introduce a schema name "" (empty string) 
or "default". I suppose you just ignore the schema name when accessing mysql 
databases?

Regards,
Marco

Yes - one of the things I wanted to raise for post 1.0 is implementing
providers as models...the only thing Im not sure of (maybe Martin has
some ideas here) is how it would work with a canvas 'view' which has
multiple models (layers) associated. Certailnly it would work well
with attribute table views. Anyway I'm trying not to get distracted by
post 1.0 ideas now :-)

Hi

Currently the Ubuntu PPA (personal package archives) currently don't
support package signing. As soon as it does I will sign them.

I was (finally) ready to look at Qgis in my Leopard update.  But I'm  
having a problem with the WebSVN viewer - it's giving me incomplete  
tarballs.  I tried both the 0.9.1 branch and trunk.  Besides the  
subfolders, the only files I that get packaged at the top level are:

AUTHORS
BUGS
CODING
CONTRIBUTORS
Doxyfile
Exception_to_GPL_for_Qt.txt

No cmakelist.txt (the critical one), nor any of the other readmes.   
But I see them in the websvn view.  It does have the cmakelists.txt  
files in the subfolders.  It worked back in Sept when I grabbed the  
0.9.0 branch tarball.

I can get it from svn, but the websvn tarball is a nice convenience.

I have made 1 away from final build today , it is available here.
http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis_setup0.9.1.15_12_2007.exe

I solved a lot of the issues with gdal,xerces,sqlite,mysql etc on  
MingW. I have also tested the SQlite driver and it works with grass.  
Let me know if you want me to make up a tutorial on how to use it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposal: Auto-aging of bugs
Message-ID: <4763B5E7.7070200@homann.se>

I propose we introduce auto-aging of bugs.

Reason:
The number of old bugs are overwhelming, and many of the old ones are 
not valid anymore. A large number of invalid bugs are NOT good for 
moreale or for bug fixing process.

Solution:
If a bug makred 'awaiting user input' does not get updated in 30 days, 
all people that have contributed to the bug gets a warning email. This
process is repeated two weeks later, but all developers of QGID is 
included in thois email. If nothinh happens in one week, the bug gets 
closed.

Outcome:
The Trac system will get rid of bugs that the bug reporter is not 
interested in verifying or clarifying.

If we don't:
Trac system wii be full of bugs that can?t be closed, becasue we can?t 
verify if the bugs are solved or not.


I belive this can be done technically. The time limits can be discussed.

Not many bugs are marked awating user interaction, but if thsi gets 
implemented I propose that we go thorugh old bugs from 0.8.1  and ask if 
the same applies top 0.9.1 (crashes etc), and set the bug as 'awaiting 
user input'.

Hi,

I still don't get idea why providers should be implemented as models.
In my view the concept of models is different from the concept of
providers. And I don't know what would be the benefit of bending
provider interface to be a model. Our canvas view uses only rendered
image from map renderer so changing the canvas to be actually a view
of provider model would be quite a lot of work, moreover we would need
to work out what to do with map canvas items and tools etc.

But I completely agree to implement attribute table on the model/view
architecture.

Message-ID: <200712151606.23853.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Hi qgis devs,

Some time ago I sent a proof-of-concept patch that restored screen updates 
during rendering. 

Now I generated an improved patch that also restores screen updates but it is 
done with less code changes (so simpler and closer to svn trunk code). 

Screen updates during rendering operations can be turned on by entering a 
value != 0 in Settings -> Options -> Rendering -> Update Display after 
rendering xxx features. The basic principle is that layers may emit the 
signal 'screenUpdateRequested()' such that the current rendering status shown 
in the qgis map window.

Also, the patch uses two Mutexes. One to protect the main rendering loop such 
that only one thread may render at one time. And the second to handle the 
problems when resizing the map window. The problem with resizing is that many 
refresh requests may arrive in short time. The solution implemented in the 
patch is that there is a waiting list where rejected threads leave their 
sizes. Then the mapcanvas considers only the last entry (which is the most 
important one) as soon as it is not busy with rendering any more. Therefore 
resizing should now also work properly for WMS layers.

On my todo list (but not implemented yet) is the possibility to stop the 
rendering. I plan to do this by introducing a QgsRenderingContext object, as 
suggested by Martin in an earlier Mail.

Please test the patch and report your experiences on the list.

Cheers,
Marco

Sounds a very good idea to me, and similar to what Debian people is doing,
if I understand it correcly. I'm also pretty sure a number of bugs are no
longer valid (I closed a few of them after verification).
One caution, however: we have a number of interesting wishes, and also
bugs targeted to 1.0 which nobody is going to address anytime soon, but
still are very useful to keep, so we should have a "nodelete" mark on
those.

Yes, only bugs marked for 'awaiting user input' will be aged. Others 
remain indefinately.

Also, by sneding a mail to all developers before a bug is aged, anyone 
can 'touch' and make it stay.

Hi

Sounds like a good idea to me. I can probably do this using a cron job
and some sql scripts to operate directly on the trac db. Next time I
have a bit of spare time I'll try to whip something up...assuming
there are no objections.

Regards

Tim

Since the official announcement has been delayed, I'm calling this a  
test build ;)

I have Qgis 0.9.1 for OSX on my site.  This build is for Tiger AND  
Leopard.  Qgis Python support on Tiger uses the python.org Universal  
Python 2.5 framework, but on Leopard it uses the system Python 2.5  
(though it can probably use the python.org framework if installed).

I didn't run into any major problems with compiling Qgis on Leopard.   
I did have to figure out extra options for the SIP and PyQt builds so  
they don't install in the system.  With the python.org python  
framework, it's accepted (though technically not OK) to install  
extensions into the framework, but it's bad form to install extensions  
into the system's python.

Hi Marco,

The WMS resize optimization doesn't work on a Mac. When I resize a WMS 
layer, the image is repeatedly fetched and the window slowly grows by 
one pixel increments. The problem doesn't happen on Ubuntu. When I 
resize the same layer there, the intermediate redraws are skipped.

One improvement is that newer redraws no longer interrupt the draw in 
progress so the screen corruption during resizing is gone.

I will look for the cause of the extra redraws sometime in the next few 
days.

Another difference is that if I maximize the window on a Mac with 
incremental update enabled, the window resize does not happen until 
after the redraw. First the map view grows and the maximized map is 
incrementally rendered while the full view is not visible. Only at the 
end does the window expand and the map becomes fully visible without 
additional redrawing. On Ubuntu, it works more as expected. The window 
expands first and then the map is incrementally rendered into the 
enlarged and fully visible view.

Hi all.
Testing the (very nice) python plugin installer (fresh qgis from svn), I
get an error:
Failed to unzip file to /home/paolo/.qgis//python/plugins ... check
permissions
Is this just a double slash problem? Any solution to this at the horizon?
also, it would be good to use the same installer plugin to install also
plugins from filesystem: is it feasible to add this feature?
BTW: http://spatialserver.net:3001/ mention a bug (#781) which has been
closed: better update the info?
All the best.

I was wrong: the problem was the missing /python/plugins dir. Mkdir
solved the error.
After that I got:

Couldn't load plugin "geocode"
...
ImportError: No module named geocode

easy to solve (http://exogen.case.edu/projects/geopy/), with:

easy_install geopy
python
>>> from geopy import geocoders

Perhaps this could be shown as a hint for first-time users?
All the best.

Thanks

I took the liberty of changing the way HTML works in the 
plugin_template, while I was fixing another bug. The links are also 
clickable now.

See http://svn.qgis.org/trac/changeset/7796 for the changes.

The HTML style and an untranslatable table is separated out.
Paragraphs are translated by themselves (not sentences this time).

I think there should be similar guidelines in the DevelopersManual?

Hi Tom,

Thanks for looking into this. I'm curious what might be the cause of the different behaviour on Mac. On Thursday, I may also test the patch on a windows box (and probably on Mac too).

cheers,

Wouldn't it be good to add the

http://blog.qgis.org/?q=node/59
to the list of installable plugins http://spatialserver.net:3001/ ?

Hi Tisham,
 very good work for this update and I see also the QGIS-GRASS tutorial!

I tested the pre-final build and I tested the SQLite driver that works well.

Only a bug I see in this preview, when I run QGIS it say: "Couldn't load
PyQT bindings. Python support will be disabled"

The problem is that I have Python 2.5 installed in my computer with
python-site-packages inserted in the C:/Python25/Lib/site-packages

And If I run an old version of QGIS (0.9), it see the PyQt bindings and
the Python plugins work.

Something is changed in version of PyQt or in the searching path or
other else?

Thank you again for your good work
Leonardo

Hi Tisham,
can you build the final version with the new svn?
Some weeks ago I fixed some QGIS-GRASS modules but I see that in your
pre-final version there are ever the old modules.

Thank a lot!

Hi All

My apologies for not getting back to those who created test packages
for 0.9.1. We have delayed making the final release pending Tisham
sorting out some win packaging issues and me getting some release
admin procedures sorted out. As of this release, the procedure for
release will be:

1) Create release branch
2) Packaging only commits go to that branch while packagers make test packages
3) Tag the branch
4) Make branch and tag read only to prevent further commits to those areas

As such I have now completed step 4 in the above process and would
like to ask everybody who has so kindly created packages to freshen
them so that when we announce the release, all packages will be using
a common revision number (which will make tracking bugs easier among

do:

svn switch https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/tags/Release-0_9_1-Final

or

svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/tags/Release-0_9_1-Final

To see who normally builds for each platform. If you are making
packages for an unlisted platform, please contact me so that I can add
your name to my list.

I will be out of contact from this Friday till Jan 02 2008 and would
like to make the press announcements before the end of this week so we
can give the starving (for QGIS) masses something to install on their
computers this xmas.

Message-ID: <47680999.8020200@faunalia.it>


Hi Tisham,

I come back with other tests:

The Python bindings is correctly present, my problem is in the presence
of the od version of Python 2.5, but there is also a little problem...
I can see the Python Plugins Mangaer or other Plugin that I put in
C:/Programmi/Quantum_GIS/python/plugins/ directory where the
plugin_installer directory is.
Do you know why?


I look about the new QGIS-GRASS modules that I say to you in the last mail

I make changes in the svn on Rev 7760 - 2007-12-10 15:51:05 +0000 (Mon,
10 Dec 2007)
http://svn.qgis.org/WebSVN/listing.php?repname=Quantum%20GIS&path=%2F&rev=7760&sc=1

but they are not in the final preview.

This change are very important for our action of QGIS diffusion, is
possible to insert it in the ufficial release?


Thank you again about your work

Regards
Leonardo

Hi Leonado

It wont be possible - the branch was created on Dec 6th and your
commits were Dec 10th (I sent out an email indicating freeze and
branch plan a week before this too). It is important that we have a
consistent set of features for all platform builds of QGIS and I have
already sent out the call for packaging. Your changes will be in the
next release of QGIS scheduled for end of Jan 2008 (i.e., only a month
or so away now). It is possible for us to put urgent changes in post
branch but pre tagging and call for packaging, but unfortunately you
have missed that deadline.

Regard

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python build problem on OSX
Message-ID: <0821DDA9-CF43-4D84-BE80-D285947D94F3@kyngchaos.com>

I found a build problem (unnoticed back in 0.9.0) with the Python  
support on OSX - it will NOT build universal, or with an SDK (which  
means I can't build *on* Leopard *for* Tiger, due to some library  
version incompatibilities).

I added a bug in trac:

https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/876

It's partially what's behind problems in my 0.9.1 test build, and I've  
removed that from download for now, until I can figure out a  
workaround or it's fixed.

It doesn't affect the Qgis application, so I suppose I could build  
without python support if anyone is interested.

I work around the problem by editing the two generated Makefiles in 
build/python/core and build/python/gui after the C++ generation step is 
finished.

To CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS add
-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386 -arch ppc

To LFLAGS add
-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386 -arch ppc

This can be done after the build is done or you can interrupt the build 
as soon as you see the message that it's starting compilation of 
core.so. I also delete any .o in the two directories. Running 'make' 
again will (re)build Universal modules.

The problem is that the QGIS Python modules are completely managed by a 
Python script. If the generated files were directly compiled by CMake, 
the problem would disappear. This would also solve the problem of all 
C++ files being regenerated and recompiled whenever any file, not just 
those which have a modified Python binding, is modified. It would make 
more sense to me if each sipxxx.cpp depended upon xxx.sip and Python was 
invoked only to generate the .cpp file leaving CMake to take care of 
compiling and linking C++ files.

I know that the way how the compilation of PyQGIS works now isn't
optimal at all, however I wasn't able to figure out any better
solution. Python modules sipconfig and pyqtconfig do all the hard work
detecting correct parameters for compilation for all supported
platforms/compilers.

Looking at sipconfig I see it supports universal builds - try this:
in configure.py.in add argument universal='/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk'
to sipconfig.ModuleMakefile() constructor - when creating variables
makefile_core and makefile_gui
It should do exactly the same as Tom has written manually to makefiles...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Compiling QGis related Application
Message-ID: <1198076593.6237.17.camel@murat-dell>

Dear All,

I have just started to build a gis related application, and after some
searching, i have chosen QGis to be one of my dependent platform
together with Qt. 

I am using Ubuntu Gutsy with Kdevelop+QtDesigner. 

My Starting point was the First C++ Tutorial from the QGis Blog. I have
installed QGis 0.9 as well as 0.8 and both of them giving the same
errors:

....
/usr/local/include/qgis/qgsapplication.h:21: error: expected identifier
before numeric constant
/usr/local/include/qgis/qgsapplication.h:21: error: expected
unqualified-id before numeric constant
/usr/local/include/qgis/qgsproviderregistry.h:38: error: expected
identifier before numeric constant
/usr/local/include/qgis/qgsproviderregistry.h:38: error: expected
unqualified-id before numeric constant
......

And those lines are the exact lines that class definitions take place. 

for example from "/usr/local/include/qgsapplication.h":

15:/* $Id: qgsapplication.h 7130 2007-08-09 04:06:41Z timlinux $ */
16:#ifndef QGSAPPLICATION_H
17:#define QGSAPPLICATION_H
18:
19:#include <QApplication>
20:
21:class CORE_EXPORT QgsApplication: public QApplication // line 21 here
22:{
....

I have a line inside .pro file like "DEFINES += CORE_EXPORT".

So, how can I fix these problems? Any idea or suggestion will be
appreciated. 


Thanks in advance.

Murat

I thought it might be something there.  Thanks.

Is it possible for the python cmakelists to see that a user specified - 
D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="ppc;i386" -D CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=whatever and  
add the universal option automatically (reusing CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT and  
not just blindly forcing the 10.4u SDK)?

Yes, it's possible. See attached small patch for configure.py.in - it
_may_ work. I'm not at my computer neither have here my development
stuff so this is just blind trial that implements what you're
requesting...

That works.  If/when you apply it to SVN, that'll take care of the bug  
in trac:

https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/876

I guess it isn't critical for the 0.9.1 release, since I can patch and  
build the binaries universal now.

Ok, so I've commited it to trunk so it will get only to 0.9.2 release.
I've also closed the ticket.

Message-ID: <255b57430712191031y3218749cv40b32d9b1e6bb046@mail.gmail.com>

I'm attempting to do some work to remove the rasterizing of the point
symbols, so they can be freely scaled in the print composer and elsewhere.
I've added a QgsSymbolRenderer base class, and a derived class,
QgsBasicSymbolRenderer.  The code is in the composer_redesign branch.

However, I keep getting linker errors, saying:
Linking CXX executable qgis
/home/steven/QGIS_work/composer_redesign/build/src/core/libqgis_core.so:
undefined reference to `vtable for QgsBasicSymbolRenderer'

>From what I've read, this error occurs when the derived class doesn't
implement certain virtual methods, but I don't see anything wrong with my
code.  Do I have to do something else to include the new classes as the code
is linked?  Have I just made a stupid mistake in my code?

Steven

  This is making a stab, but does your derived class have a virtual destructor?

Cheers,

Thanks for the quick reply.  I realized what the problem was - I hadn't
added my new cpp files to the CMakeLists.txt file, so they weren't being
compiled and found.

Hi Niccolo

7805 was just a small test commit to see if the tag I made was indeed
read only....which it wasnt :-P Using either 7805 or 7804 will be
fine.

Can you supply the neccessary repo information for users to add to
their sources list?

Thanks

Regards

Tim

Hi

Could you supply the whole .pro file? Also detailed compiler stdout
would help. You should be seeing something like -DCORE_EXPORT on
stdout when compiling...are you getting it?

Hi Steven

Lets wait till the patch is applied. We should probably start
petitioning the devs & psc to update the minimum Qt version to 4.3.x.
Im going to be offline pretty much  for 10 - 15 days over xmas. When I
get back pop me a note if I appear to have forgotten about it and I
will start the lobbying process.

Regards

Tim

A new test build for Qgis 0.9.1 Mac OS X.  Because of the way PyQt/SIP  
builds on OSX (it links the Python lib when it shouldn't) I had to  
split the Tiger and Leopard packages.  The Tiger package uses the  
python.org Python 2.5.  The Leopard package uses Leopard's Python 2.5.

For those that prefer the python.org Python, the Tiger Qgis should run  
on Leopard.

The sources.list entry is:

  deb http://debian.gfoss.it/ lenny main

That is an unofficial Debian Testing repo, only i386.

It is intended to help people waiting for official packages, that 
sometimes get blocked into the Debian strong qaulity path.

Message-ID: <200712210951.10793.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Hi,

On January 10th, there is the feature freeze in trunk for the next version 
(0.9.2).
There are two branches that are planned to be merged before this date:

- The raster transparency branch with new features for raster symbolisation

- The advanced editing branch with new vector editing tools and a better 
snapping mechanism

Tim provided some test build such that also non-developers may test the 
branches and fill tickets into the bug tracker. 
(http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/)

Please test the branches, fill bugs in the bugtracker or post your opinion on 
the developer list.

@Peter: Is it possible for you to merge the raster transparency branch before 
10.01.08?

I plan to do the merge for the editing branch, presumably a few days before 
10.01.


Merry christmas and a happy new year,
Marco

To me, the sooner the merge, the better (more time to test).
I could probably provide the debs for lenny soon after the merge, for a
wider testing.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

The main idea of the development in branches is that qgis main branch (trunk) 
is always in a (relatively) stable state. So it is best to test the branches 
before the merge.

In practice, there will always be issues in trunk after a merge. But the less 
issues the better.

Best regards,
Marco

Hi, 

updated QGIS 0.9.1 packages for opensuse 10.2 and 10.3 (32 and 64bit) are
available from the repository listed on the download webpage. For opensuse 10.2
python support is disabled, because of missing dependency packages.

Hi,

there are some sources of documentation. First you should get known to
PyQt as also QGIS API heavily depends on Qt. There are many tutorials
around about PyQt, try googling it.

Regarding PyQGIS, currently the best source of documentation is this wiki page:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PythonBindings
It contains small code snippets for several aspects of QGIS API.
For full QGIS developer documentation see:
http://svn.qgis.org/api_doc/html/
It's based on C++ code but the usage is the same, just with python syntax
(the documentation is not always in a good state but if you point out
the weakest places we could improve it)

Some more resources on PyQGIS:
- tutorials by Tim ported from C++ to Python: - http://blog.qgis.org/?q=node/59
- repository of some QGIS plugins developed in community -
http://spatialserver.net:3001/

Finally, please don't direct your questions directly to me - send them
to qgis-developer mailing list. That way other people can benefit from
the replies too.

Martin

The problem on Mac seems to be the flag Qt::excludeUserInputEvents. Obviously, 
the resize event is a user input event on Mac, but not on Win and Linux :-)

Please test this new patch, it works for me also on Mac. As 
QApplication->processEvents() is used now instead 
QApplication->processEvents(Qt::excludeUserInputEvents), some queries have 
been added to prevent users from adding layers, removing layers, zooming, 
etc. while the drawing is in progress.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

December has somehow come and almost gone and I have made little 
progress. I still have one more big task to do --moving all of the 
pseudo color and shading code into a new class -- and a couple of 
smaller things that must be addressed.

I will try to put some dedicated time into this over the next week while 
I am traveling. I think by the first of the New Year, I can have 
something for the project steering committee to look at and see if the 
branch is ready to be merged.

Bob Moskovitz has been a real great help testing the raster branch, but 
it would be good to hear back from any other users who have also been 
testing it.

A merry Christmas as all those who celebrate it and best wishes to 
everyone for a safe, prosperous and hopefully peaceful New Year.

-pete

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Patch for screen updates during long rendering

Hey Marco,

finally I've took a look at the patch and I have some comments:

- from the few tests I've done the patch behaves well :-)

- you use mutexes in the patch. Mutexes are good for synchronization
between threads, but QGIS runs in one thread - so is it really
necessary? What we're trying to acheive is to protect the functions
from indirect recursion - resizeEvent calls rendering, rendering calls
event loop, event loop calls resizeEvent... But it's all done just in
one thread so we should be perfectly OK just with some (e.g. static)
variables that would indicate if we're already in resizeEvent or not.
I've tried it and seems to work fine.

- the same applies to refresh() - it suffices to skip the refresh if
mDrawing flag is already true.

- we don't need to store queue of all resizes, we need to store just
the last one. Moreover if we were using threads, that variable
mResizeQueue should have been also guarded by mutex (in the current
implementation of resizeEvent it's not).

I've attached my changes in qgsmapcanvas.cpp (I've changed only
resizeEvent() and refresh()) if you're interested in my solution
(works for me on linux).

Footnotes :)
- we can enable emitting drawingProgress in QgsMapRender to show the
progress bar while rendering
- we can call processEvents() also after rendering every layer (to
update the progress bar and optionally also map in canvas)

What interests me here most is cancellation of the rendering. In some
thread on qgis-dev I've been raving already about something called
rendering context, which would contain all those parameters we'd like
to pass to layers when drawing and we would pass only that object
instead of all the arguments:
- painter
- extent to draw
- transformation between map and screen coordinates
- transformation between layer and map coordinates
- whether we're in overview or not
- (in future) scaling parameters
For me the best solution would be to add a flag "rendering cancelled"
to that context which would be set by application in case user hits
Esc.
As you can see this would mean also some small changes in qgis
libraries (to add the rendering context) but the changes can be done
without breaking current API - we could keep original layers' draw()
functions and mark them as deprecated.

This change is important also for fixing the map composer since we
should add new flag that would indicate whether the output must be
vector (print or export to PDF/SVG) or can be raster (drawing to
screen). In case of raster output we can cache symbols as bitmaps.
Unfortunately this caching is currently happening also with vector
output and thus resulting with ugly appearance of symbols.

Happy holidays
Martin

Message-ID: <35634.43711.qm@web51002.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Dear All,
   
  I intend to make setup Qgis 0.9.2 which support Python ,PyQT in Windows .And i follow the instruction to make setup in this page
   
  http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingFromSource
   
  But when i compile NISS Script , it only made a setup for qgis , not embled Python and PyQt within .So , when i setup Qgis in other computer , i must do 3 process : setup python ,pyqt and Qgis . Does anyone make suggestion for me?
   
  Thank you so much.I'm looking forward to you soon.
   
  Le Son

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Project files from old revision of QGIS
Message-ID: <477152A7.5020102@homann.se>

Hello all,
There has not been any effort of reading QGIS project files from older 
revision and keeping the data from the old project. Until now. :-)

In the branch 'rev-up' I have started work in that direction. A system 
for detecting which version the project file was written in, a warning 
dialog and a framework for 'upgrading' project files are included.

https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/qgis_rev-up

The idea is that any developer that seomhow changes the stuff written 
into the project file, also must write a transformation function if 
applicable. He/She should at least make sure that missing information in 
the project file is handled by a reasonable default.

Three cases:
1) Completetly new funtionality is added to QGIS, and a reasonable 
default value exist. E.g: A new angular renderer storing the field for 
determining angle, can be handled by a reasonable default (off).

2) Some new funtionality is added to QGIS, and it is either dependant on 
older settings, and/or have many settings that are related. This can be 
handled by cleverly specifying defaults or by using a transform function.

3) Changes in storing functionality that has existed (from user 
perspective). E.g: The way SRS/Coorindatetransform are stored have 
chnaged. Transform of data from old project files SHOULD be written.

I have with the help of trial and error(s!) done some work in the areas 
I discovered; coordinate transforms and legend settings 
(visible/inOverview). I hope the developers who changed the way this is 
stored can take a look and see if I have missed something.

IMPORTANT: When you change format of project file, please write a 
transform. My examples should guide you, it's not very hard.

The transformation work in series, so we have one from 0.8.1 to 0.9.0 
and then from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 and so on. Reading a 0.8.1 project from a 
0.9.2 QGIS will run (if needed) three transform functions.

The relevant file to edit is

.../src/core/qgsprojectfile.cpp

Questions? I can help you! I think this is important. :-)

Hi,

i'm on osx 10.4.11
building qgis from source on osx as well on linux
i have somme issue on the osx side :


  - the msexport do not works (it isn't recognized by python)

       log :  "  ms_export python module not found   "



  - the svn checkout is possible only exporting the utf.de environment :

      export LC_CTYPE=de_DE.UTF-8

      (maybe add these note on the wiki page is a good thing)


  - in the grass-tools any script that use proj (like m.proj, that is  
a front end to cs2cs)
      do not works, the log give me :

        proj not found please install it  (you can test it in the  
bash shall using m.proj comand)

         (i already have proj and it is exported in my bash profile,  
all commands works fine by command line)

       -- as proj libraries i'm using the frameworks ,
          i also tried to compile proj form source and modify the  
qgis cmake setting ,
          but nothing changes (on linux all works fine).

regards,

Massimo.

Hi,

I would recommend using one of my official installers unless you are
after a particular feature in 0.9.2. I am not sure if the python
bundling features got carried over to trunk, but they are under the
Release_0_9_1_Final tag. You need to setup a sub-directory under
qgis0.9.1 in Program Files called pydep and put Python.dll there for the
installer to pick up and bundle. Read the NSIS python.nsh script to see
the Python bits. Also put the sip and pyqt4 files under python
subfolder. They get bundled as well.

Well, I just installed the geocoder plugin, so I am guessing that the  
permission error is in the zip file for the BetterTabel plugin, but  
this is only a guess.

Hi all,

Here is the patch that adds a tree view and options for table search to the 
postgis dialog. Please test it and report bugs and/or comments.

There are two new classes derived from Qt model in this patch. One is the base 
model and the second one a proxy model that adds the capability of filtering 
according to wildcard or regexp. 

cheers,
Marco

Hi Martin,

Thanks for looking into this. I think you are right, everything runs just in 
one thread and we don't need mutexes. So I attached a second version of the 
patch that includes your changes to qgsmapcanvas.cpp (and contains one 
additional if(mDrawing) query).
I'd like to apply the patch to trunk before the feature freeze for 0.9.2, 
which is on 10th January. Everybody is invited to test the patch, especially 
on other platforms.

+1. It will be great to have the progress bar back!

Yes, it is very important to have the possibility to cancel long renderings. 
In my opinion it is worth to do some API changes and to have it prior to 
version 1.0 (coded as usual in a development branch).

Regards and a happy new year,
Marco

Hi Martin,

The bindings are not up to date. I'm trying to update the bindings when I 
return from holidays at the 5th of January.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <255b57430712310450o20c6f542he57f7018c47a7ae3@mail.gmail.com>

I noticed in the commit list that homann is working on some symbol scaling
in the angular renderer branch.  I've done a fair bit of working on vector
symbolology and scaling over the last few days as well.  I'll try to get a
usable version of what I've got into SVN in a couple days.  It will be in
the composer_redesign branch, since I started by trying to fix bugs visible
in the composer.  Hopefully we can combine our efforts and not duplicate
them. :-)
