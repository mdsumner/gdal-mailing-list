Hi all.
In this process, I started moving plugin tickets:
https://trac.faunalia.it/qgis_plugins/report/1
to the appropriate place:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins
Should I create subproject for all plugins (at least those with a recorded issue)?
All the best.

Message-ID: <1325510781.2259.84.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

in redmine we have a number of patches (18, but probably are more as the
"patch supplied" tag was added not long ago), a few of them potentially
good to fix very annoying issues.

Some of the patches were posted months ago and, as far as I know, never
reviewed to be applied (a few were even tested successfully by other
users).

I guess that not reviewing/considering such work makes less probable
contributions from "casual", not core, developers.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster file creation using the QGIS API and Raster
	format for Heatmaps
Message-ID: <CACbtZwS7L1f-N+hhKhRFxupyXf6VQp6ceF-weP1otzyNGnZ6Aw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am working on a heatmap plugin, which would generate a heatmap based on
the occurrence of points and their proximity. The present Interpolation
methods available in the QGIS API are for the attribute data or value
interpolation. Hence they are well off with the available GridFileWriter,
which computes the value at each pixel and writes out the value. But
Frequency heatmaps, would be better done, by computing the pixel which each
vertex/point represents and writing to that pixel. i.e., it is exactly the
reverse of what GridFileWriter does. I have tried implementing some
rudimentary logics by creating a QgsFrequencyInterpolator to use the
GridFileWriter itself, but the results are too far away from a  faithful
heatmap.

Hence I would like to know *how else* can a raster be created in QGIS using
the API?

Moreover the ASCII file format is too costly, in terms of memory, for a
heatmap which generally has a lot of null value entries, unlike other
interpolated rasters. In most cases, null values exceed the pixel
representations on the raster.

Hence which would be more appropriate format to represent a Heatmaps?

Message-ID: <CACbtZwQWZMexx5=J97_PrU8OZZnJ=R3mMdD5_ER_eM3h6qN1bQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello devs,

I have been rambling on about this Heatmap Plugin thing for quiet sometime
now. I am happy to announce that its almost over.

The plugin currently takes in a point layer and does a frequency valuation
for the pixels based on the no of points near to it.

It takes in two arguments a decay value, and buffer radius in pixels for
the points. I have hardcoded these two now and once put in GUI as user
editable, it should complete the plugin. It presently uses the ASCII grid
file format and wastes a lot of memory, if someone could comeup with a
better format I would be happy.

Now what should I be doing? Create a ticket? make a pull request?

The code is presently in me gihub fork.

Good point and if I were able to review those patches I'll do it ..
Probably we need one of the developers to take that burden and review
and accept or decline those patches .. Leaving them completely untouched
does not make a good view to the people trying to contribute ..

For all pull requests regarding translations I try to integrate them as
soon as possible ..

As we do not have so many developers it will probably be difficult ..
but maybe there is a volunteer willing to look over all patches once in
2 weeks or so?

thanks a lot

Hi all,

I would like to know what do you think about the following.

Many QGIS users find puzzling that many core tools shipped with QGIS are
listed/available as "plugins". I agree with them, they should not be
available (to be enabled/disabled) in the "manage plugins" dialog and a
few should be enabled by default (examples: ftools, gdal tools,
delimited text layer).

Something that can be optimized along the road to 2.0?

I agree it may be confusing, but I think retaining the capability of

Giovanni,

in general I agree but I would like to see the integration even
further - the plugins should be ideally moved to QGIS itself (or even
its libraries). Delimited text plugin is a good example of what should
be available by default. Regarding fTools and gdal tools - their code
should be moved to the qgis_analysis library and ported to the
processing framework. However even the processing framework still
needs a lot of work and unfortunately there is not that much momentum
around it.

Martin

Hi Nathan

I'm interested in these SIP files as it seems that you already have
some almost ready.
Can you send me the SIP files you have (even if there are still
errors)? Perhaps we can give you a hand.

I mainly want to "Position on map centered on screen and smoothly
updated by a GPS" with Python (see this thread).
AFAIK it's e.g. class QgsGPSConnection which sends a signal
'stateChanged( const QgsGPSInformation&  info )' as soon as the GPS is
ready.

I already contacted Martin and Marco. Marco offered me to integrate
them into trunk.

Thanks!
Stefan

More info: it happens with a specific raster (e.g. one GDT_Float32 - Thirty two bit 
floating point), not with others (e.g. GDT_Int32 - Thirty two bit signed integer).
If I apply a qml style to the same layer, it works.
Thanks.

Message-ID: <CABqTJk9RriCCkeZhUqAVH_omQhz6E_9vyMO2mb4gX4LqDPmCsQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm try to compile qgis on a RedHat AS6 64bit
to test the qgis-server capabilities.

But when call ccmake and try to configure it report me two missing
libraries.

The first
is GSL_Config that ccmake don't find.
I verify that I have installed the GSL gnu Scientific Library, but also I
verify that in my RH there is no one GSL-config :(
However I ask if the GSL is really mandatory for the qgis-server ?

The second library not found is the QTWEBKIT.
This is really a missing library, I try to install but I see it is very
troubled library to install on RH6 !.

Again I hope the QTwebkit was a not mandatory library for qgis-server.

Any hint is welcome.

Thx,

Andrea.

I think you need libgsl0-dev, or its RH equivalent.

I think it is only needed if you compile with grass (probably not necessary for a 
server).
Please remember to update the instructions on the wiki when successful.

Apparently it seem work.

But when try to compile in the make phase

I have an error :)

I guess this section (helpviewer) is pretty unusable in a qgis-server.
So perhaps this could be avoided.

Perhaps this could be an interesting feature:
An option to compile qgis only with the feature needed for use as
qgis-server.
?

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-WJvKPVyv1-kx7uVL81GpPAe1WKbdwkU5KW2TTkAE_OQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to the list, but have been tinkering around with new features
for the QGIS Web Client for about a month now.

I finally decided to fork the client project at github and am looking
for some input on the first new feature I've got working: extra
OpenLayers base layers and overlays (with the QGIS Server output
sandwiched between). Working with a QGIS Server, MapProxy and
OpenLayers workflow, I've gotten the maps rendering in the client
faster, decently cached, and with quick label drawing.

See the marginally coherent description here:
http://dakcarto.github.com/qgis-web-client/

There is no code yet to play with as I am figuring out how to work
with git/github (first time with this VCS) and push the work up to my
'extralayers' branch.

I'm looking for input on the feature, like whether you think it is a
good addition, or whether you see a different approach. I'm mostly
looking at adding features that keep the user entry level still around
just knowing some javascript, OpenLayers and a smattering of server
configuration. I think keeping the logic coding mixed in with
GeoExt/Ext, and the configuration easier, is a benefit to adoption of
the client by a wider user group.

Thank you for any help you can offer, and thanks to those who have
previously worked on the client,

Hi Larry,

Thanks for sharing this.

We have certainly talked about adding these base layers, but for me
personally, the drawbacks with the tiles had been worse than the
advantages they deliver to me. I think you list them well in the caveats.

However, this doesn't mean that one shouldn't go this route esp. for
pure and fast display (without caring too much about printing).

One workaround for the printing could be to use the tiled-based base map
for display on the web client and then use the raster source directly
for printing.

One could mark layers in the QGIS project as "printing only" which
wouldn't be included in the GeoExt tree and wouldn't be displayed in the
client, but when it is printed and the user selects the corresponding
tiled base layer, then QGIS can include the corresponding print layer
instead of the base layer.

Btw: do you have a link to a working prototype to see the speed
improvements?

Once your work matures, it would be interesting to have this back in the
main trunk.

Thanks a lot and greetings,
Andreas

For me it works with all data types and current master.

Does it work correctly in GRASS monitor?
Are you using some particular rules or a predefined one?
Have you checked if the generated color table itself looks correctly?
Does it work if you add the map to QGIS again instead of just refresh?
Is it the color table loaded into QGIS (colormap in properties)?
Is it style set correctly in style tab (colormap)?
Does it work if you convert the same map to GDT_Float64 ( r.mapcalc
m64=double(m32)  )?

Hi Larry,

> I'm new to the list
Welcome then and thanks for contributing! That looks great, I'll use
this and know others that will!
It would be good to have some popular OpenLayers layers included by
default, with just the need to uncomment or change one or 2 lines of
javascript (for instance, for the 5 base layers of
http://www.openstreetmap.org/
).
It would make a handy way to combine e.g. custom QGIS data rendering
(such as
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBYtH2svw0 ) with OSM base map, and in
some cases may alleviate the need for tile caching the QGIS-rendered
layers (with a good base map, you can simplify your overlay).
Finally, it offers a solution to a few bugs [1] affecting the QGIS
openlayers plugin, and as such is handy even for desktop use.

Cheers,
Mayeul

[1] I'm trying to report them here:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins/issues/new
Namely: rezoom automatically at world level in some cases; wait for all
tiles to be available to display them.

Hi Mayeul,

qgis-user-plugins is an 'umbrella-project' for plugins:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins
Eg I have two plugins hanging under that project: xytools and simplesvg:
which both have trackers:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/xytools/issues/new
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/simplesvg/issues/new

For which plugin do you want to issue bugs? Because, from adding my
plugins, I know that you have to tick a certain tickbox to have a
tracker and git with your plugin.
Maybe the plugin you want to issue for does not have a tracker? Maybe
contact the author/owner of the plugin?

I think that the umbrella does not have that and that you have to issue
you plugin issues to the individual plugin that your bug is for...

It is maybe possible to add a tracker to the umbrella-project also, but
I do not know what the consensus is for that. I do prefer to have one
tracker per plugin: because the actual plugin maintainer is the first
person to be responsible for it.

But maybe other think different?

Hi Richard,
Thanks for your very clear answer!
I have updated the page http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Bugreports
with more detailed instructions.
(If it is possible, removing the "New issue" link at
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins might help some users,
since the link will always trigger an error message. Alternatively, the
link could go to a page saying that you have to go to a plugin
sub-project first).

But how can I change it? Maintainer is set to 'testuser' probably since

Hi everyone,
I have some suggestions for http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Bugreports

- Instruct users to use the preview button when creating or commenting on a bug report.  (I have used the hub a lot, but still sometimes I expect things to appear differently than they actually do).

- Instruct users to only use the edit button on comments to make minor changes (e.g. correcting typos).  This is because there is no email update when a comment is edited.

- The definitions to be used for determining the Priority of a ticket are currently oriented only towards bugs.  I think there should be some additional guidance for determining the Priority of feature requests.
(even if the guidance is "All feature requests are to be assigned 'Normal' priority".  But I'm not proposing that should be the guidance - I think some feature requests are much more important than others.)


Regards,
Alister

Hi Raymond,

I made you a maintainer. So I think you can upload a version yourself now.

I do not see a way to make you maintainer of the plugin...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding expressions support for layer's actions
Message-ID: <CAA6k8-K3KZh1ub6UV6jgaOQdq4gFiEJv3E1boKxpD5jkdd_fAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm working on made actions more powerful adding the support for
expressions (the same used in the labelling system).
This requires to define how to include expressions into the action.

In this moment the syntax to include fields into an action definition
is %field, but even [%field]. There's no a parser, just a replace of
placeholders with the value of the field.

As the first syntax doesn't allow to insert a complex expression
(what's the end of the expression?), so I would use the second one.
What do you think about it?

Here's an example using a python action (it displays a message):
from PyQt4.QtGui import QMessageBox; QMessageBox.information(None,
"Feature info", "record id = [% $id ] \nfield misure = [% misure ]")

The [% expression ] will be replaced with the value of the expression,
so [% $id ] will be the rowid and [%misure] the value of the field "misure".
Of course every supported expression may be used.

In addition, should I drop the old behavior (I think it's better, but it breaks
API) or support both them (i.e. adding a version property for actions) or
keep the old behavior for compatibility only (adding an option in the settings
dialog)?

Thanks for your suggestions.
Regards.

Thanks a lot Arunmozhi.
Can someone review the plugin to see if it is suitable for pulling into master?
I think it would make a good addition.
Of course it will be preferrable to generalize the output, alowing the user to choose 
the preferred format. This would be useful also for existing plugins.
All the best.

+1 for the first solution.
Also, please note that the interface should be streamlined, avoiding the need to 
apply & update the action, etc.

All the best.

I went through the Raster calculator  code, the multiple format support it
provides is through the GDALWarper. I think a generic QgsFileWriter or
QgsGDALFileWriter instead of (or along with) QgsGridFileWriter in the QGIS
API would be a great feature, so that plugins like the interpolator,
heatmap..etc can benefit and support multiple output formats instead of the
grid file alone.

Hi Arunmozhi

Thank you very much for the heatmap plugin. I'm going to commit it to 
master if there are no objections (putting it into the raster menu).

 >I think a generic QgsFileWriter or QgsGDALFileWriter instead of (or 
along with) QgsGridFileWriter in the QGIS API would be a great feature

QgsGridFileWriter is used by the interpolation plugin for historical 
reason, I hope to change that soon. Much better is to use the GDAL API 
directly for raster creation (like in raster calculator or in raster 
terrain plugin).

Yes, a raster file writer class would also be a possibility. However, at 
the moment, I don't see much advantage over the creation with GDAL. 
Maybe the creation of GRASS rasters directly?

Regards,
Marco

I think in this process a "Save as..." contextual menu, much as for vectors, would be 
a very nice feature.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Jean-Roc

True, it still needs to be applied to master branch (modified to go into 
the raster menu instead of the option dialog). There is a larger update 
for the raster terrain module anyway, so hopefully it can be done after 
that.

Marco

Message-ID: <CAHXrU-KwvDma-1gYAvoUsvXEiuTe9vX+Zv4Ho_8moA_UMAbkQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am new to this list, as I am new to the QGIS development workflows,
but I am generally very interested in best practices for keeping
documentation.

Together with Paolo Cavallini, we have been considering which best
practices could be considered for keeping the QGIS documentation.
You may probably already be aware that a wide spread approach for
keeping software documentation nowadays is to keep the documentation
in reStructuredText format, using Sphinx for rendering it and managing
multiple languages versions (via the Pootle web application, if we
expect a large numbers of users is willing to contribute).

Documentation tied to specific release can just live in the source

This is the same approach that has been used for other popular OSGeo
projects like MapServer and GeoServer.
I have tried to summarize the approach in this blog post [0]

I would like to hear your opinion about eventually migrating the whole

Hi Paolo,

I've also had some conversations with both Tim Sutton and Paolo
Cavallini on this topic, I also think that moving to reStructuredText
would be beneficial.

We've also shortly talked about automatically build language-specific
snapshots of the QGIS GUI with a custom sphinx directive.

Great to know you're willing to help, certainly you already know that
the new plugins web infrastructure is built upon our beloved Django :)

It's early days yet, but there might be a requirement for me to
develop a Web Coverage Service server with transaction support. I
thought about developing one from scratch, then I remembered QGIS's
WMS server, and I thought I could build on that.

Does anyone have any thoughts/experience/words of encouragement? The
only WCS-T server out there that I can find is Rasdaman which is the
reference implementation.

plenty of encouragement from here. I do not have (yet) any direct interest on it, but 
I'm sure it will be a great addition, and IMHO QGIS is one of the nicest environments 
to work in.
Looking forward to see it. BTW: wouldn't it be better to develop QGIS as a server 
*and* as a client?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] postgres provider refactoring
Message-ID: <20120109130802.GA9675@norbit.de>

Hi there,

I just commited a larger change to the postgres provider.  Mostly it's
refactoring, but it also contains some features.

You should now be able to use primary keys that are not numeric and even
primary keys with more that one column should work (not sure how well the
latter performs).

The handling of the GEOMETRY type was also changed - the geometry type is now
specified in the layer uri and therefore the automatically generated subset
string is not necessary anymore.  For empty tables you can select with geometry
type to use.

Views still need numeric primary keys and those need to be selected when
adding.

Please test and report.


Author: Juergen E. Fischer <jef@norbit.de>
Date:   Thu Dec 29 00:02:47 2011 +0100

    [FEATURE][API] postgres provider refactoring:
    - use m prefix for member variables and s prefix for class variables
    - refactor QgsPostgresProvider::Conn and QgsPostgresConnection to
      QgsPostgresConn
    - put QgsColumnTypeThread into separate file
    - use QgsPostgresConn in QgsPgSourceSelect
    - cleaner abort of column type thread (e.g. remove unfinished columns from
      selection list)
    - [API] move QgsDbTableModel as QgsPgTableModel to provider
    - [FEATURE] support for arbitrary key (including non-numeric and multi
      column)
    - [FEATURE][API] support for requesting a certain geometry type and/or srid
      in QgsDataSourceURI
     * no more explicit filter strings
     * support for empty tables without gemetry_columns entry or GEOMETRY type.

I think the barrier for new doc translators is currently rather high, and this 
approach seems to me quite productive.
Any thoughts?

 Hi,

 I would also welcome it if we could have other OGC Server standards 
 implemented in QGIS Server.

 However, personally, I would first be interested in WFS(-T) rather than 
 WCS-T. But this is just my own personal preference.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WFS feature IDs: when required, when not?
Message-ID: <4F0AF9CB.7060908@libero.it>

All,

Thanks to Andrea Peri, I have just discovered that WFS 1.0.0 apparently 
does NOT require a WFS server to report a unique feature ID with every 
feature it transmits (a typical newbie misconception?).

The OGC specs are so nested and versioned, it's hard to be certain I've 
understood them correctly.  Could someone be kind enough to enlighten me 
on the following?

1. Can you confirm or correct the following understandings:

a. Every WFS server (versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0) must have a permanent 
unique identifier for every feature.

b. WFS GetFeature responses version 1.0.0 may or may NOT provide a 
unique "fid" attribute with each <feature> element, provided the layer 
is not editable (WFS-T).

c. WFS GetFeature responses version 1.1.0 MUST provide a unique "fid" 
attribute with each <feature> element.

2. Are you aware of any common implementation of WFS 1.0.0 that does NOT 
always report a "fid" attribute with every <feature> element?  (I 
understand TinyOFS can be configured not to do so.)

3. Do you believe that WFS services that do not always provide a "fid" 
with every feature are unusual enough that the QGIS WFS client can 
simply disable all feature caching for such servers?

The proposal at item 3 would require GetFeatures to be requested for the 
entire canvas extent every time any previously un-fetched area is 
exposed on the canvas.  Practically speaking, this means potentially 
long delays on every pan and zoom-out on maps containing WFS layers with 
many features that are hosted by such servers.

Doubtless this is old news to everyone but me.  Sorry for the static.

Hi Bill,

I guess perhaps you could calculate the
PointOnSurface (don't the centroids) for every single feature received.

The PointOnSurface (available on spatialite for example)
Will Allow you to understand if a new Features received is the same or 
is another.

Another technics should be calculate the UUID of every feautre received.

I guess this technics should allow to understand almost pretty well if a 
feature is repeated or not.

Regards,
Andrea.

 Well this is a client request, so I don't have a choice. But from what
 I can tell, transactions in both WCS and WFS are very similar, so I
 could certainly develop it with that in mind.

 So far, there's no requirement for a specific version of WCS, so
 what's the general idea when implementing such specifications? Because
 there is a pretty big difference between WCS 1.1.2 and WCS 2.0.0, the
 latter using GML coverages as its basis, and is more modular in its
 approach. Additionally, there's no specified support for WCS-T in
 2.0.0 yet; Rasdaman seems to shoehorn 1.1.2 WFS-T into the 2.0.0
 model.

Yes, latest Sphinx version has a first class support for
internationalization [1], so it should not be too hard to build an
optimal solution for QGIS out of the box.
We could then make the .po files editable by the Pootle web
application [2], so every translator would have a pleasant editing
experience and we could implement desired workflows.

Oh yes, nice app! I have seen that, and I think you will be happy to

So please let me know if I may go further with those experiments and
design a more detailed proposal

I think the TinyOWS approach is quite efficient, and we could avoid reimplementing it 
here. It should be suffcient to do some lighter integration between TOWS and QGIS.

Hi John

Does the WCS-T service need functionality from the QGIS API (raster 
layer, raster provider, ...)? If not, it could also be an option to 
build the WCS service directly on top of the GDAL library.

QGIS (wms) server could certainly serve as an inspiration on how to 
implement other geospatial web services on top of the QGIS API. 
Code-wise, I don't think the WCS server can use many parts of the wms 
server. It would probably go into its own executable (qgis_wcs.fcgi or 
similar), be linked to qgis_core and use functions from libfcgi for 
communication with the webserver.


Regards,
Marco

Hi,

we started to work on a solution for the documentation and we decided to
migrate the docs from latex to rst - but this has not happened yet. At this
point we have the docs in git and we plan to start using the online tools
provided by github to work on the englisch manual (latex) for the next
release.

For the future we will convert the latex sources to rst and we are still
open and thinking about an optimal solution for the translation process.
Help and ideas is always welcome.

That's what I can say for the manual/documentation. I remember I had a look
at Sphinx some time ago. I liked it but haven't seen a solution for the
manual translations with it - maybe that has changed.

I guess, Werner can say more about the GUI and its translation. 

Regards
Otto

Hi Otto.
You mean 1.7.4, or major release (2.0)? Why not moving to rst sooner? Will it be a 
manual process, or there are efficient tools for migration?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I guess 2.0 is more realistic. There is some convert tools, but it will still
be much work to migrate all styles or if that is not possible, to create a
new nice looking manual. The speed depends on the number of people working
on it. At the moment we don't have too many people writing or working on the
documentation, that's why I think it will take a little longer.

Otto

Understood. I'm pretty sure is we'll have a nice interface, without the need to learn 
new tools (latex etc.) many more people will be available to help. At least our 
Italian community is ready. That's why I was suggesting to migrate ASAP, and put in 
place simpler tools for translators.
Of course if the migration itself is very heavy, this is a real problem. Could we 
start from simpler pieces?
All the best, and thanks a lot.

Migration is one thing and the other is that we are on the one hand lucky to
have so many people who help us translating the manual but on the other
hand only a few people are interested in updating the englisch master
document. So before people can start to translate, we need to update the
manual. Maybe we can encourage more people to update the manual. now that we
have the latex sources in git, if they can use the online tools via github.

I hope I will soon have some time to help and work on this topic/problem.

Otto

Oh, I see. But this does not affect migration, I guess. On the contrary, if there is 
little activity in writing it, we'll have more time for migration. And I'm sure a 
nice web interface for writing will make it life easier for doc writers too.
All the best.

It affects migration, if the people writing and migrating are the same ;).
But anyway, it would be very helpful and a great step forward, to have a more
intuitive online tool for the documentation update/translation/... So we
should and will definitely go for it.

Hello,

As I said before, I can help to migrate documentation to rst. I am using rst 
frequently for all the documentation so it is not a problem for me.

The only issue I see is to create nice PDF documentation. I tested rst2odt 
which could help with pdf generator inside OOo but the rst2odt writer in 
sphonx does'nt exist. So we need to find a good solution. I tested one with my 
gdal documentation but this is not the way I will use.

Sphinx can create PDF files but this is **really** difficult to change the 
design.

If any Python guru can add rst2odt writer to sphinx it will really help!

Y.

Maybe I do not understand your post correctly, what about to use rst2pdf ?

Ivan,

Sphinx use rst2pdf to create pdf file, as said before, this is really a pain to 
customize design.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Benchmarking QgsExpression against V8
Message-ID: <2052129.lmK783bSmN@polarwind2>

Hi all,

Following the recent enhancements of QGsExpression, I was wondering whether it 
wouldn't make sense to integrate a language intepreter instead of creating 
another language.
One candidate would be Google's V8 JavaScript engine 
(http://code.google.com/p/v8/). Since embedding this C++ library is easy, I've 
conducted a few quick benchmarks against QgsExpression. Code is attached.

Test 1:
Qgs: '1' || '2' || '3' || '4' || '5' || '6' || '7' || '8' || '9' || '0'
total_avg: 3.380211
V8: '1' + '2' + '3' + '4' + '5' + '6' + '7' + '8' + '9' + '0'
total_avg: 0.556035
Fact: 6.0791335

Test 2:
Qgs: 1+1=2 AND 5>1
total_avg: 4.072254
V8: 1+1==2 && 5>4
total_avg: 0.864054
Fact: 4.7129624

Test 3:
Qgs: replace(lower( 'AAAAAAAAAAxxCCCCCCCC'), 'xx', 'BB')
total_avg: 3.480217
V8: 'AAAAAAAAAAxxCCCCCCCC'.toLowerCase().replace('xx', 'BB')
total_avg: 0.856053
Fact: 4.0654224

Test 4:
Qgs: regexp_replace( 'AAAAAAAAAAxxCCCCCCCC', 'x+', 'b')
total_avg: 2.952184
V8: 'AAAAAAAAAAxxCCCCCCCC'.replace(/x+/, 'b')
total_avg: 0.668042
Fact: 4.4191593

Test 5:
Qgs: CASE WHEN (15 = 11 or 15 = 13 or 15 = 15 or 15 = 21) THEN 15 END
total_avg: 1.4664916
V8: if ([11,13,15,21].indexOf(15)>=0) { 15 }
total_avg: 0.2672168
Fact: 5.4880217

This benchmarks show that QgsExpression evaluation is between 4 to 6 times 
slower than V8. This is much better than I expected, but it's still factor 4 
to 6...
So I think it's worth discussing pros and cons of using V8 as an expression 
engine. I see the following points:

Pros:
-Better performance
-Full Javascript language set included
-Possibility for writing custum functions

Cons:
-New language for expressions
-More fat (3.7MB for libv8.so)

V8 would be a new runtime dependency but would replace the flex and yacc build 
dependencies.

Any other points?

Regards
Pirmin

Hi,

I think the language for expressions should be considered carefully.  It
can have a fairly big impact on user experience, particularly for people
who aren't programmers.

What other candidates might there be?  How do they compare in terms of
intuitiveness?  The less time people need to spend reading the help
every time they build an expression, the better.

Agreed, ease of use is more important than sheer performance. However, I do not find 
the V8 syntax particularly obscure, at least in the examples Pirmin sent us.
In any case, this could be solved with a proper interface, wizard-style (anything 
ready for V8?).
Thanks Pirmin.

Hi,

I have a raster that is georeferenced. When I try to zoom to native
pixel resolution it zooms but definitely it is not native pixel
resolution.
Can anyone confirm this?

This works fine if I have just an unreferenced raster.


Is there any place to upload sample data?

Thanks

Sounds like an issue already known with a ticket in the bug tracker, but it
would be better to check. That is the place where attach sample data,
eventually file a new ticket:

Doesn't Qt's WebKit already contain a javascript interpreter?  Do we need
another one?

But I'd prefer something SQL like, that resembles what we use for PostGIS and
OGR query/subset strings.

 Hi Pirmin,

 Interesting - and thanks for your work.

 As a user I can live with different syntax as long as it is familiar. 
 Either Python, SQL or javascipt syntax would be fine for me. All three 
 are fairly common and documented.

 If it speeds up things substantially, I would happily switch to 
 javascript syntax.

Hi Bill,

I must correct me.

more preferable (better) then using the UUID should be use the MD%.

You could calculate the MD5 of the single record (or of the single
geometry).
And when you retry a new record with same MD5 you can understand that it
is the same record.

Thanks, Tim. The code is not 100% complete, but already testable. 
Because there are many changes, I'm expecting a large number of bugs. So 
any report about issues is greatly appreciated.

I see the WCS server querying things like raster layers to filter out
vector layers, limit non-writable formats, and so on. The hardest
issue I've yet to solve to my satisfaction is adding coverages through
a WCS transaction - my initial thoughts are to have a configuration
somewhere that describes in what format and where an added coverage
should be.

I agree there is much less need for the QGIS layer between a WCS
server and GDAL, but it did strike me as a good idea to add WCS
support to the suite of GIS services QGIS provides.

I've yet to have a deep look at the QGIS Server code, but I expect
there will be considerable overlap in the boilerplate code such as
formulating a response to a GetCapabilities request for instance, so
some light refactoring should yield some good, consistent results. I'm
easily convinced either way with regards to having a separate
executable or not. The advantage of having one executable for all
requests is that it's simpler to set up and will "just work". But
separate executables would make for potentially better load-balancing,
as well as avoiding monolithic "do everything" applications.

Thanks for the benchmark.

I have several things to note:
- it may be interesting to measure the proportion of time necessary
for field calculation / searching. I believe the the evaluation takes
just a small amount of time compared to time required for fetching of
features, therefore a fast engine might not necessarily speed things
up significantly
- V8 may be aware of the fact that the benchmarked expressions are
constant - and evaluate them during compilation, resulting in much
shorter execution time. It would be good to include a benchmark that
uses variables (column references).
- the engine implements three value logic (true/false/unknown) like in
SQL, while JavaScript (AFAIK) uses usual two value (true/false) logic.
How would you add support for NULL values in operators?
- Python is another language which could be used for the expressions -
with similar advantages as JavaScript

At some point we may support several languages for expressions
(ideally with just one evaluation engine). Regarding JavaScript, as
Juergen noted, there is already JavaScript engine in Qt, so adding V8
dependency looks like a high cost for the exchange of faster
expression evaluation. My impression is that such a state of the art
engine makes sense for web apps with thousands of lines in JavaScript,
but not that much for simple expressions.

Hi Marco

A problem with the github pull requests is that they cannot be assigned 
to a person. So it's very easy to forget about the requests.

A possibility would be to create a corresponding ticket on hub.qgis.org 
with a link to the pull request (in your case, the ticket should be 
assigned to Tim).

Regards,
Marco

Hi all.
I know next to nothing about OSX, so please forgive me if I'm saying something 
stupid; it seems to me that some important python libs (e.g. psycopg2, matplotlib, 
etc.) are not included in the package, and that there is not an easy way to add them 
(easy_install requires gcc, which requires macports, which requires xcode, which 
requires registration...).
Is there a reasonable solution to all this?
Thanks a lot.

 Hi J?rgen,

 Thank you for you work on the PostgreSQL provider.

 I have troubles with my views which worked before your refactoring. Now 
 I can load the layer, but the geometry is not displayed. I can display 
 the attribute table, but the primary key column is always NULL.

 Do you have an idea why my views do not display and why the primary 
 keys are NULL? I manually selected the pkey column as you described.

 Thanks a lot,
 Andreas

I have a few Python modules available on my site - including a few things that others have mentioned are needed by QGIS plugins.  There is a link on the QGIS download page in the optional list. (I haven't done matplotlib yet, but it's on my list)

Note: I don't think easy_install needs compilation, so you should be able to install easy_install without Xcode.  But that still doesn't help with python modules that need compilation.

FYI: gcc comes with Xcode, nothing to do with Macports.

easy_install matplotlib fails asking gcc-4.2.1

Thanks for clarifying.

Sounds like a bug.  Can you produce a testcase?   Debugging output might also
help.

/me too has 2 requests 'hanging':

- one to make it easier to increase/decrease the priority of a rule in 
rulebased renderings
- one to rake crs into account for spatial bookmarks (and make the 
fields editable)

Somebody time to have a look into it?

That would be very interesting (probably it can be tested much better 
now thanks to qgis_bench).

My only experience here was the WMS benchmark 2011 with many layers and 
a lot of expressions (osm data, a lot of classification rules, many 
layers). For requests with a lot of features in view, expression 
evaluation showed up considerably in the profiler, both in QGIS server 
and UMN mapserver. Yes, feature fetching wasn't considered (still 
cachegrind) and I don't have the cachegrind dumps at hand. However, it 
still shows that there are use-cases where evaluation is not neglectable.

Marco

 Hi,

 I installed a couple of days ago.

 I downloaded the apk-files on PC and transfered it to the SD-card of 
 the phone. Installation went fine, afterwards it downloaded qt 
 (ministro) automatically.

 I am on Android 2.3.6 (Samsung Galaxy Note).

 I have some issues though:

 - fonts too big
 - icons too small
 - spatialite not working

 Hi J?rgen,

 I am stilling trying to find out what causes the troubles.

 Some views work, some not. But all views have in common that the pkey 
 column is always NULL in the attribute column.

 So maybe for the views that work, QGIS finds an alternative column as a 
 pkey, while with other views that fail it doesn't find an alternative 
 pkey column?

 That's just a guess - but it is really strange that for all views the 
 pkey column attribute values are always null.

 Andreas

Thanks Andreas.
I am trying the "easy way", with the installer that downloads the package (apparently 
ok), then installs it and fails.
I have already a previous version, maybe it does not overwrite it?
All the best.

A generic one.

After the end of download, when writing to the card (I suppose): perhaps overwriting 
the existing installation is not allowed?

Hi Tim

no I do not have a working example. In general it should be something like this:

import qgis.utils
import qgis.gui

class MyQgisInterface(qgis.gui.QgisInterface):
  def __init__(self):
    QgisInterface.__init__(self)
  def mapCanvas(self):
    return FOO
  def mainWindow(self):
    return BAR
  def activeLayer(self):
    return BAZ
  # ... more methods ...

# use our interface instance
qgis.utils.iface = MyQgisInterface()

You will have to provide implementation of all the abstract virtual
functions defined in QgisInterface. Luckily most of them are not used
by plugins, so you may provide just implementations not
doing/returning anything - depending on how precisely would you like
to imitate QGIS environment.

Hi Marco

which implementation of expressions has been used in the benchmark -
the old one (search strings) or the new one? If you have some saved
callgrind dumps, I could have a look whether there are any issues that
could be optimized easily. If there are serious speed problems, then
we could start considering a better performing engine. Anyway as I
written in my earlier mail, there may be issues with with supporting
3-value logic.

Richard,

I may eventually have a look at that, however in meanwhile I have been
baking a redesigned rule-based renderer with better functionality (to
be finished soon), so that patch you provided will not be necessary...

Thanks Martin. Yes I have used the same approach in openModeller
desktop some years ago to allow it to use QGIS (C++) plugins - I was
just interested to know if someone had already baked a python
equivalent in keeping with DRAY (dont repeat anyone else :-)).

I'll go ahead and make an attempt at a python one then, thanks.

Tim

Hi,

you can find an example at [1], namely a class called "QgisInterface" in
the postgis_viewer.py, line 313.

Hope it helps.

Also if you are thinking about actions, it would be nice to have a new
maptool called 'feature action' that runs an action directly when
clicking a feature (or maybe pops up an action list when more than one
action has been defined for a layer). The actions is such cool
functionality but the number of mouse clicks required makes it too far
away to be convenient to use.

Tim you read my mind :)

Something else which I have thought of, which expands on Tims idea, is to
be able to have the action show up as it's own toolbar button.

nice idea, but...
... the tool "do action" is ready yet, so I'll have to change its name ;)

I'm going to commit everything this evening I hope.

Hi all

Regarding the initial thread: I finally managed to debug and unit test
Python plugins outside QGIS with Ecplise IDE and PyDev under Windows.
It's documented here (I'm sorry it's german and not yet english):

I wonder if we shouldn't look for a more portable solution to accommodate those developing on Windows---one that doesn't require bash and git...

Hi Juergen,

I just tested d5431b3 and I think there is a regression in functionality. 

I used to be able to load a PostGIS layer that contained both polygon and multi-polygon features. Now the geometry type is set to polygon only, and I don't see the multi-polygon geometries. Unless I use the API I have no way to see these multipolgons at all now.

Cheers,
Jeremy

To: "live-demo@lists.osgeo.org" <live-demo@lists.osgeo.org>


This came up on another OSGeo list and I thought it might be good for us
to look at. It's a web tool for managing translations and supports reST
(or whatever Sphinx is using) and svn integration all through a web
portal. So no need for translators to download anything, just log in and
translate.

It's called Pootle
http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/features

Backed in Django. I don't have time right now since I'm working on the
build infrastructure but if someone else wants to setup a test instance
possibly on the osgeo adhoc machine I'd be happy to lend support.

Thanks,
Alex

That feature would close http://hub.qgis.org/issues/119

Also see http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4262 and
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4211 if you're improving actions.

HI

I took a quick browse around - pootle looks like a great tool. Our
original plan was to allow translators to directly edit the rst docs
on github - simple and requiring no infrastructure from us. Pootle
offers some advantages over this - but has anyone used it in earnest?
How will it deal with updates to the original source docs?

Regards

Tim

Bash hater :-) Ok yes we could rewrite it in python easily enough I
think. Not sure when I will get around to it.

Sorry yes I should have posted here about this too - last month I

tinker with the config we could give it a spin.

the point is that with this tools it should be easy to keep the translations updated: 
the translator should not search around in the main doc to find what is changed, but 
they will be shown the strings changed in the original, to be translated.

Please do it in a coordinated fashion: we have in QGIS a couple of Django experts 
willing to help, let's do it together.

All the best.

There are already solutions for this around, at least in Faunalia and GIS-Lab I 
think. Please let's share them and come out with a common solution.

Right, there is a simple solution for SVN at GIS-Lab, description can
be found here http://gis-lab.info/qa/qgis-repo-update.html (sorry, only
Russian now, but Google translate available from right panel).

There is another solution for SVN published at GIS-Lab blogs [0] (in
Russian). And finally I have my own script which is very similar to one
used by Faunalia.

If needed I can prepare translations for fisrt two solutions.

Hi,

I think Werner had a look at pootle during the hackfest in Poland. And I
remember that it looked like a good tool for the GUI (.po) files online
translations, but at that time not for documentation or manual pages. 

But maybe I am wrong and it has changed.

Regards
Otto

Hi,

Yes.. I was right about to answer .. I took a look at pootle together
with volker at the HF in Wroclaw ..
It looked really nice but at that time it was not really able to
handle .ts files and unfortunately it was rather slow ..
That is more than 1 Year ago .. so probably a lot has changed and we
should give it a try again ..
Making the translation easier would be a huge advance..

I also tried transifex (www.transifex.net) but from my point of view it
is not really what we are looking for ..
(But I already reserved the name qgis on transifex - just to be sure)
Looking at it I see that also transifex has improved since my last
visit .. So probably we should start a new round and give the tools a
chance ..

I welcome every improvement that helps our translators 

thanks for your help to all of you

kind regards
Werner

 There have been recent Postgis fixes from J?rgen (yesterday night). But 
 I am not sure if your problem is also fixed.

 The pkey issues was fixed and also the issue that one could not load 
 views that did not have an entry in the public.geometry_columns table.

Hi,

I was just talking to Astrid Emde and Lars Lingner. They have experience
using rst in the Mapserver and OSGeo-Live project and they are satisfied
with that for the documentation. I will get more information about their
method the next days. 

From the OSGeo Live project I know that they use OmegaT (a desktop tool) for
the translations in combination with subversion. Haven't seen anything about
git supporty yet, will check more, but the tool works quite well, I tested
it.

As soon as I know more about the tool chain (sphinx, svn, ...) they use for
their project documentation, I write it to the list and we can decide, if
that's, what we want to use for the documentation. 

For GUI translations of .ts files, pootle might be a good solution. At least
we could test it again.

Regards
Otto

Hi,

here is another experience from the method of the mapserver documentation
translation, also see:
http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/wiki/DocumentationTranslation

It doesn't seem to be perfect, but still better than our current solution, I
guess ;).

This is mainly because at the time the MapServer developers set up
their documentation infrastructure, Sphinx DID NOT support
internationalization, and now it will take some time to migrate it.
But, as suggested in my previous email on a different thread, now
Sphinx 1.1 DOES support internationalization, and should not be too
much complicated to set up an infrastructure based with it and Pootle
in the middle as the end user translator application [1].

Message-ID: <9424F555B110DF4E9C84BF44ECE916E2BD01@VNVBRWEX4.net.vlr.gv.at>

Dear colleagues,

I'm not able to set up the Python environment for standalone applications correctly, allthough there are several documentations on the internet -> I am using this one http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/intro.html#python-applications<https://mail.fh-kaernten.at/OWA/redir.aspx?C=b37cd8b6f76a410f8070b7012d662950&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.qgis.org%2fpyqgis-cookbook%2fintro.html%23python-applications>, but I still get the error message

"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 1, in <module>
    import PyQt4.QtGui
ImportError: No module named PyQt4.QtGui


These steps I have allready done (QGIS (Standalone) Installation Path: "C:\Programme\QGIS")

- PYTHONPATH = C:\Programme\QGIS\apps\Python25
- PATH = C:\Programme\QGIS\bin; C:\Programme\QGIS\apps\qgis\bin;%PATH%

I am slowly but surely getting frustrated, even though I haven't really started... ;-)

I'm glad for every hint!

Hi all.
With the new pg provider, sveral layers (apparently those without oa PK) are loaded 
but not shown.
Anyone confirms?
All the best.

Hi Gary,
Yes, you are right, but I still geht the error message with just the line "from qgis.core import *":

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 1, in <module>
    from qgis.core import *
ImportError: No module named qgis.core

I am a bit confused, because http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/intro.html#python-applications is just talking about TWO environment variables (PAYTHONPATH & PATH), but http://geographicprimitive.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/setting-up-pyqgis-development-environment-with-pydev-on-windows/ is talking about THREE (PYTHONPATH, PATH, PYTHONHOME) - but both end in the same error...

 Hi Paolo,

 Are they views or real tables?

 I had problems with views that weren't registered in the 
 geometry_columns table, but J?rgens recent fix from yesterday evening 
 fixed these issues.

 With my data everything looks good now with the most recent builds.

Tested again with current trunk. I think this is the issue:

The table has no column suitable for use as a key. Quantum GIS requires a primary 
key, a PostgreSQL oid column or a ctid for tables.

Query: DECLARE qgisf4 BINARY CURSOR FOR SELECT asbinary("st_union",'NDR'),oid FROM 
"public"."buffer_union2" WHERE "st_union" && setsrid('BOX3D(712012.2051045278785750

Create a copy of the qgis.bat file in bin and replace the last line with a call
your python(w) script in the copy.  That should help.

Hi,
I think that pdf should be generated from latex source, because latex
is the best tool for producing pdf (IMHO).

So conversion from rst to latex is necessary. But I know it is not easy task.

Hi all.
Thanks to ongoing support from Regione Toscana, and to the brain&fingers of Giuseppe 
Sucameli, now actions are IOHO substantially improved:
* now we have a button to launch actions directly from the canvas
* new expressions builder engine can be used to evaluate feature actions
* possibility of adding custom patterns for replacement (e.g. $clickx and $clicky to 
use the coordinates of the clicked point)
* cleanup of the interface:
. move the "capture output" checkbox away from the "insert field" combo
. display add and update buttons below the edit action widget (following the "new 
shapefile" UI style).

Feedback welcome.
All the best.

Could you try to run qgis.g.info in GRASS shell on your raster:

   your_path_to_qgis_dir/lib/qgis/grass/modules/qgis.g.info
info=colors rast=your_raster

it should output color table, something like

1.000000e+00 5.500000e+00 0 255 0 255 255 0
5.500000e+00 1.000000e+01 255 255 0 255 0 0

Do you have the same problem on more computers?

I just tested it out on OSX - works beautifully! And the new action
icon is a welcome addition to the toolbar!

Many thanks

Going back to this, to me it generally makes sense to use external, powerful, well 
maintained libraries, instead of rewriting on our own.
All the best.

I personally would like to see Python exposed for use with expressions
first, before looking at adding javascript style support.

I also don't think it makes much sense to try to use V8 when Qt already
comes with a javascript interpreter that can handle Qt objects.

Hi J?rgen, Gary, Richard etc.
Thanks for your support! My problem was, that I have allready installed python 2.6 for ArcGIS and this caused my problems when running my python script! I am not able to run arcpy 2.6 and pyqgis 2.5 together - has someone experience with arcpy (python 2.6) and pyqgis running together?

I haven't experienced for arcpy + pyqgis, but I had the same problem
running arcpy + ogr lib.

Whith which python version are you trying this ? Inside the 2.5 qgis python
or the 2.6 arcpy python ?

For my part, I had to use a 2.6 python (native, with connections to ogr),
and import inside it arcpy, using an external file to "trick" arcpy.
Can't say anymore now as I'm not on this computer, but I'll give you my
complete solution later in the day.

Cheers,

Robin

I am trying inside 2.5 qgis and now it works, but my arcpy scripts (2.6) don't work anymore - and the same vice versa...

I am looking forward for your solution!

Hi J?rgen, Gary, Richard etc.
Thanks for your support! My problem was, that I have allready installed python 2.6 for ArcGIS and this caused my problems when running my python script! I am not able to run arcpy 2.6 and pyqgis 2.5 together - has someone experience with arcpy (python 2.6) and pyqgis running together?

Create a copy of the qgis.bat file in bin and replace the last line with a call your python(w) script in the copy.  That should help.

I have noticed in the latest version of QGIS from OSGEO4W that I am able
to make MapInfo tab files editable but when I try and save the edits it
errors with 

Could not commit changes to layer Pond Locations

Errors: ERROR: 1 attribute value change(s) not applied.

The Toggle Editing Mode and Save Edits buttons are available on the main
QGIS dialog window but are greyed out on attribute table dialog.

Is this a bug?

Done, thanks.
Also, it would be good if someone would add the procedure to send a patch (now a pull

Yes.
OK, got it: it comes from r.external, so apparently the colors are applied only to 
"real" rasters, not r.external ones.
Should I file a bug?

Hi to all,
I'm new to QGis and I'm trying to access SDE layers. I've successfully
created a database connection towards my SDE and
on add vectorial layer I'm able to see all layer contained in my
database. When I load a layer I see it for a few seconds but then it
disappear.

Is there any log file where I can see what happens? Unfortunately I'm
using Windows so when I launch qgis.exe from console it doesn't stay
in foreground...

Best regards,
Flavio

Hi all.
We currently have only a few (13) issues marked as urgent, and another 31 as high 
priority. Several of them have a patch attached (e.g. [0]) or are just asking for a 
backport. Would it be possible to have a look and check if a fix is possible?
Also, it is possible that some of them are actually of lower priority: if someone 
spots one, it would be good to downgrade, so we could concentrate on the remaining 
ones for a possible next release.
Thanks a lot.

Hi all,

have someone experiences with VisTrails (VT)? According the discuss on ML
about using it for a workflow builder I have spent some times with VT. And I
started think about using external library or write it without dependencies
on it. As Paolo mentioned:

"I think we better avoid external dependencies unless necessary.
Furthermore, I do not know VT, but it seems far from production-ready, and
its scope seems to considerably overlap that of QGIS."

That's right. VT is more than we need and now it's not good for integrated
into another program. For me looks better to write workflow builder without
dependencies, just with using Qt and its Graphics View Framework.

So what do you think about it?

Regards,
Zdenek

Has anyone considered adapting the Orange framework for this task?

  http://orange.biolab.si/features.html

Orange is written in Python and provides dataflow analysis through a
"connect the boxes" interface similar to the ArcGIS  model builder. There
could be some good ideas there that QGIS can adopt.

Would it be possible to move (or echo) the list on the first page?

I think we should come out with an unified solution, and make it available in the 
easiest possible way for plugin developers.
Thanks.

Probably better to file a ticket for Ale on redmine for this - he
likes to work against tickets.

How are you connecting to SDE? Via ogr? I know some Australians have
been talking about building a native SDE driver for QGIS, though I
dont know how far it is.

I'm not sure if there is any easy way to capture the debugging info
under windows other than setting up the build environment and running
it under the debugger (its not that hard to do and is documented well
but may be more effort than you are willing to put in).

Are you trying to mix arcpy scripts and QGIS scripts? I'm not much of
a windows guy but in the past I got things working by doing something
like this:

myapp.bat:
------------------

SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\PROGRA~1\QUANTU~1
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\o4w_env.bat
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\gdal16.bat\apps
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Tethys\bin;C:\Program
Files\Quantum GIS Tethys\apps\qgis\bin
set PYTHONPATH=C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Tethys\apps\qgis\python
c:\Python25\python.exe myapp.py

myapp.py:
------------------

import sys
sys.path.append("C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Tethys\apps\qgis\python")
import qgis.core


Which is pretty much J?rgens solution with an added explicit path
defination from within your initial python app.

Regards

Tim

What Graphical toolkit are they using? VT has the advantage of being
Qt based too so from that respect it is probably a better match for
integration into QGIS.

Czenda, I know some folks who have been using VT with QGIS quite a lot
- pop me a note if you would like me to put you in contact with them.

2005 is not supported - you need to use MSVC 2008 (including the free
express version). See windows section in this file for the officially
supported build procedure.

As far as I can tell, Orange is based on PyQt as shown by the main GUI

Interesting - I am downloading it now. VT is powerful but not so
newbie friendly so it would be nice to see how orange compares...

I truly love tickets, but unfortunately this is not in any way related
with the Django plugins website (nor with me).

AFAIK Pirmin is taking care of the Redmine part.

"Unfortunately" it works for me also with external rasters. There must
be something else particular with your raster.

You can check if the color table is read by grass provider:

    qgis 2>&1 | grep colorTable

and it should print something like

qgsgrassrasterprovider.cpp: 296: (colorTable) Entered
qgsgrassrasterprovider.cpp: 316: (colorTable) color 1 0 255 0
qgsgrassrasterprovider.cpp: 322: (colorTable) color 5.5 255 255 0
qgsgrassrasterprovider.cpp: 322: (colorTable) color 10 255 0 0

> Should I file a bug?

Probably yes, if possible please attach a piece of your external
raster if the problem is realy reproducible with that on different
computers.

Message-ID: <91874956.20120115005958@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

We've  succesfully  wrapped  up  our  FSC forests monitoring project I
talked  a  little  bit  about  in  Lisbon and I'd like to make a quick
announcement  on  availability  of  another  result  of this project -
ZonalStats plugin.

ZonalStats  is  a Python extension of core Zonal Statistics plugin by Marco
and additionally:

- doesn't modify zones shapefile used
- aggregates by zones
- outputs to CSV
- creates simple HTML report

Available from GIS-Lab repo.

We've been asked why don't we move our plugins to official repo. The
reason  is  that  autopackaging is unavailable. We maintain 16 plugins
and it will be a pain to switch to manual. If someone doesn't like the
idea   for  some  reason,  it  would  make  sense to add on/off switch
for autopackaging in official repo.

Localizations    of   the   descriptions   are  also  something  we're
concerned  about  and  it is unfortunate  that  right  now  we  cannot
provide our users localized descriptions of the plugins.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] path to the qgs file for qgis-server
Message-ID: <4F1333A7.1050707@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm study-ing the qgis-server.
I notice to call the qgis-server is need to pass also the file-map and 
it eventually path.
like this:

http://localhost/cgi/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?MAP=/home/~user/map-files/test.qgs

this is a bit complicated url.
Because if I should decide to change the path to the file-map
this mean the url will change for any user using this qgis-server.

I like to know if there is some other method to set qgis-server where 
find the file map.

Thx,

Andrea.

Hi Andrea

It is also possible to call QGIS server without map parameter and to 
place the .qgs file into the same directory as the qgis_mapserv.fcgi 
executable.

In practice, a better solution is to use Apache URL rewriting 
(mod_rewrite) to hide the location of the .qgs file from the client. 
Like this, you can use nice URLs and if the locations of the .qgs files 
change, the server administrator adapts the config accordingly.

Regards,
Marco

Hi all,

Did someone noticed a problem with fieldNameMap from vector data provider?

I get this error:

layer.dataProvider().fieldNameMap()
AttributeError: 'QgsVectorDataProvider' object has no attribute 
'fieldNameMap'


I got this, both for postgis and memory layers.


Thanks,

Apparently not - it was missing from the python binding.  Fixed in d8bdcb20.

what exactly do you mean by "autopackaging" ? The new repo now offers
API for uploading new versions of plugins - automatic deployment with
a script should not be a problem anymore.

That would require:
1. support in plugins' metadata.txt file. We could add a section in
the metadata.txt file for each locale - e.g. [general-ru] for Russian
in addition to [general] section.
2. support in QGIS (to show localized texts in plugin
installer/manager). Should be relatively easy to add
3. support in the repository. This might need more work (due to
changes in database structure) to allow the plugin installer to ask
for localized plugin list, something like this:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?lang=ru

Thanks Maxim, quite useful. I got a blank popup and some warnings:

(qgis.bin:27188): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to retrieve the file info for 
`file:///home/paolo/Desktop/butta/zonal': Errore nell'eseguire lo stat del file 
"/home/paolo/Desktop/butta/zonal": File o directory non esistente

Then it returns a:
Warning: 0
for each geometry, and seems to stop.

All the best, and thanks.

Hi all.
Testing the new cache records feature, it is unclear to me how it works: it seems 
slower than before for larger tables, and after opening and closing a table (110k 
records) several times, with a large cache (100k) I got a crash:
<class 'qgis.core.QgsVectorLayer'>
<class 'qgis.core.QgsVectorLayer'>

This  might  be  our not following up on recent changes on this. We'll
check and get back on that soon ;) Thanks for info.

So, localizations will require coordinated effort, if someone leads we
are ready to contribute some manpower to code things up. Lets do it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] addFeatures without knowing new feature's id, bug?
Message-ID: <4F141231.6000006@gmail.com>

Hi again!

I am trying to add a feature to a PostGIS table, in which there is a 
serial primary key 'id'.

Without defining id, here is what I get when I try addFeatures:
ERROR: null value in column "id" violates not-null constraint

and I tried
iid  = self.layer.dataProvider().fieldNameIndex('id')
if iid != -1: 
f.addAttribute(iid,'nextval(distribution.dimension_id_seq::regclass)')
which leaded to
ERROR: invalid input syntax for integer: 
"nextval(distribution.dimension_id_seq::regclass)"

Is there a bug in the provider, or should I get first the new id (if 
yes, how do I do this) ?

Thanks a lot!
Denis

I did a brief test here - using a simple expression:

"depth" / 3

applied to the depth field resulted in all nulls. I was expecting it
to replace the original value - though I'm not sure if that is an
underlying issue or something introduced with your changes.

Tim,

Bugger, I'll check it out.

What kind of column was it, int, double?

I had a test with current master and it doesn't seem to have this issue, so
I'll test my branch a bit more.  I didn't change much in that "logic" part
of the calculator mainly just removing old gui references but I'll check it
out anyway.

Hi all,

I'm testing with a 145k records table and I don't get the crash, but
loading take indeed much longer then before (this feature was added).

I'm also puzzled by the "attribute table row cache" parameter because it
doesn't seem to speed up the process of opening the table of attributes
(it start to re-fetch records from the beginning), even if I set it to a
high number as 100000 that seems the limit (the higher limit shouldn't
be higher?)

cheers

Are you trying to mix arcpy scripts and QGIS scripts? I'm not much of a windows guy but in the past I got things working by doing something like this:

myapp.bat:
------------------

SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\PROGRA~1\QUANTU~1
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\o4w_env.bat
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\gdal16.bat\apps
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Tethys\bin;C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Tethys\apps\qgis\bin set PYTHONPATH=C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Tethys\apps\qgis\python c:\Python25\python.exe myapp.py

myapp.py:
------------------

import sys
sys.path.append("C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Tethys\apps\qgis\python") import qgis.core


Which is pretty much J?rgens solution with an added explicit path defination from within your initial python app.

Regards

Tim

Ok I can replicate - procedure to replicate:

Populate a real field with a constant e.g. 1.5
Save layer

Edit layer again
Open calculator

Tick update existing field
Field: currentdep

Enter this formula:

 "currentdep"  / 3

(note that the field is self referenced, i.e. its referencing the
field it is updating).

Also note the buttonbox is not stretching all the way across the dialog.

It's not supposed to speed up loading - it's just to avoid reloading.

Before it would first fetch all ids from the provider and then fetch each
visible row by id.  When scrolling it would fetch the rows that became visible
and when scrolling back reload what was visible before from the provider.

The caching avoids the latter.  The n last fetched lines are cached, so the
rows don't need to be reloaded and visiting areas that you've already been to
should be quicker (eg. jumping to the end of the list and back to the
start).  Once you close the attribute table, the cache is also destroyed.

OK, maybe I did it too complicated: the r.external command was applied to a .vrt 
raster, not to a "real" one.

Also, the very long time to load the raster may be indicative of some problem.

Thanks.

oh, yes, I do not have other clues.
Will look how to replicate it.
It comes from the terminal from where I launched QGIS.

You could setup a DEFAULT value for the id column in PostgreSQL (like SERIAL
does it).

QGIS interprets that as string and tries to stuff it into the integer column
which obviously fails.

You could use QgsDataProvider::maximumValue() to fetch it and increment it
yourself.  But that might still produce concurrency problems, if multiple people
work in parallel.  I'd stick with a DEFAULT in PostgreSQL.

I compiled your branch tonight. I havent tested with a lot of data
sets yet, but two things I immediately noticed were:

- with one of my ecw images the computer began to undergo very high
cpu load with each  zoom / pan event when using bilinear or cubic
interpolation. Unfortunately the dataset is too large for me to share
with you right now - I will try to upload it for you when I get a
chance.
- I noticed a shift (guesstimating in the order of 5-10 pixels) when
switching between the interpolation algorithms

Otherwise (with the test images I have used thus far) it creates nice
smooth tones where before they look pixelated which is great!

I like to avoid to mix cgi executables from other configuration and

I don't know the rewrite solution, I don't use apache.
However I guess my web server will have sometime like the apache rewrite.

Thx for hints.

Hi Tim

Yes, I reduced the shift a bit last Saturday. But there is still a shift 
remaining because of double -> int rounding.

There are other known issues with the resampler branch right now:

- With paletted singleband rasters, color changes don't take effect
- There is a small bug with restoring the resampling method

That will be very usefull. I noticed I didn't really test with a layer 
containing pyramides.

Thanks for testing,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding attributes to data provider, python
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E0E1373D01A@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All 

Since updating QGIS (from 1.6 I think) several plugins I use are no longer working properly, because of the issue raised as bug 4687 http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4687.  

Basically they are using the approach in the python cookbook for creating memory layers using the data provider addAttributes.  This was broken by the change adding the table-join feature, which requires the vector layer to maintain cached attribute data.   This no longer works without also calling the vector layer updateFieldMap() member function, put in to support the table-join feature.

Options I can see for fixing are:

1) Add a call to updateFieldMap() in pendingFields(), so that the field list is updated every time it is accessed.  Simple, possibly inefficient, but probably very little practical impact.

2) Accept the breaking change, and require many plugins to be updated.  We already have to call updateExtents if we add features via the provider, so calling updateFieldMap is consistent. (For the memory provider we can also include the fields in the uri, in which case they are handled correctly). 

3) Modify QGIs to update the field map when vector layers are added to the layer registry - this will fix most plugins, as  the pattern is generally to create the layer, add attributes to the memory provider, then  register the layer.  This seems a bit messy as registry doesn't know it is dealing with a vector layer.

4) Have the provider signal changes to the schema, which the layer can use to trigger an update.  Hard to implement (many different providers) and inconsistent with the rest of the code.

My inclination is to option 1, and option 2 for significant plugins to support users of version 1.7. 

Any thoughts on better alternatives?

Very good,
I appreciate also the side effects like moving rendering methods to
QgsRasterRenderer.

Have you considered a possibility to pass resampling to a driver in
case it supports resampling? At least GDAL supports resampling,
currently used GDALRasterIO does not,  GDALWarp does. GDALWarp was
slow with reprojection, I don't know if resampling is better.

I am especially concerned about reprojection, because reprojection of
images oversampling^2 times bigger may be significantly slower.

Maybe just resampling before reprojection could be considered.

Question for all: is it better to resample images before or after
reprojection? I am thinking especially about dissimilar projections
where resolution ratio between source and destination is not constant
over the extent.

Hi

I've just updated a python plugin on plugins.qgis.org.  It has come up with some emssages about homepage, tracker and repository field being empty, and a suggestion for creating a project on hub.qgis.org.

All sounds good, so I went to hub.qgis.org, logged in, and created a project. 

But I can't see any way to add any content to the project (ie to upload the files).  Is there any documentation anywhere to assist with this?

Thanks
Chris

Hi J?rgen,

Thanks for your reply.

Yesterday, I used the max+1 solution, but as you say this not optimal. I 
will try to define it safely.

But I already have a serial in my table: CREATE TABLE mytable (id serial 
NOT NULL);
I also tried to define on my own:
CREATE SEQUENCE mytable_id_seq ;
CREATE TABLE mytable (id integer DEFAULT nextval('mytable_id_seq') NOT 
NULL);
but it is strictly the same.

If you have any clue, it's great! I'm a little bit lost.

Isn't because QGIS is trying to write each field, ie:
INSERT INTO table (id,field1,field2,...) VALUES ('','val1','val2',...)
instead of doing
INSERT INTO table (field1,field2,...) VALUES ('val1','val2',...) ?

Btw, if you want to have a look on how I created the feature (I might 
have do something wrong), here at lines 95-113
https://github.com/3nids/Triangulation/blob/ba601c44282ba31c20c3484d123bff8241fbdc7e/place_arc.py 


Thanks again!

Greetings,
Denis

Hi Chris,
the infrastructure is still to be polished. I'm trying to fix this, you're welcome to 
help us. My opinion is that the process should be much more automatic.
All the best.

E: /var/cache/apt/archives/libgeos++-dev_3.3.1-4oneiric1_amd64.deb: 
trying to overwrite '/usr/lib/libgeos-3.3.1.so', which is also in

I hve the package libgeos-c1 listed in broken dependencies.

I cannot build QGIS from source anymore, as the needed packages are not

Message-ID: <CAL5Q673qqoYtVTtR3hhHvEmJmeQZABFmj+je23G_RP=s9gnYCw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

after the latest discussions on this list and on the tracker the
plugin situations has never been so confused.

This is a long email, please take a long breath and read it :)

I've been working on the new Plugin repository since the Lisbon
meeting, and I wish to summarize my (very personal) view about this
topic.

we have two actors: plugins users and plugins authors, let's call them

* users
* authors

we have a few of logical software tiers:

* QGIS client
* plugin repositories (let's focus on the "official" one)
* plugin code SCM repositories (git, mercurial, SVN let's focus on the
"official" one)
* plugin trackers
* website (for news, wiki, blogs, forums etc....)

This is the current implementation of the server tiers:

* plugin repository: Django application
* plugin code SCM repository: Redmine with integrated git SCM
* plugin trackers: Redmine
* website: scattered on the Django application and some other tools
(Joomla etc.)


There is currently no integration between Django app and Redmine, they
only share authentication via OSGEO LDAP.


1 User actions
---------------------

1.1 - search, browse available plugins
this can be done from the QGIS client GUI (via plugins.xml served by
the web Django application) or the web Django application which is the
ultimate source of data in any case.

1.2 - install plugins on the client, this can be done from the QGIS
client GUI (via plugins.xml served by the web Django application).

1.3 - report bugs, propose features, rate the plugin
this can be split in sub-actions (find the tracker URL if any or send
an email message o to the authorl etc. etc.).


2 Author actions
------------------------

2.1 - write the plugins: I cannot help you here, sorry ;-)
2.2 - upload the plugins on the repo
2.3 - maintain a SCM system
2.4 - manage tickets, fix bugs... maintain the code and interact with users


Discussion topics
--------------------------

Numbers refer to the items above.

1.1 - Recently, I've read about having another plugin home page on
Redmine plugin subproject, what's the purpose of having another
plugins list  on hub.qgis.org when we have the main repository on
plugins.qgis.org. Do we really want to duplicate all? How will the two
be kept in sync?

1.3 In my view, the action of retrieving informations about the
tracker URL or send a message to the author can be done through the
Django application, either directly or through the QGIS client GUI via
webservices. More complicated tasks like filing a ticket should be
done from the users directly in the GUI of the application that the
author has chosen as his preferred tracker system (see below).

2.3/2.4 - forcing authors to use the Redmine SCM and tracker
I strongly disagree: I don't think that having a single SCM code
repository for all plugins is a priority, I myself I'm not going to
use Redmine but will continue to host my plugins on github, will I be
banned from the repository for that? What we can do (and we do it
already) is to force authors to have *one* tracker and *one* code
repository and we can suggest them to create one on Redmine. Set aside
the freedom concerns, I understand that some plugins are over 10K LOC
and a new release per week, but some others are just a few lines (and
still very useful) and are not updated frequently, do their authors
really need to learn complicated procedures in order to share a
plugin? I even suspect that having a SCM should be mandatory, it
doesn't always make sense for smaller plugins.

2.2/2.3 - autopackaging and other black magic

AN XML_RPC WEBSERVICE FOR THE UPLOAD OF NEW PLUGINS AND PLUGIN
VERSIONS IS ALREADY AVAILABLE

I personally think that every author will use its own Makefile/bash
script/python script/lua script/say your script/ to perform the
actions of bumping the version, packaging and uploading on the repo
(YES: BELIEVE ME: THIS CAN BE DONE NOW FROM A SCRIPT VIA XML_RPC
WEBSERVICE). What we can do is to add the few lines to call the upload
ws (examples are available and already posted on this list) to the
plugin creator plugin's makefile.

My conclusions
-----------------------

I think that Redmine is useful and can be used as the "suggested"
tracker and SCM system but we must allow authors to use an external
tracker or SCM if they like.
Integration between the Django application and Redmine is advisable
for the optional creation of new subprojects (tracker and SCM) if the
plugin author wants. I don't think that autopackaging worths some work
because I believe that every author does its own way and because it's
so easy to write a script that manages this on the author's client
machine.

Thanks if you read so far, I just hope that now the plugin situation
it's not more complicate than it was before :)

I'm looking forward to read your thoughts about this topics.

PS: I don't like dictators (even the benevolent ones)

I managed to rebuild QGIS by unchecking ubuntugis-unstable and debian-nightly
in my sources.
I don't know if it is my fault to have more than needed sources or if this
is a sources conflict.

Sorry for disturbing, maybe it helps for the sources.

Right, please avoid duplication. We should make it easy to find the "right" page, and 
remove (or hide) others.

I do not think anybody ever suggested to force anybody to do anything.
My opinion:
- we should have a standard path, fully automatic, to make life easy for plugin writers
- if anybody wants to follow alternative routes, this must be possible
- an SCM is always good, as it makes easier to cooperate; we already have plugins 
that need small fixes, and we'll have more in the near future, due to API breakage; 
sometimes plugin writers are not very responsive, so others could quickly fix a 
broken plugin (and it is far easier to fix them all once one knows which API is 
broken than forcing many authors to learn how to do it)
- a bugtracker of some sort is a requirement: I think nobody wants to use software 
without a proper bug tracking system

OK, this seems the best solution. As you imply, it is currently rather hidden for 
authors.

In general, I think we should better document the whole process, that now looks far 
more complicated than it is.

-1: remeber that what is very easy for one can be a stumbling block for others; for 
several authors, writing a QGIS-py plugin is one of the first serious programming 
tasks they encounter, so let's make their life easier.
Anyway, I think most of the issues (if not all) can be fixed with proper, clear, and 
easy to find documentation of the whole process (a complete howto from scratch): any 
volunteer?

> PS: I don't like dictators (even the benevolent ones)

I think nobody likes them here (and this is one of the reasons why working on QGIS is 
such a pleasure).

All the best, and thanks Alessandro for your work and commitment to the project.

plugins.qgis.org should be the canonical list of plugins. The plugins
on hub.qgis.org do not have to be in 1:1 relation. I would not waste
time trying to keep them in sync.

Agreed. Providing links to plugin's home page and/or tracker should be
sufficient.

I completely agree with Alessandro.

The problem with plugins duplicating other plugins' work is not that
the plugin authors are unable to cooperate because plugins are
scattered everywhere. It is because coordinated development needs much
more time than a one man show.

I hoped to build a plugin for plugin developers to facilitate some
development tasks, think FireBug for QGIS. The plugin would be shipped
 with QGIS (but disabled by default). The intended functionality:
- reload a plugin (integrate code from reloader from Borys)
- package+upload a plugin (using xml_rpc service from Alessandro)
- verbose python error reporting (show variable values in contexts)
- miscellaneous debugging tools

I did not have time to build such a thing yet. Any effort in this
direction would be welcome and it would further facilitate plugin
development.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] cannot call
	QgsVectorDataProvider.changeGeometryValues() from python
Message-ID: <4F15502A.90705@gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried to call changeGeometryValues from a plugin without any success. 
I tried with a dictionnary, a list and a set.

changeGeometryValues is expecting a QgsGeometryMap. As I undestrood, 
there is no equivalent for QMap in python, and I should use a dict...but 
I get this error:
TypeError: QgsVectorDataProvider.changeGeometryValues(): argument 1 has 
unexpected type 'dict'

I can use the QgsVectorLayer.changeGeometry() but I have to startEditing 
and commitChanges, and I also think it might be slower.

Should I post a bug in the tracker or did I do something wrong?

Thanks a lot.

The problem here is that resampling sometimes can only be done once you 
know the pixel color. E.g. in case of paletted raster, two adjacent 
pixel values can have totally different color (therefore resampling 
needs to be done on color components, not on raster value). I guess that 
this is the reason why GDALRasterIO does not support resampling (and is 
implemented in GDALWarp and UMN mapserver on a higher level, comparable 
to QgsRasterLayer).
How is it with GRASS? it probably has the resampling on a lower level?

>I am especially concerned about reprojection, because reprojection of

  True, I need to do some more tests here. At the moment, the 
oversampling rate is kept at a maximum of 4 (that should probably be a 
user option later). Ok, maximum 16 times more data to reproject 
(hopefully no problem with your approximative reprojection :-) ).

Relatively soon, I'd like to implement the option to select different 
resampling types for zoomed-in and zoomed-out situations. Often, people 
like to have e.g. bilinear for zoomed-in and average for zoomed out.

Marco

Hi Paolo

Plugins cannot be used in QGIS server. The way to go is to modify the

few minutes ago Jef fixed it in changeset 70288272f752...

Now calling the addFeature method w/o set the value for
the pk field in the attributeMap, the postgres provider uses
the pk's default value.

Please, try again and report here.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with Postgis 2.0 Views and picking
	(info-tool)
Message-ID: <4F15FF42.4030004@carto.net>

Hi,

I recently experimented again with Postgis 2.0 again. I noticed while
loading the Views works fine, that I cannot pick an object with the info
tools.

It works fine with regular tables, but fails for views.

Here is the error message I get in the log:
-----------------------
Fetching from cursor qgisf0 failed
Database error: ERROR:  Operation on mixed SRID geometries

Query: CLOSE qgisf0 returned 7 [ERROR:  current transaction is aborted,
commands ignored until end of transaction block
]

1 cursor states lost.
SQL: CLOSE qgisf0
Result: 7 (ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands ignored
until end of transaction block
)

-----------------

The error message about the mixed geometries is strange, since the view
and the project have the same SRID.

Any idea what could be wrong here? Currently I only have a Postgis 2.0
database available, so I can't test with Postgis 1.5 at the same time.
Maybe with a virtual machine ...

You don't need a virtual machine. PostGIS 2.0 and 1.5 can cohexist in the
same database cluster. I do have pg14, pg15 and pg20 databases on my 
PostgreSQL 8.4 install. There's nothing special to do, install all versions
and only load each of the versions .sql file into each of the target
databases.

Hi Andreas,

I have similar problems, but with Postgis 1.5.
I posted last week on qgis and postgis users: 
http://old.nabble.com/MultiPoint-to-CircularString-to-LineString-td33132890.html

In my case, I noticed thaht when building a geometry, you have to 
enforce the SRID in it, with EWKT for example. If you don't want to, you 
have to feed a -1 for the SRID in the geometry_columns.

If you do not do this (i.e. have a SRID in geometry_columns and nothing 
in the view), there is no error in postgis, but you have a problem in 
QGIS. I have experienced the same error:

Query: CLOSE qgisf0 returned 7 [ERROR:  current transaction is aborted,
commands ignored until end of transaction block
]

Hope it helps a bit,

Denis

Hi Andreas,

I have similar problems, but with Postgis 1.5.
I posted last week on qgis and postgis users:
http://old.nabble.com/MultiPoint-to-CircularString-to-LineString-td33132890.html

In my case, I noticed thaht when building a geometry, you have to enforce
the SRID in it, with EWKT for example. If you don't want to, you have to
feed a -1 for the SRID in the geometry_columns.

If you do not do this (i.e. have a SRID in geometry_columns and nothing in
the view), there is no error in postgis, but you have a problem in QGIS. I
have experienced the same error:



> Query: CLOSE qgisf0 returned 7 [ERROR:  current transaction is aborted,
> commands ignored until end of transaction block
> ]

Hope it helps a bit,

Denis

Hi Giuseppe, Hi J?rgen,

Thanks for the reply, everything is fine! So, thanks for the fix J?rgen!

Btw, is there a way of knowing the ID of a written feature?

As I want to modify it once it is written, I am doing a select to look for
my feature. When using the max+1 solution, it was ok, as I knew the ID. But,
now, I only know its geometry.

Would there be a way of giving back the provider ID to the feature given to
addFeatures?

Or is there any walk around this?

Thanks a lot!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS on android ALPHA3
Message-ID: <4F168C5E.5010308@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi all, last night i pushed a new "stablish" version of QGIS for 
android. I've closed some tickets [0] and thanks to an improvement in 
master (thx Jef), now the fontsize problem could be fixed as well (I 
tested it on an asus transformer and it looks great).
I fixed some widgets as well which are now not too big anymore and can 
now be closed. There still are some widgets that are too big (layer 
properties and raster calculator for example, but we are looking into it.

As well I worked a bit on the installation, now there should be no more 
first run crash. In this version I temporarly disabled the back button 
which used to crash the app if used. This is not ideal but at least 
avoids crashing your work when hitting that button. This is a necessitas 
(Qt on android) known problem and should get fixed in necessitas alpha4 
or beta1.

As usual you can find all happening around QGIS for android and the 
installer at [1]
I hope in your feed back and remember that any founding you might 
have/find will help a lot in getting all QGIS on android getting stable 
faster.

Ciao Marco

Message-ID: <CAGfc75m5-jBB=n54BAg4FJ_8HWa5j+Z7bgM5QcT=T7UkVTHFHw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,


Do you think this representation where transparency is retrieved from an
attribute value is efficient and interesting?
http://www.axismaps.com/blog/2008/11/a-new-kind-of-election-map/

There is also this one:
http://dsparks.wordpress.com/2011/10/24/isarithmic-maps-of-public-opinion-data/

I just wondered if someone had already thought of implementing this in QGIS?
For the moment, I only know R which is capable of such thinks.

Additionnally, would you think it would be interesting to give lines a
width from an attribute value?


Best,

Mathieu

Is the implementation of such a functionnality planned?

Don't you think it would be great to represent statistic values this way?

Yes, from my point of view I can confirm this

I just terminate the creation of new subproject in the hub (I was
wrong and I created a project instead a subproject of User Plugins so
something could be improved)

I try to summarize what I did until now for my plugin, could be useful
for other developers:
- on http://plugins.qgis.org the developer has to create a new plugin
repository (http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/add/)
- on http://hub.qgis.org the developer can create a new subproject (I
don't understand how) of qgis-user-plugins project and choose the
modules that he want activate.

That's all of my knowledge, I hope these are all the steps to do for
the new qgis infrastructure

I added a link from http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins to 
http://plugins.qgis.org/ - should be enough.
Further suggestions welcome.

Why not adding a link from http://qgis.org/ to http://plugins.qgis.org/ ?
Also, in http://plugins.qgis.org/ why not adding to:

* if you've found a bug in one of the plugins, learn how to submit a bug report

a link to:

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Bugreports ?

All the best.

Hi Strk,

Thanks for the notice about the possible parallel installations. I heard
about it but wasn't sure if it really works or creates problems.

Thanks for confirming that parallel installations of different Postgis
versions should work fine.

Correct, except for that you do not create a new *plugin repository*,
you just create a *plugin* in the repository.

I guess the source of confusion is that we refer to a *repository* in
two different cases:
1. repository of plugins - where the plugins are stored for
distribution (old at pyqgis.org, new at plugins.qgis.org)
2. source repository - where the plugin source code lives (svn/git)

Idea: maybe we could use a different term for the plugin repository
(meaning 1) ? Currently the popular online software repositories are
called Android Market, Nokia's Ovi Store, Apple's App Store, Chrome
Web Store and so on. Apparently a "store" is quite a good term, but
maybe some less frequently used terms would work too... depot / ware
house / emporium / haven ... or heaven? :)

Hi Mathieu,

Me personally, I don't find non-contiguous cartograms especially useful or
easy to interpret.
You can create the contiguous kind using cartogram plugin.

Another approach I've played with recently, is to use a simple regular grid
and "fill" the cells according to an attribute value.
An example of QGIS user distribution is available here:
http://underdark.wordpress.com/2011/12/27/mapping-qgis-users/

Regards,

Anita

Hi all.
One plugin:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/atlas
is listed as a project, whereas it should be a subproject of User plugins.
How can this be changed? And: can we avoid this for the future?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] rm EPSG:900913?
Message-ID: <4F16D8E0.2070705@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Can we remove the obsolete 900913 code, and replace it with 3857, both in core and in
the plugins?
See below for details.
All the best, and thanks to Luca Casagrande and Markus Neteler for pointing this out.
=====
http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/wiki/SphericalMercator
"SphericalMercator and EPSG aliases

The SphericalMercator projection in OpenLayers uses code epsg:900913. When
Google started to use the SphericalMercator projection, a corresponding EPSG
code did not yet exist, so a temporary code '900913' (notice the resemblance
to the word 'google') was invented. Many other services, such as OpenStreetMap,
Bing and Yahoo are now also using the same projection, but are not necessarily
supporting the use of code EPSG:900913. Other codes, such as EPSG:3857 and
EPSG:102113 were invented. Today, there is an officially registered EPSG code
3857 whose projection is identical to EPSG:900913.

As far as I know, logged users with no extra rights can only
create a new project. Then an admin fixes it like you just did.
Would it be possible to enable "normal" users to create Users Plugins
subprojects?

Why don't we keep it around for a while - although its not official it

Hi all,

I suspect there is a bug for the changeGeometryValues() as it should get  a
dict, similarly to the changeAttributeValues.

Btw, when I used changeAttributeValues({ id: {pos : attr} }), if attr was
not a QVariant, QGIS crashed (process ended) without giving any error
feedback.

I have pretty much no idea about c++, but I noticed a difference between
changeAttributeValues and changeGeometryValues: the first one being a const
and the other one not. I compiled QGIS after changing the
changeGeometryValues to const, but it changed nothing.... I also had a look
at the SIP files, but nothing came out to my eyes ;)

Hi,
Hi would vote to keep it for a while, but I dislike it (it's not an
official epsg code, and even the name is incorrect "Google Mercator" is
not a Mercator projection). As a compromise, could we add "(deprecated)"
or even "(deprecated, cf. 3857)" ? It would also be hidden when you
check "hide deprecated CRS".

Message-ID: <404F02D4-C656-4AB0-A7EA-8DB1128A08BD@gmail.com>

Dear all,

South Korea made major CRS changes in 2010 and those new CRS were registered to official EPSG code in June, 2010. Those codes are EPSG:5173 ~ 5188. You can see those CRS information at http://www.epsg-registry.org/ by filtering Korea. 

However we, Korean QGIS users who are mainly using QGIS 1.7.3, still couldn't find the new Korean CRS info in QGIS. 

Anybody know the reasons or anybody could help us to solve this issue?

With regards,

Sanghee

Hi,

See https://github.com/EcoGIS/CAPS-Scenario-Builder to download lots of well
commented python code.

See http://qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/index.html

This code works for me.  I'm using the 1.71API and my app is a desktop app
rather than a plugin.

feat = QgsFeature()
roundPointGeom = None
while provider.nextFeature(feat):
                point = feat.geometry().asPoint()
                roundPointGeom =
QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(round(point.x(), 2), round(point.y(), 2)))
                provider.changeGeometryValues({feat.id(): roundPointGeom})

and

elif vlayer.geometryType() == 1: # line
            while provider.nextFeature(feat):
                roundedLine = []
                line = feat.geometry().asPolyline()
                for point in line: 
                    roundedLine.append(QgsPoint(round(point.x(), 2),
round(point.y(), 2)))
                    provider.changeGeometryValues({feat.id():
QgsGeometry.fromPolyline(roundedLine)})

References: <4F15FF42.4030004@carto.net>

Meanwhile I tested with the same data on Postgis 1.5.3. Everything works
fine with Postgis 1.5.3

So apparently there are issues with Postgis 2.0. I followed Denis'
advice and deliberately set the SRID of the_geom in my view to "-1" with
SetSRID(the_geom,-1), voila, it works!

To me this sounds like a bug. QGIS somehow intersects (for picking and
selecting) an SRID of -1 with the layers SRID (in my case 21781) and
results in a mixed SRID error.

J?rgen or Strk - can you help with this issue?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi,

Thanks for your answer, but this is exactly what I am doing (see
https://github.com/3nids/Triangulation/blob/master/place_arc.py @ line 184,
commented)

I am using the development version, and as the postgis provider has
apparently recoded, I suspect there is something wrong.

If you look at the python error, changeGeometryValues cannot receive a
dictionnary, which is obviously incorrect.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Any way to change default colors for vector
	features?
Message-ID: <1326912067846-7201145.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hi All,

As mentioned in this forum before, I'm developing a PyQGIS desktop app.  I'm
using API 1.71 and the V2 renderer.
see(https://github.com/EcoGIS/CAPS-Scenario-Builder)

For a couple of reasons, my client doesn't like some of the colors that QGIS
uses by default when loading vector layers.  Is there any method to change
the list of default colors?

I see setColors() : QgsVectorColorBrewerColorRampV2 in the documentation. 
Any chance that the default colors are taken from this?

If not, I can do it by setting default colors in my app, but this requires a
bit of work to record layers that the user has set colors on, either in a
project file or in the current session.

Thanks,
Bob

Unknown srid became 0 in PostGIS-2.0.
The correct way to deal with unknown srids is to NOT specify them at all.

Check out the actual query being produced by qgis in the log window and
try it manually. Let us know.

Hi all,

Great work on log messages stuff in trunk.

But, are  we  sure  that  we want bright exclamation mark always visible in
main   QGIS  window confusing users (did something happen?) and eating
up  precious  space. Moreover this great tool is not really related to
everyday  work  with  QGIS  which  is  GIS? Too much exposure for such
button.

May be move it to help where link to API docs are?

Hi,

I turned on logging on the Postgres-Server and here is what I got:

--------------------------
LOG:  duration: 0.058 ms  statement: BEGIN READ ONLY
LOG:  duration: 1.164 ms  statement: DECLARE qgisf1 BINARY CURSOR FOR
SELECT
st_asbinary(st_force_2d("the_geom"),'NDR'),"gid","tid"::text,"plz"::text,"ort"::text
FROM "admin"."postkreise" WHERE "the_geom" &&
st_makeenvelope(695791,245010,696000,245220,0) AND
st_intersects("the_geom",st_makeenvelope(695791,245010,696000,245220,0))
AND st_srid("the_geom")=21781
ERROR:  Operation on mixed SRID geometries
STATEMENT:  FETCH FORWARD 2000 FROM qgisf1
ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of
transaction block
STATEMENT:  CLOSE qgisf1
LOG:  duration: 0.046 ms  statement: ROLLBACK
---------------------------------

so the error is easy to detect: st_makeenvelope() uses an SRID of 0 when
it should use 21781 which I specified when loading the view.

I hope this problem will be relatively easy to fix?

Thanks for having a look at it!

These changes are a good point of start, specially for user side, but
not enough for developer

Hi Marco,

just tested installation on Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, getting really cool!

Had a little hickup during first installation try, but second try 
revealed a really good looking QGIS on Android!!
Font and gui are really looking good now (only dialogs still have big 
fonts, and tht tickboxes in the legend become a little small on my screen?)
I could load wms and rasterlayers, but shapefiles and wmsc freeze/crash 
qgis (also creating shapes, something which was successfull in the 
earlier alpha). Will try to put the tablet in eclipse/adb and sent you 
log files if needed/

Thanks!

Richard

Hi J?rgen,

Thanks for the fix.
I tested it, and I have a small problem.

It is working perfectly if I give an initial feature id. The id is 
effectively given backed using
ok,feature = provider.addFeatures([f])

But, if I do not fill the ID field before insertion, ok is False, and of 
course no id in the feature.

Can it come from the type of primary key used in postgres? I use a 
serial. I try to understand your diff, and I wonder if I have to use 
OIDs to have this working as expected.

Thanks again.
Greetings,

Denis

PS: I realized I might have wrongly tested previous fix, and that it was not
working.
(I did not checked that the feature has been correctly written, only that
there was no error message. As I had to know the id I did not go further. I
am sorry about that.)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] font size in labelling fixed to QGIS menu font
Message-ID: <4F17D675.1040504@gmail.com>

Hi,

With the last version, apparently there is a problem with setting the 
font size in labelling.

If you click on the "..." to set font, size and style, the size is not 
taken into account.
If you change the size in the spin box, it is taken into account, but 
apply does nothing, and when reopening the dialog the font is again set 
to 10, which is my QGIS menu font size.

I changed the menu font size in QGIS options to 9, and the labelling 
font size went fixed to 9.

Greetings,
Denis

+1, deprecated note should be use. This is really useful for user.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] mismatch between mapCanvas size vs. mapRenderer
	size
Message-ID: <1326969209943-7203193.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hi

When exporting a map from canvas (through the composer) to a tif with a
world file I recognised a mismatch between mapCanvas size vs. mapRenderer
size (canvas is 2 to 4 pixels larger). But they have an indentical 
geographical extent.
The effect is, that with the tfw file (which I am writing out as described
here: 
http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/7fqJyR/mikeongis.wordpress.com/2011/08/25/map-design-with-qgis
http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/7fqJyR/mikeongis.wordpress.com/2011/08/25/map-design-with-qgis
), the tif is a little bit displaced with regards to the original map. (By
the way: the same happens in ArcGIS...)
Any ideas/suggestions how to export a tif and a precise tfw (or a geotif)?

Cheers
Stefan

Hi Stefan

the difference is that mapCanvas size counts also pixels used for
outer frames. mapRenderer size is the true map size (and it is the
same as mapCanvas.viewport() size).

Hi all,

I pushed my first plugin just now.
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/itembrowser
https://github.com/3nids/itembrowser

I have to say it is not a trivial task and might discourage people as it is
right now.
There are inconsistencies in the page http://plugins.qgis.org : 
-  the linked wiki
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Writing_Python_Plugins has moved
- As already stated, it tells you to register your plugin at
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins where you cannot create a
project

Also, when submitting the plugin, I needed to give a metadata file, which I
did not heard about. When I looked in PyQGIS cook book at writting plugins (
http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/plugins.html#writing-a-plugin ), the
info about metada is unclear and tells you to register the plugin at another
repo http://pyqgis.org/

The warnings when you upload the plugin are somehow discouraging also....

So the cookbook has to be fixed.

Can you please fill appropriate tickets suggesting better messages etc?

Thanks a lot for the effort. With your help, the process can be streamlined.

OK.

GRASS supports  only nearest neighbour.

It seems that sometimes it is slower reprojection and sometimes
resampling, depending on which resampling algorithm is used,
complexity of projection and if approx repro is used. We need some
benchmarks on this. Would it be possible to have an optional order of
projection and resampling and choose the faster one on runtime?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Some questions about re-use of
 QGSVectorLayerProperties method , 
 especially the symbology display and the save functionnality
Message-ID: <4F185A70.1030600@gmail.com>

Hi !

I have two questions for developers :

-> Is it possible to import the symbology color list ? I want to re-use 
the colour panel into my plugin panel, do you think it's possible ?

-> I search into the showLayerProperties() panel, and into the 
QGSVectorLayerProperties to find which object / method you use to you 
save and restore information about layer : symbology, joins, etc.
You didn't use the QSettings objects or other method to save information 
into layer, isn't it ?

I say that because we want to save selection(s) made by user in combobox 
(or other QT object) in our panel plugin, in order to restore them 
after, when the users re-click on a button.

Thanks a lot for your help,
best regards !

Hi Paolo, hi all

I am not understanding what you mean by fiiling appropriate tickets.
My point with these messages was: I did what I read I should do, and 
when I uploaded my plugin, I got error/warning messages...
These are too big and flashy regarding to their importance (homepage, 
tracker, repo, etc.)

Also having to set sub-project and plugins is weird, as you have to fill 
the info twice. I tried to look for the page where you set tracker, repo 
etc. and cannot find it anymore. It's not clear if it's possible or not 
to give the repo and that it is automatically included in the hub/projects.
Why not having only one of the two for the plugins?

I also think that having developers to validate plugins is a useless 
job. Because having number of downloads and users rating (via QGIS?) and 
comments is imho far the best way of evaluating a plugin. Second, I 
don't like very much the delay for the plugin to be available (although 
I am known to be very impatient ;) ....

Well, to finish I'll say I am a little sad regarding to the amount of 
work that has been done on these website for the plugins. All these 
stuff seems great on its own. But it does look like there used to be a 
lack of aggreement / concertation. (I noticed the discussion on the 
wiki). I would suggest to have a single page for howto publish a plugin 
(1) and a single gateway to browse plugins, instead of many (2) and 
without any link from qgis home page (!!!)

I see that the discussion in the wiki 
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/Python_Plugin_Repositories 
is going in that way and it's great. I know that this king of work is 
not very sexy for developers, but the gain for users and user-developers 
is huge!

(1) now:
http://plugins.qgis.org/
http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/plugins.html#releasing-the-plugin

(2) I could find these on the website:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects /sub-sprojects

> Hi Paolo, hi all

Hi Denis,

I'm the unlucky guy who spent a lot of time doing, undoing, redoing
the new Plugins website.

My frustration is at his top and I couldn't agree more with you, there
are a couple of issues here:

1 - specifications on py plugins are changing very often and there is
not a clear unique authoritative source of specifications for plugins,
or peharps I just couldn't find it
2 - there is no agreement on important topics, the main was if plugins
without a tracker and a public code repository and a public homepage
can be accepted on plugins.qgis.org
3 - there is not a single place for documentation
4 - I cannot do everything by myself, I'a a python-Django coder and I
try to keep updated the specifications for the application I write, I
I'm not going to do any CSS/styling work and I will not take care of
updating the CMS pages or other end-user documentatio, somebody else
has to do that
5 - the plugins website has nothing to do with Redmine instance
running on hub.qgis.org and there is no bridge between the two (except
for authentication)
6 - there is not an approval workflow for plugins: I'm not going to
approve any plugin anymore, somebody  else must do that

IMHO the main source of confusion comes from the lack of agreement on
the following topics

* all plugins *must* have a public issue (bug) tracker on  hub.qgis.org
* all plugins *must* have a SNV/GIT core repository on  hub.qgis.org
* all plugins *must* have a public homepage

after endless emails we agreed on

* all plugins should have a public issue tracker
* all plugins should should a SNV/GIT core repository
* all plugins should have a public homepage

this means that if the author doesn't supply those informations a
warning (not an error!) is issued by the plugins app. Only staff
members and authors see the warnings. The warning says:

"Some important informations are missing from the plugin metadata
(homepage, tracker or repository). Please consider creating a project
on hub.qgis.org and filling the missing metadata."

this is a suggestion, not an order, if the red color of the text
disturbs you, we can easily change, also, if you have some proposals
on a better message, please let us know.

As I wrote recently, I'm strongly against "forcing" authors to create
projects on Redmine, I myself will not do it for my plugins,
"suggesting" authors to do so, it's a good compromise: the idea is "if
you (author) dont' know where to host your code or your tracker, hub
is here to help you". If hub doesn't work as expected (and I'm pretty
sure it doesn't), please add  a comment to one of the tickets already
opened about the same sub-project issue.


The source of specifications for the plugins application which I
maintain is here:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/docs/introduction.rst

Also, at this time, metadata.txt is not (yet) mandatory your plugin
will be accepted even if there is only __init__.py

Very useful!
Permision rules 3 and 4 seem identical to me, are them ?

Is a warning and red-widget also shown for this case ?

Keep up the good work !

It would help either fixing them or omitting them from the testsuite.
Expecting failures doesn't help raising a warning when failures are seen.

In Gnash testsuite we added the ability to encode failure expectances.
That is, if you _know_ there is a bug you expect the failure and no red
flag is raised, while a flag is raised when the test passes, thus giving
you a kind of applause for fixing it :)

Hi Ale

I like very much the approach of the plugin Django application, so I
really hope that the QGIS developers community will stick with it.
A very nice add-on you could easily implement isre a comment system,
by using the django-threadedcomments.
I also recommend you to give a look to the  OpenComparison project
[1], the platform on which the DjangoPackages portal [2] (and other
ones) is based: there are very good ideas all around there, specially
the  integration with the APIs provided by PyPI, Github, BitBucket,
Launchpad, and SourceForge ;)

Thanks again for your excellent work!

Thanks Paolo,

there are already many new proposed features! Comments is certainly
one of those.
Plugin rating was also proposed and plugins app i18n support is also
very important.
rpc4django is already in place and a tighter integration between QGIS
client GUI and the web application would allow the user to rate a
plugin directly from QGIS interface.

Good to know that there are github apis available, but the official
choice is Redmine here... anyway I will give a closer look to that.

Not sure I understand exactly what you mean.

Is it to have resampling on layer (and color) level and additionaly 
resampling on provider (and raster band) level in the method 
QgsRasterDataProvider::readBlock? Then if otf-reprojection is on and 
raster type is not paletted, use the one inside the provider level, else 
the one on layer level?
This sounds like a good solution to me.

Regards,
Marco

IMHO they must have both a tracker and a repository, instead a
public homepage I think shouldn't be mandatory.

The main documentation source for creating/uploading a
python plugins is the pyQGis cookbook, of course it has to
be updated but remember that the new plugin repo is
available since few months only.

sites doesn't need a really strong integration IMHO, but
of course some kind of joining points between the two would
make life easier to plugin authors.

In this moment the new repo is available only from QGis master,
and also the plugins site is under testing.
If there isn't a workflow then it's time to define it.

IMOH all plugins *must* have a public tracker and repository.

Instead a public page should be strongly recommended.

I've seen that warning, but the link should point to a new project creation
(not the hub homepage) and the form should be populated yet (name,
description, set as subproject of "User plugins")

Hi Ale, hi all,
today I've shared a plugin (spatialite_manager) through the plugins
website following only the information I gradually found in pages
I visited.

Below there's the list of problems I found.

1. In http://plugins.qgis.org/ the displayed informations are not
consistent.

1.a. In section "How to add your plugin to this repository" I can
see:
- "register your plugin at http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-user-plugins,
to show plugin info, add issues/tickets and to have just ONE repository
for all qgis plugins."
Shouldn't it be this optional as the user can choose any tracker?

- about the sub-section "depending on your plugin/ideas/capabilities"
I'm not sure I understand what this means, so I think should be
re-written.

2. About the PyQGIS cookbook:
2.a. The section "Release a plugin" into the cookbook needs
to be update with the new procedure, It also contains a link to the
old plugins repo site.
2.b. There isn't a section about metadata.txt, what information
it contains, where put the file, ...

3. Back to plugins site,
3.a After I upload a new plugin that doesn't have a "metadata.txt"
file, the webapp displays too much warnings (about 5 or 6),
- the first warning says that the Tracker is missing in metadata,
- the second warning says that the Repository is missing in metadata,
- the third warning says that the Homepage is missing in metadata,
- a message says that the plugin was successful uploaded
- another warning about the missing metadata.txt file
- the last warning says me to consider creating a project on hub (but
the link sends to the hub homepage, not to the new project page and
of course it cannot populate any field in the create new project page).

4. In Hub (redmine instance), if I create a new project adding a tick
to repository, then setting up the repository is too much difficult:
4.a In the section "Permission Setup:"
- it says to upload an ssh public key, but without any explaination
on how to find or create the public key (GH has a very intuitive guide
here http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect/)
- It also says "Add yourself as a project developer: SpatiaLite Manager
Settings -> Members Tab -> New Member", even if who create a new
project already is a member, but he doesn't have developer permission.
4.b After I set the type of the repository there's no way to change it.

I think it's all. I'm going to file bugs for all the things I said.
Regards.

Hi all,

I also tried to upload my simple plugin to the new plugin repository
using only available information. Here is my experience.

Plugin code hosted at GitHub, I decide to use bugtracker at hub.qgis.org.
I have no problems with creating subproject under User plugins project,
only little puzzled with "Identifier" field.

Then I create package with my plugin and tried to upload it on plugins.qgis.org
and here I have one issue. My plugin have both files __init__.py and
metadata.txt. Metadata.txt file has all required fields including
links to source
code repository and bugtracker. But when I try to upload plugin I get message

"There were errors reading plugin package (please check also your plugin's
metadata). qgisMinimumVersion is set to less than 1.8 (1.0.0) and there were
errors reading metadata from the __init__.py file. This can lead to errors in
versions of QGIS less than 1.8, please either set the qgisMinimumVersion to
1.8 or specify the metadata also in the __init__.py file. Reported error was:
Cannot find metadata "qgisMinimumVersion" in metadata source (__init__.py).
Please bear in mind that the current implementation of the __init__.py validator
is based on regular expressions, check that your metadata functions directly
return metadata values as strings."

This is confusing for me, because my __init__.py contains

def qgisMinimumVersion():
  return "1.0.0"

and metadata.txt contains under general section

qgisMinimumVersion = 1.0.0

And I was able to upload plugin only when change qgisMinimumVersion in
both files to 1.8.0.

That's all. A little waiting and plugin approved and available for download.

I agreed with Giuseppe. As I remember in previous discussions we decide
that plugin author can use not only hub.qgis.org but any other bugtracker
and code repository. I under stand that using hub.qgis.org as bugtracker
has some advantages (single login and single place for all QGIS releated
bugs), but someone may don't like redmine.

I think we should create some policy regarding bugtracker and source code
repository. At least bugtracker and code repo URL should be mandatory.

Already fixed. But because auto updates for CookBook at qgis.org was
broken for a while we have outdated version on site. As I say this already
fixed, thanks to Otto and Werner.

Hello,

I planned a meeting with Vincent Picavet but unfortunatly I have no internet 
access from my home since a few days so this is difficult.
[break]
Ok the meeting just occured now :)

We create a wiki page (in French) for organization:
see http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Hackfest_qgis_2012

We have several location so we need to choose the best one.

We need alos to get preferred date from QGIS developpers. Do you agree to use 
doodle for this?

Regards,

Y.

Just playing around plugin web-app and have some additional
questions.

1. What message "This plugin has no public version yet." means
and how I can made plugin public?

2. When after approving plugin I want to update already uploaded
archieve I again see unchecked checkbox "Approved" that I can't
change. Maybe it is better to hide it from regular developers?

Thanks

Hi Radim

Ok, after some tests, I see that resampling and reprojection together do 
not perform too well. Also (comparing with UMN), there is a quality 
difference if doing the resampling after the otf-reprojection (without 
otf-reprojection, quality and performance are similar).

Fortunately, QgsRasterProjector is quite generic. So maybe it is 
possible to to use it directly in the raster renderer classes and do the 
resampling in source SRS.

Regards,
Marco

Hi!
As I did not see any Korean translation inside QGIS .. I only wanted to
ask if you like to start one? I would prepare the file for you .. 
If you are interested - just drop me an email ..

About the EPSG changes - well I am not sure but i think there is a
plugin which updates EPSG codes - Or we can try to put them into
1.7.4 .. with korean translation? ;)

kind regards

Sanghee,

I see that EPSG:5173 is supported by the GDAL 1.9 release.
I'm a bit vague on how the QGIS srs'es are managed but I
imagine the new CRSes can be added.  For EPSG:5173 I
get the following definition from gdalsrsinfo.  Does that
look reasonable to you?  Should there be a datum
definition for the Korean_Datum_1985 to WGS84 available?

PROJ.4 : '+proj=tmerc +lat_0=38 +lon_0=125.0028902777778 +k=1
+x_0=200000 +y_0=500000 +ellps=bessel +units=m +no_defs '

Hi Werner, 

2 members of our OSGeo Korean chapter translated all the menus & messages of QGIS into Korean at the end of last year. You can find those i18n files at the site. http://osgeo.kr/15 

I'm not sure why those 2 guys didn't put the Korean i18n files to the QGIS developers page. They might not know how to upload that Korean i18n files to the QGIS hub or they might be too busy these days. Anyway if you guide the step how to upload Korean i18n file to QGIS hub, that would be appreciated. 

And our local chapter have been translating QGIS manual into Korean nowadays. According to our plan, all the translations will be finished by the end of February. Our final Koran manual will be released in PDF format. Anyway I hope next QGIS could include Korean manual as well.

With regards, 

Sanghee

Dear Frank, 

Thank you for your posting. Since I noticed GDAL 1.9 included new CRSes of Korea, I raised this issues here in QGIS project. 

According to one of README[1] file in metacrs project, GDAL is almost the starting point of updating CRS info in other softwares. I noticed that CRSes of QGIS is managed as spatialite db(srs.db and qgis.db) and also found that those CRSes could be updated using a shell script called qgis_srs.sh [2] I don't think this shell script reflect the recent schema of srs.db. However I think I can update or add new Korean CRS to QGIS CRS db. 

Thank you.

With regards,

Sanghee

I've been quietly half paying attention to this thread...

I'd rather not promote the environment.plist (or other hidden/system init file options) as *the* solution to application environment variables.  Mac users shouldn't have to work with invisible files/folders to get something working.  And I don't think environment.plist is well documented (*users* need to dig into the *developer* documentation to find anything).

I also found a reference that PATH set in environment.plist changed in OS X 10.6 - instead of adding to the default system paths (/usr/bin, /usr/local/bin) it completely replaces PATH for any applications (they won't see system paths unless you specify them in environment.plist).

Either plugin developers (for plugins that use command line tools) need to add program path configuration options (see the GDAL Tools plugin), or some QGIS-wide option is needed like http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3097

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server Build Notes for Mac OS X
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR905Jy-v3Q=D03wjXzQTTC4L4xC1r4Fz1Xxj0JB3SoOsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

I have compiled QGIS and Server from the github 'master' branch on
Snow Leopard and Lion and have a couple of suggestions for the
step-by-step build instructions and noticed one possible bug. I have
also tested the Server successfully with the QGIS Web Client on both
OS.

Concerning the QGIS Server build (-D WITH_MAPSERVER=TRUE in section
5.5), the current notes state that fastcgi support has been dropped in
Lion and that adding that support is not recommended for the average
user. However, I think adding this support back in is straightforward
and not any harder than the rest of the build steps.

Here is my suggestion for the build steps to add Server build support
on Snow Leopard and Lion (not tested on older OS):

1) Download fastcgi library [1] and install (necessary for building
qgis_mapserv.fcgi):

cd <fastcgi-src-dir>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make && sudo make install

2) Download Apache's mod_fcgid [2] and install (not included with
Apache distribution by default):

cd <mod-fcgid-src-dir>
APXS=/usr/sbin/apxs ./configure.apxs
make && sudo make install

This automatically adds the 'LoadModule fcgid_module ...' line to
/etc/apache2/httpd.conf file. In Snow Leopard, commenting out the old
'LoadModule fastcgi_module' line is advised.

Both PostgreSQL server and mod_fcgid use the Mac's shared memory for
spawned processes. The default settings for shared memory are too low
to accommodate both programs; and trying to launch Apache now will
cause it to terminate when mod_fcgid can not allocate shared memory
that a running postgres process has already used up. The solution is
to up the values of these shared memory settings. A good explanation
of this is in the README included with PostgreSQL-for-Mac installer by
Enterprise DB [3].

3) Add the file /etc/sysctl.conf with the following contents (as per
PostgreSQL-for-Mac README):

kern.sysv.shmmax=1610612736
kern.sysv.shmall=393216
kern.sysv.shmmin=1
kern.sysv.shmmni=32
kern.sysv.shmseg=8

4) Add an Apache virtual host config to support the
~/Applications/QGIS.app build (default fcgid settings work for
testing/non-production server).

Add /etc/apache2/other/qgis-mapserver-fcgid.conf  (replace
/Users/<user> with where QGIS was built, unless built to
/Applications):

<IfModule fcgid_module>
  # on Mac install, not in logs/
  FcgidIPCDir /var/run/fcgidsock
  FcgidProcessTableFile /var/run/fcgid_shm
	
  # fcgid settings for qgis_mapserv.fcgi, initially set to defaults
  # see: http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html
  # add InitialEnv name[=value] 1 or more times to pass env variables
  FcgidCmdOptions
/Users/<user>/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/fcgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi
\
    ConnectTimeout 3 \
    IdleTimeout 300 \
    IOTimeout 40 \
    MaxProcesses 100 \
    MaxProcessLifeTime 3600 \
    MaxRequestsPerProcess 0 \
    MinProcesses 3
		
  AddHandler fcgid-script .fcgi

  Alias /fcgi-bin/ /Users/<user>/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/fcgi-bin/

  <Directory /Users/<user>/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/fcgi-bin/>
    AllowOverride None
    Options ExecCGI
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </Directory>

</IfModule>

5) Restart Mac for sysctl settings to take affect (though they can be
added dynamically with sysctl program). If not running, start Apache
via the Web Sharing control under System Preferences/Sharing. The log
/var/log/apache2/error_log should show something like:

Apache/2.2.20 (Unix) ...other modules... mod_fcgid/2.3.6 configured --
resuming normal operations

Apple's decision to drop support for fastcgi_module seems to be
appropriate as it is not being developed upon. While mod_fcgid is
currently a supplemental Apache-supported module, an investigation of
the Apache 2.3/4 documentation shows it is still not included by
default. Although, mod_proxy_fcgi [4] looks like it will be included
in the next distribution (same as current third party module? [5]).
Using an fcgi process spawner like fcgistarter [6], then using Apache
as a reverse proxy, appears to be a better, and more versatile
solution in the future. I actually prefer to use spawn_fcgi [7] and
Nginx as a reverse proxy on the Mac (via MacPorts) and on Ubuntu,
instead of Apache, for running my QGIS Server.

*Possible bug*
I was not able to get QGIS Server to GetMap with image/jpeg, only
image/png. It always returned a server error. I believe this may be a
bug in the source, or when building using Mr. Kyngesburye's
frameworks, as this also occurred in the last QGIS he distributed with
a built Server (1.7.0) [8]. Anyone else notice this?

Hi all,

I think that one of the last postgres updates brought a problem. Here is 
the error I have, in the log, in Postgis tab:
SQL: DECLAREqgisf9 BINARY CURSOR FOR SELECT 
asbinary(force_2d("wkb_geometry"),'NDR'),"id"[,etc.] FROM table WHERE 
"wkb_geometry" && setsrid('BOX3D(x y,x y)'::box3d,21781) AND 
srid("wkb_geometry")=

As you can see, there nothing specified for srid("wkb_geometry").

Good luck!

Denis

Which srids does the data in the table have?  What's the contents of
geometry_columns?  Can you provide debugging output?

Hi

Firstly, I probably should clarify my aim: I would like to export the map
Canvas into a high resolution tif with geographical information (either
geotif or tfw), in order to be able to translate this tif into a Garmin
Custom Map (which can be loaded on a compatible GPS unit). Therefore, I need
a high quality tif and tfw...

Thanks to Martins posting I could exlude that the difference between
mapCanvas and mapRenderer extent caused the offset in my tif with tfw
export. Now, I assume that the problem is, that the Composer map does not
fill the entire paper (although paper size is set according to mapRenderer
extent). It is cleanly aligned in the upper left, but does not reach the
lower right corner (a few lines with empty pixels occure on the bottom and
right border).

My approach is now to count the empty lines at the bottom / right border and
to exclude them from the image export. The following code gave quite good
results (at least they looked good), but is probably unnecessary complicated
and not 100% reliable (!?).

Are there better ways to export the mapCanvas into a high quality tif and
tfw?


target_dpi = 192

canvas = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()
mapRenderer = canvas.mapRenderer()
mapRect = mapRenderer.extent()
width = mapRenderer.width()
height = mapRenderer.height()

# set up composition
c = QgsComposition(mapRenderer)
c.setPlotStyle(QgsComposition.Print)

c.setPrintResolution(target_dpi)
c.setPaperSize(mapRenderer.width()/(mapRenderer.outputDpi()/25.4),
mapRenderer.height()/(mapRenderer.outputDpi()/25.4))

dpi = c.printResolution()
dpmm = dpi / 25.4

# add a map to the composition
x, y = 0, 0
w, h = c.paperWidth(), c.paperHeight()

width = int(round(dpmm * c.paperWidth()))
height = int(round(dpmm * c.paperHeight()))

composerMap = QgsComposerMap(c, x,y,w,h)
c.addItem(composerMap)

# create output image and initialize it
image = QImage(QSize(width, height), QImage.Format_ARGB32)
image.setDotsPerMeterX(dpmm * 1000)
image.setDotsPerMeterY(dpmm * 1000)
image.fill(0)

#render the composition
imagePainter = QPainter(image)
#imagePainter.setRenderHint(0x01)
sourceArea = QRectF(0, 0, c.paperWidth(), c.paperHeight())
targetArea = QRectF(0, 0, width, height)
c.render(imagePainter, targetArea, sourceArea)
imagePainter.end()

#Count empty lines at bottom and right border
lastPixelX = image.width() - 1
lastPixelY = image.height() - 1

xPixelValue = ''
yPixelValue = ''

while yPixelValue != '(0, 0, 0, 255)':
	lastPixelY = lastPixelY - 1
	yPixelValue =
str(QColor(image.pixel(int(image.width()/2),lastPixelY)).getRgb())


while xPixelValue != '(0, 0, 0, 255)':
	lastPixelX = lastPixelX - 1
	xPixelValue =
str(QColor(image.pixel(lastPixelX,int(image.height()/2))).getRgb())

#Make a copy of the image containing only the maps pixels
exportImage = image.copy(0, 0, lastPixelX, lastPixelY)	
exportImage.save("c:\\skript_test.tif", "tif")

#Export tfw-file
xScale = (mapRect.xMaximum() - mapRect.xMinimum()) / ((
(mapRenderer.width()) / mapRenderer.outputDpi()) * target_dpi)
yScale = (mapRect.yMaximum() - mapRect.yMinimum()) / ((

xDif=(( mapRenderer.width() / mapRenderer.outputDpi()) *

yDif=(( mapRenderer.height() / mapRenderer.outputDpi()) *

f = open("c:\\skript_test.tfw", 'w')
f.write(str(xScale) + '\n')
f.write(str(0) + '\n')
f.write(str(0) + '\n')

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Postgis provider, add and modify linestring
Message-ID: <4F1D6505.60709@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I observed a few changes I see as drawbacks.

1. When you draw a line, when you right-click to finish the feature, the 
current point is used. I think it is more consistent to place points 
with left-clicks and finish with a right, without adding anymore point.

2. Also, when I finish a feature, I have to commit changes and to 
refresh the canvas before I can see it on the map. If I am right, it did 
not used to be like this.

3. There is no add/remove node for a linestring. I am going to write 
this as a plugin. I this planned to be done? Did I look too quickly and 
this feature does exist?

Thanks a lot,

Denis

Can't you do that with the node tool?

Well, as far as I tried, you cannot remove a single node.

And to add one, double-click seems to add a node (there is a cross 
drawn),  but you cannot move it, and it is added in the wrong segment.

 I think that this behaviour is not new but was always like this. This 
 is also a general digitizing issue and has nothing to do with the 
 Postgis provider, as far as I know. Personally, I am not sure what is 
 easier/best to finish digitizing a line.

 I had a look at other graphic software:

 * Inkscape: finish line with double click or right click, but right 
 click does not add a new point. This seems to be in line with what you 
 propose above.
 * Autocad: finish a polyline with enter key
 * Openoffice: finish a line with a double click - right-click undoes 
 last vertex.
 * Scribus: finish line with right click, but right click does not add a 
 new point. In line with Denis' proposal.

 In general I think that QGIS current solution with finishing a line 
 with right-click (while adding a new vertex) is not so bad, once you are 
 used to it. It means fewer mouse-clicks, which is nice. It might be a 
 little unfamiliar for new QGIS users, but I think people can get used to 
 it quickly - am I wrong?

 One issue we have with right-click and with double click is that it is 
 hard to replicate on a touchpad. Marco Bernasocchi, the current QGIS on 
 Android maintainer has to find a workaround because there are no 
 right-clicks on a touchpad.

 Any idea about a better way to finish digitizing a line?

 That's strange - I cannot observe this behavior. It works fine on my 
 machine.

 yes - this functionality is missing - and I think it should go into the 
 core (not just as a plugin). The functionality to extend a line is a 
 core functionality that everyone needs at some point.

You need to use the "del" keyboard key.

 Denis,

 You can remove one or more nodes by selecting them - they become blue - 
 and then you hit the delete key.

 A double click adds a node.

 But there is no way to extend and already digitized line beyond the 
 end. This functionality needs to be added.

These are probably bugs. The node tool is intended to do exactly these 
things.

 for me, the node tool works fine.

 The only missing functionality is to extend a line beyond the end or 
 beginning. I am not sure if this can be handled by the node tool or 
 requires a separate tool?

Hi all,

Thanks a lot for you quick replies.

I'll try to resume.

1. Insertion of linestrings.
In my opinion, right-click to finish with adding new node is not great. 
I like consistency, and have left to add, right to finish is much more 
consistent. And one more right click is quicker than canceling the last 
added point ;) Andreas: in the example you shown, there is no one which 
used the same as qgis. But it might sounds like a bad idea to change a 
software behavior?

2. Have to commit to see the newly added features.
Yes this is really strange, it used to work, but since a few days (don't 
remenber when) I have to commit changes.n (see video)

3. Remove node.
Ok, got it, thanks.

4. Add node.
Cannot have it working. A node is added but in the previous segment. And 
I cannot move it. (see same video)

5. Having some experience with cad softwares, I must say I don't think 
it's a great idea to have a single action (or icon) for adding, 
deleting, moving nodes. It leads to a much more complex action. I.e., 
for adding a node: double clicking - selecting node - moving it without 
releasing button - release button instead of clicking - moving - clicking.
I'll see with the drawers, but I am pretty sure they would like single 
buttons.

See the video for point 2 and 4, here

 well - as I said. I do not have strong feelings about it. I am not an 
 operator, so I am not personally affected ;-) no - more seriously. Do 
 you really think it would be that hard for your people to use the 
 different behavior? At the beginning it will be strange - I agree - but 
 I have the feeling that people get used to it quickly.

 that sounds like a bug. I will try to replicate at later with the 
 current trunk. I did not see this behavior before.

 good

 to add a node you double click on a line segment and than you can move 
 it. Does this work?

 well - but on the other hand you don't have to change tools all the 
 time. I personally prefer the way QGIS does it because I can work with 
 fewer tools. The path-tool in Inkscape and in Illustrator is a good 
 example where one tool can actually handle all path shapes without 
 having to change the tool. This is a big plus in my opinion. One can use 
 keyboard modifiers and the different mouse buttons to change behavior of 
 the path tool ...

 But again - with touchpads - it is a different story ...

On master I'm getting a crash (using both shapes and postgis) when
adding nodes with the node tool (attached the error message). Should I
file a ticket?

I also see "strange things" when adding nodes: sometimes when adding a
node, the one added previously disappear and sometimes the node seems to
be added in a completely different spot than the onde clicked.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rule based labeling
Message-ID: <257da8de29d96c456f7f41111efe6f2c@carto.net>

 Hi,

 Are there any plans to support rule-based labeling (analog to the 
 rule-based renderer).

 What I would need:

 if rule A applies, I'll have these font settings
 if rule B applies, I'll have these font settings
 etc.

 Also, it would be nice to have different labels for different scale 
 ranges (e.g. different label text) for another scale range.

 How hard would it be to implement such rule-based labeling?

 Andreas

Hi all,

I've noticed that we have around 100 tickets in Redmine that have
status "Closed"
but "Resolution" field is not set. Is this correct or maybe we should add some
resolution for this tickets?

For me this is another question related to the redmine workflow.

That would be one possibility but I was thinking about resampling on
layer (renderer) level before reprojection, exactly like you described
in your next post bellow.

UMN MapServer is resampling before reprojection? The 'quality
difference' means that the result in QGIS with resampling after
reprojection is worse? How much?

That was my idea from my previous post. I thought that optional order
of reprojection and resampling could be the best for performance.

What about a more generic pipeline where various filters (resampling,
reprojection, color table application, OTF hill shader .... ) could be
used in an arbitrary order. The same API could be used for raster
processing. Or IOW, various raster processing filters would be used
for raster rendering on map canvas. What about filter plugins? Are
there the "QGIS Processing Framework" interfaces suitable for this
purpose?

For me, the current situation (node tool) is a major improvement over the old,
many-buttons one. Everything can be improved, but I would see having many buttons as
a regression.
All the best.

This (resampling before reprojection) is now implemented in the 
raster_resampler branch. You are right, it improves performance a lot.

>UMN MapServer is resampling before reprojection? The 'quality

I only tested visually with one dataset (raster background map, 
unfortunately not free data). So not really a representative test.
In my example, visual quality is similar, no matter if reprojection 
comes first or second. But there is a big difference in performance if 
reprojection is second.

That sounds very advanced, especially using it on-the-fly. But probably interesting for the remote sensing power users.

Hi Sanghee!

I look at the webpage but unfortunately I only found the .qm files
(which means this are the "compiled" translation files) .. For QGIS
source (and that means providing the translation to the source code) I
would need the .ts files. If these files are somewhere around please
send them to me or provide them somewhere to download and I will add the
files to the source..
Which Version of QGIS are these translations based on? Just to put them
into the correct branch ..
Once they are inside the source they can always be downloaded and worked
on .. 

Thanks for your help

kind regards
Werner

Sanghee,

I looked into the qgis_srs.sh script and I am please to see it
uses the GDAL epsg_tr.py script to produce the coordinate
systems.  You might be able to run it with GDAL 1.9.0 installed
and get the updates values.

Please don't forget to check into whether the Korean datum
is properly represented.  A mistake on this could cause many
problems and it is a common source of problems.

Best regards,

In another drawing programme I use a lot, it is irritating to me that amount of time I spend mucking about with the buttons - when I should be drawing.
The node tool might take a little getting used to, but now that I am, knowing it can be done like this, increases my existing frustration about having to continually stop drawing to change buttons.

Hi all,

1. Insertion of linestrings finishing by right click.
I am not very confident with current behavior. Would you agree on adding 
an option to ask if right click should also add a node or just finish 
the operation ?

2. Have to commit to see the newly added features.
I am using a view, and updating corresponding table with a rule. Jurgen, 
do you have any idea about it? Would it be possible?

4. Add node.
Jurgen fixed it yesterday, thanks a lot.

5. Single vs. several tools.
You almost changed my mind. Ok, you changed it ;)

Thanks a lot for comments, helps, tips and fixes!

 sounds like an idea - could go into the digitizing options. Maybe you 
 can ask Marco to implement this. Then people can fight about what should 
 be the default ;-) I can understand that the current behavior that 
 right-click adds an additional node can confuse newcomers.

 that really should work. Sounds like a bug to me.

My only concern with this is it will then be inconstant across users e.g
makes it hard to write training manuals when you have to say "you can do it
this way, or if someone has changed it you can do it this way", it might
not be so bad for something like this but I think we should decided on
somethings and just stick to them.  Giving users heaps of options to tweak
can sometimes make a system harder to use, sometimes the less options the
better.

IMO the way it works currently is good however if we were to ever add right
click context menus to the drawing tools (like Arc or CAD based systems)
then I think this behavior might not be ideal.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rule-based renderer updates
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFdpJ-FMB8VikDJ-y6YNpn8s514ussWPbxhKNomRDa3_zQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have just merged improved rule-based renderer to master branch.
There are various changes in both backend and GUI:

* Rules now form a hierarchical structure: any rule can contain
further "child" rules. When rendering, child rules are applied only
when their parent rule matches. This allows users to build a logical
trees of rules instead of keeping all rules in a flat list with
complex filters.

* The options "use only first rule" and "use symbol levels" have been
removed: now all the matching rules and applied and at the same time
the rendering order is given by the symbol levels.

* GUI: rules are shown as a tree. They can be organized easily with
drag and drop (multiple selection is supported, too). Let me emphasize
again that the tree of rules does not say anything about the rendering
order (because in SLD and Mapnik the order of rules matters). The
rendering order can be set by the button in bottom-right corner of the
renderer widget - it triggers the same dialog as used for setting
symbol levels.

* GUI: inline editing of labels, filters and scale range is now
possible - use F2 -or- click again a selected item to enter inline
editing.

* Rules may not contain a symbol: usually parent rules are not
assigned a symbol because their child rules take care of rendering.

* symbol levels dialog for other renderers is now accessible from a
menu from their "advanced" button - to avoid some clutter,
additionally renderers indicate whether they support symbol levels or
not.

Originally I wanted to design the rule-based renderer to follow SLD /
Mapnik logic - the order of rules (and group of rules) determines the
rendering order. However this is not very user friendly: the user has
to prepare the rules in a way that is convenient to a software, not
the user. For example, when drawing a map of roads with nicely
rendered road outlines and varying Z-levels (bridges / tunnels), the
user has to split the road symbols into multiple rules and move them
away from each other - further editing of rules and symbols becomes
complex. In our approach the user can keep the rules in a hierarchy
that is most convenient and then define the rendering order
independently. So there is not a 1:1 relation between QGIS rule-based
rendering and SLD (or Mapnik) rules, however the import/export
capabilities can be implemented without problems.

Please test, I would like to hear your comments, suggestions and bug
reports. I am especially interested to hear any notes related to
usability - I have some doubts regarding GUI, e.g.:
- expand all rules when GUI is opened?
- delete parent rule's symbol when refining it? or completely forbid
rules to contain a symbol if they have children?

There are still some smaller things that might be added in future:
- cloning of rules
- filtering of rules in GUI - by label / filter expression / scale
- "else" rule - will be used only if no other sibling rule matches
- checkable rules?
- better item delegates for inline editing - e.g. filter editor with
"..." button to open query builder

Finally, I would like to thank Ville de Morges, Switzerland for
sponsoring this work.

a few packages were not updated yet, rpy2 is among them. Without this

"Unable to load manageR: Unable to load required package rpy2.

Hi Martin,

Just a quick answer to thank you warmly for these improvements. I am
working on OpenStreetMap data to print maps, and I think these changes will
help me a lot.
I have to compile master branch to test it, but will try to do it quickly,
and then I would be able to report.

About your last questions, here are my first answers :
- cloning of rules

Very good idea,  It will help a lot

- filtering of rules in GUI - by label / filter expression / scale

not a priority for me, since the tree should improve user experience. And
you would have to dynamically change the tree, which could lead to weird
behaviours ? Such as showing only some child nodes

- "else" rule - will be used only if no other sibling rule matches

no comment here, since I do not use it often

- checkable rules?

This would be very helpfull to dynamically test the rules

- better item delegates for inline editing - e.g. filter editor with
"..." button to open query builder

no comment either

Another thing I find hard to play with in the current 1.7 versions is the
need to click again and again to change rule priority : click the rule,
then click the array (increase or decrease), then reclick the rule (which
location has changed), then reclick "increase", etc. I think.
This is why I think the drag and drop (and multi-selection) you implemented
would be very handy !

Thanks again

Michael

No. That's not the normal behaviour.  How can I reproduce that?  The provider
shouldn't matter as the new features aren't stored there, but in memory until
you commit.

Just to be sure: We are talking about core qgis and not some plugin, are we?

All?  There's also python-rpy - which is in osgeo4w.  Not sure what the
difference is - and why both exists.

Hi J?rgen,

Yes, we speak about QGIS core.

I tested with others layers that are straight tables and I do not have 
this behavior.
I only have this in a view.

You can see this in the video I posted: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4IsQ2R_9Ag&hd=1

You probably do not need this, but the SQL of the table and view is here 
https://github.com/3nids/qWat/blob/master/sql/pipes.sql
Basically, I have a table and a view with insert/update/delete rules, 
including the geometry field.

For info, I use: postgis 1.5.3 and postgres 9.1

Don't know where to look at anymore (already upgrade the packages).

Hi

I really appreciate the log window - thanks Juergen - it is something
we have been missing for a while. It is a great place to put some
notifications and/or warnings that would otherwise disturb the user.
Regarding the exclamation mark - I would prefer not to have the icon
in status bar all the time. Maybe a good solution would be to
show/hide the log from a menu (by default). Just in case a new warning
(not just a notification) is issued, the exclamation mark would show
up to signal that something went wrong. After opening the log the
exclamation icon would be hidden again.

Hi Andreas

Nathan has outlined two possibilities here:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/RuleBasedLabelingIdeas

Both have some pros and cons, both are doable. The scenario when
labeling rules are independent from layer symbology is probably more
straightforward to implement and easier to use with only few rules for
labels. On the other hand, if labels were attached to symbols, the
fine-grained labeling settings would not require duplicate rules for
symbology and labeling.

 Hi Martin,

 Thanks for the pointer.

 In my experience, the labeling is often (most of the time) disconnected 
 from other symbolization rules. Generally I need fewer rules for 
 labeling as I am using for the general symbolization.

 So in my opinion the two should not be linked together.

 Andreas

I believe that any python plugin/tool that works on top of R need rpy or
rpy2

If I'm not wrong rpy is an old version of rpy2, probably still in
osgeo4w for backward compatibility with some tool that still uses it.

rpy2 is a complete rewrite of rpy, I'm not sure they are compatible (I
don't think they are). I can check on the rpy2 list about the status of
python 2.7 builds for windows(fairly sure it works on linux). There's
also that whole issue about which version of R they work with which was
also stuck to R 2.11 I think I heard.

Thanks,
Alex

Giovanni,

Can you try either:
1. easy_install rpy2 from the osgeo4w shell
or
2. download the tar.gz from the rpy2 site and do a python setup.py
install in the osgeo4w shell

That might be all that needs to happen, and then the upload to osgeo4w
just might be a subfolder of python site-packages wrapped in a tar.gz
(someone more familiar with osgeo4w packaging should anwser this part.)
I don't see any reason it won't work on python 2.7.

Thanks,
Alex

For now just click the up one level directory until you get to the root,

Hi,

I observed this several times in the past.

In the tree view of the Postgis-Provider (the tree listing the schemas
and tables) it is sometimes hard to open the drop-down box with the
primary key choice.

It got worse when I increased the font-size in KDE because my screen has
a rather high-resolution.

Any other people experiencing problems with picking the pkey column as
well in this dialogue?

to be more precise: I am on ubuntu 11.04 - KDE.

With my current setup I cannot open the combobox for selecting the the
"Primary Key Column" at all. This means that I cannot open a view where
I have to select the pkey columnn.

I will try going into Gnome to see if it improves.

Not here - neither on XFCE nor on Windows.  BTW you can change the font size
within QGIS now - maybe that helps.

hm - it is all very strange. I wonder if something went wrong with my
recent Ubuntu updates.

Currently, in the Postgis selection dialogue if I try to open the
drop-down box for selecting the pkey column, always the whole line in
the tree gets selected (blue) and the drop-down box will never open ...

---------

On the other issue with the font size: very nice! Suddenly QGIS gets
usable on my Android phone! great!

The only thing I noticed that while some menus/dialogues get the
font-sizes adapted, but some stay at the previous very large fonts.

E.g. Main Menu --> View looks nice, but the sub-menu --> "Panels" still
has the ugly too-large fonts. Could it be that some sub-menus do not get
the updated fonts? Similar, in some dialogues (or parts of dialogues)
the font-settings do not get fully applied!

Anyway - it is great to see progress!

Hi,

Could someone more knowledgeable of the inner C workings of QGIS let
me know if the warnings I see in my cmake building of QGIS 'master'
branch are of concern or can be ignored? It does compile and seems to
run fine under Snow Leopard (10.6.8) and Lion (10.7.2).

Cmake output from build on Snow Leopard:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4058089/qgis/Terminal_Output.pdf

I would like to automate nightly QGIS master builds from github and
don't want to miss something in the build process.

Dear Werner, 

Oops!!

I pointed wrong link. You can download Korean .ts files here : http://www.osgeo.kr/16

According to translators, they made translations based on QGIS 1.7.0. version.

Hi Larry

Thanks for the detailed description. Hopefully it can be added to the 
documentation.

Requesting images as jpeg from QGIS server works for me on my Linux box. 
Maybe it is something related to the libraries used E.g. a Qt without 
jpeg support?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] my first python plugin for qgis
Message-ID: <1327481971345-4337466.post@n6.nabble.com>

Dear all

I am not sure if this is the right place to post this...

Recently, I wrote my first Python-Plugin for QGIS ("GarminCustomMap").
It was uploaded to http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins.
After uploading I got the message, that the plugin has not been approved
yet. Is there anything I should do?
Furthermore I am not sure what I should do with regards to a

Yes, I also noticed this.
I think it is better to add a resolution, for consistency.
Al the best.

Hi Stefan,

Yes, the situation is a little bit tricky right now.

Creating a project on the hub (i.e. redmine) is not mandatory. But it 
can be used to host the code repository (as github does) and the 
issue/bug tracker.
Login and create one here if you want: http://hub.qgis.org/projects
You will not be able to place it in the plugin project, it should be 
moved by an admin later.

For the validation, I understand your frustration. I uploaded an update 
24h ago, and it is not released yet.
For all, do you really think that this validation is useful? Maybe for 
first upload, but then remove it?

Cheers,

Denis

@SBL your plugin is now approved.  There used to be only a handful of
people that could approve however I, and a few others, have been added to
the list to help the task of approving plugins.

@Denis Bear with us.  Currently there is only one guy working on the plugin
stuff so he is a little stretched at the moment.  A few of us are going to
lead a hand where we can in order to help smooth out the process.

For validation yes I think it is useful, but I agree that it should be a
once off.  Currently if a user is set as trusted then they can upload more
with auto approve switched on. I'm not sure how many people doing the
approving knew this.  I'm going to start going though and adding users as
trusted as I see it is needed

What was your plugin called?

Hope this helps

- Nathan

Hi Nathan,

Don't worry, I know people cannot be working full-time on qgis while 
being unpayed!

My plugin is Item browser, but is now approved, thanks a lot!

Yes, this is exactly how it should work: once a new plugin author is
known not to be an evil bad guy he gets flagged as "trusted" (every
staff member can flag another user as trusted from the front-end).

Being a "trusted" user means to have "plugins.can_approve" permissions
(i.e. having all versions automatically approved on upload).

All this things have been discussed and agreed on this list (a few
months ago) and are documented here:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/docs/introduction.rst

What we really need now is somebody to help with documenting this
stuff in a more user-friendly way and improve/maintain the HTML pages
on plugins.qgis.org , also text of the warning or error messages can
be improved, a mothertongue english speaker could lend a hand on this
topic.

Hi Alessandro,

As already said, I can give a hand on this.
But it is not clear where to start, and we need to discuss a little bit 
more maybe.

Hi,

With latest master, I tried to load a non geometric table from a

All the non geometric tables are correctly listed, but in grey and are 
not selectable.

With last master, and probably since alex's last update for tool pan map

Message-ID: <4F1FD69A.7040101@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Thanks to the recent upgrade of Python on osgeo4w, now it should be doable to use
saga from within qgis, thanks to the Analytical Framework plugin.
Unfortunately, import saga_gui works from a py shell, but not within qgis.
Could someone who owns a windows licence look into this?
Ultimately, I think it would be very convenient for users (and useful for the
diffusion of saga) to add it to the osgeo4w distribution. Does the saga team have any
interest on this?
All the best.

I confirm, on Ubuntu 11.04, Qgis master 138d4a2.
In this moment there's no way to add a no-geometry table in QGis.

Denis,

Do you mean the selection is not shown?

Can't confirm that here, running latest build (2min ago).

Hi!

Found it and put it into release-1_7 branch and master branch .. so
from now on the translation should be included into main QGIS releases
..

If there are any updates - just send the files to me or create a
github account and do pull requests there ..

thanks a lot
Werner

Well....that was hard, but I think I found where the (my?) problems come 
from!!!
I re-add the same layer which was posing problems with selection color 
and newly feature visibility, and redo all steps.

As soon as I switch a layer to rule-based style, the selection is 
uncolored and newly created item is not displayed until commit.

I tested this with two layers (one view of linestrings, and one table of 
polygons)....

Please...confirm I am not alone ;)

Are the rules based on attribute that get their final value on commit (and have

yes - after your fix it works again.

Sorry about the wrong lead about the font-size, which has nothing to do
with it. And sorry about the statement that it is sometimes hard to pick
whereas in a recent version it was impossible in all cases.

Now it works ok again.

Thanks - J?rgen!

Hi J?rgen,

Thanks. I can select the line but cannot add the table: it says "select 
a table etc.". I cannot select a primary key either.

Now both selections and vertex markers should show correctly as before.

Hi all.
How about simplifying the syntax of raster calc? If even Tim can get wrong:
http://linfiniti.com/2012/01/simple-binary-raster-reclassification-in-qgis/
this means that the average user will be in trouble.
Am I wrong?
Of course, using the expression widget now used for field calc and for labelling
would probably solve the issue.
All the best.

It is really tempting to move forward from being pure c++ application
to a hybrid of c++ and python code - and I am not talking about python
plugins shipped by default with qgis - I mean that python would be a
required dependency since some parts of the GUI would be in python. I
tend to be in favor of that (to some degree).

There are some advantages (many python developers, lots of working
python code in plugins) and some disadvantages (code maintenance). At
the same time we should have a vision what should and what should not
go into qgis app - not many plugins are really for general purpose,
with good gui+code quality and without further dependencies.

It would be interesting to see what other devs think about opening
qgis to python code.

The default colors that QGIS sets to layers are random colors - no
table of default colors is used. If you have a good idea how to
randomly create "nicer" colors, we would like to hear that. This is
how the color are currently chosen:
- in old symbology: all three values (red, green, blue) are rand(0,255)
- in new symbology: the color is constructed from hue (range 0-359),
saturation and value (both range 0-255) with uniform sampling: H =
rand(0,359), S = 64 + rand(0,191), V = 128 + rand(0,127)
where rand(a,b) means a random sample from uniform distribution on
interval [a,b]

It is just a matter of experimenting a bit to find a good range within
the color space that produces better colors.

No, that is not related.

Qt allows you to create proxy models that filter out some of your
items - no need to do some complex logic to modify the tree of rules.
For complex styling it might be interesting to see only rules that are
active in a particular scale or which rules use a particular field.

Btw. Richard has provided a patch in a pull request for that, it might
be possible to backport it to 1.7 and 1.8

Hey Paolo,

I stated working on adding the expression builder widget last night, didn't
get very far as I had to do some other things.

One question, how needed is the Min X, Max Y etc stuff.  Currently it takes
up a lot of room and clutters (IMO) the interface.  I was thinking we might
be able to hide it in an advanced section if it is only used rarely.

Hi all,

I just wonder what (not when ;) ) will be available in 1.8.
Do all the features available in current master can be expected for 1.8, 
or some of them are for 2.0 or even later?

Hi Denis!

To my knowledge not all features will be available in 1.8 - only those
which are not breaking the API .. For that 1.8 got branched right before
the first API breakage.

Probably I am not 100% right with this but I hope it will give you a
direction what to expect ..

kind regards
Werner

Hi

I also think that it is not necessary to port the atlas plugin to C++.

>It would be interesting to see what other devs think about opening
>qgis to python code.

-1

I like the clear distinction between C++ and Python parts as it is now. For me, it is still very important to have the possibility to build QGIS without Python if necessary (e.g. doing a quick test with a Windows or Mac build of a branch).

Regards,
Marco

-1 to mixing Python and C++ to me.  If we only targeted one platform with
one version of Python I would be a +1 but the amount of emails we get about
Python not working, conflicts with Python version, conflicts of Python
plugin libs etc, would lower the user experience not increase it.

There is also the issue of API binding.

I would love to see the composer improved to handle map book making as a
core built in function, however I am happy for it to stay as a plugin at
the moment because it will be easy to work out and fix all the logic bugs,
has a larger spread of users, and quicker to develop and distribute.

IMO, you could move those element into an advanced section. It is 
important to have the possibility to set the output resolution, but not 
a setting you need fast access to.

One way of hiding some of the syntactic complexity might be to use one
of the visual workflow systems like Orange http://orange.biolab.si/ to
construct raster operations, especially if it somehow tied in with the
SAGA/Grass/etc. workflow stuff that's being developed. True, this is
not an insignificant amount of work, but if all it did was generate
valid rastercalc expressions, then it can sit on top of the current
system rather than replace it.

Alternatively, how about categorising operators like the expression
builder in a spreadsheet?

Something else that might be useful is a preview window for the raster
calculator. I got bitten by a similar issue to Tim, where I wanted to
invert the values in my raster. I used:
-myraster@1
Which is a valid expression, but returned 0 for all values. Instead I
had to use:
-(myraster@1)

This wasted 20 minutes on my very large dataset. In hindsight I should
have done in the first place what I did in the end, and tested it with
a subset of my big raster, but a small thumbnail like some of the Gimp
plug-ins have would have saved me some time.

Have you seen the expression builder used for labeling?
http://woostuff.wordpress.com/2011/10/27/expression-based-labeling/

The goal is to replace the current calculator with something that.

Something else that might be useful is a preview window for the raster


This would be a cool idea.

I updated QGIS-dev this morning. When I open a composer it is not
showing as a separate window in Windows on the taskbar. When I minimise
a composer window it minimises within the QGIS main window.

Is this intentional or a bug? 

Also the icons on the composer toolbars ignored the icon size of the
main QGIS window.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] knock knock - 1.7.4 is outside
Message-ID: <1327585347.2521.15.camel@lost>

Hi to all Users, Devs, Translators and Community!

As of today we have exactly 56 more or less important Bugfixes and
Improvements backported to the release-1_7 branch ..

It's been now more than two month since we released 1.7.3 and I think
it's time to give 1.7.4 a chance ..

And here is the place where you all jump in :)

We try our best to clean out the bugs but as you all know software is
never free of bugs - but we can try to bring it as close to a bugfree
state as possible..

My Question to all of you now is:

Anyone of you who is familiar with git and can compile software by
himself. Could you please checkout the "release-1_7" branch, compile it
and test it with your biggest, strangest and difficult data you have to
find out if there are still bugs inside.
I am not looking for new feature reports or GUI things .. I just want
everything to work as expected.

Probably packagers could provide some "Release Candidate" Packages.
My Timeplan for now is to release 1.7.4 before beginning of March.
But definitely as soon as possible :)

Please help to make 1.7.4 another great release in the 1.7 series .. 

If you find a Bug just search on the bugtracker if it already exists -
if not report it and set the Target Version to 1.7.4.

This would also be a good opportunity for translators to look in the
release-1_7 branch and finish translating there ..

I know many of you are already using master because of the shiny new
features inside and because you are able to compile it by yourself (and
these are exactly the persons i am directing this mail to - but please
let us not forget all the people outside there who rely on a stable qgis
1.7 branch with a lot of fixes.

Thanks a lot for your help and for this great community!

kind regards
Werner

IMHO we should not release the 1.7.4 version before having squashed all the real
blockers. This implies revising all the Immediate and Urgent tickets, and either
solve them (if they are really blockers) or downgrade them (if they are not).
Concerning the translations: would it be ok to translate the master, and backport the
translations?
All the best, and thanks Werner for leading the effort.

Hi Paolo!
As I am not a cpp guru (and as i already wrote) I do not have testdata
to look at some of these bugs I heavily rely on 1. people reporting bugs
and 2. developers solving it..
So the "either" point of your mail is one thing I cannot do - and to be
honest I dont know what you mean with "downgrade them" ..

Concerning the translations:
If you are backporting the translations to the file in release-1_7 it is
ok for me .. As I do not speak italian (and obviously not 38 other
languages) I cannot take a look if the right phrase is correctly placed
in the right place.
Of course we can always backport the translations from master to release
but as strings change (with every GUI Change - and I think we recently
had a lot in master) there is no guarantee that everything is correct in
release branch .. 
So I would prefer to take a short look over the file in release
branch .. see whats missing and probably backport the phrase if it
already exists in master .. If there is an automated way to do that on
every language I am more than willing to take a look at it if you know
one..

As there are already 56 improvements over 1.7.3 I would say it is time
to look for a new release .. I hope that every immediate and urgent bug
will be cleaned .. someone just has to point at the correct commit in
master and Alex and me will try to backport it (if it is possible).

So let's look for the reaction on the "call for testing" ;)

kind regards
Werner

I mean to check all the 13 very serious bugs, and see if they are so serious to block
the release or if their rank can be lowered. As a general principle, I think we
should not release a version with known blockers.
All the best.

I agree on the general principle, but given that we just started
maintaining a stable branch we'll surely have more "blockers" than
resources to fix them. So in addition to "downgrade" their seriousness
I'd add the possibility to retarget them to 1.7.5.

Better a 1.7.4 with a bunch of bugfixes since 1.7.3 than no 1.7.4 at all.
I'm sure 1.7.4 won't be the last in the 1.7 branch, nor willing for it to
be (I like a stable qgis even if I can build from sources ... :)

Sure, but only if there are no bigger bugs, introduced after 1.7.3.

Hi!
Thats what I like to find out with my "Call for testing" ..
I think if the branch gets well tested on different data we'll see if
there are more bugs inside than in 1.7.3 :) .. At least I think 1.7.4
will be better than 1.7.3 allthough it is obvious that not everything
can be fixed ..
I agree with you that all showstoppers should be fixed - but as I can
see some showstoppers are not fixed in master also .. so howto backport
non existing fixes?
Better release it with a "known problems" somewhere in the wiki - as we
already discussed some time ago ..

kind regards
Werner

I'm available to "lead" a small team of testers in order to check for
regressions and (new) critical bugs (causing crashes or data corruption)
before releasing. Strictly from a user point of view.

Thanks a lot for your help Giovanni!!
As I told you already I think I do not have enough critical data to
really test all user cases - so a small team would be fine..
I'll wait for your feedback .. try to solve all reported problems - and
afterwards do a release ..
Please keep in mind that we do not backport new features .. some
reported bugs are solved by introducing new features .. 
Thats what 1.8 will be for .. 

So thanks again a lot .. Let's try to catch all possible bugs ..

kind regards
Werner

I restored the old behaviour in e39e7665.

Hi all.
Why not adding a default template, as it was long ago with the quickprint plugin?
I think the blank page is intimidating for newbies, and it is quite convenient to
have something simple to start with.
Opinions?
All the best.

Martin I have been doing quite a bit of QGIS python programming the
last few weeks and I must say, it's is a really awesome development
environment and I could see a lot of merit in replacing what we have
in app with pure python and then using C++ for core, analysis and gui
libs. I can see that on new platforms (e.g. android mobile) new
interfaces are going to be needed and in my opinion it isn't something
we should discount over the long term. However the massive work
involved in doing that is probably a show stopper. Just mixing in
python functionality in the way of gdaltools and ftools seems to me a
viable way to continue for the medium term. What exactly would you
vision of a more python centric QGIS amount to?

Right now I can't give an immediate release date - I am busy working
on a new release management system to make the whole process much
smoother and Werner is busy preparing 1.7.4 so it will still be a
little while before 1.8 comes to light I think.

Hi Larry

(With apologies for top posting). These are great notes - if you can
provide me with a patch / pull request against

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/doc/osx.t2t

I would be happy to include your notes into the mainstream docs for
others to enjoy.

Hi Tim,

thanks for your reply.

I see you're busy ;) my question was more about what than when ;)
I plan to have 4 drawers working on production with QGIS during the 
spring, and I just wonder what features I could expect for the next 
releases.

Cheers,

Denis

Hi all.
I have a dtm, format adf, ranging from -3 to 2012. If I move the sliders (a very slow
operation), I do not get the transparent areas I intended.
On another one (tiff, 0 to 662), everything ok.
Anyone confirms?
Thanks.

OK. I'll fork and edit the osx.t2t file on github. I have several
other notes to add for your review.

No apology needed for the 'top posting' since I didn't know what it
meant! Learn something new every day. I hadn't spent much time on
Usenet, so wasn't familiar with that etiquette.

Thanks. I'll try to match the good quality of the existing documentation.


I gather you are an occasional Mac user. If so,can you confirm the
issue I am having with QGIS Server not returning output for GetMap
requests in the image/jpg format? PNG output works fine for me. I'm
using QT 4.7.4 (non-SDK) and PyQT 4.9 on Snow Leopard. Same issue
regardless of QGIS branch built.


I also knocked together a nightly build script for local automated app
builds of the master branch[1]. (Note, I'm not gifted at writing shell
scripts.) Do you think there would be any interest in uploading those
builds to a public space for other Mac users/potential devs? I can
automate the builds and uploading, like to my Ubuntu server or S3
bucket. The builds work, though they are not as tested or as
feature-packed as Mr. Kyngesburye's offerings (no gpsbabel, etc.). I'm
trying my hand at designing an extensive Export to WebClient python
plugin and always want to locally be working with the latest master
branch.

Hi,

Sorry the post didn't help.  I didn't read all your posts and replies, so I
was just shooting in the dark, hoping the code I posted would help.

For the record, I changed the API I was using from 1.6.0 to 1.7.1, and took
a lot of work to make my app behave as it did in 1.6.0.  I'm not surprised
that you are having trouble with the master version.  Maybe you want to
stick with an earlier release?

Good luck with your project,
Bob

Hi Martin,

Thanks so much for taking the time to reply. 

I'm thinking I will just pick a group of colors that have a large "contrast"
with one another.  Graphics art is not my thing, but I think there might be
some kind of formula for picking maximum "contrast," or whatever the term
is, between any given number of colors.  I'll check that out when I get to
picking a group of colors for my app.  I'll let you know if I come up with
anything.

Thanks again for your reply!
Bob

I have just successfully built release-1_7 on my Mac (latest Snow
Leopard with kyngchaos.com frameworks). I have some extra time and a
bunch of work to do on a current map project which can be used to test
the build. I'm willing to test for bugs and file reports, though I am
not a C programmer.

Note: the bug I was seeing in 'master,' where image/jpeg GetMap
requests to QGIS Server were failing, does not happen under this
branch. So, Server seems to work OK on Mac so far.

I also have a QGIS test environment on Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit Desktop,
under Parallels on my Mac.

Thanks. It would be good to add the plugin to the list of projects, so to be able to
open tickets on it.

Hi again,

just tested with different datasets and seems this is not Raster transparency
plugin issue. I also can't add transparency for some datasets even using QGIS
Transparency tab.

Also there is another problem. If raster has float data type plugin
can't determine
which values exists in raster and which not, so it is a bit difficult
to setup transparency
for such rasters. Here is example: there are 14.55 and 14.736 values
in raster. If
we change transparency values with step 1.0 both values will be non transparent,
If step is 0.001, all values will be transparent but also many non
exsiting values
will be added to the transparency table.

And third problem is that transparency table in QGIS only allows 5
digits after decimal
separator. In most cases this is enough, but sometimes raster values
have more than
5 digits after decimal separator.

Hi Werner and all,

I really like to see QGis releases freaquently. And you are doing a
great job on that.
I think that 1.7.4 should be released soon. There are already so many
improving fixes. And if waiting more to solve all the bugs we'll never
see other release.

For me the bug #3763 is really a blocker. It is now on low priority,
but it is really pain for me to use any fTools.
When selecting an output file, opening the file dialog takes over 3
minutes. The dialog is unresponsive this time and if trying to close
it qgis crashes.

Hello,
A small update to keep you posted. We have a first proposal for a room to host 
the HF at lyon university. It's a classroom with 60 seats.

It's here : 
http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=45.7384&lon=4.8866&zoom=14&layers=M

That's a 15 min bus ride from the main train station.

The only available dates for this room would be from 12 to 16th of april.
There is a fee, which local commitee ands sponsors should be able to pay.

We've got a few other leads, which may be better or have other dates available 
. 
We should decide for a definitive location (and dates) end of next week 
probably.
We'll let you know as soon as we have other informations.

Vincent, for OSGeo-fr

Hi James,

I would say this is a bug as the ogr driver for MapInfo has no edit
support.  Going to look into it now.

Martin's rework is in master now, I tried and I think in the new gui my 
patch is not neccesary anymore there (untill further use) ...

Will the rework also be in 1.8? I mean should I remove the pull request?

Or should I put some time into to backporting it to 1.7 and/or 1.8.
How am I supposed to do that? Make a 1.7 and a 1.8 pull request?

I think we can add this rework to 1.8 as this branch is not released yet and
there is no feature freeze for it (except things that breaks API). At least we
can try to do this.

Hi Martin,

I've made some tests playing with a few hundred styles, comparing QGIS 1.7.1 and 1.9.0.
Overall, I find your commit very good, thanks a lot!
Still there are a few regressions IMHO. Discussion below.

> Rules now form a hierarchical structure: any rule can contain
> further "child" rules. When rendering, child rules are applied only
> when their parent rule matches. This allows users to build a logical
> trees of rules instead of keeping all rules in a flat list with
> complex filters.
Well, they already did, by using the "refine" button. Still, the new implementation is MUCH better as you can define a parent rule, many children, then change only one parent (before, you had to modify each single rule).


> The options "use only first rule" and "use symbol levels" have been
> removed: now all the matching rules and applied and at the same time
> the rendering order is given by the symbol levels.

In my opinion this is the major regression. With 1.7 it was possible to have some if/else logic, and the priority made it somehow work like SLD & Mapnik:
> because in SLD and Mapnik the order of rules matters
The beauty of the new hierarchical grouping is to help having simpler rules creation and modification. But removing "use only first rule" requires to put back "AND NOT (previous_rule)" criteria to achieve this. This make some use cases more complex and is more computer intensive (the user could put frequent rules on the top to speed up things: subsequent rules are ignored).

>GUI: rules are shown as a tree. They can be organized easily
> with drag and drop 
That's GREAT! Still, apparently the first child rule of a rule need to be created with the "refine current rules" button before being able to drag and drip children. If you have 5 exiting rules that you want to group under a new parent, you create the parent, create a first child, drag and drop the 5 children, then delete the first child.
(Edit: Still sometimes it works... when parent filter is empty?)

> symbol levels dialog for other renderers is now accessible from a
> menu from their "advanced" button
That's one click more for some renderers. It's not consistent across renderers: "Rendering order..." is directly accessible in Rule Based Renderer;
"Symbol levels" is no longer directly accessible. I would suggest to use always "Symbol levels". "Rendering order..." is technically correct but users may confuse it with the rule order, while "symbol levels" does not have this problem. 

=========================================
Summary and other notes:

(+)
1- Truly Hierarchical rules
2- Symbol levels even with several matching rules
3- The ability to change the colour, transparency, output unit and size of several symbols at one time (not
4- Inline editing
5- Drag and drop

(=)
-The "Refine a rule to categories/ranges" windows has an Advanced>Symbol levels widget. Why not...
-Legend does not reflect hierarchy

(-)
1) The priority system and "use only first rule" option disappeared.
2) The ability to display rules in 3 different ways (a flat way, by grouping them by filter or by scale) has disappeared. Now the GUI is similar to previous grouping by filter.
3) The ability to order the display of the rules by clicking on the column title ( label, rule, scale...) disappeared. This was handy!
4) Impossible to drag a rule A to a rule B to have A be a child of B if B has no child yet. 
5) Confusing "Rendering order..."/"Symbol levels"
6) Slightly confusing: direct editing of transparency in list allow e.g. "0,5" which corresponds to "50%" in the slider version of the symbol properties (by the way the latter would benefit from an edit box).


=========================================
Suggested priority future improvements IMHO:
- Reimplement the (-) above as they are regressions IMO:
 1) some optional "use only first rule" and "else" behaviour is needed
 2) is needed specially for scale. Scale ordering (with 3. ) will make 2) less needed.
 3) is more needed than filtering of rules and that 2)
 4) minor (but might confuse users)
 5) minor but easy to fix

 
- Clone rules

- Implement Z-index based on one attribute. Suggested implementation: User says which field has the z index. Lowest z index get rendered below for all rules (using their symbol levels), then next z index, etc. up to highest z-index. Cf. below:
> For example, when drawing a map of roads with nicely
> rendered road outlines and varying Z-levels (bridges / tunnels)
Z-levels is often stored in one single attribute and is not always related to the other attributes.
If you take the main 50 linear feature types, any of them may have values between -5 and +5 in OpenStreetMap, values with -2 and +2 are very common (around 80000 features) and +/- 3 are still frequent (14000). http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/?key=layer#values
Hence currently you need around 350 rules for 50 linear feature types and 7 layers. And this without being able to do this: http://osm.org/go/Tt5bBYZU5-
(Note that rivers may go below a canal, etc., see: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:layer ).

My own experience with complex OSM data would say that the Z-index is the most needed now, and the item 1) is close afterwards along with item 3).
It's more cumbersome to search workarounds without the proper support for Z-index than without the other needed features.
(With my new osm2postgresql script and the Z-index features, it would be possible to out-best Osmarender/mapnik for on the fly OSM map rendering with planet.osm!)

=========================================
About your questions:
> I have some doubts regarding GUI, e.g.:
> expand all rules when GUI is opened?
I would prefer not when I have many rules, and yes when I just have a few. Best would probably be to save the state, as well as the ordering (by clicking column header) if this is implemented.

> delete parent rule's symbol when refining it?
Please don't!
> or completely forbid rules to contain a symbol if they have children?
Please don't! It's good the way it is.

 > checkable rules?
Why not, could be handy sometimes, especially for testing. Still I would consider it low priority because, when needing this often, users would prefer to create a real layer. I sometimes add "0=1 AND ( original_filter )" to de-activate a rule, and maybe the need to use this hack is a smaller nuisance than having many check boxes that you almost never use.
This would be however most needed with feature 1) ("use only first rule" and "else" behaviour).


> better item delegates for inline editing - e.g.
> filter editor with "..." button to open query builder
Would just save 1 click, so not needed I think (and may even be a nuisance).

Hope this helps.
Thanks again for these improvements!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Ellipsoid for distance calculations (confusing
	items in combo)
Message-ID: <CALuHMPBmwv41CMJ1uGDDt0tryba8vtFQpinnVmvX22DW++H+uw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

working with measure tools I found that "Ellipsoid for distance calculations"
combobox from Map tools tab in QGIS options (Settings - Options) has
duplicates. For example, there are tree WGS84 and two Clarke 1866 ellipsoids.

I look at code, then at default srs.db and here is what's I found. In
srs.db we have
two ellipsoids with similar names and different acronyms

acronym         | name      | radius               | parameter2
WGS84          | WGS 84 | a=6378137.0      | rf=298.257223563
IGNF:ELG053 | WGS84  | a=6378137.0000 | rf=298.2572235630000

same for Clarke 1866 ellipsoids

acronym         | name           | radius                | parameter2
clrk66             | Clarke 1866  | a=6378206.4      | b=6356583.8
IGNF:ELG004 | Clarke 1866  | a=6378206.4000 | rf=294.9786982000000

Combobox filled with values forom "name" column and this leads to
duplicate (or very similar) items. Maybe it is better to display ellipsoids
as "name - acronym" to avoid confusing? Or even remove this duplicate
entries from srs.db?

Also there is another problem. When "Ellipsoid for distance calculations"
compo populated first of all added "None / Planimetric" item, after that
values from srs.db. And finally "None / Planimetric" item is replaced with
ellipsoid stored in settings here "/qgis/measure/ellipsoid". This replacement
created duplicate entry of any ellipsoid, saved as default. For example, if
I save "Airy 1830" as default and then close options dialog and open it again
I'll get two "Airy 1830" entries in combo.
I don't understand is this replacement necessary, maybe it should be removed?

Thanks

Hi,

On 1.7.3 'Zoom to Best Scale' does not seem to work properly when
'Enable on the fly CRS transformation' is enabled in Project
Properties.  If 'Enable on the fly CRS transformation' is checked,
'Zoom to Best Scale' zooms beyond 1:1.  If 'Enable on the fly CRS
transformation' is unchecked 'Zoom to Best Scale' zooms to 1:1
correctly.  My project and imagery are both in EPSG:32618 (UTM 18N,
WGS84).

I do observe the same problem on 1.6.

I'm using 1.7.3 on Windows 7.

Thanks,

It's a classroom, so we should be able to arrange tables just as we want. The 
classroom has got 60 seats, so it should be easy if we are 40 to create 
workgroups inside the room.

> - is there a data projector available for ad hoc presentations?
There should be one, and we'll provide a backup one.

> - can we stay late in the venue
We can stay up to 22h in the venue, maybe 23h, except on monday (18h).

> - is it (very) close to cheap accommodation
It's not in Lyon downtown, but a few bus/metro stops away. I did not check 
accomodation yet, but we should find cheap accomodation less than 30mins away 
(max).

> - does it have plenty of power outlets
We'll try to provide that.

> - is there good wireless network access available
It's a university (of medicine), so the network should be good. We'll provide 
at least another wifi access point as backup, and check that we can connect 
with cables too.

> - can we snack and drink coffee in the venue
We can't normally drink or eat inside the classroom, but we'll have a hall 
available for pauses, dedicated to that.

> If you can meet all these criteria, geek happiness goes up, commits

Even for 5 days then :)
This place seems to be satisfying all criterias. I've got one other lead I 
want to have news about, and if the latter does not work, we'll go for 
Rockfeller street ( that's the street where the medecine university is :)

Vincent

Subject: [Qgis-developer] UI element renaming
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-WcWsSRG3BgRbLgaLnVR4TtqmdsAOt9YEachG2DvZT0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just wanted to know if people would be up for renaming the menu item Query
in the right click menu of a layer to "Filter". IMO Query means to reduce
and extract a subset of data into another set, vs Filter which implies just
a reduction.  The current working of Query is really just a filter action
vs extracting a new dataset.   A few people I have shown QGIS to have found
the wording and action confusing.  Thoughts?


I would also like to rename the "Save Style", "Load Style" etc at the
bottom of the Layer Properties dialog to "Save Properties" "Load
Properties" as clicking the Save Style button saves a lot more then just
the the styles of the layer, it currently saves all the properties that
have been setup for that layer including stuff from the Field tab, Actions
tab, Metadata tab etc.  As the buttons are also at the base of the dialog
and persistent no matter which tab you are on I think this make sense.
 Thoughts?

Hi Stefan,

Interesting plugin. It used to be quite a hassle to make the custom maps
for our Garmin Colorado 400t. I currently can't get your plugin to function
properly and will contact you about that. You don't seem to have a repo or
issue tracker set up for your plugin yet at planet.qgis.org.

After looking at your code for creating the initial TIFF with world file
via Composer, it struck me that that technique could be repurposed to make
an 'Export to High-Resolution Georeferenced Raster' plugin, solving the
difficulty of quickly getting quality high-res geo-ref'd output from QGIS
[1]. (Unless I haven't heard of some new feature in QGIS, or plugin, to do
so.)

Couple of things the plugin could need for input:

1) Output parameters (file format, dpi, scale, pixel area, rotation, etc),
some need to be Composer-specific.

2) Area of interest, referenced from a map layer, or entered extents. Would
set the map item's viewport extent. Page size can be interpreted from that,
scale and dpi.

3) QGIS Project CRS (and maybe a particular layer's nodata or alpha channel
settings) can be embedded in output using GDAL.

4) Optionally reproject the output.

5) Optionally create overviews or TMS tiles. gdaladdo and gdal2tiles,
tilecache, or mapproxy could be leveraged for this.

May I repurpose that code from your plugin to start testing these ideas out?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CRS and bookmarks #3243
Message-ID: <4F2512CF.5090305@duif.net>

Hi Jef et al.,

thanks for merging/pulling
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/78
and thereby closing
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3243

I see that the 'little' bookmark dialog has been removed in favour of 
the bookmark list. Although I did like the little dialog, I think 
removing unnessary gui stuff is good.

Some remarks:

- I see that it is possible to edit the bookmark_id and that you can use 
both characters as numbers in it? Choosing an id which already excists 
just silently fails..
I'm not sure if that 'id' is an internal one, or who is enforcing the 
unicity of the id. But should we not just remove that column? The user 
already has an editable name AND project to make it recongnizable for 
him/her?

- the last column in th bookmarkslist shows you 'SRID' of the bookmark 
coordinates while for example in the projection selector we show the 
'Authority ID'.
Personnaly I feel more comfortable with the Authority ID's, and I think 
the SRID should be a technical/internal ID (but maybe other people feel 
the other way around?).
So I would be in favour of showing the Authority ID instead of the SRID

- double clicking a row in the list let you zoom to that bookmark 
(preffered, see discussion in http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3243).
But at this moment it ALSO puts you in edit mode after the zoom..
I think it would be better to stop that event, so the user is not 
changing coordinates or names by accident?

- Now that is a grid, I think we could maybe put a filter above it (for 
users with long bookmark lists, or to be able to sort on CRS or Projectname?

What is the opinion of other users/devs?
If agreed, I can make it a feature request, or even implement this 
myself I think...

Richard Duivenvoorde

+1 from me, it's useless information to the user and only makes it
confusing.

 So I would be in favour of showing the Authority ID instead of the SRID


I thought they were the same thing, if not then what ever has the most
meaning should be shown.

I think it would be better to stop that event, so the user is not changing

+1 The action should be Double click to zoom, F2 to rename.

+1 Should be pretty easy to whack a filter model in there.

Not sure if this info really necessary. In my opinion this column can
be removed.

The little dialog was still using sqlite3, while the dialog switched to QtSql.

I originally had removed "New bookmark" completely, but later I thought that it
might be very useful.  So newBookmark() in the list was a compromise - you
could well restore the old behaviour.

Only with QGISDEBUG - but you're right.

Ok, with me.   If you add item delegates you should also add some for the
coordinates. By default Qt creates spinboxes with two decimals - useless for
lat/lon.

BTW now that the CRS is considered by the dialog, it must be shown.
Otherwise it might zoom to some spot in an unexpected CRS without
a chance to see why.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Slow raster loading
Message-ID: <4F268A32.7010300@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Currently, loading coloured rasters with stretching to minmax on is extremely slow
(almost unusable):
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4421
E.g. I could load a large RasterLite in <1 sec instead of minutes (!).
The trick, from the user point of view, is to disable stretching by default, and
enable it only for rasters where the option makes sense (e.g. a monoband, greyscale).
Obviously we could do it better, disabling the stretch for the rasters where it does
not make sense.
In addition, Giovanni noticed several other small bugs.
Anybody interested in looking into this? The situation is rather intricate, but most
of the fixes should be trivial, and would improve usability a lot.
We (Faunalia) are ready to help testing and clarifying.
Thanks a lot.

Hi Mayeul

But removing "use only first rule" requires to put back "AND NOT (previous_rule)" criteria to achieve this. This make some use cases more complex and is more computer intensive (the user could put frequent rules on the top to speed up things: subsequent rules are ignored).

The "use only first rule" was removed intentionally - it is better to
have just one rendering logic. I believe the "else" rule (once added)
will handle these cases just fine.

> (Edit: Still sometimes it works... when parent filter is empty?)

When you add a rule, it is either added at the same level as the
current rule or it is added to the root rule when there is no
selection. This behavior might be changed.

I consider "symbol levels" to be an advanced technique, therefore now
it is hidden under Advanced button to keep the GUI simple - too many
controls make the GUI less intuitive. I agree that the wording "sombol
levels" / "rendering order" may be confusing. Any native speakers who
would recommend using one over the other?

Legend widget is not made to handle hierarchies. Then there is also
legend in composer which works with just lists of symbols+labels. I
think it is reasonable to keep it as it is.

I have no plans to add it.

> 2) The ability to display rules in 3 different ways (a flat way, by grouping them by filter or by scale) has disappeared. Now the GUI is similar to previous grouping by filter.

I think it does not make sense anymore since everyone can arrange the
rules as necessary.

> 3) The ability to order the display of the rules by clicking on the column title ( label, rule, scale...) disappeared. This was handy!

That might appear again. The question is how to get back to
"unordered" state - the original ordering of the rules could get lost.

Works for me.

Addressed above.

I would suggest you to work this around with some custom scripting:
prepare the rules just for one or few z-levels and create a script
that would clone the rules and adjust the z-levels.

I am not sure whether the rework should go into 1.8 or not. If 1.8
will not be released soon (let's say in about a month or two) then it
would make sense to backport it there. Otherwise it would be better to
keep it just in master to avoid releasing it in beta state.

Anyway your patch could be backported at least to 1.7 - I think you
can leave it open and we will try to backport it.

my notes are in the ticket.

There a few bugs (see ticket) and a couple of things need to be changed:

*) computing of stats takes a long time, it is easy to see that also
with not that big rasters it takes a lot, especially if multi-band,
hurting the user experience. The proposal is to make computing of stats
optional.

*) in the raster properties there are two properties ("contrast
enhancement" and "standard deviation") that have a button to save the
option in a way to allow the setting be persistent among qgis sessions.
This obviously should be moved to the general options, allowing to
override at a layer level.

cheers

Hi all,

currently QGIS used srs.db to store projection definitions. But with
this approach
users can't reorganize CRS definitions as they want (always used predefined tree
with predefined groups).

This can be solved by switching to file-based storage of the CRS
definitions as in
latest ArcGIS versions or wxGIS. All CRS definitions are stored as
files in WKT or
SPR (preffered) format in subdirectories in some redefined folder and
user can freely
create new subdirectories and move files between them to organize
CRS'es as he/she
wants.

Opinions, comments?

Thanks

Instead, why not extend the current CRS look up tool to allow for custom folders,
re-ordering or "favourites"?  Ideally, create a CRS Manager app to do it. From
what I've seen most users (ok, maybe just me) won't use more CRS 
than in their "recently used list" --which works well for me :)

Otherwise, your proposal seems to assume, you're going to have re-write 
all the search/lookup and "custom CRS creation" functions instead.  Ouch.

My two cents worth, or even less,
Tyler

Hi Alex

Isn't it a regression to go from sqlite files to text files? Sqlite 
allows to search tables with sql and afaik this is used in several places.

>while moving and editing flat text files is much easier for ordinal users

Ordinal users normally don't care about CRS at all. I agree with Andreas 
here that it is much more difficult to have knowledge about CRS than 
using an sqlite editor (or the commandline prompt).

Marco

My vision is roughly the same as you describe: first of all, leave the
libraries (core, gui, analysis) strictly in c++. These are our engines
and they should be robust and fast. However the application code (in
src/app) taking care of GUI usually does not run tasks that need to be
super-fast. This is the area where the possibility to switch from c++
to Python might be useful. The python code could be more compact, not
needing to compile and in case of fatal errors it would just show an
error message instead of crashing whole QGIS.

I certainly do not support rewriting stuff from c++ to python. The
whole point is that by having the possibility to put python code
directly in qgis app we may be more efficient implementing new
features and/or reusing existing code from plugins.

Hi Larry

Good to hear, that it could be helpful for someone (when working properly)!
Please feel free to repurpose the code! That`s the idea of open source,
is`nt it?

Regarding the repository:
I simply did not manage to define the "Public ssh key" properly. So I was
not able to upload my code from my local git repository...
Can you help me here? The description on the plugin-webside is not very
detailed on exactly that point (SSH key)... 

Regarding your problems running the plugin:
In some cases, the boarder of the mapComposer is not rendered in black
(which stopps the while loops). This can happen, when there are no dark
pixels in the map closed to the border.
Then the while loops can run into infinitive-looping.
I am planing to prevent the while loops from that by
a) stopping the loop if darkness in the map-pixels decreases (sequence
starting from the lower and right 
border).
b) stopping the loop last pixel (in row / column) is reached, and giving an
error message in that case.

The new code for the while loops looks like this (I will update the plugin
next week (I am on a work trip and have no access to my private maschine,
where I have my local repository)):


Regarding your ideas for input parameters:
I am not sure if your ideas are related to the GarminCustomMap-plugin or
related to a new high-resolution "tiff"-export.
For ideas 1), 2), and 5) I do not really have an idea how they could be
applied on a GarminCustomMap (since the Garmin units are rather restrictive
in these matters (but probably not all of them?))...

1) Output parameters (file format, dpi, scale, pixel area, rotation, etc),
some need to be Composer-specific.

2) Area of interest, referenced from a map layer, or entered extents. Would
set the map item's viewport extent. Page size can be interpreted from that,
scale and dpi.

3) QGIS Project CRS (and maybe a particular layer's nodata or alpha channel
settings) can be embedded in output using GDAL.
QGIS Project CRS is used as input to gdalwarp if necessary for producing
WGS84 output (although working in WGS84 results in "better"
GarminCustomMaps)

4) Optionally reproject the output.
See 3)

5) Optionally create overviews or TMS tiles. gdaladdo and gdal2tiles,
tilecache, or mapproxy could be leveraged for this.

Cheers
Stefan

Yes, I'm seeing something similar (on Mac 10.6.8, Python 2.6, Qt
4.7.4), but I also never get any output. The plugin just skips ahead
as if the TIFF was created, when it hasn't been, if QGIS doesn't spin
up and freeze with high cpu usage instead. Looking forward to testing
out your improvements, as your plugin will be very helpful for having
custom maps in the field, but built and maintained in QGIS.

Sorry about the confusion. Those ideas were part of the GeoTIFF export
plugin. Got carried away while writing the email. I did find much of
your Composer code in the PyQGIS Cookbook, but liked your approach for
trimming the map before saving.

I've put together most of the interface of my suggested plugin [1]. No
actual work being done yet, and I'm not 100% sure I've got the
interface calculations right. It'll be a mini-frontend to leveraging
Composer to produce a flat, georeferenced TIFF of one's canvas, within
a given area of interest and optional alpha masking. Intending to use
it for producing output to bring into MAPublisher in Illustrator.

I wonder why Composer doesn't already have georeferenced TIFF export
functionality? Or, offer any of gdal's raster formats, for that
matter? (Apart from someone not having the time to craft the C
programming yet.)

Thanks for helping me get the idea for the plugin.

I actually commented on this on CRS the other day. I think adding an
export/import tool to the custom CRS tool could help a lot, and the prj
wkt format could be used or other formats as seen on spatialreference.org

Personally sqlite seems like a more efficient solution to me within the
program, but I agree better access to the information can help some
users. We might also consider a form in QGIS with boxes for each of the
possible proj parameters rather than having to figure out the syntax
(personally I copy past from spatialreference.org)

Thanks,
Alex

Yes, favourites would be particularly handy.  I think the best way of implementing them would be to have a little button next to each entry in the recent list to "pin" it to the list.
This would be nice and quick and simple.  Does anybody actually use enough CRSs that they really need something more complicated?

I kind of like that idea. Also a toggle to collapse all would be nice
(keyboard shortcut? and a button outside the list), to make it faster to
jump between major sections of the list in the current interface. Maybe
the favorite could be on another tab too in case the bottom window isn't
big enough.

Yes, some of us do use quite a few projections, but I'm an academic so
that might be fringe: my local area is 6 state plane zones, 2 utm zones,
1 albers, google, wgs84 - that's just the list of things I commonly use
when working on data in my state. Of course California is bigger than
many countries so that too could put me out of the normal user group...

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alister,

are you on 1.7.x or on master? Because the crs selector has had an 
overhaul in master, eg having a filterbox which looks into all fields 
(names, epsg codes etc).

And has a 'recently used' list, containing your 8 last used crs's

Does that not for fill your wishes?

 Hi,

 I see that Martin replaced the old Query Builder with the new

 First I thought that the ability to load unique/distinct values is now 
 missing. Later, I discovered that there is a right-click option to load 
 the values (should read the help-text).

 May I suggest that we rename the category "Fields" to "Fields and

You can follow indications on Github, it's exactly the same way hub.qgis.org 
works. The place where you can upload your ssh key in qgis hub is on the "my

I perform the snap after the user clicks as I received the signal, and

But I would like to make the snapping visible to the user, i.e. snap the

I could not find any setxyCoordinates in the QgsMapCanvas. Is there any

(Otherwise, a nice new feature would to allow by option the snap to

I put together a project and when accessing it I see the project name and the layers list, but the map is rendered light red or pink and no data is displayed.

There are some png.h files from other packages (eg. gdal), but none of them are in the standard include directory paths, only in the source path where the package was built from. The one png.h that was version 1.5 was found in the Qt build directory---I moved it out of the way and did a rebuild to no avail.

Although I can't see anything on the map, the identify tool will display attribute data if I'm lucky enough to click in the right spot, which tells me that my layers are being accessed and the map extent is being set correctly.

Is there a directory where generated images are stored as in UMN MapServer? I haven't found a configuration options for it.

Of course this may have nothing to do with why my map is blank...

Any ideas?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS for android got GPS and compass support
Message-ID: <4F287E8A.8000002@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi all,
Lately I?ve been working on adding native GPS support to QGIS on Android 
and sucessfully managed to implement it. A big thanks goes to the 
municipality of Schoten in Belgium which sponsored the developement. 
This functionality is included in the latest nightly builds as of 
yesterday and in master-alpha4.

Furthermore I've implemented a plugin that reads the internal compass 
readings and shows the value in a small dock widget.

Other bugs like the font size have been fixed and the overall look is 
much nicer.

As usual, all the latest news, bugs and downloads can be found at [0] or 
on my blog [1]

As a last message, remember that any economic support will make QGIS on 
android evolve much quicker, so if you can, or know somebody who could, 
please consider sponsoring.

Ciao
Marco

Hi everyone.

I want to build a better dot-density map plugin.  The one that is included in the "Vector->Research Tools->Random Points" is a bit clumsy because: 

a) you already need to have a field describing the number of points, and a lot of the time I want to try 1dot=100 and 1dot=500 and 1dot=1000 in an interactive way to see what looks better, and not have to go into the attributes (or PostGIS) to try different numbers, and

b) usually I want to have several fields shown at once (blue dots for households and green dots for jobs, or different shades of blue for data from different years)

c) sometimes I want to show negative numbers too, in a different color (1 red dot = 100 less jobs, 1 blue dot = 100 more jobs)

It's probably a pretty easy python plugin to develop, simply build a new layer with random dots generated from several fields, each dot with a single attribute being the field it was generated from. And a user dialog to select the field and the (positive or negative) ratio of dots per field value.    The color coding can be done by the user afterwards, in the new layer. 

I don't think I can write this myself or in-house right now since I'm more of a Java programmer and our best python programmer is swamped.  I'm thinking of outsourcing it to eLance.com, since QGIS.ORG cannot accept earmarked donations.  What do you guys think?  Or should I just file a feature request in the bug tracking system and hope for the best?

If the calculation is fast enough there could be a dynamic slider for points
per dot.

Another place where this would be useful is stream definition from a flow
accumulation raster.

Dynamic sliders would require the plugin to draw the points, not just build a new shape file. Which would be even better. It would be great if we could have a symbology plugin (like the Diagram plugin.)  

But I was imagining something much simpler, that just constructs a new layer of points. 

For those that don't know, Elance is a fairly simple system to hire freelance people. I've used it a few of times for django projects and LaTex stuff.

Hi,

on my computer SAGA Wetness index module takes about 3 minutes and Wind effect about 10 minutes.

I'm on master as always ;)
I had assumed the others who were talking about bookmarks and things are also familiar with the new dialog, but I could be wrong.

Not really - any time you need to work with a few unusual crses, your "favourite" crses will drop off the list.

Personally I don't really have a problem because I only have a couple of favourite crses and I can find them very quickly with the filter.  But not everyone is like me.

A couple of others have mentioned the idea of bookmarks - I was just suggesting a convenient way (pinnable recent items) to implement them without making the user interface more complicated than it needs to be.

Of course, for that suggestion to work well when people use a lot of crses it would also require either:
- the list length to be configurable (or at least more than 8 items), and/or
- the list to show 8 items (or whatever) + however many favourites they define.

Alister
