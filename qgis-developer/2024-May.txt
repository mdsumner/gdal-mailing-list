Hi Admire,
thanks for sharing these info!

Looking at the list of the 51 unapproved plugins, I see something which 
seems strange to me:

- there are some unapproved plugins for which it is reported a number of 
downloads > 0 and also a number of "votes" > 0 although there is no 
version available to be downloaded (e.g. "BigQuery Layers", 
"FastVersion"): how is it possible?

- there are some unapproved plugins having various version available to 
be downloaded for which it is reported a great number of downloads and a 
great number of "votes" and that are very recently updated (e.g. 
"OpenQuake Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit", "Lizmap" whihc is also 
flagged as "Featured"): are they mistakenly listed among the unapproved 
plugins?

Best regards.

Andrea

The policy has always been that binaries are NOT allowed.

Seems fair to me.

There is no policy AFAIK except that they must be unique and valid
directory names (unix) without weird characters.

Kind regards.

Dear QGIS Community,

On behalf of the QGIS.ORG project, I'm extremely pleased to announce the winning proposals for our 2024 QGIS.ORG grant programme. Read all about the voting results here:

https://blog.qgis.org/2024/05/01/qgis-grant-programme-2024-results/

A number of interesting and useful proposals didn?t make it because of our limited budget; we encourage organizations to pick up one of their choices and sponsor it.

Regards,

My concern here would be that we create a new problem: Having to moderate
the comments. Maybe we could use a simple like/dislike and/or predefined
lists of comments (e..g "Works great", "Doesnt work on Linux", "Doesnt work
on macOS" etc.).

Dear P,

Currently, the plugin can only be renamed through the administration page. To proceed with the request, please email us from the email associated with the plugin author's account.

Best regards,
Lova

Dear all,

I'm the maintainer of the plugin opeNoise (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/opeNoise/)
The organization paying the maintenance would like to change the name from opeNoise to opeNoise Map
Is it possible inside the plugin repo do that?
If I just change the name entirely in the project is it enough?
Thanks for your help

Hi Admire,

Thank for your work, I agree with all of your proposals.

I think there are also a few things that could be automated:
- Check for binary files
- Check for very long plugin names (like [0])
- Check for python/QGIS 2 plugins
- Check that issue tracker url exists
- ...


It would also be interesting to trigger the existing approval automated checks on
the actual plugins set, to see if it fits the new requirements (I think
about the recent license check for instance).

probably this would be better

git fetch qgis

Hoping that qgis is the remote that target your QGIS git repository. You
can check this with

git remote -v

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS docker images for python plugin testing
Message-ID: <CADQ4pmC4Z4cOT3XX242ncUGmH8aCOUCVm2hZR3fXD72TM913Tw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello. We have been using QGIS docker images in CI tests for our python
plugin. In particular, we downloaded versions tagged as qgis:release-3_36,
qgis:latest and similar. In the past we noticed there was no qgis:ltr, but
it was recently added. Recently the qgis:latest version ceased to work,
because it stopped right after running it. After some checks, we found out
that in previous versions the docker CMD launched a supervisor that kept
the container running, but this is not the case anymore.
"Cmd": [
                "/usr/bin/supervisord",
                "-c",
                "/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf"
            ],
In qgis:latest and qgis:ltr we see:
 "Cmd": [
                "/bin/bash"
            ],
In addition to this, since April 28, when running unit tests for our plugin
via pytest, all tests are green, but then we get an exit code 139. Doing
the same while executing the docker in interactive mode, we see that it has
a segmentation fault after finishing running the tests:
== 80 passed, 1 warning in 1.38s ==
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Has anyone else experienced the same issues? Do you have any suggestions?
Thanks,
Paolo

***Good morning,* *

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is hosting a code sprint, from the 
10th through the 12th of July. This code sprint will be open to all OGC 
APIs and encodings and will have special tracks in topics such as "Data 
Quality".

//

//

/A Code Sprint is a three day hybrid event, where dozens of 
developers?from around the world come together to code and share their 
ideas?regarding sharing geospatial information. Even if you are not 
a?developer, there are lots of ways to be involved in the code 
sprint,?without actually writing code; e.g.: testing, documentation, 
issues.? As in previous code sprints, this sprint will include a mentor 
stream targeted at newcomers, which includes an onboarding day with lots 
of introductory tutorials (see here 
<https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-events/wiki/2024-Joint-OGC-%E2%80%93-OSGeo-%E2%80%93-ASF-Code-Sprint#mentor-streams>, 
examples of past tutorials)./

**

The sprint will run on an hybrid format, with the face to face component 
taking place in Geovation <https://geovation.uk/>, London.


You can find more information about the sprint, including a registration 
link in the

code sprints website: https://developer.ogc.org/sprints/


Some sponsoring opportunities are still available, for those who wish to 
contribute:

https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-events/wiki/July-2024-Open-Standards-Code-Sprint#call-for-sponsors-mega

You can find more information about OGC standards at: 
https://developer.ogc.org/

**

Hope to see you at the code sprint,

All the Best,

Joana

Hi Tim,

We already have a problem managing plugins.

The situation will be no better in the future. My suggestion is not to 
add an additional problem, just to solve the current one. I understand 
your point and opening comments can be a problem. But can also add 
valuable information about the plugins. It is a tradeoff.

I would allow comments from authenticated users [1], without any 
moderation. The purpose is to get evaluations and feedback from several 
users, not from just one user. It works well, as far as I know, at 
Wordpress as I mentiones, and many more software with plugins.

It makes sense to be open text, to raise questions, security and privacy 
issues and point out features not available in any predefined list of 
options.

Maybe in the future we can discuss this again, when we have 10k plugins ;-)

Best regards,

Jorge

Hi Abdelghani,

disappointing:

This looks like a bug on the exporting code. Have you checked the issue
tracker?


> Also I've seen that in the python API documentation it is mentioned that
Qgs3DMapScene is not available. Which means I cannot export the scene using
pyQGIS?

This note is outdated and should be removed. You can access the
Qgs3DMapScene object in python and do an export:
s = Qgs3DMapExportSettings()
... # setup your export settings
iface.mapCanvases3D()[0].scene().exportScene(s)


Best,
Stefanos

Hello Stefanos,

This works for me, thanks! I've also adjusted the altitude clamping so the
buildings don't hover over the terrain.

I've tried to manually export the scene but the results is a bit
disappointing:
[image: image.png]
The terrain is broken, any ideas why ?

Also I've seen that in the python API documentation it is mentioned that
Qgs3DMapScene is not available. Which means I cannot export the scene using
pyQGIS?
[image: image.png]

Thank you in advance,

Cheers,

Abdelghani

Hello,

I would like to know how to fix a plugin screen resolution. Basically, when
you open the plugin in a different screen, it gets squeezed. Is there an
automatic way to detect and fix these issues?

I've been wondering which label to add to a PR to have it
automatically backported and noticed that the labels
like "backport release-3_34" and "backport release-3_36"
do not have a description. Could someone with powers
add such description to make it easier to tell if that's
what you need to add to request the backport ?

Thanks!

Hello everyone,

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE QGIS PLUGINS WEBSITE: We?ve scheduled the migration to the updated servers into production for 06 May 2024. During this time, uploading new plugins will be disabled and the ability to install plugins may be intermittently unavailable.

I mainly focused on the following tasks this week:

  *   Continue working with the QGIS Plugins Site branding updates<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/392>. It?s based on the changes made for the PR #374<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/374>

  *   Some final checks and fixes on the updated servers:
     *   Fix plugins download feature
     *   Fix all the warning status on the monitoring server

Next week, I will focus on post-migration tasks and maintenance. We will also continue with the branding update for the QGIS plugins website.

Have a great weekend.

Best regards,
Lova

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Build problems using install instructions

Not having much luck I'm afraid

I've done a completely new reinstall and followed the instructions down to 
git fetch /qgis/master

at this point
*~/dev/cpp/QGIS/release-3_36*$ git remote -v 
origin  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git (fetch) 
origin  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git (push)

and git status 
On branch release-3_36 
nothing to commit, working tree clean
then 
git fetch qgis/master
git fetch qgis
git fetch QGIS
git fetch qgis/QGIS
git fetch master

all return:
fatal:  does not appear to be a git repository 
fatal: Could not read from remote repository. 
Please make sure you have the correct access rights 
and the repository exists

git fetch https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git   
From https://github.com/qgis/QGIS 
* branch                    HEAD       -> FETCH_HEAD
I think this means get all the changes that have occurred prior to doing the next step,and 
given this is a fresh install no changes have occurred - but I may well be wrong.
  
then 
git rebase -i  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git and 
git rebase -i qgis/master
both yield: fatal: invalid upstream 'https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git'

and at this point
git status

On branch release-3_36 
nothing to commit, working tree clean
I've worked through some of the likely problems at https://thelinuxcode.com/git-push-error-repository-not-found-fixed/[1] and all seems to be OK except for permission errors, 
although none of those raised are working with branches.

Tony

Can you point to the instructions?  This all seems very strange.
I would just expect to clone the repo and checkout the branch you want.

(I also don't follow what you are rebasing if you are just trying to
build from git.)

you left out os/version/etc. and didn't show the clone command.



Also, are you already quite familiar with git, and have you successfully
cloned, made changes on a branch, pushed it, with sometthing else?

Thanks Anita,

QGIS User Group Germany is thinking about starting an initiative to 
raise funds for grant applications that did not make it this time.

The total budget of the grant program was 30k, of which 27k were 
awarded.

Would it be possible to use the "remaining" 3k for #6 on the list (the 
first one which didn't make it) QEP#269 "Update older annotation items 
to new framework", so that 5k of additional funds would have to be 
collected to finance the total amount of 8k for this QEP?

Cheers,
Bj?rn

Hi Bj?rn,

We discussed this in the PSC - and yes, we suggest that co-financing (the
remaining 3k ?) with other funding sources should be possible.

We suggest that the order of the voting should be relevant: the next in
line of the proposals that wasn't accepted and has the highest voting count
should get the precedence. We suggest to allow for a 2 week time slot to
organize the funding for the next in line proposal. If it doesn't work
after 2 weeks than the next in line proposal should get the chance to
organize co-sponsoring.

Does that make sense to all?

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Drawing centerline in polygon as a symbol
Message-ID: <af3ca0acd3984c5d9697f91fbd3c18a6@erdc.dren.mil>

I have building with a ridgeline that I am creating in GooJSON format.  I realize I can't combine a polygon footprint and a center line representing the rood ridgeline into one layer as there is no support for multiple geometries.

My first thought for a workaround is just create a zero area polygon for the centerline.  That is LL=UL and LR=UR.  But since I do not really need the ridgeline as a geometry with duplicate attributes, I wonder if I can add a symbol to the polygon layer that represents the ridgeline.  Not sure how to go about this using the geometry of the layer to calculate the center line of the polygon to create the symbol correctly.

Thanks for any assistance,
Luke

The link to instructions was included in the thread initiation email:  https://github.com/
qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL.md#39-building-different-branches[1]

Also the OS: KDE Neon which runs on Ubuntu 22.04.
I've got to this point as the jammy packages have an incompatibility with neon, and the 
flatpack packages are way out of date.

The initial clone command was  git clone https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git
I'm not at all familiar with git, but have been able to pick up a bit over the last few days 
and been able to successfully build the development version.

My problem now is in building the latest stable version - If another method exists that's 
fine.

My build tree looks like:
*.* 
??? *QGIS* 
   ??? *build-master* 
   ??? *.ci* 
   ??? *cmake*

Hello Stefanos,

You mean issues in the github repo? I've checked there and  apparently
nobody has faced this issue before.

> This note is outdated and should be removed. You can access the
Qgs3DMapScene object in python and do an export:
This worked for me, the resulting scene is however the same as the one I
exported using GUI.

I've also just noticed that even if I did specify to set the altitude
clamping to relative to terrain, some buildings seem to sink into the
terrain :
# set altitude clamping to relative to terrain
s.setAltitudeClamping(qgis.analysis.Qgis.AltitudeClamping(2))

Greetings,

 

On the subject of plugin maintenance two points from my side:

1.	The web page that provides guidance <https://plugins.qgis.org/publish/>  for publishing a plugin, stops short of mentioning that there is an plugin approval process in place. It would be great if this is mentioned in this guide with a few words how the approval process works, and above all how long this takes.
2.	It is nice that plugins can be rated using stars, and as a plugin writer, its is certainly nice to receive five stars. However, it is not at all clear:

a.	what the basis is for such a rating
b.	who submitted that rating

In any web shop you can nowadays post user ratings for purchased products or services, but 

c.	There is always a text box to explain your opinion
d.	You need to leave your name behind

 

I think the above two points would help improve the quality of the QGIS Plugin repository.

 

Kind regards,

Hi Admire,

Thank you for helping with the plugins.

I think we can lower the administration time, if we can enable reviews by the users. Not just voting (that we already have), but written reviews. Written reviews can address issues you mentioned: 

- Duplication of functionality. Plugin functionality already exists in QGIS.

- Plugins containing binaries (and related problems)

- Plugins which are a fork of an existing plugin

- Etc

As an example, Wordpress has about 60k plugins [1]. The submission process and rules are similar [2]. But the credibility about each plugin is mostly based on user's reviews, votes and number of downloads.

Basically, we already almost the same data as wordpress about plugins, but we miss user's reviews. User's reviews can add value.

What do you think?

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Hi Admire

 

Thanks for this! We can certainly task Lova with helping to streamline the process, implement better moderation tools etc. With regards to deleting plugins, I think we should take the approach that we in general do not physically delete things, rather we unpublish them with a flag that removes them from the plugins.xml, search on the plugins page etc. I think it would be prudent to maintain the chain of evidence in case we ever have a dispute or complaint about a plugin.

Hi All

I help out in the approval process of QGIS plugins. There are various issues that are listed  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues to streamline the approval process of plugins.

Over the years there has been a steady increase in plugins that are not approved <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/unapproved/> . This is due to a number of reasons:

* Duplication of functionality. Plugin functionality already exists in QGIS.

* Plugin authors not willing to address issues raised during the approval process.

* Plugins containing binaries (Not really sure about the policy here).

* Plugins which are a fork of an existing plugin and then they get renamed to something else without permission from the original author or the author is no longer interested i.e https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/active_fire2/.

* Old plugins that still use the old architecture i.e Python2.

Could we either implement the following changes to maintain/cleanup the plugin repository.

* Old plugins that were never approved because the author did not care to resolve issues flagged be deleted from the repository i.e https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ban_adresse_locator/

* Plugins that have vague names and offer functionality that is ambiguious i.e https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/upload/ be deleted.

* We could automate the deletion of plugins where feedback has been received but the author hasn't done any corrective measure maybe after a month or couple of months. 

* Automatically flag the plugins which are not approved to Deprecated after some time. 

I think the above and other recommendations will encourage people to use the plugin repository properly as currently it feels like a dumping ground.

 

On a side note: What is the policy for plugin names. I know it is up to the author to give his plugin a suitable name but something like https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/transfer_layerfilegdb_to_geopackage/#plugin-versions looks like a description rather than a name.

Regards

Adire

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Post-mortem of application to Google Summer of Code
Message-ID: <CANrSSZmS-nzbFTi_Gf2i4S-Nr=QyCRgUaFfGbpO55euacgg9Bw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

Last month, I applied for Google Summer of Code (GSoC), unfortunately
I was not accepted into this year's program.
I know it's disappointing, since we all would like to see an open
source alternative to existing ETL, and I feel like the stars were
aligned here.

So here my little post-mortem, and few tips and suggestions to help
futures applications:

What went well

- First QGIS community was very enthusiastic and supportive, I am very
grateful to the community. I was also incredibly well received at the
local contributor meeting in Grenoble.
- We had two rounds of feedbacks to taylor the proposal one by mail,
and a second in person with local contributor meeting

What went wrong

- Despite the enthusiasm around the proposal, my proposal was
rejected. I am only making a guess here, but I suppose it was because
of the lack of mentors.

Tips and suggestions for future applications.

*For students*
- Be proactive to look for mentors
Git commands like 'git log' and 'git blame' are your friends to find
people with common interest in your proposals.Gitk can also be used to
get a more friendly graphical interface
with 'gitk -- ./path/to/directory, you can see all the contributor who
committed in that specify directory for exemple to search for
processing related
use 'gitk -- ./src/core/processing/' or 'gitk -- ./src/gui/processing/'
- QGIS participates in GSoC under the umbrella of the OSGeo
organization. You don't only need to convince QGIS devs but also
OSGeo. So don't only submit proposals on the GSoC platform, and also
post your proposal on the Soc mailing list[0] dedicated to coordinate
at OSGeo level ( soc at lists.osgeo.org )
- Remember that mailing lists are plain text only, I had the surprise
to discover that all the formatting for quoted text didn't work,
because I sent my mails as html( which is the default in gmail) and
not as plain text (And I'm yet to find how to properly justify plain
text mail). The migration from mailing list to discourse should
however fix these issues .

*For mentors*
- Volunteer as a mentor early on the SOC mailing list. There is
usually a call for ideas and mentors[1] around the end of January ~2
month before the application deadline for students. However at this
point you don't have the full picture, you don't know which proposals
students will submit. Some years there are multiple volunteers for
QGIS, this year there was no volunteers for the QGIS project

*For both mentors and students*
- Communicate on SOC mailing list, I can't stress this enough. I think
it's the key point why my proposal was not accepted. It's unfortunate
because I discussed with multiple mentors/companies that were
interested in mentoring me, but we never formalised it on an official
channel of communication.
- Since OSGeo handles a lot of projects, it means we need to be really
vocal. So if there is a match between a student and mentor post it on
the SoC mailing list as well !
-  There is a minimum of one mentor per student, but it's possible to have
more than one mentor (usually two), and other mentors can be added
later on.

*For the QGIS project*
- Improve documentation, if you search for QGIS and GSoC on google you
are redirected to an old page on the former QGIS bug tracker
website[2]. This page was last updated in 2016, and contains a lot of
broken links, and ideas from 2016. There is existings page on the
OSGeo wiki[3] with recommendations for students, suggested ideas, and
former projects, but it might be worth having a dedicated page for
QGIS in the developer documentation.
- Suggest ideas to the OSGeo organization, during the call for ideas.
These ideas will be displayed on the OSGeo page on the GSoC platform
and on the OSGeo wiki and will help influence the proposals submitted
in a direction that fit the QGIS project.
QGIS doesn't lack of ideas that could be a GSoC proposals, we could
pick two or three QGIS Enhancement Proposals each year (ideally
ranging from short  ~175 hours to long ~350 hours project)

*For OSGeo*
I don't know the volume of applications OSGeo received so it might be
difficult to answer to everyone, but it's always appreciable to get a
personalized answer instead of a generic email from Google platform.


Lastly, I'd like to end with a positive note, even though I was not
accepted, I still plan to stay around and maybe work on a smaller
portion of my proposal on my own.

Hi Valentin,

I'm really sad to hear that you were not selected.

I was really happy to meet you in person in Grenoble, and thought at
that time that you really deserved to be choosen. Your proposal was of
high quality, and you prove to have a great maturity for your arge (and
this post-mortem mail proves it even more, I share all of your
conclusions).

I think that we fail something on our side (Oslandia side) regarding the
lack of mentors, and thought that this matter was addressed.

I encourage you to continue your effort and hope to see QGIS pull
requests in near future.

Regards,
Julien

*Good morning,*

*

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is hosting a code sprint, from the 
10th through the 12th of July. This code sprint will be open to all OGC 
APIs and encodings and will have special tracks in topics such as "Data 
Quality".

//

//

/A Code Sprint is a three day hybrid event, where dozens of 
developers?from around the world come together to code and share their 
ideas?regarding sharing geospatial information. Even if you are not 
a?developer, there are lots of ways to be involved in the code 
sprint,?without actually writing code; e.g.: testing, documentation, 
issues.? As in previous code sprints, this sprint will include a mentor 
stream targeted at newcomers, which includes an onboarding day with lots 
of introductory tutorials (see here 
<https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-events/wiki/2024-Joint-OGC-%E2%80%93-OSGeo-%E2%80%93-ASF-Code-Sprint#mentor-streams>, 
examples of past tutorials)./

**

The sprint will run on an hybrid format, with the face to face component 
taking place in Geovation <https://geovation.uk/>, London.


You can find more information about the sprint, including a registration 
link in the

code sprints website: https://developer.ogc.org/sprints/


Some sponsoring opportunities are still available, for those who wish to 
contribute:

https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-events/wiki/July-2024-Open-Standards-Code-Sprint#call-for-sponsors-mega 


You can find more information about OGC standards at: 
https://developer.ogc.org/

**

Hope to see you at the code sprint,

All the Best,

Joana

Hi All
How can we, and do we prepare for this next year?

I take it we need:

Mentors to be put forward - I see this information
<https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/>:
*Mentors are people from the community who volunteer to work with a GSoC
contributor. Mentors provide guidance such as pointers to useful
documentation, code reviews, etc. In addition to providing GSoC
contributors with feedback and pointers, a mentor acts as an ambassador to
help GSoC contributors integrate into their project?s community. Some
organizations choose to assign more than one mentor to each of their GSoC
contributors. Many members of the community provide guidance to their
project?s GSoC contributors without mentoring in an ?official? capacity,
much as they would answer anyone?s questions on the project?s mailing list
or chat channel. *

I also see there is a fair amount time required by the mentor and that a
stipend is provided to the project at the end of the GSoC. Would this
stipend be then passed onto the Mentor to assist with the time applied?

----
Contributors - I see this is for individuals - is this something we can
broadcast on our channels and within our user groups?

Hello everyone.

Please find below the report on the maintenance and development of QGIS-Django and QGIS-Hugo for the last week:

Migration of the QGIS plugins website:

  *   We have successfully migrated the QGIS plugins website to an updated server. Many thanks to everyone who helped us achieve this.
  *   The QGIS plugins website now uses up-to-date stacks and packages such as Django 4, Postgresql 16, and the latest Metabase.
  *   Please feel free to share your feedback or create issues about them on the QGIS-Django repository

New PRs QGIS-Hugo:

  *   Fix in page anchor scroll<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/237>
  *   Make the download link on top in the installation guide<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/239>
  *   Change all project link occurrences to product<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/241>

This week, I will work on fixing QGIS-Hugo issues, performing maintenance tasks, and updating the branding for the QGIS plugin website.

Best regards,
Lova

Hello everyone,

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE QGIS PLUGINS WEBSITE: We?ve scheduled the migration to the updated servers into production for 06 May 2024. During this time, uploading new plugins will be disabled and the ability to install plugins may be intermittently unavailable.

I mainly focused on the following tasks this week:

  *   Continue working with the QGIS Plugins Site branding updates<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/392>. It?s based on the changes made for the PR #374<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/374>

  *   Some final checks and fixes on the updated servers:

     *   Fix plugins download feature
     *   Fix all the warning status on the monitoring server

Next week, I will focus on post-migration tasks and maintenance. We will also continue with the branding update for the QGIS plugins website.

Have a great weekend.

Best regards,
Lova

(I'm here as a packager and not currently deeply enough involved in qgis
to function as a mentor, but my opinion is based on other communities
where I feel qualified to be a mentor.)

A contrarian view: I view GSoC as a google recruiting activity; it's
like having interns, except you care even less if they do anything
useful or cause trouble.  For those who haven't been a manager at a
company and dealt with labor law: interns are awesome because after 10
weeks or whatever they terminate on schedule.  That means if they are
unsuitable you can just take them to lunch and say it's been great and
not rehire them, and this is vastly less costly and painful than firing
someone.  If they are suitable you can invite them back for next summer
or for a permanent position, and you've taken a bunch of risk off the
table.  I'm not saying I know that this is google's plan; it's just
obviously what a company would do.  It's entirely reasonable of them to
do this.

However: I don't want to be staff for a company's recruiting activity,
basically at all, but if so only at a proper consulting rate with
acceptable terms -- which is obviously out of the question.  So I simply
step back and ignore GSoC.

I do try to be helpful to people, regardless, as long as they have met
their half of the social contract around asking for help.  I have found
GSoC and non-GSoC people to be on both sides of that, and am not
claiming there is a correlation.  I do see people showing up in another
project's list saying "I'm interesting in this project [listed as GSoC
fodder but needing doing anyway, that they obviously know nothing about
and know almost nothing about the project] - can you tell me how to
proceed?".  I think many people ignore them, and some tell them to first
install the project, learn how it works and start reading the code.
That's usually the end of that!  Others come from a place of more clue
and more importantly more effort, and that goes much better.

That's an interesting question.  I would guess the project is set up to
provide payments and deal with the required tax reporting in the first
place.  There is also the question what's in the GSoC org agreement and
if that's ok.  I would not assume it is ok; it seems structured to hand
money to projects not mentors, perhaps as part of claiming the entire
program expense as charity.  Speculation of course -- the point is that
these are surely agreements written by their lawyers, and it's best not
to make assumptions.

Mildly, I see asking more than a small number of times as crossing over
into advertising for google's recruiting activity and thus into spammy.

I don't know if I'm an extreme outlier or part of the silent 50% in my
opinions.  I am pretty sure I'm an outlier in being willing to outright
say them!

I'm writing this partly because when project leaders ask "why aren't
more people volunteering to be mentors" it may not have occured to them
that some (fraction unclear) just outright wouldn't because of the
structural issue, before you get to the other considerations.

Hi Greg
Thanks for replying - that is a very interesting read - and somewhat
disheartening. So my response is, is this something we get involved with or
not?
My thoughts on getting involved in this was additional funding to build up
and mentor up and coming QGIS developers. Is there are way to triage this
process so it does benefit us?

Thanks
Em

My take is that people sort into

  A) generally able and willing to spend some time helping new people
  trying to contribute, but who may be a little confused, for the good
  of the project

    1) GSoC is fine and they are happy to volunteer to GSoC-mentor
    (written that way to separate from helping people separately from an
    explicit GSoC agreement).

    2) they don't want to volunteer for Google and they just step back

  B) they aren't able/willing to spend time helping out new people

and that A1 people do GSoC-mentoring and the rest don't.  That's fine,
and I don't think the project needs to do anything in particular.

I don't think it's a good idea to try to move people from B to A1 by
paying GSoC-mentors.  I think it causes too many issues that have downsides
in terms of the overall social contract.

I don't think it's feasible to move people from A2 to A1 by paying
enough, as the org stipend for GSoC isn't going to pay GSoC-mentors
$500/hr, and arguably it shouldn't.  If one is paid and others aren't,
that's going to cause trouble.  And if mentors get paid more than people
doing paid development, that's also trouble.  And then there's people
helping out random contributors.

Certainly it is normal for open source projects to participate in GSoC,
and I don't mean to suggest that QGIS not do that.  Clearly in many
organizations there are a significant number of people willing to
GSoC-mentor.

Overall, I would only suggest the the project be sensitive to the fact
that A2 people exist (and not treat them like they are crazy or
unreasonable, which so far has been entirely a non-problem).  This is
mostly a tone thing, perhaps a bit of "If you're comfortable
volunteering as a mentor".  I wrote because it appeared that people
didn't realize this.

Hi all

We have been experiencing a very high load on the plugins server. Despite
moving to a more plugins server the problem is ongoing. We plan to add some
rules that require a captcha or similar if you want to download the zip
files for plugins from the web site (i.e. if the user agent is not QGIS
Desktop), which will hopefully reduce the load on the server somewhat. Lova
will keep you posted as we work on a fix, apologies for the inconvenience
in the meantime.

Regards

Tim

  [high plugin load]

Three suggestions:

  is this a distributed problem, or a few abusive addresses?  In
  openstreetmap I think they would just firewall the addresses in
  questio.

  please don't use google recapcha or anything else without stellar
  privacy policies

  consider rate-limiting IP addresses instead, 1s delay for a few, then
  30s or something like that.

Does recaptcha even do ANYTHING anymore?  (apart from making us all train
Google's machine learning tools... ?). I suspect the rise of chatgpt et al
has made their "protections" meaningless.

Hi Tim,
recently Salvatore Fiandaca spotted a website at 
http://qgis-hub.fast-page.org/ (only http) claiming to be a QGIS Hub for 
collections of free to use QGIS style xml-files and layout qpt-files.
Is it managed by QGIS.org or somebody known? If not, may it have 
something to do with the plugins server issues (someone scraping 
styles/layouts/plugins)?

Regards.

Andrea

Hi Tim,

Can you share more details about this? Do you have a HTTP referrer, IP 
or user-agent or anything else in particular to blame?

Regards,
Julien

Hi all

So our fix proposal is here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/402

I don't think chasing IP addresses is a productive way to deal with it -
you end up playing whack-a-mole. I think our approach should cover most
cases. A really dedicated person could emulate the QGIS user agent but I
think that will be uncommon.

Regards

Tim

I took a look, the site source is here:
https://github.com/style-hub/hub-server

The page is by Klas Karlsson and features only his own work, so
perfectly legitimate. Klas is probably the most prolific contributor the
style hub at
https://plugins.qgis.org/styles/?order_by=-upload_date&&is_gallery=true and
well respected (by me anyway, I am sure the rest of the QGIS community too).

We do have a plan to split the official QGIS resources plugin from the
aforementioned link into its own web site and will try to make it a
beautiful experience, taking hints from Klas' work where needed.

Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Hi everyone!

The official docker image of QGIS (https://github.com/qgis/qgis-docker) states:
There are discussions on how to build these images and they are not considered stable. They are considered as NOT production ready.
I am interested in making the docker image stable, but I have not found a roadmap or a hint to features that are currently missing to make it "production ready".
 So far, I only found this thread: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/221

Could you point me to any other relevant discussions, or could you tell me where I should ask to make this image "ready for production"?

Regards,
Jakob

Message-ID: <67127356-1440-41fe-afe3-a7e9ea380a15@servus.at>

The fantastic Plugin Reloader doesn't reload loaded libraries as 
documented here 
(https://github.com/borysiasty/plugin_reloader/issues/37). So when I 
change code in a library used by a QGIS plugin the only way I know to 
reload this library is to restart QGIS.

To make it clear: I'm not talking about core libraries but python 
libraries shipped with plugins (like Mergin/pygeodiff or GeoCat Bridge/ 
bridge-style)

Is there a more dynamic way to force a python library to reload?

Does Server provide any analysis capabilities or is it just mainly to serve maps (WMS, WFS, etc.)?  I read on the into page that it has plugin capabilities and uses QGIS as the back end.

I have a plugin that I developed for QGIS Desktop and have been asked if we could eventually go completely web based and have the same plugin with some modifications work in a web based environment.  This plugin opens docked widgets, provides drawing capabilities on the map canvas, and performs analysis on layers.

Hi Luke,

check out 3Liz's great Py-QGIS-WPS https://github.com/3liz/py-qgis-wps

If you convert your plugin's analysis part to processing tool(s) it 
should work fine.

Cheers, Hannes

Hello everyone.

Please find below the report on the maintenance and development of QGIS-Django and QGIS-Hugo for the last week:

Migration of the QGIS plugins website:

  *   We have successfully migrated the QGIS plugins website to an updated server. Many thanks to everyone who helped us achieve this.
  *   The QGIS plugins website now uses up-to-date stacks and packages such as Django 4, Postgresql 16, and the latest Metabase.
  *   Please feel free to share your feedback or create issues about them on the QGIS-Django repository

New PRs QGIS-Hugo:

  *   Fix in page anchor scroll<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/237>
  *   Make the download link on top in the installation guide<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/239>

Subject: QGIS Full Stack Web Developer Report
Hello everyone,

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE QGIS PLUGINS WEBSITE: We?ve scheduled the migration to the updated servers into production for 06 May 2024. During this time, uploading new plugins will be disabled and the ability to install plugins may be intermittently unavailable.

I mainly focused on the following tasks this week:

  *   Continue working with the QGIS Plugins Site branding updates<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/392>. It?s based on the changes made for the PR #374<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/374>

  *   Some final checks and fixes on the updated servers:

     *   Fix plugins download feature
     *   Fix all the warning status on the monitoring server

Next week, I will focus on post-migration tasks and maintenance. We will also continue with the branding update for the QGIS plugins website.

Have a great weekend.

Best regards,
Lova

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Build problems using install instructions
 -building branches
Message-ID: <7629584.DuvXaIMf4B@apn53>

Hi,
I've come to this point after finding problems with QGIS using KDE Neon  - library 
problems with the binary and age problems with the flatpack version.

I'm running the latest KDE Neon version which runs on Ubuntu 22.04

I can now build the latest development version, but I need the latest stable version - 3_36 ( 
with the appropriate tag)
I've tried the  procedure for building different branches[1] ( see below) but in spite of 
receiving assistance from list members it hasn't been successful


 git commit
git worktree add ../release-3_36
cd ../release-3_36
git fetch qgis/master
git rebase -i qgis/master
# only keep the commits to be pushed
git push -u QGIS release-3_36

One suggestion was to build 3_36 by a more direct method, but I don't know what that 
entails. Looks like I'm likely to be doing this for a long time so I'd like get a reliable method 
in place.

Any thoughts would be most appreciated.

Tony

Hi,

The procedure at 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL.md#39-building-different-branches 
is more for developers to create feature branches and submit pull requests

To just built the release-3_36 branch,

Assuming that "origin" is your remote pointing to 
https://github.com/qgis/qgis? (if not "git remote add origin 
https://github.com/qgis/qgis", or replace origin by the name of the 
remote that points to https://github.com/qgis/qgis )

from your release-3_36 directory:
git fetch origin release-3_36
git reset --hard origin/release-3_36??? # make sure you have no local 
changes before doing that!

Hi,

These instructions in the INSTALL.md lack a context and are quite 
confusing there IMHO. They should probably go to the developers guide 
(https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/git.html#development-in-branches). 
It is more a git/development tip than a build instructions.

Regards,

Harrissou

Hello devs,

me again, for requesting a fix for the docs, but this time the issue 
also affects the pyQGIS documentation, broken for already two weeks 
(https://github.com/qgis/pyqgis/issues/139 and 
https://github.com/qgis/pyqgis/actions). I suspect the new qgis/QGIS 
docker recipe to be the root cause, maybe a new Python or OS version 
that applies PEP 668; unability to execute pip in a docker as we used 
do. I've tried a number of recipes I found in the Internet, but... I've 
never been comfortable with docker, so failed.

A charitable person to help get fix the docs sites? Or one (I could 
still reproduce the fix on the other)? Thanks.

Regards,

Harrissou.

PS: Thanks Nyall for helping on the previous issue.

Hi Harrissou,

Yes, looking at
https://github.com/qgis/pyqgis/actions/runs/8954239354/job/24593642123#step:3:106

It looks like you are right. Apparently the qgis/qgis container image has been upgraded to a version which does you not let install python packages via pip in the global Python.

Given we probably do want to use that container, we can do 2 things:

- I think/hope we can do that by using  --break-system-packages as pip argument there..

- OR in the qgis/qgis container, remove the file  /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED

- either make sure that we do all the work in a virtual environment (meaning fix: https://github.com/qgis/pyqgis/blob/master/Dockerfile)

I started to add the first solution in the Docker file.

But to make this future proof, we need to go to the third solution...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Gerald,

you may use "from importlib import reload" to reload the packages that 
have been changed.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload

Wos, great!? If this works, it would be a good idea to create a Feature Request to the plugin reloader maybe to incorporate this?

Good Afternoon,

I am currently working on a project that generates a 3D image of a layer. Is it still not possible to generate a 3D polygon through PYQGIS?
I have all the slope values, etc. I have also already made the polygon layers which I want to convert to 3D.
Been looking around and haven't found any solutions that have been able to help me so this is my last resort before I give up.

FYI. I am on version 3.28. This being the case if it is allowed in newer versions I would still wish to know.

Many Thanks.

I would like to report that the MapSwipe Tool plugin, which allows you to
split the View in two (horizontally or vertically) to display two themes,
has not been working for some time.
The error has been corrected by an user but the developer has not yet taken
over the change to integrate it into the code (after months).
there is therefore a fork that has corrected the error.

shouldn't the original be declared as deprecated?

Ciao

Message-ID: <CAJy=Xtd=hiN=y1QS_ybNGDcExusVNxgLEMUiqcJh0MGfPWv4sg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers, I would need your support to update my plugins.

I read that Qt WebEngine, from QGIS

3.36.3-Maidenhead, QT 5.15.3, is available for plugins:
https://changelog.qgis.org/en/entry/2607

But on Ubuntu Jammy LTS 22.04 and a fresh QGIS 3.36.3-Maidenhead with QT
5.15.3, when I try to import from QT5:
from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView, QWebEnginePage,

I get an exception:
ImportError: QtWebEngineWidgets must be imported before a QCoreApplication
instance is created

and when I do the same from python3 in bash I get no exceptions

Where Am I wrong? Is there something different to do for importing
QtWebEngineWidgets ?
Can you point me to a running example?

Thank you very much.

Hi Enrico, have you tried to import early the qwebengine before the other
modules?

Like that example:

from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView, QWebEnginePage
from qgis.PyQt.QtCore import QCoreApplication, QObject
from qgis.PyQt.QtWidgets import QAction
from qgis.core import QgsApplication
from qgis.gui import QgsMapCanvas

class MyPlugin(QObject):
    def __init__(self, iface):
        super().__init__()
        self.iface = iface
        self.web_view = QWebEngineView()
        self.web_view.setPage(QWebEnginePage())
        self.initGui()

I fixed the same problem in this way but I use windows not Linux

Best

Which version of the python webengine library is installed? I suspect
this package is out of date and needs an update.

What exactly are you trying to do? There's many ways this request
could be interpreted.

(Maybe the "drape" tool from the processing toolbox does what you need?)

Message-ID: <18fb8fd6275.51e54eb430628.3144330399375523460@margo.co>

Hello fellow QGIS'ers.

I have a (new to me) problem in my hands.

I am building an interface to run a large transportation simulation model (https://polaris.taps.anl.gov/polaris-studio/index.html) from a QGIS plugin, and I would like to update the interface as the simulation progresses.

The issue here is that this simulation is done inside a compiled C++ executable from which I cannot emit any QT signals, so I have to do it "manually" by processing the logfile generated by the application.

I currently don't see a way to do this, as the calling the simulation processes captures the GIL and I can't update the interface, but is there another way of doing this?



I am at a bit of a loss, so I appreciate any pointers.



Cheers,

Pedro

I'd suggest following the approach used by the GDAL processing algorithms.

You need python qt webengine 5.15.6 for use in qgis. See
https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Downloads/PyQtWebEngine/ChangeLog-5.15.7.dev2405031852

The required change is "Allow Qt.AA_ShareOpenGLContexts to be specified
before a
 QCoreApplication is created to allow PyQtWebEngineWidgets to be
 imported.".

I'd file a bug for your distro and request and update.

Update on this: The flatpak QGIS 3.36.3 with Qt 5.15.10 has no issues. I'll
go with this.
Thank you very much for the support.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Move a Feature Programmatically
Message-ID: <6324934b6c5d46ccb0348e4beda2063e@erdc.dren.mil>

I want to use the Advanced Digitizing Toolbar programmatically through python.

I have a QTableView conating a layer name that references GeoJSON in a database.  When I select the layer and hit a button on my UI, it places the GeoJSON representation of a building footprint at a specified location on the map.  That was just a first cut, reading the GeoJSON and placing it on the map.

I also have code that tracks the mouse cursor in the map canvas. What I want to do is when I hit the place button, I want my layer to appear at my mouse location and have it moving around the map canvas until I click on the mouse to place it as the location I clicked and then end the edit session.

So I am trying to access the Advanced Digitizing Toolbar's Move Feature(s) method so I can have the feature moving until I decide where I want to place it.  Is it possible to utilize that feature of the toolbar through code.

Hi Richard and Julien,


Thanks a lot for sharing the steps to compile QGIS with Qt6 on Debian. I
followed your steps on Ubuntu Noble (24.04) and I've been able to reach
this point that you're mentioning in this thread, namely:

'QgsSpatialIndex::intersects' has an unsupported return type - provide
%MethodCode and a C++ signature
'QgsSpatialIndex::nearestNeighbor' has an unsupported return type - provide
%MethodCode and a C++ signature
'QgsSpatialIndex::nearestNeighbor' has an unsupported return type - provide
%MethodCode and a C++ signature
'QgsAttributeTableView::selectedFeaturesIds' has an unsupported return type
- provide %MethodCode and a C++ signature
ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.

For me, it has worked by bringing back the MethodCode removed at [1] (which
dealt with QList<qint64>). Namely, I copied these lines [2] to
python/PyQt6/core/conversions.sip and built QGIS again.

After doing that, and after installing a couple of missing libs
(pytho3-pyqt6.qtpositioning
and pytho3-pyqt6.qtserialport), QGIS runs with Python bindings enabled on
Qt6.


Julien, could this MethodCode be still needed for particular SIP versions?
Could we bring back this MethodCode to python/PyQt6/core/conversions.sip or
what could be the recommended approach?


Regards,

Germ?n

Hi lists,

I'm looking for some assistance in fixing the right-to-left labeling
issues described in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/54098 . While
I can fix the code issues, I don't have the linguistic understanding
to know how right-to-left text SHOULD behave in QGIS labels!

Is there anyone out there from a RTL language background who can add
the missing information to the above ticket and help get this bug
fixed?

Nyall,

I cannot read a RTL language myself, but we do have some RTL languages as site/documentation translations.

If I remember correct it was actually pretty easy and worked remarkebly good for the site:

See for example: https://qgis.org/fa/site/

All rtl language inclused this css:

https://qgis.org/fa/_static/qgis-style-rtl.css

with only:

body {
     direction: rtl !important;
}


in it.

Not sure if that is possible on other elements though.

Regards, hoping this is helpful :-)

FYI on Debian Sid, I use a commit of Nyall to which he pointed earlier:

https://github.com/nyalldawson/QGIS/commit/c9b8c74d8abbc61f373dafbe94c35f2b8e9fe41d

I do have some Python issues with the dbmanager then though, which I then remove from the build.
The rest is working and I was able to make a plugin work for Qt6.

Not sure if all this 'magic' (to me) is still needed.

Regards,

Richard

Actually, if it works on a given platform, it's by accident and not design
?. There's no tests covering this and I don't think it's been actually
thought out by design.

So my questions related to high level design decisions, like:

- should the switch to rtl layout determined by the content of a label
alone? Or is it determined by the font choice? Or the users locale? Or
should it be an explicit choice set per layer, so that the project will
appear identical when shared with a user using a different locale for their
qgis?
- how should mixed ltr and rtl string work? Should users be required to
manually insert rtl / ltr unicode markers?
- how should rtl be handled with respect to multiline text alignment?
- is rtl placement of characters determined by graphemes? Ie do we split
the string to graphemes and then lay these out right to left? Or is it done
on individual characters?

we need to change the name of owr plugin OpeNoise.
The new name is: OpeNoise Map.
Is it enough to write this e-mail to you or do we have to do something else?
Thank you very mach.

Best regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] debug messages not coming out, why ?
Message-ID: <ZlXm-tuvmnUiQub0@c23>

I'm running cmake with -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG but I don't
see any debug message printed on the console when starting
qgis from build dir, what am I missing ?

The INSTALL.md file says something about debugging but seems
to be only about the server ?

    ## 6.5. Debugging

    ```bash
    sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/wcs_example.com/error.log
    ```

I'm pretty sure it used to work for me, I don't know when it stopped.

Hi German,

If I believe the PR [0] I pushed 4 month ago, QList<qint64> is now
wrapped so there is no need to add it in conversions.sip

If I remember correctly we can't add it back because we would get some
type colliding on other system (fedora for instance). I fail to find exact reason of why we needed it before
and we don't need it now, but I just remember it was the right things to
do.

Anyway, it seems to work on fedora, but there is something wrong on
Debian that would need further investigation.

Regards,
Julien

Uh! I didn't expect "DEBUG" != "Debug" but that was exactly the problem.
Thanks!

Thanks for your insights Micha!

Unfortunately I can't solve this one given my lack of language
knowledge. I'll step aside and let a native RTL language developer
take over. I've introduced some tests in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/57586 which could be a starting
point for someone.

Not user's locale, since a map can contain text in different RTL languages even if the locale LANG setting is Western LTR. Not by layer, since user's can have multiple text attributes with text in different languages in each.  In full featured word processors there is, of course, a button to choose text directionality on a per-paragraph level. But I don't think implementing that is required for map labels.

All the problematic edge cases of (i.e. a period within a string of numbers should be LTR but a period at the end of RTL language string should be assumed to be at the end of the RTL string), are taken care of by that library. I'm pretty sure this was the case with <=3.28.x. I wouldn't expect users to know how to insert RTL unicode. We just switch the keyboard language.

Abdelghani, (unless I misunderstand) could you please share where you found native tools to export 3d map to **gltf** format? I'm having issues with qgis2threejs so if anything native is already there, I'd be happy to give it a try.

Sorry for the confusion my request might have created.
I am quite new to QGIS and have had to do a lot of online research with not much success. (mostly vaguely searching through QGIS Documentation)

The project I am working on is to generate a layer based on given parameters, one of said parameters being the slope of each layer's Z Values.
	(one said layer being stated as a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 ft)
With said slope I wish to make the 2D layers I have already generated appear in a 3D view.

I did some research into the drape tool, and while I do believe it could work my issue is how would I create the raster layer with the Z values?
Since the Z values would depend entirely on the different parameters, it would not be set Z values. 
	(What even is the function to create the raster layer?)

My current thinking is to calculate the Z values based on the slope and starting height of each layer.
How do you think I should go around doing so?

Thanks,

What exactly are you trying to do? There's many ways this request could be interpreted.

(Maybe the "drape" tool from the processing toolbox does what you need?)

Hi devs and  qgis power users,

After investigating I can arg that there's a lack of conflation tools in QGIS like such existing for Esri  :

https://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc17/tech-workshops/tw_513-105.pdf


Is there some plan or something I miss for doing such task in QGIS ?

Thanks

Hi,

Geospatial data conflation is not an easy task, and usually depends on :

- the input data

- desired output

- semantics

- conflation based mainly on semantics( / attribute data ), topology or purely geometric

Note that semantic and topology-based methods are much more robusts than geometry-based ones.

In any case, there is no magic workflow and the method has to be adapted to the specific context.

I contributed to an implementation based on PostGIS quite a long time ago :

https://docplayer.fr/8718145-Appariement-de-graphes-de-reseau-avec-postgis.html ( in french ).

There could be some generic algorithms which could be made available in QGIS processing to ease creation of workflows for conflation ( e.g. node fingerprints, geometry local correspondance search? ).

Get in touch if you are interested in developing some.

Vincent

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] lack of conflation tools

Hi Sylvain, Vincent, everyone.

Geospatial Conflation (as defined in the presentation included) has been my
life's work. In Australia, we call it 'Spatial Upgrades', conflation is to
my understanding just the transfer of attributes from an old theme (e.g.
roads) to a new theme.

The change in coordinates (based on shift vectors) can be done by
algorithms such as Rubber Sheeting, Best Guess (weighted mean averages with
some smarts), Iterative Best Guess (iteratively looking for problems and
adjusting), Least Squares, and is some cases, post processing to apply some
business rules to hold certain geometric shapes fairly constant.

The approach here is to do the Spatial Upgrade, detect where the upgraded
theme does not fit the destination, and either edit the Shift Vectors and
readjust, or carry on with manual edits.

I had an opportunity to rewrite it into a simple Windows Desktop app (from
a client/server (REST)) and consolidate all the good bits into it. It took
2 years including 5 major projects, so maybe 1.5 years of coding and
testing.

I started with QGIS Plugins last October, a lot to learn, but I have a
"Rubber Sheeting" plugin uploaded in the QGIS Repository. Have a look.

I have the issue that I estimate maybe 3-5 years to rebuild from Visual
Basic Desktop to Python Plugin, and am not prepared to do 5 years work for
no income. I would love to make it financially viable somehow, but have yet
to determine how to make it so.

I am also hoping to launch a website soon where you can trial/buy the
Windows Desktop App. Happy to let you know when that happens.

So, all up, I am hoping to claim this space in the QGIS World, but it is a
lot of work even if one knows all about it.

Regards
Roger
