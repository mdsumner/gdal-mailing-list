You need a OGR compiled with Oracle support.

I took a quick look.  I think that allows to browse the database for
geometry tables, select the one you'd like to add and then creates an
URI for the OGR driver and create a vector layer with it.

There's also the ogr plugin branch with also does something like that,
but for more OGR drivers (eg. mysql).

But given a Oracle enabled GDAL and knowing the URI syntax you need to
access the Oracle table/OGR layer you want, you might get away with a
simple plugin that allows to specify an URI and tries to add a vector
layer using it.

Hi,
I've tested postgis manager and it's filling a great hole in the
qgis/postgis tools. Could I sugest that you change from psycopg to python's
qtsql? I've used it in my python-postgis plugin. It comes packaged together
with the current qgis windows version. I think it would be the best choice
for all postgis programmers.
I've made a few tests to list the tables and databases from pg_tables and
pg_database using qtsql and it worked fine. This could be a single step
toward complete compatibility with qgis default features.

Mauricio,

as I don't know how QtSql drivers get packaged on various platforms,
I've been trying to avoid it. But if postgresql driver is included on
all supported platforms, then QtSql sounds like a good alternative. In
fact all calls to database are in just one python file, so porting the
plugin shouldn't need too much effort. I could give it a try.

In meanwhile you can enjoy new release 0.4 with some improvements in
table creation and editation, toolbar with icons (by Robert), import
of aspatial tables from dbf and more goodies :-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] deselecting features - last minute API change?
Message-ID: <200812020141.44259.borys@wolf.most.org.pl>

Hi,
We can freely add vector features to selection (as well with gui as api) but 
can't deselect any feature. It's not a problem for plugins - they can remove 
selection and select again. But the problem is bigger for user who wants to 
select "all except something" or just has selected one bridge too far. I can 
imagine a number of future plugins dependent on manually selected features, 
so the ability of deselecting features is quite important.

The reason is that we haven't any 'QgsVectorLayer::deselect' method. We have 
the following:  

QgsVectorLayer::select (in various variants) 
QgsVectorLayer::invertSelection
QgsVectorLayer::removeSelection

So it seems naturally to add also 'deselect'. Is there any reason for what it 
is not implemented yet? If none, can I implement it before 1.0.0? We can wait 
with gui behaviour changing for 1.0.1, but it would be good to have at least 
the methods ready in the 1.0.0 API.

Regards,
B.

That's really weird. When I try to open it, XML file shows version 0.4
and when I manually download the archive, in __init__.py there's also
version 0.4. I'm wondering what's wrong...

Hi Borys

This change does not affect API compatibility for plugins and 3rd party apps. 
Please go ahead and add the QgsVectorLayer::deselect method to trunk.

>We can

+1, since we are in GUI and string freeze for 1.0

Marco

For me it's clearly 0.4 since yesterday morning. Installer asked me for update 
and has updated smoothly. Maybe you both have any caching problem? Any proxy? 
Btw. do proxy works in the end? :)

Weird behaviour: now it shows as 0.4, but when I upgrade it, it keeps on
saying it's an upradeable plugin.
I have a transparent proxy, no problem with that usually (the problems I
reported were with a proxy with authentication).
All the best.

I don't understand why... Everything works properly at mine. Do you use the

Hi List,

The QgsRasterLayer.identify()[1] returns such dict in Python:

{bandName:value, bandName:value, ...}

where bandName is created in line 1792 and 1836 of qgsrasterlayer.cpp:

      theResults[tr( "Band" ) + QString::number( i )] = v

In Polish locale "Band" is translated to "Kana?", what contains non-ascii 
character. And this character seems to be wrongly encoded. If I load a raster 
layer and call from Python console, say:

      sample = iface.activeLayer().identify(QgsPoint(0,0))[1]

the 'sample' contains the mentioned dictionary. Then if I try to print the 
first key, which should contain QString 'Kana? 1':

      print sample.keys()[0]

I give the error message:

exceptions.UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u0142'

So the string is not properly unicoded. But I can't find any error, neither in 
qgsrasterlayer.cpp nor in qgsrasterlayer.sip file. It's passed from tr() 
directly to QgsRasterLayer::identify() header. Probably I'm missing something 
obvious.

Hi!

Bug in 1.0.0-Kore-preview2:

* Load Shapefile
* Create some action
* Open attribute table
* Call action by right-clicking on a feature

The action is called on the wrong feature. It takes some other feature
from the list.

Hi!

Is there a way to call an action and give it the geometry? Something like:

action.sh %X %Y

or

action.sh %GEOMETRY

or so?

There's nothing wrong with the string. The problem is that print
statement is trying to convert unicode string to 8-bit string to
display it in console. And by default it uses 'ascii' codec which
raises an exception when it encounters a character with value >= 128
(since ascii is just 7-bit encoding). How to simulate it:
>>> u'\u0142'.encode('ascii')
A resolution for your situation is to encode with e.g. utf8 codec or
you can use directly QString's methods toUtf8() or toLocal8Bit().

Happy hacking

I think there's no reason not to have it in 1.0.0. Looking at your
post again I see I've misread it a bit and haven't noticed that you're
actually volunteering to do that :-) Nevermind... it's in trunk,
r9729.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin toolbars and docks state is not being saved
Message-ID: <200812030014.04973.borys@wolf.most.org.pl>

State of plugin toolbars and docks is never being saved. It's annoying, looks 
bad and affects for example:
- GRASS toolbar placement
- order of plugin docks groupped as tabs
- GetCoordinates visibility when the dock is floating
- Value Tool visibility at all

It's because all plugins are being unloaded before seving main window state 
(qgisapp.cpp, line 1742):

void QgisApp::saveWindowState()
{
  QgsPluginRegistry::instance()->unloadAll();
  QSettings settings;
  settings.setValue( "/UI/state", this->saveState() );
 
Is there any reason for unloading them before saving the state? If not, I 
would swap te sequence. At mine everything works fine, even if I'm trying to 
confuse QGIS by removing plugins before next start.

Thanks! Now it works. 
Qgis Python Console just seems to work in other encoding so its behaviour is 
other than system python (and also ipython). But I'll investigate it later, 
thanks again!

Message-ID: <20081203075317.GB24794@eldorado.topf.org>

This is with qgis 1.0.0-Kore-preview2:

* Open "Add PostGIS layer" dialogue
* Connect to some database

If you now double click on a table the SQL dialogue opens, you add
something there and close the dialogue. You table is selected, everything
is ok.

But now you decide that you want to change the sql statement, you double
click the table again, the dialogue opens, you edit it and close it.

Now your table is not selected any more. You have to find it again and
select it before you close the "Add PostGIS layer" dialogue.

So the problem here is that the first click of a double click in the
"Add PostGIS layer" dialogue changes the select status of a table just
like a normal click would.

I think the behaviour should be different: Double click should open the
SQL dialogue and after closing it the table should *always* be selected.
Because thats what you want almost all the time. (Why would you bother
adding an SQL WHERE clause when you don't want to import the table as a
new layer.)

also: it is not obvious that you can open the SQL dialogue with a double
click. I think there should be another way to open the dialogue, the
double click should only be a shortcut.

also: can we do something about the default width of the columns in the
"Add PostGIS layer" dialogue? My table names tend to be wider than would
fit and "Geometry column" is smaller normally. Do we need the icons and
the text in the "Type" column? Maybe the columns could widen themselves
automatically according to the content?

Hi developpers,
Ok, I have no idea how to really update the extents in a shapefile. Is
QgsVectorDataProvider::updateExtents() working properly?
It's still unknown to me if by editing features using addFeatures() and
updateFeatureGeometry() I must be in startEditing().
Nonetheless I tryed the startEditing(), changeGeometryValues(),
updateExtents(), commitChanges() and it was no different than when I used
changeGeometryValues() alone.
How is the best way to change gemetries inside a QgsVectorLayer?
Thanks in advance,
Maur?cio de Paulo

Message-ID: <4937A999.3060206@sarvision.nl>

Hi,

I'm using (and testing) gqis from svn trunk, and I think I've found a 
bug with the overview map. If I switch on a vector (point) layer in the 
legend which has a larger extent than the overview map currently shows, 
but which has not been added to the overview, the overview map still 
zooms out to the extent of that point layer. Imho this is a bug, but to 
be sure: is this intended?

Regards,
Vincent.

I think normally you shouldn't need to call updateExtents() explicitly.

if you use QgsVectorDataProvider, everytime an editing function is
called, the change is immediately written to storage.

But editing functions of QgsVectorLayer are used this way:
1. startEditing() is called
2. editing functions (add feature / delete feature / modify geometry /
modify attributes) are called, the changes are stored temporarily in
QgsVectorLayer structures
3. rollback() or commitChanges() is called meaning that all changes
are either commited to QgsVectorDataProvider or rolled back (i.e. not
applied).

> How is the best way to change gemetries inside a QgsVectorLayer?

It's up to you which mode suits better to you. If you want to modify a
layer just temporarily giving the user possibility to apply/revert the
changes, using QgsVectorLayer might be better. Otherwise I would use
directly QgsVectorDataProvider to change geometry as this avoids
overhead in QgsVectorLayer that is caching the editations.

Hope that helps,

Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] API Freeze, String Freeze from tomorrow
Message-ID: <1228425888.7182.8.camel@timbuntu64>

Hi Folks

If we are going to get QGIS 1.0 out by end of December we need to start
the release process rolling. I propose the following:

 - string freeze (refreeze really) and call for translations will go out
tomorrow night
 - API freeze commencing tomorrow
 - Call for plugin ports to 1.0 commencing tomorrow
 - Start working through the 1.0 release checklist aiming for complete
freeze and call for packaging around 20 Dec.

Please take a look at the unit tests and get them passing again if they
cover an area of code you are familiar with.

There seems to be no active work on labelling and its something I haven
got time for myself. I would like to suggest we leave this for 1.1. PSC
you happy with that?

I know there are still many issues that we need to fix, but at some
point we need to draw a line in the sand and put what we have out there.
Work will continue in 1.0.x to stabilise and bugfix this release.

If anyone is not happy with the above proposals, please discuss (and
provide suggestions for alternative arrangements).

Best regards

So we have 24h left, haven't we? It's good for me for final Installer 
polishing.

>  - API freeze commencing tomorrow

There's one method in my mind. In addition to three existing methods of 
QgsVectorLayer: select(), invertSelection() and Martin's deselect(), I'd like 
to add also invertSelectionInRectangle() and point QgsMapToolSelect to this 
method if Ctrl key pressed. Now it's pointed always to select(), so 
deselecting features is impossible. 

I know we are in gui freeze, but it shouldn't affect User Guide and would be a 
small but useful enchancement. Unfortunatelly I'm busy tomorrow, but if 
somebody would like to implement this and everybody agree to do it before 
1.0.0 it would be great.

Regards,
B.

I was hoping to get something going on this in the next few days, but  
if left to do it all by myself it likely won't get done before the end  
of the month.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to stopediting/rollback in a plugin before
	changing the project-file
Message-ID: <20848621.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi everybody,

I'm working on a plugin in which the user is editing a database-layer.
So I'm loading automatically a project with all the necessary layers.
The layer to be edited is already switched editable.
When the user closes the plugin the changes in the edited layer are saved
automatically.
You see we are doing everything for our users :-)
But now my problem. If the user clicks by mistake the "load new Project"
button and then doesn't save the project (I know this is not very supposable
:thinking:) I want to rollback the edited layer or save the changes.
But how to do this? The only possibility I found is to listen on the
triggered() SIGNAL of the actionNewProject().

QObject.connect(self.iface.actionNewProject(),SIGNAL("triggered(bool)"),self.deleteRubberBand)

# Entfernt das RubberBand
  def deleteRubberBand(self,rubberLayer="default"):
    if (rubberLayer == False): # The triggered Signal sents False
      self.layer.rollBack() #This is the layer I want to save/rollback
    for value in self.mRubberBand:
      value.reset()

But when the signal was sent, it is to late, my QgsVectorLayer doesn't exist
anymore.
So how can I save/rollback the edited layer before everything is deleted?
Maybe there is sth like a closeProject Signal respectively what happens when
the user clicks the discard button in the "save the current project" dialog?

I hope you understand what I want to do
Any hints would be great.

Best regards

Michael

Let's freeze, release ASAP and concentrate on bugfixing (we got very

Message-ID: <d8ad40b50812050413h4a1ad63k77fddc0e4250a912@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using Qgis Preview 2 on Ubuntu, and if I try and start a grass
module I get an error popup: "Cannot find key r". Then the module
dialog tab appears but with the 'Options' tab just having a tiny
scroll area with no controls in it at all.

 Then when I close that, it all seg faults and dies.

The Qgis is 1.0preview17~hardy1 from the launchpad repository.

 I also have Grass installed from the ubuntu repositories. I've taken
all my plugins out in case any of them were causing it, but they're
not. I've rebooted.

 Any ideas?

What about using layerWillBeRemoved signal from QgsMapLayerRegistry?

Hi Martin,

thanks for your answer. I've already tried layerWillBeRemoved.
But it seems that after clicking the Discard-Button SIGNAL removedAll() is
sent by QgsMapLayerRegistry.
And after this signal all layers in the QgsMapLayerRegistry have been
deleted. layerWillBeRemoved works very good when I delete one layer but when
changing the project removedAll() is sent and I get the following error: 
RuntimeError: underlying C/C++ object has been deleted

Any other hints?

Best regards

Michael

Ok, this looks like a bug to me.
In r9743 there is a change such that layerWillBeRemoved is also sent from 
QgsMapLayerRegistry::removeAllMapLayers()

 All of them! Well, nearly. None of them give me the dialog that lets
me set parameters.

 If I try r.resamp.stats I get an error 'cannot find module
r.resamp.stats'. Some modules give me errors like that, and some dont.
v.generalize just gave me 'cannot find module v.generalize'  but
v.db.what.connect just gives me an empty dialog...

Thanks for the help Marco.
Seems to be better now. When opening a new project layerWillBeRemoved is
sent now.
But there are still some problems and a few new problems.
The new problems:
- Now there is no dialog anymore when trying to open a new project
- there is a qgis warning in the console saying Warning:
QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName: No matching signal for
on_mActionMoveItemsToBottom() 
I don't know if this depends on the changes you made.

the remaining problems:
- I can call the layer after listening to the SIGNAL now. For example the
method name gives back the correct name of the layer correct.
But I can't do rollBack or commitChanges. They give back False and the
Editing tools are still active in the toolbar thus there is no layer in the
new project.

regards,

Michael

You mean the dialog that askes if the old project should be saved? I tested it 
here and the dialog still shows up

No, it relates to the print composer. Nevertheless, good to know about it.

Strange that rollBack and commitChanges don't work.

The editing tools are not deactivated by calling QgsVectorLayer::rollBack and 
commitChanges. You need to do that from within your plugin. Because 
QgsVectorLayer is a non-gui class. It does not know about the buttons.

Marco

I will have a look at this again. I just tested what rollBack/commitChanges
says but not what is happening in the database.

Building with MSVC works nicely.  I'm still using Qt 4.3, but I think Qt
4.4 shouldn't be a problem.

The plugin icons live under src/plugins/foo (each plugin manages its own
icon). 'Core' plugins are all those that exist in the afore mentioned
plugins directory. These plugins are shipped as default with QGIS so it
would be great to have them consistent with the rest of QGIS.

Currently the plugin subdirs dont support theming properly - I will work
to resolve this over the weekend.

Regarding the theme name I would prefer to call it 'gis' not 'gis-1' as
it will be version controlled under svn - you can submit improvements as
and when you make them and we will update the icon set accordingly.

I really like the GPS icon! And the other refinements e.g. clipboard and
zoom tool handle colours look great.

I guess if there was a last thing I would suggest is that for me the
move feature and move vertex icons still look out of place. The
rightwards pointing arrow for me doesnt suggest anything about what the
tool does.

Best regards

Thank for route .. for blind :).
I will try to do it.

Please, go ahead and change it as needed. I have no experience in naming 
conventions.

My main intention was to make icon for 'move' as action part.
And because of that it must be small and simple.
But maybe this is wrong way...
I will think about it and propose some alternatives.

AFAIR because it was not supported in OGR, until recently. About a month
ago however the functionality was added to OGR [1] and is included in
the upcoming GDAL 1.6 release. Will QGIS table editor be extended in
this regard?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgsAffine bugfix?
Message-ID: <200812062338.15211.mauricio.dev@gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
I've made an attempt to fix the bug with the extents. I changed the provider's 
update to the vector layer update using :

QgsVectorLayer.startEditing()
QgsVectorLayer.moveVertex()
QgsVectorLayer.commitChanges()

The problem is: startEditing() isn't working well from my script. But it works 
from the console. Now the user has to start editing by his own before 
applying the affine transformation.

I think qgis still thinks the geometries are unchanged for extents purpose, 
but when I reopen the file it looks ok. I think I've ran into this kind of 
bug when editing too, so I don't know if it's my script's mistake or QGis'. 
I've been able to reproduce it by editing any polygon in a newly created 
layer. It's always with the wrong extent.

I've found a bug that when I call commitChanges(): the "Toggle Editing" button 
looks like it's stiil editing, but it's not. I have to click the button again 
and it starts working fine.

Are these new bugs or am I running into known issues? I can probably reproduce 
the commitChanges() bug in a smaller script.

Afaik this is a 'feature' the canvas always renders to the full combined
extents of of all layers, regardless of which layers are rendered on the
overview.

Message-ID: <20081207133328.GA3640@eldorado.topf.org>

In QGIS 1.0.0-Kore-preview2:

For WMS-Requests qgis sends the full URL in the HTTP GET instead of only
the path component. So it sends:

GET http://hostname/path/to/wms?SERVICE=WMS&... HTTP/1.1

instead of

GET /path/to/wms?SERVICE=WMS&... HTTP/1.1

This is against the HTTP spec. In some cases this might work anyway,
because Apache seems to swallow it.

Another problem now. 0.2 is not wide enough when neither "Fix
problems..." nor "Make lines appear less jagged..." are set in rendering
options. For 0.2 outline there are gaps in lines - see the ticket [1]
and screendumps attached to it.

A minimum outline width at which the issue is gone in all cases that I
checked is 0.26. Is this a feature or a bug? If a feature, I think QGIS
should default to 0.26 for a workaround.

So are we frozen or not yet? 

Finally I've implemented deselecting previously selected features by Select 
Tool. Please consider to apply this patch before 1.0.0. It's very little 
change which doesn't break anything and just makes the select tool working as 
expected. The patch includes only two changes:

- adding new method QgsVectorLayer::invertSelectionInRectangle()
- pointing the QgsMapToolSelect to this method when Ctrl key pressed

Not that my vote counts for a whole lot, but I'd like to see this 
functionality included.
It would really streamline exploratory analysis etc.

Then might I suggest making this feature configureable (after 1.0 of
course)? I understand the feature, but in some use cases the current
behaviour can be very annoying. Let me give an example:

I'm currently working on some vector editing stuff in Borneo, which is
one of the larger Indonesian islands. For that, I use lots of extra
informational layers, both raster and vector. Some of these span a
larger extent than just Borneo, like administrative boundaries
(Indonesia) or fire hotspots (entire South-East asia). Which means, that
once I switch on e.g. the fire hotspots, my overview map zooms out to an
area as large as entire south-east asia, and Borneo becomes just a
little tiny island in a large grey sea on the overview map. This renders
the overview map virtually useless, because I'd like to see where I am
zoomed to on Borneo. However, when Borneo becomes a mere couple of
pixels with a small red square on it, it really doesn't give me any
useful information of where I exactly am inside Borneo.

Vincent.

In-Reply-To: <20081203075317.GB24794@eldorado.topf.org>
References: <20081203075317.GB24794@eldorado.topf.org>
Message-ID: <493D1AA6.1050106@oxfordarch.co.uk>

Dear list,

looking at the current state of the GRASS plugin
in Preview II, "Kore", I found that it is now possible
to use GRASS modules that take multiple input maps.
This is good news. However, there is a small glitch here.

E.g.: open the "r.patch" module dialog. You will see the
"Type in map names .." field, which works just fine.
But the "[...]" browse button takes the user to a
"Save As" dialog, which is completely dysfunctional in
this context. What it should open is a widget that
allows users to select one or more maps in the current
GRASS mapset.

If that is too much work to go into QGIS 1.0.0, I'd
suggest getting rid of that button altogether. It
will be a little inconvenient for the user having
to manually type in map names, but still better
than popping up a misleading dialog.

Cheers,

Ben

Message-ID: <493D1A0F.9080204@lgge.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr>


Hi,

I got seg fault when loading some raster images with the trunk version.
It's not due to the raster itself because if A.tif causes a seg fault at 
loading, copying A.tif into B.tif and loading B.tif with qgis works 
fine. It seems qgis records something about the filename of the loaded 
raster and that causes the crash.
I tried to remove ~/.qgis but the problem persists.

It's quite hard to track further this bug.

Do you have a .qml file for A.tif and not for B.tif?  Or a qmldb-File
in your project directory?   Try to remove (or rename) them an see if
the problem persists.

What does it mean that startEditing() isn't working?

Sorry I didn't get when does this happen... you mean that extent is
not updated after calls to moveVertex() ?

This is because QGIS user interface doesn't get updated automatically
(although it probably should). I think you can work this around by
setting a new connection:
QObject.connect( ??, SIGNAL("editingChanged(QgsMapLayer*)"),
iface.mainWindow(), SLOT("activateDeactivateLayerRelatedActions(
QgsMapLayer*)"))
Replace the questionmarks with your own class where you're going to
emit that editingChanged signal. It will look like this:
layer.commitChanges()
self.emit(SIGNAL("editingChanged(QgsMapLayer*)"), layer)

I have not tried the code so probably it's not a copy/paste example.
The important thing is that you want call that
"activateDeactivateLayerRelatedActions" slot of QgisApp that takes
care of updating UI if the layer is active.

Probably you're just touching less explored things in QGIS API that
has been used by QGIS application only, so probably the semantics of
some functions isn't like what you would expect...

The 2009 Toronto Code Sprint is now set for March 7-10 at the Bond
Place Hotel in Toronto, Canada.

  http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Toronto_Code_Sprint_2009

We hope you will consider joining us for a worthy weekend of sprinting
and getting connected.

We are now looking for sponsors to cover venue and lunches during the
sprint. If your organization wants to curry favor with a couple dozen
influential geospatial programmers, this is a great chance. We are
looking for just four sponsors at $500 each, please get in touch with
me if you are interested in sponsoring this event.

Message-ID: <d8ad40b50812090740tb592e41rff0f291e46d70328@mail.gmail.com>

I'm just writing some code to muck about with plugin repositories and
I figured I'd download every plugin from the four main repos to see
how they are. I found a few plugins still import their main code from
their __init__.py and so can't be imported (easily) from outside Qgis.

Just to expound, instead of having:

from myplugin import myPlugin
def classFactory(iface):
  return myPlugin(iface)

it's better to have:

def classFactory(iface):
  from myplugin import myPlugin
  return myPlugin(iface)

 then code can import the plugin and get the version() methods and so
on, without needing to handle anything the plugin imports.

 The plugins that currently don't do this are:

newlayer
geocode
profiletool
scattergram

 I might wrote some kind of plugin quality control tester to check for
this. I'll also make it check that __init__.py supports the required
methods, but at the moment I'm not sure what the complete set of
required methods is...

 Eventually (as I think Tim may have said before) this information
ought to go in a config file rather than code. My plugins in SVN are
currently adopting both approaches, by having a config file that is
read by the code:

http://code.google.com/p/bsrplugins/source/browse/trunk/clickfu/__init__.py
http://code.google.com/p/bsrplugins/source/browse/trunk/clickfu/config.ini

 The ini file is read by python standard library calls. If we decide
to go this way, then all config info would go into the ini file, and
the plugin module would never need to be imported by anything except
Qgis...

 Okay that's enough from me...

Hi J?rgen:

I have compiled qgis with visual studio and qt 4.4 and
it works nice. The install document says that grass and
python are not supported. Do you know what are the
problems to compile grass and python support?

Regards

As far as I know, the required methods are :

name
description
version
qgisMinimumVersion
classFactory

Borys probably knows better than anyone though...

This is a very nice idea, as it is also infinitely safer for the user in 
the end as well. If the config file doesn't add up, no code is imported, 
and no harm done ;-)
I assume you are thinking this might be a nice way to move towards an 
R-like way of standardizing plugis, which ties in nicely with the 
quality control testing you were suggesting above. I think this is a 
great idea, and will likely give users more confidence in adding third 
party plugins, and keep plugin developers honest ;-)

Nice work Barry, perhaps py-QGIS meeting on IRC is in order sometime in 
the near future?

That's my two (euro) cents,

No, works here.  Python shouldn't be a problem, but for GRASS you need
to link with the mingw built libraries/dlls.

Actually startEditing() doesn't do much. Basically it just sets
editing flag in vector layer to true and then emits editingStarted()
signal.

Looking at QgsVectorLayer::updateExtents() I see there's a bug - it
simply ignores changed geometries...

Hum... and what about those "the name must be the same" that came with 
plugininstaller new version?
Until now I didn't understand exactly what must be with the same name.
I thought about python plugins template (or a new plugin script) to standarize 
as it happens with c++. It could help with the plugin installer standards.

 QGIS 1.0 Feature Freeze, API Freeze, String freeze, Branch for
 release on Sunday 14
Message-ID: <1228858864.6360.32.camel@timbuntu64>

Hi All

Unless there are any objections I would like API freeze, string freeze
effective immediately. I'e only bug fixes into trunk until 14th.

I would like to branch for release on Sunday 14th. The 1.0 branch will
be maintained for a long period (at least 1 year) and further bug fix
releases  will be made following 1.0 release off that branch.

Over the weekend I will start working through the final release
checklist and getting things ready for release.

Best regards

Folks,

I noticed a few changes in the API since metis version.

This sample code used to work perfectly on 0.9 and 0.10 versions, but i now
experiments funny behaviour under metis:

uri = "driftx.csv?delimiter=%s&xField=%s&yField=%s" % (";", "longitude",
"latitude")
vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri, "vectorial plume", "delimitedtext")
QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsShapefile(vlayer, "vectorial_plume.shp",
"CP1360")
r=QgsContinuousColorRenderer(vlayer.vectorType())
r.smin=QgsSymbol(vlayer.vectorType(), "0","","")
r.smax=QgsSymbol(vlayer.vectorType(), "1","","")
r.smin.setPen(QPen(Qt.green, 1.0))
r.smax.setPen(QPen(Qt.red, 1.0))
r.setMinimumSymbol(r.smin)
r.setMaximumSymbol(r.smax)
r.setClassificationField(3)
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)
vlayer.setRenderer(r)

The vector layer is created and loaded on canvas, but
QgsContinuousColorRenderer isn't applied at once
i mean it seems i must redraw the symbology once the layer's loaded, but
can't manage to do it...
i noticed QgsContinuousColorRenderer has become QgsContinuousColRenderer in
the API, but this doesn't work in python.

I also got similar problems for raster creation using vrt
(no raster created, no symbology applied...)

Any ideas ?

Thanks

Piko

piko,

You'll have to update your python code unfortunately :-(

Check out this for a list of changes:

or read through some previous mailing list threads which also discuss 
some of these changes.

No I don't think so, it should still be QgsContinuousColorRenderer...

But those are Metis -> Kore changes AFAIK. Yes, Metis API has been a bit 
changed, but the the lion's share of the changes was performed after Metis.
Only one idea I have to reconstruct Metis API is to download Metis sources and 
look into cpp & sip files:
	
http://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-0_11_0/

and probably also this one:
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/

Btw. I see only QgsContinuousColorRenderer in 1.0.0 API (both c++ and 
python) - no "ColRenderer".

I've written some methods to work with layers' names. I found the usefull and

 I'd like to make a plugin of widely-useful python functions like this
for other plugins to use, called 'qutils'. But my worry is that then
we'd be defining our own API, and people would have to keep upgrading
their qutils plugin... It might get messy.

 You can rewrite that more 'pythonically' as a one-liner:

def listLayers(layertype):
 return [z.name() for z in
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers().values() if z.type() ==
layertype]

 Neat eh? Also, it doesn't need 'self' unless it's a class method.

 Qgis layer names aren't unique, so your code will get the first layer
with that name. I think (someone prove me wrong) the only unique way
of identifying a layer in Qgis is with the layer object itself. That
does mean that drop-down selection boxes can't rely on looking up text
names to find the right layer, and need to store the layer object
too.... Anyway, this can also be a pythonic one-liner that returns all
layers with that name:

def getLayerByName(name):
 return [str(z.name()) for z in
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers().values() if z.name() ==
name]

Okay, sometimes one-liners aren't better but I thought you might like
to see how python "list comprehensions" work - once you start using
them you'll use them everywhere!

But yes, I agree we should try and sort out some common python
functionality into a plugin!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] geoprocessor object
Message-ID: <200812101725.55732.mauricio.dev@gmail.com>

Hi developers,
I was reading about python in ArcGIS and I found they use a geoprocessor class 
as a parent to every python geoprocessing script. This helps to set standards 
of input and output and makes it possible to write standard gui's based on 
the types of each input and output. 
I know we now have a good amount of plugins being written and I've been 
thinking about how they could work better together. With inputs and outputs 
standarized the processes can be linked like FME and ArcGIS' model builder.
Is there any plan inside qgis project to take this kind of step? 
I know it's more a matter of patterns than of implementation. 
I'd be glad to hear what you guys think about it.

It would be much better to put these utility functions/classes
directly to QGIS libs and wrapped in PyQGIS. There are several reasons
for this:
1. no need to install/update more plugins (and btw. with current
implementation it's not possible to interact between plugins)
2. also QGIS C++ code or 3rd party C++ devs could use this functionality
3. slightly faster implementation (not that important)

Barry is right, there might be more layers with the same name. You can
also simply change layer's name with QgsMapLayer::setLayerName
function. But another unique way of identifying layers (apart from
object itself) is by layer ID - returned by QgsMapLayer::getLayerID()
- these text strings serve as identifiers also in map layer registry.

As I've stated above, I would be happier if such common functionality
would be in libs...
May I suggest you to put ideas for new functionality e.g. to wiki?

I've actually created something similar for QGIS, though I've not made 
it available yet. Basically it's a python module that users can import 
via the python console. It has a (very) simple api so that, in theory, 
it could be linked to a geoprocessing gui, and the various geoprocessing 
functions could be linked together (as in a model building environment).

Currently, plugins "can't" work together, but generic modules "can"...

If people are interested, perhaps someone would like to have a look at

 Really? I'm pretty sure I have a plugin that imports from another
plugin... It's just a module.

 The problem here is I reckon there are 10 python developers for every
one C++ developer. These things will get done in Python (exhibit A:
OP), but not done in C++.

 Woo! So I was wrong as well :)

 Yes it would be nicer, and making you happier is a good thing. But do

 Along with all the other suggestions I've had? I'll see if I have time!

Oh yes, that's true. I meant that there's no support to access other
plugin's "live" instance - but if the plugin would consist of only a
bunch of simple functions/classes that shouldn't be a problem.

Maybe true... But in fact all that stands and falls on some authority
(one dev at least) that takes care of the library. But I see your
point.

In following months I will as I have to devote quite some time to our
mapping project which is closely related to QGIS. But probably the
best way would be to leave the code evolve as a python plugin and
eventually pull the most insteresting stuff back to QGIS API.

Hi gang,

Besides the outdated:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DevelopingPlugins

are there any tutorials for writing c++ plugins for QGIS. Normally I'd 
just write one in python, but a colleague of mine has just gotten into 
QGIS, and he is a c++ programmer, so c++ it is...

Any suggestions?

there will be a section in the new manual. It is a workshop from Marco, to write
a vertice2point converter. He updated it last week, so it works with current
QGIS version.

It is in the documentation trunk: 
https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/docs/trunk/english_us/user_guide

or I can send you a PDF version of that section if you like.

 Otto

	(unstable)
Message-ID: <20081211153816.GN57978@keybit.net>

qgis_unstable branch: when adding postgis layer,
I always get a popup saying: "No accessible tables found".

Despite the message, tables *are* found (are shown in the window
for selection, is detected the contained geometry type and found
all attributes).

On 'Add', a second popup complains about a missing unique
index, which is fine.

When adding the missing unique index, everything works, no
popup on 'Add', but still the initial "No accessible tables found"
popup on connect is shown.

No, no record in geometry_columns. But that annoying popup doesn't
mention 'geometry_columns' at all, which would be nice if that's
the problem.

Beside, display of the table records work fine, so I wonder
what justifies the initial scary popup.

I assume you mean they are not stretched. Open the raster properties 
window, look at the contrast enhancement option in the lower right and 
check your default enhancement behavior.

You can set your default enhancement behavior, by selecting a contrast 
enhancement and then clicking the disk icon, that behavior will be 
persistent between qgis sessions.

let me know if you have any other questions.

Marco,

I wanted to find out about a couple things with the composer work you  
are doing (great work, by the way).

In trunk, the major issue that I see related to the quality of  
finished maps is a scaling problem in the legend. If I have a fill  
pattern, such as cross-hatching, the pattern renders correctly in the  
main map, but in the legend it is pixelated and zoomed in considerably.

Here is an example of the issue:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/67875808@N00/3100517757/

This is on OS X, latest trunk, etc.

On another note, I checked out your advanced_printing_branch2, but my  
build fails with:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] delete feature
Message-ID: <1229083358389-1647480.post@n2.nabble.com>


hi devs

I need to create a vectorial layer with only one point feature in it, from
the x/y values of a click event
I use the 'memory' as suggested in tutorial

This is my code:

sprayerProvider = self.sprayerLayer.dataProvider()
sprayerProvider.addAttributes( { "name" : "string" } )

if self.sprayerLayer.featureCount() ==1:
   sprayerProvider.deleteFeatures([0])
   self.canvas.refresh()
			
add a feature
fet = QgsFeature()
fet.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(p.x(),p.y())))
fet.setAttributeMap( { 0 : QVariant("sprayer")} )
sprayerProvider.addFeatures( [ fet ] )

self.sprayerLayer.updateExtents()
		
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(self.sprayerLayer)


So the feature is created and the layer added,
but i want to delete and replace the feature each time the user click
i guess my deleteFeatures doesn't work, because each click creates a new
feature in the layer

Any ideas anyone ?

Thanks

Instead of deleting the feature and creating a new one, why don't you 
just change the geometry of the current feature?

Or, failing that, use deleteFeature() from QgsVectorLayer instead of the 
provider...

Hi Marco & Markus

What is the plan regarding which version of GRASS will be packaged with
QGIS 1.0? Last I spoke to you I think you suggested we should ship
6.4rcX - can you specify which GRASS version will be used?

Thanks

the release candidate becomes pressing now.
Or QGIS 1.0 (Windows, MacOSX) will be shipped with 6.3.0 which I
would pretty much dislike.

We need at least a release candidate.
This means that we need to create the release branch.
Now :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 1.0 Branched - please read to prepare for
	1.0.0 release!
Message-ID: <d368056f0812142257h1cbfbfafx4ea8c32f9a78f197@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks


My apologies this email is rather long, but please take a read through
and see if there is anything you can help with in terms of getting the
release out.

The march to 1.0 goes on. This morning I have branched QGIS 1.0.

Because this is going to be a release that is maintained for a long
time (at least 1 year), I'm doing things a little differently naming
convention wise. The branch for version 1.0.x may be checked out at:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Version-1_0

The revision number of this branch is r9801.

On Saturday 20 December I will tag this branch as Release-1_0_0 and
put out a call for packaging based on that tag. Source bundle will
also be based on that tag. Based on this timeline I will have the
packages linked / uploaded to http://download.qgis.org for a release
announcement around the 26 or 27 Dec (note I will be offline from
21-26 Dec).

For the release the following items need to be addressed - it would be
great if one of these is in your ability to do something about you can
have a look:

Translation of changelog:
-------------------------

I added the changelog to the about box etc. over the weekend.
Unfortunately this will mean a few untranslated strings. If you are a
translator and are able, it would be great to have these translated
during this week. Please forward your .ts files to the community-team
folks as usual.

Sponsors:
-------------

We need to ensure any new sponsors have been added to SPONSORS in src.
If you are a sponsor of QGIS, please contact use if your name is not
mentioned in the help->about box and you would like it to be. Paolo
can you follow up this item and check it off on the release checklist
when you are done?

Pending patches:
-----------------

If you have a patch pending that you feel should be in QGIS 1.0.0 and
it hasn't made it, please contact Marco and ask him to evaluate it for
inclusion into the release. Marco, can you apply any pending patches
or mark them for a future release in the tracker, then check off the
related item in the release checklist with your colour next to it?


Visual changelog:
-----------------

Release team I have written up the visual changelog page but I need to
have this reviewed by you (and anyone else interested), screenshots
made, and any press release ready material made. Richard / Anne /
Maning are you able to take a look please?

Gary could you add that 'message from the project chair' to the front
of the changelog as discussed on IRC?

Web properties:
---------------

Otto are we set for the test site to go live? If there is time it
would be nice to get a web css guru to theme the download.qgis.org
page to match the new qgis web site and send Gary the css etc
(assumming Gary is willing and able to apply that). The new QGIS
community maps stuff is nearly finished, Carson and I will put the
finishing touches to it during the course of this week.

Documentation:
--------------

Otto, how are things looking in terms of getting the docs ready for
end of December? It would be great to have them available with the
release. I see you have been working away on them based on the svn
commits coming in - is there anything the doc team needs that we can
help with?

Unit Tests:
-------------
I spent a bit of time last night trying to get all the tests to pass.
Currently under Linux 2 tests still fail:

80% tests passed, 2 tests failed out of 10

The following tests FAILED:
	  3 - regression992 (Failed)
	  8 - qgis_rendererstest (Failed)

I believe test 3 - regression992 is rooted in a GDAL issue and may not
be solvable in time for the release.

The tests for QGIS renderers still need some looking at, and I am
unsure if the raster qgis_contrastenhancementtest is running properly
- it would be great if we could have at least 9/10 tests passing for
the release.


------------------------

I don't know about you all, but I am really looking forward to seeing
QGIS 1.0.0 come out - its a huge milestone for the project!

best regards

Dear friends,

> would pretty much dislike.

Today I started to work on the new MinGW environment for both GRASS and 
QGIS.
>From today I'll abandon GRASS 6.3.0 building, moving my attention to 6.4 and 
7.
I decided to split the GRASS builds into:

- Official WinGRASS (itself splitted into: 6.4-RCs, 6.4-dev and 7-dev, both 
based on trunk)
- GRASS for QGIS

also because of many other dependencies, such as Tcl/Tk and wxWidgets, that 
are not needed in the QGIS GRASS Plugin.

There are many items in my To-Do list, and the chaotic and confused 
situation of the current MinGW project could take a lot of time before to 
fix them all.
This said (sorry for the long preamble), I can imagine the following 
scenario, based on the fact that the QGIS 1.0 call for packaging is set on 
12/20:

A. ship qgis with grass-6.3.0, planning future package upgrades with the 
6.4-RCs
B. ship qgis with 6.4-RC1, even if a RC1 branch before 12/20 would not mean 
that I'll be able to compile a working set (of both QGIS and GRASS 6.4-RC1) 
in time for the release.

Just my 2 cents :)

Regards,

MP

Hi J?rgen,

> Did you try to build GRASS for OSGEO4W yet?

No, not yet. I just started my PhD, so I'm "awakening" right now from a long 
break in GIS developing.
Some time ago I asked Frank to set up a To-Do list on 
http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/pkg-grass (or just a basic list, to be 
completed by the team, that is Frank, you and me)
This would be very helpful to me to do the job, because I don't have the 
things clear now on what to do, what is missing, not working... and so on.

Because of the curren dead lines (I mean 1.0 call for packaging set on 
12/20) I'll focus my GIS-available-time on the standard MinGW build.
The OSGEO4W job will follow.

Regards,

Marco

BTW: w still have problem relative to the inclusion of proprietary
drivers (especially ECW and MsSID). I tried investigating the issue, but
things seem muddled at best. It is unclear whether eg gvSIG has obtained
a licence to redistribute them (they might have done so, perhaps even
paying for it). I think we should avoid legal issues, but on the other
hand I think not having those drivers is a major issue for many users.
Any hints on how to proceed?
All the best.

Message-ID: <1229352212096-1658484.post@n2.nabble.com>


Folks

in one of my plugin , i create a layer, add it to canvas and then need to
remove it both from canvas and from layer registry, with this code:

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayer(self.sprayerLayer.getLayerID())

The layer is deleted from canvas but not from the layer registry.
Do you know why ?

Is there another way to update the registry ?

Thanks by advance

PIko

There are only 3 things left: 

a) sponsoring page (http://qgis.osgeo.org/sponsoring.html)
Paolo will try to finish the sponsoring page (add all comments) - this is the
most important part that needs to be done.

b) plugin page (http://qgis.osgeo.org/download/plugins.html)
The plugin page is a bit tricky. I would like to have them automatically
updated/read from the relevant/official repositories and would be thankful if
someone can have a look here: http://qgis.osgeo.org/download/plugins.html

c) rss news feed page (http://qgis.osgeo.org/news.html)
There seems to be problem in joomla to show RSS feeds within an article. I don't
have a solution for that now, but will try to find one.

what would we need here? I can provide the css files, but I don't know if I
will have enough time to do it. Shall I send it to Gary?

I am hopeful that we will have the english manual ready or at least a preview
version that needs a final review by native english speaking people. There are
still a few days left and we will work hard to finish it :).

btw: There are still 23 python plugins listed in the official QGIS repository.
Will we repository clean up this repository or are all plugins relevant and
working with 1.0.? We started with the ftools so far and would like to add more
to the manual, but we don't know which are working and relevant. 

It would be very helpful to have a list of plugins here. And it would also be
good to know a little about the plugin strategy that we can add to the manual.

regards,
 Otto

Hi J?rgen:
 
I tried to link mingw grass libraries with visual studio creating
import libraries with no success
cmake recognizes the libraries but in linking time I get errors like 
 
_Vect_get_num_areas undefined symbol 
The def file exports that function as Vect_get_num_areas without underscore
analizing the dll with dependency walker I have found that the function name
is Vect_get_num_areas  also without underscore.
 
Using:  dumpbin /EXPORTS grass_vect.lib 
 
I found that the internal name is _Vect_get_num_areas
 
I don't know why lib tool is adding the underscore to import library
 
Any ideas on how to solve this problem?
 
Regards
Godofredo Contreras

Hi All,
Sorry I was quiet so long.

Exactly. They are required. Two further methods are optional but desirable:

authorName
homepage

Just for consistency with repository metadata - they are being used to fill 
Installer's fields when the plugin is not available in repositories (or just 
QGIS is offline).

It's too late now, but we can switch to ini files for QGIS 1.1. It will no 
problem to adjust the existing plugins, the qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp and the 
installer.

It's obviously worth of further arrangement!

The old repository will be depreciated and two new ones for 1.0 (moderated and 
unofficial) are being created now. I believe Gary will manage on time and 
we'll put the rewritten plugins to the new unofficial repo. Then the most 
valuable of them will be 'certified' and moved to the official repository.

But you can't wait and now need to know which of them will be officially 
supported - so we have to appoint a small council right now. Tim? Martin? 
Carson? Barry? Paolo? We just need two or three folks to make sure that we 
can take a responsibility for the particular plugin.

What do you mean by the plugin strategy? I'll write a short description of 
Plugin Installer and packaging rules for plugin developers. It will be done 
before until this Sunday, isn't it too late?

Ok, I think it's time to launch a py-QGIS IRC meeting, better if on the
QGIS channel.
I think at *very least* Martin, Borys and carson should be present.
Any suggestions?
All thew best.

Yup. I wrote a long reply to Paolo on this a while back, and Frank W
also had some good comments. Paolo perhaps you can pick up on that?

Ah yes I promised to look at this but havent had time yet.

Ok Borys answered this later in the thread. I think we should only list
and document official plugins and plugins included in QGIS itself. I
wrote some guideline proposals for acceptance of plugins into the
official repo for the last PSC meeting, but we never had time to discuss
them.

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Meeting_Nov_14%2C_2008

Perhaps we can include / link to this text somewhere on the plugins
pages too?

Great! I have checked out the manual here and just tracking down some
missing sty files so I can build it and then I will start to take a read
though.

As mentioned above we should only show the official 1.0 plugins - many
of the plugins in the existing repo are broken with 1.0 or are
inconsistent in various ways.  We need to adopt a mini incubation
process and then move them into official repo only when we are happy
with each's quality.

Thanks a lot Borys, what you wrote is what I was looking for and meant with
strategy. And please send me the short description of Plugin Installer and
packaging rules for plugin developers on sunday. I will be available until
monday afternoon and then offline probably until sunday 28th.

Ok, but now we need a quick pre-incubation in order to estimate which plugins 
will be accepted and included to the User Guide (I see no problem with a 
conditional accept, I can adjust some plugins if their authors are currently 
busy).

Otto, when we have the deadline for descriptions of those plugins?

Ok, so who could review and initially evaluate the plugins? I'm too busy until 
Sunday, but next week I can join these efforts.

I'm likely out of the game for the next little while. I don't think I'm 
going to be available for much this week, I might be free Friday or 
Saturday, after that I'm off to Canada until the 2nd.

Borys: If you do organise a pyQGIS irc meeting, let me know, and I'll 
try to make that.

Message-ID: <78769AED35BB457CBD4F9F32FC26A9A6@HPMarco>

Dear all,

I'm updating the whole build environment for MS Windows and I found that QT 
and Python had new releases since my last check/build setup;
I'm plannig to update them as follows:

QT: from 4.4.0 to 4.4.3

Python: from 2.5.2 to 2.6.1 or 3

there are know problems updating to those latest releases?
specially for Python, should I stay with the 2.x release or move to the 3? 
(note that they are both shipped as current stable version)

Thanks,

Marco

Marco,

As far as I know, Python 3 is incompatible with the 2.x line of 
releases. So we might want to avoid using it at the moment... I'm not 
sure if pyQt will like it much?


Cheers,

Carson

Not 3, for sure. We'd have to rewrite a whole lotta stuff.
FYI python 3 is not intended to be backwards compatible with 2 at least
that's what I've heard. I haven't tried.

2.5.2 or 2.6.1 should be ok. Might want to go 2.5.2 since that's what
most of the plugins are coded against.

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0812160304x58e53f84ga0041cfe6ac0cb51@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

it will be probably easier to discuss plugins for official repo here
on mailing list as I think that arranging an IRC meeting would be of
too much hassle. I suggest that these plugins should be official:

- plugin installer, mapfile export - they're already in source tree,
but should be possible to update them
- fTools
- table manager
- raster algebra
- (maybe) html image map

Some of these plugins are in other repositories (and their developers
probably prefer that), so I got the idea that official plugin
repository could work just as a "proxy". On update of a plugin,
authorized developer would just login to official repository and will
use pull function that will get the copy of plugin's archive and
metadata from the original repository. What do you think? Any other
ideas how official repo should work?

My other (and bigger) concern is about managing official repository
(and repository of other contributed plugins). Gary has written he's
going to set up official repository with limited write access and
other one, open for everyone. But I guess he's quite busy with other
things - until now I haven't seen any news about the progress.
Moreover, for future I think it's desirable that the repositories will
be managed by someone with more time. By managing I mean either doing
both changes in repository code when needed and giving permissions to
official repository. There will be surely further improvements in
plugins management and main repository should be able to react to
these needs.

We should do also some improvements to repository metadata - along
with much needed qgis_minimum_version tag there should be some more at
least, I think:
- last_update - date/time when the plugin has been recently updated
(so that one can see whether the plugin is being maintained)
- dependency - list of python modules which should be available for
execution of the plugins (e.g. R, psycopg, gdal, ogr ...)
- contact - author's email address in some spam-unfriendly format

Regards
Martin

Definitely 2.5 or 2.6.
SIP and PyQt4 aren't compatible with Python 3, neither plugins are...

Ok, I muddled with it and think I've made progress.
Please feel free to use all or none of my suggestions.

Attached are a modified copy of
http://download.qgis.org/downloads.rhtml
and more importantly
http://download.qgis.org/downloads.css

modeled after and meant to match:
http://qgis.osgeo.org/

The key changes to the html is the addition of several class,id tags,
and replacement of some tables with div tags. Also note the body has a
class to allow us to do the background color.

Things to do:
1. I think we need to reorganize and make tables by OS or Version to
break the list into smaller pieces that we can put anchor tags on, and
eventually a TOC at the top.

2. Rounded edges, shouldn't be too hard the corner images are available
from:
http://qgis.osgeo.org/
http://linfiniti.com/users/usercountry/

3. Navigation back to the main page, wiki etc.


If you're missing any images let me know, I tried to use images present
on the qgis.osgeo.org site in the same path structure.

Here's a screenshot of what it should look like:
http://imagebin.org/33772

Alex

Good work!

May I suggest few changes for download page?
- split table into several tables, each one with different version of QGIS
- put old downloads to a separate page
- version number should be a heading instead of a regular column

I think he has finished making the official repo - he can no doubt
supply more info..

I think the idea of having a proxy is a very good one. One thing that
worries me is that all these plugins that are flourishing around may
remain hidden, or get lost, when the original author will eventually
loose interest on it. So this applies also (even more so, in fact) to
unofficial plugins.
All the best.

Waiting for your comments.
Please note there are still a few questions unresolved:
- sponsorship levels; OSGeo levels are: 27/9/3k; I suggest adding a
bronze at 500; do we feel these are too high?
- how do we consider an organization (think of Kanton Solothurn and City
of Uster, our major contributors) when they do not provide money
directly, but hire a developer specifically for working on QGIS? Should
we establish an equivalence (e.g. one dev full time= platinum, one 50%
of time= gold, etc.), or just ignore it? I think there are strong points
with each approach.

Personally I dont know how many people are going to drop 27k in our laps
- maybe we should just leave the numbers as they are and see what
happens though...

I don't know either. It certainly does seem to be fair and worthwhile to
acknowledge this type of contribution. On the other hand the money isn't
being directed into our sponsorship programme to meet our stated goals
(e.g. funding hackfests etc) and rather is being directed to meet the
organisation's own specific goals. By this logic individual developers
could add up the man hours we have spent on the project and call
ourselves Platinum / Gold etc sponsors of the project based on the money
we would have generated had it been commercial work...

One of the important goals of sponsorship is that we can generate funds
to do the 'unsexy' parts of the QGIS project like documentation, design
and discussion of architecture, fund travel for meetings etc etc  -
things that companies typically wouldn't fund for their own purposes.
With this in mind I think it probably makes sense to regard these
contributions as 'donations' rather than sponsorship as per the
definitions I laid out in my original email - i.e. a once off 'in kind'
contribution to the project.

We should certainly credit all donors (and past finantial contributors
should probably be renamed from sponsors to donors too).


> - can we still say we are an all-volunteer project?

I guess not. Say rather 'largely  volunteer project'.

> - do we have an active PayPal account to link to the page?

As far as I know not.

Hi

Thanks to both Alex and Nicolas for responding for my plea for help!
Otto, I think it would be great to include the download page in a joomla
wrapper as I have done with the community site, so that to the end user
it all appears as one entity. Having both Alex and Nicolas respond is
great and I suggest we put it to a general vote to see which one to go
with. So all, please vote by responding 'A' or 'B' to this email!

A Proposal by Alex Mandel : http://imagebin.org/33772

B Proposal by Nicolas Bozon :

Thanks once again!

Nicolas integrated my comments about significant structure changes that
really needed to happen and it is intended to be wrapped by Joomla which
I also agree with.

The (only?) good thing of the 27/9/3 schema is that it follows the OSGeo
pattern, so we do not put QGIS on a lower leve than other projects.
I do not think it'll be a problem not filling up a Platinum position. We
can always change the levels for next year, especially if in accordance
with other OSGeo projects.

Sounds reasonable to me.

So what can we do for this? I would avoid setting up a new one, and we
have the problem of which account the money should go to. Any ideas?
All the best.

Tim,

I'd say it doesn't hurt to have a rarely used high category in a sponsorship
program. It gives organizations something to aim for, and you never know
when you will run into an organization that doesn't consider it unreasonable.

Don't forget that these levels have that cool 3-factoring coolness!

I would also say it helps keep it clear what the levels mean when they
follow a consistent scheme between projects.

I have reviewed the page (at Tim's suggestion) and I think it looks good.
A few notes:

  * When there is a sponsorship page, it should be linked to.
  * I found it odd that the silver and bronze logo sizes are the same.
  * There is one place where GDAL was not replaced with QGIS.
  * "a way fro individuals" should be "a way for individuals".

Best regards,

Hi all (especially Marco),

I know it's quite late now because of coming 1.0 release, but I'd like
to propose removal of QgsLine class. The reasons:
- there's no code in source tree that would make use of it
- there's no python binding so python plugins surely don't use it
- it's making impression it can be of some use, but in fact it's a
dummy class supporting only comparison with other QgsLine
- it's stating it's a line, however I guess it should be called line
segment instead to avoid confusion
- I have already a prototype of a line segment class which could have
(expected) functionality (e.g. find out closest point, return tangent,
angle ...) that might be added in 1.x release

Hi Paolo, 

I cleaned up the website a bit, fixed the 2 typos mentioned by Frank and would
like to suggest, that we have an extra page (sponsors.html?) where we list all
sponsors divided into classes who are currently listed under "Acknowledgements".
I think that would make the page clearer.

regards,
 Otto

Yes. Otto, would you like to make one? We can probably move the list of
donors there at the bottom. Also, their web sites should be transformed
into links.

My fault - fixed.

Hi all,

In this days I used the Label in the Layer Properties with the "Data 
definited style" option using a field in the associated table to give 
the size of the labels.
I'd like to have labels for some feautures in the layer and no labels 
for other feutures.
I seen that the lower size that I can put in the field is "1" but in 
this case the label appears also if very small.
If I put the number "0" in the size filed the label takes in automatic 
size "12".

Is this a bug or is not possible to have no lables for some feutures?

Regards
Leonardo

What about setting the transparency of the labels you want to hide?
Traditionally in order to only label some features we would need to
implement some type of SQL to select which features to apply labels to.
I don't think QGIS has this yet, but we can put it down on the list of
requested features.

Another work around is to extract the polygons you want to label to a
new layer and label that layer while keeping the styles of the 2 the
same. This would achieve the same look with a little more work.

Hi Martin,

Yes, QgsLine is pure legacy code.
Please go on and remove it from svn.

because we divided into donations and sponsorship I added a new page donors for
the list of donations and I would suggest we add another website sponsors, if we
have some sponsors.

I would vote for B. I added the download page in a joomla wrapper. After you
applied the css styles I will adapt the rest in Joomla.

table width should be set to "750" and I would also like to have the table split
up into different tables according to the release version.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python plugin repositories
Message-ID: <6AAC0B6E-10C6-4AB2-AC83-3AEA5FFC99C5@mrcc.com>

All,
The "official" repository is ready for testing. It consists of an  
administrative interface to manage the upload of plugins and the xml  
generator.

The XML contains the following new tags, which can be ignored or used  
as desired:
<qgis_minimum_version/> - Minimum version of qgis required by the plugin
<uploaded_by/> - user id of admin that uploaded the plugin to the  
official repository
<create_date/> - date the plugin was initially uploaded
<update_date/> - date the plugin or its metadata was updated

Additional fields as suggested by some can be easily added but this  
should be sufficient to allow inclusion in the packaging effort.

The administrative interface is at: http://pyqgis.org/admin/official

The xml describing the plugins in the repository is at: http://pyqgis.org/repo/official

If you wish to test the admin interface by uploading or editing  
plugins you will need an account and admin privileges. Accounts from  
the previous repository were carried forward. Send me an email if you  
want admin access for testing purposes. At present the following users  
have admin:

Tim Sutton
Borys Jurgiel

Any admin can grant admin privileges to a user. Final determination as  
to who gets admin privileges at release time is pending further  
discussion.

There is an XSL stylesheet to render http://pyqgis.org/admin/official  
in your browser. Please note that neither this or the admin interface  
is meant to be and end user interface. Users should interact with the  
repository through the plugin installer. Future work on a  
"presentation" layer for the XML is under consideration.

The interface for the user- contributed plugins is not ready yet but  
will be found at http://pyqgis.org/admin/contributed.

The XML for the contributed plugins will be generated by http://pyqgis.org/repo/contributed 
.

Please test and report problems to me.

Thanks,
-gary

Sorry to insist, but I think we should fin a solution soon: is there an
existing Paypal account we can use for this? If nothing better is
available, I can suggest our no-profit GFOSS.it http://gfoss.it/ (of
course a new button in English should be prepared).
I think it would be good to launch the service along the 1.0 and new
website.
All the best.

Sorry for not  replying sooner but I don't really have a good
solution. If we set up a paypal account my feeling is that it should
be a completely separate on from any other account for clarity of
accounting. I agree it would be great to get paypal / sponsors etc
sorted out for the release.

For me probably the ideal would probably be if we can form a EU non
profit organisation 'QGIS.org', open a bank account and have you, Otto
and Marco as co-signaturies on the account. And then setup paypal to
put money straight into that account. I dont know if this is even
possible, but as our financial guru I guess I'm looking to you for
leadership on this.

Thanks for following up on this!

Regards

Tim

I'm too busy these days, so I only can stop for a while in a net coffee and 
join an existing meetting. I have no free brain resources for organizing 
anything.

This tag should be required. 

Also, I see the possibility to upload plugins for the 0.x.  I thought we're 
going to leave the old repository for 0.x and use the new ones only for 1.x. 
If you prefer to move completely to the new repositories and close the old 
one, I can implement it in Installer.

> The administrative interface is at: http://pyqgis.org/admin/official

I can't edit the plugin you've uploaded. I think every admin should be allowed 
to edit any plugin, not only those uploaded by himself.

B.

I'm unable to replicate your problem. My test case:
- open a layer in QGIS
- open python console:
>>> id = iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer().getLayerID()
>>> QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers()
(prints a dictionary with QString keys and map layers as values)
>>> QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayer(id)
(layer is removed from legend and canvas)
>>> QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers()
(prints empty dictionary)

You can't expect that feature id when inserting to an empty layer will
be zero. That's why deleteFeatures() isn't working for you.

Right - we can leave the "old" repo active. I'll make the changes to the
admin interface.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Questions about backwards compatibility and
	documentation
Message-ID: <681d07c20812181944j5447f468h8ad5d3290dc1bbf1@mail.gmail.com>

I'm curious about the overall backwards compatibility plan looking
forwards.  Are things stabilizing?  I have a bunch of old work from
Ganymede that consitently crashes with the following message in the
terminal:

row number 0 is out of range 0..-1
Fatal: ASSERT failure in QList<T>::operator[]: "index out of range",
file /usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qlist.h, line 399

When I clicked though on the message box that comes up about reporting
issues to https://svn.qgis.org/trac/wiki, this page has a certificate
that expired a year ago and was generated for spatialserver.net.  So
confused!

Will this be less of a problem going forwards into 1.0?  Is there a
single file that's causing problems?  Is backwards and forwards
compatibility addressed within the documentation?  I didn't see this
*very* important issue mentioned in FAQ, ganymede (most recent) user,
etc.

Incidentally, I'm available for limited and
relatively-time-insensitive user guide proofreading and copy editing
over the next few weeks, if needed :)

best,
christian

Versions of QGIS prior to 1.0 did not guarantee API stability since the
application was undergoing rapid development of new features and we did
not want to commit ourselves to a fixed API. The upcoming release of
QGIS 1.0 will guarantee a backwards compatible API  for the 1.x and
1.0.x release series. 1.x releases will be our 'unstable' development
builds and 1.0.x releases our stable (bugfixes and very minor tweaks
only). 1.0.0 is due for release in about 2 weeks.

Posting a code snippet of what you were doing may help us to understand
why.

Since we have become an OSGEO Project, we have moved many of our web
properties onto OSGEO servers for long term continuity. Unfortunately
there is no easy way to update old URLS in deployed software. The
http://qgis.org site will always remain the canonical place for
information and you can consult that site for current links to trac etc.

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis is the current trac link.

We have updated a lot of the API documentation for the 1.0 release, and
based on your email I have added a comment about API stability to the
doxygen generated documentation. We will also be mentioning the fact
that we now provide a stable api in various other places as we make the
release.

I'm sure that Otto Dassau will appreciate your inputs here. He is not
ready for proof readers yet, but if you keep an eye on the
qgis-community mailing list (details for joining this list on
http://qgis.org) he will announce when he is ready for proof readers and
no doubt be pleased to get your inputs!

> Until now I didn't understand exactly what must be with the same name.

Sorry for my growing lags and let me explain:

Plugin Installer just needs a plugin identifier to be able to relate two 
plugin instances: the installed one with the one available in repositories. 
The most obvious identifier is the plugin directory, because it's just the 
module name in Python. It's also unique. So only one problem is how to 
implement this identifier in repository.

We could use yet another xml tag for storing the identifier but I think it 
would be more confusing, unclear and vulnerable to the packagers' mistakes. 
And it's definitely too late to implement so big change now.

So I've decided to pass the identifier as the .zip base name. I think it's the 
most clear and obvious to pack the directory into the zip package named the 
same:

identifier.zip

To be exact, the identifier can't contain any dots, so only the part of the 
name UNTIL THE FIRST DOT is recognized as the identifier. All further 
characters are rejected. It brings one more advantage which I introduced 
after my last email: you can freely add suffixes to the zip base names. So if 
you wish to provide your plugin in a few versions (for different APIs), you 
can name it in this manner:

identifier.zip
identifier.optional_suffix.zip
identifier.another_suffix.zip

They all will be recognized as 'identifier'. The suffixes will be rejected by 
Installer but they allow you to put a few zips into one directory in repo. 
Installer will choose the highest version compatible with the current API. Of 
course the directory inside the identifier.suffix.zip file has to be named 
without any suffix!

If you don't want to use the suffixes and wish to meet the rigid  
rule "identifier.zip contains the directory named: identifier" you can use 
the same filename and put into different locations. For example:
http://someHost/someDirectory/identifier.zip
http://someHost/anotherDirectory/identifier.zip

I hope it's clear now. "identifier.zip contains the directory named 
identifier" or "identifier.suffix.zip contains the directory named 
identifier". As you wish. We have only to remember to apply the suffix to the 
zip name BUT NOT to the contained directory.

I believe it's the simplest and most reliable solution I've found. If you have 
a better idea please let me know.

It would be great. I think we need complete wiki overhaul and there will be 
the best place for it. Or in our new www.pyqgis.org domain.

Very glad to read it, but this plugin is far from finish. I'm going to develop 
it in January, so it's gui should be stable in the latter half of the month. 
And then it will have to pass many murderous tests before I'll be able to 
take any responsibility for users' data...

Good idea. When an author upgrades his plugin in his own repo, the update is 
available prior for users with this repo enabled, so we have a time for 
testing before we'll decide to mirror the plugin in the main repo.

It would be very convenient - now Installer has to perform a trial loading 
before can say if something (and what) is missing.

> - contact - author's email address in some spam-unfriendly format

It's definitely an essential tag!

 I strongly recommend that authorName be compulsory, since it's
important that questions about plugins go to the right person.

 Packages for R have a compulsory 'Maintainer' field, which gives an
email contact for the current release, and an 'Author' field which
credits all the people involved (and doesn't need to be emails, just
names). Do we want to copy this idea for Qgis plugins? It may seem
trivial now, but when the mailing lists are swamped with people asking
questions about unattributed plugins....

Hello list.
I've just joined the dev ml, and while looking for some past threads, I've
found "geoprocessor object" [1]. Carson, would you share your start-up code?
It's something I was thinking about from a long time, but I've never found
the occasion to work on it...

Message-ID: <200812201455.32331.borys@wolf.most.org.pl>

Hi Folks,
We have a new shining 'gis' buttons for plugins, but most plugins 
don't support themes yet. I need to add a few lines of code to each 
plugin, so I'll wait for 1.0.1. 

Only one plugin where the fix is simple and safe is the grass plugin, 
which used to support themes already, but only themes compiled with qgis:

- ?QString myPath = ":/" + QgsApplication::themeName() + "/grass/" + theName;
+  QString myPath = QgsApplication::activeThemePath() + QDir::separator() + "grass" + QDir::separator() + theName;

- ?QString myDefaultPath = ":/default/grass/" + theName;
+ ?QString myDefaultPath = QgsApplication::defaultThemePath() + QDir::separator() + "grass" + QDir::separator() + theName;

I've commited in rev 9873. I believe it's completely safe change - however 
if anybody disagree to implement it in a last minute, I can revert it.

Regards,
B.

Hi Maxim

At the moment there is no dedicated maintainer for the GPS Plugin. Lars Luthman originally wrote the code but he is not active any more.
Feel free to work on the plugin and send us the patches.

Hi Borys

I am happy to have this change (grass plugin theme support). I would
have liked to have all plugins themeable but I had too many things on my
plate. It will be great if you patch plugin theming support after I tag
the 1.0.0 release this evening.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 1.0.0 - Call for packaging
Message-ID: <1229805706.7334.71.camel@timbuntu64>

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

--- Note to casual readers --- 

Please do not pre-announce this release - give the packagers and release
team a chance to do their thing so that people hearing about the release
have a fair chance of finding a package, reading all our press material
etc.

--- End note ---

Today I have branched 1.0.0. It would be great if you can assist by
making packages for your preferred platform. The branch can be checked
out at:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_0_0 svn qgis-1.0.0


Please do not commit anything to the branch except packaging related
tweaks. Source packages will be made available shortly. The release
checklist at :

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist1.0.0

Has a list of people who have previously made packages. If you make a
package for 1.0.0 please be so kind as to add the url to that wiki page
in the section provided so that we can gather all the url packages in a
systematic way. If you are able to make packages for unlisted
platforms / distros please let me know so that we can avoid duplication
of effort.
I would like to make the release announcement around the 28th or 29th
Dec 2008, so it will be great to have as many packages as possible ready
by then.

SVN Unstable (Trunk) is open again for general commits.
SVN Stable (the 1.0.x branch) is open for minor tweaks and bug fixes
only. No new features should be added without prior consultation with
the developer list (but your request to add a new feature will probably
be refused). 

Please not that we are aiming to do the next unstable (QGIS 1.1.0)
release within two months or so (timetable to be determined) and you
should not make any major feature changes without prior discussion with
PSC and Dev list.

Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS a
reality.

For a glimpse at just how much work has gone into this release (278
tickets closed!), head over to:

Finally! :)

However I've a little problem: I expected the branch would be created today so 
you've forestalled the final PL translation revision. Do everybody forgive me 
if I break the discipline and commit it now? I'm really torn making the 
precedent but we have made a huge set of fundamental corrections and it's 
_really_ important for me (and I think I can say also for Maciek & Robert) to 
apply them in 1.0.0

Those language changes are crucial for GIS newcomers and can decide on 
QGIS success in Poland as free, powerful and *easy to follow* software.
So if it won't break you work too much ...

Hi Borys

I wish there was an easy way for me to say yes we can accommodate your
request, but really we cant.  The release branch is only for packaging
changes and any translation stuff you commit runs the risk of being
selectively packaged which I think is worse than not being packaged at
all.

I did mention yesterday as being the release cut off date in my email
dated Dec 14 2008 entitled 'QGIS 1.0 branched - please read to prepard
for 1.0.0 release.'

Currently I have no computer access till the 27th so even the above
issue aside, it would not be possible for me to manage the priocess
from my cellphone out in the middle of the bush.

I think the better solution is to do a short sharp 1.0.1 release with
release date of end Jan 2009.  There is also the possibilty of making
the .qm compiled translation file for polish available as an
additional download.



regards Tim

Tim,

I understand what is the freeze for and of course have no intention to use a 
fait accompli while you're offline, so I can revert the change and beg 
Packagers for including the corrected version off their own hand.

But you've clearly wrote about not yet commited change, while I commited it 
tomorrow as early as it was possible, so reverting it would only increase the 
inconsistency you've said. So I still don't know your decision...

It's MUCH better I think. Robert has made a great effort providing the 
complete translation but unfortunatelly we have initially introduced some 
ugly and unclear terms to a further investigation. All Polish documentation 
will contain the corrected terms, so it's important to eliminate the ugly 
ones from the LTS version.

Believe me I wouldn't raise this issue and make this mess if it hadn't really 
critical! :) I know we all are busy enough.

Hi Borys

If you already committed it to the 1.0.0 branch I suggest to just
leave it there and then also make the .qm file available for cases
where packagers may be using the src bundle I prepared or a checkout
from prior to your commit.

best regards

It's not:

Message-ID: <200812212232.15849.borys@wolf.most.org.pl>

To All who make packages

As you've probably noticed, today morning I've made a little mess commiting a 
last minut fix for Polish i18n. So if you're making the packages from current 
svn state (after Sunday 12:07 GMT), EVERYTHING IS OK.

But if you wish to use a svn checkout EARLIER than Sunday 12:07 GMT (e.g. the 
Tim's yesterday's snapshot) please note it contains the old qgis_pl_PL.ts 
file. In this case it would be great if you used the current version of this 
file:
  
  https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_0_0/i18n/qgis_pl_PL.ts

(or the compiled .qm file if you're after compilation already):

  http://bwj.aster.net.pl/qgis/qgis_pl_PL.qm


I apologize for this trouble, it was really important for Polish localization. 

Regards,
B.

Package for Debian Testing/Lenny i386 built flawless. Thanks to 
all the people who cared the Debian files.

I uploaded to the apt-gettable repository:

I hope to package for amd64 soon.

Hi Robert,

Fate will that I just send a mail to the osgeo-discuss list with the  
proposal to use the Tango-set for foss4g applications and create a  
GIS superset for our specific needs. So I'm very happy with the work  
you've done so far. I'm wondering if you would be interested to help  
to create a complete tango set for all applications to be used (in a  
similar way the tango project does it). This does involve creating a  
icon-name-specification and a svn with icons in three sizes etc.

Hi Niccolo,

Thank you for packaging and repository for debian users,
I use debian sid (i386)


1) I can't see icons in the tool bar of grass (but i can click the 
buttons) ...

2) When i enable evis plugin, i get a segmentation fault :
$ LANG=C qgis

I'm very glad to read that we have so much in common!
Yes, that is also my long-term goal. To make GIS icon theme/set.
That's why I have started common-icon-naming-problem and icon-symbology
scalability problem in terms of GIS applications diversity.

However, in my opinion at this moment we should focus more on symbols than
different icon sizes. Basic size for toolbars (small icons) is not scalable
upsize. So we can't make just one SVG and scale it. That is why I focused on
toolbar icons size. They are the most important I think. I have very limited
time and try to correlate my efforts with QGIS/GRASS relases. That is why I
didn't start cooperation with Tango people yet. I would prefer to have core
symbols selected and then start talking with them about design details. Tango
was mine main inspiration, so I try to follow their guidelines, but not
strictly.

It would be great to work together with you and with Tango people.

regards,
Robert

So probably the icon files are misplaced. The grass plugin looks for them in 
this location now: 

QgsApplication::defaultThemePath() + "/grass/"

Obviously it is an awful lot of work to create icons in all sizes  
Tango proposes, as such I do understand that you did not do that. The  
work you've done so far is marvelous, creating an entire set of icons  
for QGIS is a whole lot of work in itself. So what I'm proposing is  
to help you to design more icons and in more sizes. So I'm looking  
for a way how we can work together to create on one side a consistent  
set for QGIS/GRASS, which is obviously your main concern and on the  
other side to create a stock set for the OSGeo community.
So I like to setup some more general system in the osgeo (or tango)  
infrastructure with the icons we have so far in both SVG and png.  
Also push the icon naming scheme a bit more so projects can easily  
use our icons. If you think this is a good idea I'll contact the  
Tango people to get some more information on setting up a icon- 
repository (tango-artist mailinglist) and we can continue on happy  
designing.

Hi Magnus,

Regarding Georeferencer, we're mostly finished, the code is in our svn,
waiting to be put in Georeferencer or separate (Georeferencer-GDAL)
plugin, this needs to be decided sometime.

What we did for new Georefencer:
- integrated GDAL procedures for polynomials (1,2,3) and tps
transformation as possible choices;
- changed window layout, got rid of two windows, everything now fits
into one;
- some cosmetics and small improvements usability wise.

Some more info is here: http://gis-lab.info/qa/qgis-georef-new-eng.html

Regarding GPS, we are in planning phase, generally our plan was to
improve usability of the plugin to be able to load/save to GPS from
legend and some other stuff. No changes yet done. I planned to let the
list know what we'd like to do to be able to discuss.

Overall, I'm waiting to transition-to-release activity to settle and
holidays to pass. There is lots of drinking here around New Year, so you can guess what
kind of quality code might be produced ;)

Thank you Borys,

I can see grass icons in /usr/share/qgis/themes/default/grass/

But i can't select "Icon theme" in QGIS options / General.
There is nothing to select ...

I think this is the problem i have.

Strange thing. It seems that all the icons are now handled in the same manner, so if something was wrong with the QgsApplication:defaultThemePath() or QgsApplication:pkgDataPath() all icons should be missing...

[RESOLVED]

There was some old packages not entirely removed during the install of 
1.0.0 :

$ aptitude search qgis
c   libqgis-core0.10                - QGIS Geographic Information System 
- share
i   libqgis-core0.11                - Quantum GIS - shared core 
library        
i A libqgis-core1                   - Quantum GIS - shared core 
library        
v   libqgis-dev                     
-                                          
c   libqgis-gui0.10                 - QGIS Geographic Information System 
- share
i   libqgis-gui0.11                 - Quantum GIS - shared gui 
library         
i A libqgis-gui1                    - Quantum GIS - shared gui 
library         
i   libqgis1-dev                    - Quantum GIS - development 
files          
i   python-qgis                     - Python bindings to Quantum 
GIS           
v   python2.5-qgis                  
-                                          
i   qgis                            - Geographic Information System 
(GIS)      
i   qgis-plugin-grass               - Plugin for accessing GRASS data 
from Quant

So, i purge these old packages :
$ sudo aptitude purge libqgis-core0.10 libqgis-core0.11 libqgis-gui0.10 
libqgis-gui0.11

and now all is fine ...

Thank you

Guy

I updated the debian/ tree a bit.  I added files that integrate QGIS and
related files into GNOME+XFCE+KDE filemanagers.  Maybe some more
debian-packaging-savvy people than me care to review the current state
of the package.

Afterwards I updated our Launchpad PPA.
https://launchpad.net/~qgis/+archive now carries 1.0.0 packages for
Ubuntu Gutsy, Hardy and Intrepid.

PS: Unfortunatly I noticed only after uploading the sources, that I
    updated the german translation in my tree.  The updated files are
    available http://www.norbit.de/~jef/qgis_de.{ts,qm,diff}.

Dear qgis devs,

The advanced printing branch 2 is ready to be tested now that feature freeze 
is over. You can obtain the sources with:

svn co http://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/advanced_printing_branch2

In the branch, there are some new features (all inside the print composer):

- alignment of items
- snapping of items to a grid
- preview for svg images
- composer templates

Please report any issues you find with those new features. I'm going to be in 
vacations for some time and will adress them in the new year.


Merry christmas and happy new year,
Marco

BTW: I'm getting a bit worried about bits and pieces of interesting and
useful code being spread over the internet, with little visibility and
control over its fate.
I would humbly suggest everybody to keep everything on the main svn,
either in HEAD or in specialized branches, wherever possible.
All the best, and many thanks.

These are questions best directed to Marco Pasetti. I believe he will be
away until early Jan though...

For MrSid and Ecw support I would suggest making these a separate 'add
on' download until the licensing implications of shipping these libs is
unequivocally resolved (much as I would like to see them shipped by
default).

We are investigating on this. Muddled situation, it seems. It would be
good to know how other sw has resolved the issue (FWTools, gvSIG).
Any suggestion will be welcome.
All the best.

For my OSX GDAL framework, I use separate downloads.  I thought it  
seemed clear that binary distribution with open source software was  
OK, but so many others are not so sure that I decided to play it safe.

Hi William,
thanks for your feedback. Perhaps I missed your point, but I do not see
how safer it would be to distribute the non-free drivers as separate
plugins. If the licence does not allow redistribution, then it makes no
difference, or?
All the best.

I'm quite sure they allow distribution of binaries.  Though with ECW  
you may need to use an older source distribution (I'm using  
v3.3-2006-09-06) - recent distributions changed the license to be more  
restrictive (especially after Leica got ahold of it), I think, I  
haven't looked closely at them.

And it looks like they allow binary distribution as a part of open  
source software.

I think the main question is license compatibility, especially with  
the GPL.  They're probably not (I'm no expert on the GPL), though they  
try to appear to be.  Their licenses may work with GDAL, but not with  
Qgis or GRASS.

Hi Tim,

I believe the qrc file for GRASS plugin is redundant now since I've swithed to 
reading the png files in r9872: 

- ?QString myPath = ":/" + QgsApplication::themeName() + "/grass/" + theName;
+  QString myPath = QgsApplication::activeThemePath() + "/grass/" + theName;

and

- ?QString myDefaultPath = ":/default/grass/" + theName;
+ ?QString myDefaultPath = QgsApplication::defaultThemePath() + "/grass/" 
theName;

This fix allows the use of themes not compiled into QGIS but installed 
separatelly.

Hi

When I tested with your r9862 change below, it didnt pick up my grass
'gis' theme icons.

If we are going to go the non qrc route we will need to change all the
plugins to install their icons into 

<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/share/qgis/themes/<foo theme>

The qrc approach is kinda nice in that it makes the plugins self
contained. Its also possible to combine the two approaches - look in the
qrc file for the theme icon and if its not there look in the file based
themes dir, and if its not there either fall back to the default icon.

Regards

Tim

My idea is to combine them too, but with different search odrer:
1. file-based current theme icon (in share/qgis/themes/[ACTIVE]/plugins/)
2. file-based default theme icon (in share/qgis/themes/default/plugins/)
3. qrc-based local plugin icon


QIcon QgsCopyrightLabelPlugin::getThemeIcon( const QString theName )
{
  QString myCurThemePath = QgsApplication::activeThemePath() + "/plugins/" + theName;
  QString myDefThemePath = QgsApplication::defaultThemePath() + "/plugins/" + theName;
  QString myQrcPath = ":/" + theName;
  if ( QFile::exists( myCurThemePath ) )
  {
    return QIcon( myCurThemePath );
  }
  else if ( QFile::exists( myDefThemePath ) )
  {
    return QIcon( myDefThemePath );
  }
  else if ( QFile::exists( myQrcPath ) )
  {
    return QIcon( myQrcPath );
  }
  else
  {
    return QIcon();
  }
}


It should provide the most uniform look and still saves the plugin
independence. You've written:

// Note this code is duplicated from qgisapp.cpp because
// I didnt want to make plugins dependent on qgsapplication (...)

It's dependent on QgsApplication::activeThemePath() and ::defaultThemePath(), 
but it's very easy to liberate by commenting them out and leaving
only the last (qrc) path.

So if you agree, I'll aply this unified combined version to all plugins.

Message-ID: <4cbd7b750812280732m6d244c68s2dba2f94e83e93c5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am currently trying to write a plugin for QGis. I just need a simple
thing: be able to catch click events. So, I just added in my plugin this
piece of code:

// plugin.hpp
// ...
QgsMapToolEmitPoint* m_toolEmitPoint;
// ...
private slots:
   // ...
   void canvas_clicked(QgsPoint &point, Qt::MouseButton button);

// plugin.cpp
// in the constructor
m_toolEmitPoint = new QgsMapToolEmitPoint(m_mapCanvas);
QObject::connect( (QgsMapToolEmitPoint*)m_toolEmitPoint ,
SIGNAL(canvasClicked()) , this ,
SLOT(canvas_clicked(QgsPoint&,Qt::MouseButton)) );
// I also tried this version, but it does not work better:
QObject::connect( (QgsMapToolEmitPoint*)m_toolEmitPoint ,
SIGNAL(canvasClicked(QgsPoint&,Qt::MouseButton)) , this ,
SLOT(canvas_clicked(QgsPoint&,Qt::MouseButton)) );

void plugin::canvas_clicked(QgsPoint &point, Qt::MouseButton button)
{
    QMessageBox msg;
    msg.setText("Canvas clicked !");
    msg.exec();
}

The problem is that with the above code, the function canvas_clicked is
never called. So, what am I doing wrong ? Do I misunderstand how to use
QgsMapToolEmitPoint ?

Could please help me ?

Best regards,

Olivier

When connecting signals and slots, you should use methods with the same
signature e.g.:

connect( mpMapTool, SIGNAL( mouseClicked( QgsPoint ) ), this,
SLOT( mouseC    licked( QgsPoint ) ) );

Take a look at the coordinatecapture plugin in qgis src for an easy to
follow example:

src/plugins/coordinate_capture/coordinatecapture.cpp

Marco,

The source builds well on my OS X system. I have not put it through  
its paces, but it looks good so far. I still have the problem with  
unusual scaling of pattern fills for vector polygons that I recently  
reported. Attached is a screenshot of that problem.

Happy New Year as well,
John

Hi Folks

In case you are wondering why I haven't put out the release
announcement, we are waiting for more binary packages to become
available. Many of the folks who normally package for us are off on
holiday and I don't want to put out the announcement without there being
something for eager users to download!

Marco Pasetti mentioned having a package available for windows around
the 5th of Jan so I will at the least await his package before making
any announcement. For those still toiling in the background trying to
get various things ready that gives you a little time.

Best regards and happy new year!

I've built the packages for Fedora 9, 10, and 11 and made them available here 
[1] and am currently building them for Fedora proper so people will just be 
able to 'yum install fedora' without having to add my repository.

Message-ID: <e12429640812291418j1546743et13643eb9fa3f9c97@mail.gmail.com>

In the past days I've begun "studying" qgis source code, to understand
the raster subsystem. I've seen that it is mostly included in the
"core/raster/" folder code, dedicated to the reading (and a certain
manipulation) of gdal supported formats. In fact the
"rasterdataprovider", at this moment, is a wrap on gdal methods, and
the only exported ability is "Identify". Now that qgis 1.0.0 is out,
are you considering to put the hands on the raster system, to
update/improve it? Is the creation of a generic raster data provider
system (like for vectors) in the main roadmap?

thanks and bye,
Giovanni

I've built and submitted the packages in Fedora for F10 and F11.  I've decided 
not to build it for F9 since it's in maintenance mode and I'd prefer to not 
push new packages there.  They can still be retrieved from my repository if 
people want qgis 1.0.0 for F9.

Correct. There is also providers/wms which is a raster provider.

There has been some debate about whether we should implement a provider
architechture or make use of GDAL entirely and expect that new format
support is provided via GDAL.

There is a fledgling wiki page here:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Raster_Development_Page

That outlines plans. There are also many ideas we have tossed around
that arent in that page such as an api for performing kernel / moving
window analyses so that we can implement smooth / sharpen etc type
analytical functions.

Peter Ersts is our Raster maintainer and if you are interested I am sure
he would welcome your help / joining the raster team.

Best regards

Message-ID: <20DEC8FD-7385-4E95-9C31-6ADF5CCE5139@me.com>

For some reason, when you click on 'About QGIS' from the application  
menu in OS X (the menu item labeled 'QGIS'), you get a dialog on  
Carson Farmer's ftools package if it is installed. If you go to the  
Help menu and click About, you get the correct dialog that should also  
be mapped to the application menu 'About QGIS' item. I suspect there  
should be a separate item under the Tools menu for ftools.

When ftools is removed, the dialog is greyed out until you restart the  
application. After restarting the application without ftools, the  
'About QGIS' item brings up the correct dialog.

Hi All,
Since we still didn't bring the 'plugin committee' into existence and Otto is waiting 
for a decision which plugins should be decribed in the User Guide, I've taken a look 
at all our plugins. I've initially choosen a few of them which meet the requirements:
- they expand wide-purpose QGIS capabilites in a significant degree
- they look complete and close (not like they was under construction)
- they are tested and stable
- their authors are still 'alive'
- their are GPL licensed

They are:
- Zoom To Point (by Gary; already present in the official repo)
- fTools (by Carson of course)
- manageR (by Carson; not yet rewritten for 1.0!)
- PostGIS Manager (by Martin - is working now?)
- Scattegram (by Ghislain)
- Value Tool (by Ghislain)

The next 4 aren't GPL licensed, but I would see them in the offcicial Repo if their 
Authors agreed to release them on a free license:
- Find By Attribute (by Mauricio)
- Click Fu (by Barry)
- Raster Algebra (by Barry, not completely rewritten yet!)
- Select Plus (by Barry)

Please discuss if you disagree for including one of them or wish to include any other 
plugin. Complete list is in the attached csv.

Regards,
B.

PS. This was my last QGIS activity in this year ;) so I thank you all for all the help, 
cooperation, kindness (sometimes patience;) and just for all that fun we have working 
together! It's harder than usually to wish a happy New Year, but hopefully it will be 
a great year for OSS and us all:) See you in two days!

 I will stick a LICENSE file in the plugin's folders real soon, making
them GPL. Actually on the Google code page it states they are GPL, but
GPL requires a copy of the LICENSE in there, so I'll get onto that.

Some comments though:

 * Click Fu is happily pretty complete. Maybe it needs some
documentation. Otherwise it's good to go.

 * Raster Algebra will soon be overtaken by RasterLang. It's a simple
prefix-notation language (a bit like LISP) for raster manipulation. So
you can do stuff like (/ dem1 1000) to scale a DEM, or (+ (band img1
1) (band img1 2)) to add two bands from a raster image. It is
intentionally quite simple, and doesn't let you do more than one
expression at a time - if you want to do something more complex then
the recommendation is to do it at the python prompt. This plugin just
gives you a simple way to do simple expressions. I'd like to rewrite
the parser to make the language more like python but kept this way
it's been quite easy to deal with (but requires the pyparsing module).
Currently the parser works, it can evaluate expressions, I just need
to hook it into Qgis properly for reading and writing rasters. It
should be quite easy to extend with new operators.

 * SelectPlus has a big problem in that I wasn't aware that some
layers (GRASS) didn't allow random-access selections, and you have to
loop through features and select sequentially. Graargh. Plus it has
problems with projections when circles aren't circles and straight
lines aren't straight lines. These things can be fixed but I'd see a
lot of people going "I can't select my grass layer points with a
polygon" until it's fixed.

 Plugin code is all heaped here:

 if anyone wants to submit patches or want write-access...

I'd like to see the Home Range plugin included, but I do not know if  
Anne is in touch or if someone else can take over maintenance. This is  
a suite of tools that adds nice ecological expansion to qgis.

Barry,

What is the working repo url for your plugins? I'm getting a failure  
to connect with the old repo link from the wiki:
http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Qgis/Plugins/plugins.xml

Thanks,
John

 Yeah, our estates team scheduled a power cut in our building for Dec
30th, which meant we had to power down everything before we went off
for our hols on Dec 24th, and can't power it all back up again until
Monday 5th...

 The google code repository is more up-to-date anyway, and has Qgis
1.0-compatible versions. Just extract using SVN and move to your qgis
python/plugins/ folder.
